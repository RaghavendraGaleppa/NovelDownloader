# Chapter 58: The Great Freedom Avalokiteshvara Heart Sutra!

"Do you know why our sect is called the Hidden Scripture Valley, kid?"

As Jiang Li was examining the dilapidated hall, wondering why no one had bothered to repair it, Elder Li—who rarely spoke—suddenly posed this question.

"Because our sect possesses the largest scripture repository and the most extensive collection of texts in the Great Heavy Mountain region."

This was what Weng Sanqi had told him when he first chose to join the sect.

"Yes, the scripture repository. But do you know how the cultivation manuals and texts in our repository came to be?"

Elder Li approached the ruined hall, running his hand along the damaged gate with a sigh. This time, he didn't wait for Jiang Li's answer before continuing, finally revealing some of the sect's history and secrets.

When Jiang Li first joined the sect, he learned that the Hidden Scripture Valley was formed over two hundred years ago when a group of rogue cultivators jointly occupied an ancient ruin that had emerged from obscurity. However, he had never known what that ruin actually was. Now, listening to Elder Li, he understood that the foundation of their sect lay within this very ruined hall.

Walking around the hall, Jiang Li noticed four grand gates, each inscribed with a single character: "Spirit," "Qi," "Body," and "Technique." These represented the four great paths of cultivation. Entering any one of these gates would grant a disciple a precious inheritance from ancient times. Most remarkably, it was said that the Scripture Transmission Hall would bestow upon each disciple the legacy most suited to their aptitude and characteristics. Even fragmented techniques could provide immense benefits to cultivators.

Wait—fragmented techniques?

Jiang Li suddenly recalled the ancient manual, "Withered Wood Art," which only contained a broken portion of the Qi Refining stage. Could it be that the numerous incomplete ancient manuals in the scripture repository were all inherited by sect predecessors from this very hall?

As this question arose in his mind, Elder Li confirmed it. The Scripture Transmission Hall was a relic left behind by an immortal sect from the ancient era, its exact origins lost to time. Ravaged by the ages and further damaged during the great battle when the ruin first emerged, its power had long since waned. Moreover, the cultivation systems of the ancient era differed vastly from those of the present, making restoration nearly impossible. To prevent further damage, the sect had no choice but to leave it as it was.

Because of this, the hall's functions were severely impaired. What kind of inheritance one could obtain inside now depended entirely on two things: comprehension and luck.

Over the years, countless inner disciples and high-ranking sect members had entered the Scripture Transmission Hall. Like ants carrying away grains of sand, they gradually deciphered and transcribed fragments of ancient techniques, contributing to the vast—albeit incomplete—collection in the scripture repository. Combined with the cultivation methods and techniques donated by the rogue cultivators who founded the sect, this eventually formed the Great Heavy Mountain's foremost scripture repository.

After listening to Elder Li's explanation, Jiang Li glanced at his pitifully low comprehension stat and couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration.

"Now, make your choice. Which of the four gates will you enter?"

The four gates unmistakably represented cultivation methods for the spirit, qi, body, and divine arts. After a long moment of contemplation, Jiang Li finally spoke.

"I choose the Spirit Gate."

The reason was simple: he already had cultivation methods for qi and body refinement, as well as divine arts. However, techniques for refining the spirit were exceedingly rare and beyond his current reach. There would be opportunities to return to this hall in the future, but for now, the most urgent task was to address his glaring deficiency in spirit cultivation.

"A wise choice. If your luck and comprehension are sufficient, this inheritance might increase your chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment by thirty percent in the future."

Elder Li's words were cryptic but hinted that mastering a spirit-refining technique could greatly aid in cultivation breakthroughs.

"Then I must trouble Elder Li."

Elder Li first took out two mid-grade spirit stones and embedded them into the grooves on either side of the Spirit Gate. Then, producing the token from earlier, he recited an incantation and cast a beam of spiritual light onto the gate.

With a creaking groan, the Spirit Gate slowly swung open.

"Enter the hall and sit cross-legged before the stele, focusing your mind!"

"You have only one hour! Make the most of it!"

The energy consumption of the hall was staggering—merely opening it for an hour required two mid-grade spirit stones. Before Jiang Li could even marvel at this, Elder Li's urging sent him rushing inside.

The interior was vast and empty, dominated by a jet-black stele that had been severed at the waist. What had the cultivators of the past done in this hall? Couldn't they have just fought somewhere else instead of damaging such a precious ancient inheritance?

Suppressing his complaints, Jiang Li steadied his mind and sat cross-legged on a cushion before the stele. As his weight settled, a small pre-set mechanism activated. A faint glow emanated from an array, and a yellow stick of incense in a burner before him spontaneously ignited.

"Amitabha, great compassion—grant me an overwhelmingly powerful supreme technique!"

Sitting on the cushion, Jiang Li muttered an incoherent prayer. Strangely enough, this time his superstitious gesture seemed to have some effect.

An indescribable warmth enveloped him, gradually calming his mind and spirit. A faint voice whispered something in his ear, too soft to discern, yet it seemed to have already received an answer. Moments later, the voice began to slowly impart knowledge, still murmuring indistinctly.

Jiang Li strained to hear, his brows furrowing deeper in frustration, but he could grasp nothing. His breathing grew uneven, and agitation crept into his heart—until a wisp of fragrant smoke reached his nose, easing his tension and clearing his mind.

The whispers in his ear became intermittently audible, though only in disjointed fragments. Yet each syllable struck him like thunder, as if enlightenment was just within reach. Golden light, lotuses, purple bamboo, and the profound mysteries of the world's melodies formed hazy visions, entrancing him. It felt as though the secrets of the universe lay before him, waiting to be grasped—yet remained forever elusive.

Unconsciously, Jiang Li immersed himself completely, his lips moving haltingly as he struggled to articulate a few words:

"Great... Freedom... Avalokiteshvara... Heart... Sutra!"
