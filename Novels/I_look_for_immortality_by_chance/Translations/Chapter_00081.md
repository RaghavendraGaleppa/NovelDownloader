# Chapter 81: Return to the Academy, Yun Hanxiu's Bandit Cultivation Manual  

Even after returning to the Qian Yuan Cave, Gu Yuan couldn't help but replay the scene of Zhou Qisheng's attack in his mind.  

"Just a single hand seal from a Foundation Establishment cultivator can pierce through mountains and slay the most formidable demonic beasts of the Qi Refining stage..."  

The effortless ease of that display left Gu Yuan in awe. It represented a tremendous leap in the hierarchy of life—so vast that it rendered any thought of resistance futile. A Qi Refining cultivator could never hope to kill a Foundation Establishment expert.  

"Still... with all this, I should be able to aspire to Foundation Establishment, shouldn't I?"  

Looking at the scattered storage pouches on the ground, a smile finally crept onto Gu Yuan's lips.  

With all matters settled and his safe return to the academy, it was time to inspect his spoils. These were the resources that would pave his future path.  

Setting aside Yun Hanxiu's storage pouch for the moment, Gu Yuan began refining the others first. Without their owners, the pouches posed no resistance to his dragon-like spiritual sense and were soon refined.  

There were six pouches in total.  

Three came from the spirit peaks, looted from demonic beasts. Inside were mostly spirit fruits, medicinal herbs, ores, and scattered spirit stones—nothing particularly valuable, each worth around two to three hundred spirit stones at most.  

But small gains add up. Gu Yuan wasn't one to disdain such things, so he gathered them into one pouch and stored them carefully.  

The remaining three pouches had been taken from Yun Hanxiu, who had robbed them from other cultivators. These were far more valuable, containing over a dozen magical artifacts of decent quality.  

By rough estimation, each pouch was worth at least four hundred spirit stones.  

After consolidating everything, Gu Yuan finally opened Yun Hanxiu's personal storage pouch.  

He had high expectations for this one.  

Though Yun Hanxiu had been deranged, her strength was undeniable, and she was cunning. If she hadn’t been a disciple of the academy—and one about to be accepted by a Foundation Establishment master—Gu Yuan might have truly considered using the methods from the Bandit Cultivation Manual to control her and make her serve him.  

But attempting to manipulate a Foundation Establishment master’s disciple was pure fantasy.  

Moreover, Yun Hanxiu’s temperament made her an inherent liability.  

If she could submit to Gu Yuan today, she could just as easily submit to someone stronger tomorrow.  

*Clatter!*  

As the pouch opened, a cascade of spirit stones spilled out.  

A quick count revealed around four hundred.  

Beyond the spirit stones were numerous bottles, jars, jade boxes, and locks.  

"Corpse-Rot Incense!"  

"Ghostheart Worms!"  

"Flying Scorpion Pills!"  

"Shiva Incense!"  

"Skyghost Incense!"  

Many of these sinister items were things Gu Yuan had only read about in the Bandit Cultivation Manual. Now, they lay scattered before him.  

Amid the bottles and jars was a green-bound book.  

*The Bandit Cultivation Manual.*  

On the first page, two lines of delicate handwriting leaped out with unshakable confidence:  

*"I, Yun Hanxiu, will become the greatest bandit cultivator under heaven!"*  

*"Even if I die, I will die on the path of banditry—never rotting away in some mountain!"*  

*"This book will become the most formidable bandit cultivation manual in the world!"*  

The words carried such intense emotion and conviction that Gu Yuan could almost see Yun Hanxiu’s frenzied gaze staring back at him.  

*"My Yun family has been bandit cultivators for generations, yet none of our ancestors amounted to anything. Most died horribly or withered away from old age—not a single notable figure among them."*  

*"What a disgrace to the Yun name!"*  

*"At three, I stole my brother’s silver. At five, I snatched the magistrate’s seal. By seven, I was already planning my first heist..."*  

*"But as I grew older, I realized there were always greater masters beyond my reach. The Yun family was too small..."*  

*"... A true bandit cultivator must never be recognizable on the surface."*  

*"... Even bandits need protection. Damned alchemy—I’ll have to pick it up again. I need a legitimate front, just in case enemies come knocking..."*  

*"... The Lotus Dragon Embryo Seal—could it truly be as miraculous as they say?"*  

*"... Hah! I’ve finally found a lead on the Three Hearts Seal! Once I master this, Foundation Establishment will be within reach!"*  

*"... Hahaha! I’ve finally refined Skyghost Incense and Ghostheart Worms! Now, I can head to Flying Wave Mountain!"*  

The green book ended abruptly there.  

Closing it, Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.  

He hadn’t expected this to be Yun Hanxiu’s personal bandit cultivation manual—a record of her half-mad life.  

Reading the life story of someone he had killed gave even Gu Yuan a strange feeling.  

But he shook his head, brushing off the sentiment, and turned his attention back to Yun Hanxiu’s storage pouch.  

Inside, there were also four jade slips and seven glowing magical artifacts.  

Gu Yuan refined the artifacts one by one, then sent his spiritual sense into the jade slips.  

*"Gale-Summoning Seal: When activated, conjures a fierce wind that amplifies fire techniques. Wind fuels flames; flames ride the wind—a seamless union."*  

*"Lotus Seal: Summons protective lotus blossoms. The higher the cultivation, the more lotuses manifest. If one consumes a rare spirit lotus and integrates it into the seal, it can evolve into the Lotus Treasure Seal, gaining divine properties."*  

*"Centuries ago, the ruler of Zhongshan Kingdom was seemingly bewitched by demonic tribes. Defying celestial edicts, he launched a devastating assault on the Three Methods Sect, sweeping through multiple sects. Eventually, the Qingfeng Academy appeared to receive a divine decree, leading allied sects to annihilate Zhongshan Kingdom, reducing its vast territory to ruins."*  

*"Numerous sects perished in the conflict."*  

*"Countless treasures and arcane techniques were scattered during the war. The Three Methods Daoist rose mysteriously, suspected to be the last true disciple of the Three Methods Sect, having mastered the Three Hearts Seal!"*  

*"The Three Hearts Seal is one of the Three Methods Sect’s secret seals—a rare body seal in this world. Obtaining it could herald the rise of my Yun family."*  

*"Lotus Dragon Embryo Seal..."*  

*"Hm? Nothing else?"*  

Just as Gu Yuan was engrossed, the fourth jade slip dimmed abruptly, cutting off the flow of information.  

The fourth slip contained only the name of a seal—nothing more.  

"Why is this?"  

Gu Yuan sent his spiritual sense back into the slip, but it remained empty.  

"Yun Hanxiu praised this seal in her manual, so she must have known its details. Why is the key information missing now that it’s in my hands?"  

"Could this seal possess some unique property that made her erase its secrets, unwilling to let others obtain it?"  

Holding the slip, Gu Yuan pondered deeply.  

He had been quite intrigued by the seal mentioned in Yun Hanxiu’s manual, only to be left with nothing.  

But he quickly composed himself and dismissed further speculation.  

Destroying valuable techniques was standard practice for bandit cultivators. After all, profound methods weren’t meant to be shared lightly, and bandits lived with their heads perpetually at risk.  

If they died and their possessions fell into others’ hands, wouldn’t that be infuriating? Naturally, they’d minimize any "aid to their killers."  

"Though it’s a shame, the overall haul should still be enough to sustain my cultivation until the ninth level of Qi Refining..."
