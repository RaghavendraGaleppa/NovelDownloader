# Chapter 42: Spiritual Power Examination

The reason no one sought Gu Mo's help was simple. The principle of the Cleansing Technique relied on spiritual power vibrations to achieve marrow cleansing and meridian purification. Since each person's constitution differed, achieving optimal results required subtle adjustments based on the target's physical condition.

This meant Gu Mo would gain complete insight into the target's body—something no cultivator would willingly expose to outsiders.

Yet here stood an exception: an inner sect senior sister. Gu Mo wondered if she understood the consequences of requesting a perfected Cleansing Technique from someone else.

"I know as much about the Cleansing Technique as you do," Yuan Niya said, her fingers tightly gripping her robe's hem to mask her inner turmoil. She fully understood that allowing Gu Mo to perform the technique would expose her body's secrets.

But surpassing her inner sect peers was her goal, and marrow cleansing through the perfected Cleansing Technique offered the highest cost-to-benefit ratio. Unfortunately, she hadn't mastered the technique herself, nor could she ask inner sect seniors who had—they were competitors. Exposing her weaknesses to rivals was unthinkable, and those seniors wouldn't willingly strengthen a competitor.

Gu Mo was different. As an outer sect disciple, he posed no competitive threat and would be easier to control. The price for his help wouldn't be exorbitant. Compared to gaining strength, what did it matter if he learned her secrets?

Born a commoner, Yuan Niya had been ostracized since childhood for her black-and-red hair. Even her parents treated her coldly, and others bullied her relentlessly. This fueled her desperate yearning for strength—only power could shield her from abuse.

"Help me, and I'll compensate you," she said, steadying her breathing. "Name your price—spirit stones, pills, magical artifacts?"

Truthfully, Gu Mo preferred to maintain his low-profile farming and cultivation. But the determination in Yuan Niya's eyes told him refusal wasn't an option. A female cultivator willing to expose her body to a male for marrow cleansing had clearly made up her mind.

What could he say? He never imagined a cultivator would prioritize strength over bodily secrecy.

"Fine," Gu Mo conceded, rubbing his temples. "I'll help. Forget spirit stones or artifacts—just lend me aid when I'm in need later."

He knew inner sect disciples like her had no shortage of resources, which he could acquire through farming anyway. Her favor would be far more valuable.

"Deal!" Yuan Niya agreed instantly. An inner sect disciple assisting an outer sect one would require minimal effort.

"Follow me."

Gu Mo dispelled the illusion array around his spirit field and beckoned her inside. With his Sunflowers and Peashooters stored safely in his dark mist space, he had nothing to hide.

Yuan Niya followed without hesitation. Though newly advanced to Qi Refinement, she was confident she could defeat three Gu Mos—his mastery of the perfected Cleansing Technique made him stronger than average outer sect disciples. Against ordinary ones, she could take ten.

Besides, who would dare attack an inner sect disciple within the sect? That would be suicide.

Her thirst for strength didn't override her caution—she'd assessed the risks thoroughly before coming.

"Senior Sister, let's be clear," Gu Mo said as they entered the field's side hut. "I'll perform the marrow cleansing, but you can't reveal my involvement."

Inner sect privileges came with intense competition. All disciples vied to stand out and become True Disciples of Green Dew Sect—a title that brought resources, eligibility for sect leadership, and even core formation materials.

With Gu Mo's perfected technique enhancing her foundation, Yuan Niya would become a formidable rival. If others learned he'd helped, they might target him instead—bullying an outer sect disciple was far easier than challenging an inner sect peer.

"And you can't tell anyone I received your perfected Cleansing Technique!" Yuan Niya interjected, reclaiming what she meant to say first.

Gu Mo wanted secrecy; so did she. Exposure would tarnish her reputation. While strength could silence gossip, discretion was preferable.

"Then let's begin."

After their pact, Gu Mo gestured for her to sit. He took her hand—physical contact was necessary to assess her body and determine the ideal vibration frequency. Future sessions wouldn't require touch.

"Alright."

Yuan Niya's anticipation mingled with unease, but her desire for strength eclipsed all else.

A soft gasp escaped her as Gu Mo's spiritual power flowed into her. Its warmth soothed her fire-aligned meridians.

"Continue," she urged when she noticed his glance.

Gu Mo guided the vibrating energy through her body. Soon, his brow furrowed slightly. His gaze flickered imperceptibly toward her chest—the spiritual feedback indicated its actual size differed from appearances.

"Ah."

Understanding dawned, but Yuan Niya's clenched fists warned him she'd noticed his observation. Under spiritual examination, no disguise could endure.

Gu Mo feigned ignorance and continued. Suddenly, Yuan Niya tensed, her face flushing. Realizing where his energy had reached, beads of sweat formed on Gu Mo's forehead—would she lash out?

He hurriedly redirected the flow downward. Only then did her muscles relax. Both knew what had transpired, but neither spoke a word.
