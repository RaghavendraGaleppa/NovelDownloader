# Chapter 29: Purple-Striped Burrow Scorpions  

Seeing this, Qin Chong no longer concealed his strength. His aura surged violently, revealing his true cultivation at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement.  

The sudden display shocked his opponent, but Qin Chong didn’t give him time to react. With a mental command, a buzzing sound filled the air as a massive swarm of Sky-Soaring Ants erupted forth, forming a dark cloud that instantly engulfed both the man and his Armored Earth Beast.  

The man didn’t even have time to scream before his life was extinguished—body and soul utterly annihilated.  

Qin Chong was stunned. The Devouring Sky-Soaring Ants were far more terrifying than he had imagined. In mere moments, a sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator and a mid-tier first-rank Armored Earth Beast had been reduced to nothing.  

This was the first time Qin Chong had witnessed such a scene—one he himself had caused. The shock in his heart was indescribable.  

After a brief hesitation, Qin Chong retrieved the storage pouch and spirit beast pouch left behind, then swiftly fled in the direction he had come from. This was no place to linger. Regardless of who the slain cultivator had been, staying in this area was far too dangerous.  

As he ran, the horrifying image of the ants devouring everything replayed relentlessly in his mind.  

Gradually, however, Qin Chong calmed down and began analyzing the situation.  

Individually, the Sky-Soaring Ants hadn’t even reached the early first-rank level, yet their collective power was unexpectedly devastating. Still, the instant kill had been possible not just because of the ants’ ferocity, but also due to the opponent’s fatal mistake.  

The man had detected Qin Chong’s aura and assumed he was merely a third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator—an easy target given the three-layer gap and the bottleneck between them. Overconfidence had blinded him.  

He never expected Qin Chong to suddenly reveal his true seventh-layer cultivation, surpassing him by a minor realm. The psychological shock and hesitation cost him dearly. Had he immediately activated a defensive artifact or conjured a protective shield, the Sky-Soaring Ants might not have succeeded so easily.  

At the very least, he could have bought himself time to escape. Fire-based spells, the natural weakness of flying insects, were basic techniques any cultivator could use. But in his panic, the man had faltered—and paid the ultimate price.  

---  

Though Qin Chong had annihilated his enemy in an instant, he couldn’t shake off a lingering unease.  

He realized now that the Devouring Sky-Soaring Ants were a weapon to be used sparingly—only in true life-or-death situations. Revealing them carelessly would invite disaster, especially in the presence of others. They were his trump card, not something to be flaunted.  

After several hours of nonstop travel, Qin Chong finally stopped in a distant area, far from the previous encounter. He quickly set up his Five-Element Concealment Array and hid within it.  

The dead man’s storage pouch contained little of value. After a thorough search, Qin Chong found no clues to his identity, suggesting he was likely a rogue cultivator. The only notable loot was a little over a hundred spirit stones and a mid-grade flying sword artifact.  

Yet something about the situation felt off.  

Newcomers to the mining area, like himself, were usually briefed on the rules. Why had the man immediately tried to kill him upon sight? Was he not from this mining zone?  

The Cangwu Mountain Range lay at the border between Pingyang and Pingchuan Counties, where the territories of the Canglong Valley and Qingxuan Sect intersected. Could this man have been from Pingchuan County—or worse, a plant by the Qingxuan Sect?  

Though Qin Chong entertained many possibilities, he knew raising suspicions without proof would only invite trouble. After the incident with the mid-grade spirit stones that drew the attention of Foundation Establishment cultivators, he had learned to avoid unnecessary attention.  

*The tallest tree catches the wind.*  

In the end, he decided to let it go. If trouble arose, the Foundation Establishment experts could handle it. He would simply avoid that area from now on. The mine’s labyrinthine tunnels offered plenty of other places to search for resources.  

Once his mana had fully recovered, Qin Chong set off in a different direction to continue his search for collection points.  

---  

Over a month passed without incident. Then, one day, as Qin Chong was returning to the surface through a side tunnel, he stumbled upon an unexpected scene upon entering a main passage.  

The passage here was over ten feet wide—spacious by mining tunnel standards.  

Three or four cultivators were locked in a desperate battle against a demonic beast, clearly outmatched as they fought a retreating action, attempting to lure the creature toward the main tunnel.  

---  

*Purple-Striped Burrow Scorpions!*  

And not just one—three of them, all at the late first-rank stage. No wonder the four cultivators were struggling.  

Each scorpion measured over ten feet long from pincers to tail. Their massive claws were powerful, and their venomous stingers carried deadly poison. But the most dangerous trait was the pale blue flames they could spew.  

One cultivator, caught off guard, failed to retract his artifact in time. A mid-grade flying sword was engulfed in the flames and visibly melted within seconds, rendered completely useless.  

"Don’t engage! Fall back! Lure them to the surface—we can’t handle three of these things!" shouted a seventh-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.  

A sudden scream pierced the air as a sixth-layer cultivator was struck by a stinger. His legs gave out instantly, his face turning purple. Within moments, he was foaming at the mouth—dead.  

The remaining fighters, already at a disadvantage, were now in even graver peril. Yet they had no choice but to keep retreating.  

In the confined tunnels, cultivators couldn’t fly, making them far slower than the scorpions. Turning to flee would only hasten their deaths.  

Qin Chong suppressed his aura and held his breath, hiding near a tunnel junction. He dared not reveal himself—these beasts were too powerful.  

Even if he exposed his true strength, joining the fight likely wouldn’t turn the tide—unless he summoned the Devouring Sky-Soaring Ants. But was it worth revealing his greatest trump card for strangers?  

The sounds of battle grew distant as more cultivators seemed to join the fray, yet the situation remained dire. Eventually, the scorpions and fighters moved too far for Qin Chong to sense them.  

Only then did he emerge, cautiously following the path. Along the way, he passed three or four corpses and picked up two abandoned storage pouches.  

It might not have been the most honorable act, but if he didn’t take them, someone else would.  

*All for one, and one for all. No sense leaving them behind.*
