# Chapter 15: Spiritual Root Testing Ceremony! Undercurrents at Play!

At night, a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Yellow Maple Valley sought out Lu Yunfeng.  

Seeing this Foundation Establishment cultivator, Lu Yunfeng's face lit up with joy.  

"Yunfeng pays respects to Uncle Wang!"  

"Enough, our families have been friends for generations—no need for such formalities," the middle-aged man at mid-Foundation Establishment waved his hand warmly.  

Aside from their familial ties, this warmth was also due to Lu Yunfeng's exceptional talent, making him worth investing in and befriending.  

"Yunfeng, this is the top-tier magic tool, the Azure Dragon Banner, which your Lu family commissioned me to refine for you within the sect. Take good care of it." The man flipped his palm, revealing a small, exquisitely crafted banner glowing with a faint azure light.  

Lu Yunfeng's face lit up with excitement as he reverently accepted it with both hands, a sickly smile creeping onto his face.  

"Lin Yun! Damnable Lin Yun! Let's see how you die this time!"  

"Keh keh keh keh—"  

"With this Azure Dragon Banner, I'll tear you to pieces!" Lu Yunfeng muttered hatefully.  

The next day, as the time approached, Lin Yun and Han Li prepared to attend the Spiritual Root Testing Ceremony.  

Indeed, this Immortal Ascension Assembly actually included a Spiritual Root Testing Ceremony. When Lin Yun first heard about it, he found it strange—he didn’t recall such a thing in the novel he had read in his past life, though the anime adaptation did feature this plot.  

But never mind. He didn’t dwell on it. Since he was here, he might as well go along with it.  

The Tai Nan Mountain Pagoda was the designated location for the spiritual root testing.  

In reality, this test wouldn’t determine much. Even if one’s spiritual roots were poor, it wouldn’t affect their participation in the Immortal Ascension Assembly’s competition.  

After all, the assembly tested combat prowess, not innate talent.  

However, the purpose of testing spiritual roots was simply to scout for hidden talents and poach gifted rogue cultivators.  

The vast expanse of the Yue Kingdom made it impossible for the Seven Great Sects to personally test every individual’s spiritual roots. Thus, it was entirely possible for a Heaven Spiritual Root genius to be hiding among the common folk.  

Over a century ago, during the Immortal Ascension Assembly, the Veiled Moon Sect had struck gold—a rogue cultivator named Nangong Wan, possessing a Heaven Spiritual Root, had emerged as a standout during the spiritual root testing.  

The other six sects had been green with envy.  

In previous years, there had been occasional cases of outstanding dual spiritual roots, so the Spiritual Root Testing Ceremony remained a matter of great importance to the seven sects.  

This ceremony would yield two possible outcomes.  

First, those with superior spiritual roots—dual spiritual roots, mutated spiritual roots, Heaven Spiritual Roots, or special physiques—would be granted direct entry into any of the seven sects, regardless of their current cultivation level.  

However, those who joined this way would not receive a Foundation Establishment Pill.  

Only those with Heaven Spiritual Roots, mutated spiritual roots, or special physiques that greatly aided cultivation would be exempt from the Immortal Ascension Assembly and directly awarded a Foundation Establishment Pill.  

The second outcome applied to those with inferior spiritual roots—triple spiritual roots or even false spiritual roots.  

For them, joining the seven sects required surviving the life-and-death battles of the Immortal Ascension Assembly. The final victors would be granted entry and awarded a Foundation Establishment Pill.  

This was the sects’ way of rewarding cultivators skilled in combat.  

Soon, nearly everyone had gathered at the Tai Nan Mountain Pagoda.  

After passing through a shimmering azure spiritual barrier, Lin Yun and Han Li entered the pagoda.  

By the time they arrived, the place was already packed.  

Among the crowd was the "Senior Brother Lu" who had previously clashed with Lin Yun and Han Li.  

On the highest viewing platform sat the Core Formation elders dispatched by the seven sects.  

"Fellow cultivators, this assembly is presided over by our Veiled Moon Sect. Before the Immortal Ascension Assembly begins, we will first conduct spiritual root testing. Those with outstanding spiritual roots will be granted entry into one of the seven sects. Those who do not qualify due to their spiritual roots need not despair—there will still be the arena battles later. The victors will receive rewards from the sects as well as entry qualifications."  

The Veiled Moon Sect’s representative was a woman in light blue palace robes, her face veiled. Both her attire and veil had the effect of blocking spiritual sense, making it impossible for anyone to discern her true appearance.  

"That elder seems incredibly young," Han Li remarked, glancing at Nangong Wan. Though her face was obscured, her youthful bearing was unmistakable.  

"She’s at the Core Formation stage! It’s best not to even meet her gaze. If you accidentally provoke her, even I won’t be able to save you," Lin Yun whispered to Han Li.  

"A new face," the Core Formation elders from the other six sects observed the Veiled Moon elder with curiosity.  

"The Veiled Moon Sect truly has an abundance of talent—they’ve quietly produced another Core Formation cultivator."  

"To reach Core Formation so quickly without our knowledge… it must be that rogue cultivator from a century ago, Nangong Wan."  

"Let’s hope there are some promising talents among the rogue cultivators this time. Otherwise, this trip would’ve been for nothing."  

The elders from the six sects each had their own thoughts.  

Only the elders from Yellow Maple Valley and the Clear Void Sect were whispering to each other, their gazes occasionally sweeping over the crowd of rogue cultivators below.  

"Daoist Li, it’s been a while. How about we make another wager? Let’s see whether more people choose my Clear Void Sect or your Yellow Maple Valley. What do you say?"  

Since the subsequent Immortal Ascension Assembly allocated ten spots per sect, the Clear Void elder’s proposal clearly referred to the voluntary choices of those who excelled in the spiritual root testing.  

"Hmph! You old fraud, trying to swindle me again? No bet!" The Yellow Maple Valley elder refused outright.  

Meanwhile, the Veiled Moon elder finished speaking and flicked her sleeve, sending five spiritual orbs into the air.  

These orbs would display different colors based on the spiritual roots of those who channeled their spiritual power into them.  

The first to step forward were Chen Qiaoqian and another woman in pink robes.  

After taking the orbs, both displayed the same colors.  

"Dong Xuan’er, water-wood dual spiritual roots—qualified!"  

"Chen Qiaoqian, water-wood dual spiritual roots—qualified!"  

Seeing that her spiritual roots matched Chen Qiaoqian’s, Dong Xuan’er shot her a glare. It was precisely because of this similarity that she was constantly compared to her.  

"Look at Chen Qiaoqian from the Chen family—she has the same water-wood dual spiritual roots as you, yet you act as if yours are something special!"  

Chen Qiaoqian ignored Dong Xuan’er, casually tossing the orb back before returning to her place.  

Soon, the competition for the orbs grew fierce.  

In truth, there was no real need for such a scramble—anyone who wanted to test could simply wait until others were done.  

But this was akin to checking exam results in his past life. Even though the scores would eventually be announced, many couldn’t resist the urge to peek early or ask the teacher beforehand.  

Moreover, this was a test of spiritual roots—if one’s results were outstanding, securing entry into a major sect would be a point of pride. Thus, the competition was intense.  

The fiercest struggle was between the pink-robed woman and a staff-wielding female cultivator. Both had even summoned their magic tools.  

In the end, the pink-robed woman gained the upper hand, knocking her opponent down.  

Just as she was about to deliver a fatal blow, the Veiled Moon elder intervened.  

"Competition for the orbs is permitted, but no killing!"  

Meanwhile, Han Li, standing beside Lin Yun, couldn’t understand why these people were fighting so fiercely. Frowning, he subtly retreated behind the crowd.  

But when he stepped back from the front, he realized Lin Yun had already beaten him to it—waiting calmly at the rear.
