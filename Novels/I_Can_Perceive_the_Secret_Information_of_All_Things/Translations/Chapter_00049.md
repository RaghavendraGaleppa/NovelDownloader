# Chapter 49: On Days Like These, Big Brother Has Something to Tell You  

"These demons must have studied military tactics!"  

Xiao Ji stood outside the cave, having already discerned the plans of the demons inside.  

Earlier, after analyzing their combat capabilities, he realized that with his current peak Qi Refining cultivation, he could easily overpower the demons in the cave. His strategy was simple: kill them one by one, or two by two if necessary.  

Even if the two groups of demons united against him, he wouldn’t care—especially since they were already scheming to betray each other to save their own skins.  

Xiao Ji quickly assessed their tactics and decided to strike first.  

Admittedly, the human-form pills refined by the demons were quite effective. The bear demon had transformed into an unusually burly yet delicate-looking woman.  

The Feather Nest Master pressed a bone spear against the "woman’s" back.  

The scene was hard to describe as coercion.  

"Listen up, Taoist," the Feather Nest Master called out from behind the fake woman. "I’ve got a hostage here. Let me go, and I’ll spare her."  

"Help me~" The bear demon actually whimpered in a frail woman’s voice, sending shivers down the spine.  

Compared to its earlier impersonation of an immortal master, this performance was outright terrible. No one would feel compelled to rescue such a sight—most wouldn’t even want to look twice.  

Xiao Ji simply drew his sword.  

**"Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet Gold Sword Art"**—activated.  

A violet light erupted from his blade, instantly transforming the surroundings. Dark clouds churned overhead, trees trembled violently, and even Song Yuanbao, who had been hiding in a tree, was shaken to the ground.  

Amidst the dazzling sword energy, a concentrated violet slash sliced through the giant "woman’s" neck before shattering the boulder engraved with the words **"Frenzied Demon Cave."**  

The bear’s massive head rolled across the ground, coming to a stop half a zhang away from the eagle demon.  

Seeing his newly sworn brother decapitated, the Feather Nest Master flew into a rage.  

"Attack together!"  

The avian demons of the Flying Feather Gang reacted first, taking to the skies, while the other demons from the Frenzied Demon Cave bared their fangs and assumed battle stances.  

But none of them moved.  

The Feather Nest Master unleashed his ultimate technique.  

Three **Yellow-grade Feather Demon Artifacts** shot from his body, circling Xiao Ji under his mental command.  

At the same time, he executed the **"Molting Eagle Strike."**  

Despite its laughably crude name, Xiao Ji already knew the details of this demonic technique.  

In essence, the demon plucked all its feathers, each one transforming into a fierce eagle to attack the target.  

The Feather Nest Master’s technique was no joke—after all, he was a **first-rank, tenth-tier demon.**  

His feathers swirled in the air, morphing into countless sharp-winged eagles that blotted out the sky as they dove toward the Taoist below.  

"Swish—"  

Xiao Ji’s sword danced, weaving a violet barrier around himself. The sound of clashing feathers against energy filled the air.  

Moments later, the barrier was surrounded by black eagle feathers burning with violet flames.  

The Feather Nest Master felt cold.  

The chill came from two things: the overwhelming power of the Taoist, and the unfamiliar sensation of being featherless.  

He now looked like a plucked chicken.  

"That… might have been a misunderstanding," the Feather Nest Master stammered.  

But he wouldn’t get another chance.  

The Taoist’s sword moved again.  

A surge of violet energy swept through the battlefield, annihilating every demon in its path.  

The Feather Nest Master, being an eagle, was naturally adept at fleeing.  

Yet he soon realized a problem—without feathers, an eagle couldn’t fly fast.  

In fact, he could feel just how sluggish his movements had become.  

Another flash of sword light.  

An eagle’s head tumbled to the ground, rolling a few times before settling beside the bear’s.  

"Big Brother, you’re here," the bear’s head greeted, not yet at rest.  

"Just keeping you company," the eagle’s head replied, its beak moving weakly.  

"If I had been able to use my **Mountain-Lifting Technique**, that Taoist wouldn’t have stood a chance," the bear demon muttered, glancing disdainfully at Xiao Ji.  

"What’s the point of saying that now?" the eagle demon sighed. "If I had gone all out, I might not have ended up like this either."  

The two heads continued their conversation, oblivious to the chaos around them.  

Xiao Ji’s sword never stopped, cutting down the remaining demons without mercy.  

Song Yuanbao joined the fight, pummeling the weaker demons with his fists.  

"On days like these, Big Brother has something to tell you," the Feather Nest Master said earnestly.  

"Speak quickly, while you still can," the bear demon urged.  

"Second Brother, the truth is… the spirit stones I brought were all fake. I haggled with you just to ease your suspicions," the eagle demon confessed. "When my Flying Feather Gang went down the mountain this spring, we were ambushed by the local authorities. They were waiting for us to emerge after winter. Our finances are in ruins—the men I brought today were all I had left."  

The bear demon sighed. "Big Brother, don’t blame yourself. To be honest, I never planned to trade fairly either. I was going to take the stones, betray you, leave the Frenzied Demon Cave, and then sell the human children to another faction for double the profit."  

The mountain wind howled through the trees, carrying the scent of blood across the wilderness.  

"How touching!" Xiao Ji wiped his eyes, which had been irritated by the wind, then cleaned his bloodstained sword before sheathing it.  

A moment later.  

"Ptooey!" The eagle’s head spat at the bear’s head.  

"Ptooey!" The bear’s head retaliated.  

The two engaged in their final battle—a contest of spiteful spitting.  

Xiao Ji left them to their farewells and walked over to the bear demon’s body to retrieve its gallbladder.  

"Second Brother, the Taoist is taking your gallbladder," the Feather Nest Master said, glancing sideways. "Gotta admit, you really had guts."  

A while later.  

"Big Brother, the Taoist is digging out your demon core," the bear demon remarked, also looking over.  

Did any of that matter now? No.  

Their lives were nearly over—why worry about such things? Better to focus on the present.  

"Ptooey!"  

"Ptooey!"  

Their voices grew weaker.  

With the task complete, Xiao Ji and Song Yuanbao descended the mountain, rejoining the constables and the rescued children on their way back to Willow Town.  

How the children would be returned to their families was the local authorities’ concern—Xiao Ji didn’t need to think about it.  

After a few steps, Song Yuanbao suddenly remembered something.  

He asked Xiao Ji to accompany him back into the mountains.  

After securing a promise of extra payment, Xiao Ji agreed.  

Soon, he understood the square-faced constable’s goal.  

There was still one overseas demon left alive—hanging from a tree.  

Song Yuanbao intended to deliver the koala demon to the county’s Demon Suppression Division, where it would be sent to Dragon City for study… and to let his colleagues marvel at it.  

So, they captured it alive.  

On the way back, the koala demon woke up.  

Realizing it had been taken prisoner—tied to a pole and carried by humans—it panicked.  

**"This is terrifying! I better go back to sleep to calm my nerves."**
