# Chapter 20: Soul Lamp Verification!

“You little bastard, why aren't you running anymore?” Zhou Yi roared into Zhou Tian's ear, spitting saliva all over his face, as he lifted him like a little chick.

His figure blurred, and Zhou Tian teleported again, slipping out of Zhou Yi's grasp and reappearing beside him. Ignoring Zhou Yi's furious glare, Zhou Tian turned to Qin Di and asked, “Uncle, what is the meaning of this?”

In Qin Di's eyes, countless rune combinations regenerated, profoundly abstruse, yet he still couldn't comprehend what kind of technique it was. Hearing Zhou Tian's words, his captivating gaze shifted to Zhou Tian, and he murmured, “Are you still Zhou Tian?”

Zhou Tian's heart skipped a beat at these words, but before he could reply, Zhou Yi hastily asked, “Brother, do you mean...?”

“Second Brother, don't rush. You and I both know Tian'er's physique perfectly well, but look at the divine ability he displayed today; even I can't comprehend it.” Qin Di slowly stood up, his aura like that of an ancient deity, as he looked at Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian's trigeminal nerve was throbbing with excruciating pain right now. This was precisely why he was reluctant to expose his abnormalities too early; these people were seasoned old foxes, and explanations would be difficult. After a moment's thought, Zhou Tian said, “Of course, I'm Zhou Tian. I always have been.”

“Then how do you possess such a divine ability?” As Qin Di spoke, a series of secret orders were issued by him, spreading to various hidden corners within the imperial palace. Countless hidden techniques enveloped the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

“This is all the result of my diligent training, where my spirit controls my body, transcending physical limits!” Zhou Tian's gaze was firm.

“Can you tell me how you trained?” Qin Di asked.

“One hundred push-ups, one hundred squats, and one hundred sit-ups every day!” Zhou Tian said earnestly. This wasn't nonsense; it had a verifiable basis. In his previous life, there was a bald man who became incredibly powerful through this very method.

Qin Di's body stiffened, and a strange expression appeared on his face. At that moment, a message entered his mind from the void. A golden light flashed in his eyes, runes flickered in his hand, and he raised his palm, reaching for Zhou Tian. No matter what was going on, he decided to seize him first; there would be ways to verify later.

A majestic qi aura locked onto Zhou Tian. Outside the Hall of Mental Cultivation, dozens of people had already gathered, setting up a complex grand formation, sealing the entire hall.

Zhou Tian felt as if an ancient divine mountain was hurtling towards him, a terrifying pressure enveloping his entire body, as if there was nowhere to hide. But it was only "as if." Zhou Tian casually chose a spot, instantly teleporting there, breaking free from Qin Di's lock.

“I really am Zhou Tian! I haven't been body-seized by anyone!” Zhou Tian explained with a helpless expression.

What kind of technique was this?! Qin Di was utterly frustrated. The entire Hall of Mental Cultivation had been sealed by a powerful formation, yet how could he still move?!

“You say you're Zhou Tian, but I need to verify that.” Qin Di's entire body's energy settled down. For now, he couldn't find a way to control Zhou Tian. He *could* kill him directly before Zhou Tian could react, but that didn't align with his objective.

“How do you verify?” Zhou Tian was slightly startled. Could they really verify if he was the original person? That powerful? However, he didn't show any unusual expression on his face.

“Soul Lamp Verification!” Qin Di stated.

“Soul Lamp Verification?” Zhou Tian's face was full of confusion. What in the world was that?

“That's right. A Soul Lamp is made from a wisp of your innate qi at birth, combined with complex crafting methods. It's connected to your divine soul origin, and through a special method, it can merge with your divine soul, provided you are still Zhou Tian.” Qin Di explained, then threw out a golden token, speaking to the void, “Go and retrieve Zhou Tian's Soul Lamp!”

The golden token vanished into the void. Someone had received the imperial decree and was carrying it out. How could the formations set up within the imperial palace restrict the emperor? To ensure the emperor's decrees were executed as swiftly as possible, the formations naturally contained backdoors usable only by insiders!

The room fell silent. Qin Di's expression was placid, Zhou Yi's gaze was complex, and Tian Ling looked at Zhou Tian with a worried expression, a layer of mist clouding her crystalline eyes. Zhou Tian gave her a reassuring look, signaling her not to worry.

Time passed, minute by minute. Half an incense stick later, the doors of the Hall of Mental Cultivation opened, and a middle-aged man with entirely white hair and beard walked in. Dressed in purple robes, he held a glazed golden lamp in his right hand. Inside the lamp, a small flame burned without any fuel, simply floating there and flickering.

Seeing the middle-aged man, Zhou Yi and Qin Di simultaneously stepped forward, speaking respectfully, “Elder Zhan!”

Qin Di then took another step forward, supporting the white-haired middle-aged man, and whispered, “Why have you come in person, honored one!”

Elder Zhan chuckled, “Soul Lamp verification isn't that simple. I wasn't entirely at ease leaving it to my subordinates. Besides, I wanted to see the person who made the Soul Lamp reignite.”

Zhou Tian's heart stirred. *Soul Lamp reignited?* That meant it had extinguished before. It must have been when his divine soul was attacked. He hadn't expected them to have such a method, capable of detecting a person's life and death!

Seeing Elder Zhan turn his gaze towards him, Zhou Tian also mimicked Zhou Yi and Qin Di's manner, saying, “Elder Zhan!”

Elder Zhan nodded, saying, “So it's that boy with the hundred unopenable orifices. Is Soul Lamp verification even necessary for this? Who would seize such a body?”

“@*!” Zhou Tian smiled outwardly, but inwardly he cursed, *'What's wrong with my body? My body's perfectly proportioned!'*

Qin Di gave a wry smile. “Elder Zhan, it's not that simple.” He then turned to Zhou Tian and said, “Zhou Tian, perform that technique you just used again!”

"............" Zhou Tian was speechless. He casually picked a spot and instantly teleported. Since the grand formation outside hadn't been removed and time was still sealed, this time it was still a karmic technique: arriving at the destination was the "effect," reversing cause and effect, the effect preceding the cause!

*Boom!* A monstrous aura erupted. Elder Zhan's qi and blood surged skyward, the sun and moon dimly appearing behind him. Two divine lights, sharp as immortal swords, shot from his eyes, piercing through space. Outside, all the elders who had layered seals upon this area spat out mouthfuls of blood mixed with golden threads, and the grand formation shattered!

“Karma!” Elder Zhan uttered two words, shaking the void. Cracks appeared, and golden runes flickered, struggling to stabilize the space.

Qin Di's eyes widened in astonishment. A karmic technique! No wonder he couldn't discern what kind of method it was; that was a rule even Great Emperors found hard to touch, yet Zhou Tian...

“Come here!” Elder Zhan extended his palm, and abstruse fluctuations enveloped Zhou Tian. There was a problem! A *big* problem! This was the Rule of Karma; Zhou Tian definitely had an issue, perhaps truly having been body-seized!

Feeling the confining power around him, Zhou Tian secretly shook his head. *'Coming out to show off without knowing your limits, you're just asking for trouble.'*

His figure blurred! Zhou Tian vanished from his original spot once more.

Now it was Elder Zhan's turn to be dumbfounded. He had also used a karmic technique to restrain Zhou Tian! Zhou Tian had no cultivation, so even if he could manipulate karma, he couldn't possibly be stronger than him. How could he still break through space and move?
