# Chapter 60: Second Uncle's Reply and Qi Chan'er

"Finally, I've achieved the second layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body—Crystal Bone Realm!"

As the words before his eyes slowly dissipated, Qi Chuan revealed a faint smile before standing up. Water droplets slid down his fair skin while the crystalline glow emanating from his bones gradually faded.

Clenching his fist, Qi Chuan could feel the explosive power now hidden within his body.

"With my current physical strength alone, I should be able to match an ordinary mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator or a mid-tier first-grade demonic beast."

The second layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body didn't just strengthen his bones—it brought about a comprehensive enhancement to his skin, flesh, internal organs, and more. Now, every movement Qi Chuan made carried the might of a mid-grade magical artifact. Even a slightly fragile mid-grade defensive artifact could be shattered with a single punch.

Glancing at the now-clear medicinal water in the large vat beneath him, Qi Chuan stepped out. As he did, a ripple of spiritual energy surged from his dantian. Flames and water intertwined across his body, steam rising as he dried himself effortlessly before dressing.

"To cultivate the second layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body, I've used eight large medicinal packages over the past six months. Each package costs 150 low-grade spirit stones—1,200 in total. Body cultivation truly is a spirit stone-devouring beast!"

To put it into perspective, 1,200 low-grade spirit stones could buy a decent top-grade magical artifact.

"I wonder how many spirit stones will be needed to cultivate the third layer?" Qi Chuan rubbed his temples in frustration.

The Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body had six layers in total, with the first three corresponding to first-grade body cultivators and Qi Refinement practitioners. The third layer, however, was fundamentally different from the first two. Once mastered, the body's resilience would rival that of a high-quality upper-grade artifact. And if perfected to its limit, his physical form could match even the finest top-grade artifacts, with power capable of making even tenth-level Qi Refinement cultivators wary.

But with such terrifying power came an equally staggering cost in spirit stones.

"Thankfully, I'm now a first-grade upper-tier talisman master. I can earn spirit stones by crafting and selling talismans. Otherwise, the third layer would be beyond my reach." Qi Chuan couldn't imagine relying solely on inner sect missions to accumulate such wealth.

"Disciple Qi Chuan of the inner sect, are you in your cave abode?"

Just as Qi Chuan was contemplating the third layer, a voice echoed from outside his cave.

---

"Someone's looking for me?" Qi Chuan was surprised before making his way to the entrance.

Outside the formation shielding his cave stood a figure dressed in the robes of a Fengyue Sect steward. Upon seeing Qi Chuan, the steward spoke, "A letter from your family."

Ah, someone from the Internal Affairs Hall.

Understanding the situation, Qi Chuan opened the formation and approached, accepting both the letter and a small pouch from the steward. He then discreetly handed over a few low-grade spirit stones.

The steward's previously indifferent expression brightened at the offering. After exchanging a few pleasantries, he departed.

This was simply how things worked with the Internal Affairs Hall—small "gifts" were expected. These stewards held varying ranks, most being former inner or outer sect disciples of the Fengyue Sect. If Qi Chuan failed to advance to the core disciple rank and exceeded his time limit in the inner sect, he too might end up as a steward—albeit one of higher status than those who had been outer disciples.

Once the steward left, Qi Chuan reactivated the formation and returned inside. Retrieving the letter, he began reading.

"Ah-Chuan, how are you faring in the Fengyue Sect's inner sect? What level have you reached in your cultivation? Have you found a cultivation partner you fancy?..."

"I've taken several of the Black Jade Renewal Pills you sent. After this period of recovery, the two slightly damaged meridians in my body have almost fully healed. Tears in my eyes, Ah-Chuan—your Second Uncle is deeply moved..."

"Oh, I've also sent some spirit fruits I grew myself. They might not be high-grade, and you might not think much of them, but they're quite tasty. Consider it as if your Second Uncle is still by your side. You should visit Red Maple Valley sometime—I'll cook up a feast for you..."

A smile tugged at Qi Chuan's lips as he finished the letter.

"Second Uncle hasn't changed a bit... But it's good that his meridian issues are resolved. It seems the Black Jade Renewal Pills made from mid-grade Black Jade Spirit Snake gallbladders were effective. Hopefully, with his meridians restored, he can reach the fourth level of Qi Refinement in his lifetime."

Qi Chuan murmured to himself before opening the small pouch. Inside were an assortment of spirit fruits—each variety in small quantities, clearly a sampling from Second Uncle's personal orchard. Some were new additions, likely planted in recent years.

Picking up a green-hued fruit, Qi Chuan tossed it lightly, cleansed it with conjured water, and took a bite.

"Pfft—this is way too sour!" His expression twisted after a couple of chews. Second Uncle had certainly picked the most... distinctive fruits.

Still, he didn't spit it out. Given his current physique, even ten times the sourness would be nothing. He finished the fruit before selecting a vibrant red one. A sweet, refreshing flavor burst across his tongue, carrying a faint spiritual essence.

"Mmm, this one's quite good." Nodding in approval, Qi Chuan realized Second Uncle had deliberately chosen the most unique fruits from his orchard.

After sampling two, Qi Chuan stored the rest carefully in his cave, planning to enjoy them slowly over time.

"Speaking of which..."

The letter from Red Maple Valley reminded Qi Chuan of another member of the Qi family—Qi Chan'er. Since their mission in Cloudrise Mountain Range nearly two years ago, they hadn't met, though they had exchanged letters occasionally, maintaining a distant connection.

Qi Chuan had long considered transcribing a copy of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body for her. After all, his acquisition of both the cultivation method and the talisman treasure had been indirectly aided by her. However, he hadn't found a suitable pretext to offer it.

Perhaps he should just send it without overthinking—better than letting the matter linger in his mind.
