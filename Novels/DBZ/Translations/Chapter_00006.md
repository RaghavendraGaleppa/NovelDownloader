# Chapter 6: Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword

They say good things never come in pairs, but today, Wei Qian encountered not one, but two strokes of good fortune.

The first was naturally breaking through the bottleneck that had troubled him. Now, as long as he continued his cultivation step by step, reaching the peak of the second level of Qi Refining was just around the corner.

The second came from Old Man Li.

After drinking all five jars of Wei Qian's "Clear Spirit Brew," Old Man Li came to inspect the growth of the "Jade Crystal Rice" in the fields today and called Wei Qian over to impart some extra knowledge.

"To judge the growth of Jade Crystal Rice, the most important thing is..."

"When Jade Crystal Rice matures, it attracts pests. There are mainly three methods to deal with these pests, two of which are..."

"Spiritual fields also produce weeds that compete with the spiritual rice for spiritual energy and must be removed. However, these weeds absorb faint spiritual energy, have well-developed root systems, and are much more tenacious than ordinary weeds. They must be eradicated using the spell 'Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword.'"

"This is because the Metal element governs destruction and can completely eliminate the vitality of the weeds, achieving the effect of 'cutting the weeds and digging up the roots.'"

Old Man Li rambled on, and Wei Qian listened intently, memorizing every word.

This was the culmination of Old Man Li's decades of farming experience—essentially the foundational skills of a novice spiritual farmer.

Before leaving, Old Man Li said to Wei Qian, "In about ten days, the weeds will sprout and compete with the spiritual rice for energy. You should prepare in advance and start practicing the 'Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword.'"

"After all, once the weeds appear, they must be dealt with immediately. Otherwise, they will significantly affect the harvest of the Jade Crystal Rice."

Wei Qian naturally took Old Man Li's warning to heart.

Thus, after finishing his work for the day, he didn't return to cultivate. Instead, he sought out Li Guchen to inquire about the "Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword."

Li Guchen didn't know the spell himself, but he directed Wei Qian to someone who did—his father, Li Wanqing.

When Li Wanqing heard Wei Qian's request, he simply tossed him a jade slip.

"The 'Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword' isn't some powerful spell. Since you're working for the Li family, I'll teach it to you directly," Li Wanqing declared without hesitation.

Others might not have the authority, but as the elder in charge of the spiritual herb garden, he could easily make such a decision.

"Thank you, Elder Wanqing." Wei Qian hadn't expected to obtain the spell so smoothly and immediately cupped his hands in gratitude.

Returning to his residence and finishing a simple meal, he eagerly placed the jade slip against his forehead, focusing his mind to absorb its contents.

---

After a while, he finally set the jade slip down.

"It really is just a minor spell."

He now fully understood the spell. Its effect was simply to release a sword aura infused with Metal-element energy.

To martial artists in the mortal world, the "Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword" would be an extraordinary sword technique of immortals. But for cultivators, it was only useful for tasks like cutting weeds and pruning branches.

No wonder Elder Li Wanqing had handed it over so readily.

Wei Qian memorized the spell's contents, tentatively practiced it a bit, and then set it aside, returning to his meditation and cultivation.

Threads of spiritual energy from the world continuously flowed into his dantian, transforming into magic power and filling it further.

Thus, the night passed quietly.

The next day, Wei Qian made a new wish.

"Dragon Pearl, I wish for my mastery of the 'Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword' to reach perfection."

In the next moment, he understood the time required to fulfill the wish—five days.

"Five days isn't long."

Wei Qian stood up, stretched, ate breakfast, and headed to the spiritual fields.

Today, while irrigating the fields, he noticed that clusters of weeds had indeed begun to sprout in various places.

Old Man Li made several extra rounds in the fields, calling Wei Qian over to give him a few more reminders.

He urged Wei Qian to be vigilant—if the weeds grew too much for him to handle alone, he should notify Old Man Li immediately.

Five days passed in the blink of an eye. For humans, five days was short, but for weeds, it was enough time to unleash their full vitality.

Between the fourth and fifth days, in just one night, the weeds broke through the soil and shot up three inches in height!

Wei Qian was startled by the sight when he arrived: "This growth rate rivals bamboo!"

Fortunately, at dawn that day, the "Wishing Dragon Pearl" had fulfilled his wish, bringing his "Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword" to perfection—just in time for him to showcase his skills.

"Go!" A faint Metal-element sword aura shot out, slicing through a weed. The moment the weed was severed, its roots showed signs of withering.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Dozens of sword auras flew out, each strike cutting down one or multiple weeds.

After clearing ten acres, Wei Qian felt his magic power depleted.

He immediately sat down to meditate and recover. After half an hour, he stood up and resumed clearing the weeds.

---

Old Man Li, still worried, came down from the mountain to check on the situation. To his pleasant surprise, he found that most of the weeds in the spiritual fields had already been cleared by Wei Qian.

Perhaps because Wei Qian's performance pleased him greatly, Old Man Li shared many more tips on tending to spiritual crops, speaking for a full hour before finally leaving.

As Wei Qian watched Old Man Li depart, two streaks of light suddenly flashed across the sky, catching his attention.

"What's that?"

As the lights drew closer, heading toward the peak of Mist Ridge Mountain, Wei Qian could make out their forms—two cultivators flying on magical artifacts.

"Artifact flight—that requires at least late-stage Qi Refining cultivation."

Low-level cultivators lacked the magic power to sustain artifact flight. Only those at the late stages of Qi Refining could use it as a regular means of travel.

The sudden intrusion of the two outsiders immediately triggered the autonomous response of the mountain's defensive formation.

However, moments later, a Li family cultivator flew up from the mountain peak, exchanged a few words with them, and then opened a passage in the formation to let them in.

"Who are those two cultivators? They flew so boldly over the defensive formation, yet the Li family welcomed them politely?" Wei Qian wondered.

Such an unannounced and forceful entry was a blatant provocation.

According to the unwritten rules of the cultivation world, such provocateurs could be obliterated by the formation without question.

Of course, an even greater rule was that strength reigned supreme.

"Either those two have formidable cultivation and power, or they have powerful backing."

"Either way, they're far beyond the reach of a small tenant farmer like me."

Wei Qian turned back to face the vast spiritual fields before him.

"My path lies here."

"But one day, I will reach the heavens."
