# Chapter 10: The Three Secret Talismans of Tianfu Sect

"Brother Lin, maybe we should let it go for now. I can endure this—I'm not seriously injured anyway. Let's forget about that broken artifact fragment." Seeing Lin Yun stand up for him, Han Li was deeply moved. However, considering the disparity in their strength, he advised restraint.

Their opponent was at the eleventh level of Qi Refinement and came from a cultivation family, likely armed with powerful magical tools. Both Han Li and Lin Yun were mere rogue cultivators with no hope of winning. Han Li didn't want to trouble Lin Yun over their first meeting—he didn't wish to owe such a debt.

He would bide his time and seek revenge later! This grudge, Han Li would remember it well!

[Ding! Your friend Han Tianzun has sent you a request for help!]

[Stand up for your friend Han Li and receive Tianzun's Gift!]

[Tianzun's Gift: Randomly obtain one of the Three Secret Talismans of Tianfu Sect!]

Seeing the system prompt, Lin Yun's eyes lit up, and he immediately accepted.

"The Three Secret Talismans of Tianfu Sect! What treasures!"

[Ding! Congratulations, Host, you have obtained the Spirit Transformation Talisman (Poisonous Dragon).]

[This talisman will automatically be deposited into your inventory once you retrieve the artifact fragment and return it to Han Li.]

"Brother Han, don't be afraid! Watch as I stand up for you!"

Lin Yun stepped forward with righteous indignation, positioning himself in front of Han Li. "Brother Han and I became fast friends at first sight—our bond runs deep! Your troubles are my troubles!"

Had Lin Yun encountered Lu Yunfeng before meeting Han Li, he might have faced a tough battle. But now?

No chance!

Not just one Lu Yunfeng—even a hundred would be effortlessly crushed!

"Kid, you'd better listen to me, or you'll end up worse than him—injured!" Lu Yunfeng sneered arrogantly, not even bothering to regard Lin Yun, a mere tenth-level Qi Refinement cultivator, as a threat.

The two daggers in his hands spun rapidly, infused with his wind-attribute spiritual energy. Their speed increased like buzzing saw blades, chilling to the bone—just one glance could send shivers down one's spine.

The surrounding cultivators gasped at the sight of Lu Yunfeng's technique. "Wind-attribute magic!"

"Damn—"

"This guy has a rare Wind Spirit Root!"

The rogue cultivators nearby looked at Lu Yunfeng with a mix of awe, fear, and envy.

Some admired his talent.

Others resented the injustice—how someone so vile could possess such gifts.

A few simply relished the spectacle, amused that Lin Yun, this foolhardy man, dared provoke a clan cultivator.

Meanwhile, Hu Pinggu, Xiong Dali, Wu Jiuzhi, Hei Mu, and Hei Jin, who had set up stalls nearby, noticed the commotion.

Wu Jiuzhi saw Lin Yun confronting Lu Yunfeng and immediately wanted to rush to his aid.

But Hu Pinggu pulled him back.

"What are you doing?" Wu Jiuzhi asked, confused. "Didn't we agree to stand together? Now that Daoist Qingwen is in trouble, shouldn't we help?"

"Wu Jiuzhi, are you truly this dense?" Hu Pinggu scolded in frustration.

"Have you even noticed what kind of opponent he's facing?"

She pointed at Lu Yunfeng's wind-based technique.

"See that?"

"That's wind magic!"

"That guy is probably a rare Wind Spirit Root cultivator!"

"So what? There's strength in numbers. Even if he has a Wind Spirit Root, he can't beat all of us," Wu Jiuzhi argued.

"Idiot—" Huang Xiaotian snapped. "You have no idea what a Wind Spirit Root means."

"You think rushing in blindly will work?"

"Sure, if we all attacked together, we might take him down!"

"But have you forgotten? The Tai Nan Gathering has Foundation Establishment cultivators overseeing it!"

Even Wu Jiuzhi, slow as he was, finally understood. He covered his mouth in shock. "You mean..."

"But—that guy struck first!"

"Ah, Brother Wu, the cultivation world has no concept of right or wrong," Hu Pinggu sighed. "It's unfair, but that's reality. Just blame bad luck."

Wu Jiuzhi hesitated, no longer stepping forward.

On the twin-headed vulture above, the Yan siblings—Yan Yu and Yan Ling—also noticed the disturbance below.

"Brother, look! That guy is using wind magic!" Yan Ling exclaimed excitedly.

"That must be the Lu family's boy," Yan Yu guessed.

He glanced at his sister. "Actually, he has some history with you."

"Father and Mother once considered betrothing you to him. They even promised a top-tier magical artifact, the Wind-Thunder Fan. But unfortunately, the Lu family rejected our Yan family."

"Ugh! I'd never want someone like him," Yan Ling scoffed before sighing. 

"Those two rogue cultivators below are in trouble."

She then added hopefully, "But I hope they win! Teach that blind fool a lesson for rejecting me!"

Yan Yu shook his head at his sister. Her aptitude wasn't poor—she had a dual spiritual root, which was why they were sent to the Ascension Assembly. But the Chen family had ties to the Yellow Maple Valley, one of the seven major sects—far beyond the Yan family's reach.

People often said rogue cultivators suffered, but at least they had the freedom clan cultivators envied.

"Brother Lin! I'll fight with you!" Han Li stood beside Lin Yun. After all, this mess was his fault—Lin Yun was only involved because he had defended him.

A small golden sword talisman was hidden in his palm, ready to strike at the first opportunity.

"Hmph—overestimating your—" Before Lu Yunfeng could finish, a cold, sharp sensation pressed against his neck, freezing him in place.

"Don't move!" Chen Qiaoqian's dark-blue flying sword rested against his throat.

"What—?!"

"What's happening?!"

"Why are they fighting each other?"

The rogue cultivators were stunned, completely baffled by the sudden turn of events.

"Eh? What's Chen Qiaoqian doing?" The pink-robed female cultivator frowned. "Even if she doesn't want to marry this Wind Spirit Root cultivator from the Lu family, their relationship shouldn't be this hostile."

"And when Lu Yunfeng struck that plain-looking Han kid earlier, she didn't react at all."

"Something's fishy here!"

"Brother, look! The situation below is strange!" Yan Ling pointed excitedly as Chen Qiaoqian turned her sword against Lu Yunfeng.

Yan Yu frowned. "It is odd. Weren't the Chen and Lu families arranging a marriage?"

"Junior Sister Chen, what are you doing?!" Even Lu Yunfeng was caught off guard, his face twisting in shock and fury.

Even if they weren't close, there was no reason for Chen Qiaoqian to point a sword at him in public—all for some rogue cultivator!

They were supposed to be betrothed! Yet now, she betrayed him for a nobody?!

Wait—!

A rogue cultivator?!

Could it be—?!

Lu Yunfeng's eyes widened in realization, his face contorting with rage as he glared at Lin Yun.
