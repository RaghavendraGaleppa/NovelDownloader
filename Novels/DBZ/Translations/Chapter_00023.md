# Chapter 23: Blood Talisman Spirit Body

What Bai Fugui referred to was Lu Ping's extraordinary talent for talisman crafting.

Initially, as a rogue cultivator, Lu Ping had only obtained a basic first-grade low-tier talisman technique inheritance. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, he seemed naturally attuned to the art of talismans. He quickly mastered the method of crafting first-grade low-tier talismans with a terrifying success rate of one hundred percent!

Even more astonishingly, he went on to spontaneously comprehend the method for crafting first-grade mid-tier talismans without any formal instruction.

This level of skill far surpassed mere "talent." Even Wei Qian, upon hearing this, immediately thought of one possibility.

"Does your talisman master friend possess a special spirit body constitution?"

A special spirit body—this was a mystical physique that transcended spiritual root aptitude. Among ten thousand mortals, perhaps one might possess spiritual roots. But among ten thousand cultivators, there might not be even one with a special spirit body.

Just how rare were these special spirit bodies? Wei Qian knew that in the Yunzhou region, the last time an Earth-grade spiritual root cultivator appeared was thirteen years ago. The last cultivator with a special spirit body appeared one hundred and ninety-two years ago!

Lu Ping's extraordinary talent in talisman crafting perfectly matched the characteristics of one such spirit body—the "Blood Talisman Spirit Body."

No wonder Bai Fugui had been so hesitant. If word got out that Lu Ping possessed the Blood Talisman Spirit Body, even the Liuyun Sect would be stirred into action.

"If your friend had any other spirit body constitution, he might have already had a promising path in the Dao. Unfortunately, it had to be the Blood Talisman Spirit Body," Wei Qian sighed.

He understood why Lu Ping had kept his spirit body a secret. The Blood Talisman Spirit Body granted its bearer a unique ability: to craft talismans one major grade higher than normal by consuming their own essence blood and lifespan. Naturally, this came at a severe cost to the bearer. Excessive use could even lead to death.

Thus, possessing such a spirit body was more of a curse than a blessing for those without sufficient strength. They could easily be captured by factions and forced into servitude as talisman-making tools. The last known bearer of the Blood Talisman Spirit Body in the Zhao Kingdom's cultivation world had met precisely such a fate.

He had been imprisoned by a certain faction and forced to craft talismans for fifteen years. When he died at the age of thirty-five, his corpse appeared as withered as that of a centenarian.

Bai Fugui feared that the three rogue cultivators who had kidnapped Lu Ping might discover this secret, leading Lu Ping down the same tragic path.

"Three days won't be enough to do him any real harm!" Wei Qian insisted.

"Moreover, you'll need to pay me half the reward upfront." 

A thousand spirit stones—half of which was five hundred. That would be enough for Wei Qian to purchase a large batch of Huangya Pills and use their medicinal power to break through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement.

"If I do this, can you also bring Gu Chen along?" Bai Fugui mustered his courage to ask. In truth, he had originally preferred the clan cultivator Li Guchen.

"Gu Chen won't be coming. Because I alone am enough," Wei Qian said calmly.

His words might have sounded arrogant, but he had the confidence to back them up. Over the past three months, he had already tempered the Frostlight Needle once. Empowered by the Wishing Force, its might had grown to the point where it could kill an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator in a single strike!

"Very well." Reluctantly, Bai Fugui agreed. He divided half the spirit stones from his storage pouch and handed them to Wei Qian.

"There's one more small favor—help me purchase some Huangya Pills and Peiyuan Pills." Wei Qian quietly stated the quantity he needed while tossing a hundred spirit stones from the pile back to Bai Fugui.

With the spirit stones already handed over, Bai Fugui had little choice but to comply. Concerned for his friend, he acted swiftly and procured the pills Wei Qian needed by the next day.

"Keep an eye on those three rogue cultivators. Come find me again in two days." After this brief instruction, Wei Qian took the pills and immediately retreated to seclusion.

Before beginning his closed-door cultivation, however, he sought out Old Man Li to request a "long leave"—seven days at once. Old Man Li agreed. "Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on things for you."

With all mundane affairs settled, Wei Qian finally began his true seclusion.

In his residence, Wei Qian sat cross-legged on his bed. He retrieved the porcelain vial containing the pills, uncorked it, and poured out the golden-yellow pills like candies. Without hesitation, he picked one up and swallowed it.

As the pill entered his stomach, a surge of medicinal energy soon spread through his meridians. This scene had played out many times over the past three months.

After a quarter-hour, Wei Qian fully refined the pill's energy and reached for another, repeating the process. 

An hour passed, then two, then three... Time stretched on until Wei Qian lost track of how many pills he had consumed, mechanically repeating the motions of taking and swallowing.

At last, the trickling stream filled the pond, and quantity transformed into quality. He sensed a thin, intangible barrier—the bottleneck. 

Wei Qian mobilized all the spiritual energy in his dantian, circulating it through his meridians at ever-increasing speed until it erupted in a mighty surge.

"Break through for me!" 

With one decisive push, the vast torrent of spiritual energy shattered the invisible barrier. The old constraints were broken, and his body suddenly felt lighter, as if he had stepped into a new realm.

But Wei Qian knew this was merely an illusion brought on by the breakthrough.

Fifth level of Qi Refinement—success!

Without pausing to celebrate, Wei Qian immediately opened the vial of Peiyuan Pills and swallowed one. The pill dissolved into medicinal energy the moment it entered his mouth, surging toward his dantian and dispersing pure medicinal essence.

Breaking through a cultivation stage was not a one-time achievement. Without timely consolidation, one's realm could easily regress. For minor breakthroughs, the risk was smaller, but for major ones, cultivators often needed years of recuperation.

Wei Qian had no time to waste—otherwise, the talisman master Lu Ping might truly be beyond saving. Thus, he chose to take the Peiyuan Pills. These pills could quickly stabilize a cultivator's condition after a breakthrough and were also used by late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators to enhance their spiritual energy.

One day to break through, one day to consolidate his realm—Wei Qian intended to face the three rogue cultivators at his peak condition.

At dawn on the fifth day—exactly four days after their agreement—Bai Fugui arrived early at the foot of the mountain, pacing anxiously.

"Would he really stand me up?" Bai Fugui fretted. If Wei Qian reneged on their deal, there was little he could do. If Wei Qian simply stayed on Wuling Mountain, Bai Fugui couldn't very well storm the place.

Then—*creak*—a door opened. Bai Fugui looked up, his face lighting up with joy.

It was Wei Qian!

The latter spoke only four concise words: "Lead the way."
