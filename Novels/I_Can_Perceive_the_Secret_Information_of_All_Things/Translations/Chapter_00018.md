# Chapter 18: I Just Broke Through a Realm, No Need to Look at Me Like That

The Tu Residence.

"I've always been law-abiding. I just happen to earn a bit more than others. You officers shouldn't falsely accuse people," Tu Mantun said calmly as he faced Song Yuanbao.

The constables searched every corner of the Tu residence for a long time but found no trace of any demonic cultivator, let alone caught anyone.

"We came here based on a report. If you're innocent, we'll naturally clear your name," Song Yuanbao said. "But you shouldn't be slipping banknotes into my hand in front of everyone."

Tu Mantun chuckled and pocketed the banknote. "Don't overthink it, officer. It's just a reflex... I just didn't want you all to come for nothing. Consider it tea money."

"You should break that habit," Song Yuanbao coughed.

"You've been searching for over an hour now. Let me put it this way—even if you search for three days and nights, you won't find any so-called demonic cultivator because there isn't any," Tu Mantun's expression suddenly darkened. "If you continue disturbing my family's peace, I'll take this up with the governor of Longxiang County."

Song Yuanbao glanced at Xiao Ji.

The Daoist who had reported the case was leisurely strolling around the Tu residence, having already explored both the front and back courtyards.

"Daoist Xiao," Song Yuanbao called out. "What do you think?"

Xiao Ji circled Tu Mantun once.

["Even if you search a hundred times, you won't think to check the stove in the backyard. Beneath it lies a secret passage, protected by an immortal's barrier. How could you lowly lackeys hope to crack a big case? Once the immortal helps me secure the land of Yuanshen Temple and I emerge from three years of seclusion, everyone who stands in the way of my fortune will die."]

From the moment he entered the Tu residence, Xiao Ji had stayed close to Tu Mantun, already privy to his secrets. Now, he was just confirming them.

This fat merchant, whose mind was filled with thoughts of bankruptcy, now wore a haughty expression. In half an hour, he'd be wailing in despair.

"This is what I think," Xiao Ji said, turning to Song Yuanbao. "Constable Song, I was curious about what the wealthy eat, so I took a look in the kitchen in the backyard."

At the mention of the backyard kitchen, Tu Mantun tensed, a faint sweat breaking out on his forehead.

"What did they eat?" Song Yuanbao's curiosity was piqued.

"Turns out it's just the usual grains, oils, seasonings, vegetables, and pork..." Xiao Ji feigned surprise.

What nonsense... Song Yuanbao felt a sense of foreboding. He was probably going to get reported today.

Though the Tu family wasn't well-liked in Willow Town, they had operated a gambling den for decades and had some connections. Offending them would bring no small trouble.

"But I noticed something strange beneath the stove. Constable Song, would you like to lift the iron pot and take a look?" Xiao Ji raised his eyebrows at Song Yuanbao twice.

At this, Tu Mantun truly panicked. "Haven't you caused enough trouble today? You've turned my household upside down, and now you want to lift my cooking pot? Get out now, and I won't pursue this. Push me further, and I won't be so forgiving."

Hearing this, Song Yuanbao hesitated. Mishandling this could ruin his career.

But on second thought, the man's outburst over a simple inspection of the stove was suspicious.

In the backyard kitchen, Song Yuanbao lifted the large iron pot and felt beneath it. Sure enough, something was sealed there.

[The demonic cultivator's hiding place has been discovered. Tu Mantun, knowing the danger, plans to grab some valuables and flee while the constables investigate below.]

[The demonic cultivator has just finished today's cultivation session. Aware of the search, he prepares to strike first. When Song Yuanbao opens the passage, the demonic cultivator will emerge, killing Song Yuanbao on the spot.]

"Let me help you." Xiao Ji stepped in front of Song Yuanbao and lifted the wooden cover.

A surge of black energy shot out, its malevolent aura scattering the onlookers.

Xiao Ji channeled spiritual energy into his right palm and struck the black energy head-on.

The collision produced a deafening explosion, the shockwave shattering pots and pans, blasting a hole in the roof, and cracking the walls.

"Tu Mantun, still claiming you're not harboring a demonic cultivator?" Song Yuanbao drew his sword and pointed it at Tu Mantun.

Tu Mantun knew sheltering a demonic cultivator was a capital offense—whether in the Great Li Kingdom, River Valley Kingdom, or any other minor state.

Trembling, he stammered, "C-couldn't he be the Kitchen God?"

"Does your Kitchen God look this pale?" Song Yuanbao pointed at the emerging demonic cultivator.

The cultivator's ghostly pallor was unsettling.

"Fear not, Master Tu," the demonic cultivator said, unfazed by the crowd. "Once these people are erased from existence, today's events never happened. At the fourth layer of Qi Refining, I could already handle them easily. Ah, this Daoist seems to be at the fourth layer too—unexpected. Last I checked, you were just a first-layer insect."

"But no matter what method you used to advance, today, I'll still kill you effortlessly."

"Because just moments ago, I've reached the fifth layer of Qi Refining."

His voice alone sent chills down their spines.

"Fifth layer of Qi Refining?"

"Boss, is he bluffing?"

"Someone of this level... shouldn't we call the Demon-Suppression Bureau?"

The constables wavered, intimidated by the power gap.

[This demonic cultivator practices the Five Organs Method, using human organs for cultivation. Those touched by his spiritual energy will have their organs corroded, rotting into maggots that consume flesh and bones... He has now reached the fifth layer of Qi Refining... Deep perception gained. Cultivation +5.]

With this perception complete, Xiao Ji felt his blood surge.

He had been seizing every opportunity to perceive and cultivate these days, leaving him just three points shy of the fifth layer. These five points were enough for a breakthrough.

Steam began rising from his body.

The sight baffled everyone, especially Song Yuanbao, who feared Xiao Ji might cook himself alive.

"Hmph, Daoist, are you preparing some technique?" The demonic cultivator regarded everyone present as prey, certain none could escape. "I thought you'd start by throwing talismans or drawing that sword on your back. Didn't expect you to have other tricks."

Each of Xiao Ji's breakthroughs came with peculiar effects. His first realm increase had left him trembling; subsequent ones grew increasingly intense. This time, he had no idea what to expect.

With a resounding boom, Xiao Ji advanced from the fourth to the fifth layer.

His upper robe exploded into shreds, revealing perfectly defined muscles that pulsed with energy.

"I just broke through a realm. No need to look at me like that," Xiao Ji said, locking eyes with the demonic cultivator. "Sorry, but I'm also at the fifth layer of Qi Refining. You should surrender."

After intimidating his opponent, Xiao Ji quickly checked his status panel to confirm.

[Name: Xiao Ji]  
[Age: 19]  
[Affiliation: Yuanshen Temple]  
[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, varying in number]  
[Realm: Qi Refining Layer 5 (2/50)]  
[Technique: "Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Purple Gold Art"]  
[Perception Range: Ten zhang radius]

"Your breakthrough method is... unique," the demonic cultivator said, stunned by the sudden shift. He immediately unleashed his sinister energy, his skeletal hands lunging at Xiao Ji, aiming to kill him before he could stabilize his new realm.

He had learned one lesson: never monologue while the enemy still lived. Kill first, talk later.
