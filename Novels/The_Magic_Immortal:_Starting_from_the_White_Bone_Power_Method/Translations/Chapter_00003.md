# Chapter 3: The Hardships of Life  

Wang Chan hastily withdrew his magical power and rose to leave his dwelling.  

Paying protection money was unavoidable—after all, he still needed to cultivate in Lotus Mountain.  

True to its name, Lotus Mountain resembled a blooming lotus from afar, with its numerous peaks standing tall amidst lush greenery. It was a pleasant place, its spiritual energy far denser than the barren wilderness beyond.  

This was thanks to the tiny first-grade spiritual vein beneath Lotus Mountain.  

Similar locations were scattered outside the city.  

Even the smallest scraps were worth taking.  

The Administration Hall of White Mountain City naturally hadn't overlooked these spots, taking control of them and converting them into unranked cave dwellings to rent out to cultivators outside the city, collecting fees in return.  

Lotus Mountain alone had over a hundred such dwellings.  

Not renting wasn’t an option—spiritual energy in the wilderness beyond the city was far too sparse, making it difficult to sustain normal cultivation outside these areas.  

Moreover, the wilderness was fraught with danger, where any manner of misfortunes could occur.  

Gathering many cultivators in one place provided some degree of mutual protection.  

Additionally, White Mountain City periodically dispatched patrols to inspect the area, ensuring the safety of its tenants.  

Of course, one couldn’t rely too much on these patrols—they were likely just going through the motions.  

Wang Chan’s cave dwelling was number sixty-nine, halfway up the mountain.  

He rather liked this number—it reminded him of a long-legged dance major from his past life, the kind who could bend backward effortlessly during games, leaving one breathless.  

Still, paying one spirit coin per month in rent was painful enough.  

But worse, he also had to pay another spirit coin in protection money to the Red Leaf Gang every month.  

The Red Leaf Gang was a cultivator faction operating within a three-hundred-mile radius of Lotus Mountain. They had some strength, with two or three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators overseeing things.  

They might not actually protect you from anything, but if you refused to pay when they came collecting, leaving Lotus Mountain would quickly teach you just how cruel the cultivation world could be.  

It was infuriating.  

Previously, Wang Chan's original body had relied on the **[Spring-Returning Cloud-Pushing Technique]** and **[Minor Withering-Life Needles]**, braving wind and rain to set up a medical stall in the market or making house calls. Even then, his monthly income barely reached four or five spirit coins.  

After deducting those two coins, what remained was barely enough to sustain his basic cultivation needs.  

As he walked, Wang Chan reluctantly retrieved a spirit coin from his storage pouch, tucked it into his sleeve, and hurried out of his room into the courtyard.  

The mid-morning sun was scorching. Before Wang Chan could even see the person outside clearly upon opening the gate, he was hit by a wave of pungent body odor that nearly made him retch.  

"What took you so long!" Leader Zheng crossed his arms, glaring coldly at Wang Chan with impatience.  

"Apologies, Leader Zheng. I’ve been exhausted lately and was still half-asleep," Wang Chan explained with a smile, presenting the spirit coin from his sleeve.  

"Don’t dawdle next time." Seeing Wang Chan’s compliance, Leader Zheng left after a curt remark, clearly eager to move on to the next tenant.  

"Leader Zheng, won’t you stay for some tea…" Wang Chan called out politely as he watched the man leave.  

Just as he was about to turn back inside, he noticed that Leader Zheng hadn’t stopped at the neighboring dwelling, number seventy, but had instead bypassed it entirely, disappearing around the mountain path.  

He vaguely recalled that the previously vacant number seventy had been rented out ten days ago—though he didn’t know to whom.  

"Brother Wang, eaten yet?"  

From the other side, at the gate of dwelling sixty-eight, a hunched man in black robes greeted him with a farmer’s warm smile.  

"Brother Zhang, back from tending the spirit fields?" Wang Chan returned the smile.  

Zhang the Hunchback was a low-grade spirit farmer, honest and simple by nature. He and Wang Chan’s original body had gotten along well, maintaining a friendly relationship.  

"Returned at the start of the hour. Just delivered ten catties of Red-Toothed Spirit Rice to Brother Sun at dwelling twenty-seven," Zhang replied.  

For a spirit farmer, selling small amounts of spirit rice on the side was perfectly normal.  

As they spoke, a creaking sound drew their attention.  

Wang Chan turned to see the gate of dwelling seventy swing open. Out stepped a woman—her legs even longer than that dance major from his past life—dressed in white robes and a black skirt, her silver-highlighted ponytail swaying. Her expression was cold, her face unfamiliar, and she carried a faint scent of osmanthus. Clearly, she was the new neighbor.  

As the woman approached, Wang Chan, thinking it best to maintain neighborly relations, clasped his hands in greeting. "Fellow Daoist, greetings. I am Wang Chan, tenant of dwelling sixty-nine..."  

To his surprise, the woman ignored him entirely, her cold gaze never even glancing his way as she strode straight to Zhang the Hunchback. She tossed two spirit coins into his arms and said, "Ten catties of White Jade Spirit Rice."  

"Right away." Zhang’s back seemed to hunch even further as he flashed an ingratiating smile, pocketing the coins before retrieving a clean jar of rice from his storage pouch. He presented it with both hands. "Fellow Daoist Chen, please inspect it."  

The woman pinched the edge of the jar with two fingers, not even sparing it a glance, and carried it back inside.  

Wang Chan was inwardly annoyed. *How rude! We’re neighbors—was that attitude really necessary?*  

But when he subtly probed her aura, he was stunned to sense an overwhelming surge of spiritual energy—at least ninety strands of refined Qi. He swallowed hard and took half a step back.  

Cultivators with fewer than thirty-six strands were in the early stage of Qi Refining. Those with fewer than seventy-two were mid-stage, and those below one hundred and eight were late-stage. Once one fully circulated one hundred and eight strands throughout their body, they reached the Great Perfection of Qi Refining.  

This classification existed because, within a major realm, accumulating a certain amount of Qi led to minor qualitative improvements in both life essence and spiritual power—most notably, an increase in lifespan.  

"Lotus Mountain hasn’t had a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator in five or six years. Ah well, best not to argue with a woman."  

Wang Chan promptly adopted a detached demeanor, pretending the earlier exchange had never happened.  

Only after the woman had reentered her dwelling did he turn back to Zhang for information:  

Her surname was Chen. Late-stage Qi Refining. Unknown origins. Had once single-handedly slain a first-grade upper-tier ghost. Made a living hunting demons and spirits.  

"Single-handedly killing an upper-tier ghost… That woman is terrifying. Best not to provoke her."  

Wang Chan shuddered at the thought, relieved he hadn’t misspoken earlier.  

"Brother Wang, it’s mealtime. Why not join me for a drink at my humble abode?" Zhang, still in high spirits—especially after securing another sale—extended a warm invitation.  

"Next time, definitely next time," Wang Chan declined politely.  

It was already mid-morning, and he needed to prepare to treat Madam Cheng at Little Tea Mountain.  

*Ah, making a living often leaves one with little choice.*  

"Very well. Let’s share a drink in half a month. I’ll be away this afternoon to tend a newly acquired low-grade water spirit field for someone," Zhang said cheerfully, retrieving a small sack of spirit rice from his storage pouch. "Here, take five catties of White Jade Spirit Rice to try. Freshly harvested."  

"Oh, I couldn’t possibly—" Wang Chan protested verbally, even as his hands tightly gripped the sack.  

Five catties of White Jade Spirit Rice were worth a full spirit coin. Brother Zhang was being far too generous.  

"Nonsense! Three months ago, when I overworked myself tending the Li family’s fields and couldn’t get out of bed for three days, you treated me with your needles without charge—even threw in a cup of tiger-bone wine!" Zhang said earnestly.  

Wang Chan thought back and indeed recalled the incident. Still, even so, a whole spirit coin’s worth of rice seemed excessive.  

*This isn’t normal.*  

Suddenly, an idea struck him. As he stowed the rice away, he asked with a smile, "Brother Zhang, whose fields are you tending this afternoon?"  

"The Li family again. The Seventh Madam recently acquired a few acres of fine water spirit fields. She said I was skilled and hardworking, so she asked me to manage them."  

"I see. But water spirit fields lean toward yin-cold energy. Working them too long can deplete one’s yang energy." Wang Chan immediately played the considerate role. "Brother Zhang, wait right here. I still have half a bottle of tiger-bone wine—take it with you. A few sips will warm you up when you need it."  

"Oh my… This… Haha, how could I possibly accept?" Zhang rubbed his hands together, feigning reluctance as laughter creased his face.
