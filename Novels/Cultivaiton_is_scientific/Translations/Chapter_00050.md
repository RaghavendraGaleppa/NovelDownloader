# Chapter 50 Discovery

Since successfully crafting his first talisman, Li Shiming had become unstoppable in his pursuit of the art. Having come from a world of equality to this realm of cultivation, the deeper he understood this world, the more he felt threatened by its dangers.

This sense of threat stemmed from insufficient firepower—a primal fear rooted in his soul, inherited from the racial instincts of his past life. Had he chosen to remain an ordinary mortal, he wouldn't have worried much. With his family background and knowledge, he could have excelled in officialdom or any other profession.

But after learning of the cultivation world, how could he settle for mediocrity?

Talismans allowed him to compensate for his lack of spiritual power and limited spellcasting abilities. Thus, for a long time, he devoted his daily spiritual energy to crafting talismans.

When making the "Primary Gengjin Talisman," he succeeded after eight failures. For the "Primary Fireball Talisman," it took only five attempts. By the tenth day of the second month, excluding his spoils of war, he had crafted twenty "Primary Lightfoot Talismans," thirty "Primary Fireball Talismans," thirty "Primary Gengjin Talismans," and ten "Primary Telekinesis Talismans."

His "Primary Lightfoot Talisman" was particularly special, surpassing the speed of the ones he had seized by twenty percent.

After taking stock of his talismans, he decided not to craft any more that day. On one hand, he had enough talismans for now, and his recent focus on crafting had slowed his cultivation progress due to excessive spiritual energy consumption. On the other hand, the imperial examinations were approaching, set to begin on the fifteenth day of the second month.

He had resolved to enter the cultivation world, but before leaving, he wanted to fulfill the original body's greatest wish—to succeed in the imperial examinations. This would serve as a final farewell to his past self, freeing him from lingering emotional attachments and allowing him to fully devote himself to cultivation.

Out of respect for the exam, he spent the remaining days preparing diligently.

Meanwhile, the market in Zhongdu City had successfully operated twice, satisfying the various cultivation families and interested cultivators. The profits had grown due to the safer environment and increasing numbers of cultivators.

Among these cultivators, only the Hao family was still investigating the murder of their clan members.

"Fourth Brother, have you verified the investigation results?" Elder Hao asked gravely, holding documents that both surprised and somewhat confirmed his suspicions.

"Clan Leader, I used some favors to obtain this information from the imperial family," replied the fourth-ranked Hao cultivator solemnly.

"Clan Leader, regardless of whether Li Shiming is the killer, we should just eliminate him. Do we really need evidence?" another Hao cultivator interjected impatiently.

In the cultivation world, evidence was unnecessary—suspicion alone was enough to justify action.

"According to the intelligence, that boy has been keeping to himself. That does seem suspicious," Elder Hao nodded slightly.

Before attending the gathering, Li Shiming had frequently visited a residence outside the city. But after the gathering, he had remained within the city walls. The documents revealed that Prince Shun had been burned to death by mysterious flames, along with several of his confidants, including Li Wenfeng.

Li Wenfeng had a deep-seated conflict with Li Wenyuan, and Li Shiming's mother's death was linked to Li Wenfeng. Moreover, Li Shiming had been attacked shortly after arriving in Zhongdu, likely connected to Li Wenfeng and Prince Shun.

The imperial family had suspected Li Shiming, but due to his close relationship with the court's honored guest, Gu Jia, they refrained from further investigation without concrete evidence. Most crucially, Gu Jia had inspected Prince Shun's death scene and confirmed the absence of spiritual energy fluctuations.

Similarly, the scene where the two Hao cultivators were killed also showed no spiritual energy fluctuations, only mysterious flames. This similarity made Li Shiming the prime suspect.

"Clan Leader, even with Gu Jia in Zhongdu, killing a mere second-level Qi Refining cultivator wouldn't cause significant spiritual energy fluctuations. I can handle it alone," the fourth-ranked cultivator requested firmly.

"Be cautious. If there's no opportunity, don't act. Take these two 'Invisibility Talismans' to aid your mission," Elder Hao said after a moment of contemplation.

Meanwhile, Li Shiming was immersed in late-night reading, using this method to calm his mind and return to a scholarly state. He sipped spiritual water, knowing that after this examination, the years of diligent study his former self had endured would come to an end. This was his way of savoring his final days as a mortal.

A faint *buzz* suddenly pulled him out of his reading. His visor had issued an alert—whenever a moving target entered the monitored area at night, the visor would vibrate slightly. Connected to the IBMz15, this vibration was enough to alert him, whether he was sleeping or cultivating.

He put on the visor and saw through the second camera probe a thermal image of a figure climbing over the courtyard wall. Switching the camera to normal mode, he expected to see the intruder under the courtyard's lantern light. But the spot was empty.

Switching back to infrared thermal imaging, the figure reappeared.

"A cultivator!" Li Shiming's expression darkened.

Despite the passage of time, a cultivator had finally come for him. Only a cultivator could conceal their form so thoroughly that ordinary eyes couldn't detect them. Of course, this invisibility was effective against mortals—cultivators had means to see through such tricks.

But Li Shiming, barely a novice in cultivation, lacked such abilities. Without the infrared thermal imaging, the intruder might have approached undetected.

His hand brushed his waist, retrieving ten "Primary Gengjin Talismans." As a second-level Qi Refining cultivator, he could activate five talismans at once, requiring two consecutive activations to unleash all ten.

The fourth-ranked Hao cultivator, having scaled the wall, smirked coldly. This assassination would be laughably easy. Li Shiming had no defensive formations, not even basic warning talismans—essential precautions for any cultivator.

While family cultivators like him relied on clan defense formations, wandering cultivators always set up warning talismans to prevent ambushes. After all, even mortals could kill an unprepared cultivator.

His gaze swept the courtyard, detecting the two night guards. A silent, icy smile curled his lips. Were it not for the need to avoid alerting Gu Jia, he would have simply used a magical artifact to eliminate both the guards and Li Shiming in one strike.
