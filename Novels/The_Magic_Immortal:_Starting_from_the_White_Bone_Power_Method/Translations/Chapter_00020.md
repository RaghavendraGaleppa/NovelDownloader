# Chapter 20: The Essential Magical Artifact for Plundering

"My apologies, Fellow Daoist Tian. I had already made arrangements with Fellow Daoist Ning to go out practicing medicine today. It cannot be delayed. Another time, I will certainly..."

Wang Chan smiled apologetically but refused politely, no longer as timid as when he had been stopped last time.

"What if I insist?" The beauty mark woman stared meaningfully at Wang Chan. "Fellow Daoist Wang wouldn't refuse to give me, a patrol guard, this face, would you?"

"My apologies, Fellow Daoist Tian. A person must keep their word. Since I promised Fellow Daoist Ning, I cannot break that promise. Next time there's a chance, I'll help adjust your condition." Wang Chan took a deep breath and spoke neither humbly nor arrogantly. Seeing the coldness in the beauty mark woman's eyes, he quickly added:

"If Fellow Daoist Tian is looking for Fellow Daoist Chen, it's best to go now. Fellow Daoist Chen is accustomed to leaving at noon. Any later, and he might not be home."

Given the beauty mark woman's status, the only person on Lotus Mountain who would warrant her personal visit would be Fellow Daoist Chen, a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.

At the mention of "Fellow Daoist Chen," the beauty mark woman froze momentarily, as if suddenly remembering her original purpose. She gave Wang Chan a deep look, lightly patted the black goat beneath her, and leaped over Wang Chan, landing more than ten zhang away before quickly disappearing into the distance.

*Another woman who can turn on a dime*, Wang Chan sighed inwardly.

But he stood by his decision.

After all, she was a married woman—best not to provoke trouble.

Moreover, given the current circumstances, her partner was a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator with greater influence than him.

If he gave in and their affair was exposed... the beauty mark woman might escape unscathed, but he would undoubtedly suffer.

Most importantly, he couldn't discern her true intentions, so caution was necessary.

As for her veiled threats, Wang Chan wasn't afraid. He was no longer someone to be pushed around.

*Sigh, testing a minor rogue cultivator like this... I almost couldn't resist. Still bound by circumstances. I wonder when I'll be able to act freely and without restraint...*

---

By mid-morning, the Black River Market was already in sight.

Wang Chan calculated that, at most, it would take another half a cup of tea's time to meet up with Ning Jingming, so he wouldn't be late.

His hurried journey hadn't been in vain.

Just as he was about to pick up speed, he noticed a red-eyed crow hidden among the branches of a nearby tree, staring coldly at him.

It startled him slightly.

Fortunately, the red-eyed crow was only a non-ranked demonic beast, its combat prowess negligible, so there was no need for concern.

However, this was the first time he had seen such a creature on this path after traveling it so many times.

The red-eyed crow glanced at him briefly before shifting its gaze elsewhere.

Seeing that it meant no harm and eager to continue his journey, Wang Chan ignored it and pressed on.

But after only a few steps, he inexplicably turned his head sharply—only to see the red-eyed crow staring coldly at him again. Noticing his gaze, it averted its eyes once more.

*This damned thing has given me two malicious looks!*

Wang Chan thought to himself as his sleeve flicked imperceptibly, releasing a wisp of black smoke that dissipated into the wind.

A moment later, the red-eyed crow shuddered as twenty-one long black needle shadows burst from its body, scattering before reforming into a single black needle that shot back into Wang Chan's sleeve.

Simultaneously, the crow exploded into a mist of blood, dying instantly.

The blood mist dispersed into the wind, leaving no trace.

*That feels better... What a fine needle, heh.*

Wang Chan nodded in satisfaction, then resumed his journey while rubbing the black needle in his hand. With a mere thought, the black needle turned white, and with another, it gleamed silver.

After studying it last night, he had fully grasped the post-divine transformation capabilities and usage of the **[Minor Withering-Life Needle]**.

If the black and white restriction patterns within the needle were merged, the artifact restriction of the **[Minor Withering-Life Needle]** would transform into a mid-grade restriction, elevating it to a mid-grade magical artifact—far beyond his expectations.

Moreover, after the transformation, the withered-yellow restriction patterns would directly become black and white, and the needle itself would also take on these two colors.

When activating the white restriction, the needle would turn pure white.

The power contained within would no longer be **[Greenwood Essence]** but **[Thunderwood Essence]**, possessing a distinctly yang-aligned nature.

Thunder governs vitality, and combined with wood-attribute essence, the **[Revitalizing Restoration]** ability underwent a remarkable evolution.

Additionally, thunder could also be used for destruction and exorcism, granting the needle formidable offensive and purifying effects.

If he encountered another situation like Zhao Shanhe's, he wouldn't need Ning Jingming to cast the **[Righteous Sun Spell]**. After sealing with the needle, he could directly activate the Thunderwood Essence to both restore vitality and dispel the **[Bone-Corroding Yin Wind]**.

When activating the black restriction, the needle would turn pure black.

In this state, the power channeled would no longer be **[Grave Yin Energy]** but **[Profound Yin Energy]**, drastically enhancing the sealing effect while also increasing the needle's speed to near-instantaneous levels.

Most terrifyingly, in its black form, the needle could transform into an energy needle through the Profound Yin Energy, becoming formless and imperceptible, able to enter other living beings unnoticed with the wind.

This allowed the sealing effect to reach every corner of the target's body. Moreover, if the Profound Yin Energy needle was detonated, it would explode into twenty-one needle shadows that wreaked havoc before reforming into the original needle.

The result of such an explosion was like what happened to the crow—death without a trace.

*This black needle form is sinister, no doubt, but it's incredibly satisfying to use. Truly an essential magical artifact for both home and travel—especially for plundering.*

Wang Chan couldn't help but marvel.

Additionally, if neither restriction was activated, the **[Minor Withering-Life Needle]** would remain an ordinary low-grade magical artifact, with effects similar to before—just slightly more durable.

In other words, the **[Minor Withering-Life Needle]** could switch between mid-grade and low-grade forms at will.

The only drawback was that, in its mid-grade form, activating it consumed nine strands of his unranked-quality mana. After one or two uses, he would be completely drained.

*The Mystic Turtle Breathing Technique is still lacking. After two months of arduous cultivation, I've only gained a measly twenty strands of mana—utterly insignificant.*

Upon entering the Black River Market but before reaching the medical district, several familiar cultivators greeted him from afar.

"Fellow Daoist Wang!" "Five-Needle Fellow Daoist!" "Wang Five-Needle!" The titles varied.

Recalling two months ago, when he passed through here, who would have paid him any attention?

But ever since he and Ning Jingming resolved Zhao Shanhe's affliction using the **[Five-Needle Sealing Technique]**, word had spread. Combined with his subsequent demonstrations, his reputation had grown.

Even the shopkeeper with the mustache knew of Wang Chan's name. When purchasing **[Spirit Nurturing Elixir]**, he offered a twenty percent discount. Knowing Wang Chan's fondness for Eight-Treasures Spirit Frost Cake, he even packed a plate in a jade box for him to take away—service couldn't be more enthusiastic.

Moreover, thanks to his fully-restricted low-grade magical artifact, his expertise in revitalization, and his unique sealing technique, Wang Chan's daily earnings from setting up shop in the Black River Market had recently reached a full spirit coin.

Life was looking brighter by the day.

An hour later.

Green Bamboo Mountain.

A small green low-grade flying boat landed steadily on the grassy slope at the mountain's base. Wang Chan and Ning Jingming disembarked.

The flying boat had been rented by Ning Jingming from the market—a testament to his influence, as ordinary rogue cultivators might not even qualify to rent such a luxury item, regardless of wealth.

Wang Chan was envious. Riding the flying boat felt like cruising in an aerial yacht—smooth, fast, and quiet, with the defensive barrier blocking the roaring winds. One could scream their lungs out without anyone outside hearing.

The only regret was the lack of female companionship. Though he didn't dislike Ning Jingming's dark, homely face, two men on a flying boat made for sparse conversation—hardly entertaining.

As they stepped off the boat and breathed in Green Bamboo Mountain's crisp air—so different from Lotus Mountain's—Wang Chan sighed admiringly, "The spiritual energy here is incredibly rich..."

"Green Bamboo Mountain sits atop a decent-sized first-grade spirit vein. The monthly rent is five spirit coins. Most residents are mid-stage cultivators, with a few late-stage ones mixed in," Ning Jingming explained. "Fellow Daoist Qu's cave is at number twenty-seven. Let's head up now."
