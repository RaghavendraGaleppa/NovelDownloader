# Chapter 21: Speculations

"Xia Yan, go to the accounts office and withdraw three taels of silver for Master Qin," Xiao Qing instructed her attendant after Qin Ziling nodded in agreement.

"Yes," Xia Yan acknowledged before leaving the pavilion.

"Master Qin, if you have any future harvests—whether game or medicinal herbs—please bring them to me. I guarantee the fairest prices, and should you obtain any exotic beasts, I can arrange auctions to secure the best possible price," Xiao Qing offered once Xia Yan had departed.

"No problem. However, I'm not very familiar with mountain herbs and don't know which are valuable. I wouldn't know where to start collecting them. Might Miss Xiao have any suggestions?" Qin Ziling asked, a thought occurring to him.

His spirit could fly through the mountains, scanning areas inaccessible to ordinary people. While he had focused on hunting for profit, he had overlooked the potential of medicinal herbs.

As for exotic beasts, they were currently beyond his capabilities. Even if he did manage to hunt one, he would consume it himself rather than sell it, so he dismissed the idea for now. Still, Xiao Qing's mention of auctioning exotic beasts surprised him, hinting at her considerable influence.

"That's no trouble. I have a comprehensive herbal compendium in my room. I'll have Xia Yan deliver it to you later," Xiao Qing replied.

"There's no need to trouble Xia Yan. She can leave it at the shop, and I'll collect it next time," Qin Ziling said, unwilling to reveal his identity.

"Very well. I'll have Xia Yan bring it to the shop for you to pick up at your convenience," Xiao Qing replied, giving him a knowing look.

Soon after, Xia Yan returned with the silver. Qin Ziling took it and excused himself.

Xiao Qing personally saw him out, watching until he disappeared down the street before turning to Shopkeeper Zhu. "Have someone bring the game Master Qin delivered to the rear courtyard."

Shopkeeper Zhu hesitated briefly before nodding. "Understood, Mistress."

...

In the courtyard, Xiao Qing pointed at the two hares and the muntjac on the ground and asked Xia Yan, who had just finished inspecting them, "What do you think?"

"Each was killed with a single blow to the head, shattering the skull. That alone isn't extraordinary—any martial practitioner at the Iron Skin level could achieve it with a metal weapon, and even a skilled Ox Hide practitioner might manage. The impressive part is that hares and muntjacs are agile mountain creatures. Landing a headshot is difficult, and hitting three in a row would require either extraordinary luck or skill beyond my own."

Xia Yan continued, "This suggests he might be an Iron Skin practitioner specializing in leg techniques, or even a Jinli martial master. But it's strange—I didn't sense the imposing aura of a martial master or the vigorous energy in his legs. Besides, all Jinli masters in Fangshuo City are prominent figures we'd recognize. Even skilled Iron Skin practitioners specializing in leg techniques are rare enough to be known, yet I've never heard of him. And why would someone of that caliber bother hunting small game for such meager profits?"

"My thoughts align with yours. His strength is hard to gauge, and his behavior is perplexing," Xiao Qing admitted.

"Even you can't see through him? Could he truly be a Jinli master? If he suppressed his aura, I wouldn't be able to tell. But you once reached..." Xia Yan trailed off, catching herself.

Xiao Qing smiled wryly. "My foundation was damaged, and my strength dissipated. Even my perception is affected now. If someone conceals their power, it's hard for me to discern." A trace of bitterness lingered in her eyes.

"With your talent, finding the Eight Desolates Emerald Python would restore your foundation and strength," Xia Yan consoled her.

"The Eight Desolates Emerald Python is a third-tier exotic beast, nearly as formidable as a Bone Forging grandmaster. Not only does it dwell deep in the Wuyang Mountains, but even reaching its territory is perilous. Even if we miraculously found it, hunting it would require at least a grandmaster or three Jinli masters. If my grandfather were still alive, perhaps... but now..." Xiao Qing shook her head hopelessly.

"Fangshuo County may lack the means, but neighboring Qinghe County is larger, with more Jinli masters and grandmasters. And the provincial capital's auction houses occasionally list exotic beasts," Xia Yan suggested.

"Wishful thinking. If an Eight Desolates Emerald Python appeared, it would never reach our small county. I appreciate your concern, but fate is what it is," Xiao Qing said, waving her hand dismissively.

Xia Yan hesitated before changing the subject. "What about this Qin Feng? Should we—"

"No. We're in business to make money. As long as he brings profit, we won't pry further. Still, he clearly has skill, so instruct Shopkeeper Zhu to treat him fairly—no price manipulation. Also, retrieve my *Compendium of Rare Herbs* from my room and give it to Shopkeeper Zhu to pass to Master Qin next time."

"Understood," Xia Yan replied.

...

Qin Ziling had realized early on that Xiao Qing, the young and beautiful proprietor, had misunderstood him when she personally attended to such a small transaction and later mentioned exotic beasts. But this misunderstanding served his purpose.

Trust no one lightly.

Her misconception would deter her from exploiting him in pricing and explain his ability to consistently supply game. Thus, he hadn't concealed the injuries on the hares and muntjac, nor had he reacted when exotic beasts were mentioned.

After leaving "Mountain Wilderness Inn," Qin Ziling didn't head straight to the martial school. Instead, he visited an herbal shop called "Beneficial Origin Hall."
