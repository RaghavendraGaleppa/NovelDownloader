# Chapter 165: Farewell

"Shiming, come over to my place for a while!" Elder Yin gestured to Li Shiming as they exited the cave dwelling. His residence wasn't far from Elder Luo's, both located at the summit of the central peak.

The fact that Master Luo could maintain a temporary cave dwelling at the summit of the central peak among the Nine Peaks was partly due to the Tianhai Sect's high regard for her, and partly repayment for the crucial intelligence she had provided about the Northern Shu Mingxin Sect. This information had allowed the Tianhai Sect to make preparations in advance.

Entering another cave dwelling, Li Shiming found it similar in layout to Master Luo's, though with more personal touches. After all, this was Elder Yin's long-time residence, where various less important items served as decorations.

"Shiming, although you've received Luo Daoyou's approval, you'll still need to make your own way to the Thousand Illusions Sect in Northern Shu," Elder Yin said slowly after inviting Li Shiming to sit.

"How is that possible?" Li Shiming couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. He was well aware of the dangers of the North Sea—even Golden Core cultivators couldn't claim absolute certainty in crossing it. The North Sea was home to numerous sea beasts of Golden Core strength, and rumors even spoke of Nascent Soul-level sea beasts appearing.

Even without encountering Golden Core-level sea beasts, dealing with lower-level ones wouldn't be easy. Some lower-level sea beasts existed in astonishing numbers in the ocean and were highly aggressive—so much so that even stronger sea beasts would avoid them. For a Qi Refinement cultivator like Li Shiming, attempting to cross the North Sea would be tantamount to suicide.

"Of course, I'm not suggesting you charge recklessly across the North Sea," Elder Yin explained with a smile. "Every three years, the Northern Shu Trading Company conducts material exchanges with our seven sects. In about half a year, their fleet should arrive. You'll travel to Northern Shu aboard one of their flying boats. I'll make the arrangements."

The Tianhai Island, where the seven sects were located, was geographically part of Northern Shu, though quite distant from the mainland. However, the island's unique location produced special resources, which the Northern Shu Trading Company—the largest trading company in Northern Shu—naturally harvested periodically.

Li Shiming hadn't expected to hear about the Northern Shu Trading Company again so soon, especially since he had just obtained their jade token—equivalent to a bank card in his previous life.

As Li Shiming left Elder Yin's cave dwelling, he saw a familiar graceful figure.

"Lan'er," he called softly.

Yin Shilan walked quietly to his side, her eyes filled with reluctance.

She had learned from her teacher that Li Shiming had gained the qualifications to join the Thousand Illusions Sect. In return, she had to honor her promise to her teacher and accompany her to Northern Shu immediately.

She understood that her teacher had stayed in the Tianhai Sect for her sake. Given her teacher's aversion to trouble, she wouldn't have remained if not for Yin Shilan's persistence. Whether out of commitment or gratitude, she had to leave with her teacher.

"I'll come find you," Li Shiming said with forced cheerfulness, though his heart was equally heavy with reluctance.

"I'll wait for you," Yin Shilan replied softly, her voice barely above a whisper yet filled with determination.

They didn't fly but walked slowly along the mountain path of the central peak, savoring their rare moments alone before parting.

"Lan'er, I painted this for you," Li Shiming said as their time together drew to a close, handing her a scroll.

"I painted one for you too," Yin Shilan replied, her eyes lighting up with joy. Their shared understanding eased the sorrow of parting.

Yin Shilan accepted the scroll and handed him one in return. Li Shiming then soared into the sky, transforming into a streak of sword light as he departed.

Yin Shilan watched until his figure disappeared from sight before finally lowering her gaze and unrolling the scroll. The painting before her was unlike any she had seen in this world, leaving her wide-eyed in disbelief.

The painting depicted their first meeting—her standing on a flying boat, a beam of light piercing through the clouds to illuminate her. This fleeting moment of beauty, Li Shiming's most cherished memory, had been immortalized on the scroll.

What astonished Yin Shilan most was the painting's realism—it was as if the scene from Li Shiming's eyes that day had been perfectly preserved. That first encounter had been recorded in IBMZ15's memory. Li Shiming had created a color printer to reproduce the scene with the highest clarity.

In the lower right corner, a short poem was inscribed:

"Jade boat and lotus sail through rain and mist,  
Crane cries, blue robes, sword as parasol.  
Celestial light graces a face so fair,  
Rather than immortals, lovebirds I'd share."

The poem depicted the scene in the painting and brought a blush to Yin Shilan's cheeks as she recalled the awkwardness of that day.

Back on Eagle Beak Island, Li Shiming unrolled the scroll Yin Shilan had given him. It was a classic ink-wash painting of a young man dancing with his sword in the rain—the same scene from their first meeting, but from Yin Shilan's perspective: the youth raising his sword to block the endless downpour.

Li Shiming carefully stored the scroll in his server room space, placing it in a box reserved for important items.

Two days later, Master Luo departed the Tianhai Sect with Yin Shilan. Li Shiming didn't get the chance to see them off.

He unfolded the map obtained from Golden Core Sword Cultivator Yun Xingyi, which only showed the Hundred Thousand Mountains of Northern Shu. But he knew that beyond those mountains lay the Thousand Illusions Sect.

Uncertain when the False Infant Ancestor from the Northern Shu Mingxin Sect would arrive, Li Shiming couldn't rely solely on the Northern Sea Trading Company. He accelerated his plans, arranging for large quantities of supplies to be transported from the Hidden Dragon Trading Company to Eagle Beak Island.

Meanwhile, within the Profound Darkness Sect, Elder Ren had forced Ren Fei'er into seclusion due to the tense situation. Master Luo's disdain for Elder Ren's identity as a demonic path Golden Core cultivator meant Elder Ren didn't visit her, and without her escort, Ren Fei'er had no chance to enter the Tianhai Sect.

Unexpectedly, Master Luo acted swiftly. Elder Ren had hoped the sisters could meet before departure, but by the time she heard the news, Master Luo had already left with Yin Shilan.

Elder Ren entered the seclusion chamber where Ren Fei'er was slowly opening her eyes. Ren Fei'er's aura had reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement Level Nine—a result achieved through precious spirit medicines and considerable resources. With her cultivation speed, she would soon meet the requirements for attempting Foundation Establishment.

Elder Ren placed great importance on her younger daughter, hoping she would at least have some ability to protect herself before the Northern Sea cultivators' full-scale invasion. That way, even if Elder Ren and Yin Shilan couldn't protect her, Ren Fei'er could fend for herself.

"Mother, you're here! Can I come out now?" Ren Fei'er asked eagerly upon seeing Elder Ren.

Elder Ren shook her head. Ren Fei'er's playfulness worried her—without the seven sects' protection, such recklessness could prove fatal.

"Fei'er, your sister has left with her teacher," Elder Ren said gently, avoiding any lecture.

"Why didn't she say goodbye?" Ren Fei'er had known Yin Shilan would leave but had hoped to use their farewell as an excuse to go out. Now her sister was gone without a word.

"Did she get angry? Did she find out I also like her little brother?" Ren Fei'er muttered to herself.

In her mind, Yin Shilan's silent departure must have been due to anger. Combined with her own secret acquaintance with Li Shiming—kept hidden from everyone—Ren Fei'er felt uneasy. Unable to keep secrets well, she blurted out her hidden feelings upon hearing of Yin Shilan's departure.

Elder Ren was stunned. She had met Li Shiming but never imagined he was the same youth who had dared to draw his sword against her to save Ren Fei'er from countless sea beasts—and also Yin Shilan's beloved.

Despite her demonic sect background and vast experience, Elder Ren found the situation between her two daughters perplexing. She inwardly cursed Li Shiming for winning Yin Shilan's heart while also attracting Ren Fei'er.

First, Elder Ren needed to know how far things had gone between Li Shiming and Ren Fei'er. Though raised in the demonic sect, Ren Fei'er had been overly sheltered and was still young—easy prey for deception.

Or so Elder Ren thought. In truth, Ren Fei'er was quite clever—how else could she thrive in the Profound Darkness Sect, even obtaining treasures from other Golden Core cultivators?

"Fei'er, how far have things gone between you and Li Shiming?" Elder Ren asked sternly, glaring at her daughter.

"What do you mean?" Ren Fei'er asked, confused.

"Have you held hands?" Elder Ren demanded bluntly.

"Does it count if he carried me?" Ren Fei'er asked after some thought.

"That damned little liar! Don't you know how to protect yourself?" Elder Ren raised her hand in anger but couldn't bring herself to strike her daughter, settling for a furious scolding instead.

"I was badly injured by Du Yuan! He had to carry me to escape!" Ren Fei'er explained quickly, seeing her mother's genuine anger, a sly smile playing on her lips.

Elder Ren pointed at her daughter, torn between anger and amusement. It seemed Ren Fei'er's feelings were one-sided, but she still needed to speak with Li Shiming.

"Fei'er, focus on your cultivation. Later, I'll take you to Northern Shu to see your sister," Elder Ren said sternly before leaving.

Alone, Ren Fei'er rested her chin in her hands, her face clouded with worry.

"Did I cause trouble for little brother?" she murmured to herself.

She knew exactly what her mother had been asking about. Aside from their encounter in Southern Mountain Country, she had rarely seen Li Shiming—that had been their closest moment. Given the chance, she would have grown even closer.

"Ah, what am I thinking?" She shook her head vigorously, dispelling her wild thoughts.

Li Shiming never imagined Eagle Beak Island would receive a second Golden Core visitor. He was startled to see Elder Ren.

He didn't know about the relationship between Elder Yin and Elder Ren—a matter known only to Golden Core cultivators within the seven sects, and among Tianhai Sect's upper echelons. Even if acquaintances knew, they wouldn't mention it to him.

Had he known, he might have deduced the relationship between Yin Shilan and Ren Fei'er.

"Boy, we meet again," Elder Ren said coolly, suppressing her anger over her daughters' entanglement.

Li Shiming remained composed, serving Elder Ren spirit tea before standing respectfully, awaiting her instructions. Aware of the seven sects' relationships, he knew Elder Ren held significant influence even as an outsider. Moreover, the sect's formation would have detected her arrival—had it not, the Tianhai Sect's millennia-old protective arrays would have been worthless.

"I came to ask—when will you marry Fei'er?" Elder Ren's blunt question left Li Shiming dumbfounded.

Marry Fei'er? While he held some affection for Ren Fei'er, it stemmed from nostalgia for his past life, unrelated to romance. He had never hinted at anything beyond friendship, treating their interactions like distant chatting—akin to a QQ or WeChat friend in his previous life.

Moreover, though he appeared only a year older than Ren Fei'er, his mental age far exceeded hers when accounting for his past life. Yet with Yin Shilan, age had never been an issue.

"Elder, you must be mistaken. I already have a lover," Li Shiming replied firmly upon regaining his composure.

"What's wrong with Fei'er? Marry her, and I'll help you achieve Foundation Establishment," Elder Ren pressed, her expression unchanging.

"Elder, Fei'er and I are just friends. I must decline," Li Shiming said with a bow, his tone resolute.

"Absolutely refuse?" Elder Ren's expression darkened as her aura bore down on him like a mountain.

Li Shiming's bones creaked under the pressure, his body sinking inches into the ground. Elder Ren had intended to force him to his knees, but his robust physique and her reluctance to harm him resulted in this stalemate.

"You're something else," Elder Ren said finally, torn between pride and frustration over her daughters' predicament. With a final glare, she vanished, leaving behind a bewildered Li Shiming.
