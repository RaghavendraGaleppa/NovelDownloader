# Chapter 326: The Supreme Tomb, The Captured Women, The Flower Thief Li Xian, Saving the Ladies Alone

The snow lay white upon Feilong City, covering the Jiefan Tower where sorrows and worries were dissolved. Suddenly, the heavens collapsed and the earth caved in. Carved beams and painted rafters, famous paintings and calligraphy scrolls, jewels and porcelain, koi fish and jade cups... all were buried beneath the ruins. Seeing the lamps topple, lamp oil spill, and flames spread, the dancing girls fled in panic while distinguished guests scrambled in all directions, creating a scene of utter chaos.

Some were in the midst of spring’s pleasures when disaster struck. Caring for nothing else, they rushed out naked. Cries and screams filled the air, a pitiful sight. The massive tower took a full hour to collapse completely. By the time the front of the tower was gathered by thousands of onlookers, the noise of discussion was endless. Those who escaped felt secretly lucky, while the spectators, though shocked, could not help but sigh with regret.

The tower’s structure was exquisite and magnificent; to be destroyed for no reason was truly a great pity!

Just then, a rush of footsteps sounded. General Yang Xinqiang, along with various sect elders and disciples, rushed to the scene upon hearing the loud noise. Yang Xinqiang’s face was filled with terror, his skin twitching. He had already lost great face today, being rescued from the Silk Net Trap by others. Now hearing this bad news, he was momentarily at a loss, his mind completely blank.

Meanwhile, on the other side...

As the Jiefan Tower collapsed and the ground sank, a deep pit appeared in the earth. The people fell into the pit, plummeting straight down into the depths. The pit was incredibly dark, impossible to see the bottom of. If it were a thousand feet deep, even if one knew lightness skill, a direct fall to the ground would be life-threatening.

Li Xian, Wang Long, Lin Aoshan, and Han Qingxiao desperately used their lightness skills, stepping on falling debris to借力 (borrow force) and leap, slowing their descent. However, the momentum could not be reversed. After struggling for a moment, the four continued to fall. By now, they were a hundred feet deep; the cave was dark and cold, dragging people into the earth.

Han Qingxiao said, "Everyone, try to cling to the cave wall! If we keep falling, we won't know the depth, and we’ll be smashed into meat paste!" He reached out and grabbed a long piece of wood. The cave mouth was wide and deep, and in the darkness, it was hard to distinguish east from west. He paid it no mind and threw the wood straight to one side.

With a "thud," the wood stuck into the stone wall. He leaped toward it, grabbed the wood, and stabilized his body. He immediately looked at his companions, channeling his internal energy to prepare to help.

Lin Aoshan’s lightness skill was agile; she flashed and leaped among the falling wood. Grabbing a red silk ribbon, she tied it to the handle of her knife and threw it straight to the west. The blade embedded in the wall. She grabbed the silk ribbon and drifted along with it, hanging on the wall, breathing a slight sigh of relief.

Wang Long practiced the martial arts of the Quiet Spring Mountain, originating from the Yueshan Sword Sect. Seeing his long sword leave its sheath, he drew a circle with his feet beneath him. He actually stopped instantly, as if standing on solid ground, no longer falling.

This was the "Stillness Contemplating Movement Sword." The sword principle was unfathomable. The sword moves evolved endlessly; with a quiet heart and body, one could remain at ease. He used the sword principle to suspend himself in mid-air, earning the admiration of others.

He paused for a moment, but as his sword momentum dissipated and he was about to fall, he had already spotted a protruding wall. He leaped toward it and stood steadily on the wall. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, then looked at Li Xian.

Han Qingxiao frowned immediately. Lin Aoshan exclaimed, "Big Brother, save him!" As the Jiefan Tower collapsed, countless pieces of wood fell into the pit. Li Xian’s luck was slightly worse; ten or so beams and red tiles... all rushed toward him like a flood.

Han Qingxiao looked around, preparing to find a way way to save him. However, the debris had already enveloped him, rushing downward in a free fall, making rescue impossible. Just as he felt hopeless, a flash of light appeared, and Li Xian had already pierced the wall with his long spear, hanging onto the rock face.

Han Qingxiao muttered, "Golden Light Art? It seems Li Xian is not simple!"

Li Xian stood on the spear shaft and said, "Everyone, are you alright?" Lin Aoshan said, "Naturally. How could mere broken wood and stones hurt this young lady?"

Wang Long and Han Qingxiao reported their safety. The Jiefan Tower’s structure was exquisite and complex; it took a full hour to collapse, and the commotion had just settled. Li Xian focused his gaze and saw a plank path built of red wood in the wall. He immediately thought: *The Jiefan Tower has complex mechanisms. The female heroes of various sects disappeared here without a trace. It must be... that the Jiefan Tower contains mechanisms that secretly transport things to the underground. This is the transport plank path.*

Li Xian shouted, "There is a plank path over there, let's go there!" Everyone used their lightness skills, gliding along the wall, gradually approaching the plank path, and landed safely.

Lin Aoshan patted her chest lightly, a slight sweat on her forehead. The situation had been extremely dangerous, but fortunately, they had all passed through it. Confirming they were unharmed, they followed the plank path deeper into the pit, spiraling down. They walked for nearly half an hour before finally setting foot on solid ground at the bottom of the pit.

Li Xian asked, "Brother Han, I heard you mention the Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴 earlier. Please explain it to us." Everyone looked at him with curiosity. Han Qingxiao said, "The so-called Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴 is an extremely special geomantic tomb穴. Formed by the evolution of nature, this tomb穴 has nine apertures, all of which can be used to enter and exit the tomb."

"This place is one of the apertures. That City Master He was afraid of being discovered, so he built the Jiefan Tower in the aperture. The Jiefan Tower contained 3,800 'Worry-Free' mechanisms, which could eliminate all his worries, allowing him to sleep soundly. Even if a group of experts joined forces to kill him while he was in the Jiefan Tower, it would be hard to do him any harm. He could enter the tower to maneuver or retreat into the aperture."

"The Jiefan Tower... The Jiefan Tower, to dissolve the worries of the world's heroes is false, to dissolve his own worries is true. However, although his calculations were deep, there were shortcomings. The Jiefan Tower relied on the Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴, and its exterior was solid and indestructible. But it was also restricted by the earth穴. If the earth穴 changed, the Jiefan Tower would face the danger of collapse in an instant."

"Thousands of gold and endless effort were destroyed in an instant. The Jiefan Tower seemed solid, yet it was also fragile. It is a pity that this strange tower, though not as good as the 'Hao Jade Thirteen Towers' of Jade City, was still quite impressive. To not fully appreciate it is a pity."

Li Xian thought to himself: *Could it be the work of the Madam? I heard a roar earlier, I don't know if it was an illusion or real. Since we are here, thinking too much is useless!*

Li Xian picked up a piece of red wood and waved it into the empty space. Sparks appeared at the tip of the red wood, gradually igniting into a flame. Han Qingxiao and Wang Long both thought: *Using wood instead of a sword to perform sword moves. The sword technique is as hot as fire, so with a light wave, the tip is ignited. This person’s spear art is formidable, and his sword art is also extraordinary!*

The firelight illuminated the surroundings, probing forward. Li Xian extinguished the firelight immediately and looked for something to block himself. Han Qingxiao, Wang Long, and Lin Aoshan also hid. After a while, they saw a bright light ahead, and someone was walking toward them.

There were four people, all wearing armor, orderly and disciplined. Seeing the mess here, all broken wood and tiles, with the blue sky visible above, they talked: "God, did the Jiefan Tower really... really collapse?" "Unbelievable. If the City Master finds out, he will be furious." "There was an earthquake earlier that shook the Jiefan Tower down. This is so strange. The Jiefan Tower was built by a master craftsman, it shouldn't have collapsed like this."

The four soldiers were about to investigate further.

Li Xian inhaled and exhaled, using "Wind Breath" and "Boiling Qi to Cook the Clear." White mist rolled in, and the surroundings became confused instantly. Before the four soldiers could cry out, Li Xian moved his body and shot out, his fingers pointing at the backs of two soldiers' necks. He used the "Cloud Piercing Hand" acupoint striking technique. The force was heavy yet gentle, penetrating the spine, killing them instantly. Han Qingxiao understood immediately, following closely behind, his claws reaching out to crush the throats of the other two.

In an instant, all four were dead. Wang Long and Lin Aoshan looked puzzled. Han Qingxiao admired him and said, "Brother Li, you have so many tricks! Taking them by surprise, the uses are endless!" He was quite envious. Li Xian said, "They are just minor skills. Brother Han's true talent and learning have likely not been revealed yet."

Li Xian said, "He Wentian keeps soldiers privately in the tomb. If we are exposed and surrounded by heavy troops, the trouble will be huge. So, killing these four and disguising ourselves to infiltrate is best."

Han Qingxiao said, "Aoshan is a woman, but she is tall and has a heroic spirit. Wearing soldier uniforms and mixing with us, we should be able to hide."

The four stripped off the armor and put on the soldier uniforms. They threw the four bodies into the debris to bury them. Lin Aoshan’s pretty face turned red. Wearing men’s clothing, she tied her long hair up and hid it under the helmet. Her beautiful appearance was completely hidden, and her original clothes were stuffed into her outfit.

The four were fully dressed and disguised as patrolling soldiers, moving forward together. They hadn't gone far when they saw a narrow stone gap, only wide enough for one person to pass through sideways. Soldiers guarded both sides. Li Xian was about to make up a story to trick his way in when Lin Aoshan suddenly took a few quick steps, exhaling a breath at the two soldiers. The breath was like light mist, containing a fairy melody. Inhaled through the nose and mouth, and in an instant, they were dazed.

This was the unique martial art of the Qiong Tian Mansion Lin family, called "Fairy Sound Transformation." It starts with a fairy sound in the body, transformed into mist and exhaled. The fairy sound is ethereal, turning solid or misty with miraculous effects.

The two soldiers were instantly dazed, standing still. Li Xian thought to himself: *Although Aoshan’s martial dao is slightly inferior, she has unique methods and can be of great use. The heroes of the world truly cannot be underestimated.* He钻进 (drilled into) the stone gap.

Four or five steps and he was through. He immediately saw a depression ahead, below which was a military camp, brightly lit with lanterns, strict and orderly. There were watchtowers, arrow towers, military tents, and grain depots, with soldiers training in formation. Li Xian and the others had just disguised themselves; if they entered the camp, they would surely reveal flaws. So they bypassed the camp and probed inward. Wearing the soldier uniforms, they crossed unimpeded.

After walking for a while, the patrolling soldiers became fewer. Wang Long looked at Li Xian and Han Qingxiao. Han Qingxiao said, "The armor is heavy and thick. The patrolling soldiers here are already few. Wearing it further will become a hindrance."

Li Xian said, "Makes sense!" The four took off their armor, dug a hole to hide it, and changed back to their own clothes, feeling much lighter. Han Qingxiao told everyone that the inner apertures were complex and winding, and ordinary soldiers could hardly enter. The Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴 had already buried someone, but it was hard to know who was buried. They needed to go deeper to investigate.

Soon they reached a river, not knowing where it came from or where it went. The water flowed slowly, crystal clear, and looked very sweet. Han Qingxiao took out his gold plate again to calculate the situation of what they encountered. He couldn't help but exclaim: "Good tomb! Good tomb!"

Li Xian was skilled in geomancy, but he didn't know this section. He immediately asked: "Brother Han, please explain."

Han Qingxiao said, "This place has been nurtured and catalyzed for an unknown number of years, and it has quite a presence. This river looks ordinary, but it is actually 'Heart's Blood.' It is a natural landscape formed by the natural evolution of heaven and earth. The water is clear, but it contains potent poison. If swallowed, one dies instantly."

"The Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴 is also divided into grades. Having nine apertures but no dragon heart is the lower grade. Having nine apertures and a dragon heart is the middle grade. Above that, through nurturing, evolution, and catalyzing, various strange scenes such as 'Heart's Blood,' 'Flesh Growing on Walls,' and 'Wind in Apertures' gradually appear. This is the supreme grade, the supreme supreme grade, and the supreme supreme supreme grade. We have reached the interior through the aperture. This place is located in the 'Dragon Heart,' where the 'Heart's Blood' landscape has formed. This shows that this Dragon Heart穴 is far stronger than ordinary Dragon Heart穴es, already a supreme dwelling穴. The person buried here is even more extraordinary."

The river had no strange points originally, but after this explanation, it made people curious. Li Xian drew out the "Sinking River Sword" and stirred the water, but he couldn't use the "Manipulating Water" property. Looking at the river's course, it was winding and twisting, with thumb-sized tributaries spreading out, like the meridians and collaterals of the body.

Heaven and earth are endless. The sky is round and the earth is square. The sky is high and infinite, the earth is vast and boundless. Geomancy silently catalyzes and evolves, giving birth to countless magnificent and strange landscapes. The "clear river water" in this Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴, nurtured by heaven and earth, is neither river nor blood. It looks ordinary, but it is actually extraordinary.

Li Xian, Wang Long, Lin Aoshan, and Han Qingxiao each used their lightness skills, leaped over the "Heart's Blood," and walked another mile. Suddenly, they heard a chaotic sound of footsteps, and the ground shook violently.

Li Xian thought: *The soldiers must have noticed, and they are coming to kill us!*

A "whoosh" sound rang out. A dark arrow shot from behind. Li Xian dodged to the side, seeing the arrow coming with fierce momentum, deeply nailing into the rock wall. He thought to himself: *The archer’s arrow skill is not bad. Although not as good as mine, with so many enemies and a barrage of arrows, I would be in a dangerous situation. This tomb is winding; it’s better to avoid the锋芒 (sharp edge).* He shouted: "Run!"

Originally...

The military camp here was called the "Essential Blood Army." It meant the essence and blood of Feilong City. They were all elites, cultivated from childhood, undergoing special medicinal baths and special training. Those with "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" were not few, and those with "Palm Fairy Mechanism" or "Qi Circulating周天" were even more common. They were He Wentian’s trump card means.

When the Jiefan Tower was still standing, if there was an enemy attack. He Wentian only needed to summon the暗哨 (hidden sentries), and the Essential Blood Army would enter the Jiefan Tower via the plank path, hiding in the hidden mechanisms. The military formations and arrow formations would cooperate with the mechanisms inside the tower. Naturally, they were invincible and extremely powerful. Even as strong as Wen Caishang, when she hosted the "Spirit Fox Grand Banquet" in the past, she never set foot in the Jiefan Tower.

He Wentian had made suggestions, but Wen Caishang used the excuse "The youthful spirit should see the sky" to evade. She was not ordinary in her wisdom, but the sect elders had no such worries, leading to the situation today.

The Jiefan Tower collapsed. The Essential Blood Army was strictly on guard. Every half hour, they would check names, organize formations, and wait for orders at any time. Li Xian secretly killed four Essential Blood soldiers, which was naturally hard to hide for long.

They were quickly discovered, and the soldiers immediately pursued and killed, leading to this scene. Although Li Xian’s lightness skill was strong, he was unfamiliar with the tomb paths and was quickly caught up. The two sides engaged in combat.

Li Xian’s long spear shot out from his sleeve like a ghost python, radiating killing intent, stabbing at the elite soldier rushing at him. The soldier wore red armor, was brave and fierce, and dared to take the lead. He naturally possessed considerable abilities. He had already "Consumed Essence to Shed Mortality" and stepped into the first realm of martial dao.

He barely managed to catch a spear. The long knife in his hand snapped with a "bang." Li Xian顺势 (took the opportunity) to sweep the spear shaft, hitting the red-armored soldier in the chest. Li Xian’s waist shook, the spear shaft turned from "hard" to "soft," bending like a wave. The hidden force within instantly blasted him away. The force was so strong, like an arrow leaving the bow. If he hit the rock wall, his internal organs would surely be shattered and his bones broken. Two soldiers behind the red-armored soldier immediately caught him from the left and right. But the force was huge, unstoppable, pushing the three of them flying together.

Following closely, three white-armored soldiers used all their strength to catch them. Now six people’s strength was gathered. Their internal energy flowed, palms against backs, backs against palms, as stable as iron skin, their lives connected, vaguely containing some martial art evolution. The backward flying momentum suddenly decreased. The six people could touch the ground, turning into stepping backward.

Every step left a footprint three inches deep in the mud. The steps were orderly, not chaotic at all! Li Xian thought: *This formation is exquisite, the ability is so strong!*

The six stepped backward together, the momentum still fierce. In the blink of an eye, ten zhang later, they would hit the stone wall. At this moment, six more white-armored soldiers leaped over, reaching out to support the backs of the people in front. The backward momentum decreased again, but it was still hard to stop completely. Finally, twelve more white-armored soldiers came to support them.

Now twenty-four people were gathered, finally slowing the momentum completely. The twenty-four stomped their feet hard, their chests drummed violently, and they let out a "He" sound, completely dissipating the huge force of the spear. Debris fell around, dust filled the air. Everyone felt a sweet taste in their throat. They could hear the soldiers panting, but no one was seriously hurt.

The red-armored soldier’s legs went weak. He leaned on the spear to stand. The twenty-four were both惊 (shocked) and悚 (terrified), looking at Li Xian leaning on his spear. No one dared to approach again. The immense force here was terrifying; how could an ordinary person possess it?

Li Xian frowned and pondered: *What a powerful military formation. My spear strike earlier, although I didn't use any martial art, the force was immense, executed in one breath, and I certainly didn't underestimate the enemy. How could it be blocked so easily? These twenty-four people cooperated to completely dissolve my spear momentum.*

*It was like peeling away layer by layer, stripping away my internal energy, strength... bit by bit.*

This was the "Many People Transforming Origin Formation," evolved from a set of martial arts. By borrowing the momentum of many people, it剖剥 (dissected and stripped) the enemy's internal energy, strength, and martial art evolution, dissolving the mysterious and mysterious momentum. Then it gathered internal energy to resist.

Looking around, similar scenes were happening everywhere. Lin Aoshan used the "Clear Willow Falling Leaf Blade." Her blade technique was elegant, and every strike was something the enemy couldn't block. But the enemy was in the military formation. Knowing they couldn't block it, they would retreat顺势 (with the flow). There would surely be comrades to help them take the impact, dissolving the residual force. Attack and defense alternated, cooperating without gaps, seamless and whole.

Wang Long used the "Dust-Free Sword Art." The sword came out without sound, hiding killing intent. Relying on the sword art's characteristics, he had already killed a red-armored soldier. But when he tried the same trick again, the enemy soldiers all held shields, forming a solid iron ball. They bounced and maneuvered between the rock walls, leaving Wang Long’s sword art helpless!

He was young and inexperienced, with no experience in formation battles. In single combat, he could rely on his natural agility to handle different situations. Now the enemies scattered were ten or more, gathered were a big iron ball. It was hard for him to resist. If his companions weren't here, he would have wanted to use the "Mist and Rain Silk Gauze Step" to escape.

Han Qingxiao used palm techniques. His palm force was thick and heavy, but there was also a corresponding military formation to block. The two sides were locked in a stalemate, the sound of weapons rang out frequently, but neither could do anything to the other.

Originally, He Wentian was deep-thinking and considerate. Fighting on the battlefield was important, but dealing with martial arts experts was also indispensable. The Essential Blood Army had three types: "Red-Armored Elite Soldiers," "White-Armored Followers," and "Black-Armored Strange Soldiers." From childhood, they drank essence soups and did not practice martial arts, only practiced formations.

If separated, the Red-Armored Elite Soldiers were just ordinary people with empty cultivation. If gathered, they could pair up arbitrarily, and the formation would change in an instant, with endless uses. Even if the enemy had higher cultivation, they would be entangled endlessly, captured or taken down, capsizing in the gutter.

Li Xian thought: *Fighting with them is ultimately harmful and useless. Even if we kill them all, we will surely be caught by the pursuing troops. In this situation, it is better to use our advantages to the fullest rather than fight hard!* He said: "Everyone, the situation forces us to act separately!"

Han Qingxiao said: "Great! I was thinking the same thing!" Lin Aoshan laughed: "Good! They have many people. If we scatter, they will surely scatter too, making it much easier to deal with them."

Wang Long struck the iron ball with a sword. The iron ball was composed of black shields. It scattered in the air, and ten Black-Armored Strange Soldiers leaped out. Wang Long said: "I'll go first!" He used lightness skill to leave.

Lin Aoshan said: "Big Brother, Little Li, be careful!" She turned and left. Li Xian thought Lin Aoshan’s strength was slightly weaker. Among the four, she was the hardest to rest assured about. They were old acquaintances and even better friends, so he hurriedly chased after her. He plucked a strand of long hair and said: "Aoshan, keep this hair. If something happens, plant the hair in the ground and speak into it!"

Lin Aoshan saw Li Xian specifically chasing her to give her hair. Although she didn't understand its use, she knew it must be important. Her heart warmed. The friendship from the mansion city remained. She nodded and said: "Okay! Be careful yourself." She hid the hair in her sleeve. There was a fork in the road ahead, and the two parted, going left and right. The pursuing troops paused for a moment and split into two batches to chase.

Li Xian had many pursuers, more than thirty: five Red-Armored Elite Soldiers, five Black-Armored Strange Soldiers, and twenty White-Armored Followers. He used lightness skills to temporarily shake them off, but the pursuers would take other paths,绕路 (detour) to track him, and always catch up.

The power of Li Xian’s spear strike was vivid in everyone's minds. The soldiers were afraid in their hearts and didn't dare to fight hard, only entangling him persistently. But this was exactly what Li Xian wanted: *The way of formations, though vast and profound, is mostly used for surrounding, trapping, fighting, and killing. You persistently entangle me, abandoning the advantages of the formation, using your weaknesses to碰 (collide) with my strengths.*

He巧妙 (cleverly) used the terrain to maneuver, and whenever there was a chance, he struck with killing moves. Spear thrusts, arrow shots, palm techniques... he applied what he learned flexibly. His martial arts were at their peak. The thirty-plus people died one after another, suffering heavy losses. Whenever they wanted to form a formation to fight, Li Xian would already be gone. He was elusive, killing enemies and escaping in a light and easy manner.

Seeing the number of people drop sharply, it was impossible to form a formation anymore. All fled in panic, how dare they entangle him again.

Four Red-Armored Elite Soldiers died, sixteen White-Armored Followers died, three Black-Armored Strange Soldiers died. Li Xian didn't forget to search the bodies. He got several taels of money, 149 "Eagle Feather Arrows," an arrow bag, and a silver bow.

Just before infiltrating the Jiefan Tower, Li Xian had disguised himself as a merchant and didn't carry the Peach Blossom Bow. Now he had a bow and arrows to support him. Even if the soldiers' formations were strong, they could do nothing to him.

The tomb paths were complex. Li Xian摆脱 (shook off) the dangerous situation and wandered around. He knew the "Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴" was extremely complex, like a heart chamber, with thousands of heart paths inside. Just like a person's thoughts, it was changeable and hard to predict.

Li Xian pondered: *For now, only a笨办法 (stupid method) remains. Look around, hoping for a harvest!* He held a strand of long hair. Every time he passed a fork in the road, he would plant a strand of hair. Leaving a感应 (sensing), he gradually explored the situation, bit by bit弄清 (figuring out) the road conditions.

Suddenly, in an instant, he heard a call: "Little Li, Little Li, can you really hear me?"

It was Lin Aoshan speaking. Li Xian wanted to respond, but the hair had no mouth, making communication difficult. He thought: *Aoshan planted hair to transmit sound; she must be in trouble. I will listen carefully!* He focused his mind to sense the hair, vaguely seeing Lin Aoshan in a stone room.

Lin Aoshan’s face was pale, as if she was injured, but the "hair" vision was blurry, and he couldn't see clearly. Originally... when they separated and fled earlier, Lin Aoshan skillfully maneuvered and beat back the pursuers. She accidentally闯进 (rushed into) a dangerous place.

She was injured by the guard. The guard saw she was a woman and didn't kill her. He locked her meridians and internal energy and imprisoned her in a rock wall. Lin Aoshan couldn't resist, was seriously injured and uncomfortable, and believed she couldn't escape. So she remembered Li Xian’s instruction, planted the hair, and whispered to him.

Li Xian frowned and thought: *Aoshan is quite friendly to me. It's rare to have friends in this world. If she is in trouble, how can I not save her?* He sensed the location of the hair and tracked it down.

He was secretly on guard, leaving no traces along the way. The paths of the Nine Apertures Dragon Heart穴 were all gravel paths, turning left and right, winding forward and back. Li Xian followed the sensation and approached the destination.

He saw a stone door ahead. The stone door was thick and heavy, only opening a thin crack. If this door were pushed, the sound would surely be deafening. However, the gap was narrow and hard to pass through.

Li Xian thought for a moment, opened his Heavy Pupil, and looked through the wall to窥探 (spy on) the interior. He immediately saw that behind the stone door was a canyon. It was already night, moonlight shone into the canyon. On the two stone walls, hundreds of stone caves were dug out, and in every cave was trapped a woman.

Quiet Spring Taoist, Ji Hui, Mu Hongchou, Lin Aoshan... were all here. Most of the teachers and disciples of the Hushan Sword Sect, female disciples and female elders of the Five Great Sword Sects... about dozens of people. In the other stone rooms, there were more other women of the martial world who had been captured and imprisoned here.

Quiet Spring Taoist’s face was pale, and her琵琶骨 (collarbones) were pierced. The female elders of the Five Great Sword Sects were in similar situations. There were iron chains in the stone caves, piercing through the琵琶骨, locking the women firmly in the stone caves. If they moved even a fraction, the pain was unbearable.

Only fate plays tricks. Li Xian joined the Flower Cage Sect, and his first business was not capturing people, but saving them. He thought of how heroes save beauties, and beauties repay them with their bodies. He, a flower thief, saves beauties; how should the beauties repay him?
