# Chapter 81: Li Zhengjing Descends the Mountain to Display His Talents! The Grand Elder Resolves to Eliminate His Clan!

A spirit mine mountain is a place where spirit stone veins are concentrated!

Within the territory governed by the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, there are a total of twelve spirit mine mountains.

But in reality, there are thirteen spirit mine mountains, the largest of which is located in the forbidden area of the Immortal Sect's back mountain.

The other twelve spirit mine mountains are located in various directions from the Immortal Sect's mountain gate.

Legend has it that since the founding of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, through three generations of sect leaders, the sect devoted all its efforts to form the twelve spirit mine mountains into a formation, transforming them into an incredibly vast spirit gathering formation, thereby guiding spiritual energy to the location of the Immortal Sect's mountain gate.

It is precisely because of the location of the twelve spirit mine mountains that no external forces are allowed to set foot within a six-thousand-mile radius of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect.

At the beginning of the founding of the Great Zhou Dynasty, this six-thousand-mile area was designated to the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, allowing it to govern itself. Although there were local governments everywhere, from officials to clerks, all came from the Immortal Sect.

The Yu Hua Immortal Sect also gave the Great Zhou Dynasty enough face, and whenever officials were appointed, they would still report to the imperial court. Moreover, all matters within the governed territory, except for matters involving the Immortal Sect itself, were strictly governed in accordance with the laws of the Great Zhou Dynasty.

But in reality, within this six-thousand-mile radius, whether officials or commoners, they only knew the Immortal Sect and did not recognize imperial power, and were only nominally considered the territory of the Great Zhou Dynasty.

"Inspect the spirit mine mountain?" Li Zhengjing pondered for a moment.

"Gu Yue Peak is responsible for inspecting the two spirit mine mountains in the southwest direction," Gao Changhe said. "This kind of thing is usually the responsibility of the inner sect elders, but recently there have been changes in the sect."

"Elder Gu died, Elder Chen Xuan disappeared in Shuangjiu City, and the three elders Zhou, Qian, and Sun, who were originally stationed in Shuangjiu City, were found to have secretly defected to the enemy and have been executed on the spot by the headmaster."

"Now the sect has dispatched thirty-two inner sect elders to Shuangjiu City to replace the previously stationed elders, who have returned to the mountain to accept investigation!"

"In addition, there is the matter of Gu Wang Xin Xuan. After Siyecheng, Elder Zhou Li was once regarded as a traitor to the sect! But after investigation, it was found that Elder Zhou Li had already fallen, and the person who impersonated Elder Zhou Li and intercepted Lu Huaiyuan on that day also used the sect's Taoist techniques."

"Therefore, the elders who were not in the mountain gate on the day of the Siyecheng incident are also undergoing investigation by the Law Enforcement Hall, including Xie Changqing, whom you know..."

Speaking of this, Elder Gao sighed and said, "Xie Changqing is currently the most suspected because he is tight-lipped and doesn't say a word! I don't think it should be him, but he would rather die than speak, almost directly admitting his guilt..."

Li Zhengjing paused for a moment, remembering that when they first met, Xie Changqing paid a lot of attention to the leopard whip and was a little reluctant when he said he would give it to him, and suddenly understood.

"Elder Gao, you can actually check An Hua Lane."

"Lao Xie is an upright person, how could he go to a place like An Hua Lane? Wait... how do you know about An Hua Lane?"

"Elder Gao, what kind of look is that? This disciple is a decent person, how could he have been to such a scandalous place?"

"..."

Gao Changhe pondered for a long time, thinking, "This kid claims to be a decent person, and Lao Xie usually claims to be a gentleman, could it be..."

He sighed and then said, "Forget it! In short, the sect is not peaceful at the moment, and it is said that the Ghost Valley Spirit Official brought back by the headmaster has provided clues to the Ferry Golden Ship, so the sect is preparing for a major event. There are not many people free at the moment, so the matter of inspecting the spirit mine mountain will be left to you, a half-true disciple whose status is equivalent to that of an inner sect elder!"

"This disciple understands."

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin and said, "The elders in the sect are either preparing for battle, being investigated, or investigating those who are being investigated. Therefore, at the moment, within Gu Yue Peak, the most free, the most innocent, and the highest in status, able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the inner sect elders, is only me, Jin Bian Yin Ling Li Zhengjing."

Gao Changhe nodded slightly, then turned and left, thinking to himself, "Logically speaking, what he said is completely correct, but why do I feel like hitting him when I hear it?"

And Li Zhengjing returned to the courtyard.

Yuan Zhengfeng within the remnant jade was silent.

In his current situation, hiding within the remnant jade, between life and death, and not easily exposing his whereabouts, he could not help but feel emotional when he heard the voice of an old friend.

"What does Elder Yuan think of this matter?"

"Gu Yue Peak is, after all, the most prosperous lineage within the Yu Hua Immortal Sect." Yuan Zhengfeng's voice came out, saying, "No matter how urgent it is, it shouldn't be the case that the affairs of the inner sect elders are handed over to a junior who has cultivated for less than a year! Although you have the Jin Bian Yin Ling and are qualified to take on this matter, I think that there are undercurrents surging within Gu Yue Peak, and it is the headmaster who is deliberately promoting it!"

"He is building momentum for me," Li Zhengjing said in a deep voice.

"What is building momentum?" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches, but paused and said, "Actually, grandson understands the principle, just wants to teach Little Duanlang."

"Don't even understand this?" The Wall-Hanging Bird said, "In the future, let Bird Grandpa enlighten Duanlang nephew, teach it to read and write, and be a cultured, polite, and knowledgeable worm, not like you, a crude father!"

"You understand? Then tell me!" Tree Grandpa was unconvinced and almost stretched out its roots to beat the Wall-Hanging Bird.

"Do you know why you build momentum?" The Wall-Hanging Bird said, "It is currently known that Master is the most beloved body of the creditor, but the creditor has more than one spare body!"

"This is like in the harem, there are many concubines of the emperor. Although they love our Master, there are, after all, three thousand beauties in the harem, with many choices."

"Therefore, Gu Yue, this old fellow, is like the little eunuch beside our Master, who has to come up with ideas and build momentum for our Master!"

"This time, building momentum is to let Master do his best, show his talents, and gain the creditor's greatest attention, so as to exclusively favor the harem, making other spare bodies appear to be mediocre!"

Speaking of this, the Wall-Hanging Bird was triumphant, held its head high, and was about to wait for praise, but heard a sentence in its ear.

"Beat it to death!"

Li Zhengjing looked at the Five Elements Creation Tree with a blank expression and said calmly, "After your Yin-Yang is complete, your combat power has greatly increased. Master has not yet seen you fully display your abilities and does not know how deep your accumulation is. Come and show your talents!"

"Okay!"

The Five Elements Creation Tree stepped forward, held down the Wall-Hanging Bird, and beat it violently.

And Duanlang Gu flapped its thin wings and stepped forward to help, biting it from time to time.

"Actually, although this bird's mouth is a bit smelly, what it said is mostly correct." Yuan Zhengfeng said, "The creditor wants an outstanding body, so this time, show a natural talent and make him satisfied!"

"Work hard to make myself the shape that the creditor is satisfied with?" Li Zhengjing smiled, his eyes gradually turning cold, and whispered, "And then kill him?"

"This day will not be too long." Yuan Zhengfeng said in a muffled voice, "From the time I noticed the clues to the final abandonment of my body, I waited for more than forty years and slept for more than ten years! And this time, you only need to wait a few more days!"

"Gu Yue Peak Master mentioned within ten days," Li Zhengjing said. "It's only the third day now, which means... the remaining few days are all for preparation?"

"A few days is worth waiting for." Yuan Zhengfeng said in a low voice, "According to what Gu Yue Peak Master said, today... should be the day the creditor reappears."

"Then it's not too late, let's go down the mountain!"

Li Zhengjing packed up his things and put them into the paulownia wood box.

He carried the Dragon Pattern Evil-Suppressing Saber on his back and went straight down the mountain towards the spirit mine mountain.

At the same time, on Gu Yue Peak.

The Inner Sect Grand Elder came out of seclusion once again.

This time, his seclusion was not long, but he had obviously gained something and looked quite high-spirited.

But the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall came to his residence.

"Grand Elder Chen Zhu, this time you are so happy after secluding yourself again. It seems that you have gained the key to it. Presumably, the next time you seclude yourself, you will transcend the mundane, break through the Human Immortal realm, and be above the world, right?"

"Head of the Law Enforcement Hall, are you here to congratulate me?"

Chen Zhu's eyes were unkind, because in the past, he and the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall were not on good terms.

The reason was still Yuan Zhengfeng. In the past, he used the power of the Law Enforcement Hall to make the Chen clan suffer a lot.

And the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall strongly supported Yuan Zhengfeng.

Even the year he was punished to face the wall in the back mountain, it was Yuan Zhengfeng who reported him, and the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall personally issued the punishment document.

"It can also be regarded as coming to congratulate you."

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall said calmly, "This time, the Headmaster personally went to Shuangjiu City, fought one against three, and suppressed and killed the three helmsmen of the Ferry Golden Ship, brought back the Ghost Valley Spirit Official, and learned many secrets of the Ferry Golden Ship, thus making great contributions! And in this meritorious service, the Headmaster only asked the main peak hall for one thing..."

He looked at Chen Zhu and said slowly, "Passed down by successive headmasters, the Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed is borrowed from Gu Yue Peak and returned after a hundred days!"

Chen Zhu's eyes were bright, and there was a slight tremor in his expression.

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall continued, "The Headmaster intends to lend you the Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed for ten days to help you break through the Human Immortal realm, and has reported to the main peak hall to promote you to the Mountain-Suppressing Elder of Gu Yue Peak, whose status is second only to the Supreme Elder of the main peak hall!"

Speaking of this, the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall said calmly, "But there is one thing that the Headmaster is very unhappy about, and there is also discussion in the main peak hall."

"What is it?"

Chen Zhu looked solemn and asked.

"Before the fall of the Chen family's ancestor, he was in the Human Immortal realm and was the Supreme Elder of the Immortal Sect."

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall said, "Later, the Chen family's ancestor fell, and the Chen clan was deeply favored by the Immortal Sect, but in recent years, relying on the blessings of the Chen family's ancestor, they have been too flamboyant and domineering, causing dissatisfaction among many elders and disciples within the sect!"

"If you are promoted to the Mountain-Suppressing Elder of Gu Yue Peak in the future, or even become the Supreme Elder in the future, then the Chen clan may be arrogant and boundless!"

"The Chen clan has its own family rules, but as members of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, they should know the sect's regulations and laws."

He looked solemn and said in a deep voice, "The Immortal Sect's importance to the Chen clan cannot become a reliance above the sect's laws! And the Grand Elder is about to be promoted, so he must not encourage this kind of arrogance..."

"I understand."

Chen Zhu said, "From today onwards, I will be stricter and restrain the Chen clan, and not allow them to overstep the sect rules in the slightest!"

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall said slowly, "Not only that, but those who have violated the sect rules in the past should all be punished!"

Chen Zhu paused and saluted, "Everything will be handled by the Law Enforcement Hall!"

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall shook his head slightly upon hearing this.

Chen Zhu hesitated and said, "What does this mean?"

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall smiled and said, "The Grand Elder is about to break through the Human Immortal realm and be promoted to the Mountain-Suppressing Elder, second only to the Headmaster. In the future, you may be promoted to the Supreme Elder, so you should cherish your reputation! If the Law Enforcement Hall takes action and punishes the Chen clan, it will be your old face that is lost!"

Saying that, the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall sighed, "To put it another way, these things were all committed in the past, and the days have been constantly going on until now. Now, to pursue the responsibility, it seems that my Law Enforcement Hall has been ineffective in the past, which is also inappropriate!"

Chen Zhu was silent for a long time and said, "I will personally deal with them?"

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall waved his hand and said, "They are, after all, disciples and even elders of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect. If you deal with them, wouldn't that be using family rules to override the sect rules?"

Chen Zhu was slightly shocked, looked up, and said, "What does this mean?"

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall leaned slightly to the side, said a word in his ear, and then took a step back and smiled, "This is the face that the Headmaster gives to your Chen clan. You should always cover up the ugly places, so that there will be no stains when you are promoted in the future."

Chen Zhu paused and said, "Borrowing a knife to kill someone? But this knife seems too new. Aren't you afraid that this time, the knife will break?"

The Head of the Law Enforcement Hall said slowly, "This knife is highly valued. If this matter is successful, he will be the mainstay of Gu Yue Peak in the future! But if the knife is cut out and breaks, it is just a pity and not enough to be truly valued..."

He looked at Chen Zhu and said with a smile, "Borrowing a knife to kill someone, if they die, your face can be preserved! And if the knife breaks, you can personally go and kill your relatives righteously in the name of murdering fellow disciples, and still preserve your face!"

"I understand."

Chen Zhu nodded slightly, watching the Head of the Law Enforcement Hall leave.

His eyes flickered, and he finally whispered, "This is because they feel that my Chen clan's wings are too full, so they want me to cut off some... In this way, even if I break through the Human Immortal realm in the future, I will only be alone, with no one available, and I will not be able to compete for the power of the various places belonging to Gu Yue Peak."

He clenched his palms, took a deep breath, and said, "But as long as I can break through the Human Immortal realm, it is more important than anything else! Even if there is no power, even if I just sit high on Gu Yue Peak as a mountain-suppressing stone, what does it matter? The Human Immortal realm... is actually the most unshakable power!"

He thought of the Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed, thought of breaking through the Human Immortal realm, and his heart could not help but be excited and boiling.

But then he thought of the past, vaguely anticipating this situation, and had always been indifferent to the Chen clan, alienating the clansmen and descendants, but it was still inevitable to have today's choice.

Thinking like this, he reached out and beckoned, and a light came into his hand.

And he moved his mouth slightly towards the light, said a few words, but no sound came out.

His voice was sealed in this light, and then he threw it, and the light turned into a flying bird and flew straight out of the mountain gate.

"Yuan Zhengfeng was right to ask me to restrain my clansmen back then!"

Chen Zhu said this, sighed, and muttered to himself, "It would be great if he were alive, so that he could watch me break through the Human Immortal realm, become the Mountain-Suppressing Elder, and crush him, a mere True Qi realm elder, at will, suppressing him so that he could never turn over!"

At this moment, Li Zhengjing, who was down the mountain, stopped.

The remnant jade hanging under the Five Elements Creation Tree suddenly had a voice.

"Little friend Zhengjing, be careful, I vaguely sensed a malice just now."

"I also felt a malice, it seems to be behind."

Li Zhengjing said this, turned around to look, and saw a person chasing after him on the road behind him.

Seeing Li Zhengjing, the person showed a smile and waved his hand quickly.

"Fake medicine peddler!" Li Zhengjing sighed, "This person is full of malice towards my money bag."

"Senior Brother Zhengjing, long time no see!"

The fake medicine peddler came closer and said in a low voice, "I just came back from the mountain and was about to send you the medicine cauldron when I heard that you were going down the mountain to inspect the spirit mine mountain! I have a map of the spirit mine mountain here, with extremely secret trails drawn on it, which can help you make contributions this time..."

He looked around and whispered, "One price, five thousand taels!"

Li Zhengjing said with a blank expression, "One thousand taels."

The fake medicine peddler waved his hand quickly upon hearing this.

Li Zhengjing was silent for a moment and said, "Nine hundred taels... eight hundred taels... seven hundred taels..."

"Just one thousand taels!"

The fake medicine peddler reached into his arms, took out a map, and handed it over.

The money and goods were cleared, and they parted ways.

The fake medicine peddler turned around and headed towards the sect.

Li Zhengjing put away the map, but heard a voice in his ear.

"A long time ago, I saw him!"
