# Chapter 6: Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Body! The Yellow Maple Valley Friendship Plan!

After Lin Yun and Han Li returned, Han Li noticed the two remaining members of their small group.

Lin Yun introduced them, "These two are Wu Jiuzhi from Cloud Gate Ravine and Huang Xiaotian from Stone Valley."

The pair were easily distinguishable—one a skinny youth, the other a plump man.

Han Li nodded. "I'm Han Li. Pleased to meet you both."

Wu Jiuzhi, eager to showcase his pickpocketing skills, attempted to demonstrate on Han Li but was caught red-handed, earning himself a round of mockery from the group. After all, theft wasn't exactly honorable.

However, when Lin Yun spoke up, everyone quieted down—even the portly cultivator at the same tenth level of Qi Refinement showed him marked respect. Observing this, Han Li realized that despite being of equal cultivation level, Lin Yun's strength surpassed the other man's.

"So the immortal cultivation world isn't so different from the mortal martial world—only the strong command respect," Han Li thought wryly, casting a sidelong glance at Lin Yun. "But Brother Lin truly seems like a warm-hearted person."

Han Li found himself growing fond of Lin Yun's character.

As the group of rogue cultivators chatted, Han Li seized the opportunity to voice his confusion. "Brother Lin, earlier when you were talking with that young man, you mentioned something about an Ascension Assembly. What is that? Isn't this the current Tai Nan Gathering?"

The term had come up in conversations with Wan Xiaoshan too, hinting at its importance, but Han Li had never learned the details.

"Wait, you don't know about the Ascension Assembly?" Hei Mu exclaimed, equal parts shocked and excited. "It's a once-in-a-decade event in Yue Country—the best chance for young cultivators to join major sects!"

"Brother Han is still young and must have been cultivating in seclusion elsewhere. It's understandable he wouldn't know," Lin Yun interjected, defending Han Li.

Lin Yun then explained the connection between the Ascension Assembly and Foundation Establishment Pills, detailing the assembly's brutal competition and the pills' critical importance—so vital they were nicknamed "Ascension Pills."

[Ding! Host has enlightened Han Li about the Ascension Assembly, broadening his horizons. "Cast your bread upon the waters" effect triggered.]

[Ding! Congratulations, Host has obtained a top-tier defensive artifact: Giant Tortoise Shield.]

[Artifact Description: Crafted by Han Li from a fourth-grade turtle demon's shell during his artifact-forging practice at Green Bamboo Pavilion.]

"What a treasure! A shield forged from a fourth-grade turtle demon's shell!" Lin Yun rejoiced inwardly. "This is among the very best defensive artifacts possible!"

Now equipped with Cloud Treading Boots for mobility, attack talismans previously acquired from Han Li, and this supreme defensive artifact, Lin Yun had achieved a perfect balance of offense and defense. He did once possess a top-tier flying sword too, but alas, he'd gifted it away.

After more conversation, the group dispersed to rest.

Back in his room, Lin Yun activated several restriction talismans, sealing the space around him. With a long exhale, he calmed his racing heart—today's gains had been immense.

First, he produced the Primordial Immortal Artifact: Mystic Heaven Gourd obtained from Han Li. The small jade-green gourd rested innocuously in his palm.

"This is an item Han Li acquired in the True Immortal Realm—far surpassing the likes of the Mystic Heaven Severing Spirit Sword from the lower realm," Lin Yun mused, turning it over. "A true treasure, though unusable for now. And it's best not to employ it carelessly in this realm—as a Primordial Immortal Artifact, it would be damaged by dimensional forces, just like Han Lao Mo's Mystic Heaven Sword shattered upon ascension."

Primordial Immortal Artifacts, or Mystic Heaven Objects, absorbed the laws of their native dimension. Removed from it, they suffered suppression from dimensional forces.

"Unleashing this gourd's full power here is near impossible, but borrowing a fraction of its abilities poses no issue," Lin Yun concluded. "An ultimate trump card for later. For now, store it away."

Next came five spirit stones of different colors. Lin Yun selected the vibrant emerald one, cradling it for inspection. The stone pulsed with living light, its surface shimmering with indistinct white specks too minute for his current cultivation to discern clearly. The moment the supreme-grade spirit stone appeared, spiritual energy flooded the room.

"Must secure this immediately. Discovery would mean certain death!" Lin Yun hastily stored it in his system inventory.

---

Lin Yun then produced several storage pouches, running his fingers over the talismans within with satisfaction. "Finally, I'm rolling in wealth! With these, even Foundation Establishment cultivators are within my grasp!"

A decade of insecurity—of weak cultivation, inferior artifacts, and scarce talismans—had left him perpetually fearing for his life. Now, that fear eased somewhat.

He secured the pouches inside his robe for quick access—a flick of wrist or sleeve would deploy the talismans instantly.

Next came a black triangular token. One side bore the golden ancient seal script characters for "Ascension," the other a silver "Order." Despite its non-metallic appearance, it had substantial heft.

Thanks to the system, Lin Yun knew this was the Yellow Maple Valley Ascension Token. Even without it, he'd planned to join the sect through the Ascension Assembly—both to follow Han Lao Mo and to target another individual: the Human Realm's Divine Transformation expert, Xiang Zhili!

"If he wants to pose as a Qi Refinement cultivator, let's see if I can't milk him dry!" Lin Yun grinned. "Once in Yellow Maple Valley, making friends far and wide will fill my coffers. No more scraping by!"

The sect's little lambs had better be ready—Uncle Lin was coming to befriend them!

Stowing the token, Lin Yun produced his sole treasure talisman, murmuring, "Long time no see..."

"And then there's my defective Pseudo Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Body. What exactly does it do? How do I generate the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light? Need to figure that out ASAP."

The mystery of his constitution gave him headaches. Why did everything else come with explanations except this?

"Damn it! Why couldn't it be a proper Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Body? Why 'pseudo'?" The injustice made his teeth itch.

"Ah well, compared to my past life as a wage slave, having a cheat this time is blessing enough," Lin Yun consoled himself. "Chin up! While Han Lao Mo's still green, squeeze more treasures out of him!"

Rummaging through his pouch, he unearthed a dust-covered copy of the Evergreen Art. "Tomorrow's the day!"

Just as Lin Yun plotted how to "gift" the manual to Han Li for system rewards, a notification chimed in his mind.

[Ding! Host has reached eligible age. Unlocking Pseudo Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Body instructions.]

[Instruction: Host must achieve intimate relations with female cultivators to absorb their yin energy, thereby activating the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Body to produce Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light.]

Lin Yun's face darkened. "System, are you even serious? Why didn't you say so earlier?!"

[Ding! Under Harmonious Dao Ancestor's supervision: No lewdness before legal age!]
