# Chapter 56: Excavation  

"Scattering Beans to Form Soldiers" is a wood-element divine ability.  

Coincidentally, Zhang Yan's Wood Elemental Technique had already reached perfection.  

According to the Water Elemental Scripture, when the Water Elemental Technique is perfected, one can comprehend the Dao's resonance during Foundation Establishment, transforming it into the divine ability known as Water Spirit Technique. This Water Spirit Technique can simulate water-element divine abilities.  

By the same logic, mastering the Wood Elemental Technique should allow it to evolve into the Wood Spirit Technique, capable of simulating wood-element divine abilities.  

However, simulation is still just simulation—it can never match the full power of the original divine ability.  

But now, Zhang Yan had discovered that he could directly comprehend others' divine abilities.  

This meant that after his Foundation Establishment, the power of his simulated divine abilities would be significantly enhanced. While others might only achieve 60% of the original divine ability's strength through Wood Spirit Technique simulation, he could reach 70%, 90%, or even 100%.  

"However, comprehending others' divine abilities requires spiritual artifacts. Magical artifacts don't seem to have divine ability inscriptions."  

He had encountered magical artifacts used by Foundation Establishment cultivators before, but unfortunately, none of them bore divine ability inscriptions—only spell inscriptions.  

"Is it because magical artifacts are of too low a grade to support such inscriptions?" Divine abilities, after all, stem from observing the resonance of the Dao in heaven and earth.  

If the material of a magical artifact is too inferior, it might indeed be incapable of bearing divine ability inscriptions.  

"If that's the case, then I need to expedite my search for the Metal Elemental Technique."  

Zhang Yan possessed three spiritual roots within him: metal, wood, and water. Currently, he had already mastered the Water Elemental Technique and the Wood Elemental Technique, leaving only the Metal Elemental Technique unlearned.  

Now that he knew he could comprehend others' divine abilities, mastering all elemental techniques became a necessity.  

He even entertained the thought of learning the Fire Elemental Technique, Earth Elemental Technique, and all other elemental techniques.  

Though he lacked the corresponding spiritual roots and thus wouldn't receive any bonuses when casting those spells, it didn't matter—geniuses could afford to be capricious. If he was going to learn, he might as well go all out.  

"But what about this thing?" Zhang Yan looked at the tiny rice figurine in his hand. It was far too weak—a single punch from an opponent would probably make it cry for ages.  

Normally, spells like "Scattering Beans to Form Soldiers" would cause the bean soldiers to revert to seeds once their spiritual energy was depleted. Before that, they could act according to the caster's will.  

"Come to think of it, this is still a plant, right? What would happen if I used the Wood Elemental Technique to accelerate its growth?"  

A spark of inspiration flashed in Zhang Yan's eyes.  

He immediately sat cross-legged and began restoring his spiritual energy. He wanted to test whether the Wood Elemental Technique could enhance the rice figurine.  

Once his energy was replenished, he began his experiment.  

---  

Zhang Yan held the rice figurine in his hand and activated the Wood Elemental Technique.  

As his spiritual energy surged, the rice figurine in his palm began to grow stronger—visibly so.  

Its size remained unchanged, but Zhang Yan keenly noticed that its aura had intensified.  

"It works!"  

Delighted by the results, Zhang Yan's eyes gleamed.  

He continued channeling the Wood Elemental Technique, and the rice figurine grew increasingly robust, its aura steadily rising.  

Eventually, it reached a strength equivalent to the fifth or sixth layer of Qi Refining.  

"That's the limit."  

Once the rice figurine reached the sixth layer of Qi Refining, it could grow no stronger. Further applications of the Wood Elemental Technique had no effect.  

"Not bad. Though this thing is seriously ugly!"  

Zhang Yan examined the rice figurine. Since its size hadn't increased—only its muscles had bulked up—it now looked rather grotesque.  

"Let's test its combat ability."  

With a flick of his finger, a sword qi shot through the air, slashing toward the rice figurine.  

*Clang!*  

The rice figurine didn't dodge. Instead, it simply raised its hand, and its wooden structure rapidly expanded, forming a shield.  

The terrifying sword qi struck the shield, leaving only a deep gash.  

"Interesting."  

"Now, you try attacking."  

The sword qi Zhang Yan had just unleashed was channeled through his Golden Bamboo Sword, equivalent to an ordinary sixth-layer Qi Refining strike.  

Yet, the rice figurine had blocked it effortlessly.  

"Show me your skills."  

The rice figurine didn't speak—it couldn't—but it immediately plunged its hands into the ground and heaved.  

Instantly, a swarm of uprooted trees surged toward Zhang Yan, entangling him.  

"Not bad."  

Watching the incoming vines, Zhang Yan narrowed his eyes and flicked his wrist. Sword light flashed, slicing through the vegetation.  

*Swish! Swish! Swish!*  

Several wooden spears shot toward him.  

"More?"  

Zhang Yan raised an eyebrow and drew a flying sword, deflecting the spears with ease.  

"Impressive!"  

As the rice figurine exhausted its spiritual energy and reverted to a seed, Zhang Yan nodded in satisfaction.  

"Defensive and offensive capabilities are both decent for the mid-stage of Qi Refining. The only drawback is that it can only cast a few spells before running out of energy."  

Picking up the seed, he examined it briefly before tossing it aside.  

The silly bird that had been frightened earlier immediately swooped down and swallowed it whole.  

Despite its earlier scare, the sight of food had instantly revived it.  

"Though the rice figurine has its limitations, it can last for several days without casting spells. Making a few more could serve as a decent trump card."  

Zhang Yan was quite pleased with this watered-down version of the "Scattering Beans to Form Soldiers" divine ability.  

After studying the divine ability, he turned his attention to the other skill inscribed on the Broken Jade Hoe: Sharpness (Lv. 3).  

He had encountered several pieces of equipment with Sharpness enhancements before, but all of them had been at Lv. 1.  

"What's the difference between Lv. 3 Sharpness and Lv. 1?"  

Pondering this, he retrieved a piece of ironwood—a material known for its hardness, often used in crafting magical artifacts. It was perfect for testing sharpness.  

First, he lightly struck the ironwood with his Golden Bamboo Sword, leaving a shallow scratch less than half a centimeter deep.  

"Now, with Lv. 1 Sharpness."  

Another strike, this time leaving a three-centimeter gash.  

Expressionless, Zhang Yan swung once more.  

*Sssshhk!*  

The sword cleaved straight through the ironwood, splitting it in two.  

"This power!"  

Staring at the severed ironwood, Zhang Yan's eyes widened in disbelief.  

This was ironwood!  

And he hadn't even used any spiritual energy—just the raw sharpness of the Golden Bamboo Sword.  

"Lv. 3 Sharpness is this much stronger than Lv. 1?"  

"No wonder the Equipment Interface distinguishes between them."  

Zhang Yan sighed in amazement.  

If he equipped six items with Lv. 3 Sharpness in his Equipment Slots, even late-stage Qi Refining cultivators would likely struggle against him in a real fight.  

"I remember Master mentioning that there's an auction being held nearby..."
