# Chapter 199: The House of Rejuvenation  

Spring blossomed with warmth, all things in nature chasing after joy in their own way.  

Xiao Ji, too, began his own pursuit.  

One early morning, he departed from the Primal Divinity Temple, heading toward Pengu County in the Great Li Kingdom. His destination was the residence of an unorthodox physician—a man who possessed the needle used to trim the wick of the Glazed Immortal Lantern. The target, the location, and even the timing had all been carefully considered. Before setting out, Xiao Ji had consulted the almanac, ensuring the stars were aligned.  

He was certain that with perfect timing and execution, success was inevitable.
