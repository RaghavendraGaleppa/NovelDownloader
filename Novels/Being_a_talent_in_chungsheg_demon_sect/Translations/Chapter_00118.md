Chapter 118: The Sacred Sect Truly Produces Talents in Abundance

The formation in the wilderness was not particularly advanced. Lu Yang glanced at it and saw that it wasn't even seventh-rank. Its effects were limited to aura-sensing and manifestation.

Rather than being designed for self-protection, this formation seemed intended for seeking out enemies.

Lu Yang didn't deliberately conceal his Qi presence, so the moment he and Qin Tianhe arrived, the formation immediately activated, projecting a beam of light towards them.

At the same time, dozens of gazes fell upon Lu Yang.

Lu Yang's eyebrows twitched slightly at the sight. He noticed that the owners of these gazes seemed very different from the Sacred Sect disciples he had met in the Heaven-Connecting Cloud Sea.

Their eyes held scrutiny, wariness, and even fierceness… but no fear.

However, Lu Yang quickly understood.

This was normal.

On the battlefields of good and evil, there weren't so many rules. It was common for Foundation Establishment cultivators to bully Qi Condensation cultivators, disregarding all martial ethics. Those who harbored fear would have died long ago.

What remained were a bunch of incredibly audacious individuals.

Lu Yang's gaze swept over them, and he even saw many disciples silently taking pills, regulating their breath, and tending to their injuries, yet showing no complaints or despondency.

Occasionally, he overheard conversations where familiar faces were mentioned as having been surrounded and killed. These Sacred Sect disciples didn't seem to care at all, some even mockingly laughing.

Clearly, regarding the Sacred Sect being jointly besieged by the Dao Court and the Pure Land, let alone the True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue outside, even the Sacred Sect disciples themselves didn't particularly mind. Being killed only meant insufficient strength. "Look at us," they seemed to imply, "aren't we, the truly strong ones, carving out a path to survival?"
"If you're weak, practice more. If you can't handle it, don't play."

On the other side, Qin Tianhe also looked accustomed to the scene. He casually beckoned a Sacred Sect disciple over and asked, "Where's Xu Xin? Is he still alive?"

"...He's still alive."

The disciple replied, leading them deeper into the formation. There, a handsome, bright-eyed youth was waving his arms at the crowd:

"Everyone, we should unite!"

"Two True Disciples have already been killed. If we don't band together now, we'll only be picked off one by one. Do you want to die in this wretched place?"

"If you don't want to die, then accept my leadership!"

"As long as you follow my commands, we can at least save thirty percent of our numbers. And I believe all Sacred Sect disciples are my brothers, surely willing to cooperate with me—"

Before the youth could finish speaking, a late-stage Qi Condensation disciple suddenly interjected with disdain, "Listen to your leadership? Where do you put Senior Brother Chongming? Senior Brother Chongming is Uncle-Master Chongguang's direct descendant, and his strength is beyond doubt. If anyone is to lead, it should be him—"

*Pfft!*

Before the disciple could finish his sentence, a palm had already struck his chest, sending him flying sideways. He landed, coughing up blood incessantly.

Having done all that, the youth calmly wiped his hands:
"Those unwilling to cooperate are not my brothers."

"Xu Xin, you're looking for death!"

On the other side, a spirited young man instantly flew into a rage. A sword pellet appeared out of thin air, erupting into a magnificent sword rainbow that swept towards the youth.

"Young master, others might indulge you, but do you think I will?"

Xu Xin's figure instantly vanished, dodging the sword light. He then confronted the youth named Chongming, murder glinting in his eyes.

Meanwhile, the two people nearby seemed completely unfazed, instead revealing excited smiles as if watching a show.

"...Everyone, stop!"

Qin Tianhe immediately roared, then without another word, he stepped aside, placing Lu Yang in front of him: "Before a True Person, who dares to be insolent!?"

At these words, the atmosphere abruptly shifted.

"A True Person? Impossible!"

"Tianhe? Are you joking?"

"Who is the True Person?"

In an instant, all eyes turned to Lu Yang, initially carrying a hint of scrutiny, but soon undergoing a subtle change.

Especially Xu Xin, whose expression subtly shifted.

He had met Lu Yang once before with Qin Tianhe and had personally witnessed Lu Yang calming the Shouheng Sea with a single burst of Qi. Naturally, he was utterly shocked now.

It's really a damn Foundation Establishment cultivator!?

Thinking this, Xu Xin immediately reined in his spiritual energy, then walked respectfully to Lu Yang: "Disciple Xu Xin greets the Sacred Sect's High True One."

Although the others had not met Lu Yang, they weren't blind. Even though Lu Yang wasn't currently enhancing himself with the Goddess's power, the accumulated prestige of his grand divine abilities still put him far out of their reach. They had only felt a similar presence from the strongest of the True Disciples.

Immediately, the atmosphere eased considerably.

Meanwhile, Lu Yang looked at the handsome youth who had just been confronting Xu Xin. Surprisingly, he had actually met the other person once before.

But not in this life, rather in the life before last.
*'Back then, I went to the Law Refining Secret Realm to cultivate the Saint's Plunder. A True Disciple was there before me, but he failed to cultivate it—that True Disciple was him!'*

Chongming, True Person Chongguang's son?

Before arriving, Qin Tianhe had briefly introduced him to the True Disciples participating in this Battle for the Dao, including their personalities.

According to Qin Tianhe, although Chongming was True Person Chongguang's son, he hated being called a "second-generation immortal" and always sought to cultivate on his own, publicly proclaiming that he would surpass True Person Chongguang through his own efforts and talent. Regarding this, most True Disciples of the Sacred Sect had only one evaluation:
An enviably foolish individual.

Next, he looked at Xu Xin. Without a doubt, this was a smiling tiger—one moment calling you brother, the next physically assaulting you.

Moreover, this person's audacity was off the charts.

After all, Chongming was a direct descendant of a Great True Person at Foundation Establishment Completion, yet Xu Xin dared to publicly defy him and even harbor killing intent while acting.

To describe him as a madman was not an exaggeration.

As for the two True Disciples who had not spoken from the beginning and were simply watching the show, they were a man and a woman.

The man had no given name; even Qin Tianhe only knew his Daoist title, "Jiaolong" (Flood Dragon). The woman's name was Bi Feiyan, a True Disciple from Butian Peak.

Being able to escape the encirclement, their strength was naturally not weak.

Daoist Jiaolong hailed from Huanyao Peak, one of the four inner peaks.

His greatest dream in life was to transform himself into a dragon. Therefore, after joining Huanyao Peak, he almost daily transplanted demonic beast parts onto himself.

According to him, a true dragon has nine forms. Therefore, if he could gather all nine types of demonic beasts representing the nine forms of a true dragon onto himself, he could then break through Foundation Establishment and transform into a true dragon. Thus, beneath his seemingly normal body were actually components of various demonic beasts.

A typical lunatic.

As for Bi Feiyan, she was equally renowned.

Outwardly, Bi Feiyan was a beautiful woman in her late teens, her voluptuous figure clad only in a thin veil, her crimson allure clearly visible beneath.

If it were just this, it wouldn't be much.

Butian Peak, after all, was known for its unique cultivation methods.

What truly made her stand out among countless Sacred Sect disciples and ascend to True Disciple status was a grand divine ability she primarily cultivated, named "Sowing Demonic Hearts in the Sea of Desire."

As the name implied, this grand divine ability would cause anyone who harbored lustful thoughts towards her to suffer Qi deviation.

So, whenever Bi Feiyan fought, despite dressing so scantily, her first action was to brazenly tear off her clothes and then battle her enemies bare-chested.

The effect was a powerful crowd-control weapon.

Undoubtedly, she was a formidable temptress.

Oh, and there was Qin Tianhe.

He was a slacker.

Thinking this, Lu Yang couldn't help but sigh.

He looked around. A fool, a madman, a lunatic, a temptress… In such a vast Sacred Sect, was there no other good person as normal as him?
