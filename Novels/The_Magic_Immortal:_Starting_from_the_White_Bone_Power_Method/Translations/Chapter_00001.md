# Chapter 1: A Rogue Cultivator in the Wilderness  

The Lotus Mountain outside White Mountain City, Mist Cloud Kingdom.  

Outside, darkness reigned, punctuated only by the eerie howls of unknown demonic beasts and spectral creatures from the depths of the wilderness, unsettling and terrifying.  

Inside the cramped hut, a single flickering oil lamp cast dim light. A gust of icy wind blew open the window, extinguishing the spirit oil lamp with a soft *pop*, plunging the room into absolute darkness.  

Wang Chan jolted awake from his meditation, immediately darting to the lamp. He added a new wick, snapped his fingers, and the dim yellow glow returned to the confined space.  

"The wilderness is fraught with danger—even cultivation isn't safe here. I wonder when I'll get the chance to settle and cultivate properly in White Mountain City."  

He stared at the flickering flame, his expression complicated.  

Just three days ago, he had been lounging on his sofa, sipping mulberry-goji-chrysanthemum tea, snacking on nine-steamed-nine-sunned black sesame balls, and leisurely rewatching the 1997 adaptation of *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils*. Without fail, at eight in the evening, a mouthwatering takeout order—always with a note to exclude cilantro—would arrive at his door.  

He hadn’t even gotten a chance to take a bite before he found himself here.  

What frustrated him most was the fact that he still had over two million in his bank account—unspent!  

That was money he had painstakingly saved over a decade of soul-crushing work in the city, living like a zombie. Last year, sick of the grind, he had returned to his hometown, thinking a quiet, solitary life wouldn’t be so bad.  

In his free time, he could focus on wellness, experiment with more cilantro-free dishes, and as for romance or marriage… well, that was out of the question.  

"Ah… there’s no going back now…"  

Wang Chan sighed deeply, his heart heavy. This world was anything but welcoming.  

Here, righteous cultivators refined their innate talents, wielding power vast enough to overturn mountains and seas or blot out the sky.  

Heretical cultivators sought profound mysteries, mastering transformations that allowed them to summon wind and rain or command clouds and mist.  

Demonic cultivators transformed into monstrous fiends, capable of towering over the heavens, plucking stars from the sky.  

And eclectic cultivators pursued unorthodox paths, forging treasures to refine mountains and rivers or sealing the wilds with talismans.  

Compared to them, the so-called demonic beasts and ghosts of the wilderness were mere ants, easily crushed with a flick of a finger.  

But none of those were him.  

Those were either reclusive immortal masters or prodigious talents from great sects and noble clans.  

He was just a minor rogue cultivator in the wilderness, barely scraping by.  

The original owner of this body shared his name and age—thirty years old, yet only at the early Qi Refining stage, with a measly twenty-four strands of spiritual power. Pathetic, really.  

With an inferior spiritual root and a cultivation method that wasn’t even ranked, his prospects were bleak. Though he had managed to eke out a living as a low-tier physician, it was barely enough to survive.  

At this rate, even if he cultivated until death, the best he could hope for was the late Qi Refining stage. Forget immortality or transcending mortality—even reaching Foundation Establishment was a pipe dream.  

What was worse, the wilderness outside the city teemed with demons, ghosts, and malevolent cultivators. A single misstep could mean death.  

Given the choice, he’d rather return to his previous life—even if it meant slaving away at a nine-to-five. At least he could have lived out his days in peace.  

Perhaps due to the earlier fright during his cultivation session, his body felt weak now that he had relaxed. Leaning against the table, he slowly sat down. On the jade slip spread before him was a note:  

*Tomorrow at noon, visit Little Tea Mountain to perform meridian therapy and acupuncture for Madam Cheng.*  

Since he couldn’t escape this reality, he might as well face it head-on.  

Over the past three days, he had forced himself to suppress his emotions and adapt to the life of a rogue cultivator.  

As a low-tier physician, when not cultivating, he had to treat patients to earn the resources needed for survival.  

Yesterday, he had already visited Little Tea Mountain, using his **[Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art]** and **[Minor Withering-Glory Needles]** to stabilize Madam Cheng’s condition. But to ensure full recovery, he needed to return tomorrow.  

After all, he had accepted sixty spirit pearls as payment.  

Madam Cheng had recently lost her cultivation partner and nearly suffered a qi deviation during her practice, leaving her weakened and frail. She required careful recuperation.  

Though her looks were merely above average, her ample bosom, slender waist, and full hips perfectly accentuated the allure of a mature woman.  

During yesterday’s treatment, she had shamelessly flirted with him, dropping not-so-subtle hints about wanting a more… intimate exchange.  

No doubt her lonely heart craved comfort.  

"If she tries to seduce me again tomorrow, I wonder if I’ll be able to resist…"  

As Wang Chan mused, a line of text suddenly appeared before his eyes:  

**[You have cultivated diligently for three hours. Experience +1.]**  

Seeing this, a faint smile finally broke through his gloom. His efforts—bolstered by a dose of **[Spirit-Nourishing Elixir]**—had paid off, meeting the three-hour cultivation requirement.  

With his subpar cultivation method, sustaining three hours of daily practice would normally be impossible. Forcing it would only damage his foundation over time.  

With a thought, a translucent panel materialized before him:  

**Name:** Wang Chan  
**Lifespan:** 30/93  
**Talent:** Inferior Spiritual Root  
**Realm:** Early Qi Refining  
**Spiritual Power:** 24 strands  
**Cultivation Method:** Mystic Turtle Breathing Technique (Unranked, replaceable. Three hours of diligent cultivation per day grants 1 exp. Unranked methods cannot reach Foundation Establishment.)  
**Experience:** 1 (Can be used to upgrade spells, divine abilities, skills, and artifacts. Higher ranks require more exp.)  
**Spells (1/3):** Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art (Low-grade, 3/27 spell seals)  
**Divine Abilities (0/3):** None  
**Artifacts (1/3):** Minor Withering-Glory Needles (Low-grade, 11/21 artifact seals)  
**Skills (0/3):** None  
**Breakthrough (0/1):** None (1 breakthrough point increases odds of major realm advancement by 10%.)  

"You can slack off at work, but never in cultivation."  

Wang Chan stared at the single point of experience, muttering to himself with satisfaction.  

This system had awakened three days ago when he had pushed himself to cultivate for three hours straight, desperate to understand what true cultivation felt like. Though it had left him exhausted and spitting blood, it had been worth it.  

After three days of study, he had mostly figured out how the system worked:  

All he needed to do was cultivate diligently to earn experience. Spells, divine abilities, artifacts, and skills could be upgraded instantly once recorded in the system, bypassing the usual learning process.  

Even cultivation methods could be recorded—though they couldn’t be upgraded, doing so allowed him to skip the arduous process of comprehension and begin practicing immediately.  

Simple and brutal.  

Now, with another point of experience, he was eager to use it.  

After all, the rush of growing stronger was addictive.  

His eyes scanned the panel:  

**Spells (1/3):** Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art (Low-grade, 3/27 spell seals)  
**Artifacts (1/3):** Minor Withering-Glory Needles (Low-grade, 11/21 artifact seals)  

Both specialized in restoring vitality, replenishing qi, and regulating blood and energy flow—the very skills that allowed him to make a living as a physician.  

The former was gentler, focusing on holistic regulation, circulating life force through meridians like clouds drifting across the sky. Even healthy individuals could use it for maintenance, making it especially popular among delicate female cultivators.  

Without spiritual power, the Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art was essentially an advanced massage technique—excellent for… stimulating circulation.  

The Minor Withering-Glory Needles, on the other hand, were far more aggressive, delivering rapid results for internal injuries. They also doubled as weapons, capable of sealing meridians or attacking.  

A set of nine needles stored in a specialized case, they required gradual refinement.  

Most importantly, the original owner had already refined ten artifact seals into them, making them far more potent than the Spring Revival Cloud-Pushing Art.  

On his first day here, Wang Chan had spent a point of experience to raise them to eleven seals.  

Now, with another point in hand, he focused his mind.  

Instantly, new text flashed before his eyes.
