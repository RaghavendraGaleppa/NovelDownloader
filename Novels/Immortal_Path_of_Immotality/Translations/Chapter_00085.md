# Chapter 85: The Eerie Eyeball

"How is Prince Wang's condition?" Princess Guo had arrived at Prince Qi's residence and immediately began interrogating the imperial physician. The doctor could only shake his head helplessly, indicating there was nothing he could do.

Surveying the courtyard filled with weeping household members, Princess Guo showed visible impatience as she pushed through the crowd into the inner chamber. On the sickbed lay the formerly well-dressed middle-aged man—now clad only in a white undershirt. His exposed shoulders and arms were covered in dense, wiry hair, his skin dark and greasy. Deep hollows shadowed his eye sockets, his cheeks marred by purple veins, and two sharp fangs protruded from his lips.

Most disturbingly, a single eyeball had sprouted from his forehead. It rolled about incessantly, its large black pupil darting wildly within the white.

When the eyeball noticed Princess Guo's arrival, it seemed to spark with curiosity, twisting at odd angles to scrutinize her.

Even as a cultivator, Princess Guo was startled. 

This wasn't merely a serious illness—this was clearly the work of demonic cultivation, the result of some malevolent curse or seed planted by a practitioner of dark arts!

Silently cursing the ignorance of Prince Qi's household, Princess Guo drew upon her limited knowledge to form her own conclusions. In her experience, the most sinister and vile practitioners were demonic cultivators, with their eerie, blood-soaked techniques. As for witchcraft or curses? She'd never even heard of them, let alone encountered such things.

Now, she faced a dilemma.

No mortal physician could treat this condition. Only a cultivator from Yichuan might have the expertise—but would there be enough time to take Prince Wang there?

Prince Huai'an and Prince Qi had been lifelong friends, and Princess Guo had grown up alongside Prince Qi's heir like siblings. Their bond ran deep. After some thought, she resolved to carry the ailing prince to Yichuan for treatment, regardless of the exorbitant cost in spirit stones. They might have to sell everything they owned to afford it.

As Princess Guo lifted Prince Qi's heir onto her back and prepared to leave, she suddenly felt something slimy lick the nape of her neck. 

A shiver of revulsion ran down her spine, and she hastily flung the prince back onto the bed. 

Turning around, she saw the grotesque eyeball on his forehead split open, revealing a thick, elongated tongue that swiftly retracted.

"What in the world is this?" 

Princess Guo stared in disbelief. The eerie eyeball returned her gaze, seemingly intoxicated by its earlier taste. Its excitement was palpable, carrying an unsettling hint of lechery.

"Ugh!" 

Disgusted by the raw desire in its stare, Princess Guo grew even more wary of the bizarre affliction plaguing Prince Qi's heir. As for carrying him to Yichuan? 

Perhaps not. By the time they arrived, there might be two patients instead of one.

Exiting the chamber, Princess Guo looked utterly lost and distraught, unable to fathom what sinister force her brother had provoked to suffer such a fate. The surrounding wails grated on her nerves, and she fled Prince Qi's residence in haste.

Under the cover of night, Lin Shan slipped stealthily into Prince Qi's mansion.

Through his network of informants, he had learned the identity of the well-dressed middle-aged man. Having exhausted his three daily curses, Lin Shan sensed the man's soul fire flickering on the verge of extinction. Confident in his advantage, he decided to investigate in person.

Originally, both Prince Qi's and Prince Huai'an's residences had employed two cultivators—apart from the well-dressed man and Princess Guo—but Lin Shan had already disposed of them by the riverside. Now, infiltrating Prince Qi's mansion unobserved was effortless.

Following the sounds of weeping and snippets of servants' conversations, Lin Shan navigated his way to the prince's sickroom.

Upon entering, his gaze fell upon the emaciated figure lying on the bed, and even Lin Shan was taken aback.

Was this the same well-dressed man who had ambushed him?

His body was now greasy and blackened, covered in strange tufts of red hair. His arms were as thin as bamboo, his face crisscrossed with bulging purple veins, his eye sockets sunken, and his fangs bared. Lin Shan had glimpsed these changes from afar, but the enormous eyeball rolling wildly on his forehead was something entirely new.

"Did I cause this?" 

Lin Shan felt a pang of unease. He hadn't anticipated that his curses could spawn such monstrosities—nor whether this thing was contagious.

For a moment, he hesitated to approach.

The giant eyeball, however, had already noticed Lin Shan. With an air of curiosity and liveliness, it locked eyes with him.

After a prolonged stare-down, Lin Shan concluded that this thing was undoubtedly sentient, a creature born of some sinister force. Best not to get too close.

Yet, one of his objectives was to claim his spoils. Whether the prince's heir lived or died was irrelevant, but his storage pouch was another matter.

Still, Lin Shan feared infection if he approached. 

Fortunately, as a wind-attributed cultivator, he had alternatives.

Quietly channeling his Wind Control Technique, Lin Shan directed a series of air currents toward the bed. The eyeball watched his every move with keen interest.

The swirling breeze deftly unfastened the pouch at the prince's waist, then carried it gently to Lin Shan's waiting hand. The eyeball blinked excitedly, as if delighted by the spectacle.

Ignoring it, Lin Shan secured the pouch and made a swift exit without hesitation.

"This kind of anomaly is beyond a lowly Qi Condensation cultivator like me," he thought. 

He had a sinking feeling that if left unchecked, this thing could wreak havoc in the capital. 

But with three major sects taking turns to station Foundation Establishment cultivators in the imperial palace, the high and mighty would have to deal with the fallout. He just hoped it wouldn't spiral out of control.

After a cursory search for antiques imbued with ancient essence—which yielded nothing—Lin Shan left Prince Qi's mansion under the cover of night, his heart unsettled.

---

Soon after, Lin Shan reappeared at Prince Huai'an's residence.

Lacking any personal item belonging to Princess Guo, he couldn't curse her from afar. But that didn't stop him from coming to eliminate her personally.

This woman had repeatedly ambushed and deceived him, treating him as nothing more than prey.

"Very well," he thought. "Tonight, we settle all debts."

Lin Shan activated an Invisibility Talisman and a Qi Concealment Talisman purchased from Yichuan's market, adhering them to his body.

Unlike the half-dead prince, Princess Guo was still in full health. A Qi Condensation cultivator's spiritual perception within ten meters was sharp, and Lin Shan didn't want to alert her prematurely.

A swift, silent strike was ideal—protracted combat might draw unwanted attention in the capital.

Prince Huai'an's sprawling estate, with its winding paths and artificial landscapes, left Lin Shan disoriented. After kidnapping and interrogating a few servants to locate Princess Guo's quarters, he knocked them unconscious and proceeded.

Arriving at her courtyard, he noticed a light still burning inside, with two silhouettes—one young, one old—engaged in conversation.

Lin Shan resisted the urge to barge in. Instead, he crept closer to eavesdrop.

Princess Guo seemed to be reporting to someone.

"The four of us delayed our return by three months to cultivate longer in Yichuan..."

"On our way back to the capital, we were ambushed by a late-stage Qi Condensation youth. The Great Yan Princess was killed in his surprise attack..."

"Both Prince Wang and I were severely injured. It's shameful..."

"That man is ruthless and cunning..."

As he listened, Lin Shan frowned. Why was Princess Guo twisting the facts? They were already mortal enemies—what purpose did this serve?

But why emphasize the Great Yan Princess's death so heavily?

Unless...

A sudden realization struck Lin Shan. At Yichuan's auction, a Song Dynasty royal cultivator had spent two thousand spirit stones to purchase the Great Yan Princess.

It was now the fourth watch of the night, the cold air biting. Despite his talismans, sweat beaded on Lin Shan's forehead.

If the person inside was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, their spiritual sense could span a hundred meters, detecting even the slightest disturbance.

While Lin Shan was confident his talismans could fool Qi Condensation cultivators, Foundation Establishment was another matter entirely. Though Princess Guo might be bluffing, it wasn't worth the risk.

"Better to retreat and strike another day," he decided, beginning to back away silently.

But just then, an aged voice called out from within the room.

"Friend outside, having eavesdropped for so long, won't you stay for a chat?"
