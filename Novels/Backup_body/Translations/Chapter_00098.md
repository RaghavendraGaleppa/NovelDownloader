# Chapter 98: The Impermanent Venerable Li Erpu!

With a mere thought, the Grand Mystic Kingdom's State Preceptor spat forth water that transformed into a hundred-zhang-long dragon, overturning the pavilion as it lunged toward Li Zhengjing!

Yet in that instant, a resounding dragon's roar echoed!

A golden dragon rose from behind Li Zhengjing, also stretching a hundred zhang long, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, its eyes fierce, whiskers fluttering, and golden scales gleaming.

"The Dragon Pillar of the Imperial Hall?" Lin Fuxuan's eyes narrowed in surprise before delight spread across his face. "It seems today's harvest will be bountiful!"

"Then let's see how capable the State Preceptor truly is!" Li Zhengjing willed the golden dragon forward, and the two dragons tangled in midair!

The golden dragon, originating from the Dragon Pillar of the Imperial Hall, was inherently more formidable. The water dragon, a manifestation of Lin Fuxuan's Daoist arts, was slightly weaker. However, Lin Fuxuan's cultivation was at the peak of the Human Immortal realm, far surpassing Li Zhengjing's. Thus, the two dragons fought to a standstill!

At that moment, Li Zhengjing swallowed the jade fragment housing Yuan Zhengfeng's spirit and downed over a dozen high-grade spirit stones. After glancing at the golden page's fortune, he charged forward without hesitation—fearless and ferocious!

If he wouldn't die, then he'd fight to the death!

"Human Immortal?" Sensing the vast surge of Li Zhengjing's mana, Lin Fuxuan's eyes flickered with astonishment.

But Li Zhengjing's blade was already descending upon him, thunder crashing forth!

Lin Fuxuan stepped sideways, evading by over ten zhang. The thunderbolt struck the pavilion, reducing it and its stone table to ashes!

"You've given me quite the surprise," Lin Fuxuan said, flipping his hand to produce a golden mace. "Let's see how many more surprises you have in store!"

With a casual swing, a golden light—sharp as a blade—shot toward Li Zhengjing!

Li Zhengjing activated the *Gentle Breeze Shadow Step* to dodge, then swung his blade again, unleashing another thunderous strike. But this time, instead of aiming at Lin Fuxuan, he directed the lightning toward the water dragon!

As the two dragons momentarily separated, the golden dragon feigned an opening, luring the water dragon to bite its tail. But in doing so, the water dragon's head met the incoming lightning!

*Boom!*

The *Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Blade* severed the water dragon's head!

With a splash, the water dragon dispersed into a downpour!

Seizing the moment, the golden dragon whipped its tail and lunged at Lin Fuxuan!

With the golden dragon now aiding him, Li Zhengjing's pressure lessened. He unleashed five consecutive strikes of the *Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Blade*, each stronger than the last!

Even the Grand Mystic State Preceptor's expression turned grave under the onslaught!

*Boom!*

Li Zhengjing raised his left arm—*Blazing Sun Divine Fire* erupted!

The flames carried razor-sharp sword intent, honed to perfection!

"Such formidable sword intent!" Lin Fuxuan's face darkened as the flames and sword intent engulfed him.

Landing heavily, Li Zhengjing panted. *Did I kill him?*

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed in his mind: *"You wounded him."*

The flames shattered!

Lin Fuxuan stepped out, his hair disheveled and singed, robes tattered, and a scorched sword wound on his hand, the flesh seared black.

"You possess an innate divine ability. With that strike alone, you rank among the upper echelons of Human Immortals." Lin Fuxuan studied Li Zhengjing. "I can hardly believe you've achieved this in just a year of cultivation. If true, you are unprecedented in history! But... to kill me? Not enough."

With a flip of his hand, an ancient mirror materialized. Its light shone forth!

Li Zhengjing barely dodged—where he'd stood moments before exploded into a smoldering crater!

"The more exceptional you prove, the less I can afford to let you live." Lin Fuxuan's mirror tracked Li Zhengjing relentlessly, its light annihilating everything it touched. "Today, we've crossed blades. Either join the Grand Mystic Dynasty, and I shall nurture you with all my resources, or perish here—lest you become an obstacle to our restoration!"

His right hand wielded the mirror, its deadly light pursuing Li Zhengjing. No matter how Li Zhengjing twisted and turned, the light followed, each dodge razor-thin.

Then Lin Fuxuan flicked his left hand—a sword light materialized, sealing Li Zhengjing's escape!

*Boom!*

Dodging the mirror's beam, Li Zhengjing stumbled into the sword light, which pierced his abdomen. The mirror's light then bathed him, searing his flesh like fire!

"To force me to use the Grand Mystic's treasure... among Human Immortals, you are rare. Among the young, even the Kunlun Sect's Young Master pales before you." Lin Fuxuan advanced, golden mace in hand. "One last chance: reveal the Debt Collector's whereabouts and join us."

But then his expression shifted.

Despite his grievous wounds, Li Zhengjing raised his left arm—*Blazing Sun Divine Fire* erupted again!

*Boom!*

The attack struck point-blank!

Lin Fuxuan barely mustered a defense, but the flames pierced through, hurling him a hundred zhang away!

When he steadied himself, a gaping hole—charred black—pierced his side, exposing his organs. He was severely wounded.

Yet Li Zhengjing stood, his wounds healing visibly, the scorched flesh sloughing off to reveal new skin beneath.

"You—" Lin Fuxuan's face twisted in disbelief. "Limitless vitality? The *Celestial Azure Dao Body* of three thousand years ago?"

His expression grew feverish.

Three millennia ago, the invincible Celestial Azure Dao Lord possessed boundless vitality, healing any wound instantly—earning him the title of "Deathless." He was said to have ascended to immortality. Only when the first-generation *Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Venerable* unearthed his tomb thirteen hundred years ago was it proven he had never ascended. Yet his legend remained untarnished.

If this youth truly possessed the Celestial Azure Dao Body... did that mean he had the potential to match the Dao Lord's invincibility?

A year of cultivation, Human Immortal combat power, an undying body—how far was he from dominating the world?

If subdued, he could restore the Grand Mystic Dynasty, topple the Great Zhou, and reclaim the Central Plains!

If not... he would become an unfathomable calamity.

"Impressive," Lin Fuxuan murmured, gripping the mirror and mace, his gaze solemn.

Li Zhengjing's heart sank. *"A direct hit from my Blazing Sun Divine Fire, and he's only lightly wounded?"*

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed: *"We can't win. Even with the Dragon Pillar, we can't suppress him. You feigned injury to ambush him—now he's wary. You won't land another hit. Flee!"*

"Does he look like he'll let us go?" Li Zhengjing muttered. "He wants me to join the Grand Mystic, reveal the Debt Collector's whereabouts, and hand over three thousand spirit stones as 'membership dues.'"

"Joining them is more trouble than it's worth. We don't even know where the Debt Collector is. And demanding my spirit stones? That's asking for my life!"

"He's forcing me to fight to the death!"

Glancing at the golden page's unchanged fortune, Li Zhengjing steadied himself and charged again.

This time, he held nothing back. Mana surged from his 160+ acupoints, coalescing into the *Great Profound Void-Splitting Sword Qi*, wielded with the *Feathered Ascension Dragon Immortal Art*!

Sword energy crisscrossed the battlefield!

The golden dragon swept forth!

Five thunderous strikes of the *Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Blade* rained down!

Li Zhengjing unleashed everything—his Daoist arts and divine abilities swallowing Lin Fuxuan whole.

Then Lin Fuxuan stepped out, unscathed.

"..."

Li Zhengjing froze. *"All that effort, and I barely scratched him?"*

"Such sharp sword intent. The Feather Immortal Sect has no such technique." Lin Fuxuan raised his mace. "Final chance—"

Before he could finish, the little dragon girl appeared before him.

Lin Fuxuan stiffened, paralyzed.

She reached out, plucked the mirror from his grasp, and admired her reflection, giggling. "Wah! I've grown so much!"

The scene fell silent.

Hugging the mirror, she scampered to Li Zhengjing, beaming as she presented it.

"..."

Li Zhengjing wordlessly took the mirror.

Even Yuan Zhengfeng was speechless.

Suppressing his bewilderment, Li Zhengjing forced a smile and aimed the mirror at Lin Fuxuan.

*Boom!*

The ground where Lin Fuxuan stood exploded into scorched earth—but he was gone.

Looking up, Li Zhengjing saw a figure vanishing into the horizon.

The Grand Mystic State Preceptor had fled the moment his mirror was taken—utterly humiliated!

*"Who is that girl?"* Lin Fuxuan shuddered, recalling the bone-chilling fear he'd felt.

Then Li Zhengjing's taunting voice echoed after him:

"State Preceptor! You forgot your mirror!"

"Come back for it! Want three thousand spirit stones too?"

"If not, I'll keep it for free!"

"..."

Lin Fuxuan ignored him, fleeing faster. *"The audacity! Stealing my treasure and mocking me!"*

"The Grand Mystic Dynasty must be wealthy if their State Preceptor is this generous." Li Zhengjing chuckled, examining the mirror—only for the dragon girl to snatch it back, admiring herself.

As if to console him, she handed him the *Heavenly Balance Divine Wheel*—the South Domain Divine Mother's artifact, now reverted to its original form after losing its divine power.

"Giving me your discarded toys?" Li Zhengjing grumbled but pocketed it.

Gazing at the horizon, he mused, "The Debt Collector's life must be miserable now, hunted by every faction. Even the hidden Grand Mystic Dynasty emerged for him."

Had the Debt Collector been at full strength, he'd have been untouchable. But after the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven, severely wounded and with his lifespan reduced to mere days, his plight was dire.

"Don't worry," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "If he told you he'd force out the true mastermind within a hundred days, he has a plan. Had the real mastermind not been lurking, the Debt Collector wouldn't have exposed his full power in the cave and ended up like this. Now that he knows, he'll be more cautious."

"I hope so." Li Zhengjing sighed.

Sensing approaching figures, he ordered, "Hanging Wall, Little Tree—take her south and wait for me a hundred li away!"

"Got it!" The Hanging Wall Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree bundled the dragon girl into the phoenix tree box and departed.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing donned the *Impermanent Ghost Mask*, summoned the golden dragon, and soared into the sky, laughing.

"State Preceptor of the Grand Mystic Dynasty? No match for the Impermanent Venerable!"

The masked figure astride the golden dragon appeared in the heavens, drawing the gaze of local officials and soldiers who'd sensed the battle.

With a thought, Li Zhengjing sent the dragon sweeping down, its mere aura scattering their formations.

Then, with a final flourish, he soared away, leaving the routed forces behind.

"The Grand Mystic State Preceptor? The Impermanent Venerable? And that golden dragon?"

"Report to the Prefecture Governor! Now!"

The lead official scrambled up, pale-faced, shouting orders.

Rejoining his companions a hundred li south, Li Zhengjing continued toward the capital.

Two days later, they reached a temple.

A monk rushed out, grinning. "Second Brother! You're here!"

It was Jia Shifang, who'd been waiting per the Diamond Temple's message.

He handed Li Zhengjing a document. "I had the Jia family bribe the Ministry of Revenue to forge you a new identity. This one's official—no longer fake!"

"Good." Li Zhengjing smiled. "The second son of Jian'an Marquis is dead, and the traitor Li Zhengjing of the Feather Immortal Sect is unusable. A new identity is necessary."

Unfolding the document, his smile vanished.

"Li Erpu?"

"Exactly! I came up with it myself!" Jia Shifang beamed. "Big Brother is Li Pu, so Second Brother is Li Erpu—sounds like real brothers, right? Ow! Second Brother, stop hitting me—!"
