# Chapter 51: A Bountiful Harvest and Advancement Through Consumption

The figure seemed to be waving.

Li Xian frowned. The rain was heavy now; dense rain, misty vapor, and swaying branches all obstructed his view. Traits like "Listening in All Directions" and "Treading on Snow" were hindered by the environment.

"In the hunting forest, humans are more dangerous than fierce beasts."

Li Xian wiped the rain and dew from his face, shielding his forehead with his hand to look out at the figure, focusing his gaze.

Over the past two days of hunting, Li Xian had been doing his best to avoid human traces and conceal his movements. This was his first encounter with another person.

"It's Zhang Dan, the Grade C Guard."

He finally recognized who it was. Zhang Dan had patrolled the outskirts of the ruined house with Li Xian before, so they naturally knew each other. Their relationship was shallow, merely nodding acquaintances.

Now, he was waving frantically, greeting Li Xian repeatedly. If this were elsewhere, Li Xian wouldn't have ignored him, but here, he didn't want to cause trouble. He gestured back and turned to leave.

After walking several miles, he felt something was off. A sense of unease lingered in his heart as he replayed the scene over and over.

"A Grade C Guard only has ten Lingyu arrows. Usually, a Grade C Guard would leave the mountain after a single day."

"Could Zhang Dan be like me, wanting to hunt three bear beasts to advance?"

Based on Li Xian's impression of him, it didn't seem likely.

Just then, Zhang Dan appeared in his field of view again. This time, he seemed to be caught in a trap, injured, letting out a painful howl. It seemed he was trying to lure Li Xian for help.

"No, if he really wanted help, he would speak."

"Could it be..."

Li Xian narrowed his eyes, recalling a rumor from the mountains. He immediately took out his bow and arrow, aiming at Zhang Dan.

There is a type of bear in the mountains that is extremely cunning and treacherous. They usually appear in pairs, typically a mother and a cub. The mother bear is huge and brutally strong, while the cub is short and agile, about the size of a human.

These bears have sharp mouths and teeth, and tongues several feet long covered in fine barbs. They pierce human skin, insert their tongue into the body, and use the barbs to grind the prey's flesh and organs into meat paste, which they then consume. This leaves the prey's body empty but the skin perfectly intact.

The cub wears human skin to lure prey, while the mother waits for the opportunity.

They are called: Sharp-Mouthed Long-Tongue Bears.

Thoughts raced through Li Xian's mind. In an instant, he realized he was in a dangerous situation. A warning bell rang in his heart, and suddenly, the sound of a branch breaking came from above.

The mother bear had somehow approached silently and was pouncing down from above.

"The heavy rain masked its movements and weakened my hearing."

"And encountering this kind of fierce bear is truly terrible!"

Li Xian reacted quickly, dodging to the side while firing two arrows at the cub. His movements were fluid and his aim was excellent, but he had a fatal weakness: mountain hunters rarely shoot in the rain.

The rain reduces the force and accuracy of the arrows. These two arrows only grazed the cub's skin, failing to kill it.

The cub shook its body, and the human skin on its surface tore apart, revealing its true form. It was a short bear the size of a person. The two bears, large and small, charged simultaneously.

It was a critical moment.

Li Xian cursed, "Come on! I was just worried I wouldn't find any prey!" He stood his ground, aiming his arrow at the mother bear.

One step, two steps, three steps...

Just as the mother bear closed in, Li Xian loosed the arrow. The mother bear's eyes flashed with a cunning light, and it surprisingly rolled to dodge with human-like agility.

Meanwhile, the cub from the other direction had already pounced right in front of him.

However...

The one that fell to the ground dead was not Li Xian, but the cub.

It turned out that Li Xian's previous arrow had applied the principles of the "Four Directions Fist." The Four Directions Fist is a martial art designed to fight multiple opponents.

When surrounded by many enemies, an ordinary martial artist's fists are hard-pressed to defend against all attacks; brute force alone cannot turn the tide. There is a psychological game involved.

If these two bears were ordinary beasts without the ability to scheme, Li Xian would have been done for. With both bears pouncing at once, the current Li Xian would have had no way to defend.

Unfortunately, these two bears were quite intelligent.

The mother bear, despite her large size and fast charge, intentionally made her steps heavier to increase her presence. It was a feint to attract attention.

The cub, though small, intentionally lightened its movements. This was the real attack.

The mother and cub cooperated perfectly.

The large one was the feint, the small one was the real attack. There were layers of strategy involved, containing the principle of true and false.

Li Xian saw through this and decided to take a gamble, standing his ground and playing along.

He appeared to be aiming at the mother bear, but it was actually a "feint east, strike west" tactic. The moment he released the string, he twisted his ankle and turned his body with maximum speed, hitting the cub.

The "Four Directions Fist," nearing perfection, was flexibly applied here. The principles of the fist were used on the arrow; he remained calm as泰山 collapsed before him.

The mother bear let out a mournful howl upon seeing this, picking up the cub's corpse. It was hard to tell if it was tears or rain.

Li Xian created distance, climbed a large tree, hooked his feet on a branch, drew his bowstring like a full moon, his eyes cold and indifferent.

"It seems even beasts have true feelings."

"It's a pity, if I don't kill you, you will kill me. That is how the world works."

Li Xian loosed an arrow. This arrow shot from above, piercing through the mother bear's skull, killing both bears on the spot.

He took out his Lingyu arrows and put one in each corpse for good measure.

"Hunting in the rain is truly too dangerous."

Li Xian landed on the ground and let out a heavy breath. He had truly walked the line between life and death just now. It was even more dangerous than the Ghost-Striped Tiger.

Although the Ghost-Striped Tiger was fierce, Li Xian had prepared in advance, surveyed the terrain, and had a plan, so he handled it with ease. This time, it was truly a turn of events in an instant, beyond his expectations.

"The bond between mother and cub was deep. If not for that, this mother bear would have been a tough opponent."

This mother bear's combat power was likely far superior to the Ghost-Striped Tiger. If the cub hadn't died, the mother bear wouldn't have wanted to live either. In this heavy rain, there would have been a fierce battle.

Li Xian packed up the two bears and counted his prey.

One deer, three tigers, three bears... it was already a perfect haul.

"It's enough. On the way back, if I'm lucky, I can use up the remaining three Lingyu arrows."

Li Xian smiled.

Suddenly, he remembered something and walked toward a spot. On the ground were several pieces of human skin, coming from "Grade C Guard Zhang Dan."

There are risks in the Winter Hunt, and death is not uncommon. But Zhang Dan's death must have been incredibly tragic. Because the Sharp-Mouthed Long-Tongue Bears always eat their prey alive. Only by eating alive or raw can they maintain the skin's elasticity.

"The bears on this mountain are even more cunning and insidious."

"And there are more mutant beasts."

"Compared to them, ordinary brown bears are as cute as kittens."

"Three bears, three tigers... my advancement is already set in stone. There's no need to venture deeper and take risks!"

Li Xian's heart swelled with excitement.

Hard work pays off. His efforts were not in vain!

Although the rain was heavy, the marks Li Xian had left along the way were still there. He followed the red cloth markers back.

He soon reached the edge of the inner perimeter. Li Xian didn't go straight back. Since he had难得 (rarely) entered the mountain, he wanted to make full use of his arrows.

He didn't look for tigers or bears anymore, avoiding them from a distance, only hunting wild deer, river deer, and other beasts.

When he found sweet, fragrant berries, he picked and ate them. They were sweet and delicious, and his mood was excellent.

Around noon.

After eating some deer and tiger jerky, the accumulated proficiency was finally enough for [Consumption] to break through.
