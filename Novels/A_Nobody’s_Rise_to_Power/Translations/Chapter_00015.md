Chapter 15: It Is Rare to Be Foolish

Qingmei moistened her lips and silently stepped forward to untie the ropes binding Yang Can.

The young mistress’s command clearly indicated that she believed Yang Can’s words.

And Qingmei had also come to her senses; she believed him too.

Having grown up as a servant in a large, wealthy household, she was even more aware than Suo Chanzhi of the dark and sordid affairs hidden within.

In the Suo household, she had personally witnessed Tu Mama summoning the servants of every room and publicly beating a offending servant to death with clubs. That fierce and vicious appearance was still vividly etched in her memory.

However, she had never imagined that she would unwittingly become a target of Tu Mama.

“Qingmei, you may leave first.”

As Yang Can’s ropes were undone and he was stretching his wrists, Suo Chanzhi gave another instruction.

“Oh!”

Little Qingmei felt a bit unhappy; she now had a deep psychological shadow regarding standing guard.

Because every time she guarded the door, it was very... exhausting.

Once the tent fell silent, Suo Chanzhi sat down wearily on a brocade cushion and let out a long sigh.

“Tu Mama is dead. I... originally didn't want to use this secret to bind you, nor did I intend to kill you. Where to go from here, you can decide for yourself.”

Yang Can gave a bitter smile. “Decide for myself? I’ve already boarded the pirate ship; can I still get off?”

Suo Chanzhi glared at Yang Can sensitively.

What pirate ship? How did this delicate, beautiful young lady become a pirate ship?

Did you ask me before boarding? You didn't even ask before taking the helm and rowing the oars, and now you’re complaining after getting the benefits!

Yang Can said, “Now I can only wait. At least, I must wait for a definite sign to confirm whether you are pregnant.”

Yu Chengye had died not long ago. Now, only three people knew that he and Suo Chanzhi had not consummated their marriage.

If Suo Chanzhi were to become pregnant now, it could be said to be Yu Chengye’s flesh and blood.

With the medical standards of this era, there was no way to deny it.

Given Suo Chanzhi’s maternal family background, without conclusive medical evidence, the Yu family absolutely could not deny it either.

If that were the case, whether considering their own safety or taking responsibility for their own flesh and blood, they would have to follow the path Tu Mama had planned.

During this period, if Suo Chanzhi did not become pregnant, then she would have no more chances.

Because from the time of Yu Chengye’s death, she only had this one chance to deceive the world; later... the timing wouldn't match.

If that were the case, then everything would be over.

Everything that had happened between the two of them would become a permanent secret.

Suo Chanzhi would be kept idle by the Yu family, and Yang Can could only seek his own way out. There would be no chance for any intersection between the two.

Suo Chanzhi subconsciously touched her lower abdomen and said softly, “I understand...”

This wasn't her idea originally; it was all manipulated by Tu Mama before. With Tu Mama dead, she had gained freedom, but she was also somewhat at a loss.

Now that Yang Can was willing to stay by her side and wait for the result together, she felt as if she had a backbone, and her heart suddenly settled down.

Yang Can instructed, “In the future, we still have to pretend to be at odds in front of others...”

Tch! Why pretend? Are we on good terms?

Suo Chanzhi rolled her eyes at Yang Can. “I know. So... we’ll wait for the result before... What are you doing?”

Watching Yang Can walk toward her, Suo Chanzhi’s pupils instantly dilated, and she asked in surprise.

Yang Can said, “Of course, I must seize every opportunity to strive for a good ‘result’.”

Suo Chanzhi’s face immediately flushed red. “Get lost! I’m not in the mood...”

Her kicked ankle was cooperatively caught by a large hand, and then she was soaring through the clouds again.

*Crack!* The candle flame popped, waking the contemplative Steward Yi.

He let out a long breath and finally made up his mind.

Once that horse bandit is brought before the Clan Head, the conflict between the First Branch’s First Line and the First Branch’s Second Line will have to be laid on the table.

If discussing strength among the various branches of the Yu family, currently, the First Branch’s Second Line under Yu Huanhu is naturally the strongest.

But now the First Branch’s First Line has formed a marriage alliance with the Suo family. In that case, who is stronger and who is weaker is unclear again.

Therefore, as a Yu family retainer holding great power, he absolutely cannot get involved in the power struggle of the main family right now.

He also doesn't want to investigate deeply who the murderer was who killed Tu Mama tonight; he’s afraid of digging up some unpredictable news.

He now just wants to bring these people safely back to Tianshui, without any further trouble on the way. That would be thanks to the heavens.

Thinking of this, Steward Yi’s mood finally stabilized. He picked up his tea and took a leisurely sip.

In another large tent, Suo Chanzhi, her hair disheveled, crawled to the edge of the bed.

She grabbed a cup of warm tea and had just moistened her throat when her slender, crystalline ankle was caught by a large hand, dragging her back to the battlefield.

Suo Chanzhi tried to struggle, but a crisp *slap* landed on her full rear, and she immediately became docile.

Outside the tent, Little Qingmei stood leaning on her sword, looking exactly like a desperate Japanese Colonel.

Tianshui, Phoenix Mountain Villa, Yu Xinglong’s Study.

Although it was called a study, it was actually a relatively independent courtyard.

The various businesses of the Yu family, such as farmland, pastures, and all trades, would have their income and expenditure reports sent here for the Clan Head to review.

However, at this moment, Yu Xinglong was not reviewing account books but sitting upright in his chair.

Standing stiffly in front of the desk was a guard, a messenger sent back overnight by Steward Yi.

Steward Yi’s letter mentioned three and a half matters:

First, the Suo family’s young mistress has already consummated her marriage with the young master, so she must be treated with the礼 of a young madam.

Second, the dowry steward and Mama of the Suo family, Tu, was mysteriously killed.

Third, the幕客 Yang Can accused the Suo family of plotting to harm the young master.

In Steward Yi’s view, this matter was the most absurd, yet he wrote it seriously into the secret report.

And the fact that the captured horse bandit confessed to being instigated by the Yu family’s Second Branch, Yu Huanhu, to murder the heir apparent, he didn't mention a single word.

Just after explaining these three matters, he added another sentence: There is one more matter, because it involves a great relationship, he must wait until he returns to Tianshui City to report it to the Clan Head in person.

Yu Xinglong, over fifty years old, thin, handsome, and elegant like a scholar, slowly put down the letter.

He looked up at the messenger. “The幕客 Yang Can, publicly accused the Suo family of plotting to harm my son?”

“Yes!”

The messenger guard steadied himself and said, “However, what Yang Can said was all one-sided speculation, without half a shred of real evidence.

Fearing the Suo family’s dissatisfaction, Steward Yi reprimanded him and handed him over to the Suo... to the young madam for custody.”

“Hmm...”

Yu Xinglong’s eyes moved. After thinking for a moment, he said faintly, “Understood.”

The messenger guard breathed a sigh of relief, bowed to him, and quietly retreated.

Yu Xinglong let out a light breath and pinched the bridge of his nose.

Dragon’s breath incense was burning in the room. This incense originally had the effect of calming the nerves, but his mood remained extremely chaotic.

Forming a marriage alliance with the Suo family, and then having his son die in an ambush midway—everything was to have a suitable reason to draw the Suo family into the fray, but not let their reach extend too far.

This plan was proposed by his good son himself. How could Chengye have consummated his marriage with the Suo family’s young lady?

Yu Xinglong frowned, feeling very puzzled.

To put it bluntly, that Suo family young lady was a sacrifice in the plan.

Chengye knew that once the Suo family young lady had his flesh and blood, it would make the entire plan uncontrollable. How could he have consummated the marriage with her?

Could he not resist the temptation of beauty?

He was willing to sacrifice his life; would he do such a foolish thing?

Although he had doubts in his heart, he had no way to verify this matter.

For a moment, Yu Xinglong’s mood was exceptionally conflicted.

If this daughter-in-law had no offspring, that would be fine. Whether his son consummated the marriage with her or not would not affect the progress of the plan.

If she had a child, he was afraid the Suo family would use the identity of the child’s grandfather and uncles to reasonably intervene in the affairs of my Yu family.

However, while conflicted, he also had an inexplicable expectation in his heart:

If the Suo family young lady really carried Chengye’s child, wouldn’t my son have a bloodline to continue...

After pondering for a long time, he temporarily set aside this conflict and focused his attention on Yang Can.

He knew a little about Yang Can, after all, he was the one who saved his son’s life.

This man kept accusing the Suo family of being related to my son’s “death”...

This point seems to be usable, of course, not now.

If the Suo family woman really has my son’s flesh and blood, and if at that time the Suo family uses this as an excuse to intervene too much in my Yu family’s affairs, then can I use this man to bring up the old matter and make something of it?

Thinking of this, Yu Xinglong pulled a silk thread beside the table. Far away, a copper bell rang.

A moment later, a guard walked in, hands垂, waiting for orders.

Yu Xinglong said, “Go and fetch Yang Can’s Jia Li.”

A great family like the Yu Clan, which already possessed the characteristics of a local separatist regime, would not casually appoint anyone.

When the Yu family promoted Yang Can to the position of a small herdsman, they had conducted an investigation on him.

The Yu family had its own Jia Li Library and Yellow Register Pavilion, which recorded the people under their rule, and it went without saying for stewards of all sizes.

Yang Can’s “Jia Li” was quickly delivered.

The Jia Li Library in the study held the important information of countless people, but since the Clan Head only wanted to review the resume of a small figure, they could find it quickly.

Opening the “Jia Li,” Yu Xinglong carefully read through Yang Can’s information.

First, he could be certain that this Yang Can was not an spy sent by other clans.

Because Yang Can becoming a “herdsman” was a very random event.

Yu Chengye, after being hit by a poisoned arrow, fled in panic. Meeting Yang Can while riding for his life was an unpredictable random event.

No clan would use such a method, where everything depended on fate, to plant a spy.

From the records of the existing information, this Yang Can was a native of the Central Plains.

He had offended some powerful figure in the Central Plains and fled to Longshang to take refuge.

There were many such fugitives in Longshang.

The Central Plains had two great empires, both possessing complete imperial systems, so their laws and order were naturally much stricter than those in Longshang.

Therefore, those who committed crimes or offended powerful figures fled to Longshang to be safe.

Thus, Longshang had long become a paradise for fugitives from the Central Plains.

Yu Xinglong looked through it carefully and found no suspicious points in Yang Can’s resume.

Of course, this was also because at that time, Yang Can was only a herdsman.

A man who dealt with cattle and horses all day long needed a detailed investigation?

As for him later becoming a幕客, firstly, it was because the young master brought him back directly, and the time was short.

Secondly, Yu Chengye mainly wanted to repay a favor and never intended to重用 him.

Add to that the fact that the entire Yu family was busy with the young master’s wedding at the time, so there was no time to do a more detailed investigation.

Now, if Yu Xinglong wanted to重用 him, it would be necessary to conduct a new investigation on him.

However, Yu Xinglong did not do so.

Although Yang Can had entered his sight, he was just a chess piece he was preparing to sacrifice.

Since that was the case, why waste manpower and material resources?
