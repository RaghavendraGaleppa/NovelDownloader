# Chapter 30: My Name Is Chen Fengshuang

The most terrifying thing was that Wang Chan had secretly taken the demon bone in the evening, snatching it right from under someone's nose, and now that very person was standing on his wall staring at him at night. It was downright creepy...

Had his misdeed been exposed? Had they come knocking? Although he'd covered his tracks, what if there was some oversight they'd caught?

Guilt-ridden, Wang Chan gripped the chicken leg tightly, his appetite vanishing instantly, replaced by an urge to hurl the drumstick like a magical weapon in his unease.

"You seem a bit nervous," said the Daoist Companion Chen on the wall, her expression indifferent.

Wang Chan silently watched her, saying nothing.

"I won't snatch your food," Daoist Companion Chen added.

"..."

Wang Chan was momentarily thrown into confusion, unsure how to respond.

"What's that in your hand?"

"Chicken."

"What kind of chicken?"

"Willow-leaf chicken."

"I saw you wrap it in leaves and mud before burying it in a pit. Does this method have a name?"

Hearing this, Wang Chan's heart tightened again.

Had she been watching him that early? He'd checked the surroundings beforehand—how had he missed her?

While these thoughts raced through his mind, he replied, "Beggar's chicken."

"Is it good?" Daoist Companion Chen blinked at the chicken.

"Should be juicy." Unsure of her intentions, Wang Chan decided to play along. Though the chicken wasn't even enough for himself, considering she had contributed "a little" to his acquisition of the demon bone, he glanced at the chicken on the rack and said, "Care to share?"

If she really just wanted his chicken, she'd naturally accept.

But if she refused outright, it might be an excuse—perhaps she'd discovered something and was probing him for information.

To his surprise, upon hearing his invitation, Daoist Companion Chen neither nodded nor refused outright. Instead, she stared at the chicken in silence, as if wrestling with herself.

After a good three to five breaths, she slowly shook her head. "I've already had dinner."

As soon as the words left her lips, she suddenly patted her storage pouch. Just as Wang Chan was about to preemptively strike with his black needles, she tossed over a bottle of spirit wine, saying, "You treat me to chicken, I'll treat you to wine. This green bamboo spirit wine should pair well with your willow-leaf chicken."

Wang Chan dumbly caught the green wine bottle and checked the label.

Good heavens—mid-grade spirit wine. A single bottle cost at least a hundred fa coins, and she'd just casually given it away? What had he done to deserve this?

But though she dared to give, Wang Chan didn't dare drink. They weren't even nodding acquaintances, and he had no idea why she was really here. Holding the bottle, he forced a smile and said, "For a rogue cultivator like me, mid-grade spirit wine is too precious. I'd better save it for entertaining friends another time."

He certainly wasn't going to drink it, but returning it seemed unnecessary too.

It wasn't that he was reluctant—it was just that refusing a gift given in good faith would be downright rude.

Daoist Companion Chen immediately patted her storage pouch again and tossed over a pink jade bottle. "This lower-grade spirit wine, Peach Blossom Brew, also tastes quite nice."

Wang Chan was at a loss for words. Was she determined to make him drink?

But upon further reflection, given her strength, if she truly harbored ill intentions, she wouldn't resort to something as crude as poisoning wine.

Having realized this, Wang Chan promptly said, "Drinking alone is no fun. Why not join me?"

This time, Daoist Companion Chen didn't refuse. She nodded.

"I'll fetch a couple of cups from inside," Wang Chan quickly offered.

"I brought my own." From her storage pouch, she produced an exquisite jade cup that shimmered faintly under the moonlight, clearly no ordinary item.

Soon, the two stood by the bonfire rack in the courtyard, drinking together.

Drinking without food was dull, so Wang Chan repeatedly invited her to share the dishes.

But Daoist Companion Chen shook her head each time.

After three cups, she suddenly asked, "Can you tell me how to make beggar's chicken?"

"..." Wang Chan was speechless for a couple of breaths before nodding. "Sure."

"And the sauce pairing for the grilled meat."

"Alright."

Seeing his agreement, Daoist Companion Chen promptly took out a silver brush and jade notebook, waiting eagerly for his instructions. Her earnestness and genuine interest...

For a moment, Wang Chan was stunned.

The Daoist Companion Chen he remembered was aloof and domineering, the type to sever arms at the slightest provocation. This sudden shift in demeanor was truly...

"Beggar's chicken must use tender willow-leaf chicken. Clove chicken works too, but phoenix-eye and cherry chickens are inferior. Never use tough old tricolor brocade chickens..."

Soon, Wang Chan finished explaining all the details.

Daoist Companion Chen filled two full jade pages with notes, then carefully closed the notebook and put away her brush. When she looked up at Wang Chan again, there was a hint of goodwill and approval in her gaze. "I never expected you to have such unique insights into spiritual cuisine."

"You flatter me, Daoist Companion Chen. I simply have a hearty appetite and enjoy experimenting in my spare time." Wang Chan humbly deflected, then instinctively added, "In truth, the finest ingredients often require the simplest preparation."

At this, Daoist Companion Chen's previously calm eyes brightened with interest. "How true. Two years ago, I hunted a luminous swordfish. Simply sliced and briefly dipped in boiling spiritual spring water—just until slightly cooked—it was exquisitely fresh. The memory lingers to this day."

"Indeed. The simpler the method, the closer to the ingredient's natural flavor," Wang Chan replied perfunctorily.

"Mmm." Daoist Companion Chen nodded lightly, then glanced at the sky. Storing her cup away, she showed signs of leaving.

Without a word, she walked to the courtyard gate. Just as she was about to step out, she turned back to look at Wang Chan. "Hey. My name is Chen Fengshuang, inner disciple of the Misty Cloud Sect."

Had the sun risen from the west?

Wang Chan was taken aback.

Remembering her aloof demeanor last time, he considered putting on airs himself. But having accepted her wine, it wouldn't do to turn hostile now.

Besides, if they really came to blows, he might—possibly, perhaps—not be her match.

So he responded coolly, "Oh. Wang Chan. Rogue cultivator."

"If we meet again, I'll treat you to my version of beggar's chicken."

"You're leaving?"

"Cultivation comes first."

Without looking back, Chen Fengshuang descended the mountain.

Wang Chan held his cup, quietly watching her figure gradually disappear at the distant end of the mountain path. Under the dim moonlight, her silver ponytail swayed gently by the bamboo grove...

A long time passed before Wang Chan snapped out of his reverie, then sighed in relief. Her departure was good—no more constant anxiety.

Though the "White Bone Qi Devouring Strength Method" was profoundly subtle—so much so that even someone as formidable as Daoist Companion Chen couldn't detect it—what if he accidentally slipped up during cultivation someday?

But the more he thought, the more something nagged at him.

After all, wasn't he, Wang Chan, reasonably good-looking? Last time he'd greeted her proactively, she'd been indifferent. Yet this time, because of some beggar's chicken, she'd volunteered her name.

By rough calculation, did that mean he ranked below a chicken?
