# Chapter 36: Midnight Ghost at the Door  

Deep in the night, the world was shrouded in misty darkness.  

Dou Changsheng, seated cross-legged on his bed, slowly opened his eyes. After hours of diligent cultivation, his depleted innate qi had once again replenished. However, his five major qi cavities remained empty. Filling them completely would take more than a day or two.  

Reflecting on the battle from earlier that day, Dou Changsheng couldn't help but marvel at the sheer power of the *Five Elements Seal*. Combat prowess was determined by many factors—innate qi, martial techniques, experience, weapons—but one undeniable truth remained: the more innate qi one possessed, the stronger they were.  

With a sigh, Dou Changsheng lamented his shortcomings—his cultivation time was too short, and his innate qi reserves were too meager. Had he properly cultivated for ten years, accumulating profound qi through the Millennium Earth Pearl, a single strike from him would have surpassed the combined output of all five qi cavities. If those cavities were then filled to the brim with innate qi, the resulting power would be unimaginable.  

Slowly, he drew the Hero's Sword and gently ran his fingers along its cold blade. The weapon's might had exceeded his expectations. In the final clash against Chen Weiquan and Wang Dingli, the sword's sharpness had played a crucial role.  

Above a sharp weapon was a treasure weapon—one imbued with sentience, capable of choosing its master. If the wielder's nature clashed with the weapon's, the treasure weapon would remain dormant, its true potential locked away, rendering it no different from an ordinary sharp blade.  

The Hero's Sword had been forged by the master smith Tang Fangxiong, who was fully capable of crafting a treasure weapon. Yet, he had deliberately left it as a sharp weapon, intending for Tang He to nurture its spirit himself. Once the sword's spirit matured, it would naturally ascend to treasure weapon status, perfectly attuned to its wielder and capable of embodying their martial path, eventually evolving into a divine weapon.  

This was the foresight of great clans—laying the groundwork for Tang He's future.  

Dou Changsheng owed a debt for this kindness, one he would repay in time.  

Polishing the Hero's Sword was part of his daily routine. Though this alone wouldn't awaken its spirit, years of care would deepen their bond.  

After sheathing the sword, Dou Changsheng prepared to rest. The day's events—Tang Qingyan, Chen Weiquan, Lin Daoqi—had left him mentally exhausted. His role in the Three Yang Mountain affair was merely to stir chaos, act as a decoy, and divert attention.  

---  

No sooner had Dou Changsheng lain down than a heavy knocking echoed at his door.  

Instantly alert, he sat up, his hand gripping the hilt of the Hero's Sword beside his pillow. "Who is it?" he called out.  

The door creaked open, and a figure stepped inside, swiftly closing it behind them.  

Standing before Dou Changsheng was a Daoist clad in crimson robes.  

Of the three elders, the Red Sun Daoist appeared the oldest—his hair entirely white, his face deeply lined, his frame gaunt and withered. An air of decay clung to him, as though he were already halfway into the grave.  

The man had remained silent throughout their earlier encounters, leading Dou Changsheng to assume he was disinterested in meddling. Yet here he was, knocking at midnight—clearly not one to stay idle.  

Calmly, Dou Changsheng asked, "Elder Red Sun, what brings you here so late?"  

The Red Sun Daoist fixed him with a penetrating gaze before sighing. "I come seeking survival."  

"The stolen military payroll has shaken the court and drawn the eyes of the world. The four nations watch Three Yang Mountain closely."  

"Within the imperial court, the general and the chancellor are at odds. The missing payroll—other nations hope it was the chancellor's doing, hoping to incite infighting."  

"Or perhaps the general orchestrated it, aiming to carve out a northern fiefdom and establish his own rule."  

"Either outcome would plunge the court into chaos and weaken the nation—a scenario the imperial court cannot abide. If no leads emerge, the factions will not remain passive."  

"The Three Yang Sect will be exterminated—root and branch."  

"The three Xiantian Profound Realm disciples under Elder Green Sun have remained outside, afraid to return, lest they die mysteriously."  

"Our only chance of survival now lies with the Military Governor's faction."  

Dou Changsheng countered, "Why not the emperor? Or the chancellor?"  

The Red Sun Daoist smiled bitterly. "The chancellor has no need for me. Elder Purple Sun has long been in his service. This scheme may deceive the sect leader, but not me."  

"Anything I can do, Elder Purple Sun can do better. Why would the chancellor choose me?"  

"Only the Military Governor lacks influence within the Three Yang Sect—that is where my value lies."  

The Red Sun Daoist had revealed crucial information—exposing Elder Purple Sun's allegiance. Dou Changsheng's trust in him rose to fifty percent.  

After a moment's hesitation, the elder clenched his teeth and continued.  

"Since the passing of our founding patriarch, the Three Yang Sect has lacked an Earth Ranking grandmaster. Though we've had Divine Marvel Realm experts, our prestige has waned."  

"We couldn't even protect the Green Sun Spring, hence this so-called 'Heroes' Assembly.'"  

"Our sect leader, Elder Green Sun, appears meek but is resolute at heart—a man of quiet ambition."  

"I suspect he is behind the payroll theft."  

"Moving such a vast quantity of silver and armor would require considerable manpower."  

"Yet I know of a Daoist secret art—the *Five Ghosts Transport Technique*."  

Dou Changsheng's expression darkened. "Does Elder Green Sun know this art?"  

The Red Sun Daoist shook his head. "Such a technique is esoteric, reserved for Pure Yin grandmasters. Elder Green Sun is merely an ordinary Divine Marvel grandmaster—he couldn't perform it."  

"But I know that not long ago, Tang Qingyan—the 'Night Princess' of the Tang clan in Jiangdu—visited Three Yang Mountain and met privately with Elder Green Sun."  

"She is a Pure Yin grandmaster. Moreover, the Southern Chen's demonic sects run rampant, steeped in the eerie and terrifying."  

"If anyone knows the *Five Ghosts Transport Technique*, she is the prime suspect."  

"To glimpse the Earth Book, she severed her own legs—a price that earned her third place on the Wulin Tower's Movement Techniques Ranking."  

"She shoulders half the weight of the Tang clan in Jiangdu."  

"Though the Demonic Heaven Sect has stronger figures, none can match her speed unless the Demonic Master himself acts."  

"The Tang clan stands unshaken in Jiangdu."  

Wait.  

This contradicts what I knew.  

Wasn't Tang Qingyan's survival a fluke, her legs lost by misfortune?  

She *cut them off herself*?  

The same event, viewed from another angle, took on an entirely different meaning!
