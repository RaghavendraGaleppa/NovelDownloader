# Chapter 37: Punishment

The drawbacks of burning his true essence to gain powerful combat strength became apparent. He was only at the initial stage of Foundation Establishment, but burning his true essence allowed him to completely dominate against Mu Tian, who was at the peak of Foundation Establishment. But true essence, in the end, would run out.

"Pfft!"

Yang Shou spat out a mouthful of blood. Seeing the reinforcements arrive, his first thought was how quickly they had come. His second thought was that he was about to die. He also wouldn't be able to drag Mu Tian and Ding Rui down with him. He felt immense pain, and a hint of regret flashed through his mind.

"I shouldn't have learned the cultivation method from that piece of skin back then. I knew it was a demonic cultivation method... Although I convinced myself it was for revenge, I was probably more attracted by the method of quickly becoming powerful..."

Yang Shou let out a long breath. He had kept this secret for too long; now he could finally let it go. Even if he didn't want to, he had to let it go.

Shu Qing was about to reply, but just then, a *clang* suddenly came from outside the spirit field. A sound rang out. Ding Rui looked up. It was already time for a break, and the sound indicated that a visitor had arrived.

"I'll go open the door!" Shu Qing said. His rain-making work wasn't particularly busy, and the morning's portion was already done.

The formation at the entrance of the spirit field area closed, and a figure somewhat familiar to Ding Rui walked in from outside. This person, familiar with the way, walked directly to Ding Rui's side without the slightest hint of politeness, lightly punching him on the shoulder. Ding Rui raised his hand to block, surprised, "Old Huang, why are you here?"

Shu Qing, after greeting them, went off to cultivate on his own. Old Huang clearly had something to discuss with Ding Rui. As an outer sect disciple now, Old Huang naturally commanded a certain level of respect.

Old Huang's gaze at Ding Rui was still full of resentment, but he eventually regained his composure and said, "I didn't come today to return your spirit rice. That matter will have to wait until I've fully consolidated my cultivation and gone out to complete a mission. Today, I came here not just because I guessed you might be awake and wanted to check on you, but also to have you tell me everything about Yang Shou. I need to report it to the sect."

"Taking a statement!" Ding Rui blurted out.

"What statement?"

"Never mind, you continue. What do I need to do?"
