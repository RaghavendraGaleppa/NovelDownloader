# Chapter 211: Old Xue Originally Didn't Believe It, but Now He's a Bit Suspicious. Refining the Mysterious Pill Once More!

In the secluded courtyard, the moon rose above the branches.

Tang Xiaobao noticed the extreme seriousness in Xue Jing's expression and sensed the gravity of the situation.

"You want to condense a Mysterious Pill again?"

"Exactly."

"Four times?"

"Yes."

Xue Jing couldn't help but take a cold breath.

He scrutinized his grand-disciple's expression and found that Li Mo was serious—more serious than when he had said he wanted to jump into the alchemy furnace.

Condensing four Mysterious Pills...

This idea was even more absurd than the last time.

"Xiao Mo, breaking the pill and cultivating anew to become stronger is all from storybooks. It's all made up by those writers. You absolutely cannot believe it."

Old Xue felt that Li Mo had read too many storybooks. After all, those stories always feature protagonists who lose their cultivation, only to become stronger after starting over.

Xiao Mo was, after all, young, and his master was Shang Wu. He was probably still figuring out his path in the martial arts world on his own.

That was why he was so easily convinced by those unfounded tales.

Li Mo was taken aback and asked, confused, "I don't plan on breaking my pill and starting over."

"Then what are you planning?"

"I plan to condense four additional Mysterious Pills and put them all in my Dantian."

"What the hell?!!"

The five-patterned pill Xue Jing had just accepted fell from his hand with a splat, and he forgot to even pick it up.

He said with deep distress, "It's over, Xiao Bao. I don't know if your Second Senior Sister can cure him this time."

"Old Xue, I'm not sick. Last time, Senior Brother Xiaobao and I went into the furnace together, and we succeeded in the end, didn't we?" Li Mo said with a wry smile.

"The one who got cured but still drools also says he's not sick," Xue Jing's face twitched, recalling the time the two of them had achieved their Mysterious Pills together.

"Not every wild idea is easily realized. Last time was just a fluke."

"Let's put it this way, can your Dantian even hold four Mysterious Pills?"

"It can."

"Right, I knew..." Xue Jing had only said half of his sentence, intending to continue persuading Li Mo to turn back from the wrong path, when he suddenly froze.

In front of Li Mo, not far away, three Mysterious Pills were already floating.

One was extreme Yang, one was extreme Yin, and one was a Sword Pill.

The three were moving in a mysterious and unpredictable trajectory, not interfering with each other. It was dizzying to look at, yet one could clearly perceive it.

The three Mysterious Pills were perfectly harmonious, with no signs of conflict.

"That looks so fun," Tang Xiaobao's eyes lit up.

His small body shimmered with a faint golden light and transformed into a Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill with eight of its nine apertures open. It flew into the middle of the three Mysterious Pills and revolved with them.

"Ahahaha."

Tang Xiaobao was jumping around joyfully.

"Be careful, Senior Brother Xiaobao. Don't run into the Sword Pill. It looks round, but it's actually very sharp."

"Hmph, don't worry."

After Tang Xiaobao joined in, the four Mysterious Pills danced together, still without any sense of obstruction.

Xue Jing: "..."

He couldn't figure out how this was possible.

No wonder Xiao Bao had said that Xiao Mo's Dantian was huge.

By the way, what kind of体质 (physique) does this kid have?

Even Xiao Bing'er's Dantian wouldn't be at this level...

He coughed lightly and said, "If you want to condense more Mysterious Pills, you can't condense duplicates. Thus, you have to practice different cultivation methods one by one."

"This is too time-consuming and laborious. The gain isn't worth the effort. It's better to focus your energy on observing the spirit."

While controlling Senior Brother Xiaobao and the three Mysterious Pills, Li Mo smiled and said, "Rest assured, Old Xue. I have quite a talent for cultivation methods."

Xue Jing hesitated. "Even with a talent..."

Li Mo said, "I'm quite talented in practicing cultivation methods. I can learn three to five of them in a day."

---

The premise was that his martial arts comprehension was sufficient.

Thanks to the feedback from Princess Jiang recently and the investments made in Hengyun Sword City, his once-dry martial arts comprehension had been replenished.

Xue Jing: "?"

Old Xue expressed his disbelief.

But after the time it took to drink a cup of tea, he began to doubt it.

He当场 (on the spot) took out two superior cultivation methods, and Li Mo had mastered them completely within the time it took to drink a cup of tea.

Actually... Li Mo was holding back, afraid of giving Old Xue high blood pressure. He had pretended to be in deep thought for quite a while...

So.

The final piece of the puzzle was still missing to complete Li Mo's plan.

Xue Jing's hand, stroking his long beard, trembled slightly. "But my method of external pills is not perfect. The Mysterious Pills you condense yourself are ultimately different from Xiao Bao's."

"I've already thought about that," Li Mo said as he took out the transcribed *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of the Highest Clarity* from his robe and spread it out on the table. "Regarding your external pill technique, I happened to come across an ancient book, which gave me a few immature ideas..."

"If we add Senior Brother Xiaobao's assistance from the side..."

"Then the success rate of this plan will be... one hundred percent!"

"An alchemy scripture? Let me see what this is about..."

After flipping through the scripture.

Old Xue's expression went from solemn, to shocked, to a sudden realization.

Finally... it was filled with wisdom!

...

In the end, Xue Jing, with a complex expression, started the furnace to refine the 'pill'.

Inside the alchemy furnace.

Li Mo and Xiao Bao were once again sitting in their respective positions from last time.

"Senior Brother Xiaobao, everything else is the same as before. The difference is, you need to try to circulate the medicinal power according to my meridian paths."

His idea was to follow the external pill method in the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of the Highest Clarity* to avoid the awkwardness of searching for the pill with a lantern. Furthermore, he would use Senior Brother Xiaobao's pill power to step on the accelerator for the pill's formation.

"Alright!" Tang Xiaobao was extremely confident.

Everything was ready.

The next moment.

The raging flames of the Dragon-Tiger Alchemy Furnace, like a volcanic eruption, instantly filled the chamber.

Li Mo was also a different person now. The karmic fire he spurred with his true essence was of a completely different quality compared to before. With his strengthened soul, his control over the flame had become even more meticulous.

"I feel like it's a bit hot," Tang Xiaobao said, sounding quite happy.

He felt that a large amount of natural treasures had turned into pure medicinal power in a short time.

Looking at the one person and one pill inside the furnace, Xue Jing's expression was not just complex; there was also some excitement in his heart.

Perhaps...

The key to Xiao Bao's nine apertures reaching perfection in the future lay with his grand-disciple.

He had once thought that he would not live to see Xiao Bao's nine apertures reach perfection in his lifetime and could only entrust his hope to the descendants of the Alchemy Peak.

But now, he saw a glimmer of hope.

He formed an alchemy seal.

With Li Mo as the main actor and Tang Xiaobao and Xue Jing as support, the methods in the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of the Highest Clarity* began to reveal their magic.

The various refined materials condensed into the shape of a pill.

This was still just a prototype.

Old Xue had only managed to get this far back then.

That was why his external pills would "see you tomorrow" (fail).

At this moment, Tang Xiaobao had already transformed into his true form and was resonating slightly as Li Mo circulated the *Eight Treasures Devouring Gold Art*.

The prototype of the Mysterious Pill resonated with it as well. Inside, patterns appeared, as if carved or naturally grown.

It was slowly, but surely, approaching a true Mysterious Pill...

Did my dear viewers bring me any power-ups? (Searching)
If not, that's okay. I don't really want them... okay, this little author really wants them orz.
