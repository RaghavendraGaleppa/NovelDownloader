# Chapter 182: The Shocking Scheme

Above the vast East Sea, a bone-white flying vessel cut through the clouds, scattering flocks of seabirds in its path.

Even after five days, the people aboard still shuddered at the memory of their recent ordeal. Each recollection reminded them of how fortunate they were to survive, thanks to the strategic planning of their envoy, who had accurately pinpointed a weak point in the righteous faction's defenses, allowing them to break through the Qingzhou coastline in one decisive move.

Of course, in reality, Lin Shan hadn't foreseen the enemy's movements—someone had tipped him off.

That night, when the three Nascent Soul elders of the Zixiao Sect arrived together, the Sword Saint Ma had fearlessly charged into the "Nine Heavens Thunderfall," buying time for everyone while also breaking their seals. Thus began a desperate escape.

All the demonic cultivators, overjoyed at regaining their cultivation, scattered in all directions.

Simultaneously, the righteous cultivators also regained their strength, and the Zixiao Sect had brought reinforcements to encircle them.

Yin Wuming of the Blood River Hall, a rising star of the demonic path, lived up to his reputation by single-handedly holding off several Golden Core cultivators from the righteous faction. His "Joint Law Enforcement and Investigation Team of the Three Demonic Sects" was composed of elites who drew the bulk of the pursuers' attention.

Taking advantage of the chaos, Lin Shan and his group broke through under cover of darkness. The battlefield was a chaotic mess, with spells and magical artifacts flying everywhere. His followers tightly surrounded him as they fought their way out, narrowly escaping danger with the help of the Black Skeleton Demon Lord.

Just as they were about to clear the encirclement, a voice transmission reached Lin Shan's ears.

It was from the Beast Taming Valley's "Elder Pei," who, grateful for Lin Shan's care over the past two days, returned the favor by subtly pointing him toward an escape route. Though Elder Pei didn't explicitly state which section of the coastline was weakly defended, Lin Shan's keen intuition allowed him to deduce the location.

It had to be said—Elder Pei was a man of his word, repaying kindness without delay. Moreover, Lin Shan was merely a Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator; letting him escape wouldn't affect the larger situation.

After much wandering, hiding, and evading pursuit, they finally managed to flee the mainland and enter the East Sea.

The East Sea was still under the control of the demonic faction, while the righteous alliance was busy reclaiming lost territory in the eastern inland regions and hunting down scattered remnants of the defeated forces. Until the inland was fully secured, the East Sea would remain relatively safe.

However, given the current situation, anyone with eyes could see that the East Sea would likely fall soon as well. It was only a matter of time.

The demonic faction had suffered heavy losses in this battle. Losing their eastern territories in the Great Song Dynasty meant the collapse of their "inland family and sect alliance." Combined with the casualties among the East Sea cultivators and the core forces of the three demonic sects, their vitality had been utterly crushed.

They no longer had the strength to oppose the righteous faction.

Lin Shan was deeply troubled about the future and worried about the fate of the "Sword Saint Ma." He didn't know whether the man was alive or dead.

That night, three Nascent Soul cultivators had ganged up on him—an extremely perilous situation. Even the "Dharma Protector" from before would have struggled to survive, forced to summon the so-called "World Honored One's phantom" (the lotus-skirted woman). 

Could a mere swordsman from the martial world survive such odds?

"Tsk, I almost thought I'd gained a Nascent Soul backer, only for him to..."

Lin Shan sighed despondently, beginning to wonder if he truly had a "jinx" constitution.

Back in the Lin family of Qinghe County, both Lin Fan and the pawnshop owner had taken the fall for him. Later, during his travels, the escort team he joined was ambushed, and Master Pu suffered because of him before disappearing without a trace. On the journey from the imperial capital to Yichuan, not only did his companion Huang the Immortal die, but out of the six in their group—including the "straw-hat woman" he killed in the Gongsun family—only he survived. Then, during the righteous-demonic war, he finally secured the backing of the Black Lotus Sect's leader, only for that support to vanish as well...

Lin Shan guiltily glanced at the people around him. When they had set out from the East Sea, he had over a hundred followers, a grand and lively entourage. Now, after their狼狈 escape back to the East Sea, only twenty-some remained. It was nothing short of tragic.

*Sigh*... At least they didn't know his history, or they might have abandoned him long ago.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, noticing his unease, assumed he was still worried about Sword Saint Ma and surprisingly offered comfort.

"Cheer up. Your newly acquired 'discount master' probably isn't as simple as he seems. He likely won't die so easily."

"Oh?"

Lin Shan snapped out of his thoughts and looked at the skeleton beside him. The flickering of its soulfire suggested this wasn't just idle talk.

"What makes you say that?"

"No concrete evidence. But some of his traits remind me of ancient legends..."

Lin Shan's curiosity was piqued. He knew the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had traveled across many worlds. In terms of experience, few could compare, and it knew a thing or two about many ancient secrets.

"Have you ever heard of the term 'sword cultivator'?" the skeleton asked, turning to stare at him.

"Sword cultivator?" Lin Shan pondered for a moment before answering uncertainly, "You mean those who use swords as their lifebound artifacts, nurturing them in their dantian, summoning them only when flying or fighting, forsaking all other external possessions to focus solely on refining their swords?"

"No! Those aren't true sword cultivators—just cultivators wearing the skin of sword practitioners while still following the immortal path's system."

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord gazed at the distant horizon, where flocks of seagulls soared and schools of fish leaped, its tone growing distant and solemn.

"True sword cultivators were the protagonists of the world several epochs ago. They comprehended the Sword Dao, tempered their sword hearts, elevated their sword intent, condensed their sword momentum, and constructed their sword domains. They cultivated sword essence within their bodies—a completely different system from ours."

"During my travels, I once visited an extremely ancient world with ruins from the previous epoch. The fragmented records there left a deep impression on me."

"Legends say that in the myriad realms of the void, one chaotic epoch spans 129.6 million years. Each epoch has its own cultivation system. For example, the previous epoch was the Sorcerer-Shaman civilization, the one before that was the Blood Path Asura civilization, and further back were the Confucian, Sword, Witch, and Martial Dao civilizations..."

"Our current epoch is the Immortal Dao civilization. Traces of past epochs occasionally resurface within it, but they're merely superficial, their core still rooted in immortal cultivation."

"Take the so-called Confucian techniques, blood path techniques, body refinement techniques, and witch curses in the cultivation world today—they're all just heterodox branches assimilated by the Immortal Dao."

"Have you noticed how mortal martial artists in this world can only reach the Xiantian realm at most? Beyond that, their path is severed. That's because this epoch's protagonist is the Immortal Dao. Martial artists are doomed unless they abandon their path and switch to immortal cultivation. Otherwise, they'll return to dust after a mere century..."

"The tide of epochs, ordained by heaven, shifts with each era."

...

After hearing this, Lin Shan was enlightened—and deeply envious of the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's experiences. To know such secrets, it must have seen more than even some ancient relics. Was there anything it *didn't* know?

*I should squeeze this guy dry and make him spill all his knowledge...*

Meanwhile, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, sensing that Lin Shan's reliance on it had waned since acquiring the Primordial Spirit Treasure (even the treasure's artifact spirit surpassed it in formations), was desperate to prove its worth.

Both harbored ulterior motives, neither willing to part ways just yet, locked in a battle of wits.

"So, when you mentioned 'true sword cultivators,' you meant..." Lin Shan pressed.

"Exactly—your so-called master has the makings of one!" the skeleton declared emphatically. "That night, he demonstrated not only a sword heart of clarity but also sword intent that pierced the heavens. I even sensed sword momentum from him!"

"Sword momentum? What's the significance?" Lin Shan didn't grasp the connection.

"Momentum is the external manifestation of soul power, capable of stirring the world's spiritual energy."

With this hint, Lin Shan instantly understood. "Stirring spiritual energy—that's a Nascent Soul-level ability, the hallmark of divine abilities and spells!"

The skeleton nodded and elaborated, "In the Immortal Dao system, each stage has distinct features: Qi Refining transforms spiritual sense, Foundation Establishment extends divine sense outward, Golden Core purifies mana, and Nascent Soul forms a dharma body..."

"At the Nascent Soul stage, the disparity in combat power among peers is vast. Setting aside external factors like divine abilities and treasures, one's comprehension and application of 'momentum' can tip the scales of battle."

"The dharma body is the external expression of momentum, helping cultivators better manipulate spiritual energy to amplify spell power. Some keep their dharma bodies internalized, others project them outwardly. A rare few geniuses condense golden dharma bodies, and some can even manifest them as independent avatars..."

"In short, the later the stage, the more critical comprehension becomes, affecting every aspect of cultivation. The gap between individuals widens exponentially."

Lin Shan sucked in a cold breath. "Does that mean battles at higher levels could end in an instant? Some supreme experts might suppress their foes with a single move, leaving no chance for resistance?"

"Don't worry too much. True prodigies are rare, and the cultivation world is vast—the odds of encountering one are slim. Most cultivators are mediocrities. Few rise from obscurity to supremacy like yours truly..."

Lin Shan gave the boastful skeleton a strange look. *If you were really that amazing, would you have failed in your expedition to the Third Hell World's Cerberus territory, gotten your main body beaten into silence, and resorted to venting your frustration in another realm?*

Unaware of his thoughts, the skeleton continued, "Your 'discount master' has awakened sword momentum, granting him the ability to manipulate spiritual energy—equivalent to the Nascent Soul stage in the Sword Dao system. Combined with the vast mana from his possession of the late-Nascent Soul Dharma Protector, his true strength is formidable. Even if he couldn't defeat three Nascent Souls at once, he likely survived..."

"However, his path isn't a mere reskin of immortal cultivation. He walks both the sword and immortal paths—a defiance of heaven's will. This road will be fraught with hardship, as the Immortal Dao is this epoch's protagonist. The emergence of the Sword Dao, a system from an ancient epoch, might draw heavenly retribution..."

"Still, if he persists and advances relentlessly, his future achievements could be unimaginable. He might even grow into a true powerhouse across the cosmos."

Lin Shan's heart raced, but he couldn't help asking, "We immortal cultivators face heavenly tribulations, but surviving them grants us heavenly dew that enhances our aptitude and clears our path. If my master is targeted by heaven, wouldn't he receive no rewards? How would his potential improve?"

The skeleton hesitated before speculating, "As an anomaly, he'll undoubtedly face suppression without post-tribulation rewards. But since he awakened and embarked on the sword path, perhaps..."

"An inherited legacy from a past life? The will of the Sword Dao epoch? A pawn in some ancient scheme? An experiment by an elder? An investment from higher realms?"

The skeleton listed several possibilities, but Lin Shan suddenly had a wild thought: "What if... *all* of those are true?"

"F***!!!"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord nearly jumped out of its bones in fright before urgently grabbing Lin Shan. "Quick! Sever all ties with that master of yours! Otherwise, not only will you suffer, but everyone around you will too!"

"Listen to me—these waters are too deep for you!"

"Is it really that serious?" Lin Shan was taken aback by the overreaction.

"Of course it is!" The skeleton was practically hopping mad. "This involves intricate power struggles and ancient schemes spanning epochs—far beyond your capacity. You're nothing but trouble! I'm starting to think you're a walking calamity..."

"Wait! You're also entangled with eldritch beings! You *are* a calamity!"

The skeleton's soulfire blazed as its thoughts raced: "Not just that! Back when you used that curse technique in front of me—a mere Foundation Establishment brat casting a sect-suppressing spell without any incantation—don't tell me you've already condensed a *seed of divine ability*???"

"I'm a Nascent Soul skeleton from the underworld, and even my innate bone path abilities haven't formed seeds. And you, a nobody, already have one?"

"Absurd! Utterly absurd! There's no way you forged that seed yourself. Some immortal realm heavyweight must have bestowed it upon you. You're already a chosen investment!"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, a seasoned traveler across worlds, had pieced together Lin Shan's secrets from mere fragments. And it wasn't done yet.

Its soulfire burned even fiercer as it pushed its deductive abilities to the limit.

"That immortal who contracted with our hell world—his curse technique originated from the Witch Dao civilization of ancient epochs. He's probably some immortal realm bigshot obsessed with archaeology."

"Usually, such figures—who neglect their immortal cultivation to delve into other civilizations—are ancient monsters who've lived countless years, having reached the pinnacle of the immortal path and seeking breakthroughs elsewhere."

"For you to gain such a figure's favor, receiving a curse technique tailor-made for spreading misfortune... you must *be* a walking disaster! A source of calamity! My earlier guess was spot-on!"

"No wonder those eldritch abominations flock to you, drawn like moths to a flame. Damn it all, why did I have to get stuck with you?"

...

"Hey, who are you calling a 'thing'? *You're* the thing!"

Lin Shan calmly pushed aside the skeleton's trembling finger, then dropped all pretense. His eyes gleamed eerily as he leaned in with a sinister grin.

"Gah!"

The skeleton collapsed onto the deck, trembling like a lamb before slaughter.

Lin Shan burst into laughter, thoroughly amused by his own prank—though cold sweat drenched his back.

Was he scared? Of course! But would he admit it? Never.

With flawless composure, he lied through his teeth: "Brother Black Skeleton, you're overthinking it. My ability to use that technique isn't innate—it's thanks to a treasure."

"What treasure?"

The skeleton, still wary, kept its distance as if fearing a repeat of past trauma.

After a moment's thought, Lin Shan produced the "Seven Nails Book Straw Doll."

Though his divine ability seed allowed him to craft such dolls at will, this one—a legacy artifact of the Witch Dao Sect—had an additional function: a link to an immortal artifact in the void, enabling remote observation of cursed targets.

It wasn't essential, but every little bit helped.

The skeleton eyed the doll but dared not touch it, fearing it was a "chosen investment" from an immortal heavyweight. Interfering with such schemes meant certain death.

"Here, take a closer look. I'm not lying!"

"No, no! Keep it away! That's an immortal's gift—I don't want to die!"

The skeleton scrambled backward across the deck in terror.

Lin Shan rolled his eyes at its paranoia and instead took out the Void Star Disk.

"Fine, how about examining this instead?"

"Gladly!"

The skeleton sprang up eagerly.

"Get lost!"

Lin Shan smacked it aside and angrily stowed the treasure away. *I knew it—this guy still covets my stuff!*

Chagrined, the skeleton realized its greed had overridden its fear. The sight of a Primordial Spirit Treasure had banished all caution.

*Ah well, I guess I'm the type to risk death for profit.*

This episode only strengthened its resolve to obtain the treasure. 

*To hell with eldritch horrors and conspiracies—when tangible gains are at stake, unknown dangers mean nothing! We skeletons live for the moment!*

Their mutual distrust simmered beneath a veneer of camaraderie.

...

Time flew.

A week later, they reached a volcanic archipelago deep in the East Sea, where the demonic faction's temporary headquarters loomed in the distance.
