# Chapter 61: Ninth Layer of Inner Qi! The Grand Elder Pays a Visit!

The bright moon hung high in the sky, dotted with countless stars.

Li Zhengjing poured himself a cup of wine and downed it in one gulp.

The wall-perching bird was already drunk, muttering something about whose nest of seven chicks they were and how it just couldn't accept it...

The branches of the Five Elements Creation Tree swayed drunkenly as they curled around a wine cup, pouring the contents into the soil of the clay pot.

"White Phoenix Divine Bird, eating it prolongs life... Master, how about we roast this drunk bird for a midnight snack..." it slurred.

Li Zhengjing ignored them. After finishing the last cup of wine, he gripped the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber and gazed at the pitch-black night sky devoid of moon and stars.

Elder Gu was dead, and once again, he had lost his direction.

The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord had vanished back into the shadows.

Over the past two days, he had felt lost. But now, he had come to a realization. The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord was simply too powerful. Even if he knew the divine lord's true identity now, he still wouldn't be able to oppose him.

So what difference did it make whether the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord was in the open or hidden in the shadows?

Sooner or later, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord would appear before him!

"All these hidden dangers, fears, and sorrows stem from one thing—he is too strong, and I am too weak."

Holding the broken jade piece in his left hand, Li Zhengjing thought to himself, "I won't become the next Yuan Zhengfeng!"

He flipped his hand and took out a graded spirit stone, popping it into his mouth.

This time, he wasn't using it to activate the golden page with spiritual energy.

This time, he was only borrowing the golden page to absorb spiritual energy and nourish himself.

As the spiritual energy entered his body, the sound of tigers and leopards roared within him, refining his inner qi.

He gathered all his inner qi into his dantian, filling it to the brim—nine inches high!

In the next moment, he dispersed all the inner qi in his dantian, letting it flow through his limbs, bones, and meridians.

In a daze, he felt as if his inner qi was everywhere within his body.

"Is this the peak of inner qi?"

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted as he murmured, "It still doesn't feel like enough."

His gaze fell on his left arm.

His left arm contained thirty-six thousand five hundred muscle fibers. Using the Sword Nurturing Technique, he could store the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi, refined from his inner qi, within them.

After some thought, he activated the Sword Nurturing Technique again, storing unrefined inner qi in his left arm as well.

Only when his left arm began to ache from the strain, nearing its limit, did he stop.

At this point, he gathered the inner qi from his meridians and returned it to his dantian—now only five inches high.

"So, I can appear as a peak ninth-layer inner qi cultivator or hide as a mid-level fifth-layer cultivator?"

"Or... can I continue cultivating within the inner qi realm?"

"If I think about it, the thirty-six thousand five hundred muscle fibers in my left arm can serve as a second 'dantian' to store inner qi."

"That means, with two sources of inner qi combined, my 'peak inner qi realm' could reach as high as the thirteenth layer?"

A glimmer of understanding dawned in Li Zhengjing's eyes. "Does this mean I no longer need to deliberately slow my cultivation progress?"

Just as he was feeling pleased, he heard a noise outside the courtyard.

With a thought, he released some of the inner qi stored in his left arm, restoring his outward appearance to the seventh layer of inner qi.

Then, with a kick each, he sent the Five Elements Creation Tree and the wall-perching bird flying back into the house, landing directly inside the phoenix tree box.

When he opened the courtyard gate, he saw an unfamiliar, tall old man standing outside.

The old man appeared to be in his seventies, his face weathered with age, but his posture was upright, his body robust and towering.

Standing before him, the man's powerful aura made it seem as though he was in the prime of his life.

A crushing pressure emanated from him!

For a moment, Li Zhengjing sensed a presence similar to that of Lu Huaiyuan, the Diamond Temple's Buddha Child, and the Young Sect Master of Kunlun.

Peak true qi! Perfect Heavenly Cycle!

"I am Chen Zhu," the old man said calmly.

Li Zhengjing's eyes narrowed.

This was the Grand Elder of the inner sect, a peak true qi cultivator said to be only half a step away from transcending the mortal realm and attaining the Human Immortal realm!

Since joining the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, all the suppression he had faced was tied to the Chen Clan—and by extension, to this very man, the highest authority of the Chen Clan.

And now, the man had come in person?

"Yuan Zhengfeng's recommended disciple truly lives up to his reputation as a prodigy. Reaching the inner qi realm in half a year and advancing to the upper levels in just over a month—truly astonishing."

Chen Zhu stepped into the courtyard and said indifferently, "You slew the Venom King Xin Xuan and earned widespread fame. The Sect Master has praised you and issued the Hollow Gold Token, granting you status equal to an inner sect elder. There's no need for formalities."

He glanced at Li Zhengjing. "The Chen Clan's juniors suppressed you in the outer sect, and after you entered the inner sect, they repeatedly sought to kill you. I learned of this after emerging from seclusion."

Before Li Zhengjing could respond, Chen Zhu tossed a bundle toward him.

With a flick of his finger, his true qi unraveled the bundle.

The stench of blood instantly filled the courtyard.

Li Zhengjing's pupils contracted in shock.

"This is..."

"Chen Yang's ears," Chen Zhu said flatly. "He acted without my orders. These disobedient ears were useless—I cut them off as an apology to you."

Li Zhengjing fell silent, staring at the pile of ears on the ground. "Chen Yang only has one pair of ears. There are hundreds here..."

Chen Zhu replied coolly, "That useless Chen Youyu is already dead. He had no wife or children, and his remaining relatives are all of the Chen bloodline, so I let it go. But Zhou Shaojie, Fan Guilin, Wu Chi, and Lin Bixiu—the four of them had kin outside the sect..."

Li Zhengjing frowned. "You killed their families?"

Chen Zhu brushed his sleeves. "They acted without authorization, breaking my rules. Exterminating their entire clans serves as a warning to the other Chen Clan retainers to behave. Consider this my satisfactory apology to an outstanding disciple like you."

He looked at Li Zhengjing and asked slowly, "But it seems you're still unsatisfied?"

Li Zhengjing's expression turned cold as he glanced at the ears on the ground. "By killing them, Grand Elder is trying to tell me that everything that happened before was their own doing, not your orders—that you had nothing to do with it?"

"That is the truth," Chen Zhu said calmly. "But the reason for my anger isn't that they acted against you without permission. It's..."

He sighed. "If they were going to act, they should have done it decisively, with absolute certainty of killing you outright! But they were neither decisive nor thorough, allowing you to grow instead. That is the true reason for my displeasure."

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing remained expressionless. "I thought you were here to wash your hands of the matter completely. I didn't expect such honesty. So now... will the Grand Elder take action himself?"

"Had I known you possessed the potential to threaten me, I might have had you buried the moment you entered the outer sect."

Chen Zhu clasped his hands behind his back and turned to leave. "But now, you are a rising star of the sect, a quasi-true disciple nurtured by the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. If you don't die young, you will become a pillar of the sect in the future. Between us, there is no life-or-death enmity. Let this matter end here."

"Wait!" Li Zhengjing suddenly called out.

Chen Zhu slowly turned back, his gaze growing cold.

Li Zhengjing flicked the bundle back with his saber.

"These things are staining my courtyard."

"You're clever," Chen Zhu said.

With a wave of his true qi, the bundle disintegrated into ashes.

As he turned to leave, he said indifferently, "Had you kept those ears, the Enforcement Hall would have arrived shortly to arrest you on charges of ambushing Chen Yang and cutting off his ears."

Li Zhengjing watched his departing figure and spat in disdain. "Old fox! Trying to trap me?"

He closed the courtyard gate and returned to his room to rest. When dawn broke, he rose, washed up, and prepared to train. But just then, a shadow enveloped the entire courtyard.

Li Zhengjing looked up, awestruck, and muttered, "How many spirit stones could I get if I dismantled that?"
