Chapter 64: Time Accelerated

"Seven Emotions and Six Desires Sacred Art? Can King Xiaoyao explain this?" Prime Minister Liu looked at King Xiaoyao with a grim expression. He had heard of this ancient sacred art before; its power was immense. Cultivating this sacred art had only two outcomes: either one successfully cultivated it and became a Sacred Lord who controlled the Seven Emotions and Six Desires, or one lost all seven emotions and six desires, becoming an emotionless being. And 99% of those who cultivate this sacred art end up with the latter. When Prime Minister Liu thought about this kid cultivating such a technique while still entangled with Liu Yan, his heart twisted.

"This..." King Xiaoyao looked embarrassed, his eyes flickering as he stammered.

The mirror in the center flashed with golden light, and Zhou Zui, enveloped in the radiance, appeared in the grand hall. King Xiaoyao breathed a sigh of relief, buying himself some time.

Zhou Zui opened his eyes and, seeing the scene in the grand hall, spoke, "Greetings, Your Majesty. Greetings, Seniors."

Emperor Qin nodded slightly and began, "This elite..." Emperor Qin then spoke a long string of formal pleasantries before finally announcing the official end of the competition. Someone led Zhou Zui away to claim his champion's reward.

Zhou Tian didn't know what the rewards for the regular Youth Grand Competition were, but he had gleaned some information about the elite competition's rewards from the discussion among the group of powerful figures nearby. It seemed to be something called the "Spiritual Essence Pool," rumored to be condensed from the essence of heaven and earth, and not something easily formed. Overall, it was extremely precious, having a miraculous effect on accumulating Dharma Idols, and could significantly shorten the path to becoming a Saint.

Then, the assembly dispersed. Everyone went their own way. When they arrived, it was Zhou Tian and Zhou Yi, but on the way back, only Zhou Tian remained, as Zhou Yi had been kept by Emperor Qin. Not just Zhou Yi, but representatives from several other major powers were also kept behind, shrouded in mystery, as if there were important matters to discuss.

In the grand hall after Zhou Tian left, Emperor Qin sat at the head, divine light flickering in his eyes as he spoke, "Gentlemen, what are your plans for that colossal world in the void?"

"Plans? What plans?" The Daoist feigned ignorance, took a sip of wine, and asked.

"Let's not play guessing games, everyone. My Heavenly Qin's vanguard has already pierced through the world barrier and entered that world. Although they are restricted by the world's will and cannot be overly active, messages are still coming through..." Glancing at the silent representatives of the major powers, Emperor Qin continued, "This world is not something any single one of our forces can devour alone. I hope to conduct an initial exchange of intelligence with all of you!"

Silence met his words. Emperor Qin cursed inwardly. These people truly wouldn't act without seeing a clear advantage, but he knew he'd do the same if he were in their position. After all, it concerned the interests of their respective major powers, and they couldn't respond lightly.

"Allow me to start. That realm is currently in the midst of a catastrophic disaster. They seem to be aware of it and refer to that catastrophe as the 'Calamity of Investiture of Gods!'"

Still no one responded. This was common knowledge; everyone already knew.

"That realm has a total of seven Half-Step Heavenly Venerate existences. We are still investigating whether there are any higher-level beings." Emperor Qin directly revealed crucial information.

A moment later, the person from the Fools' Syndicate's eyes stirred, and he spoke, "My Fools' Syndicate has concrete intelligence: there is also a Heavenly Venerate-level existence in that realm, whose power, with the home-field advantage, is no less than that of a Supreme Heavenly Venerate!"

The Imperial Preceptor nodded almost imperceptibly from the side. This was a pre-arranged setup; otherwise, sharing intelligence wouldn't have been so simple.

"That realm has three races in total: the Human Race is dominant, and there are two other races they call the Witch and Demon Races. However, in ancient times, these two races suffered heavy losses and are now largely in a semi-reclusive state. Yet, their foundations are profound and should not be underestimated." Fergus immediately followed. The forces behind him had already revealed their bottom line when he arrived. There wasn't much he could say, so he had to quickly state what he could, or others might preempt him, leaving him only with truly critical information to reveal.

"Three of the Half-Step Heavenly Venerates are on the same side, seemingly formed from the legacy of a super-powerful being who created that world." The Daoist from the Dao Alliance said.

"This catastrophe takes the rise and fall of two human nations as its primary battleground," Li Lingyi said. Although he had lost face in Heavenly Qin, he could still distinguish priorities when it concerned the overall situation.

"Several powerful individuals have names passed down from ancient times, and their strength is likely no less than those Half-Step Heavenly Venerates," said the Wraith Assassin beneath the white hood.

"It is suspected that someone of Half-Step Heavenly Venerate caliber is instigating this catastrophe from behind the scenes," Monk Zhikong said slowly.

"The Calamity Lord is suspected to have already appeared," the Fatty from the Treasure Trove Pavilion said.

After everyone had spoken in turn, the atmosphere fell silent once more, as everyone realized that this basic information was largely already known.

"This is a good start," Emperor Qin said, unfazed. Trust was built step by step, and this was already an excellent beginning.

"According to the Star Seer of the Fools' Syndicate, the Calamity Qi has condensed considerably and is likely to erupt soon. I hope everyone can share what they know, so as not to miss the optimal timing!"

A group of people glared at the Fools' Syndicate representative nearby. 'Scheming opportunists,' they thought. 'They badmouth Heavenly Qin outside every day, acting as if they're mortal enemies, yet secretly they're winking and colluding. Shameless!'

"One more thing," the Fools' Syndicate representative said calmly, ignoring their gazes. "The Fools' Syndicate has just measured that the emergence time of the Heavenly Mandate in the Unclaimed Lands has suddenly been moved up. It will happen within the next two years. Therefore, the time for the Grand Competition of the Eight Provinces must be advanced."

This news indeed startled everyone, as they had not received any such information. When it came to divining heavenly secrets, they truly couldn't compare to the Fools' Syndicate.

After exchanging glances, the Daoist casually said, "Then let's set a time. We don't mind."

"How about half a month from now?" the Fatty from the Treasure Trove Pavilion said with a chuckle. The sooner it started, the sooner they could begin making money, which was naturally what they wanted.

"Agreed." "Agreed." "..." Everyone seconded the motion. Such matters they could decide directly without needing to consult those behind them.

"Then the time will be set for half a month from now," Emperor Qin concluded, as he was the only true faction leader present.

"The temporal fluctuation for this emergence of heavenly secrets is quite unusual. There's a high probability that someone from the Ancient Ninth Continent is meddling from behind the scenes, so we must be cautious this time."

"If they dare to extend their claws, I'll chop them off!" Cold light flashed in Fergus's eyes. Countless data scrolled across his tactical goggles. He was a war fanatic, filled with passion for all things related to combat.

The others felt the same. If they could beat the living daylights out of them back then, they could do it again!

Emperor Qin remained silent. He had merely offered a friendly reminder; whether they took it to heart was their business. He glanced at Zhikong but still didn't mention the matter of the Sacred Demon.
