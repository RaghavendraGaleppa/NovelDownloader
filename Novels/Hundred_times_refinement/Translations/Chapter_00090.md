# Chapter 40: Cultivator Intelligence  

By noon, cultivators began trickling back from outside. Since low-level cultivators couldn't sustain themselves without food, the post house provided free meals during mealtime—and the food was quite tasty.  

Lin Xuan finished his meal early. With nothing else to do, he didn’t return to his room. Instead, he sat in the dining hall sipping tea.  

First, it helped pass the time until the afternoon trading session began. Second, people often shared their experiences and observations over meals. For those who paid attention, useful intelligence could easily be gleaned in such places.  

He was seated by the window on the second floor, casually sipping tea while seemingly admiring the scenery outside. In truth, his ears were keenly tuned to the surrounding chatter.  

Though the noise was chaotic, it posed no challenge for a cultivator with strong spiritual sense. Unless someone was using mana to transmit their words secretly, every conversation could be heard clearly.  

"Hey, did any of you attend this morning’s auction?"  

A grating voice successfully drew everyone’s attention. Lin Xuan glanced over—it was a burly man dressed in coarse clothing, the typical appearance of a rogue cultivator.  

"What, did you participate in the bidding, old brother?" A chubby youth chimed in, his face full of admiration.  

The man flushed. "Us rogue cultivators don’t have the means to compete. I just went to watch the spectacle."  

"Oh." The crowd immediately lost interest, returning to their tea and meals.  

"Hey, listen to me!" The man clearly craved attention and grew anxious when ignored. "Do you know what treasures were up for auction? Just this morning, three low-grade spirit artifacts, two mid-grade, and even one high-grade spirit artifact appeared!"  

At the mention of spirit artifacts, the surrounding cultivators perked up. Though simplified versions of magic treasures, spirit artifacts were still incredibly powerful. Many Foundation Establishment cultivators didn’t even possess them, let alone rogue cultivators at the Qi Refining stage.  

Most of those present had never seen one in person but had heard their elders describe their formidable power.  

"Damn, I didn’t expect actual spirit artifacts to be auctioned. I should’ve skipped the stalls and gone to watch. Even if I couldn’t afford them, at least I’d have seen something extraordinary."  

"Hmph, you think spectating was that easy? Just to enter the auction, you had to pay a ticket fee of one Marrow-Cleansing Pill," sneered an elderly-looking cultivator from a corner.  

The rogue cultivators were stunned. Even watching required a precious pill? Their expressions toward the burly man became a mix of admiration and disdain—some saw him as bold, others as a fool for wasting resources just to satisfy his curiosity.  

Regardless of their opinions, their interest in the spirit artifacts grew, and they eagerly pressed the man for details. He obliged with animated descriptions.  

"You should’ve seen the power of those artifacts! A single strike from a mid-grade spirit artifact turned a ten-thousand-pound boulder into dust..."  

Though the man’s personality leaned toward showmanship, his storytelling was compelling. The listeners were enthralled.  

"So who ended up winning those artifacts?"  

"Who else? The powerful sects, of course. The mid and high-grade artifacts didn’t slip past them. The low-grade ones went to wealthy cultivation families. Did you really think us rogue cultivators stood a chance?"  

"Fair point. Even if we somehow scraped together enough pills to bid, winning one would just bring trouble. It might even cost us our lives."  

The blunt truth dampened the mood. The crowd sighed, their enthusiasm waning. Even the man’s subsequent revelation—that the afternoon auction would feature even rarer treasures, including a top-grade spirit artifact used by the leader of the Lingyun Sect and several precious beast eggs—failed to stir much interest.  

Lin Xuan raised his cup, hiding a faint smile behind his tea. His luck was truly exceptional. While other Qi Refining cultivators considered low-grade spirit artifacts unattainable, he already possessed three—the weakest being mid-grade, and one even top-grade.  

However, fully unleashing their power required the Spirit Control Technique. This only strengthened his resolve to acquire a mid-tier cultivation method.  

Just as the atmosphere in the hall grew somber, a cold voice cut through:  

"Hmph, in the eyes of those sects and cultivation families, what are we rogue cultivators worth? Not only do we have no place in auctions, even the items in the trading session are rigged—reserved in advance through backdoor deals."  

"Rigged? Reserved in advance?" The cultivators were shocked. Lin Xuan also focused his attention, tracing the voice to an old man drinking alone in the corner.  

"Fellow Daoist, what do you mean by that?" Before Lin Xuan could ask, another curious cultivator spoke up.  

The old man took a sip of wine and didn’t mince words: "The Lingyun Sect brought five mid-tier cultivation methods. Apart from the most valuable *Jade Cloud Art*, which was auctioned, the other four were meant for the trading session."  

The crowd nodded—this was mentioned in the jade slip detailing the trading event.  

"But did you know? Three of those four mid-tier methods were already reserved by cultivation families in advance."  

"Advance reservations? Isn’t that against the rules?"  

"Rules?" The old man scoffed. "Everyone here has been in the cultivation world long enough. Since when have the strong ever followed rules? If you try to reason with sects and families, do they listen? They trample over us with sheer power."  

Silence fell. These rogue cultivators had all suffered under the oppression of sects and families. But what could they do? This was a world where strength dictated justice.  

Even if they resented the manipulation, they were powerless to change it.  

"Let them reserve what they want. It’s not like mid-tier cultivation methods are any use to us Qi Refining cultivators anyway."  

"Exactly. How many rogue cultivators even reach Foundation Establishment? Giving us mid-tier methods would be a waste."  

"Right, forget about it. Let’s just drink."
