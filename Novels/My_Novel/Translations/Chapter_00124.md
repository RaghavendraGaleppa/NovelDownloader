Chapter 124: Accumulating Water Forms an Abyss, Raising the Hair to Draw the Sword

In this world, "Essence Food" is precious, but formidable martial artists have their own ways of acquiring it. If one is willing to endure some hardship, hunting inferior or lowly demons for food ensures a plentiful supply of Essence Meat.

Only when starting the cauldron to boil water might there be some trouble.

However...

The treasure chest used to preserve Essence Food is incredibly valuable.

Once the Essence Meat is boiled, the essence of heaven and earth will gradually dissipate. If not consumed in time, it will eventually vanish completely. It requires a specially crafted mystical chest to seal it away for long-term preservation.

Li Xian took the mystical chest.

It was the size of a palm, yet heavy in his hand. The surface was carved with flowers and inlaid with jade, carrying a faint fragrance mixed with the lingering scent of the Madam.

One glance was enough to tell it was extraordinary. The Essence Meat inside was a gift from Zeng Taian of the Fulai Manor.

For some unknown reason, the Madam hadn't consumed a single bit. She had sealed it all in the mystical chest and now handed it all to Li Xian.

"Essence treasures are hard to come by in this world. For the Madam to be so generous, she must be in a very good mood."

"Indeed... she just had me make a move, a needless act of 'snatching food from the tiger's mouth.' I'm afraid the goal was to make me a target of resentment. Without her, I would be retaliated against in an instant."

The Madam was shrewd. Li Xian was also quite shrewd and quickly deduced the Madam's intentions. However, after putting away the "Storage Chest," he felt no anger or resentment.

The world is cruel. The Madam's decisions were all calculated based on her own situation, which was无可厚非.

Even for himself, if he puts in a bit of effort, doesn't he desire a bit of gain?

Li Xian drove the carriage, galloping between heaven and earth, his heart clear. He ignored the many complexities and focused on seizing the opportunities around him to strengthen himself.

It took several days to go.

It took several days to return.

The return journey was calm. They intentionally changed their route to avoid the Yellow Dragon Army. However, along the way, it seemed they discovered traces of the rebel army again.

But they didn't meet them head-on.

Night.

Li Xian and Madam Wen returned to the manor through the back door. After the long journey, the Madam was somewhat tired.

Stepping on the red jade carriage stool, she descended from the carriage.

"Li Xian, you have worked hard on this trip. Go to the accounting office tomorrow to collect a reward of ten taels."

Back in her own manor, Madam Wen said to Li Xian.

"Madam."

The servant girl Qiuyue approached and bowed respectfully.

Madam Wen nodded lightly, then said to Li Xian, "Did you gain anything from this trip?"

Li Xian said, "Under the Madam's guidance, I have seen many of the martial world's rules."

Madam Wen said, "Reading ten thousand books is also no substitute for traveling ten thousand miles. You have only seen the tip of the iceberg on this trip. Cultivate well. Once you enter the Food Essence stage, wash away your muddy form, and take on some presence, I will take you to see a broader world if there is a chance in the future."

The two walked one after the other, appearing quite close. On this trip there and back, Madam Wen had often observed Li Xian. In her eyes, Li Xian was now different from Pang Long, Qiuyue, and the others.

Qiuyue's expression turned ugly. She took a few quick steps to catch up and said, "Madam, you must be tired from the journey. Shall I massage your muscles and meridians for you?"

Madam Wen waved her hand and said, "No need." She turned to Li Xian and said, "When you were washing your form, pure energy overflowed. This is a sign of a rather good True Form. It was a bit of a surprise to me."

Li Xian nodded and said, "It is thanks to the Madam's cultivation that I am where I am today." Madam Wen raised her eyebrows slightly, thinking to herself, "That is natural."

Qiuyue then said, "Madam, what about your cultivation..." Madam Wen paused her steps. "Now that you mention it, I indeed should cultivate. I will do so after I finish refining the pills."

Qiuyue finally managed to interject, casting a triumphant glance at Li Xian.

How could Li Xian not know Qiuyue's thoughts? He had no interest in paying her any mind. But he couldn't help but think: "The matter of cultivation that Qiuyue mentioned, is it perhaps that..."

Madam Wen said, "I will rest for three days, then enter the tower to start the furnace and refine pills. I see that your Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword has made steady progress. The day after tomorrow, I will guide you once more. Once I start refining pills, I cannot be distracted. The affairs of the manor, big and small, will be temporarily left to you to handle. If anything unexpected happens, I will hold you accountable."

Back at his own residence.

"Commander Li, I heard you were favored by the Madam and accompanied her on a trip?"

The guards heard that Li Xian had returned and all came to his residence to greet him.

Everyone chattered away, full of envy. The Madam was high and above, so they didn't dare to gossip. But they couldn't help but speculate. The reason Li Xian could become a commander so early was, of course, because his strength wasn't weak...

But the bigger reason was probably his handsome appearance, which earned him the Madam's favor. And the Madam had indeed praised Li Xian's looks, a fact everyone knew.

"It's not really favor, I just went along to run some errands," Li Xian said, stretching his body, his bones crackling and popping.

It was already late.

Li Xian dismissed everyone, poured a bucket of cold water over himself, and began to practice martial arts with focus.

Traveling with the Madam could broaden his horizons and experience. But there were also many trivial matters, making his martial arts practice less than satisfying.

"The Madam also said that martial arts are the foundation of everything. Only with good martial arts can one be truly powerful!"

In a corner of the courtyard stood a wooden sculpture.

It was covered in circles and dots, all representing the acupoints on the human body. Li Xian stood over ten yards away, holding stones in his hand, and threw them at the wooden sculpture.

\[Your Stone-Throwing Acupoint Strike skill proficiency +2\]

Practicing the Cloud-Catching Hand.

Although this martial art was basic, it happened to make up for Li Xian's shortcomings. His Four Directions Fist and Breeze Wind Legs were both close-quarters martial arts. The Blue Wave Palm had a slightly longer range; by fully channeling his Internal Qi, he could strike from a yard away...

But it consumed a tremendous amount of Internal Qi. With Li Xian's Five-Yard Lake Body, he would exhaust his Qi after seven consecutive palms. If he pushed it to the limit, making the martial art manifest its anomaly and adding to its power, four palms would be his absolute limit.

Although he had archery for long-range attacks, no matter how exquisite your archery skills are, there is always the process of drawing the bow, nocking the arrow, and pulling the string. Plus, you are limited by the number of arrows.

The Cloud-Catching Hand is different.

With broken stones everywhere, any handy object can be picked up and used as a lethal weapon. Moreover, the skill of hitting acupoints with stones is unpredictable and extremely useful.

[Cloud-Catching Hand]

[Proficiency: 997/1000 Proficient]

After practicing for a full hour.

[Cloud-Catching Hand] broke through its shackles and successfully entered [Minor Accomplishment].

[Proficiency: 2/1500 Minor Accomplishment]

The Qi Lake grew by a tiny thread, better than nothing.

"The amount of Internal Qi often determines a martial artist's sustained combat ability. Even if physical strength is exhausted, with strong Internal Qi to support them, they can still deal with enemies."

"Therefore... no martial art is practiced in vain. Each one will make my Qi Lake grow. As the saying goes, constant dripping wears away the stone; accumulating water forms an abyss."

"Quantitative change will eventually lead to qualitative change. A hundred rivers merging into the sea is the same principle!"

Li Xian felt the growth of his Internal Qi.

His heart was calm and peaceful, filled with hope, down-to-earth, neither arrogant nor rash.

"As for that Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword... I think I don't need to deliberately hide it."

"This sword technique was passed down by the Madam. To be fair, the attainments in this sword art are the result of my own hard work. Why should I hide it? The Madam, at this moment... should have the intention of cultivating me."

"I should seize the opportunity to perform well and ask for more chances!"

Li Xian cultivated two methods simultaneously.

It went deep into the night.

He practiced until his sweat poured down like rain and his body was like a furnace. If it were the dead of winter, it would have been much more comfortable.

Fortunately, next to his residence was a wide lake.

When it got too hot to bear, he would simply vault over the courtyard wall and soak in the cool lake water. However, it was summer, and the shores of the lake at night were full of snakes, insects, frogs, and beasts.

Even with martial arts, one had to be careful.

Not to be bitten by a venomous snake.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

The proficiency of [Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword] had already accumulated to over [2368].

His body was like a furnace.

Today, the Mulberry Women returned to the manor to report the status of the mulberry gardens to the Madam. The manor was filled with the chatter of women, lively with their娇声阵阵.

Being a Mulberry Woman in the manor was a good job. They weren't servants, but hired laborers.

One Mulberry Woman could support a family of three, and every few days, they could eat a pot of meat.

The women passing by, seeing Li Xian with his flourishing Yang energy, all turned their heads, their faces blushing as they stole a few extra glances. Many women's eyes were filled with desire, thinking this commander was so young and handsome.

When a man's Yang energy is strong, it has an无形 attraction to the opposite sex.

If one viewed Li Xian as a porcelain vase.

The vase was filled to the brim with Yang energy, his heart beating rapidly, his blood surging quickly. His entire body seemed to possess the strength of an ox or a tiger, but in this process, his blood energy was gradually being consumed.

Even if he sealed his blood and closed his pores, it was difficult to completely slow down his blood and Qi.

If this continued, his hair would gradually turn white, and he would decay early. It was like a piece of charcoal burning fiercely, shining brilliantly with light and heat as it burned.

But after it faded, it returned to dust, scattered by the wind, a thing to sigh over.

Li Xian hid in the shade, not daring to be exposed to the sun at all. He waited until all the Mulberry Women had left, and it was evening again.

Then he entered the inner courtyard to find the Madam.

"Why are you so late?"

The Madam's tone carried a hint of accusation. Today, her long hair was let down, adding to her beauty and charm, reducing her dignified air and adding a touch of languidness.

Madam Wen was a person who cared greatly about her appearance. Or rather, there is no beauty in the world who does not cherish her own feathers.

She said that Zeng Taian neglected his martial arts because he was busy raising birds, which was not good. But when she dressed up her own appearance, she was exactly the same.

The reason why the Mulberry Women were valued was twofold. First: sericulture was the pillar industry of the manor, bringing in considerable profits. Second: any superior silkworm silk would first be enjoyed by the Madam.

Woven into superior silk garments...

The manor had many trades, including farming, mulberry, horses, firewood, and more. Some trades even extended to the government city.

The most profitable and largest of these were the "mulberry," "alcohol," and "cosmetics" industries.

Li Xian found an excuse to prevaricate. After exchanging a couple more sentences, the Madam got straight to the point.

"Have you had any mishaps in your martial arts practice recently?" Madam Wen asked.

Li Xian pretended to be ashamed and said, "Reporting to the Madam, after your last guidance, my sword art has indeed improved a lot. But... as I practice, I can't help but feel my body grow hot again. I can't figure out the reason. Could it be... that my talent is too poor?"

"Every time I think of this, I feel deeply ashamed and feel that I have failed the Madam's cultivation."

Madam Wen thought to herself: "If you didn't feel your body grow hot, then you would truly be failing my cultivation." Her beautiful eyes swept over him, and she couldn't help but show a hint of surprise: "This boy, without any guidance, practicing a superior martial art, has still made steady progress. It's truly surprising to me."

"If it were another martial art, I wouldn't mind guiding him. But this Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, I have cultivated the Yin chapter, but I cannot cultivate the Yang chapter. I know very little about the Yang chapter. And men and women are different, so the cultivation of this method is also different. My guidance... might not necessarily be correct."

"He can make progress one day, and I will watch him one day. Let's see how far he can get and what his comprehension is like."

This superior martial art was created by the Yin-Yang Immortals. Once you start, it's hard to stop. Because the sun and moon alternate, yin and yin rotate, and it must be harmonized at all times.

Madam Wen once forcibly practiced the Yin chapter of the sword, relying on her talent and comprehension to reach the third level. Because of this, she suffered a great loss, her body injured by the cold Yin energy, which she barely managed to suppress.

But she always coveted this sword art in her heart.

"You, you blockhead, are truly不开窍."

"Very well, since that's the case, I will guide you once more."

Madam Wen tied up her beautiful hair with a silver hairpin. With a flick of her toe, a long sword flew into Li Xian's hand.
