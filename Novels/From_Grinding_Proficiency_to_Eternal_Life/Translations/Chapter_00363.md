Chapter 363: We Are Merely Nourishment

A hand pressed against the ground, and a figure slowly crawled out from the gore and flesh.

It was a naked man, his face handsome to the point of being demonic, with a vertical purple mark between his eyebrows that resembled a closed third eye.

He stretched his body, and his bones crackled with sharp sounds, as if he hadn't moved for a thousand years.

"Such a long time..."

The man took a deep breath, a look of enjoyment on his face, and spoke slowly. His voice sounded like the grinding of metal, carrying an ancient and decayed aura.

"I have finally found the opportunity to awaken. Although the spiritual energy of this world is pitifully thin and filled with impurities, I have... finally returned to life."

He looked at Xu Yunfan, a strange smile curling at the corner of his mouth. "I must thank you."

The purple mark flickered slightly, revealing a dangerous light. "If not for your hammer shattering that Purple Gold Pill, I would have had to sleep for another hundred years."

Dugu Jiu's pupils contracted sharply, and his right hand already rested on the hight of his sword.

He could feel the aura emanating from the other party. It was not a fluctuation that a human should possess; it seemed to be a more ancient and more evil existence.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly, and a faint, hair-thin red line between his eyebrows flashed with an imperceptible luster.

The red line between his eyebrows circulated silently, the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye opened without a sound, and a blood-colored vertical pupil flowed beneath his skin.

The Heavenly Eye saw through everything like a fire, instantly capturing the opponent's aura.

In an instant, the aura of the Heavenly Demon before him was fully revealed. The thousand years of resentment entangled in the purple mark, the incomplete energy circulating within his body, and even the fluctuation trajectory of every strand of aura turned into thousands of threads, weaving into a net within Xu Yunfan's Sea of Consciousness.

"So that's how it is."

A faint smile hung on Xu Yunfan's lips.

Reflected by the Heavenly Eye, although this Heavenly Demon seemed to have a terrifying aura, his strength was actually less than one-tenth of its peak. The backlash generated when the Purple Gold Pill he had transformed into was destroyed had already eroded his origin, leaving it full of holes.

Right now, he was merely putting on a brave front, attempting to use the residual Dragon Qi of the Imperial Court to repair his injured body.

"Extraordinary Heavenly Demon?"

I can beat him!

And it would be a crushing victory.

Xu Yunfan's heart settled, his gaze focused, and his tone was calm as if he were judging the morning dew. "Extraordinary Heavenly Demon?"

The man raised his eyebrows slightly and suddenly let out a series of low laughs. The charred flesh all over his body rustled and fell off.

He walked out of the ruins, his bare feet stepping on the cracks at the edge of the arena, and strange purple light circulated between his muscles.

"Judging by the perspective of your world..."

He casually wiped away the residual blood on his shoulder, a playful arc at the corner of his mouth. "You can indeed call me a Heavenly Demon."

His gaze swept over Xu Yunfan's bones like a knife edge, and a satisfied sigh escaped his throat. "This physical body... if refined into a battle puppet, it would surely give this Lord an unexpected surprise."

Before his words had finished, the bluestone of the arena silently turned to dust beneath his feet.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly.

"You are from the Primordial Origin Sect?"

A trace of surprise flashed in the man's eyes, and then his smile widened. "Interesting. A native of this world actually recognizes this Lord's origin."

He raised his chin slightly. "Not bad, this Lord is 'You Quan,' from the Taihua Spirit Void Realm. Now that the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth has recovered..."

Before he could finish, his expression suddenly changed drastically, and the spiritual energy around him surged like boiling water. "The spiritual energy of this world... was actually born from a blood sacrifice? No wonder it carries such a heavy aura of blood and resentment."

You Quan's eyes flashed with bloodlight, and his knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists. "Such a waste!"

His voice was tinged with anger like poisoned fire. "Such a crude blood sacrifice, not even knowing how to extract souls and refine spirits, and you dare to disturb the earth's veins?"

As he spoke, You Quan's slender fingers suddenly plunged into the ground, grabbing several struggling souls visible to the naked eye.

This scene made Xu Yunfan's pupils contract sharply, his gaze deep.

Dugu Jiu beside him, seeing this scene, gripped the hilt of his sword so hard his knuckles turned white.

Such a bizarre scene shook his mind.

"It's a pity. If this Lord had arranged the formation..."

He crushed the soul and let out a satisfied sigh. "I would have taken ten thousand young boys and girls, extracted their living souls as the guide, peeled their flesh and blood as the medium, let their wails last for forty-nine days, and drawn upon their resentment and evil aura. Not only could I refine a magic artifact, but I would also have made the earth's veins' spiritual energy sweet and mellow."

Seeing the look of dissatisfaction on You Quan's face, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but speak.

"You seem to feel that it is not the right time for you to awaken?"

"Not the right time?"

You Quan slowly raised his head, a cold light flashing in his eyes, and a mocking curve appeared at the corner of his mouth. "A mere native of the lower world, like an ant, how could you know the plans of my Primordial Origin Sect? Since the spiritual energy of this world has recovered, my sect will naturally send disciples to descend and reap the fortune of this season."

Xu Yunfan suddenly laughed, suddenly remembering what Bi Yuan had told him before: when these Extraordinary Heavenly Demons descended, the supreme grandmasters who had stepped into the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining were nearly wiped out.

It turned out they were harvested by the so-called upper world sects.

Such behavior is no different from the demonic path.

The laugh was very light, but it made You Quan's words come to an abrupt halt.

He frowned, a hint of displeasure showing in his purple eyes.

"What are you laughing at?"

Xu Yunfan said softly, "I really want to know what your strength is like? What level are you at, what realm, and how are you different from us 'lower world ants'?"

You Quan's face broke into a smile upon hearing this.

"A bit interesting. You are quite good, very much to my taste. When I take you out of the Divine Martial Realm, I will definitely reshape your body when I refine you, turn you into a female form, and enjoy you."

Xu Yunfan felt a wave of revulsion. You Quan's words were truly disgusting to him.

Dugu Jiu beside him felt a suffocating pressure.

The pressure inadvertently emanating from You Quan made the true energy in his body run sluggish, and the long sword in its sheath emitted an uneasy hum.

He looked at Xu Yunfan, but found that the other party's expression remained normal.

The quality of the true energy in the other party's body seemed to be a level higher than theirs.

"Xu boy..." Dugu Jiu whispered, "This fiend is no small matter. You must be careful in everything and not act on impulse easily."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, but his eyes remained fixed on You Quan with a hint of amusement. "What you said is quite disgusting. It disgusts me so much that I can't wait to beat you to death."

"Beat me to death?"

You Quan said with a hint of surprise, "Do you know what you are saying? The martial arts of this world were passed down by my Primordial Origin Sect. The true energy you cultivate is merely nourishment for us."

Speaking of this, he smiled. "I've never heard a piece of food say it wants to beat me to death."

Xu Yunfan suddenly spoke, "But do you know what a Land Immortal is?"

You Quan was stunned, then sneered. "Land Immortal? It's just an empty title that you lower world martial artists have given yourselves. The aura in your body is enough for me to cross a realm. It was not in vain that I used a secret method to lurk in this world for nearly a thousand years."

A purple-black evil aura suddenly burst from his palm, then rapidly swelled, transforming into a purple-black giant snake that coiled around him.

"This Lord has killed some when I first descended to the lower world."

Xu Yunfan sighed and shook his head. "It seems you truly do not know."
