# Chapter 21: Temporary Alliance

Seeing this, Chen Xianhe also grew tense.

The tiger-striped fish carcass was only about ten feet long—for a first-rank demonic beast of this size, devouring it would take mere minutes.

He had originally thought this trip would just involve cheering the Zhou family from the sidelines, never expecting to encounter such danger.

With this in mind, Chen Xianhe instructed, "That beast likely can't fly. If we're no match for it later, abandon ship immediately!"

At this point, Chen Daoxuan wouldn't act recklessly either. After all, his cultivation had only just reached the third layer of Qi Refinement.

Even though he had experienced three epiphanies on the way to Guang'an Prefecture, elevating his Gale Chasing Sword Art to a level beyond perfection, it still wouldn't be enough to deal with such a massive demonic beast.

Unless...

He was willing to use his trump card—the Snowdrift Sword.

But wielding the Snowdrift Sword consumed too much spiritual energy. If he failed to kill the beast in one strike and exhausted his energy, he might lose even the ability to escape—a truly tragic outcome.

As he hesitated, a familiar voice reached Chen Daoxuan and the others.

"Everyone, this is a late-stage first-rank Blood-Spotted Sea Serpent, equivalent to a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. If we don't stop it soon, given its destructive power, all the ships in this area will likely be destroyed in no time!"

As the voice spoke, a black-robed elder floated mid-air.

Chen Daoxuan immediately recognized him—this was the same elder who had sold him the Water Spirit Pearl at the rogue cultivators' market.

What a coincidence that his cargo ship happened to be nearby as well.

After hearing the elder's explanation, everyone realized that the only way to protect their ships was to slay this Blood-Spotted Sea Serpent.

Soon, the seven Qi Refinement cultivators in the vicinity, including the black-robed elder, reached a consensus—they would join forces to kill the beast.

However, among these seven, only the black-robed elder had reached the ninth layer of Qi Refinement. The next strongest was Chen Xianhe at the sixth layer—barely mid-stage Qi Refinement.

With such a hastily assembled team, whether they could actually kill the beast remained uncertain.

But for the sake of their cargo ships—their lifelines—these dirt-poor rogue cultivators had no other choice.

Glancing at the group, the black-robed elder seemed to recognize Chen Daoxuan and gave him a slight nod before laying out their battle plan.

"Everyone, the Blood-Spotted Sea Serpent isn't just massive—it's also a common venomous sea snake. When we attack, make sure to take an antidote pill beforehand."

Hearing this, a cultivator at only the second layer of Qi Refinement flushed with embarrassment. "Elder... I... I don't have any antidote pills."

The black-robed elder retrieved a jade vial and flicked a translucent green pill to the cultivator. "Take this."

"Thank you, Elder!"

The elder nodded. "Anyone else without antidote pills?"

"Me! I don't have any!"

"And me!"

One after another, the others spoke up.

In the end, aside from Chen Daoxuan and his uncle, none of the temporary team had brought antidote pills.

Of course, it wasn't necessarily that everyone lacked them—some might have just been trying to take advantage of the elder's generosity.

The elder understood this but had no choice. To protect his valuable cargo ship, he had to pay this price. Alone, he stood little chance against the serpent.

After a pause, the elder continued, "Later, I'll use my full strength to cast Frost Binding, which should restrain the beast for at least three breaths. Use that window to attack together—understood?"

With someone willing to take the lead, no one objected, and all nodded in agreement.

Once the plan was set, the elder wasted no time and immediately cast Frost Binding.

As the spell took effect, a massive ice vine nearly three hundred feet long shot from his hands, freezing the Blood-Spotted Sea Serpent mid-meal.

The spell's power was astonishing—not only did it immobilize the beast, but it also froze the surrounding seawater solid.

"Now!" the elder barked, his face flushed with exertion.

Before he even finished speaking, Chen Daoxuan was already in motion, summoning his Crimson Shadow Flying Sword and slashing at the frozen serpent.

Enhanced by his perfected Gale Chasing Sword Art, the sword's edge gleamed with terrifying sharpness, drawing a surprised glance from Chen Xianhe.

"That's... the perfected Gale Chasing Sword Art?!"

Chen Xianhe was stunned.

In fact, Chen Daoxuan's mastery of the technique seemed even greater than his own. But... how was that possible?

He clearly remembered his nephew had only obtained the Gale Chasing Sword Art manual from him right before their trip to Guang'an Prefecture. At most, Chen Daoxuan had practiced it for a month.

In just one month, he had perfected it—and not just barely, but to an extraordinary degree?

Impossible!

That was the only thought in Chen Xianhe's mind. Distracted, his own sword strike slowed slightly.

The others, unaware of his shock, threw everything they had at the serpent.

For a moment, the air was filled with flashing sword lights, flying fireballs, and crackling lightning—a dazzling spectacle.

In reality, however, only a handful—Chen Daoxuan, Chen Xianhe, and a few others—could inflict any real damage on the late-stage first-rank Blood-Spotted Sea Serpent.

The rest, due to their low cultivation and poor-quality magical tools, barely scratched it.

The most pitiful was the second-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. His spellwork was crude, and his "magical tool" was a roughly forged iron flying sword.

When Chen Daoxuan saw it, he nearly gaped in disbelief.

He had always thought the idea of rogue cultivators using crude iron as weapons was a joke—yet here was someone actually doing it.

When the sword struck the serpent's scales, it didn't even break the skin, instead sparking uselessly against them—a sight that left everyone speechless.

Watching this, the black-robed elder grew frantic.

He inwardly cursed the group as useless but had no better options. He had to keep channeling spiritual energy into the Frost Binding spell to restrain the beast.

If the serpent broke free, even if the cultivators could escape by flying, their ships would surely be destroyed—an outcome the elder couldn't accept.

*Crack! Crack!*

Perhaps distracted by the battle, the elder's energy flow faltered slightly.

The ice encasing the serpent began to fracture.

"Look out! It's breaking free! Go all out, or we lose our ships!"

No sooner had he spoken than the ice around the serpent's tail shattered.

A massive, cylindrical shadow burst from the frozen sea, its tail bearing blood-red spots the size of human heads.

*BOOM!*

The tail smashed into a cargo ship beside the Canglong, splitting it clean in half.

Wooden debris and broken bodies littered the water.

"No! My ship! Die, you monster! DIE!"

One of the cultivators, driven mad with rage, hurled his flying sword at the serpent in a frenzy.

But with only third-layer Qi Refinement and a weak weapon, his fury did little damage.

Witnessing this, Chen Daoxuan's expression darkened.

Chen Xianhe, meanwhile, was already considering retreat. To him, the Canglong was important, but not worth risking Chen Daoxuan's life.

If anything happened to his nephew, it would devastate the Chen family of Twin Lakes Island.

Catching Chen Xianhe's meaningful glance urging him to fall back, Chen Daoxuan understood.

But without the Canglong, not only would they suffer heavy financial losses, but returning home would become far more difficult.

After a brief internal struggle, Chen Daoxuan's gaze hardened. "Uncle, I want to try!"
