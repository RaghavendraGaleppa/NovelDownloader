# Chapter 50: Divine Sense Projection  

The night passed without incident.  

Chu Ning slept even more soundly than usual and woke up feeling refreshed, which surprised him slightly. Glancing outside, he noticed he had risen earlier than normal.  

Unconcerned, he sat cross-legged on his bed and began practicing his Divine Refinement Technique. His morning routine was the reverse of his evening one—first the Divine Refinement Technique, then the Evergreen Wood Longevity Art, and finally the Ninefold Body Refinement Method before breakfast and heading to the fields.  

But this time, as he practiced the Divine Refinement Technique, he noticed something unusual. The whirlpool of divine sense in his Muddy Pellet Palace was spinning faster than usual. Though unsure of the reason, he recognized this as a sign of accelerated progress. Suppressing his surprise, he focused intently on his cultivation.  

The whirlpool spun faster and faster, shrinking as it did so.  

After what felt like an eternity, a faint *drip* echoed in his mind.  

The gaseous whirlpool in his Muddy Pellet Palace had vanished, replaced by a single drop of liquid.  

**Divine Sense Condensation—Divine Refinement Initiation!**  

After persistent training, Chu Ning had finally achieved a breakthrough in the Divine Refinement Technique.  

In an instant, his perception sharpened. He could sense the purple flowers on the Ironvine swaying gently in the breeze in the front and back courtyards. He could even detect the breathing of Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang in the neighboring rooms.  

**Divine Sense Projection—a hallmark of successful initiation into Divine Refinement.**  

Exiting his meditative state, Chu Ning immediately checked his proficiency levels:  

- **[Evergreen Wood Longevity Art (Yellow Grade, Low Tier), Second Layer (275/900)]**  
- **[Ninefold Body Refinement Method, First Volume, Unyielding Bone (51/600)]**  
- **[Divine Refinement Technique, First Layer (11/1000)]**  

"So crossing the threshold of 10 proficiency means initiation," Chu Ning mused.  

Then, he grimaced. If reaching initiation was this difficult at just 10 proficiency, reaching the First Layer's completion at 1000 would be an arduous journey.  

**A long road lay ahead.**  

He then pondered the range of his divine sense projection—about two zhang (≈6.5 feet). Did that mean completing the First Layer would only extend it to four zhang?  

At first, this seemed underwhelming. But then he shook his head.  

**No.**  

The Divine Refinement Technique stated that completing the First Layer would **double** one's divine sense. However, the technique itself also strengthened divine sense during cultivation. Thus, the actual projection range upon completion would far exceed double the current range.  

Otherwise, how could one execute divine sense attacks like the **Phantom Soul Spike**?  

The true effect of completing the First Layer depended on how much his divine sense expanded during this period.  

This realization filled Chu Ning with anticipation—after all, his innate divine sense was nearly twice as strong as an average cultivator's. According to the manual, this meant his results would be even more pronounced.  

Rising from the bed, he prepared to practice the Ninefold Body Refinement Method in the courtyard.  

But as he took his first step, he froze.  

A thought struck him—**why were Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang sleeping in separate rooms?**  

Were they an estranged middle-aged couple? Or did they avoid disturbing each other's cultivation? But they hadn't been cultivating—they were asleep.  

**Or perhaps they weren't truly a couple at all?**  

The thought flickered through his mind, and his expression darkened. Though he might be overthinking, his vigilance heightened.  

Abandoning his original plan, he ate breakfast and decided to cultivate at the spirit fields instead. While the mid-grade fields bordered the couple's plot, the high-grade field where he grew Dark Bamboo was isolated—perfect for undisturbed training.  

To his surprise, as he stepped out, Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang emerged simultaneously.  

Lu Yunfang greeted him warmly.  

"Junior Brother Chu, you're up early too! Heading to the fields?"  

Maintaining his usual reserved demeanor, Chu Ning nodded.  

Lu Yunfang smiled and produced a porcelain jar from her storage pouch.  

"We were planning to visit you at noon. Here’s some spirit tea we brought from our clan—a small gift for you."  

Chu Ning hesitated. This was the first time since joining the sect that someone had treated him with such courtesy, as if he were still in the mortal world.  

**But the more polite they were, the warier he became.**  

He was only at the third level of Qi Refining, while they were at the sixth. Why would they go out of their way to befriend him?  

Still, outright rejection would seem unnatural for a junior disciple.  

"This spirit tea must be valuable," he said cautiously. "I’m just a rough fellow—might not appreciate it properly."  

"Oh, it’s nothing special," Lu Yunfang waved off. "Just ordinary-grade, about the same price as spirit rice."  

Before he could refuse, she pressed the jar into his hands.  

"Actually, I wanted to ask you something."  

Chu Ning’s heart skipped a beat. He had a feeling she would bring up **Qi Chongmao**.  

"Thank you, Senior Sister Lu," he said carefully. "But I’m a new disciple—I might not know much."  

"It’s a small matter," Lu Yunfang lowered her voice conspiratorially. "I heard this courtyard was occupied not long ago? And that person... disappeared suddenly?"  

**Bingo.**  

Chu Ning nodded. "Yes, a Senior Brother named Qi Chongmao lived here. He vanished about a month ago. Oh, and—"  

He paused, studying their expressions.  

"A Foundation Establishment elder from the Law Enforcement Hall even came to investigate."  

As he spoke, his heart sank.  

When he mentioned the Law Enforcement Hall, their faces twitched—almost imperceptibly, but his heightened divine sense caught it.  

Still, they masked it well. Lu Yunfang leaned in with even greater curiosity.  

"Did the Law Enforcement Hall find anything?"  

Chu Ning shook his head sheepishly.  

"I wouldn’t know. When that elder was here, I didn’t dare breathe too loudly, let alone ask questions."  

Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang exchanged glances.  

"Well, if the Law Enforcement Hall was involved, it’s probably fine," Lu Yunfang said lightly. "We were just worried the previous tenant might suddenly return mid-harvest."  

Chu Ning didn’t respond, turning to leave.  

Lu Yunfang gestured to the jar in his hands.  

"Junior Brother Chu, carrying this around might be inconvenient. Would you like to store it in your pouch or return it to your room?"  

Chu Ning had no intention of revealing his storage pouch in front of them.  

"I don’t have a storage pouch yet. I’ll just put it inside."  

"Alright, we’ll head to the fields first then," Lu Yunfang said, departing with Luo Hongping.  

Once back inside, Chu Ning closed the door—and immediately projected his divine sense outward.  

His expression darkened further.  

The couple hadn’t gone far—and were now communicating via **Sound Transmission**.  

Though his divine sense wasn’t strong enough to eavesdrop, the fact that they resorted to such secrecy, even around a low-level disciple like him, was alarming.  

**They were definitely here because of Qi Chongmao.**  

And they were clearly wary of the Law Enforcement Hall’s investigation.  

Though the full picture eluded him, Chu Ning sensed that his killing of Qi Chongmao had entangled him in something far more troublesome than he’d imagined.
