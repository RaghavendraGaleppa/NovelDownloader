# Chapter 101: Harvest  

The Dragon-Sealing Phoenix-Locking Array Disk—a formation disk with an extremely exaggerated name—contained the Dragon-Sealing Phoenix-Locking Formation, crafted by a grandmaster of formations.  

This was a completely custom-made formation, designed and created to be one-of-a-kind according to the client's requirements. The price for such a custom formation was exorbitantly high.  

Only cultivators of sufficiently high status could afford custom formations. Ordinary cultivators wouldn't even be entertained by formation grandmasters, even if they had the spirit stones to pay.  

Compared to standard formations, custom formations were far more difficult to crack, especially by fellow formation masters.  

Li Shiming bound the Dragon-Sealing Phoenix-Locking Array Disk to himself but did not deactivate the formation.  

The array disk provided both defense and isolation simultaneously, and its effectiveness far exceeded his expectations.  

The energy source within the array disk was a type of spirit stone he had never seen before—more translucent and containing higher-grade spiritual energy.  

Unfortunately, due to the two consecutive explosions earlier, the three spirit stones serving as the energy source were nearly depleted.  

"Could these be mid-grade spirit stones?" Recalling the records in the knowledge available to Qi Refinement cultivators, he guessed the identity of these spirit stones.  

Theoretically, Qi Refinement cultivators shouldn't have access to mid-grade spirit stones, as these were typically circulated only among Foundation Establishment cultivators. Qi Refinement cultivators rarely even got a glimpse of them.  

No wonder the formation, powered by mid-grade spirit stones, could withstand the simultaneous explosions of the "white phosphorus bomb" and the "thermite bomb."  

Of course, it was precisely because the Dragon-Sealing Phoenix-Locking Array Disk had blocked the explosions that all the explosive force was repeatedly directed at Baili Jinyan, leading to his death.  

Otherwise, given the life-saving treasures Baili Jinyan possessed, there was no way he would have perished here.  

Thinking of Baili Jinyan, Li Shiming turned to look at the corpse on the ground.  

The corpse was completely naked, stripped of all clothing. The only item remaining was a bracelet on its wrist—nothing else was left.  

"Could the storage pouch have been destroyed in the explosion?" Li Shiming muttered in frustration when he didn't see a storage pouch.  

He could imagine how wealthy Baili Jinyan must have been. Just the two magical instruments he had used to torture Li Shiming—one mid-grade and one high-grade—were proof of that.  

Li Shiming's high-grade magical instrument, the Azure Kite Wooden Sword, had only been obtained through an unexpected inheritance.  

Yet Baili Jinyan had casually pulled out two such instruments just to torment him.  

He couldn't be blamed for his lack of exposure. Since entering the world of cultivation, he had first witnessed the hardships of rogue cultivators. After joining the sect, apart from Yin Shilan, none of the cultivators he knew were particularly wealthy.  

He inwardly grumbled about how fragile storage pouches were—hadn't previous explosions left them intact?  

As he thought this, he casually removed the bracelet from Baili Jinyan's wrist.  

The bracelet was the only item that had survived the explosion, so it must have been a high-quality magical instrument.  

When Li Shiming channeled spiritual energy into the bracelet, he suddenly sensed an enormous space—30 meters in length, width, and height.  

It finally dawned on him why he hadn't found a storage pouch: Baili Jinyan didn't have one. Instead, he used a storage bracelet—a far more advanced item.  

Storage bracelets shouldn't even appear among Qi Refinement cultivators. Even most Foundation Establishment cultivators used storage pouches, albeit with slightly larger internal spaces than ordinary ones.  

But no matter how large a storage pouch's space was, it couldn't compare to the bracelet's capacity due to inherent limitations.  

This storage bracelet exceeded Li Shiming's imagination—its space was even larger than his machine room dimension.  

Li Shiming's expression darkened. He didn't even bother inspecting the bracelet's contents in detail, only noticing piles of spirit stones and, most prominently, a small flying boat.  

Seeing the flying boat, he realized that flying boats could be shrunk before being stored in spatial items.  

It made sense—not all cultivators had such exaggerated storage spaces. Flying boats had to be designed to fit into storage pouches, or else they couldn't be carried around.  

Of course, there were also flying boats that couldn't be shrunk—these were medium or large-sized boats, typically used communally within sects.  

Li Shiming first retrieved his identity jade token, then attempted to store the bracelet in his machine room dimension. If the machine room were an ordinary storage space, the bracelet wouldn't be able to enter due to spatial overlap.  

Fortunately, the machine room dimension was unique, and the bracelet was easily stored inside.  

He let out a long sigh of relief. The bracelet, along with all its contents—including the Binding Spirit Rope and Soul-Piercing Needle—would have to remain in the machine room dimension for a long time.  

Who knew if the bracelet or any of the spiritual items inside carried tracking marks left by Baili Jinyan's faction?  

He had no desire to be hunted down by a terrifying faction capable of providing a storage bracelet. If discovered, even the Tianhai Sect might not be able to protect him.  

The Tianhai Sect wouldn't go to war with a powerful faction for the sake of an ordinary Qi Refinement disciple. At best, they might put on a show of resistance, but with a few underhanded maneuvers, they could easily sacrifice him.  

In his past life, he had seen countless examples—in movies, TV shows, and real life—of people being betrayed for the sake of sufficient profit.  

Li Shiming turned his gaze back to Baili Jinyan's corpse, recalling the torture he had endured.  

Even though part of his consciousness had been anchored in the machine room dimension, the memory of the soul-rending pain still triggered a physical and mental stress response.  

He had never offended Baili Jinyan. The man had simply wanted to kill him to win Yin Shilan's favor.  

For someone who had tried to kill him, even if he had already exacted revenge, Li Shiming's anger wasn't fully vented.  

"Since you wanted me dead, it's only fair that I turn your corpse into my lifebound corpse puppet!" Li Shiming said coldly.  

Baili Jinyan had personally told him that his spiritual root was a single-element metal root—the most suitable for refining corpse puppets.  

Among body-refining techniques, at least half were metal-attribute techniques, as metal roots were more compatible with body refinement.  

A single-element metal root, a metal-attribute physique, a body-refining practitioner, and a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivation—everything about Baili Jinyan's corpse was perfect for a lifebound corpse puppet.  

More importantly, Baili Jinyan had just died, and Li Shiming happened to have all the materials needed for refining a lifebound corpse puppet on hand.  

Almost every well-prepared Profound Nether Sect disciple carried a set of materials for refining lifebound corpse puppets. This ensured they wouldn't miss an opportunity if they encountered suitable corpse material.  

Although Baili Jinyan's corpse had some damage, Li Shiming confirmed that the injuries weren't severe.  

The internal impact wounds would heal automatically during the refinement process.  

Of course, refining a lifebound corpse puppet was extremely difficult, with a high failure rate.  

But Li Shiming didn't care. If he succeeded, it would be good luck. If he failed, he'd treat it as practice.  

He took out a large pouch of liquid—a concoction made from lifebound corpse fluid and various other materials, used to transform the corpse.  

He considered using the Blazing Flame Sword to cut his arm and draw blood, but then realized the sword was gone.  

Right—Baili Jinyan had confiscated it earlier. He hesitated but decided against retrieving it from the storage bracelet. Whatever was inside the bracelet, he wouldn't be taking anything out anytime soon.  

Instead, he took out the Azure Kite Wooden Sword. Though small and toy-like, when infused with spiritual energy, its sharpness far surpassed that of the Blazing Flame Sword.  

The wooden sword sliced his arm, drawing blood.  

Using a spiritual hand conjured through Telekinesis, he collected the blood and mixed it thoroughly with the transformation fluid.  

The fluid, now infused with his spiritual blood, would ensure the corpse puppet naturally became his once the transformation was complete.  

He carefully applied the fluid to Baili Jinyan's corpse. To ordinary people, this fluid was highly toxic.  

The main ingredient—lifebound corpse fluid—meant that only sects specializing in corpse refinement and possessing proper lineages could produce it.  

The entire pouch of fluid was just enough to coat Baili Jinyan's body.  

Now, all that was left was to wait for the corpse to transform into a puppet. Most failures in refining lifebound corpse puppets occurred at this stage.  

Li Shiming didn't want to stay and wait. He was also worried that Baili Jinyan's corpse might be tracked. Until the transformation was complete, the corpse couldn't be exposed.  

Once transformed, the puppet would be a different entity altogether—a necrotic being, distinct from a corpse.  

The safest place to store the corpse was still the machine room dimension.  

He placed Baili Jinyan's corpse inside, then collected the Dragon-Sealing Phoenix-Locking Array Disk as well.  

After storing the array disk, he glanced at the cave dwelling, realizing it couldn't be left intact either.  

He took out ten kilograms of nitroglycerin, set up a timed detonator, and left the cave.  

By the time Li Shiming was hundreds of meters away from the uninhabited island, a massive explosion erupted behind him. The island collapsed—not just the cave, but even the rocky outcrop was reduced to rubble.  

After the explosion, the island no longer had any elevated terrain.  

The sky darkened as the seasonal heavy rain arrived.  

The downpour washed away all traces. After this rain, even high-level tracking talismans wouldn't be able to accurately trace Baili Jinyan's movements.  

Li Shiming rode his paper crane, using the IBMz15 to identify ocean currents and find his way back.  

Unlike sect disciples, he didn't have directional tools. As a newly advanced mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator—unnoticed by the sect—and a spirit farmer, the sect wouldn't assign him external missions like ordinary disciples.  

Without missions, he lacked the sect-provided navigation tools and maps for sea travel.  

But ocean currents were sometimes more reliable than maps. Following the current, he flew for five hours before finally returning to Eagle Beak Island at nightfall.  

Baili Jinyan had taken only thirty-one minutes and sixteen seconds to bring him here. The speed difference was staggering.  

"Finally back!" Li Shiming muttered with lingering fear as his feet touched the island.  

If not for his tricks, he might never have seen Eagle Beak Island again.  

He also realized how unsafe defensive formations were—someone had easily infiltrated his.  

But with only low-grade formation materials on hand, strengthening the formation was impossible. At most, he could set up a few small alarm formations.  

Additionally, he needed to install surveillance cameras. He had been too trusting of the defensive formation.  

Entering his cave dwelling, he descended to the underground space. Still uneasy, he summoned the bronze corpse.  

He was mentally exhausted. The Soul-Piercing Needle had attacked his soul, and though its primary effect was inducing extreme pain, his soul had still suffered damage.  

His body was also at its limit—restrained, tortured, escaped, then flown for five hours straight.  

Li Shiming collapsed beside the spirit spring and fell into a deep sleep.  

As he slept, violent changes were occurring inside the machine room dimension.  

Baili Jinyan's corpse was convulsing violently. Had Li Shiming been awake, he would have realized something was wrong.  

Corpses didn't convulse—only living bodies reacted to stimuli like this.  

Baili Jinyan was indeed alive, but in a peculiar state.  

His father had prepared multiple life-saving measures for him. The last one was a third-grade treasure—something beyond the Foundation Establishment level.  

When Baili Jinyan suffered fatal injuries, the assumption was that the enemy was too powerful for him to handle.  

If escape had been possible, the previous life-saving measure would have succeeded.  

Alternatively, if the previous measure had been exhausted and Baili Jinyan's injuries were too severe, the third-grade treasure would activate.  

This treasure, combined with a special technique, placed Baili Jinyan in a death-like state when he suffered fatal damage.  

In this state, all signs of life vanished, indistinguishable from true death. Only the third-grade treasure preserved a sliver of vitality, preventing his body and brain from deteriorating.  

To make the death state more convincing, Baili Jinyan had severed all connections to his magical instruments the moment he entered this state.  

Even experienced cultivators would believe he was truly dead upon seeing this.  

Li Shiming, with the IBMz15's observations, hadn't detected any anomalies—proof of how convincing Baili Jinyan's death-like state was.  

It was rare for cultivators to destroy corpses after killing enemies. Most would just take the spoils.  

Baili Jinyan's abundant loot had distracted Li Shiming, preventing him from paying too much attention to the corpse.
