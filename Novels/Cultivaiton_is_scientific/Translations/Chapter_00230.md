# Chapter 230: Alchemy (Bonus for Reader 171021102948988)

Upon returning to the Shushan Sect, Li Shiming immediately noticed a significant decrease in the number of cultivators within the sect. 

Though the Shushan Sect occupied an enormous territory, it was usually bustling with cultivators—so much so that the skies were often crowded with them during the day. But now, their numbers had visibly dwindled by more than half. 

He took out his identity jade slip but found no messages. Changing direction, he flew toward a square-topped mountain peak—Square Peak, where Xu Chuan's cave residence was located. 

After sending out a spell and waiting briefly, the formation barrier opened, allowing him entry. Before he could even land, Xu Chuan had already come out to greet him. 

"Junior Brother, I heard you went out for a while. What brings you here today?" Xu Chuan asked with a smile as he approached. 

"Senior Brother, I just returned and noticed many cultivators are missing. I wanted to ask what's going on," Li Shiming replied straightforwardly. 

"You didn't receive the news?" Xu Chuan was momentarily surprised before realizing, "Ah, you're an alchemist—they wouldn’t notify you." 

Seeing Li Shiming still hovering in the air, he gestured for him to enter his cave residence. 

The cave, located at the mountain's summit, was similar in scale to Swordholding Peak. The main hall was adorned with numerous valuable spiritual artifacts. A female attendant served spiritual tea, and Li Shiming couldn’t help but glance at her, surprised that Xu Chuan employed female attendants. 

Xu Chuan chuckled. "I heard from the other senior brothers that you turned the female cultivators they sent you into laborers. They had hoped you’d take them as attendants!" 

"I prefer solitude," Li Shiming replied with a shake of his head. 

Xu Chuan didn’t press further—after all, the small spiritual fields wouldn’t overwork the female cultivators. He had only been teasing. 

"News has come that the conflict between the Senluo Sect and the Thousand Leaves Temple ended with the death of a Senluo Sect Golden Core elder. But the conflict between the righteous and demonic factions isn’t over—this is just the beginning," Xu Chuan said, his expression turning serious. 

Li Shiming had personally been involved and knew exactly how that Golden Core elder had died—though it had nothing to do with the Thousand Leaves Temple. Still, he pretended ignorance. 

"Three days ago, the Earth Fiend Sect clashed with our sect at the southern border. We lost three Foundation Establishment cultivators, while they lost two. It’s said that Elder Ji fought a Golden Core elder from the Earth Fiend Sect." 

Xu Chuan continued, "Yesterday, the sect issued orders to dispatch a thousand Foundation Establishment cultivators to the south. They plan to seize several spirit mines along the border." 

"What about the other senior brothers?" Li Shiming asked quickly. His clone, Li Yuanba, had experienced such battles before and knew how dangerous they could be. 

"Second Brother and Third Brother went. My injuries have healed, but my strength hasn’t fully recovered, so the sect didn’t send me," Xu Chuan replied with a bitter smile. 

"Perhaps it’s for the best," Li Shiming consoled him. 

He knew not every cultivator had auxiliary talents like his, which allowed him to earn large amounts of contribution points easily. Even as a true disciple, Xu Chuan couldn’t rely solely on their master’s support—he needed to complete sect missions to improve his strength. 

Large-scale battles offered high rewards, and as a true disciple with proven strength, Xu Chuan would normally have been expected to participate. Being sidelined due to his weakened state was understandably frustrating. 

After spending some time with Xu Chuan, Li Shiming sent messages to Elder Su and Elder Ma to inform them of his return before heading back to Swordholding Peak. 

Once in his cave, he immediately resumed his interrupted studies. 

Though he had been away, he had taken nine alchemy cauldrons with him and had been refining them daily. Though they weren’t fully attuned yet, they were ready for alchemy. 

Before leaving, he had already prepared for simultaneous ten-cauldron alchemy. 

With his mastery of the *Soul-Splitting Thought Technique* and the aid of his divine sense, controlling ten cauldrons at once was no longer a challenge. 

For his first attempt, he chose something simple—ten batches of *Shushan Primordial Pills*. Over the past year, he had mostly been refining these pills for sect missions, leaving him with plenty of materials. 

Since he consistently produced top-grade pills in full batches, he only needed eight successful batches to fulfill the sect’s ten-material quota. 

As high-grade *Shushan Primordial Pills* were useless to him, he had long since started exchanging his share of high-grade pills for materials, saving them for practice. 

Now, these materials came in handy—he could afford to fail without worry. 

Alchemists required significant initial investment. The sect’s pill missions demanded eight pills per batch, and beginners often failed to meet that quota or even ruined batches entirely, forcing them to compensate the sect. 

Unlike private commissions, where the client bore the risk, sect missions enforced an 80% submission rate. If Li Shiming failed with sect-provided materials, he’d have to compensate with ten batches—two days’ worth of alchemy, using his own materials. 

Extending his divine sense, Li Shiming enveloped all ten cauldrons—including the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Cauldron—in his awareness. The *Soul-Splitting Thought Technique* divided his consciousness into ten parts, each capable of independent thought. 

The *Shushan Primordial Pill* was so familiar to him that the ten consciousnesses effortlessly guided the materials into the cauldrons. 

The *Golden Sun Fire Control Technique*, split ten ways, managed the Crimson Sun Flames in each cauldron. With his peak early Foundation Establishment spiritual power, sustaining ten flames simultaneously was no issue. 

IBMz15 also split into ten threads, monitoring each cauldron in real time. 

Though this was his first ten-cauldron attempt, his movements were methodical and precise. 

His divine sense, enhanced by the *Green Willow Sensing Technique*, allowed IBMz15 to convert the cauldron conditions into data. The slightest irregularity would be detected and corrected immediately. 

Ten consciousnesses guided his divine sense to lightly tap the cauldrons in a rhythmic, almost musical pattern. 

As pill qi billowed out, one hundred *Shushan Primordial Pills* emerged in succession—a spectacular sight. 

The pills were neatly stored in ten jade bottles, all confirmed to be high-grade without needing inspection. 

Li Shiming smiled. Though he had expected success, the achievement thrilled him—his alchemy output had just increased tenfold. 

And this was outside his Machine Room Space. Inside, his control reached micrometer precision, further improving pill quality. 

Still, he wasn’t satisfied. Now that he had divine sense and spiritual flames, he could attempt higher-tier alchemy—even without reaching mid-Foundation Establishment. 

High-tier alchemy required deeper knowledge and mandatory techniques. 

High-tier alchemists could refine mid-to-late Foundation Establishment pills, most of which required second-grade spiritual herbs. Balancing their energies demanded advanced techniques. 

The *Shushan Alchemy Canon* prescribed three mandatory techniques for high-tier alchemy: *Thirty-Six Palm Pill Return Technique*, *Spiritual Flame Control Technique*, and *Green Emperor Sensing Technique*. An optional fourth, *Hundredfold Division Technique*, was also available. 

The *Thirty-Six Palm Pill Return Technique* balanced energies within the cauldron through rhythmic strikes. 

The *Spiritual Flame Control Technique* was optimized for spiritual flames—a prerequisite for mastering the *Shushan Alchemy Canon* at this level. 

The *Green Emperor Sensing Technique* required divine sense to monitor the herbs’ state. 

The *Hundredfold Division Technique* was optional due to its difficulty. When successful, it could double a batch’s output—up to twenty pills—without sacrificing quality. 

But the success rate was abysmal—less than 1%. Worse, failure risked ruining the entire batch. Only gamblers would attempt it. 

With IBMz15’s help, Li Shiming mastered these techniques rapidly. No matter how complex the runes or concepts, IBMz15 memorized and simulated them perfectly. 

This was his greatest advantage. The *Shushan Alchemy Canon*’s extensive herbology and balancing principles were also organized and absorbed through IBMz15. 

Using his contribution points, Li Shiming acquired materials for *Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills*—a mid-Foundation Establishment pill only high-tier alchemists could refine. 

Instead of attempting it alone, he took three batches to Pill Cauldron Peak for Elder Ma’s guidance. 

Sometimes, Li Shiming felt Elder Ma was his true master. Unlike Elder Su, who was only available at fixed times, Elder Ma granted him unrestricted access to Pill Cauldron Hall. 

Entering quietly, he found Elder Ma refining pills and sat down to observe. 

His rapid progress in alchemy—especially his near-flawless success rate with early Foundation Establishment pills—was largely due to data collected from Elder Ma’s demonstrations via IBMz15. 

Attempting *Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills* alone would have wasted precious materials—each batch contained five second-grade herbs. 

Watching Elder Ma once would allow IBMz15 to record the optimal method, minimizing trial and error. 

"Here to refine *Yellow Spirit Pills*?" Elder Ma asked without turning, still focused on his cauldron. 

"How did you know?" Li Shiming was astonished. He had come straight after acquiring the materials—how could Elder Ma know? 

"You carry the scent of second-grade Yellow Spirit Powder—a herb you’ve never handled before," Elder Ma replied with a smile. 

Li Shiming marveled at Elder Ma’s perception. A brief inspection of the herb had left a trace detectable only to an expert. 

"Master, I brought three batches. May I ask for your guidance in refining one?" 

"Place them there," Elder Ma said, pointing to a shelf. 

After Li Shiming set down one batch, Elder Ma produced another cauldron and began demonstrating *Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill* refinement—while simultaneously continuing his own alchemy.
