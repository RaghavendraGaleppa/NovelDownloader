# Chapter 48: The Origin Stele  

Zhang Yan never expected that the communication talisman would come from Elder Bai.  

Moreover, this showed just how much Elder Bai valued him.  

Elder Bai possessed Zhang Yan's jade token, which allowed for direct jade-based communication. However, for formal visits to one's residence, a communication talisman was considered more respectful—hence why Elder Bai had chosen to use it.  

"Please invite him in," Zhang Yan waved his hand, instructing Liu Yiting to bring Elder Bai inside.  

"Elder Bai, it's been a while!" Zhang Yan greeted him warmly, while the elder appeared somewhat flustered by the reception.  

Elder Bai was merely an outer sect steward.  

The Qingheng Sect was divided into inner and outer sects, and so were its stewards.  

Most outer sect stewards were cultivators at the late Qi Refining stage, while inner sect stewards were at the Foundation Establishment stage.  

To become an elder of the Qingheng Sect, one had to be at the Golden Core stage.  

Of course, there were exceptions—some Foundation Establishment cultivators with exceptional skills could also become elders, though such cases were rare.  

Though Zhang Yan was currently only an inner sect disciple—nominally of equal status to Elder Bai—he was also a direct disciple of a Golden Core Patriarch!  

That alone placed him far beyond Elder Bai's reach. Add to that the fact that Elder Bai clearly had a favor to ask, and it was no surprise he was being so cautious.  

"Only a few months have passed, yet who would have thought that Fellow Daoist Zhang would now be the esteemed disciple of a Golden Core Patriarch?" Elder Bai sighed as he looked at Zhang Yan.  

From their very first meeting, he had sensed that this young man was extraordinary and destined for greatness.  

After all, Zhang Yan had mastered the Wood Origin Technique at such a young age.  

In Elder Bai's estimation, with some luck, Zhang Yan could at least reach Foundation Establishment, which would make him an inner sect steward at worst. But Zhang Yan had surpassed all expectations—becoming a direct disciple of a Golden Core Patriarch had elevated his status far beyond what Elder Bai could ever hope to achieve.  

"There's no need to be so tense, Fellow Daoist Bai. If you have something to say, just speak freely."  

After Liu Yiting served them tea and left, the two were alone.  

"Well, Fellow Daoist Zhang, as you know, I'm an outer sect steward and often collaborate with various clans. Someone has asked me to inquire whether you'd be willing to accept a sponsorship."  

"A sponsorship?" Zhang Yan was puzzled.  

He was familiar with clan sponsorships—both clans and sects had them, typically referring to guest elders who received resources without taking on heavy responsibilities.  

However, the requirements for such sponsorships were usually high, with Foundation Establishment being the minimum threshold.  

At the early Qi Refining stage, how could he possibly qualify as a sponsor? Wouldn't that invite ridicule?  

Elder Bai quickly clarified, "The truth is, skilled spirit plant cultivators are hard to find outside the sect—especially someone of your caliber. These clans are specifically looking for a spirit plant specialist as a sponsor."  

Zhang Yan inwardly scoffed. Compared to alchemists and artifact forgers, spirit plant cultivators were far from rare.  

If someone wanted to learn the art of spirit plant cultivation, many might hoard their knowledge, but if they were offered a sponsorship, plenty would jump at the opportunity.  

Still, Zhang Yan didn't expose this fact.  

He simply took down the details and said he would consider it.  

To get a better understanding, Zhang Yan sought out Mu Sen for advice. Mu Sen was completely unfazed by such matters.  

According to him, the clans were undoubtedly interested in Zhang Yan's status as a Golden Core Patriarch's direct disciple.  

This kind of thing was unavoidable.  

And if they were offering resources, why not take them?  

They were free, after all. If the clan encountered issues related to spirit plant cultivation, Zhang Yan could help resolve them. If they wanted to use his reputation for protection, he could consider offering shelter. But if their clan faced a problem beyond Zhang Yan's ability to handle? Well, he could simply pretend it never happened.  

After all, for cultivators, survival was the most important thing!  

Never stick your neck out when it wasn't necessary.  

Mu Sen's words put Zhang Yan at ease. If his senior brothers all operated this way, then why should he hold back?  

In this world, who didn't take advantage of opportunities?  

If he didn't, how would his senior brothers and sisters get their share?  

After agreeing, Zhang Yan officially became a sponsor for a cultivation clan, receiving an annual stipend of 3,000 spirit stones.  

He couldn't help but marvel at their generosity.  

Once the formalities were settled, Zhang Yan focused on his cultivation, diligently refining his spiritual energy in hopes of breaking through to the fourth level of Qi Refining.  

Perhaps due to his low-grade spiritual root, the bottleneck between early and mid-stage Qi Refining was far more stubborn for him than for most.  

He sought advice from Zhuge Wan, who told him to continue purifying his spiritual energy.  

If it was refined enough, the barrier would break. If not, he could always resort to elixirs.  

Her words gave Zhang Yan confidence—his lack of progress was simply due to insufficiently pure spiritual energy.  

Zhuge Wan could only encourage him, explaining that unless one specifically learned a technique to purify spiritual energy, this was a common hurdle.  

However, dedicating time to learning such a technique wasn't worth it—mastering a single spell took far too long.  

With that time, it was better to save up spirit stones and buy elixirs instead.  

But while Zhuge Wan spoke casually, Zhang Yan took note.  

If there was such a method, he needed to remember it.  

After leaving Zhuge Wan, he didn't return to his residence.  

Instead, he headed straight for the Dao Transmission Pavilion.  

The Dao Transmission Pavilion was similar to the Enlightenment Peak in the outer sect—both were places where cultivation techniques and spells were taught.  

The only difference was that one served the inner sect while the other served the outer sect.  

Upon arriving, Zhang Yan's eyes widened in amazement.  

Though this place fulfilled the same function as the Enlightenment Peak, there were no instructors here.  

Instead, the teachings were recorded on stone steles.  

For example, the Evergreen Technique he had previously learned had been copied from a jade slip.  

These steles all shared a specific name—**Origin Steles**.  

Made from a unique type of stone, these steles were incredibly durable, and the knowledge inscribed on them would remain intact for millennia. Most importantly, each Origin Stele could only be inscribed once.  

This meant the techniques recorded on them were highly reliable—unlike jade slips, which could be freely copied and altered, Origin Steles were immutable.  

To Zhang Yan, this was a vast treasure trove.  

Each Origin Stele bore descriptions of the techniques or spells they contained.  

For instance, the stele closest to him recorded a spell:  

**[Blazing Flame Technique]**  

And its description also indicated its proficiency level:  

**[Blazing Flame Technique – Minor Achievement]**  

"But what's this?"  

Zhang Yan's gaze fell on another Origin Stele labeled **Pure Yang Virgin Technique**.  

If he wasn't mistaken, this was a technique for preserving one's pure yang essence. Yet, the description on this stele read:  

**[Yin-Yang Harmony Technique – Major Achievement]**
