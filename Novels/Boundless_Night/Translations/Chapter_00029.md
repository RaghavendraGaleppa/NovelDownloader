Chapter 29: Change in the Mountains

Before the mountain forest under the night sky, Ling Xu and the Tabby Cat vanished in a flash into the vast snowy expanse. It was one thing for the two of them, but Wei Mo, ten meters tall and clad in ancient, mottled armor, also disappeared in an instant. His movements were incredibly swift, barely anyone could react.

Only the old weasel, with its pure white fur, unhurriedly waved its paw, summoned a donkey, and slowly rode away into the deep mountains.

The abnormal creatures in the dense forest also retreated. Suddenly, vast flocks of flying beings appeared over the boundless mountain range, and numerous figures climbed and leaped across the mountain slopes. Outside the mountain, on the snowy ground, whether they were nobles from Crimson Cloud City, members of the Mountain Patrol Team, or local Newborns, they all dispersed. Even after walking a considerable distance, people were still discussing how seeing higher beings with their own eyes today made the trip worthwhile.

“What is the origin of that feathered woman? We’ve never heard of her in Crimson Cloud City; she’s truly formidable.”

“She’s probably the expert the City Lord invited from afar.”

Some youths were particularly excited and invigorated. After witnessing a glimpse of the powerful abilities displayed by the higher echelons, they constantly debated, feeling as if they had seen an entirely new world.

“Is that the limit we can reach in the future?”

“Wake up, there’s a limit called the City Lord, but there’s only one in the entire Crimson Cloud City. Your limit is to strive for twenty years to get a job as a doorman in the City Lord’s mansion.”

On the road, even noble direct descendants like Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing couldn't help but converse.

“Cousin, what level have you reached now? You’re also on the Juling God path. You’re already over three meters tall, and that person named Wei Mo is ten meters. I feel that the difference in your heights isn’t that great, does that mean your strength also…”

“Shut up!” Cao Long’s face immediately changed. They hadn't even gotten far from the mountain yet. He stopped his young, green cousin, saying, “Senior Wei was already twenty to thirty meters tall twenty years ago. Now he’s undergoing a reverse transformation; we cannot possibly fathom what level he has reached.”

Just then, a silver-haired elder of higher status from the Mountain Patrol Team approached and asked, “Is anyone from the Wang family of Crimson Cloud City here?”

People immediately realized it must be about Wang Nianzhong. He had slaughtered a nest of spiritual creatures—blood snakes—and was suspected of having harmed multiple Mountain Patrol members in the process.

“Nianzhong is missing; we are also looking for him,” a middle-aged man replied.

“Could he have fled out of fear of punishment?” the silver-haired elder said. Although his face was heavily wrinkled, he was still vigorous, and cold electricity shot from his eyes. If it were ordinary Mountain Patrol members, the Wang family naturally wouldn’t care, but now the nature of the matter had changed. Someone from above was inquiring, and they were quite apprehensive. This was because the head of the Mountain Patrol Team was the Vice City Lord of Crimson Cloud City.

“We are also looking for him. I believe Nianzhong wouldn't do such a thing,” the middle-aged man said, then accompanied the elder to the snowy ground to explain something.

In Twin Tree Village, Qin Ming, Old Liu, and Xu Yueping watched the snow fall outside the window. They were in a warm house, eating steaming hot donkey meat from a copper pot and drinking fine wine dug up from the Mountain Patrol Team’s outpost.

Qin Ming, who had originally been indifferent to alcohol, was now a bit tipsy. He had never imagined that Wang Nianzhong, whose name he only learned after his death, could still be so useful even after he was gone. Coupled with his successful Second Nirvana, Qin Ming sipped leisurely, feeling very relaxed.

He gazed out the window, his thoughts soaring, his heart not so calm. Where exactly was Falling Moon City? He would have to go and see it eventually. That dark night two years ago, a raging fire had consumed the entire village. The feathered youth had stepped over the ruined walls, ethereal and detached, striking mercilessly… He could never forget those scenes.

Qin Ming sighed softly in his heart. If he hadn't known these past events, he could have continued to live peacefully, but now he had to accelerate his progress.

“Little Qin, is it just my imagination? I feel like your spirit and vitality are stronger than before, and your height seems to have grown slightly,” Old Liu said. Although he was old and frail, his eyes were sharp. Qin Ming had not used "Blending with Light and Dust" in front of him and Xu Yueping, so his demeanor was naturally somewhat different from before.

Xu Yueping nodded, saying, “Yes, there’s some change. Your eyes are clearer, and you seem even more handsome.”

After this Second Nirvana, Qin Ming’s body had only grown by less than half an inch; people who weren't extremely familiar with him wouldn't notice such a change. He had already confirmed that the Nirvana method recorded in the silk scroll would not cause continuous height growth. He smiled and replied, “I’m only sixteen; my body hasn’t fully developed yet. It’s possible for changes to happen every few days.” After this Nirvana, in addition to having two thousand catties of strength in his arms, his flexibility and speed had greatly increased, standing out most prominently. His strength could be said to have grown rapidly.

Late at night, everything was silent. The world was like a giant abyss, ready to swallow all light. Suddenly, deep within the mountains, silver lightning streaked across the ink-like night. Crimson霞 dyed the mountain ridges red, and giants, carrying black spears, broke through mountaintops, roaring as if to shatter the mountains and rivers, causing terrifying avalanches there.

“They’ve already started!”

On a high slope outside the mountain, a woman in a black fur cloak was gazing, watching the obviously abnormal and terrifying night scene, her eyes swirling with brilliant light. A purple-eyed crow stood on a low tree, speaking in human tongue: “That group of foreign higher beings won’t be able to hold them off. They’ll have to retreat tonight. If all goes well, we can enter the mountain in two days to search for the place where the five-colored smoke and light shine.”

Behind the woman and the crow were some other dark figures. One person spoke: “With the high echelons of Crimson Cloud City and the native abnormal creatures of the mountain joining forces, those migrating higher beings simply can’t resist. It’s very likely that some powerful creatures will be left behind as rare spiritual materials.”

The tall woman in the cloak watched the depths of the mountain, not turning back, and said, “You Liangyun, after the mountain sweep begins, go and assess someone for me. Hmm, if you win, don’t kill him. If you lose, then don’t return to Flowing Light City with me; just go back to Crimson Cloud City and be a noble young master.”

There were more than a dozen people behind her. One young man among them was startled upon hearing this, his hands instantly clenching inside his sleeves. He was a noble from Crimson Cloud City, a direct descendant of the You family. Originally, when the woman was selecting people in the city, he had been full of hope, but in the end, he didn't even qualify as a reserve candidate. It was only through his family elders pulling strings and paying a considerable price that he got a chance to go to Flowing Light City with the woman. He desired nothing more than to listen to secret methods from the woman’s mysterious teacher; even a year or half a year of learning would be worth it. But now, he felt a sense of crisis. Who was she asking him to assess? Would he even lose this accompanying qualification?

The woman’s figure was graceful as she continued to stare into the depths of the mountain. “His name is Qin Ming, one of only two Newborns with a Golden Foundation in this area this year. Your You family also has people here; I imagine with your connections, you’ll quickly find out. Remember, I’m asking you to assess him, not to use underhanded methods.”

“Alright, I’ll find someone to investigate immediately,” You Liangyun turned and left, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

The crow watched his retreating back and said, “When You Liangyun first became a Newborn, he could lift six hundred and fifty catties. In Crimson Cloud City this year, he’s weaker than the other male and female. There were no unusual signs when he established his Golden Foundation.”

The woman nodded and said, “Qi Huaien, follow him. I actually want to observe You Liangyun’s character. He originally didn’t qualify to meet my teacher with me. If he doesn't perform well this time, there truly won’t be any need for him to come along. Qi Huaien, while you’re at it, check on that Qin Ming. See if he can become one of the reserve candidates.”

On this late night, many sensitive Newborns outside the mountain were aware of the commotion. They ascended to high places, gazing toward the mountain, because the activity within the mountain was truly too great. Even from a great distance, one could hear the terrifying roars of the abnormal creatures.

The depths of the mountain were in utter chaos. Large numbers of strange insects, birds, and other creatures flew into the night sky, fleeing in panic. Within the dense forest, the cries of apes and roars of tigers were incessant. Even as far away as Silver Vine Town, the mysterious old noble was informed immediately. His silver hair shimmered like crystal strands, and his complexion was ruddy and bright. At this moment, he donned a tiger skin coat, his body as light as a wisp of smoke, instantly appearing atop the tallest building of his mansion. Despite the heavy night mist at this time, he still gazed toward the mountain, softly muttering, “I hope precious items I need have been born during this special juncture.”

“Are they fighting?” Qin Ming leaped onto the roof, looking toward the mountain. Twin Tree Village wasn’t far, which made him feel vigilant and cautious. Fortunately, although the mountain was chaotic that night, the turmoil did not spread to the outside areas. One side clearly held absolute initiative, highly controlling the rhythm.

The next day, many people were discussing that the situation in the mountains had changed dramatically! There was no doubt that people from Crimson Cloud City and local Newborns would soon be allowed to enter the mountain to search for special nodes and collect any rare products that might exist.

After eating breakfast the following day, Qin Ming began practicing the Nirvana methods recorded in the silk scroll. His body immediately felt like it contained a furnace, continuously providing him with power. Afterward, he practiced the combat techniques from the saber manual. Now, wielding his long-handled dark gold hammer felt like casually swinging a straw pole; it felt light and effortless.

Xu Yueping pushed the door open and entered. He was startled to see Qin Ming almost making the heavy dark gold hammer dance, but quickly said, “Little Qin, stop practicing your hammer techniques. Your future father-in-law sent someone to invite you to meet him.”

“Huh?” Qin Ming was stunned, a puzzled expression on his face.

“The old noble from Silver Vine Town specifically asked to see you,” Xu Yueping informed him.

Qin Ming immediately understood, calmly asking, “He’s not meeting just me, right?”

“Well… he’ll certainly choose, but you and Zhou Wubing are the only two who have established a Golden Foundation, so you certainly stand out from the crowd. However, at this critical juncture…” Xu Yueping frowned. He had also thought deeply about the previous incident afterward and felt that his decision at the time was indeed ill-considered.

“It would be rude not to go, wouldn’t it?” Qin Ming asked.

Xu Yueping nodded, saying, “Indeed, it would seem disrespectful. It’s said that even nobles from Crimson Cloud City have visited him in Silver Vine Town. He seems to have a considerable background, possibly from a very important place.”

Qin Ming smiled, “Then I’ll go for a visit, get some free food and drinks. At this juncture, there’s a high probability of receiving benefits.”

“You!” Xu Yueping said, smiling as he pointed a finger at him.

Xu Yueping had seriously considered it and felt there would be no harm in going. With so many masters from Crimson Cloud City present, what could the old noble possibly ask of a youth who had only undergone one Nirvana? If there was genuinely “serious business,” Qin Ming could feign compliance and just take the benefits.

“Hmm, I’ll go in a bit. And I’ll take a look at his daughter, to see why that noble lady is so troubled with marriage.” Qin Ming said.
