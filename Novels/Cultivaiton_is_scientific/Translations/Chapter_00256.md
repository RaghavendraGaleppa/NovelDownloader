# Chapter 256: Return to the Sect

After returning from the sea to the Northern Shu Continent, Li Shiming had an invisible little snake coiled around his finger—his newly contracted 'Spirit-Severing Phantom Serpent.'

The 'Nine Melodies Insect Scripture' held the 'Spirit-Severing Phantom Serpent' in extremely high regard. On one hand, its combat prowess was formidable, especially in ambushes where it was nearly unstoppable against opponents of the same level. On the other hand, its loyalty was unwavering. 

In the inherited space left behind by the Five Qi Sect, even after its master had dissolved the contract, the 'Spirit-Severing Phantom Serpent' had remained guarding its master's remains until death. This loyalty was so profound that even after the massive serpent's demise, it passed down this protective instinct through generations, ensuring successive 'Spirit-Severing Phantom Serpents' continued to guard their master's remains.

The cold, slippery sensation from the serpent coiled around his finger didn't bother Li Shiming. Instead, the sense of dependence it conveyed delighted him. This was his first true spirit beast. While his clone, Li Yuanba, was essentially an extension of himself, and he also had twelve iron corpses, the latter were only intelligent in terms of combat instincts. After all, one couldn't exactly engage in meaningful interaction with a refined corpse.

The 'Spirit-Severing Phantom Serpent' became his companion. Given its lifespan, this companionship might very well last a lifetime.

Feeding the serpent, however, proved troublesome. The 'Nine Melodies Insect Scripture' was an ancient inheritance, and many of the ingredients listed in its spirit beast dietary recipes had long been lost. Fortunately, spirit beasts possessed an innate sense of what they could consume. Li Shiming experimented by offering various spirit materials, and the serpent consistently chose spirit pills—any kind, it seemed to love them all.

Initially, Li Shiming worried about potential side effects. But after the serpent consumed a Qi Refining late-stage first-grade spirit pill, he meticulously examined its condition through their spiritual connection and found no issues. The serpent's digestive capabilities were astonishing—it could fully absorb a pill in just a few hours, a process that would take a Qi Refining late-stage cultivator days. Moreover, it showed no signs of developing resistance, treating the pills purely as energy sources.

Most cultivators wouldn't be able to afford such a voracious spirit beast, but Li Shiming was an exception. As the serpent swallowed another pill and playfully coiled around his palm in gratitude, he smiled and turned his attention to his recent gains.

Initially, he had believed the 'Five Tones Qi Refining Art' to be his greatest harvest, with the serpent as a secondary prize. After all, cultivation techniques formed the foundation of a cultivator's strength, far surpassing external aids like spirit beasts. However, during his journey back, as he studied the 'Five Elements Grand Dao' with the help of IBMz15, he realized that this was likely his most significant acquisition.

Though he couldn't fully comprehend the 'Five Elements Grand Dao' even after multiple readings, it evoked a strange familiarity, reminiscent of his experience with the Divine Footsteps Technique. The two weren't similar in content, but both touched upon the deepest layers of power in the cultivation world. Unlike the Divine Footsteps Technique, which had practical applications like 'Lotus Steps' at the Foundation Building stage, the 'Five Elements Grand Dao' seemed to require at least Golden Core cultivation before revealing its true potential.

Shaking his head, Li Shiming stored the ancient jade slip containing the 'Five Elements Grand Dao' into his machine room space, along with the other two jade slips. The two magical treasures he had acquired, however, remained out—he planned to consult his master, Elder Su, about them upon his return, as his knowledge of such artifacts was limited.

As soon as he entered communication range, his identity jade tablet buzzed with messages from Elder Su and Elder Ma, checking on his safety. Having been out of contact while away from the Northern Shu Continent, his prolonged absence had evidently caused some concern. He promptly reassured them and shared his route to ease their minds.

His time outside the sect's communication range hadn't been long—only about three days spent in the underwater space. Though the site had a spirit vein, its energy output was meager after eons of neglect, barely sufficient to sustain his cultivation. Once the serpent hatched and stabilized, he left, carefully restoring the seabed's silt to conceal the entrance. With its exact location now known, he could return effortlessly using 'Lotus Steps' in the future.

Traveling cautiously, Li Shiming remained wary of potential pursuit by the Thousand Leaves Temple. With no urgent matters at hand, he opted for a leisurely flight, savoring the scenery. He knew that once he returned, leaving the sect again would be difficult—not only due to the trouble with the temple but also because he had gathered all the resources he needed. His focus would soon shift to strengthening himself in preparation for advancing to the Golden Core stage.

A day later, as he flew on his sword light, he sensed an approaching Golden Core aura. Initially prepared to evade, he relaxed upon recognizing the familiar presence and halted mid-air to wait.

"Disciple greets Uncle-Master Zhao!" Li Shiming bowed respectfully.

"Finally found you! Let's hurry back," Zhao said with a smile.

"You came looking for me?" Li Shiming asked, surprised. The last time they'd met, Zhao had rescued him from trouble. This time, however, he hadn't sent any distress signals.

"The Thousand Leaves Temple and the Northern Shu Trading Company have repeatedly requested to see you at the sect. We were also concerned the temple might intercept you, so your master sent me to fetch you," Zhao explained, using his spiritual sense to accelerate their flight.

Though phrased as a jest, the assignment reflected the close ties between Zhao and Elder Su. As a sword cultivator, Zhao's speed and combat prowess made him the ideal escort.

"Why is the Thousand Leaves Temple so fixated on me?" Li Shiming seized the opportunity to ask the approachable elder.

"According to your master, your fortune is simply too great—you stumbled right into this mess. The temple's venerables claim they've detected traces of a Buddhist senior's reincarnation, and since you were nearby at the time, they want to extract clues from you," Zhao replied candidly.

Understanding dawned on Li Shiming. His clone, Li Yuanba, had used 'Lotus Steps,' a technique so complex that mastering it in such a short time would naturally arouse suspicions of a reincarnated Buddhist expert. Had he himself used the technique in front of the monks, he might have been labeled a reincarnated senior as well.

"It seems I won't be leaving the sect anytime soon," he sighed.

"Let's get back first. This time, the Thousand Leaves Temple provoked our sect—even the Patriarch got involved. They won't escape without consequences," Zhao said nonchalantly.

The bigger the trouble Li Shiming stirred, the more it underscored his influence. Neither Zhao nor Li Shiming's masters were overly worried, as the Thousand Leaves Temple, being part of the righteous faction, wouldn't dare harm him now that the sect was aware of the situation. The fact that Venerable Zhiming had broken Li Shiming's defensive array alone had already put the temple at a disadvantage.

To mitigate the fallout, the temple had dispatched Venerable Zhikong, their highest-ranking arhat, to the Mount Shu Sect's headquarters. Similarly, the Northern Shu Trading Company had sent Lai Fei, a Golden Core late-stage chief manager, instead of the usual False Core representative Cai Hong—a clear escalation in their regard for Li Shiming. Such gestures forced the temple to reconsider any further actions against him.

With Zhao's escort, their return progressed swiftly, though even his sword flight paled in comparison to 'Lotus Steps.' Li Shiming stored the serpent in his machine room space, leaving it with ample spirit pills to feed on. He had no intention of revealing its existence—its ability to evade spiritual sense detection alone would attract unwanted attention. Keeping it as a hidden trump card was far more advantageous.

Throughout the journey, Zhao tirelessly extolled the virtues of sword cultivation, occasionally demonstrating his sword intent in hopes of converting Li Shiming. Unbeknownst to him, Li Shiming had no need to pursue the path—his clone Li Yuanba was already a dedicated sword cultivator, granting him partial access to such techniques. Combined with his thunder magic and array mastery, his combat prowess already surpassed most peers.

As they traveled, Li Shiming also devoted time to researching corpse refinement arrays. With twelve iron corpses—eleven of which were three-headed, six-armed variants—integrating them into formations could significantly enhance their combat effectiveness.
