# Chapter 551: An Interlude

He had only just barely stepped into the late stage of Qi Refining, not even catching a glimpse of the Foundation Establishment threshold. In the eyes of the one before him, he was no different from an ant on the ground.

A pressure unique to a Foundation Establishment Master,无形无质 yet heavy as a mountain, naturally radiated out. The youth grunted, his face instantly turning from red to pale. His body swayed violently, his knees buckling as he nearly collapsed to the ground.

But he forcefully straightened his spine, stubbornly holding his ground. His eyes were bloodshot, glaring fixedly at Xu Yunfan, a mixture of deep-seated hatred and desperate madness in his gaze.

“Xu… Xu Zhenren!”

The youth’s voice was hoarse and dry, as if he had used all the strength in his body to utter those three words.

Xu Yunfan lowered his head slightly to look down at this little worm blocking his path. The natural and open smile on his face thinned to an extreme, his eyes calm and placid, without a single ripple of emotion.

At this level, if he were to treat him with humility and calmness, then in the very next second, the other Foundation Establishment Masters who were secretly watching would probably frantically send their Qi Refining disciples to cause trouble for him.

“Is there something?”

The voice was flat, betraying no anger or joy, yet it made the youth feel a cold current instantly invade his internal organs.

The youth’s Adam’s apple rolled violently, his breathing grew heavy. Under Xu Yunfan’s gaze, which was calm to the point of suffocation, he squeezed out a question he had been suppressing for a long time from between his teeth.

“Yu’er… Senior Sister Pu Yu… was she captured by you?!”

By the end of his words, it was almost a sob.

“Yu’er? Pu Yu?”

Xu Yunfan seemed to think for a moment before recalling the name. The corner of his brow twitched imperceptibly, and then a faint, ambiguous smile appeared on his face, laced with naked contempt and mockery.

“Oh? That little girl from the Hundred Desires Peak?”

He looked the courageous little cultivator up and down, and in his heart, he understood a thing or two.

A youth muddle-headed by love. He couldn’t help but feel a bit of a sigh in his heart. Pu Yu was a先天情欲道体 (Innate Lust Dao Body), and naturally attracted the attention of many of the opposite sex.

This youth before him was quite pure.

“She is my prey, so naturally she is on my peak, serving as a furnace for me to cultivate from day and night. What, you want to save her?”

Xu Yunfan’s words were spoken without the slightest concealment.

The youth’s chest heaved violently upon hearing this,刺激得几乎要失去理智 (stimulated to the point of almost losing his sanity) by Xu Yunfan’s contemptuous words of ‘furnace,’ but the rationality he had left told him that acting on impulse was seeking death. A single breath from the opponent could kill him on the spot.

“She, she is the most important person to me! I beg, I beg Xu Zhenren to be magnanimous and let her go! Whatever compensation you want, this disciple is willing to exchange with my life!”

The youth screamed, his voice filled with a desperate plea. He actually ‘plopped’ and knelt down, kowtowing to Xu Yunfan with a ‘bang bang’ sound. His forehead was instantly broken, blood streaming down his face.

Seeing the other party kneel, the corner of Xu Yunfan’s mouth hooked into a mocking arc. His voice grew even colder, his clear words like a heavy hammer striking the youth’s heart.

“Exchange with your life?”

He let out a cold laugh, a laugh devoid of any warmth. “Your life, in my eyes, is not worth a penny.”

He walked forward slowly, looking down from his high position at the youth who was kowtowing like a pestle, the blood from his forehead staining the ground red.

If one could achieve what they prayed for in their heart just by kowtowing and begging, then what need would there be for cultivation?

Just kowtow, then.

Furthermore, this youth was not related to him by blood or marriage, and to perform such an act in public was a clear case of moral kidnapping.

If this were in an orthodox sect like the Wansheng Sword Sect, Xu Yunfan would probably have been pointed at by a thousand fingers.

Unfortunately, this was the Primordial Dao Sect.

Such operations were very common.

Even the Foundation Establishment Masters secretly watching were waiting to eat melons and watch the show.

“Just a mere Qi Refining cultivator, and you dare question me like this? Are you tired of living in the mortal world and want to go report to the Nine Netherworlds early, or do you think that because I’m in a good mood today, I won’t crush an ant that has offended a Zhenren?”

Each word contained an invisible force, like a knife cutting into the youth’s already precarious mind and dignity.

The youth’s body stiffened, his kowtowing motion stopped. He lay prostrate on the cold stone surface, trembling violently. Crimson blood dripped down his cheeks, spreading out on the black ground.

Xu Yunfan watched with interest.

The unique yet self-conscious pride of a youth.

It always made him reminisce about the passion of his own youth.

A flame woven from humiliation, despair, anger, and fear burned in the youth’s chest, almost incinerating his reason.

He suddenly raised his head, his face, stained with blood and dirt, contorted into a grimace. In his eyes was a hatred that even the waters of the Three Rivers could not wash away. He used the last bit of his strength to roar:

“Xu Yunfan, you bully others just because your cultivation is high! I, Qi Hanfeng, am not your equal today because I am not strong enough! But you remember this! Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river! This debt, I记下了 (have taken it down)! One day, I will surely come to collect it from you!!”

After roaring out these words, it seemed to have exhausted all his strength and courage. The youth Qi Hanfeng’s body went limp and he collapsed to the ground, leaving only a pair of eyes burning with fire, glaring fixedly at Xu Yunfan’s face.

“Heh.”

Facing this typical weakling’s declaration, Xu Yunfan couldn’t even be bothered to say another word, only letting out a very slight sneer, full of mockery and contempt.

He no longer looked at Qi Hanfeng, who was like a rag doll on the ground, and turned around, walking calmly and steadily towards the exit of the plaza.

It was truly a waste of his time.

He had thought the youth might pull out some great killing weapon for him to see, but it turned out to be just empty talk.

He was completely a brainless and chuunibyou, thinking that by being this bold, someone would praise his courage and loyalty.

In the Primordial Dao Sect, this was the most worthless thing.

Just as he turned his back on the youth, the hand Xu Yunfan had hanging at his side, as if casually brushing away a speck of dust, gave an extremely tiny flick in the air.

There was no light at his fingertip, nor any dissipation of energy fluctuations.

Qi Hanfeng lay collapsed on the ground, his vision blurry. Only the pair of eyes burning with humiliation and hatred followed Xu Yunfan’s retreating figure with all their might.

That figure was unhurried, step by step on the cold, black stone plaza. The sound of his footsteps was faint, yet like a heavy hammer striking Qi Hanfeng’s heart, each sound shattering the dignity he had left.

He himself was just an ant in the other’s eyes.

Xu Yunfan walked on, his expression as indifferent as ever, his heart without a single ripple.

As for the heroic words of ‘thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river,’ he found them laughable.

In the Primordial Dao Sect, a great vat soaked through with blood and conspiracy, such scenes of an ant spouting threats didn’t even count as a topic for after-dinner chat.

The masters of the few divine senses secretly watching were probably feeling quite bored by now.

Utterly worthless.

Xu Yunfan sneered in his heart, but he still very cautiously moved the finger behind his back, the one facing Qi Hanfeng. The movement was so small it was almost imperceptible.

*Crack!*

Under the illumination of his divine sense, an invisible ‘karmic thread,’ originally a rather thick, bluish-gray color, was instantly twisted and distorted by a vast, cold will.

In Xu Yunfan’s divine sense vision, the faint light representing profound fortune, opportunities, and destiny on Qi Hanfeng, which had originally been like a purple cloud canopy surging towards the heavens, was…
