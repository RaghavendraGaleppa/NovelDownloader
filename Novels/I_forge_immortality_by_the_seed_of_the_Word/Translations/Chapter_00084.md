# Chapter 83: Condensing a Mid-Grade Source Rune

On the other side.

Returning to his cave abode, Zhang Jing went straight to the cultivation chamber.

With a thought—


Ding-ding~

Accompanied by crisp, resonant chimes that echoed throughout the cave, the surging Five Treasures Spirit River slowly emerged from the void. Like a docile giant serpent, it coiled around Zhang Jing.

As soon as this peculiar spirit river appeared, it spontaneously began absorbing the dense spiritual energy within the cave.

But Zhang Jing paid no attention to this.

His gaze was fixed on the five magical instruments rotating and colliding within the river.

His identity jade pendant at his waist flickered.

In an instant, a handful of demon cores appeared in his palm.

Without hesitation, he tossed all of them into the Five Treasures Spirit River.

Within a few dozen breaths, the early Qi Refinement stage demon cores were completely crushed. A massive amount of heaven and earth spiritual energy instantly merged into the river water and, through the river's five-element cycle, was rapidly refined into extremely pure water-attribute spiritual energy.

As for the few mid-Qi Refinement stage demon cores, they trembled in the river as cracks began appearing on their surfaces. It seemed they wouldn't last much longer either.

Threads of pure spiritual energy slowly appeared within his body.

Zhang Jing closed his eyes.

In an instant, he entered a state of deep cultivation.

Due to the nature of the Submerged Dragon Devouring Void True Art, he couldn't be certain whether these demon cores would allow him to break through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement.

He could only try his best.

He thought again of the water-attribute demon core at the ninth level of Qi Refinement in his possession.

At his current mid-Qi Refinement stage, he couldn't withstand the terrifying amount of spiritual energy contained within that core.

Although the Five Treasures Spirit River's refining process mitigated the risk of being overwhelmed by the energy, it would still be a tremendous waste.

But once he reached the seventh level of Qi Refinement, he could attempt to refine and cultivate with that core using the Five Treasures Spirit River.

At that point, his cultivation would experience another leap forward from the seventh level foundation—perhaps even directly advancing to the eighth level of Qi Refinement.

Ten days later.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes in the cultivation chamber.

An extremely unstable aura radiated from his body, like a volcano on the verge of eruption.

A complex, indescribable look flashed through his eyes.

Just his luck—exactly what he feared had come to pass.

The pure spiritual energy provided by those demon cores hadn't been enough to push him directly to the seventh level of Qi Refinement.

Yet Zhang Jing wasn't disappointed.

He had now reached the absolute limit of the sixth level of Qi Refinement—just half a step away from the seventh level.

All he needed was one more water-attribute demon core or spiritual herb.

His cultivation would break through immediately.

But within his storage space...

Apart from that ninth-level Qi Refinement demon core, there was nothing else.

---

Presently, Zhang Jing was truly penniless.

Thinking this, he simply stopped cultivating and stood up, heading straight for the rune-crafting chamber.

What to do when you're out of resources?

The answer was simple: start printing.

Moreover, he wanted to see just how many runes he could produce in one go with his current cultivation at the peak of mid-Qi Refinement.

Time flowed steadily onward.

In the rune-crafting chamber.

The restless aura of imminent breakthrough that had surrounded Zhang Jing earlier had now calmed.

But beneath this calm surface...

His dantian's spiritual energy seethed more violently than ever.

The spiritual energy mist had been compressed to its limit.

Beads of liquefied spiritual energy the size of soybeans emitted a powerful yet restrained dangerous aura, as if they might break free from the mist at any moment to gather into a flowing stream below.

Zhang Jing stood at the threshold of late-stage Qi Refinement.

At the same time.

On the table before him.

As the final stroke of the runic pattern was completed...

A spiritual glow visible only to him suddenly flew out from the finished rune and plunged straight into a faint, incomplete source rune.

In that instant.

The final piece fell into place.

The mid-grade defensive rune—Lixing Rune's source rune—blazed with radiant light, instantly illuminating the entire rune-crafting chamber.

Huu—

Zhang Jing exhaled softly.

After two months...

Without neglecting his cultivation, he had finally succeeded in condensing the Lixing Rune's source rune.

His gaze unconsciously swept over the other incomplete mid-grade source runes.

The rest wouldn't take much longer either.

Zhang Jing collected the finished runes from the table, then walked leisurely toward the cave's exit.

With the source rune complete, the next step was mass-producing mid-grade runes.

But before that...

He needed to sell his current stock first.

Before the Luo Du team's resource repository.

Zhang Jing glanced up, then walked in with familiar ease.

Before long.

In a quiet chamber.

Zhang Jing deftly retrieved over eight hundred runes from his storage bag and placed them on the table.

The massive pile of runes, their auras interwoven, emitted an extraordinarily violent fluctuation of spiritual energy.

"Junior Sister Bai, this is all for now. Please verify the count."

"Understood, Senior Brother Steward."

The woman Zhang Jing addressed as 'Junior Sister Bai' responded respectfully before carefully beginning her inventory.

She felt no surprise whatsoever.

This steward senior brother would come periodically to sell top-quality runes—sometimes hundreds, other times over a thousand at once.

After experiencing shock after shock...

She had become completely numb to it.

Perhaps only if this senior brother steward came with just a few dozen runes like other runemasters would she feel surprised again, the woman mused.

Thanks to this senior brother...

The repository's stock of low-grade runes had piled mountain-high, with surplus flowing into various teams and the Thousand Methods Pavilion.

Otherwise, relying solely on the Luo Du team's cultivators—

They'd never sell them all. Never.

"Senior Brother, these are the water-attribute demon cores we've acquired."

It was the same junior sister as before handling the transaction.

Zhang Jing smiled as he accepted the jade box containing nineteen water-attribute demon cores. After thanking the junior sister, he turned to leave.

His steps carried a hint of urgency.

He couldn't wait to return to his cave abode.

They all said the transition from mid to late Qi Refinement marked a tremendous transformation for cultivators.

Now he would experience it firsthand.

Five days later.

Seventh floor of the Thousand Methods Pavilion.

Three violet-robed men faced each other.

In their hands, they each held one hundred Star Guidance Runes.

"Do you all concur?" one of them suddenly asked, his voice slightly hoarse.

"Senior Brother Yang Bai, there's no doubt about it!"

Another man took a deep breath and affirmed with certainty.

The astonishment on his face lingered, refusing to fade.

"Junior Brother Ou Wu's conclusion is clear. What about you, Junior Brother Qiu Xiuwen?" The first speaker—addressed as Senior Brother Yang Bai—turned his gaze to the third man.

"Reporting to Senior Brother, these one hundred Star Guidance Runes' patterns and spiritual energy are identical down to the smallest detail. Crucially, they weren't crafted in the same batch. Thus, this junior brother believes—they must have been printed from a source rune!"

Qiu Xiuwen answered respectfully.

"So both of you believe that youngster has successfully condensed a source rune?"

Yang Bai's tone revealed neither joy nor displeasure.

But the faint tremor at the corner of his eye betrayed emotions far less composed than his outward appearance.

"Without question."

Qiu Xiuwen confirmed firmly.

At this moment.

Tidal waves of shock surged uncontrollably in his heart.

Back then on the Azure Sky Spirit Crane, he had merely mentioned it casually to that junior brother Zhang Jing.

Who could have imagined the other party would take it seriously and actually choose the runecrafting path?

That alone would have been remarkable enough.

But now it appeared his offhand remark had been prophetic.

This junior brother didn't just have talent—his talent was monstrous!

A source rune—something only attempted at Foundation Establishment—yet this junior brother had condensed one at Qi Refinement!

Qiu Xiuwen understood all too well what this meant.

A top-tier candidate for Rune-Array Dao Foundation!

Why did their Thousand Methods Pavilion hold such transcendent status within the inner sect?

Precisely because their current chief disciple, Senior Brother You, possessed strength so formidable it earned him a place on the True Spirit Ranking.

And the Dao Foundation Senior Brother You had established?

A top-grade Rune-Array Dao Foundation.

"Junior Brother Qiu, since you've previously interacted with that youngster, I'll trouble you to go verify this matter."

Senior Brother Yang Bai's words interrupted Qiu Xiuwen's contemplation.

"This junior brother will go at once."

As the words fell.

Qiu Xiuwen turned and strode out without delay.
