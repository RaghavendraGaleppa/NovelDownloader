**Chapter 6: Dirt-Poor Nobody**

The next day, after completing his guard duty, Chen Fei went to find the alchemist at the medical hall.

"You want the Blood Qi Pill formula?" Zeng Defang looked at Chen Fei with some surprise.

"Is that possible?" Chen Fei asked, cupping his hands.

After a day of contemplation, Chen Fei had finally decided to try his hand at alchemy. After all, it was one of his original intentions for staying at the medical hall. As for medical arts, that was a complete system, and Chen Fei wasn't sure if the panel could simplify it. Even if it could, it would likely cost a huge sum, and Chen Fei was still short on money.

Therefore, alchemy seemed more suitable. If Chen Fei could learn to refine just one type of pill, he would have a relatively stable income. He could then seek out higher-level pills, forming a virtuous cycle.

"You're a guard at the medical hall; giving you a common Blood Qi Pill formula is no big deal."

Zeng Defang nodded. "But it's only the most common Blood Qi Pill formula; it doesn't include some of the medical hall's unique techniques. Furthermore, if you want to open a furnace and refine, you must buy the medicinal ingredients yourself. The medical hall won't provide them for free."

"I understand that," Chen Fei nodded. Before proving his alchemy skills, the medical hall wouldn't provide ingredients for free. And even if he proved capable of refining pills, they would still assess the quality and appearance of the final product. If it was too poor, the medical hall wouldn't accept it.

"Alright, take it. Just return it to me in three days."

Even if one isn't suited for this line of work, failing hundreds of times might still not grant entry. Alchemy, much like martial arts, greatly depends on an individual's innate talent. Sometimes you simply have it, and sometimes you don't.

[Alchemy: Blood Qi Pill (Uninitiated)]

A new entry appeared on the panel, and new simplification information flickered. A smile involuntarily appeared on Chen Fei's face, because simplifying the Blood Qi Pill only required one tael of silver.

Chen Fei chose the Blood Qi Pill as his first alchemy skill precisely because of its fundamental nature. The more basic a skill, the less silver required for simplification — this was an experience Chen Fei had recently discovered.

And though the Blood Qi Pill was basic, its demand was by no means small. Whether it was martial artists just starting their cultivation or those like Chen Fei in the Skin-Tempering Realm, the Blood Qi Pill offered excellent effects, invigorating blood qi and accelerating martial arts practice. Even those in the higher Flesh-Tempering Realm would occasionally purchase and consume Blood Qi Pills when financially strained; the effects were still present, though slightly weaker.

Therefore, if Chen Fei could refine Blood Qi Pills, he would never have to worry about selling them, as the martial artist community always had more people at the lower levels.

"Panel, simplify Blood Qi Pill!"

"He doesn't practice martial arts properly, yet he still dreams of becoming an alchemist. Is an alchemist something a dirt-poor nobody like him can aspire to be? Utterly preposterous."

At the dinner table, Pu Liao tossed a few peanuts into his mouth, his words filled with disdain for Chen Fei.

"Precisely because he was a dirt-poor nobody before, he's now desperately trying to climb when he sees an opportunity. What a pity; he doesn't realize that sometimes a dirt-poor nobody will truly remain a dirt-poor nobody for life," a companion said with a chuckle.

"I originally thought he might be sensible, and I wouldn't mind guiding him a bit. But he actually outright asked me for a secret manual. If we hadn't been in the medical hall at the time, I would've slapped him across the face," Pu Liao said coldly.

"Brother Pu has such good composure! If it were any of us, we probably couldn't have held back!"

"Enough about him, he's just a laughingstock."

Pu Liao waved his hand. "There will be plenty of ways to deal with him later. Does he really think that the secret manual I, Pu Liao, offered is so easy to accept?"
