# Chapter 17: Millennium Earth Pearl, Breakthrough in Strength

Early morning.  

The rising sun cast its myriad rays across the land.  

The hazy veil of night slowly dissipated as the world welcomed the light.  

Dou Changsheng leaned against the sturdy trunk of a tree, his legs crossed in meditation, with a three-foot-long sword resting on his lap.  

This sword, the Hero's Blade, measured three feet and three inches in length. Its blade was adorned with intricate golden diamond-shaped patterns, exuding an indescribable, profound charm.  

He took out a handkerchief and lightly touched the blade—the fabric instantly split in two.  

Such was the nature of a superior weapon.  

Though the term might sound unremarkable, this blade was truly extraordinary. In an ordinary world, it would be hailed as a divine weapon, passed down through generations and enshrined in countless legends—like the legendary Chixiao, Chengying, or Zhanlu.  

It could slice through iron as though it were mud and sever hair with a mere breath.  

But its true value lay not just in its sharpness. Such superior weapons had a special affinity for internal energy—be it inner qi, true qi, or primordial essence—enhancing their conduction. Not only did it minimize energy loss, but it also amplified the wielder's power.  

With his previous rusted sword, when Dou Changsheng channeled ten parts of innate qi, only seven or eight parts would manifest in his strikes.  

This was inevitable. Once innate qi left the body, every inch of distance increased its dissipation. The rusted sword, at least, served as a conduit—unlike techniques like qi barriers, which drained energy even faster.  

But with the Hero's Blade, ten parts of innate qi could unleash twelve parts of power.  

This was akin to divine martial arts. The innate qi refined through the *Triple Origin Reunion Art* could deliver tenfold power with less expenditure compared to ordinary techniques.  

The more Dou Changsheng admired it, the more he cherished it.  

In his past life, people coveted cars.  

In this life, warriors roamed the world, and a fine sword was the equivalent of a luxury vehicle.  

A superior weapon like this could easily be traded for a house. He owed a great debt for this favor.  

As Black Eagle Venerable approached, Dou Changsheng slowly sheathed the Hero's Blade.  

Black Eagle Venerable watched his movements and spoke calmly, "Blades and swords in this world are mostly forged from ordinary iron, which accounts for ninety-nine percent of all weapons."  

"Better ones incorporate refined steel, but they still fall within the realm of mundane weapons—though they are of decent quality."  

"The next tier is the superior weapon."  

"Superior weapons transcend the ordinary, possessing a faint spiritual nature. If one can attune to it and nurture its spirit, once the spirit grows strong enough, it can evolve into a treasure artifact."  

"A superior weapon is of extraordinary value. Tang He hails from Jiangdu in Southern Chen, a prominent southern clan. He was taken in as a disciple by the grand martial sect, the Heavenly Sword Sect, and was highly regarded by his family. Only then could he afford to bestow such an item."  

"An ordinary innate-level martial artist would never possess a superior weapon."  

Black Eagle Venerable slowly sat down, using the topic of the weapon as a segue before cutting to the main point.  

"Young Brother Dou has already escorted the military payroll to Sword Gate Pass and, despite the dangers, bravely raided the mountain village at night to rescue me and Zhao Manren."  

"Logically speaking, such a life-saving favor should not be followed by further requests."  

"But the current situation is unstable. Though life in the northern lands is harsh, at least there is no war."  

"As the ancients said, *Better a dog in times of peace than a man in times of chaos.*"  

"I implore Young Brother Dou to lend a hand in reclaiming the military payroll Zhao Manren lost."  

Dou Changsheng's sharp gaze fixed on Black Eagle Venerable. Late last night, he had deliberately steered the conversation toward a topic that would inevitably lead to disagreement—because he knew Black Eagle Venerable intended to reclaim the lost payroll.  

Seeing Dou Changsheng remain silent, Black Eagle Venerable continued, "During this brief rest, I performed a ritual to summon a messenger and successfully contacted the military headquarters."  

"The lost payroll is currently being transported to Chen Family Fort."  

"If we can intercept it before it arrives, there is still a chance to recover it."  

Dou Changsheng asked calmly, "What about their strength?"  

"My situation is no secret to you, Elder. My innate qi is slightly more abundant than most, but I only know a single sword technique. I cannot sustain prolonged battles. Against an ordinary innate-level martial artist, I can hold my own—but no more."  

Hearing this, Black Eagle Venerable knew Dou Changsheng had relented. Overjoyed, he replied, "The escort consists of only three innate-level martial artists."  

"With Zhao Manren and you, we can handle two of them. I will hold off the third—even if I cannot defeat him, I can stall him."  

"Once you secure the payroll, you can leave immediately. Zhao Manren and I will cover your retreat."  

Dou Changsheng pondered, "The three innate-level martial artists have already set out. Can we catch up?"  

Black Eagle Venerable replied confidently, "There is no need to worry. Just as they can certainly block us, we can certainly catch them."  

"You can trust the military headquarters on this."  

"Had Brother Tang not left, reclaiming the payroll would have been a certainty."  

He sighed before continuing, "The military headquarters also included rewards in their message."  

"Young Brother Dou knows the headquarters is financially strained and cannot offer priceless treasures. But after I explained your situation, they deliberated overnight and sent several martial arts manuals."  

"Young Brother Dou was born in the wilderness, chanced upon the *Triple Origin Reunion Art*, and thus embarked on the path of cultivation—without knowledge of any other martial techniques."  

"Now, you have learned the innate-level *Fearless Sword Art*, but you lack palm techniques, movement techniques, and more."  

"After discussion, the headquarters recognized that your innate qi is exceptionally abundant, and the *Fearless Sword Art* cannot fully utilize it. Thus, they have bestowed upon you the *Boundless Sword Scripture*."  

"This is an innate true-realm martial art, perfectly suited to you."  

"It emphasizes energy over form, using qi as the sword to overwhelm opponents with sheer force."  

"In addition, there is an innate movement technique—*Threefold Cloud Dragon Steps*—to compensate for your shortcomings."  

"If we succeed in reclaiming the payroll—no, even if we fail—the headquarters will dispatch a Three Flowers Gather at the Summit, innate profound-realm martial artist to personally guide you onto the true path of cultivation."  

Finally, Black Eagle Venerable reached into his ear and retrieved a pearl the size of a grain of rice. He presented it solemnly with both hands.  

"This is the Northern Ice Pearl."  

"Though not priceless, it is the most precious treasure I possess."  

"I offer it in gratitude for your life-saving kindness."  

Dou Changsheng did not hesitate. He accepted it with equal solemnity.  

"For the peace of the northern lands, even if the path ahead is fraught with peril..."  

"I would not hesitate to give my life!"
