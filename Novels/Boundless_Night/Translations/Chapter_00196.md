# Chapter 196: That's How Confident I Am

"For a snake to transform into a dragon, it must undergo a bloodied tempering, but this is a life-level elevation, a rebirth after tribulation, resulting in unmatched power and might."
Qin Ming thought of the various wonders of the *Snake Dragon Scripture*, feeling an intense longing for it, as if a hundred claws were scratching at his heart.
He felt that the current situation was very suitable for practicing the *Snake Dragon Scripture*.
"Brother, have you mastered your *Golden Cicada Scripture*?" Wu Yaozu asked in surprise.
He was suspicious. Was Brother Ming changing scriptures so quickly because he was fickle, or because his cultivation efficiency was terrifyingly high?!

"You've mastered all of them, and to perfection? Not too bad, I suppose." Tang Jin spoke.
Ling Yu knew that Senior Sister Tang had extremely high expectations of him, and to receive such an evaluation now was already a rare feat.
He realized that this time, he might finally be able to challenge the youths from Black-White Mountain.
As expected, Tang Jin, clad in black, made her decision.
She suddenly turned around, a lock of hair fluttering from the side of her radiant and exquisitely flawless face. "Then get ready," she said.
Ling Yu was invigorated. He had been suppressing himself for days, waiting for this moment for a long time.
Tang Jin stood tall and elegant, taller than many men. She took a few steps around the room and said, "Don't disgrace me. Master Wu has been complaining, blaming me for not choosing that person, and this time he even made a bet with me."
Upon hearing this, Ling Yu clenched his fists, his fighting spirit instantly soaring. Master Wu didn't think highly of him? Then he would win to show him!

The night sky was like an abyss, yet at this moment, someone stood high above the firmament.
Sun Taichu stood on a dark cloud, his hands clasped behind his back, and declared, "Wind and clouds rise from the heavens, dragons and serpents emerge from the land. Kunling is becoming increasingly lively, with people from all sides arriving. That plateau will be stained red with blood."
This was his Pure Yang consciousness spirit-light, no longer as dazzling as a blazing sun. Now it was identical to his true body, as he strolled through the dark mists.
He turned his head and asked, "Will Cao Qianqiu come?"
Pu Heng, who was following behind, replied, "My teacher will arrive."
Currently, Kunling City saw new arrivals daily. Everyone craved the blood of the Auspicious Beast, even the patriarchs of various sects coveted it.
That plateau had already been sealed off. The Auspicious Beast, vast as a mountain, had long been targeted.
However, it was not alone. It had called upon its friends, dispatching strange birds to seek aid from other regions, even planning to retaliate and kill everyone near Kunling.
Recently, some unfathomable demonic entities had appeared, making the plateau outside the Third Forbidden Zone increasingly dangerous. Terrifying demonic winds often howled through the night, stirring up a sky full of clouds and mist.

A burly youth entered Kunling City. His palms were as large as cattail-leaf fans, his legs thick as pillars, his head as big as a basin, his black hair stiff as steel needles, and he had thick eyebrows, large eyes, a broad mouth, and a square nose.
His stature was so immense, his appearance truly unique. One look and he seemed like an "Anomalous One"!
In fact, even an Anomalous One standing before him would seem less anomalous. He was none other than the "Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata"—Xiang Yiwu, who had also appeared in this place.
"Hmm?!" Li Qingxu spotted him from a distant tall tower.
Xiang Yiwu sensed it, suddenly turned, gazed towards the tall tower area of the Soaring Immortal Academy, and grinned, completely unconcerned about being spied upon.
"Should we deal with him?" a middle-aged man beside Li Qingxu asked.
Li Qingxu's expression was not pleasant. He recalled how, in the past, he had struck the Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata with a staff, only for the other party to return two slaps, causing him to vomit blood.
The key was that their ages were similar, yet the other party was a "Newborn," and after reaching the Outer Saint realm, his cultivation level had surprisingly not fallen behind Li Qingxu's, which was quite astonishing!
"Don't act rashly," Li Qingxu shook his head. Everyone said this was someone raised loosely by the Tathagata lineage, almost an abandoned disciple.
But some analysts believed this was likely one of the old fogeys of that lineage's highly valued individuals. If one were to harm him with insidious means, they might be repaid tenfold.
Similar incidents had occurred in the past.
That was five hundred years ago, provoking the contemporary Tathagata himself to act and blast many people into oblivion.

"Cousin, are you serious? During my seclusion, my brother Qin Ming has mysteriously risen, and he's very strong now?" Ning Siqi asked, skeptical.
He wore white robes year-round, had a slight obsession with cleanliness, and had also arrived in the Kunling region.
When many people avoided Qin Ming and distanced themselves from him, Ning Siqi had traveled thousands of miles to deliver the incredibly precious *Lihuo Scripture* to him.
"Only a few people know," Wang Caiwei nodded.
She then sighed, "It's a pity, he's taking the Newborn Path. His cultivation speed will suddenly slow down later, and he won't be able to keep up with the others. Otherwise, judging by his previous performance, as long as they were in the same realm, he might have been able to contend with Near-Immortal Seeds."
"Alas, there's nothing to be done," Ning Siqi sighed. The Newborn Path had significant problems that no one could change, not even the patriarchs.
He then added, "I only hope he can eventually endure and become a patriarch-level figure."
Wang Caiwei, clad in black, said, "I don't know if he will appear here, but for him, this area is too dangerous."
Ning Siqi lamented, "I haven't seen him in a long time. Who knows when we brothers can reunite again."
This time, youths with some foundation from the Immortal Path and Esoteric Sect Path had all arrived.
For example, Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan also appeared.
Both felt uneasy. The past few months had been truly cursed. Every time they explored ruins for opportunities, they would inexplicably get beaten, with bones broken and tendons snapped. Surely this time wouldn't be the same, would it?

"Brother, we've already entered four academies in succession," Wu Yaozu said, sounding skeptical. Was there really a need to continue?
"Yes!" Qin Ming nodded. "We'll sign up and take the assessments. We don't necessarily have to truly join in the end."
It was enrollment season, and school hadn't officially started yet. Qin Ming, coveting the unique cultivation methods of various academies, naturally intended to visit all of them and establish an identity.
Jin Xiang, pulling the nanmu carriage, ran ahead and said, "Junior Brothers, you two truly have spirit. Back in my day, Old Sheep's generation never had students like you. Do you plan to be registered at all the major academies?"
This Senior Brother from the Mountain River Academy, with his brilliant golden fur, was very talkative. He had been hired for the day and offered advice to the two on the road, explaining the pros and cons of the major daoist academies and institutions.
Ultimately, Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu successively passed the trials of six institutions, including Origin Academy and Dragon Elephant Daoist Temple, before temporarily stopping.
Qin Ming had learned that these six institutions had very deep foundations, having accumulated a series of renowned unique cultivation methods, which greatly interested him.

Little Wu was also quite satisfied; he also needed unique cultivation methods. The main problem with his Path of Rainbow Transformation was that it viewed the body as a cage, eventually requiring him to abandon his "stinking flesh." Currently, he was actively tempering his physical body.
"Junior Brothers, next time you need a carriage, call me again. I'll give you a discount," Jin Xiang said as he turned to leave. For twenty years, he had persistently walked the Path of Mortal World Heart-Tempering.
"Senior Brother, we await your rise in the mortal world, to become a god someday!" Little Wu waved.
Jin Xiang shook his head and said, "Alas, heart-tempering in the mortal world is so difficult. My very first step tempered away my beloved."
Little Wu asked, "Ah, you killed her?"
"No, I was tempering my heart, and she got married," Jin Xiang said as he walked away, the scent of the city's mortal dust filling his nostrils with every breath.

As soon as Qin Ming and Little Wu returned to their residence at Mountain River Academy, someone came looking for them.
"Are you Shen Wubing?" This was a senior student from the academy, seemingly quite famous, named Tang Jun.
"I am. What is it?" Qin Ming asked.
Tang Jun smiled and said, "Well, there are some exchange meetings in the academy that might involve sparring and contests. Winners can receive 'day-gold.' I was wondering if you two would be willing to participate?"
"How much day-gold for winning a match?" Little Wu's interest was piqued because Brother Ming spent money like water. Just learning a few pages of the *Golden Cicada Scripture* had cost six hundred day-gold, and he was about to go broke again.
"Ten day-gold," Tang Jun said.
Little Wu was delighted, just about to say: For the same realm, arrange a hundred matches for me!
However, he saw Brother Ming remain unmoved, sitting there calmly. He quieted down too. After some thought, he said, "We don't know you. Why are you seeking us out? Who sent you? Could it be a former defeated opponent?"
He felt he had deduced the truth and said, "Tell them to prepare a thousand..."
Little Wu paused, looked at Qin Ming, and asked, "Brother, how much should they prepare, two thousand day-gold?"
Qin Ming shook his head and said, "We're not competing with them."
Little Wu immediately understood. "Right, we're not participating. You can leave. Who are you looking down on? Only ten day-gold right off the bat, it infuriates me!"
Tang Jun's expression changed slightly. He had thought one of the youths was quite naive, but then he saw him visibly improving, dismissive of him.
He quickly said, "Junior Brothers, don't misunderstand. Let's talk properly."
Neither of them paid him any attention.
Tang Jun said, "Junior Brothers, I swear, I won't make any commission. This time, I truly was entrusted by someone... I'm really sorry about earlier."
Wu Yaozu said, "Even if the real boss came, we might not agree."
Tang Jun found that these two were remarkably composed. They went fishing for Dragon Carp by the lake, an open violation of rules, yet they weren't afraid of him reporting them.
Finally, he was helpless. He turned and left, reporting the result to the main party.

Ling Yu came in person, getting straight to the point, wanting to spar with Qin Ming.
Wu Yaozu glanced at him. "Why should my brother fight you? You're already a defeated opponent; you'll carry that loss for life."
Ling Yu had been quite calm, but upon hearing this, his chest instantly tightened. He retorted, "That was a sneak attack! I didn't lose."
"You can leave!" Little Wu waved him off.
"How about a thousand day-gold for one match?" Ling Yu had learned from Tang Jun that these two likely had a significant need for day-gold.
Little Wu said, "Are you trying to fob off a beggar? My brother earned over a thousand day-gold with just one palm strike last time. Do you mean this time he only needs one palm strike too?"
Ling Yu's veins almost popped out on his forehead. He really wanted to say: Was that *your* day-gold? You *stole* it from my pocket!
At the same time, the back of his head started to ache again.
He thought that this seemingly simple youth was not simple at all!
He came to his senses. This guy was saying he wouldn't fight him, yet every sentence provoked him, mentioning defeats and single slaps. Was he trying to inflate the price?
"What exactly do you want?" Ling Yu asked in a heavy voice.
Little Wu said, "My brother is short on unique cultivation methods and needs a *Snake Dragon Scripture*. I'm working on self-preservation and need a secret scripture for the body to control the soul. Also, we're not well off; we already owe ten thousand day-gold externally, you understand?"
Ling Yu clenched his fists, wanting to rush over and fight them directly, because this was truly an exorbitant demand!
Wu Yaozu waved his hand. "Don't be unconvinced. Let me explain the math to you. You fought Xin Youdao, and it was the focus of widespread attention, so you must have gotten a lot of dividends, right? You're hailed as a Young Ancestor, but both you and Xin Youdao are defeated opponents of me and my brother. If my brother and I revealed ourselves and fought a match, how much do you think the dividends would be?"
"I didn't lose!" Ling Yu corrected him.
"Then go, and forever carry that unresolved issue in your heart," Little Wu flicked his rod, cast his line, and continued fishing, ignoring him.
Ling Yu turned and left, because these two demanded prices that were too exorbitant, too dark. He couldn't make the decision on his own, but he desperately wanted to fight.

Finally, Tang Jin appeared, clad in black, elegant and graceful, her dark hair fluttering in the wind, her exquisitely flawless oval face cold and stunningly beautiful.
Because Lu Zizai had given a heads-up, Qin Ming, even knowing she had discovered who he was and understanding her profound cultivation, was not intimidated.
"Miss Tang, we meet again." Qin Ming put down his fishing rod and stood up with a smile.
"I wouldn't have guessed. A youth as gentle as jade would make such exorbitant demands," Tang Jin said. Her figure was slender, her waist lithe, swaying gracefully as she walked.
Qin Ming remained calm. Since he had revealed himself in front of her, he naturally wouldn't be low-key anymore. "Actually, my brother asked for too little. He's too simple."
Beside him, Ling Yu clenched his fists upon hearing this. *Too simple*?!
Qin Ming had his own estimation. Even a Young Ancestor received considerable dividends from such widely watched matches. If he were to act, how could the price be too low?
Tang Jin spoke indifferently, "Since you want such a large wager, what can you offer if you lose?"
"Two unique cultivation methods!" Qin Ming said.
Tang Jin smiled through her cold beauty, the frost melting in an instant, revealing a truly radiant expression. "Very confident, aren't you?"
Qin Ming nodded. "Indeed, I've always been confident. In fact, I'd rather spar with Miss Tang herself in the First Realm, if that's possible?"
