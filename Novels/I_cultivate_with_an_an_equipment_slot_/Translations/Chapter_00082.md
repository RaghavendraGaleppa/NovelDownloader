# Chapter 82: The Synergy of Two Divine Abilities

The power of divine abilities undoubtedly surpasses that of ordinary spells—this is an indisputable truth. Therefore, the might of "Spiritual Qi Manifestation as Swords" naturally exceeds that of the "Sword Nurturing Art." Moreover, Zhang Yanchun had learned that "Spiritual Qi Manifestation as Swords" was actually an advanced form of the "Sword Nurturing Art."

Because of this divine ability, Zhang Yan began to formulate new plans. Although the flying swords he conjured through "Spiritual Qi Manifestation as Swords" were incredibly tiny—no longer than a finger and exceedingly slender—this very characteristic made them all the more practical. After all, their essence was that of a divine ability. If spells were akin to wood, then divine abilities were like steel. With the same amount of spiritual energy, the power of a divine ability would always be greater.

Additionally, due to their small size, Zhang Yan's Sword Nurturing Gourd could hold far more of these manifested swords. Though diminutive, these swords were more potent and stealthier, making them perfect for surprise attacks—like hidden weapons. The thought alone excited him.

But that wasn't all. Zhang Yan recalled another divine ability he possessed: "Scattering Beans to Form Soldiers." He took out a spiritual seed, flicked it lightly, and instantly, a small bean soldier materialized on the ground. The figure appeared somewhat wooden, much like Mu Sen, but it could understand and execute basic commands.

"Spiritual Qi Manifestation as Swords!" Zhang Yan murmured again, extending his hand as a translucent flying sword appeared between his fingers. "Go!" With a light tap, the sword flew straight toward the bean soldier. "Try it," Zhang Yan instructed. Without hesitation, the bean soldier grasped the sword formed from spiritual energy.

"Now, let's test your strength." Zhang Yan conjured another manifested sword and launched it at the bean soldier. "Swish!" His attack was swift, but the bean soldier reacted just as quickly, raising its sword to block. As Zhang Yan continued to control the flying swords, the bean soldier managed to fend them off, albeit barely.

"Impressive!" Zhang Yan was pleased with the bean soldier's performance. It was clear that the synergy between these two divine abilities produced results greater than the sum of their parts. "I haven't explored the full potential of these spells yet. I need to delve deeper," he mused.

With the bean soldiers and manifested swords at his disposal, Zhang Yan felt his strength had ascended to another level. At that moment, he believed himself to be formidable—until he heard the voices of his senior brothers outside and remembered the presence of his grandmaster. Instantly, his youthful arrogance faded. As powerful as he might be, others were still far stronger. With this sobering thought, he calmed his mind and resolved to continue cultivating diligently.

Three months later, Zhang Yan had made significant progress in his "Thunderflame Body Forging Technique," noticeably enhancing his physical strength. His "Sword Nurturing Art" had also reached the beginner stage, and though his cultivation remained at the seventh level of Qi Refinement, he was on the verge of breaking through to the eighth. Notably, thanks to the abundance of spiritual fish he had consumed over these months, the bottleneck between the seventh and eighth levels had loosened considerably. A few more attempts, and he would surely advance.

Those spiritual fish were truly extraordinary!

Just as Zhang Yan was about to resume his training, the voice of his grandmaster called out to him. Without hesitation, he obediently made his way to the grandmaster's quarters. After knocking lightly and receiving permission, he entered and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Grandmaster." Only then did he notice that Mo Changqing was also present, though the sect leader's expression was unusually grim.

"Sect Leader? What brings you here?" Zhang Yan asked curiously. 

"The sect leader has come to discuss something with you. You two may speak privately," the grandmaster said, dismissing them.

Once outside, Zhang Yan turned to Mo Changqing. "What's the matter, Sect Leader?"

"The situation isn't good," Mo Changqing replied with a troubled expression. "The Clearheart Lotus you left with the sect has been struggling to thrive. I feared it might deteriorate further, so I brought it to you." 

He produced the lotus, which, after three months, showed no signs of growth and even appeared somewhat withered. 

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it," Zhang Yan reassured him with a smile. The sect's inability to nurture the lotus wasn't surprising—Clearheart Lotuses were notoriously difficult to cultivate. Zhang Yan had only succeeded due to the "Flower Grafting Secret Art" from the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace. Without knowledge of this technique, the sect's herbalists would naturally struggle. But for Zhang Yan, reviving the lotus posed no challenge.

"Good. If you can restore it, then I'll leave it in your care," Mo Changqing said, relieved. The sect's priority was ensuring the lotus remained within their domain, regardless of who nurtured it. 

After resolving the lotus issue, Zhang Yan broached another topic with Mo Changqing: he requested assistance in gathering spiritual materials to enhance his Metal and Water spiritual roots. Ideally, he hoped to balance all five elemental roots.

"These resources are rare, but I'll do my best to locate them," Mo Changqing replied without probing into Zhang Yan's intentions. Every cultivator had their secrets, and as sect leader, he respected that.

Once Mo Changqing departed, Zhang Yan first revived the Clearheart Lotus before resuming his cultivation.

Two more months passed before another visitor arrived—Lei Kunhai. The burly man got straight to the point: "Two things. First, I want to assess your progress in artifact forging. Second, the sect leader asked me to deliver some items."

"My Thunderflame Body Forging Technique has reached the minor achievement stage. I should now be able to forge low-grade artifacts with ease," Zhang Yan replied.

"Low-grade artifacts? Have you attempted mid-grade ones?"

"Not yet. There's no earthfire here to facilitate the process."

"Who said you need earthfire to forge artifacts?!" Lei Kunhai boomed. "I'll provide you with a forging furnace and spiritual charcoal. Keep practicing—artifact forging must not be neglected!"
