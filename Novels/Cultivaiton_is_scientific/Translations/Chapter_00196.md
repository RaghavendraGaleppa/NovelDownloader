# Chapter 196: News

"Chu Gang of the Thousand Illusions Sect greets you, Senior. May I ask your purpose for visiting the Tang Imperial Palace?" An elderly late-stage Qi Cultivation realm cultivator flew over on a magical instrument, bowing respectfully yet maintaining an air of dignity before Li Shiming.

The bearing of a major sect disciple was evident in Chu Gang's demeanor. Despite being only at the late Qi Cultivation stage, he showed no trace of fear or anxiety when facing Li Shiming, an early Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Is this territory of the Thousand Illusions Sect?" Li Shiming murmured in slight surprise, having previously heard that the Thousand Illusions Sect bordered the Netherworld Sect. However, after seeing the tens of thousands of miles of defensive lines separating the Hundred Thousand Mountains from the outside world, he realized the Thousand Illusions Sect wasn't the only one adjacent to the Netherworld Sect.

Hearing Li Shiming's muttering, Chu Gang's eyes flickered with understanding. He guessed this must be a cultivator from afar, unfamiliar with local geography.

"I'd like to purchase a map. Could you accommodate me?" Li Shiming asked with a smile.

Chu Gang relaxed slightly. Li Shiming's politeness suggested he wasn't a demonic cultivator—they rarely showed courtesy to Qi cultivators. 

"You needn't purchase one, Senior. I happen to have a map here, though it only covers territories of the Thousand Illusions Sect, Shu Mountain Sect, and Thousand Leaves Temple. My apologies for the limitation." Chu Gang produced a jade slip and offered it.

"My thanks." Not one to take advantage, Li Shiming handed over four hundred spirit stones in return.

Chu Gang accepted the payment with another bow. Four hundred stones weren't extravagant, but represented decent earnings for a Qi cultivator.

"Actually, Fellow Daoist Chu, I have another request. I'd like to send a letter to one of your sect members—cultivator Yin Shilan." Li Shiming added.

Chu Gang was surprised. Though unfamiliar with their territory, this outsider knew one of their disciples? Delivering messages was standard duty for stationed cultivators, often handling communications between cultivators and their mortal relatives.

Li Shiming took out another jade slip, pressing it to his forehead to record a message informing Yin Shilan of his arrival in Northern Shu and his dilemma about joining either the Shu Mountain or Thousand Illusions Sect. He concealed nothing from her—there was no need.

"Here's compensation. How long will delivery take?" He also offered a bottle of Qi Cultivation aid pills.

Chu Gang examined the unfamiliar pills—clearly from the Hundred Thousand Mountains region—and couldn't hide his delight. For cultivators nearing the end of their lifespans stationed in mortal realms to accumulate resources, such novel pills were precious. Repeated use of standard pills built resistance, diminishing effects to less than ten percent potency. These foreign variants would provide significantly better results.

"I'll use the emergency channel—three days at most!" Chu Gang promised, gripping the bottle.

"Then I'll stay here a few days. Might you provide lodging?" 

"Of course! If you don't mind my humble courtyard's sparse spiritual energy, you're welcome there." The generous payment made Chu Gang exceptionally accommodating.

Li Shiming followed Chu Gang into a small palace courtyard where spiritual energy was slightly richer, though insufficient for Foundation Establishment cultivation. Staying here would deplete Chu Gang's resources.

After settling Li Shiming in, Chu Gang hurried to dispatch the message. In the backyard, he summoned a spirit bird, placing the jade slip in a bamboo tube attached to its leg. Before release, he needed Yin Shilan's sect status and residence. Activating a long-distance communication array, he queried the sect.

The reply startled him—Yin Shilan was a new disciple, but as a Foundation Establishment core disciple and apprentice to a formation master, her status was formidable. Handling the spirit bird with newfound care, he bribed it with favorite treats, emphasizing the mission's importance.

At Thousand Illusions Sect's main peak, a slender figure with willow-like waist stood gazing northward—toward Heavenly Sea Sect's direction. Over a year since arriving, Yin Shilan's quiet longing for Li Shiming remained undiminished, as constant as during her Heavenly Sea Sect days.

Her routine differed little—cultivation and formation studies filled her days. The absence of family and Li Shiming left her without confidants. Thanks to Master Luo's protection, she faced no troubles, though admirers retreated before her icy demeanor.

"Junior Sister Yin!" A female voice interrupted her reverie. Turning, she smiled at the red-robed cultivator—Liang Yexuan, a fellow core disciple and daughter of a Golden Core elder. Though younger, Yin Shilan's later enrollment made her the junior.

Liang Yexuan had been thrilled to finally have someone to call "junior sister." Their similar age and status quickly fostered friendship.

"Sister Liang, why the hurry?" Yin Shilan steadied the breathless girl.

"That Zhang fellow keeps pestering me! So annoying!" Liang Yexuan complained, explaining how the senior sought connections through her father.

Yin Shilan advised ignoring him, having avoided similar attention by rarely leaving her quarters. 

Suddenly, her identity jade transmitted a notification—a spirit bird had arrived with a letter. Heart racing, she retrieved the jade slip, eyes widening with joy at Li Shiming's message. He was in Tang Kingdom!

"I'm leaving the sect!" she announced, unable to conceal her excitement.

"Shouldn't you contact him through the sect array first?" Liang Yexuan suggested, curiosity burning. She'd stake her twenty years of life experience this involved a man—what kind could move the aloof fairy-like Yin Shilan?

The reminder brought clarity. Yin Shilan activated the Tang Kingdom communication array.

---

Chu Gang received the transmission. "Is Li Shiming there?" trembled a melodious voice.

"Senior Aunt Yin, he's staying at the palace. Shall I summon him?"

"Tell him to wait! I'm coming—don't let him leave!" The connection severed abruptly.

Chu Gang grimaced—how could a Qi cultivator stop a Foundation Establishment expert if he chose to leave?

Meanwhile, Yin Shilan boarded a flying boat, only for Liang Yexuan to join. 

"I'm accompanying you—it's unsafe alone!" Liang Yexuan insisted, linking arms. Yin Shilan didn't argue, driving the boat at breakneck speed until her spiritual energy nearly depleted.

"Junior Sister, is Li Shiming your lover?" Liang Yexuan suddenly asked, watching Yin Shilan blush furiously. "Did he cross the North Sea from Heavenly Sea Island? But how? That's impossible for Qi cultivators! To brave such dangers for love—how romantic!" Her excitement grew with each speculation.

Liang Yexuan joined powering the boat. With two Foundation Establishment cultivators driving, they reached Tang capital in under thirty hours.

Notified of their arrival, an agitated Li Shiming waited atop the palace roof. A green flying boat appeared—its concealment spell useless against his perception. 

Unable to wait, he shot skyward as a sword ray, meeting the descending vessel. There she stood—the celestial figure etched in his memories through countless recollections.
