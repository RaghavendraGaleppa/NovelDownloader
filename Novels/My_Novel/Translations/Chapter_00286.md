# Chapter 286: The Residual Demon Spear Art, a Recommendation from the Candle Teaching, Peril in the South Palace, and the Twin Pupils Suppressing Ghosts

The fragrance of flowers filled the air, and the greenery was lush.

It was the height of summer, midday, with the scorching sun overhead, making the heat unbearable.

After leaving the small town, Li Xian headed straight for the inner island. Along the way, he saw fellow disciples of the Flower Cage Sect, gathered in small groups, chatting and laughing, their conversation filled with bawdy jokes. Seeing the intense sunlight, they钻进 the woods to cool off under the shade. Li Xian moved with the Seven Star Step, his figure leaping and weaving through the trees. Upon arriving at the inner island, the disciples there recognized Li Xian and greeted him with smiles and respectful salutations.

Li Xian smiled back and headed southeast. Soon, he reached his destination.

The Martial Inquiry Pavilion housed exquisite martial arts techniques, and Deputy Chief Envoy Yan Hao resided within.

The pavilion stood seven zhang high, with a black roof and crimson walls, exuding solemn dignity. It was said that the walls were built from dark lake obsidian, making them as unbreakable and heavy as a mountain. As Li Xian entered the building, he felt the unique layout.

The pavilion contained "Basic Martial Arts," "Low-Grade Martial Arts," and "Mid-Grade Martial Arts." "High-Grade Martial Arts" were extremely rare; noble families and famous sects kept them as secrets, usually passed down orally or taught personally, never recorded in manuals for sale.

Even if recorded, they would be incomplete. Basic Martial Arts required over a hundred merit copper coins, while Low-Grade Martial Arts required a few taels of merit silver... The Martial Inquiry Pavilion contained both the sect's essential techniques and external martial arts.

The collection of books and manuals was vast. Guided by instructions, Li Xian went straight to a pavilion room, carefully observing the recorded martial arts. He already had a direction in mind, but the opportunity to peruse martial arts manuals was rare, so he cherished it and read the records meticulously.

The books on the shelves had been specially treated; the introductory and preface pages could be read without issue. However, if one擅自 turned the pages further, attempting to peek at the true essence of the martial arts, it would cause mental confusion and chaos.

The Flower Cage Sect had a loose structure, with disciples from all walks of life, and its martial arts manuals were scattered. Styles and martial arts combinations needed to be assembled by oneself. Ordinary disciples who wanted guidance had to flatter and please the elders.

Li Xian chose two martial arts that seemed quite compatible: "Serpent's Intestine Circuit Sword" and "Soft Scale Swimming Body Technique."

He had deliberated carefully. While martial arts covering fists, palms, kicks, fingers, knives, and swords had reached their peak, covering too broad a range could lead to a lack of focus. He wanted to encompass the four seas, develop comprehensively, master everything, and become an expert like Wen CaiShang. However, resources were limited. When faced with a rare opportunity, he had to first perfect his swordsmanship to show his edge. Only after achieving considerable skill would he slowly make up for his shortcomings.

Given his limited resources, Li Xian understood the priorities, making his choice of martial arts clear.

"Serpent's Intestine Circuit Sword" required three taels of merit silver, and "Soft Scale Swimming Body Technique" required two taels... Thanks to Shi YuFei's promise, "Serpent's Intestine Circuit Sword" could be purchased at a low price, costing only one tael of merit silver. The Soft Scale Swimming Body Technique was worth two taels, which allowed him to acquire both Low-Grade martial arts at once.

Once he perfected these two sets of martial arts, he could perceive the heavens and earth during practice, promoting the digestion of spiritual treasures and nurturing his internal energy... The benefits were infinite. A martial artist's profound strength is accumulated this way.

Li Xian browsed for a while longer, his mind drifting, filled with longing. He coveted many martial arts, wishing he could practice them all and perfect them. Immersed in the vast ocean of martial arts, when he came back to his senses, it was already dusk. He prepared to leave the pavilion and return to his room. After walking for a moment along the path, he suddenly saw a staircase leading to the third floor.

Li Xian thought: "The Martial Inquiry Pavilion is a key place in the Water Altar, but the defenses are minimal. Only a few servants are responsible for guiding the way, seemingly without restrictions on where one goes. This staircase leads to the third floor. The second floor houses Low-Grade martial arts, and the third floor would be Mid-Grade. Although with my current merit silver, exchanging for a Mid-Grade martial art is pure fantasy, going upstairs to broaden my horizons can't hurt."

He went upstairs without any obstruction. This place stored Mid-Grade martial arts, but to Li Xian's surprise, there were no shelves for books. Instead, there were various strange items: a silver wine cup, a broken jade, a snake's shed scales... extremely peculiar. He could also see a bronze vat, inside which fish swam and played.

Li Xian muttered: "Did I come to the wrong place? There are no martial arts books here."

He walked to the water vat to admire the fish inside. Not daring to touch anything randomly, he just watched quietly. After getting tired of watching, he went to admire other places. He even saw leftovers from a meal and a broken skull, these strange objects were all stored in glass boxes, visible but not touchable.

Suddenly, footsteps were heard. Yan Hao, wearing a loose robe, walked slowly towards him.

Li Xian bowed and said: "Deputy Chief Envoy." Yan Hao nodded and said: "I noticed you came to pick martial arts early on. You have a steady temperament; you looked for hours. How come... aren't you afraid of going berserk?"

Li Xian smiled and said: "Can one go berserk just by looking at martial arts?"

Yan Hao said: "Naturally. Those with weak willpower, immersed in martial arts manuals, will be haunted by them, unable to sleep due to longing for the miraculous effects recorded, leading to reversed blood flow and going berserk... This is quite common."

Li Xian said: "That's truly dangerous."

Yan Hao smiled: "You were able to reach the third floor, which shows your mind is clear, so you don't need to worry."

Li Xian asked curiously: "Why?"

Yan Hao said proudly: "If your mind were confused, the pavilion's layout would guide you. Every step you take would be within my calculations. In this way, whether you walk hundreds of steps east or west, you would eventually fall into that pool for a refreshing cool-down. It would be unavoidable for you to become a drowned rat." He pushed open a window, pointing to the lotus pond beside the pavilion.

It turned out the pavilion's layout was ingenious, with hidden paths that changed constantly. A single path could have hundreds of variations. If Yan Hao wanted to trap an enemy, the opponent had no choice but to surrender.

Li Xian felt this was wonderfully clever, a similar subtlety he had experienced on the flower boat. He smiled: "Then, since this junior was able to reach the third floor, it must be because Deputy Chief Envoy Yan intentionally guided me."

Yan Hao was slightly surprised, smiled without speaking, and looked at Li Xian carefully. After a while, he said: "You are quite clever. Since you are here, it's fine to look around."

Li Xian looked around and asked curiously: "This junior has had a question since earlier. I would like to ask Deputy Chief Envoy Yan for an explanation." He said: "This junior is ignorant. The many items displayed here seem more like a museum. I haven't seen any martial arts manuals at all. Is this really where martial arts manuals are stored?"

He suspected that the martial arts manuals were definitely hidden within these strange items. By pretending to be naive, he aimed to start a conversation, making it easier to inquire in detail and explore the secrets within.

Yan Hao said: "Naturally. There are thirty-four Mid-Grade martial arts techniques here."

Li Xian said curiously: "Do you mean these strange items?"

Yan Hao smiled: "Exactly. Mid-Grade martial arts are no longer confined to paper and books. The carriers are all sorts of strange objects. As the saying goes, when looking at a mountain, it is not a mountain; when looking at water, it is not water. When one's perception of martial arts reaches a high level, what one sees, hears, observes, and thinks becomes different from others."

Yan Hao became talkative, intending to lead Li Xian to see the various items on the third floor and briefly explain the martial arts contained within.

Li Xian followed slightly behind Yan Hao, observing the third floor. Through their casual conversation, Li Xian understood the marvels of the Martial Inquiry Pavilion and why Yan Hao was stationed there long-term. The pavilion housed many martial arts manuals and was extremely important, requiring a guard. However, anyone guarding it would be unsuitable, inevitably suspected of "guarding the vault to steal from it" or secretly learning the martial arts.

Yan Hao had no interest in martial arts. Although his cultivation was not shallow, his combat effectiveness was questionable; he practiced only health-preserving and life-extending techniques. His lifelong interest and spare time were all devoted to strange formations and the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams. The Martial Inquiry Pavilion he designed, even if Hao QingShe broke in, would be trapped.

He guarded the Martial Inquiry Pavilion but was too lazy to touch the martial arts manuals. This made him extremely suitable.

The "leftovers" seen earlier contained the "Devouring Residue Art." The "fish in the vat" contained the "Overturning Water Fish Walking Step." The "shed snake skin" contained the "Shedding Scale Sky-Shaking Roar"... Thirty-four strange items, thirty-four Mid-Grade martial arts.

As for how to obtain the martial arts from these peculiar items, Yan Hao did not say. After strolling around, the sky had darkened, the setting sun retreated westward, and its afterglow spilled across the lake surface.

Yan Hao smiled: "How is it? Any thoughts?"

Li Xian said vaguely: "The talent of the sages is admirable. If I could obtain even one, it would be a blessing from heaven."

Yan Hao said: "Indeed. If I remember correctly, you won the championship at the grand gathering and received a reward of three taels of merit silver?" Li Xian said: "Yes."

Yan Hao said: "Chief Envoy Shi told me that you were frightened at the gathering. That villainess Hao QingShe acted recklessly and increasingly without restraint. As compensation, you are allowed to purchase one martial art at a thirty percent discount. He mentioned this to me early on. I've been wondering lately why you haven't come to purchase a martial art. If you haven't forgotten, but I have, then this verbal promise would be in vain."

Li Xian said sheepishly: "This... is indeed this junior's oversight. I didn't expect Deputy Chief Envoy to remember." Yan Hao said: "You came before I forgot, so the verbal promise naturally stands. In that case... there is one Mid-Grade martial art you might be able to try."

Li Xian was surprised: "Oh?" The thirty-four martial arts all required over forty taels of merit silver. Even at a thirty percent discount, it was far beyond Li Xian's reach. Even ordinary elders would find it hard to touch. Yan Hao said: "There is a thirty-fifth Mid-Grade martial art here."

He said, then walked towards a sealed box. Undoing a hidden latch, he revealed a damaged painting. It had been burned by fire, leaving only a corner. Yan Hao said: "Look." He handed the painting over.

The damaged painting had a dark tone, looking like spilled black ink had obscured the original pattern, making one sigh with regret. Upon closer inspection, faint lines could be seen, crooked and extremely messy. Li Xian frowned and looked carefully, discerning a clue. He said: "Deputy Chief Envoy Yan, is this a painting of ghosts?"

Yan Hao was startled and became interested. He asked: "Oh? How did you see that?" Li Xian said: "It's not that I saw it, but I was fortunate enough to come across paintings from the Nanyang period. At that time, the states were at war, foreign enemies invaded, and ethics were chaotic. Elegant scholars enjoyed painting landscapes, free and uninhibited. There were also eccentric scholars dedicated to depicting the world's tragedies. Initially, they painted scenes of cannibalism, famine, city destruction, floods... and other tragedies. Later, it gradually evolved into painting ghosts and monsters, and eventually became a genre. This type of painting has messy lines; a few strokes outline the tragedy."

Yan Hao said: "Rare, rare. You are so young, yet you know this? It seems you are quite knowledgeable about history?" Li Xian said: "This junior is just showing off before an expert. I don't even understand current affairs, let alone the Nanyang period. I just happened to hear a person of unparalleled elegance mention it, and I'm just repeating it now."

Yan Hao said: "In that case... that person is very knowledgeable. Just as you said, current affairs are hard to understand, and past events are even more obscure, with many things unverifiable. Such a person... if one could make friends with them, it would be a great fortune. Hahaha, if you meet them again, don't forget to introduce me."

Li Xian smiled without answering. These words were all from Wen CaiShang's casual remarks while viewing paintings in the Pure Yang Hermit's tomb deep in the mountains. Li Xian never forgot what he heard and used it for himself. If he were to meet Wen CaiShang again, Li Xian might face the danger of losing his hands and feet; how could he have the leisure to make introductions. Even if he did... although Yan Hao was the Deputy Chief Envoy, he would likely lose his life.

Yan Hao asked curiously: "You're not afraid?"

Li Xian asked: "A damaged painting, why should I be afraid?" Yan Hao said: "The ghost in the painting is called a Residual Demon. The brushstrokes hide a chilling ghostly aura. Ordinary people who see a ghost painting will feel uncomfortable all over, unable to sleep or eat."

Li Xian thought: "It's said that the Twin Pupils have the ability to suppress ghosts and gods. Is that why I don't feel afraid?" He remained silent. Yan Hao continued: "This damaged painting has a great origin. It is an imitation of the 'Painting of Chimeras, Specters, Residual Demons, and Apparitions,' but it has captured some of its true essence. This Residual Demon Painting contains a martial art: the Residual Demon Spear Art. It should be considered Mid-Grade, but because it is incomplete, it is far inferior to ordinary Mid-Grade."

"The true 'Chimera, Specter, Residual Demon, Apparition Spear' is a martial art famous throughout the world. Even a damaged imitation, if placed among Low-Grade martial arts, would be an insult to its dignity. Moreover, this martial art's origin points directly to the Candle Teaching. After comprehensive consideration, it is stored on the third floor."

"It can be exchanged for about ten taels of merit silver. However, this martial art has an evil nature. You probably guessed it. Although the Residual Demon Spear is damaged and not the true original, if you later encounter a miracle and obtain the other damaged painting, or if you witness the true 'Chimera, Specter, Residual Demon, Apparition Painting,' the martial art would undergo a heaven-shaking change. Therefore, many elders who knew about it have purchased the Residual Demon Spear for ten taels of merit silver."

"When they saw the Residual Demon Painting, they were all terrified, their faces turning pale. Some of these elders, who were bloodthirsty and cruel, like demons incarnate, were still so frightened their legs trembled. If they forcefully practiced it, they ended up with foolish characteristics."

"Thus, this martial art is truly love-hate. Although its current effectiveness is far inferior to Mid-Grade martial arts, its background mysteriously attracts people and is hard to forget. Many elders are always concerned about it. I really don't know how to deal with it, so I sealed it in a box to cut off those delusions."

"If the ten taels of merit silver are calculated at a thirty percent discount, three taels can be sold to you. It's quite a coincidence. I was just thinking, is there really such a coincidence in this world? Is it a hidden fate? I'll try to recommend it to you. Hmm... you saw the Residual Demon Painting for the first time but were so calm. Perhaps you really have a fated connection with this spear art."

Li Xian couldn't help but ponder. He had already made sufficient calculations, intending to choose sword techniques and body techniques to maximize his strengths. However, a great opportunity was suddenly placed before him, and he had to reconsider the pros and cons. The 'Residual Demon Painting' definitely hides danger, but he possesses the 'Heaven's Reward for Diligence' destiny, so he doesn't worry about difficulty in practicing. From Yan Hao's words, although the Residual Demon Painting has a great origin, because it is incomplete and an imitation of the 'Chimera, Specter, Residual Demon, Apparition Painting,' its effect belongs to Low-Grade martial arts, but it must be a bit more powerful than ordinary Low-Grade.

Li Xian pondered:

"The opportunity of the Residual Demon Painting is rare; if missed, it will be hard to obtain again. As for Low-Grade martial arts like Serpent's Intestine Circuit Sword and Soft Scale Swimming Body Technique, I may have a chance to touch them in the future. Moreover, the Residual Demon Painting costs ten taels of merit silver. If I exchange for it, I would save six taels of merit silver. This amount of merit silver, ordinary Flower Cage disciples couldn't earn in several lifetimes."

"But there is one major concern. Yan Hao's appearance is too coincidental; this Residual Demon Spear is too fitting. Is he or they intentionally guiding me, specifically making me try this spear art? I, Li Xian, am a nobody; why would worth others scheme against me? Even if there is a scheme, it should be for something else, not to take my life. Otherwise, how could I still be alive... Perhaps it's related to the Candle Teaching? Even if it is, there's no need to be afraid. I'm already living in the bandit's den; can I still get out of the relationship?)

Thoughts flashed, and an answer came in an instant. He said straightforwardly: "Good! This junior will boldly try."

Yan Hao said: "Good! You have courage and spirit! I've seen too many cunning villains; looking at you, this boy, I find you quite pleasing to the eye. Take this scroll!"

Li Xian was quite surprised. Martial arts manuals are always confidential. Even the casual martial arts pavilion of One Combine Manor, which recorded Basic and Low-Grade martial arts, strictly prohibited taking them out privately. The Flower Cage Sect, with its mix of all kinds, should be even stricter. Yan Hao smiled: "What? Are you worried I'll run away? In this Water Altar, where can you run?"

Li Xian understood and smiled: "Deputy Chief Envoy Yan's spirit is as vast as the sea; it is truly admirable." He paused and said: "There is one more thing, I don't know if it's appropriate to mention."

Yan Hao said: "Feel free to speak." He had no ill feelings towards Li Xian. This 'Residual Demon Spear' was quite related to the Candle Teaching. Shi YuFei intentionally instructed Yan Hao to use this opportunity to recommend and test him, to see how Li Xian would choose and how deep his connection with the Candle Teaching was. If Li Xian chose the Residual Demon Spear, it proved a deeper connection. He would then consider it further.

Li Xian said: "A few days ago, this junior obtained a set of Five Element Flags. But my knowledge is shallow, and my understanding of the Five Elements is not profound. The flags have little effect. I know Deputy Chief Envoy Yan has a惊神通天 mastery of the Five Elements. I thought if I could learn a thing or two from you, it would be a dream come true. I know this thought is presumptuous, but if I don't ask personally, I can't rest easy."

Yan Hao frowned and sneered: "You boy, your mind is too杂乱. You just got the benefit of the Residual Demon Spear, and now you want to dabble in my Five Element奇遁. Even if I were willing to teach you, you'd be picking up sesame seeds and losing the watermelon. It would waste my energy and耽误 your future."

"And my Five Element奇遁, is it easy to learn?"

He suddenly felt a bit annoyed. Originally, seeing Li Xian's performance, he thought the boy had a steady temperament. With these words, he had to reconsider. Li Xian knew that saying this would definitely displease others. He also knew that being able to see Yan Hao today might be due to Chief Envoy Shi's instructions. If he came to the Martial Inquiry Pavilion next time, Yan Hao wouldn't主动 show up, and it would be hard to see him. So he had to seize the opportunity, even if it meant being disliked, it was fine. Even if rejected, it was also fine.

Li Xian顺势 continued: "Deputy Chief Envoy Yan is worried I'll pick up sesame seeds and lose the watermelon. Then, if this junior has the ability to cultivate the Five Element奇遁 while making progress in the Residual Demon Spear, would senior be willing to teach me a thing or two?" He had a thick skin.

Yan Hao glanced at him淡淡ly: "With such a贪心 nature, I'm afraid you won't be able to achieve much in the Residual Demon Spear. You might even end up foolish. You may leave now."

Li Xian said: "This junior boldly wants to make a bet with senior. If I can truly achieve attainment in the Residual Demon Spear, I ask senior to give this junior a chance to inquire about the Five Element奇遁."

Yan Hao said impatiently: "When you have practiced the Residual Demon Spear to proficiency in a month, then we can talk about other things. You really are a不知天高地厚小子. How many elders, having obtained the Residual Demon Painting, gazed at it day and night, struggled to grasp the essence, and ended up foolish before even entering the gate. How dare you say you will achieve attainment in the Residual Demon Spear?"

"If you truly achieve attainment, then your words today could be considered neither humble nor arrogant, with exceptional talent. Such a person, teaching you the Five Element奇遁, wouldn't be a loss. But if you fail to achieve attainment and can't even enter the gate, ending up foolish, then it's truly痴心妄想, living as a joke, and you dare to dabble in my Five Element奇遁? Ridiculous."

Li Xian was not angry at all and smiled: "Good... then this junior considers the bet established. I take my leave." Yan Hao flicked his sleeve and left, too lazy to say more.

After Li Xian had gone far, Shi YuFei walked out from the side, accompanied by a woman with a slender figure, wearing a bamboo hat. The edge hung down a light gauze like water, completely obscuring her figure. Her face was even harder to see, but Shi YuFei was very respectful, actually walking half a step behind her.

Yan Hao bowed to the woman, then said to Shi YuFei: "Chief Envoy Shi, this time you misjudged. This boy's earlier performance was indeed not bad, maintaining composure even in danger. But as the saying goes, a horse's strength is known over a long distance, and a person's heart is known over time. A person's temperament needs long-term contact to understand. You heard what he said just now."

Shi YuFei looked at the woman beside him and asked: "Miss Chu, what do you think?"

The woman's surname was 'Chu', given name LiuQing. She had no connection to the Flower Cage Sect but a deep relationship with the Candle Teaching. She had arrived at the Water Altar a few days ago. She met with Shi YuFei and would practice in seclusion on the island for a month. Shi YuFei respectfully agreed, preparing an excellent residence for her, ensuring no one would disturb her.

During their casual conversation, Shi YuFei mentioned Li Xian. Chu LiuQing was not very interested, but since she was staying elsewhere, she agreed to take a look. If he was truly suitable and had a deep connection with the Candle Teaching, it wouldn't hurt to recommend him slightly.

But after listening to this part, she轻轻 shook her head and said淡淡ly: "In my opinion, there is no need to waste energy on this child. I can see he comes from a poor background, so he struggles to climb up. Such people have a common trait: because of their impoverished youth, their vision is very narrow, they don't know the immensity of heaven and earth. Even if they have spirit when young, it's because of ignorance. Once they climb to a high place by luck, their spirit is难免折损."

"Isn't today's event a living example? If it were a disciple from a noble family, they would never妄谈. Precisely because this person doesn't know the depth, he can make waves in a shallow pool for a moment. But when he goes to a larger stage and sees true geniuses and heroes, his spirit will be frustrated, and he will find it hard to recover."

"The higher he climbs, the more his limitations will be显眼."

"The Candle Teaching's downfall was due to too many such people. If we don't want to repeat the past, we need to make changes."

Shi YuFei said: "Alas, this child indeed disappoints me. Originally, I saw him in life-and-death danger, quite graceful, and his strength was not bad. It seems I need to reconsider."

Chu LiuQing glanced淡淡ly at him, completely indifferent: "There's no need to reconsider."

Li Xian hid the Residual Demon Painting well and rowed away from the inner island. The sky was now pitch black, with a chilling阴气 that was quite uncomfortable. Li Xian looked up at the moon, but it was obscured by clouds, showing nothing.

He thought of NanGong LiuLi; he didn't expect purchasing martial arts to take so long. His stomach was growling with hunger, and he imagined NanGong LiuLi was the same. Passing a roadside pond, he picked up four stones and threw them into the pond. With a few splashes, four one-jin grass carp were knocked unconscious, their bellies up, floating to the surface.

Li Xian clapped his hands from a distance, his palm force pushing the grass carp to the shore. He threaded a golden leopard tendon through the fish's mouths and carried them back to the residence. He moved quickly, his speed swift, and soon saw Peach Blossom Town. Peach Blossom Town had no curfew. The island was isolated from the outside world, and criminals had nowhere to flee, so it was peaceful and harmonious, with little theft.

But tonight, there were no people on the road. Li Xian thought it strange but didn't think too much of it, hurrying towards Green Ox Street. As he walked, he felt it was increasingly unfamiliar. The path seemed both familiar and unfamiliar. After walking for half an incense stick's time, he still couldn't return to the residence.

He felt secretly strange and became vigilant. He knew it was different from usual. He used lightness skill, increasing his speed, but found himself in a vast maze of alleys, turning in circles. Peach Blossom Town was not large, but it had many streets. This winding path was truly confusing.

Li Xian frowned tightly and thought: "A little ghost dares to blind my eyes?"

The Twin Pupils appeared.
