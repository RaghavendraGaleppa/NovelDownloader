Chapter: Recommendation of a New Book

It was recommended that you take a look at a new book, "The All-Powerful Lord" (Book Number 1266923). Here's a brief introduction:

Humans are born to be commanders, possessing great wisdom. Orcs are born to be warriors, brave and fierce. Elves are born to be archers, with beautiful and elegant appearances. And the Dragon Clan possesses a powerful magical immunity.

Dirk Evans, a member of a noble family with a long history, had a noble bloodline but didn't inherit his ancestors' talents, earning him the label of a "waste." However, he possessed the bloodlines of the four major clans. Due to a coincidence, his soul was merged with that of Zhao Feng, a college student from the modern world, and he was reborn. At this moment, his talents were awakened.

With talents in magical immunity, archery, berserker, and combined with modern scientific technology and wisdom, Zhao Feng, who possessed various talents, became an invincible All-Powerful Lord.

It is suggested that you take a look.
