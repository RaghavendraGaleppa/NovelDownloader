# Chapter 220: Extreme-Grade Spirit Land?

The sun gradually sank into the mountains. Night deepened.

Sanyuan City. The lingering scent of everyday life quickly dissipated. The various alleys fell silent. Some ordinary people without cultivation, living within, had long finished their meals, extinguished their lamps, and fallen into deep sleep. Generations had lived in Sanyuan City, a place where immortals, mortals, and demons coexisted. Certain rules were already etched into their bones, daring not to transgress even slightly. For instance, at night in Sanyuan City, it was best for ordinary people not to go out.

Qingle District, Yanping Alley. The Li Residence.

Unlike other households nearby, the estate was brightly lit. The Li Residence's ability to be so naturally stemmed from its confidence. The master of the residence, Li Jiu, was the head constable of Qingle District, one of Sanyuan City's 109 districts, with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. He was also considered a local figure of some standing.

Moreover, the Eldest Young Master of the Li Residence was even more extraordinary. When he was young, he passed layers of examinations to join the Cangyu Army of Sanyuan City. Though still young, he already held the position of corporal, with boundless prospects.

Today was the day the Li Residence's Eldest Young Master returned home from the Cangyu Army for a leave. Logically, it should have been very lively. However, at this moment, the Li Residence was shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, the air particularly heavy and uneasy.

In a side room, faint, suppressed sobs could be heard.

Inner courtyard. In the main hall.

Li Jiu, having just finished his patrol and returned home, hadn't even had time to change out of his official robes before walking straight to his eldest son, Li Jie.

“Is it confirmed?” Li Jiu asked abruptly, instantly breaking the silence in the room.

Hearing this, Li Jie nodded, saying in a heavy tone: “This morning during roll call, Commander Shen announced that the unit my son belongs to would be representing Sanyuan City to the Lingshu Mountain battlefield. The time is three months from now.”

“Over the past two years, the conflict between our Sanyuan City and the Yuanshui Sect and Longxiao Sword Sect has grown increasingly fierce. Everyone has truly unleashed their full fury; the battlefield is incomparably brutal, with soldiers suffering a horrific casualty rate, nine out of ten not returning.”

“Son fears that once he goes, he will—” Li Jie hesitated, his words trailing off, seeming afraid to continue.

Silence hung heavy for a long time.

“Alas—” Li Jiu sighed deeply, a look of sorrow appearing on his face. How could he not be clear about what his own son had said? Knowing was one thing.

But faced with the City Lord's Mansion's orders, faced with the Cangyu Army's deployment, what could he do? He was merely a small constable of Qingle District. His status was low, and his words carried little weight. He had no say whatsoever in this matter.

Just as he was lost in worry, suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck him, and he recalled the young figure riding a white deer whom he had seen a few days prior. A glimmer of hope immediately arose in his heart. Perhaps this time, Jie'er still had a chance to survive! If that person was willing to lend a hand.

…

That night. Before a quiet, secluded courtyard.

Li Jiu slowly stopped, his movements extremely cautious. He turned his head to look at his son, Li Jie, and quietly warned: “Jie'er, when you meet this esteemed senior later, you must not presume upon your identity as a Cangyu Army corporal and offend them. Your survival on the battlefield depends on this one chance.”

“I hope that esteemed senior will show some mercy, considering that your father took the trouble to help him find lodging before.”

Hearing these words, Li Jie couldn't help but ask curiously: “Father, who exactly is this person? How can you be so certain that he can save my life?”

Li Jiu explained with a smile: “Your father isn't clear about this esteemed senior's identity; he probably traveled here from elsewhere. However, the only thing your father knows is that this senior's strength is terrifyingly formidable.”

As he spoke, a hint of recollection flashed in his eyes. “A few days ago, when your father was pursuing a Foundation Establishment Realm evil cultivator, I happened to encounter this esteemed senior preparing to enter the city. As a result, merely a wisp of aura released by the senior's mount was enough to suppress that Foundation Establishment Realm evil cultivator, rendering him unable to move.”

“Just his mount?” Li Jie's gaze sharpened, and a spark of hope involuntarily ignited in his heart. If his father's words were true, the other party was most likely a Golden Core Realm grand cultivator. This time, he might... really survive. After all, that was the Golden Core Realm! Even within Sanyuan City, they were an undisputed grand figure. In the Cangyu Army, they were comparable to three commanders.

However, a hint of worry flashed across his face. “Father, we don't seem to have anything that could impress a Golden Core grand cultivator. Moreover, coming so presumptuously late at night might displease this existence.” After all, Li Jie had seen the commanders who were also Golden Core grand cultivators in the Cangyu Army. He understood in his heart that none of those who could cultivate to the Golden Core Realm were easy to provoke.

“Alas~ Your father knows, but this is your only chance for survival, Jie'er.” Li Jiu said with a bitter tone.

Immediately, he slowly walked to the door, gently knocked, his face full of apprehension. Not long after, accompanied by a 'creak' sound, the large door slowly opened. Lu Sanshiba, in human form, poked his big head out from behind the door, looked curiously at the father and son, and asked: “Who are you looking for?”

Outside the door, looking at the unfamiliar figure before him, Li Jiu's gaze froze, and a sudden wave of despair rose in his heart. Had that esteemed senior already left?

But the next moment, seeming to realize something, Li Jiu cautiously asked: “May I ask if you are Senior Lu? I am Li Jiu, do you remember? You were the one who helped me catch that evil cultivator back then.”

“Li Jiu?” Lu Sanshiba pondered for a moment. Then his eyes lit up. “Haha, I remember you. You helped my master find this courtyard. Is there something you need?”

After confirming the identity, with a 'thump', Li Jiu immediately pulled his son to kneel before Lu Sanshiba, speaking earnestly: “Li Jiu knows that coming so late at night is presumptuous. However, my son is about to be sent by the Immortal City to the Lingshu Mountain battlefield, a situation where death is certain and life is impossible. I beg for your mercy, esteemed senior, to save my humble son's life. Whatever conditions you have, Li Jiu will do his utmost to fulfill them, even if it means being torn to pieces or sacrificing the rest of his life.”

Lu Sanshiba looked at the old man and the young man kneeling before him with astonishment. He was about to say something, but unexpectedly, his master's voice suddenly came from beside his ear.

“Lingshu Mountain? Sanshiba, bring them in. I have something to ask.”

Hearing this, Lu Sanshiba's expression immediately became serious. “Understood, Master.” Having said that, his gaze suddenly swept over the two people before him, and he said lightly: “Get up now, and follow me inside. Master wishes to see you.”

As his voice fell, the father and son, kneeling on the ground, couldn't help but raise their heads and exchange glances, both seeing a glimmer of hope in the other's eyes. The esteemed senior was willing to see them. There was hope! The next instant, “Li Jiu offers his gratitude to the esteemed senior.”

…

Time slowly flowed by. Inside the room.

Tap! Tap!

Zhang Jing's fingers lightly tapped the table, as if he was contemplating something. A terrifying aura faintly emanated from his body. Below his seat, Li Jiu and his son sat stiffly, not daring to move.

However, if one looked closely, they would surely notice that Li Jie was secretly glancing at Zhang Jing above him from the corner of his eye. When he saw the other party's face, even younger than his own, a hint of shock couldn't help but flash in his eyes, and his heart became extremely unsettled.

“So young!”

“The crucial point is that the aura emanating from this person is simply too terrifying. Compared to him, the three Golden Core Realm commanders of the Cangyu Army are like fireflies compared to the bright moon; they are not on the same level at all.”

“Even the Young City Lord is far inferior to him.” Li Jie thought in disbelief.

Suddenly, Zhang Jing spoke, his voice interrupting their thoughts. “So, this spirit land named ‘Lingshu Mountain’ was born within the last two or three hundred years and is about to fully form. That's why your Sanyuan City, along with the nearby Yuanshui Sect and Longxiao Sword Sect, have been fighting over it for a century?”

“Reporting to esteemed senior, as far as this humble cultivator knows, that is indeed the case.” Li Jie said respectfully.

Zhang Jing's eyes flashed. “It seems a secret realm has completely integrated into the Qingxiao Profound Heavens. Only then could such a situation arise.” He speculated in his heart.

Afterwards, Zhang Jing looked at them again. “Where is Lingshu Mountain located? Do you know its grade?”

“Thirty thousand li east of the Immortal City.”

“However, if you wish to go there, esteemed senior, you should think twice. It is said that the place is jointly guarded by the Dharma Idol Realm Old Ancestors of our Sanyuan City, as well as the Yuanshui Sect and Longxiao Sword Sect. Outsiders are not permitted to approach.”

“As for its grade... this humble cultivator seems to have heard the Young City Lord mention something similar once. It was apparently an extreme-grade spirit land.”

Extreme-grade?!

Zhang Jing's expression suddenly froze, almost thinking he had misheard. Then, after just a moment, his expression returned to normal. “It would be best to confirm it myself another day. If it truly is an extreme-grade spirit land, then no matter what, I cannot miss this opportunity.” He thought to himself.

As for outsiders? Strictly speaking, everything within the Qingxiao Profound Heavens belonged to the Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect. And he was a true disciple of the Dao Sect. Which meant that they were the outsiders. However, Zhang Jing was more inclined to have a fight to determine who the so-called 'outsiders' truly were. After all, they would be neighbors in the future, and subduing people with virtue was the kingly way.

His heart stirred. In his Sea of Consciousness, clang! clang! The Immortal Binding Chain suddenly vibrated intensely, faintly emitting a monstrous, bloodthirsty, and ferocious aura, as if billions of devils were sinking and wailing within this aura.

Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction. Virtue abounding!

…

Half an hour later, two figures quietly left the small courtyard, a hint of unconcealable excitement on their faces. Li Jie unconsciously touched his brow with one hand. Hidden there was a wisp of terrifying Dao intent, which, if activated at a crucial moment, would be enough to save his life.

He glanced behind him, his eyes filled with longing. “Father, we might have encountered an extraordinary grand figure this time. Son suspects that this person might be an existence from ‘there’.”

“If only I could cultivate under this esteemed senior…”

…

On the other side, Zhang Jing's expression returned to calm as he floated cross-legged in mid-air. Above him, the six-colored immortal light continuously flowed on the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud. Especially on the sixth layer, the Mental Sun radiated an unprecedented brilliance, emitting a peculiar and terrifying pulling force. Centering on Zhang Jing, the various desires and distracting thoughts arising in the minds of living beings within a hundred-li radius instantly transformed into streams of illusory spiritual light, like young swallows returning to their nest, all pouring into the Mental Sun.

Endless, converging into a sea!

In an instant, a faint trace of purple quietly appeared within the Mental Sun, appearing remarkably dazzling.

“Indeed, in a place with so many living beings, the Mental Sun truly has room to display its power.” Zhang Jing smiled faintly.
