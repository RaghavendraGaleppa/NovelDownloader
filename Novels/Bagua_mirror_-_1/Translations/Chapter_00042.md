# Chapter 42: Changing Rules

"Xiao Fei, what does Aunt want with me?"

"How would I know? Mother just told me to fetch you—she didn't say why."

After several years apart, Qin Fei had grown considerably taller, now standing well above Qin Chong's shoulders.

Arriving outside the door, Qin Chong announced, "Your son pays respects to Aunt."

"Fei'er, you may return to your cultivation. Just let your elder brother come in."

"Understood, Mother."

Before leaving, Qin Fei couldn't resist sticking out his tongue mischievously at Qin Chong.

"Chong'er, have a seat. No need for formalities."

After settling into a wooden chair, Qin Chong asked, "May I ask why you summoned me?"

"Truthfully, it's nothing major. You've been away for three years, and I've been worried sick. Your safe return is truly a blessing from our ancestors."

Aunt Huang's cultivation was at the eighth layer of Qi Refinement, though Qin Chong didn't know her exact spiritual roots. Given that she remained at this level nearing forty, her aptitude was likely mediocre.

"Thank you for your concern, Aunt."

"Since we're family, I'll speak plainly. It was my idea to send you on that training journey last time. I hope you don't hold it against me."

Even if she hadn't mentioned it, Qin Chong had long known this truth.

Now that he'd returned with a breakthrough in cultivation, his father must have reprimanded her—otherwise, why would she be so meekly apologizing?

"As you said, we're family. How could I resent you over such a small matter? Besides, if not for that journey, who knows when I would have broken through?"

"I'm glad you understand. Our clan has limited resources, so I hope you three brothers can support each other to advance further in cultivation."

"I'll remember. If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave now."

"Very well. You must be exhausted from your travels—rest early."

Returning to his quarters, Qin Chong began planning his next steps.

The method by which Canglong Valley recruited disciples was common knowledge: those aged twelve to eighteen with spiritual roots of triple-element quality or better could directly enter the sect.

During the last recruitment, Qin Chong had been under twelve, missing his chance.

For those outside these criteria, admission required surviving tournament-style elimination rounds, with the top two hundred earning entry.

Currently possessing both offensive and defensive high-grade magical artifacts, Qin Chong felt confident against most late-stage Qi Refinement opponents—unless encountering exceptionally strong adversaries.

If truly pressed, he wouldn't hesitate to reveal his true cultivation level.

Still, Qin Chong wanted more preparation—at least acquiring a mid-grade artifact for appearances, reserving his high-grade treasures for tougher battles.

He also needed to stock up on basic talismans, which were far more convenient than spells and packed considerable power.

While Qi Refinement cultivators knew several basic spells, their effectiveness was limited by cultivation level—slow casting, modest power, and heavy qi consumption. Only Foundation Establishment cultivators could unleash spells' true potential.

Qin Chong avoided clan affairs these days, as his father exempted their generation from duties to focus on cultivation. Missing the prime cultivation window would make advancement far harder.

After ten days at home, Qin Chong departed early for Pingyang City. The Canglong Valley recruitment was less than ten days away.

A few days later, he registered at Canglong Valley's city outpost.

The next morning, Qin Chong left the city, flying toward Canglong Valley's mountain gates. With so many Qi Refinement applicants, the trials couldn't possibly be held within city walls. Moreover, cultivator battles often went awry, risking collateral damage to mortals.

On the appointed day, a massive crowd packed the square before Canglong Valley's entrance, encircling a hundred-zhang clearing in tight rings.

Qin Chong was swallowed in the throng, all eyes fixed on the center.

Strangely, no dueling platforms had been erected, puzzling the assembled cultivators.

At noon, a late-stage Foundation Establishment elder from Canglong Valley appeared at the square's center—a gaunt man with a wispy beard and piercing eyes, his aura profound.

"The Canglong Valley sect master himself?"

"Indeed! Elder Cao is personally overseeing this year's trials!"

"Even if I fail, seeing Patriarch Cao makes the trip worthwhile."

Murmurs spread through the crowd at his appearance.

Cao Zhengxiong, Canglong Valley's leader, had reportedly been at late Foundation Establishment for years, commanding great respect throughout the Song Kingdom's cultivation world. Rumors claimed he was the realm's next candidate for Golden Core.

"Fellow cultivators," he began, unleashing his spiritual pressure to silence the square, "first, thank you for your esteem in traveling far to join our trials. On behalf of Canglong Valley, I welcome you."

"863 cultivators registered this year. However, our sect's resources are limited, so only 250 may join through these trials."

Two hundred fifty? Fifty more spots than last time.

"After deliberation with our elders, we've changed this year's format—no more tournament duels. But I assure you, all participants will gain rich rewards regardless of outcome."

The square erupted again.

"What? No duels?"

"Then how will selection work?"

"After all my preparations, they change the rules?"

"Exactly!"

"Silence!" Elder Cao's voice cut through. "Surely you've heard of Canglong Valley's secret realm?"

Gasps spread—some excited, others nervous.

"The trial inside Canglong Secret Realm? Unbelievable!"

"That realm was exclusively for sect disciples!"

"But it's rumored to house second-rank demonic beasts! Wouldn't we be walking to our deaths?"

"Something feels off about this..."

"Don't be naive—Canglong Valley wouldn't squander their foundational asset!"

"Let's hear the details."

As the crowd settled, Elder Cao continued, "The rules are simple: points awarded for collected herbs, ores, and slain demonic beasts—ranked by quantity and grade. The top 250 scorers will join our sect."
