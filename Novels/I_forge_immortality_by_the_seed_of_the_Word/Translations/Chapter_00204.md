# Chapter 201: Re-entering the Dao Repository Secret Realm

"Natural Birth-Womb Realm?"

On the futon in the cultivation chamber, a hint of curiosity flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. Just by its name, he knew this divine ability was extraordinary.

His gaze shifted to the front. At this moment, Lu Thirty-Eight stood obediently, his chest puffed out straight. The unique Golden Core Realm spiritual power fluctuations emanating from his body were clearly suppressed to the extreme, not daring to leak even a trace. Although his master had explicitly stated that there was no need to worry about his cultivation accidentally surpassing his, and certainly no mention of punishment, Lu Thirty-Eight inexplicably felt nervous. He didn't know why.

"Thirty-Eight, what's so special about your bloodline divine ability, the 'Natural Birth-Womb Realm'?" Zhang Jing's gentle voice sounded.

"Reporting, Master." Lu Thirty-Eight bowed properly towards Zhang Jing, saying cautiously: "The Natural Birth-Womb Realm can manifest and envelop an area, forcefully transforming it into a special land suitable for the growth of all spirit plants, and it can also adjust the growth speed of Immortal Root spirit plants."

"Furthermore, the more Immortal Root spirit plants grown within the Natural Birth-Womb Realm, and the higher their quality, the stronger its power will become, and the wider its covered area will expand."

"During this process, I can also collect vital energy and deathly decay qi to cultivate other divine abilities within the inheritance."

"Oh, and Master," Lu Thirty-Eight suddenly remembered something and looked at Zhang Jing with a touch of guilt, saying in a low voice: "The Nine-Colored Divine Light inheritance you mentioned before, I seem to have obtained a portion this time, but I can't speak it or write it down."

"So..."

"It's fine, Thirty-Eight, cultivate it yourself." Zhang Jing smiled slightly, his voice still gentle and calm. It was perfectly normal for the Nine-Colored Deer, as a natural deity, to set up protective measures for the inheritance within its descendants' bloodline. Just like the Scripture of All Wonders and Supreme Nature last time.

However—

"According to Lu Thirty-Eight, the more Immortal Root spirit plants he cultivates, the stronger the Natural Birth-Womb Realm's ability to nurture spirit plants becomes."

"As expected of a bloodline divine ability, it truly matches his nature perfectly." A hint of surprise flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Immediately, he extended his hand, his five fingers slowly spreading open. In his palm, a seed of the Seven Treasures Gourd Vine strikingly appeared. In an instant, a majestic surge of life energy spread throughout the cultivation chamber.

"Master, this... this is..."

Lu Thirty-Eight swallowed, his eyes wide with disbelief. He hadn't expected it. His master had merely gone out for a trip and actually brought back an Immortal Root seed. Although he didn't know what kind of Immortal Root it was, just one glance was enough for Lu Thirty-Eight to be certain that it was definitely not much worse than the Three-Light Flat Peach Tree from before.

"No wonder Master is Master!" he thought excitedly.

Across from him, meeting Lu Thirty-Eight's eager gaze, a faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

"This is a seed of the Immortal Root Seven Treasures Gourd Vine, Thirty-Eight. Since you possess the Natural Birth-Womb Realm divine ability, this seed shall be entrusted to your care. Let's see what kind of... things it can bear."

"Please rest assured, Master, I will take good care of it." Lu Thirty-Eight patted his chest, then held his breath and carefully took the Immortal Root seed from Zhang Jing's hand. His gaze was as if he was looking at some peerless treasure.

Not long after, Lu Thirty-Eight, gently cradling the Immortal Root seed, slowly walked out.

Suddenly, "Thirty-Eight, since you've taken human form, find a room within the palace." Zhang Jing slightly raised his eyelids, giving a command.

"I understand, thank you, Master." Upon hearing this, Lu Thirty-Eight immediately bowed deeply to Zhang Jing, then, after rising, slowly retreated backward. In his footsteps, an extra hint of lightness was unknowingly added.

...

He didn't know how much time had passed. Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, his gaze flickering slightly.

"Senior Brother told me to quietly await Master's return."

"It's a good opportunity to go and acquire that Twenty-Four Heavens divine ability for cultivation, striving to upgrade it into an Immortal Seed as soon as possible, and prepare for advancing to the Golden Core Realm."

Ever since witnessing the power of the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed, Zhang Jing knew his initial idea was correct. This also made him increasingly eager for the inheritance of the Twenty-Four Heavens divine ability.

An Immortal Seed that fuses thirty-six types of Dao Intent. No, it also needs to incorporate the Taiyi Dao Intent, and even a pseudo-innate Primordial Immortal Light. Like this, he would surely forge an unprecedented Grand Beginning Golden Core, thereby laying the most solid foundation for his future immortal path. Only then would he not squander the advantage of possessing the mysterious jade talisman.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing slowly rose.

The next moment, a flash of light, and a familiar room abruptly entered his sight. All the arrangements within were exactly as Zhang Jing had left them, untouched.

As if thinking of something, Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened. A line of small seal script suddenly appeared before his eyes, emitting bursts of spiritual light.

[Zhang Jing (Registered Disciple of the Crimson Radiance Grand Brightness Grotto-Heaven): 5,157,500,000 Qi Luck]

Hoo— He subconsciously exhaled a turbid breath. This colossal number. No matter how many times Zhang Jing looked at it, he felt incredibly shocked, even having a faint sense of unreality. A full five billion! When he first arrived in the Upper Realm to cultivate, this was simply a vast amount of Qi Luck that he dared not even imagine. He remembered then, Zhang Jing had thought carefully and acted cautiously even for the mere few million Qi Luck required to project down to the lower realm. Yet, only forty short years had passed. Everything was now vastly different.

"It's the power of strength, indeed." A faint sigh echoed continuously within the empty room. And Zhang Jing's figure had already vanished.

...

Within the Dao Repository Secret Realm, accompanied by a 'buzz'!

In the dark night sky, an extremely bright star slowly descended, finally coming to rest beside a hundred-zhang tall spire.

At the top of the tower, Zhang Jing abruptly opened his eyes, the chaos-colored Dao Seal on his glabella gradually fading.

[Divine Ability: Twenty-Four Heavens, 990,000,000 Qi Luck]

Description: The Twenty-Four Heavens blesses oneself, granting boundless spiritual power and immeasurable divine abilities.

Cultivation Requirement: Golden Core Realm!

Foundation Establishment Realm can attempt preliminary cultivation, requiring...

His gaze swept over the description of this divine ability, and an uncontrollable surge of excitement flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. He had already met all the Dao Intent requirements for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. Now, everything was ready, all he needed was the opportune moment!

"Purchase!" Zhang Jing thought to himself.

In an instant, on a level Zhang Jing couldn't perceive, wisps of Qi Luck ascended from his body, instantly converging into a small lake.

At the same time, a white light suddenly appeared before him, quickly condensing into a simple, unadorned jade slip. Then, the jade slip seemed to lose its support and fell straight downwards.

*Thud!* A hand abruptly appeared below, gently catching it.
