# Chapter 37: Cloud Sea Pavilion Auction  

Qiu Shunyi approached Chu Ning as soon as he saw him.  

"Chu Ning, you said yesterday you wanted to invite more people to make it livelier, so I asked around. Who knew it’d turn out like this? It just so happened that many of us haven’t been to the market in a while, so the group ended up a bit larger."  

Chu Ning looked at the small crowd of nearly twenty people and thought to himself, *A bit larger?* The entire group of new disciples in the Spirit Plantation Division only numbered around thirty, and more than half of them were here.  

But inwardly, Chu Ning was pleased. A larger group meant better safety.  

"It’s fine. The more, the merrier," Chu Ning said with a smile. Qiu Shunyi, however, looked even more awkward.  

"I just heard from the others that Yuan Guang is coming too."  

Hearing this, Chu Ning couldn’t have been happier. *Even better. Having a leader figure will make me seem even more low-key. If anything happens, it won’t fall on me.* As for Yuan Guang’s apparent dislike for him, Chu Ning couldn’t care less.  

After all, he had already reached the fifth level of Qi Refining, while Yuan Guang was only at the third level. What was there to feel superior about?  

"It’s fine. We’re all fellow disciples—it’s not like there’s any bad blood," Chu Ning said, patting Qiu Shunyi on the shoulder.  

Qiu Shunyi, thinking Chu Ning was comforting him, quickly pulled him along as a senior from the sect arrived with a spirit boat.  

"There are too many of us to fit in one trip. Let’s go ahead first."  

Chu Ning didn’t object. Going to the market early would give him more time to explore, especially since he planned to return with the group later.  

Nearly ten people boarded the spirit boat, including Chu Ning, Qiu Shunyi, and Lü Xingyuan, who had visited the market with them before, along with a few other disciples. However, the others didn’t seem too eager to leave first.  

Chu Ning could guess their thoughts—they probably wanted to wait for Yuan Guang. This disciple, who had "simultaneously" reached the third level of Qi Refining with him, had effectively become the unofficial leader of the new Spirit Plantation Division disciples.  

Not long after Chu Ning and the others left, Yuan Guang arrived late.  

The moment he appeared, several people immediately crowded around him, chattering away:  

"Senior Brother Yuan, you’re finally here! You should’ve seen it—Chu Ning rushed off as soon as he heard you were coming."  

"He must’ve been too embarrassed to face you. Last season, he insisted on planting Ink Spirit Bamboo, and if it weren’t for switching to spirit rice, he might’ve gone hungry this month. Unlike you, Senior Brother Yuan, who already has access to cultivation resources."  

Hearing this, Yuan Guang forced a stiff smile, his expression somewhat unnatural.  

---  

Ever since Zhuang Yunde had told him that Chu Ning’s spell cultivation was far superior and that he had been recommended as a Learning Disciple, Yuan Guang had done his best to avoid running into him. Fortunately, Chu Ning was a low-key person who rarely appeared in public, so the two had hardly crossed paths.  

He hadn’t expected Chu Ning to be heading to the market today.  

However, upon hearing that Chu Ning had already left, Yuan Guang let out a long sigh of relief.  

With another forced smile, he said, "We’re all fellow disciples—no need to gossip behind his back. Who knows? Maybe Chu... Senior Brother Chu’s Ink Spirit Bamboo turned out quite well."  

"Senior Brother Yuan is truly magnanimous!"  

"Exactly! Senior Brother Yuan is so humble, even calling him ‘Senior Brother.’"  

Flattery poured in from those around him, making Yuan Guang’s expression even more uncomfortable.  

Fortunately, another senior from the sect arrived with a spirit boat, and the group quickly dispersed. On the senior’s boat, no one dared to continue such discussions.  

---  

Meanwhile, Chu Ning remained oblivious to everything that had happened after his departure. He didn’t even know that Yuan Guang had learned from Zhuang Yunde about his recommendation as a Learning Disciple.  

Once they arrived at the market, the group gradually scattered, leaving Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi to explore together.  

"Chu Ning, now that everyone’s earned some spirit stones from last season’s harvest, they’ve been buying things. Do you need anything?" Qiu Shunyi asked.  

Chu Ning nodded. "I need to buy some talisman paper for someone."  

Qiu Shunyi didn’t think much of it, assuming some senior near Chu Ning’s residence had asked him to run the errand. "Then let’s go to Cloud Sea Pavilion. They have the best selection and quality for commonly used cultivation materials."  

"Sure. I’ve never actually been inside Cloud Sea Pavilion before," Chu Ning replied as they continued deeper into the market.  

Along the way, Chu Ning spotted the same temporary tasks he had once taken on. But now, with dozens of spirit stones in his pocket, he couldn’t be bothered with small jobs worth mere scraps of spirit stones—unless, of course, it was something like Old Man Sun’s task, which could fetch over a dozen stones.  

Still, to avoid being recognized and having his secret exposed in front of the others, Chu Ning had no intention of visiting Old Man Sun’s shop again. Fortunately, the old man’s store was slightly off the main path, so they wouldn’t pass by unless they deliberately went that way.  

As they strolled toward Cloud Sea Pavilion, they noticed something unusual—today’s market was not only more crowded, but many people were heading toward the center.  

---  

Confused, Chu Ning asked, "Shunyi, why are there so many people today? Something feels off."  

"It’s Cloud Sea Pavilion’s bi-monthly auction day," Qiu Shunyi said matter-of-factly. "Didn’t you ask me to come today because you wanted to see the excitement?"  

Only then did Chu Ning realize the truth. He had thought Qiu Shunyi’s influence was just that strong, but it turned out everyone had come to join the spectacle.  

Seeing Chu Ning’s blank expression, Qiu Shunyi explained further.  

Cloud Sea Pavilion held a public auction every two months, showcasing rare and valuable items not usually available for sale. Though prices tended to be higher due to bidding wars, many cultivators—including Foundation Establishment experts—flocked to the event.  

To enhance its prestige, Cloud Sea Pavilion provided private rooms for high-profile buyers while keeping the auction itself open to the public. Many low-level cultivators attended just to broaden their horizons.  

According to Qiu Shunyi, he had already been twice.  

By the time he finished explaining, they had arrived at Cloud Sea Pavilion.  

Upon entering, they were greeted by a vast hall capable of seating over two thousand people. Tiered rows of chairs filled the space, with the front sections already packed. Chu Ning estimated at least four to five hundred attendees.  

"There are so many people today! The auction won’t start for a while—we can grab seats closer to the front," Qiu Shunyi said eagerly before turning back to ask, "Chu Ning, do you want to buy the talisman paper first?"  

Chu Ning glanced at the crowded counters and the occasional cultivators heading upstairs. Unwilling to jostle through the crowd, he shook his head.  

"The talisman paper can wait. Let’s watch the auction first."  

He didn’t feel entirely safe making purchases in such a crowded place. Better to buy from a smaller shop outside later.  

Since they were already here, he might as well enjoy the spectacle and expand his knowledge.
