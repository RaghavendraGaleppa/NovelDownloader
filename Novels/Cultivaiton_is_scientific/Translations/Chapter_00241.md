# Chapter 241: Resolution  

Before long, a streak of sword light approached from the distance, arriving in the blink of an eye.  

The newcomer was Elder Zhao, a Golden Core sword cultivator from the Shu Mountain Sect. His sharp sword intent caused the four Golden Core cultivators present to pale simultaneously.  

This was no rogue Golden Core cultivator—this was a true Golden Core expert from a major sect, and one renowned as the deadliest among sword cultivators. The mere display of his sword intent was enough to intimidate the other Golden Core cultivators.  

With a sweep of his divine sense, Elder Zhao quickly grasped the situation.  

He recognized all four Golden Core cultivators present. Within the Shu Mountain Sect's sphere of influence, the number of Golden Core cultivators was limited, and they had crossed paths at various gatherings.  

Three of them were clearly protecting the pavilion, which was heavily fortified with formations. Combined with the distress message he had received, it was evident that Li Shiming was inside.  

The remaining one, Hang Jian, who stood facing the pavilion, was undoubtedly the Golden Core cultivator attempting to assassinate Li Shiming.  

This thought flashed through his mind in an instant. A surge of sword intent locked onto Hang Jian, as if the slightest movement would trigger a devastating strike, cutting him down on the spot.  

Seeing Elder Zhao's arrival, Li Shiming let out a sigh of relief. Although the three Golden Core cultivators summoned by the Northern Shu Trading Company had blocked Hang Jian, they hadn't given him much sense of security.  

The three Golden Core cultivators were acquainted with Hang Jian—perhaps even friendly—given how quickly they had arrived. They must have been very close to this market to respond so promptly.  

Li Shiming wasn't about to entrust his safety to the whims of friendship or self-interest. With a sweep of his divine sense, he retrieved all the formation flags, causing the pavilion's formations to dissipate.  

"Disciple Li Shiming greets Elder Zhao. Thank you for your timely assistance!" Li Shiming stepped out of the pavilion and bowed deeply.  

"Enough, what happened here?" Elder Zhao's divine sense had already detected the situation inside the pavilion the moment the formations vanished, especially the sight of Ji Hongbo lying limp on the ground. He waved his hand dismissively as he asked.  

"Ji Hongbo conspired with Hang Yuqing to set up an ambush using the market's formations, intending to kill me. I killed Hang Yuqing and his five accomplices, but Ji Hongbo's identity is special, so I spared his life to be dealt with by the sect." Li Shiming summarized the events and handed a jade slip to Elder Zhao.  

After scanning the jade slip with his divine sense, Elder Zhao's expression darkened with anger, though a trace of surprise flickered in his eyes.  

His anger stemmed from Ji Hongbo's audacity—daring to collude with five late-stage Foundation Establishment disciples to assassinate a sect's alchemy true inheritor.  

An alchemy true inheritor wasn't just any ordinary disciple. They were the future pillars of the sect's alchemy lineage, a crucial foundation for the sect's prosperity.  

Ordinary true inheritors could perish without much impact, but the loss of an alchemy true inheritor would have severe consequences, affecting the sect's pill supply, resource allocation, and the cultivation of all its disciples for centuries to come.  

Elder Zhao's surprise came from Li Shiming's combat prowess. As a sword cultivator, he could clearly discern the key to Li Shiming's victory.  

Five late-stage Foundation Establishment disciples had failed to withstand Li Shiming's flying sword. The sword intent contained within it must have been extraordinarily powerful. It was a pity that such a sword prodigy had chosen to cultivate thunder techniques instead.  

"You're quite meticulous, recording their every move. But you've grown timid—why didn't you just kill Ji Hongbo with a single strike?" Elder Zhao glanced at the incapacitated Ji Hongbo inside the pavilion and remarked.  

He couldn't help but think that if Li Shiming had focused on sword cultivation, he would have acted decisively, never sparing Ji Hongbo's life.  

"Master and Elder Ji share some past camaraderie," Li Shiming replied with a faint smile.  

Elder Zhao pointed at him and chuckled.  

He understood Li Shiming's implication. Out here, in front of rogue Golden Core cultivators, it wouldn't do to air the sect's internal conflicts. By sparing Ji Hongbo, Li Shiming had given Elder Su leverage over Elder Ji. Moreover, sparing Ji Hongbo's life meant Elder Ji would owe Elder Su a favor—otherwise, Elder Ji's reputation in the sect and the cultivation world would be ruined.  

This move would give Elder Su a significant advantage in competing for resources to advance to the Nascent Soul stage.  

"Hang Jian, do you have anything to say for yourself?" Elder Zhao turned to Hang Jian and demanded sternly.  

Hang Jian's expression shifted between gloom and uncertainty. He wasn't a fool. Earlier, he had been blinded by rage after his son Hang Yuqing was killed and the market was robbed.  

Now that he understood the full story, he realized his Hang Clan was at fault.  

Moreover, given the current circumstances, what could he possibly say? What dared he say? With Elder Zhao's sword intent locked onto him, the slightest hint of defiance would result in his immediate execution.  

"Hang Jian is incompetent and failed to discipline his son," he replied, lowering his head.  

"Hang Jian, you will return with me to the sect to face judgment. But before that, you must compensate Shiming," Elder Zhao declared after a moment's thought.  

His gaze fell on Hang Jian's flying sword treasure.  

With a wave of his hand, the flying sword treasure flew into his grasp.  

Of course, this was only possible because Hang Jian offered no resistance. Otherwise, even as a sword cultivator, Elder Zhao wouldn't have been able to seize another's flying sword so easily.  

Hang Jian's heart sank. He knew his losses would be severe. Since he was being taken to the Shu Mountain Sect, his life was at least safe. At worst, he'd be forced to serve the sect for decades—a common punishment for Golden Core cultivators.  

Unless they were irredeemably evil, Golden Core cultivators—even the weakest rogue ones—were valuable assets. Those with family ties, like Hang Jian, were even easier to control.  

Elder Zhao examined the flying sword treasure in his hand, then unleashed a surge of sword intent. The sword emitted a faint hum.  

Hang Jian staggered, nearly falling from the sky. Though he had anticipated this, the forced severance of his connection to the treasure still inflicted spiritual damage.  

The flying sword treasure in Elder Zhao's hand dimmed as it lost its master.  

"Shiming, though you're not a sword cultivator, you practice the Ten Thousand Swords style. You'll need many flying swords in the future. I hereby decree that Hang Jian's flying sword treasure shall be yours as compensation," Elder Zhao said, tossing the sword to Li Shiming.  

"Thank you, Elder Zhao!" Li Shiming caught the sword and bowed in gratitude.  

"You... such a fine sword cultivator, yet you chose thunder techniques instead," Elder Zhao sighed, shaking his head.  

Li Shiming smiled but didn't elaborate. He examined the flying sword treasure in his hand.  

Clearly, this was Hang Jian's only treasure. Having only recently reached the Golden Core stage, Hang Jian hadn't yet refined it into a life-bound treasure.  

Had it been a life-bound treasure, its value would have plummeted, as such treasures lost nearly half their power when wielded by others.  

The life-bound flying sword left behind by Yun Xingyi was an exception—Yun Xingyi had intended to possess another body, so he had transferred ownership, allowing Li Shiming and his clone Li Yuanba to wield it without penalty.  

Elder Zhao had seized this sword for Li Shiming precisely because it wasn't life-bound.  

Moreover, losing his flying sword would cripple Hang Jian's combat power. Combined with decades—if not a century—of forced service to the sect, Hang Jian would pose no further threat to Li Shiming.  

In a hundred years, even if Hang Jian encountered Li Shiming again, he would stand no chance against him.  

This was the third flying sword treasure Li Shiming had acquired. He had given Yun Xingyi's life-bound sword to his clone Li Yuanba, who, as a pure sword cultivator, would only wield a single life-bound sword.  

When Elder Zhao mentioned Li Shiming's Ten Thousand Swords style, he was referring to a unique branch of sword cultivation that specialized in controlling multiple flying swords simultaneously, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers.  

This was the opposite of the traditional sword cultivator's philosophy of mastering a single sword to break all techniques. Neither approach was inherently superior, but the difficulty of acquiring multiple flying sword treasures in the Golden Core stage deterred most from pursuing the Ten Thousand Swords path.  

Elder Zhao had no objections to Li Shiming's choice. Given Li Shiming's alchemy skills, once he became an alchemy master, accumulating multiple flying sword treasures wouldn't be difficult.  

Alchemy masters were incredibly wealthy. Golden Core cultivators would gladly offer their rarest materials just for the chance to commission pills from them.  

"Hmm, your two masters are here," Elder Zhao remarked, looking into the distance with a smile.  

The arrival of Elder Su and Elder Ma made Hang Jian even more relieved that he hadn't harmed Li Shiming.  

He hadn't known Li Shiming had two Golden Core masters—especially Elder Ma, an alchemy master. Had he known, he would have reconsidered his actions.  

"Shiming!" Elder Su and Elder Ma called out in unison.  

Sensing that Li Shiming was unharmed, their worries dissipated.  

Elder Zhao handed them the jade slip and recounted the events.  

Elder Su understood why Li Shiming had spared Ji Hongbo. He was deeply moved that his disciple had gone to such lengths for him.  

"Shiming, Ji Hongbo will never cultivate again," Elder Su said gravely, ensuring no future threats remained.  

With a light press of his hand, he shattered Ji Hongbo's spiritual roots.  

Without spiritual roots, not even a Nascent Soul elder could restore Ji Hongbo's ability to cultivate.  

As a mortal, Ji Hongbo would be exiled to the secular world to live out his days in obscurity—no longer a threat.  

Ji Hongbo trembled uncontrollably as he felt his spiritual roots vanish. His struggles were futile. With his roots gone, even his hatred for Li Shiming faded away.  

"I thank the three of you on behalf of my disciple. From now on, this market shall be jointly managed by your three factions," Elder Su said, cupping his hands in gratitude to the three Golden Core cultivators who had aided them.  

Hang Jian remained silent. With his impending punishment and the loss of his family's influence, he could no longer maintain control over the market.  

"Elder Su, this market should belong primarily to Fellow Daoist Li. We would be honored to manage it on his behalf," the three Golden Core cultivators replied hastily, bowing.  

They didn't want to settle the debt of their assistance with just a market. After this incident, the market's future was uncertain. More importantly, they valued Li Shiming's future potential—his favor was worth far more than a market.  

"Esteemed Seniors, your kindness is noted. Since my master has granted you the market, please accept it," Li Shiming interjected.  

"Thank you, Elder Su and Fellow Daoist Li. We will manage it well," the three cultivators said after exchanging glances.  

They withdrew to handle the aftermath, including pacifying the bystanders.  

The spectators had witnessed an extraordinary spectacle today—one they would recount for years.  

They had seen seven Golden Core cultivators, including three Shu Mountain Sect elders, and marveled at the sheer dominance of a sword cultivator's aura.  

They had also seen Li Shiming withstand Hang Jian's assault with formations and summon six Golden Core cultivators in moments—a testament to his influence.  

"Master, I wish to continue my travels and won't be returning with you," Li Shiming said once only the sect elders remained.  

"After this, no fool would dare trouble you. Traveling will do you good," Elder Su agreed after a moment's consideration.  

Li Shiming had progressed rapidly but had spent too much time secluded in the sect refining pills. Elder Su worried prolonged isolation would hinder his growth.  

"I know you have life-saving treasures. Use the 'Thousand-Mile Escape Talisman' freely—just inform me when you need more," Elder Ma added.  

He was displeased with how Li Shiming had handled the crisis.  

With the talisman, Li Shiming could have escaped a Golden Core cultivator's pursuit effortlessly, avoiding the danger altogether.
