# Chapter 18: Ascending to Heaven in One Step – The Xiantian Realm

The Millennium Earth Pearl.

A treasure that had appeared in countless legends and tales.

Now that it was in his hands, Dou Changsheng examined it carefully but couldn't discern any profound mysteries from it. 

This could only mean one thing—the treasure had no affinity with him. A bitter feeling rose in Dou Changsheng's heart. If this were the future Dou Changsheng, the treasure would likely glow with divine radiance and leap into his mouth of its own accord.

After all, how else would the future Dou Changsheng have known about this treasure?

They were both Dou Changsheng, yet fate treated them so differently.

Divine treasures conceal their brilliance, making their secrets hard to perceive. Of course, there was also the possibility that this was merely a Northern Ice Pearl, not the Millennium Earth Pearl at all.

As he toyed with the treasure in his hand, Dou Changsheng hesitated. The Millennium Earth Pearl was said to be the essence of the earth, the source of qi. 

Consuming it would allow one to cultivate an unparalleled depth of qi, regardless of the cultivation technique used. Naturally, the quality of the qi would still depend on the technique, but the sheer quantity would easily outweigh any qualitative differences.

With such a gift, one could master divine techniques and cultivate an unmatched reservoir of internal qi or spiritual power, unrivaled in the world. 

This was the key to how many protagonists in legends and stories could rise rapidly, defeating stronger opponents despite their weaker cultivation.

This treasure wouldn't elevate one to the heavens in a single step, but it would reshape one's innate talents.

However, if this was merely a Northern Ice Pearl, consuming it directly would carry significant risks.

This was the source of Dou Changsheng's hesitation. The consequences of consuming the wrong item were severe, though not fatal.

With a decisive breath, Dou Changsheng cast aside all hesitation and swallowed it whole.

Given the Black Eagle Venerable's resources, it was unlikely he possessed more than one Northern Ice Pearl. 

The simplest way to consume the Millennium Earth Pearl was to ingest it directly.

Dou Changsheng swallowed it in one gulp, not even giving himself the chance to chew. The pearl dissolved instantly upon entering his mouth, transforming into a warm current that spread throughout his body, nourishing his meridians, flesh, and bones.

The abundant Xiantian qi within him suddenly surged wildly, doubling in an instant.

With his Xiantian qi exploding in volume, Dou Changsheng didn't dare delay. This time, he didn't have the [Perfect Life System] to safeguard him, ensuring a flawless breakthrough without mishaps.

Recalling the breakthrough method he had obtained from Tang He, Dou Changsheng began his attempt, first targeting the Twelve Primary Meridians.

He hadn't been idle these past few days. Whenever he had time, he would practice controlling his qi, guiding it through his meridians—though he had only dabbled, never fully committing to the process. His goal had been to familiarize himself with the flow of qi.

Now, with a roaring surge, his Xiantian qi blasted through one meridian after another, unstoppable as a tidal wave.

---

Dou Changsheng could clearly feel the Xiantian qi in his dantian beginning to rotate slowly, forming a massive vortex. With each rotation, more Xiantian qi was expelled—no, it flowed out naturally.

After breaking through a meridian, the Xiantian qi would increase, though not as dramatically as the fresh qi emerging from his dantian.

In the blink of an eye, his meridians were flooded. As the qi surged toward the next meridian, it also expanded and reinforced them, increasing their capacity to hold more qi.

The Twelve Primary Meridians were breached in no time, and the qi now turned its momentum toward the Eight Extraordinary Meridians.

The warm energy of the Millennium Earth Pearl seeped into his meridians, enhancing their resilience. The reason Dou Changsheng dared to consume it without fear of his qi exploding his body was simple—there had never been a recorded case of someone dying from an overdose of the Millennium Earth Pearl.

A potent elixir might be a deadly poison to an ordinary person, overwhelming them with its energy. But the true value of the Millennium Earth Pearl lay in its safety—even those with no cultivation base could consume it without fear of harm.

As the Xiantian qi roared through his meridians, the vortex in his dantian continued to generate fresh qi. What had initially been just over two months' worth of Xiantian qi had now swelled to five months—and the growth showed no signs of stopping.

Among the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, the most difficult to breach were the Governing and Conception Vessels. This bottleneck was infamous, having stymied countless martial artists, trapping them in the Houtian realm for life.

Yet now, in less than fifteen minutes, Dou Changsheng had already broken through half of the Twelve Primary Meridians and all of the Eight Extraordinary Meridians.

The vast currents of Xiantian qi surged through his meridians, growing slightly stronger each time they cycled back to his dantian.

With the Twelve Primary Meridians and Eight Extraordinary Meridians cleared, only the Heaven and Earth Acupoints remained.

Piercing these two acupoints would allow his Houtian qi to transform into Xiantian qi—the most crucial step in a martial artist's journey.

Wait.

As Dou Changsheng pondered how to proceed, recalling the relevant knowledge from memory, his abundant Xiantian qi had already begun the assault on its own—and had already broken through one of the acupoints.

With his active cooperation, the breakthrough became effortless.

The Heaven and Earth Acupoints were pierced in an instant. Suddenly, Dou Changsheng felt a deeper connection with the world around him.

Wherever his gaze fell, the sky seemed vaster, the earth more profound.

An indescribable bond had formed between him and the world.

His Xiantian qi surged once more, rapidly expanding until it reached the equivalent of ten months' worth. Then, climbing steadily, it peaked at a full year's worth before finally stabilizing.

Each cycle of qi still brought growth, though the increments were far smaller now.

Feeling the mountainous sea of Xiantian qi within him, Dou Changsheng realized that, in terms of pure qi volume, he might now rival his future self from two years later.

Or perhaps he was still slightly inferior.

After all, the future Dou Changsheng had progressed from Houtian to Xiantian, while he had started directly in the Xiantian realm. His easy breakthrough was built upon the foundation of his future self's achievements. Without the Xiantian qi cultivated through the *Triple Origin Reversion Art*, attempting to break through from Houtian qi alone would never have been so effortless.

The future Dou Changsheng, even with the Millennium Earth Pearl, would have needed at least a year to progress from a novice to the Xiantian realm.

But then again, Dou Changsheng realized he was overthinking it.

Once his future self had obtained the *Triple Origin Reversion Art*, he would have cultivated actively, far outpacing the current passive growth. Coupled with the vast resources poured into him by the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou, his progress would have been staggering.

What seemed like a year's cultivation might have yielded five or six years' worth of Xiantian qi—perhaps even more. 

A three-zhang sword aura was merely his basic attack, not his limit.

While Dou Changsheng had cheats of his own, his future self had the luck of destiny. How could he expect to surpass two years of cultivation in less than a month?

Still, in the end, he would inevitably overtake his future self.

After all...

His future self was already twenty-one!
