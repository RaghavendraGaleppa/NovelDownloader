# Chapter 39: First Encounter with an Inner Disciple  

An inner disciple whose cultivation speed could reach the upper tier was destined to achieve Foundation Establishment at the very least, with a considerable hope for Golden Core. With some great opportunities, even Nascent Soul wasn't beyond reach.  

Faced with such a junior sister, how could Zhao Qiancheng not be enthusiastic? In the world of cultivation, strength was paramount, but when one's progress stagnated, social connections became essential. If you didn't build relationships while the other party was still weak, you'd have no chance once they grew stronger.  

"Indeed, for us cultivators, cultivation is the most important thing," Zhao Qiancheng replied with a smile.  

As they spoke, the two arrived at the Spiritual Plants Hall's warehouse. This Junior Sister Yuan hadn't come to chat with Zhao Qiancheng—she was here to collect her benefits as an inner disciple and to tour the various industries within the sect.  

Compared to outer disciples and servants, inner disciples were the true core of the Qinglu Sect, the future leaders of the sect. Naturally, the Qinglu Sect was generous with their treatment of inner disciples—spirit stones, pills, and magical artifacts were standard, and inner disciples also consumed spirit rice daily to supplement their cultivation.  

After all, while pills couldn't be consumed excessively, spirit rice had no such restrictions. Thus, unless a cultivator was particularly strapped for resources, they would consume spirit rice daily, satisfying both their appetite and aiding their cultivation.  

"Young man, this season's yield has dropped quite a bit," the warehouse manager remarked as Zhao Qiancheng and the fire-attribute girl entered.  

The girl had timed her visit well—it coincided with the harvest of the new season's spirit rice. Since she was here to collect her share, she naturally wanted the freshest batch.  

"This season, the fields suffered from pests, so..." Gu Mo had prepared his explanation in advance. Every farmer encountered pests or rodents occasionally, so fluctuations in yield were normal.  

"What a shame."  

Hearing about the pest damage, the warehouse manager looked regretful. Gu Mo had previously won the yield-per-acre championship. If he had maintained his previous output of 800 jin, he might have competed for the title again this year.  

Winning the yield championship came with rewards, and for servant disciples with poor cultivation aptitudes, resources were their only means of advancement. The championship rewards provided excellent opportunities for accumulation.  

Seeing the manager's disappointment, Gu Mo also wore a regretful expression. He cared about the championship rewards too—his previous win had earned him a chance to become a Spiritual Plant Master. Even if this year's reward wasn't as good, it wouldn't be too shabby.  

But perfection was unattainable. To quickly master the Concealment Art, Gu Mo had to sacrifice some of his yield.  

Missing this opportunity meant he would never compete for the Spirit Jade Rice yield championship again.  

Now at the second level of Qi Refining and having mastered all five Spiritual Farmer spells, Gu Mo was fully capable of attempting higher-grade spiritual plants.  

Without continuing to cultivate Spirit Jade Rice, he naturally couldn't compete for its yield championship.  

After weighing, Gu Mo's final yield settled at just over 600 jin. Though it fell short of the previous 800 jin, it still exceeded the average.  

Of this, 300 jin were handed over in exchange for contribution points, bringing his total to 1,100. Without needing to exchange for the 3,000-point Hidden Qi Technique, these points could already fetch him quite a few items.  

Of the remaining 300 jin, Gu Mo planned to sell 200 jin for spirit stones. The market tavern was his only external connection, which helped him stay informed about the outside world. He couldn't afford to lose that, especially with the spirit stone-consuming array plates in his possession.  

The last 100 jin were for his personal use.  

"Elder Zhao!"  

After completing the yield registration, Gu Mo turned to leave but immediately spotted Zhao Qiancheng. He quickly bowed, his heart fluttering slightly—this was the moment to test his Concealment Art's effectiveness against a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"You handled the previous matter well."  

Zhao Qiancheng glanced at Gu Mo and nodded. He was referring to the over one hundred new recruits Gu Mo had brought to the Spiritual Plants Hall from the servant disciple area—the largest batch in recent years, and of notably better quality than the usual filtered recruits.  

Those new servant disciples were now diligently practicing Spiritual Farmer spells. Once they mastered one, they could cultivate the fields outside the valley, potentially stabilizing the hall's declining yields.  

Unfortunately, none of them showed Gu Mo's exceptional comprehension. After four or five months, none had succeeded in mastering a single spell—unlike Gu Mo, who had grasped the Minor Cloud Rain Technique in just three months.  

"It was my duty."  

Gu Mo remained humble, though his gaze inadvertently drifted to the girl beside Zhao Qiancheng. Her striking black-and-red hair was impossible to ignore—a distinctive trait of those with imbalanced elemental roots. The higher the attribute root's grade, the more pronounced the anomaly.  

"Keep up the good work!"  

Zhao Qiancheng offered a few words of encouragement but made no move to introduce Gu Mo to the girl. As an inner disciple, she was on an entirely different level from a mere servant disciple like Gu Mo.  

With a bow, Gu Mo withdrew. Throughout the exchange, Zhao Qiancheng hadn't detected anything amiss with his cultivation—proof that the Concealment Art could indeed deceive a Foundation Establishment cultivator's senses.  

"Elder Zhao, you seem quite fond of that servant disciple," the girl remarked curiously after Gu Mo left. It was unusual for a Foundation Establishment elder to engage in such a lengthy conversation with a servant.  

"He's a promising one—excellent comprehension, mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Technique in three months, and won the Spirit Jade Rice yield championship within a year. A shame about his poor spiritual roots." Zhao Qiancheng nodded. Aside from his roots, Gu Mo's performance was outstanding, which was why he had granted him the rare opportunity to train as a Spiritual Plant Master.  

The girl listened calmly, even feeling a hint of indifference. Gu Mo's achievements might be impressive among servant disciples, but to an inner disciple like her, they were merely ordinary.  

Her own comprehension of fire-attribute spells far surpassed his speed, placing her among the top tier of inner disciples in fire-based techniques—a testament to the power of her mid-grade fire spiritual root.  

But when Zhao Qiancheng casually mentioned that Gu Mo had mastered the Purification Art to perfection, her expression shifted instantly.
