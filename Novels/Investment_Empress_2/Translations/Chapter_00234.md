# Chapter 234: I’ve Never Heard Such a Request Before (1/2)

Not long ago.

Li Mo’s entire focus was on the small figure within his Dantian. He was constantly enduring the wash of countless profound divine intents from the Divine Observation Chart. His soul felt as if it were caught in a vortex; only by relying on the加持 of moonlight did he manage to maintain a glimmer of consciousness.

The Stone Monkey divine rune grew increasingly distinct.

Along with it, the names of the various divine arts he had observed during the day also became clear.

Just like during the day, Li Mo felt as if he were looking at a supreme sword manual, yet he couldn't memorize it even if he tried.

As his spirit trembled, he could barely maintain his consciousness. But just at that moment, the moonlight protecting him suddenly flared with brilliant clarity!

What the hell was happening?

He wasn't dual-cultivating with the Ice Cube, and even when they did, it usually didn't reach such a degree...

That halo of clarity illuminated his spiritual altar, finally allowing him to see the mystery before him.

**Vajra Indestructible!**

The Stone Monkey divine rune was completely branded at this moment.

Guided by the moonlight, flowing light lit up the meridians and acupoints within the small figure.

A sound, the purest sound of metal and iron in the world, rang out.

Upon the Dantian figure, a layer of glazed golden light suddenly burst forth. The golden light wasn't thick, as thin as a cicada's wing, yet it seemed eternal.

Invulnerable to blades and spears, impervious to water and fire, undamaged by lightning, indestructible through all calamities...

Only when all these attributes are stacked together can it be called Vajra Indestructible!

At this moment, even the moonlight could no longer sustain his soul. He wasn't yet qualified to fully accept the various intents within the divine art. His soul strength, having observed the three orifices, was far beyond others of the same realm, but it was still too weak to accept the inheritance of a divine art. If not for the sudden brilliance of the moonlight, he wouldn't have even been able to accept the Vajra Indestructible.

"To truly make this extreme form diagram my own..."

"I must at least observe the six orifices."

As this realization dawned upon him, Li Mo's consciousness gradually separated from the chaotic divine intent.

Little Li Mo woke up. The ecstasy made him jump up high, and then he saw Ying Bing not far away.

"Ice Cube, was that you who helped me just now?"

Ying Bing slightly tilted her head, avoiding the burning joy in the young man's eyes.

What had come over him all of a sudden?

Before she could ask, she suddenly felt light as Li Mo picked her up and spun her around twice.

He was even singing:

"Our common people, oh, are truly happy today."

Ying Bing's body stiffened, but she saw the boy's eyebrows dancing, truly ecstatic to the extreme.

She had never seen him this happy before...

Moreover, compared to what she had just done, Li Mo just happily spinning her around twice didn't seem like much...

So, in the end, she didn't push him away with force.

"Ahem, sorry, I couldn't help myself for a moment."

Meeting the girl's quiet eyes, Little Li Mo calmed down slightly. He realized what he was holding.

It was the Ice Cube!

Letting go of her slender waist, he coughed lightly:

"I was just too happy just now."

"Why?"

Ying Bing tucked the hair by her ear back and looked up. She didn't see any strange expression on the boy's face; he looked like a child who had just gotten a new toy.

Li Mo's lips curled up slightly as he said calmly:

"Now, I can become very hard."

Ying Bing: "?"

Her phoenix eyes paused, filled with a small question mark.

But Little Li Mo's next sentence was even more baffling.

Li Mo suddenly said seriously:

"Hit me. Hard."

Ying Bing, having lived two lives, had never heard such a request.

"I still need to observe the divine intent."

She shook her head and turned to go upstairs.

It's fine to be childish occasionally.

Even if the system's ranking placed his combat power above hers, standing there and taking a hit wouldn't feel good at all.

She didn't mention dual-cultivating as she left.

---

Li Mo found it strange. He felt that the Ice Cube's retreating figure seemed a bit... hurried?

As if she had done something wrong...

There was no other way.

Little Li Mo had to go to his Master's room. After waking the beautiful Master up, he quickly took out a bottle of good wine before she could get angry.

Shang Wu stopped herself at the edge of the cliff, drank the fine wine with a huff, and grumbled:

"It's the middle of the night. What serious business could you possibly have?"

"I want Master to hit me hard."

Li Mo said seriously.

"Huh?"

Shang Wu was instantly wide awake.

She looked at her precious disciple with suspicion.

"Are you serious?"

"Yes!"

Aside from being eager to test his new skills, Li Mo truly wanted to test if Vajra Indestructible had any upper limit or restrictions. It was a life-saving trump card, after all, so he needed to test it thoroughly.

The beautiful Master thought her precious disciple was either stupid or getting arrogant.

Did he know that the top twenty on the Hidden Dragon List could resist an Inner Scene?

But did her precious disciple know that the eighth on the Human List had been beaten by her?

"Come on then, let's see how much you've improved recently."

Shang Wu stood in the courtyard. Seeing Li Mo's eager expression, she couldn't help but roll her eyes slightly.

This kid was probably getting arrogant.

Daring to take her full-force strike today, wouldn't he be flying to the sky tomorrow?

She had to show this kid her true skills.

"Please, Master."

Li Mo also became cautious.

Among the Inner Scene experts he had encountered so far, none were stronger than his Master.

Shang Wu clicked her tongue, a smile appearing on her beautiful face:

"Alright."

The next second.

*Boom—*

There was no sign of a domain being released.

Shang Wu moved instantly, as if the chill of early autumn had vanished in an instant.

Her waist twisted like a blooming fire lotus.

Her pink fist lightly clenched, as if holding a blazing, violent sun, and slammed down with the momentum.

If it were raining at this moment, one would imagine that the raindrops filling the sky would freeze right then and there.

Li Mo, whose heart almost stopped beating, had this thought rise in his mind. When that domineering fist砸了过来, he truly felt as if the world was overturning and doomsday was upon him.

Master had never used her full force before...

Li Mo stared fixedly at that enlarging fist, his thoughts unable to even turn.

Suddenly, the Stone Monkey divine rune in his soul shone brilliantly.

An unyielding intent arose spontaneously in his heart, and he regained his consciousness.

If it were before, regaining consciousness would have been useless; he could only try to take out a divine weapon to block.

But now...

"Hmph, let's see if you still dare to look down on your Master."

Shang Wu looked terrifying, but she was actually ready to retract this punch at any moment.

But then, a faint glazed golden light appeared before her eyes.

It seemed to last only an instant, yet it seemed to exist as eternity.

It was emanating from Li Mo.

And Shang Wu suddenly saw a pair of familiar eyes, filled with unyieldingness, defiance, and fearlessness...

How familiar was this?

What a martial artist needs is the heart to fight any powerful enemy...

"Shang Wu, what are you doing?"

It was Elder Xue, who had just returned.

He saw this scene and almost had his soul scared out of him.

But Shang Wu ultimately didn't retract this punch.

*Clang!!*

The sound of metal clanging echoed through the sky.
