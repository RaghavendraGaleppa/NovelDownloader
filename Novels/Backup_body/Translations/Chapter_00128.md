# Chapter 128: Strike to Kill!  

The southeastern coastline.  

Following the guidance of the golden book's fortune, Li Zhengjing unleashed the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi toward the sea. His right arm was still injured and remained severed, but with his left hand, he swept out sword energy that split the ocean apart.  

The dragon girl, Hanging Bird, and Guigu Lingguan all ventured into the sea at this moment, disappearing where the ocean met the sky.  

"The dragon girl's perception far surpasses ours. Did she sense something?"  

Li Zhengjing pondered this but did not stop his swordplay. His true energy was rapidly depleting, but fortunately, the golden book could absorb spiritual energy, so he continuously consumed spirit stones. Over a hundred graded spirit stones were expended in the process.  

Even the Immortals and deities observing from afar felt a pang of heartache.  

"He can actually swallow spirit stones raw and refine them directly?"  

"Even we can't refine spirit stones this quickly."  

"Does this mean that as long as he has enough spirit stones, he can just swallow them without refining?"  

"Over a hundred spirit stones—just wasted like this?"  

For ordinary cultivators in the External Qi Realm, obtaining even a few graded spirit stones in their lifetime was a rare feat. Even for Immortals and deities, spirit stones were precious and hard to come by. A hundred spirit stones would be considered a vast fortune for any Immortal.  

Yet Li Zhengjing had expended them all just to fling sword energy into the sea?  

What was he trying to accomplish?  

Was this meant to intimidate everyone?  

Though his sword energy was indeed terrifying enough to shock Immortals and deities, a few slashes would have sufficed. Why had he been bombarding the sea for nearly an hour?  

Wasn't he exhausted?  

"..."  

Especially the newly appointed Jiangshang Prefect, General Fang Yin, and the other court deities found it utterly absurd.  

At first, sensing Li Zhengjing's sword energy cleaving into the sea had indeed left them awestruck and wary.  

But by now, they had grown numb, even convinced the kid had lost his mind. Their gazes, once filled with reverence for a powerful figure, now held the pitying look reserved for fools.  

"What is he trying to achieve by bombarding the sea with sword energy?"  

"Is he trying to prove that not only is his sword energy sharp, but he can also keep it up for hours?"  

"Maybe he's venting his frustration after losing his arm?"  

"He's been at it for an hour—over a hundred spirit stones. Even I feel the pain just watching."  

"He's young and impulsive. After suffering such a setback, it's understandable—"  

Before the new Prefect could finish, a streak of light shot from the distant sea, arriving in an instant.  

He gasped. "What is that?"  

In that moment, all perception was severed.  

Those spying from afar could no longer see what was happening along the southeastern coast.  

Unless they went in person and witnessed it with their own eyes. But with Li Zhengjing's sword energy capable of slaying Immortals and deities, and his relentless bombardment of the sea, who would dare approach and risk death?  

The gathered Immortals and deities exchanged bewildered glances.  

But now, they vaguely understood something.  

"Was he bombarding the sea with sword energy to lure something out?"  

"What exactly was that thing just now?"  

"How did he know that sword energy could summon it?"  

"Li Zhengjing is young, yet his cultivation is extraordinary. He obtained the Heavenly Star Cave's fortune, seized the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, the Mirror of Profound Illumination, the Banner of Luofu's Summoning Heaven, and other supreme treasures of the world. What else could possibly catch his eye?"  

"Whatever it is, it must be extraordinary if he spent an hour bombarding the sea and wasted over a hundred graded spirit stones for it!"  

Discussions erupted among the onlookers, all feeling a sense of absurdity.  

Could one really gain an opportunity by flinging sword energy into the sea?  

Earlier, they had looked at Li Zhengjing as if he were a fool, recklessly expending energy by the shore. Now, they realized they were the fools, utterly clueless about the deeper meaning behind his actions.  

"Is this kid really a cultivator under twenty?"  

"Looking back, his every move seemed baffling at first, but in hindsight, they always brought him immense benefits!"  

"Take this Heavenly Star Cave opportunity—he traveled all the way from the capital as if he knew a world-shaking fortune awaited him here!"  

A sense of bewilderment filled their hearts, along with countless speculations. They were now desperate to know what had happened on the southeastern coast.  

In the past, they could have used beast-taming techniques to interrogate nearby creatures—even ants and insects—to learn the truth.  

But the previous battle had obliterated everything within a vast radius, leaving behind a wasteland devoid of life. Not a single ant remained.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing continued unleashing sword energy by the shore. Enhanced by the broken sword fragment, its power was enough to slay Immortals, splitting the heavens and the sea. But the sharper the sword energy, the more it wounded him.  

His muscles, bones, skin, and internal organs felt as if countless needles were piercing them. If not for the Heavenly Azure Dao Treasure's constant healing, he would have died long ago.  

Just as he was about to consume another spirit stone, a flash of light appeared in the sea, followed by golden dragons soaring in pursuit.  

"Master, there's something in the sea! I can't stop it!" Hanging Bird cried from above.  

Li Zhengjing immediately slashed another wave of sword energy toward the sea.  

The streak of light in the water surged upward, colliding with the sword energy.  

Boom!  

The sword energy shattered, and the light dispersed.  

A figure tumbled out, falling onto the sea's surface, bobbing lifelessly.  

The light revealed its true form—a small cauldron.  

The cauldron was ancient in design, glowing faintly. Sensing the abundant Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi within Li Zhengjing, it shot toward him.  

Li Zhengjing raised his left arm, and the cauldron crashed into his palm.  

Boom!  

He was sent flying over thirty feet, his left arm broken, pain contorting his face.  

But the cauldron was now in his grasp.  

The Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi flowed from his palm into the cauldron.  

The razor-sharp sword energy did not pierce the cauldron but instead seeped into it.  

Then, lines of ancient, intricate text appeared within the cauldron.  

Li Zhengjing stared in confusion.  

Hanging Bird landed beside him, astonished. "So it was this little cauldron? Even the golden dragons from the Dragon Pillar couldn't stop it."  

Li Zhengjing held the cauldron. The Heavenly Azure Dao Treasure quickly healed his left arm. He then handed it over and asked, "Hanging Bird, you're well-read. Can you understand this?"  

Hanging Bird averted its eyes. "My vast knowledge doesn't include this kind of ancient script..."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree scurried over, examined it, and spread its five branches. "No idea."  

"Didn't expect much from you anyway. Let me take a look."  

Yuan Zhengfeng extended his perception and said, "No clue."  

Li Zhengjing frowned. Glancing at the golden book's fortune, he guessed that the "Taiyi Sword Refining Art" must be among the inscriptions inside the cauldron.  

But the script was so ancient that no one recognized it?  

He paused, then looked toward the sea.  

The person who had been carried out of the depths by the cauldron was still floating face-down in the water.  

"Quick! Save him before he drowns!"  

Li Zhengjing immediately ordered Hanging Bird to rescue the man.  

The bird spread its wings, flew over, and grabbed the man's shoulders, lifting him up. "Master, he's not dead yet—still breathing. Should I finish him off?"  

"Finish him off, my ass!" Li Zhengjing snapped. "We have no grudge against him. Why kill him?"  

Hanging Bird blinked. "But Master, aren't you planning to keep this thing for yourself? If we're robbing him, shouldn't we silence him? The books say to eliminate all witnesses..."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree shouted, "If you're killing him, why drag us plants into it?"  

Li Zhengjing weighed the cauldron in his hand. "I don't want the cauldron—I want the text inside. Since he had it before, maybe he can read it."  

Yuan Zhengfeng murmured, "This cauldron is no ordinary treasure. Your sword energy can slay Immortals and split mountains, yet it couldn't break this little thing. It's a supreme treasure. Now that it's in our hands, are you really giving it up?"  

Hanging Bird puffed its chest. "A gentleman loves wealth, but takes it the right way."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots. "Are you all idiots? He's in our hands now, along with the cauldron. Clearly, Master doesn't just want the cauldron—he wants the man too. This guy will probably end up warming Master's bed..."  

It wagged its branches gleefully. "Only I truly understand Master's heart. After all this time, why haven't you two caught on?"  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing's expression was complicated as he glanced at Hanging Bird and the tree, then at the jade fragment housing Yuan Zhengfeng.  

Back in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, Elder Yuan Zhengfeng had been known for his integrity and selflessness. But under the influence of Hanging Bird and the tree, he had turned "black from proximity to ink."  

It was all his fault for focusing too much on cultivation and neglecting their moral education. He hadn't instilled his own virtues—honesty, righteousness, handsomeness, and so on—into this bird, tree, bug, and jade fragment.  

"Revive him first."  

Li Zhengjing stowed the cauldron and headed toward the sea.  

Now that he had obtained the artifact, he needed to check on the dragon girl and Guigu Lingguan—what had happened to keep them away for so long?  

As Li Zhengjing left, Yuan Zhengfeng sighed.  

"Young Zhengjing may be young, but he understands human nature better than this old man. By saving this person, we'll have a life debt over him."  

"Ah, I see!" Hanging Bird exclaimed. "With that debt, he belongs to us—so the cauldron is naturally ours too!"  

"If he doesn't hand it over, isn't that ingratitude?" the tree added.  

"And ingrates deserve to be buried, right?" Hanging Bird mused. "Might as well not save him—save the elixirs..."  

"Isn't that a bit much?" Yuan Zhengfeng hesitated. "We should at least go through the motions..."  

"Flip! Flip!" The Wave-Severing Gu shook its antennae, its eyes gleaming with newfound wisdom. Its young mind had once again been enlightened.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, deep in the sea, overheard their conversation and cursed, "Nonsense! I, Li Zhengjing, am a righteous cultivator! I don't seek repayment for kindness! I'm known as the Righteous Immortal! How could I extort someone?"  

He suddenly halted, frowning. "How can I hear them from here?"  

He was far from the shore. Even an Immortal would struggle to hear such distant voices—only those with innate gifts or auditory techniques could manage it.  

Though Li Zhengjing's combat power rivaled that of a sect leader, his cultivation was still only at the External Qi Realm. His perception was limited—he shouldn't have been able to hear them.  

Then it hit him. He looked at the cauldron in his hand. "This thing... amplifies my perception a hundredfold?"  

Shocked, he pressed onward.  

He could now sense the commotion ahead.  

The dragon girl's aura was deep beneath the sea, locked in battle with another demonic Immortal.  

She had the upper hand, her ferocity overwhelming the other.  

But what alarmed Li Zhengjing was the presence beside Guigu Lingguan—an entity of terrifying power.  

Its aura was vast and unfathomable!  

The only beings he had felt such strength from were the creditor of the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven and the Third Generation Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Venerate in the capital's cave heaven.  

"Stronger than the Flame God King!"  

Li Zhengjing's expression turned grave.  

The Flame God King had once been a sect leader-level powerhouse. But nearing the end of his lifespan, he had transferred his soul into a divine body, weakening his power.  

Centuries had passed since then, and the Flame God King had aged further. Even as a deity, his soul was decaying.  

Though he surpassed ordinary upper-level Immortals, he was no longer at his peak.  

But the being ahead exuded strength far beyond the Flame God King's current state—a true sect leader-level existence, one of the rarest in the world!  

Yet, from his perception, Guigu Lingguan wasn't fighting this being. There was no hostility between them.  

Relieved, Li Zhengjing thought, "If they're not fighting, it can't be an enemy."  

But then he sensed the mighty presence shift its focus to the sea, separating the dragon girl from the demonic Immortal.  

The dragon girl's aura was instantly restrained.  

Fearing the worst, Li Zhengjing checked the golden book's fortune and pressed forward.  

Soon, he saw Guigu Lingguan standing in the sky beside a towering old man.  

The elder had a weathered face and graying hair, but his posture was upright, his build robust, and his eyes sharp and bright.  

A strand of his magic power coiled around a silver-white dragon in the sea like a rope.  

This was the first time Li Zhengjing had seen the dragon girl's true form. But before he could marvel, the elder's gaze locked onto his hand.  

"The Nine-Inch Sacred Cauldron."  

The elder spoke coolly, "Hand it over."  

Without waiting for a reply, he flicked his other hand, conjuring a whip of magic power that lashed toward Li Zhengjing.  

The whip tore through the void, arriving in an instant!  

Its force was overwhelming—utterly merciless!  

He intended to kill Li Zhengjing on the spot, take the cauldron, and be done with it.  

Strike to kill!
