# Chapter 265: The Water Tribe Matchmaking Event, The Ice Cube Is About to Arrive at the Battlefield!

The sky was bright, casting a golden halo around the Suspended Temple atop Golden Summit Mountain, creating a magnificent and awe-inspiring sight.

At the foot of Golden Summit Mountain, it was bustling with activity. Many demon clans had gathered, and as in previous years, the atmosphere was tense with hostility. However, the reason for this tension seemed a bit off...

The Bone Fish slowly drifted toward the shore. Sky Floodling Li Mo gazed up at the sky, as if searching for something on the horizon.

Brother Murong’s bald head was incredibly eye-catching; anyone who didn’t know better might think he had just come down from the Suspended Temple.

Wu Qing and Murong Feng stood tall and proud. Seeing the Water Tribe waiting for them, they couldn’t help but feel that the Ming Flood Dragon Clan was no longer what it used to be.

“Auntie Wu, can we take a detour?” Li Mo asked.

“The Water Tribe must wait here for the monks of the Suspended Temple to guide them. We are civilized flood dragons; it would be against the rules to enter without permission.”

Li Mo looked at the grand spectacle not far away. He had thought that if his human identity were ever exposed one day, he might be devoured alive by the demons. But now, it seemed the risk was already present even before his identity was revealed.

“When I was with my wife, we were about your age,” Murong Feng said with a smile. “If you really find someone suitable, it’s better to settle your lifelong affairs early.”

Wu Qing blushed and playfully hit her husband.

“How did you two get together back then?” Li Mo couldn’t help but ask out of curiosity.

Murong Feng looked gently at his wife and child and said emotionally, “Back then, I was full of ambition. I wanted to enter the Central Continent, challenge the world with my sword, and meet the heroes of the nine heavens and ten earths. On the way, I met my wife.”

“We traveled together, upholding justice, robbing the rich to help the poor, and galloping through the martial world. Qing’er was much stronger than me; she even made it onto the Hidden Dragon List and comprehended the Hengyun Sword Mark.”

“Do you know about the Hengyun Sword Mark?” Murong Feng stroked his beard, filled with nostalgia for his youthful days.

Wu Qing also remembered the sunset in Yunzhou, running under that afterglow...

“Ahem... Sword Mark? What sword mark? I don’t know,” Li Mo replied, thinking it was better to play the role of an ignorant country bumpkin flood dragon. He couldn’t very well say, “Uncle and Auntie, your youth is now just a memory...”

“And then?” Li Mo prompted.

“On the way back to the Eastern Wasteland, my wife and I discovered something unusual in a temple. Someone was using the method of ‘viewing oneself as a god’ to absorb the faith of the masses to nourish their spirit, which attracted the pursuit of the Demon Summoning Sect.”

“To save me, my wife had no choice but to reveal her true form. It was only then that I learned she was not human.”

Li Mo nodded. He could almost guess what happened next. They discovered that the couple were the so-called beasts of calamity in the eyes of the people. Although it was shocking, after an internal struggle, Uncle Murong still chose to stick to his feelings, defying the will of the world. He had to admit, Uncle Murong was a true man.

“After learning that Auntie was of the Flood Dragon Clan, Uncle Murong must have made a very difficult decision, right?” Li Mo asked.

“Not really.”

“Huh?”

“He was even more excited,” Wu Qing said, giving her husband a嗔 (chēn - a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔 look, a嗔 is a嗔
