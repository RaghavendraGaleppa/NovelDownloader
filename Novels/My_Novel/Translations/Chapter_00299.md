Chapter 299: Poisoned by a Deadly Palm, Life Hangs by a Thread; The Clever Use of Silkworm Threads to Make Wolves Devour Tigers

The interior of Zhao Lei's dwelling was filthy and reeked of foul odors, the courtyard scene chaotic. Poisonous insects and beasts crawled over the walls, and in the corners, "earthen vessels" were piled up, inside which venomous snakes, scorpions, and poisonous maggots fought and devoured one another.

Cultivators of the martial path do not seek brute strength alone. To comprehend the heavens and earth, to perceive nature, to understand the myriad paths... these are the true pursuits. While many martial artists can be cruel in temperament, this does not hinder their comprehension of the heavens. A hermit's dwelling may be bloody or terrifying... it need not be quiet, pleasant, elegant, or fresh, but one can often glimpse their understanding of the martial path from it.

Such a messy residence was proof that Zhao Lei had no foundation. Although Hao Qingshe was her master, passing on her poison arts, she had never seriously taught her.

Several "human vessels" had already died. Li Xian checked their pulses and, seeing their horrific state, could not help but feel pity. Among them, the men were from the "Flower Cage Sect," wicked villains. However, after enduring such inhuman torture, their evil debts were likely repaid. The four women were even more innocent, having been kidnapped and subjected to torture for no reason.

Li Xian suddenly paused.

One woman still had a breath of life, lingering faintly. Li Xian thought to himself, "She still has the will to live." He felt a sense of admiration. Suddenly, he heard a faint "thump-dong," the sound of the woman's chest drum vibrating, as if seeking help from the outside world.

This woman, surnamed Huang, was the first to be kidnapped. Although she was deaf and blind, she possessed the cultivation of "Food Essence." Just now, she vaguely sensed that Zhao Lei had been beaten to death, and her heart was filled with infinite joy. With the thought of death gone, she desired to live.

Li Xian said, "If you had been captured by others, you would not have suffered this disaster. The Flower Cage Sect is despicable and shameless, but they indeed do not kill women. You have the cultivation of Food Essence, and though your body is in a wretched state, if you had a treasure to nourish you, you might fully recover? Unfortunately, I do not have the wealth or the ability. Since you want to live, I should give you the chance."

His voice carried the "Chest Drum Thunder Tone," allowing her to understand his meaning.

The surviving woman, Huang, immediately responded by vibrating her chest drum. The drum sound was faint and weak, its meaning unclear, but it conveyed gratitude, pleading, and a desire to live. Her appearance was terrifying now, tortured to the point of barely looking human. Others would surely be frightened and avoid her. Li Xian, however, felt pity and was broad-minded and elegant, not disdaining her because of her appearance.

Seeing that she was alive, he carefully examined her injuries. They were severe, her life hanging by a thread. Her limbs were broken, her ears and eyes blind, and her body was covered in marks from blood-worms. Li Xian thought, "With such injuries, how could I possibly cure her? But cultivators of Food Essence have more possibilities. Their bodies can undergo metamorphosis, and even regenerating lost limbs is possible. It just requires superb medical skills and rare treasures."

Li Xian did not understand medical arts. But he knew rough methods for handling injuries, so he immediately gave her simple treatment, then spat out pure energy to eliminate the residual poison and filth. The woman, Huang, only felt her whole body refreshing, a sensation she hadn't felt for a long time. Her condition improved, and she became even more unwilling to die. Seeing her desire to live, Li Xian thought that although her injuries were severe, she might not necessarily be unable to survive. Progress would be difficult in the short term, so he first wrapped her body in a quilt and placed her in a clean spot. Then, he began to loot the poison dwelling.

Most of the items were useless. The poisonous insects and beasts were all burned and killed. Gold, silver, and jewels were hard to find, and he was unwilling to touch the poison scriptures and martial classics.

Only a few herbs had some value. Li Xian transplanted them into potted plants.

He then went to a nearby town, rented a carriage, placed the looted goods and the woman, Huang, into the carriage, and returned to the Green Ox Residence.

The woman, Huang, was breathing faintly. Having passed the initial critical stage, her condition was stable, her life was no longer in danger, and she was in a deep sleep. Li Xian had not yet decided how to arrange for her. After returning to the house, he placed her in a bed in an empty room. Then, he went to find Nan Gong Liuli.

He walked to the West Wing, but did not see her figure.

Li Xian frowned, sensing that something was wrong. He knew an accident had occurred. Nan Gong Liuli's strength was not weak, and her reputation as "Flower Without Fault" was well-known. Ordinary disciples, or even elders, would not dare to act recklessly against her. It must be that Hao Qingshe, with her unpredictable temper, had cooked up some poisonous scheme.

Li Xian was angry yet calm. He immediately went to Shi Yufei's residence. The residence was empty, with only a few beautiful consorts tending to the flowers and grass.

These consorts had seen Li Xian at the feast earlier and were still thinking of his elegance. Suddenly seeing him appear, they were surprised and said, "Ah... handsome... handsome lord, why have you come?"

Li Xian said, "I am looking for Commander Shi."

One of the consorts said, "He hasn't returned. Oh, right!" She said, "The feast just ended, and the Lord ordered us to return first. Also... your beautiful companion might be in danger. That female elder seems to want to harm her!"

Li Xian asked, "Where did he go?"

The consort said, "I'm not sure. He seemed to be heading southwest? Handsome lord... are you very worried about her?" Her beautiful eyes twinkled, full of envy.

Li Xian nodded and said, "She is my beautiful companion, but we are truly together." He stepped on the Seven Star Steps and vanished from the vicinity.

The consort stared for a long time. Even tending to the flowers and grass, she had lost interest, her heart stirred into a restless state. Li Xian headed straight southwest, his double pupils appearing, his vision greatly enhanced, scanning the mountains and fields. Fortunately, the direction the consort pointed was correct, and he soon found them.

Yan Hao, Shi Yufei, Hao Qingshe, Nan Gong Liuli, Tang Feng, Ye Sheng... were all there. There were also the Earth Altar elders, Tang Wenshu and Li Jiu...

Li Xian landed in the midst of them and said to Shi Yufei, "Commander Shi!" Shi Yufei nodded slightly and said, "You have come."

Yan Hao and the others all looked over, smiling kindly. Li Xian frowned tightly. He saw Hao Qingshe holding Nan Gong Liuli's pulse point, standing several zhang away.

Li Xian asked loudly, "Senior Hao Qingshe, what is the meaning of this? Why have you captured my beautiful companion?"

Shi Yufei said sternly, "Hao Qingshe, the duel is over, and right and wrong are already clear. What is this meaning of yours? Are you going to break your promise?"

Hao Qingshe, with her fox-like charm, giggled and said, "I am not breaking the agreement. Flower Without Fault won. He killed my disciple, what more could I say? And... do you see me harming him in the slightest?"

"Is this not fulfilling the agreement?"

Her slender fingers gently stroked Nan Gong Liuli's face as she said, "But... I have lost one disciple, so I must find another. What is wrong with that? Good disciple... if you are not good, I will turn you into a human vessel. You must perform well, join my sect, and practice the poison arts."

Li Xian said sternly, "She is my beautiful companion. You have no right to decide. If you want to take a disciple, find someone else."

Shi Yufei said solemnly, "Hao Qingshe, you have always been willful and reckless. This time, even I cannot let you do as you please anymore. Return this girl to me quickly, and I can pretend this never happened! Otherwise..."

Hao Qingshe paid no attention whatsoever. "Otherwise what?"

Shi Yufei said sternly, "Otherwise, I will expel you from the Water Altar. My small altar can no longer accommodate a great Buddha like you."

Hao Qingshe frowned. "Shi Yufei, you dare! You dare to exclude a member of the sect! This is treason."

Shi Yufei said, "Hmph, now Flower Without Fault is also a member of the Candle Cult. You first harmed a fellow sect member, and then I expel you. What is wrong with that?!" He glanced sideways at Li Xian.

Li Xian took out the Candle Order. Hao Qingshe's angry expression immediately faded. "Good, good, so you want to protect this boy at all costs. Fine then. Who let me live under someone else's command, forced to obey. I admit defeat this time."

She released Nan Gong Liuli's pulse point. Nan Gong Liuli's whole body went weak, and cold sweat flowed. Having escaped disaster, she ran towards Li Xian. She had just felt that her future was hopeless. Suddenly, Hao Qingshe flew into a rage. "I am leaving, but you dared to threaten me. How could I stand for a threat!"

She suddenly launched a killing move, stepping lightly with agility, quickly closing in, and raised her palm to strike Nan Gong Liuli. This palm strike was direct and unadorned, but it concealed many unseen techniques. Even with her exceptional agility, Nan Gong Liuli would find it extremely difficult to evade.

Shi Yufei was already on guard. His figure flickered, and he had already blocked in front of Nan Gong Liuli, raising his palm to meet the strike. Hao Qingshe suddenly retracted her strength, turned her body, did not entangle with Shi Yufei, and continued to strike towards Nan Gong Liuli.

At this moment, she had already exposed a flaw. If it were a life-and-death battle, Shi Yufei could have struck her palm down and severely wounded her. But Hao Qingshe was certain that Shi Yufei would not strike hard. He greatly respected the sect's rules. Her status in the sect was higher than his, and he dared not severely injure her.

As she expected. Although Shi Yufei saw the flaw, he held back eighty percent of his strength, aiming only to stop her from committing violence, not daring to severely injure her. Precisely because of this, Hao Qingshe, enduring the injury, was determined to kill Nan Gong Liuli. This palm strike came with fierce momentum.

Nan Gong Liuli thought to herself, "This is bad." She executed the Nan Gong family's light footwork, her figure graceful, barely dodging the blow. Hao Qingshe's palm missed, and its qi landed on a patch of grass and flowers. Instantly, the grass withered, the flowers rotted, and the decay spread dozens of zhang rapidly.

The intricacies of the palm technique were thus slightly revealed. If it had hit a person's body, how could they have survived?

Seeing her palm miss, Hao Qingshe only sneered and immediately launched another palm strike. Seeing Shi Yufei nearby, she sought speed over power to strike quickly. But she was extremely skilled in applying poison. A touch, even a fraction of it, was enough to take a life. She was confident she could kill with a single palm.

Seeing that this palm strike was unavoidable, Nan Gong Liuli's nose stung with acidity. She knew she was doomed. She thought, "This wicked woman is unpredictable, willing to endure injury just to kill me. I hate that my cultivation is shallow, allowing her to be so arrogant. To die a tragic death at her hands today, and poor my flower lord, he will be heartbroken for me. After I die from poison, I wonder how ugly I will look. I don't want him to see it. Father, Mother... my clan will not know how tragically I died..."

Her eyes grew moist, full of sorrow. Suddenly, at this moment, a person blocked in front of her, both palms actively meeting Hao Qingshe's strike.

It turned out... Hao Qingshe's sudden attack. Shi Yufei and Li Xian reacted simultaneously. Shi Yufei, with higher cultivation and faster speed, naturally moved first to block Hao Qingshe. But he was constrained by sect rules and had always been tolerant of Hao Qingshe.

Li Xian was slightly slower, but he was not far away, and in an instant, he had also arrived. Nan Gong Liuli was startled. Her cultivation was even higher than Li Xian's. Facing the poison palm, she felt there was no escape from death, so Li Xian would surely be in even greater danger. Seeing him actively block the palm, she was completely stunned and panicked, shouting "Don't," but the word "Don't" had just left her lips.

Two palms met.

Li Xian flew backward, pulling Nan Gong Liuli away with him. Commander Shi took advantage of this opening to grab Hao Qingshe's shoulder, suppressing her with his internal qi. Hao Qingshe's feet made a "thump-dong" sound as they sank deep into the mud, directly up to her knees. She could no longer launch an attack.

Shi Yufei's expression was ugly. "Flower Without Fault never had a feud with you. Why must you act so decisively!"

Hao Qingshe glanced at him with satisfaction. She had only wanted to kill his beautiful companion to grieve him. She didn't expect him to deliver himself to her. Seeing that Li Xian had been hit by the poison palm and was surely dead, she stopped pursuing the matter. She spread a poisonous mist from her hands. Shi Yufei took three steps back, and she used this opportunity to leap out of the ground. She laughed, "Why would I need a feud to deal with him? Even if he is a member of the Candle Cult, so what? Am I afraid of a mere ninth-grade order-bearer?"

She turned and left.

Shi Yufei endured his anger but did not force her to stay. He had treated Hao Qingshe with extreme indulgence and always with courtesy. He never expected this woman to be so ungrateful.

He saw Li Xian's complexion was pale and immediately checked his pulse. Nan Gong Liuli supported Li Xian, feeling that he was sweating profusely. Her expression was anxious and concerned, tears streaming from her beautiful eyes. She gently stroked his face, feeling heartbroken and cherishing him.

Thinking that his life might be hanging by a thread, she felt indescribable panic.

Shi Yufei's expression was grim. "This is the Yin Demon Heart-Eroding Palm. Hao Qingshe's strikes are always killing moves. Don't look at this palm as ordinary, it actually conceals three ethereal fairy sounds."

"The moment palms meet, the fairy sounds enter the body. They have the effect of 'lingering echoes around the bones.' At the same time, the palm qi and palm poison... all invade the body. They resonate and entangle with the fairy sounds, making the poison difficult to expel. Finally, they erode the heart meridian, causing the victim to suffer the torment of ten thousand ants gnawing at the heart."

"Fortunately... I restrained her from the side. Hao Qingshe could not use her full strength. For the sake of speed, her palm technique did not fully form, leaving a slim chance. Ye Sheng, Yan Hao, I will entrust Flower Without Fault to you..."

Nan Gong Liuli said, "Commander Shi, I want to personally care for Without Fault. I am not at ease with anyone else." She gently stroked Li Xian's face.

Shi Yufei was slightly surprised. "Alright then. Ye Sheng, Yan Hao... you two, follow my orders and go get some medicinal herbs. Nan Gong girl, I will give you a prescription later. You boil a medicinal bath and take good care of Without Fault. His injuries are severe now, do not be careless."

Li Xian's complexion was pale. He looked at himself. Although there was overbearing poison invading his body, he did not feel his life was in danger. His pure yang body and the perfection of his five organs... gave him a strong resistance to poison. Although the injuries were severe, they did not damage his foundation, nor were they life-threatening.

However... he was lying in the beauty's embrace. He might as well go with the flow. He thought, "When has anyone ever cared for me like this?" So he pretended to be unconscious, enjoying the service.

Nan Gong Liuli carried Li Xian on her back and rushed back to the Green Ox Residence. Immediately, following Shi Yufei's instructions, she prepared a large wooden barrel, filled it with clean water, and had Li Xian sit cross-legged in the barrel. She played the "Body Guarding Sound," using her ability to move qi and blood to expel the toxins as much as possible.

In less than half a quarter of an hour. The clear water turned into foul water, stinking and turbid. Nan Gong Liuli immediately poured it out and drew fresh water again. Although Li Xian felt his life was not in danger, the injuries were no trivial matter. So he seriously moved his blood, trying his best to expel the poison.

He also boiled qi and cooked purity, using the "Xun Wind Breath" martial art to inhale pure qi into his body to dissolve the poison. Using both methods, the effect was immediate. But Hao Qingshe's poison palm was extremely powerful, the poison insidious and tenacious. To completely neutralize it would require a great deal of effort.

Nan Gong Liuli guarded his side, not resting for a moment. Seeing Li Xian's pale lips, she felt indescribable distress. At night, she lit a bonfire, making the surroundings hot.

The Yin Demon Heart-Eroding Palm's毒性 was most intense at night when the yin qi was gloomy. Shi Yufei had specifically instructed that a heavy fire must be lit at night, otherwise Li Xian would have difficulty enduring this calamity. Nan Gong Liuli piled up the firewood, burning it so hot that it was scorching. She was sweating profusely but did not feel uncomfortable.

Li Xian suddenly felt the poison stirring. His whole body was cold, but activating the "Heart Fire" characteristic could alleviate it somewhat... His five organs were very strong, and his ability to expel and neutralize poison was not comparable to that of an ordinary person. Moreover, both the "Perfect Physique" and the "Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword" possessed abilities to resist poison and heal.

The martial arts he had obtained in the past were all put to use.

That night. A total of seventy-nine barrels of poisonous water were changed, but the situation had stabilized. The next morning, Ye Sheng and Tang Feng both brought herbs. There were quite a few expensive ones.

The two checked Li Xian's injuries and were both surprised. Checking his pulse, they only felt his body's blood was abundant, and a trend of recovery was gradually forming. His life was no longer in danger. Nan Gong Liuli boiled the medicinal soup and fed it to Li Xian. Seeing his injuries gradually recovering, she finally showed a smile.

Li Xian's injuries were extremely severe, and he could not yet practice martial arts. He could only slack off for a few days, lying sideways on Nan Gong Liuli's lap, enjoying the beauty's service.

Nan Gong Liuli said softly, "Good brother, are you feeling better?" Li Xian said, "Sister Liuli, I am much better." He had wanted to make a joke and take some advantage, but seeing Nan Gong Liuli's eyes full of concern, he felt he couldn't bear to, so he told the truth.

Li Xian said, "This little poison can't do anything to me."

Nan Gong Liuli let out a heavy breath. "That's good, that's good. Good brother, you really scared your sister to death. If you died, your sister would have to follow you." Her voice was light, but it concealed determination.

Li Xian was startled. "Sister Liuli, there's no need for that. I am used to being free and easy. Even if I go to the underworld, I will be happy and carefree. Why implicate you?"

Nan Gong Liuli laughed. "Silly brother, if you are free and easy in the underworld, would you leave me here to suffer? Besides, although you are glorious outside, you still need someone to serve you."

Nan Gong Liuli said shyly, "When you recover, no matter how you want your sister to serve you, your sister... will obey you."

Li Xian laughed. "Really?" Nan Gong Liuli nodded shyly. "Really. Your sister serving you, your sister is actually very happy."

Li Xian said, "The Flower Cage Sect gave me quite a few books on bedroom arts. When I recover, Sister Liuli... will you teach me?" Nan Gong Liuli scolded playfully, "Little rascal." She was too embarrassed to talk about this, but how could she bear to refuse? She said softly, "I'll teach you then. You... this kind of thing, you have always been the one teaching me. How did it get reversed? It's... it's so embarrassing."

Li Xian said, "That's right... Sister Liuli, I saved a woman yesterday. Help me go see her."

Nan Gong Liuli said, "A woman?" She helped Li Xian up and walked to the west wing. Li Xian smelled the fragrance of her hair and looked at Nan Gong Liuli's charming profile. He suddenly thought:

"In this life, I lack for nothing, but these beauty debts are somewhat difficult to repay."

He didn't know whether to be happy or worried.

Pushing open the door, Nan Gong Liuli saw the situation on the bed and let out an "Ah!" of surprise. Li Xian explained the events. Hearing this, Nan Gong Liuli was greatly indignant, wishing she could stab Zhao Lei several times to vent her hatred. She was even more fortunate that she had encountered Li Xian. If she had fallen into the hands of someone else, her fate would have been tragically unspeakable. How could there be such tenderness and joy?

Nan Gong Liuli thought to herself, "Without Fault was trapped in the Flower Cage Sect. By identity, he is already a great flower thief. But his heart is kind, not pedantic. This is something many famous orthodox sects cannot compare to. Saving this woman yesterday is no different from saving me in the past. But I am luckier, meeting Brother Without Fault earlier." She was very moved.

She became even more determined. "Good brother, how can we help her?"

Li Xian said, "She is too pitiful. I am poisoned and not in a good state to care for her. I want to ask you to do it on my behalf."

Nan Gong Liuli hummed softly. "Your words are too distant. You and I, why use the word 'ask'?"

Li Xian said, "Good sister, I am clumsy with my words. I said the wrong thing. Please forgive me." Nan Gong Liuli's heart softened. Seeing Li Xian so seriously injured, he still had to speak softly to comfort her. She was being petty, which was truly inappropriate. She felt very guilty for a moment. "It's my fault, but don't... don't be so polite to me."

Nan Gong Liuli sighed. "But lying like this, it's a fate worse than death."

Li Xian asked, "Sister Liuli is knowledgeable. Is there a medicine to cure this kind of injury?" Nan Gong Liuli said, "She already has the cultivation of Food Essence. Logically speaking, she can recover completely. But to truly recover, the cost is terrifying!"

"Something you and I cannot afford."

Li Xian said, "Let's just let her injuries heal. Perhaps there will be another opportunity. As the saying goes, one who survives a great disaster will have great fortune later. For her to survive this, perhaps she has another blessing."

Nan Gong Liuli nodded. She went to cook some plain congee, first feeding Li Xian. Then she helped the woman, Huang, wash her body, cleaned the pus and blood, and fed her plain congee.

In this way, after another day of care, Li Xian was able to get out of bed and walk. He began practicing the "Jade Avoiding True Art" in the inner courtyard. This martial art is a "health-preserving art," not requiring grand movements, aiming to nurture the whole body, like a trickle of water.

For recovering from injuries and illness, it has great advantages.

[Jade Avoiding True Art]

[Proficiency: 6/700 (Entry)]

The lingering poison was deep, but it could not damage his foundation. Li Xian, seeking to be safe, feared that Hao Qingshe, knowing he was not dead, would launch a sudden attack again, making it harder to guard against. So he told Nan Gong Liuli that he was on the verge of death.

His thinking was meticulous. Nan Gong Liuli deeply admired this and acted accordingly. When Ye Sheng, Tang Feng, and other elders came to check, she made this claim. After the news spread, the disciples on the island all expressed their regret.

Shi Yufei was busy preparing for Hao Qingshe's departure from the island and did not come to check. Two more days passed in this way. Li Xian's five organs were strong, he moved the turbid and pure, and rested to recover his energy. His injuries were seventy percent healed. Nan Gong Liuli also had the leisure to tend to the flowers and grass.

That day.

Han Zisha came to visit, holding some rare grapes. Nan Gong Liuli went to receive her. She did not like this elder much, but her surface courtesy was adequate, not losing her grace.

Han Zisha said, "I didn't expect Flower Without Fault to be such a rare good man. He actually sacrificed himself to save a beauty, truly rare. What a pity... life is just so unpredictable."

Seeing Li Xian was dying, she felt both regretful and emotional. Her trip also had the intention of scheming for the "Bee Farm" and "Fruit Grove." She used her feminine charm to build a close relationship with Nan Gong Liuli. Nan Gong Liuli, as the daughter of a noble family, was well-versed in socializing and easily fended her off, sending Han Zisha out of the residence.

Watching Han Zisha's graceful and charming gait, she couldn't help but pout, secretly cursing her as a seductive thief woman.

Two more days passed.

Li Xian had recovered ninety percent. Having just recovered from a serious illness, his body felt especially energetic, and his spirit was even more vigorous.

"The Five Organs Expelling Turbid and Meeting Yang Meridian is truly powerful. If not for this meridian's help, even with my Perfect Physique and Pure Yang Body, I would not have recovered so quickly!"

He felt even more the wonder of this meridian.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Han Zisha had come to visit again, wanting to see Li Xian. She said, "Sister Liuli, I have some great news to tell Brother Hua in person. If he hasn't died yet, hurry and take me to him."

Nan Gong Liuli knew Han Zisha had come again to probe Li Xian's condition. So she led the way to Li Xian's bedroom. Han Zisha pretended to be sad, threw herself by the bed, and tears fell on command. "Oh dear, Brother Hua... you... you are so tragic. It's also my fault for not being there at the time. Otherwise, I would have helped you, and you... you wouldn't have been so badly injured!"

Li Xian pretended to say in a trembling voice, "Elder Han... my life hangs by a thread... everyone has their own fate, there is no need for regret."

Han Zisha heard his weak voice. She also thought about how powerful Hao Qingshe was, how could Li Xian be fine? So she didn't think deeply about it. "You are so young, to die like this is truly a pity. You know, we humans, we bring nothing when we are born, and take nothing when we die. What are we really striving for?"

Li Xian sighed. "Yes, only at the end of my life do I understand this truth."

Han Zisha said, "Don't be sad. Commander Shi has already sought justice for you. This morning, he expelled Hao Qingshe from the island. She has already sailed far away."

Li Xian's eyes lit up. "Really?" Han Zisha said, "Of course it's true. But... before you go, have you thought about the Bee Farm..." She was about to reveal her true intentions, coveting the Bee Farm and Fruit Grove.

But she saw Li Xian lift the quilt, get up cheerfully, and stretch. Han Zisha was stunned. "You... you..."

Li Xian laughed. "I am in high spirits because of happy news. Look... the poison has suddenly healed. It seems the Bee Farm and Fruit Grove don't need to be divided. Hahaha."

Nan Gong Liuli covered her mouth and laughed. Han Zisha's expression was resentful. She immediately figured it out, helplessly stomping her foot, annoyed that Li Xian had tricked her. But she thought that if Li Xian had really died, it would have been a pity.

She muttered a few words and left in a huff.

Nan Gong Liuli gently patted her chest. "This matter is finally over." Li Xian said, "Over? Not necessarily."

Nan Gong Liuli quickly asked, "You still want revenge? Don't be hasty. That woman's strength is formidable. Don't act on a moment of courage."

Li Xian smiled meaningfully. "If I have the ability in the future, I will naturally take revenge. But... as the saying goes,恶人更需恶人磨 (a villain needs a greater villain to grind her). I hope she doesn't meet an even more wicked villain."

In the Heaven and Earth Box, a few strands of silkworm thread were missing.
