# Chapter 97: Hired a Bandit Cultivator as a Bodyguard?

"Senior Brother, is this the shortcut you mentioned?"

Looking at the dense pack of gray wolves in the mountain forest, Bian Chuyao couldn't help but smile bitterly as she turned to Gu Yuan beside her.

She felt like she'd been tricked.

Gu Yuan's masterful "kill-and-burn" technique had shocked her earlier, and she'd unconsciously followed him onto this so-called "shortcut."

But as they progressed, she realized this path was fraught with dangers no less perilous than the route she'd originally planned to Yunlan Valley. Most importantly, they were deviating further and further from their intended destination.

The winding stone steps seemed to lead to some other secret place.

What shortcut? It was clearly just Gu Yuan's excuse—he must have another purpose.

"Don't worry, all roads lead to the same destination. As long as we keep moving forward, we'll reach Yunlan Valley eventually," Gu Yuan replied with a light chuckle.

From the very beginning, he had never forgotten his primary goal in coming to the Zhongshan Secret Realm.

The Three Hearts Seal was his ultimate objective.

Helping Bian Chuyao was merely a means to an end—a way to leverage resources.

He wouldn't go back on his word, but neither would he prioritize her goals over his own.

Bian Chuyao wanted to use his strength to navigate the dangers of Yunlan Mountain, but wasn't he doing the same?

Originally, Gu Yuan had planned to help Bian Chuyao obtain the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit before searching for the Three Hearts Seal. But after hearing her mention that others might also be competing for the fruit, he grew wary and decided to retrieve the late Sanfa Shangren's hidden treasure first.

Perhaps this expedition would further enhance his strength.

Even if it didn't, securing the Three Hearts Seal would at least settle one matter. If they encountered formidable enemies while collecting the golden fruit, he could make his escape without worrying about the seal.

In short, securing his own gains first was the priority.

"Senior Brother, Yunlan Valley is filled with countless spirit herbs. Why take such a detour?"

"Help me retrieve the golden fruit first, and I'll give you another thousand spirit stones as reward!"

Realizing she was being used, Bian Chuyao couldn't afford to turn hostile after witnessing Gu Yuan's strength, so she tried to persuade him gently.

But Gu Yuan merely smiled.

The Body Seal technique was a rare and invaluable treasure—a strategic resource that couldn't be measured in mere spirit stones.

Spirit stones could only buy common items, while truly precious things were priceless and beyond the market.

"Junior Sister, don't worry. Following this path will lead us to Yunlan Valley. I won't break my promise!" Gu Yuan reassured Bian Chuyao as his Peach Sword Seal flashed brilliantly, swiftly dispatching the leaping wolves.

"Roar!"

At the same time, two massive wolves, each several zhang tall, charged toward them from the forest, their foul stench carried by the wind.

Their formidable aura marked them as peak upper-tier demonic beasts.

Gu Yuan summoned a lotus phantom around himself and engaged one of the wolves, leaving the other for Bian Chuyao.

"Wah wah wah! Little Miss, I told you not to team up with this big villain! Now look, he's treating you like a bodyguard!"

"Evil, evil! All those spirit herbs and precious pills you gave him were wasted!"

"Just look at his technique—this guy must be a seasoned killer! If we run into real danger at Yunlan Valley, he'll probably be the first to flee!"

Several spirit creatures clung to Bian Chuyao's delicate ears, indignantly complaining on her behalf.

Bian Chuyao sighed inwardly, but with the giant wolf lunging at her, she had no choice but to activate her crimson sword seal and counterattack.

As the spirits replenished her spiritual energy to help her slay the beast, they whispered in her ear:

"Little Miss, this guy may be rotten to the core, but he's cunning. If he's going to such lengths to come here, there must be something valuable. Let's rob him later and teach him a lesson!"

"Yes, yes! Rob him! That'll show him!"

Bian Chuyao remained silent, but curiosity stirred within her.

What treasure could be so important that Gu Yuan would take such risks?

But as if sensing her thoughts, Gu Yuan suddenly turned and flashed her a grin.

"Huh?"

A bad premonition struck Bian Chuyao.

"Roar!!"

The giant wolf that had been fighting Gu Yuan suddenly went berserk, its eyes turning blood-red. It abandoned Gu Yuan and lunged at Bian Chuyao instead.

At the same time, howls echoed through the forest as countless demonic beasts, drawn by some strange scent, surged toward her.

"Junior Sister, I leave this to you. I'll be back soon," Gu Yuan said before vanishing into the woods.

"Gu Yuan!"

Bian Chuyao's usual gentle and composed demeanor shattered as she shouted after him in frustration.

---

But Gu Yuan was already gone.

Only the approaching shadows of demonic beasts remained.

Bian Chuyao seethed with anger. She never expected that Gu Yuan, who had appeared so refined and upright in the Dao Academy, would transform into a completely different person inside the secret realm.

Not only was he ruthless and well-versed in bandit techniques, but now he had abandoned her and disappeared on his own!

Had she really hired a bandit cultivator as her bodyguard?

Clenching her teeth, she touched her waist, tempted to use her trump card. But remembering that the golden fruit was still unclaimed and that her "old acquaintance" from Luoxia Sect had yet to appear, she suppressed the impulse.

"Gu Yuan, if you don't come back, I'll have my grandfather hunt you to the ends of the earth!"

Her furious cry pierced through the demonic roars in the forest.

---

"In the thousand-year history of the Dao Academy, no Golden Core elder has ever attacked a Qi Refinement disciple…"

Hearing her shout, Gu Yuan merely chuckled before speeding toward the location marked on the jade slip left by Sanfa Daoren.

The Three Hearts Seal was too important to risk Bian Chuyao discovering it, so he had no choice but to inconvenience her temporarily.

Thanks to the demon-attracting powder he'd used, most of the beasts were now drawn toward Bian Chuyao, clearing his path.

Before long, he arrived before a cliff overgrown with weeds and deadwood.

The cliff was eerily silent, as if shielded by an invisible barrier. Not a single demonic beast lingered nearby—only a few skeletal remains, likely those of past cultivators, lay scattered at its base.

"Rumble—!"

Gu Yuan remained cautious as he channeled his spiritual energy and pushed open the "cliff" according to the jade slip's instructions.

The "cliff" was actually just a stone gate.

With a thunderous roar and a cloud of dust, the gate swung open, revealing a spacious cave.

"Boom!"

But at that moment, a silver fist, wreathed in sharp sword energy, shot toward Gu Yuan's face.
