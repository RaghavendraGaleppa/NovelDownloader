# Chapter 8: The First Escort Mission Ends in Ambush

In the following days, the chief manager of the escort agency only met Lin Shan briefly, offering a few words of encouragement before leaving. 

Lin Shan was then assigned to work under Head Escort Wang. The Lin Family Escort Agency wasn't exclusively staffed by members of the Lin family—they also recruited elite professionals from the industry. 

Within the agency, there were three head escorts. Head Escort Wang commanded over a dozen escorts, thirty-odd scouts, and fifty miscellaneous workers, totaling more than a hundred people. 

He was the only first-class expert among the three head escorts, renowned throughout Qinghe County and the strongest in the agency. The manager, a direct descendant of the Lin family, didn't participate in escort missions and was solely responsible for operations, often consulting Head Escort Wang on important matters.

New recruits were typically placed under Head Escort Wang's command to reduce casualties and allow them to grow quickly, as escort work was a dangerous profession that involved risking one's life.

Half a month later, Lin Shan stood on the steps of the escort agency's main gate, dressed in a brand-new escort uniform and holding a newly issued ring-pommel saber. He chatted with a sixty-year-old man beside him—Escort Pu, the oldest among Head Escort Wang's team.

Escort Pu had been refining his internal strength for decades and had forty years of experience in the field. Lin Shan had spent the past ten days humbly learning from him, gradually building a rapport.

"Master Pu, we've been idle for half a month. When are we finally going on a mission?" Lin Shan asked.

Escort Pu puffed on his pipe, exhaling thick smoke through his nostrils like two long, curling dragons that enveloped Lin Shan's face. 

Lin Shan coughed a few times—secondhand smoke had been his nemesis even in his past life—but he forced a smile and endured it in front of his senior.

"No need to rush, young man. You're always so impatient," Escort Pu said leisurely between puffs. "In a few days, we'll be transporting goods for the government to Zangke County. Everyone under Head Escort Wang will be mobilized—you included."

Lin Shan quickly stepped forward and dutifully refilled Escort Pu's tobacco. 

"Does that mean all hundred of us will be going? That's a huge operation. Will Head Escort Wang be leading us?"

"Obviously! This government shipment is critical. Head Escort Wang will personally oversee it to deter any troublemakers."

Lin Shan grinned. "Then I'll be counting on your guidance along the way, Master Pu."

Escort Pu chuckled and blew out another cloud of smoke. "You little rascal! Just stick close to me and stay sharp!"

"Got it!"

Several days later, a long procession exited the southern gate of Qinghe County. 

A caravan of mules and horses stretched over a hundred paces, escorted by over a hundred armed men guarding more than a dozen covered wagons. The cargo was concealed under oilcloth, its contents unknown.

Lin Shan rode alongside Escort Pu on one of the wagons, chatting idly while the laborers walked alongside and scouts on horseback patrolled the perimeter.

For several days, they traveled uneventfully, stopping at towns along the way for supplies. The atmosphere gradually relaxed, and even the laborers began joking among themselves.

"I heard the agency will make a huge profit after this government job."

"All that money will just go into the bosses' pockets. What's it got to do with us small fry?"

"Head Escort Wang promised that if we deliver the goods safely to Zangke County, we'll get three days to enjoy ourselves—all expenses paid by the agency."

"Nice! I've heard there are slave traders near the southern borders of Zangke who capture barbarian women and sell them to brothels. Maybe we can—"

At noon, under the scorching sun, the caravan stopped just beyond the borders of Qinghe County. Ahead lay a narrow mountain path flanked by lush hills, with towering peaks in the distance. 

Since this was the only route into Zangke, scouts were sent ahead to ensure safety.

"Any word from the scouts?" A square-jawed man—Head Escort Wang—peered out from the central wagon.

His mounted attendant replied, "No reports yet, sir!"

"How long has it been?"

"About a quarter-hour."

Frowning, Head Escort Wang surveyed the exhausted crew, then turned to their guide. 

"How far to Zangke County?"

"About 150 li. There's a town about 30 li ahead where we can rest."

After checking the map, Head Escort Wang decided not to wait. "Forget the scouts. Let's push forward—we'll rest in town."

The caravan cheered and resumed its journey.

As they entered the valley, Lin Shan, drowsing against the wagon, was startled awake by a sharp whistle. 

Birds erupted from the trees in all directions.

"What was that?"

"Not sure. Does this valley have a name?"

"I think it's called 'Phoenix Fall Slope.'"

"That doesn't sound very auspicious..."

Before Lin Shan could react, an arrow thudded into the wagon frame beside his head, its shaft still quivering.

"Shit!" He scrambled down, clutching his ear in shock—the arrow had nearly taken his head off.

Then the air filled with whistling arrows.

"Ambush!" 

Panic erupted. Horses reared, men screamed, and arrows found their marks. 

Lin Shan dove under the nearest wagon—only to find Escort Pu already there, calmly retrieving a water pouch.

"Master Pu?!"

"Quiet, kid." 

Lin Shan suppressed a groan. So much for looking out for me!

As the arrows ceased, black-clad bandits swarmed from the trees, attacking without hesitation.

"Who dares oppose the Lin Family Escort Agency?" Head Escort Wang's voice boomed as he leapt into battle, his spear felling two bandits instantly.

A masked leader emerged, engaging Head Escort Wang in a fierce duel while directing his men.

Lin Shan watched, sweating. The bandits were overwhelming the escorts.

"Master Pu! What do we do?"

Escort Pu studied the fight. "Head Escort Wang's losing. Stay put."

"But if he falls, we're done for!"

A scream cut through the chaos as a bandit wiped his blade clean—then locked eyes with Lin Shan under the wagon.
