# Chapter 179: Ginseng

His breathing seemed to connect heaven and earth. In the rhythm of three long and two short breaths, a faint mist rose around him.

Any martial artist with discerning eyes would see that the mist was actually sweat from his pores condensing in the cold—a sign that his blood and qi were operating at their limit.

Unknowingly, dawn began to brighten the horizon. Xu Yunfan pressed his tongue against his upper palate, and a long, dragon-like cry leaked from between his teeth.

Pure Yang internal energy crept out from deep within his flesh and blood. A scorching warmth plowed through his muscles and tendons, carving out channels.

Wherever it passed, the muscles on his arms suddenly tightened like a fully drawn bull-horn bow, with each muscle strand standing out distinctly like twisted steel strings.

As the morning glow spread over the mountain ridge and shone upon him, his Adam's apple rolled, like a sword-swallowing guest swallowing a nine-foot green blade.

A hint of refreshing coolness suddenly welled up in his throat, like snow water soaking through a thousand-year-old moss. It wound down his esophagus like an ice-blue stream, falling into his stomach before rapidly dispersing into his flesh and blood, where it was assimilated by the circulating Pure Yang internal energy.

The instant it entered, his chest cavity suddenly expanded by three inches, and the strip-like muscles on his ribs bulged up like iron bars.

The absorbed morning purple qi, carrying a far greater quantity of Primordial Spirit energy than ever before, rushed into his body, forming scorching vortices within his muscles, skin, and membranes.

If one were to peel back the skin and look closely, they would see the muscle fibers trembling at a high frequency with an amplitude imperceptible to the naked eye. Impurities within his body were being expelled through his pores as black sweat.

"Hah!"

When the morning sun completely rose above the horizon, Xu Yunfan slowly withdrew his stance. The Pure Yang internal energy, which had been largely depleted, was now fully replenished, and was even several times more robust than before.

The gentle aura emitted by the Pure Yang internal energy as it roamed through his flesh and blood was like winter snow meeting spring, melting and flowing through his bones and tendons, nourishing them until even his bones emitted a faint cicada-like hum.

A cicada hum from his bones and tendons!

Even after he withdrew his stance, the strange phenomena around his body had yet to fade. The rising heat waves steamed the morning dew into a haze, and his exposed skin shimmered with the dull luster of aged copper.

*'You are practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Art in a place where mountain terrain converges. Your cultivation is enhanced. Each time you circulate the Pure Yang One Qi Art, you obtain a far greater amount of Primordial Spirit energy than before. Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Art has increased significantly.'*

*'You are in a...'* (Repeated effect)

Three notifications. An increase of twelve points!

*'Pure Yang One Qi Art, 42/1000 (Minor Accomplishment)*

*Special Effects: Pure Yang Purple Qi (Stage 1), Qi Armor (Stage 1), Recovery (Stage 2)'*

Glancing at the jumping proficiency of the Pure Yang One Qi Art on his attribute panel, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grin. If he had known this would happen, he should have leveled his mining skill to Major Accomplishment earlier.

Just look at it. If he had this kind of phenomenon when practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Art before, he would probably be close to the third layer by now.

What a waste of time.

He would be careful next time.

Xu Yunfan's ears twitched slightly, and his gaze shifted downward.

The sound of iron and stone striking suddenly came from the southeast.

Someone was destroying the local terrain's flow. If it were destroyed, the terrain would be cut off and obstructed, and the magnetic field of the mountains would change. The Primordial Spirit energy accumulated here would likely disperse instantly because of it.

This place was the closest and best spot to the Heavenly Work Cave. If it were dug up, the next closest place with similar terrain would be over a hundred miles away along the mountain range.

He leaped down from the cliff, landing without a sound, like a willow catkin drifting down.

He saw seven bare-chested men digging into the rock layer. Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over these men who were burying their heads and grunting as they dug.

His eyebrows raised slightly.

The 'Kites' from Beimang Mountain in Yanbei Dao were everywhere, it seemed.

These grave robbers, though considered a martial sect, spent their days钻 underground and rarely walked the Jianghu. The one he met in the ghost market outside Beiye City in Qingzhou back then seemed to have stayed because an artifact was unearthed in the ghost market, but in the end, he had a stroke of madness and tried to pull a double-cross.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the crisscrossing vermilion threads and red cords between the rock crevices. Three-inch iron nails were pinned in the Nine Palace positions, and each red cord was tied with a bronze bell.

Though he didn't know what kind of formation it was, with his current insight, he could naturally see that such extensive preparations were clearly a setup to trap something.

"Sulfur mixed with vermilion qi. Aren't you guys afraid of blood poison attacking your heart?"

The sound of Xu Yunfan's sole crushing a few sulfur pebbles was particularly clear in the cave.

The leader, a middle-aged man called the 'Lamp Holder,' turned around abruptly upon hearing this. Seeing Xu Yunfan standing silently behind the group, the centipede scar on his left cheek twisted with his facial muscles. The seven fine steel mole-claws at his waist trembled lightly with his breathing.

A broken hemp rope in the northwest corner suddenly went taut, and the copper bell tied to it rang out.

"Reinforce the southeast corner with three strands of red cord! The Eight Gates Escape Chain is leaking there!"

The scar-faced man barked an order. A pockmarked man didn't dare to delay and immediately threw out a barbed net made of three copper nails wrapped in red thread.

Xu Yunfan noticed a faint green smoke rising from the crevices in the rock—a sign of sulfur powder mixed with saltpeter.

The so-called "Eight Gates Escape Chain" was actually a common series of机关 (traps) used by the Beimang Mountain crew. The intersections of the red cords hid gunpowder fuses, and the bronze bells were filled with soul-confusing powder.

Seeing that the formation was secure, the Lamp Holder finally let out a sigh of relief. He straightened his back and cupped his fists toward Xu Yunfan. "Honored one from the Heavenly Work Cave, we are only here to dig up some wild ginseng. We are deeply sorry for the disturbance!"

Seeing that the man had immediately identified his origin and was speaking so politely, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't put on a stern face.

He said calmly, "With Ghost Cry Abyss as the center, the surrounding thirty miles are all under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Work Cave. Sir, are you unaware of this? A few days ago, the capital of Shu Prefecture, Rong City, posted notices all over the states of Lingnan Dao."

Seeing the middle-aged man's expression darken slightly, Xu Yunfan changed his tone. "I'm not here to make things difficult for you. It's just digging up some wild ginseng. But this very spot is a convergence point for the surrounding mountain terrain. For you to destroy the terrain and sever the terrain's node is somewhat unethical. To put it more seriously... you are destroying the Heavenly Work Cave's Feng Shui!"

With such a heavy hat placed on his head, even the experienced Lamp Holder couldn't help but change his expression.

"A three-hundred-year-old wild ginseng can replenish qi and blood with some medicinal supplements, and can be used to sustain a life. I have a brother lying in bed, and this is the only thing missing. I hope, sir, you can be flexible."

As the Lamp Holder spoke, he pulled out a stack of silver bills from his chest. A rough look suggested it was no less than a thousand taels of silver.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered. These fellows who dug into the ground were all very wealthy. His expression softened slightly, and he was about to speak.

Suddenly, a rustling sound came from deep within the rock layer, and a few pebbles fell from the ceiling.

Xu Yunfan's ears twitched, identifying the sound of a small animal scrambling through the cracks in the rocks.

But the Lamp Holder didn't have time to say more. He immediately stepped forward and threw three mole-claws. The fine steel claw tips dug into the rock crevices and pulled out a silk net soaked in anesthetic.

A palm-sized, exquisite figure was suddenly caught by the net, which was made of an unknown material, and revealed its form.

Xu Yunfan saw it clearly. Wrapped in the net was clearly a small child wearing a red bellyband, with a few blades of grass growing from its head, and ginseng threads covering its four wrists. Its entire body looked like it had been finely carved from jade.
