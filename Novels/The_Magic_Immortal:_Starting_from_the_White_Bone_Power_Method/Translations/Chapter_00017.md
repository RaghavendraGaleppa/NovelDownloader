# Chapter 17: Five-Needle Seal  

Upon witnessing the scene, Wang Chan instinctively retreated behind the others.  

At that moment, mournful wails seemed to emanate from within the white-robed man's body, as if a chilling wind howled through his bones. Wisps of yin energy billowed his robes outward.  

Ning Jingming hastily cast the Sunlight Purification Spell again.  

Unexpectedly, the yin energy seemed sentient—as the golden radiance approached, it all withdrew into the white-robed man's body, hiding in some unknown crevice where the spell's light couldn't reach. Once the radiance faded, the yin energy emerged once more.  

"There's a yin wind blowing through my bones!"  

Despite his delicate, almost feminine appearance, the white-robed man was remarkably tough. Though his body convulsed, he gritted his teeth and endured.  

Ning Jingming ceased his spellcasting and instead began questioning the man in detail, receiving clear answers.  

"It's the Bone-Corroding Yin Wind technique! Though only a low-grade ability, this yin wind can seep into the bones and roam freely. The golden light of the Sunlight Purification Spell cannot penetrate bone—it's useless here." Ning Jingming's expression darkened. "This technique shows no signs before striking. I was careless."  

Watching this, Wang Chan couldn't help but recall the Crimson Venom technique that had afflicted Iron Daoist's partner—equally insidious.  

These demonic beasts and spectral entities truly were vicious.  

"Since Brother Ning recognizes this Bone-Corroding Yin Wind, you must know how to dispel it," the white-robed man said calmly.  

"The technique's mark is imprinted on your forehead. If I withdraw the Sunlight Purification Spell, the yin wind will cycle through your bones before returning to the mark, repeating the process until your bones are eroded completely."  

Ning Jingming's grave words sent a chill through the onlookers. After a moment of contemplation, he continued, "There is a solution. I can summon a friend skilled in sealing techniques. When the yin wind cycles back, he can seal the mark on your forehead. Once sealed, my spell will take effect."  

"My senior brother's condition is dire. How long until your friend arrives?" asked the black-robed woman with a sharp face, urgency in her voice.  

"I'll have Brother Wang continue stabilizing his vitality with needles while my spell mitigates the damage," Ning Jingming replied, forcing calm into his tone. "Sending someone to fetch my friend will take about an hour."  

"The Bone-Corroding Yin Wind has already erupted. My senior brother may not last an hour," the yellow-robed woman with an oval face said coldly. "And what if your friend can't come within that time?"  

Ning Jingming fell silent. Though his expression remained steady, frustration churned within him.  

---  

What might happen within that hour was unpredictable. At best, he could ensure the man's survival.  

But if the white-robed man suffered irreversible harm, Ning Jingming would bear the blame. As a disciple of the Hundred Talismans Sect, the man's allies would surely seek vengeance.  

Seeing Ning Jingming's hesitation, Wang Chan inwardly sighed.  

The responsibility would fall on Ning Jingming, but Wang Chan would inevitably be implicated.  

Worse still, even in the best-case scenario, he wouldn't be able to leave for another hour—forcing him to travel at night, an exceedingly dangerous prospect.  

Examining the white-robed man again, Wang Chan noted that the Bone-Corroding Yin Wind was only a low-grade technique. He spoke up, "If the yin wind could be sealed long enough for Brother Ning to dispel it, how much time would you need?"  

"Ten breaths at most!" Ning Jingming answered confidently.  

"Time is critical. Let me try first. If I fail, we can still summon your friend," Wang Chan declared.  

All eyes turned to him.  

The yellow-robed and black-robed women eyed him skeptically, noting his early Qi Refining cultivation and inferior mana quality.  

Even Ning Jingming looked doubtful.  

Wang Chan was known in Black River Market for his Revival Needles, but when had he mastered sealing techniques?  

Sealing methods and artifacts were rare, and even ordinary seals might not suffice against the Bone-Corroding Yin Wind.  

"Then I entrust myself to Brother Wang's efforts," the white-robed man said decisively, clasping his hands. "You shall be duly rewarded."  

Impressed by the man's resolve, Wang Chan acknowledged his courage—a true disciple of a major sect.  

With the patient's consent, the others held their tongues.  

Just then, tendrils of greenish energy swirled like a vortex across the man's face, converging into the yin markings—the Bone-Corroding Yin Wind was cycling back.  

"My apologies!" Wang Chan immediately summoned his Withering-Life Needles.  

Previously, he had used their Wood Qi for healing, earning them the name Revival Needles.  

But now, he channeled their Grave Yin energy, the artifact's inscriptions glowing a withered yellow.  

---  

In an instant, twenty-one yellowed inscriptions shimmered and merged seamlessly into a flawless whole.  

"A fully inscribed artifact!" Qi Yizhi gasped.  

"An artifact embodying both vitality and decay!" Ning Jingming murmured in astonishment.  

Ignoring their reactions, Wang Chan focused entirely on his task. With a flick of his wrist—  

First needle!  

Second!  

Third!  

The silver needles formed a triangular formation around the yin markings on the man's forehead. Withered-yellow sealing patterns spread across his face, intertwining with the yin energy.  

Yet the Bone-Corroding Yin Wind proved formidable. Despite Wang Chan's efforts, wisps of the wind threatened to escape through gaps in the seal.  

Previously, Wang Chan had never revealed more than three needles in public—keeping his true capabilities hidden was a matter of survival.  

But now, three were insufficient.  

"Now!"  

Abandoning caution, Wang Chan swept his sleeve, unleashing two more needles.  

Hiss—  

The escaping yin wind was instantly contained, forced back into the seal.  

Five needles now formed an unbreakable barrier.  

"Brother Ning, strike now!" Wang Chan shouted.  

The five-needle seal had consumed eighteen units of his mana. Combined with earlier expenditures, only two remained—leaving him drained.  

Without hesitation, he swallowed a Spirit Nourishing Elixir to replenish his energy.  

"A five-needle seal! Brother Wang, your skill is peerless!" Ning Jingming laughed heartily and unleashed the Sunlight Purification Spell, golden incantations flooding the white-robed man's forehead.
