# Chapter 2: The Mysterious Stone Liquid  

No honor among thieves!  

Senior Brother Yang never expected that his "heartfelt" speech of "self-sacrifice" would be met with such cold-blooded aggression.  

The pale, broad palm radiated surging mana, its scorching heat unmistakably signaling a genuine intent to kill.  

*Damn this brat! Five months of "genuine affection," and not a shred of it moved you!*  

Yang cursed inwardly, yet his hands moved with equal swiftness. The haze in his eyes vanished instantly.  

*Crack!*  

His aged right hand erupted with mana far more potent than Gu Yuan's. A phantom of a cyan seal flickered into existence, faintly revealing the silhouette of a green crane. A peculiar sharpness permeated the air, making it hiss as if in pain.  

*Creak…*  

But at that moment, the black Spirit-Severing Ring on his wrist flared with a murky glow. Its powerful restraints disrupted the flow of his mana, tightening around his wrist until it nearly crushed the bone.  

Excruciating pain surged through his meridians. Beads of cold sweat dotted Yang’s forehead, yet he endured it, shaping his right hand into a cone and thrusting it toward Gu Yuan’s incoming palm.  

*Boom!*  

A burst of cyan light and scattered sparks exploded in the dark cavern.  

Yang’s expression darkened as he staggered back a step, his right hand now bearing faint scorch marks.  

Though his strength far surpassed Gu Yuan’s, the injuries from the sect war and the Spirit-Severing Ring’s suppression left him no better off in this clash.  

Gu Yuan, on the other hand, was tall, robust, and brimming with vitality. Even after months of torment in this lightless prison, his physical foundation remained superior to Yang’s aged body.  

And with the advantage of a surprise attack, Gu Yuan had seized the upper hand from the outset.  

Yang’s heart sank.  

He had feigned weakness today, hoping to lure Gu Yuan close for a fatal strike, fearing that delay would only worsen his disadvantage.  

Yet, he hadn’t anticipated Gu Yuan’s ruthlessness—attacking without even letting him finish his "dying words."  

*What a treacherous little bastard!*  

But now that the fight had begun, there was no turning back.  

One of them had to die—an offering to secure survival.  

"Die!"  

Yang’s face flushed crimson. Ignoring the Spirit-Severing Ring’s torment, he forced his mana to surge. A tiny sword seal, no longer than an inch, materialized in his left palm.  

The seal shimmered like a fragment of jade-green grass, radiant yet deadly.  

The Spirit-Severing Ring shrieked in protest, its restraints tightening to the point of cracking bone.  

This sword seal seemed to test the ring’s limits, pushing its suppression to the extreme. Yang’s meridians strained to the breaking point, the agony turning his vision red and blurry.  

But he gritted his teeth.  

This seal held extraordinary power. Even a sliver of its might could slay this deceitful junior.  

*Hold on… Just summon the Verdant Sword Seal, and he’s dead!*  

*Puff!*  

Suddenly, a cloud of white powder exploded before his eyes.  

Instinctively, he tried to dodge, but the powder filled half the cavern, leaving no escape.  

"Agh!"  

Scalding pain seared his eyeballs, as if boiling oil had been poured into them.  

He could feel his eyes liquefying, streaming down his cheeks, the stench of charred flesh filling his sockets.  

The overwhelming agony shattered his focus. He clutched his face, desperately channeling mana to purge the powder.  

*Thud!*  

Before he could recover, a sharp pain pierced his chest.  

Life drained from his body at terrifying speed.  

Though his cultivation delayed death, he was already at death’s door, unable to speak, his consciousness fading.  

Faintly, he heard a voice tinged with resignation:  

"Senior Brother, if you’re wearing the Spirit-Severing Ring, you’re just a mortal. Why bother with seals? Quicklime ambushes and sharp blades—that’s the way."  

"Seals are just parlor tricks… good for roasting birds at best."  

"Bastard…!"  

Realization struck too late. With a final curse, Yang exhaled his last breath.  

Gu Yuan didn’t approach immediately. He waited a full incense stick’s time before cautiously stepping forward.  

Yang was truly dead.  

With the Spirit-Severing Ring in place, any seal was powerless—like water without a source.  

"Senior Brother, don’t blame me. You schemed first…"  

Gu Yuan sighed, gazing at Yang’s lifeless, unseeing eyes.  

He spoke truthfully. He hadn’t wanted to kill Yang, nor did he need this "proof of betrayal."  

As a transmigrator, he had his own means to escape this place.  

But Yang couldn’t wait.  

He needed this offering—his injuries worsened daily, his cultivation regressing toward certain death.  

Perhaps from the moment they met in the mines, Yang had been plotting.  

Yet Gu Yuan was no saint either. For five months, they had cooperated out of necessity, each harboring ulterior motives.  

Both had sought the other’s "trust."  

Neither succeeded.  

These past two days, Gu Yuan had remained on high alert.  

He knew Yang had secretly gathered thirty Demon Star Stones.  

Everything was ready—all that remained was the final move.  

Gu Yuan decided to strike first.  

The half-eaten "roast bird" had been his test.  

He had laced the meat with poison, probing whether Yang would take the bait—whether there was still room for compromise.  

The answer was clear.  

Yang refused.  

Not because he knew it was poisoned, but because he was preparing his own strike, instinctively wary of Gu Yuan’s offerings.  

So when Yang launched into his grand speech, Gu Yuan struck mid-sentence, seizing the initiative.  

The rest was inevitable.  

With the upper hand and the aid of his secret treasure—the Spirit-Corroding Quicklime—Gu Yuan shattered Yang’s defenses and ended their deadly game.  

"Senior Brother, blame your lack of vision for missing this opportunity…"  

Gu Yuan exhaled softly, then raised his palm.  

A grayish stone vial materialized out of thin air.  

When the Verdant Wood Sect disciples were sent to the Demon Star Cavern, their storage pouches and artifacts had been confiscated.  

Yet Gu Yuan could summon this vial undetected—proof of its extraordinary nature.  

It had belonged to his predecessor, who died prematurely from reckless cultivation.  

Gu Yuan had yet to uncover its full power when he was captured.  

But this very crisis had revealed its use.  

"May it bring greater fortune this time…"  

He shook the vial gently.  

Inside, liquid sloshed with a sound like jade striking jade.  

Tilting it, he let two drops of silvery liquid fall into his eyes.  

*Boom!*  

Instantly, stars swirled, sun and moon flickered.  

The world dissolved into gray-white lines—everything laid bare before his gaze.
