# Chapter 243: Shock and Awe

Li Yuanba's aura was as sharp and unyielding as his sword intent. At this moment, he was a true sword cultivator—with a sword in hand, who dared challenge him?

He reveled in battle, treating each fight as a crucible that tempered his sword intent. Through real combat, his sword intent grew at an astonishing pace. The supreme yang energy within his sword intent, derived from the innate purple qi of creation, was nearly invincible against all yin and sinister energies. Against demonic cultivators, its suppressive effect was downright terrifying.

Yu Piao moved the fastest, his figure flickering as he closed the distance to attack Li Yuanba. Twelve slender needles shot toward him. Though small, these needles were crafted from third-grade materials—only possible because such spirit tools required minimal resources, allowing them to surpass their grade.

This was Yu Piao's trump card, the foundation of his status as a true disciple. Witnessing Li Yuanba's terrifying combat prowess, he held nothing back, unleashing his strongest attack from the outset.

Li Yuanba's divine sense remained vigilant. The moment the twelve needles flew toward him, he sensed something amiss—they carried an aura akin to a third-grade sword foundation. A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he extended his right hand, summoning a third-grade sword foundation.

Though he hadn't specialized in split-mind techniques, the mental applications his main body had mastered were also available to this avatar. Now that he possessed divine sense, the only difference between his avatar and main body was the inability to refine pills with it. Half of his focus controlled the flying sword, while the other half concentrated on the sword foundation in his hand.

At this moment, Li Yuanba embodied two sword cultivation styles: the long-range flying sword and the close-combat swordplay. At least in the Foundation Establishment stage, the "Sword Demon Secret Code" could still hold its own against long-range sword techniques.

When Yu Piao saw Li Yuanba wield a sword, he seethed with anger at the perceived arrogance. He intended to teach Li Yuanba a harsh lesson with his twelve needle spirit tools.

The moment the needles closed in, Li Yuanba's sword foundation moved—thrusting, sweeping, lifting, slashing—each motion precise. None of the twelve needles reached him; all were deflected. The sword intent embedded in the needles after the first clash weakened their power, slowing them significantly.

When Yu Piao tried to recall them, Li Yuanba's sword foundation struck again. This time, the needles no longer obeyed Yu Piao's commands. A sweep of Li Yuanba's divine sense, and they were his.

"Pfft—!" Yu Piao spat out a mouthful of blood, his face a mix of shock and horror. 

Truthfully, needle spirit tools were never meant for direct combat—they excelled in ambushes. Yu Piao had only dared to attack because Li Yuanba's flying sword was occupied with Du Ke, leaving him seemingly defenseless. 

But who could have imagined Li Yuanba had another sword—a close-combat blade? Even more unthinkable was how he had used sword intent to shatter the spiritual imprints within the needles in melee combat.

The clash between Yu Piao and Li Yuanba lasted mere moments. Meanwhile, Du Ke, under assault from Li Yuanba's flying sword, had his defensive spirit tool shattered within those same two breaths. He fumbled for an escape talisman, but before it could fully activate, a thread of sword light sliced through his body.

It wasn't that Du Ke reacted slowly. The sword intent infused with supreme yang energy disrupted his spiritual energy flow, slowing his movements—a testament to the relative mildness of his demonic cultivation technique. This delay proved fatal.

As the talisman activated, Du Ke's upper body transformed into a streak of light attempting to flee. But Li Yuanba's sword-thread technique bisected his defenseless form. Only the half still clutching the talisman escaped.

This grotesque sight sent chills down the spines of the approaching demonic cultivators.

Du Ke had been a true disciple—elite among his peers, lavished with resources, techniques, and artifacts far beyond ordinary sect members. True disciples typically commanded groups of followers who scraped by on their leftovers. 

The hierarchy was universal across sects: true disciples and ordinary disciples occupied entirely different realms.

Du Ke's effortless execution—unable to escape even with a life-saving talisman—dealt a devastating blow to the demonic cultivators' morale.

Li Yuanba paid no heed to their shock. His flying sword erupted with full force, splitting into countless rays as sword-threads wove through the air like a radiant sun. Three breaths after Du Ke's partial escape, six demonic cultivators lay dead.

By then, Lin Ping and Yu Piao's forces had closed in. But Li Yuanba's slaughter had been too swift, too horrifying—their encirclement shattered before it could form.

A sword light materialized beneath Li Yuanba's feet as he employed sword遁 to accelerate. His gaze was icy, devoid of emotion, only sword intent and killing intent surging.

While the demonic cultivators attacked, he used sword遁 to maintain distance, staying just beyond their range. But this was their limit, not his. With divine sense, his flying sword's reach, though not matching a Golden Core cultivator's, far exceeded ordinary spiritual sense users.

The demonic cultivators realized their numerical advantage meant nothing. With their formation broken, even landing a hit became wishful thinking.

Among them, Yu Piao was the fastest. Yet after Du Ke's gruesome death and losing his prized spirit tools, he hung back with the others, regretting joining this hunt for Li Yuanba's pill resources.

Unable to reach Li Yuanba, the demonic cultivators could only watch as his flying sword picked them off one by one.

At mid Foundation Establishment, Li Yuanba faced no suppression even against late-stage opponents. Late-stage demonic cultivators might withstand one blow, but early and mid-stage cultivators lost control of their spirit tools upon contact.

Without mutual support, more would have fallen instantly. Even so, their cohesion crumbled after nearly ten spirit tools were disabled. 

Demonic cultivators were inherently self-serving. Facing an invincible foe, their only choice was to flee faster than their comrades.

The first deserter triggered a chain reaction. Screams erupted as gaps in their defenses allowed Li Yuanba's sword to strike.

Those who hesitated died first. Against a sword cultivator's flying blade and sword intent, defenseless demonic cultivators were lambs to the slaughter.

After several more deaths, their formation collapsed completely. Each fled in different directions, only to be cut down by the faster sword light.

Lin Ping and Yu Piao initially retreated together for safety. But realizing Li Yuanba prioritized hunting their subordinates, they split up.

Li Yuanba chose Lin Ping. Others might escape, but not the first true disciple who'd pursued him.

Seeing Lin Ping targeted, Yu Piao felt momentary relief—until a white lotus bloomed before him. 

His mind cleared too late. Li Yuanba materialized, sword already sweeping through his neck.

As the battle concluded, Li Yuanba's battle spirit gradually subsided. Of the twenty-three demonic cultivators—including three true disciples—only two late-stage survivors escaped.

This was the might of a sword cultivator. Against peers, through explosive power and tactical maneuvering, they dominated the battlefield.

Supreme sword intent was an absolute weapon in Foundation Establishment—only those wielding comparable abilities could resist.

Li Yuanba began collecting spoils. The battlefield was vast, but his divine sense ensured no loot was missed. Du Ke's severed wrist still bore a storage bracelet, minimizing losses.

Though little in the true disciples' storage treasures interested him, their bodies—especially the likely heavenly spiritual roots of Lin Ping and Yu Piao—were excellent materials for corpse refinement or trade.

As he worked, no further attacks came. Unbeknownst to him, the two escapees had been intercepted by other demonic factions.

His exploits spread through their accounts—though lacking details of Lin Ping and Yu Piao's fates or his "Step of the White Lotus" technique.

The news gave pause to would-be ambushers. Everyone sought easy prey; none wished to test this iron wall.

With Lin Ping and Yu Piao confirmed dead, most demonic cultivators lost their nerve. The uncertain chance of pill resources wasn't worth certain death.
