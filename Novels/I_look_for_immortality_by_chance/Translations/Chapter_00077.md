# Chapter 77: You're a Plunder Cultivator Too!

"Boom!"

Crimson flames erupted on the cliff. After eliminating her targets, Yun Hanxiu moved with lightning speed. Without hesitation, she ignited a peculiar talisman, reducing all corpses to ashes with a single blaze. Then she swiftly collected the storage bags scattered on the ground and raced toward the mountain peak.

At the summit stood a narrow, peculiar stone grotto, solitary like a doorway. Through its opening, one could glimpse a descending stone staircase where an eighth-level Qi Refining water ape, covered in wounds, weakly watched Yun Hanxiu approach.

"Squeak! Squeak!"

Recognizing the murderous intent in Yun Hanxiu's eyes, the water ape seemed to resign itself to fate. With a mournful cry, it knelt and prostrated itself before her.

"Thud!"

But Yun Hanxiu remained unmoved. She produced a massive golden pestle and struck the ape's head, knocking it unconscious. Then she bound it tightly with a green rope before placing three magical artifacts at the grotto's entrance as barriers. Only then did she proceed inside with confidence.

Descending the stone steps, the space suddenly opened up to reveal a sapphire-blue pool hidden within the mountain.

At the sight of the pool, a flicker of joy appeared at the corners of Yun Hanxiu's lips. Activating a seal, her eyes glowed crimson as she scanned the water's surface. After a thorough inspection, her delight grew. She summoned her protective qi, took a deep breath, and plunged into the pool.

A long while later, the waters parted as Yun Hanxiu emerged, her face alight with triumph. In her hand shimmered a black jade slip, radiating an unusual luster.

But just then, her joy froze. She looked up to find a tall young man standing in the grotto—someone who hadn't been there before. Towering and radiant, his handsome features exuded an ethereal aura beneath his flowing robes. With hands clasped behind his back and sleeves swaying gently, he regarded her with an amused smile.

"You're... Senior Brother Gu Yuan from Tongzhou?"

"Senior Brother Gu, when did you arrive here?"

Meeting Gu Yuan's gaze, Yun Hanxiu's expression remained unchanged. She widened her eyes innocently, feigning surprise.

Naturally stunning with delicate jade-like features, snow-white skin, and a figure that even loose robes couldn't conceal, Yun Hanxiu fixed her captivating, spirited eyes on Gu Yuan.

"Whoosh!"

But Gu Yuan merely chuckled. Activating both the Flame Drake Seal and the Minor Titan Seal, a fiery dragon materialized in the air, spewing scorching flames that landed precisely a foot in front of him.

"Sizzle!"

Invisible, peculiar insects—undetectable to both sight and spiritual sense—instantly turned to ash, scattering to the ground.

"Those are Soul-Stealing Insects!"

"Senior Brother Gu, someone's ambushing us!"

Yun Hanxiu feigned alarm and vigilance, urgently warning Gu Yuan.

"Clang!"

Yet Gu Yuan simply pointed a finger, sending dozens of peach blossoms flying toward his own feet.

"Slash!"

Invisible tendrils of fragrance, like vines, had stealthily coiled around his ankles. But under the sharp cuts of the peach blossom sword energy, the scent dissipated into nothingness.

"Careful! That's Corpse-Rot Fragrance!"

Yun Hanxiu's face paled further as she scanned their surroundings in panic, continuing to alert Gu Yuan.

"Clank!"

But Gu Yuan summoned the Mountain Seal above his head, causing illusory peaks to descend around him. Just as they appeared, an eerie cold wind arose—only to be firmly blocked by the seal.

"Senior Brother Gu, which sect of plunder cultivation do you belong to? The Solar Path or the Primordial Demon Path?"

At this point, Yun Hanxiu shed all pretense of fear. Frowning deeply, she stared at Gu Yuan with intense wariness.

She had just employed her most covert and lethal plunderer techniques—using sound as a trigger and speech as a medium—yet this seemingly righteous senior brother had effortlessly countered them all. His skill was so refined that it made her feel like an amateur.

"I walk the noble path of righteousness! What need have I for underhanded tricks?" 

"Rather, Junior Sister Yun, this is a campaign for the Dao Academy's grand strategy. Why aren't you securing a spiritual peak? What are you doing here instead?"

Gu Yuan flicked his sleeves lightly, his smile unwavering as his gaze settled on the black jade slip hidden within Yun Hanxiu's sleeve.

This was the opportunity the Stone Liquid had guided him to. How had a jade slip remained undiscovered in a pool for so long?

"Senior Brother Gu, why hide the truth? You slipped past three of my artifacts unnoticed and dismantled my techniques with ease—how could you not be a plunder cultivator?"

"And if you weren't, why would you come to this pool?"

Yun Hanxiu clenched her teeth. She never expected to encounter a fellow plunder cultivator among the Qi Refining disciples of Qingfeng Dao Academy.

Plunder cultivation was both a profession and a philosophy. Opportunistic theft or murder didn't make one a true plunder cultivator. 

A real plunder cultivator devoted themselves to mastering every trick, meticulously selecting targets, forsaking honest labor to specialize in the art of plunder. Without mastering at least a dozen underhanded methods and successfully ambushing over ten victims, one couldn't claim the title.

Ordinary cultivators took on side tasks or tended spiritual fields to earn resources in their spare time. But plunder cultivators spent every free moment scheming how to seize wealth and lives.

This man before her not only recognized her tricks but countered them with even greater finesse. Such expertise could only come from relentless study.

The realization filled her with tension and alarm—yet also a strange thrill.

A kindred spirit!

She had long grown weary of the Dao Academy's endless alchemy routines. 

Hah! Why refine pills when you could just take them?

During the last expedition to Yunya Shell Bay, she had been secluded, refining Ghost Incense, and missed the campaign—much to her frustration. This time, she had eagerly signed up for the Flying Wave Mountain mission.

She had meticulously prepared, targeting those from noble and humble backgrounds alike—arrogant, unscrupulous individuals weaker than herself. Everything had gone according to plan.

Those marked by her Ghost Incense had been eliminated, netting her a windfall and satisfying her plundering urges. She had even located the jade slip left by the Three Methods Daoist.

Yet at the final moment, she had stumbled upon a fellow plunderer.

What now?

Her instincts warned her that this man was unfathomable—engaging him would be unwise.

But the itch to test her skills against a peer was irresistible, gnawing at her like ants beneath her skin.
