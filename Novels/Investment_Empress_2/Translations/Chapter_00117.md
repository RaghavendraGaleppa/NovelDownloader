Chapter 117: The Ice Cube’s Praise and the Jade Liquid Realm Perfection

The game segment in Autumn Water Pavilion finally ended.

"Fine, you win."

The young man’s face now had six or seven paper strips stuck to it.

Through the gaps in the paper, he saw the corner of the girl’s mouth slightly upturned.

At the same time, a series of system notifications rang out in his mind:

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully allowed 'Ying Bing' to win at Gomoku.】

【Investment Feedback: Azure Vein Jade Raft.】

【Congratulations, Host. You have invested in 'Ying Bing's' Delicate Bean Curd and Seven-Leaf Moistening Qi Grass Pickles.】

【Investment Feedback: Dust-Free Brush.】

...

Although they were items like brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones, they were certainly not ordinary.

The low-key, luxurious, and profound style was clearly that of a treasure.

Who said I lost?

I’m the one who won big.

Li Mo was secretly delighted when the Ice Cube’s soft reminder came from across the table: "Sword practice."

The time they spent practicing swords together had changed from once a day to once every three days.

Well, it was mainly because Little Princess Jiang’s frequency of asking questions had decreased.

For some reason, the Ice Cube was exceptionally serious today.

Little Li was in pain, yet happy.

Half an hour later.

Little Princess Jiang’s textbook became a bit thicker.

Without resting, Li Mo picked up his sword again. While using his martial arts insights to deduce moves, he began practicing the few sword techniques he had just brought back from the Scripture Pavilion.

"Why are you practicing these superior sword techniques?"

Ying Bing stood alone, holding her sword. Her eyes, reflecting the moonlight, filled with疑惑 (doubt/puzzlement).

He had already achieved minor success in a peerless sword technique.

Superior martial arts and peerless martial arts were worlds apart. It wasn’t even a case of "using other mountains to attack jade" (learning from others to improve oneself).

Why bother?

"......"

Li Mo was actually rendered silent by the question.

He couldn’t exactly say he was feeding this to Jiang Chulong and making a profit as the middleman.

If he hadn’t earned quite a bit during this period, he wouldn’t even have been able to level up the "Karma Fire Red Lotus Wonder Method."

Just as Little Li was thinking of how to explain, the Ice Cube spoke up again: "Are you really planning... to walk the path of 'Skill Approaching the Way'?"

Li Mo: "...... Ah, yes, that's right."

No need to explain.

The Ice Cube would fill in the blanks herself.

"That is very difficult."

"Even with... your talent."

Ying Bing said softly.

It wasn't just sword techniques; for any Way, there is the concept of "Skill Approaching the Way."

But throughout history, the number of geniuses and monsters who have attempted it was like the countless carp in a river, yet...

None have succeeded.

It seems like a chasm between mortals and immortals displayed by the heavens, a mockery.

Even Jiang Chulong, who was later recognized as a peerless talent in the Way of the Sword, was still far from exhausting the principles of the sword.

"I know."

Li Mo nodded without hesitation.

Although he didn't know what the Ice Cube was imagining in her mind, he knew his own limits.

Huh? Me? Skill Approaching the Way?

Impossible, completely impossible!

"Skill Approaching the Way" my foot.

Little Li knew very clearly that this was just to farm rewards!

He smiled and turned around to start practicing his sword again.

"Knowing it is impossible, yet doing it anyway?"

Ying Bing murmured softly.

Whoosh—

The night wind blew, and the moonlight was like frost.

The少年 (young man) would sometimes挥剑 (swing his sword), sometimes沉思 (contemplate), and each time he would be stronger than the last.

For a moment, it seemed as if time had lost its meaning on him.

Martial arts was a long river, and those sword geniuses who left their names in history were like stars in the clear river.

Perhaps.

No matter whether he could reach the end of this path, he would shine brightly in the long river of martial arts.

The leaves rustled softly.

"The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm. Be careful of Han Zhen."

She said no more, quietly turning to go upstairs.

Watching the Ice Cube’s departing figure, Li Mo recalled that he seemed to have seen this name somewhere.

The author of "Chronicles of Divine Form"?

No, that book was from many years ago. The author, if calculated, would be several thousand years old by now.

A namesake genius?

...

Inside the World Seed.

Taking advantage of the fact that Little Princess Jiang hadn't arrived yet, Li Mo began to inspect his own small world.

"It's much bigger than before."

Looking around, the small world was now a hundred times larger than before.

Just like his realm.

The buildings, however, were still the same, making the place look very empty.

Snap—

Li Mo snapped his fingers.

The scene in the small world changed, and all things transformed. It instantly turned into the seaside villa he had worked hard for in his previous life, which eventually allowed his dog of a boss to afford one.

Within the space of a few miles, this villa even had a garden. It took ten minutes just to walk to the bathroom.

"To watch the sea, one naturally needs... the sun?"

Li Mo looked at the sea and lay down on a lounge chair.

With a thought, a phantom of the sun appeared in the sky.

Of course, it was just a phantom, merely superficial, far from a true great sun.

"If I condense the Mysterious Pill, I should probably be able to create a real sun in this small world?"

"Still feels like something is missing..."

Li Mo looked at the sea surface.

Sunshine, sandy beach... cough.

When would it be perfect if I could get the Ice Cube and the beautiful Master to come in and change into swimsuits...

Thinking of this, Little Li touched the Panjie Meteor Hammer, and the hammer vibrated slightly twice.

Suddenly.

Li Mo seemed to sense something, and the Phaseless Glass Veil instantly appeared around him.

"Mas... Master?"

"This place...?"

Little Princess Jiang looked around with confusion and curiosity.

"Ah, this is just a place where the尊 (Venerable) usually relaxes. You can come here to play after practicing."

The尊 (Venerable) said casually.

"Then... I..."

Jiang Chulong lowered her head, her small hands fidgeting with each other.

After stuttering for a long time, she finally gathered the courage to say: "Disciple... can I bring... bring Big Brother Li along?"

"Eh?"

The尊 (Venerable) was confused by this sentence.

Jiang Chulong’s mind tightened, and her delicate body trembled slightly.

She thought the尊 (Venerable) Master was angry.

That makes sense; this is the Master's secret place. How could she casually bring others...

"Master... I..."

"...You may."

The尊 (Venerable) nodded lightly.

"Re... Really?"

Jiang Chulong didn't even dare to lift her head to look at him.

"If you practice well and break through a realm, I will agree to it."

The尊 (Venerable) waved his sleeve.

Instantly, the sunshine and beach villa all disappeared.

What appeared next wasn't the previous small Daoist temple either.

"Master... this place... this place is?"

Having changed locations, Jiang Chulong hugged a tree branch tightly, carefully observing her surroundings.

Beneath her feet were white clouds. Not far away, a purple gold Bagua alchemy furnace lay toppled over.

The building behind it, rather than being a Daoist temple, was more like a palace.

The shining plaque indeed read:

'Doushua Palace.'

"A lost corner of the Heavenly Court."

The尊 (Venerable) spoke slowly, carrying an endless sense of vicissitudes.

It was as if he had returned to an old place, filled with an indescribable sense of melancholy.

"How... how did it become like this?"

Jiang Chulong didn't dare to wander around, but she was very curious.

"If you want to hear a story, the尊 (Venerable) must first test your progress."

The尊 (Venerable) laughed lightly.

He casually tossed a small blade of grass, turning it into a grass puppet.

It could be controlled by Li Mo, and controlled to execute his sword techniques.

Hmm...

The尊 (Venerable) has such high prestige, of course, he couldn't personally step into the arena!

Speaking of which, Li Mo had a sudden flash of inspiration.

正好 (Coincidentally), he was planning to renovate the World Seed and change the practice environment for Little Princess Jiang, so he just said this was the Heavenly Court.

A quarter of an hour later.

The tree branch pierced the throat of the grass puppet.

Jiang Chulong stood still, as if she had gained some enlightenment.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Jiang Chulong's' superior sword technique manual and helped her gain enlightenment.】

【Two investment feedbacks: totaling 150 years of martial arts insight.】

...

And so, ten days later.

Little Li had passed another incredibly fulfilling ten days.

Using the price difference, he earned five hundred years of martial arts insight.

His daily practice routine also changed from the small waterfall to the Dan Ding Peak.

The lotus in his Dantian had already bloomed with nine leaves.

One step away, and he could enter the Mysterious Pill realm.

The day to return home had finally arrived.

The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was in Qinghe County.

Little Li’s hometown.
