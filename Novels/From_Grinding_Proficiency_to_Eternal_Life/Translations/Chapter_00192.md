# Chapter 192: Da Qian

Fu Jin placed the straight blade horizontally on the bluestone table. As the edge touched the ground, a few sparks flew out.

He tapped the polished bronze crane lamp stand on the table with his finger. The lamp wick suddenly brightened by three points with the light sound of the mechanism turning.

"Since Hall Master Mo of the Mechanism Hall completed his stationing in the Heavenly Work Cave, he has plunged headfirst into that Mechanism Bronze Door left behind by the Mo family. Now, he has found some clues."

"Oh?"

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. Since the stationing at the Heavenly Work Cave was completed, the disciples of the Heavenly Work Department began to build a Heavenly Corridor leading directly to the Ghost Weeping Abyss, completely covering the bronze door revealed inside the岩壁缝隙.

Since then, Mo Han had plunged headfirst into it. Most of the affairs of the Mechanism Hall were handled by Mo Shisan. A few days ago, Xu Yunfan had heard Mo Shisan complain that he didn't have time to develop the latest humanoid mechanical armor.

Seeing that he had hooked Xu Yunfan's interest, Fu Jin chuckled and said, "Yesterday, a message came out saying that the cloud patterns on the door ring match the 'Tian Zhi Pian' of the 'Mo Jing'. Inside, there must be a Mechanism Treasure Box of the Mo family's Non-Aggression lineage!"

"Non-Aggression?"

Seeing a hint of confusion in Xu Yunfan's mouth, Fu Jin had to explain.

"The Mo family's mechanisms are divided into three lineages. This 'Punish the Tyrant' lineage focuses on killing, specializing in battering rams and thunderfire bombs. Two thousand years ago, to stop the King of Chu from attacking Song, the Grand Master built seventy-two ninety-nine zhang tall mechanical siege ladders in three days. They were built like a smooth road, and one ladder could accommodate ten thousand people."

"The 'Non-Aggression' lineage emphasizes defense. The bronze door's mercury hourglass and magnet mechanisms you saw are all methods of this lineage."

Speaking of this, Fu Jin's face carried a hint of longing, and he couldn't help but click his tongue in amazement. "The most difficult to fathom is the 'Balance Preservation' lineage, which emphasizes 'suspending the weight to move, being unbiased and impartial'."

"The demonic tiger that ran out of the mountain a month ago, do you know why the nine underground dragon gates of Heavenly Work City didn't crush us into meat paste? The eight copper chains correspond to the principles of the Eight Trigrams' generation and destruction. If one more is cut, the mechanism loses its balance; if one less is broken, the magnet locks. Old Mo is a disciple of the Balance Preservation lineage! Combining offense and defense is the ultimate goal pursued by the Mechanism Hall."

Fu Jin chattered on and on, his expression somewhat excited. He said that if Old Mo could really解开 the bronze valve and take out the Non-Aggression from the Mo family's Mechanism Treasure Box, perhaps Heavenly Work City would truly become impregnable. Even a supreme Grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Cultivation would not be able to breach the Heavenly Work Fortress.

He chattered for a long time. Seeing that Fu Jin still wasn't moving, Xu Yunfan said helplessly, "Senior Brother Fu, just tell me what's going on?"

Fu Jin's words paused, a hint of embarrassment appeared on his face, followed by a trace of worry.

"Master has been away for over a month. Although he sends a message back every three days, seven days have passed now, and there's still no news."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed slightly. "Have you sent the Great Eagle team disciples to check on Qingzhou?"

"Four days ago, I had the Great Eagle team disciples go. Once the Mechanism Hall's Great Eagle mechanical bird takes off, it can fly four thousand li a day. By my calculations, we should get a message back today."

Xu Yunfan scanned the 'Heavenly Work Exploits Diagram' on the wall of the Earthfire Room. On this diagram were maps of the Six Directions and Seventy-two Prefectures of the Great Zhou collected by the Great Eagle disciples. His gaze stopped on the area marked "Qingzhou".

"The Great Eagle team just replaced their wings with overlapping feather mechanisms last month. Three hundred and sixty fine steel feathers can absorb wind from all eight directions to fill the air sac and rise straight to the heavens."

Xu Yunfan said, tapping the flight route on the diagram with his finger. "Senior Brother, you don't need to worry too much. Perhaps they encountered strong winds and had to detour."

The Heavenly Work Cave might not be the strongest, but in terms of convenience, none of the six major sects of the current era can compare. Even the Heavenly Work Cave has a dedicated mail service, specifically to various prefectures of the Great Zhou, and even involves the neighboring Da Qian.

Fu Jin nodded slightly. Just as he was about to speak, the sound-transmitting orifice on the wall of the Earthfire Room suddenly let out a sharp, piercing cry of a Great Eagle.

The urgent report from a Great Eagle. If it sounded in the Earthfire Room, then the sound must have echoed throughout the entire Heavenly Work City.

The two instinctively exchanged a glance. As they quickly walked out of the Earthfire Room, they saw the轰鸣 of gears meshing in the sky.

They saw half a broken steel wing emerge from the clouds. The body of the eagle, forged from玄铁, was covered in scorched arrow holes. The door of the message compartment was actually askew with three anti-armor bolts carved with Da Qian totems.

This Great Eagle from Yanbei Prefecture, like a golden crow with broken wings, crashed heavily onto the bluestone platform, wreathed in thick smoke.

The disciple on the Great Eagle stumbled down, shouting.

"Urgent report! Da Qian is attacking Yanbei Prefecture. Qingzhou and Wuzhou have fallen! The ten thousand Da Qian Xuanjia Army broke through the Cold Crow Crossing three days ago!" His hoarse voice pierced through the entire Heavenly Work City. "The twelve beacon towers in Qingzhou have all been extinguished. The Wuzhou commander opened the city and surrendered... Eight hundred li urgent message from Yanbei Prefecture!"

Many disciples of the Heavenly Work Cave who had rushed to the Observatory were shocked.

The sound of people gasping in shock rose one after another.

Xu Yunfan and Fu Jin, who had just arrived at the Observatory, also couldn't help but be shaken when they heard this news.

At some point, Heavenly Work Cave Master Hong Baichuan had appeared on the Observatory platform, his hands behind his back, his brows tightly furrowed.

Now, the Great Zhou is in chaos because of that female demoness. Chaos appears frequently, and the entire Great Zhou is almost on the verge of collapse. The rebellious voices in each prefecture rise one after another, and their momentum grows stronger by the day.

Even in the current Lingnan Prefecture, there are two rebel armies, but which two forces are supporting them behind the scenes is obvious.

Hong Baichuan looked at the letter in his hand. It was a long while before his tightly furrowed brows finally relaxed.

"If our Heavenly Work Cave were still in Yanbei Prefecture, we would inevitably have been caught in the conflict. Now, the Nine Shine Sect has become the front line instead. Heh, those Da Qian soldiers..."

His face showed a hint of confusion. "There is a great chasm separating the Great Zhou and Da Qian. Why are they going to such great lengths to attack the Great Zhou?"

Mo Shisan, the head disciple of the Mechanism Hall who had hurried over, looked down at the Great Eagle mechanical bird that had almost been shattered by a single arrow, his brows tightly furrowed.

"This anti-armor arrow was shot by a person. It was drawn from a hundred-stone bow, and the arrow pierced through the clouds. Fortunately, when we improved the Great Eagle, we included a balance instrument. Otherwise, with half a wing broken, it couldn't have flown this far."

A slightly aged voice came from the side.

"Going to such great lengths is all because of that demoness, the Empress. Through blood sacrifice, she has stirred up the spiritual energy of the entire Great Zhou's earth veins. That Da Qian naturally won't let this opportunity pass."

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look and saw Mechanism Hall Master Mo Han, with his disheveled hair and dirty face, walking over from behind. The wind he brought with him made Xu Yunfan's breath catch.

How long has it been since he last bathed?

Mo Han was completely unaware. He took the arrow from Mo Shisan, who was covering his nose, and examined it carefully for a moment before speaking. "Made by the Da Qian Armory. The craftsman who made it has good skill."

He turned to Hong Baichuan and said, "We... I'm afraid we need to be prepared. Recall our disciples from Da Qian. With a great war imminent, our Heavenly Work Cave's mechanical techniques will likely be coveted."
