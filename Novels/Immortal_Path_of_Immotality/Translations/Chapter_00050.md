# Chapter 50: Wind Riding Technique

After consolidating his cultivation, Lin Shan took out the "Xun Wind Art." Now at the sixth layer of Qi Refining, he was considered to be in the mid-stage of Qi Refining and could finally learn the Wind Riding Technique.

The Wind Riding Technique wasn't exactly a spell—it was more of a skill for manipulating wind spiritual energy. Since it couldn't be enhanced by his upgrade panel, it clearly held little value for improvement. Still, having it for travel or escape was better than nothing.

After briefly studying and mastering the technique, Lin Shan felt satisfied and put the manual away. Estimating his current spiritual energy, he found it was more than ten times what he had at the third layer of Qi Refining. At last, he had achieved "Wind Blade Technique freedom."

Nodding in satisfaction, Lin Shan finally felt a bit safer about his upcoming journey to the capital.

Just then, as dawn likely approached outside, a knock came at the door.

"Come in."

Yang, the branch leader, and Jiang, the protector, entered with breakfast. Lin Shan didn't stand on ceremony and invited them to join him at the table.

Throughout the meal, Yang seemed hesitant, stealing glances at Lin Shan. It dawned on Lin Shan that the man still hadn't given up on cultivating immortality and was waiting for him to test his spiritual roots.

*"The problem is, I don't know how..."* Of course, he kept that thought to himself. Since he was enjoying their hospitality, Lin Shan decided to play along. He placed a hand on Yang's forehead and had a sudden idea—he activated the Wind Riding Technique he'd just learned.

A gentle breeze began to stir in the room, growing stronger until it rattled the vase on the table and swayed the curtains. Lin Shan's body was soon encircled by faint green wind currents, swirling around him.

Yang and Jiang stared in awe, recognizing this as a display of magic. They remained respectfully silent, not daring to interrupt.

Lin Shan felt light as a feather, as if he could glide effortlessly just above the ground. While he couldn't fly, moving without using his feet was now possible. Pleased, he nodded and smiled—the Wind Riding Technique was indeed useful. Wind-attributed cultivators were rare, and this was clearly one of their perks.

Misinterpreting Lin Shan's smile, Yang grew ecstatic. *"Does this mean I have spiritual roots? Can I cultivate too?"* Beside him, Jiang seethed with envy. *"It's not fair! This bootlicker gets to have spiritual roots too?"*

After experiencing the technique, Lin Shan dismissed the wind currents and noticed Yang's excited expression. Realizing the misunderstanding, he quickly removed his hand from the man's forehead.

"Immortal Lin! D-do I have spiritual roots?" Yang stammered, trembling with anticipation.

Seeing Yang's excitement, Lin Shan felt he might have overplayed his hand. *"How do I talk my way out of this?"* He considered telling the truth but recalled Yang's flattery on the boat yesterday.

*"Why not let him try? If he really has roots, I could use a cultivator subordinate. He won't surpass me anyway."* With that thought, Lin Shan grinned and clapped Yang on the shoulder.

"Excellent! You, my friend, are a once-in-a-century genius!"

Yang dropped to his knees and kowtowed. "Please, Immortal, bestow upon me the method! I pledge to follow you!"

Lin Shan waved a hand. "I only know you have spiritual roots, not their attribute. I can teach you sensing methods for five elements—metal, wood, fire, earth, and wind. Try them first."

Before handing over any cultivation techniques, Lin Shan wanted to see if they could even sense spiritual energy. He recited the "sensing chapters" of the five arts, not bothering to exclude Jiang. If the man succeeded, having another follower wouldn't hurt.

For the next two hours, Lin Shan guided the two through the process.

Eventually, Lin Shan shook his head. Yang and Jiang looked utterly lost.

"Your roots might not match these methods. You could have water, ice, or lightning attributes—but I don't have those techniques. It's up to fate now."

He phrased it gently to spare their feelings. He'd done his best, but lacking roots was beyond his control. The odds of them having other rare attributes were slim, but hope was all some people lived for.

Yang, though disappointed, was grateful for Lin Shan's effort. Whether he'd mobilize the entire Jiangling Nightingale assassins to hunt for other cultivation methods was no longer Lin Shan's concern.

Over the next two days, Lin Shan explored Jiangling. The antique markets yielded nothing, but he heard of a renowned calligraphy piece kept by a prominent local family.

That night, Lin Shan scaled the family's walls and slipped into the patriarch's bedroom. Coincidentally, the patriarch was a peak martial artist who had participated in the siege against the Southern Immortal at Dongting Lake.

Awakening to find the white-robed immortal looming over him, the man nearly screamed for mercy, fearing retribution. Lin Shan cut to the chase—he wanted to see the calligraphy.

The patriarch scrambled to his treasure vault, returning bare-chested and clutching the artwork. Lin Shan touched it—2 points of ancient essence.

He offered payment, but the patriarch insisted on gifting it. After some polite refusal, Lin Shan accepted. The man then eagerly invited Lin Shan to stay as an honored guest—or even a family guardian. Lin Shan declined both, pressing the silver notes into the man's hands before leaving.

---

Two days later, Lin Shan faced three chests of tokens—reclaimed from Jiangling's Nightingale branch at Yang's order. For those in power, such tasks were trivial.

After inspecting them, Lin Shan found no useful items, but they still contributed 3 points of ancient essence. Not bad.

He had started with 11 points after leaving Zangke County. After spending 8 on the Water Spirit Fruit, and gaining 3 from the Nightingale tokens and 2 from the calligraphy, he now had 8 left—a modest reserve for emergencies.

Leaving Jiangling, Lin Shan and Jiang took the land route north. Half a month later, a towering city appeared on the horizon—the capital of the Great Song Dynasty, Dongjing Bianliang.
