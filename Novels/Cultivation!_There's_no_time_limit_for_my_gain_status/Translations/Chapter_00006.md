# Chapter Six: The Bite  

"Capture them alive!"  

The middle-aged cultivator's voice was laced with frustration.  

This mission had initially gone smoothly—they had found children with spiritual roots in numbers exceeding the previous year by twenty percent.  

Encouraged by their success, they had split off a convoy to raid an unexpected discovery: a tribe of Scale Demons, capturing a considerable number of high-quality "goods."  

If they could bring these captives back and even find a few among the children with high-grade spiritual roots, their profits would easily double.  

But just as they were about to return to their stronghold, the convoy was ambushed by Scale Demons under the cover of night.  

The eerie, innate ability of the Scale Demons—their Song—was so insidious that even the cultivators had been caught off guard.  

Had it not been for the quick reflexes of a few higher-level cultivators who woke in time and roused their companions, the casualties would have been far worse.  

Now, with losses already incurred, their only recourse was to capture more Scale Demons to sell as compensation.  

Thus, the Scale Demons fled ahead while the cultivators gave chase, vanishing into the mist amid bursts of flames and crackling lightning.  

Meanwhile, the black-clad martial artists stayed behind to guard against a second ambush and tend to the wounded.  

"Tsk—damn, that hurts! Do these things' teeth have venom? Am I going to get infected?"  

Jiang Li sat on the ground, hissing through clenched teeth.  

Dangling from his left shoulder was the severed head of a Scale Demon.  

---  

Under the cover of night and thick fog, Jiang Li had crouched low and hurried toward Yan Hong’s tent.  

At that moment, two Scale Demons were tearing through the canvas, reaching inside to drag someone out.  

Yan Hong—the fat fool—had a habit of waking up frequently at night to relieve himself, so his tent was positioned closer to the edge of the camp, making him an easy first target in the attack.  

Suppressing the urge to curse his friend’s weak bladder, Jiang Li acted swiftly. He hurled the sword in his hand like a projectile.  

At a distance of only seven or eight paces, his aim was true. The sharp blade, propelled by sheer force, pierced clean through one of the Scale Demons, sending its body flying two meters before it collapsed.  

Seeing this, the other monster let out a screech, releasing Yan Hong’s ankle and lunging at Jiang Li.  

In that split second, Jiang Li smirked calmly and drew another sword from his waist, thrusting it straight toward the creature’s chest.  

As a seasoned gamer, he never left home without filling every equipment slot.  

Jiang Li had snatched seven swords earlier. After giving one to Yan Hong, he still had six left—one in hand, another at his waist. Had it not been for concerns about mobility, he would have strapped the remaining four to his back in a bundle.  

Now, the value of backup weapons became apparent. The sword struck slightly lower, piercing through the abdomen and out the back. Though it missed the heart, the wound was still fatal.  

---  

But before Jiang Li could celebrate, the Scale Demon glanced down at its stomach—then, with a sickening grind of flesh and bone against steel, it forced itself forward along the blade.  

Jiang Li instinctively wanted to kick it away, but he didn’t have time to react.  

The creature’s mouth—deceptively human-like at first—split open to its ears, revealing two rows of razor-sharp teeth dripping with foul-smelling mucus as it lunged for his neck.  

Jiang Li barely managed to twist his body, avoiding a lethal bite, but his shoulder wasn’t so lucky.  

Here, Jiang Li’s lack of real combat experience became glaringly obvious. Despite his superior attributes and armed advantage, he had been dragged into a brawl by a single monster.  

The Scale Demon’s teeth were like needles, upper and lower rows clamping together, effortlessly piercing through the flesh of his shoulder until they scraped against bone. With every twist and tear of its head, the grinding sent shudders of agony through Jiang Li.  

The excruciating pain—of nearly five pounds of flesh being torn away, of razor teeth grating against bone—made his vision flicker black.  

For a moment, he was certain his entire shoulder would be ripped off.  

His left arm was useless now. Gritting his teeth, Jiang Li twisted the sword still embedded in the Scale Demon’s body, turning it sideways before yanking it out in a brutal slash.  

The force traveled through the blade, jolting the creature’s body—and consequently, the jaws clamped on his shoulder. The sudden agony nearly made him pass out.  

Too weak to attack further, Jiang Li released the sword and wrapped his right arm around the Scale Demon’s head, pressing it down to prevent further damage from its thrashing.  

The creature’s chest and abdomen had been split open, spilling organs. Soon, its body went limp, the dark, fish-like eyes glazing over in death.  

But what infuriated Jiang Li wasn’t the injury—it was realizing, after nearly dying, that the person he’d risked his life to save was still asleep.  

Two sharp slaps later, Yan Hong groggily woke up—just as the cultivators and martial artists finally arrived.  

After a quick explanation, Yan Hong broke into a cold sweat, horrified. Upon learning Jiang Li had saved him, he effusively thanked him and even mentioned an unmarried younger sister back at his family’s estate, suggesting they "strengthen their bond."  

"Strengthen what? Get over here and help me get this damn head off!"  

Jiang Li was on the verge of tears from the pain. The damned Scale Demon had to be related to snapping turtles—its jaws didn’t loosen even in death.  

After Jiang Li firmly rejected brute-force removal, Yan Hong carefully used a small knife to sever the muscles and ligaments along the creature’s cheeks, finally freeing the head.  

---  

Blood gushed out, revealing that an artery had been punctured. Fortunately, the bleeding stopped abruptly after five seconds—otherwise, Jiang Li would’ve surely gone into hemorrhagic shock.  

He was genuinely annoyed. In hindsight, if he had swung the sword downward instead of stabbing, he wouldn’t have suffered this bite.  

Two measly Scale Demons had reduced him to such a state. Had there been even one more, he might not have made it.  

But this was unavoidable. Jiang Li had no experience fighting monsters—or even humans, for that matter. Lacking combat instincts was only natural, something he’d have to work on.  

"Hey kid, you’ve got a tough life. A bite this bad, and you barely bled."  

Soon, a martial artist arrived to treat Jiang Li’s wound, while the uninjured Yan Hong was sent off to dig graves—many had died that night, and they needed to be buried properly.  

After removing Yan Hong’s sloppy bandaging, the martial artist examined the wound with interest.  

This black-clad fighter was clearly skilled—cleaning the wound with warm water, disinfecting it with strong liquor, then applying medicine and fresh bandages. For them, treating such injuries was routine.  

Jiang Li couldn’t exactly explain that he’d simply removed the "Bleeding" status effect, so he just laughed it off, claiming his martial training made him resilient.  

He also noticed this martial artist was younger than the others and far more approachable, so he struck up a conversation.
