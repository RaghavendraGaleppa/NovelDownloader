**Chapter 155: Lu Zizai**

In front of the stone mountain, a fiery spring transformed into a babbling stream, flowing past a cluster of verdant bamboo. The area was fresh, serene, and secluded.

The youth in coarse linen clothes circled Qin Ming, then let out a light shout, "Old geezer, stop pretending to be young! Hmph, show your true form!" He breathed out golden light, his voice like a clap of thunder, radiating a powerful aura. But... nothing happened.

Qin Ming eyed him strangely. Had this rather immortal-like youth perhaps visited the Divine Fall Plain and been kicked in the head by Lü Chongxiao?

The linen-clad youth frowned, scrutinizing Qin Ming up and down, a pensive look on his face.

"Which one of us is strange?" Qin Ming asked.

"You are," the youth, a person of strong convictions, said to him. "You're in the Newborn realm, yet your lifespan far exceeds your current cultivation stage." He then stared at Qin Ming, continuing, "I'm extremely sensitive to longevity and eternal life. I suspect you're an old geezer who has shed your past self, accumulated life force, and re-emerged in a youthful form."

"There are such people?" Qin Ming was greatly astonished.

"Even transcendent beings exist, so what's so strange about that?" The youth said nonchalantly, fixing his gaze on Qin Ming's eyes. After careful discernment, he decided Qin Ming truly didn't resemble an old monster.

Qin Ming immediately grew interested. "Then tell me in detail about those situations. Also, what's my current lifespan?"

"You can live for at least two hundred and fifty years," the youth stated with certainty.

"Two hundred and sixty!" Qin Ming corrected, feeling like he was being insulted.

"Close enough," the linen-clad youth, his eyes like polished lacquer, nodded seriously.

Qin Ming observed him closely, finding him somewhat unfathomable. He was a person of extremely strong will, incapable of emotional fluctuations that could be resonated with.

"Could it be that *you* are an 'old senior'?" Qin Ming, using the youth's own manner, scrutinized him and posed the question. He looked again at the youth's jet-black hair, noting that the roots were indeed silvery white. He grew increasingly suspicious: *Could he truly be an old geezer?*

The youth chuckled, "I'm only eighteen! I just had a problem with my cultivation, but I'll recover immediately!" Then, he grew serious again, staring at Qin Ming. "You're a person in the Newborn realm, so why is your lifespan so high?"

"I possess extraordinary talent!" Qin Ming looked at him, guessing again, "Could you be a permanently possessed individual?" The youth showed no signs of aging, his eyes were clear, and he shook his head in denial.

Qin Ming took a deep breath, green light swirling around his body. He activated a secret method from the Vermilion Wood Scripture to observe the youth, a fresh, verdant aura permeating the air. The Vermilion Wood Scripture was exceptionally unique, capable of extending life, and held profound insights in this domain. Qin Ming confirmed that a vibrant life force flowed within the youth, and his spiritual will possessed the unique charm of youth, without a trace of decay or decline.

"You certainly have many tricks," the linen-clad youth said. "You claim to be extraordinarily talented, so let me test you. Let's see if you can take a palm strike from me." As he spoke, his demeanor changed. He raised a single hand, and it was as if a bright moon had risen from the sea, enveloping him. Its pure radiance flowed, making him seem ethereal and transcendent.

Qin Ming was slightly startled. This person's attacks came with anomalous phenomena. Were all the gifted youths in the Ancestral Court this powerful? He quickly spoke, "Wait, you're at least in the Outer Saint realm, right? I'm still in the Newborn realm; how could I block you?"

The linen-clad youth shook his head, "Don't worry, I'm only using Heavenly Radiance Energy of the Newborn realm, not exceeding the realm's limits."

Qin Ming smiled, "In that case, you should be careful yourself."

"Quite confident, aren't we? Come!" The youth raised his hand, standing within a bright moon, extraordinarily refined, fully exhibiting the demeanor of a grandmaster. He was truly unique.

Qin Ming grew serious. "Be careful!" His fist erupted with dazzling golden light, seeming to distort space itself. Out of respect for the youth, he struck with utmost seriousness. He just felt the youth was very strange and dared not be careless.

"Quite skilled!" The youth pressed down with a single hand. With a boom, it was as if a clap of thunder had erupted. Both the sound and the light were incredibly similar. Golden radiance clashed with pure white holy light, then exploded. This was Heavenly Radiance Energy beyond the norm, rarely seen in the Newborn realm!

The youth was greatly shocked, because he was retreating—one step, two steps... seven steps! This felt incredible to him, like he was seeing a ghost. Was this what a disciple who had just entered the Ancestral Court was supposed to be like?

Qin Ming's expression was solemn. "You're actually this strong?!"

The linen-clad youth froze. Shouldn't *he* be the one saying those words? Yet the person opposite him had spoken first.

Qin Ming murmured, "To merely retreat, the Six-Imperial Ancestral Court truly conceals dragons and crouches tigers."

The youth felt something was amiss. He had been repelled, and the other person was still reflecting on it. This was outrageous!

"Again, I'll be serious this time!" The youth said in a deep voice. He had never been defeated in the Newborn realm, yet he was being underestimated in his own Ancestral Court!

"Brother, how should I address you?" Qin Ming asked seriously, recognizing him as an extraordinary individual.

"Lu Zizai. And you?" the youth asked casually in return.

"Qin Ming."

"Alright, this time I'll truly gauge you." Lu Zizai said, his aura changing once more. His entire body became dazzling, as if he stood within a blazing sun. The light was so piercing it made one's eyes ache, almost bringing tears.

Qin Ming's expression grew solemn. This opponent was too special. He hadn't been boasting earlier; the youth had truly not used his full power in his first strike.

Lu Zizai was like the Son of the Sun God, illuminating all directions. Terrifying Heavenly Radiance Energy hadn't even been fully unleashed, yet thunderous roars already erupted, deafening! In the distance, Zhou Tao and Zhou Shize heard the commotion and rushed over immediately. Upon seeing the scene, they merely glanced, then silently retreated.

Qin Ming erupted, equally radiating intense light, and actively punched out. In mid-air, their fists collided. Dazzling golden light shot out, like streaks of lightning weaving through the void, covering and engulfing them both. The rocks and mountain walls near them crumbled into dust; anything they touched was scraped away and shattered as if by sharp blades against decaying wood.

This time, Lu Zizai was truly astonished, for he retreated another three steps. This somewhat overturned his understanding, as he had genuinely never been defeated at this stage!

Qin Ming's heart was greatly shaken. The Six-Imperial Ancestral Court was far more profound than he had imagined, to randomly encounter such a youth. In the end, he could only sigh, "Impressive!"

Lu Zizai's eyes were deep. Was this a compliment to his opponent?!

"Again!" he said in a deep voice, as both the bright moon and the blazing sun appeared simultaneously.

"You can get even stronger?" Qin Ming suddenly felt his pressure double. He was indeed shocked.

Lu Zizai heard this and found it increasingly off-putting. In the past, wasn't *he* the one commenting on others like this? Today was truly outrageous; he actually suffered a minor setback.

From afar, many disciples heard the thunderous sounds and were about to rush over, but they were stopped by Zhou Tao, Zhou Shize, and a few other old men.

Beside Lu Zizai, the bright moon transformed into black, and the blazing sun intensified to a blinding white. The two then intertwined, chasing each other like two fish swimming in a circle. As he raised his hand, Yin and Yang energy began flowing around his palm.

Qin Ming's expression was exceptionally serious. "Who exactly are you?" Although he hadn't seen the complete Six-Imperial Heart Sutra, he knew that this person was quite extraordinary. Even those who mastered Two-Imperial Force in the Newborn realm would find it incredibly difficult to start with Yin and Yang.

"I'm not one of those old geezers you imagine, but I do indeed have some background," Lu Zizai stated frankly.

This time, Qin Ming's body manifested layers upon layers of light; twenty-seven divine rings appeared simultaneously, as if he had stepped into a sacred pure land, his entire body radiating dazzling light.

"Your Heavenly Radiance Energy feels familiar, somewhat déjà vu," Lu Zizai surprisingly said.

In an instant, the two erupted in a grand collision that ordinary Newborn cultivators could hardly imagine! The black and white Yin and Yang energies, and the layered divine rings, crashed together, unleashing astonishing Heavenly Radiance Energy aftershocks. The area was like a thunder and lightning storm, and even the night mist dispersed. Had their Heavenly Radiance not been unable to spread too far, this place might have been razed to the ground, with nothing left.

Qin Ming's body swayed slightly, while Lu Zizai retreated one step. This time, Qin Ming said nothing, but watched his opponent. *Could he still get stronger? This guy is too evil! Something feels off!*

"You're truly strong!" Lu Zizai exclaimed. Then, within his black and white energies, another streak of purple energy actually rose.

Qin Ming immediately felt as if facing a great enemy, sensing something utterly outrageous. His high estimation of the Six-Imperial Ancestral Court was indeed correct; someone had actually cultivated Three-Imperial Force! In an instant, he felt terrifying pressure. Over there, with the addition of purple energy to the black and white, the Heavenly Radiance Energy had undergone a qualitative improvement. Qin Ming broke out in a sweat for the first time, but he couldn't wipe it away. He stood ready, preparing to receive an even more terrifying strike from his opponent!

However, Lu Zizai suddenly dissipated the purple energy, then retracted the black and white energies into his body. The area instantly became calm; he did not deliver that final palm strike.

"Was that Three-Imperial Force?" Qin Ming asked very seriously.

Lu Zizai nodded, "You don't need to be fixated on how many Imperial Forces. Some people can break Two-Imperial Force with just One-Imperial Force. One must comprehend the true essence; it's not a simple stacking of power." He added, "My Two-Imperial Force can break another's Three-Imperial Force."

"I know you're formidable. I was just comparing your Three-Imperial Force to my Heavenly Radiance Energy. Why did you hold back?" Qin Ming asked.

Lu Zizai shook his head, "You've only undergone your seventh rebirth. For me to use Three-Imperial Force against you would be excessive; it wouldn't be a fair victory."

"You can tell?"

"A select few with extraordinary perception, if they master the secret methods within the Ancestral Court and investigate carefully, can discern your situation. You've only just undergone your seventh rebirth," Lu Zizai said.

"Do Elder Zhou Tao and the others know?" Qin Ming felt uneasy.

"They are not among them. Such individuals with extraordinary perception are at least peak-level gifted ones. Your concealment method, 'Blending with Light and Dust,' isn't complete. Since you're worried, I'll complete it for you." Lu Zizai imparted a set of verbal formulas to him.

Qin Ming looked surprised. "Are you truly not an old monster?"

"I'm only eighteen!" Lu Zizai emphasized, seeming quite sensitive about his age.

"What are your plans? To join the Six-Imperial Ancestral Court, or do you have other ideas?" Lu Zizai asked. Then he chuckled, "It's fine, speak freely. I won't report you, because I'm planning to run away myself."

"Ah?" Qin Ming was astonished. Was such a formidable figure planning to leave the Ancestral Court? He asked, "Do you see the Six-Imperial Ancestral Court decaying and declining, so you're eager to cut ties?"

Lu Zizai sneered, "Who said the Six-Imperial Ancestral Court is finished? Only a fool would dare to probe and seek death. Look at the truly great figures, does any of them dare to come?" He commented, "The chaos of the Six-Imperial Ancestral Court began internally. Factions abound, and most elders come from a few major families. How can it last long like this? If the lineage doesn't undergo a fundamental renewal, it cannot be reborn."

"Who exactly are you?" Qin Ming truly couldn't hold back anymore. He didn't believe this was merely a disciple.
