# Chapter 42: The Provincial Examination (Part 2)

With a calm mind and prepared thoughts, Zhou Qing began tackling the first exam question: "When Shun lived deep in the mountains." 

This was a familiar topic from his studies of eight-legged essay history. Xu Guangqi had encountered this very question during his provincial examination and had approached it from the perspective of the School of Mind philosophy. In this world, both the School of Mind and School of Principle coexisted, though without such towering figures as Cheng-Zhu or Lu-Wang. Both schools shared common origins, making either approach acceptable in the examinations.

Zhou Qing wasn't particularly worried about examiners being exclusively from the School of Principle faction. From Miss Lin, he had learned that Examiner Lu himself leaned toward the School of Mind. As deputy chief examiner for this special provincial examination, Examiner Lu would have significant influence during grading.

Having weighed the pros and cons, Zhou Qing decided to adapt Xu Guangqi's famous approach: "The heart of a sage emperor is empty yet comprehending all..." He drafted this response first.

For the next two familiar questions, Zhou Qing also prepared drafts. The remaining four questions were standard fare, which he answered based on his own understanding of eight-legged essays. After completing drafts for all seven questions from the Four Books and Five Classics, he carefully revised them, removing any overly novel ideas and replacing them with more conventional content. While this made his memorized model essays somewhat less brilliant, it made them safer.

There were no right or wrong answers in these classical essays—success depended largely on the examiners' preferences and alignment with current political trends. Unless one's antiquarian views particularly appealed to an examiner, they would likely lower one's score.

After transcribing his revised drafts onto the official exam papers, Zhou Qing had finished before two hours had passed. In the afternoon, he turned to the policy essay question about the severity of punishments. Many classical texts could be cited here, including Su Shi's famous essay on criminal justice—though that contained fictional references only someone as bold as Su Dongpo would dare include in an actual exam.

Zhou Qing synthesized ideas from various sources, carefully removing any radical or inappropriate content. Policy essays allowed more room for literary flair than eight-legged essays. By evening, he had completed a polished essay that left him feeling he'd achieved new mastery. Checking his "Cultivation Master" ability, he noticed his initially faint "literary courage" had become solid again—likely because his total immersion in writing had infused his words with vitality.

He waited until the end of the first day's exam period before submitting his papers. Outside, the snow had stopped but the cold intensified. Provincial exams here lasted two consecutive days, with examinees resting overnight in their cells between sessions. Bathroom breaks were strictly limited—twice for minor needs, once for major.

By the second day, some examinees had fallen ill but had no choice but to persevere. This session included another classical question along with practical writing exercises—edicts, judgments, memorials, and proclamations. While less important than the first day's essays, performing poorly here could still result in failure since these tested essential bureaucratic skills.

By morning, many examinees began submitting their papers—mostly those in poor health rather than those who had excelled. Zhou Qing, though finished early, waited until afternoon to submit and leave calmly. This exam tested not just knowledge but also physical endurance and willpower—areas where he excelled.

"Junior brother, you've finished!" Fushong greeted him outside with visible relief. Though still somewhat weak himself, Zhou Qing emerged from the snowy examination halls looking remarkably energetic. 

"You've suffered much these days, senior brother," Zhou Qing said, making Fushong emotional—years had passed since he last endured such hardships. 

"Let's eat. What would you like?" Zhou Qing asked. 

"Beef," Fushong replied. 

"But you observe dietary precepts!" 

"Today I break them for you." 

Though beef was technically prohibited, many still ate it—usually from animals officially certified as having died naturally. The rules around such certifications were, of course, flexible.

Meanwhile, the grading process began. Examiner Lu initially thought the outstanding exam papers must belong to some returning scholar rather than Zhou Qing. He considered that if Zhou Qing failed, he might take him under his wing in the capital—a promising protégé from humble origins could become both an intellectual heir and family protector.

When the top three papers were presented for final ranking, Chief Examiner Song preferred one with an exceptional policy essay—unbeknownst to him, Zhou Qing's work. Examiner Lu, assuming it belonged to someone else, agreed. Only when the name was revealed did he stare in shock—Zhou Qing of Jiangzhou, a region not known for scholarly achievement.

"Nine-Five: The dragon soars in heaven. It furthers one to see the great man," Fushong quoted the I Ching divination about the upcoming results. Zhou Qing had moved to an inn near the examination compound to await results, avoiding the now-troublesome Wanfu Inn.

The harsh spring weather during the exams had weeded out many candidates, but Zhou Qing remained unaffected—a natural advantage. With thirty positions available, his chances seemed strong.

The seven classical essays and policy essay carried the most weight, while the bureaucratic writing exercises simply needed competence. Chief Examiner Song remained outside the grading hall, leaving Deputy Examiner Lu to oversee the process.

Examiner Lu worried momentarily about Zhang Shen's absence but was relieved Zhou Qing had participated. As the examiner who had awarded Zhou Qing first place in the preliminary exams, he felt special concern for this promising but poor scholar who reminded him of his younger self.

Three days later, Zhou Qing's papers emerged with top marks—three essays were deemed superior even to Examiner Lu's own youthful work, while the other four matched his prime. Such quality could compete at the national level, let alone the provincial exams. The grading officials, recognizing the Jiangzhou origin, assumed this must be some returning scholar's work.

Examiner Lu sighed—with three years of his tutelage, Zhou Qing might have reached this level. He imagined taking this talented disciple to the capital, someone who could inherit his legacy and support his family. Zhou's policy essay, profound yet conventional, earned Examiner Lu's approval and was forwarded to Chief Examiner Song with recommendations.

Other Jiangzhou papers were mediocre at best, with one possibly being Zhou Qing's weaker effort. Discovering only nine Jiangzhou submissions (with Zhang Shen apparently absent), Examiner Lu felt relieved—selecting one Jiangzhou scholar was acceptable; two would invite criticism given the region's poor examination history.

At the final ranking meeting ten days later, Chief Examiner Song and Examiner Lu deliberated over the top three papers. When Song selected the one with the outstanding policy essay (Zhou Qing's), Examiner Lu—still thinking it belonged to someone else—agreed, though he regretted Zhou Qing's likely failure. Secretly, he looked forward to mentoring Zhou Qing after the exams.

When the name was revealed—Zhou Qing of Jiangzhou—the other officials were puzzled by the unfamiliar name from an obscure region. Only Examiner Lu stood dumbfounded, his plans upended by this unexpected outcome.
