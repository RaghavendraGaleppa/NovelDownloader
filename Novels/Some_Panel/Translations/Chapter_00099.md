# Chapter 98: Three Thousand Great Realms, Three Thousand Realm-Suppressing Treasures

Yang Ji was stopped by True Disciple Hao Yun for questioning. He immediately clutched his storage bag and dared not linger, quickly flying out of the city and returning to the sect via a teleportation array.

Inside the main hall of Dao Peak, Wuji Dao Sect, Yang Ji, with a flick of his wrist, took out the Mountain Sea Pearl and immediately began refining it. As it was an ownerless item and the Mountain Sea Pearl didn't reject him, the refining process was extremely smooth. In just a month, the refining was complete, and he successfully recognized it as his master.

At this moment, Yang Ji held the Mountain Sea Pearl in his palm. With a thought, the pearl instantly became as large as a head. With another thought, it shrunk to the size of a grain of rice. Then, with another thought, the originally semi-transparent Mountain Sea Pearl changed color, becoming murky like rice water. It was difficult to see the scene inside with the naked eye; it appeared more ordinary and covert, indistinguishable from a common, low-quality jade bead.

To avoid being discovered while cultivating the Primordial Divine Tree, Yang Ji hid inside the Mountain Sea Pearl, found a hidden spot, and sat down cross-legged. Only then did he excitedly take out the Primordial Divine Tree Shard. It was the size of a pinky finger, like a wooden-colored amber, completely unremarkable. Who would have thought this was once part of the Primordial Divine Tree? Yang Ji held it in his hand, looking at it, and finally couldn't help but grin. This opportunity was truly immense.

After carefully examining it, he followed the information prompt and placed it into his dantian. He enveloped it with Samadhi True Fire, providing it with a suitable temperature, like incubating an egg, so it could sprout and grow smoothly. When the Primordial Divine Tree shard entered the Samadhi True Fire, information immediately appeared: [Current suitable cultivation temperature: 8523 degrees.] Yang Ji immediately adjusted the flame's temperature. After maintaining the suitable temperature for thirty breaths, the Primordial Divine Tree shard instantly underwent a very subtle change. A very faint layer of green spiritual light appeared on its surface, as if it were breathing, beginning to rhythmically contract.

"It's showing divine properties!" Yang Ji stared intently at this scene, secretly delighted. Who else could find the suitable cultivation temperature like him? Perhaps only a handful could achieve this. Even if others obtained a Primordial Divine Tree shard, they likely wouldn't be able to discern its profound mysteries. Soon, he further confirmed his thoughts, as the cultivation temperature conditions subtly changed again: [Current suitable cultivation temperature: 8522 degrees.] Yang Ji immediately adjusted. Soon, information appeared on the Primordial Divine Tree shard again: [Hungry! Very hungry!]

Hungry? Being hungry is good. A small tree won't thrive if it doesn't eat. Yang Ji grinned, threw the already prepared Vajra Wood into his dantian, and prepared to separate a ball of Samadhi True Fire to melt its essence out. But who would have thought that as soon as the Vajra Wood entered the dantian, it was like iron meeting a magnet, instantly clinging to the Primordial Divine Tree shard with a whoosh. No, to be precise, it wasn't clinging, but embracing. At this moment, two streaks of green light appeared on the surface of the Primordial Divine Tree shard, like arms, tightly "embracing" the Vajra Wood. The layer of green light on the surface contracted and flashed, like sucking milk, vigorously gnawing on the Vajra Wood, causing threads of woody essence, like green smoke, to drift from its surface. As the green light on the surface of the Primordial Divine Tree shard rhythmically contracted, the woody essence slowly merged into the shard. Immediately, information appeared on the Primordial Divine Tree shard again: [Delicious, delicious!]

This scene was unexpected for Yang Ji. According to his original plan, if the Samadhi True Fire couldn't refine the woody essence, he intended to learn a wood-attribute cultivation method. But it seemed unnecessary now. This Primordial Divine Tree shard was too miraculous; it was practically the bane of all wood, taking in a large mouthful of wood-attribute essence with a single suck. With this, what wood-attribute cultivation method could compare to it? Even a supreme Dao-grade wood-attribute cultivation method might not be more powerful than it.

In just ten breaths, an arm-sized piece of Vajra Wood, which was originally full of color and dotted with spiritual light, now turned into a piece of withered, rotten wood. Yang Ji took it out and touched it lightly; it immediately crumbled into a pile of dust and scattered. It sucked dry a piece of thousand-year Vajra Wood in ten breaths; this was too terrifying. But the more terrifying it was, the more excited Yang Ji became. Seeing [Hungry, so hungry, I want to eat, I want to eat!] appear on the surface of the Primordial Divine Tree shard, Yang Ji hastily waved out a pile of wood-attribute spiritual items. This time, he was no longer stingy, directly throwing all spiritual items like Blood Vine, Green Willow Branch, Dragon Blood Wood, Earth-Suppressing Divine Wood, Withered Wood Vine, Peach Wood Bead, Golden Bamboo, etc., into his dantian. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! As expected, the green light embraced them, and the Primordial Divine Tree shard gathered all the spiritual items and began to devour them heartily once more.

Yang Ji watched in utter amazement. As expected of the Mother of Worlds, the Ancestor of Ten Thousand Trees; merely a small fragment displayed such miraculous properties. If it were the complete Primordial Divine Tree, with its crown spread out, radiating across the entire Primordial World, what a magnificent sight would that be? What kind of divine might would it possess? At this moment, Yang Ji no longer doubted that such a divine tree could bear Dao Fruits. The miraculous properties possessed by this realm-suppressing treasure of the Primordial World were beyond his current imagination.

It was recorded in the book "Cultivation World" that among the Three Thousand Great Realms, each great realm possessed realm-suppressing treasures similar to the Primordial Divine Tree, which were supreme treasures naturally formed between heaven and earth. Legend has it that the realm-suppressing treasure of the Primordial Cultivation Realm is the Primordial Stone, that of the Profound Yellow Cultivation Realm is the Profound Yellow Pagoda, that of the Nine Origins Cultivation Realm is the Nine Origins Sword, and that of the Primordial Beginning Cultivation Realm is the Primordial Beginning Banner. Unfortunately, all these realm-suppressing supreme treasures were taken by the oldest Immortal Kings of the Immortal Realm, making it difficult for later generations to witness their splendor.

At the auction, the reason why the replica Flying Immortal Boat was so sought after, despite being only a mid-grade Dao artifact, it could sell for an exorbitant price of over a hundred billion, was precisely because the "Flying Immortal Boat" was once the realm-suppressing treasure of the Juntian Cultivation Realm. Now, even a replica carried great karma and immense fortune. It is rumored that if one carries the replica "Flying Immortal Boat" while undergoing tribulation in the Juntian Cultivation Realm, the heavenly tribulation will be significantly weaker, increasing the chances of passing nine heavenly tribulations and becoming a Nine Tribulation Immortal.

At this moment, Yang Ji, watching the Primordial Divine Tree shard display its great power, suddenly recalled the scattered words recorded in the book. If this were truly the case, then the value and significance of this Primordial Divine Tree shard would be immense, far beyond what any replica of a realm-suppressing treasure could compare to. Thinking of this, Yang Ji's expression involuntarily grew serious. This Primordial Divine Tree shard was too significant; it absolutely could not be exposed. Previously, he had planned to let the Buddha Child also reside in this Mountain Sea World, but now that was absolutely out of the question. If what was recorded in the book was true, then wouldn't it be much easier for him to pass the Immortal Thunder Tribulation with this Primordial Divine Tree shard than for others? Thinking this, Yang Ji couldn't help but feel a little excited. He looked at the Primordial Divine Tree shard in his dantian, cherishing it more and more with each glance.

However, a month later, his expression couldn't help but turn bitter. This little shard was too gluttonous. In just one month, it had consumed all the wood-attribute spiritual items he brought from the Myriad Realms Alliance, yet it showed no signs of sprouting. Yang Ji had no choice but to brazenly seek out Bai Bier again, saying he needed large quantities of wood-attribute spiritual items. Bai Bier readily agreed. Yang Ji noticed something off about her smiling gaze; the display above her head had changed from [Curious] to [Intensely Curious]. He couldn't help but wonder what exactly Bai Bier was curious about. However, no matter what she was curious about, as long as there was no hostility or trickery, Yang Ji was happy for her to remain curious.

And so, time flowed, years rushed by, and three years passed in the blink of an eye. Yang Ji was simultaneously comprehending the Three Immortal Arrays and cultivating the Primordial Divine Tree with the resources provided by Bai Bier, everything proceeding in an orderly fashion. However, during this period, he had already accumulated a debt of over a hundred million pills to the Myriad Realms Alliance. Yang Ji occasionally rubbed his brows, feeling quite distressed. This Primordial Divine Tree shard only ate and didn't sprout. He cried out that he was raising a money-devouring beast; this gluttonous mouth was too wasteful. Fortunately, the green light on it became increasingly vibrant, and its divine properties became more extraordinary, which made Yang Ji feel a little better.

During this period, to increase his affinity with the Primordial Divine Tree shard, he also fed it with his essence blood from time to time. Initially, the green light of the Primordial Divine Tree shard resisted his aura. Later, it remained motionless even when he stroked it with his divine sense, and even transmitted the information [Dependent]. This swept away the frustration in Yang Ji's heart. Besides being happy, he also felt much better.
