# Chapter 57: Innate Spiritual Farmer Saint Body  

"It's strange how much autonomy this Brother Gu Mo seems to have," Gou Youyu muttered, frowning slightly as he watched Gu Mo depart. The negotiations had been settled almost entirely by Gu Mo himself.  

Fifty catties of Water Spirit Rice—this was something far beyond what a mere outer sect disciple like Gu Mo should have the authority to decide. Even if the deal was mutually beneficial, he should have at least reported it to the higher-ups behind him.  

"Unless..."  

Suddenly, a startling thought crossed Gou Youyu's mind, but he quickly shook his head, dismissing it as too far-fetched.  

In the end, he abandoned his wild speculations. For now, his priority was to brew these Water Spirit Rice grains into spirit wine. This was his first time using such high-quality rice, and failure was not an option.  

---  

"Shopkeeper Gou must have already guessed something," Gu Mo mused on his way back to the Spiritual Planting Hall.  

During this transaction, Gu Mo hadn't acted like a mere errand boy for some higher authority. The reason was simple—he no longer saw the need to hide.  

His current strength was on par with Gou Youyu's, and news of his success in cultivating Water Spirit Rice had likely spread throughout the Spiritual Planting Hall. Since it was no longer a secret, Gu Mo saw no reason to keep up the pretense.  

Moreover, as their cooperation deepened, many matters would require direct communication between them. For instance, if Gu Mo had questions about the "Wine God Soul-Tempering Technique," he couldn't keep pretending to consult some mysterious backer before relaying the answers days later. That would be too inefficient.

"Brother Gu Mo!"  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo!"  

As he returned to the Spiritual Planting Hall and headed straight for the seed repository, Gu Mo was met with enthusiastic greetings from both outer and inner sect disciples alike.  

Just as he had expected, news of his successful cultivation of Water Spirit Rice had spread. At first, disbelief had been the common reaction—until someone confirmed it with Zhao Qiancheng. Only then did everyone reluctantly accept the truth.  

A mere outer sect disciple, who had only joined the Spiritual Planting Hall two and a half years ago, had actually succeeded in growing first-grade, high-tier Water Spirit Rice. It was...  

Stunned beyond words, the disciples of the Spiritual Planting Hall struggled to describe Gu Mo's monstrous talent. Eventually, someone coined a title for him—the "Innate Spiritual Farmer Saint Body"—and it stuck.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, are you here to collect seeds? Please, go ahead of me!" At the seed repository, several outer sect disciples were already in line for the next season's seeds. The one at the front immediately offered his spot to Gu Mo.  

---  

With Gu Mo's ability to cultivate Water Spirit Rice now revealed, everyone around him had suddenly become exceedingly friendly.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"  

Gu Mo didn't decline the courtesy. Most of his 200 catties of Water Spirit Rice had likely been exchanged among the inner sect disciples of the Spiritual Planting Hall.  

Since this batch was considered surplus yield, other disciples in the sect hadn't yet caught wind of it. But once the hall reported the harvest, the rice would quickly become common knowledge—and then it would be much harder to obtain.  

However, as long as they stayed on good terms with Gu Mo, the disciple who could grow Water Spirit Rice, securing more in the future wouldn't be an issue.  

After smoothly collecting the seeds, Gu Mo left the Spiritual Planting Hall amidst a chorus of warm farewells and returned to his humble cottage by the fields.  

Replanting the Sunflowers and Peashooters in his spiritual field, Gu Mo began cultivating the next season's Water Spirit Rice. His future exemption from field rents depended on it.  

---  

"Hmm?"  

Just as he was about to start planting, the formation around his field was lightly disturbed—not an intrusion, but more like a knock. This usually happened when neither party had a communication talisman.  

Setting aside his work, Gu Mo stepped outside the formation to find an unfamiliar figure waiting. The man wore the gray robes of an outer sect disciple from the Spiritual Planting Hall, and his age suggested he had been there for many years.  

The man's purpose was simple: to offer gifts, make an acquaintance, and hopefully secure some Water Spirit Rice—at a premium price, of course.  

Gu Mo politely declined, citing his need for the rice to break through to the second level of Qi Refinement. However, he promised to spare some in the next harvest if there was surplus.  

The elder disciple was satisfied. Water Spirit Rice was a high-tier spiritual grain, something an outer sect disciple like him could hardly obtain. Even if he had to wait another year, the opportunity was rare.  

After him, more disciples—both inner and outer sect—came to visit, turning Gu Mo's once-quiet fields into a bustling hub.  

Truly, poverty kept one unnoticed even in a crowded city, while wealth drew distant relatives even in the deepest mountains.  

Eventually, Gu Mo hung a "Closed for Cultivation" sign and announced that part of the next harvest would be publicly sold. Only then did peace return to his fields.  

---  

In the days that followed, Gu Mo resumed his routine of farming and cultivation—though now, his focus was on the Wine God Soul-Tempering Technique. With the help of the spirit wine gifted by Gou Youyu, his progress was steady. The technique was profound, using intoxication to temper the soul—the higher the wine's grade, the better the results. A rather expensive cultivation method.  

As for his Qi Refinement progress, it remained stagnant. For now, all the solar essence he harvested went into upgrading his Sunflowers. In half a year, he would have a second-tier Sunflower—something he eagerly anticipated.  

---  

*Buzz!*  

One day, as Gu Mo was irrigating his fields with the Minor Cloud Rain Technique, his communication jade vibrated. Currently, there was only one person who could contact him this way.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, you kept this from me! Get me a hundred catties of Water Spirit Rice, quick!"  

As soon as he opened the formation, a lively figure rushed in—Yuan Niya, her face alight with excitement.  

She had come to the Spiritual Planting Hall to collect her inner sect disciple benefits when she heard about an outer sect disciple who had successfully cultivated Water Spirit Rice. Immediately, she thought of Gu Mo—she had known about his attempts but wasn't sure if he'd succeeded.  

Now, it seemed he had. After a quick inquiry confirmed it was indeed him, she hurried over.  

Even as an inner sect disciple, her annual allocation of Water Spirit Rice was only a few dozen catties. With limited yields and many inner sect disciples, the portions were naturally small.  

But now that Gu Mo had succeeded, she could finally get more.
