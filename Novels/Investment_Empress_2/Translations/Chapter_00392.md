# Chapter 392: A Standoff Between Supreme Experts? The Elders Are Stunned

Inside the Hot Pot Restaurant.

The space around Mei Yun seemed to twist faintly as she released her Inner Scene field to block the divine intent of the Golden Dragon Suppression of the Emperor from the Divine Sword.

Yet, she still couldn't help but feel an urge to kneel and submit in her heart.

His Highness has become even stronger.

People often criticize and say that the Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty, Jiang Yu, is ranked first by the Heavenly Profound Sect solely because of the dynasty's prestige.

But that is not the case.

As the top of the Hidden Dragon List, Jiang Yu's strength is in a league of its own. He has long since left the second and third geniuses far behind. At the very least, the gap between him and Xie Xuan is visible to the naked eye...

"Li Mo..."

Mei Yun wanted to persuade the young man to lower his head.

First, from the perspective of strength.

Jiang Yu has already opened the nine orifices of the Divine Perception Realm. Under the heavens, it is likely that no one in the Divine Perception Realm can surpass him. It would be difficult even if they were in the same realm, let alone the fact that Li Mo has only opened five orifices...

Thinking of this, Mei Yun suddenly froze.

Beneath the Golden Dragon Imperial City, the rolling divine might was pouring down, all directed at a single person.

Yet, that person stood straight and unyielding.

Li Mo's expression was blank as he held a short-handled hammer with an uncanny design in his hand. Behind him, the shadow of a Divine Intent was burning amidst the rain of divine might.

That Divine Intent, though called a Divine General, was wild and untamed. Though it appeared as a beast, it stood tall and proud amidst the howling wind.

Not only was there no sign of it being suppressed, but it was growing even more intense.

Jiang Yu's voice was devoid of emotion: "Who do you think you are to interfere in my family affairs?"

Li Mo replied seriously, "She is an employee of my shop."

Jiang Yu actually laughed upon hearing this, then retracted his smile and looked at Jiang Chulong.

"Come here."

Hearing his words, Jiang Chulong felt a subconscious panic in her heart.

In a daze, the image of a figure holding a knife with a sullen face, telling her to come over, appeared before her eyes once more.

"No one can force you."

But at that moment, Jiang Chulong heard that familiar voice in her ear again.

The scene from back then suddenly blurred, transforming into the sunny smile of Big Brother Li.

She lowered her small head and stopped chasing the girl in the pink dress. Her lips moved for a long time before she squeezed her eyes shut and shouted loudly:

"I don't want to!"

The little Princess Jiang had never spoken so loudly before.

This shout stunned Jiang Yu for a moment, and then anger finally appeared on his handsome face.

The Divine Intent, which was already overwhelmingly powerful, became even more suffocating.

Just how strong is the top of the Hidden Dragon List?

What is the gap between me and him right now?

What will be the consequences of fighting?

Li Mo thought of many things in an instant, but his thoughts were incredibly fast.

His answer was to grip the hammer in his hand tightly, channel the power of the world, and prepare his strongest strike.

If the situation developed differently from what he expected, then he could only use the final rule of the fighting king's code.

Just fight!

But fortunately, the genius Li Mo did not guess wrong this time.

"Insolence!"

A thunderous voice rang out from the sky outside the window.

It was the protector secretly following Jiang Yu.

Regardless of victory or defeat, in the eyes of that expert, Li Mo, who wielded a divine weapon, was clad in the power of the world, and possessed a strange Divine Intent, was already enough to pose a threat to Jiang Yu.

His duty was to protect the prince, so he would not allow even the slightest bit of harm.

The moment the other party spoke, the colors of the heavens and earth changed. It was as if, in an instant, only black and white remained. The air seemed to solidify instantly, turning into divine iron.

A single wisp of pressure descended, enough to make an Inner Scene Realm expert unable to even move a finger.

As the world pressed down, a faint golden, glazed light appeared around Li Mo, protecting his soul and physical body, and it actually withstood the pressure head-on.

The Golden Body Invulnerability did not last long.

But it was enough for him to say one sentence.

"My guest has an extraordinary background, but my Hot Pot Restaurant isn't to be trifled with either!"

In the back courtyard, a powerful aura also surged.

It was his external incarnation, activating the Shem God Pearl to do what he was most familiar with.

Adding special effects!

---

In the colorless world, a swaying green lotus grew, untainted by dust, pure and clear.

It was rooted in the chaos of the void, its nine leaves like a canopy, the meanings of growth, destruction, withering, and flourishing cycling continuously, as if it had traversed time and space to arrive.

In the center of the green lotus sat a figure, its face indistinct, yet one could feel its unparalleled elegance.

Mei Yun: "???"

When did such a powerful expert hide in the back courtyard of the hot pot restaurant?

The little Princess Jiang was also confused, yet she felt a sense of familiarity.

It seemed that a scene like this had appeared in the stories her master had told her...

Li Mo patted her head and put his finger to his lips, telling her to stay quiet for now.

"From where did you come, sir?"

A thunderous voice boomed in the void, the protector behind the Prince posed the question.

"From where I came from."

The figure in the center of the green lotus said calmly.

"Do you know what karma you have stirred up? Are you not afraid of being held accountable afterward?"

The thunder echoed across the sky again. The protector seemed to have become angry, ready to strike with thunderous force at any moment.

"Hmph..."

The figure on the green lotus let out a cold laugh:

"When I act, why do I need to explain myself to others!"

The green light flared, and the figure sitting on the green lotus suddenly stood up, ready for a fight without hesitation!

"......"

An eerie silence fell.

After a long silence, the protector finally let out a cold snort and slowly withdrew, restoring the colorless world to its original appearance.

Li Mo's expression remained calm and indifferent, but he heaved a huge sigh of relief in his heart.

Fortunately, the other party's mission was to ensure the safety of the Great Yu Crown Prince. He was hesitant to act, afraid to fight a peer at full force.

"We will meet again."

Jiang Yu's dual pupils stared deeply at him.

It was unclear whether he was looking at Li Mo or at Jiang Chulong.

Li Mo patted the little Princess Jiang's head, not caring whether the other's words were a threat or held some other meaning.

He simply said softly:

"She has already repaid her flesh and blood. She owes no one anything."

The figure walking out the door, carrying a divine city on his back, trembled imperceptibly.

...

Main Peak Hall of the Qingyuan Sect.

It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. The elders were still in a state of confusion; there had been too many things happening just now, causing their minds to go blank.

This was not just the Qingyuan Sect.

The confrontation, which seemed to involve a Seventh Realm expert, could be felt by the entire Ziyang Prefecture as a sign that the heavens and earth were about to perish.

"Was that just now... the protector behind His Highness?"

"His Highness not only got into a dispute, but the Supreme Expert behind him actually showed himself?"

"The other party is no simple matter either... from the looks of it, it doesn't seem to be the Demonic Summoning Sect."

"Could it be a successor from a hidden sect and a powerful expert from that sect?"

Some hidden sects have deep backgrounds, making it difficult even for the Heavenly Profound Sect to include them in their records.

It was clear that this matter had already exceeded the control of the Qingyuan Sect.

As they were speaking, a cloud of Qi landed in the Main Peak Hall.

"Li Mo, it's good that you're alright. I was afraid something had happened to you."

Upon seeing Li Mo, Xue Jing's hanging heart finally settled.

"Little Mo, you were at the hot pot restaurant just now?"

Shangguan Wencang asked solemnly:

"What exactly happened just now?"

"I showed off in front of everyone and seemed to have slapped someone in the face a little."

Li Mo thought for a moment and summarized it.

"?"

The elders knew all the characters, but how did they become a sentence they couldn't quite understand?

"Slapped someone? Whose face..."

"Jiang Yu's."

"?????"
