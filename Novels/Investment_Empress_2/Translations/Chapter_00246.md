# Chapter 246: Farewell and a Diary (Part 1)

The next morning at dawn.

Li Mo opened his eyes on the rooftop. He glanced at the empty massage chair beside him but didn't get up. Instead, taking advantage of the tranquility and clarity of mind after observing the Moon, he continued to contemplate the *Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao*.

Once the sun had fully risen, he didn't temper his physique but went to the kitchen instead.

"If only the Seventy-Two Transformations of Earthly Fiends were as simple as body tempering," Little Li muttered as he prepared pork rib soup, separating the Grade 7 exotic beast bones on the chopping block with a single finger.

This particular exotic beast was famous for its tough bones, especially its spine.

"Hmm..."

"I actually thought body tempering was easy because I had sufficient resources."

Li Mo sank his mind into his storage and took stock of his inventory.

Various pills and heavenly treasures were still abundant, but their effects varied. Among them, those beneficial for tempering the body were already scarce, and it would be difficult to replenish them in the short term.

The members of the Clear Abyss Sect were departing for Ziyang Mansion today, so they couldn't provide any feedback for the time being.

Most importantly, the Ice Cube wasn't by his side.

It hurts. It hurts so much.

"So this is what it feels like to live off one's savings," Li Mo sighed bitterly as he looked at the several golden mountains within his System space.

He had no idea how much he would need on the road. It wasn't impossible that he might end up poor, with only money left...

"I must master the Seventy-Two Transformations before going to the Southern Border."

"Otherwise, walking through the Southern Border in a human form is too conspicuous."

"I've more or less grasped the principles of the Seventy-Two Transformations..."

As he pondered, the bone soup simmered with Netherfire emitted a refreshing aroma.

Everyone was very reluctant to part with Li Mo since he wasn't returning to the Clear Abyss Sect with them. They all tearfully ate three big bowls.

"Xiao Mo, the Southern Border is lush with vegetation. I have an illustrated guide to a hundred herbs here. Keep it safe. If you encounter any herbs, you must carefully identify them," Elder Xue said with a complex expression, like a parent watching their child finally set off on a long journey.

"Why are there mushroom types in here..." Li Mo flipped through it casually.

Tang Xiaobao laughed. "Junior Brother, do you know how Master came up with his external alchemy method? That day we drank mushroom soup at the Cauldron Peak, I was in a rush to taste it and brought it out before it was fully cooked."

Li Mo: "..."

Thinking of it that way, the Ice Cube's cooking skills weren't so hard to accept after all.

"A poor home needs a rich traveler. I'll give you some... forget it, you're much richer than this old man," Elder Qian stopped halfway. Being a man of wide experience, he quickly thought of something more valuable to impart.

"I'll teach you a phrase in the demon language. You can use it to greet demonic beasts."

"I'm all ears," Li Mo said, becoming a bit more serious. Knowledge is sometimes the most precious thing. A single phrase could lead to a bloody battle, like 'What are you looking at?' Naturally, a friendly phrase could also resolve a trouble.

Qian Bufan said, "Qiú bā bǐ mǔ niē niú."

"...?" Li Mo couldn't detect any friendly meaning in it. Perhaps because it wasn't human language.

"A demon friend of mine taught me this. You can rest assured."

"Alright," Li Mo noted it in his heart.

Right, why isn't Master saying anything?

Li Mo looked to the side and saw his beautiful master's almond-shaped eyes were red, her red lips pursed. When she saw her precious disciple looking over, she wiped the corner of her eye.

"Master... you're crying?"

"No, I'm not."

Li Mo sighed. His master seemed rough and tumble, but she was still sentimental after all. "It's not a matter of life and death. I won't be gone for long. Master, you need to be strong."

"What will I do without you?" Shang Wu finally couldn't hold it in, looking pitifully vulnerable. "I'll be the only empty-nester beauty left in the Autumn Water Pavilion. I'll have to go around begging for food and drinks, getting disliked, and maybe even beaten up..."

"..."

The crowd instinctively leaned back, sweating profusely.

*Grandma, do you even hear what you're saying?*

Thinking of it that way, they suddenly felt very reluctant to part with Li Mo. With Little Li gone, the fighting king of the Clear Abyss Sect would make a comeback... *Gasp!*

Li Mo: "..."

Ever since his beautiful master failed to break his Vajra Body with a single punch last time—

It seemed she sensed her precious disciple's wings were getting harder and harder to clip, and she might not be able to beat him in the near future. The beautiful master switched strategies and adopted the 'sobbing' tactic...

Li Mo sighed helplessly and took out the majority of the remaining fine wine. "Master, hold on for a bit. I'll be back soon."

Shang Wu's expression cleared up like the clouds parting for the sun. "It's fine even if you take a bit longer."

"Junior Brother, I have some illustrated books here. Take them to read on the road..." Ouyang also offered his gift.

Princess Jiang Chulong was the most reluctant one. She brought two autumn outfits and two winter outfits. Brother Li used his head-patting technique and coaxed her for a long time.

"Next time, I'll call out to the Heavenly尊 in my dreams and apply to visit your cave dwelling. Then we can meet."

"Okay!" Jiang Chulong nodded, biting her lips.

A moment later.

Li Mo stood at the entrance of the tavern, watching the war chariot disappear into the distance, and let out a long breath.

"They're gone. It's good that they're all gone."

"I'm the only one left now..."

Little Li was sighing with emotion when he suddenly felt like he had forgotten something.

A few seconds later, he realized what it was.

Murong Xiao: "..."

Bro, I'm still sitting right here. I've got dust on me, looking just like a real stone statue.

So it wasn't just him who forgot; everyone had forgotten him.

"Oi, he hasn't gotten on the carriage yet!" Little Li chased after them.

...

A moment later, he returned with a helpless expression. Being interrupted like that, the sorrow of parting in his heart had faded a lot.

Cloud-Treading Boots weren't meant for long-distance travel; they were more suitable for flashing and dodging. Chasing the warship was simply out of the question.

"Murong Bro, Murong Bro. Looks like you can only continue your family visit in the Southern Border," Li Mo patted his shoulder.

Murong Xiao had already awakened his bloodline and was now at the Profound Core Realm. His progress was incredibly fast. It might be partly because he was very suitable for Buddhist techniques...

But with that level of strength, going to the Southern Border was still a bit dangerous.

Moreover, Li Mo didn't know if they were even going the same way.

*Plop—*

A booklet suddenly fell from Murong Xiao's embrace.

*Diary.*

"Who in their right mind keeps a diary..."

Little Li didn't have the habit of peeping into others' privacy.

But the Southern Border was vast, and he had no idea where Murong Xiao was headed.

"Murong Bro, if you don't say anything, I'll take that as your consent," Li Mo sought his opinion.

Murong Xiao: "..."

It seemed he had no objections.

So, Little Li opened the diary to the first page:

[I now know where my weakness lies. After challenging it for many days, I can begin preparing to break through to the Profound Core Realm.]

[Brother Li is already a genius on the Hidden Dragon List, while I am still stuck in the Internal Qi Realm. How can I ever repay him in the future?]

[To catch up to Brother Li's back, and to break through to the Profound Core, I will abstain from lust starting today!]

From the lines, it was clear Murong Xiao had made a tremendous resolution!

"Murong Bro, Murong Bro," Li Mo was speechless yet amused, then he turned to the next page.

[Day 1 of abstaining from lust. It feels great.]

He flipped the page again. It still read:

[Day 1 of abstaining from lust. I must hold on this time. It's all Senior Brother Ouyang's fault for having such interesting illustrated books.]

He flipped again...

[Day 1 of abstaining from lust. Succeed or die trying!]

The fourth and fifth pages had the same content.

Li Mo: "..."

Even if it wasn't for breaking through, couldn't Murong Bro take a day off?

Just then, Murong Xiao's eyelids twitched.
