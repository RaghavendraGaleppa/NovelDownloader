# Chapter 63: Ninth-Level Qi Refining Demon Core  

As soon as the voice sounded, Senior Brother Yan, Senior Brother He, and Shen Qingqing immediately fell silent. They all turned to Zhang Jing with looks of astonishment.  

*Does Junior Brother Zhang (Brother Zhang) really have something this valuable?!*  

At that moment, Zhang Jing instinctively glanced at Liu Nanshu, his expression stiff. He had been wondering why this senior sister had suddenly approached them—initially assuming it was related to Senior Brother He—only to realize she was after the Spirit God Liquid in his possession.  

"Senior Sister, how did you know I have Spirit God Liquid?" Zhang Jing asked with a dry laugh.  

"I noticed your transaction with Junior Sister Bai earlier and asked her about it. I hope you don't mind, Junior Brother Zhang," Liu Nanshu explained apologetically.  

"What about that Senior Sister Bai...?"  

"Don’t worry, I’ve already instructed her. She won’t speak of it further."  

Hearing this, Zhang Jing relaxed slightly.  

"I don’t have much Spirit God Liquid left. How much do you need, Senior Sister?" he probed cautiously.  

"Four qian. Do you have that much?"  

As she spoke, Liu Nanshu produced a demon core in her hand. The moment it appeared, an intense surge of demonic energy radiated outward, nearly suffocating Zhang Jing and Shen Qingqing, who stood nearby.  

"I know you’ve been collecting demon cores, Junior Brother Zhang. This ninth-level Qi Refining demon core is extremely rare and valuable—its worth even exceeds that of four qian of Spirit God Liquid."  

"Would you be willing to part with it?" Liu Nanshu asked confidently.  

By now, she had already guessed that this junior brother must possess some method of purifying demon cores. There was no way he would refuse her offer.  

*What profound fortune he must have!* she mused inwardly.  

Before this, purifying the residual malice from demon cores had always been handled by the Thousand Techniques Pavilion. Even as alchemists, outer court disciples like them had never been able to cleanse them completely!  

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing’s mind raced.  

*A ninth-level Qi Refining demon core?!*  

The Thousand Techniques Pavilion’s purchase price for such a core ranged from 900 to 1,100 Dao Merits. But if the residual malice could be purified, its value would skyrocket to 2,000 Dao Merits.  

*This deal is worth it!*  

Suppressing his excitement, Zhang Jing swiftly divided the remaining Spirit God Liquid in his storage space into two portions, placing one into a jade vial. He handed it to Liu Nanshu.  

"Senior Sister, here are four qian of Spirit God Liquid."  

Meanwhile, standing among the crowd in the distance, Senior Brother Gou stared blankly at the scene of Zhang Jing and the others chatting as if it were nothing out of the ordinary. His heart ached with regret.  

Now, he finally understood.  

*That method of purifying demon cores is completely beyond my reach now.*  

The members of the Misty Dawn Team—Liu Nanshu, He Zizai, and Shen Qingqing—along with Senior Brother Yan Guang from the Luodu Team—these were all figures he couldn’t afford to provoke. Yet this junior brother, despite his modest cultivation, conversed with them effortlessly, showing not the slightest hint of timidity.  

His background was clearly extraordinary.  

*Of course—*  

*How could someone who entered this private trade meeting at only the fourth level of Qi Refining be ordinary?*  

*I was completely blinded by greed.*  

As night deepened, the lanterns of the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion gradually dimmed, and the scattered cultivators who had gathered from all directions slowly dispersed.  

At a street corner, Senior Brother Yan bid Zhang Jing farewell.  

"Junior Brother, we’ll part ways here. By the way, I’ve received word that Senior Brother Li should return in seven days."  

"Don’t forget to come by then. Your quota for mid-grade spirit paper still needs to be finalized."  

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother. I’ll definitely be there," Zhang Jing replied politely.  

He had no intention of missing Senior Brother Li’s return. After all, Senior Brother Yan had previously hinted that as a tenth-level Qi Refining cultivator, Senior Brother Li likely possessed high-level demon cores.  

With the remaining Spirit God Liquid in his possession, Zhang Jing had no shortage of bargaining chips.  

---  

In the second floor of a talisman shop, Zhang Jing, for once, wasn’t cultivating or crafting talismans. Instead, he was quietly taking stock of his recent gains.  

He currently had nearly 200 low-grade talismans and 18 mid-grade talismans, with a total value exceeding 400 Dao Merits.  

Eighty-seven demon cores from early Qi Refining stages, once purified, were worth around 2,000 Dao Merits.  

There was also the fifth-level Qi Refining demon core from the demonic tiger, valued at 100 Dao Merits.  

And, of course, the ninth-level Qi Refining demon core he had just obtained from Senior Sister Liu.  

This single core alone, once purified, would be worth a staggering 2,000 Dao Merits.  

Combined with the few hundred Dao Merits he still had, his total assets exceeded 5,000 Dao Merits!  

Factoring in the spiritual herbs from the medicinal garden, his net worth was at least 8,000 Dao Merits.  

At this realization, Zhang Jing couldn’t help but feel a surge of awe.  

The remaining Dao Merits he needed could be earned by mass-producing low-grade talismans for just eight or nine days!  

And if he could trade Spirit God Liquid with Senior Brother Li for another ninth-level demon core, he might not even need those extra days.  

*I could return and exchange for the high-grade inheritance immediately!*  

"A goal that once seemed so distant is now almost within reach... and it’s only taken less than two months!"  

Zhang Jing’s face was a picture of disbelief.  

He took a deep breath.  

The jade talisman before him shimmered, its surface displaying a cascade of skills and their corresponding experience values—each a testament to his relentless efforts over this period.  

*Such remarkable achievements are primarily due to my tireless day-and-night dedication!*  

He made a mental note of his progress.  

"Of course, the jade talisman deserves just as much credit," Zhang Jing added inwardly.  

---  

The days passed uneventfully.  

Six or seven days slipped by.  

During this time, the hopeful senior brother who had previously visited Zhang Jing’s shop returned.  

This time, he successfully traded a sixth-level Qi Refining demon core for four mid-grade defensive talismans (Gravity Star Talismans) and four mid-grade offensive talismans (Yin Shade Talismans).  

The day after his visit, Pei Xiaoshuang arrived as promised.  

Zhang Jing gave her a specially marked communication talisman, instructing her to keep it safe.  

They agreed that once the talisman activated, Pei Xiaoshuang—or her descendants—would immediately set out for Longze Market to await further instructions.  

Clutching the talisman tightly, Pei Xiaoshuang left the market in high spirits, her destination unknown.  

Despite the uncertainty of whether this promise would ever be fulfilled, she clung to hope with unwavering faith in this Daoist cultivator.  

*If I can just enter the Daoist academy, I can change my family’s destiny. Even if I have to wait ten, twenty, or thirty years—so be it.*  

Additionally, Senior Brother Ding visited Zhang Jing once with Junior Sister Tong, Senior Brother Xia, and Senior Brother Zhou.  

Their purpose was twofold: to purchase talismans and to "strengthen their bond"—a phrase Zhang Jing found both amusing and touching when he heard it from Junior Sister Tong.  

He was deeply grateful to them.  

Had they not ventured into Black Mountain County to slay demons, and had Senior Brother Ding not given him the entire haul, where would he have obtained the Spirit God Liquid?  

In the end, at their insistence, Zhang Jing sold them four mid-grade talismans at a 20% discount and nearly thirty low-grade talismans at a 30% discount.  

Any further repayment would have to wait.  

One evening, Zhang Jing sat at the shop entrance, gazing intently at the sunset.  

Over the past six or seven days, the number of demon cores he received had steadily declined, averaging only six or seven per day—mostly from first or second-level Qi Refining demons, with third-level cores becoming increasingly rare.  

*It seems the Langya demon uprising is nearing its end.*  

Suddenly, as if struck by a thought, he stood up.  

Calculating the time, Senior Brother Li should have returned last night. It was time to pay him a visit.  

*Surely he has high-level demon cores in his possession?*  

*And while I’m at it, I should check out his mid-grade magical artifacts—maybe I can complete the remaining four pieces of the Five Treasures Spirit River set in one go.*  

With a creak, Zhang Jing closed the shop door and disappeared into the bustling crowd.
