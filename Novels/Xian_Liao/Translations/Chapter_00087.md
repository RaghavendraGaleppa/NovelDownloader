# Chapter 87: I Am the Greater Picture

In Jiangzhou's medicinal garden, Zhou Qing and Fushan had been analyzing the properties of the herbs brought back from the Tiger Venerable Mingwang Temple. Among them was a peculiar blood-red snow ginseng.

Based on their assessment, this ginseng had likely been cultivated using flesh and blood, carrying an inherent demonic nature. Zhou Qing suspected that the Living Buddha might have intended to nurture this ginseng into a demonic entity using esoteric Tantric methods.

The blood ginseng contained abundant spiritual energy, surpassing even the seven-leaf ginseng from years past. More critically, it appeared to be an embryonic demonic entity.

Since resolving the Blood Vine incident in Hushan Prefecture, Zhou Qing had deliberately avoided widely publicizing the fact that demonic entities like the blood vine could grow stronger by consuming flesh and blood. His concern was that some deranged individuals might exploit this trait to cultivate and control immensely powerful demonic beings. Moreover, these entities seemed to be wood-attribute in nature, a theory reinforced by the existence of the blood ginseng.

The demonic nature of the blood ginseng was already quite potent. The primary challenge in refining it into elixirs would be suppressing the violent demonic energy it produced, though its efficacy promised to be remarkable.

After deliberation, Zhou Qing and Fushan decided to use the blood ginseng as the main ingredient for the inferior Qi Condensation Pills. Originally, these pills used the Vermilion Fruit as the primary component, supplemented by snow ginseng. Now, without the Vermilion Fruit, the blood ginseng—far superior to the previous snow ginseng—would serve as the main ingredient. By adjusting the formula proportions, they could still achieve effects similar to the Qi Condensation Pills. Given the blood ginseng's emphasis on qi and blood, the elixir would likely enhance these aspects more prominently, though its effect on refining true qi would remain substantial.

With their prior experience in refining the inferior Qi Condensation Pills, Zhou Qing and Fushan had a deeper understanding of the elixir's formula. Alchemy ultimately followed pharmacological principles, and both were masters in this field. Their previous experience allowed them to accurately predict the properties and demonic nature of the inferior Qi Condensation Pills made with blood ginseng.

Zhou Qing and Fushan also studied the blood crystal and the remnants of the blood vine. The vine's remains had long since withered in the jade box, yet traces of demonic energy still lingered. While the remnants could no longer absorb flesh and blood to grow, placing them near the blood crystal caused signs of revival. However, the blood crystal alone couldn't absorb flesh and blood.

Zhou Qing named the blood crystal the "Demonic Blood Core." Most of its qi and blood energy had already been absorbed by Zhou Qing's true qi, enhancing his physical cultivation. Additionally, combining the blood core with the blood vine to absorb flesh and blood only revived the vine without increasing the core's energy—instead, it led to some loss.

He experimented by feeding a small piece of the blood vine to the Great Mulberry Tree. The tree absorbed it swiftly, turning the vine to ash instantly, but the absorption caused the tree to become noticeably more violent. Zhou Qing then used his own yang qi to neutralize the tree's yin energy, gradually calming it.

He refrained from further experiments, wary of inadvertently introducing uncontrollable demonic influences to the tree. This incident served as a reminder: wood-attribute spirits that absorbed parts of wood-attribute demons risked demonic transformation. The Great Pine Tree of Taihe Mountain had previously absorbed a branch from the Great Mulberry Tree. Zhou Qing recalled that at the time, he hadn't yet used the mulberry tree's yin energy to balance his yang qi, meaning the tree had already been trending toward demonization. Later, Zhang Jingxiu advised him to cultivate in a pure yin environment to achieve balance. By seeking out the Great Mulberry Tree, Zhou Qing had unintentionally halted its demonization.

This also demonstrated that Zhou Qing's yang qi could prevent the Great Mulberry Tree from demonizing. However, Zhang Jingxiu couldn't perform the same for the Great Pine Tree, as the pine tree rejected his yang qi—its introduction was like adding sparks to oil. When Zhou Qing had previously tested his own qi on the pine tree, there was no rejection, but the tree's yin energy carried too much killing intent, making it useless for his cultivation. Moreover, the Great Pine Tree seemed to fear Zhou Qing, leading him to suspect it bore the Great Mulberry Tree's mark—almost like a subordinate. Had he unwittingly planted a spy in Taihe Mountain?

Regardless, Zhou Qing decided to monitor the demonic situation closely. He pondered the matter, sensing a looming threat. While provinces like Tiannan and Xijiang in the south were under his and Taihe Sect's influence, the northern provinces resembled hell on earth, with little news reaching the south. It was possible that certain cities had already cultivated formidable demons. Worse, had the imperial family discovered this secret? With the old eunuch's presence, it wasn't far-fetched to imagine the imperial family attempting to nurture a powerful demon. After all, the north was in chaos, the Grand Canal was severed, and the capital's million-strong population faced starvation...

Zhou Qing knew all too well that the imperial family, citing the "greater picture," might resort to such measures. He hoped they remained ignorant or lacked the ruthlessness to act. Still, he prepared for the worst.

"Regardless, once this batch of elixirs is successfully refined, and after Elder Zhang and my two senior brothers and I consume them to enhance our strength, it will be time to head to the capital."

After his trip to the Snowy Peaks with Zhang Jingxiu, Zhou Qing realized that even the Living Buddha hadn't reached the Innate Realm. With spiritual energy only beginning to recover, any future Innate cultivators would belong to the next generation. For the current generation, achieving the Innate Realm without assistance—like Zhou Qing and Fushan—was nearly impossible unless one could endure heavenly tribulation alone.

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "Without knowing the actual circumstances, I won't comment. Your words don't intimidate me."

"His Majesty's intention is to grant you Jiangzhou as your fief and Taihe Mountain as your daoist sanctuary. If you can quell Prince Qinghe's rebellion, you'll be enfeoffed as a prince," the Third Prince said.

"And if I refuse?"

The Third Prince pressed, "Do you know how many people are displaced in this chaos? 'Better a dog in peace than a man in war.' Do you think letting the realm descend into turmoil benefits anyone? As a scholar, shouldn't you prioritize the greater picture and join forces with the Grand Ancestor to restore order?"

"The greater picture?" Zhou Qing chuckled softly. This wasn't the first time he'd heard this term.

"I've read your essays. I don't believe you're indifferent to the suffering of the people. The stability of the realm now hinges on your choice."

"It seems I must clarify something."

"What?"

"I am the greater picture."

---

"Which Elder Lu?"

"Lu Fengxian."

The Jiangzhou garrison commander found the name vaguely familiar before realizing it referred to the former Education Commissioner. He hesitated briefly but quickly made his decision.

The Third Prince had expected Jiangzhou's gates to open in welcome upon his arrival with Lu Fengxian. Instead, he found himself surrounded by soldiers and crossbows. He immediately ordered his guards to surrender.

Bound and brought into the city, the Third Prince was imprisoned, while Lu Fengxian was treated with courtesy. The garrison commander's aide voiced concerns: "My lord, without consulting our master, isn't arresting the Third Prince—or this impostor—risky?"

The commander retorted, "Consult how? If our master later wishes to release him, we'll take the blame. If he wants him dead, it's our doing without his knowledge. Should our master bow to a prince?" 

Having killed the Tiannan commander Gu Fan under Zhou Qing's guidance, confessed to the crime, and assaulted Prefect Ling, the commander was fully committed to Zhou Qing's cause. With Zhou Qing now an Innate master, loyalty was non-negotiable. Thus, the commander acted in Zhou Qing's interest—whether the prince was real or fake, he was fake here. The final decision rested with Zhou Qing, but the commander would handle the dirty work.

Had Lu Fengxian not been present, the commander would have executed the prince outright. After all, Prince Qinghe's daughter was Zhou Qing's disciple—a clear hostage. With Prince Qinghe in rebellion, Zhou Qing wouldn't submit to imperial orders. Since Zhou Qing hadn't openly rebelled, executing a prince would be unseemly if done directly. Subordinates had to shoulder such tasks.

Having just finished refining the first batch of elixirs, Zhou Qing received word of Lu Fengxian's return and went to meet him without resting.

"You... how have you been?" Lu Fengxian asked nervously. The youth he'd once known now ruled a territory and wielded unparalleled martial prowess as an Innate master. Having witnessed the old eunuch's power in the capital, he understood the terror of an Innate.

"Elder, there's no need for formalities. I've never forgotten your guidance in my youth. Though north and south were severed, I sent men to find you repeatedly, to no avail. Seeing you safe relieves me."

"Your remembrance honors me. Do you have a courtesy name now?"

"Having entered the dao, I've added 'zhi' to my name. You may call me Qingzhi, as if it were my courtesy name," Zhou Qing replied warmly.

"Qingzhi, I come bearing His Majesty's decree: you are named Dragon-Tiger Mystical Purity True Man, granted Taihe Mountain as your sanctuary, and enfeoffed as Marquis of Heavenly Mandate with Jiangzhou as your domain," Lu Fengxian said anxiously.

Zhou Qing responded, "Elder, to others, I'd have a prepared answer. But your presence here seems unwilling—are your family members threatened?"

Lu Fengxian sighed. "Since you ask, I'll speak plainly. During the capital's upheaval, my family fled but were stranded north. When order was restored, the Imperial Secret Police found us. Now, we're under His Majesty's control."

Zhou Qing pondered. "Jiangzhou is your home. I'll restore your former residence for your stay. As for your family, I'll arrange their rescue."

Lu Fengxian said gratefully, "My family is but one surviving son. I beg you, for our past bond, preserve this last heir."

Zhou Qing nodded. "It will be done. Rest now—you've journeyed far." He instructed Lin Wan'er to settle Lu Fengxian before visiting the imprisoned Third Prince.

"Who are you?" the disheveled prince asked, humiliated before the young man who clearly held power in Jiangzhou.

"Zhou Qing."

"So you're Zhou Qing?" The prince marveled at his youthful appearance. "You must have reached the Innate Realm long ago, rejuvenating yourself. Did you sit for the exams merely to amuse yourself?"

"Does the old eunuch in the palace appear equally young?"

"Since my birth, the Grand Ancestor has had white hair and brows, but his complexion resembles a man in his twenties. He claims keeping white hair avoids wasting qi and blood."

"An Innate master can direct qi to the hair, turning it black at will. It's no great feat," Zhou Qing remarked.

"The Grand Ancestor said the same, but restraint defines a cultivator. Once, he killed a grassland warrior with a drop of water—a divine act. Even as an Innate, could you match that?"

Zhou Qing smiled. "Without witnessing it, I won't judge. Your words don't frighten me."

"His Majesty offers you Jiangzhou, Taihe Mountain, and a princedom if you suppress Prince Qinghe's rebellion."

"And if I refuse?"

The prince appealed, "Countless suffer in this chaos. 'Better a dog in peace than a man in war.' As a scholar, shouldn't you uphold the greater picture by aiding the Grand Ancestor?"

"The greater picture?" Zhou Qing laughed lightly. "I've heard that before."

"Your writings show you care for the people. The realm's fate rests on your choice."

"Then let me tell you something."

"What?"

"I am the greater picture."
