# Chapter 159: You've Said Everything That Needs to Be Said

“Duo!”

A thunderous roar erupted from Xu Yunfan’s throat, his muscles and sinews tensing and releasing like a drawn bowstring.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer flew from his grasp, the chain coiling around his wrist in a spiral.

Su Zhenhe raised his fan to block the center, but he saw the hammerhead turn sharply at the end of the chain, drawing a bizarre arc that bypassed the fan surface. The chain and hammer hooked perfectly around his jade belt.

“Up!”

With the fierce shout, Su Zhenhe was swung into the air.

Xu Yunfan shattered three blue bricks underfoot, and the heavy hammer fell like a meteorite. However, it froze completely just before touching Su Zhenhe’s hair crown.

The force of the hammer wind caused Su Zhenhe’s jade hair crown to crack with a *pop*, his long black hair scattering over his shoulders.

“I acknowledge your skill,” Xu Yunfan said.

Xu Yunfan retracted the hammer and stepped back. The chain coiled back, and with a *clack*, it transformed back into a single long-handled heavy hammer.

Su Zhenhe stared at the jade crown shattered into eight pieces on the ground, then suddenly let out a light laugh.

He raised his head to look at Xu Yunfan, his expression calm. “Brother Xu, I have one more move. I wonder if you can take it?”

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. “It’s not some life-exchanging technique that brings heaven and earth down with you, is it?”

He spoke earnestly, “Brother Su, let’s not damage our friendship. We aren't fighting to the death, and we haven't even used our killing moves. Why damage our bodies over a moment of pride? Let’s call this win yours, alright? If that doesn't work, we can compare poetry. I have plenty stored in my mind that would surprise you greatly.”

Su Zhenhe: “……”

You’ve said everything that needs to be said; what is there left for me to say?

Hong Baichuan walked out at the right moment, smiling broadly. “The sparring is sufficient for now. If we continue, things might get serious, and it will be hard to stop.”

Daoist Guanshan snorted coldly, too lazy to pay attention to Hong Baichuan, who was counting his blessings.

“Zhenhe, I will let you use your sword next time. This Junior Brother Xu is also at the Third Refining perfection, possessing a body of iron and steel, and is especially gifted with terrifying strength. It is not your fault this time.”

Upon hearing this, Su Zhenhe’s spirits lifted, and he bowed to Daoist Guanshan. “Thank you, Master!”

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise his eyebrow but said nothing more.

He still had a gilded mace he hadn't used yet; he had nothing to complain about.

Daoist Guanhe walked out from the seats with a strange smile, looking at the ginkgo tree that had been pulled apart by Xu Yunfan.

“Brother Hong, do you know who planted this ginkgo tree?”

Hong Baichuan, flushed with having gained face, replied casually, “Who? I’ll compensate them.”

“Ye Linyun, Junior Sister Ye.”

Hong Baichuan’s expression froze instantly. After a hollow laugh, he immediately took his leave, seemingly unwilling to stay a moment longer, pulling Xu Yunfan as he hurried down the mountain.

Watching Hong Baichuan leave, Daoist Guanshan shook his head slightly.

Daoist Guanhe watched with a smile, then sighed. “If Hong Baichuan hadn't been injured forty years ago, he would at least have the cultivation of organ refinement by now. What a pity…”

Daoist Guanshan pondered for a moment and said, “The Tiangong Cave is a major sect of weapon forging. Now that they are relocating to the Ghost Weeping Abyss in Shu Province, we must show some support. We should send an elder down the mountain to escort them part of the way, to show our stance to the world.”

“What about the Nine曜 Sect?”

Daoist Guanshan showed a look of disdain. “If that old bastard dares to extend his claws so far, I will personally sever them.”

A major weapon forging sect coming to pay respects and join, and clarifying the annual tribute during the banquet—emotionally and rationally, the Xuanzhen Sect would have to offer some strength. This meant a stable source of treasure-grade artifacts.

There are very few sects in the world capable of forging treasure-grade artifacts, let alone the fact that the Tiangong Cave contains people from the former Divine Weapon Ridge.

Divine Weapon Ridge... that is where Divine Weapons were born.

There is an affair here!

Watching Hong Baichuan drag him down the mountain without a word, Xu Yunfan tried to ask several times, but was forced to close his mouth by Hong Baichuan’s sharp gaze.

Forget it, better not touch the tiger’s whisker. If he hit a sore spot, even if Xu Yunfan was a peerless genius and the treasure of the Tiangong Cave, he would definitely receive a beating.

The trip to the Xuanzhen Sect was a true acknowledgment of their status.

When the major martial circles of Lingnan Province learned that the Tiangong Cave was coming to settle in Lingnan, and that the top sect dominating Lingnan, the Blue Mountain Xuanzhen Sect, had specifically sent an elder to escort them, the thoughts of many martial sects were extinguished.

On the way back to the Tiangong Fortress, Xu Yunfan and Hong Baichuan were accompanied by a red-faced, bearded old Daoist.

Daoist Guanming, the head of the Purple Lang Peak—one of the nineteen peaks and the Purple Lang Temple. A marrow-washing master.

“Ah, why be so formal? Just call me by my secular name, Xiong Kun.”

Xiong Kun tried his best to squeeze out a smile and moved closer to Hong Baichuan.

Hong Baichuan leaned back slightly.

“Brother Xiong, just say what you have to say. There’s no need for this!”

Xiong Kun’s old face turned red. He had been a sect head for too long, holding high status for so long that he had forgotten how to force a flattering smile.

“Brother Hong, to be honest, three years ago, my great spear was accidentally destroyed, and I haven't found a suitable weapon since. Now that your Tiangong Cave is moving here, it truly relieves my urgent need!”

Xiong Kun was somewhat helpless. “I went to explore an ancient site that day but got caught in a conflict. The spear in my hand was shattered by someone, and it has been a headache ever since.”

Hong Baichuan’s expression softened slightly.

“I remember the Xuanzhen Sect has its own weapon forging department. Why didn't you go ask them to forge one?”

Xiong Kun slapped his thigh.

“Don’t even mention those cursed bastards! The Skyfire Iron I worked so hard to find—a material capable of forging Divine Weapons—was turned by them into a piece of scrap iron. They even said the iron was too hard to melt... If it weren't for the rule against killing within the sect, I would have severed their tendons and chopped off their ‘second brothers’ to let them feel what it means to be ‘hard’!”

Hong Baichuan: “……”

Xu Yunfan: “……”

He knew that as a weapon forging sect, the Tiangong Cave was in high demand, but he never thought it would be this high.

A marrow-washing master from a top sect was openly flattering them, hoping they could forge a weapon for him.

The weapons forged by the Tiangong Cave were naturally coveted by all.

Top sects indeed dabble in everything, but they are naturally a step behind sects like the Tiangong Cave that specialize in a particular craft.

***

In the restricted land of Shu Province, on the edge of the Ghost Weeping Abyss, the morning mist had not yet dispersed. Thirteen giant mechanical kites circled above the Tiangong Fortress.

The iron wings supported by the steel skeleton were the size of a war chariot, and the compressed air sacs at the wing roots emitted white mist every ten breaths.

This was a warning device newly modified by Mohuan and Mo Shisan. Within a radius of thirty miles, not even the flapping of a sparrow's wings could escape the surveillance of the玄晶 (mystic crystal) lens in the kite's belly.

“The Blood Flag Alliance’s scouts have withdrawn.”

Mo Shisan retracted his gaze from the observation hole, unable to hide the exhaustion in his eyes. “At the hour of Zi last night, they drove seventeen climbing nails into the cliff wall on the west side of the Ghost Weeping Abyss. If Hall Master Zhan hadn't stepped in, a fight was inevitable.”

As he spoke, a muffled thunder suddenly sounded from the end of the mountain path.

Sixteen black warhorses trampled the morning frost. The leading elder wore a peacock feather cape, and the great sword at his waist flickered with cold light as it rose and fell with the horse's movement. It was Hu Zhenyue, the third elder of the Hu family.

But the horse team reined in two miles outside the Tiangong Fortress. On the blue stone road ahead, three iron swords with black ribbons tied to their hilts were blocking the way.
