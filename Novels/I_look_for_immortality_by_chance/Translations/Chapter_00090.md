# Chapter 90: Slaying "Gu Yuan" and Reaching the Summit!

"Drip! Drip!"

The sound of dripping water echoed in his ears. Gu Yuan raised his head and realized the scenery before him had transformed into a damp cave without him noticing.

The cave was humid, its walls covered in green moss. Droplets of water fell from the ceiling, creating an eerie resonance. At the far end stood a tightly sealed stone door, as if guarding some hidden secret. Before the door sat a figure cloaked in black, wearing a bamboo hat, silently meditating as though standing guard.

Sensing Gu Yuan's arrival, the figure suddenly lifted its head and locked eyes with him.

"Clang!"

A golden sword seemed to slice through the void, accompanied by a terrifying screech that sent shivers down one's spine.

Top-tier spiritual sense!

The terrifying sound reverberated, shaking the mind. The slightest lapse in concentration would result in one's spiritual sense being shattered instantly, struck as if by lightning, leaving them defenseless.

Gu Yuan had fought many battles, emerging victorious each time, largely due to his exceptional spiritual sense. At critical moments, the roar of his silver dragon spiritual sense could turn the tide, serving as his trump card.

Yet today, within this grand formation, he encountered another top-tier spiritual sense.

The golden sword's screech filled Gu Yuan with unease, but there was no time to ponder.

"Roar!"

A silver-scaled dragon surged forth, its claws bared, instantly clashing with the golden sword in midair.

"Clang! Clang!"

The golden sword was sharp, slicing through the dragon's scales, but the dragon fought back fiercely, tearing at the sword's radiance.

Their battle in the unseen realm was brutal.

But Gu Yuan's gaze had already shifted from the battle to the cloaked figure before him.

His Zhaotian Spirit Eyes pierced through the black robe, revealing the figure's true form—greenish skin, sharp nails, and faint wisps of dark energy. This was no living person, but a corpse puppet.

Yet the eyes beneath the hat were not lifeless; they were cold and deep, as if retaining intelligence.

"This battle scenario within the formation is truly bizarre..."

Before Gu Yuan could ponder further, the corpse puppet attacked again.

"Shing!"

A golden light, swift as lightning, slashed through the air toward him.

---

The golden light was sharp and unstoppable, tearing through even Gu Yuan's Cloudwalk Seal.

As the light nearly breached the mist, the Minor Titan Seal in Gu Yuan's dantian suddenly flared.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

An overwhelming surge of power amplified the Cloudwalk Seal.

For the first time, Gu Yuan fully activated the Minor Titan Seal.

This seal could greatly enhance mana, physique, and spiritual sense, amplifying all techniques. The weak could become strong, the strong could become peerless, and the elite could reach the pinnacle.

Previously, Gu Yuan had only used it sparingly. But now, he channeled all his mana into the seal.

His muscles bulged, and the previously torn mist suddenly thickened, as if a hole had opened in the sky, unleashing a torrential downpour.

The silver dragon battling the golden sword also grew larger, its form more ferocious.

"Roar!"

With a triumphant roar, it crushed the already dimming golden sword.

"Thud!"

As the sword shattered, the corpse puppet froze as if struck by lightning, and the golden light assaulting the mist faltered.

In that brief moment, the battle was decided.

Gu Yuan activated his enhanced Peach Blossom Sword Seal, slicing the corpse puppet to pieces.

Yet, after the victory, the cave remained, and Gu Yuan did not return to the starry steps.

After a moment's hesitation, he stepped forward and pushed open the stone door.

---

Outside, the crowd watched the last two silver steps intently.

All other steps had faded, leaving only these two glowing brilliantly, each bearing a motionless figure.

"Senior Brothers Jin and Tao both lost?!"

"What kind of trial is this?"

"Even Senior Luo from the Enforcement Hall was defeated? Unbelievable!"

"Now only these two common-born cultivators remain? Have the noble and master-disciple factions truly lost?"

"Does this mean the academy will now be dominated by commoners?"

"Nonsense! Today's defeat only reflects our own shortcomings, not the factions'. These two must be the best among commoners, while we are neither core disciples of the Golden Core masters nor the seven peaks' elites. How can we represent our factions?"

"True, but it still stings..."

"Don't despair. Foundation Building is just the beginning. We still have chances..."

The crowd murmured as they observed Gu Yuan and the white-templed Senior Zhang.

Bian Chuyao also gazed thoughtfully at the two.

---

Unaware of the discussions outside, Gu Yuan pushed open the door and found himself in a vast, new world—a lush valley teeming with exotic flora and fauna, like a paradise.

Yet everything seemed distant, separated by an intangible barrier, blurry as if seen through mist.

The only clear figure was a man sitting at the valley's edge, dressed in flowing robes, tall and handsome, exuding an air of confidence.

Gu Yuan froze.

The man looked exactly like him.

"Who dares impersonate me?" the figure demanded coldly.

His voice was identical to Gu Yuan's.

"Die!"

Without waiting for a reply, the figure waved his sleeve, unleashing a torrent of mist and rain toward Gu Yuan.

Sword energy flickered like peach blossoms within the mist, and a silver dragon roared forth to assault Gu Yuan's mind.

Gu Yuan countered with identical techniques.

Mist clashed with mist, swords with swords, dragons with dragons—a perfect mirror.

"Audacious impostor! You've stolen my techniques!"

"Take this!"

The figure roared, summoning two more seals—the Minor Titan Seal and the Secret Arrow Seal.

"He even has these... So this formation replicates all my abilities?"

Gu Yuan mused before activating his own seals, along with the Azure Lotus Seal, Windrush Seal, and Flame Dragon Seal.

Yet the figure mirrored him flawlessly, their power evenly matched.

The stalemate dragged on.

"Interesting..."

"It seems conventional means won't break this deadlock..."

After a prolonged battle, Gu Yuan grasped the trial's nature.

With a faint smile, he strode through the mist and sword energy, his muscles bulging with enhanced strength, and struck at the figure's head.

"You've even copied my physical enhancement? But I won't lose to you!"

The figure sneered, raising a hand to meet Gu Yuan's.

"Crash!"

The moment their palms collided, the figure's expression twisted in horror.

Gu Yuan's strike carried the force of ten thousand pounds, augmented by chilling cold energy.

The figure's hand shattered instantly, and the blow continued unimpeded, crushing its skull.

Watching his own likeness perish, Gu Yuan sighed.

The formation could replicate techniques, but not the Star Spirit.

The Star Spirit was a natural marvel, its divine essence impossible to mimic.

But... had he revealed too much?

Was the Bian family truly only selecting talents and gifting spirit herbs?

As Gu Yuan pondered, the illusion shattered, and he found himself back in the jade hall.

Now, only his silver step remained, glowing brilliantly at the summit.

He stood atop the celestial stairs, gazing down at the crowd below.
