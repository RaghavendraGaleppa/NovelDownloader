# Chapter 17: Three Spells to Repel the Enemy (Seeking Follow-up Reads)

Watching three arm-thick water arrows of magical power shoot toward him at incredible speed, the Qi Refinement third layer bandit's expression changed dramatically.

Judging by the appearance and energy fluctuations of these water arrows, they were at least at the Minor Achievement level or above! Moreover, when the opponent cast the spell, he faintly sensed the spiritual pressure emanating from their magical power.

"How is this possible?! Qi Refinement third layer! Water Arrow Technique at Minor Achievement level!"

"Not only that, but this Water Arrow Technique isn't just any Minor Achievement level—it must have been cultivated at that level for quite some time!"

"The opponent looks to be only about twelve years old. How did they achieve this?"

The bandit was utterly shocked and found it hard to believe. He knew that while he had also mastered the Fireball Technique at the Minor Achievement level, he was much older and had spent years of effort to reach that stage. But this opponent?

Despite his astonishment, his reaction was swift. He immediately took out a bronze shield the size of a fist. Under the infusion of his magical power, it quickly expanded to the size of a basin, its surface glowing brightly, giving off an indestructible aura.

This bronze shield was a defensive low-grade magical artifact. Though only a low-grade artifact, defensive artifacts were rarer and more valuable than offensive ones. Moreover, this bronze shield's defensive capabilities were among the top tier for low-grade artifacts, just below mid-grade ones. Once activated, it could block ordinary spells.

Boom!

Just as the bronze shield was raised, the first water arrow collided with the half-fist-sized crimson fireball he had unleashed. Upon impact, a shockwave spread out, and after holding for only a few moments, the fireball dissipated. Though the first water arrow didn't vanish, its size was significantly reduced. It then struck the bronze shield, causing a violent tremor before disappearing.

But the bandit didn't relax, as two more water arrows were coming.

The second and third Minor Achievement-level water arrows struck the bronze shield in succession. After the second hit, a fine crack appeared on the shield. When the third arrow landed, cracks spread across the entire shield before it shattered with a loud boom.

The bandit's hand was bloodied, and his face paled as he hastily retreated. As he fled, he pulled out a talisman, which ignited and transformed into a gust of wind that wrapped around him.

This was a top-grade first-tier Wind Sprint Talisman. Though it had no offensive power, it was highly effective for escape—even a Qi Refinement mid-stage cultivator would struggle to catch up. He had obtained it by chance and had kept it as a last resort. Now, he was using it against a mere Qi Refinement third layer opponent who looked to be only twelve years old!

Watching the fleeing bandit, Qi Chuan sighed inwardly in regret. After unleashing three full-power attacks in quick succession, his burden was heavy, and his magical power was depleted. Without any means to pursue, he could only let the bandit escape.

His gaze then turned to the other battlefields.

Not far away, a thirteen-year-old youth was defending himself with a mid-grade defensive artifact, focusing solely on defense and leaving a Qi Refinement third layer bandit helpless. Further away, another Qi Refinement third layer cultivator from the Qi family, around thirty years old, was engaged in a fierce battle with a peak Qi Refinement third layer bandit and was already injured, teetering on the brink of defeat.

Most critically, at the center of the caravan, the Qi family's Qi Refinement sixth layer cultivator was barely holding his own against a Qi Refinement sixth layer bandit and a Qi Refinement fifth layer bandit. The situation was precarious, and he risked imminent death.

"If this continues, things will take a turn for the worse," Qi Chuan thought to himself.

At this point, the best he could do was assist in the Qi Refinement third layer battles. But even if he helped eliminate those two bandits, it wouldn't change the outcome of the Qi Refinement sixth layer fight. If their side's sixth layer cultivator fell, the situation would collapse regardless.

Should they flee?

"Hmph! A few fleas dare to provoke a tiger?"

Just then, from the center of the caravan, the square waterproof covering of a large carriage exploded, and an elderly woman burst forth. With a flick of her withered hand, a sharp blade light shot out, carrying a faint blade shadow as it streaked through the air, slicing through the neck of the Qi Refinement sixth layer bandit.

"Qi Refinement... late stage..." the bandit muttered with difficulty, his hand touching his neck where a thin line of blood seeped out. The next moment, his arm fell limp, and without support, his head toppled to the ground. His headless corpse collapsed, blood spraying everywhere.

The remaining Qi Refinement fifth layer bandit was horrified. He slapped a talisman onto his body and fled, but the sharp blade light quickly caught up and killed him.

As for the last two Qi Refinement third layer bandits, their deaths were even swifter and more straightforward, hardly worth mentioning.

Near Qi Chuan, Qi Feng watched the fallen bandit with a pale face, exhaling in relief as he retrieved his mid-grade defensive artifact. His heart still pounded with lingering fear.

Though his mid-grade artifact had excellent defensive capabilities, its magical power consumption was terrifying. As a Qi Refinement third layer cultivator, he could barely sustain it. While he had emerged unscathed from the bandit's attacks, he knew that if the fight had dragged on longer and his magical power had depleted, he would have been the one to die.

"Thank goodness... Third Grandmother arrived in time..." Qi Feng muttered to himself, his eyes scanning the surroundings in shock.

To his surprise, none of the Qi family cultivators had died. Even the thirty-something Qi Refinement third layer cultivator, though heavily injured and unconscious, was not in mortal danger.

What truly astonished him was Qi Chuan, who stood nearby with an unruffled expression.

"Wasn't this guy only Qi Refinement second layer? How is he so calm? There's no blood on him, no signs of struggle. Did no bandit attack him?" Qi Feng stared at Qi Chuan, his eyes filled with disbelief.

During the battle, he had been too focused on his own fight to pay attention to the others. But now, even with his mid-grade artifact, he was still shaken, his magical power mostly drained. Meanwhile, this seemingly twelve-year-old Qi Refinement second layer cultivator appeared completely unfazed, as if nothing had happened.

"This guy must have been incredibly lucky. Maybe because he was too weak to affect the battle, the bandits ignored him," Qi Feng thought.

In the distance, the Qi family's Qi Refinement sixth layer cultivator surveyed the caravan and frowned. "One got away."

He remembered there had been five bandits, but only four corpses remained—meaning a Qi Refinement third layer bandit had escaped. Earlier, while being besieged by a Qi Refinement sixth layer and fifth layer, he hadn't been able to monitor the other battles.

Only the Qi Refinement eighth layer elderly woman, after retrieving her top-grade flying blade artifact, cast a glance toward Qi Chuan, her murky eyes revealing a hint of surprise. She must have noticed his earlier performance.

"Twelve years old, Qi Refinement third layer, Minor Achievement Water Arrow Technique?"

"Where did this dark horse come from?"

"It seems the inner sect quota might face some competition... though only a sliver of a chance, given Qi Chan'er..."

Her mind buzzed with thoughts.

However, as a Qi Refinement late-stage elder of the Qi family with one foot in the grave, she didn't voice her observations. She merely offered Qi Chuan a faint smile and a slight nod from afar.
