# Chapter 180: A Sign of Turning Bad Luck into Good, or a Collapse of One's Persona?

High on the platform, the elders’ expressions varied as they heard the words ‘Sword Pill.’

Although none of the elders present possessed a Sword Pill, they were no strangers to the item.

It could be sharp enough to cut through iron as if it were mud, or soft enough to wrap around a finger like a ring.

In Sword City, there was once a prodigy with exceptional talent but terrible luck. Due to various accidents, he languished in the Internal Qi Realm for decades, having to disperse his cultivation and start over seven times.

For decades, he never stopped comprehending the Sword Dao. The last time he observed the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark, he transformed his Profound Core into a Sword Pill. Then, using the Sword Mark as his Divine Intent, he broke through the Grand View Realm with extreme form and directly entered the Inner Scene.

That prodigy was named Wan Wuchang, the previous Lord of Horizontal Cloud Sword City and the Sword Dao enlightenment teacher of the Martial Emperor.

“Senior Wan was a case of ‘accumulating thinly’ [thick accumulation, thin release], but this kid doesn't seem like that.”
“The world is vast and full of wonders. Senior Wan’s talent was astonishing, yet he was still stuck at the Internal Qi level at forty. That was also unprecedented.”
“Everyone’s talent is different. For him to be able to condense a Sword Pill at such a young age, he must have his own unique strengths.”

Elder Zeng sighed with emotion:
“To be able to incorporate so many sword techniques into his own use, I see much sweat and effort behind it.”
The several elders nodded in succession.

They had seen plenty of shocking sword prodigies, but they were even more interested in a character like Li Mo.

“It’s just that his personality is... slightly exaggerated.”
“Heh, who was it again, hiding their realm at an old age, and changing their appearance to participate in another sword sect’s new disciple selection?”
“What swordsmen do, can you call it showing off?”
“I’m curious, though. If he observes the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark, what will he comprehend?”

Eighty percent of the martial arts in Horizontal Cloud Sword City originated from that Sword Mark.

That Sword Mark was incredibly divine; anyone could comprehend martial arts from it.

What each person comprehended would be suited to themselves, and it wasn’t necessarily a sword technique.

The higher the talent, the better the martial art comprehended.

The elders were also quite curious.

“By the way, there’s one more thing.”

Elder Zeng coughed lightly, drawing everyone’s attention back:
“The boy surnamed Li sent me a letter through Jing Hong.”
“It concerns the ‘Mountain Rain Approaching Order’ of the Drizzle Pavilion.”

The expressions of the other elders and stewards immediately turned solemn.

The Mountain Rain Approaching Order represented a command issued directly from the main pavilion.

The Drizzle Pavilion had a loose internal management structure, and this was one of the few ways to mobilize personnel.

“That bunch of rats is profit-driven, but their operations are quite secretive. Is the information reliable?” an elder asked.

How did Li Mo know so much about the Drizzle Pavilion?

Elder Zeng paused, then nodded:
“It even marks two strongholds of the Drizzle Pavilion, including the whereabouts of the Drizzle Pavilion’s Saintess.”

The elders’ faces turned heavy.

This was almost certain confirmation.

Even the Saintess has come; their scheme must be significant. They surely didn’t come out for a team-building activity, right? Joking aside, the biggest characteristic of the Drizzle Pavilion is that they are profit-driven; they won’t act unless there’s a clear benefit.

However, the information currently available was still too little.

Everyone could only turn their gaze to the side.

The woman’s eyes were a faint gold, her face serene. Every movement she made had a sense of blending into nature.

If one wasn’t careful, one might even forget her existence.

“The Derivation Heaven Sect owes Horizontal Cloud Sword City a favor.”

The woman finally withdrew her attention from Li Mo. A flawless jade disc quietly floated before her:
“This little girl’s first divination upon leaving the mountain will settle this karmic debt.”

*Clatter—*

The jade pieces on the jade disc slid rapidly.

Looking at the divination on the disc, she first frowned, then her brow smoothed.

Elder Zeng felt a bit like a patient watching an old doctor show a difficult expression, and he couldn’t help but ask:
“Traveler, how is it?”

After a long while, she spoke softly:

---

“Turning bad luck into good.”

.......

The sky gradually darkened.

Today’s Sword Testing Tournament had come to a temporary conclusion.

There were many exciting duels later on, such as Shen Yunfei, Senior Brother Shen, breaking through a realm on the spot, and Senior Sister Xu Zhiqing advancing her sword qi a step further.

As for Senior Brother Ouyang... Senior Brother Ouyang didn’t even make an appearance.

He drew the latest chapter of ‘The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me’ on the spot and ran to the bookstore for a reprint.

Previously, it was already hard to find a single copy, and now with the new chapter, it’s likely to sell out.

After all, the most memorable moment of the tournament was still the scene of ‘Myriad Swords Return to the Origin.’ That scene was too shocking.

No one had ever used a sword with such a grand spectacle.

It would probably become a topic of conversation in the martial world of Yunzhou for a long time to come.

“Li Shaoxia must have ascended the Sword Tower by now.”
“I heard that this Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark was left by an immortal, it’s incredibly miraculous and profound. The higher the talent, the better the martial art one comprehends.”
“Hiss... I wonder what kind of shocking martial art Li Shaoxia will comprehend from it?”
“Hmph, Li Shaoxia is the reincarnation of the Sword Saint! Wouldn’t it be easy for him to comprehend a divine sword technique?”
“Sword Saint? Sword Immortal!”
“I have exclusive first-hand information here. That Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark was very likely划 out by Li Shaoxia in his past life with a casual swing of his sword! I’m telling you, but you must not tell anyone else!”
“Hiss! I am famously tight-lipped!”
“Bro, I have exclusive first-hand information...”

......

As is well known.

People in the martial world love to boast to show that their knowledge is superior to others.

This has led to Little Li’s classmate not only rising to fame but also becoming increasingly exaggerated.

On the carriage.

“Senior Brother Li, I’ve been sparring all day and plan to find a clinic to prepare some Qi-recovering and injury-healing pills, so I won’t be going back with you,” Shen Yunfei lifted the carriage curtain and said.
“Senior Brother, take care of yourself.”

Li Mo smiled, curling his lips:
“By the way, how did you know about the ‘Myriad Swords Return to the Origin’ incident at the Martial Arts Peak?”
Shen Yunfei: “......”

It was hard to imagine that this was the same person as the peerlessly elegant Senior Brother Li just moments ago.

He laughed dumbfoundedly:
“When Senior Brother Li comprehends the sword at the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark, you might create an even bigger commotion.”
“Once my injuries are better, I’ll come find you for a sparring match too.”

Shen Yunfei finished speaking, cupped his fist, and left.

Comprehending the sword?

Li Mo was taken aback.

Beside him, Ying Bing spoke softly:
“This is also the reason why Horizontal Cloud Sword City stands unshaken.”
“Those who test the sword can ascend the Sword Tower. Upon reaching the summit, they can see the Sword Mark.”
“The martial arts they comprehend can be taken away, but a copy must be left in Sword City.”

In this way, it not only makes a prodigy owe Sword City a favor.

But also allows them to借助 (borrow) the power of others to comprehend the Sword Mark.

“Comprehending the sword from the Sword Mark...”

The得意忘形 (elated and forgetful) Little Li calmed down and fell into deep thought.

With his sword talent, what would he comprehend?

Hmm...

This is bad.

I haven’t been a swordsman for long; is my persona about to collapse?
