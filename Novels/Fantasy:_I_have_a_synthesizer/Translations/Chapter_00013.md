**Chapter 13: Li Tianhe Escapes, Martial Artist Association's Compensation**

Su Yu's pupils suddenly constricted. "A big shot?" A hint of confusion appeared in his eyes.

At this moment, Liu Kuang explained, "You know about the college entrance exam, right?"

Su Yu nodded. Who didn't know about the college entrance exam? It could be said that it was the grandest event in Great Xia every year. Countless geniuses stood out from the exam, joined martial arts academies, and became top powerhouses of Great Xia. It was said that even the current top figures of Great Xia had emerged from martial arts academies. This showed how immensely attractive martial arts academies were to humanity. However, to join a martial arts academy, one had to pass the college entrance exam. Only by achieving good results in the exam could one qualify to enter.

Liu Kuang continued, "The college entrance exam is arguably the only opportunity for martial arts academies to select talent. For this reason, the Martial Artist Association has also made ample preparations."

"Preparations?" Su Yu grew even more confused.

Just from those three words, Su Yu could clearly sense that this so-called "Heavenly Pride Camp" was extraordinary. Instantly, Su Yu's breathing grew a little fervent.

"So, President Liu, the 'big shot' you mentioned..."

Liu Kuang smiled and nodded, saying, "That's right, that big shot is an instructor from the Heavenly Pride Camp. In a few days, they will personally come to Heng City to test you. If you pass, you'll be able to successfully enter the Heavenly Pride Camp. At that time, resources and cultivation techniques will all be openly supplied to you!"

Su Yu's eyes immediately widened. Such excellent treatment! If combined with his Synthesis Panel, wouldn't it allow him to improve even faster? For a moment, Su Yu felt a surge of anticipation.

Afterward, he chatted with Liu Kuang for a long time about the 'big shot' and an introduction to the Heavenly Pride Camp.

An hour or two later, Zhou Wen reappeared in Liu Kuang's office. However, Zhou Wen's expression was not very pleasant. Seeing Zhou Wen's grim face, Liu Kuang frowned slightly and said in a deep voice, "What's wrong?" Zhou Wen gritted his teeth.

Looking at the ten Body Tempering Pills in his hand, Su Yu couldn't help but lick his dry lips. He opened the Synthesis Panel and placed the Body Tempering Pills into it. A moment later, five glistening Bone Tempering Pills appeared in Su Yu's hand.

"Five Bone Tempering Pills! Give me a few days, and wouldn't I be able to break through to the late Blood Qi Realm, reaching 8 points of Blood Qi?"

"If I keep synthesizing..." Su Yu's heart suddenly filled with intense anticipation. He placed two Bone Tempering Pills into the Synthesis Panel and clicked the "Synthesize" button. Instantly, a burst of white light flashed. There, a pill resembling white jade lay in the Synthesis Panel. Below it, a line of large text slowly appeared: "Marrow Tempering Pill: Level 5 pill. Consumption guaranteed to increase Blood Qi by three points. Only side effect: can only be consumed once every five days!"

"A Level 5 pill!"
