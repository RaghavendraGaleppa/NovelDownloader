# Chapter 21: Unexpected Changes

Zhou Qing inadvertently gained a deeper understanding of the Deer Play's essence. As he walked, his waist and back grew slightly warm—a benefit from mastering the Tiger Play, which had strengthened those areas. Soon, his legs also began to heat up.

The Five Animal Plays engaged all his muscles, though each focused on different parts. The Tiger Play trained the waist, significantly enhancing the power of his fists. Strong back and waist muscles were the foundation of formidable boxing techniques.

On his way back to the city, Zhou Qing repeatedly practiced the Deer Play's footwork, feeling slight muscle tears in his legs. Nearing the city gates, he paused to straighten his clothes before calmly entering.

By the time he returned, dusk was approaching. Jiangcheng had visibly grown quieter, and security checks at the gates had become stricter. Fortunately, Zhou Qing's scholar status allowed him to bypass inspections with his xiucai waist token. Without it, entering and exiting the city would have been far more troublesome, with daily fees adding up to a significant expense.

Back in his courtyard, he found Morning Sun strutting about like a diligent guard. The large mulberry tree swayed in the cool evening breeze, its leaves shimmering under the faint moonlight and starlight that draped it in silver. To an outsider, the scene might have seemed eerily unsettling, but to Zhou Qing, it brought comfort. Human hearts were unpredictable, whereas Morning Sun and the mulberry tree, despite their peculiarities, were far simpler.

After catching his breath, Zhou Qing resumed practicing the Deer Play, this time openly chasing Morning Sun instead of ambushing it. The Deer Play helped him evade danger, but Morning Sun wasn't a threat—just a training partner. He had already grasped the movement's essence and remembered the proper force application.

He continued until dizziness forced him to stop, having failed to catch Morning Sun. The rooster had grown more agile, and without the element of surprise, capturing it was no easy feat. Zhou Qing was merely mimicking the deer to improve his flexibility, agility, and coordination—qualities Morning Sun naturally possessed. The only oddity was how the rooster seemed to grow more spirited around him, its heightened awareness further accelerating its development.

Too exhausted to ponder this, Zhou Qing lay on a stone bench, letting the cool breeze soothe him. His body radiated heat, the internal energy coursing through him thicker than before. Once it subsided, he felt his legs stronger and more solid than ever.

The Deer Play steadily improved, inching closer to mastery. "If I had a lightness skill to pair with the Deer Play, my ability to escape danger would reach new heights," Zhou Qing mused. The essence of combat lay in controlling distance. With a matching lightness skill, he could flee perilous situations and harass enemies with his Finger Flicking Technique, striking a balance between offense and defense. Close combat was a last resort—too risky, as a single misstep could be fatal.

While his Black Tiger Plucks the Heart strike was formidable, it would struggle against opponents wielding blades or poisoned daggers. Unarmed combat was always at a disadvantage against armed foes. Though the city had weapon shops, and his scholar status allowed him to purchase non-restricted arms, quality came at a price. He briefly considered commissioning Hu the Blacksmith but dismissed the idea—small forges lacked the facilities to produce high-quality weapons.

Once the Five Fragrance Pills brought in profits, Zhou Qing planned to buy several self-defense weapons and perhaps modify them. For now, his Finger Flicking Technique paired with iron pellets was the most practical option. He longed for a crossbow but knew obtaining one was difficult and risky—crossbows were banned, unlike bows, and their lethality at close range rivaled some modern handguns.

Two days later, the Five Fragrance Pills were shipped out, and Zhou Qing received an advance payment. Miss Lin, anticipating his financial needs, had sent it through Hu the Butcher. Scholars had many expenses—socializing, buying books, indulging in refined hobbies—so his need for funds was understandable. She wasn't worried; the pills would surely turn a profit.

Hu the Blacksmith had also delivered ten iron pellets wrapped in an unidentified animal hide. Though in a hurry, he emphasized the hide's value and urged Zhou Qing to keep it safe. Zhou Qing found this odd but didn't press for details, nor did he discover anything unusual about the hide.

With the pellets and advance payment secured, and the Black Chicken Pills ready after two days of drying, Zhou Qing focused on training. He swallowed a Black Chicken Pill and ate several pieces of cured duck—its fat content replenished the energy expended during martial practice. Lean meat alone wouldn't suffice; legend had it that eating nothing but rabbit meat could starve a person to death.

He trained cautiously, avoiding overeating beforehand to prevent interruptions. He hoped the Black Chicken Pills would prove effective; otherwise, the investment would be wasted. If they worked, he planned to share some with Miss Lin. Wealthy families like hers surely had access to tonics, but the pills, tailored for women, would make a thoughtful gift. Selling them wasn't feasible—convincing buyers of their efficacy would require extensive marketing, and their high cost limited the market.

In contrast, the Five Fragrance Pills' effects—eliminating bad breath and body odor—were immediate and noticeable, making them an easier sell. With ample food and the pills as supplements, Zhou Qing trained intensely.

The Tiger Play had plateaued at mastery, though continued practice still enhanced his physique. He now concentrated on the Deer Play and Finger Flicking Technique. With iron pellets, he practiced from ten paces farther than usual, using the sturdy mulberry tree as a target. The courtyard's size accommodated his training well.

As he immersed himself, heat surged through his body, improving his constitution and advancing the Deer Play. His Finger Flicking Technique also grew more proficient. In his spare time, he made more pills, hoping to elevate his beginner-level alchemy skills, though progress was slow—alchemy was by far his most challenging skill. Yet he sensed improvement; perseverance would yield results.

Half a month passed. Zhou Qing's endurance, energy, strength, and explosiveness had all improved, particularly in his legs, which now felt spring-loaded. While the Deer Play was excellent for training, it couldn't fully unleash his legs' potential in emergencies—human legs weren't designed like a deer's. He yearned for a leg-focused martial skill akin to Black Tiger Plucks the Heart.

The Finger Flicking Technique, though self-created, was simplistic, relying on hand-eye coordination and the force generation of the Tiger Play. Lightness skills were far more complex, with higher risks—mistakes could cripple him. Hu the Blacksmith's limp was likely the result of a botched training regimen. Without Zhou Qing's help deciphering ancient texts, he might have remained disabled forever. Thus, Hu owed Zhou Qing a debt, though the fragmented texts made it impossible to reconstruct their original meaning without risking misinterpretation.

Zhou Qing turned his attention to his Life Nurturing Record:

**Five Animal Plays (Proficient):**  
- Tiger Play (Mastered)  
- Deer Play (Mastered)  
- Bear Play (Proficient)  
- Bird Play (Proficient)  
- Monkey Play (Proficient)  

**Martial Techniques:**  
- Black Tiger Plucks the Heart (Mastered)  
- Finger Flicking Technique (Mastered)  

**Beginner Alchemy (Rudimentary)**  
**Literary Courage (Elementary)**  
**Remaining Lifespan: 38 years**  

The Deer Play and Finger Flicking Technique had reached mastery as expected, marking his current peak. Further progress would be arduous. Training was holistic, and Zhou Qing now aimed to focus on the Bear Play. Though more challenging than the Tiger and Deer Plays, the Black Chicken Pills would aid his advancement.

The pills' effects were remarkable—perhaps this world enhanced their potency. His remaining lifespan had increased to 38 years, thanks partly to the Deer Play but mostly to the pills. "First goal: live to a hundred," Zhou Qing mused, his motivation bolstered by the prospect of longevity. So far, only the Five Animal Plays significantly extended his lifespan.

Zhou Qing flicked an iron pellet, embedding it into the courtyard wall ten paces away, cracking the surrounding surface. Within ten paces, the pellets were deadly; between ten and twenty, they were passable; beyond twenty, only precise hits to vital areas would incapacitate an adult. "Accuracy isn't the issue—finger strength needs work," he noted. Improving it would allow him to refine Black Tiger Plucks the Heart into a more potent Tiger Claw Technique.

The training methods he'd read about resembled Iron Sand Palm—starting with coarse rice, then adding stones, then striking hard surfaces, lifting weights, and finally using iron sand. Even with medicinal aids, the process was grueling and risky. But suffering beat dying. In this perilous world, with chaos spreading, Zhou Qing resolved to toughen his fingers. The mystical heat within him could heal training injuries, so long as he avoided fractures. Still, he planned to study bone-setting techniques as a precaution.

His gaze fell on Morning Sun, who promptly fled. "Clever bird," Zhou Qing chuckled, dismissing the thought of experimenting on it.

Six rapid knocks sounded at the gate—Hu the Butcher's signal. "Young Master Zhou, trouble!" he exclaimed urgently.

"With the Five Fragrance Pills?"

Hu nodded. The Lin family had attempted to expand the pills' market to Changzhou, but bandits had intercepted a shipment. Though the pills were easily concealed, and Miss Lin had sent three separate caravans, one had been lost. The oddity was that the bandits seemed to target the pills specifically, suggesting an inside leak.

"Do you think the Lin family staged this?" Hu asked, familiar with underhanded tactics. Perhaps they sought to swindle Zhou Qing, seeing him as a naive scholar. The pills were already in high demand in Jiangcheng, yet Miss Lin had prioritized expanding to Changzhou.

After a long pause, Zhou Qing asked, "Did they request a meeting?"

"They invited you to dine at Dingtai Restaurant tonight."

"Then we'll see tonight." Zhou Qing sent Hu away and sighed. Peace was elusive. He suspected the Lin family knew more than they let on—this wasn't mere banditry but envy-driven sabotage. Profitable, low-effort ventures always attracted greedy eyes. Securing a 55% share wouldn't be easy.

At Dingtai Restaurant tonight, he likely wouldn't meet just the Lin family. He'd have to play it by ear.
