Chapter 133: Spirit Rhyme Qi, Inner Disciple

"This disciple's entry into the Spirit Realm went smoothly. Although the location of the formation wasn't close, I didn't encounter too much trouble along the way..."

Chu Ning immediately began his recounting. Of course, he wouldn't tell the full truth about his experiences. After all, when he encountered the Yin Demon Sect members fighting, he wasn't using his true appearance. Moreover, Tan Zhang and Lin Lan had already perished in the Spirit Rhyme outburst, so naturally, no one else would know. As for his engagement with and killing of that perfected Qi Condensation inner disciple, he certainly wouldn't mention that either. Who knew if that person had connections to any of the Golden Core cultivators present?

However, it was clear that the sect's high-ranking officials weren't very interested in how he reached the formation's location. So, even though Chu Ning kept his account brief, they didn't press him for details.

It was only when Chu Ning spoke of entering the Five Elements Qiankun Array that concern began to show on their faces. At this point, Chu Ning had nothing to hide, so he immediately told them everything truthfully, down to the last detail. This even included the incident where the cultivator surnamed Yan killed some disciples to make a statement. He continued until he reached the appearance of the Spirit Seed and the Spirit Rhyme outburst.

Chu Ning also had a good explanation for this, as he had previously received the Earth Spirit Bracelet as a reward from the sect. He then mentioned that he had many mid-grade low-tier defensive talismans on him. Liao Yunming had given him some before, and he had used them when he encountered and killed the Yin Demon Sect disciples. As for mid-grade mid-tier defensive talismans, Chu Ning did not mention them.

After Chu Ning finished speaking, Xin Wuya's gaze turned towards him, showing a hint of eagerness. "You mean, when the Spirit Rhyme burst forth, you were activating the formation? Then, did you obtain Spirit Rhyme Qi?"

Spirit Rhyme Qi? Ah, Chu Ning suddenly realized at that moment that he seemed to have overlooked this matter entirely. Because of the series of events that followed the array's breakage, merely surviving had made Chu Ning feel incredibly fortunate. For a time, he hadn't even thought about this.

Now, hearing Xin Wuya's question, Chu Ning suddenly remembered. During that Spirit Rhyme outburst, a green stream of light seemed to have flowed down the stone pillar and entered his palm. However, at the time, Chu Ning was busy resisting the impact of the Spirit Rhyme outburst and didn't give it much thought. Recalling it now, Chu Ning's heart stirred. Could that have been Spirit Rhyme Qi?

Thinking this, Chu Ning said with some uncertainty, "This disciple isn't sure how one would know if they've obtained this Spirit Rhyme Qi."

Xin Wuya quickly replied, "When the Spirit Rhyme burst forth, did you feel the Spirit Rhyme Qi, transformed into a stream of light, enter your body along the stone pillar? Or, can you now circulate your energy and feel if there's a mass of undissolved pure spiritual energy in your dantian?"

Hearing Xin Wuya's words, Chu Ning generally understood. He immediately circulated his energy to sense it. Sure enough, the next moment, he discovered a mass of extremely pure spiritual energy within his dantian. Chu Ning tried to activate it, and instantly, threads of that supremely pure spiritual energy began to flow out, not only transforming into mana within his dantian but also surging throughout his four limbs and hundred bones. At the same time, the spiritual energy surrounding Chu Ning also showed a slight fluctuation.

The moment Chu Ning activated the Spirit Rhyme Qi in his dantian, Xin Wuya, seated on the main chair, immediately shot up. He then flashed and appeared beside Chu Ning. "Spirit Rhyme Qi! You truly obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi!" Xin Wuya's voice at this moment held a trace of delighted surprise. He had immediately sensed it when Chu Ning activated the Spirit Rhyme Qi in his dantian.

"Stop quickly!"

Hearing Xin Wuya's command, Chu Ning immediately stopped, looking at Xin Wuya with some confusion. The Sect Master of Qingxi Sect smiled and said, "This Spirit Rhyme Qi can improve spiritual root aptitude. For now, don't activate it casually."

"Junior Brother Chu, you really obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi." Mu Ling, standing nearby, looked over with an envious expression. From her words, Chu Ning vaguely understood. Mu Ling must have already told everyone what had happened in the Spirit Realm, and clearly, Senior Sister Mu had not been able to obtain Spirit Rhyme Qi.

"Just luck!" Chu Ning showed a slight smile on his face. For him, possessing the Yin Wood Spirit Body, whether his spiritual root aptitude improved or not wasn't something he particularly cared about. However, this Spirit Rhyme Qi clearly had more than just this one effect. Advancing cultivation was also inevitable. Moreover, Chu Ning remembered that Elder Tong had made it very clear back then: if he wanted to obtain higher-grade cultivation techniques, he would have to become an inner disciple. And the sect had always stated that anyone who obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi could become an inner disciple.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Xin Wuya had already flashed back to his seat, looking at him with a smiling gaze. "Chu Ning, according to sect rules, obtaining Spirit Rhyme Qi grants promotion to an inner disciple. I intend to take you under my wing. What do you think?"

Chu Ning was slightly startled by these words. Could the Spirit Rhyme Qi's ability to improve cultivation aptitude be so powerful? The Sect Master of Qingxi Sect actually wanted to accept him as a disciple? Although he felt that this matter was a little strange, and the sect's actions regarding the Wood Spirit Seed had made Chu Ning somewhat wary of this seemingly refined and gentle Sect Master, Chu Ning clearly couldn't refuse at this moment.

He seemed to have just recovered, his face immediately showing a look of pleasant surprise. He blurted out, "The Sect Master wishes to accept me as a disciple?"

"Precisely!" Xin Wuya nodded with a smile. "However, you are currently only in the Qi Condensation stage, so I can only accept you as a registered disciple. Cultivate diligently. Once you reach the Foundation Establishment stage, I will formally accept you as an official disciple. Since you've obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi, as long as you cultivate assiduously, there is great hope for you to enter the Foundation Establishment stage."

Chu Ning nodded with delight. At this moment, the black-faced Elder Zhu immediately laughed, "Why aren't you quickly kneeling to acknowledge your master and thank the Sect Master?"

Xin Wuya immediately waved his hand, saying, "There's no hurry for the kneeling ceremony. We'll perform the discipleship ritual when he's accepted as an official disciple."

"Thank you, Sect Master!" Chu Ning immediately cupped his hands and bowed. Xin Wuya slightly nodded, accepting the salute, then turned to Elder Mu, the silver-haired old woman. "Elder Mu, although Mu Ling didn't obtain Spirit Rhyme Qi, she also contributed significantly in the Spirit Realm this time. Don't let her stay in the outer sect anymore; let her cultivate in seclusion in the inner sect."

Elder Mu nodded. "This old woman had also intended for her to cultivate in the inner sect. Previously, I just wanted to temper her character. After this experience, she should have gained some enlightenment."

Xin Wuya smiled upon hearing this, then directly stood up and said, "Then it's settled. The matters concerning the Spirit Realm this time are largely clear. We'll simply inquire further once the other injured disciples awaken. We'll also see if any other disciples obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi and can enter the inner sect for cultivation."

Finishing his words, Xin Wuya addressed Chu Ning, "Chu Ning, come with me." Hearing this, Chu Ning didn't hesitate and immediately followed him.

Immediately after, Elder Mu also left with Mu Ling.

Within Clear Heart Hall, only the white-haired Elder Yang in green robes, the injured Elder Gui in red robes, and the black-faced Elder Zhu remained.

"The Sect Master's state of mind is growing stronger. Such a major event happened today, yet he can remain so calm so quickly," Elder Zhu, with his black face, sighed with emotion.

Elder Gui in red robes now looked at Elder Yang in green robes. "Brother Yang, why did the Sect Master accept this disciple? Could it be that he still hasn't given up on that Spirit Seed?"

Elder Gui's words were filled with displeasure. The black-faced Elder Zhu was slightly surprised to hear this. "What do you mean, Brother Gui? The Spirit Seed has clearly escaped. If it couldn't be caught immediately, even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't be able to pursue it. Where would we even begin to search?"

Elder Gui didn't speak upon hearing this, only continuing to gaze at the white-haired Elder Yang. Elder Yang finally sighed at this moment, "Indeed, there was a rumor that if the spiritual energy within the Wood Spirit Seed was not absorbed and refined by someone, then the cultivator who obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi would be able to roughly sense the Spirit Seed's location during their Foundation Establishment."

"Roughly sense?" The black-faced Elder Zhu asked, a hint of confusion in his tone. "Then how could it truly be found?"

Elder Gui chuckled at this point. "Brother Zhu, don't forget, among the disciples who previously obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi in the sect, although most have reached Foundation Establishment, there are still two who haven't. Add to that the batch of five from a few months ago, and that makes seven. With Chu Ning, it's eight people." Elder Gui's face showed no emotion, yet his words revealed a hint of complexity. "As long as they don't all establish their foundations at the same time, each time one enters Foundation Establishment, they can sense a rough area and direction. Then, the next person can be brought to that area, continuously narrowing down the scope."

Speaking of this, Elder Gui paused, then continued, "Chu Ning originated as a utility disciple, has the lowest cultivation, and is the youngest. Naturally, he is most likely to be the last one to reach Foundation Establishment. Thinking like this, the Sect Master's decision to accept him into his lineage becomes self-evident."

The black-faced Elder Zhu, hearing this, his eyes flickering, looked at Elder Yang in green robes. "Brother Yang, is what Brother Gui said true?"

Elder Yang in green robes slightly nodded, and his aged voice spoke. "Perhaps, but whether this matter will succeed remains unknown."

Seeing that the black-faced Elder Zhu was about to say something more, he immediately waved his hand. "Brother Zhu, you don't need to say anything further to me. My cultivation has been crippled, and I've already told the Sect Master that I'm no longer suitable for this Elder position. Brother Tong's lifespan limit is approaching; there happens to be an empty spot in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, so I'll go there." Elder Yang in green robes said, standing up and walking towards the main entrance of Clear Heart Hall, his back exuding a sense of desolation.

Inside Clear Heart Hall, Elder Gui and Elder Zhu exchanged glances, their eyes filled with complex emotions. This time, however, neither of them spoke.

Meanwhile, Chu Ning followed Xin Wuya, leaving from the back of Clear Heart Hall, and arrived at Xin Wuya's cave dwelling. Xin Wuya was still seated on the main chair, with Chu Ning standing below him.

"Chu Ning, now that you've joined the inner sect, do you have any plans?"

Hearing Xin Wuya's words, Chu Ning's eyes flickered. After thinking for a moment, he shook his head. "This disciple has just received this joyous news and hasn't yet considered the matter."

"Then I, your master, shall arrange it for you." Xin Wuya casually took out a green jade token, then waved his hand, sending it into Chu Ning's grasp. "This jade token is the forbidden plaque for a cave dwelling on the east side of the inner sect. Although the cave dwelling isn't large, its spiritual energy is rich. Even among the inner sect Foundation Establishment cultivators, it's considered good. Cultivate diligently there. Refine that Spirit Rhyme Qi in the shortest possible time, improve your aptitude, then focus on cultivating and advancing to reach the perfected Qi Condensation realm as early as possible. At that time, your master will help you establish your foundation."

Seeing the look of surprise on Chu Ning's face, Xin Wuya continued, "I've now added a layer of imprint to this jade token; it also serves as your identity token. You can go to the Thousand Mechanism Pavilion. The pills and other cultivation spiritual medicines there, as long as they aren't special, you can claim as you wish. Of course, only for your own use."

Upon hearing Xin Wuya's words, Chu Ning's mouth involuntarily fell open slightly. However, Xin Wuya didn't stop there but continued, "Also, in the Scripture Pavilion, you can choose suitable cultivation techniques and spells for yourself. This includes the talisman crafting technique you practice; anything open to Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment disciples, you can view and borrow."

Speaking of this, Xin Wuya paused, a hint of seriousness appearing on his face. "However, at present, it's not advisable for you to cultivate too many spells, nor should you devote too much energy to talisman crafting. You must focus on cultivating and raising your cultivation realm."

Chu Ning was somewhat dazed by Xin Wuya's sudden outpouring of words. He even suspected that the other party wasn't trying to recruit him as a disciple, but rather as a live-in son-in-law.

"Something's not right! Very not right!" Chu Ning's face still bore an expression of shock and overjoyed excitement, but his heart was filled with intense doubt. Even if he had obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi and could improve his aptitude, he couldn't possibly receive such treatment all at once. There had to be another reason that he wasn't aware of.

These thoughts flashed quickly through Chu Ning's mind, but he naturally wouldn't reveal them. With a face full of smiles and joy, he bowed and saluted Xin Wuya, "Thank you, Sect Master! This disciple previously had some spiritual plants and such in Yanji Market. Once I've gone to retrieve them, I will immediately cultivate diligently. I will strive to break through to perfected Qi Condensation and successfully establish my foundation as quickly as possible, so as not to disappoint the Sect Master's efforts in nurturing me."

Xin Wuya immediately waved his hand at this. "Those trivial things, you needn't bother with them. The Thousand Mechanism Pavilion has all sorts of spirit pills and medicines; just go and claim what you need. Since you've obtained Spirit Rhyme Qi, it's best not to leave the sect casually before completing your Foundation Establishment. Otherwise, if the Yin Demon Sect learns of it, they certainly won't let you off easily."

"Yes, Sect Master," Chu Ning responded, lowering his head and displaying a timely look of surprise. At this moment, his heart sank, and another word surfaced in his mind: House arrest?

After expressing his profuse gratitude, Chu Ning exited Xin Wuya's cave dwelling and soared through the air, following the direction indicated by the jade token in his hand. At this moment, he didn't ponder any of the previous words, simply curious and focused on heading towards the cave dwelling. A Golden Core cultivator's divine sense was surely immensely powerful; his every move might be under Xin Wuya's perception. Chu Ning worried that if he started thinking deeply about anything, some expression might unconsciously appear on his face.

Flying like this, Chu Ning realized just how vast the inner sect truly was. The previous utility area, with its spiritual plant rooms, spirit beast rooms, and various utility disciples, along with spiritual fields and the like, was already quite large. But the mountain range where the inner sect was located was no smaller in the slightest. Within it were both numerous multi-story pavilions and individual cave dwellings nestled on small mountaintops.

After flying for more than a hundred *li*, Chu Ning finally arrived at the cave dwelling on the east side. Holding the forbidden token, he entered the cave dwelling, and a hint of surprise immediately flickered in Chu Ning's eyes.

This cave dwelling was simply too good! In terms of spiritual energy density, it was incomparably higher than the outer sect courtyards. While it couldn't compare to some of the most spiritually abundant places within the Spirit Realm, it was by no means inferior to most ordinary locations.

Centrally located was a cultivation chamber, with a medicinal garden in front, and on either side, living quarters, a study, a spirit beast room, a talisman crafting room, and so on. Everything was readily available.

"Perhaps even a Foundation Establishment cultivator's cave dwelling wouldn't be much better than this."

Even knowing that Xin Wuya's goodwill towards him might hide ulterior motives, Chu Ning's face still showed satisfaction purely based on this cave dwelling.

"Is Senior Brother Chu in?"

Just then, a shout came from outside the cave dwelling. Chu Ning walked out at the sound and saw a young boy in green clothes standing outside. "Senior Brother Chu, this disciple is Lin Xiaobo from the Thousand Mechanism Pavilion. I'm here on orders to deliver some items to Senior Brother."

With that, the green-clothed boy presented a pile of items to Chu Ning. Chu Ning took them, and the boy smiled, "Senior Brother Chu, these are just some everyday necessities. The Pavilion Master has ordered that from now on, you can pass through the Thousand Mechanism Pavilion without hindrance simply by showing your identity token. If you need anything else for cultivation, just claim it directly from the Pavilion."

Chu Ning nodded his thanks, and the green-clothed boy promptly left.

Chu Ning brought the items into the cave dwelling and found several sets of green sect robes for inner disciples, along with a bottle of pills, a bag of spiritual rice, and some spirit beast meat. At the same time, Chu Ning also saw a small bag of spirit stones. Opening it, Chu Ning couldn't help but exclaim internally, "Good heavens!" Inside were a full ten mid-grade spirit stones. He had only acquired a few tens of these even after selling so many talismans previously. As for the pills, they were Yuan Gathering Pills, the most commonly used pills for cultivators in the mid-Qi Condensation stage.

After carefully putting these items away one by one, Chu Ning finally began to truly ponder the series of events that had occurred today, contemplating the hidden intentions behind Sect Master Xin Wuya's generosity.

"Spirit Rhyme Qi! Foundation Establishment!"

From Xin Wuya's words, Chu Ning easily extracted two key terms. The other party's treatment of him was definitely not normal. Even if it was related to the Spirit Rhyme Qi within him, unless...

The Spirit Seed!

A thought suddenly surged in Chu Ning's mind. What Xin Wuya cared about was certainly not the Spirit Rhyme Qi in him; what the other party truly cared about could only be the Spirit Seed.

"Could this Spirit Rhyme Qi be able to locate the Spirit Seed? No, that's not right; the other party also wants me to refine this Spirit Rhyme Qi. And Foundation Establishment? Why does the other party repeatedly emphasize that I should cultivate diligently and reach Foundation Establishment quickly?"

Chu Ning carefully sorted through his thoughts. He could basically deduce that this nominal Sect Master teacher most likely wanted to use the Spirit Rhyme Qi in him to probe the Spirit Seed's whereabouts. And there might be some connection with Foundation Establishment in the process. However, at this moment, he couldn't figure out too many clues.
