# Chapter 57: Storm Brews in Liang Territory  

Daliang City—the heart of Liang Territory, a crucial stronghold of Northern Jin, and one of the few grand cities in the realm.  

Prosperous as blooming flowers, seething like boiling oil.  

Countless noble families, sects, and martial arts magnates gathered here.  

Scattered silver-white hair was slowly tied up with a wooden hairpin. The man draped a deep blue robe over his shoulders, massaged his temples, and pushed open the door.  

Sunlight streamed into the room, dispelling the darkness and revealing a pair of fair, rounded thighs on the bed before the blanket hastily covered the exposed skin.  

The silver-haired man noticed but paid no heed. "You're already selling yourself, so why the act?"  

"Do you really think I don't know your game?"  

"You're looking for trouble."  

"Fair enough—only the loudest cries get fed."  

"Just look at the Northern Territory. After all that commotion, their treatment improved drastically—tax cuts, massive imperial funding. It's downright enviable."  

A deep voice interjected, "That belongs to us, the people of Liang."  

A middle-aged man strode in with hands clasped behind his back. Gold-cloud embroidery adorned his sleeves, and the jade pendant at his waist shimmered with flowing light, its patterns shifting like living mist—clearly no ordinary artifact.  

"Jin Wuming!"  

"You must honor your promise."  

Jin Wuming sneered. "Impossible!"  

"You think I'd risk my life for some cheap woman? Ridiculous."  

"My brother was a fool, but I'm not."  

The middle-aged man's expression darkened. "That was my daughter—the sole heir of the Du Clan."  

Jin Wuming slapped his stomach mockingly. "The illustrious Du Clan of Daliang—renowned across the land."  

"You're a Pure Yang Grandmaster, the head of your clan. How can you be so naive?"  

"If I, Jin Wuming, wanted a woman, any woman would be within my reach."  

"Sleeping with some worthless girl and expecting me to fight for you? Such childish talk from a man of your standing—no wonder the Du Clan has declined. Not a single Earth Ranking Grandmaster in generations!"  

"Unlike your peers—the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou, the Lin Clan of the capital—they've never lacked Earth Ranking experts. The Wang Clan even had the Twin Kings, both ranked on the Earth Ranking."  

"Though the elder Wang is dead, the younger has surpassed him, now ranked ninth on the Earth Ranking. A single visit to the Northern Territory silenced all the demons and monsters."  

"Such might—who wouldn't fear it?"  

"Give me ten more years, and killing you would be as easy as slaughtering a dog."  

"Even now, you can't stop me if I choose to leave."  

Du Changwang's eyes darkened as he glared at Jin Wuming.  

With a loud laugh, Jin Wuming strode away without a backward glance. The Du Clan of Daliang? Did they still think the old matriarch was alive to protect them?  

The Du Matriarch had shielded them for sixty years, yet they remained useless, producing no worthy successors.  

If Du Changwang dared to act, Jin Wuming couldn't defeat him head-on now, but through ambushes and assassinations, he could wipe out the Du Clan eventually.  

Du Changwang watched Jin Wuming leave, his hand twitching several times with the urge to strike. But in the end, he restrained himself.  

Jin Wuming was ranked nineteenth on the Human Ranking—within the top twenty, where every individual was destined to reach the Divine Marvel realm and become a Grandmaster. Many could have already broken through but held back for the benefits of the Jixia Academy or other Human Ranking privileges.  

If Jin Wuming ascended, Du Changwang stood no chance.  

The top twenty on the Human Ranking were prodigies who had already matured.  

Taking a deep breath, Du Changwang turned away without sparing a glance at the room behind him. He entered a side hall where an anxious man awaited.  

Before the man could speak, Du Changwang stated bluntly, "Jin Wuming refused."  

The man sighed. "That's to be expected."  

"Jin Wuming still has a few years before he hits thirty. If those ahead of him ascend or age out, and he refines his skills further, he has a real shot at the Human Ranking's top ten."  

"Someone like him, proud and arrogant, would never risk entanglement in Liang's conflicts over a woman."  

Du Changwang snapped, "Enough hindsight wisdom."  

"Since the Empress ascended the throne, she's oppressed Liang Territory."  

"She dismantled our fortresses, leaving Liang and the Northern Territory wide open."  

"And still unsatisfied, she siphons Liang's wealth to appease those Northern barbarians."  

"Liang suffers!"  

Du Changwang's agitation flared. "Our ancestors braved dangers, crossing mountains to establish trade routes—now rendered useless!"  

"No need to bypass checkpoints—free passage, tax-free!"  

"Our Du Clan's businesses have collapsed. Those Northern savages won't even trade with us anymore."  

"The Du Clan's decline is all because of that Empress."  

"Now, every household is furious, itching to stir trouble like the Northerners did."  

Suddenly, Du Changwang's anger dissipated. He sighed heavily. "I know the truth—without the fortresses, Liang is defenseless. If the North falls, Liang follows. That's why no one dares act."  

"They want to oppose the Empress, but the Du Clan is a pillar of Daliang."  

"We can't stand aside, nor can we aid the Empress—where would that leave our standing?"  

"Betraying our homeland would sever our roots, leaving us no future."  

"We're forced to walk this dark path. But the North dared rebel because they have 200,000 border troops, five Earth Ranking experts in this generation alone—not counting the elders."  

"Barbaric customs, fierce people, warriors who thrive on violence—each one a wolf cub."  

"What does Liang have to match that?"  

"The Empress appeases the North because they wield blades. What do we have? Nothing!"  

"Yet those fools, blinded by greed, don't know their own limits."  

"The Du Clan, a millennium-old legacy, will be destroyed in my hands."  

"Second Brother, send my daughter away—hide her well. Jin Wuming is still young, unaware of our clan's secret arts. Once his child is born, he won't abandon them."  

"As long as my daughter lives, the Du Clan survives."  

"Adopt a descendant later, rebuild the clan, gather some branches. Even if we never regain our glory, we'll at least survive this calamity."  

The man nodded approvingly. "With Jin Wuming's son rebuilding the Du Clan, he won't stand idly by."  

"The world underestimates you, Elder Brother."  

Du Changwang sighed. "I wish I were as foolish as them."  

"I've tried to deceive myself, but I can't."  

"I can't share their greed, blinded by petty gains."  

"I've failed the Matriarch."  

"I've disappointed her."

**Author's Note:**  

Got home and realized—it's freezing. Too cold to leave the blankets during the day, and at night, it's even worse. My hands are numb. Bought an electric heater; salvation arrives tomorrow. The heating kicks in on the 20th. Every year, I tough it out, but this time, I've gone soft. Once you've tasted comfort, hardship becomes unbearable.
