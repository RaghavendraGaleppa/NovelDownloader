# Chapter 57: Cross-Server Dialogue, The Terrifying Effects of Earth Vein Spirit Milk

A quarter of an hour later.

Not far away, Jiang Chulong held the broken bowl and licked the bottom like a little cat. Her dirty little face finally relaxed slightly.

The delicious wild vegetable and meat porridge made her numb body feel a little warmer, and even the pain in her chest wasn't so bad anymore.

She quietly raised her head and glanced at the youth beside her out of the corner of her eyes.

The youth propped his chin up, looking in the direction of the Clear Abyss Mountain, his expression filled with some worry. He was afraid that the Ice Cube might poison herself while cooking.

It seemed she had sensed his gaze, as the youth turned his head.

She lowered her head again as if electrocuted, silently burying her face in the bowl.

"I... I'm... finished eating."

"If it's not enough, I can go make some more."

Looking at Jiang Chulong, who had her eyes covered and lowered her head timidly with low self-esteem, Li Mo felt even more strange in his heart.

She was down on her luck now, but a year ago, she was still a little princess of the Yu Dynasty.

Even if a random princess came to Ziyang Prefecture, the Prefecture would have to hang lanterns and decorate with festoons, and the Sect Leaders of the Three Sectures would have to be present to welcome her personally.

A princess was of noble blood, standing high above the clouds, priceless and noble.

"No... No need... The... rice..."

Jiang Chulong shook her head vigorously like a rattle drum.

"You want to save the rice to eat later?"

"En."

But seeing Jiang Chulong treat a bag of rice as a precious treasure, Li Mo felt it was absurd, yet he couldn't feel any sense of违和感 (dissonance).

"There's a charity hall at the Mu Mansion. You can go there to get porridge and rice for this period of time."

Upon hearing this, Jiang Chulong raised her head, and even through the cloth strip, one could see her eyes light up.

"Then... I can store it until winter..."

"You really plan to save it for the New Year?"

Li Mo无奈 (helplessly) smiled wryly.

Thinking for a moment, he took out two silver bills of small denominations.

"If you run out of food, just go to the street and buy some."

"This... what is this?"

Jiang Chulong's dirty little face was full of confusion.

She didn't recognize silver bills.

Little Li Student fell into silence.

After Meng Can finished eating, he covered his little belly with a happy look and said:

"Stuttering Sister, that's money! You can use it to buy grain, buy roasted chicken, buy sugar gourds, it's super useful!"

He took the silver bill and looked at it carefully, his eyes widening suddenly:

"One... One hundred taels!"

"One hundred taels... how much is that?"

"One tael of silver can buy one hundred and forty catties of rice!"

Jiang Chulong: "!"

She counted on her dirty little fingers, and her fingers trembled as she counted. She was completely stunned.

The Princess's shock.

"Too... Too much... We... only..."

Jiang Chulong bit her lip, not daring to look at the dazzling silver bill.

"You want to say we are strangers who have never met, so you can't accept so much money, right?"

Li Mo answered for her again.

Meng Can looked at him神奇 (magically). Brother Li actually knew what the Stuttering Sister wanted to say?

"En."

Jiang Chulong nodded怯生生 (timidly), her little face tightening.

The other party opened a charity hall to relieve the poor.

But even if he was kind-hearted, there was no reason or logic to give her such a huge sum of money.

Mother said, perhaps there is unprovoked evil in this world, but there cannot be unprovoked kindness.

A pie won't fall from the sky unless there is another motive...

Just as she was raising her guard.

Li Mo spoke again:

"First of all, one hundred taels is nothing to me. It's no different from a bag of rice, or a single grain of rice."

"Wow..."

The little kids all showed looks of崇拜 (admiration), especially Meng Can, whose eyes showed a strong longing.

Jiang Chulong was stunned, seemingly镇住 (dominated) by Li Mo's 'domineering wealth'.

Li Mo continued:

"Secondly, I was entrusted by someone. I promised her I would take care of you."

"Entrusted by someone?"

Jiang Chulong murmured softly. Her little hand suddenly gathered strength from somewhere,紧紧 (tightly) grabbing the corner of her clothes:

"Is she... is she still alive?"

The only person in the world who still cared about her was probably Aunt Mei.

Aunt Mei was her mother's former sword maid.

And also the person who, after her mother died, took care of her as if she were her own.

To save her, she drew away a large number of Patrol Sky Guards. Her life or death was still unknown.

Li Mo... was he entrusted by Aunt Mei to take care of her?

"En, she has already escaped danger for the time being."

---

Li Mo nodded firmly.

The Ice Cube was quite scary at night, like a thousand-year-old ice.

But cold was cold, it couldn't be called dangerous.

"That's good... That's good..."

Under the cloth strip covering her eyes, two lines of clear tears flowed down.

Where the tears passed, it was like a piece of fine jade wiping away some dust, white and crystal clear.

She hurriedly wiped her face messily, making it dirty again.

"Th... Thank you."

"But this money... it's still... too much."

"Then how about this."

Li Mo thought for a moment and said: "Why don't you come with me to the Clear Abyss Sect? You'll naturally be able to see her there, and you won't need to worry about the difficulties of life anymore."

The Ice Cube told him to solve Jiang Chulong's food, clothing, and housing anyway.

Why not just take her directly to the Autumn Water Pavilion?

You tell me, did I solve it or not!

Moreover, she could also add Jiang Chulong to his daily investment list. It was simply perfect.

"Stuttering Sister..."

"Is Sister leaving?"

The little kids looked at each other, their mouths瘪 (puckered) up. Two little girls instantly had tearful eyes, looking like they were about to cry.

The slightly older Da Zhu hurriedly said loudly: "Sister's relatives came to find her. We should be happy."

This statement was obviously not very effective, as even he himself was distracted and panicked.

"I... I won't... won't go."

Jiang Chulong shook her head slowly.

"I can have someone look after them," Li Mo said softly.

"No... I don't want... to put her in danger."

Seeing her slowly speak, Li Mo remembered.

Jiang Chulong was still being搜捕 (hunted) by the Patrol Sky Guards.

These weren't the type like Cui Peng.

The Patrol Sky Guards were the strongest military force of the Great Yu, an important reliance for the dynasty to dominate the nine heavens and ten earths.

She didn't want to implicate her friends, huh?

"Alright, it's getting late. I'll head back first."

She was a Golden Fate, also bearing a heaven-defying karma.

Li Mo nodded, deciding to plan long-term.

Jiang Chulong's current situation definitely wasn't suitable to be by his side for a long time, and she wouldn't be willing either.

How exactly should he invest in her?

Thinking like this.

Li Mo waved goodbye to the little beggars and walked out of the dilapidated dwelling.

The youth's back disappeared into the night.

"Goodbye, Brother Li!"

The little kids all ran out to see him off.

.....

In the courtyard of the Mu Mansion.

"Strange, she doesn't have half a bit of martial realm. Did she never practice martial arts?"

"Or did her sword bone get dug out, causing her to fall to a mortal?"

"If I can lead her back into the path of martial arts, the System will definitely give an unimaginable reward."

Li Mo was沉思 (pondering) in the courtyard.

If he wanted to take Jiang Chulong to practice martial arts, but couldn't bring her by his side...

How could this be done?

Just as he was thinking, a servant girl came:

"Li Gongzi, the hot water is ready. Please take a bath."

"Okay."

"Do you need a servant girl to serve you by the side..."

"No, thank you."

The servant girl walked away with a face full of disappointment.

Li Mo lay in the large bathtub and claimed his reward.

[Earth Vein Spirit Milk]: "It takes thousands of years of sedimentation of Earth Vein Qi to condense a single drop. It is a holy product for tempering Qi and blood. However, its strongest effect is still in extending life!"

"I don't really need to extend my life."

"I'll just use it to temper my Qi and blood."

A full bottle of Earth Vein Spirit Milk. Li Mo opened it and poured two drops into the bathtub.

If Elder Xue Jing were here, he would probably let out a sharp shriek.

This stuff is a rare treasure for refining Life-Extending Pills! You little brat are using it to take a bath?

Whatever it is, if it's related to extending life, it becomes incredibly precious.

Because there are never a shortage of people on the verge of death in this world.

Drip—

The two drops of Spirit Milk fell into the water, quickly making the water glow with a crystal light.

Li Mo干脆 (simply) operated the Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method directly inside the bathtub.

Hum—

In an instant, he achieved the state of man-nature unity.

This time, because he used the Earth Vein Spirit Milk, the resonance with the heavens and earth was several times greater.

The entire Mu Mansion could clearly perceive it.
