Chapter 206: Heroes of the Jianghu, My Lady, Please Enter

Li Xian practiced his martial arts, contemplated the essence of techniques, and digested the精华 (essence). His strength advanced steadily, his foundation grew increasingly profound, and naturally, he reached the "Eight Transformations of Food Essence."

A faint, dark light burst forth from his body surface, his immortal demeanor impossible to conceal.

His long hair moved without wind, exuding a unique charm.

Lady Wen said in surprise, "As martial artists of the Food Essence realm consume spiritual treasures and digest essence, their physique undergoes daily transformations. Those with the Perfect Physique will see its characteristics become increasingly prominent. Even after a certain degree of transformation, other features may emerge."

"The Perfect Physique is like a fine piece of porcelain; its martial arts display anomalies, surpassing others. However, among fine porcelains, there are still differences. Little Xian's porcelain seems to be crafted by a master, meticulously carved. Its form is truly exceptional."

It was the first day of the first lunar month.

The climate had warmed, and frost and snow had somewhat decreased. Servants took advantage of the fine weather to clear the snow from the roads.

At the side gate of the One Union Manor.

Lady Wen rode a white horse, her skirt concealed beneath a light green cloak. Her hair was coiled up, adorned with a silver hairpin. Her skin was fair, and her red lips alluring.

This journey was a genuine foray into the Jianghu.

Li Xian was fully equipped.

He wore a soft silken armor, a precious treasure from the Prefecture City. However, it was crafted within the One Union Manor, capable of withstanding blades, spears, clubs, and palm or fist strikes... woven from fine, tough silk, its principles were complex and varied.

Li Xian led his horse out of the manor, brushing its mane. He checked his personal luggage: spare clothes, mechanical tools, poisons and hidden weapons, travel money... all were complete. He reviewed it once more in his mind; there were no oversights.

Beside the saddle hung a yellow scabbard. The Sinking River Sword originally had no scabbard; its edge was too sharp, its锐利 (keenness) eye-catching, easily provoking greed. Li Xian had spent money to forge a scabbard for it, completely concealing its锋芒 (edge), allowing him to travel低调 (low-key).

"I am unaware of Lady's past, but judging by your temperament, I fear you have many enemies, far more than one might expect."

Li Xian guessed the road ahead would be perilous and immediately assessed his strength.

Basic Martial Arts: Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, Iron Copper Body, Great Luo Saber Technique, Soaring Cloud Hand;

Lower-tier Martial Arts: Jade Green Palm, Gang Thunder Finger, Vast Mist Leg;

Upper-tier Martial Arts: Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword.

Nineteen martial arts, sixteen reaching their peak, three perfected, accumulating a Qi Lake of forty-nine zhang.

Li Xian's breath condensed, and a dark light trembled. The Iron Copper Body operated without hindrance, his body as solid as iron, his energy as mighty as a dragon.

"Though facing the Dragon Appreciation heroes, my strength is weak. But I have done everything I can. I will do my best and have no regrets."

This journey was long, requiring departure a month early. Even Wen Caishang was equipped with several sets of spare clothes.

Leaving the manor for several miles. A gentle breeze blew, and clothes fluttered.

This journey headed west, bypassing the Prefecture City, taking only remote, forked paths. In four or five days, they left the borders of the Poor Heaven Prefecture, encountering no major troubles along the way.

The Great Wu Dynasty's territory was vast. The Four Great Domains of Southeast, Northwest, and Central were divided into Circuits, which were further divided into Prefectures and Provinces. Some Prefectures and Provinces were of the same level, while others had Prefectures ranking higher.

On the fifth day, they arrived at the "Group Sand Province." Here yellow, yellow,,,, Pref...,, Pref,,,, Eight Heavenures Prefecture.

Li Xian's hunger grew, having eaten dry rations for several days.

He went out to hunt, shooting two wild rabbits and a wild boar.

Suddenly, he saw a guesthouse standing in the distant mountains.

Li Xian was overjoyed and couldn't help but think: "Before, when I saw such inns and guesthouses, I always wondered... set up in such a remote place, how could there be guests? Now that I have personally entered the Jianghu, I understand the hardship. Being able to sleep in a bed is already extremely comfortable. To see this guesthouse in the wilderness is truly wonderful."

Holding the wild rabbits and carrying the wild boar on his shoulder, he informed the Lady. Lady Wen raised her eyes and said, "Alright, let's stay at the guesthouse." She mounted the white horse and headed for the guesthouse.

Li Xian booked two rooms and said to the inn servant, "Could you please boil a basin of hot water and send it to the upper room first? For my Lady to wash."

The inn servant did as asked. After boiling the hot water, he carried it to the upper room. Lady Wen was sweating all over; how could a Jianghu martial artist truly be untainted by dust? She immediately went upstairs to wash.

Li Xian handed the wild rabbits and the wild boar to the innkeeper. He instructed them to use these as ingredients, stir-fry them with salt, scallions, and garlic oil, and make them into side dishes to serve. The remaining wild boar meat was left for the innkeeper.

That night, they ate a hearty meal. The fatigue of several days was completely soothed.

Li Xian pushed open the window. Snowflakes blew into the room. He looked out into the distance, his mood both calm and excited.

They rested for the night.

The next day, they set off again. They passed through the Flower Branch Province, bypassed the Seeing Dragon Prefecture, and crossed the Kunlai Prefecture.

Li Xian witnessed the vastness of the Yu'nan Circuit. Whenever he arrived at a new place, he would purchase geographical maps, study them carefully, and ponder the local terrain.

He was beginning to understand the vastness of the world.

In the middle of the first lunar month.

Dozens of miles from the Old Dragon Pool, there was a town called "Dragon Claw Town."

A river flowed beside the town. The water was clear, and children on both banks played in the water, catching fish and catching crabs... very cheerful.

When tired from playing, they would lean back and float on the water to rest.

The children, who grew up in the town from a young age, were excellent swimmers. Recently, many outsiders had come to Dragon Claw Town, all dressed in Jianghu style. The children playing in the water looked curiously at the passing Jianghu travelers.

Some wore coarse linen clothes and carried giant swords on their backs. Some wore brocade robes, with greying temples. Even more... their appearances looked like monsters, strange and grotesque, terrifying to the extreme. Some had large tumors growing on their heads.

To the north of Dragon Claw Town was a continuous mountain range. It blocked the cold water climate, making the seasons feel like spring. The people of the town knew nothing of the world's affairs, living peacefully and happily.

It was like a paradise.

To have so many outsiders rush in at once was truly overwhelming. Women came to the riverbank, shouting loudly, calling their children back home.

The town was not large, with about forty thousand households. There were not many streets and alleys. The lively places like inns and taverns were all gathered on "Seeking Dragon Street."

The street was four miles long, with ten inns and seven taverns...

All were packed to capacity.

It was truly difficult to find a room or a seat.

The inns and taverns were full. The tea stalls on the side of the street had placed small benches in the middle of the road, making it very difficult to walk. Even so, those who heard the news kept coming one after another.

On the streets, martial artists jostled against each other, and the sounds of pushing, shoving, and cursing could be heard from time to time. Some of these martial artists wore similar attire, clearly belonging to the same sect.

Elders from various sects, heads of martial arts schools, and clan elders of aristocratic families, common sights on the Yu'nan Circuit where heroes gathered.

The most luxurious tavern in the town was called "Observing Truth Tower."

It was seven zhang and eight chi tall, with carved beams and painted rafters, and exquisite decoration. It stood out like a crane among chickens, unique and distinguished.

The tower had one hundred and twenty seats, thirty-four private rooms, and twenty-one guest rooms.

Naturally, they were all full.

The guests inside the tower brought their own tea. They sat firmly in their seats, vigilantly watching their surroundings, while pretending to be nonchalant, slowly sipping their tea.

The Dragon Appreciation Banquet was imminent.

Those who could sit steadily in the tower were all extraordinary people. The guests outside and the late-arriving heroes naturally wanted to secure a seat.

Thus, an unspoken rule had formed. Although the tavern was small, it contained all the fame and fortune disputes of the Jianghu. Those who could occupy a lower seat could look down on those outside. Those who could occupy a middle seat could look down on the lower seats. Those who could occupy a high seat could look down on the middle seats...

Those who could enter the private rooms and enjoy the guest rooms, even when heroes gather, would surely be first-class! Although the crowd was like a wall, they could fight for a pure and quiet place for themselves.

With a "creak" sound.

The ajar door was pushed open, and an old man and a young man walked into the room.

The heroes looked up. The old man wore a kasaya, his head was bald, his face looked like withered wood, and he clasped his hands together, smiling as he said, "This old man passed by here, my leg bones are sore. I want to ask for a cup of tea and a seat. I wonder who would be willing to make way?"

A hero in the tower said, "Before asking for a seat, you must first state your name."

"At your age, you don't even know this rule. You've truly lived in vain."

"Old monk, it's useless to act pitiful here. Quickly show your skills. If you are powerful, not to mention a seat, even a private room would be yours!"

Mocking and sarcastic remarks continued, mixed with laughter. The Jianghu people outside, although unable to secure a seat, were by no means weak. They all cast their gazes over, waiting for a good show.

The old man smiled and said, "This old monk's Dharma name is 'Cibei' (Compassion). Please, that hero, make way." He pointed towards the white-clothed middle-aged man by the window.

The crowd was shocked: "What Cibei Monk, just an old bald donkey. How dare you be so blind? You actually dare to ask the Lord of the Lanyue Manor to make way."

"You should know that although it is a lower seat, it is next to the window, with an excellent position. Even some of the middle seats are hard to compare."

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor was stunned for a moment and looked up. The Cibei Monk, leading a young monk, approached and said, "Please,施主 (benefactor), make way."

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor smiled and said, "I can make way, but if you drink this cup of wine I offer, I will give you my seat." His gaze sharpened, and he splashed the wine from his cup.

This move concealed a powerful martial arts principle. The wine scattered all over the sky, and the air became a steamer of wine mist. Within the mist, a mirage was hidden.

It turned out that this was a set of lower-tier palm techniques, named "Lanyue Palm" (Lanyue Palm). This palm technique was the famous skill of the Lord of the Lanyue Manor, Bi Chunfu. This move was called "Catching the Moon in the Water."

The Cibei Monk's finger glowed with golden light and pointed at the mist. His right hand caught a wine cup, his fingers guiding the wine mist, continuously gathering it back into the cup, turning it back into water.

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor smiled and said, "A petty trick. With your skill, you cannot drink this cup of wine." As he finished speaking, he saw the wine cup tremble violently and cracks actually appeared.

It turned out that the move "Catching the Moon in the Water," although a palm technique, injured people with "sound." Within the wine mist, there was powerful internal Qi, containing subtle sounds that ordinary people could not hear. Only by being close and taking the hit would one know its mystery.

On the path of martial arts, life-and-death battles are indeed important.

But with comprehensive means and a profound foundation, one can handle any situation. No matter what means you use, I can resolve them one by one, and even more, I can impress everyone.

Suddenly, with a "pop" sound, the wine cup shattered into powder. The wine turned back into mist.

The Cibei Monk raised his eyebrows, opened his mouth, and inhaled. The wine mist entered his lungs, its killing power undiminished. It seemed it would tear through his chest and pierce his heart in an instant, a gruesome sight. The Cibei Monk slapped his chest, and a circle of golden light burst out from his body surface.

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor's expression turned ugly: "Good monk, you actually know how to resolve it like this. You are厉害 (capable)!" He snorted lightly and gave up his seat.

The heroes present were confused.

From the middle seats on the second floor, someone analyzed: "This Cibei Monk is a high monk from the Buddhist sect. He practices the Buddhist Brahma Sound Palm. That wine mist, when scattered in the air, is easy to avoid, carries a rhyme, but is extremely difficult to drink. That's why the old monk drank it first, then used the Brahma Sound Palm to strike his body, using sound to counteract sound, to resolve the hidden sound principle of the Lanyue Palm."

"Who are you?! Spouting such nonsense here!" The Lord of the Lanyue Manor was furious. The hidden sound principle in his Lanyue Palm was one of his killing moves. To have it pointed out now was extremely disadvantageous.

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor roared, "Since you are so capable, then I shall go upstairs to ask for a seat."

"No need. Your strength is insufficient. It would be pointless even if you came up." The voice came from above.

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor saw that all the heroes were present. If he backed down now, he would lose all face. He said coldly, "Ignorant youth, prattling about my Lanyue Palm. Hmph, let me show you what is truly powerful." And he went upstairs.

The speaker on the second floor was a middle-aged man. He wore white clothes, was short in stature, but very neat. "The Lanyue Palm is just a clumsy imitation of the martial arts of our Bishui Cave Heaven." He also took a cup of wine and threw it at the Lord of the Lanyue Manor.

But it was completely different. The wine disappeared in the air. When it reappeared, it had already splashed all over the Lord of the Lanyue Manor's body.

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor was furious and was about to make a move. Suddenly, his expression turned to terror. His flesh and skin seemed to be evaporating, dispersing like mist. He had no choice but to sit cross-legged on the spot, seeking a way to counter it.

The expert from Bishui Cave Heaven laughed and said, "Little ball, roll out." He kicked the Lord of the Lanyue Manor.

The Lord of the Lanyue Manor sat cross-legged, concentrating his Qi to stop his flesh and blood from evaporating. He could only let it happen, and indeed, he rolled like a ball.

He rolled all the way to the main entrance.

The crowd of heroes burst into laughter. Just at this moment, the door was pushed open again.

It was a handsome young man who entered first.

"My Lady, please enter."
