# Chapter 61: Hunting Demons

In front of an alchemy shop in the outer city, Lu Xu stepped inside.
After exchanging a few words with the shop assistant, he was led to the disciple of the Second-tier Alchemist.
This alchemy shop was the property of that Second-tier Alchemist, and according to intelligence obtained from the Wind Report Pavilion, his disciple was currently overseeing the place.
“Fellow Daoist wishes to undertake the task issued by my master?” The Second-tier Alchemist’s disciple already knew Lu Xu’s purpose from the assistant.
Looking at the middle-aged man with a full beard, Lu Xu nodded:
“I am also an alchemist, and I’ve encountered a bottleneck in pill refining, so I wish to seek guidance from your esteemed master!”
“Oh, Fellow Daoist is also an alchemist?” The middle-aged man’s face showed great interest.
“Fellow Daoist, do you know when refining the Qi-Nourishing Pill...”
The middle-aged man blurted out some things only alchemists would know. As a High-grade Alchemist, Lu Xu naturally knew these things inside out.
His casual yet incisive remarks immediately made the middle-aged man look at him with new respect.
“I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist to be so proficient in the Dao of alchemy. May I ask for your name?”
“My humble self is Li Li!”
Han Feiyu’s identity was a Talisman Master. Now, acting as an alchemist, Lu Xu naturally had to use a new name.
“Li Li? That name is a bit strange!” The middle-aged man muttered in his heart.
He immediately smiled: “So it’s Brother Li. I already know your intention, Brother Li. This task can be handed to you. However, the place where the Moon Orchid grows has many demonic beasts. Does Brother Li have confidence?”
“No problem at all. I, Li, will invite two Tenth-level Qi Condensation experts to assist, and I will certainly bring the Moon Orchid to Fellow Daoist!” Lu Xu said confidently.
“Good, then I wish Brother Li success!”
After Lu Xu left the alchemy shop, he immediately went to inquire about the location where the Moon Orchid grew.
Not long after, with everything prepared, he left Ten Thousand Immortals City and headed towards the Ten Thousand Demons Mountain Range.
The city gate of Ten Thousand Immortals City facing the Ten Thousand Demons Mountain Range was bustling with people, with countless cultivators entering and exiting.
After all, hunting demons was the most prosperous industry in Ten Thousand Immortals City, and the cultivators here were definitely the most skilled at dealing with demonic beasts in the Eastern Wilderness.
Most cultivators going to hunt demons entered the mountain range in groups, with teams of seven or eight or even dozens of people visible everywhere.
The teams included both Late-stage Qi Condensation experts and weaker cultivators at the third or fourth level of Qi Condensation.
These less powerful cultivators generally engaged in logistical support work or served as cannon fodder to lure demonic beasts.

Naturally, there were also many lone wolves like Lu Xu. These individuals were generally highly skilled and daring.
They were mostly Late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators.
“With so many people going in, I wonder how many will return. It’s said that over a thousand cultivators die in the Ten Thousand Demons Mountain Range every year from Ten Thousand Immortals City!” Lu Xu thought to himself.
In this city, there was no shortage of cultivators who drowned in their pursuit of dreams.
Lu Xu followed behind these demon hunting teams, gradually walking deeper into the mountain range.
Through years of demon hunting, the cultivators of Ten Thousand Immortals City had summarized some relatively safe routes into the mountains.
Entering the Ten Thousand Demons Mountain Range from these places would not encounter overly powerful demonic beasts.
Stepping into the mountain forest, after traveling forty to fifty li, the demon hunting teams ahead gradually dispersed onto various fork paths.
Lu Xu walked for a while, then chose a mountain path that no one else had taken and entered it.
After walking another nearly thirty li, the surrounding mountain forest became increasingly quiet, and a suffocating atmosphere pressed in from all directions.
Lu Xu took out a map and looked at it.
“Almost there. There’s a First-tier Spiritual Vein on the steep mountain peak ahead, inhabited by a group of Scale Apes. Their cave dwelling should have Moon Orchids!”
After cautiously observing the surroundings, Lu Xu began to take out various formation tools from his storage bag.
Small flags and formation plates, each artifact exuding spiritual energy and shimmering with light.
After taking out all the formation tools, Lu Xu placed a previously exchanged mid-grade spirit stone on each of the six formation plates.
Then, he buried these formation plates underground, and then arranged the formation flags according to specific directions.
A moment later, a First-tier High-grade Grand Formation — the Wind-Fire Blazing Array — appeared in this clearing.
Lu Xu held a command flag, and after waving it a few times, the formation gradually became invisible, as if nothing existed in the original spot.
“Next, I need to lure these demonic beasts out!”
With a light tap of his toes, Lu Xu flew towards the steep mountain peak.
“Roar!”
“Roar! Roar!”
In a short while, roars one after another echoed on the mountain peak, followed by booming sounds erupting.
A streak of azure light shot out from the mountain peak, rapidly flying towards the formation.
Behind it, a sky full of massive boulders continuously shot out, smashing towards this azure light.
Amidst the boulders, streaks of dark light also shot out, moving at extreme speed.
These dark lights possessed immense power; once they touched something, they would immediately pierce through it, leaving deep, bottomless pits.

The azure light continuously dodged, clearly wary of these dark lights.
In just a moment, the azure light had moved away from the range of the mountain peak, and the boulders and dark lights flying from behind became sparse.
Faintly, a group of giant apes could be seen pounding their chests and roaring at the top of the mountain peak. They were two to three zhang tall, covered in black scales, and their pair of crimson blood eyes were as deep as two pools of blood.
After launching an ineffective attack on the azure light, these Scale Apes roared for a while and then disappeared from the mountain peak.
They seemed to have returned.
Seeing this, the azure light suddenly turned back and re-entered the mountain peak.
In just a moment, angry roars sounded again. Amidst the deafening booming sounds, the azure light, bringing a group of Scale Apes, rushed over from the mountain peak.
The azure light sped in front, with seven giant apes in hot pursuit behind it.
Their speed was very fast. In just a moment, they arrived at the clearing, and the azure light flashed past the clearing.
The seven giant apes unknowingly followed and rushed in.
When the last of them also rushed into the formation’s range, the azure light stopped.
Lu Xu’s figure emerged from it. A small flag flew out from his sleeve. After holding it and waving it twice, a strong gale suddenly swept across the clearing.
The First-tier High-grade Formation, the Wind-Fire Blazing Array, was activated.
“Two First-tier High-grade, five First-tier Mid-grade. The formation should have no problem trapping them!”
Standing outside the Wind-Fire Blazing Array, watching the scene of the hurricane dancing within, Lu Xu’s face revealed a smile.
He waved the formation flag again, activating changes in the formation.
Within the formation, wide wind blades began to fly out from the hurricanes encircling the Scale Apes.
Blazing flames burned on the wind blades, their momentum extremely fierce, causing people to tremble just by looking at them.
The seven Scale Apes seemed to sense the danger, pounding their chests and emitting angry roars, moving in unison.
Some punched towards the wind blades, while others shot streaks of dark light from their eyes, scattering in all directions.
“Clang! Clang!”
A sound like hammering iron rang out. When the flaming wind blades struck the giant apes, it was as if they had struck bodies of divine iron.
The black scales shimmered with dark light, appearing as if cast from divine iron, giving an unbreakable impression.
“Their defense is truly formidable. No demonic beast should be underestimated!” Lu Xu exclaimed after observing for a moment.
Two First-tier High-grade demonic beasts, equivalent to Late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. In fact, judging from the aura emanating from them, these two were almost equivalent to cultivators at the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation.

The wind blades only left streaks of white marks on their bodies.
The other five were much weaker. After the wind blades struck, they left deep wounds on their bodies.
Seeing this, Lu Xu immediately activated the formation, focusing its power to attack the five First-tier Mid-grade Scale Apes.
The effect was obvious. Under the full suppression of the formation, the five Scale Apes were immediately covered in wounds, and in an instant, one of them fell.
“Roar! Roar!”
Wild and tragic roars sounded. The two most powerful Scale Apes began to charge at the formation, and at the same time, several echoing roars came from the mountain peak.
Amidst booming sounds, three more Scale Apes rushed out.
One First-tier High-grade, two First-tier Mid-grade.
Upon seeing this, Lu Xu quickly activated his magic tool and went to meet them.
