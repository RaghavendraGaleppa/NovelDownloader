# Chapter 308: The Numb Martial Memory

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, his mind immersed in the golden torrent of the Attribute Panel. The massive influx of memories from practicing the *Meridian Cleansing Sutra* was etched into his soul like chisels carving stone.

It was a suffocatingly long thirty years.

In those memories, he sat cross-legged in the Dao Sect’s Cold Jade Cave, his black hair bleaching into white over time, surrounded by mountains of medicinal dregs. Every day at the Yin hour, he used silver needles to stimulate his acupoints and excite his blood. At the Mao hour, he swallowed the "Dragon Blood Marrow Cleansing Pill," enduring the agony of his meridians burning. At the Zi hour, he used the "Ice Soul Condensing Soup" to suppress his boiling internal fire.

Thirty years passed like a single day. Even in sleep, he practiced the *Lin Character Mantra* instead of resting, looking like a tireless puppet. By the age of fifty, his arms were covered in dark purple bruises caused by the bursting of capillaries from forcibly moving his blood qi. The sound of bones grinding constantly echoed in his ears, like two dry sticks scraping against each other. On the seven-thousandth attempt to break through, the face in the mirror, wrinkled and worn, was unrecognizable from the spirited youth of thirty years ago.

Although it was just a memory, Xu Yunfan could clearly feel the bitterness within it. To bring his Bone Marrow Cleansing realm to perfection, he had spent thirty years, using the *Lin Character Mantra* to replace most of his sleeping time. Even so, it still took a full thirty years to complete. It showed just how arduous martial practice was.

In the vast world, among the countless martial artists, how many in the Great Zhou Kingdom could actually break through to the Bone Marrow Cleansing realm?

In this martial memory, he spent twelve years just to make his skin take on a faint golden hue, during which he suffered thirty instances of bleeding from all seven orifices due to medicinal conflicts. To refine his blood to the state of "marrow like frost, blood like gold," he completely exhausted the potency of three thousand-year-old blood ginsengs.

The "him" in the memories wasn't unhardworking. He had worked so hard that he left all the other Dao Sect disciples in the dust. He memorized the three thousand volumes of body-forging scriptures in the Sect’s Scripture Pavilion, mastered the medicinal properties known by the nine peak elders, and even created the "Midnight Noon Impact Method" to accelerate medicinal absorption. But no matter how he racked his brains, the progress of his Bone Marrow Cleansing remained as slow as an old ox pulling a broken cart.

At one point in the memory, he became decadent. After getting drunk one time, he carved on a stone wall: "My talent is like a stubborn stone. Even if watered by ten thousand methods, it will never bloom with enlightenment."

However, this robotic, water-grinding method of reaching the Bone Marrow Cleansing perfection left Xu Yunfan somewhat numb.

Xu Yunfan felt the blood qi surging through his body. A clear sound like jade chimes rang out from deep within his bones. This was the sign that the *Meridian Cleansing Sutra* had reached perfection, and it was also the sign that his bone quality and aptitude had undergone a fundamental change.

Yet, the thirty years of bitter cultivation memories infused by the Attribute Panel lingered in his heart like a bone-deep thorn.

Was his talent and comprehension really that poor?

But none of that mattered anymore...

What mattered was that he had now stepped into the perfection of the Bone Marrow Cleansing realm. His bone quality and aptitude had been altered; he was no longer his former self. If it came to talent, he wouldn't lose to those ordinary geniuses!

He flicked a finger and shattered a nearby stubborn rock. The stone powder shimmered with a golden gloss under the morning sun.

"Only now, with this body, is the true beginning of the martial path!"

After reaching perfection in Bone Marrow Cleansing, he had a vast, open sky ahead of him. With a single step, he left the vast majority of the Dao Sect disciples far behind.

The Meridian Cleansing method of the Maitreya Temple, which altered one's bone quality, truly deserved to be called a theft of heaven's creation. It was pleasantly surprising. At the very least, right now, Xu Yunfan was fully worthy of the title "extraordinary talent."

After returning to his secluded courtyard, Xu Yunfan had just stepped through the gate when he couldn't wait to test out his newly acquired divine weapon to relieve his boredom. Afterward, he would begin practicing the Ten Extremes Martial Way. This martial art was extremely profound. Even with the Attribute Panel, it would take him considerable time to get started and begin tempering his internal organs.

He took down the pair of *Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers* from his waist. He rubbed the ancient cloud patterns on the hammer handles, feeling the immense power contained within, and couldn't help but silently praise them.

"The Dao Sect's foundation is truly unfathomable. They even have the corresponding martial arts for such divine weapons!"

After coming out of the Sword Burial Abyss that day, Bi Yuan sent the young Taoist Qing Song to deliver two volumes of techniques the very next day.

*Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammer Art* and *Sky Piercing Cloud Splitting Bow Art*.

The *Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammer Art* recorded nine styles of overwhelmingly fierce hammer techniques. Each style subtly resonated with the momentum of mountains and earth veins. If practiced to perfection, swinging the twin hammers could trigger earth qi vibrations, with power comparable to landslides and tsunamis.

The *Sky Piercing Cloud Splitting Bow Art* was an extremely rare ranged masterpiece. When the bowstring trembled, the arrow could tear through the sky, and it could even utilize the power of wind and thunder to increase its penetrating force. Legend had it that at its peak, a single arrow could shatter a mountain.

"Senior Brother Xu!"

Qing Song pushed open the courtyard door excitedly, his face filled with undisguised joy. He didn't even notice that the sleeves of his Taoist robe were stained with morning dew. He rushed to Xu Yunfan's side, his eyes shining brightly. "Where did you go,师兄? I looked for you several times this morning, and even Senior Sister Chi Shao at the Medicine Hut said she hadn't seen you!"

Xu Yunfan was weighing the *Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers* in his hands, the hammer heads vibrating and humming constantly. Hearing Qing Song's words, he had to put them down for the moment and turned back with a faint smile. "I went to the peak of Qingwei Mountain at the Yin hour to temper my bones and muscles using the eastward rising purple qi."

He paused his gaze on Qing Song's excited face and raised an eyebrow. "Looking at you like this, did you find a lost alchemy formula in the Scripture Pavilion?"

Qing Song chuckled and leaned in, lowering his voice. "It's more than just good news. If this matter succeeds, my Dao Sect won't have to worry about resources for the next ten years! Perhaps the daily provisions for Senior Brother you can even be raised by a level."

Xu Yunfan's hands holding the iron hammers paused slightly. Although Qing Song was young, he was the most steady Taoist boy under Bi Yuan. For him to lose his composure like this, it must be an extraordinary opportunity.

"Oh?"

Xu Yunfan deliberately dragged out his tone. "It can't be that the Sect Master intends to open the ninth floor of the Langhuan Book Tower to all disciples?"
