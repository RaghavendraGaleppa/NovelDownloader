# Chapter 22: The Might of Divine Light

Finally, Lu Yang understood.

"I can't leave!"

This wasn't because he was moved by Xiao Shiye's recent performance, but because he suddenly realized something chilling.

"After all, why did I come out with Xiao Shiye?"

"I should have gone straight to Zhao Xuhe to get the other half of that third-rank true cultivation technique from my previous life, the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*."

But what happened instead?

He followed Xiao Shiye to the Merit Pool, just out of curiosity? One must remember that the Merit Pool's grand prize could only be drawn once a year, and he had already used his chance this year. There was absolutely no benefit in going to the Merit Pool with Xiao Shiye.

Why would I do something that brings me no benefit? This doesn't make sense!

In an instant, Lu Yang felt as if a basin of cold water had been poured over his head, his limbs chilling to the extreme: "Who is influencing me? Interfering with my thoughts?"

"No, that's not right…"

After understanding this point, Lu Yang suddenly had a flash of insight.

Why did he accompany Xiao Shiye to the Merit Pool? Because Xiao Shiye needed him! Otherwise, Xiao Shiye would now be chased by powerful enemies all alone! But now, he had an external helper in Lu Yang! If Xiao Shiye was the Son of Destiny with overwhelming fortune, then Lu Yang was just that unlucky fellow from stories, meant to serve as a human shield when the Son of Destiny faced danger!

In such a situation, splitting up to escape? That would simply be attracting firepower! Lu Yang was 100% certain that if they split up, the one who would ultimately be caught and killed would be him, while Xiao Shiye would turn danger into safety!

"How insidious!"

Lu Yang let out a deep breath. A Son of Destiny like Xiao Shiye, playing such a trick of shifting misfortune, would undoubtedly ensnare any Saint Sect disciple. Because Saint Sect disciples were not good people. If someone voluntarily offered to cover the rear, any other Saint Sect disciple would be overjoyed, shedding a few crocodile tears before decisively fleeing without hesitation. However, doing so would very likely make them Xiao Shiye's human shield.

Unfortunately for Xiao Shiye, he encountered Lu Yang. Xiao Shiye was certain that there were no good people in the Saint Sect, which was why he devised this plan. But Lu Yang also shared that very same thought.

No good people in the Saint Sect? And you, Xiao Shiye, are the only good person? I don't believe it!

So, no matter how eloquently you speak or how valiantly you act as if ready to die, I'll first assume you're not a good person, then deduce what bad things you're planning! That's right, Lu Yang formed his conclusion first! It was precisely because of this that he wasn't misled by a single leaf obscuring his view, allowing him to examine himself in time and discover the true anomaly. Otherwise, he would have been severely exploited!

Meanwhile, Liu Xin, who had been chasing them all along, also saw Xiao Shiye charging towards him, and Lu Yang standing motionless not far away. He pondered, "Catch the leader first. This Xiao Shiye has a lower cultivation, so he's easier to deal with, but it's safer to deal with Lu Yang first..."

Before Liu Xin could finish his thoughts, a loud bang suddenly erupted.

"Boom!"

The next second, a magnificent sword light tore through the sea of clouds. It didn't flee, but instead, under Xiao Shiye's astonished gaze, it flew directly to his side.

"Brother Xiao, we hit it off at first sight. How could I, Lu, abandon you?"

"Mere scoundrels! What do we have to fear if we work together?" Lu Yang declared with soaring heroic spirit.

Xiao Shiye was dumbfounded. Could it be that he had miscalculated and truly found a good person in the Saint Sect?

"Impossible!" Xiao Shiye instantly regained his composure. He noticed Lu Yang's action of seemingly fighting alongside him, but actually shielding him tightly. His face immediately darkened.

What good person? This is a bad person!

"Brother Lu, it was all a misunderstanding just now." Xiao Shiye said with a wry smile, knowing that Lu Yang had seen through his scheme. He couldn't help but whisper, "Now that things have come to this, why don't we genuinely team up?"

"Team up? Alright," Lu Yang sneered. He then directly threw Xiao Shiye towards the other pursuers, excluding Liu Xin. Xiao Shiye immediately cursed aloud, "Lu, you shameless—"

Liu Xin, watching from afar, burst into laughter. Although he didn't know what had happened between Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye, it clearly looked like they had a dispute. This suited his intentions perfectly, as he had no obligation to accommodate his enemies. If his enemies had problems, he would simply add insult to injury! With this thought, Liu Xin immediately changed his plan and shouted to the others:

"You guys pin down Xiao Shiye, I'll deal with Lu Yang."

After giving his orders, Liu Xin conjured an escape light and shot towards Lu Yang. However, at that moment, he saw Lu Yang suddenly flash a slight smile.

Something was wrong!

The next second, Lu Yang's figure vanished.

Almost simultaneously, a sword light suddenly burst forth from Xiao Shiye, who was already surrounded by others. Lu Yang's figure then stepped out from within the sword light!

Divine Heaven Sword Control True Art! The sword light arrives the moment thought arises!

Liu Xin instantly recalled the conversation between Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye. The talk of 'teaming up' wasn't sarcasm after all, but a tacit understanding! The two had accurately grasped each other's meaning and put on a perfectly synchronized act, successfully deceiving him and creating a perfect strategic opportunity: throwing the poised Lu Yang into a group of unprepared cultivators, the highest of whom were only at the mid-stage of Qi Condensation!

Liu Xin's expression changed dramatically, and he shouted, "Quick, scatter!"

"Too late!" Lu Yang snarled. His sword pellet bloomed like a peacock spreading its tail, but compared to before, the burst of sword light was now dyed a deep crimson.

In an instant, Lu Yang exhaled sharply and cried out, transforming into a blood shadow that merged with the sword pellet. Then, a crimson light curtain, like fire and blood, rose up. The divine light, centered on Lu Yang, swept outwards in all directions, like a prairie fire, blood-staining the land, engulfing everyone in the blink of an eye!

Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light!

Despite it being broad daylight, the cultivators struck by the blood light felt a bone-chilling cold as if plunging into an ice cavern, and then lost consciousness. When the divine light dissipated, apart from the bewildered Xiao Shiye, only empty human skins fluttered down from the sky. As for their flesh and blood, they had been utterly consumed by the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, making the crimson glow on Lu Yang's sword pellet appear even more sinister.

The next second, the sword pellet trembled slightly, and a blood shadow materialized, revealing Lu Yang's form. He looked intently, seeing Liu Xin standing stunned in the distance, as if in a dream. Lu Yang burst out laughing, "Oh, it's you, Senior Brother Liu." Before his words even faded, he flew forward with sword light, slashing!

The grudge from the life before his last, when he was refined into raw material in an instant, still festered. He hadn't forgotten it, and he would avenge that past self! Yesterday's grudge, like a thorn in his side! Today, you have no one but yourself to blame!

Lu Yang charged with his flying sword. Liu Xin, who had just witnessed the might of the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, immediately turned grim and tried to retreat.

"Trying to run?" Lu Yang pursued without hesitation, controlling his sword.

Seeing this, Liu Xin hastily shouted, "Qingchen, lift the restrictions!"

No sooner had he spoken than the illusory mirage that had sealed the surroundings suddenly dispersed. Immediately after, a graceful figure slowly appeared, none other than Immortal Qingchen. The artifact that had just enveloped this cloud sea was her "Nine Palace Mist Concealing Scarf," which contained a Nine Palace Array. It could conceal a world within a mustard seed, trapping heaven and earth and sealing off an area. Its original purpose was to prevent targets from escaping, but it had backfired, inadvertently blocking Liu Xin's escape route.

Seeing Immortal Qingchen appear, Liu Xin finally breathed a sigh of relief. The next second, he flew with an escape light to Immortal Qingchen's side, standing shoulder to shoulder with her, gazing gravely at the pursuing Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye.

The two sides faced each other. After a moment, Liu Xin quietly spoke, "Sigh, can we reconcile?"
