# 第五十六章 关门

Chen斐's expression changed, but he didn't panic. Instead, he had the little boy enter the courtyard and close the gate.

"Do you know where Uncle Chi is now?" Chen斐 asked, sitting opposite the little boy.

"I don't know. Uncle Chi just didn't come to find me today."

The little boy licked the remaining candied fruit from his fingers and said, "Uncle Chi said that if he didn't come to find me one day, I should come and find you and tell you to run quickly."

"Good boy, here's this for you!"

Chen斐 took out a tael of silver. The little boy's eyes widened, and he quickly hid the silver in his arms. After bowing to thank Chen斐, he skipped away.

Inside the courtyard, Chen斐's brow furrowed.

This child was likely a contingency plan left by Chi Defeng to warn Chen斐, and he hadn't expected it to actually be used. The key now was who had captured Chi Defeng.

For the past month, Chen斐 had been quietly cultivating in his house, avoiding conflict with anyone except for occasional outings. Chi Defeng had also kept a low profile, only helping Chen斐 purchase some medicinal herbs.

"Is it still that Shallow Water Gang?"

Chen斐 remembered being targeted by the gang a month ago for selling pills. If there was a suspect, the Shallow Water Gang was the most likely.

But they had already taken the initiative to hide. Was the Shallow Water Gang still pursuing them so relentlessly?

---

"Found it."

The shopkeeper glanced at the note, looked up at Chen斐, and said, "Fifty taels, and the whereabouts of this person will be known to you, sir."

"Alright!"

Chen斐 nodded and took out fifty taels of silver from his pocket, placing it on the counter. The shopkeeper smiled and pocketed the money, handing the note to Chen斐.

Chen斐 opened the note, which had only three words written on it: Shallow Water Gang!

Chen斐's eyes narrowed. He hadn't expected it to really be the Shallow Water Gang. Was it still about the pills from before? Or was there another reason?

"Someone saw your friend being captured by the Shallow Water Gang. He seemed to have been injured."

The shopkeeper leisurely picked up his teacup, took a sip, and said, "If you want to save your friend, we can act as a bridge. But we can't guarantee whether it will be successful or not."

"Do you sell information about the Shallow Water Gang?" Chen斐 didn't respond to the shopkeeper's words.

"Of course. If the price is right, any information can be bought and sold."

"What's the price?"

"Three hundred taels, and you can have specific information about the Shallow Water Gang. We can even include the location where your friend is currently being held," the shopkeeper said with a smile.

"Good!"

---

"Go."

The shopkeeper glanced at the person and nodded in satisfaction.

The person revealed a flattering smile, bowed to the shopkeeper, and then left the shop.

"Another sum of money in the bag."

The shopkeeper couldn't help but smile, leaning comfortably in his chair, picking up his teacup, and drinking the tea in one gulp. Integrity? What was that? Was it as good as money?

The shopkeeper, feeling cheerful, hummed a few tunes and stood up, wanting to relieve himself. Suddenly, a loud shout came from the back hall, but it stopped abruptly a moment later.

The shopkeeper's expression changed slightly, and his nostrils twitched. A bloody smell wafted into his nose.

This time, the shopkeeper's expression really changed. There were several Bone Forging experts in the back hall, but now they were silent.

The shopkeeper was only at the Flesh Refining Realm. How could he dare to stay any longer? Just as he was about to run, he saw a person walking out of the back hall.

"It's you..."

The shopkeeper looked at Chen斐 as if he had seen a ghost.
