Chapter 119: Let's Kill Our Way Back

Inside the gathering place of the Saint Sect disciples.

After meeting with the true disciples, Lü Yang naturally didn't hold back, going straight to the point and revealing the intelligence he had obtained from Guangming.

Chongming's expression turned grave upon hearing it: "Surrounded, you say..."

On the other side, Xu Xin showed no surprise, instead revealing an expression that seemed to say, "I knew it would be like this": "I knew those Netland pigs and Daoist Court dogs had teamed up again."

Chongming was still puzzled: "But why wouldn't father have foreseen such a thing?"

"Perhaps he didn't expect that something so obvious would escape your notice, young master."

"You!"

Xu Xin and Chongming glared at each other again, clearly epitomizing the two major factions within the Saint Sect's true disciples, each looking down on the other.

"The answer is simple: True Monarch Chongguang simply doesn't care. After all, from the very beginning, the key to victory in this Dao-contention war was never with us." At this point, Xu Xin looked back at Lü Yang and respectfully said, "The True Monarch's Dao Fruit treasure, I presume, is also in your hands?"

"Indeed, it is in my hands," Lü Yang nodded, then stated solemnly, "However, there's one thing I must emphasize... I am truly not at the Foundation Establishment stage. While very close, I am still not there."

Even with Su Nü's assistance, Lü Yang still had a gap compared to a true Foundation Establishment cultivator. After all, this was not Skeleton Mountain; Su Nü couldn't receive the ley line's blessing, so her power wasn't at its peak. This slight difference could often lead to a thousand-mile disparity. If a true Foundation Establishment True Person were here, there would be no need for words. They would simply find the enemy's location, charge in, and use a basic attack. No matter how many people there were or how many formations they had set up, it would be futile; a single slap could annihilate them all. However, Lü Yang was different. If the Daoist Court and the Netland Sect truly sacrificed their lives to fill the battlefield, with thousands of Qi Refining cultivators forming formations to trap him, his chances of victory in this battle would plummet instantly.

It would probably fall from a hundred percent to ninety-five percent. In other words, there was a half-percent chance of capsizing... Although this risk wasn't high, Lü Yang wouldn't take even that small risk. Therefore, this was the time when the Saint Sect's excellent resources were needed.

Thinking of this, Lü Yang wasted no more words and stated clearly: "I need you to actively initiate a breakthrough to help me divert their attention."

There were two conditions for victory in the Dao-contention war. The first was to destroy the enemy's Dao Fruit treasure, which was usually in the hands of their strongest cultivator. The second was to kill the Son of Destiny among the natives within the 界天 (Jie Tian/Realm Heaven), seize their Heavenly Count, and then integrate it into the Dao Fruit treasure, thus winning without a fight.

Lü Yang's plan was simple: the other Saint Sect disciples would attract firepower, while he would lie hidden in the dark, seizing the opportunity to directly eliminate one side's strongest cultivator, destroy their Dao Fruit treasure, break out of the encirclement, then recuperate for a period before returning to deal with the other side. The plan was perfect. The only question was how to convince these excellent resources of the Saint Sect to go to their deaths – no, to break out and secure an opportunity for him to decapitate the enemy.

However, what Lü Yang didn't expect was that after hearing his plan, the Saint Sect true disciples present not only didn't resist, but even nodded, revealing expressions of considerable approval.

"True Monarch's insight is truly profound; this is indeed the plan with the highest chance of victory."

"It's much better than us trying it ourselves."

"Then let's do it!"

There was no need for much persuasion; the plan was settled directly. Lü Yang then realized that Saint Sect disciples had long grown accustomed to being treated as "human material" (人材); as long as the final outcome was beneficial to them, they didn't care. Or rather, this was precisely the Saint Sect disciples' way of survival. From the lowest-ranked Qi Refining disciples starting as "human material," to becoming good "human material," then transforming from "human material" into "talent," and finally becoming a true "person."

With the plan decided, they still needed to choose a target for decapitation. On this matter, everyone had no disagreement and unanimously chose the Netland Sect. After all, Lü Yang had already wiped out the [Dragon Host] among the Eight Buddhist Divisions. Dealing with them had a higher chance of success, and as "human material," they would have a greater chance of survival.

Meanwhile, inside the gathering place of the Netland Sect.

"What did you say? Guanghui is dead?"

Looking at the disheveled Guangming, Guanghai's expression was unprecedentedly gloomy. The prayer beads in his hand crackled with crisp sounds, almost crushed by his grip. "Guanghui... he was my dearest friend, my most trusted junior brother! Furthermore, the [Dragon Host] was meticulously selected and painstakingly assembled by me; weren't they all excellent disciples of my [Dragon Subduing Temple]?"

At this point, he gazed at Guangming with a dark look: "Since they are all dead, why are you still alive?"

Facing Guanghai's interrogation, Guangming showed no shame on his face. He even puffed out his chest and declared loudly with righteous indignation: "Because I ran away!"

At these words, Guanghai was shocked by Guangming's shamelessness. Whether in the Saint Sect or the Daoist Court, anyone daring to utter such words would surely be executed on the spot as an example.

Thinking of this, Guanghai immediately lowered his gaze and whispered, "You deserted the battle, did you not consider your fellow disciples?"

Guangming heard the killing intent in Guanghai's words and quickly replied, "Senior Brother, please don't misunderstand. My survival was not for myself, but for us!"

"...Us?" Guanghai's eyebrows suddenly shot up. Guangming's words were very skillful, because "for us" was different from "for the Netland Sect." "For the Netland Sect" would include all Buddhist cultivators, but "for us" was limited to their fellow disciples under their master, those from the [Dragon Subduing Temple]. Thinking of this, the simmering killing intent in Guanghai's heart immediately dissipated, and his originally stern tone softened considerably: "What happened? Tell me in detail."

"Among those who killed Senior Brother Guanghui and all of the [Dragon Host], there was one person who cultivated the Nine Transformations Dragon Arts left behind by our master before his Nirvana!"

"...What!?"

At these words, Guanghai instantly stood up, his expression shifting between dark and bright, before finally revealing a look of ecstasy: "Such a thing actually exists..." As the most trusted disciple of the Arhat of Dragon Subduing, Guanghai was no stranger to the "Nine Transformations Dragon Arts." He knew very well that this was a cultivation technique left behind by the Arhat of Dragon Subduing when he was still True Person Coiled Dragon, having a karmic affinity with the Netland Sect, just waiting for a future opportunity to use this technique to 'fish' for a Dharma Protector Vajra for the [Dragon Subduing Temple].

"If I can subdue him and bring him into the [Dragon Subduing Temple]..." Guanghai's eyes grew brighter. For a monk like him, who had entered an Arhat temple, to advance, he had to obtain a higher position within the temple. And what immense merit would it be for him to secure a Dharma Protector Vajra for the Arhat of Dragon Subduing? If he succeeded, he would undoubtedly become the most trusted disciple under the Arhat of Dragon Subduing, firmly sitting in the second-highest position in the [Dragon Subduing Temple], and his strength would greatly increase. If one day, the Arhat of Dragon Subduing were to encounter another 'accident'... At that time, perhaps it would be his opportunity to ascend to Arhat!

Thinking of this, Guanghai's heart immediately burned with fervor, and his gaze towards Guangming also became much friendlier: "Junior Brother is intelligent; you did well this time."

Guangming finally let out a sigh of relief: "Thank you for your magnanimity, Senior Brother!" Only then did he wipe the fine sweat from his forehead, knowing he had survived again. He then looked at the restriction Lü Yang had placed in his sea of consciousness. With this restriction, he dared not reveal any information about Lü Yang's strength. However, it was clear that the cultivation technique was not within the scope of this restriction. That devil must have calculated everything, but surely he wouldn't have known that I would recognize the "Nine Transformations Dragon Arts," right?

"Counting the days, Guangming should have told his senior brother about the cultivation technique by now?"

Lü Yang opened his eyes, calculated with his fingers, then smiled: "With that, when I kill my way over, they should fight me to the death."

Immediately, he stood up, turned around, and looked at the Saint Sect resources behind him. Two of the seven true disciples were dead, and four of the eleven Perfected Qi Refining cultivators were also dead. Of the hundred-plus late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, only seventy or eighty remained, and all were wounded.

"Everyone, didn't it feel bad being chased earlier?" He wasn't good at boosting morale. Moreover, this time he needed them to attract firepower; too many high-sounding words would only create a rebellious mindset. So in the end, Lü Yang simply waved his hand decisively:

"Let's kill our way back."
