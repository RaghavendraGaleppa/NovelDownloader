# Chapter 17: Assassination

"Hmm?" The man showed a trace of confusion before shaking his head and turning to enter the small building.

"Although soul cultivation lacks offensive power in its early stages, its formless, traceless concealment and unique properties far surpass martial arts," thought Qin Ziling. Seeing that the man had detected nothing, he suddenly realized his current state—a wandering spirit invisible to mortal eyes. He couldn't help but chuckle silently while feeling secretly pleased with himself.

With this in mind, Qin Ziling's soul drifted toward the small building. There was something unusual about its aura—an eerie, sinister quality with faint tendrils of bloody energy rising and coiling around it.

Inside one of the building's rooms stood a furnace with flames roaring beneath it. A young attendant fanned the fire while another stood behind a Daoist priest. The priest sat cross-legged by the furnace, dressed in white robes with three blood-red lotus patterns embroidered on the sleeves. His refined features, adorned with a long beard, gave him an air of transcendent grace despite his apparent age of forty to fifty. In his hand was a horsetail whisk, and beside him sat a bronze basin filled with a thick, crimson liquid of unknown origin.

The priest observed the furnace's flames, occasionally dipping his whisk into the basin and flicking it, sending a red streak arcing through the air into the furnace.

"Master Immortal, how goes the progress of the Nine Revolutions Blood Marrow Bone-Forging Elixir?" the man asked as he entered, clasping his hands in greeting.

"All proceeds smoothly," the priest replied without rising, his tone detached. "Only the essence blood of three more exotic beasts remains—one must be a second-grade Blood-Striped Foxbear, while the other two need only be untamed. The higher their grade, the better the elixir's quality and success rate."

"Leave the beasts to me—I'll arrange for them promptly. But the refinement process requires your utmost attention," the man said, a glint of satisfaction flashing in his eyes.

"Of course. However, the process is taxing, and my injuries remain unhealed. At critical moments, I may falter. Thus, Castle Lord Xu must provide six yang-born boys and six yin-born girls to aid my recovery," the priest said calmly.

"As long as you succeed in refining the elixir, Castle Lord Xu Pengkun will deliver not just six, but ten or even a hundred children if needed!" the man declared.

"Castle Lord Xu is truly a man of decisive action," the priest remarked with a slight bow.

Outside the window, Qin Ziling's soul trembled with fury upon hearing their exchange. Were it not for the formidable strength of the priest and the castle lord—and his own current limitation of barely controlling a needle—he would have stormed in to slay these monstrous, bloodthirsty fiends.

As his rage intensified, the priest suddenly turned toward the window, his piercing gaze seeming to detect something. Qin Ziling recoiled and swiftly withdrew, not daring to linger. Though the priest's vitality seemed weaker than the castle lord's, his eyes had felt unnervingly perceptive.

"Who are these men? Their senses are alarmingly sharp," Qin Ziling mused as he retreated. "Even though the soul is invisible, true experts can still sense its presence." This realization underscored that while soul cultivation granted mysterious abilities, assassinating true masters would not be easy—unless they possessed countermeasures against soul techniques. Otherwise, a soul cultivator at the Material-Drive Stage could haunt their targets with relentless, ghostly precision.

After leaving the building, Qin Ziling avoided further risks. His soul had barely reached the Material-Drive Stage, and prolonged separation from his frail physical body would hasten its decline. Moreover, the castle lord and the sinister priest's heightened awareness had put him on guard.

Navigating through walls and alleys, Qin Ziling eventually found Xu Yuanbiao in a modest, outlying courtyard in the southern district—far humbler than the grand estates nearby. The man who strutted like nobility outside was merely a marginal figure within the Xu family, relegated to this remote corner.

Retrieving the needle hidden in a tree, Qin Ziling returned to Xu Yuanbiao's bedroom. Floating above the snoring man, he felt none of the vengeful satisfaction he might have expected. Instead, his gaze was cold and detached, as if observing a corpse.

A glint of steel flashed through the air, accompanied by a chilling breeze. The needle pierced Xu Yuanbiao's temple.

"Ah—!" A bloodcurdling scream shattered the night's silence. Xu Yuanbiao bolted upright, clutching his bleeding temple—only for another needle strike to pierce his chest, spraying foul-smelling blood across the bed.

As Xu Yuanbiao writhed on the floor, his wounds rapidly blackened and festered. The Four-Headed Bird's venom worked faster than Qin Ziling had anticipated—especially targeting vital areas like the brain and heart.

Soon, hurried footsteps approached. With a final icy glance at the dying man, Qin Ziling retrieved the needle and departed. As he left, his gaze lingered on the distant alchemy building, filled with murderous intent.
