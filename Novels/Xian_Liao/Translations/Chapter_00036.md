# Chapter 36: Wind and Snow

The essence of the Five Animal Frolics lay in capturing the spirit of each creature—the tiger's ferocity, the deer's serenity, the bear's steadfastness, the ape's agility, and the bird's nimbleness.

After mastering the Bear Frolic basics, Zhou Qing found its cultivation increasingly difficult even with the aid of Blood Qi Pills. He now understood that the Five Animal Frolics taught by his university professor had undergone a mysterious transformation in this world under the influence of his "Everlasting Health" system.

From Tiger and Deer to Bear Frolic, his body was undergoing slow yet profound changes. His current condition resembled an expanding vessel—his growing capacity made his existing blood qi seem insufficient. By ordinary standards, his blood qi would already be considered abundant.

This phenomenon wasn't noticeable during Tiger and Deer Frolic practice, but became increasingly apparent with Bear Frolic. The initial stages had been like walking up gentle slopes, but Bear Frolic felt like ascending the steep, mist-shrouded paths of Shangqing Temple—treacherous and obscure.

The physical transformations from earlier stages became more pronounced with Bear Frolic, especially after achieving basic proficiency. Drawing from his experience breaking through the limits of his Finger Flick technique, Zhou Qing suspected higher realms existed beyond mastery of the Five Animal Frolics.

However, neither Tiger nor Deer Frolic showed signs of breakthrough potential. Interestingly, his Everlasting Health system still rated his overall Five Animal Frolics as "Basic Proficiency" despite mastery in two forms, because Ape and Bird Frolics remained undeveloped. He theorized complete mastery of all five forms might be necessary for further advancement.

Achieving full mastery before the provincial exams seemed impossible. Bear Frolic's challenges grew increasingly formidable, though not insurmountable with Blood Qi Pills—just requiring greater effort and perseverance.

Ten days later, Zhou Qing rubbed iron sand between his fingers, surveying the battered wooden dummies. Neither the sand nor dummies provided meaningful training value anymore. His gaze fell upon the massive mulberry tree in the courtyard.

Having fully digested the monk's remains and absorbed medicinal residues Zhou Qing regularly provided, the tree's bark had become iron-hard.

"Brother Mulberry, my apologies," Zhou Qing addressed the tree respectfully. He decided it would make an ideal training partner. Since his Finger Flick technique breakthrough, their interactions had diminished, raising concerns about potential alienation if the tree developed sentience.

"Let's progress together," Zhou Qing declared, slamming his shoulder against the trunk, sending leaves shaking. As he regulated his breathing—using Tiger-Crane energy and the natural heat from Bear Frolic to heal minor bruises—he visualized himself as a northern grizzly. Through repeated impacts, he honed his technique, gradually embodying the bear's essence.

The rooster, Wangri, watched with growing awe, seeing in Zhou Qing a model of demonic beast cultivation.

A month later, Zhou Qing sat calmly beneath the mulberry tree, his broadened shoulders and steady demeanor radiating reliability. His Everlasting Health system displayed:

Five Animal Frolics (Basic):
- Tiger (Mastered)
- Deer (Mastered)
- Bear (Proficient)
- Bird (Basic)
- Ape (Basic)

Martial Arts:
- Tiger-Crane Form (Mastered)
- Ghost Step (Proficient) + Breeze Talisman Canon (Mastered)
- Finger Flick (Limit Broken)

Special Skills:
- Revival Talisman Canon (Beginner)
- Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary): Blood Qi Pills
- Literary Courage (Elementary), with faintly glowing script
- Remaining Lifespan: 65 years

Bear Frolic neared mastery, hindered only by insufficient Blood Qi Pills. The form had dramatically enhanced his digestion and physique. Clenching his fist, blood qi surged, enlarging and reddening his hand. A seated punch produced a clear tiger's roar.

"Bear Frolic has strengthened my blood qi and physique, boosting my Tiger-Crane Form's power," Zhou Qing mused.

Approaching a wooden dummy, he executed a lightning-fast kick that cleanly severed its head—demonstrating his focused training on Ghost Step. He'd postponed Bird Frolic to conserve resources, realizing his single five-leaf ginseng couldn't support simultaneous advancement in both forms.

"Ghost Step feels ready for mastery, yet remains stuck at proficient," Zhou Qing puzzled. Unlike his Tiger-Crane breakthrough which required shattered Literary Courage to fuse energies, Ghost Step seemed to lack some essential "spirit." Identifying this missing component became crucial for pre-exam preparation.

"Time to consult Senior Brother Fusong," Zhou Qing decided, needing expert assessment. He also hoped to secure Fusong's escort to Changzhou for the exams. Despite Fusong's jovial appearance, Zhou Qing sensed formidable depth beneath—unlike the aged martial artist Lin Tai whose prime had passed.

Mounting the icy winter path to Shangqing Temple, Zhou Qing found Fusong practicing Taiyue True Form Talismans on a cliffside. After demonstrating Ghost Step, Fusong nodded appreciatively.

"This 'Ghost Step' lives up to its name—unpredictable as a specter. To advance further requires cultivating its 'spirit'," Fusong explained. "Not through reckless danger, but focused concentration—the Daoist art of 'Stealing Heaven's Secrets'."

When Zhou Qing requested escort, Fusong initially declined on philosophical grounds—until offered a 1000-strings donation for temple upkeep. "Between fellow Daoists, mutual aid is essential," Fusong promptly agreed, insisting on written confirmation.

Descending through falling snow, Zhou Qing reflected that while Fusong's help was welcome, true security lay in self-reliance. The key to mastering Ghost Step—focused concentration—aligned perfectly with his scholarly training.

"Through the storm we go," Zhou Qing murmured into the wind, his gaze steady against life's gathering blizzard.
