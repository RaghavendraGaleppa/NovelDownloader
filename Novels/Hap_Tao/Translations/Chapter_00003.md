# Chapter 3: The Corpse-Nurturing Ring

The ring appeared simple and unadorned, but Qin Ziling knew it was the most precious item possessed by Li Mo, the sect master of the Corpse Demon Sect—the Corpse-Nurturing Ring.

This ring, along with his severed finger, had fallen into the ancient well. It was deliberately left behind when Li Mo self-destructed to escape with a wisp of his remnant soul, intending to retrieve it later. Even though his remnant soul ultimately failed in its possession attempt and was instead fused with Qin Ziling from another world, this scene was deeply imprinted in Qin Ziling's consciousness. For several nights in a row, he had the same nightmare.

"When refining this Corpse-Nurturing Ring, Li Mo not only used the most common blood sacrifice method but also later imprinted it with a higher-level spiritual mark. Even if someone else took the ring, they wouldn't be able to open it with blood sacrifice. But since I've fused with Li Mo's remnant consciousness, perhaps I can open it using the blood sacrifice method," Qin Ziling thought to himself. He bit his finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the ring.

The blood seeped into the ring and disappeared. At the same time, an even stronger sense of connection surged through Qin Ziling's heart. Then, his mind wavered, and his body shuddered as he suddenly found himself "inside" a space the size of a football field, nearly a hundred meters high, filled with thick, ink-black clouds of chilling, sinister energy and a pervasive aura of decay.

Yet, Qin Ziling knew clearly that his physical body remained in place—his eyes could still see the surrounding landscape, the ancient well, and the temple.

"This is incredible. It's like a virtual space I can enter through consciousness alone, yet it's undeniably real," Qin Ziling marveled inwardly as he began surveying the vast space.

Within this enormous area, not only were there swirling masses of dark, icy energy, but there were also twelve coffins of varying sizes placed on the ground. 

The coffins were covered in strange, intricate runes that pulsed with an eerie glow. Each flicker of the runes absorbed a wisp of the drifting Yin-tainted energy.

Nine of the twelve coffins were empty, while the remaining three each held a corpse.

Two of the corpses resembled apes but were far larger than ordinary ones, standing about three meters tall. Their entire bodies gleamed with a cold, bronze-like sheen, giving the impression of being forged from unyielding metal.

The third coffin contained a massive, four-headed bird, its body also radiating the same metallic luster, though its wings were tattered and broken.

Each corpse was inscribed with runes that resonated with those on the coffins. As the runes flickered, the dark energy gathered by the coffin's inscriptions seeped into the corpses, making it seem as though the bodies were breathing in their slumber.

Not only that, but as the dark energy continuously merged with the runes on the corpses, their metallic glow grew purer. Even the broken wings of the four-headed bird showed faint signs of regeneration.

When Qin Ziling "looked" at the three corpses, they seemed to sense his presence. Suddenly, they rose from their coffins, their hollow eyes locking onto him with flickering green flames.

The sight was indescribably eerie, sending chills down one's spine.

Strangely, Qin Ziling felt no fear at the sight of these awakened corpses. Instead, he felt a deep connection and even a strange sense of familiarity with them—along with a faint, bloodthirsty impulse.

This bloodlust didn't originate from his own mind but from the three zombies.

"This…" Qin Ziling swallowed hard, struggling to recall the fragmented memories and knowledge left behind by Li Mo's remnant soul after their fusion.

"Zombies, like martial arts, have ranks. The lowest are Black Corpses, followed by Iron Corpses, Bronze Corpses, Silver Corpses, and Golden Corpses. There are others, but I can't recall them right now. A remnant soul is just that—scattered and chaotic. But it's fortunate it was only a remnant. If it had been a complete soul, I might not have been able to retain my own consciousness!"

"Bronze Corpses possess combat power comparable to martial artists at the Jinli (Force) level. The martial hall master is only at that level, yet he's already considered a renowned and respected expert in the city. If I can control these three zombies, it would be like having three Jinli-level martial artists under my command?" As Qin Ziling pieced together the information, he felt both shock and excitement, his heart pounding.

"It seems the other zombies in this ring were Silver or Golden Corpses, all released by Li Mo during his desperate escape to fend off his pursuers. Just how powerful was Li Mo? And what about those chasing him? These three Bronze Corpses weren't even deemed worthy of being sent out to help."

"The strong in this world are far beyond what I imagined. I must stay low and improve my strength as quickly as possible. If I ever encounter someone like Li Mo, I wouldn't even know how I died." The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he became, a creeping dread settling over him.

Thinking of improving his strength, Qin Ziling turned his attention back to the three Bronze Corpses with renewed fervor.

For now, these three zombies were peerless experts to him.

If he could control them, it would be like having three Jinli-level warriors at his disposal. Not only would his safety in this chaotic world be temporarily secured, but his lack of food and medicinal resources could also be resolved.

The question was—how could he control them?

Qin Ziling fell into deep thought again.

His mind flashed to images of black-robed figures shaking bells or banners while forming hand seals to command zombies.

Inspired, he searched the space but found no bells or banners. Instead, in the corner of one of the empty coffins, he spotted a small chest.

When he saw it, a sharp pain shot through his head, as if he had forgotten something crucial—but he couldn't recall what.

Not wanting to strain his mind further, he opened the chest.

Inside lay a palm-sized triangular token of unknown material and a scroll of scripture.

The token triggered no memories, but when he saw the scripture, his heart jolted. He quickly unrolled it.

The scripture was incredibly thin, densely packed with text. In its center was a diagram of a starry river.

At first glance, the diagram seemed ordinary, but upon closer inspection, it expanded infinitely, as if transforming into the vast, boundless universe—making him feel smaller than a speck of dust.

Countless stars and celestial bodies moved in harmony, converging into an eternal, mighty river.
