# Chapter 214: The Flawless Body  

"Junior Brother, it seems in a few years, we'll be relying on you for our cultivation elixirs!" Senior Sister Ye Jingxian said cheerfully, looking at Li Shiming.  

Though Li Shiming was only an intermediate alchemist and would need to advance to a senior alchemist to refine pills for mid to late-stage Foundation Building cultivators, his alchemical talent was extraordinary. Even if they had to wait a few more years, the prospect of obtaining higher-quality elixirs in the future filled her with joy.  

"You flatter me, Senior Sister. Once I advance to a senior alchemist, I will surely refine elixirs for you and our two senior brothers!" Li Shiming replied with a smile.  

Second Senior Brother Wan Zheng and Third Senior Brother Lu Shi both looked pleasantly surprised. Their junior brother's alchemical talent was remarkable, and their already close relationship would only grow stronger.  

"Greetings, Master!" At that moment, Elder Su appeared in the pavilion, and the disciples quickly bowed in respect.  

"Good. None of you have neglected your cultivation recently, especially Shiming. It seems your alchemy studies haven't hindered your progress, which puts my mind at ease," Elder Su said with a nod, scanning his disciples.  

Li Shiming's talent was considered poor, and as a new disciple, he was Elder Su's primary focus. Initially concerned that alchemy might impede Li Shiming's cultivation, Elder Su was now relieved to see his spiritual energy fluctuations had significantly increased. Moreover, there was no trace of pill residue, indicating Li Shiming had relied solely on his own efforts without resorting to elixirs—a testament to the efficacy of top-grade pills, which left no residual energy once absorbed.  

"Jingxian, you should enter seclusion soon," Elder Su turned to Ye Jingxian and instructed.  

"Master, my insights are insufficient. Seclusion won't help me break through the bottleneck," Ye Jingxian replied hesitantly.  

Li Shiming was aware of her situation. As a half-step Golden Core cultivator, she was on the verge of forming her Golden Core. However, this final step was as difficult as crossing an abyss. Beyond reaching the peak in physique, spiritual energy, and mental strength, it required tempering her Dao heart and comprehending the will of heaven—a deeply personal and ineffable process.  

The best approach was for her to continuously experiment, using various methods to stimulate enlightenment. Previously, she had tried Li Shiming's monkey wine to disrupt her body's equilibrium, hoping to elevate her physique and spark insight. Seclusion, however, was ineffective since her bottleneck wasn't related to spiritual energy accumulation.  

"Your situation is unique. If the sect goes to war with the demonic cultivators, a half-step Golden Core like you may face Golden Core opponents. It's best you enter seclusion early," Elder Su explained.  

"Master, are the demonic sects preparing for war with the righteous path?" Ye Jingxian asked in alarm.  

"It won't happen immediately, but the demonic sects have been active lately. The righteous sects are making preparations," Elder Su confirmed.  

He wasn't overly concerned about his other disciples—each had life-saving treasures ensuring high survival rates in battle. However, Ye Jingxian was different. In wars between righteous and demonic factions, higher-realm cultivators generally refrained from attacking those below them—except for half-step Golden Core cultivators, who were considered threats due to their potential to advance and their overwhelming power in the Foundation Building stage.  

"Shiming, as a newly minted intermediate alchemist, won't be sent to the frontlines. But Chuan, you're too reckless—be cautious in battle!" Elder Su continued, handing each disciple a talisman. "These are 'Ten-Thousand-Mile Escape Talismans' for emergencies."  

Li Shiming accepted the talisman, recognizing the privileges of being a Golden Core elder's disciple. Ordinary cultivators could only dream of such treasures.  

The news of a potential war between the righteous and demonic factions weighed on Li Shiming. Though he wouldn't be fighting, his other identity—Li Yuanba of the Senluo Sect—was a combat cultivator. He wondered if the Senluo Sect would participate, given its status as one of the major demonic sects of Northern Shu.  

Returning to Swordholding Peak, Li Shiming resumed his routine of alchemy and cultivation. The sect's atmosphere grew tense as pill exchanges surged.  

Ye Jingxian heeded Elder Su's advice and entered seclusion, publicly declaring her intent to comprehend the Golden Core's heavenly will.  

From Yin Shilan, Li Shiming learned the Illusory Mirage Sect, an ally of the Shu Mountain Sect, was also preparing for war. Yin Shilan, as a formation master, wouldn't face direct danger.  

Days passed in deceptive calm, beneath which undercurrents of tension swirled.  

A year later, Li Shiming's spiritual lake was nearly filled with liquid five-element spiritual energy, marking his approach to the peak of early Foundation Building. Soon, he would attempt to break through to mid-stage.  

His cultivation speed even surpassed that of Li Yuanba, a Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivator in the Senluo Sect, thanks to daily top-grade elixirs.  

But the most significant change was his physique. Over a year of unbroken practice of "Purple Qi from the East"—enhanced by Fresnel reflectors—had transformed his body. His skin was flawless, his pores nearly invisible, resembling an infant's.  

His muscles, tempered by "Diamond Body Protection Art" and "Sword Demon Secret Codex," were now supple yet powerful, showing no signs of body-refining techniques. His bones had turned jade-like, except for his right thumb's sword bone, which now carried a violet-tinged sword intent with thunderstrike effects—likely a fusion with his "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art."  

This unique sword intent, nurtured by violet qi, was exclusive to him and couldn't be shared with Li Yuanba.  

His bones' jade-like hardness, combined with his body-refining progress, surpassed late-stage Foundation Building standards. The violet qi had erased all hidden injuries from battles and cultivation, leaving his physique flawless—akin to the legendary Flawless Body.  

His cultivation speed now rivaled that of Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivators even without elixirs. His spirit had grown fivefold, aided by the "Soul-Nurturing Jade" but primarily due to "Purple Qi from the East."  

Now, he decided to begin cultivating "Thousand Hammers Tempering Spirit Art," having waited months to avoid suspicion. To conceal his drastic changes, he had Li Yuanba acquire the "Demon Shadow Buddha Form Technique," a Senluo Sect art for concealing one's essence, requiring two thousand contribution points as a core disciple.  

Li Shiming suspected his physique was evolving into the mythical Flawless Body. His skin could repel spirit weapon strikes, and his raw strength allowed him to shatter late-stage Foundation Building defensive formations with sheer force.  

Outwardly a spellcaster, he was now a humanoid behemoth capable of overwhelming late-stage opponents in close combat—all thanks to "Purple Qi from the East" and his ingenuity.  

No other cultivator could replicate his gains. Without Fresnel reflectors, the technique's effects would diminish over a hundred years of daily practice—an impractical commitment for most, who couldn't afford to sacrifice decades solely for physique enhancement.  

Thus, while "Purple Qi from the East" was known, none pursued it as Li Shiming had, preferring faster, more tangible methods like body-refining arts, elixirs, or natural treasures.
