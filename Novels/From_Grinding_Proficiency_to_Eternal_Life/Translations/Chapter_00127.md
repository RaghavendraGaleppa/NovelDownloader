# Chapter 127: Intentions

Xu Yunfan leaned back slightly to widen his field of vision and saw a young woman standing over two meters tall. Her muscles were knotted and bulging, and despite the looseness of her clothes, the constantly pulsing veins beneath her garments were clearly visible due to her tense muscles.

A nervous aura seemed to rush toward him.

Why is she so nervous?

Puzzled, Xu Yunfan nodded slightly in greeting.

Watching Xu Yunfan walk past, Yan Yuwei let out a silent sigh of relief. It seemed he wasn't coming to cause trouble for her. After all, she had been gossiping about him behind his back every day, so naturally, she felt guilty facing the person involved directly.

Before she could fully relax, Xu Yunfan's nostrils flared slightly. The girl carried a scent of forged iron sand mixed with red copper powder—the unique body-refining medicinal fragrance exclusive to the true disciples of the Melting Gold Hall.

Having spent a lot of time in the Scripture Pavilion, he had encountered many disciples from the Melting Gold Hall and was very familiar with this scent.

He suddenly stopped in his tracks, realizing that the burly, tiger-backed girl before him was likely the chief disciple of the Melting Gold Hall, Yan Yuwei.

Xu Yunfan turned around and abruptly placed a hand on her shoulder.

"Ah!!"

Yan Yuwei's scalp tingled. Her shoulder blades suddenly bulged into two mounds of flesh, and the loose disciple robe, strained by the surge of blood and qi and her swelling muscles, became as tight as a second skin.

*I'm done for! I'm done for! I'm done for!*

She felt her muscles vibrating, yet the hand on her shoulder remained motionless, showing no signs of budging at all. Yan Yuwei felt almost despairing.

Her move of shrugging her shoulders and sinking her elbow had once snapped an elm-iron wood rod. Now, with her strength surging forward, it was like mud entering the sea, not even raising a single ripple.

Inside the Heavenly Work Cave, fighting among fellow disciples was forbidden. She wouldn't die, at worst she'd just get beaten up. What was there to be afraid of?!

Yan Yuwei steeled her heart just as she heard Xu Yunfan's voice, deliberately lowered to a forced pitch.

"Senior Sister Yan?"

Yan Yuwei turned her head, forcing a smile onto her face that looked even worse than crying.

"Call me Junior Sister, please. Senior Brother Xu, is there something you need?"

Xu Yunfan smiled faintly and didn't argue over the form of address.

"Has Junior Sister Yan ever tried the Drunken Immortal Sashimi from Cuibo Tower?"

As he turned, he deliberately crushed three blue bricks underfoot. In the autumn wind, the brick powder gathered into a small green dragon. "I've heard that the rainbow trout spirit fish, brought back by the autumn tides, has tail patterns finer than the thousand-fold forged steel from the Melting Gold Hall. The taste is exquisite."

Watching Xu Yunfan's display of force with his feet, Yan Yuwei's pupils trembled slightly, and the flesh lumps on her shoulders relaxed.

"I... I've naturally heard of it."

Delighted by her response, Xu Yunfan said, "That's wonderful! My master said that the nine peaks and six halls of our Heavenly Work Cave are as close as brothers and hands, so we should naturally get closer. I've basically been burying myself in hard training every day and haven't had a chance to visit the other halls. It's rare to run into you today. Come on, come on, let me treat you to a meal at Cuibo Tower to enhance our relationship."

Yan Yuwei was stunned for a moment, then an expression of disbelief appeared on her face.

"Haha, Senior Brother Xu, you're joking."

Her throat bobbed with a sound like an iron pellet falling into a bag as she squeezed out a few words. "Recently, my master went underground to find a rare piece of precious iron. I have to guard the Melting Heart Furnace for him these days. Otherwise, if it affects the steel refining, it might slow down the progress of the Forging Hall. You know, Senior Brother, when the Armory was opened not long ago, not only did the major sects in Cangzhou place orders, but sects from other prefectures in Yanbei Dao also put down deposits. So..."

"Guard the furnace?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly formed a sword finger and swiped past a stone pillar beside him. The pillar instantly showed seven spiral patterns. This was the Seven Star Coil Stone Seal of the Melting Gold Forging Technique, essentially used to extract a rare ore from the rock layer without damaging it.

In the Melting Gold Hall, it was commonly known as the Coil Finger Softness. If a finger were to press onto a person, it would pierce through their skull as easily as poking tofu.

This scene made Yan Yuwei's heart pound. She hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to have also cultivated techniques from the Melting Gold Hall.

The hairs on the back of Yan Yuwei's neck stood on end. She could see clearly that Xu Yunfan had clearly not cultivated the Melting Gold Forging Technique. He was purely relying on his finger strength to trace out the Coil Finger Softness's force application.

This was a blatant threat!

Xu Yunfan withdrew his finger, his face filled with a smile. "Rest assured, Junior Sister Yan. I can still say a word or two in the Forging Hall. This matter won't be a delay. Come on, come on, don't refuse. This is the first time I've invited a lady to a meal."

Xu Yunfan was also helpless. After the True Disciple Ceremony, he hadn't seen a single chief disciple from the nine peaks and six halls of the Heavenly Work Cave. It was obvious they were avoiding him.

If he didn't apply a little force, they would definitely not agree.

Yan Yuwei wanted to refuse, but facing Xu Yunfan's deep, smiling, and earnest gaze, she opened her mouth and stammered, "Then... I'll have to trouble you, Senior Brother."

A smile immediately spread across Xu Yunfan's face.

"Great! It's still early, let's go now."

"Ah, right now?"

"What's wrong?"

"Um, right now is... fine."

Under Xu Yunfan's urging, although Yan Yuwei was reluctant, she still went to the mountain gate to fetch two scaled horses. They set off from Heavenly Work City, heading towards Cuibo City, the prefecture city.

***

On the smoke and rain tower at the Sparrow Bridge.

Mo Shisan was fiddling with a piece of armor on the table, using a wrench to turn a gear, which sparked with friction. He was incessantly arguing with the chief disciple of the Heavenly Work Hall about the power transmission method of the core furnace for the humanoid mechanized armor.

The dragon scale mortise and tenon joint in his hand suddenly jammed in mid-air. Two figures passed by the window, figures he was extremely familiar with, yet who should never, ever be together.

"Brother Mo, you said this tiger-crouch style air valve should be embedded in the Tanzhong acupoint?"

The chief disciple of the Heavenly Work Hall picked up the humming purple copper furnace from inside the mannequin's chest cavity and suddenly noticed that the quenching oil in the other's hand was dripping onto his boot.

"Hey! Your oil can... What are you looking at?!"

The chief disciple of the Heavenly Work Hall followed his gaze and immediately saw Yan Yuwei's tightly绷紧 (tensed) back muscles as she rode her horse, stretching the disciple robe made of sky-silk taut.

He then subconsciously glanced at the figure beside Yan Yuwei, and his relaxed and carefree expression suddenly froze.

The purple copper furnace in his hand suddenly cracked with a "咔嚓" sound; he had unconsciously used the force of the Camel Mountain Strength.

The two men's voices abruptly stopped, staring blankly at the two rapidly receding figures outside the window.

Xu Yunfan carried a fine steel iron box on his back, which he never left without, so they recognized him at a glance.

"Brother Mo, did you think of some key point?"

After a long while, the chief disciple of the Heavenly Work Hall murmured.

"That's not it..."

Mo Shisan shook his head, just rubbing his eyes to confirm again: "I just felt like I saw a ghost."

"So Xu Yunfan likes this type..."

The chief disciple of the Heavenly Work Hall stroked his chin.

"Truly, extraordinary people do extraordinary things. I am sincerely convinced."

Mo Shisan: "..."

***

In less than the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Xu Yunfan and Yan Yuwei had left Heavenly Work City together. Both were formidable martial artists, so they spurred their horses and galloped towards Cuibo City.

And at the edge of a town that had spontaneously formed near Heavenly Work City, a pair of eyes, shimmering with a strange light, quietly watched the backs of the two as they quickly departed.
