# Chapter 8: Guarding the Tree for Three Years, She Hatched Seven Nests of Eggs  

Li Zhengjing arrived at the pavilion under the cover of night. This time, he opened the wooden box, unsealed a jar of strong liquor, and hung it up.  

Following the detailed instructions from the golden page, he placed the remaining jars of liquor in the pavilion and left without looking back.  

Normally, after hanging the liquor, he would return directly to his residence. But this time, he only walked a thousand steps before stopping and sitting down against a tree.  

In another half-hour, he would turn back—and then he would obtain the Five Elements Creation Tree!  

*"Why does this feel so absurd?"* Li Zhengjing couldn't help but grumble inwardly. The previous two nights, he had hung the liquor and left immediately. Tonight, sitting in the cold wind, he felt both nervous and uneasy. *"If I can get the Five Elements Creation Tree, what’s a little cold wind?"*  

What he didn’t know was that precisely because he hadn’t returned to his residence as usual, the sixty-year-old Elder Lin was also panting in the cold wind outside his dwelling, cursing inwardly.  

*"A seventeen-year-old brat, always out at night, utterly shameless! Such a disgrace to the immortal sect—this delinquent truly deserves to die!"*  

Elder Lin consoled himself, thinking, *"Fine. As long as Li Zhengjing dies, what’s a little cold wind?"*  

Meanwhile, less than a quarter-hour after Li Zhengjing left the pavilion, a streak of white light cut through the night sky and landed on the pavilion—none other than the white bird.  

*"Why so much liquor tonight?"*  

The white bird thought, *"Though there shouldn’t be any traps within the immortal sect, the sages say one must always be wary. I can’t drink all twelve jars..."*  

With that in mind, it plunged headfirst into the hanging jar, thinking, *"Just a few sips. If I ignore the rest, I won’t fall into his trap."*  

After three gulps, it lifted its head, panting, and found the liquor unsatisfying. It ended up draining the entire jar.  

As it emerged from the jar, about to fly away, it spotted the full box of liquor jars on the ground and hesitated.  

*"Such fine liquor left to waste—what a shame!"*  

*"The sages say diligence and frugality are virtues. How can we squander such treasures?"*  

*"Besides, this liquor came here naturally—it must be spiritual!"*  

*"The books say unclaimed treasures belong to the virtuous! Spiritual objects belong to the worthy!"*  

The white bird’s vision blurred as it thought, *"I’m eight years old, studied for three years, and am both virtuous and talented. This spiritual liquor is rightfully mine!"*  

Drunk and emboldened, it hesitated no longer. Spreading its wings, it grabbed all twelve jars with its talons and flew toward its origin.  

*"They say heaven tests a man before great responsibility—hardships temper the will and strengthen the body."*  

*"This liquor must be testing my resolve, intoxicating my body. Soon, great responsibility will be mine!"*  

The white bird was overjoyed, thinking, *"This is heaven’s trial for me!"*  

Clutching the box of liquor jars, it flew back to the valley, where a red glow shone in the distance.  

The source of the glow was a small tree, no taller than five feet, with five branches swaying in the night wind.  

One of the branches shimmered with a crimson light, illuminating the valley. Wherever the red light touched, the surrounding vegetation withered as if scorched.  

The entire valley was barren—except for this single tree, brimming with vitality!  

*"Oh no! Junior Brother Lin is here!"*  

The white bird spotted a figure approaching the valley with swift, fluid steps. Panicked, it thought, *"I can’t let him catch me abandoning my post!"*  

It quickly flew higher, afraid of being seen, then circled halfway around and landed at the back of the valley.  

After hiding the twelve jars of liquor in the nearby weeds, it finally relaxed and flew forward, perching atop the Five Elements Creation Tree.  

*"Junior Brother Lin, what brings you here?"*  

The white-robed young man stopped and glared at the bird on the tree, his expression furious.  

*"You were tasked with guarding the Five Elements Creation Tree. How dare you abandon your post?"*  

The white bird bristled, flustered. *"How dare you slander me? I’ve guarded this tree for three years without leaving once! This is defamation! You’re defaming me!"*  

The young man, surnamed Lin, scoffed. *"Thanks to your grandfather’s teachings, my cultivation has improved. I saw you flying just now. Still lying?"*  

The bird’s voice grew quieter. *"I just... went to the latrine to relieve myself."*  

*"You’re a bird. Birds don’t use latrines."*  

The bird froze, then snapped, *"What’s wrong with birds using latrines? Are you looking down on us? My grandfather is a bird too—aren’t you learning from him? The sages say all beings are equal. How dare you disrespect me?"*  

*"Enough nonsense! I can smell the liquor on you!"*  

The young man flicked his sleeve angrily. *"The Five Elements Creation Tree is a treasure of our sect. Every six years, it undergoes a transformation—now in the element of fire."*  

*"I cultivate the Heavenly Flame Immolation Art. If I can meditate under this tree during these six years, absorbing its fire essence, my progress will double!"*  

*"Out of respect for your grandfather, I yielded this opportunity to you, letting you strengthen your Fire Spirit abilities!"*  

*"For three years, you’ve guarded the tree, but the official record still lists me as its keeper."*  

*"You’ve abandoned your post repeatedly, wasting this chance. If anything happens to the tree, I’ll be held accountable too!"*  

His voice grew colder. *"Look at you—eight years old, no longer a fledgling. Can’t you behave?"*  

The bird hung its head, muttering, *"I only left tonight..."*  

*"You think I don’t know? This isn’t the first time!"*  

Cornered, the bird weakly raised a wing, three feathers extended. *"Only three times... just these three nights."*  

*"Still lying to my face?"*  

The young man’s rage flared. *"Before guarding this tree, you spent every day grooming the white crane in the forbidden mountains! Everyone knew!"*  

The bird retorted, *"What does that have to do with abandoning my post? That was before I came here!"*  

*"In the three years you’ve been here, she’s hatched seven nests of eggs!"*  

The young man sneered. *"Still claiming you never left? If you truly guarded this tree day and night, are those eggs mine?"*  

The bird stood frozen on the tree, swaying.  

*"Tonight, I caught you red-handed. No more excuses!"*  

The young man turned to leave, declaring, *"Tomorrow, I’ll report this to Elder Bai. From now on, I’ll guard the tree myself!"*  

The bird muttered dazedly, *"Disgraceful... shameless..."*  

Suddenly, it let out a wail, tears streaming down.  

Where its tears fell, the earth turned scorched, as if burned.  

*"That bastard... that bastard..."*  

Overwhelmed with grief, it screeched—  

**BOOM!**  

In its anguish, it spat out flames, lighting up the night sky!  

The fire spread wildly, igniting the twelve hidden jars of liquor.  

**BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!**  

The jars exploded, flames roaring across the valley!  

*"Oh no! Disaster!"*  

The bird, still drunk and distraught, panicked and fled without a second thought.  

The fire raged toward the Five Elements Creation Tree.  

The once-cold night wind turned scorching, rustling the leaves—almost like words.  

*"Disaster... disaster..."*  

The tree’s rustling grew furious. *"That damned bird fled instead of putting out the fire! It’s trying to burn me alive!"*  

With a **CRACK**, the tree’s five branches stretched down like arms, lifting its roots from the ground.  

The tree—now standing six feet tall—sprinted away on its roots, escaping the inferno!  

Meanwhile, the young man surnamed Lin, who had just left the valley, sensed the disturbance and turned back, horrified.  

*"You wretch!"*  

He stomped the ground, unleashing a surge of energy that blasted a three-foot crater—  

**BOOM!**  

—and propelled him a hundred feet into the air!  

Nearby enforcers rushed toward the flames.  

Back at the pavilion, Li Zhengjing, who had returned after half an hour, stared at the distant wildfire in confusion.  

As a disciple, he should help extinguish it—but the golden page’s instructions told him to stay put.  

*"If I wait here, I’ll really get the Five Elements Creation Tree? Is this some kind of joke?"*  

Just then, he spotted a figure darting up the pavilion steps.  

Upon closer look, his eyes widened.  

The figure was gaunt, with five arms and hundreds of legs—running impossibly fast.  

It was a tree.  

*"The Five Elements Creation Tree?"*  

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing lunged forward, pulling out a large sack and throwing it over the tree.  

*"Who dares ambush Lord Tree?"* The sack writhed, its voice muffled.  

*"It’s sentient?!"*  

Panicked, Li Zhengjing punched the sack a dozen times until it stopped moving, then hoisted it onto his shoulder and fled.  

Behind him, the wildfire gradually died down.  

The young man surnamed Lin and the enforcers stared at the charred valley, their faces grim.
