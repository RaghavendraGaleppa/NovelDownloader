# Chapter 31: Sword Cutting

"Six months is too long."

Chen Daoxuan shook his head.

Looking at the silent Chen Beiwang, he pondered for a moment before saying, "Never mind, I'll go take a look at your stone processing workshop later."

"As you wish, Young Patriarch."

Hearing this, Chen Beiwang visibly relaxed.

After finishing his instructions to Chen Yuanchao, who was responsible for constructing the family's public buildings, Chen Daoxuan turned his attention to Chen Liangyu, the former supervisor of the copper mine.

Noticing Chen Daoxuan's gaze, Chen Liangyu put on an ingratiating smile.

"Supervisor Chen, how is the mine doing now?"

At the mention of mine affairs, Chen Liangyu's smiling face fell.

With a slightly complaining tone, he reported, "Young Patriarch, all operations at the mine have been suspended, and the workers have all gone home to rest. Oh, and all the extracted copper ore has been stored in the warehouse. I've been personally overseeing its security this whole time—everything is perfectly safe."

After listening, Chen Daoxuan nodded noncommittally.

This was Shuanghu Island, inhabited entirely by members of the Chen Clan. Moreover, since copper ore was only useful to cultivators, ordinary clansmen wouldn't dream of stealing it. Still, Chen Liangyu's dedication to guarding the mine even during its closure was commendable.

His expression softened slightly. "Supervisor Chen, you've worked hard during this time."

Chen Liangyu immediately feigned humility. "Everything for the family. I don't deserve your praise, Young Patriarch."

After a brief pause, Chen Daoxuan continued, "Here's what I'll do—I'm assigning you a new task. If you perform well, it could be just as rewarding as your position at the copper mine."

Chen Daoxuan had already discerned Chen Liangyu's thoughts and smiled. "What do you think?"

The prospect of a new assignment nearly made Chen Liangyu jump for joy. Suppressing his excitement, he replied shakily, "Chen Liangyu is willing to go through fire and water for the family, without hesitation!"

"No need for fire and water," Chen Daoxuan chuckled, waving his hand before turning serious. "I want you to select a group of young men aged sixteen to eighteen from the clan—they must be literate and quick-witted. Start with fifteen individuals. Have them gather at the family's Earthfire Chamber tomorrow morning."

"Understood!"

Chen Liangyu bowed excitedly.

After seeing Chen Liangyu off, Chen Daoxuan turned to Chen Beiwang, who had been waiting. "Let's go. We'll visit the stone processing workshop first."

"As you wish, Young Patriarch."

### Changping County, Stone Processing Workshop

As the only stone processing workshop in Changping County, it produced three types of stone bricks: red stone bricks, white stone bricks, and the highest-quality blue stone bricks.

Along the way, Chen Beiwang, the veteran craftsman, explained, "This is the family's stone workshop. Every household in Changping County gets their bricks from here."

The workshop covered only a few hundred square meters, with a mere dozen or so laborers sweating profusely over their work—yet the efficiency was shockingly low.

Chen Beiwang continued, "The raw stone is quarried by miners from the mountains and then processed here into finished bricks." He picked up a finished blue brick from a basket beside the workers and handed it to Chen Daoxuan. "Young Patriarch, take a look."

The blue brick was about seven inches long, three inches wide, and two inches thick. Its surface had a faint jade-like sheen, making it resemble polished stone rather than ordinary rock—this was the finest brick the Chen Clan could produce.

Compared to ancient Earth, the Chen Clan of Shuanghu Island seemed unfamiliar with fired clay bricks. Of course, this was largely due to the abundance of natural resources in the cultivation world. With endless supplies of stone and timber, fired bricks were simply unnecessary—stone was both aesthetically pleasing and practical, making clay bricks redundant.

Seeing the workers' painstakingly slow pace, Chen Daoxuan finally understood why constructing a single factory building would take half a year. It wasn't the builders who were slow—it was the raw material supply that was lacking.

After a moment's thought, he asked, "Can the quarry keep up with the demand for raw stone?"

Chen Beiwang hesitated before nodding vigorously. "Yes! The quarry work is just manual labor—it's easy to find workers."

At least there was some good news.

Chen Daoxuan ordered, "You have half a day. Go find Chen Zhi and have him organize clansmen to transport all the raw stone from the quarry back here."

Though unsure of the young patriarch's intentions, Chen Beiwang dared not disobey.

Soon, Chen Zhi—who had been conducting a clan census—received the new directive. Without delay, he mobilized workers to transport stone from the quarry.

Fortunately, most of Shuanghu Island's commoners were martial artists of the Mortal Realm. By afternoon, over three thousand cubic meters of raw stone had been hauled back to the workshop courtyard.

### Afternoon, Workshop Courtyard

A crowd of clansmen gathered outside the courtyard, all temporary laborers recruited by Chen Zhi. None knew what the young patriarch had planned.

Inside the courtyard, Chen Daoxuan surveyed the mountain of blue stone and sighed inwardly—another round of manual labor.

Drawing a breath of true qi from his dantian, he lifted the massive stone blocks into the air with his energy.

In the next instant, the Crimson Shadow Flying Sword shot out from his storage pouch, its blade gleaming.

*Swish! Swish! Swish!*

Sword light flashed across the courtyard.

In the blink of an eye, a massive cubic-meter block of stone had been sliced into neat, uniform bricks.

"This—"

The onlookers gaped in disbelief. Though they knew cultivators were powerful, this godlike display surpassed their wildest imaginations.

Under Chen Daoxuan's flying sword, the pile of raw stone dwindled rapidly while the stack of bricks grew.

By the end of the afternoon, all three thousand cubic meters of stone had been processed into flawless blue bricks—by one man alone.

*Gulp!*

Chen Beiwang swallowed hard.

Now he understood why the Chen Clan's leadership could only belong to cultivators, not mortals.

With all the clan's stonemasons working day and night, processing this much material would have taken months. Yet the young patriarch had finished it in just three hours.

Such divine power was beyond mortal comprehension.

From that moment, Chen Beiwang's reverence for Chen Daoxuan deepened.
