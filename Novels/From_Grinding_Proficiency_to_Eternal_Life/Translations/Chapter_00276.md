# Chapter 276: You Are a Great Talent, Rivaling the Sages of Antiquity

"Disciple pays respects to Master!"

Not far away, Elder Zhou’s face paled drastically. He immediately dropped to his knees, his forehead striking the blue jade tiles with a heavy thud.

Behind him, the six black-robed disciples trembled even more violently, prostrating themselves fully on the ground. They held their breath, not daring to let out even a trace of blood Qi. The Northern Dipper Sword Formation, which had just been soaring with sword intent, now dared not reveal the slightest fluctulation of energy.

Bi Yuan didn't even lift his eyelids, casually waving his sleeve.

A violent gale rose instantly. Elder Zhou and his disciples were lifted by an invisible force, flying backward ten zhangs through the air.

When they landed, they were as light as feathers, not a speck of dust on their robes.

"Thank you, Master, for your mercy!"

Elder Zhou’s voice trembled as he led his disciples in a retreat, backing out of the great hall.

Only after the bronze doors slammed shut did he dare to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly from the side, the muscles beneath his dragon scale armor tensing slightly.

The hierarchy within the Clear Weeping Mountain was even stricter than that of the Sword Pavilion.

Elder Zhou was at least a Bone Marrow Refining expert capable of stirring Golden Marrow, yet before Bi Yuan, he was as卑微 as an ant.

What was even more chilling was that when Bi Yuan waved his sleeve, Xu Yunfan clearly saw purple lightning flickering at the elder's fingertips. The Patriarch of the Dao Sect practiced the Purple Thunder Thunderbolt Art. It was said that this technique could summon lightning to temper the body. Judging by Bi Yuan's level, he had likely reached the legendary realm of "Thunder Transformation of Fine Hairs"!

The teapot tilted again, and the second stream of tea transformed into the image of a galaxy hanging upside down.

Xu Yunfan noticed that every drop of tea shimmered with fine starlight, filling him with amazement.

Xu Yunfan could see clearly that this tea actually contained the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. If an ordinary martial artist were to drink this tea, their meridians would likely explode and kill them on the spot.

"Taste it."

Thunderlight flickered in Bi Yuan's eyes. "Since your劲力 (force) has already entered the marrow, you should know that the Star Marrow in this tea can help your Jade Bone Golden Sound advance a step further."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate. If Bi Yuan wanted to harm him, there was no need to go to such lengths given his strength.

Xu Yunfan picked up the teacup, the skin beneath his dragon scale armor suddenly tensing.

The moment the tea entered his mouth, his spinal column—the Great Dragon—shuddered violently, and a clear sword chant rang out from his Marrow Sea.

Xu Yunfan felt a scorching stream of stars pour from his throat deep into his flesh and blood. His spinal column shuddered violently as if struck by lightning.

The dormant Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Force in his Marrow Sea churned spontaneously, blending with the Star Marrow in the tea. Even the sword intent nurtured within his Triple Burner Meridians was stirred, resonating with a clear sword chant within the meridians.

Sitting opposite him, Bi Yuan heard the trace of sword intent emanating from Xu Yunfan's body. A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, vanishing in an instant.

He maintained a calm expression and took a sip of tea.

Xu Yunfan had no time to pay attention to the outside world. What shocked him even more was that the flesh and blood covered by the dragon scale armor was transforming at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Originally, the bone marrow flowed like mercury, but now, specks of golden light appeared within it. Each drop contained the pure Yang internal energy that would usually require a month of bitter cultivation in the Pure Yang One Qi Art to condense.

These golden lights traveled through his blood. Wherever they passed, even the thousand-tempered Steel Forged Body was suffused with a jade-like luster.

"What excellent Jade Liquid Tea!"

Xu Yunfan was secretly astonished.

In less than the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, the cycle of the Pure Yang One Qi Art had already spun thirty-six times on its own, increasing his internal energy by more than thirty percent.

If he were to execute the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Technique now, he could likely use the sword intent nurtured by the Triple Burner Sword Nurturing Art three more times without exhausting his strength.

Seeing Xu Yunfan raise his head, Bi Yuan looked at him with a smile, his undisguised admiration evident.

"I didn't expect to see someone like you in this era."

"Someone like me?"

"In the past, Maitreya Shakya attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, fasting for seven days and seven nights, ultimately realizing the supreme enlightenment."

Bi Yuan gently stroked the teacup, his reflection showing a face full of emotion. "Two thousand years ago, Li Qinglian, the founder of the Sword Pavilion, used his three-foot green blade to cleave through the natural barriers of the Shu Road. His sword intent spanned thirty thousand miles, and his sword light chilled the nineteen states. Though this may be an exaggeration, it does not diminish his supreme brilliance."

"Furthermore, the Great Zhou's founding ancestor, Li Xuanyuan, mined the copper of Shoushan to cast the Nine Cauldrons to suppress the mountains and rivers. On the day the cauldrons were completed, dragon roars echoed throughout the eight wildernesses and six directions. He used the cauldrons to suppress the land, refined outer demons, and later rode a dragon chariot to break through the void and ascend."

"Once, in the Northern Wastes, there was a Demon Cult. Its Holy Maiden, Lian Hongling, used the 'Scorching Heaven Art' at the age of sixteen to melt the snow of Mount Tianshan. The fire phoenix blazed for a hundred days without extinguishing."

As the tea mist rose, Bi Yuan's gaze was like lightning. "Which of these dazzling geniuses was not an existence that changed the world?"

He stared intently at Xu Yunfan, looking at him with increasing satisfaction, and suddenly spoke.

"I have already invited your master, Zhan Yan, to the Dao Sect. If nothing goes wrong, he should be on his way."

Xu Yunfan's expression changed drastically. His spinal column—the Great Dragon—tensed instantly like a drawn bow. The dormant Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Force in his Marrow Sea erupted violently.

Red-gold light burst forth from the gaps between the dragon scale armor plates. Fine, blood-red patterns appeared where the armor fused with his flesh—this was the state achieved when the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Force was pushed to its limit!

"What do you mean by this, Sect Master Bi?"

The words squeezed from between his teeth carried the grating sound of metal grinding. The condensed sword intent in his Triple Burner Meridians moved on its own, forming a visible light golden vortex around his body.

The internal energy of the Pure Yang One Qi Art boiled like magma, surging out through his pores. Under the combined effect with the Red Serpent Force, faint red锋芒 (sharp edges) appeared around his body.

Seeing this scene, Bi Yuan showed no worry, instead smiling slightly. He raised his hand and pressed it down虚按 (made a pressing motion in the air).

"No need to worry. This is a good thing, a good thing! Don't damage the blue jade tiles under your feet. It took this old Dao quite a few days to restore them to a fraction of their former glory."

The moment Bi Yuan made the pressing motion, Xu Yunfan suddenly sensed something strange. The red sharp edges circulating around him dissipated silently, like snow meeting a blazing sun!

That seemingly casual movement actually contained the profound use of the Ninth Realm of Qi Training and the manipulation of true energy to draw upon the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

This old Dao's strength was a great deal higher than Bi Sheng's. Could he have reached the pinnacle of the Ninth Realm of Qi Training?!

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. The boiling Pure Yang internal energy in his body suddenly stagnated, and even the sword intent wandering through his Triple Burner Meridians felt as if it were stuck in a quagmire.

What was even more terrifying was that the red-gold light on the dragon scale armor plates was being forcibly suppressed back into the depths of the armor by an invisible force. The blood-red patterns where the armor fused with his flesh faded away inch by inch.

After hearing Bi Yuan's words, Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and his expression returned to normal.

"I wonder what this good thing is?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan's demeanor, Bi Yuan laughed. "My Dao Sect values harmony above all else. If we can avoid conflict, we naturally will. The reason for the commotion last night was that we placed a large order with your Heavenly Work Cave. Your master came to the Dao Sect to confirm the final details."

Xu Yunfan's expression relaxed slightly. He understood that Bi Yuan was intentionally being friendly.

After a pause, Bi Yuan continued, "Although your bone structure is average, your comprehension is world-shattering, surpassing even the sages of antiquity. It is truly a waste to remain in the Heavenly Work Cave. When your master arrives, my Dao Sect will bring this up to him."

At this point, a smile appeared on Bi Yuan's face. "I believe your master will certainly not refuse. Even if he is unwilling to change allegiances, he naturally won't object to you coming to the Dao Sect to cultivate."

Xu Yunfan was caught between laughter and tears. After all these twists and turns, it was still about him.
