# Chapter 632: Thirteen Strands of Immortal Golden Essence

Since the coordinates of this界天 (World Realm) were provided by Ye Xuan, it was difficult to be certain that they wouldn't be discovered by a Golden Core True Lord from the Taihua Lingxu Realm.

Especially Qingyuan True Lord.

Now that a grudge had been formed, considering Qingyuan True Lord's past deeds, he undoubtedly possessed a vengeful nature. To prevent the other party from finding this place, Xu Yunfan naturally would not proceed slowly and leisurely.

Cultivators contend for every moment; opportunities vanish in the blink of an eye. If not seized firmly, one's entire Dao path might collapse.

For the next period of time, Xu Yunfan dared not show the slightest negligence. He transformed into a Hunter of the Night, his figure merging with the shadows of the Aeterra World Realm, constantly patrolling everywhere.

Initially, Xu Yunfan naturally would not target large prey, focusing mostly on weak gods hiding in remote towns, like Dyllis.

The major pantheons of Aeterra were already deeply entrenched; acting recklessly could easily bring trouble upon himself. Now was not the time.

His targets were those gods wandering outside the三大神系 (Three Great Divine Systems), possessing various strange divine authority.

These gods were weak, and because they were unwilling to be bound by the三大神系 (Three Great Divine Systems) and loved freedom, most of them sought out gaps and blank territories where the三大神系 (Three Great Divine Systems) did not reach to spread their faith.

Based on the information sifted from the intelligence Dyllis had fully divulged after being disciplined and thoroughly converted dozens of times,

Xu Yunfan naturally locked his targets on those gods who were also at the bottom of the divine hierarchy—those with weak authority, few believers, and far from the centers of powerful divine systems.

Aeterra, the Wild Western Plains. The terrain here was rugged, and countries were relatively isolated from one another, mostly surrounded by mountains.

To call it a kingdom would be more accurate to call it a village or a castle. These places were basically territories developed by landless nobles on their own, evolving over hundreds or even thousands of years.

A god guarding a barren mountain hollow and a few thin fields,所谓的 (所谓的) God of Bountiful Harvests, whose divine statue was merely a few stones casually piled up by the mountain folk.

Xu Yunfan appeared like a ghost before the crude altar. Before the stunned Mountain God could fully凝聚 (condense) his divine power, a faint Shining Sky Finger Force had already pierced through his hastily deployed divine barrier, accurately刺入 (stabbing into) his divine core.

Soul searching,剥离 (剥离) Golden Essence, refining the divine core, sending it into the Star Spirit Banner...

The process was as熟练 (skilled) as if it had been practiced a thousand times.

A brand new,没有任何属性 (attribute-less) strand of Immortal Golden Essence was抽出 (pulled out). Under Xu Yunfan's refinement, its foreign marks were剔除 (removed), turning into pure, attribute-less Golden Essence, and finally融入 (merged into) his own Dao Foundation.

The divine core transformed into a wisp of nourishment for the Star Spirit Banner.

A Ripple and Breeze Water God dwelling in an unnamed small lake. Her domain was merely a lake surface of a few miles, and her believers were occasional passing fishermen.

As long as the fishermen prayed devoutly and offered tribute, they would收获 (harvest) fish.

Xu Yunfan directly used the Star Spirit Banner to展开 (展开) his domain, forcibly severing her connection with her meager faith power.

The weak Water God, deprived of her power source, had no power to resist under the suppression of the Star Spirit Banner's dark light. Her divine core was剥离 (剥离), and her Golden Essence was抽出 (抽出).

Her struggle was like a small stone thrown into a lake, vanishing without a trace after stirring up a tiny ripple.

An ancient tree spirit附着 (attached) to an ancient橡树 (oak tree),懵懂初生 (born in confusion). It had just condensed a divine spark and had not even fully formed a formal divine core.

Xu Yunfan didn't even need to use powerful spells. Relying solely on the capturing power of the Star Spirit Banner, he pulled this fragile spiritual origin, along with that wisp of thin Golden Essence prototype, into the banner.

The spirit rapidly transformed into the lowest-level Star Spirit within the banner, while that wisp of Golden Essence was thoroughly refined and absorbed under Xu Yunfan's guidance.

In the following days, Xu Yunfan did not rest for a moment.

He utilized the surrounding information obtained from Dyllis's memories, combined with his own powerful spiritual sense scan, specifically targeting those weak, isolated gods who could barely protect themselves.

Avoiding the attention of powerful gods or divine systems was the primary principle. Every hunt was力求 (strived) to end before the target could issue an effective alarm.

The dark light of the Star Spirit Banner became the final destination for these weak gods; their struggles and wails were firmly imprisoned within the small world inside the banner.

"It's hard to imagine that things like these are called gods. The gods of your Aeterra are really cheap."

Xu Yunfan held a branch in his hand,微微摇头 (shaking his head slightly).

This was taken from a Forest God in a forest. Its true form was a towering tree, and its vital essence凝聚 (condensed) into a branch.

Its true strength was barely enough to match a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator.

And its attack methods were single and crude to the point of being appalling.

To become a god, most were lucky ones who received the blessing of Aeterra's Dao to obtain a divine core.

Their lifespan was even limited to a thousand years. If there was no improvement, death would be迎接 (迎接) them.

Dyllis's cheeks flushed red upon hearing this,辩解 (辩解)道: "The Wild Western Plains have scarce vitality. Basically, no powerful gods take a fancy to it, so it naturally became a乐园 (paradise) for these kinds of gods."

Xu Yunfan was naturally delighted by this. Anyway, for him, as long as there was a divine core, he could naturally harvest Immortal Golden Essence. It was truly easy and pleasant work.

For the good-looking ones with decent strength and some potential talent, Xu Yunfan threw them all into the Star Spirit Banner. After being教化 (enlightened) by the banner, they became Banner Spirits.

After连续 (consecutive)出手 (moves), Xu Yunfan was like a reaper sweeping through a wheat field, harvesting row by row.

By now, fourteen strands of pure Immortal Golden Essence had been successfully剥离 (剥离) and refined.

Of course, not every剥离 (剥离) was perfect.

While refining a weak divine existence controlling shadow stealth, the other party detonated part of its divine core origin at the last moment. This caused a violent vibration in the core Golden Essence structure, and the过于狂暴 (overly violent) energy went out of control and消散 (dissipated) a strand during the剥离 (剥离) process.

Another time, while hunting a Sleeper guarding an ancient tomb, the god's divine core core was缠绕 (entwined) with a trace of难以祛除 (hard to remove) death resentment. Because most of the worshippers were cultists, even the pure Immortal Golden Essence was tainted with a trace of ominousness.

Xu Yunfan权衡 (weighed) the situation. To avoid this resentment polluting his own Dao Foundation, he果断 (resolutely) abandoned extracting the Golden Essence from it, directly refining and scattering the divine core along with a strand of Golden Essence, turning them into pure faith power to supplement the Star Spirit Banner.

Even so,扣除 (deducting) these two losses, Xu Yunfan's Dao Foundation core already steadily悬浮 (hovered) thirteen strands of incredibly condensed紫金色 (purple-gold) threads,散发着 (emitting) an eternal and immortal aura.

Thirteen strands of Immortal Golden Essence belonging to him.

This number far exceeded the minimum standard of nine strands required for Foundation Establishment perfection.

He could clearly feel that his proto-heaven, supported by these Golden Essence skeletons, had become more stable, its boundaries clearer. The internal thunder star points operated even more smoothly, carrying a kind of harmonious rhythm.

Although his法力 (mana) did not暴增 (surge), its purity and circulation speed, as well as his comprehension and契合度 (compatibility) with the生灭法理 (principles of life and death) contained in the Shining Sky True Scripture, had all提升 (risen) to a brand new level.
