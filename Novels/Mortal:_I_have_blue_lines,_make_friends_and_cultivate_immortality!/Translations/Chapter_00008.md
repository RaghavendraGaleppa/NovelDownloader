# Chapter 8: One Hundred Sky Thunder Pearls!

At the Tai Nan Small Gathering, a man and a woman arrived.

The man was handsome and tall, while the woman was strikingly beautiful. Though lovely, her face was cold and aloof, exuding an air of detachment. A male cultivator beside her tried to get closer, but the next moment, he felt a cold sensation against his neck.

"If you value your life, keep your distance!" the female cultivator said icily.

"Junior Sister Chen, must you be like this?" The man's eyes flashed with resentment and anger, but he quickly masked it. "Our union was arranged by both our families."

"That's their business, not mine," Junior Sister Chen retorted coldly before sheathing her sword and walking away alone.

She had no choice in the face of her unchangeable fate. 

She wished she weren't a member of the Chen family so she could live freely. Instead, she was trapped in this gilded cage once more. Born into the Chen family, she had no say in her destiny—she ate their food, drank their water, and used their cultivation resources. Disobeying the family would bring consequences she couldn't bear.

"Damn that arrogant woman! Once we're in the Yellow Maple Valley, I'll make sure she pays!" Lu Yunfeng seethed inwardly, furious at her haughty attitude. 

For now, he had to endure. His cultivation was slightly weaker than hers, and her flying sword was a top-tier magical artifact. The Azure Dragon Banner his Lu family had commissioned for him hadn't arrived yet, so he was no match for her at the moment.

A few years ago, Junior Sister Chen hadn't been like this—her temperament and cultivation level were entirely different. But after being away on a mission for over a year, she returned completely changed. Her cultivation had soared, and her personality had hardened. 

Lu Yunfeng later learned from the Chen family that during her mission, she had been ambushed by rogue cultivators and was on the brink of death when a wandering cultivator saved her. Over time, she developed feelings for him. However, the Chen family forcibly brought her back by threatening the wanderer's life.

Enraged by this news, Lu Yunfeng vowed to teach that wandering cultivator a lesson if they ever met—and to make Chen Qiaoqian pay for rejecting him, a genius with wind spiritual roots, in favor of a nobody.

*No taste. No gratitude. She’ll regret this sooner or later!*

Their heated exchange was witnessed by a bewitching female cultivator in pink robes passing by.

"Isn't that Chen Qiaoqian from the Chen family?" 

Recognizing Junior Sister Chen, the pink-robed cultivator's face twisted with resentment. Though they had never met, she despised Chen Qiaoqian. 

A few years ago, Chen Qiaoqian had been an unknown, but suddenly her cultivation skyrocketed, earning her the title of "prodigy" among the Yellow Maple Valley's prominent families. Because of her, the pink-robed cultivator had been confined to her home, forced to cultivate relentlessly until she caught up, cutting her off from the outside world. 

Though her cultivation had improved, she was miserable—and she blamed Chen Qiaoqian for it.

"Isn't that the Lu family's wind-attribute genius? Weren't the Chen and Lu families supposed to arrange a marriage between them? Doesn’t look very loving to me."

"Seems like the rumors were false."

"There's a secret here. I should follow them."

She stealthily trailed after the pair.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun and Han Li left the pavilion, heading toward the trading grounds. 

It was still morning, so the path wasn't crowded, though most cultivators were moving in the same direction.

"Look! What a huge bird!" a male cultivator suddenly exclaimed.

A massive shadow swooped over the group, startling Han Li. He looked up to see a monstrous bird the size of a calf, with twin heads, gray feathers, and wings spanning several meters. Its sickle-like talons and four glowing green eyes made it a fearsome sight.

"How ugly!"

"It's enormous!"

"Let's capture it—it'd make a great mount!"

The cultivators below buzzed with excitement, some even preparing to act.

"Let's go, Brother Han. No need to watch," Lin Yun said, nudging the awestruck Han Li.

"Brother Lin, shouldn’t we stay? I’ve never seen cultivators capture a demonic beast before," Han Li said eagerly, hoping to learn from the spectacle. 

As a new cultivator, he lacked combat experience, and observing such a fight would be invaluable. Plus, the idea of taming a beast for travel was thrilling.

Amused by Han Li's enthusiasm, Lin Yun chuckled. 

"There's no spectacle to see. That’s a Twin-Headed Vulture, a spirit beast raised by the Yan family."

As Lin Yun walked ahead, Han Li overheard the murmurs of the other cultivators and hurried after him.

"Brother Lin, is the Yan family powerful?" Han Li asked. "Those wandering cultivators looked terrified just hearing their name."

"Of course. The Yan family is the top cultivation clan in Yue Country. Unlike families attached to sects, they stand independently—and they even have a Core Formation cultivator," Lin Yun explained.

Han Li gasped. After learning last night how difficult Foundation Establishment was, the idea of a Core Formation expert was staggering.

**[Ding! Host has enlightened friend Han Li about the Yan family, broadening his horizons. "Cast your bread upon the waters" effect triggered.]**

**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained: Special Item—Sky Thunder Pearls x100.]**

**[Item Description: Sky Thunder Pearls, refined centuries ago by a mysterious cultivator who harnessed heavenly lightning. Each pearl possesses immense destructive power—even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would be obliterated if struck directly. Originally, there were seventy-three pearls.]**

"Wow! A hundred Sky Thunder Pearls! This trip was worth it just for this haul!" Lin Yun couldn’t help but admire Han Li even more. 

*Han Li, you’re my lucky star! Truly my sworn brother in all but blood.*

"Brother Han, as the Ascension Assembly draws near, more and more clan cultivators are arriving at the Tai Nan Gathering. They’re not to be trifled with, so don’t wander off," Lin Yun cautioned.

"Understood, Brother Lin," Han Li nodded obediently.
