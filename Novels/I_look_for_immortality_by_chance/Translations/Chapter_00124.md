# Chapter 124: Jiang Ningxue's Service, Ma Wu Presents a Treasure! (Combined)

"Binding Dragon Wood?"

This was indeed spiritual material that Gu Yuan urgently needed. 

Yet he still shook his head: "Not enough!"

A single spiritual wood could only cultivate one seal imprint at most—its value couldn't compare to that of a living Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"What does senior brother propose then?"

Bian Chuyao wasn't surprised by this response and asked again.

"I wish to forge favorable connections and gather subordinates."

Gu Yuan smiled faintly.

"Does senior brother want this woman to serve under you?"

"To be honest with junior sister, Senior Brother Lu Guan from Bihuo Peak has already exchanged a spiritual qi with me. His newly advanced Foundation Establishment disciple will serve me for fifty years. Moreover, all his Qi Refinement disciples will be at my disposal to campaign against the Scarlet Moon Great River."

Bian Chuyao fell silent for a long moment before smiling wryly: "If it were an ordinary cultivator, serving senior brother would be acceptable. But this woman has extraordinary talent—she's the prized disciple of Ruyi Peak. Having her serve as your enforcer would be..."

"What does that have to do with me? Does junior sister wish to aid an enemy? Within the sect, Foundation Establishment cultivators under a hundred years old are not rare. The position of True Successor isn't set in stone. Wouldn't such a prodigy be a fierce tiger lying in wait?"

Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve dismissively.

In truth, he didn't fear so-called prodigies—it would just mean another battle. But to strengthen a potential enemy who might later become an obstacle—that would be foolish indeed. He wasn't the type to nurture powerful enemies to temper himself.

"In that case, let Senior Sister Shen negotiate with you directly!"

This matter wasn't something Bian Chuyao could decide. After all, she was merely acting as an intermediary today.

With that thought, she waved her hand and sent out a sound transmission talisman toward Ruyi Peak.

"Please wait a moment, senior brother. Senior Sister Shen will arrive shortly."

After sending the talisman, Bian Chuyao requested.

Gu Yuan had no objections.

With the campaign against Scarlet Moon Great River approaching, he hoped to settle this matter quickly to secure the most assistance.

"How does senior brother plan to distribute the remaining spiritual qi?"

While waiting, Bian Chuyao wasn't idle and inquired about Gu Yuan's intentions.

"Simply seeking those with pure hearts who can be of use to me."

Gu Yuan gave a simple reply.

But inwardly, he'd already decided to announce a competition for the spiritual qi after tomorrow.

Those who could establish connections with him had likely already visited these past few days. The rest could compete among themselves.

However, the competition wouldn't necessarily involve combat or wealth. If they possessed special skills in cultivation arts, Gu Yuan planned to nurture them as well.

Through today's meditation, he'd realized that future cultivation would likely require external assistance.

Among the sect's Qi Refinement cultivators, their capabilities had been evident during the Flowing Clouds Banquet—few displayed exceptional talent in combat. Thus, it might be better to nurture a few Foundation Establishment cultivators skilled in alchemy or artifact forging to serve as his foundation and support his cultivation.

"Senior brother might consider Ma Wu from Three Flames Cave."

Bian Chuyao suddenly recommended someone.

"Oh?"

Gu Yuan looked at her curiously.

"Don't misunderstand, senior brother. I haven't received any benefits from him. But his circumstances are unique. During the Flowing Clouds Banquet, he used what appeared to be the 'Flame Devouring Heaven Reversal Seal.' I've seen records of this seal in my clan's secret texts—it's a secret technique passed down from a Golden Core sect called the Scarlet Heaven Sect."

"This sect specialized in fire techniques, with numerous fire seals in their repertoire. The Flame Devouring Heaven Reversal Seal is particularly profound—it can absorb all spiritual flames. At its peak, not only does it grant immunity to flames, it can even temper the body to enhance one's spiritual roots."

"Had I not consumed the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit that day, I might not have defeated him."

"Senior brother doesn't cultivate fire techniques, so this seal is useless to you. However, since he's mastered it, he likely obtained the Scarlet Heaven Sect's legacy. As a former Golden Core sect, a mere Qi Refinement cultivator couldn't have fully explored its depths. Taking him under your wing might grant you access to his fortune!"

"Moreover, even if you don't gain his legacy, the Scarlet Heaven Sect excelled in fire techniques and had unique insights into alchemy that might benefit you."

Bian Chuyao smiled and handed Gu Yuan a copied section of the secret texts detailing the Scarlet Heaven Sect.

A millennium ago, this sect had flourished before declining due to a lack of successors after their Golden Core patriarch perished. Internal strife ensued, resulting in the sect's complete collapse, with even their secret realm disappearing without a trace.

"You specifically asked for his name at the banquet—was it to recruit him?"

"My spiritual qi must go to my clan—I can't spare any. But I know senior brother's unparalleled strength means you'll have surplus qi to bestow. If there truly is a secret realm, I'll serve you diligently in exchange for a share..."

Bian Chuyao blinked mischievously.

She'd shared this information hoping for benefits, though she wasn't insistent—merely playing the part of a delicate maiden. If rewards came, well and good; if not, no matter.

"We'll discuss this later. There may not even be a secret realm left to explore. Still, he's worth keeping an eye on..."

Gu Yuan stored the text and nodded.

Ma Wu's capabilities had been evident at the banquet. With supreme spiritual sense and unusual fortune, he would've secured a spot—a top seventh-rank one at that—had he not faced Bian Chuyao after she consumed the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit.

However, his techniques were too limited. Beyond the flame-devouring seal, his other methods were mediocre, making him vulnerable against non-fire cultivators—hence his failure to secure the final three spots.

"Junior Brother Gu, pardon my abrupt visit."

As they conversed, a divine sense descended outside Earth Flame Island.

"Senior Sister Shen is here!"

Bian Chuyao exclaimed.

Gu Yuan extended his spiritual sense to see a beautiful, voluptuous woman in jade-green robes hovering outside the island—a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Beside her stood an exquisitely beautiful but aloof young woman in a long dress—only at Qi Refinement eighth layer, yet her frosty demeanor made her seem even more unapproachable than her companion.

"Whoosh!"

Gu Yuan opened the formation, allowing the two to land swiftly in Stone Cavern Cave.

...

"Congratulations on your Foundation Establishment, Junior Brother Gu, and your three-century lifespan extension. A humble gift, please accept."

The woman surnamed Shen smiled and presented a jade vial containing Clear Origin Pills—Foundation Establishment elixirs that slightly enhanced cultivation speed.

"Ningxue, greet your Uncle-Master Gu. Your path to cultivation rests in his hands!"

She then urged the young woman beside her.

The bold girl studied Gu Yuan intently before bowing: "Jiang Ningxue pays respects to Uncle-Master Gu!"

Her voice matched her demeanor—cold as snow.

"No need for formalities."

Gu Yuan waved his sleeve to raise her.

Yet her peculiar "chill" gave him an indescribable sense of strangeness.

"Junior Brother Gu, Junior Sister Bian has already informed me, so I'll be direct."

"Obtaining spiritual qi in exchange for service is reasonable. But this disciple is exceptional—my closed-door disciple and Ruyi Peak's hope. Having her serve you is unsuitable. Instead, Ruyi Peak will provide another early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator to serve you for sixty years."

"As for the True Successor position, I guarantee Ningxue will yield whenever you compete. How does that sound?"

Shen cut straight to negotiations.

Another Foundation Establishment cultivator for sixty years?

Gu Yuan pondered.

But before he could respond, Jiang Ningxue interjected: "Master, there's no need to trouble others. This disciple is willing to serve Uncle-Master Gu!"

Everyone was taken aback.

"Ningxue, this is no trivial matter!"

Shen frowned and chided.

Serving Gu Yuan would mean campaigning against Scarlet Moon Great River—she'd heard Gu Yuan wasn't mild-mannered and would likely send his subordinates into danger.

With her Supreme Yin Physique and extraordinary talent, Jiang Ningxue would undoubtedly reach Foundation Establishment perfection if she survived, with higher chances of forming a Golden Core. As Ruyi Peak's inheritor, how could she serve under another?

"Master, jade must be carved to become a vessel!"

Jiang Ningxue remained resolute.

"Meditating in seclusion can't compare to life-and-death battles—Senior Sister Si is proof!"

"I refuse to cultivate in isolation!"

She bowed deeply to Shen.

"Ruyi Peak will also participate in the campaign. Wouldn't accompanying your Senior Sister Si be better?"

Shen still resisted.

"Master, our sect has fewer than a hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators. Ruyi Peak only has seven—we can't commit them all. Truthfully, Uncle-Master Gu's faction already surpasses ours. Following him might be the best choice..."

Despite her cold demeanor and mere Qi Refinement cultivation, Jiang Ningxue's logic gave Shen pause.

Upon reflection, it was true.

Gu Yuan had obtained one spiritual qi at the banquet and eight more in Ancient Mountain Secret Realm—nine in total.

This meant nine Foundation Establishment combatants—surpassing Ruyi Peak's numbers.

Unless they summoned their patriarch... but he hadn't appeared for years. She didn't even know if he still lived.

The seven peaks and five great clans appeared glorious, but each had their struggles.

Beyond Sky Pillar Peak, Green Flame Peak, Jade Vessel Peak, and the Bian and Su clans, the other peaks and clans hadn't seen their patriarchs in years. The sect even claimed only five Golden Core elders existed.

Without Golden Core experts, these factions relied on Foundation Establishment cultivators and their legacies to maintain prestige. Yet now, Gu Yuan's visible forces already rivaled some peaks and clans?

Even if they were newly advanced, combined with formation arrays, they'd be formidable.

With this realization, Shen relented: "Since my disciple has such faith in you, Junior Brother Gu, I won't oppose it. I entrust her to you—please take good care of her. Ruyi Peak will repay you handsomely."

But Gu Yuan remained silent.

He knew his limits.

He'd already used three spiritual qi himself, leaving only six to distribute.

From the Flowing Clouds Banquet, the Qi Refinement cultivators' capabilities had been mediocre. Recruiting them was merely to bolster numbers and support his True Successor bid.

True prodigies with profound fortunes wouldn't serve another for mere spiritual qi.

But Jiang Ningxue might be different.

With her Supreme Yin Physique and talent, she could bring unexpected benefits.

Yet... did she have ulterior motives? Did Ruyi Peak truly lack access to spiritual qi?

After contemplation, Gu Yuan made his decision.

Hesitation would only weaken his resolve.

How could he not handle a mere special physique?

With that, he produced a strand of spiritual qi.

"Ah..."

Shen sighed and handed Gu Yuan a jade box.

Their agreement settled, Shen departed with Jiang Ningxue.

Bian Chuyao congratulated Gu Yuan before also taking her leave.

After seeing them off, Gu Yuan spread word of the spiritual qi competition, stirring all ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators—especially common disciples, who flocked to Earth Flame Island.

...

"Artifact forgers, this way!"

"Alchemists here!"

"Skilled in managing spirit herb fields? Over here!"

"Treasure offerings? This line!"

"Secret realm intelligence? Here."

"Clan disciple? Which family? Who recommended you? How many years of service?"

Earth Flame Island buzzed with activity as retainers from the Bian and Feng clans directed cultivators to register their skills and intentions.

Beyond Ruyi and Bihuo Peaks' private arrangements, the remaining spiritual qi would be allocated through competition.

Talent, treasures, or special skills—one must excel in some regard to earn Gu Yuan's spiritual qi.

Soon, the island resembled a grand convention as disciples skilled in various arts arrived.

Gu Yuan delegated the tedious screening to the Bian and Feng servants while he received a visitor in his cave.

"Disciple Ma Wu pays respects to Uncle-Master Gu!"

Clad in nine-leaf robes, Ma Wu prostrated respectfully.

"No need for formalities. What brings you here, Nephew Ma?"

Gu Yuan raised him with a smile.

"Disciple wishes to offer a secret realm in exchange for a strand of heaven-earth spiritual qi!"
