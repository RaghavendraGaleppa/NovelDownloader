# Chapter Sixty-Two: Situation

However, despite the perilous situation on the battlefield, the number of disciples in the Battle Hall remained substantial. The significantly higher treatment and benefits they received compared to the other three halls were, of course, a major reason. But what was truly important was the deep-seated, indelible hatred every cultivator in the Sect Domain held against the infamous demonic cultivators and their factions in the Huaqing Realm. Even among the other three halls, countless cultivators wished to join the Battle Hall. However, due to their innate talents, they could create greater value in other positions, so they made the correct choice. Demonic cultivators were the common enemy of the Sect Domain, and the strength of the Sect Domain was the best revenge against them!

Jinfeng, the cultivator Old Huang called Senior Brother Jin, was already over fifty, but his cultivation wasn't much higher than Old Huang's. Still, Jinfeng had spent decades on the battlefield, so his experience far surpassed that of Old Huang and his companions, who were outer disciples just recently transferred from the Spirit Fields.

“Who knows?” Jinfeng mused. “These wolf cultivators used to be the most ruthless and cunning, excellent at stratagems. They could communicate through howls, feigning attacks and making empty threats countless times, always grabbing an advantage and then fleeing with extreme speed. Only with the help of the horse cultivators could we chase them. They were incredibly difficult to deal with. But lately, they’ve truly gone mad, constantly assaulting our Sect Domain. More wolf cultivators have died in the past few months than in the past few years combined.”

Jinfeng shook his head, a look of helplessness on his face. “Damn these wolf cultivators, they’re truly insane! Once I break through to the Foundation Establishment stage and condense a True Essence Formation, allowing me to join the battlefield, I will definitely exterminate them, root and branch!”

The primary offensive methods of Xuanfu Sect disciples were, naturally, spirit talismans. Old Huang and the other outer disciples of the Battle Hall always kept numerous combat talismans on hand, enabling them to resolve emergencies swiftly. However, spirit talismans were not inexhaustible. Drawing talismans was a skilled craft with a high failure rate, and coupled with the wolf cultivators' relentless attacks during this period, the Battle Hall's supply of talismans was constantly short. Therefore, besides the talismans they carried, Old Huang and his companions also kept talisman brushes and paper in their satchels. If a battle dragged on too long and all pre-prepared talismans were used up, they would have to draw them directly on the battlefield to handle the most critical moments.

Still a considerable distance away, Old Huang saw the pack ahead, bounding and leaping amidst a large group of outer disciples. Their blood-filled mouths constantly snapped shut, and their claws, sharp as flying swords, flashed up and down, churning up waves of blood.

“Wolf cultivators again!”

Old Huang gritted his teeth, not surprised in the least. Lately, the wolf cultivators had indeed gone mad, continuously raiding the Sect Domain, mostly launching sudden attacks under the cover of night. Sect Domain cultivators couldn't be on guard at all times, especially the core combat forces who were already inner disciples; they also needed rest and replenishment of talismans. But the wolf cultivators were like maggots clinging to bone, sometimes striking and fleeing, making pursuit impossible, and other times attacking with suicidal ferocity.

As a result, the wolf cultivators had virtually no natural predators in the entire Huaqing Realm. Although the Huaqing Realm naturally boasted many demonic cultivators far stronger than the Wolf King, battles always entailed risk. While these demonic cultivators were powerful, they weren't so strong as to completely disregard the astonishing combat prowess of the wolf cultivator tribe. Therefore, unless there was a significant conflict of interest, almost no one would provoke the wolf cultivators. And if the wolf cultivators wished to avoid conflict with other demonic cultivators, they would resort to a 'strong man breaking his wrist' tactic, directly abandoning a portion of their kind to secure peace. Such ruthless and powerful wolf cultivators were, without a doubt, enemies greatly feared by the Sect Domain. However, in the past, the wolf cultivator tribe did not engage in excessive conflict with the Sect Domain. After all, the Huaqing Realm was vast, and there were other cultivators for them to hunt besides those in the Sect Domain. But recently, it was as if the wolf cultivators had fixed their gaze solely on the Sect Domain, as if they had suddenly developed some deep-seated, irreconcilable hatred, to the point of a fight to the death.
