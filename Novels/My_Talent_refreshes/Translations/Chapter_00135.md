# Chapter 135: Accelerated Cultivation

Gu Xiaoqing was indeed incredibly surprised at this moment. A month ago, when Chu Ning left Yanji Market, he was still at the fifth level of Qi Condensation. Yet, in the blink of an eye, a month had passed, and Chu Ning had actually advanced two entire realms. How could she not be astonished?

Chu Ning nodded slightly and said, "Yes, after returning to the sect from the market, I just happened to break through to the sixth level of Qi Condensation. This time, the sect arranged a mission, and I acquired some fortuitous opportunities, just breaking through to the seventh level of Qi Condensation today."

Despite Chu Ning providing a reason, Gu Xiaoqing's face remained filled with shock. Her talent was considered good; when she first went to Yanji Market, she had already been at the eighth level of Qi Condensation for some time. Now, she had only just touched the threshold of the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Meanwhile, Chu Ning, who was at the fourth level of Qi Condensation back then, had leapfrogged to the seventh level. While it was true that early-stage breakthroughs were easier, this was still enough to greatly astonish this outer sect disciple from the Pill Refining Hall.

Even Zhong Ying, who was at the Foundation Establishment stage standing nearby, also showed a hint of surprise. However, this surprise was merely fleeting, and she quickly returned to normal, saying, "Since Junior Nephew Chu has participated in sect missions and joined the inner sect, his future, even Foundation Establishment, holds great promise. Xiaoqing, why are you making such a fuss?"

The matter of the Spiritual Domain Spiritual Seed was no longer a secret within the sect. Most people with a bit of status now knew about it. Gu Xiaoqing had also heard Zhong Ying mention it after returning to the sect, so she was aware. Hearing Zhong Ying mention that Chu Ning had hopes of Foundation Establishment in the future, a trace of envy couldn't help but appear in Gu Xiaoqing's eyes. A gentle smile reappeared on her face as she turned to Chu Ning and said, "Then congratulations, Junior Brother Chu."

"It's nothing, just good luck."

"You two chat, I have some matters to attend to." Zhong Ying saw them chatting and didn't interfere further, heading straight into the inner room.

Chu Ning was also disinclined to dwell on the topic. Seeing this Foundation Establishment Martial Aunt leave, he immediately turned to Gu Xiaoqing and asked, "Senior Sister Gu, you asked Martial Aunt Zhong to send me a message..."

"Right!" Gu Xiaoqing responded, immediately taking out a small bag of spirit stones from her storage bag, and then several jade boxes. "Junior Brother Chu, I've already harvested all the Golden Essence Fruits from your spiritual field, and these are the spirit stones. Also, I used all the talisman papers you gave me last time. These past few days, these Golden Orchid Fruits have also ripened. Since I was returning to the sect, I picked them and brought them back."

Hearing that Gu Xiaoqing had indeed picked all the Golden Orchid Fruits, Chu Ning was overjoyed and immediately took them. He hastily said, "Thank you so much, Senior Sister! The sect instructed me to cultivate in seclusion here, and I was really worried about what to do with these spiritual fruits."

Gu Xiaoqing smiled slightly, a hint of curiosity appearing on her face. "Junior Brother, I've never heard of these Golden Orchid Fruits before. They feel somewhat similar in aura to Golden Essence Fruits, but upon closer inspection, there's a very clear difference."

Chu Ning spoke vaguely at this point, "This fruit was something I cultivated unintentionally, a result of cross-pollination between two types of spiritual fruits. I just came up with the name Golden Orchid Fruit casually, so it's normal that Senior Sister hasn't heard of it." He paused, then, fearing she might press further, Chu Ning quickly added, "I'm still not sure what use this spiritual fruit has, so I wanted to bring it back to research it more."

"I see." Gu Xiaoqing's face showed a look of sudden understanding.

Chu Ning thought for a moment, but did not take the small bag of spirit stones. Instead, he said to Gu Xiaoqing, "Senior Sister Gu, consider those Golden Essence Fruits my gift to you. I'd like to ask another favor of Senior Sister."

Meeting Gu Xiaoqing's puzzled gaze, Chu Ning continued, "The Iron Stem Orchids growing in that spiritual field, the spiritual plants that bear the Golden Orchid Fruits, there are two hundred of them in total. Could I trouble Senior Sister to help me dig them up? Then, please give them to Steward Lin Changqing and ask him to bring them back for me next time he returns to the sect."

Chu Ning didn't mind the Golden Essence Fruits; he still had some Golden Essence Fruit seeds. However, these Iron Stem Orchids were something Chu Ning had purchased from Cloud Sea Pavilion and planted entirely in his spiritual field. Since Golden Orchid Fruit seeds couldn't be cultivated and could only be obtained through cross-pollination of two spiritual plants, these Iron Stem Orchids were crucial. Chu Ning did have 50 plants in his outer sect courtyard, but the 200 in the spiritual field were clearly more important.

"Alright, I'll go back to the market and help Junior Brother dig up those spiritual plants from the spiritual field." Gu Xiaoqing readily agreed upon hearing Chu Ning's words, but she still tried to hand the bag of spirit stones to Chu Ning. "This is just a small favor for me. The Golden Essence Fruits were Junior Brother's hard work to cultivate."

Chu Ning's brow subtly twitched. He continued, "Senior Sister, half of these spirit stones are my payment to you, and the other half is for Steward Lin."

"For Steward Lin?" Gu Xiaoqing was slightly surprised.

Chu Ning nodded vaguely. Steward Lin Changqing was quite willing to help people if there were some benefits for him. Gu Xiaoqing was an intelligent person and grasped it immediately. Her gaze towards Chu Ning was filled with complex emotions. She wasn't sure if it was because Chu Ning knew Lin Changqing's habit, or if Chu Ning categorized her as the same type of person. However, she said nothing more and put the bag of spirit stones back into her storage bag.

Seeing this, Chu Ning felt a slight sense of relief. He had already decided that once he cultivated the Azure Wood Everspring Technique to perfection and obtained the next cultivation method, he wouldn't stay in the sect for long. At this point, he naturally didn't want to owe too many favors. Being able to use spirit stones to ask Gu Xiaoqing for help also avoided a lot of entanglement.

After chatting casually for a few more moments, Chu Ning took his leave. Watching Chu Ning's departing back, Gu Xiaoqing's gaze became even more complex. But in the end, it turned into a soft sigh, and she turned to walk into the inner room.

Meanwhile, after leaving the Pill Refining Hall, Chu Ning went straight to his outer sect courtyard. Truth be told, since this courtyard was assigned to him, he had visited it on only a handful of occasions. He naturally had no lingering attachment to it.

However, before he entered the Spiritual Domain, he had specifically planted the Iron Stem Orchids he brought from Yanji Market here. These plants were still very useful to him, so Chu Ning naturally wouldn't leave them behind. After digging up all the Iron Stem Orchids and leaving the courtyard, Chu Ning went to the Talisman Pavilion. This courtyard was originally given to him by the Talisman Pavilion, and since he wasn't living in it anymore, he naturally had to return it.

Entering the Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning thought of his familiar Senior Brother Tan Zhang and couldn't help but feel a little melancholy. In the Spiritual Domain, the two of them had once worked together to deal with people from the Yin Demon Sect. But after the subsequent spiritual resonance eruption, Chu Ning never saw his senior brother appear again. What surprised Chu Ning was that Steward Liao Yunming was also not in the Talisman Pavilion. After thinking about it, Chu Ning could only give up for now. Steward Liao Yunming had originally given him this courtyard, and both ethically and logically, he should have returned it to him in person.

Returning to the inner sect, Chu Ning didn't go directly back to his cave abode. Instead, he wandered around the inner sect, seemingly casually. This was naturally to allow Ling Xiaobai to sense the overall situation of the grand protective formation and find a more suitable escape location.

After wandering for most of an hour, Chu Ning finally returned to his own cave abode. To Chu Ning's great surprise, before he even reached his cave abode, he saw two figures in the distance outside. His eyesight far surpassed that of ordinary people, and from afar, he recognized them as Ho Changyou and Liao Yunming. He quickly quickened his pace, stepping forward to bow and salute.

"Greetings, two Martial Uncles."

"Junior Nephew Chu, no need to be so polite." The two stewards seemed very polite at this moment.

Liao Yunming said with a chuckle, "We heard that Junior Nephew was accepted into the inner sect and became the Sect Master's registered disciple. We wanted to congratulate you a long time ago, but last time we came, Junior Nephew was in secluded cultivation. Today, we heard your message that you had come out of seclusion, so here we are together."

"Thank you, two Martial Uncles, for your concern." Chu Ning said his thanks while inviting the two into his cave abode. As soon as they entered, both of them showed expressions of surprise. Ho Changyou even directly exclaimed, "Junior Nephew, this cave abode of yours is a treasure land." Liao Yunming also chuckled and said, "Isn't it, Old Ho? It's much better than both of ours."

Chu Ning naturally responded with politeness. The two stewards then offered some congratulations, and indeed had nothing particularly important to discuss. After chatting for a while, they finally left. Chu Ning took the opportunity to return the restriction token for the outer sect Talisman Pavilion courtyard to Liao Yunming.

After the two left, Chu Ning re-activated the cave abode's restrictions, but he couldn't help but shake his head slightly. To outsiders, he had been accepted into the inner sect and taken as a registered disciple by Xin Wuya. His future was undoubtedly limitless, and it was probably for this reason that the two stewards had been so polite. After all, there had always been a rumor within the sect that cultivators who acquired the spiritual resonance qi had a very high success rate in Foundation Establishment. However, Chu Ning knew his own situation best. Putting aside the fact that he didn't have the subsequent cultivation methods yet, even if he did, he would absolutely not break through to Foundation Establishment in this place. Without indulging in these empty titles and vanity, for him, focusing on cultivation and leaving this place of trouble as soon as possible was the most important thing.

At this moment, Chu Ning collected his thoughts. First, he took the Iron Stem Orchids out of his storage bag and planted them. After planting them, looking at the courtyard which seemed a bit sparse with only a few Iron Stem Orchids, Chu Ning began to take out several jade boxes from his storage bag.

He naturally wouldn't plant Golden Essence Fruits; one or two months wouldn't be enough time for him to cultivate Golden Orchid Fruits. These Iron Stem Orchids were planted here merely to keep them alive and convenient for him to take away later.

At this moment, Chu Ning took out some seedlings from the jade boxes. Most of them were acquired by Chu Ning from the Spiritual Domain previously. Although keeping them in the jade boxes should not be a big problem, since there was a place to plant them here and the spiritual energy concentration was good, Chu Ning could naturally try planting them. He also wanted to see if any spiritual herbs or plants had a particularly good effect when the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art was used on them.

As for the Flame-Wood Twin Fruit seedlings, Chu Ning did not take them out to plant. This type of spiritual fruit had certain requirements for its growing environment, needing a place with a relatively rich fire attribute spiritual energy. Unless he took out the Fire Spirit Crystal and placed it in the medicinal garden, and then sealed it with a Spirit Locking Formation, the conditions here would not meet the requirements for planting. Chu Ning naturally didn't know how to set up a Spirit Locking Formation, and besides, he wasn't prepared to plant such good things right now.

After all the spiritual plants were planted, Chu Ning began to prepare for cultivation. During this period, because he had spiritual resonance qi to refine within his body, Chu Ning had not consumed any spiritual fruits or elixirs, nor had he cultivated with the aid of the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art. At this moment, he wanted to conduct an experiment. He wanted to see how his body, having undergone marrow cleansing and bone changing due to the spiritual resonance qi, would benefit his cultivation.

Chu Ning performed the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art, then went directly into the cultivation room and began to cultivate cross-legged. Half an hour later, Chu Ning walked out of the cultivation room with a hint of pleasant surprise on his face. Then, he went directly to the Iron Stem Orchids and continued to cultivate the Azure Wood Everspring Technique.

Immediately, wisps of spiritual energy overflowed from the Iron Stem Orchids and, together with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth already present in the air, drilled into Chu Ning's body. An hour later, Chu Ning stood up, having completed his cultivation, a smile on his face.

[Azure Wood Everspring Technique (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Level (1742/2100)]
[Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Bone Strengthening 818/1500]
[Spirit Refining Art, Second Level 71/2000]

"1 point of proficiency! I can actually gain 1 point of proficiency just by cultivating directly and with the aid of the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art. This is at the ninth level of Qi Condensation!"

Chu Ning was indeed incredibly surprised. In terms of spiritual energy absorption speed, he had probably increased by 50% compared to before! One must know that he possessed a Yin Wood Spirit Body, and his spiritual energy absorption speed was already fast. His current spiritual energy absorption speed was truly terrifying! "This spiritual resonance qi is truly amazing. Could it be that it really strengthened my spiritual roots?"

Chu Ning was both shocked and delighted at this moment. With his current spiritual energy absorption speed, if he were to supplement it with elixirs and spirit stones, gaining 4 or 5 points of Azure Wood Everspring Technique proficiency a day would not be difficult. He could even accelerate further if he gave up some cultivation of the Spirit Refining Art and Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art. After all, he now had many more resources at hand. Calculating this way, perhaps in two months, he would be able to cultivate the third level of the Azure Wood Everspring Technique to full proficiency. This speed was even faster than his breakthroughs in previous levels. Of course, Chu Ning also knew that this was because the spiritual resonance qi had previously boosted his proficiency significantly.

After a short rest, Chu Ning re-entered the cultivation room. He had quite a few resources now, and he wanted to see what effects these resources would have when used. Chu Ning first took out a Golden Orchid Fruit and ate it. Then, he began to cultivate the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art and the Azure Wood Everspring Technique.

"Bone Strengthening increased by 2 points, but Azure Wood Everspring Technique did not increase by 1 point again." Chu Ning quickly made a judgment on the effects of the Golden Orchid Fruit. Its effect on body tempering remained, but its effect on Qi cultivation had weakened as he broke through to the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Previously, one Golden Orchid Fruit could increase body tempering by 2 points and Qi cultivation by 1 point. Chu Ning was not too surprised, as the Golden Orchid Fruit's primary use before was still for body tempering.

After a brief session of cultivating the Spirit Refining Art, Chu Ning took out the Wood Essence Pill he had just received from the Thousand Mechanisms Pavilion. Since the steward from the Thousand Mechanisms Pavilion said that the Wood Essence Pill's effect was twice as good as the Spirit Essence Pill, Chu Ning wanted to see if it was truly the case. He consumed a Wood Essence Pill and once again cultivated the Azure Wood Everspring Technique. This time, Chu Ning spent some time fully refining the medicinal power of the Wood Essence Pill.

[Azure Wood Everspring Technique (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Level (1745/2100)]
And when Chu Ning focused his attention on the proficiency in his mind again, he surprisingly found that the proficiency of the third level of the Azure Wood Everspring Technique had increased by 3 points!

Of course, this included the effect of the Golden Orchid Fruit he had just consumed. But it also indicated that consuming and refining this Wood Essence Pill by itself could increase proficiency by more than 2 points. "5 points a day is absolutely not a problem. If I take two Wood Essence Pills a day, or cultivate using mid-grade spirit stones, I could even increase it by more than 6 points!"

Chu Ning made up his mind. However, taking two Wood Essence Pills a day seemed a bit exaggerated, and going to the Thousand Mechanisms Pavilion too frequently might not be appropriate. But he could combine it with Spirit Essence Pills or mid-grade spirit stones for cultivation. Chu Ning didn't have many mid-grade spirit stones; he had used some before, and after acquiring some more, he had about 80 pieces. But at this moment, he had nothing to regret. Spirit stones could always be earned, and danger could also come at any time. Understanding this, Chu Ning had a very clear understanding of his subsequent cultivation plan.

In the days that followed, Chu Ning continued his routine of planting and cultivating. As an inner sect disciple, he remained incredibly low-key, so no one in the sect remembered him after a while. Especially in the subsequent period, several other things happened in the sect. For instance, the hundreds of Qi Condensation disciples gradually recovered, and as they returned to their respective halls, the events within the Spiritual Domain spread like wildfire.

For example, it was rumored that an inner sect disciple who had obtained spiritual resonance qi three years ago was facing Foundation Establishment, and Sect Master Xin Wuya personally acted as his protector. This matter was initially not known to outsiders, but later, the disciple who successfully established his foundation intentionally showed off, and it inadvertently spread. It was said that this even angered Sect Master Xin Wuya, who confined the disciple.

Another example was that too many disciples had been lost in the Spiritual Domain, especially a concentrated group of disciples who cultivated wood-attribute cultivation methods in the later period, which caused problems in the operation of many spiritual fields and markets within the sect. Because of this, the Azure Stream Sect urgently expanded its recruitment of disciples and drew many wood-attribute cultivation method disciples from various prominent families into the sect. For a time, this also caused much discussion inside and outside the sect.

During this period, Chu Ning would still take Ling Xiaobai out for walks every day. He would even proactively report his cultivation progress to Xin Wuya, as Xin Wuya had instructed him to do, putting on an act of wishing to build a relationship with the Sect Master. However, after the Grand Sect Master Xin learned of Chu Ning's secluded cultivation, besides praising him a few times, he didn't pay much attention.

Especially after Chu Ning refined the spiritual resonance qi, although his cultivation had improved slightly, it wasn't a visibly dramatic increase. This also made Xin Wuya realize that Chu Ning was only at the seventh level of Qi Condensation, still too far from Foundation Establishment. So much so that the last time Chu Ning went to see him, this nominal Sect Master did not even let him enter his cave abode. This decrease in attention naturally delighted Chu Ning.

During this time, Chu Ning also went to the Scripture Depository to scout out the path. After learning that there was a sect rule that only allowed him to choose one spell to avoid distraction in his cultivation, Chu Ning naturally did not easily use this opportunity. However, there didn't seem to be many restrictions on his talisman crafting skills. Chu Ning decisively requested a talisman classic, which was the Profound Talisman Record that Liao Yunming had mentioned to him before. It was said that this classic was the most comprehensive talisman classic within the Azure Stream Sect, containing not only a large number of high-grade primary talismans but also many intermediate talisman crafting methods. In addition, Chu Ning also found several classics in the Scripture Depository that introduced the geography of the cultivation world. All of this was naturally in preparation for his eventual departure.

In the blink of an eye, fifty more days had passed. On this day, Chu Ning re-activated the seclusion formation outside his cave abode.
