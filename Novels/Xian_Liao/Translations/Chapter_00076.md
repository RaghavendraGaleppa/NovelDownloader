# Chapter 76: Refining the Spirit

As the day of Taihe Sect's succession ceremony approached, thunder rumbled across the sky and heavy rain poured down.

The Taoist priests and devotees in the temple complex all lamented how increasingly strange the weather had become in recent years. It was only February, yet such violent thunderstorms were already occurring.

The sky was dark and overcast with thick clouds.

Inside Zhang Jingxiu's body, thunderous sounds emerged from his abdomen - this was the higher level of Toad Fishing Technique resonating with the thunder above. He stepped outside where raindrops fell like beans.

Xiao Ruowang watched his master from under the eaves. The master's entire body was bursting with energy, his hair, skin, and Taoist robes resembling lotus leaves - the raindrops simply slid right off.

He recognized this as their sect's Eighteen Avoidance Technique, but since the sect's founding, no one except the founding patriarch had reached his master's level of mastery.

This was the Xiantian realm!

Xiao Ruowang was filled with longing.

As the thunder gradually subsided, the rain grew even heavier.

Zhang Jingxiu said proudly, "Ruowang, this is the Xiantian realm - cultivating one's body to be like a lotus leaf where dust cannot cling. In our Taoist tradition, it's also called the Water-Parting Realm, almost qualifying as a divine ability. Come here and carefully experience the subtlety of my energy application."

Xiao Ruowang respectfully obeyed, stepping forward.

"Now, strike me with your palm."

Following his master's instruction, Xiao Ruowang struck, only to feel his master's entire body erupt with energy like an elastic net.

Suddenly!

The net generated a counterforce that sent Xiao Ruowang flying back several meters.

"What is this?"

"This is the wondrous application of True Qi. Unfortunately, my Qi cultivation falls far short of my body refinement - a result of the world's spiritual energy being too sparse. The highest level of Eighteen Avoidance Technique combines blood energy and True Qi, allowing free control at will. However, my spirit refinement surpasses even my Qi cultivation. I can perceive everything within three zhang around me without seeing or hearing. Within this range, I can react even to the briefest flash of lightning." Zhang Jingxiu showed slight pride when mentioning spiritual perception.

The Taihe Sect's Sun-Moon Spirit Refinement secret technique was something no other sect possessed.

Additionally, the sect possessed a piece of jade. After Zhang Jingxiu infused it with True Qi, he obtained some secrets and information about cultivation beyond the Xiantian realm.

Normally, a Xiantian practitioner's spiritual perception only extended three chi around their body.

Ten chi made one zhang.

Yet when Zhang Jingxiu achieved Xiantian and condensed his spiritual perception, it already covered one zhang. Now it reached three zhang.

Although Zhou Qing was a once-in-a-generation talent, he achieved Xiantian over a year later than Zhang. His current spiritual perception range surely couldn't compare.

Zhang Jingxiu paused, then continued:

"That Tantric expert last time possessed unique mental techniques that complemented our Taoist spirit refinement in different ways. After his death, we found a human skin scripture covered in strange mantras I couldn't understand. Since Scholar Zhou is coming, we can ask him to examine it. His vast knowledge might decipher the text."

In the Taihe Sect's jade inheritance, spiritual perception was key to controlling magical implements. Without such implements, merely using ordinary objects to manipulate things remotely required either practicing Qi techniques like the Crane Control Skill or elevating spiritual perception to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement.

However, ordinary objects were inferior to magical implements in every way, and controlling implements consumed far less spiritual energy.

"Scholar Zhou truly has extensive knowledge," Xiao Ruowang sighed.

At that moment, a long cry came from far down the mountain, standing out clearly amidst the torrential rain like thunder.

Zhang Jingxiu smiled, "Speak of the devil. Let's go welcome our honored guest."

Master and disciple descended the steep, slippery steps.

Soon they reached the mountain gate.

Through the pouring rain, five figures appeared before them.

Zhang Jingxiu greeted them with a broad smile that then froze. Miss Lin stood beside Zhou Qing, seemingly protected by an invisible barrier that kept both of them completely dry, even their feet clean.

The old Taoist had just boasted to his disciple about mastering their sect's ultimate Eighteen Avoidance Technique with water-parting ability.

And here Zhou Qing showed up with something even more impressive?

Not only keeping himself dry but extending it to others nearby.

"It seems Scholar Zhou broke through to Xiantian on his own, with far more abundant True Qi than me," Zhang Jingxiu transmitted to his disciple, salvaging his dignity with this excuse.

In truth, Zhou Qing had discovered his spiritual perception far surpassed his True Qi. By precisely manipulating True Qi to drive blood energy, he formed a protective barrier around his body. While it couldn't stop weapons, it could part rainwater.

This practice further refined his True Qi control.

Zhou Qing now understood how so-called immortal techniques originated - hidden in life's details, with cultivation in every aspect.

For instance, while ordinary people needed flint or tinder to make fire, an immortal practitioner could produce flames from nothing - that was a divine ability.

Transforming what ordinary people saw as impossible into possible!

Behind Zhou Qing were Zhishan and two elderly Taoists.

Zhang Jingxiu inwardly grumbled - this kid even brought the two madmen along! If their relationship were any worse, he might have thought Zhou Qing came to pick a fight and challenge the sect!

"Greetings, Elder Brother," Zhou Qing addressed him respectfully, though mentally calling him "Old Zhang."

"Greetings, Elder Xiao."

Zhou Qing simply smiled without revealing the truth, vaguely implying he and Old Zhang were about equal.

He wasn't lying - his meaning was half a catty of silver to Old Zhang's eight taels of bronze.

Whether Old Zhang understood was another matter.

As a guest, it wouldn't do to truly offend the host.

While pondering, Zhou Qing suddenly noticed Yuan Mingyue turning pale with rapid breathing. Immediately drawing golden needles, he swiftly inserted several into her body.

Yuan Mingyue's breathing gradually stabilized.

"Thank you, Master."

Zhou Qing frowned, "What just happened?"

"I don't know - the scripture's contents kept forcing into my mind. I felt lighter and lighter, as if about to float away."

After contemplation, realization struck Zhou Qing.

Had Yuan Mingyue nearly experienced soul projection?

Her symptoms resembled his first soul projection.

Had he not acted quickly, the outcome could have been dire.

If Yuan Mingyue died here in such a weakened state, there'd be no explaining it.

"Don't move. Let me examine you further," Zhou Qing said.

Accepting gratefully, Zhou Qing continued, "Your Highness, I notice the princess remains somewhat weak. As I specialize in life-nurturing arts, I'd like to take her as a nominal disciple for one month's training at Taihe Mountain. What do you think?"

Prince Qinghe hadn't expected Zhou Qing to accept his daughter as a disciple. Though far from the marital alliance he'd hoped for, this showed Zhou Qing's friendly attitude toward their household.

This connection could prove valuable in the turbulent times ahead.

Zhou Qing had thought it through - if Fushan was right about supporting the imperial court being beneficial, they'd need deeper arrangements during the chaos.

Focusing solely on conquest would hinder his cultivation.

Moreover, human hearts were unpredictable. With greater territory came complex power dynamics. Even trusted aides had their own agendas - could he simply kill them over minor disagreements?

Worldly affairs were like quicksand - one couldn't avoid them entirely but mustn't sink too deep either.

The key was maintaining balance - able to engage and disengage.

Besides, teaching Miss Lin or the princess made no difference. Taking disciples also verified his own cultivation.

......

Yuan Mingyue never imagined becoming Zhou Qing's nominal disciple, even if only for a month. She'd be learning alongside another sister surnamed Lin.

She knew this was her master's close companion.

Yet Miss Lin actually hoped Yuan Mingyue might become Zhou Qing's wife.

As a princess, her status matched Zhou Qing's.

Though her frail health might prove challenging...

But Miss Lin clearly felt her own health improving around Zhou Qing despite no martial training.

Zhou Qing explained this was a Xiantian characteristic - his frequent bodily thunder sounds subtly enhanced others' constitutions.

The origins of cultivation's thunder sounds?

Opinions varied.

Taihe Sect and Qingfu Temple agreed they likely originated from ancient practitioners emulating mountain tigers' roars.

Zhou Qing's initial thunder sound had been the Tiger's Roar, foundation of the Five Organs' Thunder, most effective for boosting blood energy and strength.

"Princess, your memory is remarkable - you've memorized such complex formulas," Zhou Qing marveled. In his life, he'd only met one other with such memory - himself. Of course, his own was superior, with perfect recall including past life details.

"Master, I've always had excellent memory and loved reading. I've nearly finished all our mansion's texts."

Zhou Qing grew interested, "Have you read Snow Region texts?"

"Quite a few. Being often ill in childhood, our household invited Tantric masters who brought some Snow Region texts."

Those lamas had aimed to convert the prince through these texts, bringing mostly esoteric Tantric works.

Zhou Qing said, "Elder Zhang gave me some Tantric mantras. While I recognize the characters, my knowledge of Snow Region culture is limited. Could you assist?"

Snow Region script resembled Tibetan from his past life. Though Zhou Qing could read the mantras, cultural gaps risked misinterpretation.

Yuan Mingyue's arrival was timely for understanding Tantric culture.

Their unique mental cultivation methods were extraordinary.

The two Tantric experts beside Shang Bing had remarkably broken free from his Soul Suppression - undoubtedly tied to their practices.

Though reading alone refined Zhou Qing's spirit, mysteries remained about spirit refinement's essence.

The human skin scripture Zhang Jingxiu provided might hold answers.

Studying the Tantric text with Yuan Mingyue's knowledge, Zhou Qing cross-referenced until the complete scripture took form.

The more he analyzed, the more astonished he grew.

"Though unorthodox, it has unique merits."

Deciphering revealed a spirit refinement method translated as "Fierce Tiger Sutra of Slaying."

Unlike conventional methods, it visualized oneself as a tiger subduing ghostly minions, harnessing spectral forces to cultivate spirit.

At Xiantian level, one's spiritual perception could form a tiger-skin cloak with awe-inspiring might to subdue ghosts.

Clearly, the Tantric master Wula that Zhang Jingxiu killed hadn't reached this stage.

Most Tantric spirit refinement shared similarities - using bizarre methods to temper the spirit, somewhat resembling Buddhism's Skeleton Contemplation.

"Visualizing a tiger poses no difficulty, and my spiritual perception far surpasses ordinary Xiantian experts."

By "ordinary," Zhou Qing meant Zhang Jingxiu. Old Zhang boasted about perceiving three zhang and his Sun-Moon refinement's wonders, asking about Zhou Qing's current ability.

Zhou Qing had vaguely claimed they were comparable - half a catty versus eight taels in his mind.

Whether Old Zhang grasped the implication was uncertain.

As a guest, truly angering the host wouldn't do.
