# Chapter 29: 800 Pounds

Yao Shifeng's letter contained only one thing this time—a gathering invitation. The meeting was scheduled for three days later at the market Gu Mo had previously visited.

Since neither the time nor location posed any conflict, Gu Mo promptly replied to Yao Shifeng, confirming his attendance.

After sending his reply, Gu Mo began harvesting his spirit field. Waves of Gengjin Sword Qi swept out, cutting down the heavy rice ears. With a flick of his sleeve, he activated the Minor Cosmic Pocket spell, collecting the fallen rice and transferring it directly into the Black Mist Space.

Within a few hours, the harvest was complete. Gu Mo estimated the yield to be at least seven to eight hundred pounds—practically his limit. 

As for the maximum yield of Spirit Jade Rice, records showed that someone had once achieved a yield of 1,000 pounds per acre. However, that feat was accomplished on a top-tier Grade 1 spirit field with the combined efforts of five professional spirit farmers, each mastering an advanced-level farming spell. Such extreme yields were hardly replicable. 

With his current output, Gu Mo was already among the top performers in the Spirit Cultivation Hall when it came to Spirit Jade Rice alone.

After finishing the harvest, Gu Mo packed the Sunflowers from the spirit field and the Peashooters into flowerpots, storing them in the Black Mist Space. 

Next, he needed to register his yield at the Spirit Cultivation Hall, so he naturally took everything with him. Even the koi fish raised in the water vat were placed in a basin and tossed into the Black Mist Space. 

Those koi had consumed a fair amount of Sun Essence. Losing them would be a significant setback. Once he had a surplus of Sun Essence in the future, Gu Mo planned to feed them until their entire bodies turned gold, curious to see what changes would occur.

With everything packed, Gu Mo activated the formation disk in the spirit field, enveloping the area in an illusionary barrier. Only then did he mount his paper crane and fly toward the valley.

"800 pounds!"  

The steward responsible for yield registration stared at Gu Mo in disbelief. A yield of 800 pounds per acre was rare even among outer disciples, let alone a newly recruited laborer disciple who had only joined the Spirit Cultivation Hall a year ago.

As for falsifying yields—such a thing was impossible. The steward’s position required the ability to discern authenticity, and he had no doubt about Gu Mo’s claim.

"You’ve just entered the finals for this year’s Spirit Jade Rice yield competition," the steward remarked in awe. It seemed highly likely that this year’s top yield would belong to a laborer disciple.

---

Every year, the Spirit Cultivation Hall rewarded the disciple with the highest yield to encourage productivity. This was precisely why Gu Mo hadn’t hidden his results. 

While inflating yields was difficult, underreporting was easy—especially for a newcomer like him. Had he claimed a yield of 500 pounds, no one would have questioned him. Yet, he chose to report honestly, showcasing his farming talent. 

Doing so wouldn’t invite unwanted attention but would instead earn him rewards from the Spirit Cultivation Hall. His current spirit field and three-year rent exemption were already benefits of displaying his farming prowess. Why not leverage this further for greater gains?

What Gu Mo truly needed to conceal was the existence of the Sunflowers. The Sun Essence they produced could potentially alter spiritual root aptitude—a secret that, if exposed, would attract forces capable of crushing him effortlessly. 

Thus, he took extreme precautions. Every time he left, he took all the Sunflowers with him. Without a concealment technique for his cultivation, he dared not cultivate at full capacity.

After submitting 500 pounds of Spirit Rice in exchange for 500 sect contribution points, Gu Mo kept 300 pounds for himself. He planned to sell 200 pounds at the market for roughly 660 spirit stones—enough to sustain the illusion formation on his spirit field for an extended period. With the formation active, he could safely increase his Sunflowers to ten plants.

Ten portions of Sun Essence daily would be ample—whether for expanding the Black Mist Space, purchasing new Peashooters, or feeding the koi. The remaining 100 pounds were for his own consumption. Since switching to spirit rice, ordinary food had lost its appeal. The difference between spirit-infused rice and mundane fare was incomparable.

After registering his yield, Gu Mo flew to the market on his paper crane. Though the gathering was still days away, with the harvest complete, he had time to spare.

His first stop was Gou Youyu’s wine shop. Their previous transaction had been smooth, so Gu Mo decided to sell his rice to him again.

"Little brother, I’ve been waiting for you!"  

Upon Gu Mo’s arrival, Gou Youyu set aside his work and greeted him warmly. 

The 100 pounds of fresh spirit rice Gu Mo had sold him last time had been brewed into a batch of premium spirit wine, earning the shop some renown. Previously, the inferior rice had only yielded mediocre wine—still sellable but not at high prices.

Only premium-grade spirit wine could fetch good prices. A shop selling only ordinary wine would harm its reputation.

"Shopkeeper Gou, what you’ve been waiting for is my rice, not me."  

After exchanging pleasantries, Gu Mo wasted no time and produced 200 pounds of spirit rice. He knew full well the reason for Gou Youyu’s enthusiasm.

Sure enough, Gou Youyu’s eyes lit up at the sight of the rice. He promptly handed over 660 spirit stones and even threw in a bottle of premium spirit wine as a bonus. 

The 660 stones covered the rice, but Gou Youyu naturally wanted to sweeten the deal. Gu Mo didn’t refuse—he had already finished the last bottle of wine Gou Youyu had given him. The taste had been excellent, and the spiritual energy within surpassed even that of spirit rice. Despite not being much of a drinker, Gu Mo had polished it off alone.

With the transaction complete, Gu Mo took his leave. Before departing, he asked Gou Youyu to keep an eye out for any concealment techniques that could mask one’s cultivation.

Gu Mo was still 2,200 contribution points short of exchanging for the "Hidden Qi Art." At his current rate, it would take two years to save up. If he could find such a technique in the market, it would save him time and possibly money.

Of course, this was just a backup plan. If nothing turned up, he wouldn’t be disappointed.

Gou Youyu readily agreed, assuming the request was for a powerful figure backing Gu Mo. He vowed to do his best.

Leaving the wine shop, Gu Mo headed to the market’s plaza. The stalls there always had something new each day, making every visit an educational experience. As long as he resisted impulsive purchases, the dubious items on display couldn’t fool him.

On the third day at the market, Gu Mo set out for the meeting location specified in Yao Shifeng’s letter.
