# Chapter 20: Breakthrough

As the words appeared in his field of vision, a glimmer of joy flashed in Qi Chuan's eyes.

The hundredfold multiplier effect was indeed effective in breaking through bottlenecks!

Simultaneously, new information flooded Qi Chuan's mind—insights and realizations about how to advance to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement.

These were the so-called moments of enlightenment.

However, these flashes of inspiration were scarce. After all, Qi Chuan had only completed one major cycle of the Evergreen Art, and his initial understanding of breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement had been minimal. Even after a seventy-twofold multiplier, the insights remained faint.

Relying solely on this to overcome the mid-stage bottleneck was clearly insufficient. Yet, Qi Chuan believed that as long as he continued to use the hundredfold multiplier to accumulate these moments of enlightenment, they would eventually coalesce into a complete understanding, allowing a natural and effortless breakthrough.

With this thought, a smile appeared on Qi Chuan's face.

"Next, I'll continue practicing the Evergreen Art, persistently seeking those moments of enlightenment and amplifying them with the hundredfold multiplier."

Thus, Qi Chuan resumed his cultivation, circulating the Evergreen Art and channeling his spiritual energy—not to break through, but to seek those elusive flashes of insight.

However, not every attempt yielded results.

**[You completed one major cycle of the Evergreen Art, attempting to grasp the enlightenment for breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement. A tenfold multiplier was triggered, but you gained nothing.]**

When the cycle ended, Qi Chuan opened his eyes with a hint of resignation. This time, he had failed to grasp any enlightenment. Since there had been no initial insight, even a tenfold multiplier yielded nothing.

Still, Qi Chuan remained confident. He knew that not every attempt would be fruitless. Although his method of seeking enlightenment was simple, he would eventually succeed—after all, this was merely a minor bottleneck between the early and mid-stages of Qi Refinement.

Moreover, he didn't need a profound revelation. Even the faintest glimmer of understanding, when amplified a hundredfold, would become substantial.

With renewed determination, Qi Chuan closed his eyes and resumed his practice.

**[You completed one major cycle of the Evergreen Art, attempting to grasp the enlightenment for breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement. A twentyfold multiplier was triggered, but you gained nothing.]**

**[You completed one major cycle of the Evergreen Art, attempting to grasp the enlightenment for breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement. A thirtyfold multiplier was triggered, and you successfully captured a sliver of enlightenment.]**

---

Compared to refining his cultivation or practicing spells, the process of seeking enlightenment was far more unpredictable.

At times, Qi Chuan could complete ten major cycles of the Evergreen Art without triggering any insights. Other times, he would capture multiple flashes of enlightenment in quick succession.

The randomness made it impossible for Qi Chuan to predict the outcome. But as he persisted, his understanding of the breakthrough gradually deepened, becoming clearer with each attempt. Given enough time, he would inevitably reach a state of complete enlightenment.

However, this method of cultivation still required circulating the Evergreen Art and channeling spiritual energy through his meridians, which had its daily limits. When he began to feel a faint stinging sensation in his meridians, Qi Chuan had no choice but to pause his pursuit of enlightenment and shift his focus to practicing spells.

Fireball Technique, Water Arrow Technique, Golden Skin Technique, Earth Wall Technique, and Vine Binding Technique—he trained them all. Even while striving to reach mid-stage Qi Refinement, Qi Chuan's mastery of the five basic elemental spells continued to improve steadily.

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.

**[You completed one major cycle of the Evergreen Art, attempting to grasp the enlightenment for breaking through to mid-stage Qi Refinement. A hundredfold multiplier was triggered, and you successfully captured the final sliver of enlightenment. Your understanding of the breakthrough is now complete.]**

That day, as Qi Chuan finished another major cycle and opened his eyes, these words appeared before him. Another fragment of enlightenment settled into his mind.

With this final piece, the puzzle was complete. Qi Chuan could now clearly sense a peculiar fluctuation in the spiritual energy within his dantian, accompanied by an instinctive certainty that the time had come.

Smiling, Qi Chuan realized he could attempt the breakthrough at any moment—and he would undoubtedly succeed, advancing to the fourth layer of Qi Refinement.

In truth, he could have tried earlier. Over the past three months, his accumulating insights had made the path to breakthrough increasingly clear. Many times, he had felt the urge to make the attempt, believing he might succeed.

Yet, each time, Qi Chuan restrained himself. He knew that without complete enlightenment, failure was still possible—though the odds diminished as his understanding grew. But why take the risk when patience guaranteed success?

And so, he had waited until now.

"Since the time has come, I shall break through."

With a calm smile, Qi Chuan activated the Evergreen Art, channeling all the spiritual energy in his dantian through his meridians. This time, however, the energy followed a slightly altered path, flowing through previously untouched meridians.

Three months ago, such a reckless maneuver would have been unthinkable—a single misstep could have led to severe consequences. But now, as the energy circulated flawlessly, Qi Chuan's aura grew increasingly formidable.

Whoosh!

Spiritual energy from the surrounding space surged into his body through his mouth, nose, and pores, rapidly refining into drops of liquid spiritual power that gathered in his dantian. Where before his dantian had been unable to hold any more energy at the peak of the third layer, it now steadily expanded.

An hour later, the influx of energy finally ceased.

As the last cycle of the Evergreen Art concluded and the spiritual energy settled back into his dantian, Qi Chuan exhaled slowly and opened his eyes.

Shing!

A sharp glint flashed in his eyes, radiating an indescribable authority. His entire being exuded a newfound presence—a stronger spiritual pressure born from his enhanced cultivation.

Savoring the surge of power within him, Qi Chuan smiled and closed his eyes again, turning his awareness inward. For the first time, he could clearly perceive every detail of his body—his organs, bones, muscles, and blood vessels—with perfect clarity.

This was the spiritual sense unique to mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, granting the ability to inspect one's own body internally.

When his spiritual sense swept over his dantian, Qi Chuan finally obtained a precise measurement of his spiritual energy reserves—no longer relying on vague estimations, but seeing the truth with absolute clarity.
