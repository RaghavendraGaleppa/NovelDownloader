Chapter 342: Crushing the Sword Sect, Pressuring the Madam, and Teaching the Vixen a Lesson—The Great Self Revealed!

Wen Caishang pondered: "So the Five Mountain Sword Alliance came to my door early in the morning for this matter. Hmph. They want to challenge me to a duel, but they should first ask if they are qualified. I was already planning to leave, so why bother with them? If they are ignorant of death and block my way, I will cripple them and send them to the west."

Just as she was about to formulate a refusal, Li Xian spoke up: "The Five Mountain Sword Alliance has numbers and strength. In the Tomb Vault, they bullied my wife, and that wasn't enough. Now they have come to my door to bully her again. Isn't this going too far?"

Seeing Li Xian speak up to protect her, Wen Caishang smiled and remained silent. The five elders looked at each other. First, they observed Wen Caishang’s expression. Seeing her eyebrows and eyes were gentle, they all thought: "This Madam is no善茬 (good person). Dealing with her risks one's life at any moment. We challenged her to a duel solely for the sect's reputation and to give our disciples an explanation, forcing ourselves to go through with it. Yet this Madam listens quite well to this young man's words. What kind of sweet talk did he feed her?"

Envy arose in their hearts.

Li Xian said: "Regarding the matters of the Tomb Vault, I suppose you all know clearly. It was He Wentian who played tricks, deceiving you into hating my wife. If you hadn't been deceived into hunting my wife down first, why would she have needed to use the mechanisms to kill? The death of those disciples is indeed a pity, but if we are to assign blame, He Wentian is at fault, and you are also at fault. My wife alone is blameless."

Wen Caishang was moved inwardly, her beautiful eyes filled with affection. She thought silently: "This little bastard is quite obedient and cute when it comes to times like this. If only he were like this every day." She let him handle it.

Duan Yixin said in a deep voice: "Brother Li, your words are incorrect. At that time, we caught up to your wife, but we didn't intend to fight immediately. This matter could have been negotiated, but Madam Wen triggered the mechanism to trap us. This..."

Wen Caishang smiled faintly. She looked at Li Xian to see how he would argue. Li Xian said: "You have numbers and strength. If my wife agreed to negotiate with you but failed to reach an agreement, and you suddenly attacked, what then? My wife is extremely delicate. If she were injured even slightly, how could that be?"

Li Xian continued: "Moreover, your sword sects are stubborn and unreasonable. Are you the type to speak reasonably? Elder Xiao Wanjian admitted himself that he is a粗人 (rough person). It is clear he is unwilling to reason, only wanting to vent his hatred and resentment. My wife is intelligent and cautious; how could she not understand this?"

Xiao Wanjian heard his name called out, and the words were extremely impolite. When had he ever been lectured by a junior? He was furious and immediately slapped the table, shouting: "Arrogant junior, we are here to..." He wanted to say, "We are here to negotiate with your wife, what right does a junior like you have to interfere?" But he had only spoken half the sentence when he felt a resentful gaze directed at him, emanating a chilling aura.

Recalling the scene just moments ago, Xiao Wanjian swallowed his words deeply and sat back down sheepishly. Wen Caishang said nothing, but gently kicked Li Xian with her toe, signaling him to continue.

Li Xian said: "Regarding the matters of the Tomb Vault, if we discuss right and wrong, my wife is undoubtedly blameless."

Wang Zongheng sighed: "Brother Li, this duel is not about life and death. There are indeed faults on both sides regarding the Tomb Vault. However, being in the Jianghu, right and wrong are only one aspect, good and evil are only the second; there is also righteousness and explanation... This matter truly requires a complete resolution."

The elders nodded slightly. Li Xian frowned and said: "In that case, this duel is unavoidable?" Hu Yueyue said calmly: "It is unavoidable. Brother Li has true feelings for Madam Wen and is a rare husband. I imagine you are worried about your wife's safety, which is why you are so tense. There is no need to worry about this. We have agreed that this duel will not decide life and death, because both sides have faults, and there is no need to add injuries. We will only decide victory and defeat, and use the outcome to determine right and wrong."

Li Xian asked: "What if we win?" Duan Yixin said: "It proves that our Five Mountain Sword Sects are greatly at fault, and the loss of disciples was caused by us. We will no longer pursue the matter of Madam Wen, and as an apology for the disturbance in the Tomb Vault, each sect will present a famous sword as a gift."

Li Xian said: "If it is just such a sword, it seems a bit lacking, doesn't it?" He casually waved the 'Yunyang Sword'. Xiao Wanjian's face turned iron-blue as he said: "Naturally, it will be better." He had specially sent the 'Yunyang Sword' originally as a probe.

Hou Yuande added: "This Madam is widely experienced; she should know what kind of sword we mean by a 'famous sword'. The 'Swallowing Mist Sword' of Hushan, the 'Forging Wind Sword' of Yangshan, the 'Suppressing Mansion Sword' of Jiushan, the 'Observing the Sea Sword' of Yueshan, and the 'Fire Li Sword' of Lishan. A sword of this grade, even for Madam Wen, I'm afraid it wouldn't be treated as worthless, right? Five sword sects presenting them together, the value is immeasurable, equivalent almost to... a divine weapon on the Divine Weapon List!"

Wen Caishang raised her eyebrows slightly, her expression calm and unfathomable. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance bases its sect on swords, and they indeed store famous swords within their sects.历代 (Through generations), "the sword chooses the person," passing down through generations. Although the five leading elders have high status, their personal swords are only ordinary. It is not due to lack of seniority or contribution... but because the sword did not choose them.

Li Xian asked: "What if we lose?" Hu Yueyue said: "If you lose, regarding the matters of the Tomb Vault where faults lie on both sides, we ask Madam Wen to provide some explanation to comfort the spirits of the many disciples."

Li Xian asked: "How to explain?" Hu Yueyue said: "Please ask the Madam to erect a monument and tomb for them, personally write the inscription, and include an apology in the inscription to comfort the departed souls." This was easy to say but difficult to do. Erecting a monument and tomb requires a vast amount of money, and writing an inscription that will be passed down with the tomb would leave a stain on her reputation.

Li Xian sighed: "In that case, you have already discussed this beforehand. This duel is already set in motion and unavoidable?" Wang Zongheng said: "It is unavoidable."

Li Xian said firmly: "Very well. But if we are to fight, I have one additional condition."

Wen Caishang was startled, thinking: "Strange, when did this boy become so honest? If they want to duel, that is their business. Why do you have to follow their words so obediently? Although those famous swords are not bad, why would I be tempted? If they annoy me, why bother with a duel? I could finish them off right now."

Wang Zongheng said: "Brother Li, please speak." Li Xian said: "You have five people from your sword sects, but my wife is alone. If we duel, I need to help my wife."

Xiao Wanjian said in a deep voice: "Little bastard, do you think this is the Tomb Vault? You are seeking death." Wang Zongheng said: "Brother Li is indeed extraordinary, but it is hardly appropriate to participate in this matter rashly."

Li Xian said resolutely: "Hmph, how could I not know? At that time, if I can block two swords for my wife, my life will be worth it."

The elders said: "This..." They were all worried. If Li Xian were injured during the duel, the situation might become uncontrollable. Wen Caishang had just revealed a glimpse of her ability with a light palm strike and a flick, showing that her capability was terrifying.

Hu Yueyue said: "Madam Wen... this matter is still up to you to decide."

Wen Caishang gently glanced at Li Xian, the corner of her mouth rising. She understood in her heart: "This boy went around in such a big circle, talking about this and that, just to participate in the duel. He dotes on that pair of eyes. As long as there is a duel, I won't easily gouge out his eyes." With great interest, she thought again: "This isn't harmful. I might as well agree to him."

She nodded and said: "Very well, let him be."

Hu Yueyue, Duan Yixin, Xiao Wanjian, Hou Yuande, and Wang Zongheng nodded in agreement and waved gently. The disciples behind them understood and took a few steps forward, taking out challenge letters and presenting them with both hands. Li Xian bowed to accept them and stood beside Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang smiled: "Since everything is settled, gentlemen, please stay. I will set a banquet to entertain you." The elders were surprised and said: "This..."

Wen Caishang smiled: "Elders, are you worried that I will use underhanded tricks? That is underestimating me too much. Caishang is sincere in her hospitality."

The elders could not refuse and agreed one after another. Wen Caishang called for "Xiao Tuan" and ordered her to contact the tavern owner to bring fine "tables" and "cushions," and to prepare chefs, ingredients, and fine wine...

Ten or so tables were set up beside the waterfall. The scenery here was serene, with floating snow, waterfalls, peach blossoms, green grass, and blue pavilions. Wen Caishang was dignified and had excellent manners. She drank and talked with the others, laughing and chatting as if there had never been any enmity.

Xiao Tuan also called ten or so people to repair the courtyard walls, fill in the holes, and paint them red. They were busy for a whole day. By evening, the elders of the five sects took their leave together. Li Xian and Wen Caishang rested in the viewing pavilion.

Li Xian removed Wen Caishang's hair ornaments and placed them neatly to the side. Her long hair flowed down, reaching her waist. Wen Caishang smiled: "You have quite the nerve. You dare to join in such a duel."

Li Xian said: "I know I am no match for them. Being a human shield, I suppose I can be of some use." Wen Caishang smiled嗔 (reproachfully): "If you really take two swords, let's see if you can still talk such big words."

Li Xian said sincerely: "Does the Madam doubt my sincerity?" Wen Caishang paused: "This boy is mischievous and naughty, but his sincerity is not false. He has saved me more than once." Her heart was sweet, and she smiled: "Alright, alright, I was wrong to say that. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance has a deep foundation, but these five elders, although senior, are not considered very powerful in my eyes."

"Take this opportunity to teach you some combat experience. But, Li Lang..."

She suddenly reached out and caressed Li Xian's face, saying: "Isn't it time you paid back your debt?" Li Xian remained calm: "As the Madam wishes." Wen Caishang swept her sleeve, and immediately four sword marks appeared on Li Xian's palm, all of them the "Heart-wrenching Sword."

Li Xian endured the intense pain, sweat beading on his forehead. The pain struck directly at his soul, lingering and difficult to subside, yet he could not faint. As time passed, the sensation of pain became clearer, making it difficult to even cry out. He tried to speak several times but forcefully suppressed it. Wen Caishang gently wiped the blood off the sword blade and said: "This is the true power of the Heart-wrenching Sword. I held back when I captured you before."

"I am happy that you stood up for me. But hiding other intentions? Do you think I can't see through that? That is just your foolish cleverness. From now on, you must repay five swords every day. I will not show mercy."

Once the pain subsided slightly, Li Xian said with difficulty: "Alright. I will listen to everything the Madam says. My life is already in the Madam's hands. Even if you killed me now, I would have no complaints."

Wen Caishang's expression softened slightly and she said淡淡 (calmly): "How could I kill you? Are you trying to make me feel guilty by saying such harsh words? You still owe one sword today. Raise your hand to receive the sword." As the fifth sword struck, the debt became increasingly complicated.

Wen Caishang said sternly: "Since you volunteered to fight, you cannot be negligent. Before the duel, you will practice the 'Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword' diligently. At that time, I will join you in a dual-sword combination to deal with the enemy. If you cannot defeat the enemy using the dual-sword combination and require me to help, I will see that your arrogance and conceit, your escape and bad habits, along with the unorthodox sects and martial arts you have learned, need to be completely corrected. At that time, your miscellaneous martial arts will be废除 (废除) one by one, and you will start training again."

"In these few days of spare time, you can only sleep for two hours a day. The rest of the time must be spent here practicing the sword. I will check on you occasionally. If you are lazy, the consequences need not be said."

She walked back to the pavilion with measured steps and went to the window on the second floor, lifting the curtain slightly to observe. Seeing Li Xian practicing hard with his sword, she let go of the curtain and sat down on the cushion to cultivate, practicing the Silkworm Cloak Jade Shattering Art internally. She is knowledgeable, but her personality is flawed. Seeing Li Xian's cunning nature, she felt annoyed upon reflection.

Li Xian knew the Madam's temperament well. Once the intense pain faded, he circulated his Qi to warm his body, picked up the "Green Sword," and practiced the "Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword." He waved the sword casually, possessing a unique charm that only he possessed.

Suddenly he thought: "The Madam might be watching secretly. This is my biggest trump card. To turn the tables, I rely on this sword technique. I still need to hide a bit." He deliberately concealed seventy percent of the sword technique. Only occasionally mixing in a few moves with that unique charm, maintaining a peak level.

Wen Caishang saw that Li Xian's Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword was indeed exquisite and pondered: "This boy's talent in the Way of the Sword is terrifyingly high. I taught him the sword technique for only a year or two, and rarely guided him in between. Yet he has cultivated it to the peak. My Frost Moon Void Sword, which he learned earlier, is only just 'perfect'. To reach the peak, I would need a stroke of enlightenment or a unique opportunity."

"He achieved it naturally, flowing smoothly, and his attainments surpassed mine. This talent makes me love and hate him at the same time."

She returned to the bedroom to rest lightly, occasionally hearing the wind of the sword blowing. Waking up in the middle of the night, she saw the candle had burned half through. She lifted the curtain and saw the young man乖乖 (obediently) dancing with his sword in the moonlight. Wen Caishang's gaze softened, and she transmitted her voice gently: "Come back and rest." Not long after, the door was pushed open. There was a blanket laid over the snow-white fur carpet. One could sleep as soon as they lay down.

Early the next morning, Li Xian was practicing sword in the courtyard again, tirelessly, diligent and hardworking, accumulating proficiency.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword · First Layer\]

\[Proficiency: 1253/0 Great Self\]

\[Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword · Second Layer\]

\[Proficiency: 1533/0 Great Self\]

Li Xian was immersed in the sword. A casual swing brought a warm breeze, melting the surrounding snow. Wen Caishang saw him training hard and thought of dual-sword combination several times, but considering Li Xian was becoming increasingly unbridled, it was not appropriate to be intimate with him now. She still needed to strictly discipline him.

At noon, she prepared a meal, carrying a basket of food, and called Li Xian to rest for a while and come eat. Li Xian was indeed obedient and immediately put away his sword and came over.

Wen Caishang opened the food box. Inside were eight exquisite dishes and a bowl of fresh soup. In terms of diet, she never treated Li Xian poorly. After责 (reproaching) him with two "Heart-wrenching Swords," she夹菜夹肉 (picked vegetables and meat) for Li Xian and ate with him.

After he ate and drank his fill, he went back to the courtyard to practice the sword. This continued for three days, day after day. Waking up early to practice the sword, Wen Caishang bringing food, repaying the Heart-wrenching Swords, eating and then practicing the sword, returning to the room in the middle of the night.

Wen Caishang saw that it was beginning to work. Li Xian was becoming more and more obedient. She thought silently: "It seems this plan is feasible. Back in the One Union Manor, this boy was my close attendant and could still obey well. Now that I want to discipline you, I will certainly make you submissive."

On the fourth day, the day of the duel arrived. Xiao Tuan prepared the carriage and waited in advance at the side door. Wen Caishang and Li Xian walked out together. Wen Caishang said: "Xiao Tuan, you stay in the pavilion and prepare for the moving matters."

Xiao Tuan said: "Alright." She bowed to Wen Caishang, dared not look at Li Xian, and ran back into the pavilion, avoiding the two. Li Xian brought a red jade horse stool. Wen Caishang stepped on the stool to board the carriage, leaving a footprint on the stool. Li Xian gently blew, dispersing the footprint on the stool, hid it under the carriage, and vaulted onto the driver's seat, pulling the reins and galloping out of the city.

The duel venue was set in the "Snow Hidden Mountain" outside the western suburbs. This place was remote, with a vast territory and dense vegetation. The duel between the two sides would naturally be unknown to outsiders.

The Five Mountain Sword Alliance figured that even if the five joined forces, they had no confidence in dealing with Wen Caishang. Moreover, attacking in a group, even if they won, would not bring glory. If they were defeated, it would be a lifelong shame. Hence, they chose a remote location.

Wen Caishang closed her eyes to rest. Today, her hair was tied up, fixed with a silver hairpin, with two strands of hair hanging at her temples, beautiful and dignified, not to be defiled. The carriage traveled on the yellow mud road, bumping occasionally, but she paid no attention, cultivating the "Silkworm Cloak Jade Shattering Art" internally.

She had been slack recently, and this skill had regressed slightly.

Suddenly, the road ahead was blocked by accumulated snow, making it difficult for the carriage to pass. Li Xian used the "Xun Wind Breath" combined with the "Iron Lung" trait, shouting and blowing hard, creating a hurricane that swept the accumulated snow away.

The carriage galloped forward. After passing, snowflakes fell and accumulated into a snow blanket again, as if this secluded path had never been trodden. After galloping dozens of miles, they arrived at the foot of Snow Hidden Mountain.

They saw a sword mark on the ground, pointing deep into the forest. Li Xian found a place to tie the horse and helped Wen Caishang down the carriage, following the direction of the sword mark. Passing through several layers of green forests, they saw a frozen lake.

The lake surface was covered with thick frost, as smooth as a mirror, and extremely spacious. Hu Yueyue, Xiao Wanjian, Duan Yixin, Wang Zongheng, and Hou Yuande were already sitting quietly on the ice. The five sat cross-legged, with swords resting across their knees. They had sat quietly all night, and a layer of snow covered their shoulders, heads, and sword bodies. Frost condensed on their hair tips and eyebrows.

The five sat at the five corners of the lake, forming a vague encirclement. Seeing Wen Caishang and Li Xian arrive for the appointment, the five opened their eyes and cupped their hands: "Madam Wen, Brother Li!"

Wen Caishang nodded slightly and looked at Li Xian, implying: "This battle is up to you. If you cannot defeat them, I will step in. But if you are defeated badly, showing arrogance and pride, the words spoken before will be counted."

Li Xian cupped his hands to the others and exchanged a few polite words. The duel began immediately. The five elders shook their bodies, and the snow on them was either shaken off or melted. Their eyes were sharp as swords, piercing straight at Li Xian's eyes.

Li Xian's unique eyes were not afraid of such a sharp edge. He held Wen Caishang's hand, the Green Sword unsheathed, and directly resisted the five elders' imposing aura. This battle was no joke; it concerned reputation, prestige, and explanation... The five elders had joined forces, so they had to go all out.

The moment Li Xian set foot on the lake surface, a gust of fierce wind blew over. Wherever it passed, countless sword marks appeared on the ice, turning it into ice shavings. The wind contained seven thousand and three hundred swords, each invisible and traceless, yet taking lives. Xiao Wanjian struck first! Wen Caishang looked at Li Xian to see how he would deal with it. Li Xian's heavy pupils had terrifying vision, seeing clearly the traces and directions of the seven thousand and three hundred swords. He used the "Turning Yin into Yang" of the Immortal Couple Sword to defend.

The Immortal Couple Sword is a combined sword move. Wen Caishang naturally followed his will, cooperating closely with him. The soft sword in her hand danced, pulling and guiding the seven thousand and three hundred swords, causing chaos in the inch-by-inch space and disrupting the sword moves' patterns.

One wave had not yet subsided, another arose. Wang Zongheng held a "Heavy Sword." This sword had no edge, but was as heavy as a thousand jun. Several swords swept over. Li Xian and Wen Caishang's two swords pointed at the heavy sword together. Wen Caishang's soft sword entangled, while Li Xian's straight sword resisted head-on.

Li Xian's cultivation was slightly weaker, but relying on Wen Caishang's momentum, the evolution of the Immortal Couple Sword was no less than that of a third-rank martial artist. Wang Zongheng's sword was blocked, and he saw the two attacking him with linked swords. Their sword techniques had their own characteristics and complemented each other.

Li Xian's Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword was at the peak, and Wen Caishang's was already perfect. Since ancient times, "combined" sword techniques are the hardest to perfect because of the complexity of human hearts. The two had extremely high talent. The moment they executed the sword technique, Wang Zongheng's heavy sword was already struggling to defend, retreating repeatedly.

The two seized the victory and attacked, working together. Wang Zongheng knew that relying purely on sword technique, he could not defend. He slammed the heavy sword hard onto the lake surface. With a "crack," the thick ice shattered, and cold lake water sprayed out. Li Xian wanted to pursue the victory when he suddenly felt a cold flash. A sword edge pointed directly at Li Xian and Wen Caishang's hands, intending to sever their connection and defeat them one by one.

Li Xian pulled his arm back, and Wen Caishang's light footwork was excellent, easily avoiding this attack. It turned out to be Hu Yueyue's "Water Shadow Moon Shadow Art." When this martial art is practiced to a high level and evolved to the extreme, one can temporarily hide one's body within water shadows!

Just now, Wang Zongheng smashed the lake surface, breaking the thick ice and causing water to splash. Hu Yueyue took the opportunity to use this technique, aiming for the vital point. She didn't expect Li Xian to be so sharp and Wen Caishang to cooperate so well, avoiding the move.

Hu Yueyue's figure flashed and disappeared. At this time, water droplets were flying in the sky. Her figure was hidden among them, appearing east and west, left and right. Every time she appeared, her sword moves were tricky and fierce.

At this time, Xiao Wanjian suddenly attacked, stirring up a storm of swords. The wind and rain contained infinite danger. Wang Zongheng recovered his composure and charged back into the field, powerful and fierce.

The three of them were attacking together, and the situation was extremely dangerous. However, Li Xian remained calm. The more he practiced with Wen Caishang, the more fluid he felt, and he felt extremely exhilarated. He had been lonely for a long time, practicing the sword in vain. Only when facing such a strong enemy did he feel truly satisfied.

Suddenly, the sky darkened, followed by an extremely strong light crashing in. Duan Yixin had suddenly struck, using the "Polaris Blazing Light Sword." When this sword was unleashed, it was like a blazing light illuminating the world. The light was dazzling and difficult to resist.

Wen Caishang turned her sword to receive it. Their positions changed, their sword techniques intertwined, and they didn't need words between them, as if of one mind, thinking what the other thought. Their moves were extremely默契 (tacit).

Duan Yixin, Xiao Wanjian, Hu Yueyue, Wang Zongheng... The four elders of the sword sects displayed their extraordinary skills! One's sword was like the day sun, one's fast sword was like a mad wind, one's figure was like a ghost, and one's heavy sword was unstoppable.

But see that despite all their tricks and power, Li Xian and Wen Caishang's dual swords blocked and dissolved everything. Although the enemy swords were numerous, they could not harm them in the slightest. The battle situation fell into a stalemate for a while. But relying purely on the "Immortal Couple Sword," it was not easy for them to win immediately. Unless Wen Caishang was willing to help, but although she was fighting the enemy with Li Xian, she was "intentionally" watching the show, hoping Li Xian would lose, and using this as an excuse to "correct his excesses."

As the battle continued, the situation suddenly changed. The sky darkened abruptly, and five towering mountains appeared from all directions, surrounding Li Xian and Wen Caishang.

It turned out that Hou Yuande was skilled in "Illusion Sword." During the fight just now, Wang Zongheng broke the ice, causing water mist to disperse. Hu Yueyue hid in the water droplets to move and entangle. Duan Yixin's sword shone like light, with great power. Xiao Wanjian's sword wind was fierce and violent. At this time, Hou Yuande施展 (cast) the Illusion Sword, utilizing the sword light of Duan Yixin and the scattering of water droplets from the lake, combining the martial arts visions of the five elders, cooperating tacitly, creating this illusionary vision.

Wen Caishang pretended to be regretful: "Li Lang, you are arrogant. At this stage, relying only on the Immortal Couple Sword, it is difficult to resist. You are about to lose. I need to clean up the mess for you."

Li Xian remained calm: "I don't think so." He thought in his heart: "Vixen, you dare to gloat? Once I finish dealing with them, I will deal with you too." He pulled Wen Caishang around his waist, and the aura around him changed.

The attainments of the Great Self Realm were revealed for the first time.
