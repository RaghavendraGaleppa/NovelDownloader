# Chapter 130: One Year of Cultivation, No Match for His Two Millennia of Dao Attainment?

The world fell into silence once more.

The silver-white true dragon transformed back into the form of a little girl, floating on the water's surface. She spat a few times, rubbed her bulging belly, and muttered something under her breath.

Li Zhengjing listened carefully and realized she was saying it didn’t taste good.

"If it didn’t taste good, why did you eat so much?"

With the small cauldron in his left hand, Li Zhengjing lifted her up with his right. Then he paused, staring at his right arm in surprise. After absorbing the vitality of the first-generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerate, his right arm had unknowingly fully recovered.

Gui Gu Lingguan approached, clicking his tongue in amazement. "The vitality is indeed abundant. No wonder that old monster managed to cling to life until now." He then examined the half-section of intestine in his hand, noting that despite being separated from its original body, it still pulsed with vitality, writhing faintly.

Li Zhengjing had obtained the Qingtian Dao Treasure, granting him astonishing regenerative abilities. The first-generation Heavenly Venerate, having acquired the corpse of the Qingtian Dao Venerate, had extended his lifespan by a thousand years using the remnants of the deceased. Even a half-section of intestine retained its vitality.

Yet, someone as formidable as the Qingtian Dao Venerate had perished in the river of time. The thought was unfathomable.

"Let’s head back," Li Zhengjing said. "I have a feeling that old monster’s return after a thousand years at sea might have deeper implications. In any case, the Central Continent is bound to face even greater turmoil and chaos."

With the dragon girl, Wall-Climbing Bird, and Gui Gu Lingguan in tow, he made his way toward the shore.

Although the first-generation Heavenly Venerate had complicated matters, Li Zhengjing had ultimately obtained the Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron. Initially, he hadn’t known the cauldron’s origins—even Gui Gu Lingguan wouldn’t have guessed at first glance, given the abundance of cauldron-type treasures in the world. But when the first-generation Heavenly Venerate mentioned the Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron, Gui Gu Lingguan immediately recognized it as the sacred treasure of the Nine Spirits Immortal Island.

"Logically, this should be kept within the Nine Spirits Immortal Island. How did it end up outside?" Gui Gu Lingguan mused. "Could it be that the island foresaw the calamity of the falling star and deliberately left the cauldron outside to preserve their legacy? But if so, why didn’t they relocate like the Imperial Bloodline Divine Clan from the Fallen Dragon Pocket Realm? Why wait for the celestial disaster to destroy their sect?"

"Just ask that half-dead guy," Wall-Climbing Bird interjected excitedly. "I’ve been studying the Great Zhou Dynasty’s various torture methods lately and have been itching to put my knowledge to use. If he doesn’t talk, I’ll let him experience my improved version of the Great Zhou’s Twenty-Eight Tortures!"

"The Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron was originally in his possession. He must know something," Li Zhengjing said, stepping forward and arriving at the shore in an instant.

At the shore, the Five Elements Creation Tree, Yuan Zhengfeng, and Wave-Severing Gu were gathered around the unconscious young man, discussing something.

"Master, he’s still unconscious, severely injured."

"Let me take a look," Gui Gu Lingguan said. After a brief examination, he reassured, "It’s nothing serious—just heavy injuries. I’ll treat him now."

As Gui Gu Lingguan worked, the others waited by the shore. Li Zhengjing examined the Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron in his hand. The golden page’s fortune-telling hadn’t mentioned the cauldron, only the Taiyi Sword Refining Technique—likely inscribed within the cauldron. However, the sudden appearance of the first-generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerate had been entirely unexpected.

The sheer power of a Sect Master-level figure left Li Zhengjing feeling disheartened.

"After our last battle, I gained that half-blade, amplifying the Great Void Transformation Sword Qi a hundredfold. I thought I had reached the ranks of the world’s strongest, yet in his hands, I felt utterly insignificant," Li Zhengjing sighed.

Gui Gu Lingguan’s voice sounded beside him. "How old are you?"

"Seventeen," Li Zhengjing replied.

"He’s two thousand years old," Gui Gu Lingguan said with a sigh. "How long have you been cultivating?"

"Almost a year."

"He’s been cultivating for nearly two millennia."

"But…" Li Zhengjing still felt inadequate.

"Don’t make me look completely useless, alright?" Gui Gu Lingguan snapped. "He’s the first-generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerate of the Crossing World Golden Ship! In their records, he was practically invincible. To later generations, he’s a legendary figure, the founder of their lineage. You, at seventeen, after a single year of cultivation, fought him to such a state. Right now, he’s probably the one feeling humiliated. And you’re still not satisfied?"

"I only countered him because of the Qingtian Dao Treasure," Li Zhengjing muttered.

"No one cares about the process—only the result," Gui Gu Lingguan said. "Today, the three of us joined forces and defeated the first-generation Heavenly Venerate. That’s the result!"

"Someday, I’ll face him one-on-one, fair and square, and beat him to death!" Li Zhengjing declared. "He’s the first person to make me feel this defeated."

"That day might not be far off," Gui Gu Lingguan said.

"That old monster clung to life using the Qingtian Dao Venerate’s corpse. Now that he’s returned to the Central Continent, will he go back to the Crossing World Golden Ship first?" Li Zhengjing suddenly asked.

"Not immediately," Gui Gu Lingguan replied. "The Crossing World Golden Ship already has a third-generation Heavenly Venerate. If he returns, where does that leave the current one? As a founder, he should remain a statue in their halls, not come back to seize power."

"What if the third-generation Heavenly Venerate dies?" Li Zhengjing asked pointedly.

"…" Gui Gu Lingguan understood his implication. "You mean, the old monster knows about the current state of the Central Continent—that the third-generation Heavenly Venerate is severely injured, perhaps even hunted by the true creditor—so he’s returning to take over? That makes sense. Back then, his departure to the sea was out of necessity, and there were other hidden reasons."

"He suffered a heavy loss at our hands. He won’t dare provoke us again anytime soon. By the time he recovers…" Li Zhengjing said, "we won’t have to fear him anymore."

Given the first-generation Heavenly Venerate’s current injuries, it would take at least a year or more for him to recover. But in just three months, everything would be different.

By then, Li Zhengjing would either have become Qianhuan Shenjun—or the one who killed Qianhuan Shenjun. Either way, the first-generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerate would no longer be a concern.

"The boy’s injuries are stabilized. He won’t die, but he’ll need a couple of days to recover," Gui Gu Lingguan said, glancing at the dragon girl. "When the underwater demonic immortal severed the Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron earlier, she broke the confinement, and the residual force affected him. The cauldron is fine, but his cultivation is weaker, and his soul was shaken. He’ll remain unconscious a bit longer—two or three days at most."

"Then let’s go," Li Zhengjing said.

His final task in Hongshan Town was complete. There was no reason to stay. His presence had unsettled the entire southeastern region, with factions probing for information while the newly appointed Jiangshang Prefecture Overseer and other deities dared not leave. Even Shi Yuan, despite his deference, must have felt suffocated under Li Zhengjing’s shadow.

Since the Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron’s arrival, external surveillance had been cut off, leaving factions desperate for answers but too intimidated to investigate directly. Only after Li Zhengjing reappeared in Hongshan Town did they dare to search—finding nothing until they ventured to sea and discovered remnants of a fierce battle, including the carcass of the eight-armed demonic immortal.

"The demonic immortal’s remains will attract creatures from beyond this sea. Those that consume its flesh may become demons in the future," someone remarked.

"This area must be strictly monitored. The Jiangshang Prefecture Overseer must pay close attention."

"The local officials in Hongshan Town are too weak. We should transfer someone more capable from within the prefecture, granting them greater authority."

"This must be reported. What exactly did Li Zhengjing summon with an hour of swordplay over the sea?"

"And the battle that followed involved far more than just the demonic immortal. The residual energy suggests a far more powerful presence!"

Discussions continued among the gathered deities, their divine senses intertwining. Meanwhile, outside Shi Manor, Shi Yuan prepared a carriage.

Previously, Li Zhengjing had avoided carriages for secrecy and to prevent them from being destroyed in an ambush. But now, with his reputation, few would dare intercept him openly.

"Immortal Venerate Zhengjing, I owe you my life. I have no way to repay you…" Shi Yuan bowed deeply. Though he wished to follow Li Zhengjing, he couldn’t abandon the legacy he’d built with his own hands.

"Thank you for your hospitality," Li Zhengjing said, tossing Shi Yuan a pouch containing spirit stones and cultivation insights for breaking through to the True Qi realm—a treasure for self-taught cultivators like him.

As the carriage departed, Shi Yuan watched Li Zhengjing’s retreating figure and bowed once more. Once proud and headstrong, he had managed to retain his dignity despite the overwhelming presence of the Immortal Venerate. Now, with Li Zhengjing gone, the manor felt empty.

With a sigh, Shi Yuan turned back, resolved: "This time, I *will* break through to the True Qi realm!"

Inside the carriage, Gui Gu Lingguan studied the half-section of intestine while Yuan Zhengfeng urged, "Put the intestine aside for now! Finish modifying my Stone Dragon body first!"

"Later, later…" Gui Gu Lingguan was wholly absorbed in his research.

The dragon girl, still bloated from devouring the massive demonic immortal, hiccuped uncomfortably, muttering about eating less next time since it didn’t taste good anyway.

The Five Elements Creation Tree lectured Wave-Severing Gu, while Wall-Climbing Bird sighed. "Without catching that fleeing Jiangshang Overseer, my luck absorption is too slow. Uncle, how can I restore the Hall-Sustaining Dragon Pillar faster?"

"Stop bothering me!" Gui Gu Lingguan snapped.

"Uncle! Uncle!" the bird wailed.

"I’m not dead yet—why the mourning?" Gui Gu Lingguan, exasperated, relented. "Didn’t you use the Gao clan’s blood, your own blood, and the spiritual energy gathered by the tree to speed it up?"

"But you said adding imperial fortune would make it even faster!"

"If you couldn’t catch the Overseer, that’s your problem. Why pester me?" Gui Gu Lingguan shoved the bird aside.

"The entire Great Zhou court is hunting him! I’m just an eight-year-old bird—how am I supposed to catch him?" Wall-Climbing Bird protested.

"Fine, fine…" Gui Gu Lingguan reluctantly produced half a vial of blood. "I used half. Here’s the rest. We can get more from the Fallen Dragon Pocket Realm later."

"Is this from the Imperial Bloodline Divine Clan?" The bird’s eyes lit up.

"It’ll help restore the Hall-Sustaining Dragon Pillar. If you’re brave enough, ask the little dragon girl for some blood—pure true dragon blood would be even better."

"No thanks…" The bird shuddered, recalling her recent fondness for roasted bird meat.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, serving as the coachman, examined the Nine-Chi Sacred Cauldron. He had also intended to study the half-blade within him, but it resisted his probing—its sharp aura overwhelming his senses whenever he tried. The cauldron, however, was far more cooperative.

"Did this thing come because of the Great Void Transformation Sword Qi—or the half-blade inside me?" Li Zhengjing wondered.

The cauldron’s material was extraordinary, capable of withstanding the amplified sword qi without damage. Its inscriptions were equally unique. He suspected it was connected to both the half-blade and the sword technique.

The half-blade was forged from Celestial Profound White Gold, a material not of this world—a divine immortal metal. If so, the cauldron must also be a celestial treasure from the heavens above.

How, then, had it ended up in the hands of the Nine Spirits Immortal Island?

The first-generation Heavenly Venerate had pursued it back to the Central Continent—and had tried to silence Li Zhengjing for it.

"Can the one inside decipher the inscriptions in the cauldron?" Li Zhengjing wondered.

Just then, a voice called from the carriage. The Five Elements Creation Tree shouted, "Master! The kid’s awake!"
