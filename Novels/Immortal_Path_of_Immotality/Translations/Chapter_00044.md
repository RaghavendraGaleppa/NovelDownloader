# Chapter 44: Awe-Inspiring Display Before the Multitude

In the end, Immortal Nan failed to escape into the forest, being exhausted to death outside the woods by the relentless assault of the crowd.

Everyone was immersed in the exhilaration of mortals overcoming and slaying an immortal master, their chests heaving with excitement as they fantasized about boasting of this experience upon their return.

But with Immortal Nan dead, another mysterious immortal master remained alive on the battlefield.

"Crunch~"

"Crunch~"

A young man in white robes slowly emerged from the forest, deliberately avoiding the corpses on the ground with each step, his feet crushing dry leaves and producing crisp, crunching sounds.

Over a dozen innate masters remained on the field, along with their thousand-strong followers. All eyes were fixed on this white-clad youth.

Fresh from battle, everyone was stained with blood, their auras chaotic.

Yet this man's white robes were spotless, without a trace of blood or wrinkle, his breath steady and his steps composed—utterly out of place amidst the surrounding carnage. Moreover, while everyone else stood frozen, he alone strode forward boldly.

"The hidden immortal master from the battle!"

Everyone guessed his identity, and varying degrees of tension arose in their hearts.

What was his intention? Did he plan to monopolize the Innate Vermilion Fruit? Should they attack him?

These questions swirled in their minds, but none dared voice them aloud.

At that moment, Protector Jiang and a black-clad innate master moved behind Lin Shan, followed by a hundred black-clad assassins, gradually forming a formidable force.

The other innate master was the leader of the Jiangling Nightingale branch, who had secretly coordinated with Protector Jiang to stand behind Lin Shan, clearly intending to latch onto this powerful ally.

With two immortal masters already dead and this one—who had connections to the Nightingale—still alive, it was only natural to seek his protection first.

...

Lin Shan slowly walked out of the forest toward Immortal Nan's corpse.

With two innate masters guarding him and a hundred black-clad followers in tow, his presence was undeniably imposing.

Yet inwardly, Lin Shan was nervous. After all, even Immortal Nan, a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator, had been overwhelmed and killed by sheer numbers. With only a fifth of his spiritual energy remaining, Lin Shan was at a critical juncture.

If the dozen innate masters before him decided to go all out and order their men to attack, he wasn't sure he could survive.

But since he hadn't revealed himself earlier and appeared completely unruffled, no one knew his current state.

Remaining calm and composed, he would seek fortune amidst danger.

That's right—he had his eyes on Immortal Nan's storage pouch!

Behind him, Protector Jiang, who followed Lin Shan step for step, was also feeling uneasy.

---

Having spent his life as an assassin, accustomed to lurking in the shadows, suddenly standing in the open under the gaze of a thousand eyes made the killer leader instinctively uncomfortable.

But seeing Lin Shan ahead, smiling confidently as if everything was under control, his anxiety quickly faded.

If the man he was relying on wasn't afraid, why should he be?

Protector Jiang aside, the Jiangling branch leader and the Nightingale followers behind him were even less concerned.

They had witnessed the entire battle from start to finish. Their immortal master leader had never even shown himself, yet he had manipulated Immortal Nan like a puppet, leading to his humiliating death at the hands of the crowd.

Now that the immortal master dared to step forward openly, it surely meant he had everything planned—victory was assured!

The others, seeing the hundred-strong force's imposing momentum and their leader's composed demeanor, dared not entertain any rebellious thoughts. The boldness they'd felt after slaying Immortal Nan was doused like a flame in cold water.

They could only watch as Lin Shan walked up to Immortal Nan's corpse and unceremoniously plucked the storage pouch from his waist.

The enhancement panel appeared as expected:

[Storage Pouch]  
Quality: Low-grade magical artifact  
Description: Storage space of three square feet; cannot store living beings.  
Enhancement cost: 8 points  

...

Suppressing his excitement, Lin Shan channeled spiritual energy into the pouch and scanned it with his divine sense.

Inside was a cubic space of nearly eight cubic meters, containing eight spirit stones, a jade slip, a few cultivation manuals, and some miscellaneous items.

Lin Shan didn't examine it further—now wasn't the time.

After cleansing the blood from the pouch with spiritual energy, he fastened it to his own waist and turned his attention back to Immortal Nan's corpse.

To his disappointment, the green talisman Immortal Nan had used to heal his injuries and the yellow talisman that had conjured the protective barrier were both gone.

"Perhaps they were single-use items or burned away after their energy was exhausted?" Lin Shan mused silently, unable to find them despite searching.

Rising to his feet, he ignored the crowd and walked straight toward the cold pond.

The innate masters tensed. What was this white-clad immortal master planning? Did he intend to claim the Vermilion Fruit for himself? If so, perhaps they could still rally their forces and attack while morale held...

Step by step, Lin Shan approached the pond, his pace neither hurried nor slow. He could feel the atmosphere behind him growing increasingly tense. The dozen innate masters were subtly preparing themselves, their followers tightening their grips on weapons.

With each step he took toward the pond, the murderous intent behind him intensified.

---

By the time the killing aura reached its peak, there was no doubt another earth-shattering battle would erupt.

The Nightingale members following Lin Shan were drenched in cold sweat, their backs prickling with goosebumps as they readied their weapons for a counterattack.

But at the critical moment—just as tensions were about to explode—

Lin Shan stopped.

The surrounding killing intent faltered.

Everyone watched his next move, the murderous aura lingering but not dissipating. The innate masters were clearly prepared for action.

Lin Shan halted because he had reached the corpse of Immortal Nan's sister, the blue-robed young woman.

Her brows were slightly furrowed, as if she had died with unfulfilled wishes. One arm was stretched toward Immortal Nan's direction, as though trying to grasp something.

Lin Shan didn't dwell on her appearance. He simply bent down, gently pried open her fingers, and picked up a red stone.

A fire-attribute spirit stone.

Lin Shan could sense the rich fire-attribute spiritual energy within, though it seemed only half remained. Without hesitation, he began absorbing it directly.

While the spiritual energies of the five elements could be converted into one another—as could the derived wind, thunder, and ice attributes—there was always some loss when a cultivator absorbed an element different from their own.

For example, the blue-robed woman, being a fire-attribute cultivator, could directly refine the fire spirit stone's energy.

But Lin Shan, a wind-attribute cultivator, had to first convert the energy, resulting in only 60% of the original spiritual energy being usable.

Still, something was better than nothing. Having checked the storage pouch earlier, he knew it contained only fire and metal spirit stones—not a single wind-attribute one.

He had no choice.

His immediate priority was to replenish his spiritual energy. The longer the crowd hesitated to act, the more energy he could recover—and the more confident he would become.

...

Meanwhile, the innate masters, poised to strike, were left bewildered when Lin Shan suddenly stopped to recover his energy by the pond.

They exchanged uncertain glances, silently debating whether to attack and who should make the first move.

But after a prolonged standoff, none dared to be the first to act.

This immortal master was too enigmatic. Thus far, he had only used wind blade spells—who knew what other tricks he might have?

More importantly, unlike Immortal Nan's close-combat golden spear technique, Lin Shan's wind blades were long-range attacks.

Against a melee fighter, they could still maneuver and fight back. But a ranged immortal master could pick them off like target practice.

Whoever acted first would inevitably become the sacrificial lamb drawing his fire.

And so, none of the innate masters gave the order to attack, and their followers likewise held back. They could only watch helplessly as Lin Shan stood motionless by the cold pond, steadily replenishing his spiritual energy.
