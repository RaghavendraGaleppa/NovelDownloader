# Chapter 223: The Divine Weapon Secret Realm

Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched the mechanical case on his back. This black steel case was equipped with a mechanism to conceal and store energy, completely locking the aura of the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane within it, revealing nothing.

Zhan Yan's face held a hint of emotion. "Besides the Dragon Scale Armor, the Divine Weapon Ridge has forged seven Divine Weapons. Three were destroyed in battle, while four still circulate within the major sects."

"It seems the Divine Weapon Ridge hasn't been able to keep a single Divine Weapon for itself."

Zhan Yan replied impatiently, "Do you think the extraordinary ores used to forge Divine Weapons belong exclusively to the Divine Weapon Ridge? They are only provided by the major sects, which gives us the chance to forge them. Besides..."

His expression carried a trace of sorrow. "From five hundred years ago to today, the Divine Weapon Ridge has not produced a single Divine Weapon. The Divine Weapon Ridge, which was once on the verge of becoming a first-rate sect, began to decline. We haven't even produced a Ninth Realm Qi Refining cultivator. Otherwise, how could that tragedy thirty years ago have happened?"

Pausing for a moment, Zhan Yan continued, "Since you have obtained the Dragon Scale Armor, you must have a way to suppress that object of Extreme Dao attachment on you."

Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched his chest, remaining silent.

The reason he could wear the Dragon Scale Armor was largely due to the skin of this Extreme Dao remnant helping him. Otherwise, he would have been burned to death by the armor long ago. How could he have施展 the "Lin" character seal and summon his own spirit to suppress the evil dragon's consciousness, thus subduing the Dragon Scale Armor?

Yes, subduing, not recognizing him as its master.

His aptitude was mediocre; those Divine Weapons basically looked down on him. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane on his back still refused to recognize him as its master.

Not to mention anything else, Xu Yunfan had perfected the three trainings of muscles, bones, and skin. He had cultivated the external three harmonies to the point of pure yang internal breath. In the muscle-refining realm, he had even infused strength into his flesh and blood, leaving no leaks throughout his body, moving toward the true power of a thousand jun.

These things only recognize bone structure!

As they were leaving, Zhan Yan looked at the nine-foot forging platform that was gradually sinking and let out a long sigh. "Now, the Divine Weapon Ridge is merely a symbol."

Just as Xu Yunfan was about to offer some words of comfort, the moment the nine-foot platform sank into the molten pool, a crack suddenly appeared above.

The edges of the crack were as if cut by an invisible blade, neatly revealing the world within. It was actually a valley surrounded by emerald peaks. Amidst the swirling clouds, clear springs cascaded down green cliffs. Ancient trees with roots intertwined for a thousand years had leaf veins that shimmered with a jade-like luster under the sunlight.

A gust of fresh wind blew out from the crack, quickly dispersing and erasing the red mist filling the underground cave. The originally scorching forging cave now seemed to have transformed into a blessed cave heaven.

Xu Yunfan felt the spiritual energy rushing at him as thick as honey. The scales of the Dragon Scale Armor on his body flared open, and his pores uncontrollably dilated. It felt as if thousands of fine needles were piercing his flesh, scouring away all the impurities deposited within his body.

"This is... the Divine Weapon Secret Realm?! How is it still here?!"

Zhan Yan's exclamation was swallowed by the sudden burst of wind howling from the crack. He couldn't even stand steadily and was forced back repeatedly.

Xu Yunfan's expression turned serious. He could clearly feel the Extreme Dao remnant worn on him like a vest suddenly trembling like a living creature. The originally soft skin like silk began to slide rapidly. The strange, slippery sensation where it touched his skin made goosebumps rise all over his body.

Sparks erupted from the interlocking joints of the Dragon Scale Armor scales.

He distinctly heard an ancient syllable explode deep within his skull, carrying the damp, fishy breath of a vast marsh, as if a giant dragon were swinging its tail deep within the clouds.

This Dragon Scale Armor, its spirituality largely shattered, was urgently urging him from the depths of his heart to enter.

And the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane was emitting a piercing clang from within the case.

The invisible force pulling from all three items left Xu Yunfan no time to find any leverage. He was lifted into the air and, in the next instant, thrown into the crack by an invisible force.

In the moment his vision flipped, he saw Zhan Yan's anxious expression, shouting loudly. He grabbed a nearby chain and threw it, trying to pull Xu Yunfan back, but it exploded into dust upon touching the edge of the crack.

Immediately following was the deafening sound of metal tearing. The black steel case on his back shattered instantly. The blood-red cane body, wrapped in blue-purple lightning and fire, shot up into the sky.

"Damn it!"

Xu Yunfan twisted his body in mid-air, channeling strength into his palm to push off. He instinctively covered the case on his waist containing the Ginseng Baby, holding it tight.

However, this凶兵 (fierce weapon), which had been passed down for six hundred years,划出 (drew) a bizarre arc in the air and plunged deep into the valley like a snake smelling blood.

The Extreme Dao remnant suddenly tightened. He clearly felt the Dragon Scale Armor seem to send countless golden threads piercing his entire body, forcing his aura to completely blend with the Dragon Scale Armor.

Xu Yunfan's blood energy seemed to flow into the Dragon Scale Armor along these vein-like golden threads.

The moment he landed, Xu Yunfan's feet carved out a three-foot deep pit. The soil beneath his feet was a strange dark gold, and flying gravel emitted sounds like clashing metal.

His pupils constricted. The waterfall a hundred zhang ahead was actually flowing upwards. The water droplets froze into countless ice crystals in mid-air, refracting a seven-colored rainbow light that enveloped a bronze altar.

The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane was inserted in the center of the altar. The crimson fire entwining the cane clashed violently with the rainbow light. The resulting shockwave snapped the surrounding ancient trees within a ten-zhang radius in half.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. A faint golden mist seeped from the gaps in the Dragon Scale Armor.

The spiritual energy that had just surged into his body was frantically scouring his bones and flesh. He could feel the shackles of the muscle-refining realm beginning to loosen. The pure yang internal breath, originally like lead and mercury—stagnant and only guided by his will—had actually gained a hint of agility.

But what concerned him more at the moment was the totem on the altar: a giant cauldron coiled by eight dragons. Cracks on the cauldron's body oozed liquid as black as ink, echoing the fierce and evil aura emitted by the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane.

The scales of the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly tightened.

Xu Yunfan instinctively rolled to the side. The spot where he had just stood exploded into a bowl-sized pit.

Looking up, he saw the rainbow light around the altar twisting into human forms. Seven skeletons clad in残甲 (broken armor) appeared out of thin air.

The weapons in their hands were all incomplete, but the vicious aura flowing along the残刃 (broken blades) made the Dragon Scale Armor tremble violently. The flaring scales emitted a buzzing sound resembling a dragon's roar.

"What the hell..."

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly, forming the Lin character seal with one hand in front of his chest.

"Lin."

With a soft shout, the moment the Lin character seal was formed, the buzzing in Xu Yunfan's ears stopped abruptly. The surging waves in his sea of consciousness seemed to be frozen by thousand-year-old ice. Deep within his sea of consciousness, his own spirit once again awakened and walked out of the rolling chaotic mist. It sat in the center, stabilizing all emotional waves. The originally fluctuating emotions in his eyes quickly settled, like a stagnant pool, calm and unruffled.

However, his blood energy exploded at this moment. The extremely powerful blood energy erupted with force far exceeding the past. Even the Dragon Scale Armor on his body flared open completely, releasing a scorching heat from the gaps between the scales.

He took two steps sideways, reached out with a hand covered in dark golden scales, and plunged it directly into the lightning and fire, firmly grasping the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane.
