# Chapter 46: Killing the Chicken to Scare the Monkey

"How did Elder Zeng get severely injured?" Chen Fei didn't state his demands first, but instead asked about Zeng Defang's incident.

"A group of people stormed into Elder Zeng's residence. Though there were guards, they could only ensure Elder Zeng survived!" Zhao Xia gnashed his teeth. To this day, he still didn't know who was responsible. The Zhao family was now intensifying their investigation, and if they found any clues, they would retaliate with fury.

Chen Fei remained silent, thoughts of Zhang Sinan and his group flashing through his mind. Since Dan Xiang would come looking for Chen Fei, it was natural that they wouldn't spare the elder physicians like Zeng Defang. Chen Fei just hadn't expected those people to injure Zeng Defang so severely. According to Zhao Xia, those people even intended to kill Zeng Defang directly. Was it to 'kill the chicken to scare the monkey'? Or had they lost all sense of restraint? Or perhaps they wanted to make the Zhao family short on pills, unable to fulfill their quota, thereby drawing the wrath of the rebel army?

"I heard there's a remnant formula for the Everfloat Pill within the manor. I wonder if I could take a look?" The Zhao family had increased the workload and said he could make demands. In Chen Fei's opinion, such an offer was mostly just a formality. If he truly proposed something significant, the Zhao family might not necessarily agree.

The aroma of medicinal herbs began to waft from the pill room. Chen Fei had just finished refining a few batches of pills when Zhao Xia returned, handing a pill formula to Chen Fei, along with the increased quantity of medicinal ingredients for the day. Chen Fei looked at the remnant formula in his hand with some surprise. The Zhao family was quite reliable; they said they'd give it, and they did. He wondered what kind of gains he would make after simplifying it later.

After refining pills for a whole morning, Chen Fei stopped. All the medicinal ingredients had been processed. Chen Fei placed the pills to be submitted into one drawer of the wooden cabinet, and the other pills into another drawer, then put the entire wooden cabinet into his spatial grid. Thinking of the cabinet filled to the brim, Chen Fei couldn't help but smile again. Previously, Chen Fei had worried that if he left Pingyin County, he wouldn't be able to carry many of his belongings. Now, with the spatial grid, Chen Fei could carry various pills and medicinal herbs. Even if he encountered unexpected situations in the wilderness, Chen Fei now possessed some ability to resolve them. Imperceptibly, this guaranteed Chen Fei's safety in the wild.

Cultivating his internal energy and practicing his moves, before he knew it, night fell. Chen Fei was contemplating archery techniques in the pill room when he suddenly heard some subtle sounds from outside the door. Chen Fei's expression shifted slightly. He picked up his longsword and walked out of the pill room, just in time to see a dark figure standing in the courtyard. The two guards of the Zhao family were already slumped to the side, blood continuously gushing from their necks. They were clearly beyond saving.

Zhang Xianping raised an eyebrow, a little surprised. Hadn't they said he was just an ordinary Skin Refining realm martial artist? Yet he could block his attack. Just as Zhang Xianping was about to change his move, a sudden alarm blared in his heart, and a streak of white light appeared before his eyes.

"Clang!"

The tip of Chen Fei's longsword struck against the dagger. A hint of alarm flashed in Zhang Xianping's eyes. If not for his extraordinary lineage and accomplished movement technique, he would have been utterly unable to dodge that last sword strike. Zhang Xianping glanced at Chen Fei with lingering fear. Such a sword move was not something a lone cultivator should possess. Even within Pingyin County, there shouldn't be such a legacy of sword techniques.

Realizing that the person before him was not to be trifled with, Zhang Xianping stomped his right foot on the ground, his body drifting backward like a willow catkin. Chen Fei's sword moves suddenly changed, like blooming flames, his sword technique instantly enveloping Zhang Xianping. With his movement technique obstructed, Zhang Xianping had no choice but to defend against the current attack. A moment later, Zhang Xianping subtly let out a sigh of relief. Although this sword move was extraordinary, it was still within an acceptable range. Now, as long as he guarded against unexpected sword strikes like the previous one, there would be no other issues.

The two exchanged hundreds of blows in the blink of an eye. Chen Fei gained a more comprehensive understanding of his current strength. The 'Immortal's Guidance' was undoubtedly still a powerful killing move, but for true Bone Forging realm masters, if a sneak attack failed, it was easily guarded against. After all, it was just one move without follow-up, making it easy for someone like Zhang Xianping to block one strike and be fine.
