# Chapter 69: Flying Wave Mountain's One Hundred and Eight Peaks  

"What? Removing my name from the Crimson Gold Registry costs seven hundred spirit stones?"  

In the Personnel Hall, Gu Yuan set down his spirit tea and stared at Qiu Mingshan in shock.  

Seven hundred spirit stones could buy a top-grade magic artifact plus a high-grade one. Even a typical ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator might not be able to produce such a sum without additional income. The price was simply exorbitant.  

"Junior Brother Gu, this is the Crimson Gold Registry we're talking about—the military roll for the academy's campaigns. Once your name is recorded, you must participate in at least three battles before it can be removed. Even disciples from noble families can't act as they please. This is strictly enforced by academy law. The fact that I can even find a way to remove your name is already remarkable."  

Qiu Mingshan took a sip of tea and sighed helplessly.  

"Is there no other way?" Gu Yuan pressed.  

"No. The only alternative is to earn special exemption by performing meritorious service for the academy, just like before. But this situation is different—it's far more complicated, and the academy is being extremely strict. Without seven hundred spirit stones, it simply can't be done."  

Qiu Mingshan shook his head.  

Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh.  

He currently had over a thousand spirit stones—enough resources to cultivate smoothly up to the eighth level of Qi Refining. There was no real need for him to participate in this conscription. He could simply continue his peaceful cultivation within the academy. After all, conscription always carried some degree of risk.  

He was no longer the penniless junior disciple he had been when he first joined the sect. There was no need for him to take unnecessary risks.  

The old ape had also been worried about this, which was why it had anxiously questioned Gu Yuan in the cave. At the time, Gu Yuan had spoken confidently to reassure the ape, but privately, he wasn't entirely certain. That was why he had come to consult Qiu Mingshan.  

Qiu Mingshan's answer left him with mixed feelings.  

On the one hand, it was indeed possible to remove his name. On the other, the cost was staggeringly high.  

Even after splitting the profits from the spirit stone mine, Gu Yuan only had fifteen hundred spirit stones. After deducting the expenses for cultivating the Heavenly Gaze and the Peach Blossom Sword Seal, he was left with just thirteen hundred. If he spent seven hundred to remove his name, he would be down to six hundred.  

That amount would make it difficult to cultivate comfortably to the eighth level of Qi Refining. He would likely have to venture out to seek opportunities, which might lead to even greater complications.  

With this in mind, Gu Yuan could only sigh. "It seems I'll have to go after all."  

His reluctance wasn't born of fear—he simply wanted to avoid unnecessary trouble.  

When he had been cultivating the Peach Blossom Sword Seal, he had already prepared for both possibilities.  

---  

"Junior Brother, if you're unwilling to be conscripted, do you have some unspoken concerns?"  

"From what I know, this conscription is different from the others. It would be best if you participated."  

Qiu Mingshan set down his tea and spoke abruptly.  

"No particular concerns. It's just that, under the elder's protection, I've acquired some resources and would prefer a more stable path."  

Gu Yuan's relationship with Qiu Mingshan was complex. Rather than concealing his wealth entirely, he occasionally revealed small hints to maintain his image.  

Sure enough, upon hearing this, Qiu Mingshan's expression turned envious.  

Seizing the opportunity, Gu Yuan asked, "Senior Brother mentioned that this conscription is different. Is there some hidden significance?"  

Qiu Mingshan sighed. "It's all because of the matter of the Ten Great Disciples."  

"The Ten Great Disciples?"  

Gu Yuan had read about this in the Scripture Pavilion, but the details remained unclear. He listened intently.  

"Indeed. The Ten Great Disciples, also known as the Ten True Inheritors, are selected periodically through fierce competition within the academy. This system is meant to foster exceptional talent and ruthless decisiveness, ensuring the academy's continued dominance."  

"After all, only turbulent waters can nurture dragons and beasts."  

"The competition for the Ten True Inheritors is brutal, but the rewards are extraordinary."  

"Just in terms of spiritual veins, they receive special privileges—each is assigned a third-grade spirit island for cultivation."  

"Moreover, all resources produced on that island belong solely to the True Inheritor."  

"If managed well, the island alone could provide enough resources to break through to the Golden Core stage."  

Qiu Mingshan's eyes shone with longing.  

A third-grade spirit island—such a place could sustain a Golden Core cultivator's needs. For a Qi Refining cultivator, it would be like living in paradise. Who knew how many rare herbs, exotic beasts, and spirit stones such an island could produce?  

Gu Yuan was equally astonished.  

He knew the academy was wealthy, but this level of generosity was astounding. To casually offer ten third-grade spirit islands—their foundation was truly formidable.  

"Haha, Junior Brother, don't get ahead of yourself. Focus on reaching Foundation Establishment first!"  

"Without that, you won't even qualify for the True Inheritor competition."  

"As for why this conscription is significant, it's simply because the rewards resemble those of the True Inheritors. There seems to be some hidden meaning behind it."  

Seeing Gu Yuan's stunned expression, Qiu Mingshan couldn't help but laugh.  

"Will they also bestow spirit islands?" Gu Yuan asked eagerly.  

But before coming to the Personnel Hall, he had visited the Hidden Dragon Academy and hadn't heard anything about such a reward.  

---  

"Not at all. Even with the academy's deep reserves, they wouldn't hand out spirit islands to Qi Refining disciples."  

"But the reward isn't far off. Do you know the destination of this conscription?"  

Qiu Mingshan chuckled and shook his head.  

"According to the Hidden Dragon Academy, we're to head to Flying Wave Mountain south of the Crimson Moon Great River, eradicate the demonic beasts, and reclaim the spirit mountain."  

"All spoils from the campaign will belong to the participating disciples."  

Gu Yuan recited the official notice.  

"Correct—all spoils belong to the disciples."  

"But that's just the surface-level reward. There's an additional benefit, which Elder Zhou will likely announce before departure. Since we're close, and noble families already know, I'll tell you in advance."  

"Flying Wave Mountain is rugged and treacherous, with one hundred and eight peaks. Each peak is inhabited by demonic beasts of varying sizes."  

"These beasts are all vassals of the Azure Fire Golden-Eyed Ape clan. They aren't particularly strong—barely sentient."  

"But Flying Wave Mountain is a genuine upper first-grade spirit mountain, rich in rare herbs and spiritual plants."  

"The academy has decreed that whoever occupies a peak and subdues its beasts will gain rights to all resources produced there—lasting until after Foundation Establishment."  

"Though each peak isn't vast, they are undeniably fertile. Most importantly, they provide long-term sustenance for Qi Refining cultivation."  

"How is this reward any different from that of a True Inheritor?"  

"With sufficient skill, one can seize a peak and secure resources beyond the reach of ordinary disciples."  

"Spirit stones are valuable, but nothing compares to spiritual land. The academy's greatest asset is its vast network of spirit veins and mines. Only these immovable resources can sustain so many disciples."  

"Isn't the academy's attack on the Azure Fire Golden-Eyed Ape clan precisely for these spirit mountains and mines?"  

"A single Flying Wave Mountain can support one hundred and eight elite disciples. Why wouldn't they take it?"
