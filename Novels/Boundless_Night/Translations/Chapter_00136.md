**Chapter 136: Taken Down**

In the vast, dark wilderness, a dense fog surged, and two youths were locked in fierce combat!

Qin Ming's left fist smashed forth like a blinding miniature sun descending, incinerating the night mist. Nearby vegetation disintegrated completely, its light dispelling the darkness and illuminating the entire area.

Yu Zhuohan did not retreat but waited there, choosing to confront his opponent head-on. Silver flames boiled on his palm.

Their fists collided, sounding like a clap of thunder in the night, a tremendous noise that echoed into the distance.

In the distant mountain forests, many fierce birds were startled, flapping their wings and soaring into the night sky.

Qin Ming's right palm descended, like celestial light pouring down from another world, its momentum even more astonishing. It triggered explosions, the compressed air bursting open, and the night mist completely dissipated.

This was like a divine punishment, descending from the night sky, sweeping away everything in its path, causing nearby rocks to crumble, large trees to snap, and swiftly explode into fragments.

Yu Zhuohan, ever proud and confident, used Esoteric Sect techniques to empower his physique, intending to have another showdown with Qin Ming in the Newcomer Realm.

From his palm, textured silver flames surged, and he once again chose an all-out direct confrontation with his opponent.

As their two palms clashed, streams of light scattered in an instant, like lightning tearing through the night sky, erupting with a deafening roar.

In the wilderness, their figures separated immediately after their first contact.

Yu Zhuohan spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, which landed in the flames surrounding his body and was swiftly incinerated with sizzling sounds. He stumbled backward.

Qin Ming pressed forward, incredibly dominant, still using his left fist and right palm. Golden light shimmered, and dazzling Heavenly Light Energy burst forth.

The night mist vanished from this area; under the illumination of his fist light and palm aura, every blade of grass and every tree was clearly visible.

Yu Zhuohan recognized the reality of the situation. He stopped trying to confront Qin Ming head-on; even with his innate abilities providing a boost, he was no match for Qin Ming in a direct fight within the Newcomer Realm.

Light emanated from his feet as he tried to distance himself from his opponent.

Qin Ming pursued, a tyrannical gale-force energy flowing around him. Wherever he passed, it was like a hurricane, twisting and breaking all the branches that blocked his path, leaving wreckage everywhere.

Silver flames swirled around Yu Zhuohan's sides, surprisingly forming a pair of luminous wings, composed entirely of fire. They carried him across the wilderness, his speed skyrocketing.

Though he couldn't lift off the ground and fly into the night sky, his body became much lighter, finally allowing him to escape the powerful opponent who was about to lock onto him.

Qin Ming stopped, calmly watching his distant opponent.

Yu Zhuohan was at a disadvantage and had nearly encountered danger, only managing to escape the predicament using Esoteric Sect techniques.

Nearby, many spectators showed surprise.

Qin Ming's combat power in the Newcomer Realm deeply shocked the group of youths from prominent families.

"An innate ability user is truly remarkable. To be able to tap into the spiritual power of the Night Mist World so early – ordinary people can only access it in the second realm," someone exclaimed.

The observers, naturally, had keen insights and well understood Yu Zhuohan's extraordinary nature.

It was just that his luck was bad; the opponent he encountered far exceeded his expectations!

The first two realms of the Esoteric Sect were called: Wisdom Light and Spirit Capture.

Wisdom Light primarily focused on accumulating spiritual intellect, a stage of building up before a major breakthrough.

Upon reaching the Spirit Capture realm, one could subdue baleful aura, earth essence, and other energies for their own use.

Innate ability users were rare. Such individuals inherently possessed a special ability, just like Yu Zhuohan, whose body was highly attuned to fire, allowing him to control flames very early on.

After joining the Esoteric Sect, he accumulated spiritual intellect and learned various techniques, directly allowing him to tap into stronger powers, possessing a small portion of the methods from the second major realm.

Yu Zhuohan took a deep breath, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth with his sleeve. Light emanated from his feet, and his fiery light wings vibrated as he advanced.

Qin Ming watched him. This was his first time fighting someone from the Esoteric Sect, and he truly wanted to observe all of Yu Zhuohan's techniques and study them carefully.

Under the night mist, the dew was heavy, and the grass blades in the wilderness were damp.

Qin Ming moved like a swift gale, stepping on the dewy grass as he charged forward.

Yu Zhuohan completely switched to Esoteric Sect techniques. A burst of fire shot from his fingertip, then clanged, transforming into a silver chain that emitted crisp metallic collision sounds.

The silver flame had solidified into a fire chain, looking quite realistic.

Among the group of youths, some followed the path of the Esoteric Sect. Upon seeing this, they could only sigh in admiration; someone in the first realm was employing techniques of the second realm.

The silver fire chain shot forth, aiming for Qin Ming's head!

Qin Ming raised his right hand, Heavenly Light Energy flowing, like the morning glow radiating from a fog-shrouded sea, blossoming with vibrant brilliance.

With a clang, he severed the silver fire chain with his bare hand, and as his right hand vibrated, a large section of the entire chain disintegrated.

Yu Zhuohan's expression remained calm. In an instant, his entire body glowed with silver light, and one silver chain after another flew out, coiling towards Qin Ming.

Under the dark night sky, silver light crisscrossed the wilderness, clanging loudly. It was like a net being woven, intended to ensnare Qin Ming.

Qin Ming was fearless. He didn't believe his opponent could endlessly conjure such a dense multitude of fire chains; Yu Zhuohan himself must be rapidly expending energy.

A golden light shield shimmered around his body; he stood unmoving in the wilderness, allowing the dense fire chains to swarm, yet they couldn't budge him.

Outside his body, the Heavenly Light Energy was three inches thick, continuously tearing and twisting the approaching fire chains, providing an effective defense.

If it came down to a battle of attrition, would he be afraid of his opponent? Let them come!

Boom!

Yu Zhuohan formed a spiderweb of fire chains, surrounding Qin Ming, pouring all his strength into it. He continuously threw punches, and balls of fire flew out, accompanied by flaming spiritual blades, overwhelming the opponent.

For a moment, the wilderness was illuminated brilliantly, and the night was completely dispelled.

Under Qin Ming's feet, earth essence surged. He circulated the Wuji Sutra, switching to a different protective art. Yin Earth Force and Yang Earth Force intertwined, flowing around his body, then transforming into Wuji Force.

Outside his body, a dense, surging yellowish-brown mist countered the countless flaming spiritual blades.

Immediately, the ground rumbled. Qin Ming seemed to merge with the earth itself. His Wuji Fist was as heavy as a mountain; as he swung it, it pulled all the dense fire chains around him, preventing them from maintaining their net form. They twisted, swayed, and gradually began to snap as his fist light moved.

With a clang of a sword, Yu Zhuohan, seeing that he still couldn't restrain his opponent, directly drew his sword. A crimson and brilliant greatsword emerged from its scabbard, illuminating the night sky.

"The Crimson Jade-iron Sword!"

Many of the youths in the crowd showed covetousness. This was pure jade-iron, unmixed with other metals, directly forged into a greatsword—quite extravagant.

The light wings on Yu Zhuohan's back vibrated, pushing his speed to its maximum. He held the sword with both hands, like a crimson lightning bolt streaking across the night sky, slashing forward!

With a boom, Qin Ming, with his powerful Wuji Fist, shattered all the surrounding fire chains. The dense, spiderweb-like silver light completely dispersed.

With a clang, he drew his Mutton-fat Jade-iron Saber, gripping it with one hand. Amidst the scattered streams of light from the disintegrating fire chains, he stepped forward and swung his saber powerfully.

Under the night sky, sparks flew. The two moved like lightning across the wilderness, rapidly shifting, their saber and sword constantly clashing, the metallic friction and impact sounds incredibly piercing.

"The jade-iron nurtured by the Esoteric Sect with special methods not only won't burn their spiritual intellect but can also protect them and enhance their power," someone among the spectators commented.

Jade-iron was a rare material with various extraordinary properties.

The Crimson Jade-iron Sword in Yu Zhuohan's hand erupted with fire, amplifying his innate ability. Each time he swung his sword, it unleashed a sky full of fire, pouring it forward.

Qin Ming was surprised. No wonder his opponent dared to clash swords with him again at close range. That Crimson Jade-iron Sword seemed to integrate Yu Zhuohan's powers from both the Newcomer and Esoteric Sect paths, stacking them, with Heavenly Light and strange firelight intertwining and bursting forth.

*Flap, flap!*

From the raging fire unleashed by Yu Zhuohan's Crimson Jade-iron Sword, fiery crows actually flew out, charging towards his opponent.

Qin Ming remained calm and unhurried, swinging his saber with his right hand and punching with his left, swiftly shattering the fiery crows, turning them into a large area of falling fire rain.

The Mutton-fat Jade-iron Saber in his right hand carried his astonishing Heavenly Light Energy, accompanied by a certain artistic conception, effortlessly carving out a powerful saber intent.

In an instant, the entire night sky seemed to be split open. The dazzling saber light, as if connected to the nine heavens' lightning, seemed to wield a certain power of heaven and earth.

*Clang!*

The Crimson Jade-iron Sword in Yu Zhuohan's hand nearly flew out. His right hand was bloody from a tremendous force, the soft flesh between his fingers torn open.

Qin Ming continuously swung his saber, striking down repeatedly. Vaguely, the entire night mist seemed to transform into a vast ocean, and the Mutton-fat Jade-iron Saber in his hand became a great sun, leaping from the sea, erupting with immeasurable golden light, cutting through the clouds and mist, stirring up monstrous waves.

The night mist surged, then with a boom, it was swiftly dissipated by the saber light.

With this strike, all the firelight on Yu Zhuohan's Crimson Jade-iron Sword extinguished, and he himself was sent flying horizontally over a distance, his arm spasming, nearly losing the greatsword in his hand.

This caused many people's expressions to change slightly, feeling the power of Qin Ming's saber technique, which truly had some of the bearing of a young grandmaster!

Qin Ming took a step, instantly arriving close, and swung his saber again.

For a moment, saber light illuminated the wilderness, revealing his resolute expression and also Yu Zhuohan's pale face, as the latter continuously coughed blood.

Yu Zhuohan had to employ a secret art again. Fiery light wings appeared on his back, boosting his speed and widening the distance between him and his opponent. Otherwise, if he delayed any longer, he might be shattered by the saber light.

Even so, his entire arm was trembling, flesh torn, and the wounds were deep, completely injured by the opponent's long saber.

The group of youths from prominent families were deeply shaken. Yu Zhuohan was extremely powerful, his physical quality approaching that of a supernormal being, plus he was an innate ability user, and with the added Esoteric Sect techniques, his combat power was exceptionally terrifying.

Despite all this, he couldn't stop Qin Ming!

Zheng Maorong felt a chill. This "old friend" hadn't been suppressed or crippled even in a remote place. If he truly rose in the future, would he come back to settle accounts with him?

The radiant Lu Yuzhi showed surprise. Qin Ming's performance would surely allow him to pass the assessment to become a core disciple of the Jade Pure lineage!

In the wilderness, Yu Zhuohan sheathed his Crimson Jade-iron Sword. Gritting his teeth, he stretched both hands towards the night sky, and then his entire body burst forth with brilliant silver light. He refused to lose; he had never tasted defeat before.

He had cultivated both paths, an innate ability user with exceptional talent, yet tonight he had suffered setbacks repeatedly. He was utterly unwilling to accept this.

He wanted to go all out, to fight to the bitter end. Even if he had to endure a severe illness afterward, he wanted to defeat this opponent now!

Yu Zhuohan roared, silver flames boiling around his body. The silver moon covering him grew even more dazzling, and then, surprisingly, it rose from him, detaching from his body.

Everyone was shocked.

Earlier, he had stretched his hands towards the night sky, making a gesture as if supporting the heavens; it turned out he was trying to lift this burning silver moon.

The night sky was illuminated brightly!

A silver moon hung high, no longer sacred, but with blazing flames surging, scorching the void, illuminating all things, and emitting an incredibly dangerous aura.

Qin Ming gripped his jade-iron saber, moving as if riding the wind, and charged directly forward.

Yu Zhuohan shrieked. The terrifying silver moon he held with both hands suddenly left him, flying towards his opponent, speeding across the wilderness.

Qin Ming dodged with a whoosh.

However, this silver moon was controlled by Yu Zhuohan's spiritual intellect, and it turned back again, descending upon him, radiating an extremely dangerous aura.

Qin Ming stopped. This time, his Heavenly Light Energy poured out without reservation. His long saber seemed to be melting, like a great sun traversing the sky, as he powerfully slashed out.

With a crash, he was sent flying backward twenty meters.

However, that boiling silver moon was also shattered by his strike!

Qin Ming's clothes were torn, looking a bit disheveled. The Heavenly Light Energy on his body had dimmed, indicating significant consumption, but it hadn't completely receded.

Therefore, he was not injured.

He raised his head, his eyes sharp as lightning. In an instant, his Heavenly Light Energy reappeared, bursting forth with even more terrifying light.

Qin Ming strode forward, and sheathed his long saber.

His Heavenly Light Energy boiled and intertwined, pouring out without reservation, flowing around his body. He clenched his fist and charged towards his opponent; it was time to end the battle.

"Ah..." Yu Zhuohan roared, his face ashen, as he struggled to conjure a second boiling silver moon and violently hurled it!

Qin Ming's three great miraculous arts, eighteen types of perfected Heavenly Light Energy, merged into one. No one could tell which school's energy technique it was. He strode forward, his right hand like a blade, directly cutting across the night sky, and with a crash, he shattered that silver moon!

Although he was subjected to a fierce impact, his clothes became even more tattered. However, he was not injured and did not stop, maintaining his speed like a meteor streaking across the wilderness, arriving before his opponent.

At this moment, Qin Ming's Heavenly Light Energy surged again. His left hand formed a fist and smashed forward, brilliant golden light erupting!

Yu Zhuohan's face was like gold leaf. He barely managed to conjure a third silver moon, but it was very dim, without any silver flames boiling.

As his opponent arrived, bringing with him terrifying fist light, Yu Zhuohan's silver moon extinguished on its own before it could even be fully conjured.

Qin Ming's fist, flowing with terrifying Heavenly Light Energy, smashed towards his glabella, then suddenly stopped.

"Ah..." Yu Zhuohan screamed.

The spiritual intellect accumulated by Esoteric Sect practitioners also involved the mental domain. Forced so close by Qin Ming's sun-like fist light, Yu Zhuohan couldn't bear it and fell backward onto the ground.
