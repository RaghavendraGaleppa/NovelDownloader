# Chapter 23: The Market

Though the sect provided safety, incidents like Fan Shaoming's case still occurred. Fan was relatively fortunate—while he lost his magic treasure, he gained the favor of an outer sect steward. However, one couldn't afford to be overly optimistic. Fan had merely been lucky; had the assailant struck with slightly more force, he would likely be a corpse by now.

"It seems I'll have to try my luck at the market," Gu Mo mused. With insufficient contribution points to exchange for the Concealing Qi Technique, he decided to visit the market to see if he could obtain a similar secret art.

The market wasn't just frequented by disciples of the Green Dew Sect—many rogue cultivators also came to trade there. In theory, any rare or peculiar item could be found in the market, though the probability of such discoveries was far from guaranteed.

Leaving the Hall of Merit, Gu Mo headed straight down the mountain toward the market. With the spiritual rice from his fields already harvested, a few days away wouldn't affect his duties. Moreover, he had long wanted to visit the market. Many tales of serendipitous finds originated from such places. While Gu Mo didn't expect to stumble upon any bargains himself, he was eager to broaden his horizons.

After a hurried journey that left him sweating and his spiritual energy nearly depleted, Gu Mo finally arrived at the market outside the sect. A pang of regret struck him—had he known, he would have exchanged contribution points for a paper crane to ride. But he quickly dismissed the thought. Using contribution points for something as common as a paper crane would be sheer foolishness. The same item could be purchased at the market for half the price. Given his current financial state, Gu Mo couldn't afford such extravagance.

Entering the market, Gu Mo found that it wasn't much different from the commercial streets he remembered. The central avenue was lined with various shops, many of which were affiliated with different peaks of the sect. For instance, the Alchemy, Artifact, Formation, and Talisman Peaks sold their surplus products here while also purchasing materials from rogue cultivators.

Other shops belonged to nearby cultivation families, and a few were owned by rogue cultivators with considerable strength. The majority of less affluent rogue cultivators set up stalls in a plaza at the market's edge—where most of the legendary bargains were said to be found.

Naturally, Gu Mo was intrigued, but first, he needed to sell some spiritual rice to earn spirit stones. While he didn't require spirit stones for cultivation, their uses extended far beyond that. The wards on his magical abode required spirit stones to activate, and future formations would also demand them. Moreover, with spirit stones, Gu Mo could procure items he currently needed—such as a paper crane for travel.

Using contribution points for a paper crane wasn't worthwhile, but that didn't mean Gu Mo didn't need one. If he could find an affordable option, he would certainly purchase it.

As a cultivator, traveling solely on foot lacked the proper immortal flair. While sword flight was undeniably elegant and dashing, his meager funds left him no choice but to settle for a paper crane. Besides, riding a crane still carried an air of immortal dignity.

After strolling through the bustling central avenue, Gu Mo eventually entered a wine shop run by a rogue cultivator. His reconnaissance had revealed the going rate for spiritual rice—shops purchased it at one spirit stone per pound, slightly higher than the sect's rate of three spirit stones for two pounds. Selling at a stall could fetch a better price, perhaps even reaching one and a half spirit stones per pound.

However, Gu Mo ultimately chose to sell to the shop. He planned to offload a hundred pounds of rice, and setting up a stall would take too much time. For many rogue cultivators, even a single pound of spiritual rice was a significant expense. Selling at a lower price to the shop was simply more efficient.

"Greetings, Immortal Master!" A young and attractive female attendant greeted him as he entered the wine shop. Her address made it clear she was merely a mortal.

In truth, mortals comprised the majority of the market's population, serving the cultivators who visited. Hiring mortals was far cheaper than employing cultivators, and these mortals hoped to catch an immortal's eye—either to embark on the path of cultivation themselves or to secure blessings for their descendants.

"I'd like to speak with your manager. I have business to discuss," Gu Mo said. The attendant was attractive by mortal standards, but she paled in comparison to Chu Feifei—especially when the latter's special constitution was activated, a state no mortal could hope to match.

"Please wait a moment, Immortal Master!" The attendant bowed and retreated to the back of the shop. Her role was limited to reception and minor transactions; high-ranking cultivators or large deals were beyond her purview.

"So it's a fellow Daoist from the Green Dew Sect!" A burly man in a short-sleeved robe soon appeared. Upon noticing Gu Mo's attire marking him as an outer sect disciple, his demeanor grew noticeably warmer.

Though outer sect disciples were often treated as mere labor within the sect, this was still the Green Dew Sect's territory. Most rogue cultivators preferred not to antagonize them. Moreover, an outer sect disciple proposing a business deal was noteworthy—it often hinted at backing from someone influential.

Having operated in the market for years, Gou Youyu was well aware of such nuances.

"Greetings, Manager!" Gu Mo returned the courtesy. The man was at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, and while his enthusiasm was puzzling, it shouldn't affect their transaction.

Surely, a bit of friendliness wouldn't compel Gu Mo to lower his prices. Spiritual rice was always in demand—wine shops needed it for brewing, restaurants for cooking, and even apothecaries for certain elixirs.

"Young brother wishes to sell spiritual rice?" Gou Youyu's heart leapt with joy upon learning Gu Mo's intent. Brewing consumed vast quantities of rice, and his current supply channels fell far short. Though a hundred pounds wasn't much, it likely represented a test from someone behind Gu Mo—and a hundred pounds for a trial suggested considerable resources.

Securing this supply line would be a boon for his shop. His address shifted from "fellow Daoist" to "young brother" in an instant.

"Indeed." Gu Mo nodded and produced two sacks totaling a hundred pounds of rice.

After inspecting the rice, Gou Youyu was delighted. The grains were of excellent quality—fresh from the current harvest. Previously, he had only been able to procure subpar or aged rice. High-quality new rice was rarely sold by the Green Dew Sect, as it was reserved for disciples.

Rogue cultivators hardly ever sold rice; most struggled to sustain themselves, let alone farm. Only a few cultivation families owned spiritual fields, but they prioritized their own consumption. Moreover, their output couldn't compare to that of major sects like the Green Dew Sect, leaving little surplus.

Only large sects like the Green Dew Sect produced enough excess to sell aged rice in markets like this. While subpar rice could still be used for brewing, high-quality grains naturally improved the final product.
