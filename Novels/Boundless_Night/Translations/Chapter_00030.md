## Chapter 30: Heroic and Spirited

Under the pale night sky, distant mountains loomed in layers.

Qin Ming was already on his way, treading quickly through the snow alongside dense forests. Silvervine Town was in sight, glowing with a soft light under a thin mist, the outlines of its various buildings visible from afar.

The town was bustling. Shops lined both sides of the street, their shelves packed with a dazzling array of goods. People came and went, and the calls of vendors rose and fell. Especially recently, many people had arrived from Crimson Cloud City, ranging from nobles to adventurers and even newcomers of unknown origins, all settling in various towns, which further boosted the town's popularity.

Qin Ming inquired briefly and soon found the old noble's mansion, which stood in the eastern district of Silvervine Town. The vermilion gate was grand, adorned with numerous copper studs, and a pair of auspicious beasts stood on either side, symbolizing peace and protection for the household.

"Qin Ming!" Many young people from various villages had arrived today, and someone called out his name.

Qin Ming immediately smiled in response and walked with a few newly arrived newcomers towards the old noble's residence. Someone was already waiting at the main gate to lead them inside.

The mansion was vast, with multiple courtyards laid out in an orderly fashion, featuring rockeries, strange stones, and pavilions. In the flower beds, only a few evergreen plants remained in this season. In this winter of scarce food, the old noble's life remained unaffected, clearly indicating considerable wealth and a knack for enjoyment.

The mansion's main hall was spacious and bright. While not exceptionally luxurious, its decor far surpassed that of an ordinary wealthy household. Grand pillars were carved with exquisite patterns, the furniture was made of top-grade mahogany, and the walls were adorned with evocative calligraphy and paintings.

The old butler was meticulous, greeting wave after wave of young people. The smile on his face never faded, as if it were fixed, and he maintained politeness and decorum throughout.

"Qin Ming."

"Er... Zhou Wubing." Qin Ming saw it was Er Bingzi and initially opened his mouth to say something else before changing his address. The other person had changed significantly after awakening; he was half a head taller than ordinary people and now a valiant young man. With so many people around, it felt inappropriate to address him by his old nickname.

"I'm going to Crimson Cloud City in a while. Do you have any plans, are you going to venture out?" Zhou Wubing's previously sallow hair had turned dark and lustrous, and his eyes now gleamed with radiant light.

"I also yearn for the bright cities in the distance. We'll see when the time comes," Qin Ming replied.

Many young people were in the living room, initially quite reserved. Compared to the blue-brick and gray-tiled houses they lived in, this place was adorned with carved beams and painted pillars, magnificent and opulent. The porcelain, calligraphy, and antique paintings on display clearly looked valuable, and they felt very unaccustomed to such an environment.

However, as time passed, they gradually relaxed, eating the fruits and pastries the butler had sent in.

Qin Ming was more at ease. To be able to eat fresh red berries in this snowy winter, he naturally wouldn't be polite, having come with the intention of freeloading.

"I'm not competing with you today. My relative said she would take me..." Er Bingzi lowered his voice but suddenly stopped.

He saw a silver-haired elder and a woman draped in a black fur cape passing through the courtyard, heading towards a slightly smaller living room.

"That's the noble lady of the Xie family. Although I haven't seen her true face, her figure seems exceptionally outstanding. Hmm, why did she keep a crow?" Zhou Wubing spoke, his words far more numerous than before.

"She doesn't seem to be struggling to find a husband either," Qin Ming muttered in a very low voice. He had seen this woman from a distance yesterday when Crimson Cloud City's higher-ups were negotiating with the abnormals in the mountains; she was also in that area.

Evidently, even his soft murmur was heard by the black-clad woman, who turned her head and glared at him. The brim of her fur cape was pulled low, and strands of dark hair shielded one side of her fair cheek. Qin Ming only saw a part of her melon-seed-shaped face, and her red lips seemed very vibrant.

"Hehehe..." The crow on her shoulder actually laughed, its sound indistinguishable from a human's.

Qin Ming found it strange, but ever since he entered the mansion, he had employed the "harmony with the light and dust" technique, concealing his vibrant and extraordinary vital energy.

"It must be a myna bird," Er Bingzi said, and then he too was glared at, but by the crow.

Zhou Wubing looked puzzled, saying, "Why is she dressed like that in her own home? Oh, I understand. She's about to meet us. Noble ladies are particular; they certainly won't show their true faces on a first meeting."

Afterward, both he and Qin Ming were glared at by the woman.

Qin Ming spoke in the quietest voice possible: "If you have something to say, say more." He wanted to test if the woman could hear him speaking in such a mosquito-like whisper.

Then, let alone the woman, even the crow reacted, this time letting out a cawing laugh.

Qin Ming immediately shut his mouth. He said nothing more. This woman seemed extremely formidable; her loose black fur cape could hardly conceal her beautiful figure. How could such a person be worried about getting married?

The other young people also discussed it, having already confirmed that the silver-haired elder was the old noble and that his daughter seemed to be remarkably exceptional.

"It feels like she's far out of our league. There's no chance," someone in the hall sighed. Although they had harbored some ideas when they came, they were now sobered.

Everyone present was a newly awakened individual, their perception naturally far exceeding ordinary people's. They could sense that the noble lady possessed extraordinary power, and even the crow she raised understood human speech, which was highly unusual.

Soon after, the old noble himself arrived. His name was Xie Jingrui, and his head of silver hair gleamed, his complexion ruddy, dressed in fine brocade. Seeing the young people stand up, looking a little awkward, he smiled gently and said, "You are all good children, clearly kind-hearted at first glance, much more honest than those 'flying eagles and running dogs' I've seen among young masters."

Xie Jingrui was remarkably candid, immediately stating his true intention: he genuinely wished to marry off his daughter, but also sought their help. He knew that this group of young newcomers would all enter the mountains, having long been selected by various great families of Crimson Cloud City to guide them.

"If you discover rare resources born within the nodes in the mountains, I ask for a favor, young friends. Please relax, don't be nervous. I'm not asking you to compete for them, merely to send word to me."

Old Noble Xie Jingrui admitted that he had connections with the nobles of Crimson Cloud City and simply wished to do business with them, wanting to purchase a specific rare resource he needed as soon as possible, fearing it would be traded away beforehand. This was because many organizations and forces had arrived this time, all having put out feelers to acquire rare resources produced in the mountain nodes at high prices.

Then, he clapped his hands, and some sharp knives, swords, and other weapons, undoubtedly valuable, were brought in. He invited the young people to choose one each, considering it a token of appreciation for their presence.

"My daughter has caused me endless worry. I genuinely want to marry her off as soon as possible, I'm so anxious. I truly don't look at background when choosing a son-in-law."

Xie Jingrui sighed, stating outright that as long as someone and his daughter were mutually agreeable, he wished he could arrange the wedding tomorrow, hoping the Xie family would flourish and prosper with many descendants. Towards the end, he even seemed a little melancholy, not as if faking it.

Was the noble lady of the Xie family truly struggling to find a husband? Many people began to doubt.

"Young men, I've heard of you two; both have a golden foundation, which is quite excellent. Have you considered a different path?" Xie Jingrui approached Qin Ming and Zhou Wubing with a pleasant expression, initiating conversation.

Soon after, Er Bingzi was led by the old butler to the backyard to meet the noble lady but quickly returned.

"Was it that black-clad woman? How was she?" Qin Ming asked him quietly.

"Dressed in black, valiant and spirited, extremely beautiful. But, alas, she's not suitable for me. You might consider it." After saying this, Er Bingzi hurriedly left.

Qin Ming hadn't come for a blind date at all, but he received a sturdy bow specially given to him by the old noble and was specifically asked to go to the backyard to meet the noble lady. Out of politeness, he couldn't leave early. He guessed that the mysterious black-clad woman had glared at him twice earlier, so she probably didn't have much goodwill towards him and would likely end the meeting quickly, just like with Er Bingzi.

A moment later, Qin Ming was led to the back of the residence.

In the mansion's backyard, a black-clad woman was practicing swordplay. The cold gleam of the sword was formidable, and she was indeed valiant and spirited.

Suddenly, Qin Ming was stunned.

It wasn't that the woman was ugly; on the contrary, she was incredibly beautiful. Unlike the usual delicacy of women, she possessed a rare heroic spirit, a very distinctive kind of beauty. However, her face was too large, not much smaller than a washbasin, her tall stature was almost five meters high, and the greatsword in her hand was over three meters long.

Er Bingzi hadn't seemed to lie; he had spoken the truth, just not mentioning her height and weight. The woman's name was Xie Lingxi, and the greatsword in her hand was longer than Cao Long's height.

Qin Ming realized what the old noble meant by "having a way to change his path." Was he suggesting that Qin Ming take the path of a Giant Spirit God?

"Do you also think I'm a monster?" Xie Lingxi asked.

Qin Ming immediately shook his head and said, "No, you are on the path to godhood, an immortal Grand Dao. Moreover, once you achieve the Giant Spirit God physique in the future, you can still revert to your original appearance."

"What godhood? If there really were gods, why wouldn't they hold up the sun and make it rise again?" The woman sneered, then resumed her sword practice.

Qin Ming turned to leave.

"I saw you two years ago. We came from Flowing Radiance City, passed through Fallen Moon City, and then Crimson Cloud City. We spotted you on the way; you were close to death then," the tall and slender Xie Lingxi, nearly five meters tall, suddenly spoke.

In an instant, Qin Ming's body stiffened, then he slowly turned around.
