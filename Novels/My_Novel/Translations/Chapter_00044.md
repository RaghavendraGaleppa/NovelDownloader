Chapter 44: Essence of Heaven and Earth, A Fine Appearance

Luo Fang felt his hair stand on end. He thought to himself, "This is terrible, truly terrible. What virtue or ability does this Li Xian possess? Has his family's ancestral grave emitted auspicious green smoke? How could he have caught the Madam's eye?"

"I offended him to the core before. In the days to come... my life will be truly difficult."

His heart was tormented as if by fire, yet he dared not make a single sound.

Li Xian followed the order and raised his head. Although he was young, his facial features were distinct and three-dimensional, his appearance exceptionally handsome.

"Truly a fine皮相 (appearance)."

Madam Wen did not withhold her praise, nodding and saying, "It's just that he is too tender. A few more years of growth, and he would be more to my liking."

Pang Long casually remarked, "Madam, I've long said that this小子 (lad) is the handsomest among the guards."

Li Xian replied modestly, "I dare not." But he thought to himself, "When did you ever say that? How come I don't know about it?"

As he raised his head, he finally saw the Madam's true face.

Perhaps this Madam had already reached the "Body Reforging" realm, as not a single trace of martial practice could be seen on her body.

Her figure was graceful, possessing a natural sense of dignity and elegance. Her skin was fair, yet it exuded a faint, cold, and detached luster.

He did not dare to look too closely at the details of her facial features and attire.

Li Xian only glanced briefly, not daring to scrutinize her. However, he did notice a teardrop mole beneath the Madam's right eye.

This added an extra touch of charm to her face.

He immediately thought:

"I've long heard them say the Madam is incredibly beautiful. Seeing her today, it's indeed true. Such a woman, in my two lifetimes, I have only seen once."

"Yet, despite seeing her today, though her beauty is extraordinary, she is ultimately just a 'person'. Not as terrifyingly mythical as they make her out to be."

He lowered his head again, only able to see the Madam's white skirt hem and the tips of her white boots peeking out from underneath.

"Every stitch and thread here is made of real gold and silver."

Li Xian muttered to himself.

More than the Madam's appearance, he was concerned about how much this outfit was worth.

Next came the distribution of the meat soup. Madam Wen had always been fair with rewards. Calling Li Xian over was not out of appreciation or importance.

How could someone of her stature value a mere guard? It was simply that rewards are given for merit and punishments for faults, nothing more.

Li Xian was well aware of this, feeling neither joy nor sorrow in his heart. This portion of refined food was something he had barely earned by risking his life twice. He felt no guilt in accepting it.

" Pang Long, take a piece of meat and give it to Li Xian," Madam Wen commanded.

"Yes!"

Pang Long did as he was told, placing a piece of refined food the size of a knuckle into Li Xian's palm, still dripping with milky-white soup.

The moment it touched his palm, Li Xian felt a jolt of numbness.

This alone showed how extraordinary this item was, its potency incredibly rich.

After distributing the meat, Madam Wen waved her hand. "Distribute the remaining soup as usual."

With light, graceful steps, her figure flickered and vanished in an instant.

"Li Xian, you rendered a great service this time with the refined food. Go ahead and ladle three bowls of the soup first, and eat it with the meat."

Pang Long said bluntly.

"Alright!"

Li Xian didn't act coy. He ladled three bowls full of the soup. Smelling its fresh fragrance, he couldn't help but swallow a mouthful.

This was the original broth, simmered for two days and one night. The base of the soup was extremely thick, almost like a gelatinous paste.

The soup distributed to the other guards was diluted and mixed with other herbs before being simmered again. Compared to the original broth, its effect was much weaker.

This was why Pang Long told Li Xian to drink the soup on the spot.

Li Xian held the large bowl and gulped it down in one go.

As the soup entered his stomach, it immediately turned into wisps of warm current, rapidly spreading through his internal organs. An indescribable comfort washed over his entire body.

[You have consumed a bowl of Snow Ape's refined food soup.]
[Skill 'Consumption' Proficiency +29]

But immediately after, Li Xian's expression changed. The wisps of warm current flowing through his flesh and muscles felt like a stream washing through the cracks in a mountain's rocks.

It washed away impurities while also nourishing his physique.

But soon after, it began to rapidly disperse out of his body.

His eyes, ears, mouth, and nose—the nine orifices of the human body—were like nine drainage holes.

"Commander Pang, this..." Li Xian looked at him in confusion.

"You felt it too, huh? An ordinary Clay Disciple can't hold onto this kind of energy," Pang Long laughed. "But it's still beneficial. An opportunity like this is rare. It's good to let you try it in advance."

Li Xian drank the second bowl.

Just like before, the soup entered his stomach and turned into an invisible warm current, spreading through his flesh and muscles. Then it flowed out through his skin and nine orifices.

This energy was an intangible thing.

It came in a tangible form but dispersed without a trace.

Although it couldn't be retained, it seemed to nourish his physique as it passed through his flesh and blood. Li Xian only felt a surge of vitality, his strength, bones, and meridians... all becoming more resilient.

He downed the third bowl.

Although the energy had dissipated, "Inner Qi" began to surge continuously from his Dantian.

Li Xian's mind suddenly stirred: "Does the flow of Inner Qi seem to be able to slightly influence the direction of this energy?"

"Does it mean that only when the Qi circulates through the Heavenly Circuit can one barely retain this energy?"

Unfortunately, this thing was like a gust of wind. It brought comfort all over the body when it blew in, but before one could react, it had already dispersed completely.

"Refined food is the most precious thing."

"When I was your age, I didn't even know what 'refined food' was."

"You could be called lucky, yet you encountered the Snow Ape and almost lost your life."

"But you could also be called unlucky, to be able to eat refined food at such a young age. In the neighboring Qingning County, many wealthy families have descendants practicing martial arts. Their families are rich, but even when they were teenagers, they might not have had the chance to consume refined food to strengthen their bodies."

Pang Long sighed with emotion.

This refined food was only the size of a little finger's knuckle, translucent and crystalline, like a piece of fine jade.

As soon as Li Xian swallowed it, his body trembled, his skin flushed red, and his blood energy flowed rapidly, like a surging great river.

Sounds of "cracking" came from various parts of his body.

[First time consuming Snow Ape's refined food]
[Skill Consumption, Proficiency +70]
[Skill: Consumption]
[Proficiency: 398/500 (Novice)]
[Description: A tiny Clay Disciple, pitiful and ridiculous. You can afford to eat it, but you can't keep it. There's nothing you can do. You continue to consume heavenly treasures, getting a first glimpse into the mystery of eating. Absorption effect slightly improved.]

Pang Long said:

"This kind of energy is called 'Essence of Heaven and Earth,' a necessary item for advancing to the Body Reforging realm."

"Although you can't retain the Essence of Heaven and Earth, the medicinal properties contained within the meat itself are enough to transform your physique."

"Just rest for the day. Don't practice martial arts or boxing. Let your bones and muscles adapt on their own."

The Essence of Heaven and Earth dissipated quickly, but the medicinal power contained in the meat continued to nourish his physique without end.

Li Xian lay on his bed, his vigorous blood energy overflowing. Perhaps because he was too young, he felt a restless, burning heat in his heart.

"I've only taken a small bite, and it already has such an effect."

"I really wonder how Commander Pang and the Madam... deal with it."

This was Li Xian's most well-behaved day.

By the next morning, Li Xian was rinsing himself with cold water by the well.

Washing away a full body of sweat, he felt refreshed all over.

He was surprised to find that he seemed to have grown taller. Li Xian, previously due to malnutrition, was slightly smaller and more shabby compared to other martial artists of his age.

Later, after becoming a guard, his height gradually caught up, but after all, it had only been a little over a month, and the changes were limited.

But this morning.

He was astonished to realize that in just one day, he had grown a full寸 (cun) taller, and his body had become much more robust everywhere.

"Wow, is it this potent?"

Li Xian threw a punch into the air, executing a move of the [Raging Bull Fist]. Its power and momentum were both more than thirty percent stronger than before.

[Raging bull roars, fist strikes like a bull, Proficiency +3]

The difference was not in his understanding of the fist technique.

Li Xian hadn't used his Inner Qi either.

It was the improvement in his bones and muscles that made his power gathering, punching, and stance recovery more fluid and seamless.

"Besides that, my Inner Qi has also increased quite a bit."

"I wonder how much further I am from circulating the Qi through the Heavenly Circuit now?"
