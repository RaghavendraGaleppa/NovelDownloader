# Chapter 40: Water Spirit Rice  

The perfected-level Cleansing Technique possessed marrow-cleansing effects—this was no secret among inner sect disciples. Several senior brothers had devoted considerable time to mastering this technique, aiming to reach perfection so they could leverage its marrow-cleansing benefits to build a profound foundation.  

Some succeeded, becoming the strongest among the inner sect disciples, while others failed, wasting precious time without achieving mastery and now languishing at the bottom of the inner sect hierarchy.  

The young woman also desired the perfected Cleansing Technique—it was practically a hallmark of prodigies. Only by possessing a foundation far surpassing one's peers could one truly be called a prodigy.  

The perfected Cleansing Technique was the most cost-effective way to achieve this.  

After all, aside from this technique, there were rare treasures that could grant such advantages, but these were far too precious—even inner sect disciples had little hope of obtaining them. The Cleansing Technique, however, could be cultivated by anyone—the only challenge was reaching perfection.  

As a bearer of a mid-grade fire spiritual root, the young woman was naturally talented, especially in comprehending fire-attribute techniques and spells. But this also meant she struggled with other elemental techniques, even to the point of seeming dull-witted.  

Thus, she knew full well that, given her circumstances, achieving perfection in the Cleansing Technique was impossible.  

Yet without it, how could she stand out among the elite inner sect disciples? Her experiences had instilled in her a fierce desire to grow stronger—only strength could ensure she would never be bullied and could control her own fate.  

But the perfected Cleansing Technique wasn’t something willpower alone could achieve. Zhao Qiancheng’s words, however, planted a new idea in her mind.  

"Junior Sister Yuan, is something wrong?" Zhao Qiancheng asked, noticing her distraction.  

"I just had a sudden breakthrough on a cultivation bottleneck," she deflected. Then, under Zhao Qiancheng’s guidance, she collected her allotted spirit rice.

**Marketplace**  

"Brother Gu, you’ve finally arrived!" As Gu Mo stepped into Gou Youyu’s wine shop, the man’s voice carried warmly from a distance.  

Without wasting words, Gu Mo produced 200 catties of spirit rice, while Gou Youyu promptly handed over 660 spirit stones along with a flask of spirit wine.  

With the transaction complete, a delighted Gou Youyu was about to chat and deepen their rapport when Gu Mo’s next words froze his expression.  

"Brother Gou, I won’t be selling Spirit Jade Rice anymore. Also, forget about that secret technique you were looking into for me."  

Gu Mo had decided to stop cultivating Spirit Jade Rice in favor of higher-grade spiritual plants. Naturally, he would have no more rice to sell. As for the concealment technique he had previously requested, he no longer needed it now that he had the Breath-Concealing Art.  

"Brother Gu, did I do something to upset you?" Gou Youyu asked anxiously. His shop had only recently gained some reputation thanks to the high-quality spirit rice Gu Mo supplied, which he used to brew premium wine. Losing this source now would be a heavy blow.  

This was tied directly to his income—as a rogue cultivator, his hopes for advancement rested entirely on this shop.  

"You’ve misunderstood," Gu Mo quickly clarified. "It’s just that Spirit Jade Rice is too low-grade. I’m switching to higher-quality spiritual plants. If you’re interested, I can sell you some of those instead."  

"Really?!" Gou Youyu could hardly believe it.  

High-grade spiritual plants would make far superior wine. He even had recipes for several premium spirit wines. As long as Gu Mo’s mysterious backer wasn’t growing anything too exotic, he could turn them into fine wine.  

"Of course. But high-grade plants won’t come cheap," Gu Mo warned.  

"No problem! As long as you can supply them, price isn’t an issue," Gou Youyu assured him. For lower-grade rice like Spirit Jade Rice, he had some connections to procure aged stock, but higher-grade plants were beyond his reach.  

Even if the price was slightly above market rate, he could accept it—premium spirit wine would bring in massive profits.  

Before Gu Mo left, Gou Youyu reluctantly produced a small flask. "Brother Gu, this is my personal reserve. Please pass it along to your esteemed backer."  

As a vintner, Gou Youyu had his own treasures, but he rarely used them—only taking a sip when breaking through minor cultivation barriers. This time, however, he felt it necessary to curry favor with the "powerful figure" behind Gu Mo. After all, a mere outer sect disciple like Gu Mo might not carry enough weight to secure high-grade plants.  

"Understood."  

Gu Mo accepted it without refusal—after all, how could a lowly outer sect disciple decline on behalf of a non-existent master?  

---  

Once outside, Gu Mo uncorked the flask. A fiery aroma burst forth, carrying an almost scorching sensation. Though no connoisseur, he could tell from the intensity alone that this wine was rich in spiritual energy.  

For cultivation, it would be quite beneficial—but Gu Mo had Solar Essence, which was countless times more potent. Drinking this would be a waste. Better to trade it with other cultivators.  

After a brief market visit, Gu Mo rode his crane back to the Spiritual Plant Hall. This time, he had learned his lesson—instead of selecting seeds before leaving, he waited until his return to avoid mishaps.  

At the seed repository, he chose a first-grade, high-tier spiritual plant: **Water Spirit Rice**.  

After careful consideration, this was his final choice. Unlike Spirit Jade Rice, which was dryland rice, Water Spirit Rice was paddy rice.  

Cultivating it required converting his fields into paddies, irrigated not with ordinary water but with spirit spring water or rain summoned by the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique.  

There was a spirit spring outside the valley, not too far from his fields, but its flow was insufficient for Water Spirit Rice. The deficit would have to be made up with his own rain-summoning efforts.
