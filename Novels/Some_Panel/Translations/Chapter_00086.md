# Chapter 85: Worldly Dharmic Manifestation

Yang Ji and his group exited the Dao Pagoda. They then used a teleportation array to reach the Pill Hall and collect their elixirs. All of them were at the peak of the Golden Core realm. Having passed the first assessment, they were now eligible to receive and consume First-Revolve Golden Cores.

The Dao Sect truly lived up to its name, grand in spirit and profound in its foundations. Even disciples like them, who had only passed the initial assessment, were provided with an abundance of elixirs. After an elder assessed your root bone and the cultivation technique you practiced, they would estimate how many elixirs you could refine in a year and then slightly increase that amount by one or two bottles. It was truly an unlimited supply, provided you could refine and absorb them quickly enough.

One must remember that the Dao Sect boasted millions of disciples, yet could still manage such a grand gesture, which clearly demonstrated the immense wealth of its reserves.

Yang Ji sensed that a First-Revolve Golden Core could provide him with roughly 300 cultivation points daily. However, this paled in comparison to the Ninth-Revolve Golden Core he had obtained under the undersea waterfall, which gave him 700 cultivation points daily. Still, once he broke through to the Nascent Soul realm, he would be qualified to receive Ninth-Revolve Golden Cores. With the cultivation technique already acquired, that day would come quickly.

Besides the Ninth-Revolve Golden Cores, the Dao Sect also offered Nascent Soul Pills, Soul Transformation Pills, and even Immortal Spirit Pills, all excellent elixirs for advancing one's cultivation. However, Yang Ji's current strength was insufficient to claim them. Nevertheless, if one found their cultivation too slow, they could undertake various tasks to earn Sect Contribution Points, which could then be used to exchange for these elixirs. Similarly, Sect Contribution Points could also be used to exchange for cultivation techniques, divine abilities, magic treasures, and other invaluable items.

Although the Dao Sect was powerful and had deep reserves, its resources were not bottomless. It was impossible to lavish massive resources on every single one of its millions of disciples; even a wealthy landlord would eventually run out of grain if it were squandered in such a manner. Therefore, the sect distributed resources in the form of Contribution Points, which also served as an indirect incentive for disciples to cultivate diligently. After all, the resources were laid out for all to see; if you had the ability, you could take them yourself. Such a cultivation platform was truly unique to the Dao Sect. In other places, even with power, there might be no avenue to exert it, and even with spirit stones, one might not be able to acquire what they needed.

After collecting their elixirs, Yang Ji and the others proceeded to the Personnel Hall to receive their sect robes and other various items, then returned to their living quarters.

Inside his palace room, Yang Ji began to examine all the items.

The Boundless Violet Robe, though only a peak-grade magic tool and not particularly high-level, served as a powerful symbol of identity. Wearing it publicly immediately identified one as a member of the Boundless Dao Sect, ensuring polite treatment from all major forces. Its significance was immense.

The Life-Death Talisman: If one encountered a life-or-death crisis, crushing this talisman would alert fellow sect disciples carrying similar talismans within a certain range. This talisman held immense significance; it might just save your life in a critical moment.

The Myriad Treasure Mirror was a low-grade spiritual artifact that Yang Ji valued most, primarily because of its numerous functions. This mirror resembled an iPad-like tablet. Through it, one could inquire about the contribution points required to exchange for various treasures within the sect, and it also contained the contact information for the sect's millions of disciples.

Yang Ji typed "Li Changxiao" into the mirror, and an image of a handsome face with a faint smile popped up. Next to his name was a note: [Currently in seclusion. Please leave a message if urgent.] Yang Ji immediately smiled and typed a message: [Your junior brother has arrived.]

[Message received. I will reply as soon as possible.]

Seeing this, Yang Ji smiled again, then typed another string of words into the search bar: [Items that can improve root bone.]

*Whoosh!*

The mirror's display instantly changed, showing numerous items with their descriptions. Yang Ji was overjoyed to see so many treasures capable of enhancing root bone, but a quick glance immediately made his face fall.

Spirit Cleansing Pill: [Extremely popular, sold out. Awaiting notification from the Pill Hall for subsequent stock.]
Spirit Ascension Pill: [Extremely popular, sold out. Awaiting notification from the Pill Hall for subsequent stock.]
Spirit Creation Pill: [Extremely popular, sold out. Awaiting notification from the Pill Hall for subsequent stock.]
Earth Spirit Milk: [Sold out] — this entry was grayed out, indicating it was a one-time spiritual item, rarely encountered and gone once used.
Nine Springs Spirit Water: [Currently being collected. Available for exchange in 300 years.]
Oak Spirit Fruit: [Sold out. Next batch matures in 500 years.]
Holy Splendor Fruit: [Sold out. Next batch matures in 800 years.]
Extreme Spirit Pill: [Extremely popular, sold out. Awaiting notification from the Pill Hall for subsequent stock.]

[Friendly reminder: To avoid missing exchange opportunities, please check the mirror regularly.]

Yang Ji was somewhat dumbfounded. He hadn't expected spiritual items capable of enhancing root bone to be so popular. He had been hoping to exchange for some spiritual items to improve his root bone, but it turned out others were even more ferocious than him in acquiring them.

Immediately, a long-unfelt sense of urgency surged within Yang Ji, as if he were back in Canglan City, where countless rogue cultivators staked out major shops to buy high-grade spiritual medicines and elixirs. Once they appeared, they would be snapped up instantly, giving him no chance to act. He sighed softly. "I should have known. Root bone is paramount. If one's comprehension isn't up to par, then good root bone is the only lifeline for staying in the Dao Sect. These people are truly desperate to improve their innate talent."

Yang Ji didn't harbor much resentment; instead, he recognized the severe reality of the situation. He touched his brow, realizing that the map Senior Chun Ye had given him truly had become his treasure.

Holding the Myriad Treasure Mirror, Yang Ji hesitated for a moment before typing "Fu Dongliu" into the search. However, the system returned no results. He had also never seen any mention of Fu Dongliu in the book *Cultivation World*, but he knew that someone capable of creating a Dao-grade cultivation technique like the Humanoid Weapon could not be ordinary. He speculated that Fu Dongliu might be his true name, and perhaps the book referred to him by a more revered title. Having inherited his legacy, Yang Ji was quite curious about him.

Finding no information, Yang Ji put the mirror aside and retrieved the fourth volume of the True Adamant Divine Art, beginning to cultivate it. His immediate priority was to break through his current realm. Only when his strength reached the Nascent Soul realm would he have greater confidence to brave the Hellish Grinding Field and locate the Purple Sun Tree.

As his divine sense delved into the cultivation technique jade slip, profound and Dao-infused characters transformed into a stream of light that surged into his mind, and he began to comprehend it. Two years passed in a flash as he immersed himself completely in this cultivation.

Two years later.

The true qi within Yang Ji's body vibrated wildly, every strand containing endless energy, now churning like an overturning river and sea, stirring up a surging tide. Yang Ji knew the time was ripe; breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm was now. He mentally roared, "Worldly Dharmic Manifestation, emerge!"

The True Adamant Divine Art was furiously activated, boundless profound principles imbued into his true qi. The true qi surged, beginning to condense the True Adamant Dharmic Manifestation. This process flowed naturally; Yang Ji's accumulation was too profound, his true qi too pure. In a mere instant, a Dharmic Manifestation, over three *zhang* tall, slowly solidified behind him with a rumble. The reason it was only three *zhang* was that Yang Ji was deliberately suppressing it; otherwise, if the Dharmic Manifestation expanded, it would surely punch a hole through the palace.

This Dharmic Manifestation did not have three heads and six arms, nor four heads and eight legs. It merely shimmered with the faint golden light characteristic of True Adamant True Qi. Its face bore an eight-tenths resemblance to Yang Ji's, simple and unadorned, yet revealing an extraordinary aura. Its muscles, finely etched like coiling dragons, were incredibly distinct, brimming with explosive power, truly living up to the name "True Adamant." As soon as it formed, it exuded an awe-inspiring and inviolable aura, its entire being permeated with rich spiritual charm and profound energy.

The Worldly Dharmic Manifestation was a symbol of a Nascent Soul True Monarch's power. It could connect with the grand forces of heaven and earth, allowing one to unleash instantaneous movement and extreme speed. At this level, a hundred-zhang-tall Worldly Dharmic Manifestation, wielding the power of heaven and earth, could unleash a casual punch that would kill ninety percent of Golden Core cultivators, unless they were super geniuses capable of fighting across realms. Yang Ji's Worldly Dharmic Manifestation, cultivated from the True Adamant Divine Art, one of the Boundless Dao Sect's ten top-tier Dao-grade techniques, was even more potent, far surpassing the likes of Gloomy True Monarch's inferior manifestation.

However, compared to those Worldly Dharmic Manifestations condensed from supreme Dao-grade cultivation techniques, there was still a gap. Yang Ji vowed to be among the strongest, but due to the limitations of his current cultivation technique, he could only achieve this level. If he could obtain the Buddha-Devil Scripture from the Buddhist Child and cultivate the Buddha-Devil Dharmic Manifestation, he would truly enter the ranks of the strongest. Within the same realm, he might not be *the* strongest, but he would be close.

Nevertheless, having reached this stage, though not perfectly complete, Yang Ji was already quite satisfied. He controlled the Dharmic Manifestation to sit cross-legged before him, meticulously examining it. It resembled a Vajra, indestructible, emanating a faint golden light, the distinctive glow of True Adamant True Qi. It sat silently before him, drawing power from the heavens above and the earth below, connecting with the world's forces, capable of unleashing the might of heaven and earth with every move.

One could theoretically condense countless such Worldly Dharmic Manifestations, provided one had abundant resources, as the Worldly Dharmic Manifestation was the basis for external avatars. However, generally, only cultivators at the Soul Transformation realm could achieve soul division. If a Worldly Dharmic Manifestation were imbued with a divided soul and further refined, it would become a clone sharing the main body's thoughts. But for Yang Ji, with his mid-grade root bone, cultivating even one Worldly Dharmic Manifestation had already taken half his life, and he had no energy to accumulate more true qi to condense additional manifestations. This was precisely the difficult gap between him and true geniuses. However, if he were to consume spiritual items that could enhance his root bone in the future, that gap would narrow infinitely.

The True Adamant Dharmic Manifestation excelled in raw power, possessing formidable offensive and defensive capabilities. Yang Ji calmly admired this masterpiece he had condensed when a sudden flash of inspiration struck him. He had a bold idea. The True Adamant Dharmic Manifestation was renowned for its fierce and powerful nature, and the Humanoid Weapon was also a supreme method for cultivating both soul and body. If the two were to merge, could they spark an extraordinary synergy?
