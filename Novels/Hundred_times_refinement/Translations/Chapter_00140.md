## Chapter 90: Ghost Extermination

Lin Xuan would not let the ghostly creature succeed. The heavenly treasure he had finally found could not be destroyed in front of him.

Lin Xuan's brow furrowed slightly, and he pointed his finger at the Bi Xue Ring, shouting, "Quick!"

Instantly, the sixteen smaller rings that had split from the Bi Xue Ring shone with brilliant light and hurtled towards the ghostly creature.

The speed of the top-grade spiritual tool was extraordinary, and in the blink of an eye, it caught up to the ghost, which was forced to stop and defend itself.

A mocking smile appeared on Lin Xuan's lips. He formed a strange hand seal with his fingers, channeling his spiritual energy into it, and then pointed at the Bi Xue Ring again.

A cluster of flames erupted around the Bi Xue Ring, with sixteen smaller flames dancing around it. However, these flames were not the usual red color; they were as white as snow, untainted and pure. The temperature around them didn't even rise.

The ghostly creature's face, however, revealed a look of fear. "Primordial flames!" it seemed to say.

Originally, only those who had reached the Foundation Establishment stage could manifest such flames. Yet, Lin Xuan, with the help of his top-grade spiritual tool and his refined cultivation, had managed to bring them forth.

The Xi Sui Dan had enhanced his strength, while the Human Ginseng Essence had purified his spiritual energy. Lin Xuan, with his refining ability, had been consuming these in abundance, making his spiritual energy the purest among his peers. Even compared to those at the Foundation Establishment stage, his was not far behind.

With the aid of his top-grade spiritual tool, Lin Xuan had successfully manifested the Primordial Flames.

Watching the ghostly creature's frightened expression, Lin Xuan took a deep breath and activated his Spiritual Control Technique, manipulating the Bi Xue Ring and its smaller counterparts to ensnare the ghost.

The ghost, naturally, did not wish to be caught. It opened its mouth wide, spewing out several streams of essence blood that mixed with the ghostly fog, forming a black-red shield.

"Go!"

Not wanting to linger, Lin Xuan dispatched the snow-white Primordial Flames towards the ghost.

The flames moved silently yet with incredible speed, leaving the ghost no time to dodge. They collided with the shield, and like melting ice, the shield's color rapidly faded. In an instant, it was on the verge of collapse. The ghost's eyes flickered with hesitation, but then it became resolute, opening its mouth again to spew out more essence blood.

The essence blood replenished the shield, restoring the parts that had been melted by the Primordial Flames. However, Lin Xuan was not impatient; instead, a cold smile played on his lips. The battle had turned into a contest of endurance, a test of their spiritual energies.

Lin Xuan's Primordial Flames, being manifested through a spiritual tool, held an initial advantage. With each stream of essence blood the ghost released, its cultivation level dropped. The outcome of this endurance test was clear.

Lin Xuan retrieved a crystal stone from his storage and held it, supplementing his spiritual energy. With this added insurance, his victory was all but certain.

As time passed, half an hour later, the ensnared ghost was drenched in sweat, its body shrinking.

"It's time," Lin Xuan thought, raising his hand to impart a spiritual decree to the Bi Xue Ring rotating in mid-air.

Within the white light, the Bi Xue Ring transformed into a crescent-shaped blade, emitting a chilling glow and a murderous aura.

The ghost's expression turned even more alarmed. Lin Xuan didn't give it any more time to think; he uttered a true word, "Quick!"

The crescent blade hurtled towards the ghost with a deafening whoosh, its sharp piercing sound sending chills down the spine.

The ghost, having lost the will to fight, ceased spitting essence blood onto its shield. It turned its body into a red light, attempting to flee.

"Too late to escape now!"

The sixteen crescent blades dispersed, surrounding the ghost from all directions. The Primordial Flames, having melted the shield, flew towards it, forming a net that made escape impossible.

Without any bloodshed, numerous negative energies burst out from the ghost's dismembered body. Its remains twisted, breaking down into individual yin souls that panicked and tried to flee.

This creature had been formed from the souls of fallen cultivators and the spirits of妖兽 (demons or beast spirits); now, it was being broken back down into its constituent parts.

Watching the fleeing yin souls, Lin Xuan grasped the Bai Hun Banner, waving it gently. Infused with spiritual energy, it was thrown into the air.

After absorbing sufficient spiritual energy, the Bai Hun Banner expanded from the size of a palm to several zhang in length and width.

Streams of black energy shot out from it, chasing after the scattered yin souls. They enveloped the souls, capturing them.

The yin souls struggled in terror, but it was futile. The Bai Hun Banner, a demonic artifact, was the nemesis of ghostly entities.

While dealing with the powerful ghost had been a challenge, capturing these residual yin souls was child's play.

The souls of cultivators and妖兽, not a single one escaped, were all bound by the black threads and drawn back into the Bai Hun Banner.

The banner, now having absorbed numerous souls, glowed with a dark, lustrous light, its power palpable in Lin Xuan's hand.

Lin Xuan's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. According to the demonic cultivation manual, the Bai Hun Banner's power was extraordinary, growing stronger with each soul it absorbed. Eventually, it could rival top-grade spiritual tools.

However, Lin Xuan had not refined it previously because, despite not being soft-hearted, he was not a ruthless killer either. Taking lives to refine the banner was something he couldn't bring himself to do.

Now, the situation was different. The souls he had captured were his enemies, and he had no qualms about absorbing them into the Bai Hun Banner. For enemies, there was no need for mercy.

Nearly a hundred souls, a considerable number, were absorbed, greatly enhancing the banner's power. After returning, Lin Xuan planned to refine it again, believing its power would increase manifold.

Although the battle had been perilous, the gains were substantial.
