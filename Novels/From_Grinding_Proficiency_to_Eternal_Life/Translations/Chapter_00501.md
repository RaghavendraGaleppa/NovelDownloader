# Chapter 501: Comprehension

With careful perception, one could naturally sense the changes within Han Shi.

A sword embryo, simple and unadorned yet radiating a terrifying tearing aura, had already formed at the core of his dantian's qi sea. It presented a flawless, perfectly rounded state, brimming with contained, magnificent power.

Every wisp of sword qi flowing through him contained the most orthodox and sharpest true essence of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

His progress was swift, his foundation solid, and his sword intent pure—far exceeding all reason.

"Hss..."

Xu Yunfan's main consciousness felt Han Shi's state and couldn't help but suck in a cold breath, a massive wave of astonishment surging through him.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Manual was vast and profound. Although it didn't involve the Golden Core realm and was merely a Foundation Establishment sword manual, it was still left behind by a Dao Lord, making its cultivation extremely difficult.

Even the core direct disciples of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect would need to spend a long time honing their foundation and comprehending sword intent.

This clone of Han Shi... was progressing far too quickly!

"This speed... is it too exaggerated?! It's practically a physique born for the sword... Wait!"

Xu Yunfan's thought suddenly halted as he reacted, "No! He is my clone! His talent... isn't it just my talent?!"

That's right!

Xu Yunfan slapped his thigh.

The clones created by the Cloud Library Avatar Technique reflect and extend portions of one's own origin in terms of bone structure, comprehension, and potential.

Han Shi's exceptional talent in the sword path meant that Xu Yunfan himself also possessed terrifying potential in the sword path that was hard for ordinary people to imagine.

"Tsk..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but mutter softly, a look of understanding appearing on his face.

"Then there's no problem. So... I'm also this fierce in the sword path?"

He had always thought his talent was mediocre, relying entirely on the panel to grind through difficulties. He never expected his true potential to be hidden in the reflection of this clone.

It seemed he still had much potential to tap into; he wasn't just the "mediocre talent" that Pure Yang Ancestor had claimed.

No longer paying attention to clone Han Shi's progress—which even made him jealous—Xu Yunfan's consciousness returned to his own body. He devoted all his mind and spirit to the most fundamental matter at hand: cultivating the *Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible Scripture*.

Previously, Pure Yang Ancestor had praised this scripture, though he bluntly pointed out that Xu Yunfan's talent was even worse than that of the Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces True Lord he had killed back then.

Xu Yunfan didn't deny this.

In the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, anyone who could form a Golden Core and become a True Lord was, without exception, a stunning genius.

Naturally, there were late bloomers, but that was also due to latent physiques that erupted in the later stages.

What Xu Yunfan cared about most was Pure Yang Ancestor's final evaluation.

"Don't look down on this true scripture. It once had a connection with the Dao Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect... Although this fruit position is immensely powerful... To reforge this fruit, one must use the true scripture as a vessel, step by step, rebuilding the rituals in the red dust of the mortal world... Even more so, one must use one's own Dao to penetrate the Celestial Dome of the Nine Palaces of Mystic Dawn... The hardship involved is even greater than moving mountains and filling seas!"

These words circled in Xu Yunfan's mind.

If it has a connection with the Dao Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect, it's possible that the creator of this true scripture was the Dao Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect himself.

If that were the case, then with the Dao Lord's lofty perspective, this true scripture would definitely be considered one of the top fundamental cultivation methods of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Back then, when the Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces True Lord was killed in three sword strikes by Pure Yang Ancestor, this true scripture fell into his hands.

If Xu Yunfan hadn't appeared, this true scripture might have remained in obscurity forever.

Xu Yunfan pondered.

"Pure Yang Ancestor is renowned in the mid Golden Core stage for his sword path, with incredibly sharp eyesight. For him to say this means the *Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible Scripture* must possess earth-shattering power! It is by no means inferior to any top-tier sword cultivator's path."

However, having said that, the difficulties mentioned by Pure Yang Ancestor were precisely something he could ignore, thanks to his attribute panel that continuously adds points and optimizes his cultivation path. As long as he could get started, everything would be fine.

Xu Yunfan cleared his mind of distracting thoughts and began to carefully comprehend the *Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible Scripture*.

After a long while, he opened his eyes and rubbed his brow, frowning slightly.

Could his talent and comprehension really be this poor?

I don't believe it!

"Lin."

A true word mantra fell from his lips like a cold spring from the ninth heaven. The qi and mechanism around Xu Yunfan suddenly solidified.

Turbulent distracting thoughts, like snow hit by boiling water, instantly froze and melted away.

All seven emotions faded from his eyes, leaving only the clarity of eternal, ancient ice.

The state of the Great Dao's Forgetfulness of Emotion had opened. At this moment, his soul was like a celestial盘 operating, deducing all things according to the Dao's tracks. His thoughts were like cold flames burning in the void, penetrating the true meaning without being stained by dust.

In this Lin state, comprehending the true scripture yielded twice the result with half the effort.

In an instant, the profound meaning of the scripture surged into his consciousness like a vast galaxy.

"Corresponds above to the nine layers of the highest celestial dome of Mystic Dawn, refines below the indestructible battle body of the celestial dome... Draws upon the nine layers of celestial thunderfire to wash and refine the five organs and six viscera.

Connects to the celestial cycle of Geng metal killing qi, forging bones, casting veins, and grinding marrow, making the flesh body transparent and flawless, as if divinely forged from heavenly iron.

Refines the skin like golden crystals, forges bones like divine jade, transforms the viscera into thunder ponds, and blood contains star flames... With a single palm strike, it can shatter the Mystic Dawn thunder; with a divine eye between the brows, it can split a thousand mountains...

The physical body's strength rivals that of a先天 spiritual treasure; all methods are difficult to invade, and water and fire are repelled!"

As he carefully comprehended it, a magnificent and vast true meaning continuously flowed through his mind, but it failed to stir Xu Yunfan's emotions in the slightest.

Under the笼罩 of the Great Dao's Forgetfulness of Emotion, his eyes seemed like a cold pond frozen for ten thousand years, with all thoughts condensing into ice crystals and sinking.

His divine sense operated like a precise celestial orbit, disassembling and deducing every word of the true mantra of the *Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible Scripture*. The process of Geng metal thunderfire tempering his flesh, blood, muscles, and bones turned into a stream of cold data, clearly laid out on his spiritual platform.

This was the manifestation of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's secret technique, the "Lin Mantra," which abandons the seven emotions and preserves only the Dao consciousness.

A divine sword without a scabbard will harm itself with its edge; a Dao heart without desire will ultimately become a顽石 and meet a natural end.

This realm of severing emotion and绝性 is truly a double-edged sword!

Xu Yunfan coldly and clearly observed his own body.

Every time he maintained the Lin Mantra, a part of the human warmth deep in his flesh would fade away. He would need a large amount of time to rest, strengthen his physique, and gradually regenerate the seven emotions and six desires with his body's spirit.

In the Lin state, Xu Yunfan remained without joy or sorrow, completely indifferent to the humanity being rapidly severed and faded within his body. He simply carefully pondered the true scripture.

The Lin Mantra was a supreme secret technique of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, but it had a major flaw.

If the Lin state was maintained for too long, one's human desires would completely vanish, and divinity would naturally arise. At that point, perhaps only a顽石 would remain, with no emotional fluctuations whatsoever.

If one has already reached the Great Dao's Forgetfulness of Emotion, then what is the meaning of pursuing longevity and the freedom of being carefree?

As time passes, what one ultimately faces is the destruction of the body and the scattering of the soul.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan quickly withdrew from the Lin state. He spent half a day to slightly recover, feeling the various emotions return to his heart before finally letting out a long breath.

He had maintained the Lin state for a bit too long; it took a full three days to gain some comprehension of this true scripture.

But the exchange was worth it.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the prompt on his attribute panel.

'You have successfully comprehended the Mystic Dawn Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible Scripture.'

Comprehension was achieved; all that remained was to begin cultivation.

However, he did not immediately summon thunder. Instead, he first repeatedly deduced the method of operating the true scripture in his mind several times, ensuring that every detail was clear and correct under the panel's auxiliary understanding.
