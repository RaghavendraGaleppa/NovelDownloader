# 1, Spiritual Roots

“Don't be afraid, just turn around, put the back of your neck towards me, and pull your clothes down a bit.”

This was the county government office of the magistrate of Dongxiang County, with wooden beams made of dark wood. The courtyard revealed a sense of solemnity and reverence. The magistrate, Song Tai, was currently bowing obsequiously, accompanying a white-robed youth with a Daoist-like demeanor. The youth was sitting upright on the grand master's chair, which was usually reserved for the magistrate, placed in the courtyard. Two white-robed figures, a man and a woman, stood behind him, and the magistrate had no objections, his face displaying a humble smile.

In the courtyard, there were no less than several hundred children, surrounded by bailiffs. Beyond the county government office were even more people.

A peasant couple was squeezed to the very front, now standing on tiptoe, their voices filled with delighted anticipation.

“Look, it's my child!”

“It's our kid’s turn!”

Standing before the crowd was a young boy, wearing clothes that had been shortened from his father's old garments, the fabric's mismatched colors patched together in large sections. This was a common sight among rural children.

This boy was named Li Zhiming. Ordinary farming families naturally wouldn't choose such a name. The boy was nicknamed Xiao Si'er, and his father, Li Chujiu, had given two steamed buns to a literate elder in Dongxiang to come up with it, intending for Li Chujiu to "know fate" and "accept fate" regarding this child.

Li Zhiming was a bit frightened. This was the annual selection by a place called the "Spinning Light Sect," which came down to choose children with innate talent to become disciples. For the uneducated, rural children who toiled in the fields, this was their only chance to leap over the dragon gate.

Li Zhiming walked forward, turning his back to the white-robed youth. The youth ran his fingers over the back of the boy's neck, but after only two breaths, he withdrew his hand and shook his head emotionlessly.

Before Li Zhiming could react, a tall and fierce bailiff grabbed his wrist and pulled him aside.

“Next!”

In a neglected corner of the county government office, Li Zhiming stood there, stunned.

That was… it?

Watching the other children continue to line up, Li Zhiming felt an indescribable emotion surge within his chest. It was as if a scene of immortal splendor had shattered before his eyes.

A child’s lifelong hope, so easily crushed.

Lowering his head as he walked out of the county government office, Li Zhiming didn't dare look at the faces of his parents, unsure if they were disappointed.

“It’s alright, child, let's go home.” Li Chujiu, his hands calloused, touched Li Zhiming's hair, his voice filled with suppressed regret.

To be chosen by the immortals and become a master of the Spinning Light Sect, in the last hundred years, Dongxiang had only produced five such individuals.

It was normal for their child not to be chosen.

But Li Zhiming stubbornly shook his head.

“Father.” His mother, Zhang Shi, shook her head. Her child was surely traumatized today, which was why he was acting like this.

But they didn't know that Li Zhiming was currently looking ahead, watching the children in the courtyard, his eyes beginning to feel increasingly sore, almost to the point of tears.

In the eyes of Li Zhiming, the 'world' in the courtyard was distorted, and from each of the small children in the crowd, black wisps of energy were beginning to inexorably surge forth.

Finally, these black energies formed… black words above their heads.

These were the things Li Zhiming had been able to see for the past half-month. Li Zhiming called them [Fates].

Li Zhiming was illiterate, but as soon as he saw these things, he could understand their meaning.

A month ago, Li Zhiming had suddenly suffered from an eye disease. At the time, everything looked blurry, a mass of black.

When his eye disease suddenly healed, Li Zhiming could see people clearly again, but he also saw with horror that rows of black, wriggling words appeared above people's heads!

Li Zhiming could immediately understand that these things were called "Fates"!

For example, at this moment.

The small, dark-skinned and scrawny child nearest the entrance, despite his best efforts to stand on tiptoe, was still completely obscured by the children in front of him and could not see anything.

Above his head, these things appeared.

Black, [Fate: Death in the Rice Paddies]

Just those six words.

Only those six words, devoid of emotion, numbly summarized a person's life; this child probably wouldn't know that his future would be such a scene, whether he worked hard after growing up or occasionally had some luck.

But just as he, like Li Zhiming today, was destined not to be chosen by the Spinning Light Sect.

Moreover, he would eventually overwork and die in the fields one day! Fate had already written his script in the future.

Looking further ahead, densely packed, above the heads of each person were rows of Fates that they were unaware of. At a glance, they were densely packed, mixed together.

[Fate: Early Death at Twelve], [Fate: Death from Tuberculosis], [Fate: Ignorant Village Woman], [Fate: Lifelong Servant], [Fate: Porter], [Fate: Rice Shop Apprentice]

Similar "Fates" like these were attached to everyone's heads like maggots, and no one was aware of it. They longed for the future, just like the children in the courtyard, standing on tiptoe, their faces filled with hope.

But from Li Zhiming's perspective, all that remained was a sense of preordained sorrow, even though Li Zhiming only vaguely understood this sorrow of fate.

Li Zhiming strained his eyes, but he saw that in this county government office, there were things different from the black Fates.

The magistrate, Song Tai, and those immortal masters who had come down from the Spinning Light Sect, with their refined and aloof countenances, had faint cyan Fates that they were also unaware of.

[Scholar], [Water Attribute Two-Colored Mixed Spiritual Root], [Wood Attribute Three-Colored Mixed Spiritual Root]

Looking at the faint cyan Fates, Li Zhiming stood on tiptoe, the emotions churning in his chest leaving him dazed for a moment, as if that was the fate and life he wanted to grasp but couldn't.

Finally, Li Zhiming lowered his head, dejectedly withdrawing his gaze.

Yes, they were, after all, the magistrate and the immortal masters.

How could their fates be compared to his?

“Child, do you want to go back now?” Li Chujiu, his skin dark and standing in place like an old tree stump, roughly touched Li Zhiming's hair with his calloused hand. He watched his child go from standing on tiptoe to drooping his head in dejection.

Li Zhiming nodded. It was time to go back. There was nothing to see here anymore.

Just then, Li Zhiming's gaze swept over the crowd, and he saw a small, fat child wearing brocade clothes and jade belts, snot running down his nose. Above his head, completely different from the dense black Fates around him.

He actually had the same faint cyan Fate as the magistrate, Song Tai, and those three immortal masters!

Faint cyan, [Earth Attribute Four-Colored Mixed Spiritual Root], Black, [Fate: Early Death at Twelve]

Li Zhiming blinked his eyes, looking several times to make sure he wasn't seeing things. He glanced back at Li Chujiu, who was about to squeeze through the crowd to go home, and suddenly tugged at his sleeve.

“Father, he is an immortal master.”

Li Zhiming pointed at the little fat boy, speaking in a very small voice.
