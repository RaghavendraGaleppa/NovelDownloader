# Chapter 3: The Bagua Mirror

The Blood Spirit Fruit was an extremely rare spiritual herb. Compared to obtaining one, all the hardships he'd endured were insignificant. Moreover, this particular fruit was on the verge of fully ripening, making it even more invaluable.

As a century-old spiritual fruit, even Foundation Establishment cultivators would covet such a treasure. At the sight of it, all of Qin Chong's pain vanished instantly. He immediately drew his Flying Dragon Sword and made several additional cuts on the Ironback Grey Wolf's carcass to hasten the blood flow.

Blood was the best nourishment for this fruit. Judging by the numerous old and new animal bones scattered around the pond's edge, many beasts had fallen here, their blood likely absorbed by this Blood Spirit Fruit.

After another moment, the fruit swelled to the size of an apple before stopping its absorption—it had fully ripened. Overjoyed, Qin Chong stepped forward to pluck it.

But no sooner had the fruit touched his hand than a voice rang out, chilling him to the bone.

"Drop the Blood Spirit Fruit, and I'll spare your life."

A young man in his twenties appeared nearby, appearing refined and elegant—except for the greed burning in his eyes. At the fifth level of Qi Refinement, with a blue flying sword as a mid-grade magical artifact, he far surpassed Qin Chong's capabilities. Worse still, the man could fly on his sword, while Qin Chong could not.

Fighting him would be suicide. Yet surrendering such hard-won spoils was unbearable. Moreover, the man would likely kill him anyway after taking the fruit. Faced with certain death either way, Qin Chong chose to gamble with his life.

Acting decisively, he mustered all his remaining spiritual energy and leaped into the Flying Cloud Pond. Ignoring the icy water, he dove straight for the depths.

"Tch. Some nerve you've got. Let's see how long you last down there," the young man sneered, making no move to stop him. Instead, he floated forward and perched on a boulder, watching the pond with detached amusement.

The Flying Cloud Pond wasn't particularly remote, nor were there many demonic beasts nearby. But the pond itself was peculiar—its water was unnaturally cold. No fish could survive here; any carried downstream by the river above would freeze to death within moments.

The instant Qin Chong hit the water, a bone-deep chill seized him, creeping through his skin into every limb. Only by quickly circulating his remaining spiritual energy did he stave off the deadly cold.

To his surprise, the water offered little buoyancy. Even without effort, his body sank rapidly. While diving had been a desperate ploy to escape his pursuer, what followed plunged him into greater peril.

As he descended, an overwhelming suction pulled him deeper. Struggling to resurface proved futile. Dread gripped him—had he doomed himself? His energy was nearly depleted: some warding off the cold, some sustaining his breathing. Without it, drowning was inevitable. At his level, prolonged underwater survival was impossible.

After sinking dozens of zhang, a new threat emerged. His wounds had begun bleeding, attracting a school of aquatic predators. Though not true demonic beasts, these shark-like creatures—each with stubby, powerful limbs—were deadly in their element. A dozen now circled him, waiting to strike.

"Damn rumors!" Qin Chong cursed inwardly. "Who said nothing lived here?" He vowed never to trust hearsay again.

But suddenly, the creatures grew agitated and fled. Turning, Qin Chong saw he was nearing the pond's bottom—where a glowing light pulsed. The suction intensified, yanking him downward.

With a heavy thud, he crashed onto solid ground, crying out in pain. He found himself in a stone chamber at the pond's base, barely a few zhang wide. The only exit was the glowing aperture above, now sealed by a shimmering barrier that held back the water.

Strangely, the airtight chamber didn't suffocate him. Clearly, this was the work of a formidable cultivator—their power beyond comprehension.

At the chamber's center stood a raised stone platform, upon which sat a skeletal figure. Though reduced to bones, the remains gleamed translucently, radiating spiritual energy. Qin Chong couldn't discern the deceased's cultivation level, but knew they had been a mighty expert.

Around the skeleton's neck hung a pendant—a pigeon-egg-sized disc bearing a faint yin-yang symbol. Its exquisite craftsmanship marked it as a rare treasure. Qin Chong's heart raced. Was the saying true—does great peril indeed bring great fortune?

As he reached for it, the skeleton suddenly emitted a gray mist. Qin Chong recoiled as the mist coalesced into a hazy, elderly figure. The apparition stretched lazily, as if awakening from long slumber, before fixing its gaze on Qin Chong.

Terrified, Qin Chong dropped to his knees. "Forgive this intrusion, Elder! I stumbled here by accident—"

The figure ignored his plea. With a wave of its hand, a powerful force struck—yet caused no harm. Instead, a blinding light erupted from Qin Chong's chest. An object shot out, spinning midair into the elder's grasp.

"The Bagua Mirror!" Qin Chong gasped. This artifact, dormant within him for years despite his failed attempts to wield it, had likely drawn him here. Now, its secrets might finally be unveiled.
