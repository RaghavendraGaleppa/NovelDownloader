# Chapter 37: Summoned by the Elder  

Upon hearing that someone dared to hunt down a disciple of their sect, the senior brothers of Qingheng Sect were filled with righteous indignation.  

This directly concerned their interests.  

If a junior brother was in trouble and the senior brothers didn’t help, then when they themselves encountered trouble, the sect wouldn’t assist them either.  

One disciple rushed to report the incident, while the others began to console Zhang Yan.  

"Junior Brother, don’t worry. Now that you’ve reached our market, you’re safe. Where’s the person chasing you?" asked a middle-aged senior brother with a sword on his back, trying to reassure Zhang Yan.  

"The one chasing me... well... he’s dead."  

Zhang Yan hesitated for a moment. There was no way to hide this, so he could only tell the truth.  

"What? Dead?"  

The senior brother was stunned for a second before nodding approvingly. "Good, good! Well done! Disciples of Qingheng Sect should be bold and decisive. Fleeing blindly isn’t our way."  

Instead of reprimanding Zhang Yan for killing someone, the senior brother clapped his hands in approval. "Wait here for the elder’s summons. After that, rest well. Don’t worry—the sect will handle everything and ensure justice is served!"  

Although Zhang Yan had killed a Zhou family cultivator, the matter wouldn’t end so easily. Ambushing a Qingheng Sect disciple was a direct challenge to the sect’s authority.  

The cultivator’s death was well-deserved, but in the world of cultivation, the sins of one often extended to their entire family.  

It wasn’t long before Zhang Yan was summoned.  

The elder stationed at Qingheng Market didn’t appear very old—around forty, with a refined and dignified demeanor, looking every bit the immortal cultivator.  

"Disciple Zhang Yan greets the elder!" Zhang Yan quickly bowed.  

"Mm, I’ve heard about the situation. Explain the details," the elder said casually, glancing at him.  

"Yes, Elder."  

Zhang Yan didn’t dare hide anything and recounted the entire incident. However, when it came to how he killed his pursuer, he glossed over the specifics.  

The elder gave him a deep look but didn’t press for details.  

A Qi Refinement early-stage cultivator killing a late-stage one was rare but not unheard of. A high-grade talisman or some special method could easily achieve such a feat.  

"Very well. The sect will give you an answer for this," the elder said after listening. "You may conclude your sect mission early. I’ll notify the sect to arrange your return."  

"Many thanks, Elder!"  

With a glance from the elder, Zhang Yan respectfully withdrew.  

---  

The sect’s senior brothers and sisters were very hospitable, preparing two rooms for Zhang Yan and Liu Yiting to rest.  

"That scoundrel was truly vicious! Look at this poor girl—she still hasn’t woken up from her injuries!" A senior sister helping Zhang Yan settle Liu Yiting into bed exclaimed indignantly.  

Zhang Yan could only offer an awkward smile in response.  

Before they could fully settle in, the sound of rushing wind echoed outside. Several figures on flying swords swiftly departed the market. Flight was normally prohibited in Qingheng Market, so these were likely members of the enforcement team, heading out to investigate Zhang Yan’s case.  

"Don’t worry, the sect will ensure justice is served."  

"Thank you, Senior Sister."  

Zhang Yan nodded, then retired to the room next to Liu Yiting’s to sort through his spoils.  

He took out a storage pouch—the one belonging to the red-faced cultivator. Since its owner was dead, the spiritual imprint was easily broken.  

Once opened, he eagerly examined the contents.  

The pouch wasn’t large, but it held quite a few items.  

Unfortunately, most were trivial odds and ends, including several spare robes. What disgusted Zhang Yan the most, however, was the collection of women’s undergarments in various styles and sizes.  

His expression darkened.  

It seemed the red-faced cultivator hadn’t been an upstanding person. With a grimace, Zhang Yan tossed the garments aside and focused on the valuable items: spirit stones, pills, spirit herbs, and magical artifacts.  

The spirit stones alone numbered over three hundred.  

There were also more than a dozen bottles of pills, each labeled. The most valuable were the Qi Condensing Pills, used for mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivation. The rest were miscellaneous auxiliary pills, totaling over two hundred spirit stones in value.  

Most of the spirit herbs were low-grade, so Zhang Yan didn’t bother calculating their worth.  

Finally, he turned to the artifacts.  

Despite being a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, the red-faced man had surprisingly few artifacts—only four.  

One was the nearly destroyed paper kite.  

The other three included a small earthen-yellow shield, a miniature mountain-like artifact, and a set of three flying needles.  

Excluding the paper kite, the remaining artifacts were:  

- The earthen-yellow shield (low-grade artifact)  
- The miniature mountain (high-grade artifact)  
- The three flying needles (mid-grade artifact)  

"Not bad at all. This haul is quite substantial!"  

Combined, these items were worth at least a thousand spirit stones.  

"No wonder so many cultivators turn to robbery. The rewards are just too tempting!"  

Zhang Yan sighed. Killing one person could yield profits equivalent to a year or more of hard work.  

"But this path isn’t for me."  

He had no interest in plundering others. With his cheat-like abilities, there was no need to take such risks.  

Once he returned to the sect, he resolved to focus on peaceful cultivation within its walls, only venturing out when absolutely necessary.  

"Speaking of which, these artifacts are quite useful."  

Zhang Yan examined the three artifacts. The earthen-yellow shield, despite being low-grade, had decent attributes.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Earth Essence Shield  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Green  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Defense Boost** (Slightly increases your defense.)  
- **Force Dispersion** (When attacked, you can mitigate a portion of the damage.)  

With this, his survivability would improve.  

As for the miniature mountain and flying needles, their attributes were mediocre, so Zhang Yan planned to sell them later.  

"While I have time, I should test these pills."  

He pulled out the silly bird from his sleeve, which curiously looked around as Zhang Yan took out a Qi Gathering Pill and broke off a small piece.  

Before he could offer it, the bird eagerly pecked it from his fingers.  

But as soon as it swallowed the pill, something unexpected happened.
