# Chapter 22: Talismans and the Wooden Sword  

"Is this the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit?" Chu Ning asked with slight surprise. Old Man Sun chuckled in response.  

"Indeed, this is the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit. I stumbled upon it by chance and have spent considerable effort nurturing it."  

"Truly extraordinary," Chu Ning mused inwardly, though he refrained from asking about the fruit's properties or how Old Man Sun had acquired it.  

Under the old man's watchful gaze, Chu Ning formed hand seals and cast the Verdant Spring Technique. Unlike simpler spells like the Growth Technique, this one required more time to activate. However, after daily practice, Chu Ning had honed his proficiency to an impressive level. Moreover, his version of the technique consumed less spiritual energy than most, allowing him to perform it even after having already cast the Growth Technique ten times earlier.  

Old Man Sun's eyes gleamed as he observed the dense spiritual energy gathering around Chu Ning's hands—a clear sign of mastery.  

Chu Ning cast the Verdant Spring Technique ten times in succession. Gradually, the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit's multicolored leaves began emitting a faint glow.  

Overjoyed, Old Man Sun expressed his gratitude and handed Chu Ning three spirit stones and a small jade vial.  

"Fellow Daoist Wu, here are three spirit stones and a Replenishment Pill as today's payment. The extra spirit stone is an advance for tomorrow. Please return on time and keep this matter confidential."  

"Wu" was the false name Chu Ning had given earlier to conceal his true identity and cultivation level. He nodded in agreement.  

"Since I've given my word, I'll return as promised. For now, I'd appreciate a quiet place to meditate and restore my energy."  

Old Man Sun led him to a secluded room. Chu Ning examined the Replenishment Pill before swallowing it—a common restorative pill effective for Qi Refining cultivators in the early and middle stages.  

Within a quarter-hour, his energy was fully replenished.  

"The Replenishment Pill works remarkably well," Chu Ning noted. "Next time, I should save it for emergencies rather than using it immediately."  

After bidding farewell to Old Man Sun, who reminded him once more about discretion, Chu Ning left the shop. By then, he had already missed his meeting with Qiu Shunyi and his companion, so he activated the Windstride Technique and headed straight back to the mountain.  

The journey of a hundred li took him less than an hour.  

Over the following days, Chu Ning tended to his Ink Bamboo and spirit rice fields before heading to Old Man Sun's shop to earn more spirit stones. The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit visibly ripened under his repeated applications of the Verdant Spring Technique.  

On the final day, the fruit beneath the radiant leaves had plumped to a deep red, exuding a rich spiritual aura. Old Man Sun, now exceedingly pleased, served him spirit tea and presented two additional spirit stones and two more Replenishment Pills.  

"Fellow Daoist Chu, you've already received nineteen spirit stones. These extra two stones and pills are my thanks for your efforts over these ten days."  

Chu Ning accepted them without hesitation.  

Old Man Sun smiled. "If similar opportunities arise in the future, I hope you'll lend your assistance again."  

This time, Chu Ning lingered. "Master Sun, would I receive a discount if I purchased items from your shop?"  

"Of course! Whatever you need, I'll offer you a fair price."  

"I'd like some offensive and defensive talismans," Chu Ning said. "Also, do you sell manuals on talisman crafting?"  

Old Man Sun shook his head. "I have talismans—lower-grade offensive ones cost two spirit stones each, defensive ones three. As for talisman manuals, those are closely guarded secrets of sects and noble clans. Even if available elsewhere, they'd be exorbitantly priced."  

Undeterred, Chu Ning purchased two of each talisman type—Golden Sword Talismans for offense and Bodyguard Talismans for defense—for a total of nine spirit stones, a favorable deal.  

Next, he inquired about wood-attuned magical artifacts.  

Old Man Sun produced a sword. "This basic flying sword is forged from refined iron with a simple wood-element array engraved upon it. Suitable for wood-attuned cultivators, priced at thirty spirit stones."  

Chu Ning nearly choked. Even the standard twenty-spirit-stone price was beyond his means.  

Seeing his hesitation, Old Man Sun suddenly recalled another item. "Ah! I also have a wooden sword."  

From a dusty corner, he retrieved a dark, neglected object—a thick, oversized wooden blade nearly twice the size of a typical sword.  

"It's not a true sword, just a wooden imitation. Heavy when inert, but lightweight when infused with spiritual energy. Upon striking, its full weight returns to deliver impact damage. However, being wood, it lacks sharpness, making it rather impractical."  

Chu Ning hefted the sword, testing its weight with and without energy. Intrigued, he asked the price.  

"I acquired it for ten spirit stones years ago. If you want it, I'll sell it at cost."  

Chu Ning handed over seventeen spirit stones and assorted fragments equivalent to two more. After storing his talismans securely, he left the shop with the wooden sword and returned to the sect without delay.  

Meanwhile, hidden along his usual path, a figure lurked in the dense foliage.  

"That kid's late today—later than the past two days."
