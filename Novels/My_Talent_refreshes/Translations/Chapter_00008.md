# Chapter 8: Speculation

No matter how you looked at it, being able to cultivate faster was always a good thing. Chu Ning stood up and soon spotted Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi on the distant path. As he rose, the two also noticed him.

Shang Zhaoxiang called out to him from afar, and Chu Ning quickly caught up.

"Old Cao left already, didn't he?" Shang Zhaoxiang asked with a smile as soon as Chu Ning approached. Without waiting for a response, he continued, "Old Cao has a peculiar temperament. Over the years, new disciples under him have suffered quite a bit. Not only does he refuse to teach simple spells, but he also squeezes their time mercilessly. So, be prepared—most of his disciples take over a year before they can independently tend to the spirit fields."

Both Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi looked puzzled. Qiu Shunyi, ever the quicker one to speak, asked, "Isn't it three months?"

Shang Zhaoxiang shook his head. "Three months is only if you can complete Qi Refinement and reach the first layer of Qi Refinement while also mastering a few basic spells for cultivating spirit plants. For example, the Growth Spell to help seeds sprout, the Purification Spell to remove weeds and impurities, or the Rain Blessing Spell to keep the plants hydrated. You don’t need to master them perfectly or learn all of them, but you should at least be able to cast one or two. Of course, if you can master the Verdant Wood Spring Revival Technique, that would be even better."

"Both cultivation techniques and spell practice require time. Under Old Cao, your cultivation time is at most half of what others get, and he barely teaches any spells. Do you really think three months would be enough?" Shang Zhaoxiang's words made Qiu Shunyi look at Chu Ning with deep sympathy.

Qi Refinement? Verdant Wood Spring Revival Technique? I’ve already got a little grasp of those, Chu Ning thought to himself. Outwardly, however, he wore an appropriately nervous expression and asked, "But why does it take over a year if you fail the assessment?"

Shang Zhaoxiang explained, "Because in another three months, the sect holds its promotion assessment for all disciples. Some disciples from each district will advance, freeing up spirit fields for redistribution. Once the fields are allocated, you’d naturally have to wait another year."

"Doesn’t the sect do anything about this?" Chu Ning asked with a bitter expression. His distress wasn’t entirely feigned—while he had no issues with the first layer of Qi Refinement or the Verdant Wood Spring Revival Technique, there were other spells to worry about.

"They do!" Shang Zhaoxiang replied. "Don’t you gather at the Teaching Hall every half-month for lectures? If spells aren’t being taught, you can report it to the teaching disciples, and they’ll instruct you. But as for time management… well, the sect can’t really interfere with that."

He paused briefly before adding, "I suppose you might be wondering why the sect doesn’t just have you cultivate together first before assigning you to us."

Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi nodded in agreement.

"This is mostly a development of the last century," Shang Zhaoxiang continued. "In the past, new disciples were taught and cultivated together before being assigned to different halls after a few months. But over the last hundred years—especially the last fifty or sixty—the number of outer sect disciples has sharply declined. Many tasks in the Hundred Crafts Hall now have to be handled by new disciples. Take spirit field cultivation, for example. If you don’t spend a couple of months learning from us first, the sect wouldn’t dare entrust the fields to you."

Chu Ning pondered this and then asked, "Senior Brother Shang, why has the number of outer sect disciples declined so much in recent decades? Are fewer people being recruited?"

"The sect only says it’s due to mission assignments, with no clear explanation," Shang Zhaoxiang replied. After a brief hesitation, he added, "But there’s another rumor circulating privately among the outer sect disciples. They say the sect discovered a treasure land elsewhere—one with even richer spiritual energy than the Green Stream Mountains. Many disciples were selected to pioneer that area. At first, only those at the eighth or ninth layer of Qi Refinement were chosen, but now I’ve heard even those at the sixth or seventh layer have a chance."

There was a hint of envy in Shang Zhaoxiang’s voice, clearly regretting that he hadn’t been selected.

"What a great opportunity!" Qiu Shunyi exclaimed, his eyes lighting up.

Chu Ning, too, feigned keen interest, though inwardly he felt a twinge of wariness. Something about this didn’t sit right with him. "Until I understand the full picture, I should keep a low profile. Even if I reach the sixth or seventh layer, I shouldn’t let it show, lest I get chosen," he reminded himself.

Just then, Shang Zhaoxiang spoke again. "Besides, not everyone is like Old Cao. Most of us are happy to guide new disciples properly."

He smiled at Chu Ning and added, "Since I’ll be teaching Shunyi anyway, if you have any questions about cultivation techniques, feel free to ask me. Once you’ve refined Qi, you can also come to me for spell instruction."

Chu Ning’s face immediately lit up with gratitude. "Thank you, Senior Brother Shang!"

Shang Zhaoxiang waved it off. "Don’t overthink it. I’m not like Old Cao—I have a whole family outside the sect. I can’t exactly befriend the higher-ups, so I might as well build good relations with new disciples like you. Consider it planting seeds for the future."

With that, Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi understood the motivation behind their senior brother’s kindness and thanked him profusely.

As they chatted, they soon arrived back at the courtyard. After bidding farewell, Chu Ning returned to his quarters.

He started a fire to cook, did some chores, and in the afternoon, Cao Dongxin once again sent him to the fields to keep an eye out for pests. Chu Ning didn’t mind—it was another chance to cultivate.

At first, he thought the spiritual energy in the fields was denser, but upon closer inspection, he realized it wasn’t. In fact, the spiritual energy around their living quarters was slightly richer, likely because they were closer to the mountains.

Chu Ning chose the same spot he’d used that morning, but to his slight surprise, his progress wasn’t as rapid this time. Despite meditating longer, his proficiency only increased by one point. Another point came during his evening session in his room.

The next morning, Chu Ning rose early to practice the Nine Tigers Body Refinement Technique before preparing breakfast. Whether it was because Shang Zhaoxiang’s remark had stung Cao Dongxin or because Chu Ning’s early cooking delayed him, Cao Dongxin left later than usual, almost at the same time as Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi.

At the fields, Cao Dongxin first inspected the growth of the spirit rice. This time, he didn’t exclude Chu Ning. Instead, he boasted, "See this? I cast the Verdant Wood Spring Revival Technique here yesterday. In just one day, you can already see the difference in growth. Today, I’ll apply it to the rest of the rice. In about a month, the entire field will be covered, improving both yield and quality."

As he spoke, he led Chu Ning forward. But when they reached a corner of the field, he stopped abruptly, muttering in confusion, "Hmm, what’s going on here? I’m sure I cast the Verdant Wood Spring Revival Technique on this patch yesterday, but there’s no change at all."

Chu Ning’s heart skipped a beat—this was the exact spot where he’d cultivated the day before.

"Could it be that my cultivation absorbed the spiritual energy gathered by his spell?" The thought flashed through his mind.
