# Chapter 171: The Arrow Is Loosed and Cannot Be Recalled

Xu Yunfan showed a hint of embarrassment. He glanced at the sword blank and comforted, "Master, rest assured. This sword blank is only a low-grade sharp weapon at best. I can forge another one... I, I will forge it!"

Zhan Yan, who had been holding his breath, finally exhaled upon hearing Xu Yunfan's last words. He couldn't help but snort softly.

"Alright, you've always been obsessed with martial arts. Shouldn't you be atop the mountain absorbing the morning sun's purple energy? Why are you looking for me?"

It was only because it was Xu Yunfan. If Fu Jin had dared to barge in during this time, Zhan Yan would have beaten him so badly he couldn't get out of bed for three days.

Xu Yunfan had already told him that his external three-unions martial art cultivated the Pure Yang One Qi Technique obtained from the Dao Sect. Regarding this, Zhan Yan could only say that Xu Yunfan had good fortune.

The Dao Sect's Pure Yang One Qi, when discussing the external three-unions cultivation martial arts of the world, was truly the first of its kind. It used the purple energy of the morning sun to blend the forces of Yin and Yang, Dragon and Tiger, perfectly fusing the three trainings of muscle, bone, and skin into one furnace.

Even the Arhat Dragon Elephant Strength from the Maitreya Temple in the Southern Desert was half a step inferior. It was a true supreme foundation-building technique.

Xu Yunfan organized his thoughts.

"Master, I had a dream last night where someone entered my dream to kill me..."

He then detailed the events of the dream to Zhan Yan.

Zhan Yan, who had been looking casual at first, grew increasingly solemn as he listened.

From Xu Yunfan's description, the dream scenario was indeed similar to the method of 'possessing a body to enter a dream.' They had both experienced the Ming Lord's method of possessing a body to enter a dream, so they naturally knew what state that was.

"Entering a dream through possession requires satisfying two fatal laws," Zhan Yan said after a long while. He sat to the side, took a big swig of cold liquor, and wiped the alcohol fumes from his beard.

"Either it is a false god shaped by incense and fire, like the Ming Lord of the Incense Sect, who has forged an incense golden body and received the long-term worship of followers. Over time, the wishes of thousands of followers turn into incense qi, using this to gather residual consciousness and revive, gaining various uncanny abilities. Or..."

He gave Xu Yunfan a meaningful look and said淡淡ly, "It is someone who has come into contact with the 'Divine Treasure' left behind by an Extreme Dao expert."

"Divine Treasure?" Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched his throat; even now, he felt it was a bit dry.

"The Tiangong Cave has been established for a thousand years, inheriting the Mo Family's Non-Attack lineage, and naturally possesses many extremely ancient texts. The so-called Extreme Dao experts are those who broke through the shackles of the heavens, stepping from the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining into a completely new realm. Only then are they worthy of the title of Extreme Dao."

Speaking of this, Zhan Yan seemed to remember something and shook his head slightly. "These people's strength has far exceeded what humanity can imagine, to the point where they were once named as immortals."

He looked up at Xu Yunfan and pondered for a moment. "Like the Ming Lord forging his incense golden body, he has the ability to possess bodies and enter dreams. But if your subconscious is on guard, it naturally won't work. This state only works if you are unaware of it. Another possibility is coming into contact with a凝聚 object of mind and spirit left by an Extreme Dao expert... Although the spiritual energy of the world has only revived slightly, it is enough to provide the survival conditions for these Extreme Dao experts."

He looked up at Xu Yunfan and thought it over. "'Defeat her, and I will spare you.' Perhaps this is an inheritance imprint."

"Inheritance imprint?"

Xu Yunfan thought it over, his heart suddenly stirring, and he subconsciously touched his chest.

Seeing this, Zhan Yan immediately stood up, his eyes sharp as he scanned the surroundings like a hawk or wolf. After listening quietly for a while and confirming no one was nearby, he solemnly instructed, "This matter must not be told to anyone else... You can try to sleep again tonight. If you still have the dream despite being on guard, then it is the second possibility..."

Zhan Yan suddenly grabbed the half-broken sword blank from the forging platform that had failed the quenching process.

His eyes bloodshot, he stared at this sword blank for a long time before bringing it in front of Xu Yunfan.

"Three hundred years ago, a brilliant disciple emerged from the group of grave robbers at Beimang Mountain. He picked up half a broken sword from an ancient battlefield underground, and his personality changed drastically. He became a god with the sword; any sword technique could be understood instantly, mastered immediately. In just two or three months, he integrated over a dozen sword techniques."

"Three months later, his sword moves began to carry a chilling... Sword Intent. An intent that could only be nurtured by being loyal to the sword and extreme in the sword."

Zhan Yan casually threw the cracked half of the sword blank into the forging pool, waiting for the underground fire to melt it down for recasting.

"In just three years, he swept through the younger generation of the six top sects in the six great Zhou regions, standing alone at the peak, until..."

Zhan Yan made a strange sound in his throat and glanced at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan's throat bobbed, feeling a sudden chill there.

"A old demon drilled out from the top of his head, and that child still had half a human face left."

Zhan Yan's tone smoothed out slightly as he continued, "The so-called inheritance of an Extreme Dao expert is nothing but a trick of borrowing a shell to return a soul. But if you can overcome it, it can also bring you a great opportunity. This matter..."

Zhan Yan understood in his heart that Xu Yunfan had likely found some object寄托 by an Extreme Dao expert.

"Master, do you think my martial arts talent comes from this Extreme Dao's object?"

"Not exactly." Zhan Yan rarely let out a chuckle from his throat.

"Your talent is like a divine object that hides its own brilliance; only those with discerning eyes can see it. You are a born Qilin son... That Extreme Dao's object is inherently a double-edged sword. Once it starts, there is no turning back. Although the spiritual energy of the world is only temporary, it has finally appeared in the world. Many things that seem ordinary might harbor the will of an Extreme Dao expert. You are probably also... like an arrow loosed from a bow, there is no turning back... This matter, this matter must be decided by you yourself."

Zhan Yan's tone was low, carrying a hint of complexity.

With Xu Yunfan's qualifications, given time, the Tiangong Cave might not be able to produce a supreme Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining. But if he could overcome this hurdle, he might have the capital to truly utilize the dissipating spiritual energy of the world to break through the realm and surpass the Ninth Realm.

But this matter was ultimately just...

"However, you don't need to worry too much. The Tiangong Cave has clear records: many of the objects寄托 by Extreme Dao experts are too ancient, and their wills have dissipated too much."

"Heaven and earth are the furnace, and creation is the craftsman." Zhan Yan stood with his hands behind his back and said slowly, "Perhaps this is the crucial point for you to temper your golden body in the fire."

"Remember, Extreme Dao inheritance has always been a mutual refinement of venomous insects. Be careful in all things!"

"When you are plotting to take her thousand years of martial arts insight, is she not also using your pure yang physique to nourish her residual soul?"

"Thank you for telling me, Master!"

After this conversation, Xu Yunfan, having received Zhan Yan's instructions, naturally felt his confidence greatly increase. He took his leave. He needed to see what marvelous secrets remained in the skin of the woman he had dug out from the Source Ancient Jade Wall beneath Ninggu Tower.
