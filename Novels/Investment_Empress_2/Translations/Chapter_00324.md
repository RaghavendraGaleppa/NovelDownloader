# Chapter 324: Charging into Battle, Facing the Rising Sun!

Dawn arrived, making the dried bloodstains on the city walls appear even more vividly red.

Qu Sheng, holding a long spear and dressed in white robes, ascended the city wall. He somewhat greedily basked in the warmth of the morning sun, for when the sun rises again tomorrow, who knows how many people will never see it again.

Perhaps he would be among them...

But before the thought could fully settle, he saw two figures on the city wall, their forms stretched long and tall by the morning wind and the rising sun.

"Young Hero Li, Fairy Ying... you two aren't..."

Qu Sheng's eyes widened in surprise, then settled into calm appreciation.

"Commander Qu, Han Zhen has now cultivated the Demonic Summoning Sutra and used blood sacrifice methods. If we do not eliminate him, we will never be able to achieve victory," Li Mo said softly, looking down at the enemy forces already beginning to form their formations.

"But defending the city is already an immense struggle," Qu Sheng shook his head.

Han Zhen was not only devious in his methods but also a cunning old fox. Yesterday, even when Young Hero Li provoked him so intensely, Han Zhen bore it with restraint. A man like that, surrounded by a massive army—how could he be assassinated? Those巫灵 war golems, the tens of thousands of enemy soldiers, and the ferocious Disaster Beasts were not mere clay puppets.

"I will charge into their ranks, seize their banner, and behead their generals. Wouldn't that suffice?" Li Mo said with a light laugh, as if he were merely talking about having two extra bowls of porridge for breakfast.

"You..."

Qu Sheng wanted to say that tales of generals slaying enemies and seizing banners amidst ten thousand troops are just stories. In reality, how could it be so easy? But meeting Li Mo's gaze, he didn't see the recklessness of a naive youth, but rather a well-considered plan. The clear, youthful eyes held an unfathomable depth.

Yes, he had already witnessed the cruelty of the battlefield. How could he be someone eager for military merit and quick success?

"If Han Zhen dies, the enemy forces will indeed collapse on their own, and Greenwood City will have no further worries. But... how do you plan to do it?" Qu Sheng asked.

"I now have the confidence to bear the strength of a hundred units of military armor," Li Mo said.

"?!?"

Qu Sheng's eyes widened. Wasn't that... the legendary "Ten Thousand-Man Enemy"? Even the ancient Hegemon of legends, in the rumors, was only like this. Moreover, the Hegemon was born divine and likely started training in martial arts earlier; at the same age, his realm was probably higher than Young Hero Li's.

"Ying Bing will assist me with music," Li Mo continued. "Then, once I have absorbed the strength of a hundred units of military armor, I can attempt to break through in one go." He clenched his fist, watching the orderly enemy army that had already arrived at the city gates.

Qu Sheng remained silent for a long time. After a long pause, the iron-blooded commander of Greenwood City had a softer look in his eyes. "Men, bring my battle armor. Gift it to Young Hero Li."

"Brother Li, you don't know how to ride a horse, right? We can use a combo skill!" Huang Donglai gritted his teeth and said. Brother Li gave him the Cloud-Walking Boots; if he couldn't ride, how could Brother Li charge into the enemy ranks with the army? They could only use the combo skill "Bing," forming the "Wang Qi Double-Faced Turtle"!

"That won't be necessary, Brother Huang. You should focus on thinking about how to handle the poison," Li Mo couldn't help but laugh. With a thought, white clouds gathered from nowhere before him, forming a white steed of clouds. Its hooves were shrouded in mist, incredibly mystical. After obtaining the form of the Great Sage Storming the Heavenly Palace, even the divine powers he had previously comprehended had gained new understanding. Why must the Somersault Cloud be a cloud?

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

*Boom—*

The war cries of the巫灵 war golems shook the heavens. In the eyes of each golem, a green flame ignited. After yesterday's battle, their aura seemed to have become even more ancient and powerful. The warriors of the southern tribes had bloodshot eyes, and various beast-like features had appeared on their bodies. They had fused with the totems of their various clans; this was called Ancestral Spirit Possession. The martial arts of the Hundred Beasts Hall of the Demonic Summoning Sect were derived from this method of Ancestral Spirit Possession, modified by Han Zhen.

The black tide surged toward Greenwood City like a wave, making the city seem as if it might crumble at any moment. Han Zhen stood atop the temple palace, hands behind his back. On his exposed skin, ancient patterns that were reddish-black seemed to faintly flash. Today's battle would indeed be even more tragic.

Everyone on both sides held their breath. Perhaps this single battle would determine the victor?

*Thump—*

*Thump, thump—*

*Thump, thump, thump—*

The drums made of Thunder Beast hide suddenly sounded, the heartbeat of Greenwood City beating powerfully, causing even the gravel on the ground to tremble. The御劫 array patterns on the city walls flickered with life and death.

At the same time, the city gate suddenly swung open. Like a sudden storm of thunder, the sound of hooves rang out as a large number of Greenwood City soldiers, riding variant warhorses, charged out.

"The Greenwood defenders actually dare to launch a counter-attack?" "Haha, relying on natural defenses but not defending, actively leaving the city to seek death!" The attacking side rejoiced, roaring with excitement.

Hmm? Han Zhen narrowed his eyes, feeling vaguely that something was wrong. "Could it be a diversion, trying to create an opportunity for someone to break through?" the master of the Hundred Beasts Hall pondered. The "someone" he spoke of naturally referred to Ying Bing and Li Mo. However, just as he thought this, he saw from afar the figure charging at the very front, riding a white cloud steed.

Li Mo?!

The master of the Hundred Beasts Hall looked shocked. "Is Li Mo crazy? He's making the Greenwood defenders go crazy with him?!" Even Han Zhen couldn't understand why Li Mo would abandon the defense and charge out with the cavalry, leading the charge. Furthermore, his gaze was intense, piercing through the thousands of troops and horses—he was looking at him. This was another abnormal thing he couldn't comprehend. But remembering how he had been tricked by a feint yesterday, he clenched his fist. "All troops, orders: temporarily halt the siege!!"

That's right, Li Mo was charging into the fray. Then what about Ying Bing...

*Zheng—*

At that moment, the sound of the Thunder Beast hide drums on the city wall became more rapid. The solemn and killing melody of the zither, infused with a powerful soul, resounded across the battlefield, drowning out all noise. Ying Bing sat on the city wall, her jade face cold and plain, her fingers plucking the strings. She was doing two things. First, she controlled the Thunder Beast hide war drums, playing the "Heavenly King's Break Formation Melody," and unimaginably combined the two, creating an unparalleled sound of slaughter, boosting her own side while intimidating the enemy. Second, she used her Xia Phoenix Qi to command the military formations.

Two streams of cavalry charged out. Aside from Li Mo, the other was led personally by Qu Sheng.

"Surround and kill them!" Han Zhen's sharp voice pierced through the battlefield. All the mountain-sized巫灵 war golems, the black masses of enemy soldiers, and various high-level Disaster Beasts gathered instantly. The war golems exuded an ancient and primitive killing intent; the enemy soldiers beat their vine armor with their blades; the Disaster Beasts were all bizarre and ferocious. Compared to these, the two streams of cavalry didn't seem grand at all; in fact, they looked somewhat insignificant. There were only so many horses. With eighty thousand men, how many cavalry could there be? Even with the infantry following closely behind, it seemed insufficient.

"Hoo..."

The whistling wind swept past. Li Mo listened to the sound of the zither and drums played by the Ice Cube. Without him needing to act, the Qitian Battle Secret operated silently. His entire body's blood seemed to be ignited. The hammer in his hand grew hot. He suddenly thought of the memories from his past life, the retired soldier upstairs who liked to listen to opera in the morning while facing the sun, preventing him from sleeping in. Just like he was now, charging into battle facing the rising sun. Which song did that old man like best? The powerful, angry roar of Beijing Opera seemed to echo in his ears: 'Relatives in distress, anger burns three thousand feet; charge into the enemy formation, fight the demons.'
