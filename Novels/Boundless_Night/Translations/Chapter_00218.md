# Chapter 218: A Legendary Scene

As soon as Cao Qianqiu's killing intent arose, his head split open.

Qin Ming was ablaze from head to toe, his Heavenlight Qi burning fiercely. Facing this generation's old madman, he granted him the highest "courtesy," fighting as if possessed.

“Choke me with one hand? Old Cao, did you not eat? Your strength is too weak!” By now, Qin Ming no longer cared that this was a legendary villain on the Immortal Path. Since peaceful resolution was impossible, he decided to swing his great hammer, unleashing all sorts of "disrespectful" acts.

Though Cao Qianqiu's head was fractured, his feet were not slow. He moved like a phantom, instantly teleporting and constantly changing positions. However, the fierce young man, wielding his great hammer, followed him, teleporting at a speed no slower than his. With a *dong*, another hammer blow slammed into his body.

Cao Qianqiu's chest caved in, a large hammer-shaped protrusion emerging from his back as he was sent flying horizontally. Behind him, the "unkeepable" youth in his eyes, muscular and with wild black hair, his gaze like knives, once again caught up and smashed the Dragon-Snake Hammer onto his body.

With a *bang*, Cao Qianqiu’s chest exploded, shattering half of his body along with it. His eyes ignited like divine lamps, radiating terrifying runes that wove into beams of light, striking back at the youth’s face. Qin Ming’s left hand struck out, carrying Heavenlight like a blazing sun. It clashed as if with an immortal sword, clanging loudly, then shattered all the light beams. His right hand brought the great hammer down again. One word: Brutality.

This time, Cao Qianqiu grunted. His head not only cracked but also partially exploded, and a portion of his Pure Yang Spiritual Consciousness was completely worn away. After flying backward, he adjusted his state, intending to manifest an advanced cultivation technique beyond the First Realm to suppress this youth.

However, the youth clung to him like a shadow, as if bound to him, pursuing him in close combat and continuously smashing him. Cao Qianqiu’s head, then his chest, and then his limbs had all exploded at various times. If he were a flesh-and-blood body, he would have long been mangled beyond recognition. Now he was a Pure Yang Spiritual Body, and although parts of his spiritual radiance had been ground away, he could still reassemble himself. This was his greatest reliance at the moment.

Being stuck to and repeatedly hammered by such a youth, he truly couldn't maintain his dignity. He had traversed the Night Fog World, sweeping aside all opponents; when had he ever been so disheveled?

Behind him, Li Qingxu was dumbfounded, his so-called detached demeanor long gone. He was utterly shocked, his mouth agape, his entire being stiff. His master, who represented an unbeatable legend in his heart, was now being chased and beaten repeatedly, even his Pure Yang Spiritual Body torn to tatters.

Xiang Yiwu, Cui Chonghe, Su Shiyun, and others also stared wide-eyed. They had already guessed it was Cao Qianqiu, but never imagined he would be in such a sorry state. He was hammered by that demonic youth from east to west, from head to toe, his body flying horizontally, continuously shattering. What an astonishing legendary scene this was?!

Cao Qianqiu surged with auspicious glow, erupting in boundless light rain, finally repelling the youth and creating a sufficient distance between them. His eyes were cold. Being chased and hammered like this—if news got out, the old eccentrics on all the various paths would surely mock him. For so many years, he had stood atop the clouds, looking down upon the Night Fog World. Many opponents had always been waiting to see him fall from his divine altar. The old eccentrics couldn't touch him, yet now a mere youth had unexpectedly created such a "legendary scene"!

Qin Ming also paused temporarily. This old man was of Pure Yang attribute, not his true body, making him considerably difficult to kill.

Cao Qianqiu's wide sleeves billowed, and his silver hair danced. Killing intent once again surged in his heart. His divine sense was incredibly keen, naturally discerning the youth's essence. He was certain that if this youth from the Newborn Path didn't die, he would likely surpass even those Patriarch-level figures! Because, at present, this youth, while still in the First Realm, was already somewhat stronger than the legendary Bearers of the Three Imperial Qi, the Heaven-Shakers, and the Golden Body Nirvana cultivators.

Cao Qianqiu’s silver hair flew back, and his Pure Yang robes rustled. He moved his hands, and endless runes, like glowing butterflies flapping their wings, rushed together, instantly forming a bell. It was very difficult to cast this technique in the First Realm; at the very least, his disciples couldn't do it. Even he himself needed to create distance, calm his mind, and focus his spirit to manifest it. This was the Soul-Stabilizing Bell, one of his trump cards, formed from tens of thousands of runes. It could immobilize an opponent's soul, and further, naturally kill them with its bell waves.

*Clang!*

A bell chime rang out, causing the soul lights of many people on the various mountain peaks to almost freeze. People were horrified. Qin Ming's expression was solemn. He protected himself with unmatched Heavenlight Qi, his entire body enveloped within it. Auspicious glow shot forth, immortal light surged, and the great bell seemed to break through the shackles of space and time, suddenly flying over. With a *boom*, it enveloped Qin Ming below. Old Cao's methods were heaven-reaching. This bell body ignored distance, making it impossible to guard against or avoid. Immortal mist flowed around the bell body, and tens of thousands of runes glittered, sealing off its opening.

Then, Cao Qianqiu suddenly struck it with a palm. The great bell roared and began to vibrate violently. Various symbols densely covered the bell body, flowing like a starlit river, intending to crush the youth within. At this moment, even many people in the secret realm were wondering, "Who is this? He's far stronger than Li Qingxu was earlier."

Qin Ming was indeed impacted. He admitted that Cao Qianqiu was outrageously strong. For so many years, no one had been able to do anything to the old madman. He had always been powerful and domineering, truly possessing unfathomable strength. A casual strike from him was a sect-suppressing ultimate technique.

However, Qin Ming ultimately resisted. He continuously swung the Dragon-Snake Hammer in his hand, smashing it against the bell wall. This not only disrupted the rhythm of the bell waves, dimming all the runes, but also deformed the bell body.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The deafening bell chimes caused many in the secret realm to painfully close their six senses; they simply couldn't endure the impact of the Soul-Stabilizing Bell. Qin Ming didn't know how many times he had swung his hammer, but the bell wall was twisted and deformed, its shape no longer regular.

Cao Qianqiu’s expression changed. He had never encountered such a youth before. Was he truly going to be suppressed in the same realm? His hands continuously moved, and dense runes landed on the Soul-Stabilizing Bell. However, the youth inside swung his hammer even faster. Fine cracks appeared on the bell body, and before the newly added runes could complete their repairs, new fissures exploded open.

With a *crack*, an area of the great bell shattered like a spiderweb, its broken marks exceptionally clear. Then, with a *boom*, it exploded open, tearing apart the mountainside. Qin Ming bathed in the light of runes, his entire body surging with Heavenlight Qi, radiating killing intent as he blasted towards Old Cao.

With a *dong*, Cao Qianqiu was again sent flying horizontally, cracking apart, his body completely shattering once more. This time, he was very decisive, not hesitating to consume his Pure Yang Spiritual Consciousness. Burning it, he unleashed a rain of light, once again creating distance and not easily giving the opponent a chance for close combat.

At the same time, he clasped his hands in the air, and fine golden patterns flowed from his fingers, weaving into a rope mid-air. It was like a golden python, swimming through the void at a terrifying speed, seemingly ignoring distance, and in a flash, it arrived before Qin Ming. Qin Ming swung his great hammer, smashing it outwards. However, the golden rope, wreathed in runes, transformed from a python into a dragon, changed direction again. As if piercing through space, it arrived before him in a blink, intending to bind him.

“That's Cao Qianqiu's ultimate technique! It once killed a peak expert of our demon race! Once entangled by that golden rope, one will be twisted into several pieces alive!” Some observing demons, seeing this scene, were immediately awe-struck and worried for their race's Demon Seed. Those on the Immortal Path naturally knew even better that this was one of Senior Cao's most proficient killing techniques.

“Li Qingxu can't use that at his current stage, can he?!” someone said.

Qin Ming frowned. He continuously swung the Dragon-Snake Hammer, but only managed to temporarily repel the runic golden rope. With a *swish*, the great hammer in his hand disappeared. Against this flexible rope made of runes, a direct hard impact wouldn't be very effective. The next moment, black and white light surged in his hands.

Qin Ming, using his integrated Heavenlight Qi, circulated the original demon race version of the *Dragon-Snake Scripture*. Not only was its power extraordinarily unmatched, but it also carried surging demonic energy. Anyone who saw him would think he was a young demon of this generation. Amidst the dazzling Heavenlight, the power emanating from his hands became incredibly terrifying. The void hummed and roared. Finally, from his hands, it was as if two figures, one black and one white, rushed out, a dragon and a snake intertwining. A technique that could originally only be unleashed in the Second Realm was now displayed by him. Dragon roars and flood dragon cries resounded throughout the area.

The black and white dragon and snake intertwined, like a pair of scissors, carrying endless demonic energy. Based on his integrated Heavenlight Qi, they confronted the runic rope. Amidst *crackling* sounds, as the golden rope extended, segments were continuously snipped off. In the clashes of the dragon and snake, it kept breaking, then completely shattered.

“That’s a legendary ultimate technique of our demon race—the Dragon-Snake Scissors! Few can master it, unless they are comparable to Bearers of the Three Imperial Qi or Heaven-Shakers; otherwise, it's impossible. Truly worthy of being a Demon Seed!” Some demons were shocked. Certain profound techniques couldn't be mastered just by possessing the scriptures; they truly demanded extraordinary talent. The Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds from all paths were also utterly astonished.

Qin Ming, carrying the Dragon-Snake Scissors, rushed forward at extreme speed. In the First Realm, he couldn't unleash Heavenlight Qi from afar, only engage in close combat. With a *swish*, at the moment he approached, he 'cut open' Cao Qianqiu’s body, spiritual light splattering like blood. Then, he delivered another hammer blow, smashing it onto the old madman's body, shattering him and sending him flying horizontally.

Cao Qianqiu naturally understood that this youth clearly had other techniques, yet always used the great hammer to strike him, doing so intentionally. “You dare to humiliate me?!” Old Cao exploded in true fury. In an instant, he cupped his hands upwards, and his entire body blurred as Pure Yang spiritual light boiled, rushing out of his form and transforming into a blood-red great sun, which he held aloft with both hands. Dense runes bloomed within the great sun; this was his Pure Yang essence. He went all out, intending to blast the youth to death. He himself became faint, as most of his spiritual radiance had been drawn out.

Qin Ming sensed danger. The old madman’s great sun was burning, equivalent to his entire cultivation essence condensed, about to be unleashed. He took a deep breath, circulating the Boshu Scroll technique. Heavenlight Qi condensed in his right hand, its radiance boiling, manifesting outside his body and transforming into a God-Beating Whip. He was imitating that ultimate technique of the Lingyu Master's sect. He couldn't draw out all his Heavenlight Qi, as it was rooted in his flesh and blood, but he could activate most of it. How incredibly high was the quality of his Heavenlight Qi! Now, he continuously condensed it. A weapon appeared in his right hand, resembling a God-Beating Whip, yet also a Heaven-Measuring Ruler, dazzling even more than a blazing sun. At the same time, due to the concealment of the Dragon-Snake Scripture, his body was also accompanied by a dense demonic aura.

Everyone knew this was the decisive battle between the two, both having used their trump cards. Cao Qianqiu hurled the great sun composed of red runes, blasting it towards the outrageously powerful youth. Qin Ming was expressionless, holding the sun-like weapon—like a staff, like a whip, and also like a ruler—which condensed seventy percent of his total Heavenlight.

*Boom!*

He wielded the weapon, striking the blood-red great sun, erupting in incredibly dazzling light. This was the grand confrontation between Heavenlight Qi and Pure Yang Spiritual Consciousness! One could see the blood-red great sun spanning the sky, illuminating everything. If it were an ordinary demon, they would have long been incinerated to ash, suppressed and turned to dust.

But Qin Ming blocked it! Beneath the dazzling crimson glow, under the coverage of Pure Yang power, he continuously swung his weapon, striking the blood-red great sun until it cracked open. Finally, with a *boom*, he used the brilliant weapon condensed from Heavenlight Qi to shatter the great sun!

Then, like a dragon in the sky, he used the Dragon-Snake Qi technique to fly briefly, instantly approaching his opponent and violently beating Cao Qianqiu. He dispersed the God-Beating Whip, because it was impossible to keep such condensed Heavenlight fully manifested outside his body; he needed to balance it to protect his physical form. He re-summoned the Dragon-Snake Hammer.

During this close combat between the two, Cao Qianqiu took blow after blow, unable to fly into the sky and thus unable to evade. Furthermore, he had just condensed the blood-red great sun, which had consumed a vast amount of his Pure Yang spiritual light. His body exploded, and after his Pure Yang Spiritual Consciousness reassembled, it was completely seized by Qin Ming with his Cohesive Qi. Then, the great hammer in Qin Ming's right hand targeted him, smashing him repeatedly.

All everyone watched, dumbfounded. Anyone who knew that the one being hammered was Cao Qianqiu was petrified, finding it hard to believe. For so many years, countless people had awaited Cao Qianqiu's downfall from his divine altar. Today, they witnessed such a legendary scene here.

Cao Qianqiu was enraged. The opponent had locked him with Cohesive Qi, "hammering and refining" him. Even if his Pure Yang Spiritual Consciousness could reassemble, it couldn't withstand such continuous pounding. He exploded multiple times, his Pure Yang spiritual light suffering severe losses!

At this moment, silence reigned on all sides. All those in the know, while shocked, couldn't help but stifle their laughter. Because that was Cao Myth, a madman of his generation, currently being hammered by someone. Only Li Qingxu wept, feeling he had let his master down. For him, this legendary scene... was truly like the sky falling and the earth collapsing.

“You're courting death!” Cao Qianqiu roared, employing a forbidden technique to break through the local suppression. He never cared about bullying the weak; suppressing a young genius was nothing to him. Although he wasn't his true body, only a wisp of Pure Yang Spiritual Consciousness, once he broke through his limits and was no longer suppressed, he would be utterly terrifying.

“Intruder detected, violating local rules. The Heavenly Demon Mirror will exact punishment: annihilation!” A cold voice rang out, and then a massive beam of light descended from the sky, enveloping Cao Qianqiu.
