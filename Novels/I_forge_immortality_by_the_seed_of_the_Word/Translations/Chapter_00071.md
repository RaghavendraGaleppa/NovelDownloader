# Chapter 70: All a Misunderstanding

"Where did this monster come from?"

Senior Brother Luo froze momentarily, his heart tightening with tension.

"Everyone, evacuate immediately!"

His gaze swept rapidly over the watching cultivators as spiritual power gathered in his throat, his booming voice instantly echoing in all directions. At the same time, a talisman unconsciously appeared in his hand, poised for activation.

Yet in the next moment—

"Senior Brother, this is all a misunderstanding," came a voice.

A figure in blue robes suddenly appeared atop the monstrous deer, wearing an awkward smile.

Seeing that blue robe, Senior Brother Luo's expression turned as if he'd seen a ghost, the spiritual energy around him fluctuating chaotically. The talisman in his hand quietly disappeared.

Deer Thirty-Eight gave a terrified glance at the nearly shattered ice-blue spiritual light before him, his legs going weak as he nearly collapsed.

So close! Just a little more and he would have met his ancestors.

"Old Master, your humans are so violent," Deer Thirty-Eight gulped, casting a fearful look at Zhang Jing on his back.

"I told you to fly slower. I was planning to go down and explain first," Zhang Jing said with a wry smile.

"But you told me to fly higher! The higher I go, the more scared I get. When I'm scared, I forget everything and can't control my body," Deer Thirty-Eight muttered in protest.

As they spoke—

"Junior Brother, why doesn't your mount have a spirit beast ring? You nearly caused a serious misunderstanding," Senior Brother Luo descended gracefully from the city wall, landing before Zhang Jing with clear annoyance.

One hand waved lightly behind his back, making the massive hammer artifact on the ground vanish, leaving only a three-inch-deep hammer-shaped imprint with spiderweb cracks radiating outward.

Hearing this, Deer Thirty-Eight's eyes widened incredulously at the human male before him.

Are you sure it was just "nearly" a misunderstanding?

At that moment, a whole new world seemed to open before its eyes.

"Senior Brother, my apologies. This white deer is newly acquired, and I haven't had time to get a spirit beast ring yet. I hope you can forgive the inconvenience," Zhang Jing jumped down from Deer Thirty-Eight and explained apologetically.

This was indeed his fault.

Opposite him, Senior Brother Luo's expression changed dramatically upon getting a clear look at Zhang Jing's face.

"So it's Junior Brother Zhang," his voice softened. "Just be more careful next time."

"Thank you, Senior Brother. Ah, you recognize me?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise.

While he knew several late-stage Qi Refinement senior brothers, this person wasn't among them.

"Haha, at the last trading meet, I saw you speaking with Senior Sister Liu from afar. I wanted to meet you then, but time was too tight. By the way, are you still exchanging talismans for demon cores at low prices? I happen to have some demon cores..."

Senior Brother Luo probed tentatively.

"That offer still stands," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"Excellent! I'll visit your shop later then."

With that, Senior Brother Luo turned to examine the ten-foot-tall white deer, his voice full of admiration:

"Junior Brother has truly acquired an excellent mount. To have such presence already—when it reaches the seventh level of Qi Refinement soon, it'll be even more impressive. The Luo Capital team must value you highly! Though with your talent, it's well deserved."

"You flatter me, Senior Brother. Since everything's settled, I'll take my leave now."

Zhang Jing neither confirmed nor denied. The misunderstanding was clear, but explaining wasn't worth the effort.

"Take care, Junior Brother. Remember to keep this fellow under control in the city," Senior Brother Luo stepped aside, offering final advice.

"Understood."

Zhang Jing remounted Deer Thirty-Eight and directed it through the city gates.

"What an excellent mount..."

Behind them, Senior Brother Luo stared enviously at Deer Thirty-Eight's retreating figure.

Meanwhile, the cultivators gathered at the gate automatically cleared a wide path, looking at Zhang Jing astride the terrifying beast with awe.

Among the crowd, the two men from the city wall earlier were inwardly reeling.

Wasn't that the junior brother from the talisman shop on Twin Phoenix Street? Since when did he acquire such a powerful late-stage Qi Refinement mount?

To their eyes, the massive Deer Thirty-Eight's aura was as deep as an abyss, capable of withstanding Senior Brother Luo's attack—clearly a late-stage Qi Refinement existence.

Both at mid-stage Qi Refinement, yet while they struggled, this junior brother could stir waves in the market and possess such a mount.

Exchanging glances, they couldn't help but question their life choices.

Were they even fellow disciples of the same academy? The gap between them and him seemed wider than that between mortals and themselves.

Within Langya City, Deer Thirty-Eight attracted countless curious, awed, and envious gazes wherever it went.

Under such scrutiny, it eventually lowered its massive head and whispered to Zhang Jing:

"Master, what's this spirit beast ring you mentioned? If I wear it, will others stop attacking me like that person earlier?"

"That's essentially correct."

Deer Thirty-Eight shuddered and cried urgently:

"Then please get me one quickly, Master! That was too dangerous! Our deer family has had thirty-eight generations of single heirs—I can't die yet! I haven't even—"

It began its familiar litany again, the core message being: hurry up and get that 'life-saving ring' before some murderous cultivator came for it!

Finally, for peace, Zhang Jing promised to arrange for the 'life-saving ring' soon.

Only then did Deer Thirty-Eight quiet down.

As Zhang Jing walked ahead, Deer Thirty-Eight followed closely, marveling at the city's bustling sights, its mouth hanging open in constant amazement.

Turning a corner, Zhang Jing spotted a man and woman waiting anxiously outside his shop. One glance confirmed the tall, lean man as Senior Brother Ding—his build was unmistakable. The woman beside him must be Senior Sister Tong Yao.

"Thirty-Eight, I'll go ahead. Follow me and be careful not to step on people or stalls. If anyone troubles you, don't be afraid—just say you're the mount of the Twin Phoenix Street talisman shop owner."

"Understood, Master."

Zhang Jing smiled, then with a surge of spiritual power, became a blur of motion.

Yet as he drew closer, his smile faded into icy solemnity.

Senior Sister Tong Yao's robes were in tatters, her face deathly pale, her aura frighteningly weak.

Senior Brother Ding fared worse—his right arm was missing entirely, his robes soaked in dark red blood.
