Chapter 101: My Heart Has Always Been Towards the Sacred Sect

[You were entangled in karmic debt, your merit and fortune vanished overnight, and you ultimately committed suicide.]
[Current remaining pages of the Book of Hundred Lives: 93]
[Restarting a life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:
    One: Treasure.
    Two: Cultivation.
    Three: Lifespan.
    Four: Forgo all gains and randomly awaken a talent based on your past life's experiences.]

"Those whose names are called, step forward."

The familiar voice gave Lu Yang a fleeting sense of déjà vu, but he quickly composed himself and looked at the interface of the Book of Hundred Lives:
[Name: Lu Yang]
[Lifespan: 18]
[Cultivation: Qi Condensation Stage Ten Grand Completion]
[Talents: Heretical Genius (White), Has Some Tricks (Purple)]
[Cultivation Technique: 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art' (Perfected)]
[Divine Abilities: 'Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art' (Perfected), 'Array Treasure Secret Unveiling' (Perfected), 'Qi Concealment Art' (Perfected), 'Grand Clone Universal Assembly Divine Method' (Perfected), 'Stealing Heavenly Secrets' (Perfected), 'Sage's Plunder' (Perfected), 'Yin Metamorphosis Corpse Release True Method' (Minor Accomplishment), 'Sever Thoughts to See Self Heavenly Silkworm Secret' (Minor Accomplishment)]
[Treasures: Blood Yang Sword Pill (High-grade Magic Treasure), Innate One Qi (High-grade Strange Item)]
[Book of Hundred Lives Pages: 93]

After restarting, he continued from his initial state of the previous life. Only 'Sage's Plunder' provided a boost to his hierarchical status; the other two great divine abilities had not yet been cultivated to completion.

"I choose Treasure."

Lu Yang dared not delay and immediately selected his reward for this life. The next second, the Myriad Spirit Banner, so dark it was almost purple, abruptly appeared in his dantian.

Immediately after, with a thought from Lu Yang, the banner swayed, and a graceful, captivating figure materialized from it, followed by eight red-clad specters. They instantly combined, and the Yama Palace reappeared, leveling all karma on Lu Yang.

However, compared to the previous life, the current Yama Palace had shrunk considerably.

"Is it because Skull Mountain is gone...?"

Lu Yang understood. In the previous life, the Yama Palace had Skull Mountain as its foundation, but in this life, it could only reside within the cave-heaven of the Myriad Spirit Banner.

Although the current Yama Palace still maintained its Foundation Establishment stage hierarchical status, it possessed the quality but lacked the quantity. In this state, it probably couldn't even defeat the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's soul from the previous life; it could only perform tasks like obscuring karma, which merely required its inherent status.

But this was only a minor issue.

After all, Skull Mountain was still there; it couldn't possibly have grown legs and run off. At worst, he could find another opportunity in the future to revisit it and re-establish the foundation.

Lu Yang looked up at the sky, patiently waiting for a moment. This time, the Heaven-Mending Peak Master did not discover him again. After a fit of impotent rage, she withdrew her divine sense.

Only then did Lu Yang nod in satisfaction. He then sensed his karma, his expression calm. "Indeed, the Banner Spirit and the Myriad Spirit Banner are one entity. At least, that's how the 'Book of Hundred Lives' judges it. By choosing it as a reward, all its karma has been erased."

He could no longer sense the karma of the Golden Core Sword Qi.

Both the Myriad Spirit Banner and its various Banner Spirits had, in Lu Yang's eyes, become entities without cause or effect, impossible to trace.

With his thoughts clear, Lu Yang looked at Liu Xin on the stage.

In this life, he would replicate his actions from the life before last.

"The reason Fuyuan Arhat ambushed me in the previous life was, in the final analysis, because I hadn't truly joined the Sacred Sect and lacked a sufficiently strong backer."

The Sacred Sect was, after all, the Sacred Sect. You could say it was evil, but you absolutely couldn't say it was weak.

If he had been a true disciple of the Sacred Sect in his previous life, he believed that even if Fuyuan Arhat had ten more guts, he wouldn't have dared to abduct him to cultivate Buddhism in Jiangxi.

So, in this life, Lu Yang intended to secure the identity of a true disciple for himself.

From this perspective, the Three Rivers Association was an excellent choice.

"At least True Person Chongguang and True Person Yinshan should still be reasonable. At the very least, they didn't directly kill me and forcibly seize the Heavenly Corpse Fiend in the previous life..."

Lu Yang believed they definitely had the ability to do so.

They had the ability, yet they didn't do it.

Such people were exceedingly rare in the Sacred Sect. Moreover, True Person Chongguang, as a Grand True Person at Foundation Establishment Completion, was a very strong backer in himself.

"Actually, my heart has always been towards the Sacred Sect."

"Everyone in the Sacred Sect is a talent; I absolutely love it here! Although I didn't officially join the Sacred Sect in my previous life, I was actually already a member of the Sacred Sect long ago!"

Soon, the initiation ceremony concluded.

The subsequent events unfolded exactly as in previous lives. Lu Yang was still assigned to the Joyful Union Hall by Liu Xin and was still taken by Yu Suzhen into her洞府 (cave-mansion).

Although he had done this many times, Lu Yang would harden his heart every single time.

With the Great Dao before him, how could he be soft-hearted?

He turned the tables and killed Yu Suzhen.

Looking at Yu Suzhen's corpse, eyes wide open in disbelief, Lu Yang frowned. Suddenly, with a thought, he took out the Myriad Spirit Banner and summoned Su Nü.

"Your servant greets Master."

As soon as Su Nü appeared, she respectfully bowed to Lu Yang. Her mountainous peaks swayed as she bent, her willow waist curved like the moon, yet she did not spare a glance at the corpse beside her.

"Do you recognize her?"

Lu Yang pointed a hand at Yu Suzhen's corpse on the ground. Only then did Su Nü turn her gaze. Lu Yang immediately concentrated his mind, sensing Su Nü's thoughts and ideas.

He then saw Su Nü first freeze, looking at Yu Suzhen's exquisite face, identical to her own. Her delicate brows furrowed, seemingly lost in confusion. However, she quickly smoothed her brows again. "Replying to Master, yes, I recognize her. That was your servant in life... Does Master wish to deliver her soul?"

Lu Yang immediately sternly said, "Don't talk nonsense! I'm a cultivator!"

He was purely curious about what would happen if two Yu Suzehens existed in one world.

"It seems the 'Book of Hundred Lives' helped me correct this bug..."

After restarting, although the Banner Spirit subjectively still remembered everything, its self-perception had been forcibly altered after its karma was erased.

She knew she was Yu Suzhen, yet she didn't believe she was Yu Suzhen, almost like a shadow of the original.

As Lu Yang pondered, he saw Su Nü suddenly wave her hand at Yu Suzhen's corpse, and a strange karmic fluctuation immediately spread out.

"...What are you doing?"

Lu Yang looked up, only to see Su Nü also looking bewildered. After a moment of hesitation, she placed her hand on Yu Suzhen's corpse as if plucking something.

The next second—

"Hm!?"

Lu Yang's pupils contracted. He saw that Su Nü, who had been cleansed of karma by the 'Book of Hundred Lives,' suddenly gained a layer of karma!

It was Yu Suzhen's karma!

"It can be like this!?"

Lu Yang's eyes instantly lit up. A Banner Spirit whose original body existed in the current world could borrow the original body's karma?

Thinking of this, he immediately looked at Su Nü and asked, "How did you do that? To what extent can it be done? Are there any restrictions?"

Su Nü paused, then sensed carefully before softly answering, "There's a distance requirement; if it's too far, it might not work. Other than that, there are no special requirements. I don't need to touch them, and if the person dies, I can permanently borrow their karma."

"Interesting..."

Lu Yang fell into thought, looking at the other two Banner Spirits within the Myriad Spirit Banner: Chen Xin'an and the Heaven-Mending Peak Master's clone... Could they do the same thing?

This ability, if used well, could bring great benefits!

A Banner Spirit being able to utilize the original body's karma meant that once the original body died, the Banner Spirit could immediately perform a subtle substitution, even replacing the person's existence!

Taking a step back, even if the original body wasn't killed, one could completely use the original body's karma to commit evil deeds and then pin the blame on the original body.

"...I didn't expect such an unexpected bonus."

Immediately after, he looked at Liu Xin, who was already waiting outside the door.

In an instant, a plan surfaced in his mind.

"Chen Xin'an!"

First, eliminate Chen Xin'an's original body, then let the Banner Spirit Chen Xin'an adopt his karma and replace him to reunite with the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, allowing father and son to be together.

This way, Lu Yang would have an undercover agent planted beside the Heaven-Mending Peak Master.

Furthermore, with Chen Xin'an's identity as a Sacred Sect true disciple and the son of a True Person—a second-generation immortal—many of the Sacred Sect's resources would also be open to him.

If he breaks through to Foundation Establishment in the future, he could even have the Banner Spirit Chen Xin'an lure the Heaven-Mending Peak Master out of the Sacred Sect, then use their father-son bond to ambush and backstab him, directly eliminating him, and finally replace him with the Banner Spirit Heaven-Mending Peak Master!
