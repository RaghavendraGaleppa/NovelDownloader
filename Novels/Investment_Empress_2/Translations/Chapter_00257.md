# Chapter 257: Ming Jiao: "Are You Kidding Me?" (1/2)

The black shadow that stirred the vortex lay in the middle of the lake. At a glance, it was ten zhang in size—a colossal beast to ordinary people.

"The Ming Jiao is causing trouble again!"
"Pray for the Spirit Master to reveal its divine power!"
"This is the third time the Ming Jiao has attacked the town this month. Why is it back again..."

The people by the altar didn't scatter in panic. Though terrified, they knelt by the altar, praying with increasing devotion.

This made the Spirit Master's statue seem even more sinister.

Huang Donglai didn't retreat behind the crowd this time but stood beside Li Mo.

Murong Xiao looked at the lake with curiosity; he had never seen another Ming Jiao before.

Li Mo narrowed his eyes and focused on the lake surface, activating his Heaven's Mandate Divine Eye.

"Achoo!"

A sound that could crack gold and stone... a Ming Jiao's roar?

In any case, the sky darkened further, with signs of impending rain.

Then, a massive Ming Jiao raised its head from the lake.

Its appearance was eighty percent similar to the one Li Mo could transform into, but with subtle differences. The biggest distinction was that it lacked the prominent horns on its head.

[Name: Wu Dameng]
[Age: 48]
[Bone Structure: Ming Jiao and Earth Dragon hybrid.]
[Realm: Peak of the Seventh Grade.]
[Fate: Blue]
[Evaluation: That night, both the Ming Jiao and the Earth Dragon drank too much.]
[Recent Events: Made a deal with a town priest, frequently harasses the town for food and drink.]

"?!"

The information displayed by the Heaven's Mandate Divine Eye was not what Li Mo had expected.

So, he scanned the increasingly devout faces of the terrified百姓 (common people).

"Did you expect that? Old man is back!"

The Ming Jiao, Wu Dameng, actually spoke human language, its voice as unpleasant as nails scraping a blackboard.

At that moment, the Great Priest wearing a bronze mask on the altar leaped into the air, walking on waves to confront the Ming Jiao.

A faint phantom appeared behind him, identical to the Spirit Master's bronze statue.

The two clashed on the lake's surface.

Apparently aided by the Spirit Master's unseen power, the significantly weaker priest managed to fight the Ming Jiao to a standstill.

The disparity in their sizes created a huge visual impact.

The common people's expressions grew even more pious, like drowning men grabbing a life-saving straw.

"This isn't right," Huang Donglai found it strange. "That Ming Jiao is clearly much stronger."

"Harassing the village... but it is my kin... no, I am human..."

Murong Xiao clenched his fists, his expression flickering with intense struggle.

He knew his condition was wrong. It was worse than last time in the Divine Blade Cave. Even silently reciting Buddhist scriptures in his heart wasn't helping.

Suddenly, he felt a warmth in his chest.

Murong Xiao opened his eyes in a daze to see a string of pure white, jade-like prayer beads emitting a Buddhist light.

[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Murong Xiao, helping him suppress the bloodline power within him.]
[Investment Feedback: Nine-Jiao Dragon Strength Pill.]

Now was not the time to count the rewards.

Li Mo smiled at Murong Xiao.

"Brother Murong, I'm going to teach your kin a lesson."

"Under the bright sun and clear sky!" Murong Xiao, holding the prayer beads, looked even more dignified. "I shall help you, Brother Li, clean up your门户 (sect)!"

"...You should just rest."

Li Mo shook his head.

In the midst of everyone's exclamations, he shouted.

"Brother Huang!"

"Got it! Combo move!"

Huang Donglai initially felt this "combo move" was a bit strange.

But remembering the spiritual herbs and elixirs Li Mo had given him, it seemed perfectly reasonable.

So, under countless gazes, the two soared into the sky.

*Whoosh!*

---

*Huh?*

The crowd was bewildered, even forgetting to worship the Spirit Master.

On the lake, the battlefield was shrouded in mist and thunder.

The man and the dragon seemed to be fighting fiercely, but in reality, it was a lot of thunder and little rain.

"About time to wrap it up?"

Wu Dameng swung his tail, striking the water beside the priest and splashing a large amount of water.

He thought to himself that he was indeed厉害 (powerful). With just a little effort, he scared these mortals into a mess.

The priest would surely reward him with an extra cow to feast on.

That's right. As long as he cooperated with the priest's performance, pretending to be invincible, people would deliver cattle and sheep afterward.

These ordinary common people were scrawny, with barely any meat on them.

Their lives were bitter, so their taste probably wasn't good. Nothing compared to cattle and sheep.

Suddenly, he saw something in the distance.

"???"

Wu Dameng's massive figure paused. "This isn't what was agreed upon. It was supposed to be one person. Why are they adding people midway?"

"If it's three people, the payment has to increase!"

"Huh?"

The priest turned to look and looked as if he had seen a ghost.

*Whoosh!*

"Evil creature, don't flee!"

Li Mo raised the gleaming hammer in his hand, descending like a god.

"Heh, this new kid's acting is pretty good," Wu Dameng thought to himself, deciding to play along. He charged straight at the youth.

As they got closer, he realized something was wrong.

The lake water seemed to have turned into solid iron; he suddenly couldn't swim, and his movements slowed down.

In his eyes, the hammer, whistling with a sharp wind, grew closer and closer.

Li Mo descended from the air, slamming down with the move "Calming the Waves."

*DUANG~~~*

The hammer landed heavily on Wu Dameng's head. The force traveled through his body and into the lake, exploding into a spray of water.

If not for Wu Dameng's formidable physical body, and if Li Mo hadn't held back, this hammer would have finished him.

At this moment, in the eyes of countless people, Student Li looked like a deity.

"Did that Ming Jiao get killed by this warrior?"
"Which Spirit Master does he worship? He's even more powerful than our priest!"
"Could he be a Spirit Master manifesting its power, walking among us?"

At that moment, Li Mo's voice came from the lakeside.

"From now on, there will be no more Ming Jiao causing trouble. Everyone, rise."

As his voice fell, the figure flew away, carrying the Ming Jiao's body.

The crowd was momentarily at a loss. This Spirit Master didn't even leave his name. How would they worship him in the future?

......

"Who exactly are you people?"
"I don't want extra payment anymore. Let's talk this over," Wu Dameng said.

He never dreamed that after performing this act so many times, this time would be for real.

This was simply lacking in martial virtue!

"Why did you attack the village?" Murong Xiao asked sternly.

"I have to make a living..." Wu Dameng replied, then carefully asked, "May I ask, honorable sirs, what do you want to do?"

"It's not a big deal," Li Mo cleared his throat, deciding to calm the Ming Jiao's emotions first. "Do you want a Barbie doll to knead a cow?"

"?"

The Ming Jiao immediately fell silent, a giant question mark appearing on its massive head.

Are you kidding me?

He couldn't possibly agree to such an outrageous request!
