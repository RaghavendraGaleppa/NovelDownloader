# Chapter 42: The Spirit Fruit Ripens

That evening, Chu Ning was meditating in the backyard as usual when an inexplicable discomfort arose in his heart.

The sensation was strange—it felt as though someone was watching him.

Without changing his expression, Chu Ning opened his eyes and scanned his surroundings, but there was no sign of anyone. Yet this only made him more vigilant.

In truth, this feeling of being watched had occasionally surfaced over the past few days, though it had always been fleeting. Chu Ning had dismissed it as a figment of his imagination, attributing it to nervousness, and hadn't paid it much mind.

But today, the sensation lingered far longer, making it impossible to ignore.

His body stiffened slightly, and his hand instinctively reached for his storage pouch, ready to act at the first sign of trouble.

However, after the time it took to drink a cup of tea, nothing unusual happened beyond the persistent feeling of being watched.

Another half an incense stick's worth of time passed before the sensation abruptly vanished.

Letting out a quiet exhale, Chu Ning relaxed slightly, though his brow remained furrowed.

He didn't need to guess—this feeling undoubtedly came from Qi Chongmao. But it only deepened his confusion.

Their courtyards were separated, and his own was shielded by ironvine. How could Qi Chongmao possibly be watching him?

The only method Chu Ning knew of for observing someone from such a distance was the divine sense of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Could Qi Chongmao, a mere fifth-level Qi Refining cultivator, already wield divine sense? Or had he mastered some secret technique?

The thought sent a chill down Chu Ning's spine, sharpening his vigilance.

Focusing his mind, he checked his cultivation progress:

**[Greenwood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow Grade, Low Tier), Second Layer (234/900)]**  
**[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art, First Volume, Indestructible Skin (150/300)]**

His progress in the Greenwood Eternal Spring Art had slowed recently. Without the aid of the Greenwood Spring Technique, his daily meditation only yielded a meager increase of one proficiency point per day.

What truly puzzled him, however, was the stagnation of his Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art.

Previously, Chu Ning had consistently gained one proficiency point per day in the body-refining art. Over the past five months, he had steadily reached 150 points. But in the last two or three days, his progress had inexplicably halted.

"I've actually spent more time practicing the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art since I stopped working in the fields. Why has it stopped improving now?"

After pondering for a while, Chu Ning suddenly recalled the initial description of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art.

"Could it be that I've already hit a bottleneck?"

The thought crossed his mind, but he wasn't entirely convinced. Typically, bottlenecks in cultivation techniques occurred near or at the point of mastery. His proficiency was only halfway there—could the bottleneck really be this long?

Skeptical yet determined, Chu Ning continued his rigorous practice over the next two days, maintaining his routine of three daily sessions. But to his frustration, the proficiency still refused to budge.

This confirmed his suspicion—the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art had indeed reached a bottleneck.

The realization both surprised and intrigued him. The sheer length of the bottleneck explained why the art was notoriously difficult to cultivate. Yet it also kindled a spark of anticipation.

In just a few days, the Seven Stars Spirit Fruit would ripen. Since the fruit was effective in breaking through the bottlenecks of "Unbreakable Bones" and "Unsevered Sinews," it should have no trouble overcoming the bottleneck of "Indestructible Skin."

The only shadow over his optimism was the increasingly frequent and prolonged sensation of being watched at night. Chu Ning had begun to suspect that Qi Chongmao would make his move the moment the spirit fruit ripened.

Four more days passed.

That morning, Chu Ning remained indoors, observing the outside through his window. Over the past days, he had discerned Qi Chongmao's patterns: every morning, the man would leave for the fields, while afternoons were spent in his courtyard. At night, he would watch Chu Ning's residence for nearly half an hour before retiring.

As usual, shortly after breakfast, Chu Ning saw Qi Chongmao leave for the fields. The man showed no unusual behavior as he passed by Chu Ning's courtyard.

From inside, Chu Ning watched until Qi Chongmao's figure disappeared into the distance. After waiting a while longer to ensure he didn't return, Chu Ning hurried to the backyard.

Standing before the Seven Stars Spirit Fruit plant he had nurtured for months, Chu Ning examined it closely. The leaves now displayed vivid rainbow hues, and the once-green fruit had ripened to a deep red, looking as though it might drop at any moment.

Simply standing near it, Chu Ning could feel the overwhelming spiritual energy radiating from the fruit.

There was no mistaking it—the Seven Stars Spirit Fruit had fully ripened!

Moreover, the fruit brimmed with spiritual essence, its quality clearly surpassing that of the one Old Man Sun had shown him.

Through his months of cultivation, Chu Ning had come to understand why Old Man Sun had only required ten consecutive applications of the Greenwood Spring Technique to enhance the fruit's quality—their cultivation methods differed.

Old Man Sun relied more on external aids, so ten applications had been the limit for quality improvement. Further attempts would have been futile, and he had simply waited for the fruit to ripen naturally.

Chu Ning, however, had used the Greenwood Spring Technique from the very beginning to draw in natural spiritual energy, making the technique continuously effective. While quality improvement eventually plateaued, he had noticed that the technique still subtly enhanced the fruit's spiritual absorption and maturation process.

Thus, he had never skipped a single day of application—and the results were evident in the fruit's current state.

Without hesitation, Chu Ning retrieved six prepared jade boxes from his storage pouch. He carefully plucked the six spirit fruits, placing each into a separate box before storing them away.

The seventh fruit, however, he popped directly into his mouth.

Having already concluded that his Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art had hit a bottleneck, Chu Ning intended to use the spirit fruit to break through it in one go.

After all, he couldn't be certain whether Qi Chongmao would detect the harvested fruit—or what actions he might take.

If his body-refining breakthrough succeeded, he would gain another layer of protection.
