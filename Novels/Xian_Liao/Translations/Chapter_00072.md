# Chapter 72: Innate Realm (Part 1)

Miqing Daoist slowly regained consciousness, finding himself inside a large vat. Beside him stood a towering mulberry tree, its swaying branches casting eerie shadows that filled the air with a terrifying aura.

In his dazed state, he saw a young man.

"What's your name?"

"Mi...qing." He instinctively reached for the hidden weapons on his person, but...where were his hands?

Lowering his head, his expression shifted from confusion to panic and horror...

He suddenly remembered—before losing consciousness, three Daoist priests and this young man had appeared beside him. Then...then his limbs had been torn off. He recalled this young man stopping his pain before he passed out.

At that moment, freed from that despairing agony, he had even felt some gratitude toward this youth.

"Miqing Daoist, tenth on the Black Ranking? The world's top master of hidden weapons?" Zhou Qing recalled some information from his knowledge of the martial world.

"A master of hidden weapons? Heh." Miqing Daoist laughed self-deprecatingly. He had believed his stealth and concealment skills to be unparalleled, never expecting the Lin family to be so cautious as to station four supreme experts nearby even during a banquet.

But...he couldn't understand—where had the Lin family found so many experts?

Had they just happened to be visiting?

"Your movement techniques are impressive, nearly soundless. But it doesn't matter—even if the top-ranked expert on the Black Ranking had been in your place, the outcome would've been the same. Nothing would've changed." Zhou Qing chuckled. Three Innate Realm experts plus himself attacking one person simultaneously—such a lineup was likely unmatched in the current world.

However, Zhou Qing had been the last to reach Miqing Daoist at the time—Fushan was the fastest, followed by Zhang Jingxiu. This made Zhou Qing realize the obvious gap between himself and those in the Innate Realm.

The difference between not being in the Innate Realm and achieving it was vast.

Moreover, Fushan's speed had increased significantly since Zhou Qing first met him.

Being driven to madness had its benefits—single-minded devotion to training, pushing oneself to the absolute limit.

Miqing Daoist didn't argue. "At such a young age, your martial arts seem unparalleled. You'll likely reach the Innate Realm in the future. I never thought I'd live to meet someone with such potential. Are those three Daoist priests your elders? Which sect do you belong to?"

"Innate experts? You've already met them."

Miqing Daoist was shocked. "You mean one of those three Daoists is an Innate expert? Which one?"

He'd been taken down too quickly to react, not even realizing how his limbs had been torn off.

In that situation, only an Innate expert or someone like Zhou Qing could distinguish the sequence of events.

Zhou Qing shook his head.

Miqing Daoist was stunned. "Are you saying you're the Innate expert? You're so young, at the peak of your vitality—that would make the most sense."

"You guessed wrong. It's not me. All three of them are."

Miqing Daoist froze, petrified. He couldn't accept this. The top-ranked expert on the Black Ranking might not even have achieved the Innate Realm, yet this young man claimed he'd encountered three Innates at once? What had he done to deserve being "served" by three Innate experts?

He had no choice but to accept defeat.

Having traveled the martial world for years, he'd seen many experts. Aside from the rumored ancestor in the imperial palace and the Martial Sage of the grasslands—neither of whom he'd met—those reputed to be near-Innate were all past their prime, their vitality waning.

He shook his head, suddenly remembering—one of the Daoists looked familiar.

Straining his memory, Miqing Daoist asked, "Was one of them the Taihe Sect's Elder Zhang?"

"Correct. As expected
