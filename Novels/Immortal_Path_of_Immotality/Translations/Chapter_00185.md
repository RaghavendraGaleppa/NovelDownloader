# Chapter 183: Lin Fan's Message

The temporary headquarters of the Demonic Path in the Eastern Sea was a scene of chaos. Thick smoke billowed from volcanic craters, obscuring the sky, while towering waves crashed against the island chain's edges. 

Defeated demonic cultivators streamed in from the horizon, their flying artifacts whirring incessantly. Fleets of small boats stretched across the sea, each carrying dispirited cultivators with hollow eyes. The outcome of the righteous-demonic war was all but decided—only the final details remained. The Demonic Path had lost vast territories, their forces decimated across battlefronts, some even completely annihilated by the Righteous Alliance. Only their stronghold in the Eastern Sea remained, their resources nearly exhausted.

When the Demonic Path's three sects had first launched their campaign against the Great Song Dynasty, they held a grand assembly—nine Nascent Soul elders, hundreds of Golden Core cultivators, and an army of tens of thousands, their ambition burning fiercely. Now, they returned in tattered retreat, barely a third of their original numbers, all trembling like startled birds. Who could still count on them to fight?

Amid this atmosphere of despair, Lin Shan experienced firsthand the brutality of war in the cultivation world. 

Cultivation was inherently about contention—resources, territories, populations, spiritual mountains, mines, and talents were the foundations of a supreme sect's dominance. Without these, how could its disciples enjoy privileges far beyond ordinary cultivators? The world's resources were finite; when one gained more, others inevitably lost. Every prosperous sect was built upon plunder.

Now that the Demonic Path had been defeated, the Righteous Alliance would never allow them to keep their foothold in the Eastern Sea. Once they consolidated their gains inland, a final bloody purge would follow.

As the Beast Taming Valley's Elder Pei had warned, Lin Shan had committed unforgivable crimes in the Great Song. There was no path to redemption for him there—his only choice was to follow the Demonic Path to the bitter end.

But if he had no choice, so be it. Having wiped out an entire branch of the Dry Cloud Pavilion's legacy, surely his sect would reward him handsomely.

With mixed emotions, he arrived at the Black Lotus Sect's headquarters and entered the Contribution Hall. When he recounted his "glorious achievements," the attendants responsible for contribution records and rewards were stunned.

"Elder Brother Envoy, you're saying that you alone, at the Foundation Establishment stage, wiped out Dry Cloud Pavilion's entire branch—four Golden Cores, over forty Foundation Establishment disciples, and hundreds of inner disciples?"

"Exactly!"

"And you expect us to believe that?"

"I already explained—during their long-distance teleportation, I disrupted the formation. They were lost in spatial turbulence, their fate unknown..."

"That's... absurd. According to you, you just set fire to the traitorous Gongsun Clan's estate and fled back to the Eastern Sea. How could you possibly know what happened afterward?"

Lin Shan hesitated. He couldn't reveal Elder Pei's involvement—that might raise suspicions of collusion with the righteous faction. He could only claim he'd heard the news while fleeing, that it had spread among the righteous sects.

But the Contribution Hall's attendants remained meticulous. Such a monumental contribution demanded absolute verification.

"Your account lacks witnesses. The twenty-some disciples with you are your subordinates—their testimony is unreliable. The only proof would be material evidence."

"What evidence?"

"The corpses of Dry Cloud Pavilion's four Golden Cores, their lifebound artifacts, souls, or even body parts. The same for their disciples."

"But they fell into spatial turbulence! How am I supposed to retrieve anything?"

"So you have neither witnesses nor evidence to confirm your claims? In that case, we can't award contribution points."

"Doesn't the Demonic Path have intelligence networks? Can't you verify this through righteous faction sources?"

"The frontlines have collapsed. The joint command was destroyed, our scouts were surrounded in Qingzhou, and the coasts are blockaded. Our intelligence network is down to a few deep-cover agents. We can't waste those precious resources just to verify a Foundation Establishment envoy's story."

Lin Shan fell silent. His case was indeed insignificant compared to the larger crisis. Without evidence, it was a lost cause. 

Had the former sect master still been alive, he might have pulled strings for him. But Protector Yan had no such authority.

"So my contributions just... vanish?"

"Unless you can prove they're definitely dead, we can't record it."

"Surviving spatial turbulence is possible?" Lin Shan found the idea ludicrous—the odds were astronomically low. Yet, lately, anything involving him seemed to defy logic.

No, absolutely not! He shook off the absurd thought.

"For now, this matter remains unverified. We'll try to gather evidence, but don't get your hopes up. Unless Dry Cloud Pavilion's branch reappears, we can only consider them missing, not killed by you."

Defeated, Lin Shan left. The attendants had followed protocol—without proof, his "achievements" were meaningless.

Returning to his cave dwelling, he found it unchanged after months of absence. With the Demonic Path's command structure in shambles, the Eastern Sea headquarters could only wait for the surviving Nascent Soul elders to regroup the scattered forces.

As a minor figure, Lin Shan had no influence over high-level decisions. He could only focus on his cultivation, using the spirit liquid obtained from the Gongsun Clan's "spiritual tide" and the Void Star Disc to aid his progress.

Half a year passed. 

During this time, defeated demonic forces trickled back to the Eastern Sea—those who didn't return were presumably lost forever. The three Nascent Soul elders returned, including Lin Shan's backer, Protector Yan, who also rescued Luan Chun, demonstrating their deep master-disciple bond.

Meanwhile, the Righteous Alliance reclaimed the eastern territories, purging demonic influences. They fortified the coasts, preparing for the final assault. 

Though the eastern regions would take decades to fully stabilize, the Righteous Alliance couldn't wait—the Demonic Path's presence in the Eastern Sea was an intolerable thorn in their side. After a brutal campaign of suppression, co-option, and purges, they mobilized to attack the Eastern Sea.

At the same time, a secret missive arrived at the Demonic Path's headquarters from the Great Song's interior.

When Lin Shan opened it, he was stunned.

It was from his sworn brother, Lin Fan of the Violet Thunder Sect, who risked everything to warn him: the Righteous Alliance was preparing a decapitation strike—an elite team of high-level cultivators would bypass defenses to assault the volcanic island headquarters. 

From the letter's arrival, Lin Fan estimated they had one month before the strike force arrived. He urged Lin Shan to flee immediately.

Touched by Lin Fan's loyalty—risking execution as a traitor to save him—Lin Shan felt a surge of urgency. The Righteous Alliance was determined to eradicate the Demonic Path. Once the headquarters fell, the scattered forces would collapse.

Where could he go now?

---

On the first day of the ninth month, the Righteous Alliance launched their three-pronged offensive.

The Violet Thunder Sect attacked the north, Dry Cloud Pavilion the center, and the Beast Taming Valley the south. Together with minor sects and rogue cultivators, they boasted a force of "500,000"—though everyone knew that number was inflated. What wasn't exaggerated was the nearly double-digit count of Nascent Soul elders leading them.

The Demonic Path's three elders had no choice but to engage, resorting to guerrilla tactics while desperately awaiting orders from their distant Lu Country headquarters—orders that never came.

Under the relentless assault, the Demonic Path crumbled.

By the third day, the southern stronghold of Diaobie Island fell, followed by a thousand warships advancing from the Jiangdong region.

On the sixth day, the southern island chain collapsed entirely—over three hundred islands captured.

By the tenth day, the central defense at Hongchen Island fell after ten days of naval combat, the three Nascent Soul elders retreating in defeat.

On the eleventh, the Violet Thunder Sect broke through the Hutuo Islands in the north, setting their sights on the Golden Shark, Linghai, and Hurricane Seas.

On the twelfth, the Demonic Path's headquarters issued a total conscription order—even logistics personnel and wounded were drafted. Lin Shan was forcibly pulled from seclusion and sent to the frontlines.

---

Seven days later, Lin Shan returned to headquarters, covered in grime.

He hadn't deserted—the battle was simply unwinnable.

Upon arrival, they were met with an overwhelming armada. The Righteous Alliance's forces outnumbered them several times over, surrounding the island where demonic cultivators made their last stand behind defensive formations.

The reinforcements were stunned. Their Golden Core captain hesitated—advance or retreat? The enemy gave no quarter, splitting their forces to engage.

Lin Shan witnessed the true might of Dry Cloud Pavilion, a premier artifact-refining sect. Their warships unleashed barrages of enchanted artillery, homing projectiles, and dense beams of spiritual energy like laser fire.

Their Golden Core captain tried to resist—only to be obliterated instantly. The entire reinforcement squad was annihilated. Only Lin Shan escaped, thanks to his Wind Escape Talisman and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's aid.

"This is insane! Is this what cultivation warfare is? Even Golden Cores are cannon fodder..." 

Shaken, he realized that below the Nascent Soul level, cultivators were mere ants in large-scale battles.

Back at headquarters, no one bothered to punish him. The entire Eastern Sea was in chaos, with dozens of battlefronts reporting losses daily. The command center was in disarray, orders changing by the hour, leaders overwhelmed.

Before Lin Shan could plan his next move, a voice called outside his cave.

"Lin Shan! You're back! Come with me—Master wants to see you!"

It was Luan Chun, frantic. She dragged him to Protector Yan's dwelling, only to find her absent. Without pause, Luan Chun led him to the summit's grand hall—a place normally off-limits to Foundation Establishment disciples.

The hall was packed. Hundreds of Foundation Establishment cultivators murmured below, while thirty-some Golden Core protectors argued above. Only the Disciplinary Law King, a Nascent Soul elder, sat silently on high. The other two elders and the sect master were nowhere to be seen—the latter had perished at the Violet Thunder Sect's gates, with no successor named.

From the discussions, Lin Shan gleaned the dire situation:

"The eastern second line has fallen—the righteous push toward the third island chain."

"The merfolk of Hurricane Sea have rebelled, attacking our rear."

"Outdated news! The Violet Thunder Sect is already cutting off our retreat north!"

"The Blood River Hall and Hundred Ghost Sect are secretly organizing evacuations..."

The hall buzzed like a marketplace. Without strong leadership, the demonic cultivators were directionless, panicked.

After hours of debate, the Golden Core protectors dispersed, each gathering their subordinates. Lin Shan and Luan Chun followed Protector Yan back to her dwelling.

There, Protector Yan explained the grim reality: since the defeat at Falling Pine Mountain Range, the Demonic Path had suffered endless losses. The three elders had hastily established three defensive lines in the Eastern Sea, but the disparity in strength was insurmountable. 

Daily, the frontlines collapsed further. The command center was mired in petty squabbles, each faction protecting its own interests. Many Golden Core protectors were already preparing to flee north to Lu Country—only the Disciplinary Law King's presence kept them from outright desertion.

Protector Yan sighed. The Demonic Path could only fight when winning; in adversity, they fractured. No unity, no resilience—doomed to fail.

Lin Shan's tension spiked. Lin Fan's letter had warned of the elite strike force targeting headquarters. By his calculations, their one-month deadline was nearly up!
