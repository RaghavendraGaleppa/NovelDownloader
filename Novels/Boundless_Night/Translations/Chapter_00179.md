**Chapter 179: The Young Ancestor Arrives**

“Grandma, I understand!” Wu Yaozu declared. Who would take anyone seriously in this Strange Town? They were merely fleeting acquaintances, drinking buddies, nothing more.

The old woman stopped scolding him and looked at Qin Ming. “You’ve integrated various Heavenly Light Energies, mixing them like a stew. What will you call it? Chaos Energy?”

Qin Ming immediately shook his head. That name was far too grand; if it got out, he’d surely get beaten up.

“Yaozu can’t stay here anymore. I want him to leave with you.”

Soon, Qin Ming understood what the old woman truly wanted from him. If he were to leave, she wished for Qin Ming to look after Wu Yaozu for two months, after which Yaozu could adapt on his own.

The old woman said, “Although he’s learned a lot in the Strange Town, it’s not real enough compared to the outside world.”

Qin Ming replied, “The town is full of high-level beings. If Yaozu can contend with them, he’ll surely adapt to the outside world.”

The old woman shook her head. “Everyone here is performing, wearing masks. It’s too illusory. In the real Night Mist World, someone might suddenly stab him if they disagree, even for a trivial reason. I’m afraid he won’t even make it a hundred miles before becoming dumpling filling for some roadside black-hearted inn.”

“Grandma!” Wu Yaozu exclaimed anxiously.

Qin Ming had many questions about this place and began to ask the old woman one by one.

“The Fourth Forbidden Zone was breached many years ago. We, the former residents nearby, perished with it,” the old woman revealed. In this region, many pursued the “Path of Rainbow Transformation,” viewing their physical bodies as cages that limited the soul’s potential, ultimately seeking complete liberation. On this path, upon reaching a certain realm, one could transform into a rainbow and depart. Some predecessors ascended to the bright moon in the sky.

However, when their descendants faced calamity and were slaughtered, those ancestors on the moon could not descend or escape the cold, clear silver moon. The old woman sighed, “Watching this land be destroyed and all descendants wiped out, I think they must regret it now!” She even began to doubt whether this path was truly correct, as the predecessors on the moon had fallen silent, with no major movements from them. “Now, only a faint rainbow light occasionally appears, and it’s very dim.”

Therefore, she wanted Wu Yaozu to leave this region and find another way. The depths of the Fourth Forbidden Zone held no living creatures, primarily incomprehensible "phenomena" and bizarre "scenes," which were terrifying. She did not say who, what force, or what natural disaster had breached the Fourth Forbidden Zone, causing the nearby beings to perish.

With another sigh, the old woman vanished from the small courtyard. Wu Yaozu, however, was quite open-minded, showing no sadness. After all, he was born in this era and had not personally experienced those past events.

“Brother, I haven’t seen the Five-Colored Vase myself, but I heard that it probably fell at the very end of the town. When the Divine Temple descended at night, the monsters inside picked it up.”

Qin Ming nodded upon hearing this. It seemed he had to visit the Divine Temple.

As the moon disappeared, true night descended. Black mist surged, and the ruins brightened as the Strange Town suddenly appeared. In an instant, a bustling energy filled the air, and various noisy sounds arose. The town was already overflowing with people.

Qin Ming took a cold shower, washing away the scorch marks from the lightning and fire, and his exhaustion. He had successfully mastered all techniques and now felt a sense of completion. Wu Yaozu gave him a set of new clothes he had never worn before. After changing into a coarse linen robe, Qin Ming exuded a sense of returning to simplicity, an ethereal detachment. It was as if dust had been brushed from his mind; he was pure from the inside out, his eyes exceptionally clear.

“You can’t project your consciousness. How will you get into town?” Wu Yaozu widened his eyes, puzzled.

Qin Ming replied, “You’ll lead me out.”

A moment later, Wu Yaozu gasped for breath, almost sticking out his tongue in exhaustion. “Are you sure your consciousness can truly leave your body?” He had tried several times, using extraordinary methods to “pull” Qin Ming’s consciousness, but he couldn’t budge it. His consciousness seemed rooted in his flesh and blood, unshakeable.

“I’m sure,” Qin Ming nodded.

Then, the rainbow light within Wu Yaozu’s body flew out, forming a divine bridge to guide Qin Ming. Divine light continuously emanated from the bridge. Finally, he succeeded. Transforming into a rainbow bridge, he drew Qin Ming’s spiritual consciousness out of his body. Wu Yaozu wanted to roll his eyes. He had used techniques meant for combat, finally pulling out that sun-like ball of light.

“Your consciousness is growing right into your flesh!”

As he said this, he widened his eyes again. What was that? The inside of the light ball seemed even more dazzling, concealed and obscured.

“Damn, how did the Primordial Unity Energy you cultivated come out with it?” He was stunned. No wonder it was so hard to pull out; he had almost used every ounce of strength he had!

“Why has it become Primordial Unity Energy again?” Qin Ming asked, bewildered.

Wu Yaozu explained, “My grandma said that your Heavenly Light Energy used to have many names. The old man who entered the Divine Temple used to call it that.” He found it incredible that this Heavenly Light Energy resembled consciousness so much. It could actually accompany spiritual travel! If so, its destructive power against yin spirits who hadn’t reached the Pure Yang level would be immense!

Qin Ming examined his condition. He felt that after the Heavenly Light Energy merged and returned to primordial unity, he was stronger than before.

“Brother, don’t turn palm-sized. We’re out of proportion,” Wu Yaozu said, looking down at him. Qin Ming primarily intended to wear the tattered cloth for protection, but then thought that being so unusual would make him more noticeable. In an instant, he grew larger and manifested a green robe, tucking the rag woven from strange metal into his embrace.

“Is this a real town?!” As Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu entered the town, they immediately felt it. The bluestone paved streets and the buildings on both sides were undeniably real.

Wu Yaozu nodded. “For outsiders, it’s like a dream, but the place truly exists. It’s a real spiritual journey.”

“Will people die?” Qin Ming asked.

Wu Yaozu shook his head. “Normally, no. Many people come here through spiritual travel after obtaining special items, which essentially protects them.”

Qin Ming said, “Wouldn’t it be better for us to enter with our physical bodies?”

Wu Yaozu informed him, “That’s not good. The Strange Town is prepared for spiritual travelers. If you enter with your physical body, the consumption each time is enormous.”

“Is that Divine Temple real too?”

Wu Yaozu nodded. “Yes, but all the beings inside are dead, forming some strange things. Especially its master, who likes to engage people in discussions about the Dao—it’s too terrifying. No one dares to go in.”

The town had no fiery springs, yet it was very bright. All the houses along the streets had lamps that had been lit since ancient times and never extinguished, welcoming countless generations of spiritual travelers. There were many shops on the streets, rewards for spiritually traveling cultivators who had made significant contributions, allowing them to operate businesses here.

“Candied hawthorn!” Qin Ming heard this sound and was momentarily stunned. This was the Strange Town where powerful figures frequented, and they were still selling such things?

Wu Yaozu explained, “It’s soul-nourishing medicine. The name sounds mundane, but it’s actually refined from Soul Flowers and is quite expensive.”

“Immortal Peaches from beyond the Heavens!” Someone else called out. Evidently, this name was less down-to-earth, but it certainly wasn't a peach from another realm.

“Little Wu, you’re here!” As soon as they entered the town, someone came over to greet them, seemingly very familiar with Wu Yaozu. “Little Wu, you’re here early today.” Many people came forward, very enthusiastic.

This was mainly because the two buildings at opposite ends of the town were too unusual. No one could enter the dilapidated courtyard where Wu Yaozu had lived for years. Many people clearly knew he was a native resident. The buildings at the other end of the Strange Town were the exact opposite: everyone could enter, but once they entered the core Divine Temple, they would never come out again.

Some also looked at Qin Ming with enthusiasm, saying, “Brother, you are truly extraordinary! You managed to find this place in your true body and even live in that small courtyard. How did you do it?”

“I woke up and found myself lying there,” Qin Ming replied. The man who asked the question looked strange. In the real world, his face would have long since darkened—who would dare to fob him off like that? But here, status was useless, and one couldn’t act as they pleased. Qin Ming knew that some wanted to learn from him where this place was in the real world, and he naturally wouldn’t disclose it. Although what he said was the truth, those people simply wouldn’t believe him.

A young man with a vertical eye in his forehead approached, smiling. “Little Wu, is this the brother who recently moved into the courtyard? Why don’t you introduce him?”

“Li Wanqiu,” Qin Ming answered himself, casually picking a name. He already knew that no one here could be trusted. The gentle-looking youth might be an old monster from the Night Mist World. The so-called bright-eyed, fair-skinned maiden might even be a giant spider in reality.

“Your name has a lot of ‘autumn’ in it!” a golden-haired old man riding a four-tusked white elephant remarked as he passed by.

“Could it be Cao Qianqiu?” a young man with a flowing Pure Yang spiritual light asked, a purple pattern on his forehead, looking quite extraordinary. Qin Ming thought, *Perhaps there really is an old senior among them!* He immediately shook his head. “I have no relation to him.”

“Since we’ve met today, it’s fate. I’ll treat you. How about we go for a drink?” the three-eyed man said with a smile. Others were also quite enthusiastic, wanting to get to know Qin Ming because, for many years, they had seen someone arrive in this realm in their true body for the first time. They guessed he might be a great figure. Some even wondered if he was Cao Qianqiu.

However, they soon shook their heads. Old Cao was famously domineering; if it were truly him, he wouldn’t be so amiable. When he stepped on the ground, he’d want to poke a deep pit, and when he stood in the sky, he’d want to punch a big hole in the firmament.

“I already said it, I’ll treat you this time. Let’s go to the Exiled Immortal Pavilion, and then we can invite two divine maidens later,” a young man with a golden horn on his head said with a smile.

“Forget it, who knows what kind of divine maidens they truly are? They could be old demons from five hundred years ago.”

Someone else chimed in, “Indeed, the so-called immortal beauties could be old men with bushy beards. Hey, Little Wu, don’t be angry, I wasn’t talking about *your* beard.” Then, they fell silent, feeling a chill down their spines.

On the brightly lit street, a silver-haired girl approached. Her divine wisdom was so dense that it formed layers of divine halos around her body, making her appear indistinct and hazy.

“A true god has arrived! Everything we said was just a joke, haha,” someone chuckled nervously, somewhat wary of the silver-haired girl.

Wu Yaozu spoke up, “Everyone, my brother is going to the Divine Temple today, so he can’t join your gathering.”

“What?!” A group of people were immediately shocked. What kind of ruthless individual was this? Someone who dared to enter that deadly ancient temple? People suspected that even if Old Cao went in, he might not make it out.

“Brother, this is a grand feat! You should have a few cups of divine brew before going in,” even the golden-haired old man riding the four-tusked white elephant showed surprise, offering him divine wine.

“Senior, you are truly amazing, daring to venture into the Divine Temple alone!” Someone exclaimed, no longer daring to call him "brother," believing this was indeed an old senior who had achieved profound cultivation. Even the silver-haired girl, who seemed to have a formidable background, looked over with an unusual expression, her layered divine halos rippling faintly.

“Everyone, you’ve misunderstood. I am not some old senior,” Qin Ming did not want to take on such a huge karmic burden. He felt it was unstable; if he pretended to be someone else and then was exposed, and there genuinely happened to be one or two true old seniors here, they would surely settle accounts with him. He knew that while the Strange Town didn't allow easy combat, it didn't mean that spiritual travelers had never died here.

Wu Yaozu cupped his hands and said, “Everyone, I remember some of you have ventured into the outer areas of the Divine Temple and returned alive. Could you please share the details with my brother?”

Silence fell. People realized that this was probably not an old senior. He wasn’t going into the core Divine Temple; he actually needed to ask others for information and experience. Instantly, the three-eyed man who had offered to gather fell silent. The horned youth who had boasted about treating them at the Exiled Immortal Pavilion and inviting divine maidens also quieted down. Even the old man riding the four-tusked white elephant stopped speaking, allowing his old elephant to leisurely pace along the street. Many speculated that this was a hot-blooded young man who had accidentally arrived here in his true body, but would likely soon meet his demise at the Divine Temple.

Accompanied by Wu Yaozu, Qin Ming walked towards the other end of the Strange Town. Many people followed, knowing that he would likely fail, but such a scene of impending death was rare, and they all wanted to witness it firsthand. On the bright street, people surged, many having heard the news and following along.

At the very end of the town, a cluster of ancient buildings stood, looking quite desolate. Tall weeds grew on the steps leading to the temple. Qin Ming pushed open the aged courtyard gate and walked straight into the first courtyard. Immediately, a grand chanting sound echoed through the quiet, overgrown temple grounds. Moreover, this first courtyard lit up, becoming incredibly resplendent, with golden light spilling across the ground, immensely sacred and serene.

At the same time, people watched as the young man who walked forward alone glowed like a scorching sun, resonating with the first courtyard. Qin Ming frowned. He hadn't intended this. Was the local master making a move? Probing his foundation, causing his Heavenly Light to shine forth.

“What’s happening? Is that Pure Yang light, or Heavenly Light Energy? I feel like it’s a combination of both!”

“Hiss, could it be that a Young Ancestor has graced us with his presence? Otherwise, how could this be possible!”

Behind them, some people’s expressions changed slightly, then became serious, and many more were stunned.
