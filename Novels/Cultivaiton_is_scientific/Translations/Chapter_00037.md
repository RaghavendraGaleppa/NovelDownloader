# Chapter 37: The Market  

Li Shiming sprinted swiftly, his legs shimmering with a faint cyan glow.  

Though he was now a cultivator, neither the "Spring Breeze and Rain Art," the "Metal Edge Art," nor the "Earth Spirit Art" could give him the sensation of surpassing ordinary human limits like this.  

With the "Basic Lightness Talisman" activated, his speed rivaled that of a car from his previous life.  

The problem was, even if he could manufacture a car, the rugged, unpaved roads here would never allow it to reach the speed granted by the talisman.  

With a light tap of his foot, his body glided forward effortlessly. Under the influence of the talisman, each step felt as if the air itself was propelling him forward.  

A ten-meter drop? He could leap it easily. Even a moderately wide river could be crossed by skimming the surface with a few quick steps.  

Twenty li passed in the blink of an eye.  

By now, Li Shiming bore no resemblance to his usual self. Even his father, Li Wenyuan, or his most familiar attendant, Siqin, wouldn’t recognize him.  

He wore a black hooded robe and a full-face black mask. But these weren’t his most crucial disguises—his entire physique had been altered.  

Using soft materials and the micron-level precision of his machine room’s spatial control, he had crafted padding for his disguise.  

His boots contained a 5-cm heel lift, his shoulders were broadened with shoulder pads, and his chest and back were filled out with muscle-like padding, transforming him into a burly figure.  

His face had been reshaped with chemically altered materials, and traces were concealed with foundation.  

Li Shiming didn’t know if this world had face-changing techniques, but the makeup skills from his previous life were likely no different from disguise arts—both could completely alter one’s appearance.  

He had to be cautious. This was his first visit to the market, where he would interact with other cultivators.  

He couldn’t afford carelessness that might reveal his origins and allow others to track him down.  

Li Shiming came to a stop, the cyan glow on his legs still active—a single "Basic Lightness Talisman" lasted for two hours.  

"This is the place!" Comparing the terrain before him to the map Gu Jia had provided, he confirmed he had arrived.  

At first glance, there was nothing here but a sheer cliff face. Even when he touched it, his hands met solid stone.  

Once again, he marveled at the wonders of cultivation. To mortals—or even unaware cultivators—this market would remain invisible, no matter how close they stood.  

Of course, Li Shiming was only at the second level of Qi Refining, so his perspective was limited.  

He channeled spiritual energy through his fingers, tracing a peculiar sigil in the air.  

As the glowing pattern materialized, the cliff face rippled, revealing an opening just wide enough for one person to pass through.  

Without hesitation, he stepped inside. Glancing back, he could still see the outside world from within.  

But he didn’t linger. He needed to appear experienced, not like a novice.  

Upon seeing the market, however, his excitement quickly turned to disappointment.  

Though the entrance was mystical, the interior was far from the bustling, celestial spectacle he had imagined.  

The entire market could be taken in at a glance—a narrow path barely a hundred meters long.  

Stalls were scattered along the path at irregular intervals. Whether it was due to the early hour or simply the market’s small size, there were only about a dozen stalls in total.  

A similar number of cultivators—around ten or so—moved between them.  

Several of these cultivators concealed their faces, as did some of the stall owners.  

The hidden vendors simply laid their goods on cloth spread over the ground, while the more open ones at least displayed their wares on tables.  

According to Gu Jia, if he had surplus resources, he could sell them to the stall owners or set up his own spot.  

However, setting up a stall required handing over ten percent of the earnings, so selling directly to vendors was often the better choice.  

Li Shiming pushed his "Breath Concealment Art" to its limit, suppressing the fluctuations of his spiritual energy vortex.  

Approaching the first stall, he examined the items on the wooden table.  

The most eye-catching was a vertical plaque bearing the character "Hao" alongside intricate runic patterns.  

The stall specialized in talisman-related goods.  

Talisman paper, ink, and brushes were on display. The paper, a pale yellow-green, was bundled in stacks of a hundred sheets.  

Three brushes were available, their shafts engraved with complex patterns, the bristles faintly pulsing with spiritual energy.  

The ink was the most abundant, as different talismans required different formulations.  

Li Shiming had read about this in "Introduction to Runes." With the right materials, he could even prepare such ink himself.  

There were also pre-made talismans, though only one of each kind was displayed.  

He recognized the "Basic Lightness Talisman," "Basic Fireball Talisman," "Basic Ice Arrow Talisman," and "Basic Earth Armor Talisman"—all of which he possessed. The others were unfamiliar, their purposes unknown to him.
