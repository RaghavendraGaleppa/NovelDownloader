# Chapter 162: The Outcome of Often Walking at Night

A warm current surged within Qin Ming, making him feel hot. He quickly approached, genuinely calling out, "Grandpa Li!"

He had suffered poverty in his youth, relying on his grandfather for survival. In his teenage years, he was abandoned by the Cui family, sent out to serve his last purpose, stranded on Black-White Mountain, where he had nearly died, lost his memory, and suffered from hunger and cold. He had deeply experienced the vicissitudes of life. Therefore, whenever others showed him kindness and offered help, he would always be profoundly grateful.

"Why is your face all bruised? Did the old fogeys from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court hit you?" Li Qingyun's expression subtly changed. He pressed Qin Ming's shoulder, examining him closely. He naturally didn't believe that someone of the same age could bully the youth before him.

"Grandpa Li, I'm fine. These are injuries from cultivation," Qin Ming said with a forced laugh. In the past two days, he had been using subterranean fire to draw down heavenly lightning, internally refining the grand medicine, leaving himself somewhat disheveled. As he spoke, he began to absorb Yi Wood essence from near the mountain gate, nourishing his flesh, blood, and spirit.

Li Qingyun was surprised. "Oh, you can do that? Many people have studied the Yi Wood Sutra for years, able to cultivate techniques for killing enemies, but few can truly resonate with plants and trees. How long has it been? You're quite something, kid! Amazing!"

He relaxed, then lowered his voice. "In the past two days, I heard that a remarkable prodigy appeared in the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, with unparalleled talent. He single-handedly overwhelmed a group of geniuses from the Wildlands Immortal Land. Is that true?"

"Yes, it's a youth named Qi Zizai. He is indeed extraordinary," Qin Ming replied, stopping the circulation of the Yi Wood Sutra. After all, they were near the mountain gate, and he didn't want to create a surging green aura.

"Senior Brother Qi Zizai will surely be the ancestor who restores the Six Imperial Ancestral Court to its former glory!" A youth passing by immediately spoke up upon hearing the conversation. Two female disciples exiting the mountain gate also nodded in agreement, acknowledging the statement.

"As expected of one of the strongest orthodoxies on the Path of the Newborne. The Six Imperial Ancestral Court lives up to its reputation," Li Qingyun echoed, naturally choosing his words carefully on another's territory. At the same time, he suspected that Qi Zizai was very likely related to little Qin.

"Grandpa Li, I'll go say goodbye to a friend before we leave," Qin Ming said, heading to bid farewell to Lu Zizai.

Li Qingyun looked towards the young man in coarse linen clothes in the distance. At first glance, he seemed ethereal and steady, but upon closer inspection, Li Qingyun's heart sank—he couldn't see through him! Then, he noticed the small golden bird on the youth's shoulder. His heart trembled instantly; it was definitely not an ordinary species, resembling a legendary creature. Moreover, within the palm-sized bird, there seemed to be surging golden blood qi flowing. If it truly erupted, the scene would undoubtedly be terrifying.

Li Qingyun cupped his fists, no longer treating Lu Zizai as a mere youth. His heart was far from calm.

Lu Zizai looked over and nodded at him.

"Senior Brother Lu, I'm leaving!" Qin Ming approached, speaking few words.

"The scripture you cultivate is actually extremely dangerous. I don't know if you can truly master it to the end. Don't rush to merge it with top-tier texts; it won't benefit you. You must proceed step by step, otherwise, as time passes, you might suddenly explode. Historically, even grandmasters who participated couldn't endure it. Pay attention to refining true功 (achievement/skill) with worldly fire," Lu Zizai secretly transmitted his voice. Then, he pointed to the exotic bird on his shoulder. "Little Gold has always been raised freely, not really cared for. It once had a brother who was much more favored, staying in the mountain gate all day, listening to various scriptures, and being fed spiritual medicines by the elders. It seemed extraordinary, but when it was finally released, it was treated as a blood-meat medicine and easily slaughtered."

Qin Ming quickly interjected, "Senior Brother Lu, stop talking, such analogies aren't good."

"You're overthinking it. This is a true old story. I'm leaving!" Lu Zizai turned and walked away, disappearing into the dark night at the horizon.

A night wind howled. A high-grade exotic bird tore through the clouds, flying at extreme speed across the sky, heading for Chixia City, fifteen thousand miles away.

"Is Qi Zizai really you?" Even though he had guessed it earlier, Li Qingyun's body still swayed slightly in the high altitude. In the past few days, he had been waiting outside, his ears almost calloused from listening.

"Grandpa Li, be careful," Qin Ming reminded. In such a pitch-black high altitude, if they were to fall, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Li Qingyun's old heart was greatly comforted. He had previously imagined Qin Ming's potential to be very high, but he hadn't expected to have still underestimated him.

"Recently, the Night Report often mentions renowned geniuses. Various figures are constantly emerging, with 'firsts' from different cities engaging in battles. There's even been a heaven-defying individual who swept through eighty-one cities. It's truly a time of surging currents. There are young grandmasters rising and even Pure Yang Bodies appearing on the Immortal Path. A new era seems to be dawning, sparking heated discussions everywhere..."

Li Qingyun conversed with Qin Ming about recent events during their journey. The high-grade exotic bird traversed the night sky, and as time passed, they were not far from Chixia City.

Suddenly, Li Qingyun's expression changed, and he roared, "Stop! Turn around!"

Qin Ming was also startled, his body involuntarily tensing up. The world was pitch black, with occasional city lights like fireflies on the ground. But now, ahead of them, a faint halo of light was spreading. It was brighter than the city lights, and they were still far from it. Most importantly, they were currently high in the sky, and that halo was clearly within the clouds, which was somewhat terrifying. The distant faint blue light appeared very soft, as if spreading gently, yet it brought forth an explosive roar from ahead. As it surged, the thick cloud layers shattered!

"Faster! We're going to be caught!" Li Qingyun exclaimed, finally encountering an anomaly.

The Night Mist World was incredibly mysterious. Even after the Great Reclamation, in the territories occupied by humans, there would sometimes appear inexplicable phenomena—some bizarre, some terrifying, some mysterious and strange—all difficult to comprehend.

"Little Qin, have you put on your 'wing suit'?" Li Qingyun asked amidst the violent turbulence.

"Yes, I have!" Qin Ming responded.

Both of them were now prostrate on the back of the flying mount, very tense, because the high-grade exotic bird was trembling slightly.

"Old friend, what's wrong?" Li Qingyun transmitted his voice.

"I've lost my way, I can't see anything," the high-grade exotic bird's voice trembled.

The two people on its back felt their hearts go cold, as they discovered that their own five senses had also become dull and numb, their consciousness almost stiff. They had been covered by the faint blue mist; to be precise, that halo had expanded to this location, illuminating the night mist.

"You should be able to determine the ground direction, right? Land quickly."

The night mist near them surged and roared, then the world turned upside down. They continuously descended, tumbling, and finally plummeted towards an unknown destination.

"Don't worry, we're very close to the ground!" Li Qingyun shouted. Finally, he fell silent, because during the violent tumbling, they descended for a long time without touching down.

Until, the pale blue night mist overturned the high-grade exotic creature, like a raging storm, sending them crashing down. Both of their perceptions were numb, their reactions abnormally sluggish.

Qin Ming's Heaven's Light energy erupted throughout his body, and he spread his 'wing suit'. He was like a night bird, flapping its wings. However, in a short while, both of his 'wings' actually tore apart. He remembered Liu Laotou's words from Black-White Village: those who often walk at night encounter all kinds of terrifying and bizarre things. Now, he could only resign himself to fate. Qin Ming's various wondrous techniques resonated, and over twenty types of Heaven's Light energy merged into one, making him resemble a Golden Crow falling in the night mist.

In an extremely short time, he crashed onto the ground with a thud. Even with the protection of Heaven's Light, Qin Ming's vision went black and he fainted. His injuries were not that severe; it was mainly that his senses were numb, and he couldn't hold on any longer.

He didn't know how much time had passed, but he opened his eyes. The surrounding scenery was very blurry. Although there was a faint blue mist swirling, his five senses were slowly recovering, and his consciousness was gradually clearing. Qin Ming shook his head forcefully, noticing that he had smashed cracks into the ground. There were bloodstains around his mouth, but with Heaven's Light energy protecting him, his injuries were not that severe. He carefully sensed his condition. Although there was intense pain, his bones were not broken, and his internal organs were intact. He presumed he hadn't fallen from too great a height.

He immediately circulated the Destiny Altering Sutra, which could prolong life and enhance the vitality of flesh and blood. Then, he circulated the Yi Wood Sutra, capturing the essence of nearby plants and trees for healing. Finally, Qin Ming's senses completely recovered their sharpness. He stood up, circulated the Silk Book Technique, drew his Yak-Butter Iron Blade, and began to investigate the surroundings.

He silently searched nearby but found no trace of Li Qingyun or his flying mount. It must have been late night; the world was pitch black, with only faint blue mist swirling. Qin Ming searched for a long time, seeing no other unusual things. He called out, "Grandpa Li!" But he received no response.

Qin Ming sighed. "No wonder many masters are unwilling to cross the night sky. Bird crashes happen from time to time; no one can endure that." Currently, many incidents in the Night Mist World remain unexplained and incomprehensible.

He groped his way forward through the hazy blue mist, eventually showing a surprised look, because the area ahead felt somewhat familiar. This was a desolate area west of Chixia City. He was speechless; he had already reached his doorstep, yet he still crashed!

"I'm fine, so Grandpa Li should be even more resistant to falls, right?" Qin Ming believed that old Li should be unharmed.

Soon after, he crossed a barren slope and saw Chixia City in the heavy night. He quickened his pace. Along the way, the scenery became increasingly familiar. It was deep night, and the fire springs in the city were artificially controlled and covered, making the entire city appear very dim, with only faint light flowing. Moreover, blue mist permeated this place as well, making the entire city seem enveloped in a thin blue glow.

"It's Chixia City, the location is correct." Qin Ming stopped. On a large bluestone relatively far outside the city, he found a mark he had left long ago. Once, when leaving the city, he had casually 'tested his skill', leaving a deep fist-hole imprinted on it.

The magnificent city gate tower stood ahead. It was late at night, and the heavy city gates had long been closed. Qin Ming silently scaled a section of the city wall and entered.

"It's actually so quiet," he frowned. Although the section of the city wall he chose was in a remote area, it was still desolate and silent once he entered the city. The streets were empty, devoid of people. He walked forward. When he passed a night market, he felt a little uneasy. Even late at night, business here should be good, but now there wasn't a single person. Blue night mist flowed in the city, and the atmosphere was slightly eerie. Qin Ming held his Yak-Butter Iron Blade, walking alone through the silent city.

Several taverns in the bustling district, which would normally have customers even late at night, were now brightly lit but utterly silent, without a single sound. Qin Ming ascended to a tavern, finding it empty, not a single person in sight. Some tables were set with wine and dishes, and food, some even still steaming. This was far too abnormal. Qin Ming entered the backyard and then the kitchen, still finding no one.

Since he had already entered the city, he did not retreat immediately. He walked straight towards the City Lord's Mansion. There were no guards, no need to report, and he entered silently. Qin Ming walked into the familiar living room. All the bronze artifacts were still there. He even suspected that Meng Xinghai had been here not long ago, because the calming incense in the purple copper censer had only burned a small section, its fragrance still lingering, and on the wooden table, the tea in the cup seemed freshly brewed, with a faint aroma still wafting.

Qin Ming circled the City Lord's Mansion, finding it completely empty. His brows were deeply furrowed. Was all this caused by the pale blue night mist? The entire city, and even this area, was covered by it. This silence made one's heart pound. The vast Chixia City now resembled a ghost town, empty and devoid of any human presence.

Qin Ming arrived at the brightest spot in the city. This place had a Level 4 fire spring, plus a cluster of Level 1 and 2 fire springs. If they weren't covered by stone slabs, they could illuminate the night sky. His pupils contracted, greatly shocked. Because the fire spring was not emitting its normal red light, but a dense blue! Had this fire spring been "corrupted"? The spring pool was still there, but the blue liquid gushing out was highly abnormal, evaporating into the night sky, gradually turning into blue mist, covering the entire city and making it appear incredibly eerie.
