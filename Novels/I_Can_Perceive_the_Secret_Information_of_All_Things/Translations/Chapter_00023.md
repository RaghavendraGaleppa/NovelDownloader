# Chapter 23: Do We Really Need to Talk About This?

"Your Guixian Sect's internal conflicts shouldn't involve outsiders!" Xiao Ji's remark immediately drew the ire of the surrounding Guixian disciples, who crowded around to accuse him of speaking out of turn. They argued that their fellow disciple had been murdered by a mysterious woman, yet Xiao Ji was calling it an internal dispute.

"Friend, you shouldn't speak carelessly. Everything requires evidence," said the middle-aged Guixian cultivator reasonably, eyeing Xiao Ji seriously.

Now they wanted evidence? They'd been quick to accuse others without proof earlier.

"Senior brother, this Taoist is spouting nonsense and standing with that demon woman. They're clearly in cahoots. We should capture them first and ask questions later," urged the nostril-haired cultivator anxiously.

"I didn't—I didn't kill any Guixian disciples. You can't wrongfully accuse me," the plump female cultivator defended herself.

Many rogue cultivators and members of smaller sects in the vicinity, unaware of the specifics, watched the spectacle unfold.

"You approached my Lingkong shidi, and then he met with misfortune. How can you call this wrongful accusation?" The nostril-haired cultivator raised his voice.

The middle-aged cultivator raised a hand to silence him.

Perhaps believing himself more eloquent, he said, "If you claim to be wronged, then provide evidence. I've seen plenty like you—women who linger on airships, seducing cultivators for spirit stones. You must have noticed my Lingkong shidi's wealth and decided to kill and rob him."

"Now that you've murdered him, you've reunited with your accomplice, planning to disembark at the next stop and flee. How vicious."

The plump cultivator, unaccustomed to such situations, was at a loss for words.

Hearing himself implicated and accusations fabricated against him, Xiao Ji knew he had to speak up quickly before things turned violent.

The Guixian disciples' cultivation levels varied, with the middle-aged one at the early Foundation Establishment stage. In a real fight, Xiao Ji stood no chance.

"The burden of proof lies with you, the Guixian Sect. All you're doing is slinging mud. Isn't it shameful, especially on your own sect's airship?" Xiao Ji said calmly. "Call out whoever manages this vessel. Let's settle this properly in front of all these guests."

Such an expensive airship naturally had dedicated managers.

Soon, the Guixian airship's manager arrived—a white-haired Core Formation cultivator.

This was the highest-level cultivator Xiao Ji had encountered so far. From what he could tell, this elder was reasonable, meaning he could safely reveal what he'd perceived earlier.

The group first went to Lingkong's room to examine the scene.

The deceased cultivator named Lingkong lay naked under a thin cloth, his body covered in bruises, scratches, whip marks, and candle wax. Blood had seeped from all seven orifices, yet his deathly expression was one of a smile.

It was utterly bizarre.

After sealing off the scene, the elder manager had everyone move to the deck, as the cabin was too cramped for so many people.

"Explain why you went to see Guixian's Lingkong. Don't leave out any details," Xiao Ji began questioning the plump cultivator on deck.

"Do we really need to talk about this?" Her face flushed red with discomfort.

"Speak freely, miss. This is a Guixian airship. Though we're merely a third-rate sect attached to secular cultivation, we have some reputation. If you're innocent, I won't make trouble for you," the elder manager assured her.

"I'm just a courtesan cultivator. Before Lingkong's accident, I did visit his room because... he needed my services. He said he liked plump women like me..." She began recounting her encounter with Lingkong. "He was quick but wanted more. He asked if I had candles or such things. I said yes, so..."

"Enough!" The nostril-haired cultivator fumed. "Elder Cui, we can't listen to her nonsense! She's taking advantage of Lingkong shidi's silence to spin tales... Shidi was handsome and talented, our sect's rising star. He'd never spar with such a... massive opponent."

His words were harsh but somewhat logical.

The elder also found the woman's story dubious. Even if Lingkong had poor taste, surely he wouldn't stoop so low.

Moreover, her overly detailed descriptions—candles, whips, joyous screams—were unnecessary.

The middle-aged Guixian cultivator stepped forward regretfully. "If so, then Lingkong shidi died from overindulgence. But this still involves you. You must answer for his death."

Having organized his gathered information, Xiao Ji finally spoke up: "According to you, Lingkong was Guixian's rising genius, reaching Foundation Establishment in just a few years of cultivation... How could a Foundation Establishment genius be overpowered by a Qi Refining first-level courtesan? Impossible. Even ten of her wouldn't be a match."

"What exactly are you implying?" The middle-aged cultivator's calm demeanor began cracking, his tone turning sharp.

"I'm saying Lingkong's death has little to do with this lady," Xiao Ji approached him with a mocking smile. "What truly killed him was several petty, fragile hearts consumed by jealousy."

"What do you mean?" The elder manager frowned. "Please explain clearly."

The middle-aged cultivator and others looked equally confused by the vague statement.

Seeing their reactions, Xiao Ji continued, "You might have missed it during your inspection, but Lingkong's body carried a floral scent—a blend of seven spiritual flowers. Recently, I happened to hear of the Seven Flowers Spirit Concentration Pill, a unique Guixian elixir, correct?"

Xiao Ji adapted his findings to make his explanation more palatable.

"Please elaborate," the elder pressed, still perplexed.

"I'm suggesting Lingkong ingested this expensive pill before his death," said Xiao Ji.

"I gave Lingkong shidi that pill. The Seven Flowers Spirit Concentration Pill greatly benefits cultivators. Even our disciples can't obtain it easily. I'd saved one, knowing it'd be wasted on me, so I gifted it to Lingkong shidi—our sect's future hope—to boost his cultivation," the nostril-haired cultivator glared at Xiao Ji. "But how does this relate to his death?"

Indeed, what was the connection? Spectators murmured, unable to grasp the link.

It was common for sect members to gift precious pills, artifacts, or even techniques to each other—not just among fellow disciples, but even between acquainted rogue cultivators. Such generosity symbolized mutual support.

Yet Xiao Ji's next words shocked everyone present.
