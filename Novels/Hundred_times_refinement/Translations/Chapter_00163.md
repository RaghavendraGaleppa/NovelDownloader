# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 111: Alchemy Talent  

Lin Xian sipped fragrant tea while admiring the paintings adorning the walls of the elegantly decorated reception room—a refined space reserved for honored guests of the Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

Having waited for nearly an hour, Lin Xian remained patient. Through subtle inquiries, he had gleaned more information about the sect from the outer disciple attending him. Initially reserved, the young attendant gradually warmed to Lin Xian's gentle demeanor. Gaining favor with a Foundation Establishment cultivator could bring immense benefits, especially if rewarded with a treasure or two.  

Though Lin Xian lacked spiritual roots, he was sharp-witted. Recognizing the attendant's hopes, he retrieved a small, gleaming dagger from his robes—a foot-long blade sharp enough to slice through hair. While not a spirit artifact, it bore a faint spiritual aura, far surpassing ordinary mortal weapons. It was a keepsake he had acquired from a fallen cultivator.  

To cultivators, the blade was useless, but to mortals, it was priceless. The attendant was overjoyed by the gift and eagerly shared everything he knew.  

Learning that several alchemists of Spirit Medicine Mountain had recently passed away, Lin Xian's mind stirred with possibilities...  

Just then, Elder Tongyu entered the room. The attendant immediately fell silent, bowed respectfully, and withdrew.  

Seeing the white-bearded elder, Lin Xian rose and greeted him.  

"No need for formalities, Fellow Daoist," Tongyu said warmly. "You have yet to join our sect—we may address each other as peers."  

Though he had heard of Lin Xian's youth through the message talisman, Tongyu was still astonished to see such a young Foundation Establishment cultivator. Talent like this—achieving Foundation Establishment before twenty—was rare, appearing perhaps once in a century. Could someone like this truly wish to join Spirit Medicine Mountain?  

Lin Xian remained composed, his expression unreadable.  

"You have an interest in alchemy?" Tongyu asked.  

"Yes," Lin Xian replied smoothly. "Though the path of cultivation encompasses myriad arts, I have always been fascinated by alchemy. Yet, lacking proper guidance, I could only admire Spirit Medicine Mountain from afar."  

Though lying, Lin Xian's demeanor betrayed nothing. Pleased, Tongyu led him to an alchemy chamber.  

"Please leave any treasures or herbs here temporarily," Tongyu instructed.  

Lin Xian hesitated.  

"Do not be concerned—this is our sect's rule," Tongyu explained. "Though you claim an interest in alchemy, joining our sect requires proof of talent. You must demonstrate your aptitude through a test."  

Unlike spiritual roots, alchemical talent couldn't be discerned at a glance. Candidates were required to refine pills on the spot. Success determined acceptance; failure meant rejection, regardless of cultivation level.  

To prevent cheating, all personal items had to be surrendered before entering the chamber.  

"Rest assured, our sect has upheld this tradition for centuries. Your belongings will remain untouched and returned after the test."  

With no room to refuse, Lin Xian handed over his storage bracelet. After confirming Lin Xian carried no hidden items, Tongyu produced a jade vial.  

"These are ingredients for three Marrow-Cleansing Pills. Refine them one by one. Tomorrow, I will inspect the results. Succeed even once, and you may join us."  

The Marrow-Cleansing Pill was the simplest pill in cultivation, yet even skilled alchemists had only a fifty percent success rate. For a novice, one success out of three would be remarkable.  

Alchemy?  

Lin Xian accepted the vial, his face calm but his heart alight with triumph.  

Heaven itself was aiding him!  

Though he had once studied alchemy to refine high-grade pills, Lin Xian knew he lacked innate talent. His past successes relied on simpler secondary refinement, the aid of Perseverance Grass, and sheer luck.  

Had this been a genuine test, even ten attempts might not yield a single pill.  

But Lin Xian wasn't worried—his blue star sea could transform waste into treasure. Failure meant nothing; he could purify impurities from dud pills.  

After bidding Tongyu farewell, Lin Xian entered the chamber. The stone door sealed shut behind him.  

A flame burned at the chamber's center—a testament to the famed Fire Vein Mountain's prowess. Though drawn from the earth's veins, its heat rivaled a Foundation Establishment cultivator's innate flame. Even the cauldron was extraordinary. In terms of alchemical resources, Spirit Medicine Mountain surpassed all other sects in Youzhou.  

With a wave, Lin Xian summoned the cauldron and poured in all the ingredients at once. Why bother refining them individually when he had the blue star sea?  

He channeled the earth flame and began.  

Three hours later, he lifted the lid. A charred stench filled the air—no trace of the pill's fragrance. A complete failure.  

Sighing, Lin Xian set aside his disappointment. Though he had relied on his secret, he had genuinely tried his best. Alchemy was a valuable skill, and part of him longed to excel.  

Yet failure was inevitable.  

Shaking off his frustration, he picked up the three ruined pills. After a moment's thought, he selected one and began purification.  

Of all pills, the Marrow-Cleansing Pill was his most familiar. Now at Foundation Establishment, the process took mere minutes.  

The blackened pill turned white, its foul odor replaced by a sweet fragrance—a mid-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pill!  

Tongyu had only required a low-grade pill for admission, yet Lin Xian had produced a mid-grade one.  

This wasn't mere showmanship. Lin Xian lived by caution, but this time, he had a purpose.  

Joining Spirit Medicine Mountain wasn't truly about alchemy—it was about their centuries of accumulated Foundation Establishment dud pills.  

Even the sect's skilled alchemists failed often. Over millennia, they had amassed countless ruined pills.  

Unlike his days in Drifting Cloud Vale, Lin Xian couldn't simply take charge of the dud storage now. Foundation Establishment dud pills, though worthless compared to proper ones, still had minor uses and were carefully recorded.  

Stealing them was too risky. Spirit Medicine Mountain, though not a combat-focused sect, was wealthy. Their dud storage would be heavily warded.  

Getting caught would mean death and the ruin of his plans.  

Unless absolutely necessary, Lin Xian wouldn't resort to theft.
