# Chapter 7: The Secret to Metal-Water Cultivation

Liu Yun was well aware of the difficulties of cultivating multiple cultivation methods, having experienced them firsthand. He now shared all of his experiences with Ding Rui, holding nothing back.

"Cultivating one method after another will waste a lot of time, even your lifespan. If you cultivate two methods and want to establish your foundation, both must simultaneously reach Qi Condensation Stage Two, then Stage Three. Otherwise, if one method becomes too strong, the other method or methods will be affected, either failing completely, clashing with each other, or even causing qi deviation."

"Even if there are no issues normally, problems will definitely arise when breaking through a realm and your true essence isn't stable."

"My current cultivation isn't high precisely because I aim to master all five cultivation methods. That's why I've completely stopped cultivating the 'Raindrop Art' for now. I plan to become a Spirit Farmer after mastering all five, then I'll consider breakthroughs."

"As long as the strengths of two cultivation methods are imbalanced, you must constantly pay attention to this."

"Therefore, cultivators without the talent for multitasking usually choose to specialize in one cultivation method. This requires fewer resources and allows for faster breakthroughs. Cultivation is for power and longevity; no matter how many methods you cultivate, a Qi Condensation cultivator is no match for a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"

"However, the advantages of cultivating multiple methods are also obvious: true essence becomes deeper and more abundant, allowing for more actions."

"Of course, it also consumes more resources, which is why sects reward cultivators who practice multiple methods."

Currently, even though the 'Golden Radiance Art' was only at Qi Condensation Stage One and produced gaseous true essence, it was sufficient for his use in the spirit fields. Moreover, true essence was generally not consumed. For instance, when killing insects, the true essence would return to the cultivator's body afterward. Only when true essence was shattered by large aphids or other attacks would it dissipate, requiring recultivation to recover. Otherwise, if true essence was depleted with every use, how could one ever cultivate to higher realms? For example, if thirty years of accumulated true essence were used up in one go, wouldn't it take another thirty years to recover? That made no sense.

...

Liu Yun had a deep understanding of the 'Raindrop Art'. Under Liu Yun's guidance, Ding Rui's progress in cultivating the 'Raindrop Art' was incredibly fast, making leaps and bounds compared to when he had fumbled his way through the 'Golden Radiance Art' on his own! The most crucial part of initial cultivation was controlling the unaligned true essence to travel a completely new path through the meridians. Furthermore, the sensation of true essence flowing through each meridian was different. Using the feel of the 'Golden Radiance Art' to cultivate the 'Raindrop Art' would only bring self-inflicted suffering. This was because meridians generally repelled true essence that didn't match their own attribute. Meridians of different attributes had different levels of repulsion. Ding Rui had to discover the characteristics of the meridians in this new environment before he could determine the appropriate speed and intensity to control the true essence's flow. When to go fast, when to go slow.

It couldn't be that water could truly be born from metal, could it?

"Because true essence of the Metal attribute and true essence of the Water attribute not only don't repel each other, but actually have a slight attractive force!"

"In other words, your Metal attribute true essence can actually enter the meridians used by the 'Raindrop Art' without causing significant conflict with them."

"Due to the mutual generation between Metal and Water attributes, the 'Raindrop Art' meridians repel Metal attribute true essence far less than they repel unaligned true essence!"

"Therefore..." Liu Yun patiently guided him, "Do you understand?"

"So... I can directly convert the true essence of the 'Golden Radiance Art' into the true essence of the 'Raindrop Art'?" Ding Rui asked, a little uncertain. He remembered that attributed true essence couldn't be converted a second time. Yet, Liu Yun's words seemed to imply exactly that. He couldn't be sure.

Upon hearing this, Liu Yun's smile instantly dropped. "Attributed true essence cannot be converted again. Don't you even know that?"
