# Chapter 166: Sudden Change

The surrounding towering ancient forest had been flattened, leaving only a massive palm print glaringly visible. Zhang Jing stood in place, not having moved an inch, his eyes filled with calm indifference. He hadn't used any spells—merely channeled the mana from his dantian and fused it with the Five Elements Dao Intent before casually striking out. Yet even so, the power unleashed was far beyond what those dozen ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators could withstand.

His gaze swept lightly over the devastated scene before him, and Zhang Jing couldn't help but recall the time when Lu Thirty-Eight had carried him, fleeing in disarray from Langya County amidst the aftermath of a Foundation Establishment battle. It all felt as though it had happened just yesterday.

"Without realizing it, I've already come this far?" A wave of dazed realization washed over him.

Snapping out of his reverie, Zhang Jing waved his hand lightly. The transformed Duobao River, now a mid-grade magic seed, returned from the distance like a shimmering white jade ribbon, coiling gently around his wrist.

"Duobao River, as a mid-grade magic seed, has reached its limit after fusing with nine magic weapon embryos. Even with Dao Intent enhancement, it's still far inferior to the pseudo-Primordial Origin Divine Light. After advancing to the Golden Core realm, I'll need to find a way to upgrade it," Zhang Jing mused to himself.

Shifting his gaze from the Duobao River, he looked into the distance, taking in the undulating mountain ranges stretching endlessly before him.

"Next, I just need to find a quiet place and wait for the first round to end," Zhang Jing murmured, exhaling softly as a relaxed smile graced his lips.

With a single step forward, his figure transformed into a streak of light skimming the ground, vanishing into the vast expanse of mountains in the blink of an eye.

Not long after, in a dense forest about a hundred zhang away from the battlefield, rustling sounds broke the silence as nine figures emerged, their faces filled with fear as they stared in the direction Zhang Jing had disappeared.

"Whew~ Good thing you were wise, boss," a plump young man said with a sigh, his voice thick with relief.

"Yeah, yeah!" a woman chimed in hurriedly. "If we'd attacked just now, we'd probably be in the same state as those guys. By the way, boss, how did you know that guy was someone we couldn't mess with?"

At her words, the others turned their gazes toward the white-robed man standing at the front, their eyes unconsciously filled with respect.

"Haha," the white-robed man laughed heartily before declaring confidently, "You all lack experience, so of course you couldn't tell. But I'm different—I've seen countless cultivators. I can tell at a glance whether someone's strong or not."

"Boss is amazing!"

"Truly worthy of being our leader. With you guiding us, we'll definitely make it to the next round," the others exclaimed in admiration.

Meanwhile, unnoticed by the group, the white-robed man quickly wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, his eyes brimming with relief. What keen insight did he have? He'd simply hesitated because the other group had more people than his own. And in that brief moment of hesitation... the other group had been effortlessly wiped out.

Thinking of this, the white-robed man couldn't help but glance at the massive palm print nearby, a trace of horror flashing in his eyes. That person was likely a seeded disciple from a celestial immortal sect... or perhaps even one of those top-tier prodigies from the Seven Sacred Grounds.

On a viewing platform in the middle layer of the Jiaoyun Secret Realm, the pair of male and female cultivators who had been closely observing Zhang Jing were now frozen in their seats, their expressions slightly stiff.

After what felt like an eternity, the beautiful woman finally broke into a smile. "Heh, those guys finally got what they deserved. Serves them right for relying on numbers to ambush others—they finally kicked an iron plate and got their comeuppance."

Her sparkling eyes lingered on Zhang Jing's image in the projection before she suddenly turned to the man beside her, lifting her chin proudly to expose her slender, fair neck. "Hey, didn't you say he was from some backwater place?" she asked, her demeanor resembling that of a proud little peacock.

Seeing her expression, the man clutched his chest, his face flushing red. He knew that person was strong, but words of praise stuck in his throat. After a moment's thought, he said sourly, "Yun'er, he is indeed powerful. But he's too reserved—completely lacking the heart of a true powerhouse. Compared to the other top monsters in the competition, he's like mud to their clouds. Look at those others—everyone's attention is on them."

With that, he directed the woman—Yun'er—toward the center of the first competition arena.

There, atop a modest hundred-zhang-tall hill, hundreds of Jiaoyun Decrees were piled up, their golden radiance converging into what looked like a miniature sun. Tens of thousands of cultivators surrounded the hill, their gazes fixed intently upon it.

A piercing screech tore through the skies. Following the sound, they saw a golden-feathered Roc with crimson eyes, its plumage gleaming like forged gold. The terrifying gale winds that others feared merely sparked harmlessly against its body, unable to dislodge even a single feather.

"Hahaha, is this all you humans are capable of?" the Roc crowed arrogantly. "The Jiaoyun Decrees are right there. Anyone who can last ten breaths against me can take one. Yet not a single one of you can manage it! Pathetic! It seems the title of Foundation Establishment champion in this Jiaoyun Secret Realm will belong to me!"

Below, the crowd gnashed their teeth in frustration, but none dared to act. Over the past ten days, this monstrous Roc from the Myriad Spirit Faction had eliminated over ten thousand human cultivators—even a prodigy from the Zhou Tian Star Palace, one of the Seven Great Sacred Grounds, had been effortlessly crushed by it.

"Is there really no one who can deal with this Roc? This is happening in human territory!" someone cried out in anguish.

But the only response was the Roc's maniacal laughter from above.

On the viewing platform, Yun'er stared blankly, her fists clenching unconsciously. Noticing this, the man beside her smiled and guided her attention to the ninety-ninth competition arena. "What you just saw was a top-tier prodigy from the Myriad Spirit Faction. Now, this is one of our human race's true geniuses—his domineering aura surpasses even that Roc's."

Yun'er followed his gaze and gasped. "Heavens!"

Before her eyes, a golden-robed young man strode unwaveringly through a forest of towering stone pillars. A terrifying, multicolored radiance condensed within a three-zhang radius around him. Wherever he passed, the massive stone pillars crumbled into dust as though nothing could impede his advance.

Cultivators who spotted this terrifying phenomenon from afar paled and fled immediately.

---

Snapping back to reality, Yun'er couldn't help but glance at Zhang Jing, who was now meditating quietly, a trace of worry flashing in her eyes. Faced with such formidable opponents... Meanwhile, the man beside her continued chattering, "See that existence? That's a true genius! He's our only hope against that monstrous Roc!"

---

In the ninety-ninth competition arena, the "true genius" Qu Junhou was gloating to a fragmented spirit in his consciousness. "Haha, teacher, how's this move of mine?"

"Can't find the way? No problem—just make one! As long as I keep moving forward, I'll get out of this stone forest soon. I'm a genius!"

"Yet you said the same thing eight days ago," the fragmented spirit retorted drily.

Qu Junhou's expression froze before he muttered sheepishly, "Maybe... I'll get out tomorrow?"

The elderly spirit sighed. "Disciple, why don't we just fly out from above? Those gale winds shouldn't be a problem for you."

"No! Teacher, I swore an oath to walk out of here properly. This might help me overcome my tendency to get lost once and for all. If I take shortcuts now, what will I do when there aren't any next time?" Qu Junhou declared resolutely.

"But is this really 'walking' out?" the spirit grumbled internally before reminding him, "You've only got twenty days left, and you haven't found a single Jiaoyun Decree yet. Time's running out."

"Don't worry, teacher," Qu Junhou replied confidently. He wasn't stupid—he knew what mattered most.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

At the edge of the twenty-ninth competition arena, atop a solitary mountain peak, Zhang Jing sat in meditation. This was the secluded spot he'd chosen, rarely disturbed by others. But suddenly—


The ground began to tremble violently.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes, confusion flickering in his gaze. What was happening? The thirty-day limit for the first round shouldn't have been reached yet.

Just as he pondered this, a shrill scream pierced the air. "Help me!"

Turning toward the sound, Zhang Jing's pupils contracted. The edges of the competition arena were collapsing. A man who failed to react in time tumbled down with the crumbling mountain, vanishing in a flash of white light. A Jiaoyun Decree appeared where he'd stood, then transformed into a golden streak shooting toward the arena's interior before disappearing.

Meanwhile, the collapse at the arena's edges intensified, rapidly spreading inward. Simultaneously, the Jiaoyun Mark on Zhang Jing's body erupted with golden light that no spell could conceal.

Seeing this, a thoughtful glint appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes. "Interesting. So this is the first round's final twist." His gaze deepened. These last ten days in the competition arena were going to get lively indeed!
