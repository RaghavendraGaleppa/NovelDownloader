# Chapter 143: The Overlord’s Might, The Treasure Revealed

In Qingning County, at the Lin residence, Lin Aoshan—the Xuanhou of the Patrol Heaven Division—was temporarily staying at Lin Guolong’s manor.

It was high noon. In the courtyard pavilion, Lin Aoshan sat cooling herself, though the incessant cicada chirping was grating on her nerves. Servants waved纱网 (silk nets) to catch the cicadas in the trees. She sat with her legs crossed, her figure accentuated by the posture. She couldn't help but complain about the poor location of the estate; the sun scorched the courtyard, trapping the summer heat with nowhere to escape.

She wore the standard uniform of the Patrol Heaven Division. Though it looked heroic and valiant, the fabric was thick and stiflingly hot. Her clothes and boots were already soaked with sweat. The fruit plate held iced watermelon, but once eaten, the coolness faded instantly, doing nothing to relieve the heat.

"Xiao Sun, why are you rushing about like this?"

Lin Aoshan frowned as she watched Lin Guolong running back and forth, his short legs blurring with speed. Annoyed by the disturbance, she called out to him.

Lin Guolong approached respectfully, bowing like a junior. "Good Grandma, you don't know the half of it. A huge incident has happened in our county!"

"Oh?" Lin Aoshan asked. "What big event?"

"It's chaos, total chaos!" Lin Guolong said. "Early this morning, the people from the Three Halls and Two Gangs acted as if they had planned it. They started several brawls on Xifeng Street, Luofan Street, and Shuixiang Street."

"If they just fought, that would be one thing—they are martial folk, after all, and likely have grudges against each other. But they disturbed the citizens so much that no one dared open their shops. Even that might be forgivable. The key issue is that people died in the fighting, and the matter isn't over yet."

"This is very bad. The situation has escalated so much that as the County Magistrate, I should do something, but I don't know how to handle it. I'm at a complete loss. Good Grandma, perhaps you could help your little Sun? Use the name of the Patrol Heaven Division to intimidate them? Put a lid on it?"

Lin Aoshan shook her head. "You... if you had even a shred of luck, would you be in such a passive position?"

Lin Guolong put on an ingratiating smile and began massaging her shoulders. "How could I possess such talent? My master doesn't think much of me."

"Luck cannot be begged for," Lin Aoshan said. "Luck begged for cannot be kept. If Master Fu were to pass his luck to you, it would truly be a waste."

"When scholars have luck, they can reason with others. They can argue the rights and wrongs, and no one would dare treat it lightly."

"You are right to admonish me, Good Grandma, but we need to find a solution right now," Lin Guolong said.

"If I'm not mistaken, these so-called gang fights are just an excuse," Lin Aoshan said, picking up a piece of iced watermelon and eating it as she spoke. "This is... targeting that Martial Captain."

"Ah!" Lin Guolong suddenly understood. "So that's it. That makes things difficult for Brother Li."

Lin Aoshan crossed her legs, looking intrigued. "I'm curious to see if this new Martial Captain can suppress them."

"Besides... the story of taking the enemy general's head amidst ten thousand soldiers hasn't been witnessed by anyone personally."

"Whether it's true or false, we can see the truth of it from this."

Having finished the watermelon, she wiped the juice from her hands onto Lin Guolong's clothes and smiled. "Xiao Sun, come with your Grandma to watch the excitement."

"Good Grandma, shouldn't we bring some troops?" Lin Guolong asked.

"No need," Lin Aoshan said.

She immediately set out lightly dressed, heading to Wengwu Street to find an open space and watch the show.

***

At Wengwu Street, personnel from various sects gathered in front of the Spring Leaf Martial Hall.

Li Xian, led by a guide, arrived at the location. The guide said, "Martial Captain, he is inside. Please hurry and mediate!" Then he ran off in a flash.

The street wasn't wide, and now the various sect members were packed together, blocking the way. People pushed against each other, forming a solid human wall that was impenetrable.

Wang Wu stepped forward and said, "大人 (Sir), I will clear a path for you."

He then shouted at the crowd, "Martial Captain has arrived! Clear the way immediately!"

His voice was loud and clear. Even amidst the noise, it should have been heard by all. However, no one paid any attention. They continued to push and squeeze, as if afraid Li Xian might slip through.

"The Martial Captain is here! Can't you hear?!" Zhang Hou stepped forward and roared.

From the crowd came jeers:

"Martial Captain? Who's that? Never heard of it. What does that position even do?"

"Yeah, this is a martial world dispute. What is this 'Martial Dog' Captain doing here?"

"Maybe he's hungry and came looking for water?"

"Hahaha, then he's made a mistake. But hey... if the Captain doesn't mind, I'm bursting right now. I've got plenty of 'golden water' for him."

"Hahahaha."

Zhang Hou and Wang Wu were furious. "How dare you disrespect the Martial Captain!" They stepped forward simultaneously, grabbing a man by the shoulders and yanking him back.

After throwing the man aside, they continued to force their way through to display the Captain's authority. But when they grabbed the third person, as soon as their hands touched his shoulders, they felt their palms go numb and their bodies go weak with shock.

There were hidden experts in the crowd. The internal Qi had rebounded against them. Although Zhang Hou and Wang Wu were young and strong, they couldn't withstand such a covert technique.

With a scream, they were sent flying. They almost crashed to the ground, but Li Xian caught them with his hands.

"Martial Captain, this..." Zhang Hou said, his face filled with shame.

Mocking laughter came from the crowd again: "Ignorant brats, do you really think you're something? Now you know how high the sky is and how thick the earth is. You know why I'm your grandpa now, right?"

"Hehe, if you call me 'Grandpa,' I might reluctantly let you pass."

"How about it? A bit of mouth work gets you in. Much better than forcing your way."

Li Xian patted their shoulders, showing no anger. He took a step forward and said calmly, "I will give you one last chance. If you don't move, you will bear the consequences."

"Go to hell, you bastard..." someone in the crowd cursed. Before he could finish, a large hand landed on his shoulder.

Immediately after, a tremendous force pulled him. He was thrown three zhang high!

Li Xian's eyes flashed with a sharp light. He sneered, his hands moving like lightning. He grabbed the shoulders of the person in front of him and violently threw him back.

Since he was acting personally, the force was naturally immense. The people blocking the path were like chickens. Some were thrown into walls, some onto roadside stalls, and some onto...

It was truly like a tiger entering a flock of sheep—irresistible, crushing everything in its path.

They refused a toast only to drink a forfeit. Li Xian struck again, and no one could stop him. When he grabbed an old man's shoulder, he sensed that this old man's internal Qi was quite strong. The old man was channeling his Qi downward, resisting with all his might.

"Little old man, at your age, and still being sharp-tongued... that can be fatal," Li Xian said coldly. He knew this was the one who had rebounded Qi against Zhang Hou and Wang Wu and had been shouting insults.

The old man, facing disaster, broke out in a cold sweat, terrified beyond measure. He竭力 (struggled) to channel his Qi to resist, but he felt like a moth trying to shake a tree; the gap was too vast. Despair filled his heart, and a wave of bitterness rose within him.

In the next instant, he felt a massive force pull him. With a scream, the old man was thrown out. Although he had internal Qi, his vitality was declining. With such a fall, he likely wouldn't survive.

On a distant pavilion, Lin Aoshan and Lin Guolong witnessed the scene. Lin Guolong exclaimed, "Brother Li is truly fierce."

Lin Aoshan said, "If he couldn't even pass this test, I would truly doubt his abilities."

"However... this boy's strength is quite impressive. Throwing people around like chickens. Looking at his expression, he doesn't seem strained at all, and he didn't even use internal Qi."

"Is it purely physical strength? That is extremely rare."

Her gaze shifted, looking toward the interior of the martial hall.

Inside the Spring Leaf Martial Hall, Miao Xichun looked grim. These people had turned a pretense into reality and had surrounded the hall completely.

It was packed tight.

Mei Ren毒 (Mei Ren Poison) sneered, "Hall Master Miao, please bring out that珍宝奇物 (rare treasure) and let us broaden our sights."

"That's right, Hall Master Miao," Hu Shengnan said proudly. "You should see the situation clearly. We have traveled thousands of miles just to catch a glimpse of the treasure. Surely you aren't so stingy?"

Miao Xichun said, "Hmph, you want to lay your hands on my treasure. But there is only one treasure, and there are four of you. If I really take it out, how will you divide it?"

"A good离间计 (stratagem of discord)," Iron Bear laughed loudly. "By that logic, Hall Master Miao is willing to surrender the treasure?"

Miao Xichun said, "As for surrendering it, that is no problem. But the question I just asked must be resolved."

"Gentlemen, before I take out the treasure, you had best think about how to divide it!"

"Let's avoid hurting our feelings and making a fool of ourselves in front of outsiders."

Although they knew it was a stratagem of discord, each of them harbored different intentions. None of them had thought deeply about how to exclude the others and secure the treasure for themselves.

The four thought: "The treasure is extremely rare. I must first find a way to make this old thief hand it over. Then... we will compete for it with our strength. There is no other way."

Hu Shengnan's eyes darted around, and she smiled. "Since Hall Master Miao is so generous and willing to hand over the treasure, then fine. This treasure should naturally go to the most capable."

"Our character and morality need not be said. We should compare skills and martial arts now. We are all martial artists. Why don't we exchange ten moves? The winner takes it."

"This way, we won't hurt our harmony, and we can fulfill Hall Master Miao's good intention. Why not?"

Miao Xichun's face darkened. Of all the people present, he hated Hu Shengnan the most. This entire dispute was挑起 (instigated) by this woman. And with just a few words, she claimed he was willing to "gift the treasure." She was truly shameless and opportunistic.

Miao Xichun forced a smile. "Hahaha, Sect Leader Hu makes a good point. Since that is the case, why don't I be the first to test your skills?"

With that, he leaped up. He raised his hand and executed the "Flying Flower Spring Leaf Hand." This was Miao Xichun's famous ultimate technique, showing that he was holding nothing back and wished to kill Hu Shengnan on the spot.

Hu Shengnan's expression changed. She had a glib tongue and thought her plans were brilliant. She didn't expect to anger Miao Xichun so much that he would drag her down with him.

In her panic, she raised her palm to meet the attack. Their palms met. Miao Xichun's internal Qi surged like a sea. If Hu Shengnan fought硬拼 (head-on), her internal Qi would be greatly depleted, making it impossible to compete for the treasure later. If she didn't fight head-on, she would inevitably be injured.

"Iron Bear, aren't you going to help?!" Hu Shengnan shouted.

Iron Bear of the Bear Paws Martial Hall sneered and stood still. He intended to let the two fight longer, mutually consuming each other's strength.

A moment later, Iron Bear struck suddenly. "Hall Master Miao, you are being unreasonable. You are the host; how can you take back a gift?"

"Sect Leader Hu, I'm here to help you."

He slapped Hu Shengnan's back, sending his internal Qi through her. With a "bang," Miao Xichun was knocked back several steps, seriously injured. Hu Shengnan also spat out a mouthful of blood, her aura withering.

Iron Bear's palm had injured Miao Xichun by sixty percent and Hu Shengnan by forty percent. He achieved two goals with one move; it was extremely insidious.

"Hall Master Miao, please hand over the treasure first. What happens after doesn't concern you," Zhou Long of the Savage Body Martial Hall said淡淡 (calmly).

Miao Xichun's eyes dimmed. He had been on good terms with Zhou Long. He never expected that in the face of treasure, friendship meant nothing.

"Hahaha, fine! I, Miao, admit defeat!"

He immediately took out the [Rare Treasure] from his chest.

Everyone's breathing quickened, their eyes unable to look away.

"So that's why they were fighting. It was over dividing the treasure."

"You guys are really something. For such a big event, why didn't you let the Martial Captain decide? Why are you fighting privately?"

At that moment, a voice rang out.

Li Xian stood at the door, the chaos behind him. He smiled lightly. "I have a brilliant idea that can resolve this dispute immediately. Why don't you all listen?"
