**Chapter 103: Stealing Beams and Replacing Pillars**

Lu Yang felt quite at ease regarding Zhao Xuhe. "Senior Brother Zhao has accumulated merit over three lifetimes and possesses ample fortune. He even attempted Foundation Establishment once before without my help. With my assistance, I believe his chances of success are even higher." It was merely a matter of time.

Lu Yang retracted his gaze and returned to his cave abode. He then summoned his Dharma Protector Goddess Su Nü and began cultivating the Corpse Dissolution Method and the Heavenly Silkworm Secret once more, leveraging his Foundation Establishment cultivation.

Ten days passed quickly, arriving at a dark and windy night.

"Junior Brother Lu, are you there?" Liu Xin had arrived.

Lu Yang responded, opening his cave abode with a grin. "You're here, Senior Brother! I've been waiting for you for a long time. It must have been hard for you to come all this way in the dead of night to deliver it."

Liu Xin was momentarily stunned. "Deliver what?"

Having done this in his previous life, Lu Yang's actions were incredibly swift and practiced. Before Liu Xin could even finish his sentence, Lu Yang extended a large True Qi hand. Liu Xin, who had been full of ambition and was about to refine this newly initiated disciple to break through to the late-stage Qi Refining realm, didn't even have time to react. He was seized by Lu Yang's True Qi hand and instantly refined into ashes, leaving behind only a Myriad Souls Banner that clattered to the ground.

Witnessing this, Lu Yang couldn't help but feel a touch of melancholy. The Senior Brother Liu who once filled him with resentment and helplessness had now become a stable source of "goods" for almost every one of his lives. After all, the Primal Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman was simply too useful.

"Speaking of concealing karma, I almost forgot... The Cloud Family Ancestor, that Foundation Establishment reincarnator, seems to possess an even more formidable heavenly secret treasure!" In his previous life, he had departed too early and missed out on it. This life would be different. Lu Yang intended to replicate his cultivation path from the life before last, establishing himself as a disciple of impeccable standing and loyalty within the Sacred Sect.

"The Cloud Family Ancestor's trip to the Dharma Refining Secret Realm can't be solely aimed at me; it's probably because he has designs on the secret realm itself. That heavenly secret treasure in his hand can even deceive a Golden Core True Monarch. If I enter beforehand and set up an ambush to acquire this treasure, it will definitely be of great benefit to my future cultivation!" Moreover, Lu Yang hadn't forgotten that the Cloud Family Ancestor had schemed against him in the secret realm. If not for his superior skill, he would have not only failed in his cultivation but also died there. This grudge must be repaid, or his Dao heart would remain unstable! Thinking of this, Lu Yang silently circled the Cloud Family Ancestor in his mental grudge notebook, marking him as one of his key targets for this life.

Inside the cave abode, Lu Yang sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion. Before him lay Liu Xin's Myriad Souls Banner, pure white in color—a stark contrast to the black-to-purple Myriad Souls Banner in Lu Yang's own Dantian.

The next second, Lu Yang activated his magic power. Liu Xin's Myriad Souls Banner shimmered, and Chen Xin'an immediately emerged from it. He first glanced around, then looked at Lu Yang with a face full of surprise. Following that, Lu Yang activated his own Myriad Souls Banner. Soon, the banner spirit Chen Xin'an also emerged, standing face-to-face with the original Chen Xin'an.

"Who are you!"
"Are you me?"

Both spoke almost the same words simultaneously. The difference was that the original Chen Xin'an was more shocked, while the banner spirit Chen Xin'an seemed to be imitating the former. Since Lu Yang planned for the banner spirit Chen Xin'an to undertake an undercover mission, he naturally had to ensure its loyalty. Therefore, he subjected the banner spirit Chen Xin'an to additional modifications, leaving numerous restrictions on it, just as he had with Su Nü. This ensured that it could not betray him, and he could make it vanish with a single thought.

"Do it."

The next second, Lu Yang waved his hand, and the banner spirit Chen Xin'an immediately complied. Without the slightest hesitation, it pointed a finger, piercing the original's soul. Until its dying breath, the original Chen Xin'an remained in confusion.

*Who killed me?*
*Who did I kill?*

With a deep sense of bewilderment, its soul abruptly dissipated, and its karma was inherited by the banner spirit Chen Xin'an, adding a touch of spiritual vivacity to its expression.

"From now on, you are the true Chen Xin'an!"

Lu Yang nodded in satisfaction, looking at the respectful banner spirit Chen Xin'an. He then inserted the Primal Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman into its body. The divine talisman contained a wisp of his divine sense. Under the talisman's protection, it would not be discovered by Foundation Establishment cultivators, allowing him to monitor the Butian Peak Master through the banner spirit Chen Xin'an, and, if necessary, take over its body. It could also help the banner spirit Chen Xin'an conceal its own karma. After completing all this, Lu Yang sent it away. As for the second Myriad Souls Banner, Lu Yang destroyed it and refined it into his own Myriad Souls Banner, using it to expand the internal grotto-heaven of his banner.

At the summit of Butian Peak, inside a tea pavilion.

The Butian Peak Master's mood was far from good. After all, the Coiled Dragon Legacy, which he had considered to be his for the taking, had suddenly vanished like a cooked duck. "What a pity. Although that legacy originated from Jiangxi and shouldn't be easily learned, I specifically created a Six Paths Nirvana Phoenix Art for Qian'er to cultivate, which could perfectly refine it. Now the cultivation method is gone, and Qian'er has lost a great opportunity. Who knows when she will be able to attempt Foundation Establishment..."

Thinking of this, the Butian Peak Master sighed again.

"If only my son were still here..."

Chen Xin'an, the Butian Peak Master's biological son and his most beloved disciple, had managed to cultivate a great divine ability at a young age, only one final step away from completion. Given time, if he broke through to the perfected Qi Refining realm, cultivated the Third-Rank Heaven-Mending True Qi, and completed his great divine ability, and if he, the Peak Master, found him a Foundation Establishment wonder treasure to assist, he would immediately have a thirty percent chance of attempting Foundation Establishment! Moreover, if he was willing to wait for the great Orthodox-Demonic War sixty years later, his chances could even increase by another ten percent!

*My son, Xin'an, possesses the potential for Foundation Establishment!*

Alas, heaven was jealous of talent. A treasure hunt led to his disappearance. No matter how much he deduced the karma, he couldn't find him, only vaguely sensing that he hadn't completely perished.

"Sigh..."

The Butian Peak Master sighed again. Suddenly, a karmic fluctuation appeared. He abruptly looked up, instinctively channeling his divine sense to the great karma net.

"This is... Xin'an's karma!?"

The next second, the Butian Peak Master rose sharply. His vast divine sense followed the great karma net back to its source, finally landing on a cave abode on Butian Peak. Inside the empty cave abode, a faint soul drifted in the air, on the verge of dissipating. Its consciousness was nearing its end; it wouldn't be surprising if it vanished the next second. Only a lingering wisp of regret echoed repeatedly, struggling like a dying man: "Father... forgive me..."

*Boom!*

The Butian Peak Master instantly traversed space, entering the cave abode. His boundless magic power forcefully stabilized the dissipating soul, miraculously gathering it back together! Behind the Butian Peak Master, the phantom of a merfolk appeared.

The Vermilion Merfolk Scale!

This Earth Fiend ability belonged to "Tuiīntān," gaining the essence of Gui Water. Although Gui Water is a realm of death within Tuiīntān, Tuiīntān also conceals Geng Metal, which can revive Gui Water. Thus, its meaning is "life from death." The Butian Peak Master in his previous life believed that even if Chen Xin'an's soul had truly scattered, as long as it was before him, he had the confidence to reassemble it. This belief was based on the miraculous nature of this Earth Fiend ability: no matter how fatal the injury, the Vermilion Merfolk Scale could turn danger into safety. The higher the cultivation, the stronger the magic power, and the better the effect. With the Butian Peak Master's mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, using the Vermilion Merfolk Scale on Chen Xin'an's Qi Refining soul made bringing the dead back to life a mere trifle!
