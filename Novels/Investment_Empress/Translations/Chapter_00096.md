Chapter 96: Business is Booming, Who Says Heroes Must Stand in the Light!

"Waiter, your hot pot is so delicious, I'm sure you've added some... illicit ingredients."

"Another plate of beef over here!"

"Do you offer takeout?"

The responses came swiftly, one after another.

Xiao Qin was frantically busy inside the shop. He had never expected that his fellow disciple, Li, was serious about opening a hot pot restaurant.

As he served the dishes, he couldn't help but wonder, "Master, I hope Li didn't add anything illicit to the hot pot. Otherwise, it's no wonder it's so delicious."

"Dear disciple, I need to discuss something with you," a voice said.

"Go ahead, Master," Xiao Qin replied.

"I need to use your body to taste it and verify your concerns."

As a powerful warrior, Qian Xing Wu Zun could temporarily possess Xiao Qin's body, but this method consumed a significant amount of spiritual energy.

Xiao Qin was taken aback, "Uh..."

He thought he should discuss this with Li when he had the chance. The hot pot didn't need to be this delicious.

It had only been three days since the opening, and the restaurant was already packed. If this continued, there would be a queue outside the door.

He deeply suspected that Li's true intention behind proposing this plan was to open a hot pot restaurant.

At the counter, a customer called out, "Proprietress, please settle the bill."

The proprietress, with ordinary looks but exceptionally beautiful eyes, was counting the money on an abacus. The small silver ingots were piled high beside her.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, gazing at the earnings, and a hint of satisfaction flickered in her clear eyes.

Initially, she thought Li's plan was absurd. However, as she counted the silver ingots, which held no significance to her, she felt an immersive sense of satisfaction.

Was this the life of an ordinary person?

"You're counting the money for the fourth time, Bing," Li said with a hint of amusement, stroking his fake beard.

"I don't like making mistakes," Ying Bing replied, her fingers pausing for a moment before continuing.

"Alright, alright," Li said with a chuckle.

As long as Bing didn't enter the kitchen, he was happy to let her count the money as many times as she wanted.

Li turned his attention to the customers, his eyes scanning the room. With his Tian Ming Shen Yan, he began to record information about the patrons.

For instance, he noted down the details of a slender woman enjoying the hot pot: 

Name: Luo Fei Yan
Age: 27
Physique: Crane-winged arms, Spiritual-cat feet
Cultivation: Inner Qi condensation realm
Tian Ming: Green with a hint of black
Evaluation: Exceptional in light-footed skills, a famous female thief known for stealing important items and returning them stealthily. She stole Fei Sha Dao He Bin's secret script and is now being pursued.

Li looked up and spotted a young girl, dressed in men's clothing, behaving boisterously.

"This young lady must have read too many novels," Li thought to himself.

She was disguising herself as a man, and even drew attention by snapping several martial artists' weapons at the entrance.

As she slammed her hand on the table, she shouted, "Waiter, bring me the strongest wine! I'm known for being able to drink a thousand cups without getting drunk!"

Li noticed that she was deliberately deepening her voice.

"Coming right up," he replied, subtly diluting the wine.

The girl's face turned red as she drank.

Li couldn't help but think that she was overestimating her drinking capacity.

When the girl offered him a small golden fish as a tip, Li sighed inwardly. Perhaps, to the young, the life of a martial artist was about galloping on horseback with a sword, scattering gold, and taking revenge.

He used his Wu Xiang Liu Li Sha to make himself appear older.

At the counter, the sound of the abacus stopped as the proprietress looked up at Luo Fei Yan.

"Your hot pot recipe... are you willing to share it?" Luo Fei Yan asked, her eyes narrowing as she picked up a thin slice of lamb.

Li smiled and declined, "We have no plans to open a branch or sell the recipe."

Luo Fei Yan teased, "Your chef's knife skills are impressive."

Li chuckled, "He has practiced for a few years."

As the night fell, the bustling hot pot restaurant finally closed its doors.

"I've gathered some information," Li said, looking at the notes in his hand. "Two strong individuals, Fei Sha Dao He Bin and Ye Gui Liu Heng, are at the Inner Qi jade liquid realm and Inner Qi玄丹realm, respectively. There are also some lesser individuals, mostly at the condensation realm, but they are still formidable due to their dark past."

Xiao Qin and Zuo Qiu Yang exchanged a glance. They hadn't realized that so many participants of the Wu Jian trial were among the customers.

Li continued, "We need to be swift and decisive in our actions. The sooner the battle ends, the better."

He assigned the task of dealing with the lesser individuals to Xiao Qin and Zuo Qiu Yang.

Xiao Qin felt a mix of emotions. Was this a compliment?

As they prepared to leave, Li asked Ying Bing if she wanted to stay in the shop or join him.

Ying Bing was perplexed by Li's words, "What do you mean by 'going out to do justice'?"

Li explained, "Who says heroes must stand in the light? I'm going to tell you a story about a hero from Gotham City..."

Ten minutes later, another figure left the hot pot restaurant.

As Li disappeared into the night, Ying Bing remained silent for a few seconds.

The story Li told was naive, but she felt a spark of excitement.

"Someone will take advantage of the Wu Jian trial to target Jiang Chu Long," she said to herself. "I still haven't investigated this matter."

With that, she slipped away into the night, her figure vanishing into the darkness.
