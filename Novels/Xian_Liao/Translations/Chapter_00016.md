# Chapter 16: Winds of Change  

"What exactly is a 'Literary Courage'?" Zhou Qing pondered as he leaned against the large mulberry tree.  

The summer heat dared not intrude upon the cool shade of the tree. Zhou Qing had long suspected that the previous hauntings in this abandoned house might have been connected to this exceptionally cool mulberry tree.  

Yet, since he moved in, his days had only grown better. Even if the tree had been involved in the past disturbances, it had never caused him any harm. Besides, he used it daily as a target for his practice, and the tree had never reacted.  

Leaning against the tree, feeling the coolness emanating from its sturdy trunk, Zhou Qing's mind grew even calmer.  

The key to the emergence of his Literary Courage lay in the *Admonitions to My Son* he had written.  

Could a single piece of calligraphy possess such power?  

Zhou Qing spread the parchment across his knees. The ink had dried quickly—whether due to the weather or something more mysterious, he couldn't say.  

When he wrote *Admonitions to My Son*, his emotions had been rich and full. The entire piece revolved around the concept of "tranquility," reflecting his experiences since transmigrating to this world. It was through this tranquility that he had found stability.  

*Tranquility cultivates virtue... Without serenity, one cannot reach far; without indifference, one cannot clarify ambition...*  

A work that endures through the ages resonates because of its sincerity, its genuine emotions, and its ability to articulate personal struggles and unyielding perseverance...  

The emergence of Literary Courage likely stemmed from how *Admonitions to My Son* embodied his philosophy of "tranquility cultivating virtue" and "serenity leading to far-reaching vision."  

He examined the characters on the parchment. His calligraphy was decent but not masterful. Yet, as he gazed at it, he felt something extraordinary.  

Reading each word brought an inexplicable calm to his mind, as if the text itself carried an aura of serenity.  

The concept of Literary Courage had many interpretations. Zhou Qing recalled his university mentor mentioning that it referred to the soul and essence of a written work—not just in literature, but in all artistic endeavors.  

"Soul? Essence?"  

*Reading nurtures the spirit; martial arts nurture the body.*  

"Until now, *The Art of Nourishing Life* has only reflected my progress in martial training. The appearance of Literary Courage must be related to the spiritual nourishment from reading."  

Zhou Qing had reached a rough conclusion.  

Though Literary Courage had enhanced his Tiger Form, this was only possible because the form had already reached the peak of the "Proficient" stage, just shy of "Mastery." The boost from Literary Courage was like the final stroke that brought the Tiger Form to life, breaking through its bottleneck.  

"Perhaps this is the true function of Literary Courage."  

The ferocity of the Tiger Form transformed into courage, undoubtedly aided by Literary Courage.  

---  

A martial artist must possess courage to advance boldly.  

Timidity leads nowhere.  

Yet, unchecked aggression invites trouble. As the *Dao De Jing* says, *"The violent and fierce do not die a natural death."*  

Excessive rigidity leads to breaking.  

Thus, most martial artists adhere to the principle of neither provoking nor fearing conflict.  

After all, no matter how skilled, the human body is still flesh and blood—how many blades can it endure?  

The physical body has its limits.  

But...  

Zhou Qing thought of *The Art of Nourishing Life*.  

Did his body truly have limits, given its influence?  

At his current level, he was far from needing to consider such limits.  

He hoped his physical growth would never plateau.  

With these thoughts settled, Zhou Qing felt a profound sense of relief. Today was good, tomorrow would be better, and each day would surpass the last.  

Even without electricity or the internet, a life filled with such hope was deeply satisfying.  

Wasn’t the essence of life the pursuit of happiness?  

For now, he wasn’t hungry.  

Nor was he inclined to write another piece of calligraphy. Parchment wasn’t cheap, and without inspiration, he saw no point in wasting it. He knew that even if he rewrote *Admonitions to My Son* identically, it wouldn’t carry the same profound resonance as the original.  

Even the greatest calligraphers couldn’t perfectly replicate their own masterpieces—works like *Letter on the Clearing After Snowfall*, *Letter of Lamentation*, or *Manuscript of Mourning for My Nephew*...  

Zhou Qing rubbed his flat but much firmer stomach. Since he wasn’t hungry, he skipped preparing another meal. Eating, after all, also consumed energy.  

He suddenly wished for something.  

*Tomorrow, could Morning Sun bring back another green snake?*  

For today, he decided to rest well.  

Adequate sleep was essential for nurturing the body.  

---  

The next morning, Zhou Qing awoke.  

The days were long now, and the sky was still pale, the night not yet fully faded.  

Morning Sun was in the courtyard, but instead of a snake, it held a large earthworm in its beak. There were no signs of digging in the courtyard, so it had likely found the worm nearby during the night.  

It seemed that snake had been a rare catch.  

Zhou Qing still wasn’t very hungry.  

Despite his daily exertions, his appetite remained subdued. He suspected the snake meat and gallbladder contained some mysterious substance that greatly replenished his body’s nutrients and energy.  

What could it be?  

Spiritual energy?  

Without the means to confirm, Zhou Qing set the question aside for later.  

He approached the wooden training dummy. The iron-reinforced sections corresponded to vital points on the human body. Originally designed for training fists, feet, and movement, its origins traced back to Qi Jiguang.  

In essence, the wooden dummy was born for battlefield combat.  

Though useful, its static nature limited its practicality.  

Still, for Zhou Qing’s current situation, it served its purpose.  

Something was better than nothing.  

He began with the Five Animals Exercises to warm up, starting with the Tiger Form.  

At the "Mastery" stage, the Tiger Form had undergone a qualitative transformation.  

The eight stances now flowed effortlessly, and even the previously awkward movements felt smoother. His flexibility had improved significantly.  

In a trance-like state, he fully immersed himself in the perspective of a tiger.  

He wasn’t mimicking—he *was* the tiger.  

The mountain’s tiger king.  

A mountain spirit in human form.  

The sensation was surreal. A primal ferocity surged within him, yet it lacked savagery. Instead, it bolstered his courage—a tiger’s courage.  

In his mind’s eye, the courtyard became his domain, the mulberry tree his canopy, and Morning Sun his vanguard.  

An aura of dominance naturally arose.  

Everything within his territory belonged to him. Without his permission, none could take it.  

Finishing the eight stances, Zhou Qing lingered in the sensation, reluctant to let it go.  

"Is this the 'Mastery' of the Tiger Form?"  

He felt it was, yet not entirely.  

"Literary Courage deepened my immersion in the Tiger Form."  

He quickly identified one reason for the experience.  

Would the Deer Form yield similar results?  

After a while, disappointment set in. The Deer Form, still at the "Proficient" stage, failed to replicate the earlier state.  

The contrast frustrated him, but he didn’t abandon his training. He completed the remaining three forms, finishing his warm-up before practicing with the wooden dummy.  

Then he checked *The Art of Nourishing Life*:  

**Five Animals Exercises (Adept):**  
- Tiger Form (Mastery)  
- Deer Form (Proficient)  
- Bear Form (Adept)  
- Bird Form (Adept)  
- Monkey Form (Adept)  

**Martial Techniques:**  
- Black Tiger Steals the Heart (Proficient)  
- Finger Flick神通 (Adept)  

**Literary Courage (Initial Stage).**  

Overnight, Finger Flick神通 had advanced from "Novice" to "Adept."  

"Yesterday evening, when Literary Courage appeared, Finger Flick神通 didn’t improve."  

Its breakthrough wasn’t due to Literary Courage but something else.  

"After a full night’s rest, my body adapted. The Five Animals Exercises warmed me up, and my physical capabilities improved, naturally elevating Finger Flick神通 to 'Adept.'"  

Picking up a pebble, Zhou Qing returned to his usual practice spot and aimed at the mulberry tree’s trunk.  

The pebble struck his intended mark effortlessly, leaving a slightly deeper impression than before.  

"The improvement isn’t just in Finger Flick神通—my hand-eye coordination has sharpened. And with the Tiger Form at Mastery, my finger strength and dexterity have also increased."  

No matter how formidable a technique, mastering it requires corresponding physical conditioning. Otherwise, it remains out of reach or backfires.  

In novels, this was like Zhang Wuji mastering the *Nine Yang Manual* before effortlessly learning the *Qiankun Great Shift*. With a solid foundation, all techniques become accessible.  

"Improving the Five Animals Exercises is like cultivating internal energy—it’s the core. Martial techniques are secondary. Don’t confuse the root with the branches."  

Zhou Qing used the wooden dummy to compensate for his lack of combat experience.  

Enhancing Black Tiger Steals the Heart was secondary.  

The real goal was applying it effectively in battle!  

Adopting a stance, Zhou Qing treated the dummy as an opponent and executed Black Tiger Steals the Heart.  

His strikes against the iron-reinforced arms provided clear feedback. He adjusted his stance, footwork, and force application repeatedly.  

Through this, his footwork agility and pain tolerance improved.  

A key aspect of combat was maintaining technique under sudden counterattacks.  

If techniques became instinctive, even unexpected strikes would retain power. Panic wouldn’t reduce a fight to wild flailing.  

Practicing against the dummy, Zhou Qing grew more adept with Black Tiger Steals the Heart.  

Finally, he exhaled deeply, concluding with a full Tiger Form routine to circulate warmth through his body and dispel fatigue.  

He then strapped on sandbags, shouldered his book basket, and set off for class.  

These were ordinary sandbags. Later, he could add iron pellets for weight, though at greater cost.  

Step by step, he’d progress.  

Using the Deer Form’s movement techniques with the sandbags, he felt his muscles fatigue rapidly.  

By the time he reached the small lake near Hu Village, he was panting heavily.  

His leg muscles burned with micro-tears.  

A round of Tiger Form circulated warmth through his legs, dispelling fatigue and healing the minor strains, slightly strengthening them.  

This sensation of continuous growth seemed boundless.  

Keeping the sandbags on, Zhou Qing continued to the village school, though he was running late.  

The students were still delighted to see him. Zhou Qing, however, noticed several were missing.  

Upon inquiry, he learned that the summer tax collection was urgent. Non-Hu Village students had returned home to help. Their families had to pay labor taxes, and even children under twelve were levied. Adults took on grueling jobs at docks or as laborers to earn money...  

Hu Village, being tight-knit, faced less aggressive tax collection.  

Recently, Zhou Qing’s performance before the Education Intendant had elevated Hu Village’s scholarly reputation, making it part of the magistrate’s achievements.  

This year, the county office reduced Hu Village’s summer taxes. Compared to neighboring villages, Hu Village was faring well.  

Tax collectors touted Hu Village’s example, sparking resentment elsewhere.  

Other villages blamed Hu Village for their increased burdens.  

Tensions flared over land and water disputes, with Hu Village often prevailing in clashes.  

Authorities and local gentry didn’t mediate, even seeming to fan the flames.  

Hu Village’s elders had foreseen this. Their school and Black Tiger Fist training had prepared the villagers.  

Though the school had admitted outsiders, they were few and paid fees, indirectly weakening neighboring villages.  

Many former students had moved to the city, finding work with their literacy and basic martial skills.  

Over the next days, attendance dwindled further.  

Zhou Qing observed that Hu Village was instigating conflicts to expand its territory.  

Students, literate and trained, became tools in this expansion.  

In a few years, Hu Village might dominate the western countryside, becoming a local power.  

This was preparation for turbulent times.  

Officials and gentry either didn’t notice or couldn’t stop it without risking unrest.  

Survival in the countryside followed the law of the jungle.  

Ten days later, the school was nearly empty.  

Zhou Qing resigned. The village elders, anticipating this, gave him extra payment, along with cured meats and mountain goods for the Dragon Boat Festival, filling his basket.  

Clearly, Hu Village’s expansion had enriched it.  

Yet, compared to Jiangzhou City, Hu Village remained insignificant.  

They never intended to keep Zhou Qing, only to foster goodwill for future connections.  

As Zhou Qing left Hu Village, his basket heavy, dust swirled in the wind.  

Shielding his face, he knew the world would only grow more chaotic.  

Countless places like Hu Village were stirring.  

The signs of turmoil were emerging.  

A sense of crisis prickled his mind, but he silently recited:  

*"As heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-improvement."*  

His heart steadied.  

Self-improvement was the surest path to security.
