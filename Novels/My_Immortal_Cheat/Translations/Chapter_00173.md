# Chapter 173: Black Mist

"Come on, come at me! Grandpa's standing still, let's see you try!"

Zhou Tian gazed at the blood-colored plant before him. Just now, he had used his [Attack Absorption] skill, so the blood-colored plant's attacks had no effect. [Attack Storage] was not a passive skill but an active one; it would absorb subsequent attacks only when Zhou Tian activated it, so he had been helpless when ambushed moments ago.

The blood-colored plant had no sentience, only a desire to plunder. Its branches continuously whipped Zhou Tian's body. Counting the recent attack, Zhou Tian had already died 33 times, allowing him to absorb 33 attacks.

However, he didn't act brazen for too long. Seeing that the nearby blood-colored small grasses were rapidly growing, and many had already mutated into branches, he quickly fled the area.

He used [Teleport] to flash past. The transformation of these blood-colored grasses was merely the slightest. The already lush ancient trees were even more terrifying; all the ancient trees danced wildly in the blood rain. Human faces materialized on their ancient trunks, truly resembling malevolent spirits possessing them. All the branches were like ghostly hands, and Zhou Tian dared not approach them. He could currently only absorb 33 attacks, and the branches on those large trees were far more than 33. Moreover, he had already wasted quite a few uses on those small grasses.

Boom!

A loud explosion came from the sky. Astonishingly, a blood-colored giant tree was wildly sprinting across the ground.

"My goodness!"

Zhou Tian was dumbfounded. The giant tree was a hundred zhang tall, seemingly composed of many trees combined together. Its thick branches whipped through the air, producing explosive sounds.

Swish!

Silver light flared, and a sword qi streaked across the sky, severing many branches. Only then did Zhou Tian realize that the giant tree was actually chasing a humanoid creature.

The creature had golden wings on its back, fiery red hair, and silver eyes. Wielding a long sword, it should have been spirited and majestic, but at this moment, it was extremely disheveled. Its face was grim. The long sword in its hand continuously swung, sending streaks of sword qi across the sky. Although the blood-colored branches of the giant tree in front of it were constantly being cut off, they ceaselessly regrew. The blood rain continued to fall from the sky, serving as the tree's best nourishment, providing an endless supply.

"Friend over there, help me get rid of this strange creature! I will heavily reward you afterwards!"

The creature shouted loudly at Zhou Tian. For some unknown reason, the giant tree only focused on chasing it, as if it hadn't seen Zhou Tian at all. How could Zhou Tian, a mere mortal, compare in blood qi to a creature that was at least Emperor-level? The giant tree, attracted by the dense blood qi, naturally ignored Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian pondered for two seconds, then said, "Alright, I'm coming to help you now!" Then he turned and walked away. *I'd believe a ghost before I believe you, you rotten old scoundrel, you're wicked! Better a dead fellow Daoist than a dead me! Farewell!*

The creature was so enraged it almost vomited blood. Losing focus, it was struck by a branch and indeed coughed up a mouthful of blood. Its golden wings glowed, and sword light rained down. It quickly retreated, but by the time it turned around again, Zhou Tian had already vanished. It could only grit its teeth in frustration.

As time passed, all creatures in this world became brutal and bloodthirsty under the nourishment of the blood rain, and they continuously grew stronger. Although the giant lotus seemed close, it was a case of 'looking at a mountain and thinking it's close, but you'll run your horse to death reaching it.' Zhou Tian walked for half a day but felt no sense of the distance shortening. Although Zhou Tian possessed the Teleport skill, he was inevitably touched by the pervasive dangers, and the uses of his [Attack Storage] skill were continuously decreasing.

Finally, halfway up a mountain peak, Zhou Tian found a seemingly safe place. There were no blood-stained creatures here, only bare rocks, and black mist permeated the area. This was a land of silence, with sparse vegetation. In front, black mist churned, creating an extremely oppressive atmosphere.

Zhou Tian hesitated, lingering at the edge of this area, not daring to advance. The place was strange; many blood-colored creatures were at the perimeter, baring their fangs at him, but none dared to cross the line. When things are abnormal, there must be a reason. Although this place seemed safe, it was definitely not simple!

"Friend, so you were here!"

A cold shout rang out. Sword light, like rain, descended like a hanging galaxy, immensely sharp. All nearby blood-colored creatures were pulverized, turning into streaks of blood plasma that seeped into the ground.

A streak of light descended from the sky. It was the winged creature from before. At this moment, it was incredibly disheveled; of its pair of wings, only the left one remained, the right one having been torn off. Its silver eyes were chilling, and its red hair was disheveled like a savage. It stared intently at Zhou Tian, its long sword glowing, seemingly ready to strike. It had paid a heavy price to escape that giant tree. It also knew that no one would have helped it back then, but it had suppressed rage in its heart and wanted to vent. It hadn't expected to encounter Zhou Tian here, perfect for killing to vent its anger!

"What a coincidence."

Zhou Tian chuckled. Without further hesitation, he directly teleported into the black mist-shrouded area. His resurrection chances for the day were already used up, and the [Cultivation Replication] skill could no longer be used. He no longer had the qualifications to contend.

The creature's expression changed. It raised its sword and cleaved down. A silver light flashed, and sword qi surged, cleaving into the gray mist. However, the black mist was like a ferocious beast, opening its gaping maw and swallowing all the sword qi without even a ripple.

Moreover, as if the sword qi was a trigger, the gray mist suddenly contracted. At first, it was silent, then a terrifying pulsation emerged, causing suffocation. Then, with a thud, like a heavenly drum beating, the creature's qi and blood surged, its ears roared, its vision darkened, and it spat out another mouthful of blood. Its entire body trembled; it wanted to leave but couldn't move.

Following this, a 'thump-thump' sound slowly began, very slow but rhythmic, gradually sounding one after another.

It sounded like... a heartbeat!

However, its vibrations were too terrifying. The creature began to cough up large mouthfuls of blood, its face pale, as if its body was about to explode. Within the black mist, the terrifying 'thump-thump' sound grew increasingly muffled and powerful, as if someone was awakening from an ancient slumber, gradually gaining vitality.

Yet, this was also extremely terrifying. At a speed visible to the naked eye, black cracks appeared one after another outside the gray mist; the void was collapsing!

The golden-winged creature's face was pale, and it could barely stand, relying entirely on the long sword in its hand for support. It cursed inwardly, 'How did I end up in this godforsaken place? First, trees that run, and now this bizarre black mist!'

Within the mist, heavy breathing sounds emerged, like a strong wind howling, threatening to sweep across the Nine Heavens.

Finally, a pair of glowing green eyes opened within the black mist. The gray mist dissipated, seemingly merging into his body, and his true form appeared. It was a bald man, his face ancient like withered wood, clad in a purple-gold kasaya, seemingly a Buddhist monk. However, his fingers were very strange, twisted and withered, unlike human hands.

Beside him, a figure stood: Zhou Tian. His expression was peculiar; he had no idea how an old man had just popped out of this gray mist.
