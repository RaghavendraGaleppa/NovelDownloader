# Chapter 12: Outer Sect Martial Arts Hall

The Martial Arts Hall.

Today's martial arts instruction session had already concluded. On the bluestone-paved ground, outer sect disciples practiced their techniques, sweating profusely. Among them was Wang Hu.

The performance on the Heaven-Ascending Stone Steps wasn't judged by the highest level one reached, but by the level one ultimately stood upon. He had endured intense pain to struggle upwards, but ultimately was only assigned to the outer sect. And that was all thanks to one person!

"He must have used some trick to deceive the Heaven-Ascending Stone Steps!"
"Someday, I'll expose his true nature."

Bang—bang—

He punched the sandbag with loud thuds, as if it were the person he gnashed his teeth at. This was the only way he could vent his anger. After all, Li Mo was already a true disciple. Even his cousin, Wang Hao, couldn't lay a hand on him.

"Junior Brother Wang, your cousin has cultivated the Six Harmonies Fist to quite a degree," a blue-robed outer sect deacon raised an eyebrow. "His meridians are open; I no longer need to instruct him."

"Xiao Hu has had some talent for fist arts since childhood, just casually practiced a few moves with my uncle," Wang Hao smiled, but a hint of coldness flashed across his lips. "Like Xiao Qin, he should have been an inner sect disciple."

The deacon shook his head, looking at a young man in the crowd. The young man had an ordinary appearance, wore short clothes, and his eyes were full of determination. He was meticulously practicing his cultivation, completely drenched in sweat.

"Senior Brother, you're mistaken. Hu Zi's talent is not something that waste can compare to," Wang Hao said, a hint of mockery in his eyes. "He once entered the inner sect with me in the same batch, but he only got weaker with practice. His qi and blood must be almost as depleted as someone who just opened their meridians, right?"

As the two were speaking, a figure suddenly appeared in the sunlight streaming through the main entrance. The young man wore cloud-patterned robes, his smile sunny and amiable.

"Hmm?" Wang Hao raised an eyebrow. "Li Mo?"

Wang Hu saw the familiar face and punched a hole through the sandbag. The martial artists practicing all stopped their movements, their expressions puzzled. Isn't he a true disciple? Why has he come to the outer sect's Martial Arts Hall?

"Junior Brother Li, I am He Hongfeng. What brings you here...?" The blue-robed outer sect deacon rose, his manners impeccable.

Li Mo lightly coughed and said, "Senior Brother He, my apologies. I've come to learn some basic fist and foot techniques."

He Hongfeng: "?"

A true disciple, coming to the outer sect's Martial Arts Hall to learn basic martial arts? You must be joking.

"Do the elders... know about this?"

"Uh, my master went to sleep, and it was Elder Xue who sent me." Li Mo nodded.

"Master... Elder Shang Wu?" As soon as He Hongfeng thought of that beautiful elder in fiery red palace attire, he immediately understood. It made sense then.

The expressions of everyone in the Martial Arts Hall varied; some gloated, some pitied, and some were unconvinced. A dignified true disciple, reduced to coming to the outer sect to learn martial arts. This showed that he wasn't particularly valued... That's right. The elders all had their own true disciples, and recently Ying Bing was gaining immense popularity, with many already saying she would be the next sect master of Qingyuan Sect. Naturally, the elders would all revolve around her. Li Mo, moreover, was stuck with a master whom everyone loathed. It wasn't hard to understand why he was being neglected.

Among the crowd, the young man named Xiao Qin, currently wiping sweat, couldn't help but sigh. Wasn't his own situation similar?

"Can true disciples not come to the outer sect's Martial Arts Hall?" Li Mo asked.

"The rules don't say it's forbidden, but today's basic fist and foot techniques have already been taught. If you still wish to learn, you'll have to ask the inner sect senior brother who teaches fist and foot techniques." He Hongfeng was responsible for guiding outer sect disciples in opening meridians and condensing qi and blood.

"The inner sect senior brother who teaches fist and foot techniques..." Li Mo followed his gaze and saw Wang Hao, who was sipping tea.

Wang Hao didn't even lift his head, his tone not very friendly: "The Martial Arts Hall has its rules. I only guide outer sect disciples for one *shichen* a day. Since you're late, no one can be an exception." As he spoke, he raised his head and feigned belated surprise: "Junior Brother Li? Aren't you a true disciple? If you insist on breaking the rules, then I'll have no choice but to give you a private lesson."

These words were quite malicious. If he were to say he wanted to learn now, it would mean breaking the rules and making an exception. Originally, people might not have minded teaching it again, but with these words, it would feel unfair.

"Cousin, being a true disciple is so impressive!" Wang Hu chimed in, playing the role of the sarcastic stooge. "Even if you come to the outer sect, you still have to follow the rules!" Although he hadn't formally taken a master yet, he was almost certainly a disciple of Deacon Futu. In terms of status, he wasn't afraid of Li Mo, this unwelcome true disciple.

He Hongfeng also fell silent. He oversaw the Martial Arts Hall, and as long as there was no trouble, he had no intention of interfering in others' conflicts.

"Alright, alright, are you two performing a cross-talk routine here?" Li Mo raised a hand to silence them, then said to He Hongfeng: "I'll just watch others practice from the side. That's not breaking any rules, is it?"

"That is naturally acceptable."

"Good." Li Mo nodded and walked into the Martial Arts Hall, looking around. "He seems to be practicing well?" His gaze fixed, Li Mo walked towards Xiao Qin in the corner.

"Tsk... these two are teaming up." Wang Hao glanced at him sideways, the corner of his mouth curling up. Wang Hu almost burst out laughing. *You think you can learn just by watching others? Who do you think you are? And of all people to learn from, he chose the outer sect's infamous waste.*

"Senior Brother, would it be convenient for me to watch you practice here?" Li Mo first bowed.

"Xiao Qin, if you want to watch, then watch. I don't guarantee you'll learn anything," Xiao Qin said dully.

Li Mo smiled amiably: "Senior Brother Xiao, just practice as you usually do; there's no need to mind me."

Xiao Qin's eyes were complex. This young man, despite being a true disciple, didn't act superior. On the contrary, he treated an outer sect disciple like him with courtesy. Having received many cold stares, it was rare for him to feel respect from others. For a moment, a sense of shared hardship arose within him.

"Junior Brother, this is the Six Harmonies Fist. I'll start from the beginning; pay close attention." After speaking, Xiao Qin deliberately slowed his movements.
