## Chapter 157: Self-Detonation

Blood flowed through the void, almost forming a small river. The void could not bear its weight; this was all Zhou Tian’s blood, as the King of Gods' body was composed of some substance, with no concept of flesh and blood.

“Damn it, it seems there’s only one way!”

Zhou Tian’s body was covered in wounds. Many of the injuries still had traces of the King of Gods’ unique energy, making them difficult to heal.

The King of Gods was not faring much better. His body had dissipated considerably compared to when they first started. Although he had summoned the Demon Lord’s Armor through special means, significantly increasing his strength, he had not reached the Heavenly Venerate realm and thus could not achieve a crushing victory. Furthermore, he had not expected Zhou Tian to adopt a tactic of trading blows. After all, he was merely a remnant soul, while Zhou Tian was a living person; trading lives with him was simply not worth it.

Currently, he was enveloped in black mist, his expression unclear.

Suddenly, Zhou Tian moved. Thunder, flames, and sword energy surged. His Dharma Body gradually shrank, finally returning to the size of a normal person. The King of Gods did the same. Zhou Tian treated the ancient ruler in his hand entirely as a sword, raising it high. His body transformed into a streak of light, seemingly brewing a peerless strike.

The King of Gods' ancient black armor bore incomplete runes that writhed, and the golden ancient spear gleamed brightly, its tip shimmering with cold radiance, also prepared for a peerless strike.

“Circle as a Prison!”
“Darkness Barrier!”

The moment the two made contact, Zhou Tian threw out the ancient ruler in his hand. The ancient ruler floated in the void, drawing a circle around Zhou Tian and the King of Gods. Runes emerged, forming a barrier. This was a supreme divine ability from the Grand Luo Academy, capable of sealing everything.

At the same time, the King of Gods’ dark armor detached from his body, encircling them. Dense dark essence surged out, forming a darkness barrier.

Within the double seal, both Zhou Tian and the King of Gods fell silent for a moment. The atmosphere was a bit awkward; clearly, both had the same idea.

“What a coincidence,” Zhou Tian chuckled, his internal energy rapidly rising.

The King of Gods also revealed a slightly helpless smile. “Indeed. That’s why one shouldn’t jump to conclusions until the very last moment.” His body also began to glow.

“Then, old man, guess what? Is this the last moment?” Zhou Tian’s eyes sparkled. He was almost unable to suppress the primordial power within him.

“It should be,” the King of Gods looked at the young man before him. Many of today’s unexpected twists had been brought about by this youth. He could clearly perceive that Zhou Tian’s bone age was not yet twenty. What an astonishing young man. His gaze seemed distant; at this moment, he thought of the young man who once drew a bow to shoot a Heavenly Dragon, a youth who had also amazed him. Unfortunately...

“If you say so, then it is,” Zhou Tian showed a mysterious smile. Then, golden cracks appeared on his face, as if an unimaginable power was about to erupt from within him.

Boom!

An earth-shattering sound reverberated. The entire void groaned under the unbearable pressure, and space shattered, yet not a single spatial storm surged forth, as all of it was crushed by the immense energy. Zhou Tian and the King of Gods had actually chosen to self-detonate simultaneously.

“Tian’er!”
“Zhou Tian!”

Zhou Changsheng’s eyes widened, bloodshot, as he roared to the sky. His qi and blood surged like collapsing clouds, but black threads entangled him, his mental state clearly damaged. Two tear streaks ran down Tian Ling’s crystalline eyes, her nails digging deep into her flesh, drops of blood trickling down her fingers and palms.

In contrast, the Holy God and his companions showed no significant emotional fluctuation, perhaps because the King of Gods had truly died in ancient times, or perhaps for other reasons.

The boundless energy continued to surge. The spatial barrier in this area had been shattered countless times during Zhou Tian and the King of Gods’ battle. Now, with such terrifying energy continuously impacting it, the spatial barrier had become incredibly thin, like a window covered with paper. It was likely that no life could survive here for many years.

From the explosion, four streaks of light flew out, instantly attracting the attention of both sides. Zhou Changsheng’s eyes were crimson, his muscles bulging. Although he was heartbroken, he had long held a high position and knew that now was not the time for sorrow. His body transformed into a streak of light, heading towards the four objects. The others followed closely. When they got near, Yan Mo extended his palm, and one of the streaks of light instantly fell into his hand—it was precisely the ancient ruler Zhou Tian had used. Another streak of light fell into the Holy God’s hand, which was the incomplete golden ancient spear. The other two items were the King of Gods’ Divine Hall and the Demon Lord’s Armor, quietly suspended in the void. They did not possess artifact spirits, so they did not automatically return to their respective masters like the ancient ruler and ancient spear. Although these Heavenly Venerate artifacts were damaged, the materials used to craft them were genuine Heavenly Venerate-grade materials, incredibly sturdy, far from being damaged by the self-detonation of two Half-step Supremes.

Without further ado, a great battle erupted here. Zhou Changsheng was already seething with anger. His body was like a rock, and he clenched his fists, punching towards the Holy God. The Holy God and his companions did not wish to stay in this place for long. Zhou Tian’s appearance had caused too many unforeseen changes, and they feared that other unexpected events might occur.

Four lower-ranking deities stepped forward and directly detonated their bodies. Boundless energy surged forth; after all, they were just temporary vessels. The Holy God and Thunder respectively lunged towards the Divine Hall and the Demon Lord’s Armor, while the God of Death concealed himself in the void.

“Stay here!”

From the explosion, a figure charged out, a half-section of a small pagoda hovering above his head, wielding large fists like a man-eating fierce dragon—it was Zhou Changsheng. Since Xuan Zhenzi’s small pagoda was not a one-time burst Heavenly Venerate artifact but rather focused on protection, he could still barely use it. The God of Death’s scythe sliced through the void, and residual souls howled within the black mist around his body. Countless vengeful spirits clung to the scythe, attempting to devour Zhou Changsheng.

“Clang!”

The scythe struck the golden glazed light hanging from the ancient pagoda and was immediately bounced away. All the vengeful spirits and residual souls melted away like spring snow under the warm sun. Even the black mist around the God of Death’s body cleared, revealing a strange humanoid creature with no facial features, only a black vortex. Just a glance caused a dizzying sensation. It was exposed for a moment before being re-enveloped by the black mist.

“Thunder, help me!”

A hoarse voice came from beneath the black mist. The Thunder Lord looked at the Demon Lord’s Armor, which was within reach. Yan Mo, holding the ancient ruler, was blocking him. Gritting his teeth, he turned and gathered ten thousand bolts of lightning, directing them towards Zhou Changsheng. Seeing the Thunder Lord depart, Yan Mo breathed a sigh of relief. He had no fighting strength left at this moment. Unless he sacrificed himself to forcefully unleash a strike with the ancient ruler, he certainly would not have been able to stop the Thunder Lord.
