Chapter 505: Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Peach Tree

Three藏 wore a simple monk's robe, not a speck of dust on it. At this moment, his brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. A glimmer of understanding flashed through his clear eyes, only to be replaced by an even deeper sense of caution and vigilance.

He pressed his palms together, his gaze fixed on the Taoist temple, his tone grave. "This temple is called 'Zhenyuan Temple.' It is the secluded cultivation ground of a true lord of the Taoist path, a being of immense divine power and extremely high seniority."

"My original intention was not to disturb this place on my journey. I did not expect that an unseen force has guided us here."

"This venerable one's Taoist title is 'True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Clear Source, Responding Thunder, Manifesting Transformation, Wondrous Existence, and Universal Salvation.'"

"His cultivation is immeasurable, and he is the master of this place. You will all follow me into the temple. Be cautious in your speech and actions, and do not show the slightest bit of disrespect or rashness."

"This true lord's temper is unpredictable. If we offend him, the consequences are unpredictable."

After saying this with a calm expression, Three藏 couldn't help but curse inwardly. The people from the Yuan Demon Sect were truly despicable. He had thought they would be preaching and causing trouble in the Eastern Wasteland, but he never expected them to move an entire mountain gate over, placing it squarely on the path of the scripture pilgrimage. Moreover, looking at the immortal aura here, they must have been waiting for over a century.

Thinking of this, Three藏 felt a chill in his heart and thought of many things.

Three藏's words struck a chord with Xu Yunfan, and waves immediately rose in his heart.

*True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Clear Source, Responding Thunder, Manifesting Transformation, Wondrous Existence, and Universal Salvation.*

One of the nine true lords of the Primordial Origin Sect. This true lord had long been seated on his immortal mountain, indifferent to worldly affairs. He hadn't even opened his own Taoist lineage. If one didn't specifically investigate the nine mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect, they wouldn't even know such a true lord existed.

Furthermore, the momentary surprise and slight frown on Three藏's face clearly conveyed one message: arriving here and visiting this true lord was绝 not part of his original plan.

This had deviated from his expectations, or rather, from the expectations of the Bodhisattva's Pure Land.

Xu Yunfan's main consciousness instantly became active. Perhaps there was something to be gained here.

"They've finally come!"

The Bodhisattva's Pure Land was making a grand spectacle in the Eastern Wasteland, promoting the Walking Buddha's Path ritual to welcome the legendary throne of the Self-Ruler King Buddha.

With such a massive operation, how could the top powers of the Taihua Void Realm, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect, sit idly by?

In the vast and chaotic Eastern Wasteland, the efficiency of Three藏's party over the past ten years was unreasonably slow. There must be people constantly arranging, guiding, setting up obstacles, and even secretly manipulating the course of karma.

The sudden appearance of this "True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Clear Source, Responding Thunder, Manifesting Transformation, Wondrous Existence, and Universal Salvation"—Xu Yunfan was almost certain this was a direct intervention by the higher-ups of the Primordial Origin Sect or the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

He was waiting here specifically for Three藏's party. His purpose was nothing more than to test, obstruct, or... make a deal.

He absolutely could not let the Bodhisattva's Pure Land's Buddha Path ritual proceed so smoothly.

Xu Yunfan's expression immediately lit up with excitement.

Knowing the nature of the Primordial Origin Sect, those true lords would likely do things that harm others without benefiting themselves. Especially when facing the two great sects, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect or the Bodhisattva's Pure Land, they would be as excited as if they'd been injected with chicken blood.

At that moment, the vermilion gate of the Taoist temple creaked open.

Two young Taoist boys, dressed in blue, with hair tied in twin buns, red lips and white teeth, around thirteen or fourteen years old, walked out slowly. Their appearance was quite proper, and their clear eyes held a hint of scrutiny.

"The esteemed masters have had a long journey. The temple master is already aware and has specifically sent Qingfeng (Mingyue) to welcome you."

The two Taoist boys bowed in salute, their words and manners impeccable.

Wuneng and Wujing restrained their wild and unrestrained demeanor, speaking and acting with caution. A Golden Core true lord was someone they could not afford to offend.

Xu Yunfan directly activated his authority, taking over the clone, Sun Wukong. His eyelids drooped, hiding the flash of light in his eyes, perfectly concealing his main consciousness's divine sense beneath Sun Wukong's unruly and defiant exterior.

However, Three藏 seemed to sense a momentary change in Sun Wukong's aura and instinctively turned back.

He saw a look of eager anticipation in Sun Wukong's eyes.

"Master, is this true lord very powerful?"

Three藏 immediately understood and couldn't help but say sternly, "Do not be reckless."

Xu Yunfan naturally made Sun Wukong's clone appear somewhat unwilling but had to agree.

The group entered the temple with the Taoist boys.

Passing through the front courtyard, the view suddenly opened up.

The middle courtyard was not a common incense-filled main hall but was planted with a strange, towering ancient tree.

The tree's branches were gnarled and coiled, its trunk as robust as a dragon, its leaves lush and green, shaped like peach leaves.

What was most eye-catching were the clusters of fruits hanging between the branches and leaves.

Those fruits were crystal clear, as large as a fist, and on their surface swirled a dreamlike, flowing light.

Some were wreathed in a gentle breeze, some exuded a fiery aura, some condensed with black frost, some entwined with the sharpness of metal, and some diffused a thick, heavy earth element...

Each fruit emitted a different aura, but without exception, they were exceptionally pure and condensed, as if containing the origin of some heavenly creation.

*Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend!!!*

Xu Yunfan's eyes instantly shot out a brilliant light. He truly hadn't expected that Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend could be artificially created. He even saw several types of Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend qi required for the *Divine霄 Nine Courts Purple Heaven Indestructible Scripture* among them.

Seeing that Three藏's disciples' attention was attracted by the immortal peaches, the Taoist boys Qingfeng and Mingyue couldn't help but show a hint of proud pleasure on their faces.

Qingfeng pointed at the peach tree and said with a tone of pride, "Esteemed masters, please look. This is the spiritual root that our temple master spent countless efforts to cultivate, called the 'Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Peach Tree.' It is no ordinary object."

"Every immortal peach on this tree contains a pure strand of 'Heavenly Gang qi' or 'Earthly Fiend qi.' If one is fated to eat one, it would be equivalent to absorbing a strand of Heavenly Gang or Earthly Fiend essence that doesn't need to be refined. It has miraculous effects on increasing cultivation, tempering the physical body, and comprehending the heavenly Dao rules!"

"Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend Peach?!"

Xu Yunfan's heart pounded violently.

Even with the experience from his long-term cultivation of the Lin Mantra, which allowed him to remain calm before the collapse of Mount Tai, his mind was almost stirred into a tempest at this moment.

Damn, is there such a supreme treasure fruit tree in the world?

His gaze was like a torch as he instantly swept over the累累 fruits on the immortal peach tree.

*Fire Spirit Gang Fiend, Supreme Essence Gold Fiend, Weak Water Fiend, Profound Yin Earthly Fiend Qi...*

At least five of the peaches emitted auras that were highly compatible with several key auxiliary Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend qi recorded in the subsequent cultivation of the *Divine霄 Nine Courts Purple Heaven Indestructible Scripture*.

Especially when finally condensing the rank of the Indestructible Golden Body, if he could integrate these unique Gang and Fiend qi with the essence of Stellar Metal and Nine Heavens Thunderfire, the final Divine霄 Purple Heaven Indestructible Body he would achieve would have a foundation so deep and potential so terrifying that it would absolutely not be inferior to the legendary Purple Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend foundation of that Divine霄 Nine Courts True Lord. In some aspects, it might even surpass it.

"No matter what, I must get my hands on them!"

The main consciousness instantly made a decision.

The clone Sun Wukong was inherently a rebellious heart-monkey; it would be normal for him to do something audacious. Moreover, as a先天 living being with such roots and having cultivated the Battle-Buddha Sutra to接引 the Self-Ruler King Buddha, the Bodhisattva's Pure Land would definitely protect him at all costs.
