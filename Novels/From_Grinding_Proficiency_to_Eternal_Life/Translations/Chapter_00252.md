# Chapter 252: Marrow Cleansing

Especially for cultivators like Jingming, who practiced the art of salvation and possessed exceptionally handsome appearances, they were all masters of temptation, capable of subtly altering others' thoughts without a moment's notice.

Looking at Jingming, who was drooling and completely idiotic, Xu Yunfan casually lifted him. Seeing the foolish grin on Jingming's face, he couldn't help but chuckle. After stripping the opponent of his Golden Silk Soft Armor, he tossed him into the lava pool without a second thought.

He watched as the opponent's agonizing screams faded as he sank into the lava, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Xu Yunfan's palm tightened slightly. As the Dragon Scale Armor plates opened and closed, thousands of golden threads extended from the gaps, instantly piercing the Golden Silk Treasure Armor.

As Xu Yunfan's palm exerted and retracted its force, the golden threads emerging from the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly glowed with crimson patterns, wrapping around the Golden Silk Treasure Armor like blood-scented flood dragons.

This divine armor, woven with the secret techniques of the Mituo Temple, was instantly pierced by countless holes. Dense Sanskrit runes surfaced on its surface in an attempt to resist, but they shattered one after another under the erosion of the Dragon Scale Armor's golden threads.

As the golden threads penetrated the core of the treasure armor, the originally radiant armor visibly turned dull.

The Dragon Scale Armor plates emitted a muffled dragon's roar. Molten-like, dark golden liquid seeped from the gaps between the scales, flowing back into Xu Yunfan's body along the golden threads.

In an instant, the blood and energy in his body boiled violently. Behind him, the phenomenon of Golden Muscle Jade Bone, signifying the perfection of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body, appeared. Even the flow of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique became visible beneath his skin.

"Buddhist purification..."

Xu Yunfan squinted, sensing the feedback. This treasure armor was likely woven from extremely rare and precious Sky Silkworm Golden Threads by several high monks who had perfected the Awakening of Perception. Each weave was accompanied by the chanting of Buddhist scriptures, imbuing it with Buddhist spiritual power.

The surging vital essence struck the bottleneck of his small success in Blood Transformation. He immediately took another breath of Ginseng Qi and circulated the Pure Yang One Qi Technique. He allowed the Buddhist salvation power and the Ginseng Qi to flow through his flesh and blood, repeatedly refining them within his blood and energy.

When the Dragon Scale Armor devoured the last strand of golden thread, fine dragon tooth-like protrusions had condensed along the edges of its plates. The breath Xu Yunfan exhaled actually rose into the air as a smoke-like trail of blood energy.

[Your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique has increased significantly.]
[Your...]

Watching the attribute points on his vision almost flooding the screen, there were some for the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, but the vast majority was the massive increase in proficiency for the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique.

4891 points!

Pure Yang One Qi Technique: 3810 points!

Looking at the proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique in the skill栏 of his attribute panel, which had finally stopped, Xu Yunfan took a light breath.

He was only a little over a hundred points away from perfecting the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique.

Then, he would be able to penetrate his energy into his marrow!

Stepping into the Marrow Cleansing Realm.

If he were to speak of it in the martial world, others would call him a Grandmaster!

Besides the six great sects of the Great Zhou, he would now have the qualification to establish his own sect and become a regional hegemon.

Glancing at the Eight-Treasures Bodhi Beads on the ground, their Buddhist light now dim, Xu Yunfan tried to have the Dragon Scale Armor absorb them. When there was no reaction at all, he had no choice but to give up.

Taking the Eight-Treasures Bodhi Beads was something Xu Yunfan never even considered. Once he left, he would surely be quickly located by the high monks of the Mituo Temple.

By then, he might truly face the true wrath of the Immovable King of Wisdom descending upon him in a torrent.

The Mituo Temple produced a Buddha Son once every few centuries, and he had just killed one within the small world secret realm. If this were known, the old monsters of the entire Mituo Temple would probably come out in full force.

Moreover, the Mituo Temple was extremely mysterious. Jingming had practiced a Buddhist spiritual secret technique. If Xu Yunfan hadn't possessed the Lin Jue, he might have truly fallen for it. There was no telling if the Mituo Temple had some kind of method to trace karmic connections.

Having thought this through, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a sigh, his eyes filled with contemplation.

He needed to find a method to conceal his own aura.

After thinking it over, Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly. Perhaps there was another way.

He looked up at the sky. Now that night had fallen, the entire small world secret realm was shrouded in darkness.

Xu Yunfan also lost the desire to continue cultivating. After two consecutive major battles today, if it weren't for the Ginseng Qi from the Ginseng Kid replenishing him, he probably wouldn't have even been able to fully replenish his own blood and energy.

If true disciples from the Sword Pavilion and the Mituo Temple were inside, it meant that the true disciples of the Xuanzhen Sect were still trapped within this small world secret realm.

Xu Yunfan suddenly remembered the "Purple Celestial Muscles Chapter" recorded in the Xuanzhen Sect's body-refining secret manual, the "Green Mountain Ruler's Mountain Suppression Manual."

Although it was not as good as the Nine耀 Sect's Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Technique, which condenses nine solar bodies within the flesh and blood, allowing one's blood and energy to stack nine times, it was still quite decent.

After cultivating it, one's body would be like a Green Mountain Xuan Peak, with blood and energy as vast, heavy, and profound as a mountain.

He remembered that his master, Zhan Yan, had once mentioned that this technique required the Green Mountain Lotus Fire Mushroom unique to Green Mountain to be ground into a medicinal paste to assist entry into the body, supplemented by Xuanzhen Qi to refine the muscles and tissues throughout the body.

It was a bit troublesome, but it was still a good choice. After all, he had the attribute panel. As long as he could elevate a martial art to be displayed on the skill栏, then nothing was a problem.

"The earth fire is the hammer, the mountain is the anvil..."

Xu Yunfan murmured the incantation to himself. The energy emission paths of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique under his feet actually resonated with the mountain's terrain.

Three hours later, he leaped to a basalt platform protruding from a cliff. It was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and the spiritual energy of the earth's veins cascaded down like a waterfall.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer heavily struck the ground. Within a radius of ten zhang, the earth's veins trembled slightly, spraying out mist-like spiritual energy that flowed over the rock platform.

In the time that followed, besides his daily cultivation of the Lin Jue, Xu Yunfan began to devote himself entirely to the cultivation of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique.

If he didn't have the Ginseng Kid's assistance, it might have taken nearly half a year to achieve this bit of proficiency, but with the Ginseng Qi's support, it was different.

He cultivated tirelessly every day and could gain at least twenty points of proficiency.

If he cultivated to the point of being entranced and comprehended the changes in the hammer technique, he could even land a critical hit on his proficiency gain, increasing it by an extra four or five points.

Whenever the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique caused the earth's veins to tremble, the Dragon Scale Armor plates would seep out a molten-like, crimson golden light that would wrap around his arms' muscles along the hammer handle.

The Ginseng Qi was continuously drawn into his body through his nostrils, constantly flowing and surging between his muscles and blood and energy.

He trained without sleep or rest. By the late night of the ninth day, the muscles all over Xu Yunfan's body suddenly took on a jade-like luster. As the blood and energy beneath his skin surged, the faint silhouette of a continuous mountain range appeared.

Every hammer he swung, with its explosive energy, manifested nine layers of mountain shadows.

When the last bit of proficiency fluctuated, and the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique reached five thousand, the proficiency panel's notification messages instantly flooded the screen.

[Your Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique has reached perfection.]
[You have stepped into the Marrow Cleansing Realm.]
[...]

When the final hammer, carrying the nine layers of mountain shadows, crashed down with a rumble, a series of clanging sounds of metal and iron suddenly erupted within Xu Yunfan's body.

A great surge of warm energy appeared out of nowhere within his body, flowing frantically through his four limbs and all his bones.

The resonance between the Hundred Tempered Steel Body and the perfected hammer technique caused every inch of his bones to take on a cyan jade-like luster.

The originally white jade-like bone membranes began to proliferate rapidly. The energy began to erupt from his blood, seeping into the spaces between his bones, as if countless miniature mountains were rising from the depths of his marrow.
