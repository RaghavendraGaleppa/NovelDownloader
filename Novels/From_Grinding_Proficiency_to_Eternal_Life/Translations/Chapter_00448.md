# Chapter 448: The Origin of Divine Martial

"The Golden Core undergoes nine transformations, and each transformation creates a new heaven."

The voice of Hundred Peaks True Lord echoed within Xu Yunfan's consciousness, "Ordinary cultivators must gather the essence of the five elements, use their lifebound magic treasure as a foundation, and spend a hundred years to forge a rudimentary form, trying every way to cultivate a small heaven within their bodies. But you..."

The scene suddenly switched to the景象 of the Divine Martial World. Xu Yunfan was shocked to discover that the Xuanwu starlight he had summoned during his Foundation Establishment had actually left a permanent mark on the world's membrane!

"The Divine Martial World is itself a fragment of a heaven opened up by an ancient great power. By using the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra* as a bridge, you have long been connected to its destiny."

Hundred Peaks True Lord's gaze was profound as he said slowly, "If you can look outward instead of being confined to internal cultivation methods, and use the Divine Martial World as a base to refine it into your own heaven... as long as you find that trace of innate golden nature, you might be able to use this opportunity to ascend to the Golden Core realm in one go."

Xu Yunfan suddenly understood, and finally realized why so many people had paid attention to him after he released his Divine Martial Dao Foundation.

He felt a bit heavy-hearted. When he established his Dao under the gaze of the Three True Lords, even if the news didn't spread, those subordinates of the Bodhisattvas and the True Lords' direct disciples would certainly know everything clearly.

Xu Yunfan suddenly realized that it was no wonder the person behind Li Baichuan was so anxious. If they could seize his Divine Martial Dao Foundation, it would be equivalent to obtaining a half-finished heaven out of thin air!

After all, ordinary cultivators would need to spend a hundred years of hard work gathering the essence of the five elements to barely forge a rudimentary form of a heaven, but his Dao Foundation had already long been connected to the destiny of the Divine Martial World.

What made him realize even more was that when True Lord Divine Martial reincarnated, he was willing to entrust his true spirit to the Divine Martial World, probably because he also saw the special nature of this world as a fragment of an ancient heaven.

This world is itself a ready-made foundation for a heaven. If it could be completely refined, it would save more than just a few hundred years of hard cultivation!

Those direct disciples under the Bodhisattvas and True Lords must have seen through this point long ago. If he were to take over Cold Crow Pass, his days would definitely not be peaceful.

He looked up at Hundred Peaks True Lord, whose gaze was profound and carried a hint of a smiling expression.

Xu Yunfan naturally understood what this meant regarding whether he could truly be valued by Clear Source True Lord. If he could withstand immense pressure and firmly guard the post, then the rewards would certainly not disappoint him.

Having thought this through, Xu Yunfan's mind settled.

He had the Attribute Panel by his side. Whether it was cultivating spells and divine abilities or practicing Qi cultivation, his progress would be much faster than that of ordinary cultivators.

A Foundation Establishment True Lord is a complete mainstay in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. As long as he was careful and appropriate, there shouldn't be any major mishaps.

"Junior Brother, if you can..."

Hundred Peaks True Lord suddenly lowered his voice, "Clear Source True Lord deduced a century ago that the next 'Three Worlds Tide' will erupt within a sixty-year cycle."

Hundred Peaks True Lord pointed towards the three massive heavens still hanging in the sky and said solemnly, "When the heavens of the three sects tear and collide with each other, a massive amount of innate pure and turbid qi will be spewed out. This is a rare great opportunity. At that time, you must do your best to collect it."

He looked at Xu Yunfan with burning eyes, "The mysteries of heavens are all contained within this!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt the tiger tally in his hand was as heavy as a thousand jun. It turned out that the so-called Guardian Commander was actually a chess player making moves in advance.

It was no wonder they sent him, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, there. It wouldn't alert the enemy, and they could use the special nature of the Divine Martial Dao Foundation to secretly lay out their plans.

Most importantly, it could attract a certain amount of activity.

If he could survive, it would naturally prove his strength. If he couldn't and died at Cold Crow Pass, then it would be because his strength was insufficient.

As for the Divine Martial Dao Foundation condensed by the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra*, it wouldn't be a big deal to disperse it again and find someone else to forge a new Divine Martial Dao Foundation.

Internally cursing, but outwardly showing a moved expression.

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother."

He bowed solemnly, but was stopped by Hundred Peaks True Lord.

"Don't be in a hurry."

This usually dignified Foundation Establishment True Lord actually revealed a cunning expression and took a bamboo scroll from his sleeve: "This is the *Heaven Grafting Technique*. Contemplate it on your way."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's confusion, he coughed lightly: "Three hundred miles east of Cold Crow Pass is an abandoned medicinal garden. It is said... it was once the secondary residence of the Old Man of Heavenly Pills."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred.

Having been in the Primordial Origin Sect for so long, he had naturally read many miscellaneous classics and inquired about many messages.

The Old Man of Heavenly Pills was a famous rogue cultivator a thousand years ago. His unique "Stealing Heavenly Pill Art" could steal the essence of another's Dao Foundation.

As the bamboo scroll entered his hand, he immediately understood the true purpose of the Clear Source True Lord's faction.

This was to have him "prune the branches and leaves" of the other two sects while suppressing the border!

Those who enter the Dao through martial arts have unparalleled combat power and should naturally be used on the edge of the blade.

When he left Hundred Peaks Peak, the setting sun had already dyed the sea of clouds blood-red.

Xu Yunfan looked towards the direction of Cold Crow Pass, his eyes profound.

To others, he now seemed to be in a somewhat isolated and helpless situation.

But the ferocity he had shown previously when fighting Li Baichuan, and even more so when he killed three Foundation Establishment True Lords with his sword upon returning to the Divine Martial World, was enough to prove that he was virtually invincible at the early Foundation Establishment stage!

The path of cultivation is a jungle where the strong prey on the weak. Since someone has set their sights on him, let's see who ends up benefiting whom in the end...

There was still time before he had to go to Cold Crow Pass as the Guardian Commander; there was a ten-year agreement.

In the eyes of other Foundation Establishment cultivators, this was just the time for a few cultivation sessions, but for Xu Yunfan, whose cultivation speed was terrifyingly fast, it was quite a long time.

There was still plenty of time. In addition to cultivating the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra*, he needed time to digest the Lin Seal Art, the Eight Sceneries of Xuandu Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Manual, the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method, and the Ten Thousand Chariots Transformation Sword.

With ten years and the加持 of the Attribute Panel, it was naturally an excellent transition period.

In the following days, Xu Yunfan basically didn't leave his room, spending his days on True武 Peak practicing his techniques.

At the peak of True武 Peak, the vital energy of the sky was fierce.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the Xuanwu rock he had casually flattened, the thirty-six major acupoints on his body swallowing and spitting out the vital energy of heaven and earth.

As the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra* circulated, the two completely different forces of True武 Heavenly Gang and Subduing Demons Earthly Evil intersected in his meridians, transforming into pure spiritual power that flowed through his meridians.

The Heavenly Gang was clear and ethereal, falling from the Baihui acupoint, while the Earthly Evil was heavy and thick, rising from the Yongquan acupoint.

The two forces clashed and stimulated each other in the Dantian Qi Sea. After being transformed by the Divine Martial Dao Foundation, they were finally condensed into a unique "True武 Spiritual Power."

With each complete cycle, the patterns of the龟蛇法相 behind him became a bit clearer, faintly resonating with the True武 Big Dipper constellations in the sky.

As the *True武 Subduing Demons Sutra* circulated, the image of a turtle and snake coiling around each other faintly appeared behind him, with every pattern flowing with starlight.

This was him refining the starlight of the Seven Mansions of the Big Dipper. Since he left a mark on the Divine Martial World by summoning Xuanwu starlight during Foundation Establishment, this technique had produced a mysterious resonance with it.

As the sutra was cultivated deeper, Xu Yunfan could already faintly perceive the position of the Divine Martial World.

Once he stepped into the mid Foundation Establishment stage, he would need to start working on condensing a heaven, which would save him a lot of thought.

Otherwise, he would likely have to be like other Foundation Establishment cultivators, needing to gather the essence of the five elements, nurture the five qi in his chest, and evolve a heaven within his body.
