# Chapter 492: The Great Compassionate Radiance, Lotus Supreme Sovereign King Buddha

He looked deeply at Xu Yunfan, recalling the fall of the Divine Martial True Lord. If the truth were known to him, he probably wouldn't even want to reincarnate; he would rush to the Pucha Pure Land to curse them out.

It was utterly shameless.

The World Honored One, Tathagata, had already planted a hidden stake within the Divine Martial World. Those unaware of the intricacies would mistake it for an empty Golden Core position.

"The Guardian Abbot of the 'True Martial Subduing Dragon Temple' in that Pure Land, the Subduing Dragon Arhat, has already reached the end of his lifespan and entered the cycle of reincarnation. Although he obtained the Bodhisattva Miao Miao Di's reincarnation edict to awaken his past life's wisdom within the vast sea of suffering, it will take at least a century for his true spirit to find a suitable Buddha fetus, accumulate enough power to cross the cycle and return to the Taihua Void Ruins World, and regain his peak Arhat power. This vacancy cannot be filled by ordinary means."

"And you..."

Lu Chunyang's gaze suddenly became incredibly clear and piercing as he looked straight at Xu Yunfan. "You possess the complete inheritance of the 'True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture,' and your cultivation in this method has surpassed that of the Subduing Dragon Arhat. At the very least, at this stage, you are the highest-level cultivator within the entire Taihua Void Ruins World who has practiced this scripture to the mid Foundation Establishment realm and still survives in this world."

How could an existence at the level of a Dao Lord, who calculates everything flawlessly, overlook such a crucial node?

Since the Subduing Dragon Arhat couldn't do it, they would simply replace him with someone else.

"Bearing the highest realm of the True Scripture, your very existence is an excellent 'vessel' perfectly compatible with the True Martial Subduing Devil Dao of the Buddhist path!"

"The World Honored Tathagata, an existence that plots the chessboard of heaven and earth, has set his sights on you. The Buddhist affinity entangled with destiny has already wrapped around you deeply; there is no way to push it away. This trip to the Eastern Wasteland is destined to be the prepared position on that chessboard. No matter how unwilling you are, you can only step into the trap."

Xu Yunfan's heart sank heavily, as if he had fallen into an ice cave.

Was the karma of the Pucha Pure Land truly this heavy?

But he quickly reacted.

It wasn't exactly that the karma was heavy.

Rather, when the World Honored Tathagata lowered his eyes to look at him, his Buddhist affinity became incredibly profound.

Where could one reason with such a thing?

Heaven and earth are vast, but the Dao Lord is the greatest.

Even if the Lord of Heaven existed, the Dao Lords would find a way to exploit loopholes.

He couldn't help but ask the biggest doubt in his heart: "Enlighten me, Ancestor! Disciple does not understand. Disciple is merely a minor cultivator who has just entered Foundation Establishment. What virtue or ability do I possess that would warrant the Pucha Pure Land laying down such a great karma? Please guide me, Ancestor!"

Lu Chunyang did not directly answer the question of "what virtue or ability."

He hesitated, looking at Xu Yunfan and weighing whether Xu Yunfan could bear such a heavy karma.

After all, some things, once known, mean you are involved. If unknown, then they remain unknown.

But as if recalling something, a strange expression flashed across Lu Chunyang's face as he spoke.

"This matter is of great importance; it is greatly related to the Dao Lord path of that World Honored Tathagata in the Pucha Pure Land."

"That one seeks greatly. The Eastern Wasteland is rampant with demons and evil spirits, the heavens and earth are turbid, and it is not a Buddhist domain. They intend to 'spread Buddhism eastward,' sowing seeds of the Dao everywhere. On the surface, it is to promote goodness and subdue demons, but in reality, it is to borrow the boundless karma of slaughter and conversion to launch a massive ritual ceremony covering the entire Eastern Wasteland and even parts of the neighboring star fields at a specific 'node'! Once this ritual succeeds, it will draw the attention of a top-tier position deeply connected to the supreme foundation of Buddhism from the depths of the universal laws of the Taihua Void Ruins World!"

"That position..." Lu Chunyang paused slightly, as if weighing the weight of his words. "Its name contains supreme Buddha might; it is called the Great Compassionate Radiance, Lotus Supreme Sovereign King Buddha!"

"This is the ultimate fruit of the Buddhist path, a supreme and ultimate position. Even currently, the Pucha Pure Land does not possess it, which is why they are trying every means to guide it down."

Lu Chunyang looked at Xu Yunfan, his gaze becoming extremely serious. "Once this position's projection descends upon a body, if the receiver has sufficient power and compatibility, they will almost immediately achieve the Bodhisattva position. Even in the worst case, it will definitely trigger a cataclysmic phenomenon, purifying all directions. At that time, the demonic energy of the entire Eastern Wasteland will be forcibly purified and converted, the turbid energy swept away, and clear light will rise. Using the receiver of the Bodhisattva position as the core of the Dharma principle, a 'Buddhist Kingdom on Earth' covering tens of millions of miles of mountains and rivers will be established on the spot. This will be the Pucha Pure Land's most stable wedge driven into the eastern frontier of the Taihua Void Ruins World, and an important step for that World Honored Tathagata to open up a pure land of his own Buddhist realm. This matter... the Pucha Pure Land has been scheming for countless ages, with a very deep foundation. Now that the timing is approaching, the karma is entangled deeply. Your appearance and involvement likely fit perfectly with a key 'trigger' in their plan."

As Lu Chunyang spoke, Xu Yunfan finally understood. The entanglement he had fallen into was not just a matter of a sect or a case; it was a chessboard of heaven and earth planned by a Dao Lord.

And he was one of the pieces on that chessboard, with his trajectory predetermined!

"Ancestor!"

Xu Yunfan was truly stunned. If this were true, then even Sun Wukong could not fly out of the Buddha's Five Finger Mountain.

"If that is truly the case, isn't this a dead end for the disciple? The Pucha Pure Land has immeasurable means. If the disciple... shows even a slight defiance, wouldn't that mean..."

Over the years within the Cold Crow Pass, there had naturally been many Buddhist cultivators coming and going for trade. Observing coldly, Xu Yunfan had glimpsed some of the secrets behind the cultivation methods of the Pucha Pure Land's Buddhist cultivators.

He saw them chanting the World Honored Tathagata, devoutly worshipping the True Buddha, and proclaiming "Everyone is a Buddha, everyone is a World Honored One." Beneath this dignified appearance, he secretly obtained several true scriptures of the pure land to study.

As long as a Buddhist cultivator achieved success within the Pucha Pure Land, their path of cultivation and lifeblood were almost entirely controlled by that World Honored Tathagata high above the pure land!

It seemed that everyone could become a Buddha, but in reality, the source of their true spirit had already silently been branded with the World Honored One's seal, making it difficult to escape his control for life.

"Hmph."

Lu Chunyang snorted lightly, carrying a hint of mockery. "With that World Honored Tathagata's unscrupulous nature for the sake of his goals, if the 'trigger' you provide isn't 'to his liking,' or if there are other obstacles, he might directly split a thought to descend upon the Eastern Wasteland and personally press you, this 'ant,' to 'play' his chess game. It's not impossible. The might of a Dao Lord is difficult to fathom."

This was said very bluntly, almost stating that the World Honored Tathagata was a shameless person. Ascending to the level of a Dao Lord makes it difficult to descend personally. The two Dao Lords of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect have not manifested their wonders in the Taihua Void Ruins World for a long time.

Only the World Honored Tathagata, who achieved Dao Lord status last, constantly descends to fish in shallow waters.

The more Xu Yunfan thought about it, the paler his face became.

A Dao Lord. Personally descending to crush him, this insect?

It wasn't impossible.

"Please guide me, Ancestor!"

Xu Yunfan bowed deeply, almost bending his waist to the ground. This was his only hope.

Lu Chunyang pondered for a moment, his gaze sweeping over Xu Yunfan, particularly lingering for a second on his Dantian, which was obscure in aura but stable in its foundational energy.

"Resisting the Buddhist affinity head-on is the worst strategy. Opposing the Pucha Pure Land directly is a dead end. I am in the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and cannot help you much. After all, having unclear relations with a Foundation Establishment True Lord from the Primordial Origin Sect would give the other True Lords in the Sword Sect a handle to attack me."
