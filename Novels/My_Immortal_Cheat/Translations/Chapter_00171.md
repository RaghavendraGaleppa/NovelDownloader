**Chapter 171: The Tomb Opens**

Not much time passed when a tremendous sound echoed. Boom!

The Saint-Devil suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp gleam in them, and said, "It's here."

Zhou Tian also stood up from the ground and asked, "The tomb has opened?" The Saint-Devil nodded before he could speak.

"Dong!" A bell rang, seemingly from ancient times. Zhou Tian could feel the very star-ring beneath his feet vibrating.

In the distance, a grand gateway rose, shimmering with iridescent light. Various symbols of order emerged, and faintly, the harmonious resonance of the Grand Dao could be heard.

A lotus blooming with radiant light flowed with brilliance there, releasing the aura of the Grand Dao. The sight was astonishing. The lotus was about a meter tall, resembling a small tree, radiating green light. Its entire form was dazzling, with thousands of silken light beams cascading down, enveloping itself.

As the gateway emerged, its colors shifted again. Scarlet light surged, golden mists rippled, and purple qi ascended. For a moment, it was resplendent with light, countless symbols densely appearing, transforming into ethereal forms such as celestial dragons, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas. The sound of the Grand Dao grew even grander, deafening.

Furthermore, amidst a rustling sound, the entire lotus seemed to transform into a Daoist scripture. Dense symbols appeared on its petals, rippling there, and a resonant sound emanated, making one feel on the verge of comprehending the Dao.

A moment later, something even more astonishing occurred. The golden, resplendent lotus suddenly turned black. The ethereal images of celestial dragons, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas vanished, replaced by ferocious beings like Rakshasas and Yakshas. Demonic sounds swirled, unsettling one's spirit.

"The Primordial Lotus of Wutian? Why such a strange phenomenon?" The Saint-Devil murmured, sensing something was amiss. According to the intelligence he had, he didn't know whose tomb this was; he only knew it contained what he sought.

Generally, the phenomena accompanying a tomb's opening were an evolution of the tomb owner's Dao before their death. Now, with the appearance of Wutian's Primordial Lotus, this tomb's owner was most likely Wutian. But how could this be possible? Wutian was clearly only a half-step Heavenly Venerate.

The Saint-Devil frowned deeply; things were turning out differently than he expected.

Around the gateway, four ethereal figures stood in mid-air, their appearances indistinct, each exuding a formidable aura. After the gateway stabilized, they each took out a palm-sized lotus and placed it upon the gate. Subsequently, the gateway burst forth with golden light, runes surged, and a crevice was opened.

Immediately after, those figures charged inside.

"What's going on?" "A rare treasure has appeared?" Several powerful auras erupted from within the star-ring, terrifying like gods and devils, also bewildered by the sudden events.

"That's a Heavenly Venerate's tomb!" someone roared. It was a white-haired elder holding an ancient gray tortoise shell, blood trickling from his mouth. He was a Heavenly King-level expert, skilled in divination. People like him had a habit of divining before doing anything.

The moment the phenomenon appeared, he began his divination, but only now did he get a result, and he suffered a backlash. Had the tomb owner not passed away countless years ago, he would have long since perished.

"What?" "A Heavenly Venerate's tomb!" Several more auras rose from the star-ring, belonging to experts who had been latent, now jolted into activity.

Whoosh! A figure shot out from the star-ring, darting towards the gateway in the void at extreme speed. It was a hidden Great Emperor.

"Haha, this fortune is mine! Let's see who dares to compete with me!" A rough roar came from the west. A giant ape with golden fur and piercing golden eyes, as if burning with fire, strode over the debris in the star-ring. Its long arms were incredibly elongated, almost reaching its knees, and it wielded a brass staff. It appeared slow, yet moved with extreme speed.

Just as the figure was about to dart into the gate, the brass staff arrived, directly smashing the figure away, shattering several massive star-ring debris. The figure floated in the void, its body torn apart, having been killed instantly by a single strike.

"The Arm-Extending Golden Ape clan," someone whispered, seemingly quite wary. This clan was known for pushing the limits of strength, and this giant ape had reached the Heavenly King level; its immense power was unimaginable.

The giant ape laughed heartily, "Everyone, I'll go first!" With that, it intended to charge into the gateway, its body rapidly shrinking. The other Heavenly King-level cultivators showed no reaction, merely observing, some even displaying pity.

"Get lost, for this Venerable One!" A dark palm print descended from the void, accompanied by a cold, stern shout. The giant ape was directly sent flying, coughing up golden blood, its breathing ragged.

Subsequently, a figure clad in a black robe descended, like a black hole, absorbing all nearby light. He stood before the gateway, his gaze icy. After scanning the surroundings, he turned and entered the gateway.

"Those guys from the Abyss Tomb strike so viciously! How are there still Dao Lords hidden here? I thought they had all left," the ancient ape, who had seemed on the verge of death, leaped up and rubbed its chest, muttering discontentedly after the figure entered.

Zhou Tian watched, dumbfounded, never expecting that fellow's near-death appearance just now was an act.

"Old monkey, call your old ancestor to get some payback!" someone jeered, but with hidden apprehension in their eyes. That was a Dao Lord from the Abyss Tomb clan; even though it was just a casual strike, the old monkey seemed fine. The toughness of its body was terrifying.

"My clan only occupies a mere twenty-odd spaces; how dare we provoke them? If you've got the guts, you go!" the giant ape retorted sarcastically. Seeing that person fall silent, it bared its teeth and added, "Any other Dao Lord big shots here? You go in first; I can't take a second palm strike."

A moment later, another figure descended, strangely dressed, entirely white, and wielding a black iron chain. It gave the giant ape a wicked grin and also entered.

The giant ape shivered, sucking in a cold breath. "A jailer from the Border Prison has arrived. That really scared me! And the Abyss Tomb clan, usually you don't see them for years in the star realm. How come they're all here today by such a coincidence?"

The Saint-Devil's eyes flickered, pondering something. How could there be so many coincidences at this time?

"Anyone else? No? Then I'm going in," the giant ape tested the waters, taking a step. Finding no one made a move, it fully entered.

Silence filled the void. Many could no longer hold back.

"Fellow Daoists, let's also go in," someone couldn't help but speak up. He was also a Heavenly King. That was a Heavenly Venerate's tomb! Who knew how many treasures it contained? A single step late could mean losing an opportunity.

He was the first to step forward, simultaneously guarding against others. Fortunately, no one attacked him.

Subsequently, Heavenly King-level experts continuously stepped forward and entered the gateway. Finally, the Saint-Devil ascended with Zhou Tian, attracting many gazes, primarily towards Zhou Tian, as there had been no previous instances of two people entering together.
