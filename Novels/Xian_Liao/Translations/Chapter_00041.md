# Chapter 41: The Provincial Examination (Part 1)

Amidst a retinue of officials, Military Commissioner Song He arrived at the examination hall within the Gongyuan (provincial examination compound). The assembled officials once again bowed in greeting.

Song first gestured to lift Education Commissioner Lu from his bow, smiling as he said, "Brother Fengxian, after this provincial examination concludes, you'll soon return to the capital to assume your post as Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review. In the future, I'll need to rely on you to put in a good word for me at court."

The Court of Judicial Review, along with the Ministry of Punishments and the Censorate, formed the Three Judicial Offices. As Vice Minister, Lu would assist the Minister of Judicial Review. Given that the current Minister was advanced in years, with his connections, Lu needed only endure a few more years before likely becoming Minister himself—one of the Nine Chief Ministers, wielding substantial authority.

In court politics, every position was like a peg in a hole. Reaching the rank of Vice Minister was already an extraordinary achievement—progressing further would be immensely difficult. That Lu had such prospects ahead made even Song regard him with quiet respect.

Lu gave a self-deprecating smile. "Though I'm honored by His Majesty's grace, I feel ashamed. I've yet to properly manage educational affairs here. Now returning to the capital to take up this new position—it's all rather overwhelming."

Song remarked, "Looking at Jiangzhou's past three provincial examinations—not a single successful candidate. The decline in scholarly standards is truly lamentable. Since you took office, I've heard of your efforts to promote education throughout the region. If even one candidate passes this time, it would count as a remarkable achievement."

Lu nodded slightly. "If during my tenure Jiangzhou can produce a successful candidate, it would at least justify His Majesty's trust."

Other officials listening exchanged knowing glances. The two senior officials were setting the tone—when grading papers this year, they should pay special attention to candidates from Jiangzhou.

Though provincial examinations used anonymous grading, with papers recopied before review, the numbering system contained subtle clues allowing those in the know to identify candidates' origins. This was an open secret.

While the examination system was rigorous, such minor loopholes were undetectable except to the most capable officials. Even if discovered, exposing them would only offend colleagues and stir unrest—more trouble than it was worth.

With disasters and banditry increasing, the court was deliberately strengthening military commissioners' authority to suppress unrest and improve governance. The broader trend was replacing circuit administrations with provincial systems, establishing governors combining administrative, military, supervisory, and judicial powers.

As military commissioner, Song was already the highest authority in Tiannan Circuit. Nominally limited to military affairs, becoming governor would make him a true regional overlord.

Practically speaking, Song's governorship was assured. But until officially confirmed, complications could arise. Hence his efforts to cultivate Lu, a future capital official. Ensuring Lu had achievements to boast of would give him face and credibility in the capital.

Lu understood this perfectly and had no reason to refuse. Such exchanges of official favors were often sealed in casual conversation.

Lu's only regret was the promising examination candidate he'd discovered but hadn't had time to properly mentor. His letter summoning Zhou Qing to take the provincial examination wasn't with expectations of success, but to give the young man experience.

Whether Zhou Qing achieved anything further would depend on himself. This at least repaid a debt to the late Elder Zhang. Though if the Zhang boy's essays proved utterly unreadable, even Lu wouldn't shamelessly promote him.

Only about ten candidates came from Jiangzhou this year, with greater emphasis placed on policy essays requiring clear understanding of current affairs—Zhou Qing's strength, as most candidates lacked such training.

Zhou Qing was led to his examination cell. Cells varied in quality—being placed near a "rain cell" (leaky) or "stench cell" (near latrines) could significantly impact performance. Many failed candidates blamed their seating.

Zhou Qing's luck was average—assigned a rain cell. If it rained, the difficulty would increase, especially during early spring's lingering chill with drafts penetrating the cell. Less hardy examinees might fall ill. Once locked in, they could only leave for necessities, enduring any discomfort.

Neighboring candidates with rain cells groaned, but Zhou Qing remained calm. However difficult, it couldn't compare to his journey here. He almost hoped for light snow—even with charcoal braziers, others would suffer.

Soon, dark clouds gathered, releasing willow-catkin snowflakes. Initial snowfall wasn't bitterly cold, but melting snow brought piercing chill. Candidates silently prayed the snow would continue, allowing them to finish exams undisturbed. Those with better cells gave silent thanks to deities worshipped before the exam.

In his rain cell, Zhou Qing watched the snowfall with wry amusement—was this fortune or misfortune? Ultimately fortune. Compared to Bear Form training's hardships, this weather was trivial. Practicing had worn patches of bark from the mulberry tree in his courtyard, drawing mocking glances from his rooster, whose dawn cries grew more vigorous after witnessing Zhou Qing's training.

During his travels, Zhou Qing found himself missing his courtyard—his true home in this world. Passing the examination would allow him to formally purchase it from the Lin family. His birth family's home had already been redeemed from Butcher Hu.

Willow-catkin snowflakes clung to his robes. Though unaffected by cold, Zhou Qing lit his brazier to avoid standing out.

Next came distribution of questions and papers. This world's provincial examination drew from the Four Books and Five Classics, requiring at least 300 characters per answer—three questions from the Four Books, four from the Five Classics. Candidates needed to complete at least five; failing to do so made success unlikely.

Beyond these seven questions was a policy essay. Traditionally, policy essays carried less weight in grading, though regulations originally accorded them equal importance with classical scholarship. Examiners emphasizing policy essays remained within rules.

Provincial examination questions reflected chief examiners' personal styles, allowing far more discretion than metropolitan examinations.

Reading the seven classical questions, Zhou Qing smiled—no obscure or tricky "combined sentences" questions, with three resembling famous essays he'd studied. Setting aside the policy question, he focused first on his strengths.

Closing his eyes, he settled himself as words began flowing through his mind.
