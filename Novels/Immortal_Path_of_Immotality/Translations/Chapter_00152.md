# Chapter 151: Another Big Black Pot

Before long, a burly, disheveled man with a thick beard entered the grand hall. Covered in dust, he had just traveled over a hundred thousand miles from the depths of the East Sea, appearing as if he had recently recovered from a serious illness.

"Are you the Venerable Bear Mountain?" 

The Sect Master examined the bearded man. Seeing his genuine travel-weariness and the eager ambition in his eyes, the Sect Master's earlier suspicions wavered.

"This humble one is Bear Mountain. The title 'Venerable' is undeserved—merely a courtesy from fellow cultivators in the East Sea."

Venerable Bear Mountain bowed respectfully, his words precise and devoid of any impropriety.

The Sect Master nodded and cut straight to the point. The hundreds of Golden Core cultivators seated on either side straightened their postures, their gazes fixed intently on the newcomer.

"Tell me, did you visit the imperial palace in the capital three nights ago?"

"No, I did not."

"Why have many cultivators reported seeing you there?"

"This humble one knows nothing of this..."

"Report your whereabouts over the past three months."

...

Venerable Bear Mountain hastily recounted every island, sea, mountain, and city he had visited over the past three months, detailing his arrivals and departures without leaving any gaps. His account was flawless.

The Golden Core cultivators present turned their eyes back to the Sect Master, who remained impassive. He dutifully beckoned Venerable Bear Mountain forward.

"I will now scan your body and inspect your storage pouch. Any objections?"

"Uh... As the Sect Master commands."

Venerable Bear Mountain hesitated slightly, but under the collective gaze of the Golden Core cultivators and the smirks of the Foundation Establishment cultivators behind them, he stepped forward, bewildered.

After a thorough search that yielded nothing, the Sect Master withdrew his hand. Three rounds of inspection had revealed no flaws—it seemed this man truly had no involvement.

Venerable Bear Mountain sighed in relief, and the assembled crowd averted their eyes, including Lin Shan, who stood beside Protector Yan. 

Lin Shan knew the Black Lotus Buddha Statue had been absorbed by his enhancement panel, and the "Venerable Bear Mountain" from that night had been his disguise. The real Bear Mountain was indeed clean.

But just then, the white-browed elder seated at the far left among the three Nascent Soul cultivators suddenly opened his eyes, a brilliant light shining within.

"He bears traces of incense offerings."

The declaration sent a ripple of shock through the hall.

Throughout the proceedings, the three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings had remained aloof, seemingly detached from worldly affairs. Now, one had spoken, pointing directly to a crucial clue.

---

The Sect Master quickly bowed. "Elder Preceptor of Discipline, your meaning is..."

"Traces of incense offerings only form upon receiving the baptism of faith or wielding faith-based divine abilities."

The Preceptor of Discipline's white brows twitched as his voice, resonant as thunder, struck the hearts of all present. His words seemed to carry the weight of cosmic principles, stirring the spiritual energy in the hall.

The Sect Master understood the nature of incense traces. The Preceptor's explanation was clearly for the benefit of the Foundation Establishment cultivators below. But what the Sect Master sought were concrete leads—where the faith might be hidden, for instance.

Yet the Preceptor of Discipline said no more, evidently sparing with words, leaving the Sect Master to handle the matter as he saw fit.

Venerable Bear Mountain, trembling in terror, had caught the attention of a Nascent Soul Dharma King! 

And this so-called "incense trace" seemed to be damning evidence against him. 

But evidence of what? What were they even talking about? 

Why had he been summoned here? How had he suddenly become a suspect?

Venerable Bear Mountain was utterly in the dark. He knew nothing of the events at the palace that night, nor why he had been called here today. 

He had merely recovered from the curse inflicted by a "mysterious powerhouse" in the East Sea and come inland to join the righteous-demonic war, hoping to earn merit points for his sect. How had he walked straight into a colossal accusation?

Meanwhile, Lin Shan, lurking in a corner, secretly rejoiced. Could it be that the grudge he hadn't yet settled would be avenged by the demonic sect's higher-ups?

---

After deliberation between the Sect Master and the hundred Golden Core protectors, and with the tacit approval of the three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings, it was unanimously decided to conduct an ultimate inspection on Venerable Bear Mountain to determine whether the "incense traces" were linked to the missing Black Lotus Buddha Statue.

The method: "Soul Search."

"Soul Search" was an exceptionally ruthless and domineering technique. Those subjected to it—be they cultivators or demonic beasts—would suffer severe damage to their intellect. 

Even if they didn't descend into a vegetative state, their mental capacity would regress to that of a three-year-old, effectively rendering them useless for life.

But in the eyes of the demonic path, such methods were not off-limits. What could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator do against the collective will of so many elders?

When the ruler demands death, the subject has no choice but to obey.

Upon hearing the verdict, Venerable Bear Mountain was petrified. The prospect of a "Soul Search" shattered his composure entirely.

His legs gave way as he collapsed to the floor, wailing and pleading his innocence.

---

He was truly innocent! To this moment, he had no idea what crime he was accused of. Dragged before a gathering of high-ranking cultivators for no reason, he now faced the erasure of his very mind.

"Have mercy, Sect Master! This humble bear is innocent!" 

"Protector Liang, save me! I'm innocent!" 

"Esteemed elders, see the truth!" 

...

Venerable Bear Mountain kowtowed desperately, even appealing to his former superior, the Golden Core protector of the Black Lotus Sect he had once pledged allegiance to. The protector merely cast him a cold glance and ignored him.

Even Lin Shan, standing nearby, felt a twinge of pity at his enemy's heart-wrenching cries.

This guy's really got it rough!

But... why do I feel so happy about it?

Back on Red Shrimp Island in the East Sea, Venerable Bear Mountain had conspired with the Black-Red Twin Fiends to ambush Lin Shan. Had Lin Shan not uncovered their plot, the three might have succeeded in their sneak attack.

Later, the curse they cast was thwarted by an East Sea expert, sparing Lin Shan temporarily. But that didn't mean he had forgotten the grudge. Once enmity was sown, it could only end in death—especially since Venerable Bear Mountain felt the same way.

No matter how Venerable Bear Mountain begged and pleaded on his knees, the Sect Master remained unmoved. Today, he was determined to extract the origin of the "incense traces" from the man's mind and ascertain their connection to the Black Lotus Buddha Statue.

As for whether this man was innocent? Hah! Better to wrong one than let the guilty escape.

---

In the grand hall, Venerable Bear Mountain was immobilized by restrictive spells, kneeling before the Sect Master as he awaited his final judgment.

Tears welled in his eyes as he watched the Sect Master's approaching hand. He envisioned all his memories—from birth till now—being rifled through at will, his consciousness shattered, leaving him a mindless husk...

"Rip!"

A tearing sound came from his rear, drawing all eyes in the hall. A strange, patterned purple tentacle sprouted from Venerable Bear Mountain's backside, swiftly growing like a tail.

"Snap!"

The tentacle lashed over its owner's head, intercepting the Sect Master's hand mid-reach.
