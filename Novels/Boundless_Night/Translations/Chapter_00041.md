Chapter 41: Defeated, I'll Become a God

Last time, at the old nobleman's estate, that eccentric fellow went to see the five-meter-tall Xie Lingxi first. When he came back and mentioned it to Qin Ming, his words were vague and misleading, then he just turned around and ran off. Now, he's pulling another stunt. Qin Ming made a mental note; the next time they met, he'd beat that man until he was genuinely sick.

Nie Rui was like a beam of light piercing through the night mist in Scarlet Cloud City, one of the two most dazzling individuals in two decades. After his first awakening, his physical capabilities broke the city's records. Now that he spoke, the teams from the Cao, Mu, and Wei families all showed surprise, and many gazes turned towards Qin Ming. Instantly, others understood that this must be the person Nie Rui was looking for.

For a moment, Qin Ming also experienced being the center of attention. All the young nobles of Scarlet Cloud City looked at him, sizing him up. Of course, this was entirely due to Nie Rui; without the mention from this exceptionally gifted individual from Scarlet Cloud City, no one would pay attention to a young man from a remote place. Many showed expressions of surprise, observing him with scrutiny, wondering if a true genius could emerge from such a secluded little place. It seemed rather unlikely. However, some noble young ladies were quite lively, discussing in private.

"His appearance is quite refined. If he paid a little attention to his image, his temperament could improve even further. He shouldn't let his black hair hang loose, and if he replaced his dark armor with bright, dazzling plate armor, I feel he would be very handsome!"

…

Nie Rui smiled warmly, expressing his desire to spar with Qin Ming. "Don't feel any pressure. We'll just have a casual match. I trust the judgment of Master Xu's only disciple."

Qin Ming now wanted to punch that eccentric fellow even more. At the same time, he realized that Master Xu Kong was quite extraordinary, earning great respect from the people of Scarlet Cloud City.

"I can't compare to you. Although I'm from a remote village, I've heard many people say that Scarlet Cloud City has produced a pair of incredible young men and women who have amazed the entire region."

The young nobles present all nodded, believing he spoke the truth. In the region ruled by Scarlet Cloud City, the most outstanding young talents were naturally the most formidable geniuses there.

Nie Rui leaped off his white rhinoceros, his silver armor gleaming, radiating youthful vigor, as if his entire being was glowing. His smile was very approachable. "You're too modest. I've met You Liangyun. It's nothing; we'll just have a casual spar."

Others didn't understand what he meant, and Nie Rui couldn't directly say that You Liangyun had once been defeated by this young man.

Given the situation, Qin Ming couldn't refuse.

Nie Rui said, "I've already undergone my second awakening. I will suppress my strength, so don't worry, I definitely won't go overboard."

Qin Ming initially thought of using this as an excuse to decline, but after a moment's thought, constantly refusing didn't seem right. He finally nodded.

"Nie Rui, be careful with your strikes," Cao Long interjected, worried that he might injure Qin Ming.

"Qin Ming, do you want to switch weapons?" Mu Qing asked.

Everyone present knew that when Nie Rui first awakened, the strength of his arms reached a terrifying seven hundred and ninety jin, which was why it caused such a sensation, touted as the best in twenty years. You Liangyun, his peer, was originally outstanding, able to lift six hundred and fifty jin, but ultimately could only rank third. In people's eyes, if Qin Ming were to use his cumbersome long-handled black-gold hammer against Nie Rui, it would be utterly unwise to clash in terms of strength.

Qin Ming "acquiesced readily," putting down his large hammer. "Besides the long-handled hammer, I'm quite skilled with a spear. Can anyone lend me one?"

Mu Qing looked at the young men behind her and found that most used long blades, and the few spears available were of poor quality, as they were far too light. Other nobles remained silent. After a brief quiet, one person finally laughed, "Use my purple-gold spear. It's a thousand-forged weapon. This way, it fulfills one of my wishes: indirectly crossing hands with Brother Nie. It's an honor."

Qin Ming noticed that everyone held Nie Rui in high regard; even borrowing a spear prompted such words.

"Nie Rui, perhaps you will lose," said the young woman seated on the back of a black tiger. Her bright eyes and white teeth, her black hair fluttering back in the wind, exuded an ethereal, otherworldly grace. Her name was Shen Jiayun, and her strength was comparable to Nie Rui's. Most importantly, she had already been chosen by a transcendent being and was destined to walk an incomparably brilliant path. In the eyes of many young nobles, she had already won at the starting line.

Nie Rui walked forward, his silver armor glowing, his smile radiant, holding a long blade. "Please!"

Qin Ming had already taken the purple-gold spear into his hand, weighed it, and then twirled it into a series of spear flourishes, instantly stirring up purple streams of light.

"Little Qin, be careful, don't get hurt!" Xu Yueping shouted.

"If it gets too much, surrender immediately," Old Man Liu said even more bluntly.

A group of young nobles chuckled lightly. With Nie Rui's strength, he could naturally control his power precisely. Such a spar held no suspense and wouldn't injure the young man. Some people were privately making hand gestures, betting whether Nie Rui would win in four moves or just one exchange. They couldn't openly gamble or discuss, as overtly disrespecting the young hunter wouldn't be good, and it would also seem disrespectful to Nie Rui, who was personally engaging.

"I predict Nie Rui will defeat him after three blade forms."

"I'll be more conservative. After seven blade forms, perhaps. Since Nie Rui is personally testing him, it means this young man must have some tricks up his sleeve."

*Clang!*

In an instant, everyone's attention was drawn back to the fierce clash by the intense sound of metal. They all watched intently, astonished to find that the two had already exchanged more than a dozen blows.

*Swish!* They quickly separated, standing over twenty meters apart. The accumulated snow on the ground erupted into the air, as if it were snowing again, with large goose feathers. Only then did the trees nearby crackle, and large branches fell. Everyone felt a tremor in their hearts, their concentration heightened. They realized they had misjudged. This lightning-fast exchange had almost reached the upper limit for those who had just undergone their first awakening.

"This young man from a remote place is not simple at all!"

"What's his name? Qin Ming, right? I'll remember it."

A group of people whispered, as if re-evaluating the young man in the arena. Even Cao Long and Wei Zhirou showed surprise. Although they had spent a few days with him and knew Qin Ming was unusual, they hadn't expected him to be this formidable.

Mu Qing, shrouded entirely in a black robe, spoke, "Qin Ming, fight without holding back. Nie Rui isn't that petty."

"It's more satisfying when you don't hide anything," Nie Rui nodded.

Old Man Liu secretly muttered, "Little Qin is even more formidable than I imagined. His name might already precede him before he even reaches Scarlet Cloud City."

Qin Ming didn't use his strongest domain—strength. He relied entirely on pure "spear techniques." He adapted on the fly, reacting with incredible speed, infusing blade techniques into his spear forms, yet making it imperceptible to outsiders.

Nie Rui moved again, his speed so great that he crushed the snow underfoot, generating a strong wind that carried a flurry of snowflakes. The silver long blade in his hand cut out a dazzling light, carrying wind and snow, as if he were commanding wind and thunder.

Qin Ming did not meet this blade head-on. His body shifted to the side, evading the downward cleaving blade. Then, in a flash, he swiftly pressed the purple-gold spear against the back of the blade, striking a shower of sparks, and instantly thrust it close to Nie Rui. This scene made many people's pupils contract. The young man's grasp of the battle situation was too astonishing. Under such a fierce blade form, he could seize an opportunity in an instant. The spear pressed against the back of the blade, the two weapons crossing at a very small angle. The spear's tip was like a dragon slithering along a mountain ridge, tearing through the night, directly assaulting its target.

Nie Rui exerted force with his right hand, lifting his blade sharply, intending to knock the spear away, while his left hand faintly glowed, preparing to deflect the spear shaft. Qin Ming gripped the spear with both hands, pressing it fully onto the back of the blade, and vigorously shook it. The spear tip immediately trembled violently, creating a large bloom of spear lights. At this moment, Nie Rui couldn't possibly knock the spear away with one hand, and the spear tip before him became a blur, like countless stars twinkling simultaneously, rushing towards him. He was forced to withdraw his blade and quickly shift sideways to evade.

In this exchange, he was surprisingly suppressed and pushed onto the defensive, retreating a considerable distance before finally stabilizing himself. For a moment, silence fell upon the scene. Everyone felt it was incredible. This young man's on-the-spot adaptation was excellent; the purple-gold long spear in his hands seemed to come alive, like a flood dragon baring its fangs and claws, hunting in the night.

"I feel like this spear has a soul in your hands. It's not following any rules, not conventional spear techniques. You use it spontaneously, and every move is brilliant," Nie Rui said with a solemn expression, then fell silent. After suppressing his own strength to a certain level, he focused and charged.

In an instant, he and Qin Ming were engaged in a fierce battle, the blade light in his hand flashing, as if trying to cleave through the dense night. Wherever he and Qin Ming passed, large sections of tree branches fell, and the snow on the ground exploded. Some large trees also toppled over with rumbling sounds as they rushed past, kicking up large amounts of snow.

"This young man from a remote place, although not as strong as Nie Rui, is also close to seven hundred jin! How fierce!"

"His spear techniques seem to be various common, unstructured forms. Not a single spear strike goes beyond our comprehension, but there's a power that turns decay into wonder."

"Because he has no fixed forms; most are spontaneous adaptations, transforming various ordinary loose forms into brilliant moves!"

Finally, even Cao Long and Feng Xing personally commented.

Spear techniques? Qin Ming thought to himself. These are blade techniques, disguised "spear-blades." Compared to hammer-blades, this offered a uniquely different experience. He became smoother with each move, not constrained by the fixed killing moves of blade manuals, but freely combining and unleashing them. For instance, his spear swept horizontally, the tip like a blade, slashing towards his opponent's flesh, and he was shaking the spear. In blade techniques, this was "Sea and Sky Horizon," where the trembling blade created layers of swirling light, following like surging waves. Now, using the spear tip to replace the blade, it similarly stirred up a flurry of illusions. In its tremors, the spear tip's oscillation frequency was even greater, which amplified the blade intent of "Sea and Sky Horizon." At this moment, it was as if thunder erupted over the sea and sky, and countless bolts of lightning struck the vast ocean.

Nie Rui retreated awkwardly, sweat beading on his forehead, his black hair clinging messily to his face. He felt a bit flustered; he was about to lose.

The next moment, Qin Ming pushed his "spear-blade" to a new height, even using a "kicking blade technique," pushing the purple-gold spear out and then kicking it repeatedly with his foot. His speed was like lightning, startling Nie Rui into continuous evasion, making him sweat even more. The most crucial part was that the spear wasn't kicked away; it ultimately moved like a living flood dragon, leaping around his body before finally landing back in his hand.

*Clang!*

As Nie Rui's long blade was suppressed by the purple-gold spear, his arm vibrated, sparks flew, and several plates on his silver armor cracked, pierced by the spear tip.

Qin Ming retracted his hand and plunged the spear into the ground. He felt a bit regretful; it was his first time using the "spear-blade," and he had become too engrossed, not holding back while trying to fully experience it. Originally, he didn't want to make things difficult for himself and intended to end in a draw. But without realizing it, he had simply defeated his opponent.

The scene was silent. Everyone was incredulous. Nie Rui, the most dazzling genius of Scarlet Cloud City in twenty years, had actually lost to a young hunter from a remote place. Everyone was dumbfounded, and for the first time, began to seriously examine Qin Ming, feeling their understanding had been strongly challenged.

The Forbidden Land—Black and White Mountain—from five hundred years ago, could it be awakening, imbuing this remote land with spiritual energy once more? Many speculated.

Shen Jiayun, the young woman seated on the black tiger, broke the silence. "Nie Rui, are you alright?"

Nie Rui shook his head. "I'm fine. I lost, and I accept it wholeheartedly."

"Are you really fine? Are you not disheartened, feeling very upset?" Shen Jiayun asked playfully, genuinely not caring about his feelings at all.

"What could be wrong with me? Brother Qin has woken me up, making me realize that perhaps I'm really not suited for this path," Nie Rui put away his long blade, finally shaking his head and sighing. "Since that's the case, then I'll choose the path to becoming a god."

Qin Ming was deliberating how to respond, but then he heard such insane words. Before this, You Liangyun had been defeated and decided to inherit a noble title, thereby living a life of luxury and indulgence. This person was even more extreme; if he lost, he would become a god. Qin Ming's breathing became a little heavy.

Nie Rui saw his expression and finally smiled. "It's not what you're imagining."

It was clear Nie Rui wasn't petty. He didn't bear grudges over his defeat; instead, he seemed to have completely let go, deciding to walk a different path.

"So-called deities are only because we are still young, our strength is insufficient, and our understanding is limited for now, making it hard to comprehend. But surely, they are just a type of strong living being. An elder from a secret sect has taken an interest in me, saying I possess a rare 'divine aptitude' and can follow their path. *Sigh*, I originally wished to walk my own path through the boundless, dark world with my flesh and blood body, but now I have no choice. I've recognized my own limits," Nie Rui sighed.

"Stop sighing. If you keep sighing, what about everyone else?" Qin Ming couldn't help but say.

"Qin Ming, I'd also like to spar with you," Shen Jiayun, seated on the black tiger, spoke. She gracefully leaped to the ground, her black hair fluttering, and approached, holding a long sword.

Immediately, the forest clearing became lively. The people from Scarlet Cloud City could no longer hold back, all whispering and discussing. The changes today were simply too unexpected.

"Good!" Qin Ming nodded in agreement. Since he had already defeated one, he didn't mind a second match.

In an instant, sword light flashed like a rainbow across the snowy ground, accompanied by the sound of wind and thunder, like numerous electric dragons descending. Shen Jiayun was very strong; in the eyes of ordinary people, it was like a sword immortal dancing.

However, she too was defeated. Qin Ming used the tip of his spear to flick away a string of blue, glittering beaded flowers from her hair, and then pressed the large spear onto her right shoulder.

The scene fell silent again. Everyone watched in a trance. The two most formidable geniuses of Scarlet Cloud City in twenty years had both been defeated by the same person.

Shen Jiayun smoothed her hair and smiled. "Young man, you won't need ten years. If we meet again in just one year, you will be far from my match." She showed no disappointment or dejection, her smile especially radiant, possessing a charm that could topple cities with a smile, a captivating grace that was quite dazzling.

"I look forward to it," Qin Ming said, lifting his spear from her fragrant shoulder. With a gentle flick, the string of blue, glittering beaded flowers fell. He quickly tapped it with the spear tip, and the beaded flowers reinserted themselves into her cloud-like hair.
