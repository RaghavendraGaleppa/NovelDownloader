Chapter 56: Three Absolutes

"Why? What right do they have to demand we pay Night Silver?"

"Just a while ago, people were starving to death. Now that things have barely improved, how can we withstand such exploitation from Golden Rooster Ridge!"

Everyone was indignant.

Although grain from outside had been brought in by giant beasts, it still had to be purchased. With such a poor harvest, where would they find the money to pay tribute to Golden Rooster Ridge?

The most crucial point was that they were being forced to support a group of bandits.

In this remote area, for a family of three living frugally, one Night Silver could just about cover a month's basic necessities. Now, the two men sent by Golden Rooster Ridge sat brazenly on the back of a rooster, opening their mouths casually and demanding a month's living expenses from each household. It was simply too much to bear.

Moreover, they didn't know if this was a one-time payment or if it would become a regular occurrence, with payments due periodically.

"These bandits truly have no humanity!"

The crowd was furious; people wanted to resist.

The two Golden Rooster Riders had merely come to notify the villages and had already ridden far from the village entrance, yet they could still hear the angry protests of the people behind them.

"These mud-footed commoners are overreacting. We need to tell the higher-ups not to truly incite their emotions and provoke desperate resistance."

"Yes, the stronghold's strength has been severely weakened. This is a tumultuous time; we must pay attention to the impact."

...

"Doesn't Crimson Cloud City care?"

The villages outside the mountain could not remain calm; everyone was discussing this matter.

Some suggested finding the Mountain Patrol Squad to intervene, and that they should report to Crimson Cloud City as soon as possible, emphasizing that Golden Rooster Ridge should not be allowed to act recklessly during this special winter.

An old man sighed, "Crimson Cloud City's higher-ups might not have the energy to deal with these matters lately."

"Why?"

"An itinerant merchant brought the latest news from there: two major organizations suspect that Crimson Cloud City Lord Ling Xu colluded with high-level strange beings from Black and White Mountain, and that he tricked them last time in the mountains."

According to the merchant, the atmosphere in Crimson Cloud City was delicate. There was no direct evidence for this claim; the two large organizations merely suspected that Ling Xu's heart was exceptionally dark, and that he had used their power to manipulate them. This matter would likely end up unresolved, but for now, Crimson Cloud City's higher-ups were too preoccupied.

Qin Ming gazed at the inky night sky, listening to the people's discussions, his body radiating a dazzling Heavenly Light, his emotions surging violently.

As long as one was human, they possessed seven emotions and six desires; it was impossible to always remain calm.

A moment later, the Heavenly Light on Qin Ming's body receded.

He entered the cellar and selected two blood snakes, six or seven feet long, that had mutated once. Then, he picked up his long-handled Obsidian Gold Hammer, pounded the two spiritual creatures into a paste on an iron plate, and personally cooked them into a pot of meat stew.

Before he left, he needed to make some arrangements.

Soon after, Qin Ming arrived at the small courtyard next door.

"Brother Lu, are you feeling better? I hunted a spiritual mountain beast in the mountains; perhaps it can help you with your rebirth."

Qin Ming didn't want to conceal everything, so he told Lu Ze that eating the meat stew would not only quickly heal his injuries but also potentially lead to a complete rebirth in the coming days.

"Little Qin!" Lu Ze was a straightforward man and didn't know what to say, only nodding heavily.

Liang Wanqing's eyes were red. She knew what a physical rebirth meant in such an environment; from now on, she wouldn't have to worry every time Lu Ze went into the mountains.

Qin Ming said, "Sister-in-law, you can also eat some. There's enough stew; even if your body can't undergo a complete rebirth, it can still improve your constitution."

"It smells so good, Uncle! I want some too," Wen Rui, who hadn't slept yet, said, smelling the blood snake's unique aroma like a greedy kitten, practically drooling.

"You're still too young; you can't eat this, or it might lead to premature awakening. Come, Uncle brought you the freshest wild fruits. These are varieties cultivated by Old Huang."

Wen Rui's big eyes lit up, but she was also a little puzzled, saying, "Uncle, last time you said these were fruits that Uncle Niu worked hard to grow."

"Mm, pretty much," Qin Ming smiled. These were naturally fruits from the Wild Ox Ridge.

"Uncle, me too..." Wen Hui, barely two years old, woke up groggily.

Then, Qin Ming heard the squirrel squeaking, bowing to him in its cage. This time, it had its sights set on the meat stew made from the blood snake.

...

The next day, Qin Ming polished his mutton-fat jade iron saber. It was far too conspicuous; if it didn't emerge, fine, but once it did, it had to cut down any opponent who saw it. He disguised and concealed the blade, then returned it to its sheath.

Qin Ming retrieved a long pole to use as a spear and found the bow and arrows he had once used. Now, he could truly be called a master of both spear and arrow!

Soon, he displayed astonishing spear techniques in the courtyard. The wooden pole in his hand moved like a coiled dragon, spiraling in the air as if about to soar into the heavens. With a gentle flick, the long pole split into dozens of illusory images, striking different areas. Dozens of small, falling snowflakes were instantly pierced.

However, as Qin Ming increased the force of his flick, the sturdy long wooden pole could not withstand his immense power and snapped into more than a dozen pieces.

He picked up the bow and tested it once before giving up. With even a slight pull from him, either the bowstring would snap or the bow itself would break.

"In that case, my 'Dual Mastery of Spear and Arrow' is a false claim; I don't even have suitable weapons." Qin Ming decided to go into the mountains to find some appropriate weapons.

The Great Rift Valley was silent; the Golden Rooster Ridge guards stationed here had long since departed.

Qin Ming entered the desolate underground cavern, wandering through the spiderweb-like passages for a long time. He saw some broken armor, snapped weapons, and large amounts of bloodstains, as well as some broken horns and fragments of bones from strange beings.

Finally, deep within the underground cavern, Qin Ming discovered a chillingly sinister altar. He kicked it apart, and large swaths of black mist billowed out. However, when his body radiated Heavenly Light, the sinister mist rapidly dissipated and evaporated.

"What did they do here?" Qin Ming felt that the two major bandits and the mystic who could turn into mist were colluding and had done nothing good here.

He searched for a long time and found some intact weapons. As for armor, he managed to piece together a few sets; those that could be preserved undamaged were naturally fine quality. He picked a large spear and a long saber, found a sturdy bow that could barely withstand his immense strength, and gathered a pile of iron arrows, filling six quivers.

"Tonight, I shall be the Saber Immortal, the Spear Saint, and the Arrow God—the Three Absolutes of Saber, Spear, and Arrow!" Qin Ming murmured to himself.

He donned a set of gleaming armor, carried his bow and arrows, gripped a heavy and exceptionally sharp long spear, and strapped a long saber inscribed with a phoenix pattern to his back as he emerged from the underground cavern.

"Hm?" Qin Ming was somewhat surprised to find traces of Old Man Liu outside the Great Rift Valley.

He didn't hide, walking directly towards him.

Old Man Liu saw him, his expression extremely serious. "I heard you went into the mountains and guessed you might come here. Are you perhaps planning to act against Golden Rooster Ridge?"

Since their last trip into the mountains to destroy the ant nest together, Old Man Liu had witnessed Qin Ming's strength, which far exceeded his peers. It was like a sudden epiphany, and he understood many things. Furthermore, he had personally seen Qin Ming quickly cultivate Heavenly Light Force at Old Wu's house, which both shocked him and made him realize that Qin Ming could probably deal with those who had undergone four rebirths, and was quite eager to do so.

Qin Ming realized that the old man was quite astute, likely having guessed quite a bit.

"If you're really going to Golden Rooster Ridge, I know I can't stop you, but don't rush into action. Wait another day or two."

"Why?"

Old Man Liu's expression was solemn. "Golden Rooster Ridge came into existence because the once famous Golden Thieves used it as a stopping point when traveling between two major regions for business in the early years. Although it's hardly used now, what if you just happen to run into them? That would be very unlucky."

Qin Ming gasped, inhaling the cold air with small snowflakes dancing in it. "Is your fate really that special, old man? Originally, nothing would happen, but now that you've said it, something just might."

He naturally didn't believe in such things; he was just joking. He only believed in his own strength.

Old Man Liu said, "I'll find someone to inquire first. You're not in a rush for just a day or two."

"Do you have connections that can inquire about the Golden Thieves' whereabouts?" Qin Ming asked, surprised.

"How could I have such connections or abilities? But I can judge based on past situations and current details. It's said that whenever the Golden Thieves are about to appear, the two major bandits of Golden Rooster Ridge will order people a day or two in advance to prepare various rare ingredients, purchase fine wines, and even invite beautiful dancers."

Qin Ming immediately nodded, feeling this was quite reliable, and decided to wait for Old Man Liu's news first.

Afterward, he hid his armor and weapons in the mountains, then returned to the village with a hunted prey and Old Man Liu.

At this time, the village was filled with indignation, because people from Golden Rooster Ridge had come again.

"Who are we doing this for? Isn't it all to protect you? That's why we're urgently recruiting rebirth practitioners."

Golden Rooster Ridge had already realized that the villages' resistance was strong, so their current emissaries aimed to ease the atmosphere and offer some necessary explanations.

"A few days ago, for the sake of the villagers outside the mountain, our Golden Rooster Ridge fought fiercely against the strange beings in the Great Rift Valley, slaughtering a large number of mutated creatures who wanted to occupy the outer parts of the mountain. We were almost completely annihilated."

Upon hearing this, some villagers glared at them with hostility. Who didn't know that Golden Rooster Ridge entered the mountain for mysterious resources, and that they were almost completely wiped out due to their own weakness and bad luck? Now they were claiming it was to protect the villagers?

"Our two leaders sympathize with you and have decided to collect the Night Silver next month, giving you time to prepare."

Undoubtedly, Golden Rooster Ridge's explanation was pale and powerless, causing even greater resentment among the villagers. In the end, they still planned to exploit every household; the protection tax could not be avoided. Many people wanted to fight them.

"These mud-footed commoners are reacting too strongly!" In the end, the Golden Rooster Ridge people quickly departed.

That day, Old Man Liu sent news: Golden Rooster Ridge showed no unusual activity. There was reliable information that only the two major bandits and their trusted aides were in the stronghold.

"Additionally, two itinerant merchants appeared in Silver Vine Town, bringing the latest news: Crimson Cloud City was going to change city lords. Although Ling Xu hadn't done anything wrong, he was being transferred to another city."

Qin Ming nodded upon hearing this. Now was a good time to act.

He murmured, "If a major organization suspects the Crimson Cloud City Lord colluded with strange beings to set a trap, they might also suspect local organizations of providing intelligence and cooperating. They can't touch Ling Xu, but surely they wouldn't dare not wipe out Golden Rooster Ridge?"

Then, he mused, "The two major bandits colluded with that mystic, and then the man who could turn into mist inexplicably died. Wouldn't his fellow disciples and elders suspect Golden Rooster Ridge?"

At this moment, the early part of the night had ended. Qin Ming immediately entered the mountain, changed into his armor, took his weapons, and hastened towards Golden Rooster Ridge, fifty li away!

The night was deep, and the journey was not short. Most people truly wouldn't dare to travel alone deep into the night.

In fact, Qin Ming did encounter an unexpected event. On his way, he was attacked. A strange beast, flowing with purple light, suddenly leaped out of the forest and charged towards him. Its head resembled a horse, but it was not a horse; its mouth full of sharp, snow-white fangs glinted with cold light, clearly a carnivorous beast. It had a tiger or leopard-like torso, but its four limbs were very long and ended in massive, heavy hooves.

Its silky fur shimmered with a faint purple glow, making it look magnificent. It soared into the air, its massive hooves striking towards Qin Ming's head.

"Violet Lightning Beast?" Qin Ming was surprised to encounter such a strange being. He had been asking Old Man Liu a lot about the strange beings in the mountains recently and knew about this creature.

The Violet Lightning Beast was a newly appeared strange being that had undergone three mutations. It ran like wind and lightning, even faster than creatures that had mutated four or five times.

It seemed startled and had escaped from the deep mountains. Upon seeing Qin Ming blocking its path, it immediately struck him with a hoof. If he didn't dodge, he'd be waiting to have his head burst open.

Qin Ming slightly shifted his body, evading the massive purple hoof, then quickly closed in, touching its glistening purple body.

The Violet Lightning Beast was startled. What kind of monster was this? How could a mere finger brush its fur and stick to it like a dog-skin plaster? Qin Ming's Heavenly Light Force's adherence property came into play. Once he made even slight contact, it couldn't escape. First, his fingertips, then his entire palm, firmly gripped the Violet Lightning Beast's fur. Finally, he directly mounted it.

"Don't cause trouble. Give me a ride!" Qin Ming said.

The Violet Lightning Beast was enraged. It was an extremely difficult strange being to tame. It tried to shake its head and tail, kicking its hind legs to throw him off. Qin Ming didn't waste words with it. With a *swish*, he drew his gleaming long saber and held it to its neck. If it didn't cooperate, he'd simply kill it. Its glowing purple mane swayed, many strands of it severed.

The Violet Lightning Beast's body tensed; it dared not cause trouble anymore. It glanced towards the depths of the mountains, then began to gallop furiously.

Under the deep night sky, Qin Ming rode atop the magnificent strange beast flowing with purple mist-like light, rapidly approaching Golden Rooster Ridge!
