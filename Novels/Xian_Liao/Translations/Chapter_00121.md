# Chapter 121: Five Years  

Five years passed in the blink of an eye.  

Beneath the great mulberry tree in Jiangzhou’s medicinal garden, Zhou Qing focused his attention on the "Nourishing Life Master" interface:  

**Cultivation Method**: Sacred Heart Art (Second Layer).  
**Realm**: Dao Furnace.  
**Divine Sense**: Late Foundation Establishment.  
**Five Organs Thunder**: Heart Fire Thunder (Proficient), Liver Wood Thunder (Proficient), Kidney Water Thunder (Novice).  
**Sword Dao**: Sword Qi Thunderclap. Mid-tier Artifact Refining (Novice). Mid-tier Alchemy (Novice).  
**Beast Taming**: Little Snake (Fourth-tier Demonic Beast). Soul Cultivation Spells: Soul Suppression, Soul Disruption.  
**Spells**: Frost Encompassing the World…  
**Unique Skills**: Threefold Primordial Qi…  
**Divine Abilities**: Truth-Seeing Eye (Second Layer), Azure Sun Spirit Flame (Skilled)…  
**Lifespan**: 400 years.  

Zhou Qing summarized his progress over the past five years. Two years ago, he had completed the cultivation of Liver Wood Thunder. Since then, he had spent the last two years on Kidney Water Thunder. However, he had yet to find a suitable spiritual item or elixir to aid in its cultivation, so progress had been slow.  

Fortunately, after reaching this stage in the Five Organs Thunder cultivation, the spiritual energy within Zhou Qing’s body had become far denser than the true essence of a mid-stage Dao Furnace or mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Moreover, as he progressed in Kidney Water Thunder, his spiritual energy began to liquefy.  

In truth, whether it was body cultivators at the Dao Furnace stage or qi cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage, their true essence would liquefy upon reaching this level. However, Zhou Qing’s spiritual energy only began showing signs of liquefaction after he started cultivating Kidney Water Thunder.  

For now, it could be considered as a mist-like state.  

Yet, the quality of Zhou Qing’s spiritual energy surpassed that of true essence or true qi at the same level.  

Additionally, Lin Wan’er’s talent in the *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture* was indeed as the Great Scholar had said—she possessed a "Miaoyin Body," making her exceptionally gifted in this path.  

As her cultivation of the *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture* deepened, Lin Wan’er’s qi refinement speed increased significantly with the aid of elixirs, reaching the level of an average qi cultivator in the Jingyang Dao Domain.  

If she were to master the "Earthly Melody" and "Heavenly Melody," her cultivation speed would improve even further.  

But what truly delighted Zhou Qing was that after he taught Lin Wan’er many classical zither pieces and suitable poems from his past life, her performances of them actually stimulated his divine sense. Over five years of accumulation, this helped Zhou Qing smoothly advance his divine sense to the level of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Among these pieces, one called *Clear Heart Universal Goodness Chant*, when played by Lin Wan’er, even affected the great mulberry tree, causing it to produce more mulberry dew than usual.  

At the same time, after Zhang Jingxiu successfully refined the great pine tree, each time he listened to Lin Wan’er play *Clear Heart Universal Goodness Chant* using the "Human Melody" from the *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture*, the demonic nature of his Seed Demon would significantly weaken. Immediately after listening, his demonic thoughts would nearly vanish.  

This made Zhou Qing realize that the combination of the *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture* and calming zither music was a crucial key to resolving the demonic afflictions of Seed Demon cultivators.  

However, as Zhang Jingxiu put it, listening once every two months was sufficient. Listening too frequently could lead to excessive dependency.  

Over the five years, Fushan and Xiao Ruowang also successively broke through to the Dao Furnace level.  

With the collective experience of four Dao Furnace experts, Zhou Qing and the others compiled a manual on the Dao Furnace realm, detailing all its intricacies and secrets.  

If more people broke through in the future, the manual could be further expanded.  

In truth, the most critical aspect of breaking through to the Dao Furnace realm was successfully enduring the heavenly thunder to become an innate expert. With the blood essence of a Foundation Establishment-level demonic beast, the Golden Pill, and insights from Jingyang Daoist’s Eight Trigrams diagram, success was almost guaranteed.  

Currently, the success rate for martial cultivators enduring the heavenly thunder was around fifty percent, and it was unlikely to improve further.  

This was partly because many, intimidated by the terror of the heavenly thunder, chose to give up. Otherwise, the success rate would be even lower.  

After all, now that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was recovering, many could choose to exchange for Qi Condensation Pills and Marrow Cleansing Pills to pursue the path of qi cultivation.  

Building a solid martial foundation before transitioning to qi cultivation and becoming a qi cultivator had become the mainstream path for outer disciples of the Dao Court.  

Zhi Shan, Zhi Jing, and other second-generation disciples of Qingfu Palace had chosen this path.  

Fushan couldn’t bear to let his four disciples risk enduring the heavenly thunder, as they were all quite old and their martial talent paled in comparison to Fusong’s.  

On the other hand, Feng Xiu unexpectedly became the champion of the first Martial Arts Tournament and successfully endured the heavenly thunder.  

Now, Feng Xiu and the former Black List’s top-ranked Fang Longyuan were the most promising innate experts to advance to the Dao Furnace realm after Xiao Ruowang.  

However, they were still far from reaching that level.  

Fang Longyuan had already joined the Dao Court, focusing on the *Bear Roar Golden Bell Scripture*.  

Feng Xiu, meanwhile, chose the most challenging *Heart Ape Heavenward Scripture*.  

Over the five years, Zhou Qing reorganized the Dao Court into five branches based on the five elements: Thick Earth, Divine Wood, Crimson Fire, Black Water, and Sharp Metal. These branches guarded the five directions of the mortal domain, clearing out the occasional appearances of demonic beasts, fiends, ghosts, and other anomalies in their respective regions.  

The leaders of the five branches were:  
- Thick Earth (Fusong)  
- Divine Wood (Fushan)  
- Crimson Fire (Zhang Jingxiu)  
- Black Water (Xiao Ruowang)  
- Sharp Metal (temporarily led by Yuan Mingyue; she would become the official leader upon reaching Foundation Establishment).  

However, Yuan Mingyue delegated the mundane affairs of the Sharp Metal branch to her father, Yuan Hua.  

As Zhou Qing’s only personal disciple, Yuan Mingyue held an exalted position within the Dao Court. Moreover, the construction of spirit-gathering arrays, mountain-protecting formations, and communication arrays for each branch’s headquarters fell to her. Though she had yet to reach Foundation Establishment, she played a pivotal role in the Dao Court’s development.  

Inner and outer disciples of the five branches were all subject to the Demon-Slaying Division’s assignments, which were also a key way to accumulate merit. This was especially true for the mortal domain’s seas, where many aquatic demonic beasts lurked, and even a few plant-based fiends had appeared near the coast.  

The intelligence division of the Demon-Slaying Division was overseen by Butcher Hu, while Blacksmith Hu had fathered several children over the years. Zhou Qing noticed that while none of his descendants possessed immortal physiques, their cultivation aptitudes were notably decent.  

Meanwhile, Prefect Feng and Jiangzhou’s garrison commander had also joined the Demon-Slaying Division’s upper echelons, receiving many elixirs. Living to a hundred would be effortless for them.  

However, as the Dao Court grew, the Demon-Slaying Division’s leadership would inevitably be replaced by capable Dao Court disciples.  

Although Fushan and the others were nominally the leaders of the five branches, their daily affairs were handled by their juniors like Zhi Shan. Their focus remained on cultivation, alchemy, or hunting in the Jingyang Dao Domain.  

With the Luopoling market in place, resources flowed in steadily. Zhou Qing treated hunting more as training.  

Fusong and the others took turns every six months to venture into the waters around the Water Manor, seeking battles with Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts to gain experience.  

After Zhang Jingxiu refined the great pine tree, it was transplanted to Luopoling to guard the market. Under Luo Xiangu’s explanation, the great pine tree was presented as the lifebound demon god of the market’s true master.  

Luopoling had originally been Qingmo Laoren’s territory, but now that it was occupied by another Seed Demon grand cultivator running an underground market, the rogue cultivators quickly adapted.  

Moreover, having an unfathomable Seed Demon grand cultivator as their patron made transactions feel safer.  

During this time, some rogue cultivators attempted to rob others outside the market, but Zhou Qing dealt with them swiftly and mercilessly, serving as a warning to others.  

After the incident with Huang Wenxiang, Zhou Qing had to admit that his own people were far more reliable. Petty men feared power, not virtue.  

Now that the Dao Court was on track, with four Dao Furnace cultivators like Old Zhang, more Dao Furnace and Foundation Establishment experts would emerge in the future.  

Trying to reform and recruit stubborn old-era cultivators like those from Tianxuan City was a waste of time and effort.  

Better to leave them be.  

The fate of humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain now hinged on two factors:  
1. Whether the Tianxuan Patriarch could break through to the Nascent Soul stage before his death.  
2. Whether Zhou Qing and the others—the hidden seeds preserved by Jingyang Zhenren in the mortal domain—could develop and eventually soar to greatness.  

For Zhou Qing, the strategy for the Jingyang Dao Domain boiled down to three principles:  
- **Build high walls**: The mortal domain had natural barriers, and the only entrance was controlled by Zhou Qing. Without his Qiankun Teleportation Token, no one could access the teleportation array leading to the mortal domain.  
- **Amass resources**: Continuously absorb resources from the Jingyang Dao Domain to develop the Dao Court and support his own cultivation.  
- **Bide time**: Maintain a low profile, act decisively when necessary, and leave no loose ends—all in preparation for eventual dominance over the Jingyang Dao Domain.  

The pursuit of the Dao was like fire, and life was the fuel.  

A single log could not sustain a blazing flame—it required many hands to feed it.  

In a way, Zhou Qing, who had embarked on the same Dao Furnace path as Jingyang Zhenren, was the seed left behind by the latter.  

It was this seed that ignited the flame of cultivation in the mortal domain, ushering in a new era.  

Zhou Qing cultivated steadily and methodically until he received a piece of news from Luo Xiangu and the others.  

---  

Over the past five years, Luo Xiangu and the other three had reached the ninth level of Qi Refinement through resources obtained from the market and elixirs provided by Zhou Qing.  

They were now qualified to attempt Foundation Establishment.  

They had also obtained Beast Core Foundation Pills refined by Zhou Qing, which used the core of a Foundation Establishment-level demonic beast as the main ingredient.  

The four of them had been fortunate—their main alchemical ingredient was the core of a fourth-tier demonic beast, equivalent to a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, which they had opportunistically slain during a beast tide.  

However, they planned to wait another year to stabilize their cultivation and gather more Foundation Establishment materials before attempting the breakthrough.  

Failing once would make subsequent attempts with the same method even less likely to succeed.  

While inquiring about Foundation Establishment materials, they learned that the Divine Water Palace was about to open. Inside, there was a spiritual item called "Heavenly Origin Divine Water," which greatly aided Foundation Establishment and even had some effect on advancing to Golden Core.  

The Divine Water Palace was an ancient legacy of the Jingyang Dao Domain, lost to time.  

Now a secret realm, it opened once every hundred years.  

Only cultivators below the Golden Core stage could enter.  

Moreover, to enter the Divine Water Palace after its opening, one needed a fragment of the "Black Water Divine Stele." With a stele fragment, one could teleport directly into the palace when it opened and return to the original location seven days later.  

Among the Jingyang Dao Domain’s aquatic realms, the Divine Water Palace was one of the most renowned.  

Over the past five hundred years, only a handful of cultivators or other beings had entered the palace’s inner sanctum during each opening. The Heavenly Origin Divine Water was one of the many treasures found near the outer sanctum of the inner palace.  

The Tianxuan Patriarch had once obtained the Heavenly Origin Divine Water.  

---  

After receiving this news, Zhou Qing retrieved the mysterious stele fragment he had obtained from Huang Wenxiang. It seemed this fragment was likely the key to entering the Divine Water Palace.  

The outer sanctum of the palace had once held many cultivation resources, but after centuries of exploration, they had been nearly exhausted.  

The inner sanctum, however, likely still preserved many spiritual treasures.  

At the very least, the Heavenly Origin Divine Water would still be there.  

The Heavenly Origin Divine Water was produced by a spiritual array within the palace, which would generate new supplies every hundred years.  

For Zhou Qing, who was cultivating Kidney Water Thunder, the Heavenly Origin Divine Water would be immensely beneficial.  

He wondered if his Truth-Seeing Eye could memorize the array that gathered the divine water. If so, Yuan Mingyue might be able to replicate it in the Water Manor.  

With the Heavenly Origin Divine Water, both his cultivation and the Dao Court’s efforts to nurture Foundation Establishment disciples would greatly benefit.  

"If this stele fragment is indeed part of the Black Water Divine Stele, then I’ll go," Zhou Qing decided.  

He kept the stele fragment on his person and focused on cultivating Kidney Water Thunder.  

As he progressed, the tiger煞 (sha) within him was gradually refined and purified.  

Zhou Qing carried a considerable amount of煞气 (killing intent).  

Eventually, this energy merged into the Green Bamboo Sword, transforming into sword煞.  

This further enhanced the sword’s power.  

Combined with his Sword Qi Thunderclap realm, the Green Bamboo Sword’s lethality was formidable. Zhou Qing had once effortlessly slain a mid-stage Foundation Establishment-level demonic beast with it.  

His physical defense was now comparable to a high-tier defensive artifact. Even if he did nothing, a Foundation Establishment cultivator would be unable to breach his defenses without a high-tier artifact.  

Still, Zhou Qing crafted a high-tier inner armor from the hide of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment demonic beast, modeled after Yuan Mingyue’s defensive robe.  

Refining high-tier artifacts also helped advance his artifact-crafting skills.  

Now, only high-tier artifacts or Golden Pill and Foundation Establishment-level elixirs could further his mastery in these arts.  

As Zhou Qing focused on refining sword煞, one day, the stele fragment on his person emitted a cool, refreshing aura.  

Zhou Qing’s heart stirred. "It’s time!"  

He gathered everything he needed, including fifty "Yi Wood Divine Thunder Talismans" and fifty "Bing Fire Divine Thunder Talismans"—the maximum number his divine sense could simultaneously activate.  

If he encountered a powerful enemy, unleashing a hundred divine thunder talismans at once would severely injure even a peak Foundation Establishment expert.  

This was the advantage of a powerful divine sense—an average mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator couldn’t possibly control so many talismans at once.  

With everything prepared, Zhou Qing left the Water Manor and traveled dozens of miles to a spot five hundred zhang deep in the sea.  

He channeled his spiritual energy into the cool stele fragment.  

In the next moment, his figure vanished from the spot.
