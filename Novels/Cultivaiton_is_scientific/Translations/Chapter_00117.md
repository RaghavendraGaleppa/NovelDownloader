# Chapter 117: Secret Technique  

"Thousand-Mile Sound Transmission Talisman!" Li Shiming finally understood how Ren Fei'er had sent him the records on modifying the corpse puppet. The 'Thousand-Mile Sound Transmission Talisman' wasn't limited to just a thousand miles—it was an extremely precious talisman capable of transmitting messages over vast distances.  

Ren Fei'er had actually used such a valuable talisman for something that wasn't particularly urgent.  

But since the talisman had already arrived, Li Shiming opened a small gap in the mountain-protecting formation, allowing the small bird to fly inside.  

The bird entered the cave dwelling and landed in front of Li Shiming. It spat out a small storage pouch before dissipating into nothingness.  

"Are they all this extravagant?" Li Shiming couldn't help but marvel as he looked at the storage pouch.  

This pouch was clearly custom-made, not one of the mass-produced standard versions. Regardless of its storage capacity, this pouch was undoubtedly expensive.  

Li Shiming picked it up, channeled his spiritual power into it, and sensed a jade slip, an array disk, and sixteen mid-grade spirit stones inside.  

"Big Brother, did you get it? I had to beg for a long time to get that array disk for you!" Ren Fei'er's voice came through the communication jade token, sounding proud of her accomplishment.  

"Fei'er, I got it. But this is too precious!" Li Shiming felt a pang of guilt.  

He had exchanged an LED lamp for the high-grade soul artifact, the Black Sparrow Wings, and now he was receiving even more gifts. It made him feel like he was taking advantage of a child.  

"Ah! Mother's coming, gotta go!" Ren Fei'er abruptly cut off the communication.  

Li Shiming first took out the jade slip and pressed it against his forehead. A stream of information entered his mind, simultaneously recorded by his IBMz15.  

The jade slip didn't contain simple records—it was a secret technique, one related to corpse puppets.  

This technique was specifically designed to repair corpse puppets. As long as the puppet's head remained intact, it could be restored using a corpse of equivalent strength.  

Of course, if such a technique existed but hadn't been widely circulated, there must be a reason.  

Li Shiming quickly discovered the reason: the technique required a formation called the Nether Ghost Realm Array. Only with this array as a foundation could the technique be applied to the corpse puppet.  

Moreover, the Nether Ghost Realm Array also enhanced the puppet. If a corpse puppet remained within it for an extended period, its growth would accelerate.  

The technique included the array diagram for the Nether Ghost Realm Array, but the real challenge wasn't setting it up—it was the array's core material: a third-grade spiritual material called Nether Crystal.  

Third-grade spiritual materials were resources typically only accessible to Golden Core elders.  

No wonder this technique hadn't spread. The rarity of Nether Crystal alone made it nearly impossible to disseminate.  

Li Shiming's expression changed as he picked up the array disk Ren Fei'er had sent. The disk was pitch-black, made from some kind of dark crystal.  

He stared at it in silence. Although he had saved Ren Fei'er's life, the gifts she had sent were far too valuable.  

This was a pre-made Nether Ghost Realm Array disk, meant to be used in conjunction with the secret technique.  

She had even included sixteen mid-grade spirit stones to power the array, likely aware that Li Shiming had no way of obtaining such resources himself.  

"Fei'er, did you steal this? Hurry up and come take it back!" After a moment of hesitation, Li Shiming sent a concerned message.  

A long while later, Ren Fei'er finally replied.  

"I've never stolen anything in my life! I got it from my uncle!" Her tone was indignant and slightly hurt.  

Li Shiming didn't know how to respond. He decided to ask her in person the next time they met.  

What he didn't know was that Ren Fei'er hadn't needed to steal anything. She had simply gone to her uncle—an elder of the Profound Nether Sect who specialized in corpse puppets—and pouted until he gave her an unused array disk.  

Li Shiming took the Nether Ghost Realm Array disk to the underground chamber. The Five Elements Array Flags he had previously crafted had already been nourished by the spiritual vein and were ready to be used. He set them up to create an isolated space where he could deploy the Nether Ghost Realm Array.  

The flags were planted near the spiritual spring, forming a confined area as spiritual power was channeled into them.  

After studying the secret technique, he knew that once the Nether Ghost Realm Array was activated, it would create a ghostly domain. While immensely beneficial to corpse puppets, it would negatively affect the surrounding environment.  

He didn't want the underground chamber to turn into a ghost domain—he still had other uses for the space, and it might disrupt the spawning of spirit fish.  

The Nether Ghost Realm Array disk was placed in the designated spot, and four mid-grade spirit stones were inserted to activate it according to the technique's instructions.  

Immediately, a thin black mist filled the air within the confined space. The temperature dropped to freezing, and a chilling spiritual energy—uncomfortable to Li Shiming—began to form.  

He summoned his bronze corpse puppet. As it stood within the ghostly domain, wisps of cold spiritual energy were absorbed into its body.  

Just this environment alone could replace a large amount of the materials needed to enhance the puppet.  

Considering that the Nether Ghost Realm Array was made from a third-grade spiritual material, Nether Crystal, it was no surprise that it could substitute for enhancement resources.  

In fact, the third-grade Nether Ghost Realm Array wasn't meant for Qi Refinement cultivators. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators—unless they were direct disciples of an elder—had no right to use it.  

If not for the fact that the elder's own corpse puppet had advanced to a level where the array no longer benefited it, Ren Fei'er wouldn't have been able to obtain it.  

Through the blood contract, Li Shiming sensed the puppet's condition. After staying in the ghostly domain for a month at most, it would advance by one level.  

This was a jump from the seventh to the eighth layer of Qi Refinement. Even with ample resources, a cultivator would need years of arduous cultivation to achieve such progress.  

Corpse puppets were naturally slow to improve—but only when resources were scarce. With abundant resources, like the third-grade materials now being used on a Qi Refinement puppet, the effects were astonishing.  

And this was just the basic benefit of the Nether Ghost Realm Array. The array had been developed specifically to work with the secret technique for modifying corpse puppets.  

Li Shiming decided to add a new research project to his list: how to modify the bronze corpse puppet to maximize its combat potential.  

He regretted that the Nether Ghost Realm Array took up too much space to be deployed inside the machine room dimension. Otherwise, he would have placed his doppelganger inside for enhancement.  

As long as the doppelganger was in its corpse puppet state, it could benefit from the same resources.  

However, after spending so many days in the machine room dimension, the doppelganger's aura had begun shifting toward Li Shiming's—whether due to his consciousness or the dimension's influence.  

Every individual had a unique life signature. The doppelganger had originally carried Bai Lijinyan's aura, but after about twenty days in the machine room dimension, that aura had faded, replaced by Li Shiming's.  

This was beneficial. Once the transformation was complete, with no trace of Bai Lijinyan remaining, he could safely summon the doppelganger into the real world.  

Then, it could use the Nether Ghost Realm Array to strengthen itself and provide Li Shiming with greater combat power.  

Of course, there was still one issue: the doppelganger's appearance.  

This wasn't a problem for Li Shiming. While the cultivation world had many disguise techniques, none could compare to the plastic surgery of his past life.  

Plastic surgery fundamentally altered facial structure—far surpassing temporary disguises.  

Cultivation disguises relied on spiritual power, making them detectable by stronger cultivators. The disparity between cultivation realms was stark, and high-level cultivators could easily see through low-level disguises.  

Plastic surgery, however, changed bone structure, facial muscles, skin, and even teeth—altering appearance naturally, without relying on spiritual power.  

Li Shiming spent some time studying the medical, cosmetic, and surgical knowledge stored in his IBMz15.  

Within the machine room dimension, his consciousness could operate at a micrometer level, and the sterile environment made it the perfect surgical setting.  

The doppelganger's physique meant it wouldn't be affected even if the surgery were performed in toxic conditions.  

It didn't take long for him to master the knowledge—just half an hour. In his past life, he would have been a leading expert in plastic surgery.  

With the IBMz15 feeding information directly into his brain and enhancing his learning speed, combined with a cultivator's superior memory and comprehension, his progress was unparalleled.  

Bai Lijinyan's original appearance was already handsome. Refining it required careful planning.  

Since the doppelganger was essentially himself, Li Shiming wanted its appearance to embody the pinnacle of masculine beauty.  

He referenced countless designs—historical, modern, and even fictional—then wrote an analysis program for the IBMz15 to generate the ideal face.  

After some time, the IBMz15 projected a three-dimensional facial model into his vision.  

Li Shiming was at a loss for words. The face was perfection—chiseled nose, full lips, sharp brows, radiant eyes, and flawless skin. It was a face that shouldn't exist in the mortal world.  

He could already imagine the reactions: men would despise it (+10 hostility), while women would be irresistibly drawn to it (+100 affinity).  

"This is the one!" Cultivation was about freedom. If he couldn't even decide his doppelganger's appearance, he might as well return to the mortal world and become an official.  

But the first obstacle arose immediately. The doppelganger practiced the *Sword Demon Secret Canon*—a peerless offensive and body-refining technique.  

Li Shiming's Azure Kite Wooden Sword couldn't even pierce the doppelganger's skin, even with spiritual power infused.  

An upper-grade sword couldn't scratch it. It was a testament to Bai Lijinyan's terrifying strength.  

In the end, he had to use the doppelganger's sword foundation—a third-grade metal weapon on par with a Golden Core elder's—to perform the surgery.  

Under his micrometer-level control, the sword foundation executed the most precise surgery possible in any world.  

The IBMz15's facial model was equally precise, ensuring a perfect reconstruction.  

The third-grade sword foundation made light work of the procedure—slicing skin, reshaping bone, and adjusting muscle with effortless precision.  

An unprecedented surgery unfolded within the machine room dimension.  

Li Shiming himself practiced body-refining techniques and understood their benefits. A top-tier refined body could heal minor injuries quickly, leaving no scars.  

The doppelganger's facial bones were reshaped, its muscles subtly adjusted, and its eyes enlarged.  

When the surgery concluded, no bandages or medicine were needed.  

Within ten minutes, all traces of the procedure vanished, revealing the face designed by the IBMz15.  

Even though he had created it himself, Li Shiming was momentarily breathless at the sight.  

He suspected that if the doppelganger faced a female cultivator, its mere appearance would leave her unable to strike.  

Against male cultivators, the momentary shock would grant the doppelganger the first-move advantage.  

Still, it might be best to equip the doppelganger with a mask, preserving the element of surprise.  

Once its aura fully transformed, even if it stood before Bai Lijinyan's father—a Saint Ice Sect elder—he wouldn't recognize it.  

"When will I get to learn the *Sword Demon Secret Canon*?" Li Shiming muttered enviously as he gazed at the doppelganger.  

It wasn't that the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Art* was lacking—it was just that the *Sword Demon Secret Canon* was *that* good.  

The *Sword Demon Secret Canon* wasn't purely a body-refining technique—that was just one aspect. Most importantly, it didn't conflict with other body-refining techniques like the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Art*.  

Of course, after training in the *Sword Demon Secret Canon*, the body reached such an extreme level of refinement that further enhancements from other techniques would be minimal.  

Without third-grade metal, Li Shiming couldn't practice the *Sword Demon Secret Canon*. He could only watch in envy.  

An upper-grade sword couldn't pierce the doppelganger's undefended skin. How long would it take the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Art* to reach such a level?
