# Chapter 22: Thousand Treasures Peak  

"Fifteen spirit stones!"  

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yan felt delighted but pretended to hesitate for a moment before slowly replying, "Alright, let's go with what you suggested, senior brother."  

After handing over the spirit stones, both parties were satisfied—one had sold useless scrap, while the other had obtained a rare treasure.  

With this mask in hand, Zhang Yan was already very pleased with this trip.  

It was worth the journey!  

"I still have quite a few spirit stones left. Should I buy some medicinal herbs?"  

Zhang Yan hesitated but ultimately decided against it. The main reason was that Elder Bai had already given him a bottle of Qi Gathering Pills.  

Moreover, his alchemy skills were only at a beginner level, and the success rate wasn't guaranteed. There was a risk of spending money on refining pills only to not recoup the cost.  

"I'm still short on money!" Zhang Yan sighed deeply. The cost of refining a single batch of pills was too high, and since he didn't have a fire spiritual root or know any fire-based spells, he would need special spirit charcoal or earthfire to refine pills.  

Both of these resources were quite conspicuous and could easily draw attention.  

He just wanted to quietly farm, cultivate, and be an inconspicuous little genius—he didn’t want to stand out too much.  

The sect's market was simply too small.  

In less than half an hour, Zhang Yan had already browsed through most of it. Aside from purchasing the Mask of Concealment, he hadn't bought anything else.  

Earning spirit stones wasn’t easy.  

He needed to be frugal.  

"Time to leave," he thought, but just as he was about to go, his eyes landed on a stall selling a magical artifact—a hammer-like weapon.  

**[Violet Spirit Hammer]**  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Equipment Attributes]:** Armor Penetration (increased damage against armor), Great Strength (enhanced physical power)  

"Oh?"  

"This artifact..."  

Seeing its attributes, Zhang Yan's eyes lit up.  

He immediately stepped forward to inquire.  

"Senior brother, how much for this artifact?"  

"The Violet Spirit Hammer is forged from Purple Cloud Stone and Spirit Iron. It's incredibly powerful—just 150 spirit stones."  

"So expensive?"  

Zhang Yan winced.  

Having grown accustomed to bargain hunting, he found the price of a normal artifact shockingly high.  

But in reality, this was the standard price for such artifacts.  

"Can't be helped. This artifact required a lot of Purple Cloud Stone and Spirit Iron during forging. The material cost alone was at least 110 spirit stones, and with the artificer's labor fee, there's really not much profit left."  

The stall owner's tone carried a hint of helplessness.  

"Alright..."  

Zhang Yan hesitated for a long time but ultimately couldn't bring himself to make the purchase.  

---

This price was simply too steep!  

"This artifact is a bit too expensive for me. Senior brother, do you have any second-hand artifacts for sale? Even damaged ones would do." Zhang Yan smiled as he asked.  

"Second-hand artifacts?  

Damaged ones are fine too?"  

The stall owner, a middle-aged man in his forties or fifties, studied Zhang Yan thoughtfully before finally replying after a long pause, "I do have some, but I can't guarantee their quality."  

"That's fine. As long as they're artifacts, it's good enough. I just want to learn more about them." Zhang Yan quickly waved his hand. He didn’t care about the artifact's quality—only the attributes it carried.  

"Learn more about artifacts...  

What, little brother, are you trying to become an artificer?" The middle-aged stall owner chuckled.  

As one of the four great arts, artificing naturally attracted many aspiring learners.  

But artificing was far from easy.  

Out of thousands—or even tens of thousands—only one might succeed. It was no exaggeration to say that becoming an artificer guaranteed respect and hospitality wherever one went.  

Of course, a newly initiated artificer wouldn’t be treated as such in a sect with Nascent Soul cultivators.  

"You flatter me." Zhang Yan gave an embarrassed smile.  

"No need to be modest. I can't help you become an artificer, but if you just want to examine discarded artifacts, I might be able to assist." The stall owner flashed a mysterious smile.  

"Oh?  

What do you mean, senior brother?" Zhang Yan's eyes brightened at the mention of discarded artifacts.  

"Here's the thing—you might have noticed that most of the artifacts I sell come from Thousand Treasures Peak."  

"Indeed, these are all artifacts from Thousand Treasures Peak." Zhang Yan nodded as he looked over the various artifacts on display. As one of the five peaks of the Qingheng Sect, Thousand Treasures Peak imprinted its artifacts with special marks—even the artificer's name—to ensure accountability if issues arose.  

It also helped build reputation when an artifact gained fame.  

However, Thousand Treasures Peak's artifacts were notoriously difficult to obtain. The fact that this stall owner had access to them suggested he had some connections.  

"Here's the deal—Thousand Treasures Peak collects many discarded artifacts and needs disciples to help sort them for material extraction later. If you're interested, I can introduce you."  

As he spoke, the stall owner rubbed his thumb and forefinger together subtly.  

"Senior brother, I'll take this artifact."  

Seeing the hint for a bribe, Zhang Yan didn't offer money outright but instead purchased the Violet Spirit Hammer.  

---

"Excellent! Junior brother, you’re decisive!"  

"I'll arrange it for you right away!" The stall owner grinned and immediately took out his sect jade token to make the necessary connections.  

In truth, these tasks assigned by Thousand Treasures Peak didn’t require any special connections—most disciples simply weren’t aware of them.  

This stall owner was profiting from an information gap.  

Zhang Yan understood this perfectly but didn’t mind. After all, information asymmetry was one of the most valuable resources.  

In less than half an incense stick’s time, the stall owner smiled and said, "Junior brother, it’s all arranged. Just report to Thousand Treasures Peak and mention that Hou Jiu from the market sent you."  

"Thank you, senior brother!"  

Zhang Yan nodded in satisfaction before leaving.  

Soon, riding his Golden Bamboo Sword, Zhang Yan leisurely flew toward Thousand Treasures Peak.  

Since Thousand Treasures Peak was part of the inner sect, he dismounted his sword from a distance and proceeded on foot.  

At the mountain gate stood a bustling building crowded with people—mostly those looking to purchase or commission artifacts.  

As soon as Zhang Yan arrived, someone came forward to maintain order and assist.  

"Junior brother, are you here to buy ready-made artifacts or commission a custom one?" A beautiful female cultivator greeted him with a smile.  

"Senior sister, I was referred by Hou Jiu from the market for the task of sorting discarded artifacts," Zhang Yan replied politely, sensing that the woman was at least at the mid-stage of Qi Refining.  

"Senior Brother Hou?"  

"Sorting discarded artifacts?" The female cultivator’s tone cooled slightly as she glanced at him. "Follow me, junior brother. I’ll take you to the manager."  

"Thank you, senior sister!"  

Zhang Yan nodded and followed her into Thousand Treasures Peak.
