## 15. The Song of Medicinal Brews

Although Doctor Mo had walked far away, Li Zhiming still couldn't help but see a faint azure aura rise above his head. He was stunned for a moment, and soon, this azure aura transformed into a line of text:

Light azure, [Fate-pattern: Homeland Overlord]

Li Zhiming hadn't fully made it out before Doctor Mo, with his hands behind his back, vanished around the bend in the valley.

"What are you looking at?" Beside him, Han Li lightly nudged his companion. He pursed his lips, holding the yellowed booklet, sighing deeply. His tanned face was filled with gloom. "Master gave me this; it's so hard to memorize."

"Ah, nothing." Li Zhiming shook his head, quickly retracting his gaze. Looking back at the book in Han Li's hand, he couldn't help but smile. He himself loved to read, while Han Li dreaded it to death.

"Just think, which is harder: memorizing this, or practicing martial arts outside?"

At this, Li Zhiming couldn't help but think of poor Big Niu. How was Big Niu doing these days? That bamboo forest must be difficult to climb. Was he covered in cuts and bruises, crying again? Thinking of this, Li Zhiming felt a pang of sympathy for his little friend.

But Han Li couldn't smile. He just clutched the medical booklet to his chest, his expression gradually growing more serious. He had worked so hard to stay here and didn't want to be eventually driven out by Doctor Mo. He was also someone unwilling to easily accept his fate.

"I'm heading back first," he muttered, lowering his head and quickening his pace towards the house, intending to go back and study hard.

Homeland Overlord?

Han Li left, and young Li Zhiming finally began to confusedly recall what he had seen earlier. However, he quickly dismissed the term he couldn't yet understand. Doctor Mo actually had a fate-pattern the same color as the county magistrate and those immortal lords.

"Ma Huang Tang contains Gui Zhi, Xing Ren, Gan Cao, all four are used; for fever, chills, head and neck pain, wheezing without sweat, it's suitable to take."

"...San Ao Tang uses Ma Huang, Xing Ren, and Gan Cao, to disperse lung qi and calm wheezing effectively... effectively..."

Night had fallen, and a dim oil lamp still flickered in the wood yard. It had to be said that Doctor Mo's conditions were excellent. At home, his parents wouldn't even bear to light a single oil lamp, knowing its immense value! But here, even their rooms as young apprentices had oil lamps, and senior disciples would come every few days to replace them and deliver many supplies.

Listening to his companion, Han Li, stammering through his memorization inside the room, Li Zhiming felt deep sympathy for him. He himself had learned decades of messy pharmacological knowledge from the barefoot doctor, sparing him Han Li's hardship.

Otherwise, he'd be suffering too!

Sitting by the door, fiddling with a twig, watching the fluffy, curled-up Paopao, whose mouth was tightly bound, and then gazing at the twinkling stars above, Li Zhiming once again felt a melancholy beyond his years, pondering life.

Life in the valley had become very monotonous. Li Zhiming's work tending the medicinal fields was much easier than Han Li's. Although the medicinal fields were vast, it was just manual labor, and Doctor Mo never seemed to rush his progress. The fields were filled with spiritual herbs. Simply weeding and catching insects passed the day. Doctor Mo often left the valley and didn't return much, but Li Zhiming didn't dare to sneak out of the valley to play either.

Thus, after half a month of living together, Han Li was still the same as before. Following his deep red fate-pattern were the words 'Excessive Vigilance', suggesting a natural guardedness towards everyone. This frustrated Li Zhiming; he still wanted to learn the spiritual root for cultivation from him, but Han Li gave him no opportunity whatsoever. Trust and wariness seemed to form a contradictory union in this fellow, but Li Zhiming wasn't worried; he still had enough time to spend with him.

Yet, as night descended, Li Zhiming ultimately once again lamented the unfairness of fate.

Han Li was diligently memorizing the Medicinal Brews Song, a tenacious stubbornness seemingly ingrained in his bones. But Li Zhiming despairingly discovered that after half a month, Han Li still hadn't memorized it, yet he himself, simply by casually listening from the side, had already memorized it! This made Li Zhiming once more doubt the fairness and unfairness of fate. No, why was it like this? Why would such a diligent Han Li ultimately have a red fate-pattern, while he himself started with a black fate, and even after all this effort, was still only white?

Li Zhiming began to feel discouraged.

But this discouragement only flashed through Li Zhiming's mind for a second.

"Da Yuan Yin uses Pu, Bing, Qin, Bai Shao, Gan Zhi Cao..." Inside the room, Han Li's face was etched with pain. It really wasn't his fault; the Medicinal Brews Song was over ten thousand characters long, filled with obscure terms. Not only was he illiterate, but he also didn't understand the meaning of the verses! Yet, by sheer rote memorization, he had already memorized over four thousand characters in half a month, which was truly remarkable! One must know that the *Three Character Classic*, though long, was only two thousand characters in its entirety. The *Hundred Family Surnames* was no more than five hundred characters.

But even with such immense effort, counting the time, he was still quite a ways off from the final deadline Doctor Mo had given him! Thus, Han Li was truly starting to get anxious. He was stuck again in his memorization. Although he had the book in his hand, the book recognized him, but he didn't recognize the book.

Now, trying to continue memorizing, he had no idea how. According to his usual habit, he would have to wait until Doctor Mo woke up tomorrow, then go early to wait by his side and ask for guidance. But asking repeatedly meant another beating on the palm from Doctor Mo.

Han Li took a deep breath. He wasn't afraid of being hit and decided to consult Doctor Mo tomorrow. However, he still needed to consolidate the four thousand characters from the earlier parts tonight. As he was thinking this, someone beside him helped him recall, "It's 'Bai Shao, Gan Zhi, Cao Guo, and Bing; when evil qi lies hidden in the membrane and causes hot and cold, this formula dispels evil and expels filth.'"

This person not only recited it but also explained it to him. "This sentence means that Da Yuan Yin is the name of a prescription. Take it for symptoms of hot and cold from trapped evil. The medicinal ingredients it uses are Magnolia Bark, Areca Seed, Scutellaria Root, White Peony Root, Licorice Root, Anemarrhena Rhizome, and Cardamom."

"You just need to remember that these characters, broken down, refer to these specific herbs."

Seeing Han Li turn his head to him in astonishment, Li Zhiming himself felt a little embarrassed, scratching his head while sitting on the threshold. "I've memorized this before."

Han Li thought carefully. It might be true. This Medicinal Brews Song was the most basic entry-level knowledge for physicians. And looking at Li Zhiming's intelligence, he was far more skilled at entry than himself. So, his claim of having memorized the Medicinal Brews Song was quite reasonable.

In truth, the barefoot doctor himself hadn't even memorized it, so how could Li Zhiming know anything? He had purely memorized it these past few days by listening to Han Li endlessly repeat it from beginning to end, his ears developing calluses, and just hard-wiring it into his memory!

Li Zhiming quickly reviewed the more than ten thousand characters he had heard Han Li recite, confirming that he remembered most of them. He then said to Han Li, "It's fine, I'll teach you these next few days!"

Han Li was almost moved to tears. His companion was truly kind!

That night, Li Zhiming began to give Han Li private tutoring, explaining and lecturing each sentence using his own understanding and what he had secretly overheard from Han Li. Han Li wasn't truly a foolish person. With Li Zhiming explaining the text and analyzing the meaning sentence by sentence, Han Li's comprehension progressed by leaps and bounds! And in this process, Li Zhiming finally discovered Han Li's strong point. This kid was truly desperate; he memorized day and night without rest. With Li Zhiming's private tutoring, by the twenty-fifth day, he had the Medicinal Brews Song memorized perfectly.

Thus, after passing Doctor Mo's assessment, he was successfully kept on.

A month had passed. Doctor Mo sat in his grand armchair, toying with an ink-colored thumb ring, looking at the two earnest boys before him. "Consider this test passed for now. From now on, follow me and study diligently. Remember, there's no need to envy those who wield swords and spears outside."

"In due time, when your bodies grow a little stronger, I, your master, will naturally impart some techniques to you."

"Yes!" Li Zhiming and Han Li nodded in unison.

A slow smile spread across Doctor Mo's corpse-like face. His gaze swept from Li Zhiming to Han Li, as if appraising valuable objects. The two children felt a slight prickle on their scalps under his scrutinizing gaze.

"In the future, you will come to know that coming to my valley was a good thing," Doctor Mo said lightly, his tone returning to normal.
