# Chapter 499: The Kingdom of Buddha on Earth

This scripture is essentially the Bodhisattva Miaodi’s analysis of the essence of the *True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture*, incorporating the protective intent of the Vajra Kings of Buddhism. It was created specifically to suit this body’s Buddhist martial arts bones.

It could be said to be a supreme battle scripture tailored for Wukong, and it even carries the牵引 of the Buddha Fruit Position of the Great Compassionate Radiant Lotus Supreme Sovereign King.

As Sanzang guided it with his thoughts, a silent Buddhist chant entered Wukong’s spiritual sea directly: “This scripture is reborn from the *True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture*. It transforms the Black Tortoise into the King of Vajra who Guards the Hell, and turns ‘Subduing Demons’ into ‘Battling the Tathagata.’ It does not emphasize external appearances; it only cultivates the immovable Vajra intent of the original heart and the power to destroy evil spirits.”

Although Sanzang currently lacks Buddhist power, his understanding of the佛法 is profound. With the heart-to-heart transmission, the true meaning of the scripture washed over Wukong’s mind like a sudden enlightenment, vast and mighty.

Whether it was the Vajra巨力 of the “Twelve Layers of Buddhist Power Golden Bell,” the mountain-shattering destructive power of the “Tathagata Palm,” or the spark of Nirvana Buddhist Karma fire ignited in his heart that could purify everything, it all made his blood boil. The hidden brute force and Dao resonance within his body found the most perfect outlet.

He felt an unprecedented sense of power and a clear Dao path right before his eyes.

“Disciple… understands!”

Wukong was激动难以耐, bowing to Sanzang once again, his red crystal eyes burning with the light of battle. “Thank you, Master, for transmitting the scripture!”

Sanzang smiled and nodded, his gaze once again falling upon the endless Eastern Wasteland shrouded in妖氛, his voice grand and compassionate.

“Disciple Wukong, now that you have obtained the Dharma and the treasure, you should understand what the Great Dao is.

“Your Master has made a great vow to travel the tens of millions of miles of the Eastern Wasteland, to subdue demons and tame beasts, to sow the seeds of compassion, to spread the supreme true scripture, to cleanse this land of evil spirits and ghostly domains, to establish a Pure Land Kingdom of Buddha on Earth, and to welcome the descent of the Buddha Fruit Position of the Great Compassionate Radiant Lotus Supreme Sovereign King.

“This is immeasurable merit, but also immeasurable danger.

“Are you willing to walk with your Master, to trample upon mountains and rivers, and to protect the Buddhist light with your body as a battle guardian?”

Although Wukong had just opened his spiritual intelligence, his bloodline was naturally branded with a loathing for demonic aura and endless trust in Sanzang.

Hearing his Master’s grand vow, he felt a surge of热血冲顶, as if he was born for this very purpose.

He did not hesitate. Holding the Purple Gold Bridge-Supporting Staff, his golden armor shining brilliantly, he raised his head and puffed out his chest. His voice was young but firm.

“Disciple Wukong is willing to accompany the Master. To battle the hordes of demons and protect the true scripture! As long as the demons are not eradicated, this heart shall never rest!”

A young monkey was born; the golden armor reflected the sun; the purple staff shook the mountains.

The monk’s robes were stained with blood; the mortal body stumbled; the Buddhist heart was like bedrock.

***

When Xu Yunfan’s figure was thrown by Lu Chunyang out of the Wansheng Sword Sect’s mountain protection array and disappeared into the vast sea of clouds, deep within the twelve heaven-propping sword peaks of the Wansheng Sword Sect, several overwhelmingly powerful spiritual senses intertwined and collided. Cold sword intent ripples stirred barely perceptible waves in the void.

Inside the Dongxu Hall on Qixia Peak, Zhenjun Qixia’s voice pierced through the void barrier, carrying a bone-deep chill.

“Hmph! Lu Chunyang, you actually colluded with that Xu Yunfan of the Yuan Demon Sect. That小子 is entangled with Buddhist great powers, bears unclear karmic connections to the Dao of Demons, and his aura is mixed and unclear.

“You dared to meet him privately and even passed down three Golden Core sword intents? The Wansheng Sword Sect is an orthodox sect of the Xuanmen; slaying demons and eliminating evil is a universal principle. Associating with such filthy scum is simply unworthy of being a human.

“What are you doing, placing the sect’s reputation in such a position?! This Seat wishes to ask you, what is your intention?!”

His spiritual sense surged like a sword breaking through the air, filled with interrogation and anger.

However, the response to Zhenjun Qixia was not Lu Chunyang himself, but a brief, suffocating silence.

That silence was like an invisible abyss of cold, instantly dissolving Zhenjun Qixia’s aggressive momentum.

“Heh…”

A plain as water, yet even more indifferent spiritual sense drifted slowly from the direction of Tianji Peak. It was the True Lord Tongxuan of the Tianji Xuan枢 Sword Soul.

“Zhenjun Qixia, what a great temper. Xu Yunfan came to the mountain to pay respects; it was merely a normal transmission and visitation procedure by the junior generation, not some sneaking around. Senior Brother Lu has his reasons for seeing him.”

Zhenjun Qixia’s spiritual sense stagnated, and his anger flared even hotter. “What reasons?! You are a Tongxuan Dao Lord, you should be even more clear about right and wrong. Lu Chunyang disregards the sect’s reputation, associating with that junior who is entangled in the karma of Buddhism and Demons…”

“Enough.”

An ancient and weary voice, as if carrying the chill of eternal ancient ice, came from the most ancient North Pole Peak. It was the True Lord Zhengdao of the North Pole Eternal Ancient Light, who was often in seclusion.

His spiritual sense seemed capable of freezing the void. “Zhenjun Qixia, what is the use of shouting here? If you think Lu Chunyang is wrong, why don’t you go to his Dongxu Heavenly Realm personally and interrogate him face to face? Making a racket here is just asking for ridicule.”

As soon as these words were spoken, the spiritual sense fluctuations in the void clearly stagnated.

Zhenjun Qixia’s spiritual sense was like it had been struck by an invisible giant hammer; his momentum suddenly shrank, and the激愤的意念 seemed to jam instantly, lacking follow-up strength.

He wanted to say something, but couldn't squeeze out a single word.

That’s right, interrogation?

Who goes?

Who can go?

If he could beat the other party, he wouldn't be shouting here in the first place. This was clearly setting him up for a fall.

But True Lord North Pole had a terrifying seniority, and was even suspected to have stepped into the realm of a Great True Lord.

Late stage Golden Core!

After a brief cold silence, another somewhat playful spiritual sense rose from Yuheng Peak, carrying a barely audible sneer. “Zhenjun Qixia’s sincere heart can be seen by the sun and moon.

However… Senior Brother North Pole is right. Since you are so furious right now, why not go directly to Senior Brother Lu and ask for a clear explanation? We can also listen to the high opinions of you two.”

This seemed to mediate, but every word was a heart-piercing blow.

Zhenjun Qixia’s spiritual sense was completely frozen, as if locked by ice.

Go to the Dongxu Heavenly Realm? Face Lu Chunyang, who has twelve supreme sword intents within his heavenly realm?

He could even feel a very obscure, yet omnipresent gaze seeming to pierce through layers of space and land on his Qixia Peak. It was the indifferent gaze of Lu Chunyang from the Dongxu Heavenly Realm.

A clown.

Zhenjun Qixia was furious, but that was all he could do.

He dared to be angry but dared not speak.

If he really went to Chunyang Peak to interrogate him, Lu Chunyang would likely not hesitate to give him a sword.

Just the sweep of the other party’s intent made Zhenjun Qixia’s natal spirit treasure sword instinctively feel a chill and a warning.

Throughout the Wansheng Sword Sect, who didn't know Lu Chunyang's sword intent?

His sword Dao sharpness was the best among the mid-stage Golden Core; no one dared to face its锋芒!

Otherwise, how could the Wansheng Sword Sect have developed and grown to this day after the Sect Master went into seclusion.

The one who had shouted the loudest just now, Zhenjun Qixia, now felt a chill rising from the bottom of his heart. His righteous indignation just now seemed to have become a huge joke.

He was silent for a few breaths. The anger in his spiritual sense finally turned into an irrepressible dejection and a hint of fear. In the end, he extinguished his momentum like a deflated leather ball, letting out a heavy “humph.”

With forced anger and unwilling concession: “Lu Chunyang… won’t be得意 for long. He is only in the mid-stage of Golden Core now.

“Daydreaming about achieving the position of a Great True Lord in the late stage of Golden Core?

“A pipe dream!

“The heavenly positions in the灵界 of Taihua are limited. The twelve sword Dao positions in our sect have long been locked by fellow sect members with their natal sword domains.”
