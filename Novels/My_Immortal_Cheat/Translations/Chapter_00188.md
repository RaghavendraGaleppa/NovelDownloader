Chapter 188: Ganging Up

"Help you? Who can help you?!" Yuan Chi's voice, muffled and indistinct, came from within the furnace. "Do you expect that mortal to help you? Just turn to ashes obediently!"

The remaining people also looked confused. Who was he calling out to? They then looked at Huang Qi, as he was the only one who had made a deal with the Saint Devil just moments ago. Huang Qi shrugged. He wouldn't go; he hadn't agreed to help him. It would be better if he died, as then he could contend for the World Origin.

Just then, a voice echoed between heaven and earth: "Little brother, your big brother has arrived!"

Boom!

A boundless might enveloped everyone. All felt a crushing pressure. Under their disbelieving gazes, Zhou Tian's body shone brilliantly, his eyes glinting with golden light, as he soared into the sky. He clenched his fists, enveloped them in Extreme Yin Heavy Water, and slammed them fiercely onto the black furnace.

Dong! Dong!

A dull thud resonated. The furnace was battered, dented, and on the verge of exploding.

"Did I see that right?" The Arm-Reaching Golden Ape rubbed his fiery pupils with his furry paw, feeling as if his innate divine ability might have misjudged the situation. Huang Qi's eyes flickered, recalling the vow he had just made, feeling thoroughly duped.

Bang!

The black furnace shattered, then reformed into a stone stele. Yuan Chi's figure reappeared, his face grim and pale, his aura weak. World Fire was a forbidden art; though powerful, it consumed his vital essence, energy, and spirit, leaving him in a terrible state. The Saint Devil also appeared, his expression equally grim.

"Go! Kill him!" Zhou Tian shouted, intending to join forces with the Saint Devil to eliminate Yuan Chi. The Saint Devil nodded. Though in a poor state, he could still manage to fight.

"To think I misjudged you, very well." Yuan Chi laughed in his fury. "But if you think that's enough to kill me, you're far from it! Let me show you the might of our Abyss Tomb Clan! Realm Birth, Realm Destruction; Life and Death Reversal; Illusion and Reality Cycle!"

Yuan Chi's cold voice resonated. At this moment, a great burst of darkness erupted from around his body, becoming dazzling, resplendent, and sacred. His aura suddenly grew extraordinarily strong, imbued with dark energy, like a collapsing cosmos, roaring. Fragments of order danced, and divine chains of principles intertwined, creating a terrifying sight.

With a crash, he struck mid-air. A dazzling light streaked across the entire battlefield, as if a demonic blade was about to cleave through the void. This was his right palm, surging with immense energy, slashing towards the Saint Devil's head. His left hand formed a fist seal, and between his palm and fingers, a true dragon materialized, howling, its roar shaking the nine heavens, as it blasted towards Zhou Tian. His feet also stomped through the air, black light surging, making the entire earth tremble violently under the pressure.

This instantaneous transformation caught everyone off guard. The seemingly weakened Yuan Chi had returned to his peak state.

"This is his innate divine ability," the Saint Devil said solemnly. Golden light burst from around him, a Golden Saint Lotus covering his entire body. He too surged forward instantly, like a golden divine sea boiling, raising monstrous waves that swept across the heavens and earth.

Rumble!

"Then we'll cripple him again! Let's see how many times he can use it!" Zhou Tian's hands traced paths of the Dao, as thunder and flames evolved. Fragments of principles emerged, glittering and brilliant, like countless resplendent flower buds blooming, then unleashing destructive power.

In mid-air, the three collided. Fist imprints, palm strikes, legs, and even their gazes were deadly weapons. Energy surged from every pore of their bodies, dazzlingly. When the three met, it was like three great suns colliding! The void roared, the earth trembled, and golden and black light raged, submerging the area, sending shattering rocks and dispersing clouds.

For a time, the three engaged in a fierce battle, swallowed by the light. They were as fast as lightning, their fist imprints clashing with secret techniques, thunder confronting darkness. One moment, darkness consumed the golden lotus; the next, thunder shattered the darkness. The intensity was extreme, like a starry river shaking violently.

In the end, all the Heavenly Kings watched in a daze. That area subtly resembled a pouring starry river, swirling, then exploding. Their speed was too fast; no one knew how many times they had struck. Collisions followed one after another, ringing out with clangs. Stone tablet shadows, thunder, and fist lights howled, as if tearing apart heaven and earth in their fierce struggle.

Bang!

Finally, all three were sent tumbling backwards, their bodies swaying, before they fell to the ground, all covered in blood, all injured. Zhou Tian wiped a streak of blood from the corner of his mouth, surprised by Yuan Chi's formidable power. Yuan Chi panted heavily, his face extremely grim. Zhou Tian's sudden intervention was completely unexpected. In the fierce battle, his right chest had taken a palm strike from the Saint Devil, which had ripped open his battle attire, cut through his flesh, exposing bloody bones.

The Saint Devil was also in a bad state, his body swaying unstably. His chest was caved in, a deep hollow where Yuan Chi's fist had struck, and half his body was covered in blood. He had already been injured by the World Fire, and now his injuries were compounded. However, Yuan Chi was ultimately more severely wounded. He had fought one against two. Although the Saint Devil was heavily injured, he was still a Dao Master, and under the pincer attack of both, Yuan Chi's recently recovered body became weak once more.

Before he could get any breathing room, Zhou Tian and the Saint Devil closed in again. Rumble! A dazzling bolt of thunder erupted. Amidst the lightning, countless silver serpents danced wildly, shaking the void with roars. The Saint Devil took a heavy blow, his armor directly exploding. Various metal fragments scattered, shimmering in mid-air like a disintegrating galaxy passing through the area.

Huang Qi glanced at the World Origin, which was sealed by only the last golden rune chain, and spoke pointedly: "Alas, with two Dao Masters attacking, once Yuan Chi dies, the World Origin will probably become theirs. It's a pity I can't intervene anymore."

Not many Heavenly Kings remained: the Four Heavenly Evolution Dragons, the Arm-Reaching Golden Ape, and two figures enveloped in runes. Hearing Huang Qi's words, their expressions all darkened. When the Saint Devil and Yuan Chi fought one-on-one, they were happy to see both sides suffer. But now, with Zhou Tian and the Saint Devil fighting two against one, it was a different story. Indeed, as Huang Qi said, no one could stop two Dao Masters; even combined, they couldn't.

"Earth!"
"Wind!"
"Water!"
"Fire!"
"With the Four Extremes as foundation, Yin and Yang reverse!"

The Four Heavenly Evolution Dragons were the first to act. This place was originally opened by them, and they were unwilling to return empty-handed. Four large banners flapped loudly, then merged. A colossal Yin-Yang diagram materialized behind them. The diagram was truly massive, standing behind the Four Heavenly Evolution Dragons, as if mountains and seas were collapsing the sky, sweeping up, dispersing clouds, vast and boundless.

Then, the Arm-Reaching Golden Ape also made his move. He took out a drop of purple-gold blood and dropped it into his mouth. His body rapidly swelled, quickly becoming as enormous as a mountain. Golden fur was interspersed with purple-gold, and his brass cudgel also became incredibly thick, shaking the void!
