# Chapter 49: Sixth Layer of Qi Refinement

Lin Shan took out the Innate Vermilion Fruit from the jade box.

**[Water Spirit Fruit]**  
Quality: First-grade Spiritual Material  
Description: One of the Five Elements Spirit Fruits, matures in a hundred years, contains pure water spiritual energy. Consuming and refining it can enhance cultivation. Must be stored in jade immediately after picking to prevent the gradual dissipation of its spiritual energy.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

After carefully admiring this natural treasure, Lin Shan began to hesitate.  

"Can eating this directly help me break through the early-stage bottleneck?"  

He compared the thickness of his own "Mystic Pass" barrier, calculating how much spiritual energy he would need to break through. Then he assessed the spiritual energy within the Water Spirit Fruit.  

The fruit did seem to contain a considerable amount of spiritual energy, but factoring in the loss from converting water spiritual energy into wind-attribute spiritual power within his body, it might not be enough.  

Lin Shan recalled what Elder Nan had said during the battle the previous day—Vermilion Fruits like this were one of the main ingredients for Qi Refinement-stage pills.  

If not used for alchemy and simply consumed, it was uncertain whether it could help break through the Qi Refinement bottleneck.  

After some thought, Lin Shan decided not to dwell on it.  

When in doubt, enhance!  

If he ate it and failed to break through, he would have wasted this Water Spirit Fruit for nothing. Besides, he had the 8 points of ancient charm to spare.  

Let's do it!  

"Enhance!"  

The red-and-blue fruit in his hand instantly shimmered with a hazy spiritual light. Having endured who knew how many years of change within the mist, the enhancement panel directly imposed the rules of transformation, etching the marks of time onto the fruit.  

In the blink of an eye, a deep purple-tinged blue fruit reappeared in his hand, its water spiritual energy now surging intensely.  

So much so that the dense spiritual energy sprayed straight into Lin Shan's face!  

"Did it get dyed after enhancement?"  

Muttering to himself, Lin Shan watched as the transparent enhancement panel updated.  

**[Purple Spirit Fruit]**  
Quality: Second-grade Spiritual Material  
Description: A variant of the Five Elements Spirit Fruits. A two-hundred-year-old Water Spirit Fruit has a chance to transform into this, containing pure water spiritual energy. Consuming and refining it can enhance cultivation. Often used as the main ingredient for late-stage Qi Refinement pills.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

"A hundred-year-old Water Spirit Fruit that transforms after two hundred years? So this is the mutated Purple Spirit Fruit?"  

Lin Shan sensed the spiritual energy within it again—it was undeniably overwhelming. Not only would it be enough to break through his early Qi Refinement "Mystic Pass," but there would even be plenty to spare.  

"A main ingredient for late-stage Qi Refinement pills! If I could trade this at a cultivation market, how many spirit stones would it be worth?"  

Though reluctant, he knew his current cultivation was the priority. Spirit stones could be earned later.  

---  

Sitting cross-legged, Lin Shan entered a meditative state, circulating his spiritual energy through several cycles to ensure he was in optimal condition.  

Without hesitation, he took a bite of the Purple Spirit Fruit.  

"Mmm! Delicious!"  

"Wow! So potent!"  

"Ah! Incredible!"  

This fruit truly lived up to its reputation as a natural treasure, especially at two hundred years of age. Its juices were sweet and refreshing, the flesh plump and delectable.  

Lin Shan was still savoring the taste when he realized he was already holding just the pit.  

Had he devoured it in just a few bites?  

The pit still contained a fair amount of spiritual energy, and Lin Shan briefly considered cracking it open to consume as well. But then the enhancement panel updated again.  

**[Purple Spirit Fruit Pit]**  
Quality: Second-grade Spiritual Material  
Description: The seed of a Purple Spirit Fruit. Blooms in a hundred years to bear a Water Spirit Fruit, transforms into a Purple Spirit Fruit after two hundred years.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

"!!!"  

What? The pit was also a spiritual material? Buy one, get one free?  

He couldn't eat this—it might be valuable later.  

Lin Shan had already realized he was practically a pauper in the cultivation world and needed to start building his assets.  

As for the pit's spiritual energy, absorbing it wouldn't make much difference.  

Just as he stored the pit in the jade box, Lin Shan suddenly felt discomfort in his body.  

"Not good—the water spiritual energy is going wild!"  

Without delay, he began converting the water spiritual energy he had just ingested while guiding it through his meridians.  

Gradually, streams of pure wind spiritual power condensed, but with his dantian already full, the energy could only accumulate in his meridians, growing denser by the moment.  

Feeling the strain, Lin Shan decided to go all out—simultaneously attacking the "Mystic Pass" while refining the water spiritual energy.  

This time, the impact was unprecedented.  

First strike: The massive spiritual force sent cracks spiderwebbing across the barrier. Before the dispersed energy could even regroup, the second wave surged forth!  

Second strike: The Mystic Pass barrier held firm, defiant against the assault.  

Third strike: Amid the roaring torrent, a shattering sound echoed.  

After three strikes, the barrier shattered completely. The accumulated spiritual energy in his meridians surged like a mighty river, rushing unimpeded into his dantian.  

Lin Shan instantly felt as though a shackle had been broken, his body lightening as if something within needed to be filled.  

His dantian had now expanded further, accommodating the influx of wind spiritual power. Yet the water spiritual energy in his system wasn't fully refined yet!  

---  

What Lin Shan didn't know was that Purple Spirit Fruits, as a main ingredient for late-stage Qi Refinement pills, could yield dozens of pills per batch in the hands of a skilled alchemist—or even a hundred if the alchemist was particularly unscrupulous. This spoke volumes about the exorbitant profits in alchemy.  

Having consumed an entire Purple Spirit Fruit in one go, even with only 60% of its energy converted into wind spiritual power, it was an immense boost for someone who had just reached mid-stage Qi Refinement.  

Before Lin Shan could even celebrate breaking through, he was overwhelmed by the rapid growth of his cultivation.  

His dantian's spiritual energy swelled relentlessly—early fourth layer, mid fourth layer, peak fourth layer, early fifth layer...  

After an hour of refining all the water spiritual energy, his strained spirit finally relaxed. Checking his dantian and comparing it to the descriptions in his cultivation manual, he assessed his progress.  

Sixth layer of Qi Refinement!  

Though he had only just stepped into the early stage of the sixth layer, he had leaped two minor realms in one go from the fourth layer.  

"By this measure, each layer of late-stage Qi Refinement likely requires twice as much spiritual energy as before."  

Suppressing his joy, Lin Shan began planning. He needed to find a cultivation market—like the rumored "Silver Spring"—to leverage a spirit vein and reach the peak of the sixth layer as soon as possible.  

Time—a cultivator's greatest enemy.  

Fall behind one step, and you lag at every turn.  

If it took a hundred years just to break through Qi Refinement and reach Foundation Establishment, how could one hope to advance further within the remaining hundred years?  

And if someone barely managed to reach Foundation Establishment by two hundred, entering the Golden Core stage with only half of their four-hundred-year lifespan left, how could they possibly ascend to Nascent Soul in the next two centuries?  

The path of immortality was arduous—every small step was a race against time.  

That was why aged experts in the cultivation world secluded themselves, desperately cultivating. Who had time to flaunt their power and wander about?  

Those who served as guest elders in mortal dynasties were usually cultivators who had given up on progress, content to idle away their days.  

But Lin Shan, at eighteen years old and already at the sixth layer of Qi Refinement, stood a decent chance at Foundation Establishment.  

"Next, I'll head to the capital and gather information on the rumored cultivation markets."  

Having made his decision, Lin Shan settled down to consolidate his newfound strength.
