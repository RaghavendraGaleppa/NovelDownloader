# Chapter 121: The Immortal Sword in My Grasp! All of You Are Mere Mantises!

Gao Xuan appeared increasingly aged. 

Yet with a single sword light, he repelled twenty-five golden dragons and shattered the Buddhist light formation. Previously, he had wielded the sword with his true qi, only unleashing a fraction of its power. Now, he channeled his lifeblood into the blade, fully unleashing its overwhelming might!

At this moment, Gao Xuan's strength had reached a level that struck fear into all who witnessed it. The surrounding onlookers, powerful figures from various factions, were utterly shocked.

"Gao Xuan's displayed might is approaching that of the sect leaders of the great immortal sects!"

"Li Zhengjing won't even have a chance to escape now!"

"What a pity—his talent is unparalleled, unprecedented in history, but he overestimated himself."

"With the aptitude he's shown, had he cultivated in peace for a few more years, he would have become one of the most powerful beings in the world."

"Unfortunately, he underestimated Gao Xuan's abilities."

Those who had entered Hongshan Town were not just the three river deities of Jiangshang Prefecture and the thirty-thousand-strong army of General Fang Yin. There were also figures from various factions, including high-ranking members of immortal sects and Buddhist sects. Hidden in the shadows were the Ten Thousand Realms Transcendent Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Ship, the Grand Preceptor of the Great Xuan Dynasty, and other concealed figures.

Faced with the ferocious Gao Xuan, Li Zhengjing found himself in dire straits. Three of his twenty-five golden dragons had been destroyed, and the remaining twenty-two could only hover in the air, offering minimal assistance without posing any real threat to Gao Xuan. Even the Five Elements Creation Tree, wielding the Profound Reflection Mirror from afar, was incapable of harming Gao Xuan.

Now, forced to confront Gao Xuan head-on, Li Zhengjing found himself barely able to hold his ground.

"He's too strong. What kind of opportunity is hidden in his right arm?" Yuan Zhengfeng murmured. "Have you spotted his weakness?"

"I can't see it." Li Zhengjing retreated repeatedly. He had intended to use the golden page to analyze Gao Xuan and uncover the truth, but it kept displaying insufficient spiritual energy, requiring a massive infusion to proceed.

The opportunity within Gao Xuan's right arm originated from the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven—a power from beyond this world. It might even have come from a true immortal of the Nine Heavens! 

To fully discern its origins would require an immense amount of spiritual energy. Moreover, Li Zhengjing faintly sensed traces of the Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi on Gao Xuan. To alter his fate regarding this sword technique, he had consumed three hundred spirit mines. To uncover the secrets of Gao Xuan's opportunity, he would likely need the equivalent of hundreds of spirit mines' worth of energy.

"Gao Xuan couldn't fully unleash the sword's power using just his true qi, so he had to expend his lifeblood—because his bloodline carries the essence of an immortal."

Yuan Zhengfeng explained, "His lifeblood is insufficient, so he consumes the blood of his kin to replenish himself..."

"Though he's only at the true qi realm, the power emanating from his right arm approaches that of a sect leader!"

"Even if the current Grand Preceptor of Great Zhou were to arrive with the Imperial Jade Seal, he might not be able to subdue Gao Xuan."

"The two of us combined probably can't defeat him. Should we retreat?"

Yuan Zhengfeng had always been eager for battle, but now, faced with the overwhelming sword's edge, even he felt the urge to withdraw. "This fight isn't winnable. Even if we add that little girl to suppress Gao Xuan, the hidden forces watching from the sidelines might intervene... Right now, escaping isn't difficult."

"No." 

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page's divination and said, "We can win this battle, and there will be no repercussions..."

At that moment, a small head emerged from the sea—a little girl with a half-broken horn on her forehead. She blew bubbles in the water, watching the battle on the shore with eager anticipation. But she remembered her orders: without Li Zhengjing's command, she was not to intervene. 

She didn't quite understand why he refused to call for her help even when he was on the verge of death. Did he enjoy being beaten so much?

Meanwhile, figures from all sides observed the unfolding events. Even in the capital, the Grand Preceptor of Great Zhou retrieved the Palace's Profound Mirror, which projected the scene of the coastal battle in Hongshan Town.

"Gao Xuan's current strength is no less than mine," the Grand Preceptor mused. "With the Imperial Jade Seal restored, I can gather fortune to my side, but even with the nation's destiny bolstering me, I could only suppress him slightly—not defeat him. From this battle, it's clear the opportunity from the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven lies in his right arm..."

"Li Zhengjing's displayed combat prowess already ranks among the strongest of human immortals," one of the river deities remarked. "But even with the twenty-five golden dragons, he shouldn't have forced you to retreat..."

Another deity added, "Besides, in the capital, we could have assisted you. There were still two divine generals left... If we had acted then, we could have captured him instead of gifting him three hundred spirit mines!"

The Grand Preceptor remained calm. "At that time, the Imperial Jade Seal hadn't been restored. I lacked the power to suppress Li Zhengjing. Moreover, letting him into the treasury was an exchange for the materials needed to restore the seal—it was a fair trade. As for you all..."

He glanced at the assembled deities and human immortals. "That little girl lost to the Ten Thousand Tribulations Transcendent Heavenly Venerable, but can any of you compare to him?"

Pointing at the scene in the mirror, the Grand Preceptor continued, "Do you think Li Zhengjing doesn't know that forces from all sides are watching this battle? Though he seems to be in dire straits against Gao Xuan, has he shown any intention to retreat?"

"What do you mean, Grand Preceptor?"

"Li Zhengjing is confident of victory."

"How can you tell?"

"That little girl is in the sea, watching but not intervening. If she acted, their combined strength could suppress Gao Xuan. Yet Li Zhengjing hasn't called for her help..."

One of the deities spoke again, "But Li Zhengjing is still young. His current strength is already astonishing. Do you believe he has some other earth-shattering method to defeat Gao Xuan?"

The Grand Preceptor's gaze remained fixed on the mirror's projection, watching Li Zhengjing retreat step by step—yet his eyes remained calm and resolute.

"Let us wait and see."

Above the clouds, the Wall-Clinging Bird grew anxious and turned to Ghost Valley's Divine Official.

"Gao Xuan was originally at the true qi realm, and he still is—yet his strength is absurdly powerful..."

Ghost Valley's Divine Official glanced at the Ten Thousand Tribulations Transcendent Heavenly Venerable, who wore a bronze mask.

The Heavenly Venerable's gaze was indifferent. "At my peak, I could have crushed him with a single palm."

The Wall-Clinging Bird couldn't help but ask, "And now?"

The Heavenly Venerable shot it a cold, murderous glare.

The bird froze, not daring to speak further.

"Only someone at the sect leader level can suppress Gao Xuan," Ghost Valley's Divine Official said gravely. "Young Friend Zhengjing likely can't defeat him."

The Heavenly Venerable shook his head slightly. "This boy is clever. He's only retreating, not engaging head-on. If nothing unexpected happens, he'll win in moments."

Ghost Valley's Divine Official's eyes widened in realization. "Ah, I see now."

The Wall-Clinging Bird was still confused. "Why will he win?"

Ghost Valley's Divine Official explained, "Gao Xuan is like a raging flame right now—too fierce to approach. But his cultivation is limited, his body aged, his lifeblood withered. He can't sustain this for long before burning out."

The Heavenly Venerable looked down and remarked coolly, "But in my view, an unexpected turn is about to occur."

---

**Boom!**

The light in Gao Xuan's eyes suddenly dimmed.

He let out a furious roar, his body withering into a desiccated corpse—save for his right arm, which erupted with boundless sharpness.

At this moment, Gao Xuan completely lost his consciousness. His gaze grew vacant, leaving only battle lust.

"His right arm contains half a sword blade!"

Li Zhengjing's eyes flashed with golden light, piercing through illusions to see Gao Xuan's true form.

Now, Gao Xuan's body was nothing more than a puppet. What truly controlled him was the opportunity within his right arm!

Because the power in his right arm had grown so strong, its nature became clearer—a broken sword!

Before, Gao Xuan had been the one wielding the sword. Now, he was merely a tool controlled by the broken blade.

Then, Gao Xuan raised his right arm and pointed at Li Zhengjing, instantly piercing through space to appear right before him.

The Five Elements Creation Tree activated the Profound Reflection Mirror, its light striking Gao Xuan's back. This time, the sword light did not form a protective barrier—allowing the mirror's radiance to pierce straight through Gao Xuan's body!

Twenty-two golden dragons interposed themselves, but the sword light tore through them effortlessly.

Gao Xuan's right arm stabbed forward like a blade—wherever it pointed, the sword light pierced all!

This sword strike arrived in an instant!

His arm moved too quickly—his entire body seemed to be dragged along with it.

The sword was aimed straight at Li Zhengjing!

---

Above the clouds, the Ten Thousand Tribulations Transcendent Heavenly Venerable murmured, "This sword strike is no weaker than my full-power divine ability at my peak."

In other words, this strike had reached the level of a sect leader!

The three great immortal sects were the most formidable forces in the world, and their leaders were regarded as the pinnacle of power in this era. Yet now, Gao Xuan—a mere true qi realm cultivator—had unleashed combat strength equal to the world's peak!

All who witnessed this felt their hearts tremble. None among them dared to face this sword head-on—not even the Grand Preceptor of Great Zhou in the capital, who admitted that even with the nation's fortune and the Imperial Jade Seal, he wouldn't emerge unscathed.

The River Deity of Jiangshang, General Fang Yin, the Three Yang Duke, and other deities—along with the immortal sect elders and Buddhist arhats—held their breaths.

They had come to kill Gao Xuan.

They had waited, observing, hoping for both sides to weaken each other.

But only now did they realize they had underestimated Gao Xuan's strength—and the opportunity from the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven.

Without Li Zhengjing, they might have already attacked... and died beneath this sword.

"Li Zhengjing is finished!"

"What a pity for such a prodigious talent!"

"After this sword strike, Gao Xuan will be spent. The true treasure is the opportunity in his right arm!"

"It must not fall into another faction's hands!"

Their thoughts raced a thousand times in an instant as they watched the sword light pierce through twenty-two golden dragons and shoot toward Li Zhengjing.

Yet, at this moment—when the world itself seemed to freeze—Li Zhengjing raised his right hand to meet it.

His expression was calm, as if he had prepared for this. In his palm, a pure sword light gleamed.

**Boom!**

Palm met palm.

In that instant, everything seemed to freeze.

Contrary to expectations, Li Zhengjing's body was not pierced by Gao Xuan's arm. There wasn't even a clash of energies or a dispersal of sword light.

For a brief moment, it looked as though two close friends had pressed their palms together, unwilling to part.

To an uninformed observer, the scene might have seemed heartwarming.

But to the powerful figures watching, it was deeply unsettling.

"Just as I thought..."

Li Zhengjing's mind stirred.

At this moment, their palms were pressed together—both having unlocked their acupoints. True qi and spiritual energy surged between them.

The razor-sharp intent from Gao Xuan's right arm continuously pierced into Li Zhengjing's palm.

Gao Xuan's lingering will sought to destroy Li Zhengjing's right arm and obliterate his body. But the broken sword in his arm seemed only to want to leave Gao Xuan and enter Li Zhengjing's body instead.

"No!" Yuan Zhengfeng warned. "That broken sword is an immortal weapon—far too sharp! If it enters your body, you'll die without a doubt! Even if you possess the Heavenly Azure Dao Treasure, not even the Heavenly Azure Daoist himself could suppress this blade!"

The half-sword blade sought to pierce through Li Zhengjing's palm and embed itself within him.

This sword was too sharp—only someone like Gao Xuan, with "immortal blood," could withstand it.

Li Zhengjing, lacking an immortal bloodline, would be torn apart from within, his body riddled with holes until nothing remained. And Yuan Zhengfeng, residing inside him, would perish as well—his human immortal essence utterly annihilated.

"Don't worry, Elder Yuan."

Li Zhengjing spat out a broken jade fragment, which fell to the ground.

At that moment, his aura plummeted—as though he had fallen from the clouds to the earth. He lost his human immortal power, retaining only his true qi realm cultivation.

Without spiritual energy, relying solely on true qi, he had no means to resist the sword's entry.

Gao Xuan's withered body trembled slightly. His right arm—the only part that hadn't decayed—now began to wither as well.

The overwhelming sharpness poured entirely into Li Zhengjing's body.

"I've been waiting for you."

Li Zhengjing smiled through the pain.

He watched as his right arm cracked inch by inch, flesh and bone turning to dust.

But the destruction stopped at his elbow.

Suppressing the agony, he whispered, "As I thought—they're one and the same."

Now, embedded in his arm, the half-sword blade seemed restrained—as if anchored in place.

Because the Heavenly Profound White Gold given by the counterfeit medicine seller perfectly fit the broken edge of the blade. It was a seamless match.

This half-sword was entirely forged from Heavenly Profound White Gold. The fragment the seller had provided was a piece that had broken off when the sword was shattered.

Thus, when the fragment rejoined the blade, it carried with it the Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi Li Zhengjing had spent a month refining.

The sword qi from the fragment spread along the merged blade—this was Li Zhengjing's method, guided by the golden page, to truly subdue the broken sword.

But to outsiders, it appeared as though Gao Xuan had collapsed and Li Zhengjing stood frozen—as if both had perished together.

"Li Zhengjing is dead! Gao Xuan is spent! The opportunity is mine!"

A golden light surged forth, vast and mighty, streaking toward the two.

"Audacious!"

General Fang Yin raised his spear, the aura of his army manifesting behind him—the collective fortune of his troops bolstering his power.

"The mantis and the cicada perish together—now let us see who is the oriole!"

A Buddhist arhat from the Cloud-Sky Temple manifested a hundred-zhang golden body, reaching out to seize Li Zhengjing and Gao Xuan.

"Li Zhengjing is a true disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect! Gao Xuan is a murderer of our disciples! How dare you, Cloud-Sky Temple, interfere?"

An elder from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect transformed into a vast white cloud, enveloping the area.

The true battle erupted at this moment.

The heavens darkened, wind and thunder raged, and a dragon's roar echoed from the sea.

"They call themselves orioles, but they're all just mantises..."

The Ten Thousand Tribulations Transcendent Heavenly Venerable chuckled, rising from the clouds.

Then, as if struck by lightning, he froze.

After a long silence, he sat back down and sighed.

"It seems I, too, am a mantis."
