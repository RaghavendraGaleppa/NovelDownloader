# Chapter 41: The Exposed Spirit Fruit

Chu Ning, now at the fifth level of Qi Refinement and having cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, possessed keen perception. Though initially surprised to see someone outside his courtyard, he quickly recognized the figure as Qi Chongmao, his neighbor.

Qi Chongmao, noticing Chu Ning's return, waited at the courtyard gate instead of leaving. "Brother Qi!" Chu Ning greeted with a bow, which Qi Chongmao returned politely. "Junior Brother Chu, I've been waiting for you."

This puzzled Chu Ning. While Qi Chongmao was always amiable, he rarely sought Chu Ning out. "What can I do for you, Senior Brother?" he asked.

With a smile, Qi Chongmao pointed at the ironvine creeping over Chu Ning's courtyard wall. "Nothing major. I was just curious where you found such high-quality ironvine. Yours grows so vigorously—I'd like to plant some in my own courtyard for decoration."

Chu Ning was taken aback by the trivial nature of the question. "I collected the seeds from the back mountain," he replied honestly. "As for the growth, I practiced the Growth Spell and Verdant Spring Technique on them frequently."

Qi Chongmao nodded in understanding. "I'll gather some seeds too. Winter makes everything look bleak without greenery." After some small talk, he returned to his courtyard.

Watching him leave, Chu Ning frowned. Qi Chongmao had clearly been waiting for some time—just to ask about ironvine? They'd crossed paths before, yet he'd never shown interest until now. 

Something felt off. The ironvine had been there for months, and Qi Chongmao had even complimented it previously. Why ask today? Shaking his head, Chu Ning dismissed his suspicion—ironvine was hardly remarkable.

But as he pushed the courtyard gate open, his pupils contracted sharply. Someone had entered his yard. 

To safeguard the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit he cultivated, Chu Ning always left a subtle marker—a tendril of ironvine tied to the gate that would fall upon opening. Today, it was gone.

He hurried inside, scanning the area. Finding nothing amiss and sensing no lingering presence with his spiritual awareness, he moved swiftly to the rear courtyard. 

There, dense ironvine formed a concealed path to the spirit fruit. But today, Chu Ning paused. Though the vines appeared undisturbed, their blossoms showed signs of having been parted. 

His heart sank when he reached the spirit fruit. The ironvine nearby had been disturbed—a petal he'd tucked beneath a leaf now lay on the ground. 

The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had been discovered. 

Chilling realization prickled Chu Ning's skin. Having witnessed the fruit's exorbitant auction price at the market, he knew its value—and the danger of its exposure. 

Qi Chongmao's name flashed in his mind. The man had lingered outside, likely having just exited the courtyard when Chu Ning returned. His sudden interest in ironvine was a ruse. 

Silence about the spirit fruit spoke volumes about his intentions. 

Steeling himself, Chu Ning assessed his position. Both were at the fifth level of Qi Refinement, though Qi Chongmao had reached it earlier, granting him deeper cultivation. 

In terms of spells, Chu Ning mastered only the Thorn Technique and Vine Armor Technique—both executable instantly. He wondered about Qi Chongmao's capabilities. 

His talisman reserves were meager: one Golden Sword Talisman, one Protective Talisman, and one Swift Step Talisman. Regret gnawed at him for not purchasing more at the market. 

Direct confrontation seemed unlikely—sect rules strictly prohibited infighting. The greater threat was theft in his absence. Yet, he couldn't discount the possibility of outright robbery. 

For the rest of the day, Chu Ning remained in the rear courtyard, contemplating countermeasures. 

The next morning, he summoned Qiu Shunyi via a messenger talisman (a gift from Mu Ling for communication) and sent him to purchase additional talismans with provided spirit stones. Though curious, Qiu Shunyi obliged after hearing Chu Ning's plausible excuse. 

In the following days, Chu Ning secluded himself, neglecting even his spirit fields of Ink Bamboo and Purple Water Grass. Unlike spirit rice, these crops required less maintenance—missing a few days of Verdant Spring Technique would only slow their growth, which he could compensate for later. 

His routine became daytime spell practice and body refinement, while nights were spent on basic cultivation of the Evergreen Wood Technique in the rear courtyard—avoiding the Verdant Spring Technique to prevent affecting the spirit fruit. Progress slowed, but his Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique advanced steadily. 

Seven days passed before Chu Ning noticed something peculiar.
