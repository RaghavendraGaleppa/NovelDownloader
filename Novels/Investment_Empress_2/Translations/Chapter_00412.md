# Chapter 412: An Abnormality in Ying Bing, I Believe in You!

Inside the Crystal Palace.

The divine light of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain manifested as overlapping shadows of worlds.

At this moment, however, all of it fused into Ying Bing’s brow. She could no longer hold the divine sword in her hand, letting it fall powerlessly to the ground. It hummed and floated, seemingly worried about its master.

The tall, cold少女’s (young woman’s) lithe figure was surging with divine light, highlighting her jade-like skin and ice-like bones. As her black hair danced, a hint of frost and snow seemed to stain it.

Her expression was blank, her eyes radiating aloofness and majesty.

“Her...”

Qin Yuzhi finally awoke from the grief of losing the Eighteen Arhats.

In fact, the moment she saw the Heavenly Phoenix Domain merge into Ying Bing’s brow, her scalp went numb, and her soul almost flew out of her skull.

It was as if she had seen an existence even more terrifying than the Dream God.

“Ice Cube...”

Li Mo had no time to look at any rewards. He reached out, wanting to step forward and take her hand.

“Wait!” Qin Yuzhi blocked him, her face filled with panic. “Quick, lie down with me in the coffin, cover the lid, and pretend we saw nothing.”

“Why?”

Li Mo was not the type to be overly curious in a crisis. But in the eyes of this former Half-step to the Tongtian Realm, who was now still a Master of the Xuan Realm, it was obvious that something uncontrollable had happened to the Ice Cube.

“Your little wife has gathered three and a half of the Nine Souls of the Primordial Phoenix!”

Qin Yuzhi spoke rapidly, completely losing her composure.

“...”

From her incoherent words, Li Mo vaguely understood a few things.

The Xia Phoenix Qi, the Blood Phoenix Essence, the Jade Phoenix Spirit, and the Heavenly Phoenix Domain—all these belonged to the Nine Souls of the Primordial Phoenix. Combined with the half-truths spoken by that Yunmeng Immortal earlier...

The legacy of the Nine Heavens Immortals could allow those beings to revive...

Could it be that the same thing that happened to Qin Yuzhi was happening to the Ice Cube?

The revival of an Immortal or a God?!

Thinking of this, Li Mo’s heart tightened violently, then felt as if a piece had been dug out, leaving an unfathomable void.

“Is there any way to stop it?”

Li Mo first asked Tian Miao, but the latter only shook her head slowly with a heavy expression.

Then he looked at Qin Yuzhi.

“A way... let me think...”

Qin Yuzhi’s face showed a flash of memory, followed by confusion. She slowly squatted down on the ground.

“A way... is there a way? I’ve slept for too long...”

Sealing herself in the coffin using secret techniques naturally came at a cost.

There were many blank spots in her spiritual soul, leading to problems with her memory.

If one had to describe the symptoms, it would be somewhat similar to dementia...

After a moment, Qin Yuzhi gave up on trying to recall. She squatted on the ground, scratching her head and muttering:

“Perhaps I just instinctively felt that it was somewhat similar to my situation back then.”

“It might... not be that bad. After all, her cultivation level is still shallow... as long as... hmm? What was I trying to say?”

“Oh, right, it’s also possible that she is just accepting the Heavenly Phoenix Domain.”

There was no relying on this person...

For the first time, Li Mo felt that a Seventh Realm expert could be so unreliable.

“At the very least, I need to figure out what is happening to the Ice Cube...”

He gritted his teeth, released his Taiyin Divine Will, and braved the light of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain to step forward.

The Ice Cube stood there like a cold, peerless jade statue. A transcendence that stood above all things, a breath that governed the birth and destruction of the world, surrounded her.

It was unknown whether this aura originated from the Heavenly Phoenix Domain or from herself.

Li Mo felt as if he had stepped into a world seed within chaotic obscurity.

However, this time, he was not the master of this world.

He immediately drew upon the power of the world. Walking through the sticky air, he finally managed to艰难地 (struggle) step right in front of Ying Bing.

“Ice Cube...” Li Mo called out softly.

At that moment, he seemed to see Ying Bing’s fingers tremble slightly.

There was a reaction!

So, Little Li didn't hesitate anymore!

He grabbed the Ice Cube’s jade hand! He gripped it instantly and pulled her into his embrace.

Her lithe body seemed colder than usual.

*Sharing the Moonlight*, activate!

---

This martial art had already been pushed by him to the Perfection Realm using his martial arts insights. Even if the Ice Cube’s consciousness was currently in a haze, it could forcibly awaken her spirit.

The light of the Taiyin Divine Will reappeared behind her.

The wills of the two connected once again.

At that moment.

Li Mo’s vision exploded. He saw the birth, prosperity, chaos, ruin, and silence of many worlds...

In an instant, he felt like a bystander, unable to do anything, his consciousness seeming to be crushed by a millstone.

But at least.

He now knew what Ying Bing was experiencing at this moment.

He didn't know how much time had passed before Li Mo’s muddled mind regained clarity. His first reaction was to lower his head.

The face that made all things lose their color had regained its blush. The Frost Immortal was quietly lying in his arms, gazing at him.

Sensing his gaze, she lowered her head slightly. Her holy, quiet beauty suddenly became more spirited.

“Ice Cube?”

“Mm...”

Li Mo’s heart relaxed slightly.

“Wait!”

Qin Yuzhi’s expression remained grave. She seemed to remember something and said solemnly:

“She might not be the real her.”

“She is.”

Li Mo shook his head. Their wills were connected.

Qin Yuzhi shook her head and said:

“That kind of change is subtle, silent, and imperceptible! Even she wouldn't notice it herself!”

Just like a mental patient thinking they aren't sick?

The smile vanished from Li Mo’s face.

“However, I have a method.”

Qin Yuzhi raised a finger, finally looking a bit like an expert:

“When another consciousness awakens inside the body, they will forget things that the original person could never possibly do.”

“For example, the Ancestor God of Yunmeng loved playing Go and would absolutely never play Mahjong. So the real me would never forget how to play Mahjong.”

Things they would absolutely never do...

Li Mo looked at Ying Bing.

He saw the Ice Cube’s eyelashes tremble, and her lips like shattered jade parted:

“You are a gentleman who loves legs and feet, and your mind is full of lewd thoughts...”

The Frost Immortal’s small, crimson mouth chattered away, looking as if various banned words were about to burst out like a machine gun.

Li Mo: “!?”

It was... quite sudden.

What was worse, Tian Miao was right there, craning her neck to listen!

If the Ice Cube finished speaking, who knows what kind of nickname he would have on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List) next time!

He might still be alive, but he would be socially dead in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands...

Li Mo covered her small mouth, his face filled with righteous energy as he said:

“No need to say more, I believe in you!”

Qin Yuzhi: “?”

Tian Miao: “?”

What just ran over their faces? *Whoosh*, leaving only a string of mysterious tire tracks?

The suspicion in their eyes remained, but the target shifted from Ying Bing to Li Mo.

Was it that exciting?

It sounded a bit thrilling...

Anyway, the crisis on the Ice Cube seemed to be temporarily resolved.

Yes.

Seemingly, temporarily.

The few of them now had to face another problem.

Li Mo pulled the topic away with a face full of righteousness:

“We are currently blocked in. Outside, there are at least two groups of people eyeing us covetously.”

“The moment the Crystal Palace opens, they will likely rush in like wolves and tigers.”

“Although everyone knows I’m a genius, three cobblers equal Zhuge Liang. We still need to think of a way together.”

“How do we escape?”
