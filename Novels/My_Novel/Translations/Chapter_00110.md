Chapter 110: Seizing Fortune, A Tearful Farewell

The matter began yesterday.

Just past noon, Luo Fang, the steward of the laborers, was directing his men to sweep the mountain paths and clear the roads, working hard under the scorching sun.

Suddenly, he saw a sedan chair approaching from the distant mountain path. He jumped onto a large boulder and squinted to see better. If it were a friend of the Madam from the Jianghu, he could seize the chance to flatter them and perhaps gain some benefits.

He saw the sedan was vermilion red, with red silk curtains hanging down. Embroidered upon it was the character "武" (Martial). This style of sedan chair came from the Ministry of Revenue of the Imperial Court. In the entire Qingning County, only County Magistrate Lin Guolong possessed such a standard.

"Strange, is the County Magistrate looking for the Madam?" Luo Fang wondered.

Having followed the Madam for a long time, Luo Fang had seen the world. He immediately braced himself and hurriedly called for people to clear the road, ensuring the official would have a smooth ride.

"Pick up all the pebbles and stray branches," he ordered. "I'm telling you, the County Magistrate's backside is more precious than our heads."

The laborers worked diligently under his shouting. In reality, even if there were pebbles on the road, they wouldn't jolt the County Magistrate's backside. The bearers possessed profound martial strength; no matter how rugged the path, they could keep the sedan perfectly steady.

Luo Fang always sought an opportunity to perform, even if it was a useless effort.

Before long, the sedan arrived outside the estate.

"Your Honor, what brings you here? Are you looking for the Madam?" Luo Fang approached with an obsequious smile.

The curtain was lifted. Lin Guolong's name sounded upright and strong, but his face was pale and round, radiating an air of wealth. He was short with long limbs, a rather strange figure.

He said, "You... who are you again?"

"I am Luo Fang, the steward of the laborers. You can just call me Xiao Luo. I had the honor of seeing you once, several years ago," Luo Fang said, bowing and scraping.

The other laborers were dismissed to a distance of a hundred yards. They watched from afar; it seemed that just catching a glimpse of the County Magistrate added a bit of prestige to their faces.

"Tell the Madam that County Magistrate Lin Guolong requests an audience," Lin Guolong said.

"Yes!"

Luo Fang dared not delay. He passed the message up the chain, and soon it reached the Madam's ears.

However, it wasn't until after dusk that he actually saw the Madam.

In the reception hall.

Lin Guolong had waited a long time and finally saw the Madam enter. He cupped his fists and said, "Madam Wen, long time no see. Have you been well?"

Madam Wen replied coolly, "Very well. I wonder how the County Magistrate fares." Lin Guolong smiled. "I am well too."

Madam Wen said, "I usually have little contact with the County Magistrate. I wonder what matter has brought you here personally. Please, speak plainly."

Lin Guolong sat back in the chair; his feet couldn't even touch the floor. He tensed his toes, and only the thick soles of his boots barely touched the ground.

"If there were no other matter, I would not wish to disturb you," Lin Guolong said. "But my master... insisted I make this trip personally. A master's command is hard to defy. I ask for your understanding, Madam."

"Your master?" Madam Wen raised her delicate eyebrows, showing a hint of interest.

Lin Guolong said, "I am unworthy and have brought shame to my master, Fu Haoran."

"You really are a disgrace," Madam Wen laughed. Lin Guolong's face stiffened, but he couldn't say anything.

Fu Haoran was a "Heavenly Official" at his peak. In the Great Wu Dynasty, those stationed in the capital were "Heavenly Officials," while those stationed outside were "Earthly Officials."

"State your business. Get to the point," Madam Wen said straightforwardly.

"I wonder, Madam, if there is a guard in your estate named Li Xian?" Lin Guolong asked.

"Li Xian?" Madam Wen said, "You came for him?" This actually piqued her curiosity.

"Precisely," Lin Guolong said. "This Li Xian is a native of Qingning County, under my jurisdiction. He has a father, a hunter, who has passed away. He has a younger brother named Li Xiaofan."

Madam Wen usually paid no attention to guard matters. But she happened to know of Li Xian. "I know of him."

"My trip here... is not so much for Li Xian as it is for Li Xiaofan," Lin Guolong said. "This Li Xian is quite lucky to benefit from his younger brother."

"Several months ago, his younger brother Li Xiaofan passed the winter examination and qualified for admission to the Prefecture Academy. At just over ten years old, he went to the academy alone to study. He caught my master's eye and was taken in as a disciple. Strictly speaking... he is also my junior brother."

Madam Wen nodded.

"Although Li Xiaofan is young, he is exceptionally intelligent. He has a photographic memory, quick reactions, and an insatiable thirst for learning. He has already grasped a thread of fortune, albeit a thin one, but... he is considered a scholar with fortune."

Lin Guolong clicked his tongue. "As the saying goes, 'When one attains the Dao, even chickens and dogs ascend to heaven.' The first thing Li Xiaofan wanted to do was return to the county to help his elder brother shed his servant status."

"According to imperial regulations, this should indeed be done. However, my master has high hopes for Li Xiaofan. He kept him behind to continue his studies in the prefecture city. After all, for a scholar, excessive contact with worldly affairs can stain their pure literary heart."

"To put Li Xiaofan's mind at ease, he wrote a letter a few days ago, entrusting this matter to me to handle."

"That is why I have come to find you, Madam Wen."

Lin Guolong smiled as he explained the origin of the matter.

Madam Wen nodded. "So that is how it is." She raised her beautiful eyes slightly, looking at the swimming fish outside the hall, as if contemplating and weighing the situation.

"I hope the Madam will grant this request," Lin Guolong smiled. "It is just a small guard. Releasing him won't harm your noble status, and it will curry favor with my master. Moreover, Li Xiaofan has great talent in the literary path. He is young and has already grasped a thread of fortune. His future prospects are limitless."

Madam Wen remained silent. She took a sip of tea and said, "I understand the County Magistrate's meaning. But I have my own difficulties."

Lin Guolong's expression changed, greatly surprised. "Madam, are you saying..." Madam Wen smiled. "County Magistrate Lin, no need to be nervous. Let me explain."

She said, "I know more about Li Xiaofan's matter than you do.当初 he passed the exam by plucking the flower, but was surrounded by the Seven Sons of the Black Water Gang, Zheng Caiqi. It was his elder brother Li Xian who risked his life to save him. If not for that, how could he have achieved what he has today?"

Lin Guolong said, "This... this..."

Madam Wen tapped the table lightly with her finger. "County Magistrate Lin, have you ever thought about why Li Xiaofan was saved?" Lin Guolong said, "His brother? Or did the Madam secretly assist?"

Madam Wen shook her head. "It was because of Li Xian's martial arts. And that martial arts came from my hand. With that said, you should understand."

Lin Guolong now understood Madam Wen's implication. Martial arts were precious in the Great Wu Dynasty. As a guard, Li Xian practiced her martial arts. If they parted ways, how would the cost of this martial arts training be calculated?

Lin Guolong said, "Madam Wen, you are a smart person. The cost of martial arts training is neither too much nor too little. But you certainly don't look up to it. Why not use this to befriend my master?"

Madam Wen smiled faintly, thinking to herself: *If I were to send Li Xian away like this, your master would only praise you for handling matters well. What does that have to do with me? Keeping this person in my hand, on the other hand, brings endless benefits.*

She said, "County Magistrate Lin still doesn't understand?"

Lin Guolong shook his head. Madam Wen said, "Li Xiaofan is concerned about his elder brother, so he wants to help him shed his servant status. In the end, he is afraid his elder brother will suffer and be bullied."

Lin Guolong nodded, secretly sighing at the Madam's insight into the human heart and her more profound view of things.

Madam Wen said, "I will promote him to be the Guard Captain, assisting me in managing the estate. In this way, his elder brother won't have to suffer or toil. And under my protection, his personal safety is not an issue. Isn't this much more comfortable than wandering outside on his own?"

"If you were Li Xian, how would you choose between these two options?"

The Madam's soft voice guided one's thoughts.

Lin Guolong was asked this and couldn't help but think: *This makes sense. If I were Li Xian, even if I shed my servant status, I would probably have to seek another force to rely on. Rather than that, I might as well stay in the estate.*

He subconsciously nodded.

Madam Wen said, confident and composed, "Go back and draft a letter. Explain the situation to your master and listen to his opinion. He will certainly agree."

"Oh, oh," Lin Guolong nodded in a daze.

Madam Wen said, "In that case, I won't keep the County Magistrate for the night." She waved her sleeve. In a daze, Lin Guolong found himself outside the estate.

It was already late at night.

The sedan bearers, leaning against the sedan, were already snoring loudly.

"This... this... sigh." Lin Guolong slapped his thigh, greatly displeased. He muttered, "Without fortune to support me, even with an official title and being the county magistrate, I am still looked down upon by these martial artists. Sigh!"

"Get the sedan up, get the sedan up," Lin Guolong shouted twice.

On the way back to the county, the road was pitch black.

After traveling for half the journey, Lin Guolong slowly came to his senses and was startled. "This Madam is such a deep schemer! I was actually tricked by her!"

"She seemed unwilling to part with her martial arts, but in reality... her calculations were profound. You could say she killed several birds with one stone!"

"Whoever seizes fortune and joins certain forces can add to the foundation of that force. The hidden benefits are endless. By promoting Li Xian to Captain, firstly, she showed favor to my master and gave him face. Secondly, she resolved the dispute, so she didn't lose out. Thirdly... she bestowed a favor on Li Xiaofan. Perhaps in the future, if Li Xiaofan joins her estate, it will add a thread of fortune to her estate!"

"This calculation of benefits is truly... truly... beyond words."

Lin Guolong now understood. But he could only smile helplessly and comply. That night, he drafted a letter and explained the situation to his master.

The next day.

His master replied with a single word: "Agreed."

"Sigh."

Lin Guolong let out a deep sigh, wanting to cry but having no tears. The Madam didn't like him, and his master didn't like him either.

Without fortune, one cannot be heavily relied upon. With fortune, a carp transforms into a dragon.

***

In Heihe Village.

Ding Hu knelt on one knee, his expression respectful. Last night, he received the Madam's order to promote the guard Li Xian to Captain.

He had been asked to return to the estate overnight.

Li Xian frowned. "Uncle Ding, are you here to joke with me?"

Ding Hu said fearfully, "I wouldn't dare." Li Xian asked, "Has the estate set up another Captain position? What about Captain Pang or Captain Hua?"

Ding Hu said, "No, there is only one Captain in the estate, and that is Captain Li."

"What about Captain Pang?" Li Xian was greatly surprised.

"Captain Pang has long... already..." Ding Hu hesitated for a moment and said, "Captain Pang has been gone for several months."

"Gone?" Li Xian was stunned.

Ding Hu said, "After Captain Pang's injuries healed, he went missing on an external mission. For these past few months, Huan Hanying has been acting as Captain, but now... the Captain position is yours, Uncle Li."

"Captain Pang is missing?" Li Xian asked, thinking to himself: *I am in a remote place and don't know the changes in the estate. I don't know if Captain Pang was framed by villains or if he is truly missing.*

"This subordinate does not know either," Ding Hu cupped his fists. "Anyway, Captain Li, if you are ready, please return to the estate with me!"

"The Madam asked you to wait in front of the Quiet Heart Tower after returning to the estate. Once she comes out of seclusion, she will speak with you personally and explain the situation."

Li Xian said, "Alright, I will return right away."

He went back to his room to pack his luggage and prepared to leave. The men, women, and children of Heihe Village, hearing that Li Xian was leaving, all saw him off with tears in their eyes.
