# Chapter 203: Copying the Strange Stone, the Sword Mark... It's Gone?

At noon, a drizzling rain began to fall.

The area around the strange stone still maintained its scenery of waterfalls and clear springs, but now it was accompanied by green grass casting shadows, the clear chirping of birds, and a bright moon reflected in the tranquil pool.

There was also an additional cave.

Whenever someone comprehended the strange stone, the lingering implication left upon it would form various wondrous scenes.

After Li Mo’s comprehension, a pit appeared on the mountain wall behind the waterfall.

"It really does look a bit like the Water Curtain Cave..."

Walking around the strange stone, he entered the cave mouth.

A sense of familiarity arose in Li Mo’s heart. He wasn't sure if it was because this somewhat resembled the cave he had dug near Autumn Water Pavilion, or if it matched his imagination of where a certain Great Sage was born.

Sitting cross-legged inside the cave, his consciousness sank into the World Seed.

*Buzz buzz—*

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer within the World Seed trembled slightly.

The Hammer Treasure wanted to hammer something else.

"Be good, this stone can only face down one side right now."

"Once this stone can face down on both sides, I'll definitely let you hammer it again."

Li Mo comforted it seriously.

Sensing his solemnity, the Hammer Treasure believed him and obediently went to play with the Crimson Dawn Sword.

Taking out the Four Treasures of the Study and a pile of strange treasures to replenish his Soul of Intent, Li Mo took a deep breath.

"Last time I copied the strange stone, I didn't even reach one-tenth."

"Now that I have observed the two apertures of the Divine, my Soul of Intent has grown greatly, and my Qi is complete and my Spirit is full."

Swallowing a Five-Striped Pill of Abundance and Emptiness.

Li Mo spread the Green Vein Jade Slips on the green stone, poured his mental power into the tip of the brush, and lifted the pen to write.

To draw a stone, one cannot simply draw a stone.

You must draw the countless years of wind and rain it has endured...

The countless birds and beasts that have passed by its side, and the countless sunrises and moonsets it has witnessed.

It might even have been hit by a hammer...

Li Mo’s brush danced like a dragon and a snake.

If there was even the slightest mistake in the painting, he would pick up a new sheet of paper and start over from scratch.

Just as he was concentrating on his painting.

*Step—*

A footstep suddenly sounded outside the Water Curtain Cave.

Li Mo looked up.

He then saw a woman with short hair reaching her ears, wearing the simplest Hengyun Sword City disciple robe, and a pair of round crystal glasses on her face.

Due to the various implications of the wondrous scene, she seemed not to notice that a cave had appeared behind the waterfall, nor that there was a person inside.

She sat down skillfully and began to seriously comprehend the strange stone.

"Senior Brother Xu's disciple?"

Senior Brother Xu was that white-haired youth with the Law Body.

When he came up, he had mentioned his disciple, who was also the Senior Sister of Hengyun Sword City.

Many of the famous martial arts in the sword city today were insights she had gained. Aside from comprehending the strange stone, she basically spent her time practicing her sword and rarely left her residence.

"I smell the aura of a tech-nerd."

Li Mo shrugged and continued with his own business.

The two did not disturb each other.

Another half an hour passed.

Looking at the painting before him, which now bore an eighty percent resemblance to the strange stone outside, Li Mo shook his head.

"This is the best one I've done today."

"It seems my current Soul of Intent strength and painting skills are still insufficient to draw the Upper Form..."

Li Mo wasn't discouraged.

Senior Brother Ouyang had immersed himself in the way of painting for over a decade, and even now, he could at most paint the Upper Form.

Li Mo's progress was already very fast.

If he persisted in copying it, he would eventually succeed, and that future wasn't too far away.

"Ice Cube's lecture is almost over."

Glancing at the sky, Li Mo got up to leave.

But just as he reached the cave entrance.

*Hm?*

He saw the woman with the round crystal glasses, her face now deathly pale, muttering something to herself.

**Heaven's Fate Divine Eye Activated!**

**[Name: Wei Zhaoliu]**
**[Age: 26]**
**[Bone Constitution: Eight Directions Sword Body.]**
**[Realm: Seven Apertures of Divine Observation.]**
**[Heaven's Fate: Purple]**
**[Evaluation: Has observed the Sword Mark Strange Stone for decades, regards the Sword Mark as a divine miracle, and believes her entire martial arts prowess comes from the Sword Mark. She uses this as her goal, hoping to one day surpass her teacher.]**
**[Recent Encounter: After leaving seclusion, she re-comprehended the strange stone and could no longer sense the existence of the Sword Mark.]**

---

Li Mo: "..."

Didn't the elders of the sword city say that one could still comprehend the strange stone even without the Sword Mark?

Wasn't the Sword Mark mostly of symbolic significance?

"This... Junior Brother?"

Wei Zhaoliu only just noticed Li Mo and asked, "Junior Brother, do you feel that the strange stone is a bit different today?"

"Haha... a little bit."

Li Mo nodded.

Wei Zhaoliu suddenly seemed to realize something:

"Ah, I remember now."

"Master said that a girl with peerless talent in the Sword Dao made the strange stone flip over while she was comprehending it."

"Junior Brother, have you seen that girl?"

"......"

After a moment of silence, Li Mo said, "I've had some interaction and understanding of her."

"I heard she is currently lecturing at the Sword Pool. I will definitely go see her when I have time."

As she spoke, a strong interest arose in Wei Zhaoliu's eyes.

"She lectures very well indeed."

"So, Junior Brother, you've heard her?"

"Yes, often."

"With such high talent in the Sword Dao, I wonder who between her and I will be the first to imprint their own Sword Mark onto the strange stone."

Wei Zhaoliu sighed.

She felt that her talent might not be stronger than that girl's, but she had at least comprehended the Sword Mark Strange Stone for over a decade. Her experience was there, so she still had a chance.

As she spoke, she walked over and casually prepared to flip the strange stone over.

"Wait..."

*Slap*, the strange stone was flipped over.

"What for?"

Wei Zhaoliu froze.

As her gaze lowered, the light in her eyes instantly solidified.

"The Sword Mark... it's gone?"

The light vanished from her eyes, and she instantly looked as if she had lost her soul.

"....."

Li Mo covered his face.

He hadn't expected Wei Zhaoliu to flip it over, and it was too late to stop her.

Wei Zhaoliu had already lost her soul at this moment, her entire being seeming to turn pale.

"This... this... is a hammer?"

After seeing it clearly, her pupils shook violently.

"If we aren't mistaken... yes."

As Li Mo spoke, he noticed.

Through the Heaven's Fate Divine Eye, Wei Zhaoliu's state had changed.

**[Recent Encounter: Discovered the Sword Mark had turned into a hammer. Her Dao Heart is shaken, showing signs of a near collapse.]**

Not far away.

Wei Zhaoliu fell to the ground, sharp Sword Qi radiating from her, carving deep marks into the surroundings.

This wasn't her intentional release, but rather leakage.

Wei Zhaoliu wanted to calm herself down, but she couldn't.

The thing she had spent her entire life's energy pursuing had now vanished.

And had turned into a hammer.

Then... what did the things she悟 (enlightened) from it count as?

But.

Suddenly, a clear brilliance lit up, shining into her chaotic mind.

She seemed to instantly become calm.

Her scattered gaze converged again, and she saw not far away, that Junior Brother from earlier, a faint moonlight shadow appearing behind him.

It carried a sense of tranquility and peace, like an invisible hand smoothing out the wrinkles in her heart.

After observing the Second Aperture of the Divine.

Li Mo's Soul of Intent power had gained the effect of soothing negative emotions.

At the same time, a prompt sounded.

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Wei Zhaoliu' and preventing damage to her Dao Heart.]**
**[Investment Feedback: Thirty years of Martial Dao comprehension.]**

However.

After waking up from the shock to her mind, Wei Zhaoliu gritted her teeth and asked:

"Who... exactly did this?"

"Junior Brother, you watched the Martial Dao Summit, do you have any idea?"
