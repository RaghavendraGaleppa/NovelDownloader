Chapter 18: The Qin Emperor

In front of the square was a flight of a thousand steps, also paved with white jade bricks, exquisitely carved with golden cloud patterns, as if naturally formed. Beyond the steps stood the Grand Hall, its blue bricks and glazed tiles gleaming with brilliant light. Majestic purple-gold coiled dragon pillars reached for the sky, and jade-carved mythical beasts adorned each of its four flying eaves, emanating an immense aura of grandeur.

In the square, Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Yi. "The King of Qin, huh? No prestige at all. Look at their carriage, then look at yours… embarrassing!"

Zhou Yi accurately understood the meaning in Zhou Tian's eyes. *What can I do? They are the Qin Emperor, and I'm merely the King of Qin.*

The eunuch leading the way naturally didn't notice the father and son's silent exchange. Seeing them both dismount from the carriage, he bowed slightly and quietly led the way. Following the old eunuch, they entered the inner palace through a path to the left of the steps.

Upon entering the inner palace, Zhou Tian looked around like Grandma Liu visiting the Grand View Garden, glancing left and right. He distinctly noticed that the average appearance of the palace maids here seemed a cut above those in their Qin King's residence. The paths within the inner palace were exceedingly complex, almost identical. If not for following the old eunuch, he wouldn't have been able to tell one direction from another.

Tian Ling, on the other hand, was much more reserved, following Zhou Tian closely. She knew very well why she was to marry Zhou Tian: the Qin Emperor was the controller of this empire; annihilating their Vast Sky Sect would be as easy as flipping a hand for him. Her heart pounded with apprehension at the thought of meeting him soon.

After several turns, they finally arrived at the so-called Hall of Mental Cultivation. Compared to the lavishly decorated Grand Hall outside, this place was much more understated, appearing to be just an ordinary palace.

The old eunuch stopped in front of the palace, bowing as he spoke, "His Majesty said, Your Royal Highness the King of Qin, you may enter directly. This old servant doesn't need to announce you."

"Mm." Zhou Yi nodded, then glanced back at Zhou Tian. "Come on, follow me in."

"Got it!" Zhou Tian replied, feeling no great psychological pressure. On one hand, their relationship was relatively close; on the other, Zhou Tian, after all, possessed a cheat, so he felt confident.

Glancing at the anxious Tian Ling beside him, Zhou Tian could roughly guess what she was thinking. He reached out and took her hand; it was a little cold. He smiled faintly, "It's alright, I'm here!"

"Mm." Tian Ling looked at Zhou Tian's smiling face, and her rapidly beating heart slowly calmed down, replaced by a sense of reassurance.

Zhou Yi shook his head helplessly, stepped onto the platform, pushed open the palace doors, and walked in. Zhou Tian, holding Tian Ling's hand, followed closely behind.

The Hall of Mental Cultivation was like a study, filled with many shelves. However, instead of books, the shelves held numerous jade tablets, each faintly glowing with golden light. A middle-aged man with a dignified countenance sat at a desk, clad in a golden dragon-embroidered jade robe. In his left hand, he held a golden jade tablet, shimmering with swirling runes. His eyes were closed, and his right hand tapped the desk with an inexplicable rhythm.

Hearing the movement in the room, the middle-aged man opened his eyes. What kind of eyes they were – as if the sun, moon, and stars revolved within them. In a trance, Zhou Tian seemed to witness ancient ancestors shouldering mountains and chasing peaks, practicing slash-and-burn agriculture. They tilled the mountains and earth, planting seeds the size of human heads. Golden dragon-shaped phantoms encircled them. What a magnificent era of humanity!

"Cough, cough!"

A cough, like a grand bell resonating from beyond the heavens, shattered the illusion. Zhou Tian returned to the palace, his face filled with bewilderment. He looked at Tian Ling beside him and saw she wore a similar expression, indicating she too had witnessed the illusion.

"I didn't restrain myself well just now and drew you into my Dao," the middle-aged man said. "You don't have your own Dao yet, so immersing yourselves too deeply isn't good." His voice was deep and resonant. With a flick of his finger, the golden jade tablet flew onto a shelf in the hall. Then, he looked at Zhou Yi and chuckled, saying, "Second Brother, what took you so long?"

Zhou Yi, however, had a stern expression. He said in a low voice, "Your humble servant greets Your Majesty!" This middle-aged man was none other than the current Emperor of the Great Qin Empire, the Qin Emperor!

Seeing Zhou Yi's demeanor, the Qin Emperor looked exasperated. "Alright, alright, stop pretending," he said. "It wasn't that I didn't speak up for you about that matter some time ago. Who told you to sneak drinks of Imperial Brew, get drunk, and then act crazy? The key thing is, you even knocked off a corner of the Imperial Throne! Your impeachment memorials have piled up like mountains these past two days. If I spoke up for you, those censors would start playing their 'death remonstrance' game again, and that gives me a huge headache…"

Zhou Yi's expression softened upon hearing this, and he complained, "Then let those censors die! They've been annoying me to death lately. Do I not know what the rules are? The point is, I was drunk; can you blame me for that?"

Zhou Tian listened dumbfounded. No wonder Zhou Yi had been like an inflated balloon ready to burst at a touch these past few days; so he had been holding in frustration from outside. *Damaged the Imperial Throne? He really knows how to have fun!*

Zhou Yi then added, "And today, it's this brat! He slept like a dead pig, which is why we were delayed for so long!"

Seeing the Qin Emperor turn his gaze towards him, Zhou Tian cupped his hands and said, "Greet…" Before he could finish, a gentle surge of energy lifted him, and the Qin Emperor simultaneously said, "We're all family, just call me Uncle. No need for such formality. It's been a while since I last saw you. Yesterday, Chuan'er mentioned he ran into you at the arena."

"Yesterday, I took Ling'er to see the arena, and coincidentally ran into Third Brother," Zhou Tian replied.

"Chuan'er came back yesterday and boasted about it for quite some time," the Qin Emperor said. "Someone with triple divine abilities is indeed quite rare." A prodigy, rarely seen for many years in the outside world, was merely 'quite rare' in the Qin Emperor's eyes.

After speaking, the Qin Emperor turned his head to Tian Ling and said, "You must be Tian Ling."

"Yes…" Tian Ling replied, her face tense, her body trembling.

The Qin Emperor smiled, "Don't be nervous. We'll soon be family, so don't overthink it!"

"Mm." Tian Ling nodded, her nervousness significantly reduced.

Seeing her reaction, the Qin Emperor didn't say much more, believing she would naturally adapt over time. He then turned to Zhou Yi and said, "Second Brother, I summoned you today primarily for two matters. One is to draft the imperial decree for the official bestowal of marriage. The other is that the matter you entrusted to me has been handled; the Lord of Mechanicus Nation in Weapon State has delivered the item today."

The Qin Emperor reached into the void and pulled out a tube of purple reagent shimmering with crystalline light, appearing as clear as if a galaxy flowed within it. He casually tossed the item to Zhou Yi and continued, "Tian'er has a unique constitution; he's insulated from spiritual energy and cannot use it to strengthen his body. After much thought, I concluded that only the unique path of the Mechanicus Nation might have something related to this. According to them… This was developed using a newly discovered technology of theirs, called… *Gene*… *Genetic Technology*… quite a mouthful. They claim it explores the deepest secrets of humanity and has no connection to spiritual energy."

"What the fuck?" Zhou Tian's face was completely bewildered. *Genetic technology? Isn't that nonsense? Isn't this an ancient society? How can genetic technology even exist here?!*
