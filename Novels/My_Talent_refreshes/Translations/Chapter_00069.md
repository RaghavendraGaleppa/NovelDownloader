# Chapter 69: Spirit Talisman Arts and the Silverfrost Bamboo Shield  

"Good! Good! Good!"  

Liao Yunming exclaimed three times in succession, his gaze filled with admiration as he looked at Chu Ning.  

"Initially, I only thought your talent for talisman-making was decent, suitable for some training at the market before returning to the pavilion to learn more advanced techniques.  

I never expected your talent to surpass my expectations.  

You truly are ready to learn the Spirit Talisman Arts!"  

With that, Liao Yunming directly retrieved a jade slip from his storage pouch.  

"This jade slip contains the Spirit Talisman Arts. However, according to the sect's rules, items of this level cannot be taken outside the sect.  

Close your eyes and relax—I will transmit the contents of the jade slip directly to you."  

Chu Ning immediately closed his eyes.  

Liao Yunming then brought the jade slip close to Chu Ning's forehead and formed a hand seal.  

A flash of white light enveloped the jade slip, condensing into a ball before vanishing into Chu Ning's mind.  

At the same time, Chu Ning felt the knowledge of the Spirit Talisman Arts appear in his consciousness.  

"Thank you, Steward Liao!" Chu Ning bowed in gratitude.  

Liao Yunming nodded slightly before producing another jade slip.  

He inscribed something onto it in Chu Ning's presence and then handed it over.  

"This contains a talisman called the Beast-Trapping Talisman, a mid-grade primary talisman.  

It's quite effective against low-level demonic beasts. Once you master it, it should sell well at the market."  

Chu Ning quickly accepted it and bowed again in thanks.  

At the same time, he glanced at He Changyou.  

The meaning in his eyes was clear:  

Since the Spirit Talisman Pavilion had given something, shouldn't the Spirit Plantation Department...  

Even Liao Yunming now looked at He Changyou with an amused expression.  

Realizing he couldn't leave without offering something, He Changyou sighed and retrieved an item from his storage pouch—a palm-sized shield.  

"Silverfrost Bamboo Shield—a mid-grade defensive artifact!"  

At He Changyou's words, Chu Ning's eyes lit up.  

An artifact, and a mid-grade defensive one at that—this was undoubtedly a treasure.  

Generally, artifacts were used by Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, while Golden Core cultivators and above typically wielded magic treasures.  

Artifacts were categorized into primary, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.  

During the auction at Yunhai Pavilion, a set of high-grade metal-attribute artifacts—the Golden Feather Swords—had sold for 700 spirit stones.  

However, defensive artifacts were rarer than offensive ones, so a mid-grade defensive artifact like this could easily rival the Golden Feather Swords in value.  

He Changyou smiled at Chu Ning's eager expression as he handed over the shield.  

"You cultivate wood-attribute techniques and spells, so you're naturally more vulnerable to metal and fire-attribute spells.  

This Silverfrost Bamboo Shield is primarily crafted from Frost Spirit Bamboo, infused with silver crystals and engraved with two defensive formations.  

It offers superior protection against metal and fire spells. Just channel your spiritual energy, and the shield will expand to block attacks."  

"Thank you, Steward He!" Chu Ning accepted it with delight.  

He mused inwardly that the saying "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" truly held water.  

In addition to the shield, He Changyou also gave Chu Ning a large storage pouch for trading spirit plants at the market.  

Chu Ning accepted it without hesitation—his current pouch was fine for small items but insufficient for bulk spirit plants.  

After bidding farewell to the two stewards, Chu Ning didn't leave the outer sect immediately.  

Exiting the Hundred Arts Hall, he turned toward the residential area for outer disciples.  

Since he was leaving the sect, it was only proper to say goodbye to those he knew.  

Zhuang Yunde would likely depart soon as well, so they ought to wish each other well.  

And Senior Sister Mu Ling—he could no longer earn spirit stones from her.  

No, he could no longer buy talisman paper for her, so he should inform her.  

This time, Chu Ning first visited Zhuang Yunde's residence.  

At the sight of Chu Ning, Zhuang Yunde's plump face broke into a wide smile.  

"Ah, Junior Brother Chu! Have you settled into your new residence in the outer sect? Is it far from mine?"  

Chu Ning shook his head and explained his assignment outside the sect.  

Zhuang Yunde looked surprised but quickly said,  

"Congratulations, Junior Brother! You've landed a fine assignment."  

Chu Ning blinked. "Senior Brother, being sent outside the sect is a good thing?"  

"Junior Brother, you don't understand," Zhuang Yunde chuckled.  

"Outer disciples receive a fixed 10 spirit stones per month, but those assigned to markets or other external posts get three times that.  

Moreover, you're handling tasks for both the Spirit Plantation and the Spirit Talisman Pavilion.  

From what I know, their monthly quotas to the sect are fixed. Under special circumstances, you might even submit less."  

Here, Zhuang Yunde gave a meaningful smile.  

"With your skills in spirit plants and talismans, growing better crops or making extra talismans shouldn't be hard, right?  

Even if you can't produce more, as a Qi Refining fourth-layer cultivator, submitting less would be understandable, no?"  

Chu Ning looked up in surprise.  

This Senior Brother Zhuang really knew all the tricks for squeezing out benefits.  

But listening to him, it seemed this assignment was indeed advantageous.  

Seeing Chu Ning's thoughtful expression, Zhuang Yunde continued,  

"It's only because the sect is suddenly mobilizing more disciples this time.  

Normally, such assignments are highly sought after in the outer sect."  

Chu Ning nodded—he believed Zhuang Yunde's words.  

"Thank you for the advice, Senior Brother." He then sighed slightly.  

"It's a pity we're both leaving the sect. Otherwise, I'd have many more things to learn from you."  

This was sincere. Despite Zhuang Yunde's opportunistic nature, he had deep insight into sect affairs and rarely held back information.  

From their interactions so far, Chu Ning had gained quite a bit.  

The small cuts he'd given Zhuang Yunde in return were negligible in comparison.  

With that in mind, Chu Ning retrieved 20 talismans from his storage pouch.  

"Senior Brother, these are talismans I recently learned to make—  

Flame Talismans, Profound Ice Talismans, Earth Armor Talismans, and Revival Talismans, all low-grade primary talismans.  

They might not be much, but consider them a small token of gratitude."  

Zhuang Yunde looked surprised.  

He hadn't expected Chu Ning to master so many talisman techniques in such a short time.  

Though they were only low-grade primary talismans, the quantity—worth dozens of spirit stones—was substantial.  

Accepting them, Zhuang Yunde said earnestly,  

"Thank you, Junior Brother. You may not know, but with so many disciples being dispatched,  

talismans, pills, and artifacts are in high demand both in the sect and the markets.  

These talismans are truly timely for me."  

Then, with a hint of concern, he added,  

"But if you've given them all to me, what will you use..."  

Me? I have a whole pile more in my storage pouch. Twenty talismans aren't hard to make.  

Chu Ning smiled. "No need to worry, Senior Brother. I still have some left.  

Besides, the place I'm going isn't dangerous, so I won't need them for now.  

It's just a shame I haven't learned enough to make more or higher-grade talismans yet."  

Zhuang Yunde waved his hand. "Nonsense—this gift is already very thoughtful."  

After a pause, he spoke again,  

This time, to Chu Ning's surprise, he used a sound transmission technique.
