# Chapter 81: Perpetual Motion  

Li Shiming returned to his small chamber with the manual enthusiastically provided by Senior Brother Zhuji.  

First, he activated the cleansing spell on his robe with a surge of spiritual energy. A wave of energy swept through his body from head to toe, even leaving a refreshing sensation in his mouth.  

In truth, ever since he stopped consuming mortal food, a cultivator's body rarely accumulated impurities.  

From the moment he formed a spiritual vortex within his body and became a true cultivator, most of the impurities had already been expelled.  

Apart from major breakthroughs in cultivation, which would purge deeper impurities, a cultivator could remain perfectly clean even after weeks without cleansing.  

Only early-stage Qi Refinement disciples were issued robes with cleansing functions by the sect. Mid and late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators usually purchased their own robes or opted for higher-quality ones from the sect.  

Li Shiming took out the manual and read through it thoroughly. It wasn’t a spell but rather a technique for utilizing spiritual energy.  

Normally, a cultivator’s spiritual energy was highly lethal to vengeful ghosts. Although the ghosts in the "Five Ghosts Soul Refining Banner" had been refined by Xuanming Sect cultivators, making them far more powerful, without their master, they were trapped within the banner.  

By applying the right amount of spiritual energy to continuously cleanse the banner, the resentment of the ghosts inside could be weakened.  

Simple yet practical—the most crucial part of the manual was timing.  

Too much spiritual energy would damage the banner excessively, destroying the five ghosts, while too little would fail to weaken their resentment.  

The manual was a compilation of successful experiences from many cultivators. Likely only a sect like Tianhai Sect, sworn enemies of Xuanming Sect, would have researchers dedicated to this field.  

Li Shiming took out one of the "Five Ghosts Soul Refining Banners." As soon as it appeared, the five ghosts writhed across its surface.  

He channeled spiritual energy and swept his hand over the banner.  

The moment his energy touched the ghosts, a sizzling sound erupted as their forms dissolved slightly, accompanied by their piercing shrieks.  

Having endured the backlash from the copper corpse’s spiritual attack, Li Shiming remained unfazed by the ghosts’ screams. He continued sweeping spiritual energy over the banner repeatedly.  

The ghosts’ dark forms gradually lightened, and their movements grew calmer.  

Li Shiming didn’t stop until their bodies became nearly transparent.  

With a flick of his finger, he sent a pulse of spiritual energy into the banner, causing a faint array of runes to emerge.  

---  

"Draw the Dragon!" As his spiritual energy swept over the runes, the array fully manifested.  

"Dot the Eyes!" Two bright spots appeared on the array, and Li Shiming activated the "Dragon-Dotting Technique" to tap them.  

The "Dragon-Dotting Technique" was indeed a divine skill for refining artifacts. The "Five Ghosts Soul Refining Banner" was now his.  

Of course, the refinement level was minimal, but since he didn’t need the banner for combat, this was sufficient.  

With a light shake, five translucent ghostly figures drifted out of the banner.  

"This defies science!" Li Shiming had lost count of how many times he’d uttered this soul-deep lament since entering the cultivation world.  

The five ghostly figures before him proved the existence of spirits in this world, and through the banner, he could determine their fate with a single thought.  

The ghosts relied on resentment for power, but now, with barely any left, they existed solely due to the banner’s support.  

Li Shiming noticed that the ghosts seemed to possess little intelligence. He could sense everything about them, including their emotions—fear and terror dominated their minds, with the cognitive level of a three-year-old.  

Further testing revealed that despite their weakened state, these ghosts could still overpower any mortal martial artist in the secular world.  

Most importantly, with the banner nearby, the ghosts could take turns resting, effectively functioning as a perpetual motion machine.  

The idea of perpetual motion made Li Shiming pause in thought.  

It seemed feasible—using the ghosts as a power source.  

He had another "Five Ghosts Soul Refining Banner," meaning ten ghosts in total.  

In his machine room space, the diesel generator was still running. He had stockpiled plenty of diesel, filling several storage bags and large barrels within the space.  

But without replenishment, the diesel would eventually run out.  

His original plan had been to develop electricity-generating talismans to solve the power issue.  

Now, he had a preliminary alternative to free himself from diesel dependency.  

Using the ghosts as a power source, they could drive the generator. When one group tired, another would take over, while the exhausted ones rested inside the banner.  

---  

As for security in the machine room space, he had no intention of taking the banner out. Moreover, given the ghosts’ limited intelligence, there was no risk of them exposing the space.  

With this in mind, he purified the second banner using the same method and refined it with the "Dragon-Dotting Technique."  

Next, he redesigned the generator in the IBM z15 to accommodate ghostly power. By calculating the exact strength of the ghosts, he determined the optimal generator size.  

The clean, efficient power source allowed him to maximize the limited space in the machine room while achieving ideal electricity output.  

The generator modification didn’t take long. Materials were already prepared, and retrofitting the existing generator wasn’t labor-intensive.  

The key advantage was the ten ghosts. With their assistance and his mental coordination, work progressed swiftly.  

The ghosts, unaffected by heat, could even help shape components.  

By the end of the day, a unique perpetual motion generator was born.  

Three ghosts positioned themselves at the rotor, each pushing a fixed blade. Their combined efforts spun the rotor effortlessly.  

In an instant, ghostly figures flitted about, shrouded in eerie mist as they powered the generator.  

Aside from the unsettling visual effects, the performance was excellent.  

Each ghost exerted over two hundred kilograms of force, and their rapid movements kept energy consumption minimal.  

Dizziness from spinning wasn’t an issue—ghosts didn’t suffer from such limitations.
