# Chapter 221: Extreme Amplification

He lowered his head to look at his trouser leg, which had been burned to nothingness.

In the next instant, he forcefully drew a breath, and the劲力 (Jin Strength) within his body burst forth. The Yanling Blade suddenly slashed horizontally seven times, weaving a silver net of blade qi in front of Xu Yunfan's chest.

However, the six-pronged crystal lattice on the heart-protecting mirror of the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly turned crimson, and the reverse scales on his chest flipped outward by forty-five degrees. The blade qi was refracted by the armor's slope toward Chu Mo's position.

"It truly is a Divine Weapon!!"

Chu Mo, standing to the side, was ecstatic. How could he not understand that the close-fitting scale armor Xu Yunfan wore was the true foundation of the Divine Weapon Ridge?

Standing beside him, Yuwen Chengji was even more agitated, staring intently at the scales that kept opening and closing with Xu Yunfan's every movement.

Such close-fitting, irregularly shaped armor was extremely rare. A single layer of robe could conceal it.

"Come on!"

Chu Mo grinned ferociously and swung his nine-section whip. The end of the steel whip cracked with three startling peals of thunder.

Yet, in that lightning-fast moment, Xu Yunfan completed three breathing adjustments. The Xuan Steel Hundred-Refining Body allowed the gaps between his ribs to expand by half an inch, and his chest cavity instantly inhaled twice the amount of air.

When the steel whip struck the shoulder pauldron of the Dragon Scale Armor, the accumulated Red Serpent Mountain-Splitting Strength suddenly erupted!

*Clang!*

The nine-section whip, like a viper biting an anvil, recoiled violently. A force so great that even he could barely withstand transmitted back along the whip. Chu Mo's tiger's mouth split open, blood seeping between his fingers.

He looked at the fifteenth steel ring of the whip in disbelief—it was dented. Xu Yunfan had actually used the shockwaves generated by the shifting of his scapula to redirect the whip's force into the ground.

The blue stone ground cracked like a spider's web for seven feet, and molten heat surged from the fissures.

Xu Yunfan had now entered the extreme state of the Lin Character State. With the Lin Character Mantra at the minor success level, his control over his own body in this state far surpassed that of the entry stage. He凝聚 (condensed) every ounce of strength within his body without letting any leak, and with the trembling of his muscles, he continuously elevated his power to new heights.

Moreover, with every breath, a few particles of Primordial Spirit Qi from the air would enter his body through his nasal orifices, continuously nourishing him.

In his Hyper-Sensory State, he could clearly see the trembling trajectory of Qin Lie's right deltoid fibers, and his eardrums could capture the subtle sounds of Chu Mo's foot arch fascia stretching.

At this moment, Qin Lie had already rushed to his side with his blade. Xu Yunfan's Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly swept horizontally. Under the extreme催吐 (catalysis) of the Red Serpent Mountain-Splitting Strength, the hammerhead was entwined with thunder and fire, and the air exploded like muffled thunder, terrifying to the extreme.

The instant the spike at the end of the hammer handle locked onto Qin Lie's blade back, Xu Yunfan's waist and hips suddenly twisted one hundred and eighty degrees.

The Xuan Steel Hundred-Refining Body launched fully. His spine opened and closed outward like tectonic plates by three inches. The outline of the muscles on his back, visible through the翕动 (fluttering) of the Dragon Scale Armor plates, revealed clear muscle striations.

Qin Lie only felt a monstrous force, like a collapsing mountain or a surging sea, transmit from the hilt. His Yanling Blade was actually bent into an arc by sheer force.

Chu Mo seized the opening and lashed his whip toward Xu Yunfan's throat, the steel cone at the end of the nine-section whip stabbing straight toward the Tian突 (Pressure Point).

But the neck armor of the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly sprang open thirty-six crescent scales. The moment the whip tip touched them, sparks flew everywhere.

The battlefield fell silent for a time. Qin Lie and Chu Mo retreated several steps, both looking at Xu Yunfan, who stood there calmly and composedly, with expressions of doubt and apprehension.

"How is this possible?!"

Chu Mo's face was almost twisted. From Xu Yunfan's martial aura, he could clearly perceive that the other party was only at the Muscle Refining Realm. Even if his blood energy was absurdly thicker than that of a typical Muscle Refining cultivator, his physical body was unreasonable, and he wore Divine Weapon armor, it shouldn't be the case that the two of them were being suppressed and beaten so thoroughly.

Xu Yunfan straightened up and slowly exhaled a breath.

"The test is over."

With a calm expression, he said this indifferently and set down the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand. His palm touched the Xuan Steel Mechanism Box slanted across his back.

Zhan Yan, standing nearby, silently retreated to a corner.

Back at the Divine Weapon Ridge, the power displayed by the Divine Weapon, the Gilded Cudgel, was truly terrifying.

He flicked the mechanism with a snap. The Xuan Steel Mechanism Box made a crisp sound of gold and jade colliding. The moment it sprang open, a sound like the striking of metal and stone rang out from Xu Yunfan's scapula.

The Gilded Cudgel had not yet left its sheath; only the dragon-head pommel had sprung from the box. Yet, magma-like flowing fire already gushed from the sheath's缝隙 (gap). The ground within a radius of ten zhang was covered by this visible aura, and the ground began to crack.

"Another Divine Weapon?!!"

Qin Lie and Chu Mo were shaken to their core, the sound of swallowing repeatedly rising in their throats.

To think that a mere Muscle Refining Realm cultivator would carry two Divine Weapons on his body. Moreover, judging by the effortless manner in which he wielded them, he clearly felt no pressure at all.

These two Divine Weapons seemed to have both recognized him as their master, capable of unleashing extreme power.

He suddenly recalled the half-severed peak at the Divine Weapon Ridge, and the fresh, piercing wound in the middle of it.

Not far away, Yuwen Chengji could hardly maintain the demeanor of a noble son of a prestigious family; his expression was twisted. He subconsciously touched the long sword at his waist.

He, Yuwen Chengji, was the Second Young Master of the Northern Border Garrison Manor in the Great乾 (Qian) Empire. He had been pampered since childhood, swallowing spiritual pills and miraculous medicines like candy.

But to this day, his most precious treasure was the Treasure Grade long sword bestowed upon him by the Great Qian Emperor.

And before him, Xu Yunfan, not to mention the Dragon Scale Armor he wore, but even the weapon in his hand was of the Divine Weapon tier.

Chu Mo's pupils contracted violently.

He clearly saw the tiny Dragon Scale Armor plates on Xu Yunfan's forearm begin to蠕动 (writhe). The muscles and tendons were presented without reservation, twisting into the shape of a python. The fluttering armor leaves writhed like living things along with the knotted muscle fibers.

This was the phenomenon of "Blood Python Entwining Tendons," a phenomenon unique to the Marrow Cleansing Realm. Yet, it was appearing on a Muscle Refining Realm martial artist right now.

"Retreat!"

Qin Lie's roar carried a metallic, grating tremor. As his long sword thrust forth, his劲力 (Jin Strength) surged, and a three-foot blade aura flickered at the tip.

However, the hum of the Gilded Cudgel leaving its sheath was faster. The sound was like a thousand wasps beating their wings simultaneously, or like a red-hot iron rod plunged into ice water.

Xu Yunfan's right wrist shook lightly, and the Gilded Cudgel drew nine afterimages in the air.

The first afterimage collided with Chu Mo's nine-section whip. The seemingly light contact caused the whip, forged of red iron, to shatter completely.

The spiral劲力 (Jin Strength) of the Nine-Anti-Dragon Cudgel Method drilled directly into the bone marrow through the weapon, causing Chu Mo's face to change drastically.

*Crack!*

The next afterimage struck Chu Mo. Seven blood flowers suddenly exploded on his right arm, and his white ulna pierced through the skin and flesh.

As he stumbled backward, Xu Yunfan had already taken his third step.

The flowing fire on the surface of the Gilded Cudgel suddenly solidified, wrapping itself in the unique spiral aura of the Red Serpent Mountain-Splitting Strength, churning the air within a three-zhang radius into a thunderfire vortex.

The blade aura Qin Lie slashed struck the edge of the vortex and was actually弹开 (deflected) as if hitting a living creature.

This Marrow Cleansing Realm master finally changed his expression. The劲力 (Jin Strength) he had poured into his blade was being消解 (dissolved) layer by layer by the nine-fold叠加 (superimposed) shock force within the vortex.

Such was the power currently displayed by the Gilded Cudgel!

The Gilded Cudgel suddenly shifted from vertical to horizontal. The flowing fire on the cudgel's body dragged out a trail of scorching heat in the air, accompanied by the roar of a dragon.

Chu Mo barely managed to raise his left arm, but the moment it touched the blazing aura喷吐 (spewed) by the Gilded Cudgel, his entire arm twisted and shattered as if stuffed into a stone mill.

The shattered bone fragments had not yet hit the ground before they were burned into blackened powder by the flowing fire. Marrow Cleansing originally further strengthened the bones; this step involved the marrow generating blood and the blood energy生发 (flourishing). Yet, it was scorched black by this single cudgel's flowing fire.
