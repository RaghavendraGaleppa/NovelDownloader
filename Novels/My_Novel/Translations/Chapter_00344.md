# Chapter 344: The Five Sects Part Ways, the Dust Settles; Cai Shang Defeated, a Great Fall

On the Snow Lake, two figures were locked in a fierce battle. The White Snake Soft Sword coiled, struck, thrust, lifted, and tore—every move was ruthless and incredibly诡奇 (strange and bizarre). Yet, to say it was without feeling would be entirely wrong. Wen Cai Shang’s swordsmanship was profound, proficient in all Dao, her capability truly terrifying. However, there was a single weak spot that Li Xian had firmly grasped and refused to let go of.

Li Xian轻松 (easily) neutralized all sword techniques. This duel fully displayed his might. Even if Wen Cai Shang exhausted all her tricks, injuring him by a hair's breadth was but an impossible dream. Only during this battle did he truly understand the vast gap between the "Great Self" realm and the "Peak" realm. And the gap between the Peak realm and the "Perfection" realm was just as vast.

If Wen Cai Shang had used the sword techniques of other sects—superior moves like the "Avici Sword," "Three Parts Return to Origin Sword," or "Impermanence of All Things Sword"; or even mid-tier sword arts like "Divine Wind Retrospective Sword" or "Polar Light Phantom Sword," or low-tier ones—she could have easily defeated Li Xian.

But the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" simply wouldn't work. How could she not be angry? How could she not be annoyed? When had she ever suffered such a great loss? Her swordplay grew increasingly chaotic. Several times, she tried to take a hit with her body to disrupt Li Xian's rhythm. But the difference in their swords was too great; all of Wen Cai Shang's strategies were useless.

She only felt the sword intent gathering, growing increasingly thick and heavy. On the lake surface, Yin and Yang qi swirled, forming a black-and-white millstone. With every few exchanges between the two, the black-and-white millstone turned a fraction. Li Xian and Wen Cai Shang, enduring the grinding of the millstone, could have bad luck, misfortune, bodily toxins... all sorts of unfavorable things ground away and eliminated.

This was the second level move of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, "Yin-Yang Divine Disk." When this move was unleashed with full power, the Yin-Yang millstone could cover a radius of several miles. With a turn of the millstone, an opponent trapped by the Yin-Yang qi would be绞杀 (ground and killed), making survival difficult. Meanwhile, the grass, trees, stones, and wood within the disk would become vibrant and flourishing, grass and trees bearing fruit, rough stones containing precious jade—an infinite variety of miraculous effects. It could be used for healing, defense, strengthening the body... But even for the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple," this move was not easily unleashed. It required favorable weather, terrain, and human conditions; a chance opportunity was indispensable.

Li Xian's mastery of the first and second levels far surpassed that of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple. He could summon this move at will, which was truly a great marvel. Had he used it during the earlier battle with the Five Mountain Sword Alliance, the alliance would have been defeated swiftly. No matter what techniques they used—Phantom Sword, Heavy Sword, Fast Sword, Soft Sword, Light Sword—all would have been ground away by the disk.

Yet, Li Xian had saved it to deal with his wife. Wen Cai Shang was furious but couldn't help but praise, "Good swordsmanship!" She moved her body in harmony with the sword. Although she couldn't do anything to Li Xian, she deeply reaped the benefits. Yin and Yang bathing the body, nourishing Yin and strengthening Yang, extending life and restoring vitality, regulating qi and smoothing the will... These benefits didn't manifest as increased strength or combat power, but rather in all aspects. Future martial path advancement would be smoother, allowing her to reach higher heights.

She valued the "Yin-Yang Essential Principles" of the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword," not the quality of the sword techniques. Although superior sword arts were powerful, she had already learned several and wouldn't be so obsessed with them. But the involvement of Yin and Yang was extremely rare. She had苦习 (painfully practiced) the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" precisely to harness Yin and Yang to strengthen herself. Yet, fate was a trickster. Despite her painstaking cultivation and comprehension, she couldn't achieve it. A casual reward, however, allowed Li Xian to reach this state first.

Her heart ached: "If only this kind of man would stay by my side乖乖 (obediently) and assist me well, how wonderful would that be." Her beautiful eyes turned red, as if tears were about to fall. Li Xian斜挑 (slanted and lifted) his sword, catching the tear, and comforted, "My Lady, don't cry."

Wen Cai Shang knew she was no match for Li Xian. Annoyed, she spat, "I was blind, I misjudged you. Do I need you to管 (manage) me even when I cry?" Li Xian said, "I can't bear to see you cry. Besides, I know you're speaking out of anger."

Wen Cai Shang cursed, "Who's speaking out of anger? What I said is absolutely true." With that, she thrust her sword twice more fiercely. Li Xian could have easily dodged, but he took the blows with his physical body, blood gushing from the wounds. Wen Cai Shang was startled, both pained and angry: "You bastard, you... you..." Her voice softened a bit as she asked, "Why didn't you dodge!"

Li Xian smiled, "Right now, our swords are united, our hearts connected. Though your sword is ruthless, it hides no killing intent. After all, I schemed against you, so taking two sword strikes is to hope you can vent your anger."

Wen Cai Shang sneered and shouted, "Two strikes are not enough to vent my anger. If you have the guts, take these two strikes as well." Her sword technique was vicious, aiming to slash at Li Xian's feet. She thought fiercely in her heart: "This kind of man, even if his legs are left, they're only for running away. What use are they? Better to just chop them off!" Li Xian回剑 (retracted his sword) to defend, blocking the strike.

Wen Cai Shang said, "Hmph, you were indeed acting." Enraged, her sword techniques became even more ruthless. Li Xian拨开 (parried) her sword edge and said, "I wasn't acting, but if you want to chop off my legs, I won't be able to walk."

Wen Cai Shang said, "You say this and that, but in the end, you only think of yourself. When it comes to such moments, you're unwilling and reluctant. I guess you never truly loved me."

Li Xian shook his head and said, "If there were danger, I would naturally be willing to risk my life to save you; that is affection. But for you to乱 (randomly) injure me to vent your anger—yes, I, Li Xian, come from a lowly background, but I still have self-respect. How can I use my body's injury to exchange for your momentary pleasure?"

Wen Cai Shang said, "Good, good, this is your true thought." Seeing Li Xian's firm expression, she was momentarily at a loss for words. She thought: "Why do I always end up hurting him? My original intention was not to hurt him. When he hurts, I hurt too. But it always ends with me having to hurt him. What he says actually makes sense..." In that instant, she was extremely confused and swept her sword several times in a横扫 (horizontal sweep).

Li Xian侧身 (sidestepped) to avoid it. Wen Cai Shang kicked with her left leg. Li Xian顺势 (seized the opportunity) to grab,卸下 (stripping off) her other boot. Wen Cai Shang felt her feet go cold, the soles of her feet beaten by the cool wind as she stood on the ice.

She couldn't help but clench her silver teeth. In her entire life, when had she ever suffered such humiliation? During the sword duel, she wasn't his opponent, and on top of that, she had her hairpin removed and her boots taken. Li Xian said, "Once I have mastered my skills, I will naturally return to serve you. If you are angry then, you can just hit me." Wen Cai Shang said, "How shameless. Who would believe such nonsense? Even if it were true, by then, I would have already found another husband. Who would even look at you? Even if you wanted to see me, I would ignore you completely."

Li Xian sighed softly. The grudges of the Jianghu are truly difficult to judge as right or wrong. He said, "Then I will beat up your new husband." Wen Cai Shang sneered, "If I find a new husband, he will surely be a thousand or a hundred times better than you. How could you beat him up?"

Li Xian said, "If I can't beat him up, then I will die by his sword." Wen Cai Shang's heart trembled. As their swords crossed, she knew Li Xian's words were sincere and he truly meant it. She stubbornly said, "Hmph, if you die by his sword then, I won't bury you. I'll leave you to be eaten by wild dogs, your corpse without a proper place."

Li Xian smiled, "What does it matter? Since I am dead, it's just a残躯 (broken body). Let it be trashed as it pleases. As long as I am guiltless in life, that is enough." Wen Cai Shang was speechless for a moment. Her beautiful eyes were deep and distant, as if sighing or resentfully cursing, "I hate this carefree attitude of yours so much."

At this time, her internal qi became increasingly difficult to调用 (mobilize). The various evolutions of the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" were gradually affecting Wen Cai Shang's body. A martial artist who has trained to "Body as Heaven and Earth" has their body as a "Heaven and Earth" within itself, bones like mountains, blood like rivers... Now, Yin and Yang swirled unceasingly within this Heaven and Earth, obstructing its operation. Grass and trees bowed, rivers stood still... The principle was profound and abstruse. Wen Cai Shang's expression changed slightly. She never expected that a set of "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" could possess such capability.

Wen Cai Shang suddenly felt the sword intent fluctuating, neither close nor distant. Li Xian was gradually succeeding in his aim and wanted to leave. Wen Cai Shang hated this sword intent immensely, but when she wanted to dispel it, she realized Li Xian was about to leave. All her anger, all her resentment, all her ferocity... turned into a thick unwillingness to part. She had never lowered her head to anyone in her life, but now she tremblingly pleaded, "Li Lang... please don't go, okay?"

Li Xian paused. That lingering, mournful plea lingered in his heart. Who was Wen Cai Shang? For her to plead like this was truly a rare event in a thousand years. Li Xian thought: "Ah... does my Lady have such deep feelings for me? Must I really leave? If I leave, wouldn't I be辜负 (betraying) her true heart? In the depths of my heart, I too am unwilling to leave, willing to stay with her. But... if I don't leave, my life will终究 (ultimately) not be in my own hands." His mind was filled with complex feelings.

Wen Cai Shang saw Li Xian staring blankly, his eyes filled with extreme complexity. This man, who was naturally carefree, was also纠结 (torn) for her. Unable to control her love and pity, she followed the sword intent and threw herself into Li Xian's arms. Her love had taken deep root. She said, "Good Li Lang... I'm sorry, I only ask... I only ask that you stay by my side forever."

Their hearts pounded. At this moment, their affection was deep and intense. They were truly in love, but unfortunately, the world was complex, and their natures were hard to逆 (go against). In that instant, all distracting thoughts vanished, and they merged completely like water.

Their passion was like fire,煮世 (boiling the world) for three days.

In Flying Dragon City, the mystery was散 (dispelled), and all matters were settled. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance had suffered losses, but they had successfully formed an alliance. The disciples of each sect, having experienced险阻 (hardships and obstacles), had their friendships strengthened.

The five leading elders, each leading their own sect's disciples, purchased travel rations and clothes, rented merchant ships and carriages, and left Flying Dragon City one after another. The Hushan Sword Sect had many water systems and could reach Hushan directly via water routes.

The women boarded their respective boats, sailing down the river, waving goodbye to the Yangshan, Jiushan, Yueshan, and Lishan Sword Sects. The various sword sects热情 (enthusiastically) saw them off, waving from the shore. The riverbank was lively for a time.

The disciples felt a sense of melancholy. The Jianghu road is long, the sky high, the earth wide. Although the Five Mountain Sword Sects had formed an alliance, after this separation, it was unknown when they would meet again. Mu Hongchou stood on the deck,遥遥 (distantly) gazing at Flying Dragon City.

As the merchant ship sailed out of Flying Dragon City, the women couldn't help but keep looking back. They never expected that the trip to Flying Dragon City would involve so many events. Mu Hongchou and the other women looked at the surging river and the clear blue sky, their minds vast and uncertain. They murmured to themselves: "We came to Flying Dragon to form an alliance. Initially, we made many young friends and were very happy. Later, we suddenly suffered a great变故 (change), imprisoned and harmed by villains. After many twists and turns, we finally preserved our lives and completed our mission. It's just that we don't know if we will ever meet that young man again in this lifetime. The Jianghu road is long, the sky is round and the earth is square, the floating world is vast. To encounter a young master like him is truly fortunate. But it's precisely because the world is too big that once we part, it will be vast and difficult to meet again. It makes one..."

Waves upon waves urged the ship onward. The weather was excellent that day, yet it生 (gave rise) to melancholy. When the merchant ship turned a river bend, Flying Dragon City was no longer visible.

The Yueshan Sword Sect was the second to leave. Yueshan was located further away, and the journey would take longer. Following the advice of passing merchants, they could first travel two hundred li by carriage to the "Luosong River" ferry, then take a passenger boat north. This would save over a hundred li of travel.

Since the leading elder Wang Zongheng had spoken, the Yueshan elders Su Changning, Yang Piaoxue, Yuan Baoxiao, and Zhao Chunxia had discussed the route overnight and arranged for the disciples to prepare to return to the sect.

Now, preparations were complete. The disciples, dressed neatly, wearing sword crowns and carrying long swords, gathered at the northern city gate of Flying Dragon City. Ji Hui and Wang Long, familiar with the male disciples of the Yueshan Sword Sect, were chatting in groups.

The Jiushan, Lishan, and Yangshan Sword Sects were also prepared to leave, but they had some matters to attend to, so they were slightly delayed. They had come to the gate to see off the Yueshan Sword Sect.

The elders exchanged pleasantries at the gate, laughing and talking. Zhao Chunxia saw her two disciples and walked over slowly, asking, "Hui'er, Long'er, are you adapting well after returning to the sect?"

Ji Hui cupped her fists and said, "Senior brothers and sisters are kind and treat me well." Wang Long said, "I have already约定 (agreed) with Senior Brother Yue Kai and several junior brothers. Once we return to the sect, we will arrange a sparring match."

Zhao Chunxia smiled, "That's good. Our Jingchun lineage originally came from the Yueshan Sword Sect. Although our sect members suffered at the hands of villains during this alliance formation, adding many twists and turns, the sect's foundation is undeniable, and it will be stronger in the future. Now, as the world approaches chaos, and Flying Dragon City is in a remote location, yet He Wentian dared to plot and rise, it is enough to show that the great trend is chaotic."

"Hui'er, Long'er... after this incident, you should know the dangers of the Jianghu and must not slack off. If you can seize the opportunity and make a name for yourselves, it would naturally be a great fortune for the sect. But if you cannot, at least you must have the ability to保命 (preserve your life) and立身 (establish yourselves)."

Ji Hui and Wang Long cupped their fists and said, "We respectfully heed our Master's teachings; we have记 (remembered) them in our hearts." The sects finished their pleasantries. The disciples and elders of the Yangshan, Lishan, and Jiushan Sword Sects all performed a sword salute to see them off, saying loudly, "Wishing senior brothers, junior brothers, senior sisters, and junior sisters a smooth journey."

Wang Zongheng laughed heartily, "Thank you." He shouted loudly, "Return to the sect." The disciples left in a grand procession. The three great sword sects watched them go far and sighed, "After this parting, it will be even more desolate." "Yes, when we first arrived at Flying Dragon City, the disciples of each sect made friends and sparred, hunted in the mountains, drank and talked. How high-spirited, how lively. Although we elders didn't say much, we were happy to see it." "Who knew that these things would happen midway? Well, good or bad, it's all in the past. But this incident is truly unforgettable."

Hearing this, the disciples all showed a look of nostalgia. It all started with a temple fair, when Lady Wang went to burn incense. At that time, Lady Wang was true to her word, beautiful and generous. Yue Kai, Hua Wu... and other heroes of the sword sects were the first to make friends. Later, there was the snowy mountain hunt. The disciples of each sect, senior and junior brothers and sisters... those of similar age, each found someone they took a liking to, and the younger generation met. Among them, there were no lack of men and women forming relationships, falling in love. Afterwards, there were the Spirit Fox Banquet, many wine feasts, many lively activities, and their feelings grew deeper.

Strolling the streets, sightseeing, shopping... Then, the senior and junior sisters went missing, the disciples surrounded and captured the flower thief, and then they误入 (accidentally entered) the Nine Apertures Dragon Heart Cave, experiencing many dangers. Finally, they合力 (joined forces) to set up a formation and fought their way out... All these events.

The trip to Flying Dragon City was short, but it was chaotic and very exciting. Although some fellow sect members died here, this journey was extremely worth remembering.

Now, the Yueshan Sword Sect traveled along the road, leaving Flying Dragon City. The disciples were also filled with a thousand feelings and ten thousand recollections, their minds in a complex state. After walking more than ten li, they all kept their heads down and hurried on, not knowing if they were happy or sad,庆幸 (relieved) or reluctant to part.

Ji Hui suddenly asked, "Master, that Lady Wang... since we have already cleared the misunderstanding with Lady Wen, we can say we became acquainted through fighting. Won't she see us off a bit?" Zhao Chunxia had been staring blankly. Hearing her disciple's question, she explained, "That Lady has a strange temperament; it's better she doesn't see us off. Hui'er, why do you ask about this?"

Ji Hui's cheeks flushed, "Just curious." Zhao Chunxia said, "Just curious? Do you want to see that Lady, or do you want to see that Li Xian?"

Ji Hui's face turned completely red, "How... how could that be? That Lady and that Li Xian look like they are deeply in love, getting along very well. I... why would I want to see him? Mas... Master, what you're saying is so groundless."

Zhao Chunxia sighed, "Li Xian is indeed extraordinary. It's normal for you to have a crush on him when you first saw him." Ji Hui stammered, "Mas... Master..." She looked around and pleaded, "Please speak softer."

Zhao Chunxia said solemnly, "But Hui'er, there is one thing you need to think clearly. A man like Li Xian is绝非 (definitely not) a good match. If you like him, there will surely be more sorrow than joy. And yet... and yet, he may not even know you have a crush on him. You would suffer and be tormented for him, your heart悬 in the air (up in the air), worried and uncertain. In the end... it would just be you alone, empty and sad."

Ji Hui's pretty face turned pale, her steps unsteady. Zhao Chunxia gently patted Ji Hui's shoulder and advised kindly, "You've only known him for a few days and exchanged a few words. Why be so obsessed? Cut off these thoughts early, and you can save yourself much suffering and torment."

Ji Hui's lips turned pale, her eyes rimmed red. She nodded, "Yes... Master is right." She didn't notice that Zhao Chunxia's hand was trembling slightly, her own mood not calm either.

Her beautiful eyes seemed to hold resentment as she cursed into the air, "Knows no limits." She then left with the sword sect members. The Jianghu is full of chaos, parting and reuniting. There is no banquet that doesn't end. The great feast of Flying Dragon City finally had its time to disperse.

That day.

The Hushan and Yueshan Sword Sects left first. The Jiushan and Yangshan Sword Sects departed east and west. The Lishan Sword Sect was half a day later, and then they led their sect away. Flying Dragon City was as noisy as before, only lacking the sword sect members.

Now, to the other side. Deep in the Snow-Covered Mountain, the ice on the lake surface melted, the clear water rippled. Fish chased each other, the surrounding grass and trees were full of life, warm and cozy, as if it were a vibrant spring scene. It turned out that Yin and Yang blended here, causing warm and cold alternations, bringing spring first.

Fortunately, this place was remote and rarely visited. Even woodcutters would find it hard to set foot here. The strange scenery lasted for three days, yet no one noticed. Because the climate was warm, the birds and beasts of the dense forest, to avoid the cold, all gathered near the lake surface.

The branches were filled with birds and beasts. In the early morning, the birds sang happily. They flew and played among the trees, picking fruits and catching fish. Precisely because of this, they covered up the continuous strange sounds from a patch of flowers.

The birds and beasts were naturally curious. They saw a long sword插 (stuck) horizontally in a large tree, the handle emitting a faint fragrance. The birds stood on the sword body and chirped, pecking at the sword body with their beaks, making a tinkling sound. But there were always careless birds and beasts, playing without restraint, having their beaks or claws削去 (slashed off) by the sword edge... or simply being cut in half by the sword edge.

In the distant mud, a青剑 (green sword) was插 (stuck)斜 obliquely. It received no attention from the beasts, lonely and desolate.

[You have painstakingly practiced swordsmanship, the third level of the Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword, proficiency +1]

Not far from the two swords, a dense patch of grass could be seen, the grass nearly as tall as a person, bearing yellow, white, and red flowers. They were just wild flowers, attracting bees and also drawing the attention of birds and beasts.

These birds and beasts had未开灵智 (uncultivated spiritual intelligence), so they couldn't悟 (comprehend) any profound principles. Suddenly, the grass patch moved. The birds flapped their wings in alarm and fled, flying to the high branches to watch. They blinked and observed. Although their spiritual intelligence was low, their curiosity was irrepressible.

Wen Cai Shang's face was red, her lips moist. She leaned against Li Xian's chest and said softly, "Li Lang, I said a lot of angry things before, please don't blame me." She gently caressed Li Xian's cheek and spoke softly.

Li Xian said, "I don't blame you, my Lady." Wen Cai Shang smiled gently, "Then let's go back. About our previous argument, no one can bring it up again."

Li Xian shook his head and said, "My Lady, I... still have to go." Wen Cai Shang's face turned cold, her brows tightly furrowed: "You..." She had thought that a reconciliation would have passed this hurdle.

Li Xian said resolutely, "Please don't blame me, my Lady." He was clear in his heart: "Only if I completely surpass her can I make her submit. I cannot贪恋 (be greedy for) the temporary gentleness and sink into it!"

Wen Cai Shang gritted her teeth and asked, "You... why do you still want to go? Ah... you bastard, you dare to be disrespectful again!" She showed a look of panic. At this time, the sword intent was deeply gathered, her capability less than a tenth of what it was. But she suddenly felt a pain in both wrists as Li Xian twisted them behind her back.

Li Xian said, "My Lady, I apologize. Please endure for a few days, and someone will come to rescue you." He held the "Green Silkworm Rope" and bound Wen Cai Shang's hands tightly.

Wen Cai Shang already understood. This小子 (brat) was afraid that once she broke free from the sword intent, she would pursue him again. Then he would be hard-pressed to deal with her, so he found a way to capture and bind her. This scheme was extremely meticulous. She was unwilling to be captured, but in this situation, struggling was useless.

She secretly lamented: "Wen Cai Shang, Wen Cai Shang... others can't do anything to you. But this小子's skills were all learned to subdue you. The method he is using to bind me now is the 'Silkworm Garment,' which happens to be what I taught him. That 'Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword' is also what I taught him, intended to restrict him. Who knew that karma would play a trick, and it all became restrictions on me. I... I... am just helpless against him."

Having just left a moment of tenderness, she was now in such a predicament, feeling extremely wronged. She bit her lower lip and shouted in shame and anger, "You... you stop it."

Li Xian used the "Silkworm Garment" technique, his movements light and intricate. He thought: "My Lady is so厉害 (powerful), this time I must bind her firmly. Otherwise, my fate will be truly miserable." He dared not be the least bit careless. This time, the "Silkworm Garment" was much more严密 (tight) than before.

Wen Cai Shang couldn't help but lament. Although she had worn the Silkworm Garment countless times, it was for martial arts advancement. This time, it was used for capture, and the feeling was completely different. She felt extremely helpless and憋屈 (wronged). Her hands and feet were难以控制 (hard to control), let alone anything else. Unfortunately, her great trend had passed, and there was no turning back. She was so angry that her eyes shot fire, but it was truly irreversible.

The silkworm threads攀附 (crawled) up, tightly binding her knee joints, elbow joints, and all parts of her body. The knots were细若无物 (as fine as nothing), extremely complex. If one hadn't learned the "Silkworm Garment Unbinding" method, even if it were laid out right in front of them, it would be hard to loosen it in the slightest.

Wen Cai Shang was furious. She suppressed her shame, her expression icy cold, and said, "Li Xian, I once said that even if I have feelings for you, I will never repeatedly挽留 (retain) a man. You... if you leave again. I... I will really hate you."

Li Xian thought to himself: "If my Lady hates me, let her hate me. By the time my strength has increased, when I see her again, I can be on equal footing with her. Then we can talk about other things."

Wen Cai Shang wanted to say more. Suddenly, she felt two jade walnuts appear in her mouth, and she couldn't utter another word. Her head was covered in black lines. At this moment, she was both angry and ashamed, filled with resentment. She glared fiercely at Li Xian: "This brat had a plan all along. These jade walnuts are my treasure, usually played with when I have nothing to do. When did he steal them? And... and he used them to堵 (block) my mouth, stopping me from speaking. This time, I have suffered a great defeat. My reputation... my reputation is completely ruined, extremely embarrassing."

After a while, Wen Cai Shang couldn't move at all. The prestigious Lady of the Broken Sword was now in an extremely狼狈 (embarrassing) state. Her beautiful eyes were filled with resentment, yet they showed a different kind of charm. She wanted to curse, but her words turned into "呜呜" sounds. Hearing this, she found it hard to accept that she was so狼狈 (embarrassing). Helplessly, she closed her eyes, unwilling to face it. She was utterly dejected and thought to herself: "I was caught in my own trap, caught in my own trap. What a waste of my lifelong reputation. Truly... truly I have栽 (fallen) into his hands. Extremely embarrassing, extremely embarrassing."

Li Xian secretly pondered: "This isn't very stable. Perhaps the techniques learned from the Flower Cage Gate can be used here."
