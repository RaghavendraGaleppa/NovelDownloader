# Chapter 224: The Whole City Celebrates

"Karma Reversion?"

Zhang Jing meticulously contemplated the sudden information that appeared in his mind.

"The demonic blade inherently contains an Innate Karmic Source Sea Restriction, absorbing endless karma to revert to innate, which is called Karma Reversion."

"Karmic Fire, Karma."

As if suddenly realizing something, his eyes instantly brightened.

The Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade was a great divine ability of the ancient immortal path, focusing on attaining longevity through a treasure as one's Dao.

To put it simply, this great divine ability was about cultivating a natal spirit treasure through dual cultivation of essence and spirit.

And the Karma Reversion characteristic—reverting to innate—wasn't that an Innate Spirit Treasure?

"As long as there's enough karma, I can forge an Innate Spirit Treasure demonic blade? But... karma, where can I find a large amount of karma?"

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed.

The Great Cang Realm!

A world entering a Grand Tribulation would surely be permeated with boundless karma.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. At this moment, he wished he could immediately descend there with his true spirit.

However, immediately after, Zhang Jing realized a major problem, and his heart sank.

He would be descending to the Great Cang Realm with his true spirit, not his main body. Could the Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade be brought along? Zhang Jing thought it highly unlikely.

But if he couldn't bring it, how could the demonic blade manifest its Karma Reversion characteristic and absorb endless karma?

After a moment of thought, he mused, "Perhaps if I upgrade it into an Immortal Seed, there might be some hope! Tsk, why think so far ahead? I haven't even forged the Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade yet."

Zhang Jing smiled faintly. His divine sense swept across the Innate Blood Gold Essence in his storage space. Information on how to forge this red karma demonic blade quietly surfaced in his mind.

He closed his eyes once more. The terrifying blade intent, imbued with profound demonic nature, that had permeated his body began to gradually subside, eventually disappearing without a trace, as if it had never appeared.

Of course, that was if one disregarded the lingering expressions of dread on Lu Thirty-Eight and Bing Liangliang's faces outside.

"Boss, what was that aura?"

Barely extricating herself from the terrifying blade intent that seemed to incinerate heaven and earth and slaughter all living beings, Bing Liangliang couldn't help but tightly grip the white fur beneath her small bottom and asked with a look of horror.

Lu Thirty-Eight answered, feigning calmness, "It's probably the Master cultivating some terrifying new divine ability again. You'll get used to it."

Although he was equally filled with fear and doubt at this moment, he absolutely could not show any fear in front of his newly acquired little subordinate. Otherwise, how could he continue to be the boss? So Lu Thirty-Eight subconsciously emulated his Master's usual demeanor.

"But isn't Master also in the Golden Core Realm, just like us?" Bing Liangliang asked incredulously.

She had seen countless Golden Core realm Ice Crystal Spirits within her clan, and even other Golden Core realm beings in the Extreme Ice Plains. Yet, the terrifying blade intent she had just felt seemed completely beyond what a Golden Core realm existence could possess. It could even be said that it far exceeded the limits of the Golden Core realm.

It was precisely for this reason that Bing Liangliang had not immediately connected it to the Master, who was only in the Golden Core Realm.

However, who would have thought—

"Don't be surprised. That's why we call him Master, isn't it?" Lu Thirty-Eight seemed to have long grown accustomed to it. Having followed Master Zhang Jing for so long, what exaggerated scenes hadn't he, Lu, witnessed? He had to remain calm!

Unconsciously glancing at the still dumbfounded Bing Liangliang, Lu Thirty-Eight felt a strange sense of superiority well up in his heart. His boss status was secured!

On the other side, "This is our Master..." Bing Liangliang murmured in her heart, her gaze unconsciously drifting towards Zhang Jing's direction.

At this moment, she felt as if she had truly reacquainted herself with her Master, who usually seemed so gentle and quiet. At the same time, Bing Liangliang also somewhat understood why Master Zhang Jing was able to obtain that decree.

...

The next day.

Outside the small courtyard.

Shasha—

Accompanied by a light footstep, a young figure suddenly appeared before the tightly shut gate of the courtyard.

His gaze fell upon the familiar gate. Li Jie's eyes flickered with hesitation, but only for an instant, before the hesitation was replaced by eagerness.

His breathing unconsciously quickened.

"Li Jie, this might be the only opportunity in your life, you absolutely cannot give up. Besides, Master is so approachable; as long as your attitude is sincere, he definitely won't refuse." Li Jie repeatedly encouraged himself in his heart.

Ever since their last meeting, he knew that his chance to leap out of Sanyuan City and access higher-level inheritances had arrived.

"Continuing to stay in a place like Sanyuan City, without resources, without inheritances, would only waste my talent. Only by cultivating beside Master, and relying on his power, can I rise swiftly and catch a glimpse of the immortal and divine realms."

"Perhaps in the future, I might even have a chance to catch up to or even surpass Master." Li Jie thought with burning passion.

Snapping out of his thoughts,

Thump-thump—

A gentle knocking sound suddenly broke the tranquility of the courtyard.

Soon after, the door slowly opened, and two heads, one large and one small, peered out. Two gazes, imbued with Golden Core realm pressure, instantly fell upon Li Jie.

"Oh, it's you. What's the matter?" Lu Thirty-Eight asked.

"Lord Lu, this humble one has come to express my gratitude for Lord Zhang Jing's life-saving grace." Li Jie lowered his head, answering somewhat nervously.

And in the instant he lowered his head, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. The fervor in his gaze grew even more intense.

"That ice crystal sprite, could it be a legendary natural spirit? And the aura on its body is actually quite similar to Lord Lu's."

"Golden Core Realm!"

"Master actually possesses a precious Golden Core realm natural spirit! Our Dharma Aspect realm ancestors in Sanyuan City don't even have such a thing."

"It seems my previous guess was correct; Master's background is truly extraordinary."

...

...

Time slowly passed.

Inside the room.

"Master's life-saving grace, Li Jie will never forget. I would even serve as an ox or a horse, to be at Master's beck and call."

As he spoke, Li Jie couldn't help but steal a glance at Zhang Jing, who was seated above him. When he saw that the other party's expression hadn't changed at all, his heart sank, and his eyes subtly dimmed.

"Was I too eager?"

Seeing his objective for this trip fall through, Li Jie slowly rose, forced a smile, and respectfully bid farewell, "Then Li Jie won't disturb Master any further. I shall visit again another day."

"You're too kind," Zhang Jing said gently.

Not long after, Lu Thirty-Eight tiptooted in, with Bing Liangliang sitting on his shoulder, entering the room together.

"Master, that person just now, did he want to become your disciple? But his intentions seemed a bit too strong," Lu Thirty-Eight cautiously reminded, as if he had seen something.

The moment his words fell, Bing Liangliang vigorously nodded, "Yes, yes, this human isn't good. He always looks at Liangliang with a very strange gaze, which makes Liangliang very uncomfortable."

As she spoke, Bing Liangliang stood up directly from Lu Thirty-Eight's shoulder, rolled up her small sleeve, revealing dense, tiny ice particles protruding from her arm.

"What is that?" Zhang Jing looked curiously.

"Reporting to Master, these are goosebumps!" Bing Liangliang puffed out her small chest, answering righteously.

Zhang Jing's eye twitched. Was this fellow fooling him? As a Golden Core realm Ice Crystal Spirit, how could she get goosebumps from a mere Foundation Establishment realm cultivator's gaze? No, wait! Could an Ice Crystal Spirit even get goosebumps?

After thinking for a moment, Zhang Jing stated, "Alright, I know what you two mean. Don't worry, even if I intended to take a disciple, it wouldn't be this person, let alone the fact that I have no such plans."

"Master is wise!" Lu Thirty-Eight and Bing Liangliang said in unison.

...

Time passed little by little.

One year, two years, three years...

Sanyuan City remained largely the same as it was initially, as if a short span of time couldn't leave its mark on it. However, the lives of the common people living in the city had quietly changed.

Of course, there were exceptions.

On one street, pedestrians came and went in an endless stream, bustling with activity.

At a certain moment, as a young figure approached, the small vendors on both sides of the street, as well as some of the common folk, stopped what they were doing.

"Good morning, Young Master Zhang!"

"Good day, Young Master."

"..."

Enthusiastic greetings rose one after another.

"Good morning, everyone," Zhang Jing responded gently, a faint smile on his face. His steps, however, did not halt.

In a short while, Zhang Jing's figure disappeared around the street corner.

On the spot, the crowd began conversing again. However, this time, the topic had quietly shifted to Zhang Jing, who had just passed by.

"How strange, how strange! Four or five years have passed, yet the Young Master is still as young as before, not a single change in his appearance."

"Bumpkin, Young Master must be an immortal, and a great figure among immortals at that. Otherwise, why would Captain Li and his son, who are also immortals, be so respectful to him?"

"Thanks to Young Master, our Qing Shen Ward has been famously peaceful these past few years."

"Indeed, it's said that those evil cultivators and demonic beings specifically avoid Qing Shen Ward."

"Young Master is truly a good person."

"Who isn't saying that? In these past few years, Young Master has built who knows how many bridges and repaired how many roads."

...

And at this moment, inside the small courtyard.

As soon as Zhang Jing pushed open the door, he saw Lu Thirty-Eight and Bing Liangliang sprawled on a table, engrossed in studying something.

Perhaps they were too absorbed, for when the sound of the door opening rang out, the deer and the ice crystal spirit instantly jolted, then both turned their heads towards the door.

"Master, you're back!"

Bing Liangliang reacted first, then transformed into a faint blue light that flashed across the air, landing at Zhang Jing's feet.

"Has anything happened these past two days?" Zhang Jing asked with a smile.

"Reporting to Master, while you were out these past two days, fifteen people came, but basically all of them wanted to become your disciples. We sent them all away."

"Oh, and that Li Jie came again." Bing Liangliang counted on her small fingers, listing them one by one.

"He came again? Counting this time, it should be the eighth, shouldn't it?" Zhang Jing couldn't help but frown. He had clearly rejected this person last time, yet he hadn't given up.

"If he comes again next time, tell him I'm not seeing visitors," Zhang Jing said, shaking his head, his tone calm.

"Yes, Master."

On the other side, only after Bing Liangliang had finished speaking did Lu Thirty-Eight walk up to Zhang Jing and hand him an invitation.

"Master, this was sent by the City Lord's Mansion yesterday."

"Oh? City Lord's Mansion, an invitation?" Hearing this, a hint of surprise flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. He took the invitation from Lu Thirty-Eight and opened it to read.

After a long while, he put down the invitation and smiled slightly.

"An Immortal Ascension Feast three months from now?"

"Interesting. The Young City Lord of Sanyuan City actually passed the assessment of the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm, three million li away, successfully joining it and becoming a disciple of the Grand Unity Dao Sect."

"No wonder they're celebrating throughout the city."

Having traveled in the Pure Firmament Profound Bright Heaven for nearly ten years now, Zhang Jing naturally understood how significant it was for a mundane power to have a disciple join the Grand Unity Dao Sect.

Background! Resources!

Everything would be completely different from then on. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it an overnight ascent, even if it was just the lowest-ranked Dharma Realm disciple.

Half an hour later, inside the room.

Behind Zhang Jing's head, a six-layered auspicious cloud slowly rose, with six-colored immortal light circulating erratically.

The next moment, within the Golden Sun of Mind supported by the sixth layer of golden auspicious cloud, a rich purple aura gradually condensed, finally forming a wisp of Post-natal Purple Qi, imbued with a nimble and profound essence.

"One month!"

Feeling the Post-natal Purple Qi condense once again, a faint smile unconsciously appeared in the corner of Zhang Jing's eye.

In these past few years, he hadn't just been waiting for the spiritual land to form; he had done other things. At the very least, his cultivation had not slackened in the slightest.

And as his cultivation grew, the range of the Golden Sun of Mind absorbing miscellaneous thoughts gradually expanded, unconsciously covering the two wards adjacent to Qing Shen Ward: Baima Ward and Chen Village Ward.

Thus, he could now condense a wisp of Post-natal Purple Qi in just thirty days.

And a single wisp of Post-natal Purple Qi could increase his skill experience by thirty to fifty thousand points.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing's heart stirred. The jade talisman within his Niwan Palace immediately trembled slightly.

[Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade • Level Three]

Skill Characteristic: Karma Reversion

Level Four was not far off, and a new skill characteristic... Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed, as if anticipating something.

"Also, once this matter is resolved, I must find a way to forge the true Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade."

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but feel a headache. The Innate Blood Gold Essence gifted by his teacher, the Seven Desires Divine Monarch, was indeed the most suitable material for forging the demonic blade, and it was even an Innate Divine Artifact.

However, the only problem was that it was extremely difficult for his current self to refine.

Simply put, the carriage was too large, and the horse was too small. He couldn't pull it!

Zhang Jing estimated that even his teacher, the Seven Desires Divine Monarch, hadn't expected his progress in mastering this great divine ability to be so fast, and that he would begin forging the Red Karma Demonic Blade so early.

...

...

Three months later.

Zhang Jing slowly walked out of his room, taking a step that instantly brought him outside the courtyard gate.

Immediately, a festive atmosphere greeted him.

Along both sides of the road, grand red ribbons hung from the buildings, stretching as far as the eye could see.

Seeing this sight, Zhang Jing's expression suddenly froze. Even the outermost Qing Shen Ward was decorated so festively? This showed that the Sanyuan City Lord's Mansion's gesture this time was truly significant.

Perhaps, the matter of the Sanyuan City Young City Lord entering the Dao Sect for cultivation held even greater significance for Sanyuan City than imagined.

"Are you two really not going to the feast? There's free food and drink, you know." Zhang Jing suddenly turned his head to look at Lu Thirty-Eight and Bing Liangliang in the courtyard behind him, asking softly.

As his words fell, they both shook their heads in unison.

"Then I won't force you. Master will be back shortly," he said with a faint smile.

Then, a flash of light, and his entire being vanished from the spot.
