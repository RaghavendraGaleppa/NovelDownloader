# Chapter 93 Consuming Mists and Washing with Dew

In the pitch-black desert, dense night fog surged.

Qin Ming fought with all his might, unleashing his strongest strike. Amidst a dazzling radiance like the burning sun, blood splattered, and clearly, crystalline fingers fell to the ground.

"Ah..." The woman let out a painful shriek. The faint golden glow flowing over her entire body became sparse. She quickly retreated, her veil trembling violently, indicating the depth of her shock and pain.

Qin Ming stepped on the yellow sand like a wisp of clear wind, chasing her at extreme speed. Holding the blade body, as pure white as jade, he swung it at the woman once more.

At this moment, his face was clean and handsome, yet incredibly stern, his eyes bright as stars. His dark hair flew backward as he pushed the *Grass-Skimming Movement Technique* to its limits, appearing to fly across the yellow sand.

The veiled woman was shocked, angered, shamed, and indignant. In her eyes, this mere youth, who hadn't even qualified to be a gold-armored guard, had gravely wounded her right from the start.

Four fingers on her slender, beautiful hand had been severed, leaving only a lone thumb stained with blood.

Furthermore, there was also a wound on her chest and abdomen. The pristine white blade tip had cut it open, and as she retreated, blood flowed onto the ground.

This was the most severe injury she had suffered in her entire life.

What was even more terrifying was that the youth was now as fierce as a spirit tiger, uttering not a word, pursuing her closely with a speed that inspired deep dread.

Her glabella glowed, blooming into a brilliant peach blossom before her to block the attack.

The fiery red peach blossom, though imbued with extraordinary power, was still shattered by the pure white blade body. The blade brushed past her, tearing her black robes and breaking parts of her inner armor, almost drawing blood again.

The black-robed veiled woman was furious. Her opponent had brought her too many surprises. How could a youth, who had been scrambling about in a remote area with a blood-stained war hammer, possess such a mutton-fat jade-iron blade?

She could feel that it wasn't cast from alloy, but from pure jade-iron. The blade body was pristine and flawless, without any impurities.

Opening her mouth, she spat out a shower of brilliant light, like numerous flying knives, striking at the youth who pressed forward like a gentle breeze and a flash of lightning.

Qin Ming propelled his Heavenly Light Energy to its utmost, his entire body radiating light. The long blade in his hand vibrated continuously, unleashing wave after wave of pristine white blade light, like layers of surging ocean waves piling up, crashing fiercely forward.

This rare jade-iron blade possessed several marvelous qualities, one of which was its ability to channel Heavenly Light, allowing a Newborn's Heavenly Light Energy to extend along the blade body.

Now, Qin Ming moved with a murderous aura, manifesting his blade intent as if cleaving the boundary between sea and sky. Heavy white waves surged, roaring against the shore, sweeping across the night sky, and dispersing the torrent of light.

The black-robed woman was shocked. How could this youth's Heavenly Light Energy be so overbearing? It could shatter the golden light rain she had unleashed, like a raging flame incinerating paper!

Her heart palpitated. How could this be a youth who had grown up wildly and independently in a remote area?

In her impression, only a select few orthodoxies on the path of the Newborn possessed unfathomable Heavenly Light Energy, and it absolutely should not appear here.

Night fog surged. Qin Ming advanced, blade in hand, uttering no words, continuously unleashing dazzling blade light. He possessed the demeanor of a young grandmaster, unsettling the woman's very spirit.

*Pfft!* Her shoulder was struck again. Although it was just a slight graze, the refined gold inner armor beneath her black robes was actually torn open, like paper, unable to withstand the jade-iron blade.

Blood flowed out, and her arm throbbed with pain. At this moment, the youth in her eyes was radiant, his entire being seemingly enveloped in sacred light, his demeanor transformed. If he weren't savagely attacking with his blade, he would appear even more ethereal.

And if she were an outsider, she would involuntarily cast a glance and utter a compliment. But now, she was filled with immense resentment and rage. This youth had clearly grown increasingly confident, his fighting spirit soaring due to repeatedly wounding her!

The black-robed woman's eyes were filled with malice. She struggled to seize a moment to catch her breath, her glabella erupting with a dazzling flame as if a fierce blaze ignited within.

This was her consciousness power manifesting, ceaselessly driven, even at the cost of severe depletion to her vital energy. Subsequently, two artifacts floated up from her person.

A small black shield, bearing scorch marks, blocked before her, receiving Qin Ming's strike head-on.

A muffled thud sounded, and a terrifying blade mark appeared on the black shield.

This was a treasure bestowed by her sect elders, yet it was damaged the moment it appeared!

Her heart ached. This was a spiritual artifact that could grow with her.

Beside her, a black spear, the length of a chopstick, also appeared as if it had endured thunder and fire, its body charred. It floated, emitting a faint golden glow, aimed at the youth whose presence grew increasingly radiant.

Qin Ming abruptly withdrew his blade and swiftly retreated over ten meters, then stood calmly there. He had now become the composed party.

This was because he saw the woman struggling to activate the two artifacts that looked as if they had been pulled from a bonfire. More importantly, her wounds continued to bleed, and time was on his side.

From the moment he decisively unleashed his strongest blade light, followed by his rapid pursuit and continuous strikes, only two breaths had passed.

All confrontations occurred extremely quickly; such battles often decided life and death in an instant.

After his fourth Rebirth, Qin Ming's perception had greatly increased. Even in the pitch-black desert, he could now discern objects within a certain range.

The veiled woman, severely wounded by a Newborn, felt utterly humiliated. In her eyes, her peers on this nascent, immature path were merely meant to be their guards. Yet, she had suffered a severe loss at the hands of such a person.

Not only did her wounds throb with pain, but her very soul felt as though it had been struck.

As a woman, she naturally cared deeply about her appearance; she had actually lost four fingers!

"This is the darkest and most humiliating day I have ever experienced!" She gritted her teeth, the wound on her chest and abdomen wriggling and faintly glowing, temporarily closing.

Her shoulder and lower body were already covered in crimson blood.

Qin Ming understood her meaning: she looked down upon those on the Newborn path. He spoke indifferently, "Arrogant and self-righteous, nothing but common fowl!"

He generally wouldn't curse, but since her words were unpleasant, he would absolutely not be polite.

"You..." The woman's face twisted in rage. Her veil fell, revealing a beautiful but now ashen-pale face.

She was not old, only sixteen or seventeen. Provoked by the words "common fowl," she pointed at Qin Ming and declared, "I'll make you understand the difference between immortal and mortal right now!"

"Are you complimenting me?" Qin Ming looked at the hand she pointed with.

The woman followed his gaze. The four severed finger stumps had been cauterized by her golden glow, leaving only a lone thumb.

She instantly broke down, because, no matter how she looked at it, it appeared as though she was giving him a thumbs-up.

As an "outsider," one who considered herself transcendent and extraordinary, she couldn't help but "spit fragrance" (curse) at this moment, lest she suffer internal injuries from suppressed anger.

Qin Ming's eyes were deep. He knew well that at this level, one wouldn't easily lose composure. The woman's breakdown was one thing, but she also wanted to actively stall for time.

This was because the golden glow she activated with her consciousness power could heal her wounds.

Most crucially, there was still a mysterious gold-armored guard in the distance, likely approaching the desert. If he found this location, the situation would change again.

"Your four fingers haven't been on the ground for long; they should still be reattached. Don't you want them?" Qin Ming raised his blade, leaping a dozen meters to head towards the severed fingers.

The black-robed woman immediately became anxious. She had led this youth away precisely because she wanted to deal with him before reattaching her fingers. Who knew this handsome youth would start threatening her?

She wasn't very old and was extremely concerned about physical disfigurement, elevating it to a matter of life itself. Therefore, she immediately chased after him with bloodshot eyes.

*Swish!* With a flash of blade light, she saw a severed finger, originally crystalline as jade but now stained with blood and yellow sand, being impaled by the youth's blade.

"Put it down!" She glared, wide-eyed, activating the charred small shield and the chopstick-length black spear, attacking swiftly.

"Alright!" Qin Ming was very compliant. He threw the severed finger, which was resting on his blade, onto the yellow sand, without causing any further damage, and then directly swung his blade at her.

He didn't need to engage in overly provocative actions, because the woman was already in complete disarray. Just fighting in this area was enough; he controlled the entire rhythm of the battle.

Qin Ming activated his mutton-fat jade-iron blade, which could pierce through her golden glow, striking the black shield multiple times. With a *bang*, he shattered it.

The black-robed woman was terrified. This was a treasure bestowed by her sect, and one of them had actually been destroyed. This was not only because the jade-iron blade was special but also because the opponent's Heavenly Light Energy was too unusual, posing a huge threat to her. Her initial manifestation of consciousness power was actually cleaved apart by him.

Her glabella glowed, and wisps of lotus-like golden mist flew out, coiling around the black spear, attacking the increasingly formidable youth.

After several clashes, the charred spear dimmed, and the golden threads wrapped around it were dispersed!

"Clang!"

Qin Ming severed the chopstick-length spear, causing it to fall to the ground, unable to be activated again.

"A weapon refined from a spiritual root that has undergone Heavenly Light Baptism has been destroyed..." The woman's face was devoid of color as she retreated continuously. She knew she had lost thoroughly this time.

*Pfft!* Unable to dodge in time, her left arm was severed, flying with blood and landing on the sand beside her.

She let out a bitter laugh, knowing she could not escape this calamity today.

"To think that we, who consume mists and wash with dew, are of a different realm than you, the mortals, I am actually going to die here."

The black-robed woman had awakened her Heart of Consciousness multiple times in the Mind-Fasting Realm, and was not far from the second major realm. To not have fallen to Mystic Sect members, but to die at the hands of a Newborn, she was extremely unwilling.

If one were to compare the Mind-Fasting Realm with the Newborn path, her awakenings far outnumbered Qin Ming's mere four Rebirths.

At this moment, Qin Ming's entire body flowed with Heavenly Light Energy. The radiant, high-spirited demeanor of the youth was fully revealed; his eyes, brows, and even every single pore radiated light.

"Those who still consume the five grains, dare to claim a difference between immortal and mortal?" He swung his blade, unwilling to delay for even a moment.

The woman fought with all her might, her glabella glowing, a lotus blooming and burning fiercely, flying outward.

However, even such a manifestation of consciousness power could not block Qin Ming's blade, imbued with Heavenly Light Energy. The lotus was shattered, and the blade tip cut across her pearly white forehead, blood splashing.

The woman's face was pale as she slumped to the ground, her skull cracked. She was utterly terrified, finally trembling as she said, "I don't want to die, can you..."

"Who sent you?" Qin Ming asked.

The woman suddenly fell silent again.

"Then be on your way." Qin Ming's blade flashed. Her head rolled off, blood gushed, and her corpse fell onto the yellow sand.

"Mountain Lord Qin has the potential for divinity, he can slay immortals. I suddenly feel... I can persevere to the end!" Yu Que poked her head out of the night fog, muttering softly, "There's still a gold-armored guard left, he should be easier to deal with, right?"
