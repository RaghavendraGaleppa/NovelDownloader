# Chapter 41: Fierce Battle

"Demon, do you truly believe that relying on a seventh-grade grand formation makes you invincible?" Ouyang Haoze, separated by the formation's light barrier, sneered as he looked at Lu Yang. "Formations are ultimately inanimate objects. For us cultivators, our cultivation realm is paramount! In the end, it all comes down to a true test of skill."

Lu Yang's internal alarm bells blared, but his expression remained calm. "If Fellow Daoist has the confidence, you are welcome to enter the formation and fight. Otherwise, it's best to retreat obediently."

"You court death!" Ouyang Haoze grinned chillingly, then actually took a step forward. He exhaled and bellowed, and with a thunderous roar, a mighty sound burst from his throat.

This was a superior divine ability of the Divine Martial Sect, named "Thousand-Mile Sky-Shattering Divine Sound." It involved secretly absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, empowering it with the Divine Martial Sect's unique third-grade true qi, "Divine Martial True Gang," and then releasing it in a single roar. Wherever the sound wave passed, within a thousand miles, friend or foe, all would be pulverized.

In an instant, the intensely fierce divine sound charged into the formation. Formation patterns shattered one after another, and various skeletal soldiers of different forms appeared. The enormous formation was actually blasted open, creating a gaping hole!

Immediately after, Ouyang Haoze took out a round mirror.

"I ask Grandfather Taixiao to act." He formed a hand seal and pointed, sending the round mirror into the air. A magnificent mirror light projected downwards, solidifying the void and actually fixing the opening in the formation!

In that instant, the market city trembled violently! Large numbers of cultivators retreated, daring not to approach the edge of the formation, their faces filled with panic.

Fairy Feixia's face turned pale. The next second, she suddenly looked at Lu Yuanchun, whose expression was peculiar, and sharply ordered, "Stay here! You are not allowed to go anywhere!"

Having been tricked before, Fairy Feixia naturally no longer trusted Lu Yuanchun. At this moment, her beautiful face even showed a hint of ferocity. "If it weren't for Junior Brother Lu, you would already be dead outside the market city. If you dare to try and escape amidst the chaos again, I will kill you first, no matter the consequences!"

"Junior Sister Feixia, you've misunderstood..." Lu Yuanchun gave an embarrassed laugh. Seeing Fairy Feixia's murderous glare, he felt some apprehension and could only suppress the many sinister thoughts that had just arisen.

With the two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators not in disarray, the chaos within the market city quickly subsided. Of course, everyone knew this was only temporary.

The outcome between Lu Yang and Ouyang Haoze was the straw that would break the camel's back. Therefore, Fairy Feixia could only place her trust in Lu Yang now, believing he could create a miracle.

"This is... a spirit treasure?" Lu Yang's expression changed drastically as he looked at the round mirror in the sky. "And it's a supreme Yang spirit treasure specifically designed to counter earthly fiend yin qi, meant to deal with the 'Myriad Skeletons Return to Truth Grand Formation'!?"

Ouyang Haoze threw his head back and laughed heartily, immensely pleased. "The Myriad Skeletons Return to Truth Grand Formation has stood on Skeleton Mountain for many years. Since my Divine Martial Sect dared to plot against it, how could we not have prepared a method to break the formation beforehand? With the 'Grand Clarity Mirror' here, you are dead for sure today!" This spirit treasure was not his personal possession but had been specially refined by a Foundation Establishment True Person of the Divine Martial Sect to counter the Myriad Skeletons Return to Truth Grand Formation. Its power was naturally self-evident.

Above the market city, Lu Yang's expression was grim. Without a word, he turned and ran.

"Hmph! Trying to escape?" Ouyang Haoze didn't hesitate, directly leaping forward. At the same time, he unleashed the divine sound again, instantly pulverizing the surrounding skeletal soldiers, and then pursued Lu Yang.

However, at this moment, an unexpected change occurred! The moment Ouyang Haoze's front foot stepped into the formation, his expression changed. He subconsciously tried to retreat, but when he turned back, he only saw a field of scarlet formation patterns.

"I didn't expect you would actually dare to come in..." Lu Yang stopped his escape, turning to look at Ouyang Haoze. His previous panicked expression seemed to have vanished completely, replaced by a chilling smile.

"This is impossible!" Ouyang Haoze's eye twitched, his expression filled with shock and uncertainty. "The Myriad Skeletons Return to Truth Grand Formation was clearly stabilized by my Grand Clarity Mirror! Why is there still a formation appearing? Is there a second set of formations within the market city? Where did it come from? Why didn't I detect any traces of a formation being set up beforehand?"

"Because I don't need to set up a formation at all..." Lu Yang sneered inwardly. His Blood-Washing Sky River Sword Formation Chart relied entirely on the Blood Sun Sword Pellet, a formation treasure. It formed a formation with a single thought, naturally leaving no traces!

The next second, a flag banner appeared in Lu Yang's hand, fluttering in the wind. The Innate One Qi Myriad Spirits Banner!

As the banner swayed, countless banner spirits flew out in an instant, landing on various nodes of the Blood-Washing Sky River Sword Formation Chart, beginning to act on their own accord.

Lu Yang had incorporated the Innate One Qi Myriad Spirits Banner into the design of this formation long ago. At this moment, tens of thousands of souls from within the banner were arrayed, occupying the formation nodes and manifesting profound mysteries. In an instant, the heavens and earth turned crimson, and a surging river of blood descended from south to north, cascading down upon Ouyang Haoze!

Ouyang Haoze immediately grunted, his body staggering.

Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light! Trapped within the formation, Ouyang Haoze couldn't evade the divine light's power. He only felt his originally vast blood energy rapidly draining from his body like a breached dam.

The next second, he quickly roared, "Heavenly Light Lord, save me!"

Like golden scales reflecting the sun, layers of precious light enveloped Ouyang Haoze. For a moment, it actually stopped the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light's absorption.

A spirit treasure, the Heavenly Light Armor!

This treasure was refined using "Demon-Subduing Heavenly Light" and was inherently antithetical to the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light. The result of their clash was a mutual stalemate.

Only then did Ouyang Haoze finally breathe a sigh of relief. After all, he hadn't anticipated that with his cultivation level, coupled with the Grand Clarity Mirror and Heavenly Light Armor, and such thorough preparations, he would still almost capsize.

"Now, I cannot escape..." Ouyang Haoze's eyes were bloodshot. Instead of planning to flee, he looked towards Lu Yang, deep within the formation, a suffocating killing intent surfacing in his gaze. "...Only a counterattack!" As a true disciple of a sect, his willpower was by no means weak. He understood the principle that "when two brave individuals meet on a narrow path, the braver one wins." He knew that if he focused solely on escaping now, Lu Yang would toy with him until his death. To break the formation, he had to seek life in death, find a way to kill Lu Yang. Once Lu Yang died, the formation would naturally dissipate!

Rumble! The next second, protected by the Heavenly Light Armor, Ouyang Haoze charged towards Lu Yang, his unmatched spear tip pointing directly at the Innate One Qi Myriad Spirits Banner in Lu Yang's hand!

"That banner seems to be the core of this formation. If I can't kill Lu Yang, perhaps destroying it will also provide a path to survival..."

"Good timing!" Lu Yang waved his banner, and a figure emerged—it was Liu Xin. His face was filled with confusion, as if he hadn't fully woken up.

The next second— "Explode!" A thunderous boom! Liu Xin involuntarily opened his mouth and uttered the character 'Kill,' revealing it to be a deadly curse specifically for mutual annihilation!

In Lu Yang's view, Liu Xin's use of the Innate One Qi Myriad Spirits Banner was too superficial. After all, banner spirits were immortal; even if temporarily destroyed, as long as their true spirit didn't dissipate, they could be re-summoned by expending magic power. Given this, why make them fight conventionally? They should be taught suicidal moves! Since they could be revived anyway, having them unleash abilities that harm a thousand enemies while incurring eight hundred self-inflicted wounds—like self-detonation to kill enemies—this was the correct way to use them!

In an instant, a spiritual tide swept through everything.

When the dust settled, Liu Xin was nowhere to be seen, while Ouyang Haoze was forcibly halted mid-air, his expression utterly grim.

Up to this point, he had employed many methods: divine abilities, spirit treasures, and cultivation suppression. Dealing with a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator should have been a walk in the park, yet unexpectedly, none of them yielded any success. Instead, his magic power consumption was immense.

"If this continues, I might truly die here..." As Ouyang Haoze thought of this, a ruthless glint flashed across his face. He formed a hand seal, and then the Heavenly Light Armor on his body suddenly emitted a mournful cry.

"This is... not good!" Lu Yang's expression changed drastically at the sight. His body flickered, instantly teleporting behind the Blood Sun Sword Pellet, then summoning its blood shadow to guard in front of him.

Boom!!! The spirit treasure, Heavenly Light Armor, self-destructed!

The exploding spiritual light, just like the scene Xiao Shiye had created in the past, swept through all directions, instantly shattering Lu Yang's sword formation chart and revealing the clear blue sky.

Although Lu Yang reacted extremely quickly and swiftly closed the formation, Ouyang Haoze was even faster. In the nick of time, he burst out of the formation's encirclement. Lu Yang only managed to unleash the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, stripping another thirty percent of his blood energy, leaving him looking like nothing but skin and bones.

"You destroyed my magic treasure! Unless I tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces, this hatred will not be appeased!" Ouyang Haoze stood outside the market city, his expression ferocious. He actually poured his remaining magic power into his other spirit treasure, the Grand Clarity Mirror, causing it to also emit a mournful wail.

"At most, this Seat will sacrifice all my spirit treasures today! Let's see if you can still conjure a third grand formation!"
