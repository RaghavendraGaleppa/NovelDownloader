# Chapter 159: The Joyous Sect

On the outskirts of the Silver River Market, a red-faced monk bowed obsequiously with an ingratiating smile, recounting his experiences over the past few years to the white-robed young man before him.

"After parting ways with you in haste back then, I left the Yan-Yun Mountain Range. In the following years, I traveled across various immortal cultivation markets within the Great Song Dynasty, searching for any opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage. But as you know, Foundation Establishment Pills are incredibly difficult to obtain. At every auction I attended, I either fell short due to insufficient funds or missed out by a narrow margin."

"Later, I heard that the market in the Huainan region was in a slump, meaning there might be less competition for rare treasures. So I rushed over, hoping to snag a bargain at an auction. Unfortunately..."

"Unfortunately, you ran into me!" Lin Shan grinned as he looked at the fawning red-faced monk before him. He recalled how domineering and arrogant this man had been back in the Yan-Yun Mountain Range—charging at him with a staff, demanding the Joyous Buddha statue he had won at auction. Even after receiving it, the monk had refused to back down, forcing Lin Shan into a fierce battle that left him trapped by a stream with no way forward.

And now? Why was he acting so submissive?

"To be honest, I preferred your unruly demeanor from back then," Lin Shan said leisurely, picking at his fingernails while enjoying the monk's rapid change in attitude. Opportunities to meet old acquaintances in unfamiliar lands were rare, and he intended to savor this moment.

The red-faced monk had no choice but to humble himself under the circumstances. After all, Lin Shan was a full realm above him—a difference as vast as heaven and earth. He couldn't muster the slightest thought of resistance, fearing that Lin Shan might hold a grudge and make things difficult for him.

"How could I dare? Back then, I was blind and failed to recognize your greatness! As the saying goes, how could a sparrow know the ambitions of a swan? Now that you've advanced so remarkably and mastered divine techniques, I've finally awakened to my past folly!"

"Applying the scientific method to observe the objective laws of development, with your unparalleled talent and innate potential, you are destined to dominate the world, command the winds and rains, pluck stars from the sky, chase the moon, and ascend to the immortal realm with a lifespan rivaling the heavens!"

"As the saying goes, 'The great roc rises with the wind, soaring ninety thousand miles in a single day!' Your majestic bearing outshines all contemporaries! With your profound, star-like gaze that pierces through eternity, you survey the countless souls traversing the river of time. Innumerable geniuses and heroes swarm like fish crossing a river, all vying to leap through the Dragon Gate and transform into flood dragons—just to lick a single toe of yours!"

Lin Shan thoroughly enjoyed the monk's impassioned speech, watching as he gesticulated wildly, his words flowing like an unending river until he finally ran out of breath and had to stop.

---

Observing his expression, it seemed the monk was speaking from the heart—and still had more to say!

"Not bad!"  
"Not bad!"  

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord nodded in unison, their eyes filled with appreciation. For a moment, both had been swept up in the fantasy that they were the chosen protagonists of destiny, destined to shake the world and dominate all eras!

At the same time, they developed a keen interest in the red-faced monk's eloquence, recognizing him as a rare talent who shouldn't be left to waste his gifts in obscurity.

"Would you be willing to follow me?"  
"Would you be willing to follow me?"  

Both extended their offers simultaneously, eager to recruit the monk. After a brief moment of stunned silence, the monk's face lit up with joy.

He had thought his life was forfeit, only for the situation to take an unexpected turn—two Foundation Establishment cultivators wanted him! For a rogue cultivator, breaking through to Foundation Establishment was an immense challenge, with the Foundation Establishment Pill serving as an insurmountable barrier for most. The chance to latch onto such powerful patrons would drive any Qi Refinement cultivator wild with excitement.

Seeing that both Foundation Establishment experts were willing to take him in, the red-faced monk quickly made his choice. Though he didn't know the exact relationship between the two, one was a white-robed youth while the other was a hooded figure in gray robes. It didn't take a genius to figure out which one seemed more promising!

"Honored by your grace, this humble monk vows to serve you faithfully unto death!"  

*Thud!*  

The red-faced monk knelt before the hooded figure, performing the highest ceremonial bow—five prostrations and three kowtows—symbolizing absolute fealty in this world.

"???"  

Lin Shan stared in disbelief. Hadn't this guy just been showering him with praise? And hadn't he magnanimously offered him a way out despite their past conflict? Why had he suddenly switched allegiance to the Black Skeleton Demon Lord?

"Excellent!"  

The hooded figure extended a bony, blackened hand to help the monk up, his tone brimming with the satisfaction of a ruler who had found a worthy subordinate. The two clasped hands as if they had been destined to meet.  

"A wise bird chooses its perch, and a virtuous minister chooses his master. You've made an excellent choice."  

The red-faced monk swelled with pride at the praise. Finally, he had a powerful backer! As for why he hadn't chosen Lin Shan—well, the reason was simple.  

He had offended Lin Shan grievously in the past. Even if Lin Shan had temporarily let it slide due to his flattery, who knew if he might change his mind later? Better to tie himself to the other Foundation Establishment expert first, ensuring his safety.  

Though... why were his new master's hands so cold?  

"Remember your choice today. You will never regret it. Serving me is the greatest fortune of your eight lifetimes."  

"Yes, yes! This humble one is overwhelmed with gratitude."  

"As long as you serve me faithfully, you may come to me anytime with questions about cultivation."  

"Yes, yes! This humble one is eternally thankful."  

"In thirty years, if I haven't left this world, I will take you with me when I depart."  

"Yes, yes—wait, leave? To where?"  

A sudden sense of foreboding gripped the red-faced monk.  

The hooded figure abruptly threw back his cowl, revealing a gleaming, pitch-black skull with a deep green soulfire burning within.  

"To hell, of course."  

"Gah!"  

The monk trembled like a startled quail, staring in horror at his new master.  

He could accept the bizarre appearance, but... going to hell? Did that mean his master planned to kill him now?  

"P-Please, senior, you must be joking..."  

"I never joke," the Black Skeleton intoned, its soulfire flickering ominously.  

The monk swallowed hard and ventured cautiously, "Then... leaving for hell means..."  

"Exactly what it sounds like."  

*Thud!*  

The red-faced monk immediately dropped to his knees before Lin Shan, performing the same five prostrations and three kowtows, his face wreathed in obsequious smiles as he addressed the man he had just discarded.  

"This humble one wishes to follow you, senior, and serve you with utter devotion until death!"  

"Get lost!"  

Lin Shan was in a foul mood. The euphoria from the earlier flattery had worn off, and seeing the monk abandon him for someone else only stoked his anger. He hadn't even settled the score with this guy for obstructing his pursuit of Princess Guo back then!  

"You there! A loyal servant doesn't serve two masters. Now that you're mine, did you really think you could escape?"  

"Aaah—no! Stay away from me!"  

---  

After the Black Skeleton Demon Lord dragged the red-faced monk aside for some "disciplinary measures," the latter finally quieted down.  

When they returned, the monk stood meekly behind his new master, wilted like a cucumber, resigned to his fate.  

Now that things had settled, Lin Shan finally had time to ask about something that had long piqued his curiosity—the "Joyous Buddha Statues." He had encountered several of them, each providing a substantial amount of ancient charm points. In some ways, they reminded him of the Black Lotus Sect.  

The red-faced monk, now thoroughly cowed and dreading the prospect of following the skeleton to "hell," focused on surviving the present. Having just secured powerful backers, he dared not displease them and meticulously explained the origins of the Joyous Buddha statues.  

---  

As it turned out, the "Joyous Buddha Statues" originated from the "Joyous Sect," which worshipped the "Joyous Buddha"—the sole deity revered by all its followers.  

The Joyous Sect was a cultivation sect founded by devotees of this Buddha. Unlike the Black Lotus Sect, which harvested faith from mortals, the Joyous Sect exclusively targeted cultivators. Their faith and incense offerings came solely from within their own ranks—an internal cycle.  

The Black Lotus Sect didn't require its members to believe in the Black Lotus but instead proselytized among mortals to harvest their faith.  

The Joyous Sect, however, brainwashed its own members into devout worship, extracting faith directly from cultivators.  

One exploited outsiders, while the other exploited its own—that was the key difference.  

From a cultivator's perspective, the Black Lotus Sect was more lenient, as it didn't restrict its disciples' beliefs. But for mortals, the Joyous Sect was preferable since it left them untouched, focusing solely on indoctrinating its members.  

Because a cultivator's spiritual consciousness was far more refined than a mortal's, the quality of faith they provided was vastly superior. Even if the total quantity couldn't match the sheer numbers of mortal believers, the purity of their faith made it far more potent. This was why the Joyous Sect disdained mortal worship.  

---  

The Joyous Sect originated in the distant Piro Desert, separated from the Great Song Dynasty by over a dozen countries. The region was said to be perpetually covered in yellow sand, with both mortals and cultivators struggling against the harsh environment. Only the Joyous Sect, nestled deep in the desert, was an oasis of pleasure.  

Since the Piro Desert was a barren wasteland, untouched by other cultivation factions, the Joyous Sect grew steadily over time. But eventually, its expansion stalled—the desert had limited spiritual veins and resources. To continue growing, they had to expand outward, seizing territory and resources from neighboring regions.  

Cultivation required wealth, companions, techniques, and land—all of which depended on spiritual veins, mines, forests, and secret realms. Without these, how could a sect sustain itself?  

But the pie was only so big. To grow, they had to encroach on others' interests.  

Thus, the Joyous Sect decided to expand—but its leaders weren't fools. They opted for gradual infiltration.  

Eight hundred years ago, they secretly established cultivation sects across dozens of eastern countries, attempting to blend into local cultivation circles and slowly expand their influence.  

Their scheme was vast, extending even to the distant Great Song Dynasty.  

But secrets never stay buried forever. Eventually, their plot was exposed.  

The cultivation worlds of dozens of countries panicked, swiftly purging all Joyous Sect influences within their borders. The Joyous Sect remnants in the Great Song's Jiangdong ruins were just the tip of the iceberg from that turbulent era.  

Outnumbered, the Joyous Sect was forced to retreat to the Piro Desert, clinging to their meager territory.  

---  

After the Great Song's Joyous Sect branch was eradicated, a lone survivor persisted. Cut off from external support, this lineage gradually dwindled over time—until only the red-faced monk remained.  

Given the Joyous Sect's infamous reputation, making them pariahs in the cultivation world, the monk disguised himself as an orthodox Buddhist follower (albeit as a lay disciple without formal ordination) to avoid persecution.  

---  

"So, you're the last Joyous Sect member left in the Great Song?" Lin Shan asked, his expression odd.  

"Yes."  

The red-faced monk shrank his head. Back in the Yan-Yun Mountain Range, he had threatened Lin Shan, claiming that all sect members could sense the Joyous Buddha statues. In truth, there had never been anyone else—just him.  

Lin Shan retrieved another Joyous Buddha statue from his storage bracelet and handed it to the monk, asking bluntly what use it had. After examining it and testing it with a spell, the monk shook his head and returned it.  

"The faith power inside has completely dissipated. It's useless to me now."  

"The one you gave me back in the Yan-Yun Mountain Range was also..."  

He glanced up at Lin Shan but didn't finish. The implication was clear—Lin Shan had tricked him back then by giving him an empty statue.  

This only deepened Lin Shan's curiosity. "Do you have techniques for using faith power?"  

Without a word, the monk retrieved a tattered, ancient jade slip from his storage pouch and handed it over.  

Lin Shan checked it with his enhancement panel to ensure it was safe before scanning its contents with his spiritual sense. After a brief review, he withdrew his consciousness, deep in thought.  

The jade slip contained a dual cultivation manual—*The Joyous Esoteric Scripture*—along with several faith-based spells. Some were quite intriguing, such as "Divine Summoning," "Possession," "Spirit Pacification," "Faith Soul Suppression," and "Great Bliss Technique."  

The dual cultivation techniques were unusual, featuring many alluring positions. Though the scripture framed them in sacred terms, they weren't fundamentally superior to orthodox or demonic dual cultivation methods.  

As for the faith spells, Lin Shan had little interest. Practicing and casting them required consuming faith power—something he lacked. Even if he had any, he'd rather convert it into ancient charm points for enhancements.  

After learning about the Joyous Sect's background, Lin Shan filed the information away for later, making a mental note of the "Piro Desert" as a potential destination if he ever left the Great Song. After all, the Joyous Buddha statues were a viable source of ancient charm.  

---  

Having gleaned little practical information from the red-faced monk beyond some historical anecdotes, Lin Shan now faced the question of what to do with him.  

"Do you really intend to keep him with us?"  

Lin Shan frowned. In the long term, the monk might be useful if he ever sought out the Joyous Sect beyond the Great Song. But in the short term, a Qi Refinement cultivator would only be dead weight.  

Unless the monk reached Foundation Establishment, he'd be more trouble than he was worth. And Lin Shan wasn't running a charity—why should he support a freeloader?  

As for enhancing a Foundation Establishment Pill for him? Preposterous! Lin Shan barely had enough ancient charm for himself.  

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord hesitated. It wouldn't mind having a lackey for amusement, but it was already living under Lin Shan's roof. Moreover, the monk's low cultivation made him practically useless.  

After some thought, Lin Shan decided to compromise.  

He took out a transmission talisman, recorded a message, and handed it to the monk.  

"If you want to reach Foundation Establishment, go to the demonic faction's camp outside the capital, Bianliang. Take this talisman to the Ninth Division of the Central War Zone and look for an old man named Zhong. He'll arrange everything for you."  

"The righteous-demonic war is raging. It's the perfect time to distinguish yourself. If you want a Foundation Establishment Pill, earn it with merit!"  

"Once you've tempered yourself and hopefully broken through, we might even become peers..."  

The red-faced monk, initially despondent, perked up at Lin Shan's arrangement, as if granted a second lease on life. As long as he didn't have to follow the Black Skeleton, he'd go anywhere—even joining a top-tier faction as cannon fodder.  

"Thank you, senior!"  

Lin Shan waved him off, then turned east with the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, following the trail of the Black Lotus Sect's massive transport skyship.
