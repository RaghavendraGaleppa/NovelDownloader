**Chapter 68: Shattering the Void!**

Ji Xiongxiong's words fell, and the Heavenly Human Experts present all made their moves. With the Old Ancestor of the Yun family secretly manipulating karma, no one noticed anything amiss.

The next second, seven individuals surged forward, surrounding him, their seven Divine Weapons illuminating the night sky.

"Good!"

Before Lu Yang's words finished, his entire body burst into a mass of Primordial Qi, which then swept forth like a fierce wind, reaching Ji Xiongxiong in a blink of an eye.

Seeing this, a flash of blood-red gleamed in Ji Xiongxiong's eyes. His Divine Weapon was the 'Son of Heaven's Sword'. As the divine sword was unsheathed, the skies above Tianjing City instantly surged with wind and clouds. All the common people within Tianjing City felt their hearts sink, inexplicably losing all strength and collapsing weakly to the ground.

In its place, Ji Xiongxiong's divine power surged dramatically.

"Die!"

The next moment, Ji Xiongxiong unleashed a sword strike whose power even surpassed a Sword Qi Talisman. It landed on Lu Yang, almost scattering his Qi-transformed body.

But that was all it did.

The Primordial Qi Incarnation, formless and unpredictable, feared no fists, kicks, blades, or swords. Thus, it naturally restrained martial arts. Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent this incarnation.

In the end, martial arts was merely a crude system created by Lu Yang. Even if the Old Ancestor of the Yun family had supplemented it to the fourth step, allowing grand completion cultivators' physiques to rival Qi Refining Grand Completion, it still had significant flaws. A cultivator, by mastering just one counter divine ability, could easily defeat them.

"Everyone, attack together!"

Seeing that his single sword strike hadn't achieved success, Ji Xiongxiong immediately retreated. "Bind him! Don't let him use those talismans from before. Force him into close combat with us."

Without him needing to say it, the other Heavenly Human Experts had already charged forward.

The first to charge were 'Barefoot Daoist' Chang Qingjing and 'Deliverance Monk' Xuan Ku. One Daoist, one Buddhist, they formed a pincer attack from left and right.

At the same time, 'Jadeite Fairy' Hua Xiangrong descended from the sky, while 'World Alliance Leader' Guan Qiankun took Ji Xiongxiong's place, directly confronting Lu Yang. Only 'Demonic Blade' Ding Feiying remained hidden in the shadows, like a venomous snake, ready to strike out with a fatal blow at any moment.

Boom!

Lu Yang moved freely, sometimes reforming his body and scattering talismans, sometimes dispersing his form to evade attacks. For a time, he effortlessly fought against seven opponents!

In the distance, the Old Ancestor of the Yun family, secretly observing the battle, shook his head.

"Too weak..."

Although purely from a cultivation level perspective, Martial Heavenly Human Experts should actually be superior to Lu Yang's Primordial Qi Incarnation, in reality, it wasn't calculated that way at all.

If Lu Yang's Primordial Qi Incarnation was a 'max-level, full-gear' character, then Martial Heavenly Human Experts were at most 'max-level, blank-slate' characters. The two might seem similar, but in truth, they were poles apart. This was an innate deficiency of martial arts; a cultivation system that had developed for less than a hundred years was simply no match for the Immortal Dao.

"...So be it. I will make my move."

With a thought, the Old Ancestor of the Yun family immediately began to push karma, gradually shifting the situation, which had originally favored Lu Yang, towards the victory of the Martial Heavenly Human Experts.

The result was reflected in the state of the Martial Heavenly Human Experts.

The seven Martial Heavenly Human Experts not only felt no fatigue during the battle but grew more excited the longer they fought. Countless ingenious thoughts and inspirations erupted from them like a geyser.

And the aura of the Divine Weapons in their hands grew increasingly powerful.

These Divine Weapons were originally designed by the Old Ancestor of the Yun family and given to Ji Xiongxiong as 'fortuitous encounters'. They were perfectly suited to each Heavenly Human Expert's martial arts.

When combined, the two could originally unleash power approaching that of a Divine Ability.

However, as the Old Ancestor of the Yun family forcibly pushed karma, this power, which had only been 'approaching' a Divine Ability, instantly and formally reached the Divine Ability level!

Boom!

Another encirclement, but this time Lu Yang clearly felt something was wrong. When his Primordial Qi Incarnation reformed, a corner of his clothing was missing.

'Their attacks are working?'

Lu Yang's heart slightly stiffened. His incarnation was perfect and flawless; the only possible reason for this situation was that a portion of his Primordial Qi had been eroded by the Heavenly Human Experts.

'It seems that Foundation Establishment cultivator has made a move!'

Lu Yang's thoughts raced. Although he hadn't sensed any abnormalities, and his divination hadn't revealed anything, he immediately pinpointed the culprit.

Good, the act is almost complete here.

After all, he still needed his Primordial Qi Incarnation to perform a grand spectacle. If he were to truly mess up due to a moment's carelessness and get slain, that would be a huge joke.

"Whoosh..."

The next second, all the Heavenly Human Experts present heard a deep breath, and the surrounding air currents violently churned, as if wind and clouds were rolling backward.

The sound was long and clear, like a true dragon inhaling and exhaling the essence of heaven and earth.

Immediately afterward, the sky-full of white Qi reformed, and Lu Yang's figure emerged. He no longer evaded but revealed a confident smile.

"Scram!"

In an instant, a powerful aura suddenly burst forth from Lu Yang. A radiant halo appeared behind his head, like a round mirror, reflecting wind and thunder within.

The Grand Firmament Mirror!

Also a weapon, this Spirit Treasure was immeasurably stronger than the so-called Divine Weapons in the Heavenly Human Experts' hands. The moment it erupted, it immediately decided the situation.

Boom!

The mirror surface shimmered, and surging wind and thunder exploded around Lu Yang, directly sending all the Heavenly Human Experts flying, instantly leaving them severely wounded.

However, even so, the Heavenly Human Experts showed no signs of despair. Instead, they became even more excited. All other distracting thoughts in their minds vanished, leaving only one thought:

'Kill! Kill this person!'

Supported by this intense killing intent, all the Heavenly Human Experts seemed to be divinely aided. Difficulties that usually plagued them were now overcome in an instant!

Only 'Sageheart Scholar' Wang Boyuan, though equally filled with killing intent, moved with a hint of struggle. He seemed to have realized something but couldn't break free, only able to go with the flow. Only in his eyes, capable of gazing upon luck and Qi, did a hint of fear appear.

'Don't worry, Brother Wang, you are a talent. I will guide you in your next life...'

Lu Yang sighed inwardly, yet acted without hesitation. Another bolt of wind and thunder repelled the Heavenly Human Experts, and then dazzling brilliant light erupted from his entire body.

In an instant, the void trembled!

His Blood Qi soared like a dragon, piercing directly into the sky, as if a colossal pillar had descended, calming the turbulent winds of the moonlit night. It also broke through the dark clouds, revealing the clear, bright moon.

The dark, windy night, in a blink of an eye, transformed into a clear, star-studded night with a bright moon.

Between heaven and earth, only Lu Yang's long roar remained:

"This Immortal, the Grand Dao is complete!"

Crack!

The next second, the void shattered, and a massive rift appeared above Tianjing City. Lu Yang leaped forward, his figure flashing as he instantly disappeared into it.

Shattering the Void!

The immense visual impact even sobered up the Heavenly Human Experts, their gazes filled with shock, as if they had witnessed an unimaginable martial legend.

Is this the realm above Heavenly Humans?

Shattering the void, ascending and departing, forever transcending mortality and escaping the mundane... How similar was this to the immortals in folk tales? What mysteries did this hold?

"I saw it..."

Among the seven Heavenly Human Experts, only Ji Xiongxiong murmured softly.

He was the chess piece most valued by the Old Ancestor of the Yun family, and thus received the heaviest blessing of luck, almost exhausting all the luck of his latter half of life.

However, precisely because of this, his comprehension had reached its peak in this life. He seemed to see Lu Yang's method of opening that void rift: simply using a point to break a surface, first finding the connecting point in the void, then breaking it open, and stepping in before it could close again...

"...Hahahaha! I can do it too!"

The next second, Ji Xiongxiong suddenly laughed uproariously towards the sky. Then, with the 'Son of Heaven's Sword' in hand, he actually struck at the void, and a rift appeared!

Ji Xiongxiong didn't hesitate, striding in with his head held high.

The next second, all the rifts loudly closed. The remaining Heavenly Human Experts stood rooted to the spot, staring blankly at where Lu Yang and Ji Xiongxiong had been.

"They... broke through?"

"Such a thing exists!"

"Shattering the Void, shattering the void... So there truly is a realm above Heavenly Humans, where one shatters the void and ascends, forever free from the mundane world?"

Meanwhile, outside the Cultivation Secret Realm.

After Ji Xiongxiong shattered the void and followed, he saw Lu Yang, who had shattered it before him, standing inside a grand hall, observing him with a strange expression.

"I truly don't know whether to call you lucky, or unlucky..."

"This is...?"

Ji Xiongxiong turned his head, only to see a crystal sphere. However, everything he saw within the crystal sphere sent a chill to his bones.

Those were the Heavenly Human Experts, looking utterly bewildered.

Beyond that, within the crystal sphere were countless miniature buildings. Ji Xiongxiong recognized them; they were the cities of Great Zhou, the lands under his rule.

"This is... Great Zhou?! How is this possible?"

Ji Xiongxiong was not an ignorant person. On the contrary, to stand out among numerous martial artists and be favored by the Old Ancestor of the Yun family, his intelligence was certainly not low.

Thus, he quickly recovered his wits, looking at Lu Yang with immense shock.

A deception! It was all a deception!

What Shattering the Void? It was all fake!

The next second, Ji Xiongxiong abruptly turned back, actually attempting to shatter the void again, and transmitted a warning to the Heavenly Human Experts within the secret realm: "Do not shatter the void..."

Boom!

Before his words finished, a dazzling light descended from the sky, freezing him in place. Immediately afterward, Luo Wuyai, the Second Senior Brother of the Three Rivers Society, slowly walked into the grand hall.

"What an excellent material for corpse refinement!"

Luo Wuyai's face was filled with delight. "Is this something you cultivated in the secret realm, Junior Brother? To actually possess Qi Refining Grand Completion strength... How did you cultivate it, Junior Brother?"

Lu Yang cupped his hands and smiled. "If Senior Brother likes it, then it is a gift for Senior Brother."

"Good! Then I thank you, Junior Brother!"

The next second, Luo Wuyai decisively formed a hand seal. Ji Xiongxiong instantly felt a surge of chilling qi invade his entire body, and his Heavenly Human body was utterly unable to resist!

In his final moments, he thought of many things.

However, in the end, this grand completion martial artist, this generation's Heavenly Human, this martial legend who shattered the void, only had time to let out a roar of fury at Lu Yang, who had orchestrated this deception:

"Beast... You beast!!!"
