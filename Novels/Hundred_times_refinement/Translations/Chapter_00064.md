# Chapter 14: Pill Purification  

The reason was simple—in the cultivation world, alchemy was an extremely skill-intensive craft. Even experienced masters had a low success rate, typically producing one failed batch for every three attempts. Failed pills, containing excessive impurities, were not only useless for cultivation but could even harm the body. They were usually discarded with great reluctance.  

With rare spiritual herbs already scarce and the difficulty of alchemy compounding the low success rate, pills became even more precious.  

This was a constant headache for cultivators, especially in small sects like the Drifting Cloud Valley, where the alchemists' skills were limited, resulting in an even higher failure rate—rumored to be around fifty percent. Thus, even the most common and basic cultivation pill, the Marrow-Cleansing Pill, was distributed sparingly—only two per disciple each month.  

The scarcity of pills, coupled with high demand, was a major bottleneck in a cultivator's progress. Even those with superior spiritual roots and diligent practice still relied on pills for advancement.  

But for Lin Xuan, this presented a golden opportunity.  

Because the mysterious light dots in his body could defy the heavens—turning waste into treasure.  

Take the Drifting Cloud Valley as an example. With about three hundred disciples in the Qi Refining stage, each receiving two Marrow-Cleansing Pills per month, the total would be over six hundred pills. However, due to the high failure rate, roughly the same number of failed pills would also be produced.  

Failed pills were universally regarded as harmful and useless—pure trash. This had been the consensus in the cultivation world for tens of thousands of years. Though they weren’t casually discarded, their management was lax, and no one paid them any attention. This was precisely why Lin Xuan had set his sights on these failed pills.  

If he could acquire six hundred failed pills each month and use the blue light dots to transform them into usable spiritual medicine…  

He could treat pills like candy. Even without spiritual roots, his cultivation speed would surpass his peers.  

The prospect was dazzling, but Lin Xuan didn’t let excitement cloud his judgment. Even now, he remained clear-headed, carefully planning his next steps.  

First, he needed to understand the mechanism—how a failed pill had turned into a precious spiritual medicine. He had to figure out the conditions required, how to control the blue light dots, and master the process. Otherwise, his beautiful vision would remain an illusion—visible but untouchable. In short, he needed to learn how to properly wield the blue light dots.  

With his goal set, Lin Xuan examined the pill closely.  

Its color and fragrance were unmistakable. Aside from the last time when Elder Ma had deliberately given him an inferior pill, Lin Xuan had taken low-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills before and wouldn’t mistake them.  

To be thorough, he even took out a genuine Marrow-Cleansing Pill from his storage bracelet—one he had confiscated from Zhou Yan—and compared the two.  

The only difference was that the pill transformed from the failed one was slightly smaller in size. Beside it lay a pile of black, foul-smelling powder, which caught Lin Xuan’s attention.  

Impurities?  

Of course, Lin Xuan wouldn’t overlook such a crucial detail. He immediately recognized its origin. The reason why pills made from rare spiritual herbs failed was precisely because they contained too many impurities.  

In other words, failed pills weren’t lacking in essence—they were simply rendered useless by the excessive impurities.  

If one could remove the impurities and extract the essence, failed pills could indeed be turned into medicine. However, this was only theoretical. While easy to say, it was far harder to achieve. Over tens of thousands of years, countless sects and rogue cultivators had attempted it, yet none had succeeded.  

After countless failures, cultivators had no choice but to reluctantly discard the failed pills. For millennia, the cultivation world had accepted that impurities in failed pills were impossible to remove.  

Yet now, the black powder before him was clearly the impurities!  

Lin Xuan pondered for a moment before making a bold conjecture: Could the blue starry sea in his body serve to purify, removing impurities and condensing the essence—turning waste into treasure?  

Of course, this was just speculation. To confirm, he needed further experimentation.  

Without delay, Lin Xuan took out another failed pill from the jade bottle, held it in his palm, and sat cross-legged. After resting earlier, the starry sea had replenished its energy. He once again mobilized the blue light dots, guiding them through a grand cycle.  

The process was arduous, but Lin Xuan was accustomed to it. As the light dots reached his wrist, he focused his spiritual sense, meticulously observing every detail.  

Under his spiritual sense, the scene before him magnified several times, imprinting clearly in his mind. The light dots passed through the skin of his palm, some entering the failed pill while others dissipated into the air.  

As more light dots entered the pill, black powder began to separate and fall away—these were the impurities.  

Simultaneously, the pill’s color gradually lightened, shifting from black to gray, then to white…  

Lin Xuan carefully noted every detail, watching the pill’s transformation. His conjecture seemed to be mostly correct.  

He also noticed that not all light dots entered the pill—some dissipated into the air, which was clearly wasteful. So, he consciously adjusted the light dots in his body, gathering them more tightly to increase the number entering the pill.  

Sure enough, the rate of impurity separation accelerated. But after two or three minutes—*pop*—a soft sound rang out as the pill in his palm shattered.  

Lin Xuan opened his eyes and brought his hand closer. The pill lay in fragments, emitting a burnt odor. This attempt had ended in failure.  

"It seems the blue light dots can indeed separate impurities, extracting the essence and turning waste into treasure," Lin Xuan murmured to himself, his expression unperturbed. Though the experiment had failed, he had gained valuable insights, confirming his hypothesis.  

Next came analysis. He reviewed the process of controlling the blue light dots—no mistakes there. The only possible cause of failure was the speed. Could it be that the light dots had entered the pill too quickly, exceeding its tolerance?  

Lin Xuan formed a hypothesis, but to verify it, he needed another attempt. However, the blue starry sea in his body had diminished too much to support another purification. It seemed he would have to rest and try again later.
