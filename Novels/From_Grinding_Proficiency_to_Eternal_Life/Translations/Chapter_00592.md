# Chapter 592: A Similar Flower

Yang Jian's suggestion was intriguing. By casting his soul into the Soul-Ensnaring Banner, he would lose his past self and become a star spirit puppet, but his soul would be preserved. In a sense, it was surrendering to another path to survival.

Unlike being forcibly captured, Yang Jian's action had the flavor of offering a recommendation to secure his own chance at life.

"How interesting..."

A flicker of light passed through Xu Yunfan's eyes. He hadn't expected that there was still a way to survive after being shattered by him.

If Nezha could enter the banner, he certainly wouldn't refuse. The famous battle deity from mythology, if he could be subdued, would surely become a mighty general within the banner.

Though he had been blasted to pieces by Xu Yunfan's great array when they faced each other.

He immediately sent a voice transmission with his divine sense, his tone carrying a hint of satisfaction as he nodded slightly.

"Considering you still have some affection for your disciple, this Lord shall agree."

You started this first, this Daoist master didn't force you, so consider it fulfilling your wish.

According to the location information provided by Yang Jian's star spirit, Xu Yunfan quickly arrived at his destination.

However, he didn't enter recklessly. Instead, he used various mystical techniques, even secret arts involving karma, to scout ahead. Only after confirming there were no traps did he relax slightly.

It wouldn't be good to fall into a ditch.

Inside the Soul-Ensnaring Banner, Yang Jian watched Xu Yunfan's series of actions and couldn't help but twitch at the corners of his eyes. He felt fortunate that he had been loyal; otherwise, if Xu Yunfan had detected anything unusual, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

For these Outer Realm Demons, death might be a form of happiness.

This was a long-shattered immortal garden relic. What should have been a magnificent lotus pond was now nothing more than a murky, black puddle.

In the center of the puddle, however, a spotlessly clean lotus platform floated miraculously. Its petals were tightly closed, yet it emitted a faint but pure life force and tenacious vitality.

Beside the lotus platform sat a short, stout Daoist in a tattered Daoist robe.

His face was filled with sorrow, and his gaze was fixed unblinkingly on the lotus platform, his expression tinged with caution.

The fat Daoist watched over it, unable to help muttering to himself with worry, his voice filled with despair and confusion.

"Sigh... The Heavenly Realm is on the verge of collapse, the laws are in chaos, and the Heavenly Dao laments. This immortal paradise of billions of years is about to be completely annihilated.

Nezha, oh Nezha, your master has done his best to find you this last trace of the spiritual lotus's root soul, to help you reshape your foundation and nurture your residual soul. But even if you can survive within this lotus, the Heavenly Dao itself has collapsed. You... how long can you and I possibly live?

This body, this soul, will eventually return to nothingness. It's just a matter of time...

Unless... unless we can find the legendary otherworldly celestial boat of the Heavenly Emperor, and use it to escape this collapsing cage.

But where is the Heavenly Emperor now? Where is the celestial boat? With calamity upon us, where is the other shore..."

At this thought, the fat Daoist let out a heavy sigh, his face shrouded in a gloom of despair.

He had expended countless efforts to preserve this sliver of life for his disciple, only to realize the path ahead was one of utter hopelessness.

"The Otherworldly Celestial Boat?"

Hidden in the shadows, Xu Yunfan, who was concealing his presence, happened to catch the fat Daoist's low lament. A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes. According to the fat Daoist, this should be an artifact of the Spirit Treasure grade.

For a moment, he was tempted, but the very next second, he cut off that thought.

Spirit Treasures were not something he could touch yet. Just having the Great Dao of the Taiyin Black Mirror was already a scalding hot potato.

If you want to grab every benefit, you have to see if you are qualified enough.

"So there are such secret tales in this world? A pity, even if there is a boat, there is no path to survival."

The Heavenly Realm is now jointly besieged by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the Primordial Origin Sect, and the Bodhi Pure Land, who have recently joined in. The true lords of these sects have likely already sealed off the Outer Realm.

However, his opportunity was right before him.

Xu Yunfan no longer concealed himself. The layer of secret art that concealed his aura instantly dissipated, and his figure, like a phantom, appeared without warning above the murky puddle.

"Who?!"

The fat Daoist jolted awake, his eyes flashing with horror and alarm as he looked up sharply.

However, it was already too late.

Xu Yunfan's movement was as fast as lightning. His arm shot out, his five fingers like hooks, and a mighty, irresistible suction force suddenly erupted, its target the lotus flower containing the residual soul.

Space seemed to solidify. The lotus platform was forcibly pulled upward by an invisible force.

"You dare?!"

The fat Daoist's eyes split wide with rage, and he let out an extremely furious roar.

His reaction couldn't be called slow, but Xu Yunfan's actions were even more bizarre and swift, executed with long-laid plans.

*Pfft!*

A soft sound. The tightly closed lotus petals offered no resistance as they were torn from the fat Daoist's control, along with the faint crimson, battle-unyielding soul of Nezha within.

Held in Xu Yunfan's five fingers, it instantly transformed into a stream of light and vanished into the Heavenly Star Soul Banner in his sleeve, which was already humming and trembling.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye.

"Demon! Give me back my disciple's life!!!"

Witnessing his beloved disciple's residual soul being snatched away, the fat Daoist's mind and heart shattered instantly, his reason drowned by an overwhelming rage.

With a furious roar, he shot to his feet, brandishing the seemingly ancient whisk in his hand.

A thousand rays of light exploded. The thirty-thousand silver-white strands of the whisk instantly burst forth and grew long, like the Milky Way cascading down, transforming into Heavenly Gang clouds. With shrieks that tore through the air, they swept and coiled toward Xu Yunfan in mid-air, covering the sky and earth.

Each strand contained the仙元 (immortal energy) and will that the fat Daoist had refined over a thousand years. They were incredibly tough, capable of capturing dragons and binding phoenixes.

Facing an attack that would cause even a cultivator of the same level to panic, Xu Yunfan's expression didn't change in the slightest. Instead, a hint of contempt appeared in his eyes.

"As expected of a cultivator from the outer five counties."

His will stirred, and the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi surged from his body.

This was not a simple protective aura, but a turbulent, all-encompassing mist that spread out like a living creature. The cloud was neither truly solid nor truly ethereal, neither smoke nor fire, its colors shifting unpredictably. It carried a fundamental power to refine all things and reshape creation.

It was the result of practicing the Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Cloud Manual for Refining the Heavens and Creating Reality. It could not only refine artifacts but also dissolve them.

*Ssssss!*

The thirty-thousand whisk strands instantly pierced into the churning Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, as if stabbing into a viscous, liquid metallic space. The seemingly soft Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, upon contact with the whisk strands, erupted with astonishing refining power.

It was like snow melting against ice, or wax burning under a scorching sun.

"What?!"

The fury on the fat Daoist's face was instantly replaced by extreme horror.

He could clearly feel that the divine sense and immortal energy imprints on his whisk artifact, which he had painstakingly refined and nurtured for a thousand years, were being broken down and refined by that bizarre, colorful cloud at a terrifying speed.

In just a single breath.

Like snow melting or green smoke dissipating, the originally silver-gleaming, terrifying thirty-thousand whisk strands, under the包裹 and erosion of the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, broke apart inch by inch. They dissolved into the most fundamental spiritual energy particles, then were completely devoured, vanishing without a trace.

Only the bare jade handle of the whisk remained in the fat Daoist's hand, along with a face etched with indescribable terror.

"My whisk..."
