# Chapter 311: A Gentleman Must Embrace Local Customs (1/2)

“Forgot clothes?”

Having just accepted a new mystery from the *Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao*, Li Mo almost forgot everything.

But that didn't make sense.

Last time in Yunzhou, she had emptied out an entire ready-to-wear clothing store and stored everything in the Ice Cube’s spatial artifact.

Moreover, she possessed a miraculous martial art that allowed her to change outfits in the blink of an eye.

How could she have no clothes to wear?

Hmm...

Wait.

This was the moment that tested their tacit understanding. The gentlemanly Li Mo realized he understood perfectly.

*Underwear...*

After all, the shop in Yunzhou sold ready-to-wear clothing, not underwear.

As for martial arts...

What legitimate martial art would have the effect of changing underwear? It seemed highly unlikely just thinking about it.

“Is it the clothing you wear underneath?” Li Mo asked.

“......”

The Frost Fairy on the other side of the screen was silent for a long time before nodding slightly, her voice as soft as a mosquito’s hum.

“Mm.”

“Wait for me for a moment.”

Li Mo nodded. He had been in the middle of comprehending the Somersault Cloud from the *Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao*.

He never expected it would come in handy so quickly!

Looking at the diagram, the gentlemanly Li Mo seriously calmed his mind to comprehend the wondrous divine ability within.

“The Somersault Cloud is the most profound movement and flight technique in the world, containing the mystery of ‘a foot can be a thousand miles.’ Thus, upon great mastery, one can travel one hundred and eight thousand miles with a single somersault...”

“Brother Monkey mastered it overnight back in the day. I should have no problem grasping the basics.”

“The locals in the tavern said there are shops selling women's clothing on West Street? It seems there are quite a few styles. The customs of the Southern Frontier are quite open; you can tell just by looking at the clothes.”

“I wonder about the underwear... Sorry, Brother Monkey.”

Little Li pinched himself and seriously began to contemplate the Somersault Cloud.

Because time was tight, he even utilized his martial arts comprehension.

**[Ten years of martial arts comprehension injected successfully.]**

**[Year 1: You begin to practice somersaults according to the method within the divine ability. *Damn, walk, ignore!* You succeeded on the first try! However, because the action differs greatly from the divine intent, you only summoned a trace of cloud mist.]**

**[Year 6: Your movements become increasingly standard. With a flip, you can summon a large amount of cloud mist, riding the mist to stay aloft, though the speed isn't as miraculous as you imagined.]**

**[Year 9: You no longer need to perform somersaults. You can ride the clouds with a single thought, and the speed has improved significantly, but it still hasn't reached the ability to traverse a thousand miles in a step.]**

**[Year 10: You have a sudden realization—you are not 'light' enough.]**

A torrent of insights flooded his mind.

Li Mo fell into thought.

Although the Somersault Cloud could be improved using martial arts comprehension, it wasn't like a martial art that required daily accumulation and distinct stages of minor success, great success, perfection, or realm of transformation.

This divine ability, like the Vajra Body, was related only to his 'person'.

“I am not light enough...”

Li Mo frowned. Using martial arts comprehension further would be useless now; he needed a spark of inspiration.

Without that spark, sitting around grinding away would be useless.

This contemplation didn't take long, only a few minutes.

The guest room was still filled with misty vapor and a faint, floating fragrance.

Li Mo stopped dwelling on whether he was 'light' or not and turned his head. He saw the girl on the screen, her eyes cast down, looking like a quiet, sunken jade.

Right...

The Ice Cube was still waiting for clothes.

Actually, she could use cloud mist to cover herself, just like last time. Why did she forget this time?

“Ice Cube, I’m going to buy you a few pieces of underwear. I’ll be right back.”

*Whoosh—*

Clouds surged. A cloud mist appeared beneath Li Mo’s feet. This weightless mist gently lifted him up, carrying him out the window.

Ying Bing lifted her eyes, watching the youth’s shadow fly out the window.

She couldn't help but pick up the Big-Headed Doll and ask it in her heart:

*When did he learn this new move?*

Inner Realm experts rely on their domain to fly, and the movement is usually quite noticeable.

Other methods can also allow a Spirit Refining martial artist to fly, such as her Green Phoenix Wings, but no matter the method, there is usually a fluctuation of vital energy.

But Li Mo had none just now.

---

It was as if a cloud had suddenly drifted by and carried him away.

He always seemed to acquire miraculous techniques that even he hadn't seen before.

“Can he really buy the right ones...”

The Big-Headed Doll couldn't speak.

So Ying Bing let out a soft snort and flicked its forehead with her finger, making it spin around in the water.

.......

“Huh?”

“This flying feeling is pretty exciting.”

Riding the Somersault Cloud, Li Mo, feeling the thrill of the hunt, performed a few 360-degree spins in the air, executing various flexible, high-difficulty maneuvers.

He felt that the Somersault Cloud moved with his thoughts, incredibly agile.

Most importantly, it was extremely fast!

Although it wasn't as magical as traveling one hundred and eight thousand miles in a somersault, it was equivalent to 2.8 times the speed of Huang Donglai.

“So the Green Wood City is actually this big.”

“I wonder if the Somersault Cloud can carry people? Hmm... It seems unnecessary. The Ice Cube can fly herself.”

Riding the wind, looking down at the myriad lights of Green Wood City.

Little Li felt the excitement of someone who bought a new car and couldn't help but drive it just to go downstairs and buy a pack of cigarettes.

Before long.

He found the shop specializing in women's underwear and dissipated the Somersault Cloud at the street corner.

Walking into the shop, the owner was a middle-aged local woman. The business was quite good at the moment.

As soon as Li Mo entered, he attracted all sorts of gazes.

“Little brother, we don't sell men's clothes here.”

The female owner thought he had entered the wrong shop.

“Buying for someone else,” the gentlemanly Li Mo said seriously.

“Hahaha.”

“You aren't a local, are you, little brother?”

“A big少年 like you, buying clothes for your wife?”

Laughter and chatter filled the clothing shop.

Of course, this was also because Little Li looked sunny and handsome, appearing calm yet slightly flustered, which was quite amusing.

If it were a dirty, lecherous-looking man with a foot fetish, he would have been chased out long ago.

“Your wife's figure, what's it like?” the owner asked again.

“大概....就....”

The gentlemanly Li Mo thought for a moment and had a sudden idea.

He pointed across the street at a type of large meat bun—a Southern Frontier imitation of the Central Plains style, but more rugged, the kind that could fill a man up.

“Young man, you have quite the good fortune.”

The owner clicked her tongue and asked with a smile:

“I have many styles here. I don't know what she likes, so you can just pick some that *you* like.”

As soon as these words came out.

The shop was filled with light scoffs and suppressed giggles from the women.

This kind of thing, besides oneself, is only worn for one's husband to see.

“Ones *I* like? Ahem, normal styles will do. The kind a gentleman would choose.”

Li Mo cleared his throat and looked up. He saw the counter hung with a dazzling array of styles, giving him the feeling that the door to a new world had opened before him.

Some were Central Plains styles, nothing special to say about those.

Some were local Southern Frontier styles. Most were quite revealing, and not just in terms of fabric; the designs were unique and ingenious. Some were even more tempting than a cool summer...

“Oh, listen to you. Gentlemen don't walk through the doors of this place.”

The owner followed Li Mo's gaze and said with a smile:

“Young man, this is called *He Huan Jin* (Close-fitting garment for intimacy).”

“It's a local Southern Frontier style. This one is made of pearl-white lotus silk, and it isn't cheap.”

Why is it called *He Huan Jin*?

Some women who live alone, or those whose relationships are on the rocks, buy this style...

“I’ll take them all.”

Little Li didn't know about those things.

Buying local Southern Frontier styles in the Southern Frontier is called embracing local customs.

A gentleman understands this principle perfectly; he must embrace local customs thoroughly.

The audience must be tired; they can't even be bothered to charge this little failed writer...
