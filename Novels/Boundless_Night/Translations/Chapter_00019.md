# Chapter 19: Non-stop

Qin Ming stood still, unfazed by not being chosen; his mindset was quite peaceful. Xu Yueping, however, was anxious for him, but there was nothing he could do to change it. Yang Yongqing also felt it was a pity for him; he had once jokingly told Qin Ming that noble ladies would descend during the mountain-clearing operation, advising him to perform well.

Wei Zhirou was very articulate. She greeted Qin Ming warmly, showering him with praise, saying she truly wished to invite him to join their operation, but Cao Long and Mu Qing wouldn't agree. She told him he could seek her out in Crimson Cloud City after the mountain clearing was over. Naturally, Qin Ming didn't put on airs. He responded with a smile, stating that if he were to leave the local area, Crimson Cloud City would be his first choice.

"I choose Qin Ming," Mu Qing stated.

Qin Ming's body stiffened imperceptibly. Earlier, not being chosen hadn't bothered him at all, he'd been quite indifferent, but now he felt a little uneasy. It was one thing not knowing if the person before him was male or female, but now it was even hard to say if they were human. Entering the mountain with them genuinely made him feel apprehensive. He somewhat suspected whether Mu Qing was some kind of higher life form that had joined Crimson Cloud City. Otherwise, no matter how much a human body transformed, it shouldn't grow a furry golden tail, right?

What could he do? In the current situation, there was no room for hesitation. He readily nodded in agreement.

Mu Qing was quite pleased with him. Seeing that Qin Ming only carried a simple woodcutting knife, they asked, "You lack a suitable weapon. What kind are you accustomed to using?"

Qin Ming replied, "I haven't settled on one yet."

Mu Qing thought for a moment, then said, "Some monsters in the mountains have tough scales and thick hides; ordinary swords and knives might not be able to cut through them. I'll give you a long-handled hammer. If used well, its destructive power is immense; you can smash heads with a single blow. However, it's a heavy weapon, so I'm not sure if you'll find it easy to handle."

Mu Qing beckoned to someone behind them, and immediately, someone brought forward a long-handled hammer forged from dark gold. After Qin Ming took it, he casually twirled it a few times, leaving streaks of afterimages and producing a buzzing sound as it cut through the air. He seemed to be skillfully performing spear flourishes or gracefully wielding a sword.

"Good!" Mu Qing nodded, discerning that his strength was immense.

Wei Zhirou was slightly astonished. She had very high standards, and seeing him wield the heavy long-handled hammer with such apparent ease, she estimated his strength had already reached the six-hundred-jin threshold. Earlier, she had people investigate the only two youths who had established a golden foundation, and she had always thought Xu Yueping exaggerated Qin Ming's abilities. Now, she saw that he hadn't. However, she didn't feel it was a pity. Zhou Wubing, whom she had chosen, had suffered a qi injury in his early years, but with his rebirth, his origin was gradually recovering. His potential was immense, estimated to be able to lift at least six hundred jin once stable, truly a natural prodigy, especially since even Xu Kong valued and personally tutored him. Cao Long, on the other hand, was calm. He followed the path of the Divine Giant, possessing innate divine strength!

Mu Qing said, "I'll also give you a short sword. In case you're engaged in close combat by an aberrant, you'll need a sharp short weapon."

"Thank you!" Qin Ming took it. Now, he finally had weapons superior to those used by the Patrol Team.

Next, Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing quickly made their selections. Old Man Liu was over seventy years old. Initially, no one chose him, but he volunteered, saying he knew the great mountains as well as his own backyard. He then became a hot commodity, with all three factions surprisingly wanting him.

"I want to be in the same team as little Qin," Old Man Liu stated. "We're from the same village and familiar with each other, so we can look out for one another."

Soon, the Cao, Wei, and Mu families finished their selections.

"Everyone, the higher-ups will soon conduct a final negotiation with the mysterious aberrations in the great mountains. For now, we can only wait." Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing were to lead their people back to Silver Vine Town, where they currently resided. They instructed the chosen newly awakened to return and make all necessary preparations. Afterward, people saw dozens more individuals emerge from the dense forest, departing with the three teams. They were all armored young adults.

On the way back, Xu Yueping sighed, "It seems the people from Crimson Cloud City truly only see us as guides. They act polite and courteous, but in reality, they don't think much of our strength."

Yang Yongqing spoke up, "Those youths in the three teams are indeed here to hone themselves, but the dozens of experienced young adults are the true main force for the three families' mountain clearing and exploration of the mysterious territories."

Old Man Liu, however, was more open-minded. The other side possessed advanced Qi cultivation techniques; what could they possibly compare with? Xu Yueping shook his head, "I've been to Crimson Cloud City. Only a very small number of core noble members possess complete advanced scriptures." Based on his judgment, the so-called generous rewards this time couldn't possibly include their families' unrevealed secrets, as that would shake their foundations.

"I reckon it's likely fragments of advanced classics they collected from outside, not their own family's core heritage. Of course, for those in the Nascence realm, these would certainly be enough to cultivate to perfection."

Yang Yongqing yearned, "How incredibly rare are advanced Qi cultivation techniques! Even if incomplete, if they only record the path to the Nascence realm, they are enough to drive people mad."

Qin Ming murmured, "Advanced scriptures are so precious, yet the three great families of Crimson Cloud City are willing to offer them. This shows how highly they value the 'Four-Colored Mist-Shrouded Land' that appeared in the mountains. What hidden secret could there be?"

"Wrong, there are over a dozen families in total," Old Man Liu corrected.

Shortly after, they returned to the village.

***

As the early night drew to a close, Qin Ming, carrying a large piece of donkey meat, arrived at Old Man Liu's doorstep. He claimed to be there for a meal, but in truth, he wanted to ask about the Blood Bamboo Forest. Old Man Liu lived at the village entrance, relatively close to the Fire Spring. In the night, his house of green bricks and gray tiles was tinged with a faint crimson glow.

As Qin Ming stepped through the courtyard gate, he saw a yellow dog dart out from its kennel. It was as tall as an adult's shoulder, its entire yellow coat shimmering with a bright luster, and it bared its pure white canines. Qin Ming immediately thought of the golden mastiff from the Patrol Team and couldn't help but glance at the yellow dog a few more times. With its sturdy, well-fed appearance, its meat looked quite good. The yellow dog seemed to sense something. A moment ago it had been baring its teeth, but in the next instant, it suddenly tucked its tail between its legs and plunged into its kennel, refusing to come out.

"Little Qin, why are you carrying meat when you come to my house?" Old Man Liu, though advanced in age, was still incredibly sharp, appearing in the courtyard immediately.

Qin Ming said with a smile, "Grandpa Liu, how about I trade you two Blade-Horned Deer for your yellow dog?"

"Woof, woof..." The large dog in the kennel whimpered, its tail tucked, as it tilted its head and looked at its owner, as if trying to convey something.

"This old dog has strong spiritual perception," Old Man Liu said. "It's very afraid of you, which means you've developed a killing aura from your recent hunts in the mountains." At the same time, he shook his head with a smile, saying, "I won't trade with you. This dog is close to mutating, and it's actually providing for our family, bringing back wild game from time to time."

"Its spiritual perception is that high?" Qin Ming asked in surprise.

Old Man Liu stroked his goatee and said, "Of course. Two months ago, it was so old it could barely move its legs. It disappeared for a few days, and when it came back, it started getting better. It's definitely going to mutate before Yang Yongqing's black goat."

"The saying 'an old dog returns to the mountains to either die or become strong again' actually has a real example now," Qin Ming marveled, staring at the big yellow dog repeatedly.

Old Man Liu chuckled, "Speaking of which, you nearly died when you fell into that crevice in the mountains last time, and after a serious illness, you quickly underwent a rebirth. That's quite similar to an old dog returning to the mountains and coming back alive."

Qin Ming really wanted to punch him. This old man truly didn't know how to talk; his words were a bit sharp. No wonder he didn't marry the most beautiful girl back then.

Old Man Liu whispered, "That crevice you found is worth paying attention to. The great families of Crimson Cloud City are all searching for those special nodes; there must be a deeper meaning."

Qin Ming shook his head, "Until I undergo a second Nascence, I don't plan to approach that area." He then took the opportunity to ask Old Man Liu, "Grandpa Liu, you're very knowledgeable about the legends of various spiritual objects in the great mountains. Could you tell me about them?"

"You rascal, I knew you wanted something from me," Old Man Liu said, pointing at him with a smile. But then he quickly grew serious, "If spiritual objects were that easy to obtain, why would I have wasted my time until now? You've established a golden foundation, so you're bound to undergo a second Nascence. There's absolutely no need to take risks."

Qin Ming said, "Didn't you say that youths should have drive? It's a waste to live one's youth without being a bit reckless. I want to undergo a second Nascence as soon as possible and see the scenery from higher up."

"Did I say those words?" Old Man Liu looked at him suspiciously. He hadn't been drunk when they drank yesterday, only having half a cup of strong old wine each.

"More or less," Qin Ming chuckled.

"Indeed, in youth, one should have grand ambitions," Old Man Liu said. "Because dreams tend to decrease with age, so the starting point must be high."

Cold winds carried heavy snow, battering the windows. Inside the house, Old Man Liu's dining table steamed, primarily with donkey meat. Qin Ming and Old Man Liu chatted until very late, learning the names of some spiritual objects, all located in extremely dangerous areas. He also found out where the Blood Bamboo Forest was. Qin Ming had also suspected that the Blood Bamboo Forest targeted by Feng Yian, Shao Chengfeng, and the others was likely within the Patrol Team's jurisdiction. Sure enough, Old Man Liu mentioned that the Blood Bamboo Forest was only six li (about 3 km) from the Patrol Team's stronghold.

A type of snake resided there, its entire body a shimmering crimson, like it was carved from red agate. Its flesh and gallbladder contained rich vitality and spiritual essence. However, this type of snake was extremely dangerous, even lethal. It possessed potent venom; even a newly awakened person couldn't withstand a single bite. "If you're fortunate enough to capture one, you need to chop off its head and remove its venom glands, otherwise it's not a tonic, but rather a death-inducing soup."

Old Man Liu informed him that besides its potent venom, this snake's body was as hard as iron, its strength astonishing, and it could leap through the air. Even a small snake only a few feet long was more dangerous than many mountain beasts, capable of shooting out like an iron arrow, instantly piercing an opponent's body. Thus, some called it the Blood Serpent, while others called it the Arrow Serpent. If one encountered a Blood Serpent over ten feet long in the mountains, the best option was to immediately flee.

Old Man Liu recalled that the snake den had existed since his youth. Decades had passed, and there must have already been Blood Serpents that had undergone secondary mutation. Qin Ming said, "As long as no more powerful old serpents appear."

"Swords and knives might not even be able to cut through a Blood Serpent's body; they'll only spark," Old Man Liu said. "Among creatures of the same level, it's extremely fierce, with almost no weaknesses." As he spoke, he suddenly stood up, nearly overturning the table, startling his old wife and almost making his youngest grandson cry.

"What's wrong with you, you old geezer?" The old woman glared at him.

Old Man Liu's face was flushed, as if he had regained his youth. He excitedly waved his arms and said, "How could I forget about this! Now that something's gone wrong in the great mountains, if the Fire Spring in the Blood Bamboo Forest goes out, all the Blood Serpents there will freeze solid, wouldn't they be ripe for the taking?" He wished he could grow wings and fly into the mountains to see for himself.

Qin Ming immediately said, "How about we two, grandfather and grandson, go into the mountains tonight to pick up some spiritual Blood Serpents?"

"Alright!" Old Man Liu nodded vigorously. But then, as if something suddenly occurred to him, he slumped back down, sighing, "If I've realized it, how could Feng Yian, Shao Chengfeng, and those grandsons who guard the mountains, and are desperately eager for a second Nascence, not have thought of the spiritual objects within their own patch of land?" The old man looked utterly despondent, his earlier joy and excitement gone. He sat there, slapping his thigh until it was almost bruised, indignantly cursing the Patrol Team members. "Those dog-things really have good luck," he grumbled. "Are there going to be one or two more people like Fu Entao, stumbling upon such a good opportunity? I really want to douse their faces with a scoop of golden fluid, to make them 'radiant' with shame!"

***

Qin Ming could truly be said to have been non-stop that day. In the middle of the night, he braved the wind and snow to enter the mountains, using a woodcutting knife to kill Fu Entao, Feng Yian, and others. Then he went to meet the nobles from Crimson Cloud City, and afterward, he listened to Old Man Liu boast all night, chatting about his various mysterious encounters and strange experiences in the great mountains.

Qin Ming felt slightly weary upon returning home and quickly fell into a deep sleep. The next day, he woke up early, quickly finished breakfast, and headed straight into the mountains.
