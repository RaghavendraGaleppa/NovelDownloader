# 30，七甲象功与魔银手

Just one punch, and Li Zhiming felt his intestines twisting in agony, almost as if they were about to break. His limbs became completely useless. At this point, talking about willpower translating into strength was nothing but a joke.

Doctor Mo’s aged face remained devoid of emotion. He merely gripped the child’s neck with his five fingers, lifting him straight into the air. Li Zhiming’s neck turned a purplish-black, on the verge of snapping, and the air in his lungs began to diminish, less and less!

He was like a stranded fish, desperately opening his mouth to suck in something, but his lungs couldn’t absorb anything at all.

Sleeve arrows, sleeve swords, poisoned needles – all such things were scattered on the ground. Li Zhiming had no means of retaliation left.

The difference was too great. No matter how much Li Zhiming planned, an eleven-year-old child facing a seasoned and ruthless figure would always be like a child wielding a big knife, posing no real threat whatsoever.

But those were no longer things Li Zhiming needed to consider at this moment.

"Heh... heh..." Li Zhiming made convulsive, mournful sounds, his face a purplish-black, the view before his eyes growing darker and darker. In the valley, a cool wind blew, the sun was warm, and the sky was high with light clouds.

On such a pleasant afternoon, Li Zhiming only felt cold in his hands and feet, his blood no longer reaching his brain. The scent of death surged directly into his mind for the first time!

Is this... death?

Li Zhiming, who had never feared anything, finally began to feel the fear of imminent death. And it was often at this moment that one’s thoughts became clearer.

Everything he had done before flashed through his mind like a revolving lantern.

Was it recklessness, boldness, or ignorance?

Like a young calf charging headfirst into a senile tiger.

Like a child unaware of the pain they were causing when grabbing a pet cat.

Youth masked the weight of fear, but in an instant, like being caught by the tiger’s teeth on the neck, like the cat turning and scratching with its claws with all its might, the fear only dawned on him after the fact.

Was it too late?

Doctor Mo’s punch today shattered Li Zhiming’s years of audacity all at once.

Making this eleven-year-old child understand what kind of time, what kind of environment, he was living in!

Did he really think he was at home!

How did Liu Zhi die? Had he forgotten?

How many faces were missing from the children who had been sent here together three years ago? Could he not remember?

Even those who practiced stances in the morning and fist techniques in the evening, enduring ten years of summer heat and winter frost, developing the ability to split stones and leap over mountains; were there few of those who ended up in the Medicine Valley, limbs chopped off, dying with the howls of a stray dog?

How could he just look at it, stare at it, day after day, without feeling anything?

Did death have to descend upon him personally for him to truly feel the terror of it?

Doctor Mo coldly watched the strength of his disciple’s struggle weaken in his hand.

At this moment, he only needed to exert a little more force with his fingers.

He could snap his neck as easily as snapping the neck of a chick!

In the distance, on the hillside, a rustling sound came, and a head cautiously poked out.

A moment later, Li Zhiming felt like years were passing in an instant, his consciousness completely blurred, unable to perceive anything. Then, with a "puff," his neck was released, and he fell heavily to the ground, completely out of control.

Li Zhiming’s body reacted violently. He crawled on the ground like a dog, vomiting profusely, spitting out acid, convulsing all over, the darkness before his eyes still overwhelming.

His lungs began to frantically snatch for air.

After a long time, Li Zhiming heard Doctor Mo’s cold voice.

"Remember how you feel today!"

"This is the taste of death!"

Li Zhiming didn’t speak, his body just trembled on the ground.

"Get up," Doctor Mo said faintly, his hands behind his back, facing away from the sun and gazing into the distance.

Struggling for a few moments, Li Zhiming stood up behind Doctor Mo with great effort, his head lowered, his face still purple, his fingers trembling, but he remained silent.

"Xiao Si."

"... Here."

"Your talent is poor, far inferior to Han Li. He will achieve great things in the future, but you will not."

"Do you know what you should do?"

"Please teach me, Master."

"I have two martial arts techniques. I will teach them to you today. Watch carefully," Doctor Mo’s cold voice floated over. "I will only demonstrate once. How much you can remember depends on you."

Li Zhiming was slightly stunned with his head lowered, and then he raised his head.

Doctor Mo’s back was full of white hair, making him look extremely old. Although his spirit and energy were still there, he was obviously much more lifeless than he had been three years ago.

"The first technique is the foundation of my life, the assassin's skill that allowed me to roam the world and manipulate events back in the day." As he said this, a trace of recollection and a hint of pride flashed across Doctor Mo’s face.

Li Zhiming slowly took a deep breath.

"This move is called the Demonic Silver Hand. It can be considered a top-tier martial art among the various supreme martial arts of the Seven Mysteries Sect." Doctor Mo’s face showed a slight hint of pride.

'Demonic Silver Hand'? A hint of suspicion flashed through Li Zhiming’s mind. The name sounded very obscure and strange. Li Zhiming quickly thought about it in his mind. With Li Zhiming’s almost photographic memory, he could be sure that this was definitely not a martial art of the Seven Mysteries Sect!

"Watch closely."

Doctor Mo’s tone became uninterested. "If you learn this technique, you can always be a first-class master in the martial world in the future."

After saying that, Doctor Mo, who was facing away from him, began to demonstrate carefully. He even slowed down his movements, deliberately so that Li Zhiming could see clearly.

As soon as he circulated his energy, Li Zhiming was instantly shocked.

He saw true energy circulating between Doctor Mo’s palms. Li Zhiming closed his mouth and even stopped breathing to concentrate all his attention, carefully watching the almost imperceptible flow of energy on Doctor Mo’s arm.

Then, in just a few seconds, Doctor Mo’s hands changed drastically.

In an instant, Doctor Mo’s big hands rapidly swelled up, as if filled with air, and the muscles that swelled up were like dragons, not at all like the previous shriveled hands.

In the blink of an eye, Doctor Mo’s arm muscles had turned into two fan-sized hands, silver in color, shimmering with a ghastly luster, completely like silver steel, making them look very terrifying!

Watching this scene, Li Zhiming almost forgot to breathe, completely entranced. What kind of power and magic was this!?

Looking at these pair of fan-like hands that had turned into silver iron, it was not difficult to imagine that if this palm was slapped on someone, it would be enough to instantly turn anyone into dust!

"Drink!" Doctor Mo shouted loudly and slapped out with one palm.

In an instant, he only felt bursts of silver wind, and countless afterimages of palm prints were dazzling, almost impossible to distinguish with the naked eye, even accompanied by rolling black mist, which spread. Between the moves, it was dazzling!

Li Zhiming couldn’t even withstand the strong wind and squinted his eyes subconsciously.

"Boom!" Doctor Mo pushed out with both hands, just slapped forward, and with just one palm, the earth shook, and a huge pit instantly exploded! More than a meter wide!

Half a meter deep!

What a terrifying power! !

Li Zhiming watched and felt sweat pouring down his back.

Doctor Mo was still being conservative. If that palm had been used on him just now, he would have become mud and powder long ago. How could there have been any ridiculous attack and fight afterwards?

It was just letting out the water from the vast sea.

After his palms came out, Doctor Mo slowly retracted his hands. This palm seemed to have consumed a lot of his energy and spirit, so that he himself looked a bit clearer and more lifeless.

And on Doctor Mo’s face, which was facing away from Li Zhiming, there was also a bit of disinterest.

Just once, how much he could remember was all up to Li Zhiming.

But how to say it, those moves, in the eyes of ordinary children, were like performing a set of acrobatics.

He didn’t see anything clearly, and it was over.

But it happened that, in just one time, Li Zhiming had already remembered 70%!
