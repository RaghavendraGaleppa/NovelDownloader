# Chapter 92: Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance

Wang Tianli left, and Yang Ji fell into deep thought.

He had just obtained the peerless Dao-level formation, the Three Immortals Formation, and should have been delighted, yet a frown creased his brow. The arrival of the Three Immortals Formation instantly magnified his "poverty" to an infinite degree. He had roughly glanced at the formation's general description: it required three individuals to form. One main body, and two clones. To cultivate clones meant he would need to condense two more Heaven and Earth Dharma Idols.

Condensing a single Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol had almost exhausted all his resources; condensing two more would require a multiple increase in resources. Even if he succeeded in condensing the clones and forming the array, he couldn't very well send them into battle empty-handed. They would at least need some magical treasures. If he wanted to become a True Disciple, he would be facing genius masters in the early Spirit Transformation stage from across the entire Primordial Cultivation World, all vying for the same position. Low-grade treasured artifacts felt insufficient; he would need at least high-grade ones to be somewhat secure. If he could find one or two top-grade treasured artifacts, that would be even better.

Yet, this was only for the True Disciple competition, and the rivalry was already this intense. From Wang Tianli's tone, to kill a human-form Dao Tribulation, acquire the Origin of the Great Dao, and become a Son of the Great Dao, one would need at least one or two low-grade Dao artifacts to stand a chance. Perhaps even with low-grade Dao artifacts, the hope would be slim, because after becoming a True Disciple, the sect would directly reward a low-grade Dao artifact. True Disciples would essentially each possess a low-grade Dao artifact. Such individuals also had extremely strong comprehension, and their grand divine abilities were likely already perfected. If low-grade Dao artifacts were truly sufficient, there wouldn't only be ten Dao Sons. Clearly, it was very difficult.

Moreover, this was just for a one-on-one fight against a single Dao Tribulation. If he wanted to acquire more Origin of the Great Dao, he would need to contend with two, or even three or four Dao Tribulations. To win in such circumstances, low-grade Dao artifacts seemed insufficient. High-grade Dao artifacts were especially precious; many mighty cultivators in the Integration Stage didn't even possess them. Obtaining mid-grade or even high-grade Dao artifacts was incredibly difficult. The challenge in forging high-grade Dao artifacts lay in the materials. Such Dao-bearing artifacts couldn't be refined from mere mud or tree roots; they required the most supreme materials. For instance, things like green copper mother gold, purple-gold divine sand, Dao Tribulation immortal gold, profound yellow stone, chaos stone, iron mother, five-element stone, primordial star core, and so on – only these materials were worthy of crafting high-grade Dao artifacts. However, such materials couldn't be mass-produced like spirit herbs; they were truly born of heaven and earth, taking tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years to form. Each piece used was one less in existence. Over the years, such rare materials had become increasingly scarce and were virtually impossible to come by.

It was incredibly difficult, yet extremely important, to forge his own natal artifact, as it would likely accompany him throughout his entire cultivation journey. A person with grand ambitions like Yang Ji naturally placed immense importance on his own natal artifact. If the materials for forging a Dao artifact lacked the potential to evolve into an immortal artifact, he would consider his options very carefully.

Taking a step back, even if he acquired a high-grade Dao artifact, another fatal problem emerged in his desire to overcome the Dao Tribulation and obtain the Origin of the Great Dao: his root bone. Individuals with poorer root bones like him were disdained by the Great Dao and would face the strongest Dao Tribulations. It was simply "heaven-sent misfortune," and the situation was far from optimistic. Therefore, treasures capable of improving his root bone became another essential item for him.

In summary, resources for cultivating clones, magical treasures, spiritual items for improving root bones, divine abilities, and so on—all of these were enough to make him doubt his cultivation life. When one's ambition grew, poverty was exposed utterly and completely. Sometimes, he couldn't help but envy those minor cultivators who spent a few hundred happy years living ordinary, joyful lives. The more one strove towards immortality and the more one understood, the more one realized the difficulty of this path.

Clutching the jade slip of the Three Immortals Formation, Yang Ji felt a pang of emotion. He knew he still had a very long way to go, and many areas needed improvement. He put away the jade slip and, with a flick of his hand, took out a fist-sized purple fruit. Its surface glowed with a faint purple light, emitting an alluring fruity aroma. This was the Purple Sun Fruit obtained from the Hellish Refining Grounds, and he had three of them. These three were enough to elevate his medium-grade root bone to high-grade. This great fortune was largely thanks to Elder Chunye's generous gift. Yang Ji didn't hesitate. He immediately consumed all three Purple Sun Fruits, one after another, and silently refined their medicinal power.

Days passed in this manner. Three months later, the spiritual energy around him suddenly became richer and more vibrant than before. Some spiritual energy even vied to drill into his pores, seemingly eager to enter his body. Yang Ji naturally and delightedly noticed this unusual change. The entire reason was that his root bone had improved. Unbeknownst to him, it had quietly reached the high-grade level, thus causing the changes in spiritual energy. Without the need for cultivation techniques to guide it, spiritual energy eagerly converged. The affinity of a high-grade root bone for spiritual energy was indeed incomparable to that of a medium-grade one. And those Spirit Bodies, Saint Bodies, Dao Bodies, and Immortal Bodies – those physiques close to the Great Dao – each essentially carried a spirit-gathering array; their cultivation speed was simply unimaginable.

Yang Ji felt a slight sigh of emotion. After carefully sensing the changes in his root bone, he then consumed a Nine-Revolutions Golden Elixir.

One day later, his cultivation increased by 1400 cultivation points. Previously, cultivating for a day after consuming a Nine-Revolutions Golden Elixir only increased it by 700 cultivation points. This meant that his cultivation speed with a high-grade root bone had increased by 100% compared to a medium-grade one. Yang Ji currently still had a hundred bottles of even better Nascent Soul Elixirs. Theoretically, with his current high-grade root bone aptitude, consuming such elixirs could likely increase his cultivation by about 2000 points a day. This meant that if he continuously consumed such elixirs, he could reach the Nascent Soul Second Realm in about thirty-eight years. And if he wanted to condense Heaven and Earth Dharma Idols, having such elixirs would significantly shorten the time. However, only having one hundred bottles of Nascent Soul Elixirs was a problem.

Yang Ji pondered, then slowly rose, intending to visit the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance outside the sect. This Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance was documented in the book "Cultivation World." This force was backed by a Nine-Tribulation Loose Immortal and was one of the most powerful forces across the myriad realms. This merchant alliance's business spread to every corner of major worlds, possessing excellent information networks and abundant cultivation resources. Its foundation was so strong that it surpassed even the Boundless Dao Sect.

He planned to go and see if he could buy spiritual items that could enhance root bones with spirit stones, and also whether he could buy some top-tier artifact refining materials and cultivation elixirs, or spiritual materials for refining elixirs. Yang Ji had checked the Myriad Treasures Scroll; although the sect had some top-tier materials, they required enormous contribution points, a sum of hundreds of millions that he absolutely couldn't acquire in the short term. So he decided to try his luck at the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance. After all, a major force spanning myriad realms like this held unimaginable resources in its hands. If he could gain something, that would be for the best.
