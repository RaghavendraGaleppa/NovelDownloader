Chapter 529: Cultivation Reformation

Following Bi Yuan were the true core members of the True Martial Peak.

Xuezhen Taoist was withered like dead wood, with a peculiar appearance—half as vibrant as a youth, half as despondent as an elder.

His cultivation of the "Withering and Flourishing Art" had reached a profound level, his aura fluctuating between life and death.

Unfortunately, it was still a mundane technique, with its foundation rooted in the True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra. The Withering and Flourishing Art was decent as an offensive method.

Qing Ming, a woman in green warrior attire, carried an ancient longsword on her back. Her aura was as cold as ice, her gaze as sharp as lightning.

Since entering the Taihua Netherworld from the Divine Martial World, her sword cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds. Aside from Xu Yunfan, she was the foremost killer on True Martial Peak. Most importantly, regarding her appearance, she must have taken a Spring Reversal Pill, transforming from an old woman to a young maiden, her white hair turning black.

She looked quite beautiful, a world apart from her previous aged appearance.

Xu Yunfan silently evaluated her without showing any expression.

N老头 (Mud Old Man), short and sturdy, carried a faint aura intertwined with Earth Metal and Gen Metal, like a stubborn stone.

He cultivated the "Earth Metal Gen Metal Art," skilled in defense, nurturing spiritual objects, and surveying veins, making him a cornerstone figure of True Martial Peak.

The Hemp-Clothed Old Taoist had a ethereal aura, his gaze murky yet profound, as if half-awake, as if immersed in a peculiar dream.

As for the previous Sect Master Zhang Ziyang, he did not manifest at this moment. His Divine Travel Dharmakaya was hidden deep within the Ten Thousand Soul Banner in Xu Yunfan's storage ring, nurturing.

Zhang Ziyang cultivated the "Mysterious Spirit Transformation Dao," a wondrous technique focused on soul cultivation and controlling spectral spirits. He was a leader of the Dao Sect in the Divine Martial World and now served as a crucial ace under Xu Yunfan.

With his peerless talent, as long as he was used appropriately, his future would be boundless.

These old subordinates had all survived the brutal trials of the Divine Martial World, possessing rich experience, and were all from the Dao Sect, making them loyal and reliable.

As for Bi Yuan, as Xu Yunfan's master in the Divine Martial World, he was also the only core advisor within the Primordial Demon Sect whom Xu Yunfan could confide in.

"Please take a seat, Elders," Xu Yunfan gestured, then took out the Ten Thousand Soul Banner. This dark banner had been nourished within his dantian, washed by his Dharmic Power day and night, and refined by the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi. It was now a top-tier magic treasure with its own mystique, slowly converging with the Zodiac Star Commander Flags he envisioned.

After releasing Zhang Ziyang, there were no pleasantries; they got straight to the point.

He detailed the entire process of witnessing Chu Chengnan's tragic failure to prove the Dao at Cold Crow Pass, especially emphasizing the terror of the "Human Calamity" that blocked the path without adhering to martial ethics, and how the Bodhi Zen Pure Land schemed against the "True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra," severing the path to the Divine Martial Dao Fruit, and luring disciples who cultivated this sutra as reserve forces "fated with the Buddha."

The atmosphere in the cave dwelling instantly became heavy and oppressive.

Even though Bi Yuan and the others had witnessed the cruelty of the Divine Martial World, they still felt a chill rise up their spines at the ruthless methods and naked obstruction of the top-tier True Lords of the Taihua Netherworld.

However, Xu Yunfan's tone then shifted as he spoke of encountering Ancestor Lu Chunyang at the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect. Both Bi Yuan and Zhang Ziyang's group were visibly excited.

It was understandable, as they had grown up in the Dao Sect, hearing the deeds of Ancestor Chunyang since childhood.

Bi Yuan sighed, "It's a pity my cultivation is still low. If I have the chance, I must pay respects to Ancestor Chunyang."

Zhang Ziyang nodded repeatedly, his face filled with longing.

"Ancestor Chunyang is a peerless figure throughout the ages. The world says he ascended in broad daylight, yet he actually came to this Taihua Netherworld and became a Golden Core True Lord. It was truly不容易 (not easy)."

After another round of excited discussion, once everyone had calmed down slightly, Xu Yunfan spoke.

"The 'True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra' has now become a dead end. To remain on this path is not only to cut off one's own future but also to place oneself in a position of being slaughtered like fish on a cutting board."

Xu Yunfan's voice was resolute. "I have decided that all disciples of True Martial Peak, from top to bottom, must immediately switch to cultivating a new technique: the 'Mysterious Celestial Nine Palaces True Dome Indestructible Sutra.' This technique was bestowed by Ancestor Chunyang. Its karma is untainted, so we no longer need to worry about other things."

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over everyone.

Bi Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest and said solemnly, "This is the way to break the deadlock and seek survival. We shall obey Yunfan's command!"

Xuezhen, Qing Ming, Mud Old Man, the Hemp-Clothed Old Taoist, and the will fluctuations from Zhang Ziyang within the Ten Thousand Soul Banner also expressed unconditional agreement and allegiance.

Xu Yunfan nodded. "This 'Mysterious Celestial Nine Palaces True Dome Indestructible Sutra' is vast and profound, with infinite power, pointing directly to the supreme Thunder Method and the true meaning of the Nine Heavens' True Dome Indestructibility. It is both a Thunder Method and a top-tier wondrous technique for refining the physical body and soul with thunder.

Its Dao Fruit is vacant, not hidden in the world, and its potential is even greater. It is the orthodox method bestowed by Ancestor Chunyang, originally held by the Mysterious Origin Sect's Mysterious Celestial Nine Palaces True Lord. Now, it is perfectly legitimate for us to cultivate it. Today, I shall impart this true sutra to you all."

He did not delay any further. With a flick of his finger, several purple dots of light containing vast thunder intent shot out and embedded themselves between the brows of Bi Yuan, Xuezhen, Qing Ming, Mud Old Man, and the Hemp-Clothed Old Taoist.

At the same time, a trace of pure Mysterious Celestial True Yuan was also projected into the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, branding itself deep within Zhang Ziyang's soul.

Upon receiving the inheritance of the true sutra, everyone's bodies trembled, and their faces showed expressions of shock and ecstasy.

This sutra, pointing directly to the Heavenly and Earthly Fiends and containing majestic heavenly might, was far superior in its lofty conception and solid foundation to any technique they had encountered before.

After the transmission was complete, everyone was still immersed in the profound insights. Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment and said, "The path of cultivation involves wealth, companions, methods, and location, with 'wealth' being the foremost.

The resources and supplies at the peak are running low. The Mysterious Origin Sect is a place where the strong prey on the weak. All necessary resources must be procured by ourselves.

I possess another secret technique for artifact refining, the 'Mysterious Capital Eight Scenery Cloud Manual for Forging Heaven and Creation.' Its method is mysteriously unpredictable, pointing directly to the pinnacle of the artifact refining path. If one can refine one of the Eight Sceneries, refining magic treasures becomes as easy as turning one's hand..."

Xu Yunfan paused, his gaze carrying a gravity he had never shown before.

"However, this secret technique involves immense karma. Although Ancestor Chunyang of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect severed the past connections with a supreme sword intent, I cannot be completely certain if there are still unforeseen risks within.

For the sake of stability, today I will only impart to you the basic artifact refining method and the technique for condensing the 'Eight Scenery Cloud Qi,' which can serve as an auxiliary strange fire for artifact refining.

With this foundation, it is sufficient to refine excellent artifacts and magic treasures, enough to become an important source of wealth for our peak in the future.

If any disciple within the peak shows talent in artifact refining, they may learn this basic chapter. After making progress, they can exchange for deeper artifact refining essentials based on their contributions."

As for the fundamental inheritance of the 'Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries,' Xu Yunfan naturally would not teach it.

This method was one of his trump cards. Although he did not know which figure from the Mysterious Origin Sect had released it as bait, now that Ancestor Chunyang had severed the fishing line with one sword, the other party would be constrained and certainly would not dare to show their face.

Their scheme was vast.

Bi Yuan and the others were deeply moved in their hearts.

A secret technique that Ancestor Chunyang personally出手 (took action) to sever its karma—its level and the weight of its karma were unimaginable. Everyone deeply agreed and solemnly acknowledged it.
