# Chapter 141: Alliance

The temples of Patriarch Tianxuan had already begun to gray. After speaking about the Yin-Yang Divine Light, he changed the subject.  

"Since you can cultivate the Taiyi Primordial Divine Light, you must be more suited to the Yin-Yang Divine Light than I am. If you're interested, I can give you my cultivation insights from these years."  

"In that case, I thank you, Dao Brother." Zhou Qing did not refuse. He knew that the current number one human cultivator in the Jingyang Dao Domain was merely arranging his final affairs.  

Patriarch Tianxuan said, "Seeing a prodigy like you appear at this time leaves me with few regrets. Remember, in the days to come, your first priority is to preserve yourself. You are the last hope for humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain."  

Zhou Qing asked, "Dao Brother, is there any other way to extend your lifespan?"  

With just a glance, he could sense the irreversible decline of Patriarch Tianxuan's vitality. Zhou Qing understood clearly that the patriarch's chances of forming an infant soul were slim, and his remaining time was short.  

Patriarch Tianxuan replied, "Originally, I planned to take down a few late-stage Golden Core great demons like Bai Yue before my death to ease the pressure on humanity. But now that I've seen you, I've decided to activate another contingency plan. However, within a hundred years, the old monster Howling Moon will likely break free from the Demon-Sealing Pillar set up by Senior Jingyang. By then, if you haven't reached Nascent Soul strength, you must hide yourself well."  

He paused, glancing at the Shattered Moon Blade in Zhou Qing's hand. "You did well this time. If you hadn't noticed the anomaly with the White Moon Wolf Clan's Holy Son and intercepted this blade, the old monster's escape would have been much sooner."  

Zhou Qing asked, "So the Howling Moon monster is actually sealed?"  

He had always thought the Howling Moon monster was merely bound by an oath. Learning that it was physically sealed brought him some relief.  

Patriarch Tianxuan explained, "An oath alone couldn't have restrained the old monster for three hundred years. Without Nascent Soul strength, it's impossible to contend with him. Next, I will use the Spirit-Sealing Tower to lock away all my spiritual power and vitality. Unless it's a matter of life and death for all of you, do not open the tower. Originally, I intended to entrust this decision to Jin Guang, but now I see you are the most suitable candidate."  

After that, Patriarch Tianxuan spoke little more, only granting Zhou Qing the highest authority over Tianxuan City. Once he entered the Spirit-Sealing Tower and fell into slumber, the city would be led by Zhou Qing, with Jin Guang as his deputy.  

This was a critical moment for the survival of humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain. He no longer had the time to investigate Zhou Qing's origins, heritage, or other details.  

He had confirmed two things: first, Zhou Qing was not a demonic cultivator, and second, Zhou Qing's potential and strength surpassed Jin Guang's.  

That was enough.  

His greatest request for Zhou Qing was to preserve himself. As for Tianxuan City, it should be defended if possible.  

Patriarch Tianxuan felt his greatest mission had been fulfilled with the emergence of Zhou Qing and Jin Guang as Golden Core cultivators. Even if Jin Guang's foundation and potential were ordinary, any Golden Core cultivator had the chance to form an infant soul—though Jin Guang's chances were exceedingly slim.  

The key to reversing humanity's fortunes lay in producing a Nascent Soul cultivator.  

Patriarch Tianxuan had come close to success.  

But failure was failure, no matter how close he had been.  

For him, he had done all he could and had no regrets.  

In truth, if not for his unwavering belief in protecting humanity, he would never have reached the Golden Core Perfection stage. Conviction was a powerful driving force for cultivators to break through bottlenecks.  

With his talent and conviction, he had met all the conditions for forming an infant soul. Unfortunately, his luck had been poor. Had he found the Yin-Yang Jade Tablet left by Jingyang Zhenren, he would undoubtedly have succeeded.

At the White Moon Wolf Clan's sacred grounds, before the Demon-Sealing Pillar.  

"Ancestor, shall we let this matter rest?" Bai Yue had taken human form.  

For Golden Core-level great demons, shapeshifting into human form was no difficult feat. Special bloodlines like the White Moon Wolf Clan could even assume human form at the Foundation Establishment stage, though they retained some beastly features.  

Of course, their true forms were where their combat strength peaked. Many Golden Core-level great demons preferred their natural forms in daily life.  

From beneath the Demon-Sealing Pillar, Howling Moon spoke calmly, "That human brat has great potential, but as long as Tianxuan lives, you won't get a chance to kill him. This time, I projected my consciousness onto Greedy Wolf. Though the brat eventually saw through it, I confirmed the effectiveness of my Soul-Splitting Art. Within a hundred years, I will break free. No matter how talented that brat is, he won't reach Nascent Soul in a century. However, once Tianxuan's death is confirmed, you must spare no effort to eliminate him."  

Bai Yue said, "This matter requires careful discussion with the other demon kings."  

Once human cultivators reached the Golden Core stage, their life-preserving techniques, magical treasures, talismans, and combat experience made them exceptionally difficult to kill, even for peers of the same realm.  

Moreover, Zhou Qing was no ordinary Golden Core cultivator.  

But no matter how extraordinary he was, facing the combined assault of multiple demon kings would be certain death.  

The plan to ambush Zhou Qing required thorough deliberation among the demon kings to refine the details. The moment news of Patriarch Tianxuan's death emerged, they would act immediately.  

The demonic beasts had long suffered under Tianxuan's suppression. Even without Howling Moon's reminder, Bai Yue and the others would never allow a second Tianxuan to emerge.  

---  

The Blood Demon Sect's leader and the Blackwater Sect's leader met.  

"Qing Lingzi has indeed formed a Golden Core. His strength even surpasses Jin Guang's. It seems Tianxuan will entrust Tianxuan City to him," the Blackwater Sect leader said flatly.  

The Blood Demon Sect leader replied, "So what? Tianxuan City will never fall into our hands."  

The Blackwater Sect leader said, "Qing Lingzi's Golden Core formation must be related to the Divine Water Palace's legacy. You must have guessed as much."  

The Blood Demon Sect leader retorted, "Every Golden Core cultivator has their secrets. Do you think we don't?"  

The Blackwater Sect leader frowned. "We've been stuck at mid-Golden Core for years. Don't you want to advance further?"  

The Blood Demon Sect leader asked, "What do you propose?"  

The Blackwater Sect leader said, "Now that he's taking over Tianxuan City, he surely has no use for the Divine Water Palace's artifacts. I hope you'll join me in negotiating the return of the Blackwater Divine Stele fragments from the palace. After all, our four demonic sects have supported Tianxuan City for years."  

The Blood Demon Sect leader nodded. "Very well, let's proceed as you suggest."  

---  

After returning from Tianxuan City to Desolate Ridge, Zhou Qing first received Crane Sage and other cultivators. As for Jin Guang, he had returned to Tianxuan City, as Patriarch Tianxuan had further instructions for him—likely regarding Zhou Qing's takeover of the city.  

Patriarch Tianxuan undoubtedly hoped Jin Guang would prioritize the greater good and harbor no resentment.  

Besides, in the cultivation world, strength commanded respect.  

Having witnessed Zhou Qing's power, Jin Guang would naturally feel uneasy about leading Tianxuan City himself.  

However, Zhou Qing intended to delegate much of Tianxuan City's authority to Jin Guang. Once Zhang Jingxiu and the others reached the Golden Core stage, they could gradually share the responsibilities.  

For now, Zhou Qing needed time to consolidate his cultivation and further improve his strength.  

With Tianxuan City's support, the Dao Court's development would proceed more smoothly.  

Unity and stability were paramount at this juncture.  

Crane Sage was also treated with courtesy.  

Judging by actions rather than intentions, Crane Sage's timely support before Zhou Qing's appearance was a significant favor.  

"Daoist Crane, should you need anything in the future, seek out my senior brother Fu Song. We will assist however we can," Zhou Qing said warmly.  

Crane Sage hurriedly expressed his gratitude.  

To him, Qing Lingzi now seemed approachable and amiable. Forming ties with such a figure was far preferable to dealing with the scheming Jin Guang.  

Zhou Qing also thanked Ye Chong.  

Regardless, under Zhou Qing's humble and affable demeanor, past grievances were set aside.  

What stood out was that Qing Lingzi, despite his Golden Core status, remained unassuming—a gesture that deeply moved Crane Sage, Ye Chong, and the others.  

In the cultivation world, the strong dominating the weak was the norm.  

But when someone of great strength still treated others with humility—even if it was mere pretense—it left a far better impression.  

After seeing them off, six days later, the beast tide dispersed.  

Then, two overwhelming auras appeared on the horizon, swiftly arriving above Desolate Ridge.  

"Qin Fang of the Blood Demon Sect congratulates Daoist Qing Lingzi on his Golden Core formation. May you enjoy boundless blessings and carefree immortality."  

"Meng Xuan of the Blackwater Sect congratulates Daoist Qing Lingzi on his Golden Core formation."  

The appearance of these two mid-Golden Core demonic sect leaders instantly froze the atmosphere.  

"You must have other matters to discuss. Speak plainly," Zhou Qing said, manifesting as a sword-light before the two.  

Meng Xuan of the Blackwater Sect said, "Since Daoist Qing Lingzi is direct, I'll be frank. Years ago, you must have visited the Divine Water Palace, correct?"  

"Indeed. But why bring this up now after so long?"  

Qin Fang smiled. "The Divine Water Palace's restrictions are complex. You must have encountered many puzzles back then. Coincidentally, Daoist Meng possesses a map of the palace, which we offer as a congratulatory gift. When the palace reopens, your disciples will find exploration much easier."  

Meng Xuan's face twisted in confusion before realization dawned—he had been betrayed by Qin Fang. Though he had no intention of antagonizing Zhou Qing after his Golden Core breakthrough, he was unwilling to relinquish the Divine Water Palace's secrets. He had hoped to pressure Zhou Qing first, then offer a compromise to settle the matter through negotiation.  

But Qin Fang had outright sold him out.  

Zhou Qing looked at Meng Xuan. "Is this true, Daoist Meng?"  

At that moment, Jin Guang's aura rapidly approached Desolate Ridge.  

Zhou Qing had already notified Jin Guang via a message talisman when the two arrived. With Tianxuan City now under their joint leadership and Patriarch Tianxuan unlikely to reappear, the four demonic sects would inevitably covet the city. After returning to Tianxuan City and receiving the patriarch's instructions, Jin Guang had agreed to a mutual defense pact with Zhou Qing.  

Meng Xuan's expression darkened as he glared at Qin Fang. Suppressing his fury, he produced a jade slip. "Daoist Qing Lingzi, here is the map of the Divine Water Palace."  

Zhou Qing accepted it. Without another word, Meng Xuan transformed into a black water dragon, its scales vividly lifelike, and soared away.  

The unleashed power of a Golden Core cultivator rumbled like thunder over Desolate Ridge, lingering for a long time.  

Zhou Qing felt no anger—gaining the Divine Water Palace map for free was a pleasant surprise. He turned to Qin Fang. "Thank you for this, Daoist Qin."  

Meanwhile, Jin Guang arrived. Seeing Meng Xuan's departure, he sighed in relief.  

A clash with two demonic sect leaders would have been unwinnable, and internal strife among humans would have alerted the demonic beasts, leading to disastrous consequences.  

Qin Fang said, "I've long known about the Divine Water Palace. The Blackwater Sect had also uncovered clues. Had you not remained hidden all these years, they would have pressured you sooner."  

Zhou Qing asked, "Then why show me such goodwill?"  

Qin Fang replied, "My daughter Qing'er turned misfortune into fortune, reviving through the True Demon's Blood. In doing so, I glimpsed the secrets of refining it. I should thank you for that. This matter ultimately benefits my Blood Demon Sect, so I hope you bear no grudges."  

Zhou Qing understood—Meng Xuan had likely been outmaneuvered by Qin Fang. Logically, Zhou Qing's killing of Qin Qing, the Blood Demon Sect's Holy Maiden, in the Divine Water Palace should have made them enemies.  

Meng Xuan, coveting the palace's secrets and aware of the Blood Demon Sect's knowledge, had sought to negotiate with Zhou Qing to settle the matter.  

But Qin Fang cared little for the palace's secrets, using Meng Xuan to curry favor with Zhou Qing instead.  

Fearing a trap when Qin Fang betrayed him and Jin Guang arrived swiftly, Meng Xuan handed over the map without hesitation, signaling his peaceful intentions.  

Under normal circumstances, Meng Xuan wouldn't have feared Zhou Qing. But with Qin Fang's scheming, he had no choice but to reconsider.  

If Zhou Qing, Qin Fang, and Jin Guang had joined forces, Meng Xuan would have fled severely wounded, his cultivation crippled.  

The four demonic sects competed fiercely among themselves. A weakened Meng Xuan would have been easy prey for the other three.  

Such was the ruthless nature of demonic cultivators.  

The crux lay in greed.  

Qin Fang's indifference to the Divine Water Palace's secrets allowed him to exploit Meng Xuan, distancing the Blackwater Sect while allying with Zhou Qing.  

As a Golden Core cultivator and Tianxuan City's future leader, Zhou Qing was a valuable ally.  

Though Zhou Qing saw through Qin Fang's motives, he found no fault. Instead, it meant he now had a powerful ally among the four demonic sects.  

The two were a perfect match.  

When Jin Guang arrived, his existing rapport with Qin Fang solidified the alliance.  

Thus, the three Golden Core powerhouses formed an unshakable triumvirate, each fulfilling their needs.  

One was a rogue cultivator unaffiliated with Tianxuan City, another was the patriarch of a deeply rooted cultivation family within the city, and the third was a demonic sect leader. Their bases of power did not conflict.  

Instead, their alliance would forge an indomitable force in the post-Tianxuan era.
