# Chapter 99: Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer, Perfection!

After eating, Xu Yunfan found a separate courtyard to stay in. After a brief rest, he began to cultivate his martial arts.

Although he had been traveling non-stop these past few days, he would cultivate whenever he had the time. If there was no place to practice his moves, he would meditate and practice the Seal of Silence.

The Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer was about to reach perfection, and now he naturally wanted to take it a step further.

Currently, he had put aside all other martial arts. Aside from the Seal of Silence to restore his spirit, he was fully dedicating himself to cultivating this technique.

For three consecutive days, Xu Yunfan immersed himself in cultivating the Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer.

In his vision, the proficiency on his attribute panel would increase slightly every time he practiced several times. As he drew closer to the perfection realm, the increase in proficiency became increasingly difficult.

Yet, it was still steadily approaching five thousand proficiency points.

Xu Yunfan no longer had the idea of rushing his journey; he felt he could completely put the Tiangong Cave matter on hold for now.

With the daily supplement of two meals of exotic beast spiritual fish from the Changfeng Tavern, swallowing the Yuan Gu Dan bought from the Hundred Herbs Valley for twenty taels each, and the continuous cultivation of the Seal of Silence, his spirit grew increasingly sharp, and his comprehension rose along with it.

His skin refinement was at perfection, steadily approaching the next level.

Until a month later, late at night, in the rented courtyard.

He grabbed two eight-sided stone locks, his spine cracking segment by segment like pine waves.

The whistling sound of the stone locks swinging through the air startled the birds sleeping on the eaves. The exposed muscles on his back bulged like waves, twisting into the shape of a dragon with his movements.

When the ninth "Wind-Wrapping" motion was fully swung, the veins in his arms jumped like bowstrings. Under the boiling of his internal blood energy, his body was like a furnace, constantly radiating heat. The temperature of the entire courtyard rose by ten degrees, and the sweat drops falling from his body actually scorched white smoke on the blue bricks.

The seventh move, "Hanging Golden Bell," suddenly rose, and his heel, wrapped in iron-hard deerskin boots, slammed down on the top of the training post.

He knelt amidst the shattered bricks, gasping for breath. The hot mist rising from his body condensed into a blood-colored frost, covering his sweat-drenched back. The Extreme Dao Remains he had been wearing felt somewhat sticky.

*You continuously cultivate the Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer, comprehending the power of hardness and softness. Your force application becomes more fluid. Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer proficiency has increased.*

*You are in seclusion, bitterly cultivating the Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer, day and night without stop. On this day, you swing your hammer with full force and actually feel the blood energy in your body moving like dragons and snakes, perfectly matching the hammer intent. When applying force, it is as fierce as splitting mountains and cracking stones; when retracting force, it is as soft as twisting a finger. Amidst the whistling of the hammer shadows, your understanding of the changes between hardness and softness deepens another layer. Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer proficiency has increased.*

*Your Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer has entered the Perfection realm.*

*Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer (Perfection)*

*Special Effects: Boiling Blood Burns Frost, Force Penetrates the Hundred Bones, Iron Cloak Covers the Body, Dragon Sinew and Tiger Bones, Impervious to Blades, Can Bear Mountains, Cauldron-Lifting Strength, Heavy Hammer at Will.*

Moonlight fell upon his bronze-colored shoulders. Suddenly, dozens of snake-like ridges of fascia bulged beneath the skin, constantly writhing and crawling over his body, moving up and down.

The moment the system notification indicated he had entered the Perfection realm, large streams of heat appeared out of nowhere within his body, continuously seeping into his flesh and skin along his four limbs and hundred bones.

*Crack!*

The instant Xu Yunfan's spine arched, the fascia on his back sounded like a hundred strong bows twisting their strings simultaneously. Dozens of snake-like fascias suddenly twisted together into a dragon-spine iron chain. A clicking sound of mechanisms locking together exploded from within his flesh and skin, shaking the blue bricks beneath his feet until they cracked in a spiderweb pattern.

Deep within his abdominal cavity, it was as if a volcano had erupted. Magma-like blood energy boiled and surged upward. Every blood vessel turned into the bellows of a forge. The arteries on his neck swelled like a snake swallowing an elephant, and the pulsing rhythm of his temples beat like a muffled drum.

His arm muscles continued to swell, and every muscle seemed to have a life of its own, pulsing autonomously.

Muscle fibers intertwined and wrapped around each other, like refined steel being forged. Under the repeated beating of the heat currents, they became even more tenacious. The surface of his originally tight muscles took on the bluish-grey hue of cooling cast iron.

The cuticle thickened and cracked at a visible speed, and then peeled off piece by piece like a snake shedding its skin. The new skin had the matte luster of cracked porcelain. Beneath that jade-like surface, faint golden textures undulated with his breath, like underground magma surging through basalt veins. With a slight exertion of force, fine, magma-like blood lines could be seen jumping on the surface of his skin.

Flashes of large segments of cultivating the Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer appeared in his mind.

Xu Yunfan recalled standing in a desolate valley, facing the fierce astral wind, swinging the玄Iron Wind-Wrapping Hammer, day after day.

The wind from the hammer howled, the surrounding trees were cut to pieces, the fierce wind cut his skin like blades, leaving crisscrossing bloodstains, yet he never stopped.

In a deep underground cave, scorching magma heat waves rolled. He stood to the side, every breath carrying the searing heat.

When fighting a master, the sword shadows and cold light flashed, the sword wind pressing right against his throat. Xu Yunfan took it head-on with the Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer. Hammer and sword clashed, sparks flew. In the split second between life and death, he comprehended the change between hardness and softness in force, successfully repelled the strong enemy, and his cultivation improved.

These scenes flashed rapidly through his mind. Xu Yunfan immersed himself in them, his understanding of the essence of the Red Forged Copper Body and Wind-Wrapping Hammer becoming deeper, his Perfection realm more stable, and the aura around his body growing stronger.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan exhaled a breath that shot out like an arrow, cracking the porcelain plate on the stone table in front of him. He took out a knife and slashed heavily at his arm, but not even a white mark appeared.

Impervious to weapons!

Moreover, his strength had at least doubled compared to before.

No wonder, no wonder Li Haomiao said that Great Completion and Perfection were two different worlds. Those who have perfected skin, muscle, and bone can defeat opponents of a higher level as easily as eating and drinking. For those top sect disciples from aristocratic families and major sects, even if they don't have secret martial arts to enhance their potential, if a genius has perfected just one of the three—skin, muscle, or bone—it is something ordinary martial artists can hardly even look up to.

A feeling of needing to vent his energy made him want to swing the eight-sided stone locks. But just as he was about to, the whistling sound of the stone locks suddenly stopped abruptly.

A fluffy bun hairstyle suddenly popped up over the neighboring wall, three strands of sticking-up hair on the bun, looking exactly like a startled quail.

*Bang!*

In the dull sound of the stone lock hitting the ground, that tuft of sticking-up hair suddenly jumped half a foot high.

"Here it comes again! Here it comes again! Swinging stone locks at the third watch of the midnight hour! Big Hero, are you keeping watch for King Yama or repairing a temple for the Earth God? Clattering and banging non-stop."

The girl stretched her arm out over the wall, holding a clothes-drying pole and banging it against the tiles, her face full of anger.

"The day before yesterday, your hammer shattered the pickled vegetable jar I brought with great difficulty from Dao City! Yesterday, you scared away the old hen I specifically bought! If you smash it again tonight..."

Before she could finish, a pair of calloused hands suddenly appeared on the wall.

A man in a grey short-gown, revealing sturdy muscles, hung half his body over the wall, his left hand covering his daughter's mouth with a practiced, heartbreakingly familiar motion.

"Please forgive me, Young Hero! I've disturbed your practice. My daughter is like a firecracker; she explodes everywhere at the slightest spark."

He dangled a package wrapped in oil paper with his right hand. "This is the thousand-layer pastry from Granny Wang's on East Street, consider it an apology... Hey!"

The girl bit her father's tiger's mouth, and when she broke free, the cowlick on her head pointed straight at Xu Yunfan.
