# Chapter 26: Koi Fish  

Gu Mo activated his sleeve dimension technique and tossed the red koi along with its basin into the black mist space. Without lingering in the market, he left immediately. His spirit stones were limited, and he needed to save some to activate the formation disk, so he couldn't afford to spend them all.  

Once outside the market, the flight restriction lifted. Gu Mo immediately took out the paper crane he had just purchased. As he channeled spiritual energy into it, the crane transformed into a white crane as tall as a person.  

Leaping onto the crane, Gu Mo urged it forward with his spiritual energy. The crane flapped its wings and took off. Though its speed couldn't compare to the high-speed flight of a flying sword, it was at least as fast as an electric scooter.  

"Having a means of transportation really makes a difference," Gu Mo mused as he sat atop the crane. Soon, he spotted the valley where the Spirit Plant Hall was located.  

His purpose for visiting the Spirit Plant Hall was to collect the next season's rice seeds. The reason he didn't save seeds from his own harvest was simple: aside from the fact that he had three years of free seeds from the hall, the seeds provided by the Spirit Plant Hall were specially cultivated. Only these seeds could achieve the highest possible yield.  

Using saved seeds would not only reduce the yield but also slow the growth rate.  

For this second season, Gu Mo still chose Spirit Jade Rice. With his previous experience, he was confident he could achieve an even higher yield. Among the five spells exclusive to spirit farmers, only the Minor Revitalization Technique remained unmastered. He planned to attempt cultivating higher-tier spirit plants only after mastering this final spell.  

Growing advanced spirit plants would significantly speed up his accumulation of sect contributions, allowing him to exchange for the Concealing Qi Technique sooner.  

However, the higher the tier of the spirit plant, the more difficult it was to cultivate. A single misstep could lead to failure, wasting an entire season's time and effort.  

Thus, Gu Mo didn't dare take risks lightly. He would only attempt it after mastering all the spirit farmer spells.  

Upon returning to his spirit field cottage on the paper crane, Gu Mo immediately replanted the three Sunflowers from the black mist space. Then, he placed the red koi he had bought into a water vat. Once the new season's rice was planted, he would test the effects of Sun Essence on the koi.  

"Time to begin planting the new season's spirit rice," Gu Mo murmured as he stood before his field, gazing at the leftover stalks. He formed a hand seal and waved his hand, releasing a wave of flames that incinerated all the stalks, turning them to ash and enriching the soil.  

The flames also destroyed any insect eggs that might have been lurking in the field. During the previous season, Gu Mo had encountered almost no pest problems—a benefit of cultivating a fallow field for the first time. But this second season, he would need to be vigilant.  

Preventing pests was crucial to ensuring a good harvest.  

"Minor Earth Dragon Technique!"  

After casting the Minor Flame Wave, Gu Mo formed another hand seal and pointed at the field. A thick, basin-sized earthworm emerged, burrowing through the soil with ease. In moments, the entire field had been tilled—far faster and more efficiently than if Gu Mo had used a hoe.  

The earthworm also helped circulate spiritual energy in the soil, creating a better environment for the plants. With the field prepared, Gu Mo scattered the Spirit Jade Rice seeds in an orderly pattern.  

"Minor Cloud Rain Technique!"  

As the seeds settled, Gu Mo cast his third spirit farmer spell. Dark clouds gathered above the field, and a light rain of spiritual energy began to fall, watering the freshly sown seeds.  

"Done!"  

Gu Mo exhaled deeply. Casting three spells in succession would have been too taxing for most spirit farmers, but thanks to his triple the usual spiritual energy reserves, he managed it effortlessly.  

The efficiency of using spells for farming was undeniable. In just a short while, he had completed what would take other farmers days—and with far better results.  

With the planting finished, Gu Mo took out the damaged formation disk. He removed the formation stones and buried them around the field according to the disk's instructions.  

Next, he inserted eighteen spirit stones into the disk to power it. The cost pained him—eighteen stones just to activate one formation, whereas a standard first-tier disk required only nine.  

Fortunately, the formation could enter a low-energy standby mode when not in use, only consuming stones rapidly when activated.  

The damaged disk offered two options: an illusion formation or a defensive formation. Gu Mo chose the illusion formation, as non-confrontational formations consumed less energy. A defensive formation would drain spirit stones at a terrifying rate if attacked.  

After placing the disk in the field, Gu Mo returned to his cottage with the control talisman and turned his attention to the red koi in the water vat.  

Sensing his gaze, the koi swam to the surface, its mouth opening and closing as if begging for food.  

Gu Mo took out a Sun Essence from the black mist space and fed it to the fish. The moment the essence entered its mouth, the koi flipped belly-up.  

"Ah—did it die?"  

Panicked, Gu Mo quickly checked the fish's belly. It was still alive—just unconscious.  

After observing the koi for a while and seeing no further changes, Gu Mo shifted his focus to mastering the Minor Revitalization Technique. He wanted to learn this final spell as soon as possible.  

The next morning, Gu Mo got up to water his field and glanced at the vat. The koi was swimming peacefully again.  

Relieved, he reached in to examine it. The koi, which had swallowed a Sun Essence, showed no resistance as he picked it up.  

"Hmm?"  

Upon closer inspection, Gu Mo noticed something unusual. The originally all-red koi now had three golden scales—shimmering like the sun.  

There was a change, but what did it mean?  

Seeing the koi still opening and closing its mouth, Gu Mo tossed it back into the vat. Unlike cats or dogs, which could develop intelligence as pseudo-spirit beasts, fish were far harder to enlighten.  

Getting answers from the koi was impossible for now, but at least the Sun Essence had clearly affected it.  

Continuing to feed it Sun Essence might reveal more effects, but Gu Mo's primary goal was to save up for more Sunflowers.  

In sixteen days, he could buy his fourth Sunflower. Twelve days after that, he could get his fifth. The more Sunflowers he had, the faster he could acquire new ones.  

However, given his current strength and status, there was a limit to how many Sunflowers he could safely possess. Too many would make them difficult to conceal, and if their secret were discovered, he'd be in grave danger.  

Five Sunflowers seemed like a safe number. If he activated the illusion formation in his field, he might even stretch it to ten.  

But maintaining the formation required spirit stones, so Gu Mo would need to earn enough to sustain it long-term.
