# Chapter 157: Departure

In the Shangyuan Qingjing Heavenly Grotto.

Within an immortal island cave abode.

The modest reception hall was unusually packed with dozens of people, creating a somewhat crowded atmosphere. Among them, five Nascent Soul realm cultivators with terrifyingly profound auras clearly stood out as leaders. A subtle tension quietly permeated the air.

Yet.

Behind the crowd.

A young man clad in golden robes, his face bearing a faint trace of arrogance, revealed an almost imperceptible glint of excitement in his eyes—a stark contrast to the expressions of those around him.

Deep within his sea of consciousness.

A voice suddenly spoke up.

"Master, about this so-called Proud Cloud Secret Realm the senior brothers mentioned—can I really participate? Isn't it too soon? I've been in the Upper Realm for less than forty years, while those competing in the secret realm have supposedly honed their Foundation Establishment for one or two centuries. They sound terrifying."

As his words faded.

A dim radiance flickered to life.

Gradually, it coalesced into the figure of an elderly man missing half his body.

"Under my guidance, you've successfully fused the Dao Intent of Dual Five Elements into your Aurora Magnetic Dao Foundation, giving birth to the power of Dual Five-Element Magnetic Annihilation. With this, you may not be invincible among Foundation Establishment cultivators, but you'll certainly rank among the strongest."

"Securing a spot in the top ten is guaranteed, and the first place isn't beyond your reach either!"

The elderly figure declared.

His weathered voice carried an unmistakable note of pride.

"But what about the Myriad Spirits lineage? I heard they'll also send Foundation Establishment geniuses to compete."

The young man asked doubtfully.

"Those furred, feathered, or spawned creatures? Hardly worth fearing."

"My disciple, you've reached the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment. This Proud Cloud Secret Realm presents the perfect opportunity to amass vast amounts of karmic fortune and resources—fuel for your future Golden Core cultivation. You mustn't miss it."

The elderly figure advised solemnly.

"Thank you for your guidance, Master."

Hearing this, boundless confidence surged within the young man's heart.

At that moment.

The silence in the cave abode was abruptly broken.

"Fellow junior brothers, how should we approach this Proud Cloud Secret Realm?"

The leading Nascent Soul cultivator inquired.

His handsome yet authoritative face bore a trace of helplessness.

"Senior Brother, Ge Qingshen was clearly eligible to participate in the last Proud Cloud Secret Realm, yet the Celestial lineage forcibly held him back to refine his skills for another century. Their ambition is plain to see. If he returns as the top Foundation Establishment cultivator and catches the attention of the True Monarchs..."

Another Nascent Soul cultivator shook his head and sighed with concern:

"Meanwhile, our Nine Domains lineage currently lacks any Foundation Establishment genius capable of matching him. The Celestial lineage might exploit this situation again."

"While we disciples of the heavenly grottoes can manage, our junior brothers and sisters in the blessed lands and dharma realms beneath will face even greater hardships."

Just then.

The golden-robed young man suddenly stood up, his arrogance transforming into unwavering confidence.

"Senior brothers, this junior is willing to enter the Proud Cloud Secret Realm and face Ge Qingshen!"

The cave abode fell into abrupt silence.

Dozens of gazes—some doubtful, some disdainful, some amused—converged on the standing young man.

"Junior Brother Qu."

The first Nascent Soul cultivator to speak wore a wry smile as he gently advised:

"We appreciate your intentions, but perhaps you should wait a while longer."

"Neither you nor Junior Brother Zhang Jing from the Chiming Taihao Heavenly Grotto have been cultivating in the grottoes for long. How could you possibly contend with Ge Qingshen? The opportunity to enter the secret realm at the Foundation Establishment level comes only once—we can't afford to waste it."

Unfazed.

The young man's confidence remained unshaken.

"Senior brother, this junior has full confidence!"

As he spoke.

A wisp of Dual Five-Element Magnetic Annihilation energy slowly emerged from between his brows...

Meanwhile.

In the Dongming Blessed Land.

Within a certain cave abode.

A young Daoist with a profound aura was solemnly observing the figure sitting quietly across from him.

Time passed slowly.

Seeing the other's expression remain perfectly calm.

The young Daoist nodded in satisfaction.

Excellent temperament!

Truly worthy of his high expectations.

"Junior Brother You, prepare yourself. The Proud Cloud Secret Realm is about to open. This senior brother will take you to broaden your horizons and witness the true brilliance of the most monstrous Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators in our Profound Yellow World."

"Proud Cloud Secret Realm?" You Yuanming asked in confusion.

This was the first time he'd heard the name.

"Indeed. Remember when I advised you not to rush into Golden Core but to continue exploring your potential at Foundation Establishment? This secret realm is the reason."

"In a hundred years, you'll participate in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. Securing a spot within the top ten thousand would guarantee the vast resources needed for your future Golden Core and even Nascent Soul cultivation. With exceptional luck, catching the attention of the Daoist leadership could elevate you to the heavens in a single step."

"Senior brother, are you certain you mean the top ten thousand, not the top hundred or even top ten?"

You Yuanming couldn't hide his astonishment.

"Haha, junior brother, you jest. The top hundred or ten are concerns for those monstrous talents from the heavenly grottoes—not blessed land disciples like us."

"Every time the Proud Cloud Secret Realm opens, it gathers elites from all celestial realms. Merely ranking within the top ten thousand is an extraordinary achievement."

The young Daoist laughed heartily.

Opposite him.

"So that's how it is?" You Yuanming suddenly understood.

At that moment.

An image of a certain young figure inexplicably surfaced in his mind.

If he remembered correctly, Junior Brother Zhang Jing was cultivating in one of the Daoist heavenly grottoes.

He wondered how the young man was faring now.

As he lost himself in thought.

The young Daoist across from him seemed to recall something, his expression turning peculiar as he meaningfully advised:

"Junior brother, there's one more thing I've neglected to mention."

"Please enlighten me, senior brother."

You Yuanming replied respectfully.

"How about... you change your name? The characters 'Yuan' and 'Ming' together might be... too weighty for you to bear. Frankly, even I hesitate to say them aloud."

Two days later.

Within an immortal island palace.

"The time has come. With Deer Thirty-Eight guarding the island, everything should be fine. It's time to depart."

Zhang Jing mused to himself.

A glimmer of anticipation flashed through his eyes.

In the next instant.

The Chaos Dao Mark appeared between his brows.

His figure vanished from the palace without a trace...

Shortly after.

In the Flowing Light Immortal Realm.

Within an empty gray-white room of the secret realm mission hall.

As Zhang Jing materialized.

The gray-white hues gradually faded, replaced by the sudden appearance of a counter where a white-headed bird-like nature spirit sat quietly.

"Honored guest, which celestial realm do you wish to travel to?"

The white-headed nature spirit inquired respectfully.

Zhang Jing collected his thoughts and smiled at the being before him.

"One ticket for the Void Treasure Ship to the Dongzhen Huamiao Celestial Realm, please."

Hearing this.

The nature spirit stole a glance at Zhang Jing before quickly responding:

"Honored guest, the next Void Treasure Ship to Dongzhen Huamiao Celestial Realm departs in half a day. The fare is ninety-nine thousand units of karmic fortune. Do you confirm this purchase?"

"Confirmed."

Zhang Jing nodded calmly.

Having visited once before, he was already familiar with the details and showed no surprise.

"Please wait a moment, honored guest."
