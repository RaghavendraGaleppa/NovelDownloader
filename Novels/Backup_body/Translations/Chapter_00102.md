# Chapter 102: Refining All Living Beings as Medicine, Ascending to Immortal Emperor!  

Within the cavernous realm, a grand palace stood ahead, magnificent and resplendent, adorned in gold and jade.  

Before them stretched nine celestial staircases, each with three hundred and sixty-five steps leading to the palace entrance.  

"The thirty-three steps outside the cavern were meant to filter out cultivators with unstable foundations," Yuan Zhengfeng explained. "Even those at the initial stage of the True Qi realm could enter if their foundations were solid. But these three hundred and sixty-five steps test the depth of one's cultivation! The further you go, the greater the pressure. Only those who have unlocked all three hundred and sixty-five acupoints can take the final step!"  

"There's something strange here..."  

Li Zhengjing pushed the little dragon girl, who had poked her head out of the phoenix wood box, back inside. Activating his Golden Pupil Technique, he scanned the surroundings and spotted twenty-four towering dragon pillars, each a hundred zhang tall.  

He paused. "Aren’t these dragon pillars supposed to be in the imperial palace?"  

"Indeed," Yuan Zhengfeng confirmed.  

Li Zhengjing recalled the news he had heard the day before—the dragon pillars from the imperial palace had been stolen.  

And now they were here?  

"From what I understand, these dragon pillars serve a far greater purpose than what meets the eye," Li Zhengjing mused.  

Meanwhile, outside the cavern, the Third Prince stood with his hands behind his back, gazing upward.  

A middle-aged man behind him whispered, "All the cultivators who gathered here lacked solid foundations and were filtered out. Only those with true potential and stable cultivation have entered the cavern."  

The Third Prince replied indifferently, "When I ascend the throne, they will form the foundation of the new dynasty."  

After a pause, he added, "As for those who failed, though their potential is limited, since they sought to serve the imperial court, we shall grant them an opportunity—albeit with lesser privileges than those inside."  

The middle-aged man acknowledged the order, then remarked, "Li Zhengjing’s reputation rivals even that of the Young Master of Kunlun. With his support, Your Highness’s reign will be unshakable."  

The Third Prince sighed. "Alas, my prestige is still insufficient to attract a Human Immortal. But given Li Zhengjing’s potential, he may very well achieve that realm. Once I ascend the throne, I shall bestow upon him the nation’s fortune. Perhaps he will become a figure akin to the State Preceptor."  

The middle-aged man smiled. "A Human Immortal nurtured by Your Highness would surely remain loyal."  

The Third Prince nodded. "I’ve heard he has ties to the Jian’an Marquis’s household. Promote Li Pu’s military rank by one level."  

"You truly know how to win hearts, Third Brother."  

A voice suddenly spoke from behind.  

The Third Prince stiffened, his face paling as he turned slowly.  

The speaker placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled. "Are you happy about becoming the Crown Prince?"  

"You—"  

The Third Prince’s throat went dry, his expression shifting between shock and realization. After a long pause, he finally understood.  

He glanced around—none of his supposed loyal subordinates reacted to the scene before them.  

"These men were sent by your elder brother. Ultimately, they still serve me."  

The Crown Prince, appearing to be in his forties, sat beside him and gazed at the cavern in the sky. "These cultivators from all corners of the land will contribute greatly to the new dynasty. Keep their records carefully. When the time comes, they shall be rewarded—with a proper burial."  

"Burial?"  

The Third Prince’s eyes widened as he stood abruptly—only to be forced back down by the hand on his shoulder.  

After a long silence, he steadied himself and glared at the Crown Prince. "I personally confirmed your death. Your corpse—"  

"If I hadn’t died, how could you have vied for the throne?" The Crown Prince smiled. "If I hadn’t died, how could you have gathered so many cultivators to lay the foundation for my ascension?"  

He patted the Third Prince’s shoulder. "Don’t worry. We are brothers, after all. I won’t kill you. But after these people in the cavern perish, someone must bear the blame."  

"You plan to kill them all?" The Third Prince trembled. "Then pin the crime on me, branding me as a traitor who massacred countless to usurp the throne? And when you reappear, you’ll ascend as the benevolent emperor?"  

"You’re not as foolish as I thought."  

The Crown Prince sighed. "Unfortunately, there are too many clever and capable people in this world. If I hadn’t ‘died,’ the Great Zhou Dynasty’s future would be bleak."  

He raised a hand. "Look, elder brother has reached the peak of the True Qi realm, completing the Great Cycle. Aren’t you happy for me?"  

The Third Prince’s horror deepened. "You were only at the Internal Qi realm before!"  

The Crown Prince nodded. "Which is why I succumbed to Xin Xuan’s poison, lay bedridden for half a year, and was then ‘killed’ by him."  

After a moment of silence, the Third Prince asked, "In those six months, you broke through to the True Qi realm and now stand at its peak? How could your progress be so swift?"  

The Crown Prince pointed at the cavern. "This Li Zhengjing joined an immortal sect less than a year ago, starting from nothing, yet he now rivals the Young Master of Kunlun. As the Crown Prince, I possess the resources of the entire Great Zhou Dynasty—countless techniques, treasures, and the most arduous methods. How could I lag behind him? I was merely too cautious before."  

His face flushed with excitement.  

"The more outstanding he is, the happier I am."  

"Because everything he has will become mine."  

"Third Brother, do you know what this is?"  

The Crown Prince produced a jade seal.  

The Third Prince’s pupils constricted. "The Imperial Seal?"  

The Crown Prince straightened his robes. "After today, our father will abdicate in my favor. And from this day forth, the Great Zhou Dynasty will flourish as it did under our ancestor’s reign!"  

With that, he stepped into the sky, entering the cavern.  

He hovered above the crowd, his gaze cold as he surveyed them, the Imperial Seal in hand shielding him from detection.  

Only Li Zhengjing, his golden pupils gleaming, saw through the illusion and locked eyes with him.  

"So the Crown Prince is the true mastermind behind all this," Li Zhengjing mused. As the second son of Jian’an Marquis, he had once glimpsed the Crown Prince from afar and remembered his face.  

His gaze swept across the twenty-four dragon pillars and the intricate formations connecting them. He began to understand the Crown Prince’s plan.  

More cultivators streamed into the cavern, their faces alight with hope.  

Most were from minor sects or had no sect affiliation at all. Serving the imperial court meant not only a steady supply of cultivation resources but also rewards for meritorious deeds—techniques, spells, treasures, spirit stones, artifacts, talismans, and elixirs.  

For them, this was a path forward, no longer a blind struggle in the dark.  

Those who had entered the cavern were among the finest of the unaffiliated cultivators.  

They began ascending the staircases toward the palace.  

Some, lacking sufficient cultivation or skill, stalled midway, while others pressed forward with all their might.  

Among those at the True Qi realm, none dared move until Li Zhengjing did. But after a long wait, seeing that he remained still, some grew impatient and cautiously stepped forward.  

One by one, they passed him, heading toward the palace.  

On another staircase, Jia Shifang glanced at Li Zhengjing, hesitated, then stopped at the twelfth step.  

"Master, what’s the meaning of this?" the wall-clinging bird whispered.  

"Alchemy," Li Zhengjing replied. "This cavern is a formation, with the twenty-four dragon pillars as its foundation. The formation is a furnace—and every cultivator inside is a medicinal ingredient."  

"The State Preceptor gave you this pupil technique so you could see the truth," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "Look at these people—they come from all over the land."  

"Each represents the common folk of their homeland," Li Zhengjing said. "A grand assembly of all under heaven."  

"Each land nurtures its people," Yuan Zhengfeng continued. "From birth, they are bound to their homeland by the food they eat and the water they drink. Their fates are intertwined with the land’s fortune."  

"With the Imperial Seal, the Crown Prince can gather the fortune of every region, merging it into a new national fortune centered around himself," Li Zhengjing said. "By refining these cultivators into a blood elixir and merging it with the national fortune, he seeks to ascend to the Human Immortal realm in one step!"  

"Since the founding emperor, no ruler of Great Zhou has achieved immortality, yet they still wielded supreme authority, rivaling the leaders of the three great immortal sects," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "But if the emperor becomes an immortal, with the nation’s fortune and the ancestral divine artifacts, he would ascend to the ranks of the world’s most powerful!"  

"So today, even I am merely an ingredient for his elixir."  

Li Zhengjing reached into his robes and retrieved a dragon pillar. "The fake medicine peddler must have foreseen this. And the State Preceptor gave me this pupil technique to see through the illusion—clearly, he doesn’t want an immortal emperor either."  

Before he could finish, the cavern erupted in flames.  

The fire surged from all directions, forming the shape of a cauldron, trapping everyone inside.  

Those well-versed in formations and alchemy immediately recognized the truth.  

"A trap!"  

"They’re refining us into a blood elixir!"  

"The Great Zhou Dynasty never intended to recruit us—they’re sacrificing us!"  

"Why?!"  

The nine staircases began retracting toward the palace, dragging the cultivators with them.  

Those who had advanced the farthest were the first to be consumed by the flames, their flesh burning away as streaks of blood light surged into the palace.  

The twenty-four dragon pillars roared, their draconic cries shaking the cavern.  

In an instant, the cavern became a living hell.  

Amid the flames, blood light scattered in all directions.  

"You have come here to serve the dynasty. Today, I grant you the honor of loyalty!"  

From atop the palace, amidst the flames, a figure stood with hands behind his back.  

Countless streaks of blood light converged at his feet, rising upward as his aura soared.  

His cold gaze swept over the crowd.  

"My path to immortality shall be paved with your sacrifice. For the Great Zhou Dynasty, your contributions shall be eternal, inscribed upon the annals of history!"  

"The Crown Prince! He’s alive!"  

"He’s the one refining us?!"  

"This is the imperial family’s scheme?"  

"Let us go!"  

A True Qi realm expert charged forward, only for the Crown Prince to flick a finger, reducing him to ashes. A streak of blood light flew into the palace.  

Panic erupted among the cultivators on the staircases. Some roared in fury, others resisted desperately, while many collapsed in despair.  

The Crown Prince’s gaze fell upon the one cultivator who had not stepped onto the staircase—Li Zhengjing.  

The most talented, the most accomplished, the most renowned among them.  

"You never set foot on the staircase. I waited, but with only you left, I had no choice but to activate the formation."  

The Crown Prince’s voice was calm. "You saw through everything from the start, didn’t you? The State Preceptor’s pupil technique? He fears my ascension, for it would strip him of his authority. He sent you to thwart me. But do you truly believe—"  

"Li Zhengjing knew about this?!"  

"Why didn’t he warn us?!"  

"He wanted us to die! This bastard!"  

"We’ll haunt him in death!"  

Amid the furious cries, Li Zhengjing chuckled.  

He met the Crown Prince’s gaze. "It’s not just me."  

Then he shrugged. "I wanted to warn them earlier, but I was afraid I’d be silenced before I could speak."  

The Crown Prince’s expression darkened.  

Li Zhengjing glanced around. "The major sects and Buddhist sects here seem quite eager to see you gather power, only to take it for themselves..."  

As his words faded, nearly ten dazzling lights erupted within the cavern!  

"Li Zhengjing, you nearly ruined everything!"  

One of them was Chen Zhu, the current master of Guyue Peak. He shot Li Zhengjing a glare before turning to the Crown Prince. "We all agree that an emperor is best when he remains mortal."  

"Exactly!"  

Jia Shifang’s wooden fish shattered, revealing a golden Arhat within, his aura overwhelming.  

Elder experts from Kunlun, Luofu, and other major sects emerged—Human Immortals had arrived!  

Outside the cavern, a deafening explosion signaled more Human Immortals forcing their way in.  

But Li Zhengjing glanced upward and frowned.  

"The Crown Prince... doesn’t seem surprised at all."
