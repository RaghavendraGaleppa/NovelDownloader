# Chapter 97: The Rest is Handled by the Attribute Panel

The remaining advancement methods that require苛刻 conditions would be left to the attribute panel.

After sorting through his thoughts, Xu Yunfan swallowed the scorching roasted meat in large gulps and immediately began cultivating the Cicada Refining Body Art.

The blood energy in his body suddenly boiled like hot water, surging into his four limbs and flowing ceaselessly between his flesh and skin.

His skin immediately bulged with tumors the size of walnuts, and twelve blood lines spread along the texture of his pectoral muscles.

Every pore in his body opened with a needle-like stinging pain. The blood lines formed by the Cicada Strength that roamed and writhed beneath his skin suddenly knotted into a net, tightly adhering to his fascia.

Inspired by a sudden epiphany, he struck the strange posture engraved on the iron sheet: his right arm bent backward to touch his spine, and his left leg curved as if embracing a pill. Amidst the cracking sounds of his joints, his trapezius muscles expanded at a visible rate, forcefully tearing his worn-out martial uniform apart.

By the time dawn began to break, Xu Yunfan had already extinguished the campfire. His gaze fell upon the information jumping into his field of vision.

‘Cicada Refining Body Art, 0/500 (Entry Level)
Special Effects: Lightning Tempering Body, Golden Cicada Strengthening Bones’

Having trained this secret martial art, his body's resistance to blows had increased by at least thirty percent, and the power he could爆发 in an instant had also increased by thirty percent.

This was already quite astonishing.

Aside from still being short of the perfection of flesh, bone, and skin, he felt that he had already stood at the peak of the Three-Training Martial Master realm. He was even confident that he could defeat a Grand Master who had achieved the External Three Unions.

Several days later, as the morning light whitened the eastern ridge, Xu Yunfan, who had been rushing along for several days and nights, had already been traveling swiftly on the loess road at the border of Cangzhou for three days.

He deliberately avoided the official roads and post stations, heading deep into the mountains and old forests. The broken Weng Jin Hammer in his satchel struck his waist and hips with each step, the fine steel heads gleaming with a cold light under the rising sun.

In Jieyang, the closest city to him in Cangzhou, Xu Yunfan asked a passerby and headed straight for the most famous weapon shop in the city.

"Shopkeeper, do you take commissions for heavy weapons?"

In the blacksmith shop at the north gate of Jieyang in Cangzhou, a bare-chested craftsman stared at the uneven fracture of the hammer handle, his dark fingers scraping against the hammer face, producing a harsh screech.

"Fine steel mixed with Black Iron Sand, good material."

He flicked his finger against the depression on the hammer head, producing a 'thud thud' sound.

"But the hammer's core is shattered from the shock. To reforge it, you'd have to melt it down and add new material. It would be more practical to just forge a new one."

Xu Yunfan fell into thought for a moment before asking, "I wonder if the shopkeeper can forge weapons of the Sharp Edge level?"

The blacksmith shook his head, a little embarrassed. "Weapons of the Sharp Edge level are forged by famous masters. I'm not up to it. I'm just making a living here in Jieyang City."

"Then do you know where I can get one forged?"

The blacksmith said, "The Hundred Refinements Manor in Qingzhou, the Divine Weapon Ridge at the border of Qingzhou and Wuzhou..."

"Surely there are skilled craftsmen in Cangzhou?"

Xu Yunfan was a bit speechless. He had been to both places. The Hundred Refinements Manor had turned him away, afraid he was there to seize their family business. The Divine Weapon Ridge had become the Divine Weapon Valley, its forging lineage severed, and now it was just a second-rate sect that made a living forging a few iron tools.

The blacksmith wiped the hot sweat from his neck and pointed his tongs to the northwest.

"When you get to the Cangzhou provincial capital, Cuibo City, go eighty li towards Guniu Mountain. There's a sect there called the Heavenly Work Cave. Many of its members are skilled craftsmen and mechanism experts. They are masters who specialize in this technique. It's said they've produced many weapons of the Sharp Edge level. Even Xie Huai'an, the number one expert in Cangzhou's martial world, wields that three-foot green blade of his that can sever a hair with a blow."

"The Heavenly Work Cave specializes in forging heavy weapons?"

"Heavy weapons are just the beginning."

The blacksmith washed his hands in a water vat.

"They have three conditions for taking commissions: they won't forge if it's not hundred-refined steel, they won't forge if it's not strange gold or异铁, and they won't forge..."

He suddenly lowered his voice, "They won't forge old weapons that haven't drunk blood. Your heavy hammer, I see it's full of killing intent, and there's still dried blood on it. If you take it there, they'll probably be quite pleased."

Carrying the broken fine steel heavy hammer out of the blacksmith shop, Xu Yunfan looked up at the blue sky and let out a breath for no apparent reason.

He had to find a place to stay in the Cangzhou provincial capital. This place was too small, and many things to assist in martial arts training were insufficient. It was hard enough to get a single drop of exotic beast blood and flesh, but it was snatched away by everyone. How could an outsider like him get any?

Most importantly, this place was too close to Wuzhou. The entire Wuzhou was in chaos: the Demon-Sweeping Heavenly Army of the Incense Fire Sect, the fourteen sects of the Five Ridges and Seven Mountains, the 100,000 Tiger-Rushing Black Armor Army, and the local Wuzhou Army.

In such an environment, could the common people survive?

Pushing aside the distracting thoughts in his heart, Xu Yunfan circled the city of Jieyang. He visited several horse markets, but the horses for sale were mostly ordinary, without a single one possessing the bloodline of an exotic beast.

The horse keeper said, "Sir, if you want a horse with Flood Dragon blood, you could go ask the Chi family. They just arrived from Qingzhou. With the great chaos in Wuzhou, they're taking a detour through Wuzhou to go to Yinzhou. They sell everything, so they might have what you need."

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. He glanced at the horse keeper, reached into his怀里, and tossed him a piece of silver the size of a fingernail.

"Thanks for the information."

The horse keeper, catching the silver, immediately beamed with joy and said cheerfully, "Sir, you should go quickly. I heard they'll be setting off early tomorrow morning."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and immediately hurried towards an inn in the southern corner of the city.

The Chiwen Inn.

Looking at the large characters on the inn's sign, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. After entering the inn, he found the innkeeper and inquired about the Chi family's caravan.

Hearing that he was there to buy goods and seeing Xu Yunfan's strange, mighty, and burly figure, with a broken heavy hammer hanging at his waist and a fine steel box on his back, the innkeeper knew he was a martial artist with strong martial prowess.

Not daring to neglect him, the innkeeper quickly went to the backyard to report.

While waiting, Xu Yunfan, leaning against the counter, tapped his fingers on it. Suddenly, the cloth curtain of the back hall was parted.

A woman in a cyan shirt walked out with light, quick steps, looking at Xu Yunfan with a smile. When she saw his face, her expression froze slightly.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. He remembered this woman.

Back in the withered woods outside of Beiye City, this woman had been sitting in a carriage, quietly watching him fight against "Uncle Jin" and "Feng Zi." She was Chi Suwen.

"Are you the one who wants to buy horses?"

Before Xu Yunfan could speak, a slightly steady voice came from the backyard.

"So much killing intent."

A man in a grey robe flashed out from the shadows of the beams, a copper ball in his palm spinning as fast as a shooting star.

He stared at Xu Yunfan, sizing him up. Most of his attention fell on the two broken sections of the heavy hammer at Xu Yunfan's waist. Fine beads of sweat unconsciously seeped from his temples, and his expression was extremely solemn.

The grey-robed man had originally thought Xu Yunfan was only at the Three-Training Martial Master level, but now he felt a wild and violent blood energy hidden within his body, like a dormant fierce beast, which shocked him.

Xu Yunfan's eyes also flickered. This man was about fifty years old. He walked with the vigor of a dragon and the stride of a tiger. His blood energy was vigorous, his physique solid, and the force in his movements was smooth and natural.

His hands and feet met like a dragon twisting a steel cable, his shoulders and hips aligned like a tiger crouching on a rock, and there was even the sound of wind and thunder where his elbows and knees connected.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes.

This man's spine was like a coiled dragon ascending to the sky. The frequency of his patellar vibrations while walking was completely in sync with his heartbeat. He was clearly at the peak of the External Three Unions: his skin tempered into armor, his bones forged into jade, and his tendons woven into ropes.

Flesh, bone, and skin perfected, a Grand Master of the External Three Unions.
