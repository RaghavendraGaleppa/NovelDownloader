# Chapter 115: Everyone Makes Their Move

Outside the young man's body, a layer of spiritual Heavenly Light energy flowed, making him appear exceptionally ethereal, like a near-immortal being from outside the mundane world.

Zheng Maoze was sent flying, blood staining the corner of his mouth. He landed with a painful cry, looking utterly disheveled. Coupled with his nickname "Big Strong Zheng," he looked anything but an outsider. His spiritual consciousness, which had surged from his body, twisted, burned through by the fist light, unevenly distributed and dim, unlike its usual vibrant state. His body was in excruciating pain; after being struck by that punch, his bones made sounds like popping beans for a brief moment, not just one or two breaking.

Everyone was shocked; the young man's movements were too fast, like a streak of lightning. Qin Ming's Heavenly Light energy retracted into his body from his fist, his fingers as crystal clear as jade. He looked incredibly refined; if his right fist hadn't still been clenched, people would have doubted if such a violent punch could have come from him.

Zheng Maoze gathered his spiritual consciousness and inwardly examined his condition, spitting out another mouthful of blood. A total of eighteen bones were broken, enraging him to the point of vomiting blood. He had just initiated an attack, only to be hammered himself? He was an Outerworld cultivator, yet he was beaten to the point of broken bones and torn sinews by a golden-armored guard he looked down upon. The young man appeared slender, but Zheng Maoze felt as if he had been firmly stomped on by an incomparably massive Dragon-Elephant.

Many Outerworld disciples showed strange expressions, not stepping forward to help Zheng Maoze. They felt that the young man's words were not false and that he was very likely a direct descendant of the Six Emperors' Energy lineage. Otherwise, how could his Heavenly Light energy be so overbearing? The fist light sliced through, shattering Zheng Maoze's spiritual consciousness. Outerworld cultivators considered themselves superior to those on the new path, but a few lineages were exceptions they dared not slight, including the Heaven-Supporting Energy, Tathagata Energy, and Six Emperors' Energy traditions. This was because the Heavenly Light cultivated by these traditions could injure them. Although these traditions would eventually encounter problems with slow progress and strength advancement later on, some old masters, through the accumulation of time, were able to reach quite terrifying heights.

"My apologies, I just came down from the mountain and lack experience in real combat, so I'm a bit nervous," Qin Ming said, his voice gentle, entirely unlike his overbearing punch. These words almost made Zheng Maoze vomit blood again. A newcomer fresh off the mountain had made him a mere backdrop; if this got out, it would be utterly disgraceful.

Clearly, the Outerworld disciples temporarily acknowledged Qin Ming's special identity; a Six Emperors' Energy successor could sit at the same table as them, not just a mere golden-armored guard. The reason Qin Ming immediately merged the Three Great Masterpiece Arts and eighteen types of Heavenly Light energy when he came up was mainly because it was his first time fighting an Outerworld cultivator in the Huangting Realm, and he dared not be careless. Although he was forced to reveal a bit of his true strength, his mood was very smooth after landing that punch, as the two Zheng brothers had been far too arrogant ever since his incident. First, there was Zheng Maorong, who, relying on his status, didn't personally show up but used glances and faint smiles to subtly incite others against Qin Ming. Then, Zheng Maoze targeted Qin Ming at Black and White Mountain, pretending to be close but actually flaunting the immense difference in their current statuses. In the end, he even blocked Qin Ming from leaving with Zeng Yuan, waiting to watch a good show when Li Qingxu and Wang Caiwei arrived. Therefore, after throwing that punch, all of Qin Ming's pores opened up, and he looked radiant. Then, he looked at his former friend, Zeng Yuan.

"Brother, please lend a hand," Qin Ming smiled.

Zeng Yuan was quite wary of him. Even if Zheng Maoze had been careless, the young man's fist light could scorch spiritual consciousness, which was absolutely not fake and extremely dangerous. He calmly asked, "What is it?"

Qin Ming's right hand rested on the ground, flowing with Heavenly Light. With a whoosh, he used the Adhesion Energy to pull up some bright red blood, keeping it from touching his fingers, flowing outside the Heavenly Light. Qin Ming was very polite, saying, "Since everyone needs to provide a drop of Pure Yang Blood Essence, I shouldn't be too special. Please help me refine this blood. It should be enough to condense a drop of Pure Yang Blood, right?"

Zeng Yuan was stunned. He had never expected that the so-called favor would be to ask him to do such a thing. This was truly outrageous. He now believed that this person was most likely a disciple who had just come down from the mountain and was completely ignorant of social graces. How could he agree? Didn't he see Zheng Maoze's eyes practically spitting fire? That expression, as if he wanted to devour someone!

Qin Ming stared at him, saying, "Pure Yang Blood is precious now. Everyone is contributing. Are you going to let it seep into the ground?" Zeng Yuan felt that although Qin Ming remained calm, a dangerous aura was spreading. This newcomer, ignorant of social graces, wouldn't possibly want to give him a punch too, would he? His hair stood on end. At such a close distance, how could he dodge? The Six Emperors' Energy was renowned in the Night Mist World, and he didn't want to get inexplicably hit. So, he ignored "Big Strong Zheng" and naturally took the blood, refining the Pure Yang Blood on the spot.

Qin Ming naturally wouldn't truly attack him; he was merely using the identity of a "naive disciple" from the Six Emperors' Energy lineage to scare him. He had punched Zheng Maoze because the other party wanted to harm him. Even as a direct descendant of the Six Emperors' Energy, attacking without reason would certainly provoke the Outerworld disciples.

"Pfft!"

Zheng Maoze vomited blood again, seeing Zeng Yuan refining his blood. It sizzled, light smoke rose, leaving only a drop of True Blood.

"Brother, are you alright?" Qin Ming asked with concern, reiterating that he was a bit flustered facing a Huangting Realm master and didn't intend to harm him. Zheng Maoze desperately wanted to say: Shut up! Such repeated mentions truly hurt his pride and severely shattered his confidence in aspiring to become near-immortal.

Qin Ming walked over and helped Zheng Maoze up. To some, this was seen as giving the other party a way out and saving some face. Zheng Maoze didn't want to say anything to him, using his spiritual consciousness to support his heavily injured body, stumbling to the side. Qin Ming, without batting an eyelid, also used Adhesion Energy to pull up the blood Zheng Maoze had spat out there and silently brought it before Zeng Yuan.

Suddenly, many people's gazes changed. Was this truly a naive newcomer, or was he intentionally irritating Zheng Maoze? This Six Emperors' Energy successor was quite unusual. Zeng Yuan was in a tight spot. What kind of mess was this, inexplicably falling upon him! The core disciples naturally wouldn't object; the more Pure Yang Blood, the better.

When Zheng Maoze looked back and saw this scene, he was so enraged that he coughed violently and uncontrollably. He quickly covered his mouth, fearing that any more blood would fall to the ground. Hatred filled his heart, and he gritted his teeth, thinking, "That naive fellow is truly inhuman!"

Although the process of collecting Pure Yang Blood Essence had its twists and turns, it ultimately did not encounter major resistance. Many golden-armored guards were already followers of Outerworld disciples. Only a few of the Outer Sages did not provide blood; they had significant backgrounds and were indeed invited to help, so they had no such obligation.

Qin Ming noticed that, besides some Outerworld disciples, several people who practiced special energy arts had their gaze fixed on him. This included Chen Shuhang, who had cultivated the Five-Colored Thunder Light Energy, Jiang Congyun, the Pure Yang Palace successor, and the young man suspected of cultivating Jade Clarity Energy. Although they were all on the same path, Qin Ming was likely to clash with these individuals first, as they had stronger resistance to the Heavenly Light in the deep pit.

As time passed, everything was ready. Various vessels, such as jade jars and crystal bottles, originally used to store pills, were now filled with Pure Yang Blood, vividly red and radiating a vibrant glow, clearly divine objects. Their spiritual value was extremely high; combined with some special medicinal materials, they could totally be used to forge Great Medicine! Undulating Pure Yang spiritual consciousness, hazy like mist, gathered together to resemble a relatively soft small sun.

When selecting Outer Sages to enter the bottom of the giant pit, there were some minor ripples. Who was most suitable to go in had naturally been decided early on. However, this trip could be very dangerous. Who could guarantee that having Pure Yang spiritual substances would necessarily ensure their safety? Qin Ming entered the sight of some core disciples, all wanting to invite him to go down and help retrieve the near-immortal object. He shook his head reservedly but did not refuse completely. This was because he indeed wanted to go in; he would be uneasy if he didn't accompany them, wanting to check the state of the near-immortal object to prevent those who entered first from tampering with it.

"Although our Outerworld does not specifically record various energy arts, the Scripture Pavilion occasionally contains one or two..." Hu Tingwen, Tang Xumi, and several other core disciples secretly negotiated terms with Qin Ming, offering him a special energy art.

"I want a Masterpiece Art," Qin Ming said.

"Perhaps there is one, gathering dust in some corner, but it would be hard to find in a short time."

...

In the end, they promised to help Qin Ming find a relatively powerful cultivation method. Although not a Masterpiece Art, it would certainly be quite famous, such as the incomplete Divine Ape Energy text they had once seen.

Finally, the candidates were decided: Chen Shuhang, who mastered the Five-Colored Thunderfire Energy, Jiang Congyun, the Pure Yang Palace successor, and Qin Ming would go to the central area to retrieve the near-immortal object. In addition, the Five Elements Palace successor, the Jade Clarity Energy successor, and others would provide support from behind, ensuring foolproof execution.

Although Qin Ming felt a bit uneasy, he still smeared Pure Yang Blood Essence on his armor, making his entire body red and flowing with resplendent light. Chen Shuhang chose to protect himself with Pure Yang spiritual consciousness, while Jiang Congyun used a mixture, with his smeared blood carrying spiritual consciousness. In a sense, the three of them were test subjects, to see which method had the best effect so the others could adjust based on feedback.

At the bottom of the bowl-shaped giant pit, the violent Heavenly Light was incredibly dense, like divine flames burning. They could see light smoke continuously rising from the trio's armor. Both the Pure Yang Blood Essence and Pure Yang spiritual consciousness were constantly being consumed, but they were indeed effective; so far, they could sustain them as they walked in.

"Do you two have any other thoughts? Can't we comprehend that near-immortal object, or temporarily borrow it?" Jiang Congyun spoke. His sect was very famous, and he was specially invited to help. Although Pure Yang Energy was not as strong as Six Emperors' Energy, it was still renowned in the Night Mist World.

"Yes, we can research it first," Chen Shuhang echoed.

Qin Ming naturally nodded as well. There was no need to go against them; he had long known that those willing to risk entering first all had their own objectives. "Perhaps there are some good things scattered near the near-immortal artifact," Jiang Congyun chuckled. Qin Ming's heart stirred; the Pure Yang Palace behind him was quite ancient and still a colossal power, perhaps it knew some secrets about this place.

They sprinted, daring not to waste time. They were not far from the center of the giant pit, vaguely seeing auspicious light steaming and immortal mist swirling. Qin Ming became cautious; although he was confident, he still wanted to avoid accidents.

Rumble!

Above the heavenly sinkhole, a great battle suddenly erupted among the core disciples. Tang Xumi, Su Jingzhu, Jiang Shengyu, and Luo Qingge had originally broken ties, but no one expected the four to reunite and launch an attack on Hu Tingwen and Sun Jingxian. The outcome was unexpected; Hu Tingwen and Sun Jingxian were already prepared and swiftly retreated, fleeing in one direction without suffering heavy injuries. The four pursued relentlessly, seemingly eager to eliminate them. The other Outerworld disciples chose to observe, helping neither side.

The turn of events once again left the elite disciples aghast. As the six masters engaged in a chaotic battle, approaching the crowd, they simultaneously launched a killing blow at one elite disciple. To everyone's shock, that obscure disciple possessed unfathomable strength, erupting with dazzling five-colored light, instantly heavily injuring Luo Qingge and sending her flying. Cui Chonghe's eyes were deep and his expression cold; he had been unexpectedly ambushed. He knew that this time, he had likely missed out on the near-immortal object forever. Li Qingyue's eyes were clear; as a golden-armored guard, she remained detached and chose to observe the battle.

At the bottom of the deep pit, Qin Ming had already seen the near-immortal object. They had arrived at their destination. Chen Shuhang's Five-Colored Thunderfire Energy erupted, the thunderous roar deafening and terrifying. Jiang Congyun's Pure Yang Energy was even more overbearing and decisive, instantly dispersing the dense Heavenly Light nearby. Qin Ming also had to make his move, once again demonstrating the demeanor of a young Grandmaster.
