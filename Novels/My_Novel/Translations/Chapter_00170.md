Chapter 170: Marquis Xuan's Hereditary Title, The Indoor Burglar

Lin Aoshan looked at Li Xian and thought to herself that this Wuwei Lang was truly impressive—meticulous, cautious, agile, and thorough in his actions. She admitted she wouldn't have thought of that previous step herself.

"If he hadn't reminded me, I might have exposed my identity. Then... if the Flower Cage Sect had used my mistake against me and captured me, wouldn't I have lost without even knowing why?"

A cold sweat broke out over her, as if ice water had been poured on her.

It was still noon, too early to act. Li Xian found a tavern, ordered two servings of tea and pastries, a plate of melon seeds, and a plate of flaky cakes. He sat quietly, passing the time.

Lin Aoshan picked up a piece of flaky cake with two fingers and put it in her mouth. It was crisp, fragrant, and sweet, but it didn't suit her palate. She took only one bite before stopping and turning to crack melon seeds instead.

Bored and idle, she curiously studied Li Xian, her gaze moving from top to bottom, then back up again.

After staring for a long time, her pretty face flushed with embarrassment. She decided to just lie down on the table and close her eyes to sleep. Li Xian let his mind wander, drinking tea, eating pastries, cracking seeds, and listening to the music. The storyteller in the teahouse was narrating tales of the Jianghu with dramatic cadence.

They sat in this leisurely manner until nightfall.

The full moon hung high in the sky.

Seeing the time was ripe, Li Xian covered his face with a cloth. He woke Lin Aoshan, and the two leaped over walls, avoiding watchful eyes, transforming into thieves infiltrating the Wang estate.

The Wang family was wealthy, their estate vast, and the night patrols were strict. Li Xian slipped into the rear courtyard and caught the scent of cosmetics, guessing it must be the women's quarters. He followed the fragrance.

He passed several rooms. Candles burned inside, casting the silhouettes of women combing their hair. Li Xian was about to leave when a sudden idea struck him. He turned and broke into the room.

Inside, a woman dressed in light, cool clothes, her long hair loose, was about to scream. Li Xian stepped forward, grabbed her by the neck, and stifled her voice. Lin Aoshan was stunned, thinking, "Are you really here to steal?" But she said nothing, simply closing the door behind them.

Li Xian asked, "Who are you in the Wang household?"

The woman cried, "I... I am the Master's concubine." She was twenty years old, with delicate features and fine looks, and her beauty was undeniable even as she sat before the mirror.

Li Xian said, "Oh? Quite the beauty. How about you come with me from now on?"

Lin Aoshan was utterly confused and somewhat annoyed, but she held her tongue. The woman was terrified. "Big... Big Brother... please... don't..."

"You dare refuse me!?" Li Xian's voice turned harsh. "Do you know who we are?"

"N-no, I don't," the woman shook her head. "You two heroes... you're wearing masks, I... I really don't know."

"Good!" Li Xian sneered. "We are the 'Marauding Bandit Duo,' specializing in capturing beautiful young girls like you."

"Marauding Bandit Duo?" Lin Aoshan's face went dark.

"Your luck is good today, running into us," Li Xian said. "From now on, you belong to me."

The woman felt as if she had fallen into an ice pit, utterly hopeless for her future. Tears streamed down her face. Then Li Xian said, "Unless... unless..."

"Unless what?" the woman asked.

"Unless you tell me which women in this estate are even more beautiful. Once I capture them, I'll naturally let you go," Li Xian said sternly.

"I'll tell, I'll tell, Great Hero, I'll tell!" The woman felt reborn and spilled everything about the many women of the Wang family—married women, unmarried daughters, those just coming of age... every beautiful woman, revealing their appearances, character, talents, and where they lived...

Lin Aoshan suddenly understood, but couldn't help muttering to herself that "Marauding Bandit Duo" was just too ugly a name. Wouldn't "Heroic Couple" be better? The Jianghu was vast, and there were no shortage of bandits, but she had never heard of a "Marauding Bandit Duo" before.

"Good, you're sensible!" Li Xian memorized everything.

"Great... Great Hero, now... can you let me go?" The concubine could barely stand.

Li Xian saw many fine jewelry pieces on the dressing table. He casually scooped them up and put them in his pocket, playing the part to the end. Fearing the concubine might cause a commotion, he looked around and saw a wooden box under the bed. He opened it to find a collection of toys for marital amusement.

Among them was a bundle of red fragrant ropes. Li Xian said to Lin Aoshan, "You do it?" implying that since Lin Aoshan was a woman, tying up the concubine wouldn't be considered improper.

Lin Aoshan cursed in her heart, "This scoundrel, is he really trying to become a marauding bandit? Does he... does he want to tie me up too?" In her embarrassment, her mind went blank, and she imagined the wrong thing. She took several steps back, shaking her head repeatedly.

Li Xian had to do it himself. He tied the concubine up thoroughly, binding her wrists and ankles, tossed her onto the bed, covered her with a quilt, gagged her mouth, and blindfolded her. He said, "A servant will find you tomorrow. Go to sleep乖乖. If you dare reveal my whereabouts, I'll come back for you."

Then he left the room.

Lin Aoshan's face was flushed red. The image of the concubine kept popping into her mind. They had walked a mile before she came back to her senses and scolded, "You scoundrel!"

Li Xian said, "Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures." Lin Aoshan spat and lightly fanned her face with her hand.

The two now knew the location of the Wang family's women and split up to investigate. At midnight, they met again in a dilapidated pavilion within the estate.

Li Xian asked, "Did you find any missing women?"

Lin Aoshan shook her head. "No." She glared fiercely at Li Xian; that scene lingered in her mind, refusing to fade. During her investigation, she had also stumbled upon couples in their rooms, the sounds of spring filling the air, making her feel hot and flustered.

"I found one," Li Xian said. "The Third Mistress of the Wang family is missing. It seems... the Flower Cage Sect has indeed arrived."

The pavilion had been abandoned for a long time. Moss grew on the stone benches. Lin Aoshan brushed it away with a flick of her hand and sat down, asking, "Anything else?"

Li Xian said, "After I found out, I went to ask the Wang family head. I learned his Third Mistress went missing ten days ago."

"The Wang family kept it quiet because he considered it a scandal. Moreover, the enemy could silently abduct a woman from his estate. Their strength isn't weak, and they could probably kill him silently too. So he didn't dare make it public and swallowed the bitter loss."

"Ten days ago?" Lin Aoshan calculated the time. Back when she encountered the Flower Cage Sect on the Feiyun Plank Road, she deliberately stayed a few extra days to avoid running into them again on the road.

Although she headed straight for Qingning afterward, she encountered many things along the way that delayed her journey. Plus, she never skipped comforts—staying at inns, bathing, resting—taking her time. If the Flower Cage Sect traveled day and night, resting little and sleeping less, they could easily have拉开 a ten-day lead.

Even more than that.

"What's the next step?" Lin Aoshan asked.

"A ten-day gap makes tracking difficult, and it's easy to alert the enemy," Li Xian mused. "Qingning County also has the Zhao, Luo, and Lin families. Let's investigate them one by one to gather more clues."

Lin Aoshan stood up. "Good! Let's move together."

The two investigated through the night, sneaking into the Luo family and using the same trick. Although they found some clues, the gains were small. By then, dawn was breaking, so Li Xian had to stop and return to the Wuwei Hall to rest, waiting for night to fall before acting again.

Luo Xia asked, "Li Xian, you haven't returned to the manor all day. Aren't you afraid the Mistress will blame you?" Li Xian shook his head and told Luo Xia that the Mistress was in seclusion, so he could focus on the matter at hand.

The next night. Li Xian and Lin Aoshan infiltrated the Lin family. After searching for the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, they found a mourning hall deep within the estate, as if someone had just passed away.

After some investigation, they learned that the Lin family's young lady, Lin Qingwan, had suddenly fallen ill the previous night and died. The funeral was held simply, only within the estate.

Li Xian pondered: "That Lin Qingwan from last time almost became my concubine. I observed her; her face was rosy, her lips red, she was young, and didn't seem sickly. Did she really die of illness? Or... was she abducted by the Flower Cage Sect, and the Lin family, to cover up the scandal and because Lin Qingwan was already engaged, resorted to this trick?"

He felt he was getting close to the truth. He also learned that Lin Qingwan had died the previous night and the funeral was held today. It had happened within the last two days. If this were true, the Flower Cage Sect's trail was right before his eyes.

He immediately waited quietly for half a stick of incense. After the servants finished their wailing and left one person to guard the hall, Li Xian slipped in and knocked the servant unconscious.

He silently recited: "If you truly died of illness, I hope you won't blame me for disturbing you."

Li Xian tried to lift the coffin, but found the lid nailed shut. The Lin family was in such a hurry, they must be trying to cover up a scandal. He became even more certain there was something fishy. He used the "Cloud-Soaring Hand" to pull out the iron nails.

"Great skill!" Lin Aoshan praised. Although the martial art quality was low, this display showed a very high level of proficiency. Not to be outdone, she also used her martial art to remove the coffin nails.

She reached out and stroked; the coffin nails were sucked onto her palm. This was the Lin family's "Star-Swallowing Art." When fighting an opponent, it could pull and absorb their internal energy, causing it to be consumed for no reason, disrupting their energy flow, and leading to a great defeat.

When used with full power, its might was tremendous. Now, Lin Aoshan used it flexibly and skillfully, showing "Great Completion" proficiency, but it was like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut—she was clearly showing off.

With all the nails removed, the coffin was indeed empty inside. There was no sign of Lin Qingwan.

"Just as I thought!" Li Xian was delighted. Lin Aoshan looked at Li Xian, subconsciously asking for the next step.

Li Xian put the coffin lid back on and nailed it shut. After a moment of thought, he said, "Be careful. The people from the Flower Cage Sect must still be in the Lin family. Watch the Lin family's reaction. We just need to pay attention to the servants coming and going to find the Flower Cage Sect's trail."

"Sister Lin, you go to the east side gate, observe secretly. If you find suspicious people, find a way to notify me."

"I'll take a look around to see if there are any other clues."

Lin Aoshan agreed. She hid beside the east side gate, holding her breath and observing quietly. Li Xian went deeper into the residence, arriving at Lin Qingwan's bedroom.

The boudoir was as before.

The decoration was fine, but sadly, the person was like a pawn. Li Xian searched around when he suddenly heard movement outside the door:

"That Lin family head is really heartless. His daughter went missing, and he didn't even look for her, just declared her dead from illness."

"It's all thanks to Brother Gu's brilliant plan. Look at the four great families of this county. After swallowing their bitter losses, who dares to speak a word about it?"

"Alright, we've already left the threatening letter.想必 the Lin family is too scared to investigate. Even if they do... hehe, we'll have already moved on."

"I thought Qingning County was quite chaotic. Unexpectedly, it's quite orderly. Brother Gu has found another good place. It's just that it's a bit rushed. We haven't had a good rest, and now we have to travel a long distance."

The two passed by nearby, their voices fading away. Li Xian quietly followed. He saw two servants, one tall and one short, leaving. Having succeeded repeatedly, they had lowered their guard and were extremely careless.

Li Xian saw his opportunity. He used the "Gentle Breeze Leg," his footsteps silent as a breeze, and followed them from a distance.

Keeping about thirty meters behind, he saw the two leave through a side gate and head towards the outskirts of the city.

Lin Aoshan, hiding by the gate, tensed up and was about to move. Li Xian pressed down on her shoulder and whispered, "Keep some distance." Lin Aoshan nodded. The night was deep, and being ten or so meters apart was enough to hide their figures well.

Li Xian used his keen eyesight to lock onto the tall and short men. He saw them crawl through a dog hole in the city wall and head straight into the mountains.

Eager to make a contribution, Lin Aoshan also wanted to crawl through. Li Xian grabbed her, pointing at the city gate. "At this time, we can just use the main gate."

Lin Aoshan gave an awkward smile, then glared and嗔ted, "As if you're so clever."

"Speaking of which, Marquis Xuan of the Celestial Patrol..." Li Xian teased, "Isn't your title of Marquis Xuan hereditary?"

Lin Aoshan's face turned beet red. He had hit the nail right on the head.
