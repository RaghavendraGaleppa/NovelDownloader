# Chapter 72: Mechanical Battle Buddha

As for why Zhou Tian didn't announce the news on a public board but chose this method instead, they could understand. Generally, only those with truly significant news would act this way, auctioning off the information in a manner similar to an auction to maximize their profits.

"This divine beast is the head of all ancient divine beasts! It's called –"

Zhou Tian deliberately created an air of mystery, and the black-robed figures listened attentively.

"River Crab!"

As Zhou Tian uttered these words, he turned his back to them.

A deathly silence fell. "River Crab?" Even if they were fools, they knew they had been played. They exchanged strange glances, staring at Zhou Tian.

*Boom!*

A幽蓝色 (deep blue) flame appeared out of thin air, scorching the void, transforming into a roaring blue dragon that instantly engulfed Zhou Tian. A sharp pain tore through his nerves, but it was only for an instant, for he had already been burned to ashes, scattering onto the floor.

The figure who had unleashed the flame was also stunned. He hadn't expected to succeed so easily. He had thought that anyone audacious enough to cause trouble here would possess some skill, yet this person had died instantly under his mere test. The so-called rule of "no combat in Tian Guan" was torn to shreds in this dark corner!

Then, the figure spoke, "My apologies, everyone. It was my oversight that allowed this ignorant person to intrude and spoil your enjoyment. Today, all commissions will be reduced by 10%."

From his tone, this person seemed to be the master of this place.

"Mister Ghost Shadow is too kind."

"..."

The black-robed figures responded one after another.

Suddenly, something bizarre occurred. A completely naked person, with a bare butt exposed to them, appeared exactly where Zhou Tian had turned to ash. No one had seen how this person had materialized.

Everyone was dumbfounded. What in the world was this?

"Thank you, everyone. Bye-bye."

After saying this, they watched the stark-naked figure vanish from the spot. This was destined to be a night they would never forget.

Outside, Zhou Tian reappeared on the street.

Shaking his head, Zhou Tian still felt a slight tingling in his trigeminal nerve. He knew it was just an illusion, as all his conditions were reset to their state before death upon revival; there could be no lingering flame residue. It was merely the after-effect of the intense pain he'd just experienced.

"That really hurt just now. Good thing I died fast!"

Rubbing his brows, Zhou Tian checked his location and instantly teleported towards Tian Qin's garrison.

Just as he was about to say "River Crab," Zhou Tian suddenly wondered if his clothes would revive with him. The previous three times he had died, he was wearing clothes, so he couldn't verify. This time, he didn't know how others would deal with him, but it was highly likely that his clothes would be destroyed along with him.

That's why he had turned his back. If he couldn't revive with his clothes, then the cloth covering his face would be gone, and his face would be exposed. He wanted to avoid as many troubles as possible.

Entering the garrison, Zhou Tian teleported inside where the guards at the entrance couldn't see him.

Back in his room, he glanced at a tiny, almost invisible thread hanging on his door. Zhou Tian nodded, confirming that no one had entered his room during the time he was gone.

Lying on the bed, Zhou Tian counted on his fingers. There were four days left until departure. If he died once a day, excluding the day of departure, he could die three more times. That was just enough for an upgrade. *Comfortable~* Filled with anticipation for a wonderful tomorrow, Zhou Tian fell into a deep sleep, exhausted from half a night of shenanigans.

Thankfully, he had spare clothes in the room, so he wouldn't have to go out bare-assed tomorrow morning.

...

The next day, Zhou Yan took them on a tour of Tian Guan. He had been here several times and was quite familiar with the place.

During the day, Tian Guan returned to its bustling prosperity, with no hint of the evil that lurked within its seemingly simple buildings at night.

"This place used to be where war artifacts were stored. These buildings were all constructed later..."

Zhou Yan led the way, explaining the common knowledge about this giant city.

"This Tian Guan is unexpectedly prosperous, isn't it?"

Liu Yan looked at her surroundings, her bright eyes filled with surprise. Many things were new to her. She hadn't come out yesterday, so she didn't know much about Tian Guan. Seeing it today greatly astonished her.

The others wore similar expressions, looking left and right, captivated by the distinct style that differed greatly from the Imperial Capital.

Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Yan, who was leading the way, wondering if he knew about Tian Guan's dark side at night. He subtly spoke up, "No matter how prosperous a place is, there will always be a dark side to it."

"What... didn't you and a certain Son of Prince Xiaoyao explore enough of the dark side yesterday?"

Liu Yan gave him a sidelong glance, her barb aimed squarely at Zhou Zui standing nearby. She had thought Zhou Tian was referring to places like brothels.

Zhou Yan, leading the way, seemed unaffected and continued to introduce Tian Guan as before.

Zhou Zui, suddenly caught in the crossfire, scratched his head and said nothing.

"Haha, Imperial Prince Yan, long time no see!"

A hearty laugh rang out, and a burly man approached from the front. He had a neat buzz cut, surprisingly blue eyes, and wore a metal combat suit, giving him a futuristic, sci-fi look. He was probably from the Machine Nation, though not necessarily.

Zhou Tian had seen many people wearing mechs in Tian Guan these past two days, as the Machine Nation's combat mechs were very popular.

"Warman? Are you leading the Machine Nation's contingent this time?"

Zhou Yan also looked a little surprised. He shook Warman's hand and asked, clearly recognizing him as an old acquaintance.

"No, I arrived much earlier. The Mechanical Association sent me to collect some divine cores."

Warman explained.

"Collecting divine cores?"

Zhou Yan was astonished. Collecting divine cores? Had the Machine Nation developed a new use for them?

"That's right. The Mechanical Battle Buddha is in its final stages, but we keep running into some issues. The Association sent me to collect some divine cores; they're quite effective at enhancing intelligent brains."

Warman said this carelessly, speaking openly on the main street of Tian Guan, drawing glances from many passersby. All were sharp-eared and sharp-eyed cultivators, and his voice wasn't quiet, so they heard everything clearly.

The passersby then unconsciously made way for their group, having realized that this buzz-cut man was a high-ranking figure from the Machine Nation, and the person speaking with him must be of the same caliber. They were not to be provoked.

Zhou Tian and the others were speechless. Warman truly answered whatever he was asked.

Warman, however, looked indifferent. The concept of the Mechanical Battle Buddha had been proposed by them a long time ago, so it wasn't a big secret. What harm could there be in saying it? Their paths were fundamentally different; others couldn't imitate it even if they wanted to.

"What about your people this time? Didn't you bring them out to look around?"

Zhou Yan changed the subject, not delving any deeper.
