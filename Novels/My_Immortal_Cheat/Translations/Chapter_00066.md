# Chapter 66: A Virgin?!

After thoroughly examining the information on the Ninth Continent, Zhou Tian discovered that it was incredibly chaotic.

The Ninth Continent was a remnant left behind after the ancient Divine Realm was crippled. Its native inhabitants called it the God-Forsaken Land.

The cultivation path of the ancient Divine Realm was very unique, utilizing the spiritual power of mortals. Numerous Divine Kings sat atop the clouds, enjoying the worship of all living beings.

When Zhou Tian saw this special cultivation path, two words instantly popped into his mind: "Faith."

This cultivation path indeed bore many similarities to the 'faith-based deification' streams described in many articles from his previous life, yet there were significant differences. The Divine Realm's path truly converted the faith of all beings entirely into their own power. There was no concept of 'toxic faith'; even if they lost their believers, they would only lose the energy to grow stronger, not their existing strength.

This path was fundamentally different from those of the other eight continents and could not possibly be integrated. After all, everyone had diligently absorbed spiritual energy for countless years; to suddenly tell them to stop and instead bow down and worship others as their gods—wouldn't that cause an uproar? Furthermore, the path of faith wasn't necessarily stronger than their own.

The Divine Realm had also been the main battlefield when the eight continents launched their attacks, directly shattered into pieces, and even "Heaven's Will" could no longer form there. Thus, everyone was too lazy to spend the cost of clearing and developing the area, leading to its current state of extreme chaos.

The other eight continents largely ignored the Ninth Continent, turning it into a haven for numerous fugitives. Although the God-Forsaken Land was nearly torn apart at the time, its external space was extremely fragile, ravaged by spatial storms, and the other continents had no desire to clear it up, as stabilizing space required considerable cost. Although teleportation arrays couldn't be built, countless people still poured into it every year, most of whom perished in the spatial currents.

It was mainly divided into three factions: the remnant inhabitants of the Divine Realm, rogue cultivators (primarily composed of fugitives), and the garrison forces from the other eight continents.

By the time Zhou Tian finished thoroughly examining the detailed information on the Ninth Continent, it was already near dusk. Zhou Yi also returned from the Imperial Palace, and from him, Zhou Tian learned that the departure was set for half a month later. After accounting for preparation time and other miscellaneous matters, the actual departure date was scheduled for one week from now.

Zhou Tian opened his Undying System and glanced at it. A long time had passed since the last log refresh. There had been no news from those who had attacked him using soul-based techniques, making Zhou Tian constantly lament their lack of tenacity whenever he had a free moment!

However, he no longer needed to pin his hopes on those people. The time for frantically accumulating death counts was approaching.

...

The next day, Zhou Tian woke up in the late morning, climbed out of bed, had lunch, prepared his carriage, and headed towards the Carefree Prince's Estate. There was nothing for him to do at home anyway; he might as well go hang out with Zhou Zui.

Upon arriving at the Carefree Prince's Estate, Zhou Tian had initially assumed Zhou Zui would be at the Sky Dance Pavilion. If he hadn't considered the slight possibility that Zhou Zui might be home after his competition yesterday, Zhou Tian would have gone straight to the pavilion.

"I want to go out too, but I just finished soaking in the Spirit Essence Pool yesterday, and my father absolutely forbids me from leaving. It's unbearable..."

In the living room of the Carefree Prince's Estate, Zhou Zui sat slumped in a chair, looking utterly devoid of meaning in life.

"You're such a scumbag! Liu Yan just forfeited her competition for you yesterday, and today you're already thinking of going to the Sky Dance Pavilion!" Zhou Tian stood on a moral high ground, righteously condemning him.

"It's... it's very complicated!" Zhou Zui wore a look that spoke volumes of unspeakable difficulty.

"Complicated my ass! You're always speaking in riddles!" Zhou Tian was speechless at his expression and excuses. Clearly, Zhou Zui just didn't want to talk about it; what was with all the mystery...

"I'm telling you, you're forcing my hand!" A chilling smile crept onto Zhou Tian's face.

"What are you going to do?" Zhou Zui looked uneasy. Although this was the Carefree Prince's Estate, his own home, he felt not a shred of security...

"Tell me the truth!" Zhou Tian used [Holy Word], empowered by his death counts, on Zhou Zui.

"............"

Zhou Zui looked utterly disbelieving. *No way, big brother, does your divine ability really have such an effect?*

Zhou Tian wasn't sure if such a command would actually work. This idea had been brewing in his mind for a long time, but he hadn't had the chance. It had been on cooldown since his last use, but it had just reset these past two days, perfect for him to test it out. If such commands were effective, then there would be many more avenues for him to explore in the future.

"What's your name?" Zhou Tian tried asking.

Zhou Zui's face showed reluctance, and his head shook wildly, but his mouth involuntarily spoke: "Zhou Zui."

"How old are you?"

"Seventeen, eighteen by traditional Chinese reckoning."

*Looks like it works pretty well,* Zhou Tian mused, stroking his chin.

"Do you like Liu Yan?"

"Big brother, please... I like her..." Zhou Zui's plea for mercy was cut off by his own words.

"Hehehe..." Zhou Tian chuckled triumphantly, the words coming from his mouth betraying his body's reluctance.

"Then why don't you make a move?"

"Because I'm cultivating the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Sacred Art!"

"How do you cultivate that thing?" Zhou Tian had heard of it in the great hall that day; it seemed quite powerful, but what did it have to do with pursuing Liu Yan?

"Cultivate it at the Sky Dance Pavilion!"

Zhou Tian suddenly noticed Zhou Zui's expression turn very grim. Before, it was disbelief at Zhou Tian's divine ability, but now it was genuine panic, as if this question had hit a nerve. Zhou Tian's spirits lifted; it seemed he was on the verge of uncovering a secret.

"What do you do at the Sky Dance Pavilion?"

"Cultivate the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Sacred Art!"

"How specifically do you cultivate it?"

"Through... emotions... and desires..." Zhou Zui spouted a long string of technical jargon, not a single word of which Zhou Tian understood.

"Stop, stop..." Zhou Tian felt his head swelling from listening and quickly called for a halt.

Zhou Zui's expression relaxed. Although he had to tell the truth, he could exploit loopholes. For instance, with the previous question, he could answer concisely or explain using complex terminology, and both would still be the truth.

Zhou Tian gently pinched his chin. He couldn't ask it like that. After a long silence, Zhou Tian asked a question he considered relatively polite: "Do you need to... mate... with those young ladies?"

Zhou Zui's face flushed crimson. *Mate? Is that even how you describe people?!* But he still answered honestly: "No, I don't..."

"You don't!?" Zhou Tian's face registered shock, and an unbelievable thought surged in his mind as he asked: "Are you... still a virgin?"

Zhou Zui's face suddenly turned ashen. He slumped onto the chair like a deflated balloon, weakly muttering: "Yes~~~~"

Zhou Tian's eyes widened. The famous libertine of the Imperial Capital, the man who could stay in the Sky Dance Pavilion for a month, the legendary achiever of the 'Hundred-Man Slayer' feat... was actually a virgin?!
