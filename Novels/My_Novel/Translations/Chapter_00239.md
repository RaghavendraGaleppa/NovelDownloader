Chapter 239: Master and Servant Roles Reversed, "Bully the Weak with Might"

The author: Duoqing Shiliu (Passionate Pomegranate)

Li Xian looked on with a knowing smile. The wheel of fortune turns; in this lifetime, he finally got to see Wen Caishang in a state of embarrassment, her clothes barely covering her body.

It was the third month of spring, a time when flowers were in full bloom.

Wildflowers blanketed the area around the Fragrant Barrier Tree, clusters of white to the east and patches of red to the west. Though they were nameless wildflowers, blooming in such dense clusters, they made for a fine sight.

The white flower that was Wen Caishang thought for a long time. With utter helplessness, she said, "Li Xian, take off your clothes and give them to me to wear. You... you can go steal some more clothes, alright?"

Li Xian replied bluntly, "No."

Wen Caishang was half-annoyed and half-angry, thinking to herself, "This brat is getting harder to order around. As a fine, strapping young man, are you afraid of being seen?"

Naturally, she said, "Good Li Xian, good Li Lang, good A-Xian... How did I treat you in the past? I taught you martial arts, spent money to nurture you, and was so gentle with you. You shouldn't hold it against me now. Just give me your clothes, and I... I will thank you properly." Her words were laced with unconcealable shame.

As the words left her mouth, she was startled herself. "How could I say such things? Begging like this, it's so damaging to my pride."

Li Xian found this immensely enjoyable and laughed. "No, still no. That would make me look too pathetic."

Wen Caishang fumed, "How is it pathetic for you to be good to me? You little ingrate. Fine, fine, then just let me be seen by everyone."

Li Xian watched with a smile. A fresh breeze blew, and Wen Caishang felt a chill through her body. Her face burned with embarrassment, and she quickly softened her voice. "Good Li Lang, please, I'm begging you."

Li Xian said, "It's rare for you to ask me for a favor. I would risk my life to help you. But this matter is truly dangerous. If I'm not careful, I could lose my life. Before I do this, I want to make a deal with you."

"All that sweet talk is so unreliable. When you were surrounded and attacked earlier, you didn't seem so troubled. Now, asking you to take off a piece of clothing, and you talk about risking your life," Wen Caishang scolded. "What deal? Out with it."

Li Xian said with a smile, "It has always been others who serve you, Madam. If I help you solve this big problem, I'd like to be served by you in return. It won't be long, just a month."

"Ah!" Wen Caishang cried out in shock. "You have such a nerve! How dare you ask me to serve you?!"

Li Xian's flirtatious nature was fully on display. Leaning back against the tree trunk, he said with a carefree air, "If you don't agree, Madam, then I can't help. After all, I, Li Xian, have a cheap life. I am but a mayfly of this world, born in the morning and dead by night. I dare not ask for much, I dare not ask for much."

Wen Caishang held an extremely high and noble status and absolutely refused to serve another person. But hearing Li Xian's self-deprecating tone, even though she knew he was deliberately provoking her, she genuinely felt a pang of pity. The great debt of saving her life, repaid by serving him, was perfectly normal. It was just that Wen Caishang couldn't bring herself to make the switch for the moment.

Wen Caishang spat, "You little ingrate. I... I yield. Give me the clothes quickly. I... I agree."

Li Xian laughed. "Good. Have a look, Madam." He pulled a white dress from his backpack.

Wen Caishang fumed, "Aha! You tricked me! That doesn't count, it doesn't count!"

Li Xian said, "I didn't trick you, Madam. Your clothes are all made of silk, smooth and soft to the touch. But this piece of clothing, its workmanship isn't fine, and the material is just average. I bought it myself."

Wen Caishang asked in surprise, "Why on earth would you buy women's clothing?"

Li Xian said, "It's a coincidence. When I first left the manor, I saw that you only had two changes of clothes. I thought to myself, 'When you're out, you can't avoid damp or hot weather. The journey is long; you might get rained on or sweat through. How can two sets of clothes be enough for a change? I'll prepare an extra one. If it comes in handy, maybe I'll get a word of praise from you.' So I prepared one too."

Li Xian said with a wicked grin, "I said earlier that your clothes were gone. That was the truth, but I have another suitable set. So our agreement must stand."

Wen Caishang said helplessly, "You... If only you were half as obedient back then, I'd be thanking the heavens." In truth, dealing with Wen Caishang required a balance of good and bad. To blindly obey and lose oneself would inevitably lead to becoming a subordinate.

What made Li Xian stand out was precisely what made Wen Caishang take a second look. It was just that neither of them had realized it yet. Wen Caishang put on the clothes, and her noble aura was still unmistakable. Her black, damp hair added to her charm.

Wen Caishang gave Li Xian a glare. "Wait until I can move again. I'll 'serve' you then. I wonder if you'll be able to take it." She thought to herself, strangely, "This brat is already extremely disrespectful to me. Why am I not very angry?"

She had always considered herself experienced and thought she understood the joys and sorrows of love in the mortal world. But in the end, it was just a frog in a well, being opinionated and speculating in a vacuum. Human emotions have their intensity and subtlety, their depth and shallowness; how can they be generalized? When it truly falls upon her, she herself is confused and can't figure it out.

Li Xian started a fire and asked with a smile, "Madam, was the sea of flowers beautiful earlier?"

Wen Caishang smiled. "At this moment, I'm afraid those old fogies are jumping with frustration. After today, it won't be easy for them to find us."

She then gave him a glare, her charm showing naturally, and coquettishly said, "As for you asking me if the sea of flowers was beautiful... Hmph, you've got some nerve. That vast sea of flowers, who knows how many decades or centuries it took to form. You ruined it all. I didn't even get to enjoy it fully."

"Truly, you didn't get to enjoy it fully?" Li Xian asked.

Wen Caishang said, "Of course, I didn't."

Li Xian laughed. "Then take a look here." He took something from his backpack. A cluster of colorful flowers appeared. Wen Caishang was surprised.

Li Xian said, "I knew the sea of flowers couldn't be preserved, and I felt guilty. I picked a few on the way. You said you didn't get to enjoy it fully, so I specially brought them for you to see to your heart's content."

Wen Caishang's face flushed slightly. "That's very thoughtful of you." She felt an inexplicable joy, thinking that even though Li Xian showed her no respect, he was always thinking of her. This feeling was hard to describe.

Li Xian said, "The landscapes of heaven and earth are hard to come by. I destroyed a sea of flowers, so I should plant a sea of flowers."

"I plan to plant these flowers nearby. Sometime in the future, if we pass this way again and the flowers are in full, vibrant bloom, creating a sea of flowers once more, we would surely have a different feeling."

Wen Caishang murmured, "Destroy a sea of flowers, plant a sea of flowers." She pondered this, and suddenly, she had an epiphany. Martial arts takes from heaven and earth; why not give back to heaven and earth? Even for a mortal shell, one eats the five grains of heaven and earth to live, and in the end, does one not return to heaven and earth?

A look of pleasant surprise appeared in her beautiful eyes. Her heart surged, and her understanding deepened. This was a crucial step for her. As the saying goes, opportunity is born from danger.

Li Xian planted the flowers. He helped Wen Caishang with massage to stimulate her blood flow. Gradually, she could move two fingers, which delighted her greatly.

The night grew deeper.

Li Xian, enduring his fatigue, practiced the "Seven Star Step."

[Proficiency: 356/1200 (Proficient)]

His footwork was practiced and becoming smoother. The Qi cluster in his body was solidifying. Li Xian's leaps and dashes were far superior to before. His progress was gratifying, and he felt very pleased.

[Consuming Essence]

[Proficiency: 100/100]

[Description: You drink the essence of heaven and earth. Your body's rhythm aligns with the universe, undergoing nine transformations to shed the mortal shell. To see a thousand miles further, you must climb a higher floor.]

Having gone through intense battles, Li Xian digested the "Heaven and Earth Essence" very quickly. The one and a half scales of the Golden Carp had been mostly consumed. Over three hundred strands remained stored.

Heaven rewards diligence. Li Xian accumulated bit by bit, piling up quantitative changes that led to a qualitative transformation. Looking back, his gains were substantial. The Consuming Essence realm had reached its end, and the transformation continued from the outside in.

He was about to touch upon the second realm of martial arts, the Tai Su realm of Bone-Shaping and Embryo-Molding. Li Xian already knew the characteristics of this realm: "Ethereal Fairy Music," "Three Flowers Above the Head," "Cloak of Turbid Qi," and so on.

When all these characteristics are revealed, one has reached the second realm of martial arts. Li Xian's Consuming Essence was complete, his foundation solid. He continued to digest the essence treasures, just waiting for the four characteristics to manifest. Across the entire Qiongfu region, he could be considered a strong expert.

The Vast Leg, the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword... were successively executed. Reviewing the old to learn the new, he solidified his martial arts. To be able to go further, one must be able to settle one's heart and endure loneliness.

He practiced until dark clouds covered the moon and all the stars were hidden. Feeling extreme fatigue, Li Xian combined work and rest, sitting on the ground to rest.

He pondered the path ahead.

"I started as a menial servant, went through many dangers, from the One Union Manor, to Qingning County, to the Prefecture City... and many challenges. Fortunately, with the help of destiny, I passed them all safely. Now, I am gradually touching the second realm of martial arts. I can say I have achieved a little success. Though it's not worth being complacent, I have finally taken a step forward."

"I saved the Madam, but if I act arrogant because of my merit, there will surely be backlash. Wen Caishang is quite cute right now, but... when she recovers her strength in the future, whether she will hate me or be angry with me is still unknown."

"I made an agreement with her, asking her to serve me. It would be enjoyable for the moment, but whether it's a sin or a debt in the future, it won't be easy to clear. If I successfully send her back to the One Union Manor, the debt of gratitude will be repaid. I might as well just leave. Whether it's a sin or something else, I can just avoid it."

"A man's ambition is to travel far and wide. It's good to go out and explore. But since I'm leaving, I should leave happily. On this journey, I need to 'bully the weak with might' and take advantage of the Madam. With the worm in her body, the lingering finger force, and her old injuries that are hard to heal, she won't be able to turn the tables on this journey."

Seeing Wen Caishang sleeping peacefully, her brow relaxed, and her natural nobility showing, Li Xian couldn't help but be filled with wicked thoughts.

"I need to let the 'Madam of the Broken Sword' also taste the feeling of being at someone else's mercy."

Li Xian chewed on a blade of thatch, lay横 on a tree branch, gazed at the bright moon, and closed his eyes to sleep.

The next day.

Wen Caishang woke up leisurely and looked around for Li Xian. Seeing him sleeping on a tree branch, she felt a little relieved. She watched for a long time, then suddenly froze and averted her gaze.

"Taking the opportunity to bully me, you're incredibly bold. You'll be punished for this when the time comes," Wen Caishang said. Whether angry or happy, it was hard to tell.

Li Xian woke up and washed up simply. He put out the fire pit and buried it with dirt, covering all traces like footprints.

Wen Caishang asked in surprise, "Have you ever been a fugitive?"

Li Xian said, "I was once a Martial Lieutenant. I know how to hunt criminals, so naturally I also know how to escape from them. It was something Senior Li taught me."

Wen Caishang frowned. "Hmph, what's so great about that Li Bohou? From now on, you're not allowed to call him 'Senior Li'. Just call him by his name. Would he dare to blame you?"

She thought to herself, "You're already so disrespectful to me, so why do you still call him 'Senior Li' with such reverence?"

Li Xian gave a perfunctory reply. He carried Wen Caishang on his back and headed elsewhere.

Wen Caishang said, "A-Xian... Although we've shaken off Su Qiuwu, they weren't seriously injured and still have strength left. Moreover, the strong experts from Shiluo Village and the Wujido Sect haven't shown themselves yet. We still need to be careful in our actions."

Li Xian raised an eyebrow. "You're still calling me A-Xian? I'm not 'little' anymore."

Wen Caishang was taken aback and coquettishly said, "You臭小子, what do you want me to call you?"

Li Xian bounced her slightly and said, half-jokingly, half-seriously, "Call me King Li."
