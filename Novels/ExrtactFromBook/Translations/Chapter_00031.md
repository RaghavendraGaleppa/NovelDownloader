# Chapter 31: The Duo!  

Through this transaction, Han Yue discovered his latent potential as a top-tier delivery courier and food delivery rider—born with the innate physique of a delivery saint!  

With the super-speed of **[Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique]** and the storage space provided by numerous storage artifacts, Han Yue possessed strategic-level material delivery capabilities.  

Over the past year, Han Yue had been hunting alone, which was actually quite inefficient. He hadn’t fully utilized his powerful mobility!  

But if he partnered with a strong cultivator like Little Luo, the number of prey he could transport in a single trip would skyrocket—and so would his earnings!  

Han Yue and Little Luo hit it off immediately.  

The two quickly discussed the finer details of their collaboration.  

First, they pooled all their storage artifacts to take stock.  

Han Yue had a **[Corpse Storage Bag]** capable of holding four second-tier demon beasts and a **[Silver Hairpin]**.  

Little Luo had two **[Corpse Storage Bags]**, one large and one small, which could hold a combined total of ten second-tier demon beasts, along with three treasure pouches.  

At the moment, Little Luo’s storage bags still contained the corpses of six demon beasts.  

This meant that, per trip, Han Yue could transport up to fourteen demon beast corpses.  

After some negotiation, they settled on a new profit-sharing arrangement:  

From now on, each second-tier demon beast would be priced at **20 mid-grade spirit stones**.  

If a beast was hunted by one of them alone, the other wouldn’t share in the profits.  

If a beast was hunted jointly, the two would split the earnings—**60% for Little Luo and 40% for Han Yue**.  

The two agreed on this arrangement without much trouble.  

For Han Yue, this was a win on multiple fronts.  

First, he was already making over double the profit on the pricing of the demon beasts.  

Second, not only could he transport more beasts per trip, but he could also earn a share from joint hunts—a massive gain all around.  

For Little Luo, the time she had previously wasted could now be turned into spirit stones!  

Though the price of **20 spirit stones** was less than half of the market rate, the elimination of long travel times meant her earnings per unit of time would be much higher.  

Little Luo still had at least a year left in this place, waiting for the **[Red-Horned Python]** to complete its evolution.  

This was a crucial step in her path to enlightenment, and she was fully prepared to invest the time and effort.  

But with Han Yue’s help, she could now accumulate substantial extra profits in the process!  

This would undoubtedly bolster her foundation, giving her an edge over her peers.  

With their partnership settled, the two wasted no time. Han Yue stored the black dog’s corpse in his **[Corpse Storage Bag]**, and they vanished into the forest.  

---  

Including the black dog, Little Luo had already hunted seven second-tier demon beasts. They still needed seven more, so they had to hurry!  

Second-tier cultivators could already practice flight techniques, riding on beams of light.  

Little Luo’s flight beam was cyan-colored and quite fast—at full speed, she could cover **a thousand kilometers per hour**.  

She took the lead, while Han Yue followed closely behind, controlling his speed.  

Little Luo was already familiar with the surrounding area and knew exactly where the demon beasts lurked.  

Less than an hour into their flight, a second-tier demon beast came into view—a giant salamander submerged in a river.  

Without waiting for Han Yue to prepare, Little Luo charged straight at it.  

Still dozens of meters away, she threw a punch with her right fist!  

Inside her well-proportioned body, her blood flowed like molten mercury! The movement of her qi and blood produced an eerie sound as immense magical power surged through her fist.  

A fist-shaped blast of energy shot through the air and struck the salamander!  

The impact flipped the hundred-ton beast onto its back, eliciting a piercing shriek!  

Only then did the salamander realize a hunter had closed in.  

It fought back with everything it had!  

Activating its innate ability **[Water Control]**, the salamander condensed the river water into a meter-thick shield to protect itself.  

The remaining water in the river transformed into a dragon and lashed out at Little Luo.  

Unfazed, Little Luo threw another punch, this time aimed directly at the water dragon’s head.  

The dragon shattered on contact, dispersing into mist!  

But the fist’s momentum wasn’t spent—it continued forward, smashing through the salamander’s water shield in a single blow!  

The salamander staggered, struggling to regain its footing before lunging at Little Luo with its gaping maw.  

Its mouth was lined with rows of foot-long fangs, layer upon layer, countless in number.  

Yet Little Luo showed no fear. Instead, she charged straight into the beast’s mouth!  

The salamander clamped down hard, trapping Little Luo inside as it channeled all its power, trying to crush her within its body.  

But in the next moment—  

**BOOM!**  

Little Luo burst out from the back of the salamander’s neck, leaving behind a massive hole!  

Blood, brain matter, spinal fluid, and shattered bones splattered everywhere!  

Han Yue watched the entire battle unfold. Little Luo had killed the second-tier demon beast with just three punches—he hadn’t even gotten a chance to act!  

Covered in gore, Little Luo grinned at him.  

"Haha, Runner, you’re too slow! You don’t get a cut of this one!"  

"Clean up here. I’ll go find the next beast!"  

Before Han Yue could reply, she took off on her flight beam, vanishing into the distance.  

Han Yue quietly pondered as he collected the salamander’s corpse and stored it in his **[Corpse Storage Bag]**.  

Little Luo was indeed a disciple of a major sect—her combat prowess was nothing to scoff at!  

From that fight alone, Han Yue could tell she had already reached the **peak of the second tier**! The power of her fist technique was overwhelming—easily on par with Han Yue’s **[Thoughtless Slash]** when he was still at the first tier!  

And this was **without** her contracted beast joining the fight!  

If she and her leopard fought together, their strength would be even more terrifying!  

Aside from the Sword Sect Master, Little Luo was the second cultivator Han Yue had encountered who made him feel utterly outmatched.  

But Han Yue wasn’t too worried.  

With his speed advantage, stealing kills wouldn’t be hard, right?  

Han Yue transformed into a streak of golden light and chased after Little Luo!  

He caught up to her quickly.  

After crossing another **400 kilometers**, they spotted their second target—a second-tier giant rhinoceros!  

Little Luo attacked first again!  

Like a shooting star trailing a long arc of light, she charged straight at the beast!  

The rhinoceros had a massive horn brimming with dense magical energy.  

Yet Little Luo aimed precisely for its strongest point—the tip of the horn!  

Her fist collided with the horn in a thunderous impact!  

The sheer force of her punch **shattered** the magic concentrated on the horn!  

The rhinoceros stiffened momentarily from the blow.  

And in that instant—  

A golden flash streaked past!  

A figure abruptly appeared right in front of the beast’s enormous eye.  

A violet light flickered from the figure’s hand as it thrust straight toward the rhinoceros’s pupil!
