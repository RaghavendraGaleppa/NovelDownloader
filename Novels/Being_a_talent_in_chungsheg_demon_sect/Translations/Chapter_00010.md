Chapter 10: A Dark Night for Murder

Inside his cave abode, in a quiet room, Lu Yang sat cross-legged, beginning his breakthrough.

With the spirit pill ingested, and having continuously cultivated for the past half-month, his cultivation base quickly approached its limit.

"Boom!"

The next second, as if ascending a step, Lu Yang felt a surge of majestic True Qi roaring within him, rushing like a river, greatly invigorating his spirit.

Qi Condensation Second Layer!

"There are no bottlenecks before the Qi Condensation Fourth Layer; as long as resources are sufficient, one can reach it with time—but it seems I don't have that luxury right now."

The presence of Immortal Clear Dust ignited a sense of crisis in Lu Yang. He wouldn't forget that in his previous life, Liu Xin had openly forced his way into his cave abode. If Liu Xin could do it, why couldn't Immortal Clear Dust? His cave abode wasn't reliable either!

"The truly reliable things are one's own cultivation and strength!"

At this thought, Lu Yang gritted his teeth, directly took out all his remaining spirit pills, swallowed them whole without much care, then called for Yun Miaoqing. Although this was somewhat wasteful, with at least thirty percent of the spirit pills' medicinal efficacy lost, it also allowed him to increase his cultivation at the fastest possible speed. In Lu Yang's eyes, as long as he could break through to the Qi Condensation Third Layer, these spirit pills would have been used to their fullest and not bought in vain.

Time flew, and in the blink of an eye, three days and three nights passed. During this period, Lu Yang neither ate nor drank, finally feeling a thin barrier give way.

"...It's done!"

Lu Yang introspected his body, feeling a vast river-like True Qi flowing through his meridians. It seemed boundless, yet in reality, it could no longer advance even slightly. At first glance, it seemed as if his cultivation had reached perfection.

"This is the bottleneck..."

One step further would be the Qi Condensation Fourth Layer, a leap from the early to mid-stage. In the Sacred Sect, such a cultivator would be an outstanding disciple capable of holding certain positions.

Lu Yang didn't stop, nor dared to relax. He directly took out the Innate Primordial Qi.

"Continue!"

The Innate Primordial Qi circulated. Lu Yang then manipulated his True Qi to swallow it whole, watching his True Qi surge like a hundred rivers flowing into the sea, pouring into his Dantian. As the Innate Primordial Qi was continuously consumed, Lu Yang soon felt the bottleneck that had trapped him like an insurmountable mountain being gradually weakened. By the time the Innate Primordial Qi was completely depleted, that invisible bottleneck melted away like ice and snow, crumbling in an instant!

In the dim quiet room, Lu Yang suddenly opened his eyes. His gaze was like a torch, illuminating the empty chamber with light. In the blink of an eye, another day and night had passed, yet from this moment on, Lu Yang's strength was vastly different from what it had been just a few days ago!

"The mid-stage of Qi Condensation... it's practically not the same realm as the early stage." Lu Yang felt the changes within him, a joyful expression on his face. "If the True Qi in the early stage was a small river, then in the mid-stage, it's a vast sea! It's increased by more than tenfold! Only at this step can one be considered a true cultivator..."

In the early Qi Condensation stage, True Qi was limited, and one had to conserve every spell and divine ability. But after advancing to the mid-stage of Qi Condensation, there was generally no need to worry about such things. Ordinary spells could be cast at will, and the consumed True Qi could be replenished in a few breaths.

"Excellent! Excellent!"

Lu Yang exited the quiet room, took out a White Bone Flying Sword. With a thought, the flying sword instantly split into ten sword lights, enveloping the entire cave abode.

Whoosh, whoosh—!

In an instant, the sword lights whistled fiercely. Lu Yang executed the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art, merging his body with the sword light, and for a moment, he felt an unparalleled sense of comfort and ease.

"I also have Liu Xin to thank!"

"Without this 'Innate Primordial Qi' that perfectly suited me, I wouldn't have been able to break through at all. I would have been stuck at the Qi Condensation Third Layer for several years at least!"

"No wonder Liu Xin abandoned the Grand Harmony of Yin and Yang to cultivate that Innate Dao Scripture."

"What a pity its foundation is crooked, using humans as medicine. After Liu Xin obtained it, who knows how much bloodshed and slaughter he caused? It all stemmed from that Innate Dao Scripture."

"Such an evil art, it should be used by me!"

A sudden surge of greed appeared in Lu Yang's heart.

"No hurry, hold back for now... next life, perhaps. There's plenty of time ahead."

As Lu Yang was deep in thought, he suddenly raised an eyebrow, looking towards the entrance of his cave abode. One of the sword lights he had dispatched had just been triggered.

"Someone's here?"

A cold glint immediately flashed in Lu Yang's eyes. At the same time, he felt a bit fortunate; thankfully, he had acted decisively, choosing to break through his cultivation as quickly as possible, even if it meant some waste. Otherwise, if he were still in seclusion, completely unaware of the outside world, wouldn't he have been certain to die?

"This must serve as a warning..."

With this thought, Lu Yang quickly reined in his newly breakthrough aura. The killing intent in his heart, however, intensified, as if he were a hunter quietly waiting for his prey to walk into his trap.

"Click."

Accompanied by a soft sound, the cave abode's main door was quietly pried open. Immediately after, three figures slipped in stealthily, one after another, from outside the abode. The three wore black clothes and masks, their True Qi not revealing even a hint. Hidden in the shadows, Lu Yang marveled at them. If he hadn't already broken through to a higher cultivation level, he probably wouldn't have been able to discern their true nature, thinking they were just ordinary people. Their skill in concealing their aura was truly exquisite.

...

The black-clad leader among the three made a hand gesture without speaking. The others understood immediately, quickly fanning out to search the cave abode.

"Whoosh, whoosh!"

The next second, the black-clad person in the lead felt his vision blur. Then, a dazzling sword light, accompanied by a whistling sword hum, appeared before his eyes!

"No!"

The black-clad person's face instantly changed drastically. He had no time to defend, only managing to roll sideways in an attempt to dodge. But no matter how fast a person was, how could they be faster than a flying sword?

Swish—!

The sword light flashed, and a pillar of blood shot into the sky!

"Qi Condensation Mid-stage!?"

The black-clad leader was clearly discerning. From the sword light's power and quality, he immediately recognized Lu Yang's cultivation level, crying out in alarm on the spot. At the same time, he cursed inwardly.

"Damn that Clear Dust! This is a newly initiated disciple?! An easy target?!"

"And this Lu Yang, clearly at the mid-stage of Qi Condensation, could completely crush their three early-stage cultivators head-on. Yet, he still resorted to deception and sneak attacks on them? What a dog!"

Seeing the sword light flying towards him, the black-clad person quickly chanted a spell, emitting a mystic light to protect himself, while also urgently shouting, "Misunderstanding! It's all a misunderstanding..."

"Boom!"

Lu Yang turned a deaf ear. The sword light slashed horizontally, instantly cleaving the black-clad person's protective mystic light to the brink of shattering. At the same time, a mass of True Qi unfurled in the darkness with a roar, like raging waves, finally transforming into a giant hand, its palm lines distinct, several zhang in size, directly grabbing another black-clad person.

Splat!

The next second, the giant hand suddenly exerted force, directly crushing the second black-clad person until he exploded, muscles torn and bones shattered, splattering red and white everywhere.

This brutal scene made the black-clad leader's eyes nearly split open in fury.

On the other side, Lu Yang's face showed satisfaction.

"This Innate Primordial Qi Great Hand Seal is indeed quite good. While it doesn't show much power against cultivators of the same realm, it's incredibly effective for dealing with lower-ranked cultivators."

While he mused, the sword light did not stop. More than ten sword lights whistled through the cave abode, while the White Bone Flying Sword blinked and wove between them, giving the black-clad leader no chance to breathe. After a few breaths, the black-clad leader was already exhausted. Lu Yang seized an opening, a sword slash, and immediately another pillar of blood shot into the sky.

"Phew! That was truly dangerous..."

After all this was done, Lu Yang finally let out a breath of relief. Looking at the corpses and shredded flesh scattered on the floor, he felt a lingering fear recalling the battle he had just fought. Strictly speaking, this was his first time killing someone. Although he had practiced that smooth combo of hiding in the shadows and launching a sneak attack countless times in private, it was, after all, his first time using it in real combat.

"To be fair, my combat experience is far inferior to these three. Even at the same realm, forget three, I might not even be able to defeat one. However, as long as I manage to sneak attack, seize the initiative, and force them to compete in raw power, I can still easily suppress them with my higher cultivation realm."

"This is why fighting with raw power is not as good as fighting with divine abilities, and fighting with divine abilities is not as good as fighting with cultivation and insight..."
