# Chapter 23: A Different Will

Han Li slowly walked back to the center of the stone room. Only then did his tense muscles relax. He sat down by the edge of the magic array drawn with beast bone powder. Han Zhen looked at the book by candlelight. The six fist-sized green jades embedded around the array had long been put away. Under the candlelight, the jades were clear and translucent. Han Zhen held them in his hand and tried to circulate the Evergreen Arts. Immediately, he felt the abundant spiritual energy within the jades being absorbed.

Han Zhen's guess was indeed correct. These must be spirit stones that Mo Juren had plundered from Yu Zitong's corpse. The greatest use of spirit stones was in setting up arrays and consuming them for casting spells. This unactivated array on the ground was likely intended to assist Mo Juren's soul in leaving his body, providing him with ample magic power. This was also why Han Zhen chose to act before Mo Juren could cast his spell. Spirit stones and talismans were too essential for Han Zhen at this moment.

On the other side of the array, outside, Mo Juren had a head of white hair, and his face, smashed by a punch, still showed traces of madness. Inside the stone room, only the occasional crackling sound of the candlewick could be heard. The shadows cast by the flickering light danced along, making the scene appear both harmonious and extremely eerie. In his desperation, Mo Juren didn't even have time to extinguish the candle, which put his and Yu Zitong's souls in an unfavorable environment, accelerating their defeat.

Han Zhen continued to study the spells recorded at the end of the book, knowing that Han Li, having survived the ordeal, needed time to recover. After a moment, Han Li looked up at Mo Juren's corpse. After a few seconds of silence, he looked at Han Zhen, who was intently studying the book. Han Zhen looked up and met Han Li's gaze. At a time like this, there was naturally no room for modesty.

"Everything of Yu Zitong's belongs to me. As for Doctor Mo's belongings, you can deal with them however you wish. Oh, and this is useless to me now." Han Zhen handed the "Evergreen Scripture" to Han Li. He had already checked every page and found no hidden compartments. The cultivation methods for the seventh and eighth layers of the Evergreen Arts, and the few spells recorded in the last few pages, could be memorized with just a few glances. The rest merely required a bit of time for [Heaven's Reward] to comprehend.

Han Li carefully put away the Evergreen Arts. Then, he stood up and walked directly to Doctor Mo's shriveled corpse, meticulously searching it inch by inch without hesitation. Familiar and unfamiliar items were dug out one by one. As the number of items increased, Han Li became more and more alarmed. He had actually lived with such a dangerous person for four years. In front of Han Zhen, Han Li separated the recognizable and unrecognizable items into two piles. Most of them were concealed weapons and poisons that could kill upon drawing blood.

A small brass bell and an unopened sachet, which felt like paper, were put aside into another pile. Han Zhen's divine sense swept over them. Apart from the small brass bell, the rest of the items had no spiritual aura; they were all ordinary mortal objects. The book did not contain the Corpse Refining Art, and an obscure magical artifact like the brass bell probably wasn't worth many spirit stones. However, even if there was a Corpse Refining Art, Han Zhen wouldn't learn it. The thought of carrying a corpse around at all times made him feel an unbearable chill.

But even an ant has meat. Han Zhen knew deeply how rare even a single spirit stone was for low-level Qi Condensation cultivators. The six spirit stones Mo Juren used to set up the array might have been Yu Zitong's entire remaining fortune after leaving his cultivation family. Han Zhen took the Soul-Guiding Bell, then opened the sachet. He looked at the contents of the letter inside, then smiled oddly and handed it to Han Li. It was Mo Juren's will, but its contents had changed significantly from what Han Zhen knew.

Mo Juren had temporarily changed his plan to seize Han Li's body, so the contents of the will were naturally drafted in haste. Yet, he still looked down on Yu Zitong, believing that even if he failed, Han Li would be the one to survive. According to the original timeline, when Mo Juren returned to Godly Hand Valley this time, he would have used Corpse Worm Pills to threaten Han Li, leaving a hidden trap of "Yin Poison" in the antidote, forcing Han Li to seek the Warm Yang Jade. None of the above was mentioned in this will; it only spoke of a simple transaction with Han Li.

Using his vast family fortune and unused Blood Spirit Grass, in exchange for Han Li making a trip to his home within at most four years. Before his enemies became suspicious, Han Li was to protect his wife and daughters, preferably keeping them far away from the feuds of the jianghu. If Han Li was capable, he could even marry all three of his daughters.

Han Li, who had always been interested in wealth, was instantly moved. He had previously redoubled his efforts in cultivating the Evergreen Arts because Mo Juren increased his payment. Han Li then thought of Doctor Mo's enviable face, and beautiful, charming women couldn't help but appear in his mind. After all, Han Li was also at the age of budding romance, and strange feelings immediately arose in his heart, even stronger than the allure of the Blood Spirit Grass. After all, he already had the small green bottle, which could cultivate spiritual plants far more valuable than Blood Spirit Grass on his own. And the risk of obtaining all this was merely dealing with some jianghu practitioners. If it were before, Han Li would probably have immediately asked Han Zhen for his opinion. But now, Han Li just looked at Mo Juren's corpse, his face flushed, clearly agitated inwardly.

After all, Han Li hadn't left the mountain for over four years, and his daily life was a monotonous routine of cultivation, so his heart had long been restless. Han Zhen had read the contents of the will. Although Blood Spirit Grass was precious, its greatest effect was breaking through the bottleneck of the Qi Condensation stage. For Han Zhen, who possessed the fortune of [Heaven's Reward], this was actually useless. Although the Warm Yang Jade was not mentioned in the will, Han Zhen knew it was just a slightly mystical jade that could dispel yin poison and coldness, offering little help to cultivation.

After thinking it over, Han Zhen decided it wasn't worth the time to specifically visit the Mo Residence and get entangled with mortals. Immortals couldn't stay with mortals forever; in the end, it would only leave regret. He was already satisfied with the harvest of six spirit stones and one magical artifact, the Soul-Guiding Bell. He had to leave something for Han Li. Han Zhen looked at Han Li's expression; he was clearly tempted. However, that was Han Li's own path, and Han Zhen had no intention of interfering.

Before Han Zhen was about to leave the stone room to search for the arrow he didn't know where he had shot, he still offered a reminder: "Yu Zitong, with the seventh layer of Evergreen Arts, still fell into Doctor Mo's hands." Han Li instantly calmed down. Anyone Doctor Mo considered an enemy wouldn't be easy to deal with. "Whether to agree to Doctor Mo's deal, let's wait until I've learned spells," Han Li secretly sighed to himself. From Yu Zitong's self-description, Han Li naturally also knew that cultivators without spells were just slightly sturdier ordinary people. And Han Li now only had the fourth layer of Evergreen Arts and no magical artifacts, making him an ant in the cultivation world.

He put the will into the sachet and carefully put it away. In the latter half of the day, Han Li buried Mo Juren's body under a large tree in Godly Hand Valley and thoroughly cleaned the array within the stone room.
