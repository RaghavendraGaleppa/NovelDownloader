Chapter 352: All Are Nourishment

Xu Yunfan was not satisfied. If these people were to retreat, he would naturally have no way to extract the true qi from their bodies.

With no more scruples, the true qi around his body instantly boiled. The Ten Extremes True Qi surged like a raging flame. In the blink of an eye, the ground beneath his feet collapsed with a thunderous roar, cracking into a spiderweb of fissures.

The next moment, his figure blurred. The air, compressed by his extreme speed, let out a deafening sonic boom. Visible shockwaves exploded outward like furious waves, kicking up a violent blast that sent debris and shattered weapons at the edge of the training platform flying.

His form transformed almost into a crimson streak of light tearing through the sky. Wherever he passed, the air was compressed at high speed, forming layers of visible white air rings that spread out one after another.

The Nine Sun Sect's purple-robed elder didn't even have time to react. He only felt a blur before his eyes before Xu Yunfan appeared before him like a ghost. His hand, shrouded in the devouring Ten Extremes True Qi, slammed toward the elder's crown like an iron claw.

The purple-robed elder's pupils constricted violently. The formidable, fire-like Nine Sun True Qi within his body had yet to be activated when he felt a terrifying suction force coming from the top of his head. The true qi in his flesh and blood poured out like floodwaters breaching a dam.

The purple-robed elder trembled violently. The originally surging Nine Sun True Qi poured out from beneath Xu Yunfan's palm like a bursting dam.

His skin withered visibly, his muscles atrophied, and his bones protruded. His originally dignified face twisted like dead wood, his eye sockets sank in, and his lips cracked. He couldn't even let out a scream before turning into a skeletal, dried-up corpse!

Xu Yunfan felt the Nine Sun True Qi surging into his body. The Ten Extremes True Qi operated like a millstone, crushing and refining the foreign true qi, ultimately turning it into pure energy that merged with his own flesh and blood.

He slowly exhaled a breath of turbid air, which was like a dragon, mixed with wisps of black gas—the impurities of the true qi completely removed. The remaining essence nourished his limbs and bones like sweet dew, causing his aura to rise once more!

At the same time, the moment the true qi touched his flesh, it surged through Xu Yunfan's body like a tidal wave. Every inch of flesh and every bone underwent a world-changing transformation under the scouring of the rising true qi.

Muscle fibers reorganized like dragons and snakes entwining, bones took on a jade-like luster, and a sound like metal and stone clashing faintly echoed from his internal organs.

If it were an ordinary martial artist, under such violent true qi impact, their mind would have been overwhelmed by the surging power long ago. Their seven emotions and six desires would have run wild like a prairie fire, leading to deviation into madness at best, and exploding into nothingness at worst.

However, Xu Yunfan's eyes remained as clear as a cold pool.

But for Xu Yunfan, who had long practiced the Spirit-Quelling Art, it had no effect whatsoever. The self-divinity condensed by the "Spirit-Quelling Art" in his sea of consciousness still sat in the center, suppressing all delusions and stray desires.

This mysterious mental cultivation technique from Yu Congling's remains now acted as a sea-stabilizing needle. No matter how turbulent the true qi in his body became, his spiritual platform remained untainted.

The Ten Extremes True Qi, harmonized by the Primordial True Seed, flowed through his limbs and bones as easily as moving his fingers. With every cycle, his physique advanced toward a non-human realm.

This was no longer a simple breakthrough in martial arts, but the beginning of a slow leap in the level of his life!

The people below the platform watched this scene with horror etched on their faces. They could clearly perceive that the figure shrouded in the visible Ten Extremes True Qi was surpassing the limits of the Ninth Realm of Qi Condensation at a terrifying speed.

What was even more frightening was that throughout such a剧烈 transformation, Xu Yunfan's aura remained as steady as an abyss, as if the shell of his body did not house a mortal, but a banished immortal.

The disciples of the Nine Sun Sect were even more terrified out of their wits. Some stumbled backward, some fell to their knees with weak legs, and others collapsed directly to the ground, their eyes filled with despair.

They had never imagined that a dignified Ninth Realm Qi Condensation expert would be drained dry alive in the span of a few breaths!

"What kind of demonic art is this?" a master from one of the five great sects couldn't help but ask, his lips trembling, the hilt of his sword almost slipping from his grasp.

"Demon!"

Another expert from the Nine Sun Sect came to his senses, gritting his teeth fiercely, his expression ferocious. The fierce sun true energy around him burst forth, ready to fight to the death.

"Demon! Cease your actions!" an old Taoist with white hair and a rosy complexion from the Xuanzhen Sect shouted sharply. Twelve golden talismans flew out from his sleeve, turning into chains that wrapped toward Xu Yunfan's neck.

Xu Yunfan didn't even look back. His left hand's five fingers flicked lightly, and the Ten Extremes True Qi condensed into five crimson threads. The moment they collided with the talisman chains, they melted the chains into golden liquid.

The old Taoist grunted and retreated, his sleeve smoking.

"The Golden Light Talismans are probably the Xuanzhen Sect's most treasured possessions. It's a pity to use them so casually. If they had been nurtured for a few more years, they might have recovered some of their power," Xu Yunfan said slowly, his tone filled with regret. Having spent so much time in the Dao Sect, his vision had naturally improved.

These Golden Light Talismans, known as Mountain Talismans, were refined by a super expert from the Xuanzhen Sect who had reached the Land Immortal Realm two thousand years ago. Initially, a single Golden Light Talisman could transform into a mountain to bear upon one's body, with the weight of hundreds of millions of tons. How could mortal strength withstand that?

Over the long years, their power had eroded with time, and now, a Mountain Talisman couldn't even support the weight of a small hill.

At the same time, the complexions of the three female cultivators from the Penglai Pavilion changed drastically. They spread their hands, and a幽 blue Water True Qi enveloped their bodies.

The tall figure beside them suddenly tore open its cloak.

With a tearing sound, a ferocious figure over three meters tall appeared abruptly!

It was none other than the Penglai Pavilion's Sea-Suppressing Emissary, "Xuan Lin." His entire body was covered in armor made from deep-sea thousand-year-old black iron, each scale inscribed with ancient sea-suppressing runes.

The gills on both sides of his cheeks flared violently, and a terrifying gurgling sound rolled in his throat. When he opened his mouth to roar, he revealed a mouthful of jagged, serrated fangs, and a faint dragon's might vibrated from the chilling gleam.

"Seize!" the three female cultivators shouted in unison. Together with Xuan Lin, they threw out nine black iron chains that emitted a cold, blue glow.

As soon as the chains left their hands, the "Nine Nether Demon-Suppressing Talisman" inscribed on their bodies lit up one after another. The top of each chain actually transformed into a ferocious snake head, spitting out bone-corroding cold mist, and they twisted toward Xu Yunfan's feet like a heaven-and-earth net.

A divine weapon with such a transformation? Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a sharp light. The tip of his foot tapped the void just as the chains were about to touch him.

His figure spun rapidly like a tornado. The Ten Extremes True Qi formed a spiral energy around his body. The nine cold iron chains, infused with Xuan Lin's hundred years of cultivation, were actually deflected by this spinning force. With several clanging sounds, they tightly bound a "Ci" generation high monk from the Maitreya Temple who was sneaking an attack from behind!

The monk's muscles were bulging, his blocky muscles like armor, and his body radiated a golden luster. But now, the luster instantly dimmed, his face frozen in astonishment.

The demon-subduing pestle in his hand was only half a foot from Xu Yunfan's back heart!

Xuan Lin flew into a rage upon seeing this. A foul, sticky liquid seeped from the gaps between his scales. His thick, muscular arms bulged with veins. He actually pulled the chain, dragging the bound monk and the three female cultivators with him, causing them to stumble several steps.
