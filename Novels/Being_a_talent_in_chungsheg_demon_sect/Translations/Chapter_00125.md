# Chapter 125: Each Displaying Their Prowess

“What method do you have in mind?”

Facing Bi Feiyuan’s proactive offer, Lu Yang did not underestimate her. Since his experience in the Refinement Secret Realm, he had learned not to belittle anyone.

Prejudice in the human heart is a great mountain. Old Ancestor Yun had underestimated cultivators below the Foundation Establishment realm, which led to his unexpected defeat and the discovery of his existence.

Seeing Lu Yang so courteous, Bi Feiyuan naturally dared not neglect him and quickly said, “The divine ability I cultivate can sense anyone harboring lustful thoughts towards me, and then implant demonic thoughts into them from afar, causing them to fall into qi deviation. This divine ability can actually also be used to track an enemy’s location.”

“…I can also try.”

On the other side, Jiaolong Daoist muttered, “I have the nose of a Qi-Sniffing Hound. Given time, I should be able to find the Dao Court’s gathering place. I would need the qi presence of a cultivator from the Dao Court side.”

Xu Xin also spoke, “I have a Curse-Killing Art that can trace along qi presence. Perhaps I can use it to find the location of the Dao Court’s leader.”

“…I have a magic treasure that I can lend you.”

Chongming looked at Lu Yang, hesitated for a moment, and then whispered, “It was specially refined for me by my father; it can assist in calculating karmic heavenly secrets.”

With that, he took out a round disk. Eight trigrams were imprinted on the disk, and as Lu Yang channeled his spiritual power, the disk immediately emitted a surging spiritual light. As the trigrams spun, countless faint images subtly emerged.

Clearly, most Sacred Sect True Inheritors possessed several trump cards.

However, a strange silence soon fell among everyone. Finally, their gazes shifted, all simultaneously turning to Qin Tianhe, who stood awkwardly in the corner.

“Uh…” Qin Tianhe thought for a moment, then slapped Guangming, who was standing beside him with wide eyes, not daring to speak. “I can find the Dao Court’s location through him!”

Guangming was stunned upon hearing this. “Huh?”

Qin Tianhe, however, looked excited and continued, “The Void-Piercing Sky-Shuttling Dark Shuttle is my Natal Spirit Treasure. I can sense it no matter how far apart we are.”

At this point, Qin Tianhe felt his thoughts open up. “As long as I give it to this bald monk and have him return to meet the Dao Court’s leader, then as soon as the Dao Court’s leader appears to meet him, I can immediately lock onto the Dao Court’s hidden location directly through the Void-Piercing Sky-Shuttling Dark Shuttle!”

He then glanced at Guangming. “Of course, that’s assuming this bald monk is willing to cooperate.”

“…Willing! Willing!” Guangming finally seemed to awaken from a dream and quickly shouted, “As long as Senior spares my life, I’ll cooperate with anything!”

Lu Yang nodded at this. “Then let’s all give it a try.”

Soon, Guangming and Qin Tianhe departed. The remaining Sacred Sect True Inheritors silently found their own spots, began gathering other Sacred Sect disciples, and then laid out their magic treasures and formation diagrams on the ground.

This was because the disciples stationed at the very front had already sent back news. Qi-Devouring Worms had appeared. They were vast in scale, countless in number, appearing from afar like a black tide, stirring up surging waves and swarming towards their direction.

“Two objectives: block these worms, and either find the Worm King that controls them, or find the hiding place of that group of Jiangdong vermin.”

“Leave the rest to the True Person.” Xu Xin looked relaxed. “These worms are quite formidable. Try to finish before I get killed. Oh, young master, it’s dangerous here. Do you want to hide further back?”

“Bullshit!” Looking at the distant worm swarm, Chongming took a deep breath, cast aside his immortal scion dignity, and directly cursed, “If you can do it, why can’t I?”

Xu Xin immediately burst out laughing.

On the other side, Jiaolong Daoist said nothing, merely transforming back into his flesh-mutated dragon form. Bi Feiyuan leaned against his dragon body to rest.

“Your body… truly beautiful. I truly wish to possess you,” Bi Feiyuan said, patting Jiaolong Daoist’s body, drooling. “Say, do you want to cultivate with me? I have a lot of experience.”

“We’re simply a match made in heaven!”

Facing Bi Feiyuan’s direct proposal, Jiaolong Daoist calmly shook his dragon head. “Apologies, you look too much like a human. I have no interest.”

Such conversations quickly spread among the Sacred Sect disciples. Everyone’s tone was very calm, and laughter occasionally erupted, as if no one paid any mind to the boundless sea of worms vaguely appearing in the distance. Only when the worm sea drew near did the sounds abruptly cease.

Most of those who managed to distinguish themselves in the Sacred Sect were like this. These devils usually bully the weak and fear the strong. If you are a True Person, they will be subservient. But if you aren’t even a True Person, why should they fear you? Moreover, there was a True Monarch overseeing the battle outside!

Therefore, after a brief pause, their voices erupted again, merging into a single word:

“Kill!!!”

In an instant, streaks of magic treasure spiritual light shot up into the sky, and countless divine abilities intertwined, erupting, and clashing thunderously with the overwhelming tide of Qi-Devouring Worms!

At the very front of the Sacred Sect’s formation, the Myriad Spirits Banner fluttered in the wind. Immediately after, countless Banner Spirits emerged from it—Underworld Soldiers, Ghost Generals, and Buddhist cultivator monks. They significantly reduced the casualties of the Sacred Sect disciples.

In the firmament above, Lu Yang stood suspended in the void. The Yama Palace appeared behind him, empowering the Banner Spirits with his Foundation Establishment tier, ensuring they could inflict considerable damage on the Qi-Devouring Worms.

From his vantage point, he could clearly overlook the battle, like a sturdy reef amidst surging waves. Countless Qi-Devouring Worms rushed forward one after another. Those at the front were slain by Sacred Sect disciples, while those behind consumed the corpses of their fallen kin before continuing the same charge.

“Heavenfall.” Lu Yang raised a hand, striking at the very moment the battle line was about to break. With a single point, tens of thousands of Qi-Devouring Worms were instantly crushed to dust.

However, this was only temporary. Like the ebb and flow of tides, the Qi-Devouring Worms shattered by Lu Yang merely regrouped before charging back with a fearless demeanor.

“We can win!”

Looking at the front-line battle report projected by the Worm King’s spiritual sense, Wang Jinting clenched his fist tightly, his face showing an uncontrollable excitement.

The terror of the Qi-Devouring Worms was undeniable. As long as they consumed spiritual energy, they could automatically multiply and propagate. Consuming a single living person would cause their numbers to increase severalfold; they were simply inexhaustible. Indeed, Wang Jinting was greatly surprised that the Initial Sacred Sect could withstand the Qi-Devouring Worms’ first wave of attack. If it had been the Dao Court, they would have been wiped out long ago.

“The only thing to be wary of is that True Person from the Sacred Sect. But as long as he doesn’t find my location, this Dao-contention battle can continue.”

Wang Jinting was not foolish. He knew very well that he, holding an Attainment Treasure, and the Worm King, bearing Heavenly Mandate, were the key to victory. Anyone else could die, but they absolutely could not. Similarly, those devils would definitely rack their brains to find him.

However, Wang Jinting was confident in his preparations. “With the Comprehensive Atlas of the Vast Territory, I can immediately ascertain the identity of anyone approaching me. As long as something feels off, I’ll escape…”

Just then, a messenger disciple suddenly entered from outside:

“Senior Brother, a monk managed to survive!”

“Oh?” Wang Jinting paused upon hearing this. “Who?”

“He says his name is Guangming, and he escaped from the area where they were fighting the Jiangbei devils. He has important intelligence concerning that Foundation Establishment True Person among the devils…”

At these words, Wang Jinting immediately stood up. To be safe, he first took out the Comprehensive Atlas of the Vast Territory and glanced at it, confirming that it was indeed a Buddhist cultivator and not a devil disguised. Only then did he sigh in relief. The Pure Land and the Dao Court had allied against the enemy this time; they should still be trustworthy.

“I’ll go see him now!”
