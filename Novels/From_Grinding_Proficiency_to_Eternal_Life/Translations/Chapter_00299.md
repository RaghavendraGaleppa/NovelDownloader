# Chapter 299: The Defense Power of an Eighth-Grade Divine Weapon

Xu Yunfan said, "Then I shall request guidance from Senior Brother's superior techniques."

If he wanted all resources to be allocated to him, he naturally needed to demonstrate his value. With Bi Yuan predicting the arrival of the Heavenly Demon, Xu Yunfan was unwilling to sit and wait for death. Only by quickly stepping into the Ninth Realm could he have a chance to transcend survival.

As his words fell, the two men sprang into action simultaneously!

Before Xu Yunfan's words had even finished echoing, the bluestone beneath his feet exploded with spiderweb-like cracks. His bones and muscles, having entered the minor success stage of Marrow Cleansing, connected seamlessly like tempered hundred-refined steel. His spine arched like a great dragon as the opening stance of the "Mountain Shattering Form" from the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique caused his muscles to surge like waves.

The dragon scale armor covering his right arm rustled continuously as his Qi and blood surged. Under the催动 of his blood energy, it revealed a luster with faint red patterns. Beneath the armor, the thick tendons under the skin of his arm coiled like flood dragons.

The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel transformed into a crimson rainbow piercing the sun. Under the infusion of Pure Yang True Qi, the dragon patterns on the cudgel's body actually appeared with magma-like dark red veins.

Chu Cangming's eyes flashed with intense light. The long sword in his hand hummed softly, emitting a tremor like a dragon's cry. This Senior Brother, who had walked an extremely profound path in Organ Refining, now had the Seven Orifices emitting a tangible Vital Energy. It was a unique phenomenon refined from the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock.

When he stepped, the tip of his foot lightly touched the ground. His seemingly ethereal "Treading the Dipper and Stepping on the Stars" movement technique left deep three-inch footprints on the black stone bricks. The trajectory of his sword's edge carried a pressure like a collapsing mountain. The ultimate move, "Heavenly Gate Severing," actually tore the air, creating a visible pale wave.

"Clang!"

The moment the cudgel and sword collided, a ring of explosive air burst out from the center of the two men.

The blood that burst from Xu Yunfan's tiger's mouth had not yet splattered before it was burned into a mist of blood by the scorching heat rising from the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

What immense power!

Xu Yunfan's pupils trembled slightly. He found it somewhat unbelievable that Chu Cangming's single sword strike possessed the force of a collapsing mountain.

At the moment of contact, the muscles of his right arm suddenly twisted strangely in three folds. The blood energy guided by the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique formed a spiral force within his meridians, actually diverting the ten-thousand-jun巨力 transmitted by Chu Cangming's sword into the ground beneath his feet.

The black stone ground collapsed with a rumble. Xu Yunfan's ankles sank into the earth, but he used the momentum to complete the force circulation method recorded in the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique. The 206 bones throughout his body vibrated at a high frequency simultaneously, completely dissolving the sword Qi that had invaded his internal organs.

The force-dissipating application of the Hundred-Refined Steel Body, the exquisite bone vibration and buzzing of the Secret Art Cicada Refining Body Technique, and the force guidance technique of the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique...

Chu Cangming's pupils contracted sharply. He truly hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to be able to take this sword strike of his. Although it seemed he took a clever approach, the fact remained that he had taken it.

"The Mountain Severing Sword Art?" Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. "I didn't expect Senior Brother Chu to have practiced this sword art."

Chu Cangming said calmly, "Of the Dao Sect's nine top sword arts, I have dabbled in all of them."

Xu Yunfan expressed surprise. "Practicing so many, aren't you afraid of being extensive but not profound?"

Chu Cangming felt somewhat stifled hearing this. How dare Xu Yunfan say that to others? Not to mention how many different styles of divine arts and supreme techniques he himself had practiced, yet under such circumstances, he hadn't exploded due to changes in his blood energy frequency.

Before Chu Cangming could change his move, the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel suddenly twisted like a living creature. The divine weapon possessed a spirit; the dragon head at the cudgel's end actually raised its head and bit down on the spine of the Heavy Mountain Sword.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with intense light. The Pure Yang True Qi inside his body boiled like magma, reaching his palm through his muscles and skin before pouring into the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

The dragon patterns on the cudgel's body suddenly lit up, as if a crimson flood dragon had awakened. The scorching heat even caused the surrounding air to distort and evaporate.

His left palm suddenly slapped the tail of the cudgel. The blood energy condensed by the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique and the Pure Yang True Qi condensed by the Pure Yang One Qi Technique爆发 simultaneously, actually forming three layers of superimposed shockwaves on the cudgel's body.

The first layer, like a furious wave crashing against the shore, made the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel emit a dragon-like trembling cry. Wherever the cudgel's edge passed, the air was torn, leaving a visible pale scar.

The second layer followed closely, like a mountain collapsing. The overbearing force of the Pure Yang True Qi was transmitted through the cudgel's body, making Chu Cangming's long sword couldn't help but emit a low humming sound.

The third layer was like a thunderclap. The true meaning of the ultimate move "亢龙无悔" (Flood Dragon Without Regret) from the Nine Mystic Flood Dragon Cudgel Technique was completely released. The force, propelled by the heavy cudgel of the divine weapon, actually condensed a solid phantom of a dragon head at the cudgel's end, which bit down on the sword's body!

"Sss!"

Chu Cangming's right sleeve tore apart piece by piece in the violent shockwaves, revealing an arm with faint golden threads.

Xu Yunfan's gaze flickered slightly.

This Chu Cangming was also someone who had cultivated his muscles, bones, and skin to perfection. His physical body showed distinct characteristics of such perfection. Moreover, the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock had been cultivated by Chu Cangming to a very deep level.

Yet even so, under the collision with Xu Yunfan, his tiger's mouth was still cracked. The blood hadn't even dripped before it was burned into a mist by the Pure Yang True Qi.

The long sword trembled violently under the impact of the immense force. The sword hilt actually scorched Chu Cangming's palm!

"Boom!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly retreated and twisted his waist. The原本 domineering and matchless cudgel technique suddenly turned soft and Yin.

The meticulous force application method of the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique was嫁接 onto the heavy cudgel. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel slid along the sword spine towards Chu Cangming's wrist at an extremely clever angle.

The heavy cudgel rubbed against the sword spine, producing a string of sparks.

The onlookers were quite surprised. They had thought that Xu Yunfan was skilled in using heavy weapons, and his style should be open and generous. But now, Xu Yunfan was using a heavy cudgel with the delicacy of an embroidery needle. It seemed even lighter and more agile than sword arts that took the path of deviation and agility.

Chu Cangming let out a long cry. His long sword suddenly left his hand and spun. His left hand formed a sword seal to activate a secret art, while his right hand formed a spear-like finger and thrust towards Xu Yunfan's Tanzhong acupoint.

Splitting Light and Snatching Shadow?

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. Although he had been burying his head in intense training these past few days, he wasn't completely cut off from the outside world. This technique of Splitting Light and Snatching Shadow was actually a top-tier movement technique, even vaguely transcending the realm of martial arts. He hadn't expected it to be used as an attacking method.

This "Splitting Light and Snatching Shadow" concealed seven changes. The Vital Energy condensed at the fingertip drew a dark blue trajectory in the air.

Xu Yunfan didn't dodge or evade. He催动 his blood energy, and a thread of Pure Yang True Qi infused, causing the dragon scale armor on his body to glow with faint golden light.

"Sss! Crack!"

The sound of the finger force penetrating the Qi armor and the sound of bone shattering rang out simultaneously.

Chu Cangming's pupils trembled violently. He instinctively glanced at his twisted finger. He could clearly feel that his sword finger had been shattered by the divine armor on Xu Yunfan's body.

"Eighth-grade Divine Weapon?!"

Chu Cangming's expression looked somewhat ugly. No wonder Bai Zhi had suffered a loss on this. His sword finger, covered in blood energy and萦绕 with force, possessed power no less than a strike from a divine weapon.

An eighth-grade divine weapon, even in the Dao Sect, was a divine weapon to suppress the sect. What qualification did Xu Yunfan have to gain the recognition of an eighth-grade divine weapon?!

Even though he had the dragon scale armor protecting his body, Xu Yunfan still felt a slight stifling in his chest from this sword finger strike. Immediately after, he revealed a slight smile.

In the instant he硬结 this sword finger, the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel in his hand had already completed an incredible turn.

The Ninth Form of the Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Cudgel Technique, in the posture of a hanging golden hook,斜撩 upwards from Chu Cangming's visual blind spot.

Where the cudgel's edge passed, Chu Cangming's hair-binding jade crown exploded into powder. A strand of black hair at his temple was ignited by the Pure Yang True Qi, burning with a faint blue flame in the air.
