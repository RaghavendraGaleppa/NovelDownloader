# Chapter 184: The Reason the Forbidden Land Was Pierced

"I find that hard to believe!" In the divine temple, the white-clad woman stood gracefully, her dark hair and the white ribbons on her slender waist gently swaying.

The scriptures on the wall held no secrets for her; she had pondered them for a long time but simply couldn't comprehend them.

Qin Ming was completely frank. "When I sparred with you just now, Senior, I used this scripture's principles to command all my techniques."

The white-clad woman was lost in thought. She knew better than anyone how difficult this scripture was to practice; even with her talent, she couldn't get started. This was a pit deliberately dug by that old wretch long ago. She had heard stories about it. Yet, the youth in coarse linen before her had already demonstrated it in actual combat. A complex expression crossed her stunning face beneath her dark hair.

"The Silk Scripture is indeed incredibly difficult to practice. I've been exposed to it since childhood, and it took me over ten years of practice just to get started," Qin Ming said, sounding deeply moved.

For some reason, the white-clad woman suddenly wanted to punch him. Upon reflection, she realized she had spent no less than a decade on it herself, yet she couldn't make any progress. Of course, she knew the dangers of this technique; practicing it to the end would cause one to explode with a bang. She merely refused to admit defeat and wanted to explore the earlier parts.

"How did you manage to master it?" the white-clad woman asked. Without an answer, her inner turmoil would remain.

"Only two words: arduous cultivation," Qin Ming replied earnestly.

The white-clad woman's demeanor became somewhat dangerous. This scripture could absolutely not be mastered by simply grinding away over time, and what was a mere decade or so anyway? Qin Ming, sensing her mood, quickly added, "There's another way to master it: by having a master guide you, helping to forge the path and establish the initial cultivation circulation route."

The white-clad woman looked at him. To open this path, she needed to take a master? What was he thinking! Moreover, she had heard such claims before. But she scoffed at the idea. If one couldn't master it oneself and needed others to guide the way, how could one ultimately reach the pinnacle?

"Senior, do you wish to study this method?" Qin Ming asked.

"Are you perhaps trying to make me your disciple?" The white-clad woman stared at him.

"Not at all," Qin Ming immediately shook his head. What kind of place was this divine temple? Probably only the patriarch of the Silk Scripture, knowing he was about to "explode," dared to act so freely here. He certainly didn't dare to court death at his current stage.

"This path isn't worth taking anyway!" The white-clad woman gave up. At the same time, she kindly reminded him that practicing it to the end would result in nothing, ultimately returning everything to heaven and earth. This scripture had very serious issues.

"Thank you for the warning, Senior," Qin Ming said, his eyes bright. He felt a certain confidence in his heart that he would ultimately be able to completely resolve this issue.

"You seem very confident, quite proud," the white-clad woman stepped forward, surprisingly mirroring Qin Ming's earlier eager gaze, and began to rub her fists together, preparing for a fight. Was she planning to retaliate? Qin Ming panicked. This senior expert was truly petty!

"My Lord, the tea has arrived." Just then, a black-robed figure appeared. Their voice was hoarse, making it impossible to tell if they were male or female. They had also emerged from that cool, clear moon, following the small path paved with bluestones into the night sky, and entered the main hall.

The white-clad woman stopped her steps, not approaching Qin Ming. "You have already passed the trial of life and death. Do you wish to challenge other paths? Those trials involve improving innate talent, extending life, the ultimate destination of the forbidden lands, and more. There will surely be something you desire," she asked.

Qin Ming thought for a moment, then refused. It was better to know when to stop; this place was not suitable for staying long. Because if someone hadn't come to deliver tea, he might have been pummeled!

The black-robed figure entered the main hall, carrying a tea tray. With a gentle wave of her hand, the entire temple instantly transformed. Spiderwebs on the walls vanished, bloodstains on the ground disappeared, and the old tree in the courtyard sprouted new branches and leaves. A faint, water-like glow flowed over, refreshing the creaking broken windows rattled by the night wind, and the cracked ground. Everything was renewed.

Even in the strange small town, many people were astonished to find the main hall of the divine temple glowing within the night mist, golden light piercing the night sky. Now, the entire magnificent temple was no longer dilapidated. Its gray tiles had turned a pale gold, and the place had become sacred. The vermillion pillars in the grand hall were carved with god-like creatures, white mist permeated the air, and the stone slabs on the ground accumulated moonlight, as if clear streams were flowing.

Qin Ming felt as if he were dreaming; everything was different. He had become an honored guest, and the characters on the wall still glowed, but no longer suppressed him. In the courtyard, the withered old tree stretched out its branches, extending into the temple. It bore lotus flowers, which transformed into a lotus platform, becoming his seat. At this moment, he sat cross-legged upon it, being served tea, while the white-clad woman sat opposite him.

Qin Ming noticed that the teacup presented by the black-robed figure was empty; there was no tea inside. With a wave of the white-clad woman's hand, wisps of fragrant smoke rose from the incense burner in front of the hazy statue deep within the main hall. They drifted in fine threads, finally flowing into their teacups.

"This is..." Qin Ming was stunned. Was this drinking tea or eating "fragrance"? He saw the white-clad woman drink first, and he followed suit. Instantly, Qin Ming felt his mind clear and serene, as if he were about to ascend into the heavens. His entire being felt purified.

"Excellent tea!" he exclaimed. Just based on this state, comprehending scriptures would yield twice the results with half the effort. Moreover, he looked at the wall and began to comprehend the scripture's meaning, his efficiency accelerating. For now, he dared not resonate with it, fearing his consciousness would collapse from the terrifying emotions of the patriarch.

The white-clad woman said, "Do you know the ingredients of that stick of incense in the bronze censer? It's a small, divine-patterned area from the tip of a North Sea Violet Gold Whale's horn, ground into powder, mixed with Tears of the Firmament from the depths of the Night Mist World, sap from the Immortal Tree in Kunling Ruins, and supplemented by..."

Qin Ming listened in a daze. Any single ingredient mentioned was priceless and rare in the world, yet they were made into incense for a bronze censer. This was simply too extravagant!

The white-clad woman sighed, "Someone else gifted it. A pity, that person died, and can no longer drink such fragrant mist tea."

"Isn't this it?" Qin Ming lowered his head, looking at the teacup in his hand.

"Just relit incense ash," the white-clad woman informed him.

Qin Ming immediately coughed. Was he eating ash?!

The white-clad woman glanced at him. "Although the fragrance of the tea is less than one percent of its original potency, I ask you: did it have any effect?"

"Many thanks, Senior!" Qin Ming returned to comprehending the scripture. He completely memorized the scripture and gained some new insights! This refined version could be cultivated to the complete Fourth Realm, but the Fifth Realm was only partially written before abruptly ending. Clearly, the patriarch believed it couldn't be continued beyond that point without great disaster.

Even so, Qin Ming felt it contained significantly more than what was recorded in his family's Silk Scripture. Because the Silk Scripture had once had a large portion torn away! Those patriarchs believed the latter half had major issues and would lead to death if practiced. If Qin Ming were to obtain his family's inherited Silk Scripture, he should be able to resonate with the complete version. This was why he couldn't forget it and wanted to retrieve it from the Cui family.

Afterward, Qin Ming began to cautiously probe, carefully attempting to resonate with the scripture on the wall, hoping to discover more valuable insights. Sure enough, his initial probe felt like being struck by lightning, his mind going blank. One could only say, that patriarch was truly terrifying!

"Oh?" The black-robed figure sensed something, revealing a look of surprise as they quietly watched him from a distance.

Next, Qin Ming threw caution to the wind. Each time he felt as if he'd been struck by heavenly lightning, he would recover for a long time before trying again. The white-clad woman also noticed his unusual behavior, quietly observing while drinking tea. She muttered, "Is this some demonic scripture? Others cultivate by entering tranquility and enlightenment, but you, practicing facing the wall, look as if it's costing you your life."

Qin Ming was exhausted and dizzy from the ordeal. He felt his sea of consciousness was about to explode. Finally, he managed to resonate with the scripture segment by segment. He sighed lightly. Unfortunately, the lingering emotions of the patriarch here only pertained to the original Fifth Realm portion, with no higher-level methods available. In fact, this was understandable. After all, the patriarch only intended to leave behind the refined version, so naturally, they wouldn't dwell on the original version too much. But he was content; this was enough for him to research for a long time. This way, he could calmly embark on his journey without rushing into danger to retrieve the Silk Scripture from the Cui family when his strength was insufficient.

At this time, in the strange small town, a group of people all believed that Li Wanqiu had died.

"I thought he was so formidable, a Young Patriarch, Pure Yang Light, but in the end, he's just a puddle of blood in the divine temple."

"It's useless no matter who goes in. I suspect if Cao Qianqiu entered, he'd turn into Cao Shiqiu or Cao Qianhuo, either missing his head or half his body."

"If you slander him like that, and he happens to find out where your true body is, even your sect will be pierced through!"

Only Wu Yaozu didn't believe his newly befriended friend had died and was still waiting. Someone tried to persuade him that there was no need to wait; that person had long since cooled down.

"Little Wu, let's make a bet. If I win, can I stay one night in your small courtyard?" The golden-haired elder, sitting atop a four-tusked white elephant, chuckled.

"Yes!" Wu Yaozu nodded.

"Count me in!" The golden-horned youth who had earlier offered to treat them also wanted to participate.

Wu Yaozu stroked his bushy beard. "I really don't believe my friend would die. What are your stakes? They need to satisfy me." He was somewhat displeased, feeling that the group's words were too ominous.

Inside the divine temple, the black-robed figure who served tea departed. Qin Ming suddenly noticed that the white-clad woman had become dangerous again. She hadn't calmed down yet and still wanted to beat him up!

"Senior, let me tell you, some people outside often speak ill of the divine temple. I think you should really rein them in. For instance, that Cao Qianqiu, who 'hates that heaven has no handle and earth has no ring'..." Qin Ming, sensing the situation was amiss, immediately redirected her attention. He felt that the white-clad woman had no killing intent; she simply wanted to vent her anger, believing she had been offended. He, a mere youth, couldn't endure such torment, but the group of old guys outside, whose origins were unknown, would be quite suitable.

The white-clad woman crossed her arms, resting her chin on her hand, and looked into the night mist. "That does make some sense. If I accidentally poke you with a finger, you'd just become a puddle of foul blood on the ground. That would be quite boring!"

***

In the strange small town, people saw Li Wanqiu emerge horizontally, his body hazy, enveloped in thick mist, flying back to his small courtyard. The group was petrified. He came out alive? Wu Yaozu was delighted. His newly befriended friend had indeed not died. Then he began rubbing his hands together at the people beside him.

"Little Wu, come back quickly!" Suddenly, he heard his grandmother's voice.

"Hurry up, where are the stakes? Bring them all over, quick!" Wu Yaozu eagerly urged.

***

Inside the divine temple, it was as if prosperity had withered, and all things returned to their true forms. There was no divine moon in the sky, nor a magnificent, grand temple. All that remained was a dilapidated, drafty, spiderweb-filled, dusty, decaying building, on the verge of collapse. The white-clad woman stood still, lost in thought.

The black-robed figure appeared again and said, "You, you are truly out of line. Why are you impersonating me again?" What was supposedly from the divine moon was merely emerging from the black mist. With Qin Ming's cultivation, he simply couldn't see through it.

"Little Wu is leaving. I think you should also travel far. You can't stay here any longer," the black-robed figure said to the white-clad woman.

"I still want to stay with you," the white-clad woman's mood was somewhat low.

"It's too dangerous. We still don't know what will ultimately happen to the Fourth Forbidden Land," the black-robed figure shook their head. They themselves were already dead, merely a fragmented consciousness lingering here.

"Who exactly pierced through the Fourth Forbidden Land?" the white-clad woman asked.

The black-robed figure said, "I don't know, but they are incredibly strong, unimaginably so. Other top-tier beings seeking godhood only need to subdue some special territories, but this person aims to subdue forbidden lands and refine all anomalous scenes. It's inconceivable!"

Either the Fourth Forbidden Land recovers and that person dies, or that person succeeds and the Fourth Forbidden Land dissipates.

The black-robed figure sighed, "The most terrifying thing is, I worry this person's target is all the forbidden lands of Kunling, and Kunling is a land of legends, with immense implications!"

"Child, you must leave," the black-robed figure said earnestly and solemnly.

"Alright!" The white-clad woman nodded. Then, she rubbed her fists together, preparing for a fight. This made the black-robed figure愣, who asked, "What are you going to do?"

"A group of spirit wanderers outside are being quite excessive. I'll beat them up with a divine mace!" The white-clad woman was annoyed, holding in a frustrated energy. Moreover, she had heard the discussions outside and, persuaded by Qin Ming, decided to change her target.

***

In the strange small town, a group of people murmured, "Is there something wrong with this divine temple? How was someone able to clear the trial just like that?"

In the dilapidated small courtyard, Wu Yaozu's grandmother appeared, extremely solemn. Looking at the two, she said, "If you leave in the morning, your physical body will disintegrate. If you leave at night, your soul will depart. Only at noon can you leave, when that moon is furthest from you. Prepare yourselves; I will personally see you out then!"
