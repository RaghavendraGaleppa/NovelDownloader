# Chapter 121: Summoning Arts

Lin Shan instructed his subordinates to clean up the battlefield and reclaim Red Shrimp Island, inheriting the Black and Red Twin Fiends' shrimp industry in the process. 

The two Foundation Establishment brothers had quite the lifestyle—they had actually dug a pond in one corner of the island specifically for shrimp farming. Lin Shan, with a professional eye, highly praised their aquaculture efforts. Instead of dismantling the pond's formations, he appointed two underlings to manage the farm for him. 

Even the smallest profit was still profit—who would complain about having more spirit stones?

Under Old Man Zhong's arrangements, some of the remaining cultivators stayed on Red Shrimp Island to spread their teachings, while others returned to their original territories across the sea to consolidate their faith. Lin Shan didn't need to worry about these matters. 

He flew back alone on his sword to the central Shrimp Barbarian Sea, returning to his cave abode on Shrimp Barbarian Island.

Upon his return, Lin Shan first opened the Black and Red Twin Fiends' storage pouches. The first thing he counted was the spirit stones. 

Combined, the two only had around two thousand spirit stones—even less than the rogue cultivator Monk Xing Tai from the Jiangdong region. They were truly a pair of poor brothers. 

Next were tens of thousands of red shrimp shells, likely gathered over the past five years through relentless exploitation. Though it was shameless to compete with Qi Refinement rogue cultivators for such low-level materials, accumulating them over time still amounted to a considerable sum. 

The rest were various mid and low-grade magical tools. The brothers had probably just broken through to the early Foundation Establishment stage and were still saving up for spirit stones—no wonder they had seized Red Shrimp Island to hoard resources. They were likely trying to gather enough funds for two high-grade magical tools. 

Finally, there were books on puppet summoning techniques, along with formulas and notes for the toxic green smoke they had used. 

Looking at the densely packed poison formulas and experimental notes, Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel at how well-suited these brothers were for research! 

But why develop toxic smoke without also researching an antidote? Hadn't they considered what would happen if they were exposed? 

The brothers, now on their way to the underworld, would have argued that they were well-versed in astronomy, geography, and wind patterns—they would never stand downwind when deploying their toxic smoke. Even ordinary breezes wouldn't trouble them. But who could have predicted Lin Shan would use an obscure wind-based spell like Hurricane Art? 

Lin Shan skimmed through the notes before tossing them aside. Without an antidote, what was the point of refining this stuff? What if he encountered a cultivator with even stronger wind-based spells? 

As for the puppet summoning manuals, however, he was quite intrigued. 

During their battle, the brothers had unleashed a flurry of flashy techniques—paper cranes coming to life, beans transforming into soldiers, jellyfish, fire crows—all of which Lin Shan had easily dispatched. 

But that was only because the Five Elements Fan was an exceptionally powerful magical tool. Had he used other methods, the fight would have been much more troublesome. 

---

The manuals contained many practical techniques, methods for crafting small puppets, instructions on summoning spiritual creatures, and even how to refine summoning artifacts. 

Lin Shan read with great interest. The paper cranes were the simplest—their power varied depending on the grade of talisman paper used, but they required quantity to be effective. 

The "Beans into Soldiers" technique had over a dozen refinement methods, each using different materials to create different types of bean soldiers. 

For example, the Black and Red Twin Fiends had used seeds of the Withered Vine, a mid-grade spiritual plant, to summon wood-attribute bean soldiers. According to the book, Withered Vines produced hundreds of seeds in a single fruiting. The brothers had likely chosen them for their affordability and ease of use. 

But if one used high-grade spiritual seeds—or even seeds from Golden Core-stage plant spirits—the resulting bean soldiers would form proper formations, their power far exceeding simple arithmetic. 

Lin Shan was instantly tempted. 

If he could find an ancient tree spirit that had lived for tens of thousands of years, harvest all its seeds, and refine them into bean soldiers, wouldn't he be practically invincible within his cultivation realm? 

But he quickly dismissed the thought. Plant spirits at that level would have Golden Core-stage strength. A single strike from one would be enough to finish him off—how could he possibly rob them of their offspring? That would be suicide. 

Lastly, there was a spiritual summoning art. Unlike puppet refinement, this was a proper spell, and the enhancement panel promptly appeared. 

**[Summoning Art]**  
Grade: High-Grade Spell  
Description: Forms a contract with creatures from known coordinates, allowing their temporary summoning. Requires a teleportation artifact as a conduit.  
(Note 1: Contracts can be voluntary or forced. Voluntary contracts impose no burden, while forced contracts increase soul strain.)  
(Note 2: The strength of forcibly contracted targets cannot exceed the summoner's by one major realm, or backlash will occur.)  
Enhancement Cost: 32 points  

Lin Shan rubbed his hands excitedly and began studying the Summoning Art in detail. 

At his current Foundation Establishment level, he could theoretically form summoning contracts with creatures up to Golden Core-stage strength—but he first needed to refine a so-called summoning artifact as a communication channel. 

He immediately recalled the banner the Black and Red Twin Fiends had used to summon the fire crows. After rummaging through their storage pouches, he found it. 

**[Summoning Banner]**  
Grade: Mid-Grade Artifact  
Description: Crafted from teleportation stone, used as a conduit for summoning creatures. Due to material and refinement limitations, can only summon Qi Refinement-stage beings.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

Now Lin Shan understood. When the brothers had obtained this inheritance, they had also acquired a rare teleportation stone from the cultivation world, which they used to create this summoning banner. 

However, as a mid-grade artifact, it could only summon Qi Refinement creatures. To summon Foundation Establishment beings, it would need to be refined into a high-grade artifact. 

But crafting such a high-grade artifact required a master artificer, along with a collection of high-grade spiritual materials. Even if he found a master artificer willing to do the work, not only would he have to hand over the exclusive refinement method for the summoning artifact, but the cost of refining a high-grade artifact was exorbitant. 

For rogue cultivators like the Black and Red Twin Fiends, managing to create a mid-grade summoning artifact was already impressive. 

But for Lin Shan, this wasn't a problem. With his enhancement panel, he could upgrade it to a treasure or even a spiritual treasure—as long as he had enough ancient charm. 

Still, he didn't rush to enhance it. First, he wanted to learn the summoning art and test its effectiveness. 

---

He spent half a month immersed in study. The summoning spell was profound and esoteric, and Lin Shan barely ate or slept as he pondered over it. Eventually, he managed to condense a small spell imprint in his soul. 

**[Summoning Art]**  
Grade: High-Grade Spell Imprint  
Description: Currently bound summoning creatures (None)  
Enhancement Cost: 32 points  

High-grade spells, once mastered, formed imprints in the soul, ensuring they were never forgotten—etched into memory permanently. 

With enough usage and deeper comprehension, the imprint could evolve into a spell seed, allowing instantaneous casting that couldn't be interrupted even under external pressure. 

As for divine abilities beyond that, they were far harder to comprehend, and forming divine ability seeds was even more challenging. 

Among Golden Core cultivators, a few might possess minor divine abilities like "Blazing Sky Inferno," but those who could condense divine ability seeds were exceedingly rare. 

After all, knowing how to use something and fully understanding it were two different things. 

It was like solving a math problem—you might know the formula and how to derive the answer, but understanding the underlying principles and the reasoning behind the formula was another matter entirely. 

But Lin Shan's enhancement panel was different. Based on past experience, enhancing something would always elevate it to the peak of the next tier. 

If he enhanced the summoning spell imprint now, he might very well obtain a minor divine ability seed! 

Lin Shan suppressed the urge to enhance it. With 40 points of ancient charm, he needed to save them for breaking through his early Foundation Establishment bottleneck. He wasn't a genius—without breakthrough pills, his cultivation progress would be severely delayed. 

Moreover, if he encountered danger before then, he might need to enhance something on the spot to save his life. 

For now, since he had already mastered the basics of the Summoning Art, he could test its effects. 

Lin Shan took out the mid-grade Summoning Banner and activated the spell. Instantly, his consciousness entered the depths of the banner and expanded outward, covering an area of about ten miles around him. 

According to the summoning art's description, his current coordinates corresponded to his physical location on Shrimp Barbarian Island. 

His consciousness had expanded fiftyfold, but the ten-mile radius wasn't crystal clear—he could only vaguely sense the consciousnesses of beings weaker than himself within that range. 

In this area, the northern region contained tens of thousands of green dots, densely clustered. Based on the direction, this was likely the island's mortal fishing village, with the green dots representing ordinary fishermen. 

To the west were about a thousand gray dots. Focusing his consciousness there, Lin Shan could faintly sense the soul consciousnesses of seagulls. Their gray hue likely indicated their dim-witted, unenlightened state. 

Lin Shan decided to test the waters by attempting to summon these seagulls. 

To his surprise, it worked smoothly. The seagulls were ordinary birds with no cultivation base, so the summoning contracts formed effortlessly. 

"Chirp chirp chirp—" 

A vortex appeared beside his physical body in the cave abode, accompanied by the sound of birds. The vortex spun faster, and dozens of seagulls came flapping out! 

Lin Shan opened his eyes, his consciousness returning to his body. The cave was now filled with seagulls flapping wildly in the cramped space, leaving droppings and feathers everywhere. He quickly shooed them all out. 

"Cough cough!" 

Lin Shan coughed as he dissolved the contracts with the seagulls. What use were these things? 

After using a Wind Control Spell to clear out the feathers and droppings, the cave still reeked. He decided to leave, flying on his sword to the island's edge and settling on a reef. 

The sea breeze was refreshing. Sitting cross-legged, Lin Shan resumed his search for nearby creatures. 

This time, half of the ten-mile radius was ocean. Deep underwater, he detected a cluster of white dots—shrimp-like demon beasts. He immediately attempted to form contracts. 

This time, he met resistance. These demon beasts had cultivation bases and fiercely resisted his spiritual intrusion, refusing to form summoning contracts. 

But this only made Lin Shan more determined. The more they resisted, the more excited he became! 

In the end, his Foundation Establishment-level spiritual sense overpowered theirs, and they were forcibly bound to the contracts. 

The Summoning Banner in his hand swirled with a blue vortex, and dozens of white shrimp demon beasts plopped out. 

Lin Shan recognized them instantly—these were a specialty of the Shrimp Barbarian Sea, similar to the red shrimp from Red Shrimp Island, with shells that had medicinal value. 

Watching the little creatures wave their pincers in protest, Lin Shan sighed. 

What was the point of binding contracts with these things? Aside from their shells being useful as materials, they had zero combat power—they were practically free meals! 

Imagine summoning a bunch of shrimp mid-battle and telling his opponent: 

"Brother, let's call it quits—I'll give you some shrimp as a peace offering!" 

The opponent would probably kill him first, then enjoy a feast of "spicy shrimp," "steamed shrimp," "braised shrimp," or "salt-and-pepper shrimp." 

Thinking this, Lin Shan realized he might as well keep the contracts active—these could serve as ingredients! 

In fact, the Black and Red Twin Fiends had already thought of this. As rogue cultivators who had reached Foundation Establishment, they had funded their Foundation Establishment Pills by selling summoned seafood. 

Otherwise, how could rogue cultivators survive and advance in the resource-scarce islands of the East Sea, where the deep ocean was fraught with danger? They must have had some kind of opportunity. 

It was just that the brothers had focused theirs entirely on aquaculture—hence why they had hidden in the remote Red Shrimp Island for five years. 

---

Lin Shan sat on the reef for an entire day, binding contracts with all sorts of random sea creatures—scallops, conches, crabs, sea urchins, razor clams—only to find that none of them were useful in battle! 

They were all just food! 

Was the Summoning Art just a way to find seafood? 

Lin Shan was deeply disappointed. While Qi Refinement seafood might be a novelty inland, what he needed was combat power—even something like the jellyfish the Black and Red Twin Fiends had summoned would have been better. 

But then it occurred to him—if any living creature could be summoned, did that include... people?
