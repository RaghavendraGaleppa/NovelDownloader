# Lurking as an Asset in the Primal Demonic Sect

## Chapter 34: Three Rivers' Recruitment, Foundation Establishment Opportunity

Outside the cave abode, with Lu Yang's breakthrough, information regarding him quickly landed on the desks of interested parties. His origins and background were thoroughly investigated.

And, just as Lu Yang had predicted, his background could be described in four words: impeccably demonic lineage.

A new disciple recruited by the Sacred Sect each year, formally inducted after killing a senior sister in the Joyful Union Palace, then profiting immensely from the trade of substitute Yin puppets, after which he immediately entered secluded cultivation.

"He's an ascetic cultivator," a female cultivator with a charming face but a hint of sternness, her gaze sharp and resolute, couldn't help but exclaim as she looked at the materials on the table. This cultivator was also at the late-stage of Qi Condensation, but compared to the newly breakthrough Lu Yang, her cultivation had reached the ninth level of Qi Condensation, only a step away from the tenth level of Perfection!

The female cultivator was named Feixia, and she held considerable renown within the Sacred Sect. This was not only due to her beauty but also because she was one of the Sacred Sect's rare Talisman Masters, having even earned the appreciation of a Sacred Sect Elder through her talisman crafting skills.

"An ascetic cultivator alone wouldn't reach late-stage Qi Condensation," a scholarly young man with a feather fan and silk scarf, standing beside Fairy Feixia, smiled faintly. "He clearly earned a large sum from dealing in substitute Yin puppets, yet he didn't flaunt it."

"This shows he's also a cautious and intelligent person."

"That's normal, it's to be expected," Fairy Feixia sighed upon hearing this. "For ordinary disciples like us to make a name for ourselves, talent, caution, intelligence, courage... none of these can be lacking."

"So, it's decided?" the young man asked.

Fairy Feixia nodded. "I'll recommend him. This person broke through to late-stage Qi Condensation in just ten short years. My Three Rivers Society is in great need of such talent."

Inside his cave abode, Lu Yang sat cross-legged on a meditation mat.

Before him, more than a dozen talismans were neatly laid out. Each one was an olive branch, stating that as long as he was willing to join their faction, a grand gift would immediately be presented, including but not limited to cultivation partners, cultivation techniques, divine abilities, treasures, pills... truly everything imaginable.

*I didn't pay attention in my previous life, but I didn't expect the Sacred Sect to have so many factions,* Lu Yang thought.

Basically, anyone with late-stage Qi Condensation cultivation could gather a decent-sized team in the Sacred Sect, just like Liu Xin in his second-to-last life. Lu Yang wasn't surprised by this. After all, a sect without factions was a strange sect. The Sacred Sect was vast; it was impossible for everyone to be of one mind. They would naturally band together for their respective interests.

Of course, those minor factions were rootless duckweeds, without true foundation. Those with the genuine backing to recruit him were factions established by some Sacred Sect Elders, or even True Disciples. The conditions they offered were also relatively more reliable and trustworthy.

But that was all.

"I still overestimated myself." Lu Yang shook his head. The terms offered by those major factions were indeed good, often involving tens of thousands of contribution points. However, he was precisely not short on money. After all, he hadn't even spent all the contribution points he earned from dealing in substitute Yin puppets.

Compared to money, what he lacked was "privilege"—the privilege to truly access the middle echelons of the Sacred Sect and purchase things that couldn't normally be bought.

As Lu Yang pondered, suddenly, the array outside his door vibrated.

Lu Yang looked up in response, only to see the illumination array he had set up in front of his cave abode shining brightly, its brilliant light revealing an exquisite and graceful figure. It was none other than Fairy Feixia.

"Junior Brother Lu, you also understand array formations?" Fairy Feixia looked at the array patterns emerging around them with surprise, a hint of unexpected delight appearing on her pretty face.

Lu Yang cupped his hands. "Senior Sister, may I ask what brings you here?"

Fairy Feixia did not act coy, responding with a graceful bow. "I am Feixia, an External Affairs Elder of the Sacred Sect's Three Rivers Society. I've come here for you, Junior Brother."

"Oh? Senior Sister, please come in." Lu Yang quickly invited her, his mind becoming active. The Three Rivers Society—wasn't that the faction behind Zhao Xuhe? They actually came to recruit him?

Lu Yang didn't know much about the Three Rivers Society, but he knew Zhao Xuhe was a member. More importantly, as a disciple of the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, Zhao Xuhe seemed to only be in the middle-to-lower ranks of the Three Rivers Society. From this alone, one could see the caliber of the Three Rivers Society.

"Please forgive my ignorance, Senior Sister. I'm afraid I don't know much about the Three Rivers Society...?" Lu Yang asked cautiously. Fairy Feixia wasn't surprised by his question and smiled, saying, "The Three Rivers Society was founded by three True Disciple Senior Brothers."

"Among them, our First Senior Brother is already a Foundation Establishment True Person, having opened a peak in the Cloud Sea."

"While Second Senior Brother and Third Senior Brother haven't yet reached Foundation Establishment, they have both cultivated Third-Grade True Qi and are at the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation, capable of breaking through to Foundation Establishment at any time."

"I heard that Junior Brother Lu is also from an ordinary disciple background. You should understand the difficulties ordinary disciples face in their early stages. Our three Senior Brothers, like us ordinary disciples, came from humble beginnings. Therefore, after achieving great success in cultivation, they established the Three Rivers Society with the aim of helping ordinary disciples overcome early difficulties."

"I see." Lu Yang said with a look of admiration, "The three Senior Brothers are truly virtuous."

*Pah!*

If it weren't for having borrowed money from their Three Rivers Society in his previous lives and personally witnessed their 36% annual interest rate, he would have almost believed that nonsense.

Lu Yang inwardly scoffed. He was not one to act without seeing clear benefits, so he naturally wouldn't make a hasty decision just because Fairy Feixia said so. He cautiously asked, "I am honored to be invited to become a member of the Three Rivers Society. I just don't know what the benefits are?"

"You can rest assured on that point, Junior Brother." Fairy Feixia said frankly, "As long as Junior Brother is willing to join, I can immediately decide to bestow upon you a True Disciple-level divine ability secret art."

"After joining, you will receive a sum of contribution points as tribute each year."

"Moreover, if Junior Brother has money, you can also use the society's True Disciple privileges to purchase desired items, and even ask the three Senior Brothers for guidance in cultivation."

"Of course, there are also requirements."

At this point, Fairy Feixia took out a jade slip and placed it in front of Lu Yang. "All new members must sign a contract and leave behind a drop of essence blood..."

"That's simple." Lu Yang glanced at the contract before him. It was nothing more than the standard clauses found in most factions, such as confidentiality obligations. Perhaps some might feel that doing so would mean losing their freedom and being constrained in many matters, but Lu Yang didn't care at all. He casually waved his hand and signed his name.

It was just a matter for this life; it wouldn't affect his next life. Lu Yang even wished the constraints were greater, as that would make him more likely to be considered an insider and receive even better resources.

Seeing Lu Yang's straightforwardness, Fairy Feixia nodded with satisfaction.

"Next, Junior Brother just needs to take out your Sacred Sect disciple token, and I will set up a restriction for you. From then on, your token will be usable within the society."

"Thank you for your trouble, Senior Sister."

Lu Yang took out his token. Fairy Feixia performed a hand seal and struck a talisman seal into it, upon which a completely new section immediately appeared on the token.

"Talisman crafting..." Lu Yang's eyes lit up. He could now be considered a Ninth-Rank Array Master. Though he didn't understand talismans, he could grasp a bit of their essence through his knowledge of arrays. In his opinion, a talisman was simply a simplified, temporary small array.

*Good stuff, I want to learn.*

The next second, looking at this display of talisman crafting, Lu Yang finally remembered who this Fairy Feixia was. He had heard of her in his second-to-last life.

*She's Zhao Xuhe's cultivation partner...* Lu Yang mused. *In my second-to-last life, when I was studying array formations, I heard that she and Zhao Xuhe became cultivation partners. Both were at Qi Condensation Perfection and shone brilliantly on the battlefields of the Righteous and Demonic Factions. They even attempted to break through to Foundation Establishment together, but unfortunately, both met their end after failing...*

Thinking of this, Lu Yang's eyes suddenly gleamed. The important point wasn't that they perished after failing to establish their foundations, but that they actually had the opportunity to attempt Foundation Establishment—behind this was undoubtedly a Foundation Establishment opportunity!
