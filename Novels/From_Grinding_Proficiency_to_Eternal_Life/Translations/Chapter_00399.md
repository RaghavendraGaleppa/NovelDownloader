# Chapter 399: The Beginning of True武 Swallowing Demons Scripture

As the ripples swept through his meridians, the True武 Swallowing Demons True Qi resonated in unison like soldiers under inspection. The sound resembled the lingering chime of an ancient bell, echoing through his bones like rolling thunder.

*'True武 Swallowing Demons Scripture has reached the入门 (Initial Success) stage.'*
*'You have successfully converted True Qi into True Essence.'*
*'Your body is currently reshaping its meridian system.'*
*'...'*

Xu Yunfan let out a breath as he glanced at the series of notifications on his attribute panel. He looked closer at the Skill column. Now that True武 Swallowing Demons Scripture had reached Initial Success, the list of traits below numbered in the hundreds, with over thirty of them being Golden Legend-tier descriptors.

"So this is what 'Swallowing Demons' truly means... I thought it meant absorbing another's True Essence. It should be that after suppressing the demon, one swallows and refines it, seizing the opponent's cultivation."

While digesting the cultivation memories that had flooded his mind upon reaching Initial Success, Xu Yunfan suddenly realized this.

Ordinary cultivation methods draw from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, but this scripture uses武道 (Martial Dao) will as a furnace. It tempers True Qi into True Essence through repeated refinement.

The newborn True Essence contains a majestic, heaven-like authority. Every move and stance carries the means to suppress demons with thunderous force. By continuously swallowing demons and throwing them into the True武 Great Millstone to be refined, one nourishes oneself.

Just like Zhong Kui swallowing ghosts, this is the principle.

If an evil spirit were to invade his meridians right now, it would likely be crushed by the武道 True Intent lurking within the True Essence in a single encounter.

Xu Yunfan lightly flicked a finger. A wisp of True Essence left his body and solidified within three inches.

Looking closely, the True Essence contained countless fine, dark golden threads interwoven and flowing. They entangled each other, faintly forming the shape of a True武 Demon Suppressor.

This was the "True武 Swallowing Demons True Essence" recorded in the *True武 Swallowing Demons Scripture*.

Ordinary cultivators needed ten years of bitter effort to condense True Essence of this quality. Relying on his Martial Dao foundation and the mystique of the scripture, Xu Yunfan had achieved it in just three days.

Hmm, everything was due to his diligence and hard work; the attribute panel was merely an aid...

True武 Swallowing Demons Scripture was vastly different from other cultivation methods. Its essence lay not in complex spells and incantations, but in the perfect fusion of武道 fist and foot techniques with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

What the scripture recorded was not magic in the traditional sense, but a path of attack and conquest using武 to enter the Dao.

Take the sword for example. With a mere lift of the hand or movement of the foot, the True Essence within the body could spontaneously condense into a three-foot Sword Aura.

Without the need to form seals or chant spells, simply using a fist or palm in a sword stance could draw upon the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to transform it into a majestic Sword Qi. Its锋芒 (sharpness) was so intense it could cut through gold and jade.

If cultivated to a profound level, one could even evolve a Sword Intent containing heavenly authority, such as the "Nine Heavens Thunder Strike Sword."

Even the most basic straight punch, when the scripture is activated, would form a triple overlapping force.

The first layer is like a hammer striking the surface, the second is like a wave surging against the internal organs, and the third directly shakes the opponent's meridians. This is the subtlety described in the scripture as "One punch, three forces; hitting a cow through a mountain."

Exhaling creates a sword; inhaling forms a shield.

Between a single breath, an offensive and defensive system is formed. When cultivated to perfection, it can even form a "Dragon Roar and Tiger Howl" sound wave attack, shattering the structure of an opponent's spells.

Although these attack methods lack the flashiness of traditional magic, they excel in being launched instantly and without warning.

What was even more terrifying was that all attacks carried the "Swallowing Demons" trait. Whenever an opponent's defense was broken, it would automatically swallow a portion of the dissipated spiritual energy to nourish oneself, forming a terrifying cycle of growing stronger the more one fought.

Just as the general outline of the scripture stated: "Using the Martial to carry the Dao; every move and stance is heavenly authority. Swallowing demons to refine the true; the space of an inch is the battlefield."

"Interesting..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered as he pondered silently.

"It bears some resemblance to the Dragon and Tiger Pill Qi of the Xuanzhen Sect. If I condense a True武 Dharma Form later, I will naturally tread on dragon and snake, with a White Tiger accompanying me, transforming into a True武 traveling..."

Moreover, the most important thing was that this True武 Swallowing Demons Scripture had immense potential. It definitely did not stop merely at the Foundation Establishment realm. He wondered just how the Divine武 True Person had cultivated. Why had he remained stuck in the Foundation Establishment realm for so many years, even having to go through five cycles of reincarnation just to attempt Foundation Establishment again?

A night of comprehension passed in the blink of an eye.

When the morning mist had yet to disperse, a sweet, cloying fragrance suddenly drifted into the courtyard outside.

The thorny vines entwined on the bamboo fence moved without wind, actually blooming with妖异 (demonic) purple-red flowers.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. He quickly retracted his True Essence, suppressing his internal aura with the True武 Demon Suppression Seal to make himself look like he had just entered the Qi Condensation stage. The武道 Heavenly Eye on his forehead opened and closed slightly before shutting rapidly.

Since the opponent was a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, there was no need to worry too much.

"Junior Brother Xu is so heartless..."

A voice laden with hooks pierced through the door panels. "Making Senior Sister wait in the cold dew for half an hour."

With a creaking sound, a woman in crimson leaned against the doorframe, smiling.

Her skirt was semi-transparent, and snow-white skin was adorned with曼陀罗 (mandala) patterns drawn with cinnabar. A dot of vermilion on her forehead looked like a dripping coral. The most captivating was her eyes; her left pupil was actually heart-shaped, and as they流转 (flowed), they seemed to contain粉雾 (pink mist).

Xu Yunfan's muscles tensed slightly. This woman walked without touching the dust, her True Essence control delicate. Given time, she was a talent capable of entering late-stage Qi Condensation.

He stood up and asked politely, "May I ask who Senior Sister is..."

The woman's gaze was as sticky as honey as it clung to Xu Yunfan. As he stood up, the outline of his broad shoulders and narrow waist cast a highly oppressive silhouette in the morning light.

The bulging trapezius muscles pushed the fabric into mountain-like curves. The pectoral muscles rising and falling with his breath勾勒 (outlined) a distinct groove under the thin cloth, while the lines at his waist and abdomen were taut like a drawn bow, filled with the sense of power ready to be unleashed.

She unconsciously licked her vermilion lips with the tip of her tongue. Ripples of pink mist appeared in her heart-shaped pupils, and even the silver chains wrapped around her ankles trembled slightly with her急促 (rapid) breathing.

"Hua Xiangrong."

The woman's eyes looked as if they were pulling threads. She stumbled towards Xu Yunfan, her jade finger sliding across his chest and lightly tapping on his heart position. "I heard that Junior Brother just received the Meridian Opening Pill. Senior Sister is here specifically to... guide you."

Before the trailing sound faded, Xu Yunfan felt something foreign trying to钻入 (drill into) his meridians. He looked down to see three nearly transparent silk threads extending from the opponent's fingertips.

*Damn these women!*

Xu Yunfan cursed inwardly. The opponent looked as if she were mesmerized by him, but in reality, she was trying every means to probe him.

Xu Yunfan pretended to panic and retreat, deliberately making his True Essence run sluggish.

Hua Xiangrong took the bait as expected. The heart-shaped pupil flashed with disdain, and the silk attack intensified abruptly.

Just as they were about to pierce his Qi Sea, the meat lump on the Chong Meridian suddenly wriggled, swallowing the invading True Qi completely.

This was a means to suppress demons; if it went a step further, it would be swallowing demons.

"Eh?"

Hua Xiangrong retracted her hand as if electrocuted, the cinnabar patterns glowing slightly. "Junior Brother's meridians are quite special."

"Not as exquisite as Senior Sister's Thousand Affection Threads."

Xu Yunfan wiped the cold sweat from his forehead... which was, of course, an act.

The Thousand Affection Threads looked like they didn't cause much damage, but they were actually soft hooks. When the threads touched the vital points of the meridians, the victim would first feel an itch like ants crawling, followed by their internal organs feeling as if they were soaking in warm soup.

In less than three breaths, illusions would swarm before one's eyes. They could be the初恋 (first love) of youth or the obsession of unrequited love, all transforming into vivid illusions.

Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, if their Dao Heart had even the slightest crack, would gradually lose clarity under the缠绕 (entanglement) of the affection threads, eventually becoming a desire slave of the caster.
