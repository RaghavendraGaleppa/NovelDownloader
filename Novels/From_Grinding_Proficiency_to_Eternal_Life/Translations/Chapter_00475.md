# Chapter 475: Yours is Mine, and Mine is Still Mine

Han Shi’s heart eased slightly. It seemed the other party couldn’t detect his thoughts.

“The affairs in the Divine Martial Realm are settled. I still have important matters in the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, so the matter of the Origin Qi will be put aside for now. Since you chose the name Han Shi, continue using that identity and cultivate diligently.”

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan’s tone carried a hint of a smile.

“‘Subordinate’? We are fellow Daoists, fellow Daoists.”

Xu Yunfan sighed. “I must ask for your patience, fellow Daoist. If I can break through my shackles in the future, I will surely grant you your freedom.”

Making empty promises was easy; he could just say the words now. Whether he would actually follow through was another matter entirely. Xu Yunfan was quite familiar with this tactic. In his previous life, he had been fed many such promises by his superiors.

Now that he was in charge, he finally understood why leaders loved to make empty promises.

It required no investment. Just a few words, and he might gain a loyal, hardworking slave who required little pay.

“I wouldn’t dare. This subordinate understands!”

Han Shi kowtowed in his heart. “I will not fail your trust! I will root myself here and wait quietly for the Master’s great technique to be completed before you return!”

Xu Yunfan’s voice didn’t sound again, vanishing like the receding tide.

The will of Xu Yunfan completely faded, leaving Han Shi in the cold, damp alley, gasping with lingering fear.

Cold sweat had already soaked his inner garments, bringing a deeper chill. He leaned against the cold wall and slowly closed his eyes, suppressing the churning fear into the deepest layer of his soul.

It was a long while before he opened his eyes again.

An oil lamp was lit on the street outside the alley. A dim, yellow light spread a faint, blurry glow on the damp bluestone slabs. The flickering, dim light reflected the lingering paleness on his face and also revealed the depths of his eyes, hidden in the shadows like a cold, dark pool. A faint but extremely dangerous light flashed past and vanished.

*The main body… are you too confident?*

*Confident that this controlled clone would be willing to forever be the dust under your feet?*

*Ready to be replaced by you at any moment?*

Han Shi slowly extended his hand, his fingertips touching the cold, rough wall. His fingernail scratched a very faint white mark.

An extremely weak, almost imperceptible suction force quietly spread out from his fingertips. A hard-shelled beetle, crawling on the wall and stained with oil, suddenly stiffened. The faint vitality within its body was instantly drained, turning into a wisp of insignificant gray-black aura that融入 Han Shi’s fingertip and vanished without a trace.

The stimulation from that tiny bit of vitality was like a spark falling into a deep ocean of oil. Thoughts churned and slammed against the solid ice of his consciousness, emitting a low rumble. He opened his mouth silently, the corners of his lips pulling up into a bone-chilling arc.

The Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art naturally draws upon the momentum of a thousand chariots, transforming the self into a tool. Although the Sword Embryo was still in its gestation phase, its initial divine effects were already showing.

Heavy, dark mist enveloped the peak of an unnamed cliff in the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm. The strong winds swept over the jagged, strange rocks, wailing like weeping.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on a smooth, black boulder. His figure was half-hidden and half-revealed within the chaotic blend of diffuse spiritual mist and night.

The spotless Li Fire Robe he wore had an intricate Spirit Gathering Array on it, which was constantly gathering, filtering the ambient spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and then transforming it into pure spiritual energy to be absorbed into his body. With a single rotation of his True Martial Power, it was completely refined.

When he opened his eyes, there was no trace of anger in the depths of his pupils, only a bottomless, heart-freezing indifference.

Of course, this was the aftereffect of him entering the Lin State for several nights. If time were pushed back a bit, his eyes would have been like a thick, un-dissolvable cold aura.

His gaze shifted, looking at the attribute panel above his vision.

In the Skills column, next to the Cloud Cabinet Avatar refined from the *Xuandu Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Cabinet*, a crimson "Control" character had quietly appeared, floating above this golden entry.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes narrowed slightly. The moment his divine sense lightly touched this word, the various thoughts churning in Han Shi’s heart poured in like a flood bursting through a dike.

He raised his eyebrows slightly. This "Control" character could actually probe the clone’s emotions.

Han Shi’s pathological longing for freedom, his crazy plans to counter-devour the main body, and the nearly tangible, twisted hatred hidden beneath his humble exterior.

*This is a bit interesting,* Xu Yunfan’s eyes flashed with a cold light.

*Damn it. If it were anyone else who cultivated this top-tier forging method and saw the Cloud Cabinet Avatar Technique inside, they would practice it without hesitation. After all, personally forging artifacts could add many trump cards to themselves. Some life-saving treasures naturally couldn’t be shown easily.*

*And to advance further, according to the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi to forge a true Spirit Treasure, one naturally needs to cultivate the Cloud Cabinet Avatar Technique to assist.*

*Master and servant, main and clone—one civil, one fiery—advancing each other, can success be achieved.*

*However, once this clone is created, if one is not careful, they will be devoured by the clone and die.*

*It’s practically a huge pitfall.*

*Who knows which bastard threw this out to harm people.*

*If it weren’t for his attribute panel’s strong control, he might have really fallen into a big trap.*

A cold smile curled at the corner of Xu Yunfan’s mouth.

Through the connection of the Cloud Cabinet Avatar, he clearly saw Han Shi clenching his fist in the dark alley, heard the sound of the ambition boiling in that shell, pounding against the ribs, like the grating sound of a caged beast gnawing on the iron bars.

*“A bit interesting…”*

This Cloud Cabinet Avatar was almost a completely independent personality, and its moods and emotions were mostly dark and negative. Even its inner seven emotions and six desires were completely chaotic and evil.

But the other party was indeed a genius with terrifying comprehension.

In just a few days, he had already comprehended the入门 of the Myriad Chariots Sword Art and began to gestate the Sword Embryo.

If it were Xu Yunfan himself, it would probably take several years to reach the入门 stage with the help of the attribute panel…

*“Is this really my own clone?”*

Xu Yunfan felt a bit suspicious. He glanced at the information on the attribute panel and then muttered to himself, *“Luckily, I can unilaterally share the insights.”*

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred.借助 the attribute panel’s absolute control over the Cloud Cabinet Avatar, he unilaterally seized Han Shi’s comprehension and cultivation insights into the *Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art*.

The profound sword principles flowed into his sea of consciousness like a trickling stream. Although it wasn’t obtained through his own bitter cultivation, under the panel’s transformation, it turned into usable experience.

*The clone’s things are mine.*

*To be reasonable, this is all due to my heaven-defying comprehension.*

His gaze swept over the progress bar for the *Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art* comprehension, which was growing synchronously next to the "Control" character on the panel. The indifference in the depths of his eyes, left over by the Lin State, faded a little.

*My humanity has finally returned!*

Sensing the seven emotions and six desires constantly bursting forth from his extremely powerful physique within his Dharmic Body, Xu Yunfan finally let out a long breath.

The physical body is the ship, and the soul resides within it.

Neither body nor spirit can be lacking.

*“First, return to Cold Crow Pass.”*

The thought was set. A flash of light, and Xu Yunfan’s figure disappeared beneath the heavens.
