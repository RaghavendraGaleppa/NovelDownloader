# Chapter 283: Settling Down, Natural Charm, Another Treasure, and the Unrivaled Candle Cult

Li Xian practiced the rare art of organ refinement. By chance, he had obtained the "Five Organs Avoiding Turbid Yang Meridian Scripture," a truly rare opportunity. His five organs shimmered with a faint, verdant light, and his breath was long and steady.

Perfect organs brought boundless benefits. His resistance to cold and poison, his ability to dive underwater, his strength, and his recovery were all significantly enhanced. His essence and blood were nourished, and his vital energy was abundant.

\[You have refined the organ turbidity, Proficiency +1\]

Nangong Liuli, who originally had trouble sleeping, suddenly felt something unusual. She saw Li Xian moving in rhythm with his breathing, his long hair slightly floating, and a red light flickering between his brows.

Nangong Liuli said, "It's an internal cultivation technique? Such martial arts are extremely rare. For a commoner like him to possess such a technique, he must have had a fortuitous encounter. Now that we are in the same boat, the stronger he is, the safer I am." She did not disturb him. However, seeing the many mystical phenomena around Li Xian, which were worth studying, she quietly observed.

It turned out...

Refining the organs' turbidity was a form of internal body training. Li Xian possessed the "Perfect Physique," which made his martial arts display even more extraordinary scenes. When practicing the "Five Organs Avoiding Turbid Yang Meridian Scripture," the internal training's phenomena actually shone through his body.

On another side.

Hao Qingshe returned in defeat, secretly furious. However, remembering Shi Feifei's serious threats, she was genuinely intimidated. Therefore, she did not make another move to kill.

The northern part of the island was teeming with venomous snakes and insects. Hao Qingshe disliked the Flower Cage Sect, but she chose to live in the Water Jar precisely because of the area's unique terrain, which produced strange and venomous creatures that were of great help to her.

Zeng Xiaoke said, "Master... do you really want me to fight that person after my injuries heal?"

Hao Qingshe cast a cold glance at her. Her skin was fair, her seductive eyes curved, hiding a bewitching and demonic charm, mixed with the coldness of a viper. She scrutinized this disciple. She had many disciples, each taught a unique martial art to cultivate poison techniques. Since poison arts could harm both the enemy and oneself, Hao Qingshe had to observe her disciples' performance in their poison arts before deciding whether to cultivate them herself. She had a sharp eye and knew that the little thief had some strange method to neutralize potent poisons. Zeng Xiaoke would surely lose. If she lost again, Hao Qingshe would lose face and be ridiculed by Yan Hao and the others.

She cared about her reputation, yet she didn't. Suddenly, she thought of something and said with a charming smile, "Can you win?"

Zeng Xiaoke said, "I will practice diligently and will not fail your expectations, Master."

Hao Qingshe said, "Good disciple... then come here."

Zeng Xiaoke was originally very afraid of Hao Qingshe, but seeing her stand up for her today, her gratitude surged, and her fear diminished significantly. Respect arose naturally. She immediately took a few steps forward and knelt on one knee, asking, "What are your instructions, Master?"

Hao Qingshe said, "The matter of the duel will be left to your Senior Sister. Right now, I have something more important that I need your help with."

Zeng Xiaoke said, "Please speak, Master. I will do my utmost to help."

Hao Qingshe smiled. "It wasn't a big deal originally, just to borrow your skin."

Zeng Xiaoke said strangely, "Skin... this thing...咳咳!" As she spoke, two缕 black smoke shot into Zeng Xiaoke's nostrils. The gas was extremely foul, causing her to cough violently. Her face immediately flushed red, and she felt a burning sensation from her throat downwards.

She convulsed in pain, realizing Hao Qingshe was up to no good. She grabbed her master's skirt, begging for her life. Hao Qingshe looked at her with a smile, her palm pushing out lightly, and a delicate internal energy pushed her tumbling away.

Zeng Xiaoke's whole body convulsed, her eyes rolled back, and she was done for... Suddenly, with a "噗嗤" sound, blood sprayed from her eye sockets, splashing several yards high. Brown liquid gushed from her ears, nostrils... and all the orifices on her face.

Her body gradually shrank, her bones and internal organs corroded by the poisonous gas, turning into a brown sludge that flowed out from all her body's orifices.

Only a skin shell remained. Hao Qingshe was ruthless and acted erratically. She had no real "master-disciple" affection. Thinking of one thing and doing another was her code of conduct.

She hung the skin shell up. Below it, she placed a "vinegar jar." Under the jar, she placed "charcoal fire," boiling the vinegar so its steam rose and熏染 the skin shell, keeping it moist, soft, and flexible enough to wear.

Hao Qingshe laughed. "I'll have your Senior Sister represent you. She'll win easily."

The next day.

The sky was as clear as washed, with thousands of suns and no clouds. A fine season and climate. After Li Xian paid the rent, he had no money left. He led Nangong Liuli to the West Ox Street in the town.

He pushed open the door...

The courtyard was overgrown with green grass, appearing dilapidated and dirty. Nangong Liuli frowned slightly, but she had no choice. Li Xian, holding the Sinking River Sword, cut down the weeds in the outer courtyard. On the way, he killed snakes and eradicated rat nests.

He cleared a place to stay. Knowing Nangong Liuli's difficulties, Li Xian first cleaned a stone bench and placed it in the open space of the courtyard, allowing her to sit and rest.

Nangong Liuli wore exquisite jade shoes. Her every step was full of graceful beauty. She endured the constraints of her clothing and sat properly on the stone bench. She breathed gently and slowly adapted, watching Li Xian work.

Her red lips were lightly pressed... She didn't know when this torment would end.

After the weeds were all cut, their roots remained in the soil. Li Xian used the "Weed Pulling" skill. He reached out and stroked, his force was巧妙, pulling out the weeds along with their roots from the soil.

\[Proficiency +1\]
\[Proficiency +1\]

Li Xian suddenly smiled, remembering that when he was a servant, the "Weed Pulling" skill had helped him escape from his miserable situation and win a chance for advancement.

With the weeds all removed, the outer courtyard became much cleaner, its area suddenly increased by several tenths. Li Xian had killed ten venomous snakes and seventeen black rats. In the cracks of bricks and stones, in damp corners... there were almost snake and rat nests everywhere. He used the "Green Silk Palm," shaking the snakes and rats to death, eradicating their nests and destroying their eggs, extremely brutal.

Nangong Liuli sat quietly in the distance, watching with great interest. Clearing the courtyard was a practical application of martial arts.

Then came the pruning of the fruit trees.

The fruit trees grew wildly, their canopies lush, blocking the sunlight. This made the courtyard gloomy and cold, gathering evil spirits. Li Xian was proficient in "Feng Shui Geomancy." He knew that "big trees attract the wind." Trees in a residence should not overshadow the main house. So, he cut branches and leaves, pruning the fruit trees to a suitable size.

The Great Luo Blade Technique displayed its full power, its blade light interwoven into a net. Several large trees were trimmed properly. Sunlight shone into the courtyard, and the gloomy, cold, and damp air immediately dissipated.

Li Xian was very methodical. He cleaned the outer courtyard, inner courtyard, bedroom, main hall, and kitchen. He tidied up discarded decorations, swept away dust, and wiped tables and chairs. The large courtyard residence was organized in half a day.

This courtyard covered "three mu," and had over ten beehives. Li Xian found them one by one. First, he spat out a blood mist, condensing it into a "cocoon" to cover the beehives.

Then he removed them one by one. His handling was very meticulous. The originally desolate residence was now livable. Nangong Liuli had lived in luxury since childhood, but seeing Li Xian tidy up the courtyard, making it clean and livable bit by bit, she couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth. Thinking that she was trapped here with no hope of escape, this house would be her long-term residence, she actually developed a sense of settling down.

She imagined how to arrange the courtyard's scenery, to show both elegance and freshness. Born into a noble family, she was influenced by her environment, and she had a natural understanding of courtyard design, far superior to Li Xian.

Li Xian moved all the remaining porcelain to the outer courtyard. He filled a large water vat with water and kicked the vat's body.

The vat did not break, but the water inside began to spin rapidly.

This was a move from the "Clear Breeze Leg." He kicked several times in a row. The water spun faster and faster. Then, he threw the porcelain into the water vat. The swirling water washed away the dirt and grime.

When he took them out, they were as bright and new as before. These porcelain items were intact and could be reused as decorations for the hall.

Nangong Liuli said in surprise, "You don't know many martial arts, but their clever uses always surprise me."

It was noon.

The bedding was laid in the bedroom, and this residence could now be lived in long-term. Li Xian picked up a brush and wrote, naming the residence "Green Ox Dwelling." It referred to the house on Green Ox Street, and also implied the meaning of a green ox bowing its head to graze on grass, calming its mind, and accumulating strength.

The door was closed.

It became a small world of its own. Nangong Liuli's expression was strange. She suddenly didn't dare to look at Li Xian. She thought that in this residence, no matter what Li Xian wanted to do to her, she would have to obey.

Li Xian pondered: "Although Nangong Liuli is beautiful, she isn't so beautiful that I would lose my composure. I helped her out of convenience, and I'm too lazy to ask for a reward. I should make this clear to her, so she doesn't have wild ideas."

After he stated it plainly, Nangong Liuli's eyes welled up with tears. Li Xian was puzzled. "Strange... why are you about to cry?"

Nangong Liuli sighed. "Hua Shaoxia... you are an upright person, and I admire you very much. But you... you are too naive."

Li Xian said strangely, "How am I naive?"

Nangong Liuli sighed. "Of course, you respect me and won't act recklessly. It seems... you don't have any feelings for me in your heart. There is a more beautiful and more powerful woman in your heart."

Li Xian said, "That's not the case." He suddenly thought: "Wen Caishang treats me with nothing but calculations of interest. Why should I give her my sincerity?" He was naturally charming, but he valued emotions greatly. His nature was both contradictory and quite free and easy. If Wen Caishang had treated him with genuine love and affection, he would have returned it with sincerity.

By then... what woman in the world could he have looked at twice?

Nangong Liuli said, "But even if you want to respect me, the Flower Cage Sect won't allow it. You are in this environment, how can you truly remain pure?"

She said sorrowfully, "I have been trapped for many days and have a clearer understanding of the situation. Unless something unexpected happens, it will be extremely difficult for me to escape. I spoke with my maidservant and learned that the sect members all take pride in their 'beautiful dependents.' The more submissive the dependents, the higher their status in the sect."

"The dependents cannot leave the island... This island contains the layout of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, with many barriers, making it difficult for outsiders to find. The Flower Cage Sect has a hidden connection with the Candle Cult, and their background is extraordinary."

"They used a single robe to make me unable to resist. You... you respect me, but if they discover that we are not like that, they will inevitably become suspicious. By then, even you will not be able to protect yourself."

The Flower Cage Sect moved around committing crimes and was surrounded and hunted from all sides. Their personnel流动 was great. Ordinary "nominal disciples" or "token-holding disciples" might die elsewhere or defect from the sect... Sometimes it was hard to know.

Ordinary sect members could be loose and undisciplined, but the higher one's position, the more rules were needed. Otherwise, if elders and such could just leave and never return, how could the Flower Cage Sect last long. "Beautiful dependents" were shackles. If you had a beautiful dependent but did not enjoy her, it meant this dependent was of no use to you.

Why not send her to someone else.

Nangong Liuli, coming from a noble family, would think one step further about the pros and cons in everything. Although she had been scolding and unyielding after arriving on the island, she had long known that her fate was difficult to reverse. Li Xian was also smart, but he had freedom of movement and had never thought deeply about it.

Li Xian said frankly, "I understand. In this situation, we can be considered kindred spirits, but we are just chance acquaintances. If it really comes to that, we are just cooperating."

Nangong Liuli said resentfully, "There's no other way." She originally had a good impression of Li Xian and couldn't help but feel indignant: "You little servant, are you afraid I'll fall in love with you? Hmph, how arrogant. I've seen many young heroes who are much better than you."

Li Xian said, "You should go back to your room and rest first." Nangong Liuli supported herself and walked back to the room. The courtyard's vermilion door was tightly closed, and the outer courtyard was spacious and serene.

Li Xian practiced his martial arts, thinking to himself: "What Nangong Liuli said is indeed reasonable. I am not a saint; I have both emotional and carnal desires. Since the situation is like this, why should I pretend to be a gentleman?"

He practiced the Four Directions Fist, Clear Breeze Leg, and other basic martial arts again. His thoughts drifted, returning to the situation at the One Union Manor. He had spent money to buy a residence today, and it was finally stable. He carefully considered recent events.

The one he thought about most was Wen Caishang... He valued emotions greatly. He sometimes asked himself if Wen Caishang had any feelings for him, but the answers were always vague. He remembered Pang Long, Qiu Yue, and others, and took them as a warning.

He also thought that although Wen Caishang treated him slightly differently, it was ultimately similar. Past miscellaneous matters surfaced in his mind.

Li Xian suddenly smiled. He had figured it all out. He had been willing to exchange sincerity for the bright moon, but as a mere mayfly, his sincerity was so cheap. Since he had broken free from his cage, he was originally meant to indulge his nature, be free and unrestrained, and gallop across the world.

Whether others hated him, loved him, or were annoyed by him, it was related to him, yet also无关.

This kind of hesitation... was too败兴致. Thinking this way, he was no better than those womanizers.

Since Li Xian had become clear, he returned to his true nature. But thinking of Nangong Liuli's unique clothing, which made it difficult for her to even sit or stand, he temporarily dropped the matter. Wen Caishang's concerns were not wrong. If Li Xian were not charming, how would he dare to provoke a spicy flower like her. Since he dared to provoke her, would he be afraid of other delicate, red, or green flowers?

Even if he didn't provoke them主动, if flowers blew over and hit him, with his charming nature, how many could he avoid?

Wen Caishang's treatment of Li Xian was biased and ruthless, but her vision was indeed sharp. Taming a man was indeed a top priority.

Li Xiaofan was traveling and studying abroad. Thinking that the burden of the old Li family was all on his older brother's shoulders, he was even more牵花引草, enjoying it immensely. All these trivial matters would end up who knows how.

\[Proficiency +1\]
\[Proficiency +1\]

The next morning.

Li Xian practiced martial arts early in the morning. His fist techniques were sincere, and his fist momentum was vast. The night before, they had another private talk, clarifying their respective situations, and agreeing to cooperate to seek resources and development within the Flower Cage Sect.

Li Xian set three rules. In the Water Jar, how they enjoyed themselves was one thing. If they escaped in the future, there would be no revenge. Nangong Liuli glared at Li Xian fiercely. This家伙 was guarding against her turning her back on him once they escaped.

Nangong Liuli agreed to everything, thinking: "Fine, we'll cooperate. The day I escape, I'll forget you, this little thief, completely. Do you think I'm very fond of you?"

Having reached an agreement, Li Xian tried to help Nangong Liuli take off the "Flowing Gaze of the Rainbow Robe." But the robe concealed tiny needles, and a unique method was needed to remove it.

That day, Elder Liu Yu of the Flower Cage Sect was to leave the Water Jar by boat. A banquet was held in the residence, inviting everyone to eat and drink.

Seven banquet tables were set up in the courtyard. One for the elder, three for the disciples, and three for the laborers. Liu Yu, as an elder, used his authority to run business ventures.

He owned a beeyard and a winery. He needed to hire local people to manage them. Once enough honey and fine wine were囤积, he would transport them out of the Water Jar by boat to sell outside, accumulating wealth.

The leader of the hired workers was invited to the府 to eat. Liu Yu had a big belly, a round face, and fair skin, looking very wealthy and富态. His clothes were very luxurious.

Ye Cheng, Meng Han, Jin Shichang... were all invited to the banquet. The residence was very lively. Beautiful dependents held silver basins and served various delicacies.

Li Xian accepted the invitation and entered the residence. He heard the sound of women's laughter, very淫糜. He followed the sound and saw several men and women chasing and playing.

Ye Cheng and Meng Han both brought beautiful dependents with them. They were dignified and elegant. Liu Yu had a beautiful dependent on each side, being served wine and meat, enjoying all the joy and fragrance.

Liu Yu waved his hand. "Wucuo, come, come, we were waiting for you. Come and sit."

There was an empty seat at the elder's table. Ye Cheng said, "Wucuo, why did you come alone? Haven't you tamed that little girl yet?"

Li Xian said with an awkward smile, "Elder Ye... this girl comes from a noble family. Her temperament is both fierce and impatient. She would rather die than submit. I really can't do anything about her." He sat at the table.

A beauty waiting nearby stepped forward to wash his porcelain bowl, pour tea, and wipe the foam. She served him food and was very attentive. White steam curled around, cups and goblets clinked, and the fragrance of wine and meat drifted.

Liu Yu said, "That won't do. Wucuo... let me tell you. For us martial artists, killing the enemy is secondary, defeating the enemy is also secondary. Only subduing the enemy is supreme."

As he spoke, the beauty beside him offered him wine and fed him fish eyes from a fish soup. After drinking the fine wine and enjoying the service, Liu Yu's expression showed a drunken flush. He said, "Winning the top spot in the tournament is nothing in my eyes. But being able to subdue a beautiful dependent, that is truly impressive."

Li Xian thought: "What kind of crooked logic is this?" He smiled and said, "What the Elder says is reasonable."

Meng Han said sourly, "It's easy to say, but hard to do."

Ye Cheng laughed. "Wucuo, it's a rare opportunity. Why not take this chance to ask for advice?"

Li Xian said, "Elder Liu, Elder Meng... I hope you can offer some guidance."

Liu Yu laughed heartily. "It's not really difficult. You just need to do this and that..."

He immediately poured out his experience, his expression extremely proud. The beauty beside him was named "Jiang Xiangxiang." She also said, "Young Master Hua, if you find it troublesome, you can bring her here, and we can help you educate her properly."

At that time, the Great Wu was in chaos, and social norms were gradually collapsing. The Flower Cage Sect's风气 was open, and it had become a school of its own.

Liu Yu, getting excited, even gave Li Xian various miscellaneous books like the "Flower Rope Classic," "Sleepless Watching the Moon Record," and "Jade Reflection Painting Diagram," instructing him to study them carefully.

Li Xian hid the books in his sleeve, raised his cup to offer a toast, and said a few farewell words to the bright moon. Liu Yu, hearing this, was delighted and praised Li Xian's literary talent. Ye Cheng, in high spirits, paced back and forth and also recited a few farewell poems. He was surprisingly accomplished in literature, and his lines were very beautiful and rich in meaning.

The beauty he brought looked at him with admiration, massaging his shoulders and serving him. She was extremely attentive and thoughtful. Although Li Xian was ashamed of the Flower Cage Sect's doings, seeing everyone's charming and interesting demeanor, he also felt a slight感触.

Liu Yu said, "Xiangxiang, I heard you learned a sword dance. Please dance for them."

Jiang Xiangxiang, in her prime of charm, gave Liu Yu a sidelong glance. "You stinky old man, you just love ordering people around." She walked gracefully into the room, and a servant girl took out two fine swords.

She took the fine swords and danced. She thrust her two swords forward, hooked a wine pot, and tossed it into the air. Then, she did a vertical split, her body as soft as boneless, her toes touching the bottom of the wine pot.

She bent her waist slightly, and the wine pot poured out fine wine. Jiang Xiangxiang used her two swords as a bridge, letting the wine flow without a drop into Liu Yu's cup.

Her figure was graceful and captivating. This dance posture was引人遐想. Jiang Xiangxiang was originally skilled with the sword. To please Liu Yu, she had精心编创 this sword dance. Liu Yu was beaming with satisfaction and said, "Continue."

Jiang Xiangxiang smiled with her red lips and continued to dance with her swords. It was beautiful and mesmerizing. Her graceful posture turned rapidly like a疾风, and was as powerful as thunder.

After the dance, Ye Cheng, Meng Han, and Li Xian all applauded and praised. Jiang Xiangxiang had a light sweat on her forehead. She first glanced at Liu Yu, then very subtly glanced at Li Xian.

By now, the banquet was half over. Li Xian asked about the method to remove the "Flowing Gaze of the Rainbow Robe."

Ye Cheng said, "Wucuo... don't be too hasty about this. Her spirit is still high. If you remove the Flowing Gaze of the Rainbow Robe, she will definitely try to escape."

"If you let her escape and she is captured by someone else, she won't belong to you anymore. You should first let her adapt and cultivate her slowly."

Li Xian said, "This girl hasn't mastered the way to sit and walk. She wails in pain just walking. What should I do?"

Liu Yu said, "Oh... did she offend the Palace of Women? They don't teach the sitting and walking techniques, and we can't help it. After all, we haven't worn that strange robe, and we don't know the method either."

Li Xian said, "So... I want to help her take off the strange robe. Then I'll use other methods to restrict her movements."

Liu Yu nodded. "That makes sense." He then taught Li Xian the method to remove the Flowing Gaze of the Rainbow Robe. It turned out that to remove the Flowing Gaze of the Rainbow Robe, one first had to boil the "Nine Flower Jade Dew Ointment," apply the ointment to her whole body, and then use the "Massage to Promote Blood Flow and Acupoint Pressing" method to gradually remove the strange robe.

Li Xian understood and memorized it in his heart. Liu Yu chatted with Li Xian for a long time. He felt they shared similar interests and said, "Brother Hua, I'm leaving the island tomorrow. Why don't you come with me and travel around?"

Jin Shichang said, "Old Liu, don't break the rules. Since Hua Wucuo has won the championship, he can't leave the island for a short time."

Li Xian asked, "Please explain, Envoy Jin."

Jin Shichang said, "Since you have a beautiful dependent and haven't 'stamped her' yet, you can't leave the island."

Li Xian asked, "Stamp?"

Jin Shichang said, "There's no rush for that. Wait until you've tamed that little girl of yours."

Li Xian thought: "It seems there's no such thing as getting benefits and then immediately running away in this world." He didn't ask further.

The banquet was nearing its end. Li Xian cupped his fists and said goodbye, walking out of the deep residence of the Liu Mansion. Jin Shichang followed closely behind, caught up to Li Xian, and put a hand on his shoulder.

Li Xian was very surprised. "Envoy Jin... you..."

Jin Shichang asked in return, "Do you remember, there were three rewards for winning the championship. You have a beautiful lady, but do you not want the treasure anymore?"

Li Xian said, "Of course I remember. Could it be that Envoy Jin..."

Jin Shichang said, "That's right. I received Chief Envoy Shi's order to use the banquet to deliver the treasure to you."

"But there were too many people and eyes at the banquet. If I gave it to you in front of everyone, it would inevitably be seen. That's not appropriate. So I waited for you to leave the table before catching up to give you the treasure."

Li Xian said respectfully, "Thank you, Envoy Jin, for thinking of me."

Jin Shichang looked at Li Xian for a moment and said, "Thinking of you... not necessarily. But I heard Chief Envoy Shi say that you have quite the air of the Candle Cult, which made me very curious. That's why I'm getting in touch with you."

Li Xian asked, "The air of the Candle Cult? What does that mean exactly?"

Jin Shichang said, "The world calls the Candle Cult a demonic sect. The air of the Candle Cult... naturally means demonic nature, doing all kinds of evil."

Li Xian laughed. "I'm afraid I don't have that."

Jin Shichang smiled. "Of course, that's the shallow understanding of the world. The true nature of the Candle Cult should be 'defying laws and heavens, solely revering my will,' 'acting on one's own, my spirit soaring to the ninth heaven.'"

"'Defying laws and heavens' is not about doing evil. 'Solely revering my will' is not about arrogance. 'Acting on one's own' is not about bullying and dominating. 'My spirit soaring to the ninth heaven' is not about wild arrogance."

"When the Candle Cult still existed, the sect members' understanding was already biased. They lost this kind of temperament. Chief Envoy Shi vaguely sees in you a hint of this雏气."

Li Xian didn't care at all. His strength was still weak, and he was far from being 'defying laws and heavens, solely revering my will, acting on one's own, my spirit soaring to the ninth heaven.' But his desire for freedom and adherence to his own heart did secretly align with it.

Jin Shichang laughed. "Originally, there was only one treasure, but you were lucky, and there was one more at the last minute. Choose one from the two."
