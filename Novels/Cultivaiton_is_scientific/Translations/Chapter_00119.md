# Chapter 119: Spiritual Sense

The *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* posits that the human brain is constrained by the natural laws of heaven and earth. Only by breaking through these constraints can one's consciousness leave the body, forming what is known as spiritual sense.

Spiritual sense represents an evolution of a cultivator's soul, akin in significance to the formation of a spiritual vortex within the body—both mark crucial leaps forward. The emergence of a spiritual vortex signifies that a cultivator's body is no longer mortal but capable of harnessing spiritual energy. Meanwhile, the ability of spiritual sense to leave the body means a cultivator's soul can interact with nature, perceiving and observing the world without relying on physical senses. This perception offers deeper insights into the essence of the world.

Li Shiming was well aware of the immense difficulty in mastering the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique*. During his discussions with Yin Shilan, he had inquired about spiritual sense. Yin Shilan explained that spiritual sense was a vital enhancement for formation masters—those who possessed it belonged to an entirely different echelon. 

Obtaining a spiritual sense technique was exceedingly rare, even for Foundation Establishment cultivators. Within the Tianhai Sect, such techniques were unavailable for exchange, and Yin Shilan suspected the situation was similar in other sects. Not only were these techniques hard to come by, but their cultivation was also exceptionally demanding, particularly in terms of mental fortitude. 

From Yin Shilan, Li Shiming learned just how precious the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* was—far beyond his initial expectations.

His doppelganger focused its mind to a single point, aided by Soul-Calming Incense, achieving peak mental clarity. Its consciousness condensed into a jade sword radiating cold energy, which kept its mind sharp and prevented it from losing itself in the depths of intense mental exertion. 

The jade sword shot forth, striking the space between the eyebrows—the location described in the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* as the barrier of natural constraints. According to the technique, breaking through this barrier required persistent, daily effort over a long period.

To his surprise, the icy jade sword effortlessly pierced through the barrier. It surged out of the brain, transforming into a strand of spiritual sense formed from mental energy.

Through this spiritual sense, Li Shiming perceived his machine room space in an entirely new light—distinct from what his eyes saw or what his consciousness observed from a god's-eye view. Spiritual energy flowed through the space, charged dust particles drifted, and the light waves emitted by LED lamps created a surreal experience that left him awestruck. 

The world remained the same, yet through spiritual sense, it became infinitely richer. And this was just within the purified confines of the machine room. The outside world would undoubtedly offer even more vibrant sensations.

Li Shiming suppressed the urge to summon his doppelganger outside. Its aura had not yet fully stabilized, and premature exposure could invite trouble. 

He pondered why the doppelganger had mastered the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* with such ease. There had to be a reason. 

In truth, the doppelganger's breakthrough was due to its solid foundation. After Bai Li Jinyan's soul dissipated, only its intelligence vanished—its soul energy was converted into a necrotic spirit through the *Profound Nether Corpse Refining Method*. However, the transformation was incomplete, resulting in a unique undead entity that retained most of its original abilities.

Had Li Shiming not directed the doppelganger to practice the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique*, the barrier of natural constraints in its brain would have gradually reformed. The ease with which the doppelganger cultivated the technique stemmed from the fact that the barrier had only just begun to recover when the icy jade sword struck it again.

If the difficulty of an ordinary cultivator mastering the technique was rated at 100, the doppelganger's re-cultivation was a mere 1—a staggering difference.

Li Shiming experimented with manipulating his spiritual sense. It bore similarities to controlling spiritual energy hands, but spiritual sense was far more elusive. Unless an opponent had reached Foundation Establishment and possessed spiritual sense themselves, they would be completely unaware of its presence. 

This meant that even if spiritual sense extended right in front of a Qi Refinement cultivator, they wouldn't detect it. 

Moreover, spiritual sense could be weaponized. Its offensive potential depended on its strength and the technique used to cultivate it. Without a specialized technique, spiritual sense could only be used instinctively—primarily to enhance control over spells and flying swords. 

Direct attacks were only feasible if the target's soul was significantly weaker. However, with a technique like *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique*, spiritual sense could be honed into a lethal weapon—condensing into a jade sword capable of devastating an enemy's soul.

After experiencing the power of the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique*, Li Shiming once again felt a surge of gratitude for the sheer luck that had allowed him to kill Bai Li Jinyan. Had Bai Li Jinyan been given even a sliver of opportunity, the outcome would have been reversed.

Bai Li Jinyan had been a peak Qi Refinement cultivator with a body tempered by the *Sword Demon Secret Code* and a third-grade sword foundation, coupled with spiritual sense cultivated through the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique*. He had been a near-flawless warrior in every aspect.

Comparing himself to Bai Li Jinyan, Li Shiming recognized the standard he needed to reach. If he could match Bai Li Jinyan's level during Qi Refinement, he would finally bridge the gap between himself and the privileged "immortal descendants."

After concluding the doppelganger's cultivation session, Li Shiming prepared to practice the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* with his main body. 

He lit the Soul-Calming Incense and inhaled deeply, not wanting to waste a single breath. Drawing from the doppelganger's experience, his main body proceeded with practiced ease, focusing all mental energy into a single point.

His consciousness coalesced into an icy jade sword—but to his surprise, the sword formed by his main body was noticeably larger than the doppelganger's, adorned with intricate microscopic runes.

"Could this be due to the fusion of two souls?" he wondered. 

Apart from this, he couldn't think of any other reason his main body might surpass Bai Li Jinyan's innate advantages. 

Though he wasn't one to belittle himself, he was a triple-spiritual-root cultivator. Even if his metal spiritual root was exceptionally strong at 81, it didn't change the fact that he lacked Bai Li Jinyan's single spiritual root with a perfect 100 in metal affinity. From childhood, Bai Li Jinyan had been nourished with rare spiritual treasures, elevating both his soul and body far beyond ordinary cultivators.

The thought that a stronger soul might facilitate the cultivation of the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* brought Li Shiming some comfort. His jade sword struck the invisible barrier between his eyebrows.

With a resounding *boom*, his vision swam, and the world seemed to spin. The jade sword rebounded against the unyielding barrier.

Gasping for breath, Li Shiming realized how close he had come to death. The first attempt to breach the barrier had nearly cost him dearly.

But the *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* was a gradual process—success in a single attempt was the exception, as demonstrated by his doppelganger. 

Over the following hours, he repeatedly struck the barrier with his jade sword. Just as he was about to give up, resigned to ending his first session with no progress, the final strike produced a familiar shattering sound.

"I'm not completely hopeless after all!" Li Shiming laughed aloud, exhilarated. 

At that moment, his newly formed spiritual sense extended beyond his body, immersing him in a world of newfound sensations. It was like gaining an additional sense—one that combined the functions of sight, hearing, and touch, yet operated freely up to thirty meters from his body.

In the outside world, spiritual sense offered an even richer experience than within the sterile confines of the machine room. 

Like a child with a new toy, Li Shiming eagerly explored every corner of his underground space with his spiritual sense. He soon realized that his main body's spiritual sense was stronger than the doppelganger's in both intensity and range.

He couldn't be certain whether this meant he surpassed Bai Li Jinyan's original spiritual sense, as it was unclear how much of it the doppelganger had inherited. Still, it bolstered his confidence—at least in this aspect, he was no weaker than the prodigious immortal descendants. In fact, he might even be stronger.

Spiritual sense had countless applications. The *Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique* was merely a method to cultivate and strengthen it, enabling the transformation of spiritual sense into a jade sword for soul attacks. 

Mastering its other uses would require further exploration. 

For instance, when analyzing formations, spiritual sense provided far clearer and more detailed insights than his physical senses. To Li Shiming, spiritual sense was like a sixth sense—distinct from the psychological concept of intuition. 

This sixth sense was an entirely new sensory organ, unrestricted by physical limitations. 

Inspired, Li Shiming connected his spiritual sense to the IBM z15 as an additional input device, alongside his five senses. To his delight, the supercomputer successfully interfaced with his spiritual sense, marking the first time it could directly perceive spiritual energy.

Previously, spiritual energy had been an abstract concept to the IBM z15. Even when Li Shiming used techniques like *Demonic Voice Infiltration*—where spiritual energy was channeled through sound waves—the computer had no direct interaction with the energy itself. 

Now, with spiritual sense as a bridge, the IBM z15 could scan and analyze spiritual energy. This breakthrough was monumental. 

From this point onward, the IBM z15 could contribute in ways previously impossible. 

For example, in formation research, the computer had previously served only as a computational aid, swiftly solving complex equations. But with sufficient data on spiritual energy, it could simulate formation operations within its servers, testing various configurations and even designing new formations. 

Once the IBM z15 completed its analysis, the results could be loaded into Li Shiming's memory, allowing him to assimilate the knowledge instantly. 

This drastically accelerated his formation studies. Regardless of the complexity, the IBM z15 could handle the research while Li Shiming reaped the benefits. 

Of course, this required him to first test various formation runes in reality, providing the IBM z15 with raw data—a time-consuming and resource-intensive endeavor. 

But the payoff would be worth it. The IBM z15 excelled at analysis and computation, the very skills essential to formation mastery.

With spiritual sense successfully cultivated, Li Shiming had achieved his first major goal. 

He retrieved the relic given to him by the old monk Du Yuan. After returning to the sect, he had inquired about relics and learned from Yin Shilan that prolonged exposure could subtly influence a cultivator's mind—a boon for Buddhists but problematic for others, especially in a Daoist-aligned sect like Tianhai. 

Foundation Establishment cultivators could resist this influence thanks to their spiritual sense, which provided formidable mental defenses. 

Over the past twenty days, Li Shiming had consumed spirit fish daily while diligently practicing the *Vajra Protection Divine Technique*. 

Holding the relic, he sensed its interior. 

As if recognizing his vajra energy, faint golden Buddhist sigils emerged, carrying a stream of high-quality vajra energy into his palm. 

This energy was minuscule but of a purity far beyond his own. 

The Buddhist sigils transformed into golden light, surging toward his brain—only to be blocked by his spiritual sense. 

This wasn't a conscious decision. Any foreign mental intrusion would trigger an automatic defense from his spiritual sense. 

No matter how benign Buddhism claimed to be, spiritual sense recognized it as an external influence and repelled it accordingly. 

Li Shiming now understood the relic's function: prolonged contact would continuously infuse the wearer with high-quality vajra energy, accelerating the cultivation of the *Vajra Protection Divine Technique*. 

However, the accompanying Buddhist sigils would also gradually erode the cultivator's soul. 

For Li Shiming, this was no longer a concern. With spiritual sense guarding his mind, he could safely harness the relic's benefits without fear of conversion. 

He smiled. 

His path forward had never been clearer.
