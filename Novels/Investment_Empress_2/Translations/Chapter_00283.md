# Chapter 283: Jade Phoenix Form, the Fiery Ice Cube

In the Water Clan's Cavern Heaven of the Suspended Temple.

From the lower-level seventh-grade minor demons who had come to compete for the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens, up to great demons and demon kings like Wu Qing and Man Bo, all had gathered around the forest, bathed in the light of the Jade Phoenix God. Their faces revealed expressions of comfort and enjoyment.

The pristine water marsh had been turned into something resembling a sunny beach.

Fortunately, this wasn't the real sun; otherwise, they would have all turned into dried salted fish before long.

The baptism of the Ancestor's True Spirit was a subtle and slow transformation.

Mu Rongxiao, half of his face covered in Ming Dragon scales, had a solemn and dignified expression. Although he was a half-demon, among the Ming Dragon clan, his bloodline was now the purest.

"My shell seems to be growing some reverse spikes?"

"Sigh, this is a bit too flashy, not very good."

A Black Tortoise Demon King sighed with a beaming face, showing off his progress.

"I've only improved a little. Given some time, I'll definitely be no worse than a human's Mystic Weapon."

The Swordfish Great Demon pierced a stone with its nose, its face filled with pride.

Why did the Swordfish clan move to the Southern Frontier to settle down?

It was all because one of their ancestors once had a body comparable to a treasure weapon and followed a world-famous great swordsman to achieve a mighty reputation. This led to many swordsmen trying every means to get a Swordfish to use as a weapon.

"We'll be able to hold our heads high in front of the Bird clans from now on."

Wu Qing smiled, then suddenly, as if catching a cold, let out a sneeze.

*(Achoo)* Rumble—

The water vapor in the Water Clan's Cavern Heaven condensed, and within the dark clouds, a hint of wind and thunder intent appeared. In an instant, a heavy rain began to fall.

The demons were all astonished. In such a short time, Wu Qing's bloodline power had increased almost visibly!

Wu Qing put her hands on her hips, very satisfied with the reaction of the crowd.

But before she could speak, a faint electrical static sounded in her ear:
"Lo~ok~ at~ my~~~"

"Wait, Man Bo, don't generate electricity here!"

It was raining heavily.

As everyone knows, if it's not pure water, it conducts electricity. Obviously, the wind and rain summoned by Wu Qing wasn't pure water.

Thus, amidst the heavy rain, crackling sounds continued incessantly as water demons twinkled like sparkling jewels in the downpour.

Fortunately, Wu Qing now had extremely strong control over water vapor, and the range of the rain wasn't large, so she stopped it in time.

Otherwise, when Little Li came out, he would probably see a bunch of demons floating belly-up in the marsh.

"I've seen the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens from a distance a few times. Its effect didn't seem this good."

The Black Tortoise Demon King couldn't help but feel puzzled.

He had become a Demon King precisely because of the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens. Having lived a long life, he had been fortunate enough to come into contact with it a few times by chance.

"I used to hear that when the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens fell into the hands of the Bird clans, the light it emitted was like a big candle, at most allowing two demons to comprehend its power."

Wu Dameng nodded his head. "Exactly. If it were as miraculous as it is now, our Water Clan's territory would have been occupied by the Bird clans long ago."

Mu Rongxiao opened his eyes. When he spoke again, his voice seemed to carry a hint of thunderous rumble:
"They are cultivating together inside."

"Huh? Is it Wu Mo and the Green Phoenix Goddess?"

"Sss... So it's because the True Dragon bloodline and the True Phoenix bloodline were stimulated together that the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens reacted so violently."

"Should we go in and thank them?"

The demons were all very grateful.

Mu Rongxiao recalled the scene when he was reunited with his wife after a long separation, and couldn't help but blush.
"I think... there's no need for that."

"Mm..."

Wu Qing glanced at Mu Rongxiao, who seemed to be on the verge of a breakthrough, then shifted her gaze to the forest, revealing a hint of complexity.

The supreme treasure of the demon race, yet it shines brilliantly in the hands of a human youth and maiden. Who could have imagined it?

But it seems... it's not a bad thing?

...

"What was that crackling sound outside?"

Li Mo opened his eyes slightly, but the light from the Jade Phoenix God was too bright, like a holy light, making it impossible to see the situation outside clearly.

He could only see the owner of the cool, soft little hand on his mouth. Her pure, clean face and the Jade Phoenix God's light reflected each other. Her eyes were wide and blank, her expression without joy or sorrow. No wonder everyone called her the Green Phoenix Goddess. However, her slightly pursed lips had a somewhat ruddy, moist luster.

---

Looks very delicious...

What am I thinking? It must be the Ming Dragon bloodline acting up!

To calm himself down, Li Mo subconsciously licked his lips, but he forgot something for a moment.

So Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled, and she opened her eyes.

The Ice Cube's gaze.

"Mmmmm." Li Mo was about to lean back tactically.

Who knew Ying Bing would raise her delicate eyebrows, and her other hand would reach over in annoyance.

Pinching the nose of the peerless Heavenly Dragon.

Li Mo: "???"

Let's just say.

He is now not just a martial artist at the Four Apertures of Observing the Divine stage. He has seven Mystic Pills inside him forming a cycle of their own, and he has also transformed into a Ming Dragon. Could he really be suffocated? Holding his breath until tomorrow morning would be no problem at all.

But how come, the moment he sees her furrowed brows and the faint blame in her eyes, he feels a bit suffocated?

"Don't get distracted. Focus on practicing."

Ying Bing retracted her slender, fair hand, letting go of Little Li's nose and mouth, then grabbed his hand.

"Alright."

Li Mo nodded and gathered his spirits.

He had just condensed another transformation. The speed was already very fast, but to be honest, he wasn't focusing wholeheartedly. Their minds were connected, and the Ice Cube obviously sensed it, which is why she took her hand back.

The main reason was that when he licked his lips just now, the Ice Cube's state of mind clearly rippled as well.

By the way, she seemed to be comprehending some profound martial art as well.

"Jade Phoenix Form."

Ying Bing said softly.

If Li Mo knew this divine skill, he would probably find some common ground with the Seventy-Two Transformations. The difference is that the latter is purely a transformation and does not change the soul's intent. The ultimate goal of the Jade Phoenix Form, however, is to personally experience the divine intent of a hundred birds and ultimately unify them, condensing the Phoenix Form.

"It sounds very powerful."

"It is a divine skill."

Seeing his curiosity, Ying Bing summoned the Vermilion Bird True Spirit within the Jade Phoenix God.

The process was similar to when the King Peacock True Spirit possessed her last time.

Her plain clothes, after the surge of flame light, instantly transformed into a flamboyant and noble palace gown. The style was somewhat similar to... the set worn by the beautiful Master?

Three thousand strands of black hair turned into flowing flames, and her pupils ignited with a beautiful yet deadly fire color.

"Did you see it clearly?"

Ying Bing moved closer.

"Uh... not inferior to the divine skill I practice."

Li Mo nodded. He felt he had never looked at the Ice Cube's face so closely before. He felt her warm breath hitting his face as she spoke...

Is this still the Ice Cube?

Suddenly, she bloomed wildly. Not only is she not cold, but she's so fiery hot it makes one want to sweat.

"I can't concentrate properly." Little Li said seriously.

It's too hard to bear.

He felt his weak spot was undergoing a test millions of times more intense than what Brother Mu Rongxiao went through.

"..."

Actually, she knew even if he didn't say it.

It's just that when she thought about how they used to share a bed, take baths together, and how he bullied her until she was utterly embarrassed.

Now, for some reason, she wanted to get her revenge.

The drawback of this "Jade Phoenix Form" is that one's temperament might change slightly...

Mm, it must be because of this divine skill.

"Wait a moment."

The air suddenly began to drop in temperature sharply.

"This True Spirit is..."

"Cold Goose."
