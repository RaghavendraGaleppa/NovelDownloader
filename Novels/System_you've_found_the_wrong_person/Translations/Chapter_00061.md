# Chapter 61: Breakthrough in Strength, the Art of Qimen Dunjia  

Stepping out of the woods, Dou Changsheng gazed at the sun high in the sky and let out a sigh of relief. That had been far too close.  

Another ancient monster.  

The conclusion was easy to draw—very few in this world understood the true weight behind the words "Tai Zhen." The higher one's cultivation, the more those two words instilled fear.  

Dou Changsheng couldn't help but feel increasingly satisfied with this so-called "cheap little sister" of his. Without her, he likely wouldn't have survived either of these last two encounters.  

Holding the black chicken in his hand, he gathered some dry firewood and started a fire, preparing to roast it. Before long, he was already tearing into the meat.  

With only a pinch of salt as seasoning, the taste wasn't anything spectacular, but it was still far better than dry rations. With each bite, he could feel his blood energy surging, his complexion growing rosier. The medicinal effects were astonishing, and his appetite soared. Opening his mouth wide, he devoured the chicken in just a few bites, leaving nothing behind.  

Licking his fingers, Dou Changsheng felt his blood energy grow even stronger.  

Ancient monsters truly lived up to their reputation—they understood human desires all too well.  

Knowing exactly what he lacked, the old monster had delivered it straight to him.  

Among the Three Blossoms of Heaven, Earth, and Man, Dou Changsheng had already condensed the Blossom of True Qi, representing the Heavenly Blossom. The next steps were the Earthly Blossom and the Human Blossom, with the latter being the Blossom of Blood Energy.  

After consuming the black chicken, his blood boiled, his vitality surged, and his entire body radiated intense heat like a furnace, scorching the air around him.  

A faint, illusory flower slowly took shape, swaying in mid-air.  

As his blood energy continued to pour in, the Human Blossom gradually solidified, eventually forming a vivid flower standing proudly against the wind.  

Two of the Three Blossoms were now complete.  

This cultivation speed could be considered astonishingly fast.  

It also highlighted how, in the future, Dou Changsheng had deliberately suppressed his progress, never rushing blindly for breakthroughs.  

Back then, he had only broken through to the Xiantian Profound Realm and achieved the Three Blossoms Gathering after being ambushed by Wang Chongguang.  

Now, having obtained Wang Chongguang's thousand-year treasure herb and this fortuitous encounter, he had gained what the future Dou Changsheng had never lacked.  

Only the Earthly Blossom remained before his Xiantian True Qi could transform into Xiantian True Essence.  

In less than a year since his debut, he was already on the verge of mastering the Xiantian Realm—a feat that would take ordinary cultivators decades to accomplish. Back then, even the Ironclad Lion King Wang Xiong, who had once kidnapped him, had risked everything to enter the Northern Conflict just for a chance to break through to the Xiantian True Realm.  

Dou Changsheng slowly rose to his feet, dusted off his hands, straightened his robes, and continued on his way.  

---  

Not knowing his exact location wasn't a problem—he simply headed north.  

Before long, he stumbled upon an official road and breathed a sigh of relief.  

An official road meant he would soon encounter people and could finally figure out where he was.  

Glancing back in the direction of the mountain village, he marveled at how such an unremarkable little hamlet could hide an ancient monster.  

Casually, he pulled out a fragment of jade from his robes—a broken piece of a jade pendant, forcibly snapped off.  

He had found it inside the black chicken while eating. The moment he saw it, he knew the old woman, Granny Du, had intended for him to deliver a message.  

But the origins of this jade fragment were unclear, and he had no idea what to do with it.  

Besides, he had no intention of getting involved. They weren't family or friends—why invite trouble?  

The Human Rankings might praise him as righteous and benevolent, but Dou Changsheng didn't take it seriously. Fooling outsiders was one thing, but he wasn't about to fool himself. He was just an ordinary person—one who avoided trouble and prioritized self-preservation.  

After fiddling with the fragment for a while, he tucked it away and continued along the road.  

But soon, something felt off.  

Had he been here before?  

Narrowing his eyes, Dou Changsheng deliberately slashed out a sword qi, leaving a deep gash in the ground as a marker. He then walked for another quarter of an hour—only to find the same sword scar reappear before him.  

Staring at the freshly upturned earth and the straight trench, he fell silent.  

Had he walked in a circle?  

Was this an illusion, distorting his perception so that he unknowingly looped back to the same spot?  

Or had he entered some kind of formation, altering the terrain so subtly that he returned to his starting point without realizing it?  

One possibility after another flashed through his mind.  

As a transmigrator who had lived through an era of information explosion, his imagination ran wild with theories from his past life. For a moment, he stopped moving forward and deliberately backtracked.  

As he retreated, the sword scar grew farther away—until, after a while, it reappeared in front of him.  

His heart sank. There was no way out.  

Trying left or right wouldn't help either—no formation would leave such obvious flaws.  

Unknowingly, he had stumbled into some kind of mystical array—likely a product of the Qimen Dunjia arts.  

Unfortunately, this was his greatest weakness. His cultivation time had been too short; aside from wielding a sword, he knew nothing else.  

Glancing upward, he considered using the Hero's Sword to soar into the sky.  

---  

The sky and the earth were where vulnerabilities in formations were most likely to appear.  

The open sky lacked concealment, unlike the ground, where roads, rocks, and forests could be manipulated.  

The moment this thought crossed his mind, Dou Changsheng leaped into the air, executing the Cloud Dragon Triple Leap.  

But as he ascended, another figure rose into the sky in the distance—silver hair fluttering in the wind, robes billowing.  

Their eyes met, and recognition flashed between them.  

Dou Changsheng narrowed his eyes.  

Jin Wuming.  

They had parted ways at the crossroads—one heading south, the other north. Yet here they were, reunited under the most bizarre circumstances.  

Before Dou Changsheng could speak, Jin Wuming asked first, "Didn't you keep heading north? Why did you turn back?"  

Dou Changsheng suspected Jin Wuming was playing the blame game, shifting responsibility for the detour onto him. But he had no proof. After visiting the desolate village, he had lost his sense of direction. He had only *felt* like he was going north—whether he actually was remained questionable.  

Jin Wuming shook his head and waved a hand dismissively.  

"Never mind. It's not important."  

"As I said before, if we meet again, we'll have to join forces for survival."  

"This means we've both been dragged into the vortex of Liang Province."  

"No matter which way we go, we end up back where we started. Without a doubt, this is the Nine Bends Formation of the Mechanism Sect."  

"In all of Liang Province, only the Mechanism Sect could trap the two of us like this."  

"I sensed something was off and tried to escape, but it seems I still got caught."  

"The Divine Blood Sect, the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou..."  

"Most likely, they're using us as hostages to keep others in check."  

"Relax. We won't be the only unlucky ones here."  

"Soon enough, we'll meet other poor souls just like us."
