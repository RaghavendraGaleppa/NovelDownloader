# Chapter 60: A Seemingly Familiar Face

The two men were quite tall, their golden armor not dim in the night, somewhat resembling the Six Ding and Six Jia divine generals mentioned in some regional legends.

Qin Ming felt that these two were far from ordinary. Their bodies contained a rich vitality; their vigorous spirit and blood energy permeated their armor, unable to be concealed. He had never seen these four people before, but the most striking one was naturally the woman leading them.

Qin Ming's first impression of her was beauty. At first glance, she was incredibly stunning, and upon closer inspection, she seemed even more captivating.

Li Qingyue had stopped, standing calmly by the roadside. Her black hair flowed like a waterfall, and her figure was as slender and graceful as a willow branch. As the wind stirred her robes, she gave off a sense of ascending into the clouds, as if dispelling the night mist, even though there were no fire springs outside the town in this dense darkness.

Qin Ming didn't linger, intending to rush past on his Purple Lightning Beast. The young maid opened her mouth as if to say something, but then remembering her young lady's words about not being suitable for recognition, she closed it again. Qin Ming keenly caught her expression; the deep night couldn't hinder his current vision. At the same time, he noticed that the woman seemed to be observing him. Qin Ming was surprised and couldn't help but glance at her.

They were very close; he could even discern the patterns on her hair accessories. The woman wore a silver feathered robe, without makeup, her face exquisitely flawless. Standing there, she was like a bright moon breaking through the clouds, seemingly glowing in the dark night, her body pure and clear, exquisitely elegant.

Not long ago, Qin Ming had been attacked by Outsiders who could transform into mist. Two years prior, he had been severely wounded by a feather-robed youth, almost dying, and eventually ended up in this remote region. Therefore, he held some resistance towards Outsiders. Although the woman in the silver feathered robe could be described as stunning, Qin Ming merely swept her with a calm glance before riding his beast away.

Li Qingyue turned back, watching his departing figure. She had previously thought it was inappropriate to meet again, yet they had encountered each other here. She was still wondering whether to speak, but he was so indifferent, not stopping at all, rushing past. Li Qingyue's delicate brows furrowed slightly. She wasn't wearing a veil, so he couldn't possibly not recognize her, yet his gaze was so calm and profound, without a ripple. She felt a slight surprise. Had two years brought such significant changes to them, experiencing "things have changed, but people are no longer the same" ahead of time?

The maid spoke, "Miss, is there something between you and him? Why do I feel so strange? You thought it was not suitable to meet again, but he seems even more indifferent than you, even cold. If we hadn't looked at him first, that person probably wouldn't have looked at you. He's really so cold, so heartless!"

Li Qingyue shook her head, saying, "What are you thinking? He and I were once friends, what messy relationship could there be?"

The maid suddenly understood, then nodded, "He is surnamed Cui, Miss means, you're both from the same circle, right? That's all."

Li Qingyue said, "Many things happened two years ago. Those familiar people all went their separate ways. Some became Outsiders, some left the Path of Rebirth very early, some became influential figures, and some gradually became ordinary, even if their family backgrounds were still extraordinary. But many things are different now. I don't know why he would come here."

"Which kind of person was that just now?" the maid asked softly and cautiously.

"A somewhat illusory person. Let's go," Li Qingyue said, walking towards Green Pine Town first.

...

"Strange, a slight sense of familiarity," Qin Ming mused on the road. He secretly assessed her. The feathered-robed woman was so slender and delicate. If she didn't use those unpredictable Outsider techniques, purely based on physique, he felt he could punch her flying. He shook his head, hitting the Purple Lightning Beast with his damaged long spear, speeding away.

"Alright, you can leave now." Qin Ming kept his word. After the Purple Lightning Beast had run a big circle, now eighty li away from Twin Trees Village, he planned to let it go. The Purple Lightning Beast was surprised. It had prepared for the worst, intending to endure humiliation for now and get back at this brat later, making him scream for his mommy! That it was now allowed to leave was truly beyond its expectations.

"Not leaving yet? What are you gawking at!" Qin Ming kicked it on the rump. The Purple Lightning Beast was startled and enraged, immediately darting dozens of meters away. Turning back, it pointed a front hoof at him, letting out a low growl, mumbling something unclear.

"What are you yelping about? Do you want to die?" Qin Ming weighed the damaged long spear in his hand. The Purple Lightning Beast was alarmed, leaping over ten meters away and disappearing into the dense forest.

Qin Ming started his journey back, not taking the original path but detouring. Along the way, he entered the dense forest and buried his armor, saber, spear, and bow and arrows, completely discarding them. He felt that he might not need armor anymore. After fusing multiple types of Skyglow Energy and spreading it over his body, the defensive effect was far stronger than armor. The five-time mutated Old Golden Rooster, when performing the "Phoenix Spreads a Single Wing" technique, could cut through his fine armor but couldn't pierce his protective Skyglow.

Qin Ming traveled light with a mutton-fat jade iron blade on his back, and his speed immediately increased significantly. He entered the village silently through the snowflakes. Having left in the early night and returning now, it wasn't particularly late. Qin Ming was in a good mood; after all, he had single-handedly flattened Golden Rooster Ridge!

"A night's journey, both traveling and fighting, I'm actually a bit hungry." He first ate some fruits from Wild Ox Ridge, and soon after, hot copper pot beef was ready.

Deep in the mountains, the Purple Lightning Beast was furious, banging into trees. Some trees as thick as water buckets were snapped by its impacts. A white owl flew over, urging it to calm down, saying there was no need to get angry. Then, it whispered, "Did you see the Mountain Master? Can you get the Yin-Yang Grand Elixir?"

"That old wild boar has a problem. I quickly fled without even getting close," the Purple Lightning Beast said.

The white owl reminded it, "In this area, it's better to call it the Mountain Master. What problem could there be?"

"The old wild boar has been replaced!" the Purple Lightning Beast declared.

The owl was startled, "Replaced by whom?"

The Purple Lightning Beast said, "I suspect it might be that old white-haired beast that cried at the grave back then. It didn't die, nor did it run away. Instead, it became the Mountain Master."

"Then what do we do? Now everyone knows that the remaining roots and trunk of the ancient tree from the former Black and White Mountain, nourished by Skyglow, have turned into a Yin-Yang Grand Elixir. All parties are pressuring for it. Especially the Outsiders, they are most covetous of this herb containing Yin and Yang energy. If too many people are after it, can you still get it?"

"I'll have to ask an elder to step in. I can't handle this myself," the Purple Lightning Beast sighed helplessly.

Then, it trembled with anger, saying, "Go and thoroughly investigate a man for me, someone who looks like he's been through four or five rebirth stages. Exclude locals; one listen to that accent and you know he's from a major city where aristocratic families reside. Check who has recently come to the Black and White Mountain area. When he falls into my hands, I'll kick his dog head until it explodes!" The Purple Lightning Beast still felt like it wanted to explode on the spot recalling it, then it hurriedly ran to soak in the hot spring, seemingly wanting to wash away the humiliation.

Qin Ming usually spoke with a pure local accent. Since those fragmented memories and blurry scenes occasionally surfaced in his mind, he also knew accents from distant places. Tonight, he naturally pretended to be an outsider.

While counting his spoils, he inadvertently found some papers夹 in a book. They were letters exchanged between two great bandits and an old senior from the distant Golden Bandits. "The Golden Bandits collude with Outsiders? Could that mist-transforming man even be an Outsider beast?" Qin Ming didn't concern himself much; all the leads ended at Golden Rooster Ridge anyway.

The next day, he woke up early feeling full of vigor. After fulfilling his wish to kill the bandits, he felt it was time to travel far.

"Little Qin!" Old Man Liu came knocking early in the morning. Seeing Qin Ming at home, he completely exhaled in relief.

"Done," Qin Ming simply said. Old Man Liu knew he had traveled far last night to do something big. Hearing this response, he was so excited that he quickly took a deep breath, otherwise, he would have roared with delight.

"You are truly amazing!" Old Man Liu exclaimed. After Qin Ming's third rebirth, he could actually kill great bandits and single-handedly wipe out Golden Rooster Ridge! He gathered information here and then returned home satisfied, opening a jar of good wine he had brought back from the Mountain Patrol Unit, then happily taking small sips. He knew that in less than two days, this area would probably experience a huge commotion.

"Yongqing, come have a drink with me," Old Man Liu called out to Yang Yongqing next door.

"Uncle Liu, I'm about to become a mountain bandit, how can I be in the mood to drink!"

Old Man Liu chuckled, "Haven't you gone yet? Let's drink today for today's sorrows. Maybe they'll change their minds and not force people to go to Golden Rooster Ridge."

Yang Yongqing sighed, "Unless they all die, it's impossible with their overbearing nature."

Qin Ming was waiting for the events to unfold. If he left immediately and disappeared from here now, some individuals might find it unusual. He was studying three newly acquired books. Two of them were likely written by the two great bandits, used to instruct new recruits at Golden Rooster Ridge, and he had no interest in them. Only the yellowed, very old ancient book held great importance for him. He was diligently studying it. The rebirth method described in it was quite formidable, mentioning a peculiar type of Skyglow Energy – a soft energy – that emphasized using gentleness to overcome hardness, and it corresponded to a unique skill: Yellow Mud Palm.

Qin Ming hadn't delved into it yet, first roughly flipping through it. Just looking at the name of the palm technique, he felt it didn't sound very powerful. However, a later reader who had thoroughly studied this book left notes in it, mentioning that after mastering the Yellow Mud Palm, he had once killed an Outsider. Qin Ming murmured, "It seems Outsiders put incomparable pressure on those who walk other paths. Killing an Outsider made this master so excited that he even recorded this glorious achievement in his treasured secret manual." Speaking of which, he hadn't even left this remote area yet, and he had already encountered Outsiders consecutively.

Naturally, he couldn't help but think of the feathered-robed woman he encountered last night. She really did seem somewhat familiar. Qin Ming pondered, her exquisitely flawless face surfacing in his mind. That elegant temperament was quite rare. The more he thought about it, the more familiar it felt.

Finally, some fragmented images appeared in his mind. He recognized her after all! "No wonder she stopped by the roadside looking at me with a strange gaze; she must have recognized me. I had forgotten some things because of my severe injuries in the past and have only recently begun to regain old memories. She stood there, met me, yet didn't acknowledge me. Is she intentionally avoiding something?"
