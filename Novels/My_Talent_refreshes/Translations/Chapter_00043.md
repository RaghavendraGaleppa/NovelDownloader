# Chapter 43: Body Tempering Complete, Enemies Arrive

As the spirit fruit entered his mouth, Chu Ning immediately felt a burst of refreshing sweetness. A rich spiritual energy enveloped his entire palate. As he slowly chewed, the juice flowed into his stomach, and a surge of heat rose from his dantian, spreading throughout his limbs.

In the next moment, this heat suddenly intensified to an overwhelming degree. Chu Ning felt his entire body burning up—his skin, muscles, and bones all scorched as if his blood were about to ignite. In just an instant, his consciousness grew hazy, teetering on the edge of being consumed by the fiery surge.

A flicker of alarm crossed Chu Ning's face. "The effect of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit on the body is this potent?" Sensing the turbulent energy threatening to burst from within, he dared not let it wreak havoc unchecked. Immediately, he began practicing the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art in the spacious backyard.

Though he had practiced it countless times before, Chu Ning had never found it as arduous as this session. The searing heat made every inch of his body feel as if it were being torn apart, as though each movement might split him open. By the time he completed one cycle of the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, he was drenched in sweat. Yet, the raging heat within him showed no signs of abating.

However, Chu Ning was slightly relieved to find that some of the heat had been expended. Without hesitation, he continued, repeating the cycle over and over. As time passed, the burning sensation gradually subsided, and his body grew increasingly comfortable.

After countless repetitions, a sudden breakthrough occurred—a shackle within his body seemed to shatter. The scorching heat vanished entirely, leaving his body light and unburdened.

"Phew!" Chu Ning exhaled deeply and finally ceased his practice, his eyes gleaming with newfound clarity. With a casual clench of his fist, his skin took on a bronze hue, and a faint metallic resonance sounded when he flicked a finger. As he relaxed, his skin returned to normal.

Chu Ning could still sense the lingering effects of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit within him, but they no longer disrupted his cultivation. "The auctioneer wasn't exaggerating when they said this fruit was effective even for Foundation Establishment body cultivators. It's fortunate I realized quickly and was practicing the ancient Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art—otherwise, my body might not have withstood the fruit's power."

A hint of fear crept into Chu Ning's thoughts. He had acted somewhat rashly, but the results filled him with joy. Focusing his mind, he checked his cultivation progress:

[Evergreen Wood Art (Yellow Grade, Lower Tier), Second Layer (237/900)]  
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Volume: Immortal Skin 300/300]  

"Immortal Skin—perfected!" Uncontainable delight spread across Chu Ning's face. But as he read further, his eyes widened in astonishment.

[Talent refreshed. Reward: Divine Ability "Heavenly Fist"]  

Chu Ning was momentarily stunned before an irrepressible joy surged within him. Reaching mastery in Immortal Skin had indeed triggered a refresh of his golden finger—but this time, it wasn't a spiritual body talent. Instead, it was the lost divine ability from the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art's Immortal Skin volume: the "Heavenly Fist."

Upon reflection, it made sense. When he had perfected the Nine Yin Forging Technique, he had been rewarded with the Yin Wood Spirit Body—a talent that accelerated Qi refinement. The Nine Yin Forging Technique, though derived from the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, was fundamentally designed to help ordinary people sense spiritual energy. 

Similarly, mastering the first layer of the Evergreen Wood Art had granted him the Talisman Source Spirit Body, which enhanced his proficiency in talisman-making—a natural complement for wood-attribute cultivators. Now, perfecting the Immortal Skin volume of the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art had rewarded him with the Heavenly Fist, a divine ability originally part of the ancient art.

"It seems the talents I receive are closely tied to what I cultivate," Chu Ning mused. He suspected that progressing in Qi-refining techniques would continue to yield spiritual body talents, while body-tempering techniques would grant divine abilities like the Heavenly Fist.

Delving into the details of the Heavenly Fist, he learned it was a close-combat divine ability for body cultivators, harnessing personal Qi to channel the power of heaven and earth into devastating strikes. A single punch could shatter the defenses of ordinary spells below late-stage Qi Refinement, and any Qi Refinement cultivator struck directly would almost certainly perish.

Despite never having practiced this ability before, Chu Ning found it as instinctive as his instant-cast spells like the Thorn Technique and Evergreen Spring Art—now fully integrated into his repertoire as an innate divine ability. With just a thought, he could unleash a devastating punch.

"Another means of self-preservation," Chu Ning thought, feeling slightly more at ease about the impending danger.

Over the next half-day, he practiced the Heavenly Fist twice in the backyard. The ability consumed a significant amount of Qi, so he replenished his reserves with Recovery Pills to stay battle-ready. He then reviewed all his spells and talismans, preparing for any potential threat.

The thought of fleeing to the outer sect or inviting Zhuang Yunde for protection crossed his mind, but he dismissed it almost immediately. "You can't hide forever," he reasoned. If the earlier sense of being watched had indeed come from Qi Chongmao, any unusual activity in his courtyard would be noticed. Having Zhuang Yunde present would only deter Qi Chongmao temporarily, and fleeing to the outer sect was only a daytime solution—he'd have to return by nightfall.

Even surrendering the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit to the sect might not guarantee his safety. Unless he was entirely mistaken, a confrontation seemed inevitable.

As night fell, Chu Ning remained in the backyard despite having already harvested the spirit fruit—this was where his Ironvine Thorns were concentrated. Soon, the familiar, unsettling sensation of being watched returned, but it vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving him momentarily puzzled.

Before he could dwell on it, a gust of wind signaled an arrival in the front courtyard. Qi Chongmao was here.

Prepared, Chu Ning gripped several talismans in each hand, his dantian brimming with Qi, ready to strike. Just then, a figure emerged in the moonlight.

Thorn Technique! Chu Ning prepared to cast the binding spell first, but a sudden, sharp pain lanced through his head.

"Argh!" The unexpected agony forced a pained groan from his lips.

"So, you've already plucked the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit," Qi Chongmao's voice, usually amiable, now dripped with venomous glee. "I never imagined you'd be lucky enough to obtain such a treasure."

Chu Ning gritted his teeth as Qi Chongmao continued, his tone laced with greed. "For us of the Qingxi Sect, cultivating and preserving this fruit isn't difficult. But it's unique—its maturation period is mere months, and once picked, its flesh rots upon touching soil, leaving only the seeds. If those seeds aren't extracted and stored in a jade box within a day, they too will decay. Obtaining them is nearly impossible without sheer luck."

"Your luck ends here," Qi Chongmao sneered. "The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit is mine now."

With those words, a barrage of icy blades shot toward Chu Ning!
