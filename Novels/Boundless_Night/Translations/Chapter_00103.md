# Chapter 103: Taking Advantage

The fire spring stained the night mist red. Luofu Immortal Town, its bluestone pavement, eroded by a thousand years, was already pitted and uneven, bearing the mottled marks of antiquity.

"Evening glow" flowed, and Li Qingyue seemed to be cloaked in a sacred radiance. She possessed considerable prestige, and her words carried great weight.

Li Qingxu, clad in purple, subtly changed expression, sensing that something was amiss.

In an instant, a group of Outer Realm disciples murmured, and even those beside Li Qingxu grew uneasy.

"Li Qingyue, this doesn't concern you," Li Qingxu said, holding a shimmering purple bamboo staff, maintaining a calm demeanor.

He realized that an undercurrent seemed to be rising. He already had a sworn enemy provoking him, and Li Qingyue's strong stance at this moment seemed to have swayed the current situation.

"I don't want to repeat those words a second time!" Li Qingyue, in her unblemished white robes, radiated a faint golden glow under the reflection of the fire glow.

"Li Qingxu, if we enter the Spirit Cave, we'll settle an old score," Tang Xumi declared.

"Li Qingxu, a duel in the Spirit Cave tomorrow!" Core disciple Jiang Shengyu stated, offering no reason.

"Count me in too!" Another person declared.

In an instant, many understood. Several core disciples had an unspoken understanding; upon entering the Spirit Cave, they would first eliminate Li Qingxu.

The turn of events surprised many.

Li Qingxu knew that Li Qingyue had swung her sword decisively at a critical moment, thrusting him into a dangerous predicament.

He was well aware that Tang Xumi had no "old score" with him; this was clearly an opportunistic move, giving face to Li Qingyue while eliminating a competitor.

With someone leading the charge, the subsequent core disciples could simply follow suit.

As various parties declared their stance one after another, his situation became perilous.

The Outer Realm disciples who had initially stood by him now remained silent. While no one left, what would happen after entering the Spirit Cave tomorrow was uncertain.

Because no one wanted to oppose the general trend. If those several core disciples truly united, how could they possibly resist?

Li Qingxu said in a deep voice, "They are merely blustering and trying to intimidate us. When we enter that Spirit Cave, we'll take different paths, so we won't be surrounded at all. Even if we encounter a team, it will be difficult for a bloodbath to occur, as everyone knows each other's true objective. For now, their words are not to be taken seriously."

He had to stabilize those around him, otherwise, in the process of contending for a Near-Immortal Object, he would lack helpers and be exhausted from dealing with everything.

"Senior Brother Li, we will certainly do our utmost to help you contend for that legendary item," Zeng Yuan declared.

In the past, he had a good relationship with Qin Ming, but after entering the Outer Realm, he had completely sided with Li Qingxu.

During their last chance encounter at Black and White Mountain, he, like Zheng Maoze, held no goodwill towards Qin Ming.

"Senior Brother Li, please rest assured, we stand with you," another Outer Realm disciple added.

They and the core disciples mutually supported each other; the earlier they chose a side, the better the effect.

Li Qingxu knew that even though these people had declared their support, they might not immediately rally to him upon entering the arena tomorrow; they would likely observe first.

He nodded, appearing very calm, maintaining an air of composure and steadfastness. The more he said, trying to retain anyone, the more counterproductive it would be.

"Alright, that girl is impressive. With just a few words, she nearly toppled a powerful competitor," said an expert from the Outer Realm outside Luofu Immortal Town, nodding.

"If that old senior knew that his newly accepted, exceptionally gifted disciple might be the first to be eliminated, would he fly into a rage?"

"Be quiet, that person cannot be spoken of," someone warned.

That old senior was protective and ruthless, feared by all. The supremely powerful Hegemon was just one of the famous figures he had effortlessly slain. The older he got, the fiercer his temper became.

A young man outside the town spoke up, defending Li Qingxu, saying, "Junior Sister Li, you're being a bit excessive. You haven't even entered the Spirit Cave, yet this is tantamount to making a move in advance."

However, as soon as he finished speaking, he was warned by an old man, "That old disciple, yes, I'm talking about you, immediately shut up and step back!"

The Outer Realm only allowed the contending disciples to stay in the Immortal Town; the events occurring during this period were also a test, and no interference from outside parties was permitted.

The young man was initially a bit bewildered. He was only twenty-four, how was he "old"? At least compared to that old man, he was in the prime of his life.

He dared not retort, docilely stepping back and nervously falling silent.

The old man then pointed to a group of young people, saying, "And you all, a group of old disciples, don't get too close, all of you retreat further!"

This group all wanted to ask, "Who exactly is old?"

Especially Cui Chong, who was among them. His age was similar to the youngsters in Luofu Immortal Town, yet he had lost the qualification to compete and was being called an "old disciple" by a scruffy old man. He walked expressionlessly into the distance.

Inside Luofu Immortal Town, after the initial tense standoff, peace had now settled. Core disciples also began to gather, chatting and laughing.

It was hard to say who was friend and who was foe.

In truth, these were merely formalities; the core disciples had already made contact beforehand. This current display was only to show their followers and boost their confidence.

Qin Ming did not follow Li Qingyue to the Outer Realm disciples but was instead observing those on the New Path, discerning who had cultivated special Heavenly Light Energy.

A small handful of these individuals warranted high vigilance, as even the Outer Realm core disciples dared not underestimate them.

Tathagata's Abandoned Disciple, Five Elements Palace disciples, and the inheritors of Jade Clarity Energy were, at this stage, extremely dangerous individuals.

Undoubtedly, those who relied on physical mutations were also observing each other.

"Brother, if we really meet in the Spirit Cave, we can spar, but don't go for the kill. We're all on the same path, true comrades."

"Understood!"

"Did you see that young man with arms reaching past his knees? His name is He Tai. It's rumored he's cultivated the Great Ape King Fist to an astonishing degree. He even killed an Outer Saint in the nascent stage. He's extremely dangerous and has a violent temper; do not provoke him!"

Qin Ming casually walked around and learned a lot of information.

"He Tai, he was actually invited to assist! This is the top scorer in the grand examination personally selected by the lord of a certain super-city. He could kill an Outer Saint in the nascent stage, and now that he's entered the Outer Manifestation realm, who can be his opponent?"

Instantly, many eyes turned towards He Tai, and discussions about him intensified.

Qin Ming couldn't help but look at him as well, then learned that he was actually the young powerhouse Zheng Family had specifically invited for Zheng Maoze.

"The Great Ape King Energy is a super-composite Heavenly Light Energy, very difficult to cultivate. But He Tai mastered it very early on and is hailed as a future grandmaster of fist techniques, already possessing a certain aura."

Qin Ming listened quietly, remembering this dangerous individual.

"Am I seeing things? Pure Yang Palace actually sent someone!"

Another formidable figure was recognized: Jiang Congyun, a disciple of Pure Yang Palace. This sect's Pure Yang Energy was reputed to be indestructible and overwhelmingly powerful.

This was a young master personally invited by a Thousand-Year Family from Pure Yang Palace for Wang Caiwei.

Many Outer Realm disciples showed surprise. In the Heart Abstinence and Yellow Court realms, they needed to be highly cautious of some special energy techniques, or they would truly suffer greatly.

Pure Yang Energy was exceptionally terrifying; it could burn and shatter consciousness spiritual light!

Wang Caiwei greatly valued Jiang Congyun, keeping him by her side and formally introducing him to the Outer Realm disciples.

"Which one is Tathagata's Abandoned Disciple? Which one is the inheritor of Jade Clarity Energy? And where are the Five Elements Palace disciples? Brother, do you know them? Could you point them out?" Qin Ming asked a burly young man beside him.

"I don't know, they hide very well. I feel like these people could threaten even core disciples."

...

Not just people from the Outer Realm, but also those on other paths, appeared outside Luofu Immortal Town, all closely following this competition.

As for the outside world, many places had already set up betting rings, where people could wager on which Outer Realm core disciple would ultimately win, turning it into a huge business.

"The Jade Clarity Energy inheritor, Tathagata's Abandoned Disciple, Jiang Congyun, Cui Chongxuan, He Tai... Among these specially invited individuals, who can break through the Spirit Cave and laugh last? Will anyone defeat certain core disciples for their employers and claim the Near-Immortal Object?"

"Place your bets! Five Elements Energy, Pure Yang Energy, Six Dominion Energy... Which is weaker, which is stronger? You can gamble on it."

Clearly, not only were core disciples highly anticipated, but those highly skilled in terrifying energy techniques who were specially invited also became betting targets for various bookmakers.

That evening, under the night mist, in many districts of various cities, countless people were discussing and gambling, as if welcoming a grand festival.

Deep into the night, Qin Ming slept holding his mutton-fat jade iron saber, worried about unrest.

By now, all parties were tense and closely watching. Even experts from the Outer Realm and direct descendants of Thousand-Year Families had personally gone to invite people, showing how much importance they placed on this matter.

The night passed without incident. Just before "dawn," as the fire spring fully revived and the covering stone slab was lifted, someone suddenly launched an attack.

At such a critical juncture, someone actually made a move.

"Li Qingxu, I knew you'd come. Why hide?" Li Qingyue pushed open her door, her body radiating a luminous glow that dispelled the night mist.

A figure in front silently shattered a house, then retreated, not engaging Li Qingyue directly.

Because Tang Xumi also appeared and charged over. He whispered, "Should we team up to heavily injure him and drive him away?"

"There's not enough time," Li Qingyue shook her head. The dark figure was standing at the entrance of Luofu Immortal Town. Fighting there, it would be impossible to instantly kill the opponent, and they would be seen by those outside the town.

"He lost the initiative and wanted to raid one of us at night to establish his prestige," Tang Xumi said, then disappeared into the night mist.

At this moment, Qin Ming was fully armored, his golden armor gleaming brightly. He was tall and valiant, carrying twelve short spears on his back and a jade iron saber at his waist.

He already knew that the golden armor crafted by the Outer Realm cultivators was inscribed with special runes that could ward off one fatal blow. After all, the original intention was merely to contend for the Near-Immortal Object, not to incur excessive casualties.

When the runes in the armor erupted, they could form a protective light barrier, allowing defeated individuals to leave the Spirit Cave.

However, there were always exceptions. If someone relentlessly obstructed them, breaking the protective light barrier at all costs, or if the defeated person themselves were unwilling to leave immediately, consuming the duration of the protective light barrier, then there was naturally a possibility of dying permanently in the Spirit Cave.

Li Qingyue took out a thin golden garment from her room. It was very soft and mystical, flowing with delicate and gentle runes.

She whispered, "Wear this too; you can have two layers of protection."

Qin Ming realized this was a specially crafted protective golden garment for core disciples, of excellent quality.

He immediately shook his head. He already had his golden armor. If he also wore Li Qingyue's life-saving item, and she encountered danger, he would truly regret it for life.

"My strength is sufficient; no core disciple can kill me. Moreover, I have Dao-guarding methods. Even if an unforeseen situation arises, I can rush out of the Spirit Cave immediately. You... have only undergone five nascent rebirths so far. I'm not belittling you, but you've only recently embarked on the New Path and need time to accumulate strength at this stage. I'm afraid I might not be able to protect you adequately."

Li Qingyue was very candid, expressing her hidden concerns.

Qin Ming firmly shook his head. Although he was there to help, her offering her life-saving golden garment to him warmed his heart, and he couldn't let her fall into an unpredictable perilous situation.

"If you yourself don't wear the protective golden garment, let's just give up on this competition!" Qin Ming said.

Finally, Li Qingyue returned to her room, put the golden garment on underneath, and then donned a layer of silver armor, instantly looking heroic and exceptionally distinguished.

In the early morning, the dawn light from the fire spring bathed Luofu Immortal Town, dispelling the night mist, making everything radiant.

A group of people set off and soon arrived at the immortal mountain ruins several miles away, walking towards a section of stone caves.

"One group, one path, enter through different passages," an expert from the Outer Realm transmitted.

Qin Ming followed beside Li Qingyue, walking into the stone cave passage. He had expected to go underground, into a gloomy place.

To his surprise, he ultimately stepped into a pine forest, where clear springs trickled, and the light was abundant, as if daytime had returned.

The other three gold-armored guards, like Qin Ming, were also astonished.

Li Qingyue was calm, looking into the distance. On the flat ground outside the pine forest, she saw an acquaintance — Zheng Maoze.

On the other side of the mountain, Li Qingxu walked over, smiling, saying, "What a coincidence, Li Qingyue, I didn't expect us to meet right away!"

He looked at Zheng Maoze and said, "Let's team up and see her off."

Then, he laughed again, as he saw Wang Caiwei appear in the distance with Jiang Congyun, the expert from Pure Yang Palace.

Li Qingxu spoke: "Caiwei, let's three parties together send Immortal Lady Li on her way!"
