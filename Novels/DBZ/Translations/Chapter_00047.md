# Chapter 47: Three Auction Items  

Bai Fugui was already accustomed to Wei Qian's style. His elder brother Wei preferred to contemplate overnight before giving an answer the next day.  

Little did he know, Wei Qian wasn't weighing pros and cons at all—he was using his golden finger, the *Wishing Dragon Pearl*, to perform a form of divination!  

The next day, Wei Qian made a wish to the Dragon Pearl: to ensure his safe return to Wuling Mountain after the auction.  

The Dragon Pearl's response was fifty days!  

"Indeed, auctions in the cultivation world are a minefield. Whoever gets involved is doomed!"  

The danger of hosting this auction was even greater than his previous trip to Danding Immortal City—far greater!  

Upon reflection, Wei Qian understood why. During the Danding Immortal City incident, the enemy's focus had been on the Li family cultivators, paying little attention to an outsider like him.  

But this auction was different—Wei Qian was one of the organizers, and his every move would be scrutinized by the attendees.  

A first-time auction, hosted by an obscure minor cultivation family in an unsafe location...  

With all these negative factors combined, Wei Qian could easily imagine how many rogue cultivators would infiltrate the event.  

As one of the organizers, he would undoubtedly be a prime target in their eyes—a fat sheep ripe for the taking.  

The next day, Wei Qian gave Bai Fugui his answer:  

If the auction was held at Pingyang Lake two months later and featured items that piqued his interest, he would attend.  

Indeed, Wei Qian was interested in the auction—but only mildly so.  

If there weren’t any particularly enticing items, he wouldn’t be motivated enough to make the trip.  

Of course, he wouldn’t forget the fifty-day wish.  

If he did end up going, he needed to ensure the wish was fulfilled in time.  

Pressure breeds motivation.  

To pull Wei Qian into his "team," Bai Fugui went to great lengths, spreading the word among rogue cultivators and scouring for auction items.  

In the blink of an eye, a month slipped by.  

During that time, Bai Fugui actually managed to unearth a few treasures that caught Wei Qian’s attention.  

The first was a hundred-year-old *Purple Monkey Flower*—one of the three main ingredients for refining Foundation Establishment Pills. Unfortunately, it was still slightly immature and couldn’t be used for alchemy yet.  

What Wei Qian truly coveted were its seeds.  

After all, he was a top-tier first-grade spiritual farmer. If he could get his hands on the seeds, growing a batch of Purple Monkey Flowers wouldn’t be difficult.  

The second item was a first-grade peak-tier formation—the *Golden Light Formation*. This was a small-scale formation that could be deployed by a single person. Once activated, it would create a golden barrier capable of withstanding three full-power strikes from a Foundation Establishment cultivator!  

The third was a longbow artifact.  

Though only first-grade upper-tier, an unexpected refinement mishap had endowed it with an additional effect—*Eagle Eye*!  

The current owner had tested it and found that even an elderly man with failing eyesight could hit six out of ten shots with this bow.  

"The rogue cultivators in Yunzhou really have some treasures hidden away."  

"Bai Fugui must’ve gone to great lengths to gather these from who-knows-where," Wei Qian mused, impressed.  

Initially, he hadn’t held high hopes for Bai Fugui’s auction.  

But now, it seemed he had underestimated the young man.  

"In that case, I’ll contribute something to the auction as well."  

Seven days later, Wei Qian emerged from his alchemy chamber with a storage pouch containing twelve *Essence-Boosting Pills*—all of premium quality!  

When Bai Fugui learned of Wei Qian’s contribution, his face lit up with joy.  

First, he was thrilled that Wei Qian was participating. Second—  

"With these Essence-Boosting Pills, those stubborn old-timers who refused to part with their treasures might finally be tempted," Bai Fugui thought gleefully.  

His method of persuading cultivators to contribute items was simple.  

First, he’d tell someone that the auction would feature something they needed.  

Once they were interested, he’d ask them to contribute an item of their own. Then, he’d use that item to attract more participants, creating a snowball effect.  

By the end, what was initially planned as a small auction had grown far beyond expectations. At first, Bai Fugui had hoped to attract fifty participants.  

But by the time invitations were sent out, the number had surpassed two hundred!  

Three days before the auction, the final tally of invitations exceeded three hundred!  

On that day, Wei Qian took leave from Wuling Mountain and set off for Pingyang Lake.  

Pingyang Lake spanned eight hundred *li*, making it the largest lake in Yunzhou’s Daze County. Its abundant resources sustained millions of people in the surrounding area.  

The lake’s breathtaking scenery had drawn countless scholars and travelers over the centuries—as well as many immortals.  

Legends of celestial beings appearing at the lake were common throughout history.  

Recently, those legends had become reality.  

Over the past half-month, fishermen and lakeside villagers had frequently witnessed streaks of light streaking across the sky.  

Naturally, mortals seeking immortality flocked to Pingyang Lake in hopes of encountering an immortal’s favor.  

This had even spawned an industry.  

When Wei Qian arrived at Pingyang Lake after traveling a thousand *li*, this was the scene that greeted him.  

"My family has fished Pingyang Lake for three generations—our boats are the safest!"  

"I’ve seen an immortal’s traces three times! Board my boat for the best chance at immortality!"  

"My ancestors once served an immortal! Help me, and I’ll repay you if I gain immortality!"  

The fishermen had abandoned their trade, instead ferrying hopeful seekers for profit.  

"I was planning to just hire a boat, but this complicates things," Wei Qian muttered, walking along the shore. The boats were so crowded that finding a suitable one was difficult.  

Some boat owners, eager for money, packed a dozen people onto tiny vessels, seemingly unconcerned about capsizing mid-lake.  

Wei Qian had no intention of squeezing onto one of those.  

"Fine, I’ll just find a secluded spot and fly in on my artifact," he decided.  

As he turned to leave, a voice—both strange and familiar—called out to him.  

"Brother Wei, is that you?"  

Wei Qian turned back and spotted a middle-aged man on the shore.  

After rifling through his memories—aided by a cultivator’s sharp recall—he finally placed the face.  

"Brother Yuan! It’s been a long time."  

This was someone he had known during his days in the martial world, before stepping onto the immortal path.  

He had assumed their paths would never cross again. Yet here they were, meeting by chance.
