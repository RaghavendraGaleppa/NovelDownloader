# Chapter 4: The Masculine Me  

"Damn it! How dare you fight back!"  

"Let's get him! Beat him up!"  

The remaining youths were furious, brandishing their wooden sticks as they surrounded Jiang Li.  

However, Jiang Li completely shattered their perception of him as weak and cowardly. Instead of cowering and begging for mercy, he charged straight at them.  

His speed was astonishing. Closing the distance to one of them in an instant, he delivered a powerful straight kick. The boy reacted quickly, raising his stick to block.  

With a crisp crack, Jiang Li's kick snapped the stick in half and continued unimpeded into the boy's abdomen, lifting him off the ground before sending him flying, following the fate of the first youth.  

"You're dead! You're dead! How dare you attack Li Chao! Our Li family has four generations of nobility and countless soldiers! You and your entire family are finished!"  

The one who had been knocked down seemed to hold a high status in the secular world. Several of the Li family youths immediately turned red with rage, spewing bloodthirsty threats and curses at Jiang Li.  

They threw down their sticks and reached for the swords at their waists.  

But Jiang Li wasn't about to give them the chance. He leaped forward, striking out with his sheathed sword, aiming for their heads. Before they could draw their weapons, they were already on the ground, bleeding and unable to get up.  

After kicking their weapons away and delivering an extra kick to each of their stomachs, Jiang Li turned his gaze to the last two still standing.  

They had managed to draw their swords but were too terrified to approach, frozen in place, unsure of what to do.  

"You!... How are you so strong? You weren't like this before!"  

A boy who had once been weak and helpless, easily beaten half to death by them, had suddenly gained such strength that he defeated them as effortlessly as bullying children.  

This was something the seven of them, who had always been the strongest group in the caravan, couldn't accept.  

"Jiang Li, it was Wang Lin and Li Chao who led the previous incidents. It had nothing to do with us."  

"You've already offended the Wang and Li families. Now that you've vented your anger, let us go. We can forget everything that happened before. We promise to plead for leniency on your behalf. Otherwise, you and your family are finished!"  

Seeing Jiang Li's cold gaze, the two took a step back, trying to intimidate him with their usual tactics of leveraging their family's influence.  

"Oh? Is that so? Right now, we're already two kingdoms away from the Hongyan capital. If you have the means to send word back, go ahead and try."  

Jiang Li advanced step by step, their threats utterly ineffective.  

The two youths retreated in fear, one of them tripping over a tree root and falling to the ground.  

Jiang Li seized the opportunity, stepping forward and striking their swords from their hands with two swift blows of his own.  

Then, like a tiger's claw, he grabbed their right arms. Two crisp snaps later, their arms hung limply at their sides.  

These pampered young masters had never experienced such excruciating pain. They immediately collapsed, clutching their arms and rolling on the ground, howling in agony, spinning faster than overturned dung beetles.  

Only after Jiang Li gave them two more vicious strikes with the scabbard did they finally quiet down, tears and snot streaming down their faces.  

"I suggest you stop lying there pretending to be dead. Especially you—the one who wanted to break my legs earlier. I'll count to ten. If you don't get up and kneel before me by then, I'll break all your legs!"  

"One... two... three... Hah, seems you all have quite the backbone."  

Jiang Li counted to three, but none of the seven made a move. They just lay on the ground, glaring up at him with hatred.  

Their expressions said it all: *I'll never kneel. I don't believe you'd dare do anything to me.*  

"You're all quite something. What gave you the illusion that I'm some kind-hearted pushover?"  

He picked up a head-sized rock from the ground and walked over to Wang Lin, the one who had been the most vocal and led the beating against him.  

The rock came down—*thud! Crack!*  

Wang Lin's leg bent at an unnatural angle, sharp bone fragments even piercing through the skin from the back.  

His body instinctively tried to curl up to cradle the broken limb, but Jiang Li pressed a foot against his chest, pinning him down.  

All he could do was scream and claw at the ground.  

"Don't rush. There are still two more legs. Once I've broken them all, you can scream to your heart's content."  

"No! No! I was wrong! Jiang Li, I was wrong! I'll kneel! I'll apologize! I'll die! Aaaah!"  

Wang Lin's screams were heart-wrenching. The others were equally shaken, a deep fear rising in their hearts.  

"He's serious! He really plans to break all our legs!"  

A group of thirteen- or fourteen-year-old spoiled brats couldn't handle this. They were used to bullying others, but words like "unyielding" had never applied to them.  

They immediately surrendered, joining Wang Lin—who was now dragging a broken leg—in kneeling obediently before Jiang Li.  

"Tell me, were you wrong?"  

Jiang Li smirked, holding his sword.  

"We were wrong! We were wrong! Jiang Li, we were blind before. We offended you... We're sorry..."  

Their apologies were half-hearted and scattered.  

"Good, good. Admitting your mistakes makes you good kids. I accept your apologies. Now, young masters, what price are you willing to pay to redeem your legs?"  

Jiang Li grinned as he eyed their bulging pouches, which undoubtedly held some valuable items.  

"As payment, hand over your jade tokens and spirit stones!"  

If it hadn't been for Yan Hong's help earlier, his own jade token would have been taken by these guys. Now that it was time for revenge, he wasn't about to let them off easily.  

At the mention of jade tokens and spirit stones, they immediately grew agitated, their eyes widening in disbelief.  

"But... didn't you say if we apologized, you'd let us go?"  

Li Chao, another member of the Li family, couldn't help but protest.  

After all, spirit stones were items from the cultivation world. Even if a few occasionally made their way into the mortal realm, they were treasures beyond compare.  

The seven of them combined might not even have ten.  

"Let you go? Back when you were beating me, I apologized too, didn't I? Did you let me go then? My patience is limited. If you refuse, I can just kill you first and take the spirit stones afterward."  

Jiang Li raised the rock again.  

After much deliberation, the five boys—excluding Wang Lin and Li Chao—decided that two years as menial disciples still left them a chance to recover. But if their legs (or worse) were broken now, they might not survive the rest of the journey.  

Gritting their teeth, they each pulled out a small pouch and handed it to Jiang Li.  

"I'll give you one more chance. If I find anything else during a search, trust me, you'll regret it."  

At these words, two of them paled. After some thought, they realized hiding anything was futile and reluctantly pulled out additional items, placing them in their palms.  

Jiang Li counted. As expected, each had a jade token, but there were only three spirit stones in total.  

"Good. Now I'll give you another choice."  

He gestured to the five who had already submitted. Wang Lin and Li Chao, who had been silent with their heads bowed, suddenly felt a sense of foreboding.  

"Honestly, your jade tokens are useless to me. Right now, those two still have five legs between them. Break one leg each, and I'll return your jade tokens."  

"Think about it. Two years as menial disciples, or becoming immortals right away. The choice is yours."  

Jiang Li's words were like a demon's whisper. In an instant, the five boys' gazes toward Wang Lin and Li Chao changed.  

"Hey! Hey! What are you thinking?!... He's trying to turn us against each other!... I'm the legitimate heir! If you dare lay a hand on me, my father will never let you off!"  

Their words only fueled the others' anger.  

*Because you're the legitimate heirs, we've had to act as your lackeys, ordered around like dogs! It was you who caused this mess, yet we're the ones paying for it!*  

*We're hundreds of miles from the Hongyan Kingdom now—not even a bird could fly back! And you still think you can lord your status over us?!*  

*Once we become immortals, the entire Hongyan Kingdom will be beneath our notice. Why should we fear you, a mere heir?*  

The angrier they grew, the bolder they became. Some even started picking up rocks from the ground.  

"Wait! Jiang Li! I'll hand over the spirit stones! I'll give them to you!"  

"Too late for that now!"  

One after another, agonized screams rang out from the woods, leaving the other boys and girls in the caravan exchanging bewildered glances, unsure of what was happening.  

At first, they assumed Jiang Li was being subjected to some inhuman torture again.  

But the screams clearly came from several different voices. They couldn't begin to imagine what was going on.  

A long while later, under the watchful eyes of fifty or sixty aspiring cultivators, Jiang Li emerged from the woods first, carrying a bundle of swords. He looked energetic and his clothes were neat—nothing like someone who had just been brutalized.  

Behind him, the five remaining members of the Wang and Li families, covered in dirt and dragging the still-wailing Wang Lin and Li Chao, stumbled out of the woods.  

Seeing them all injured and keeping a fearful distance from Jiang Li, the onlookers immediately understood: they had been the ones to suffer this time. Jiang Li—the "scoundrel"—had won!  

No, now that Jiang Li had won, he should be addressed as "Young Master Jiang."  

As Jiang Li approached, the crowd instinctively parted for him.  

He walked up to Yan Hong, picked out the best sword from the bundle, and handed it back with a word of thanks. Then, carrying his spoils, he returned to his carriage without another word.  

Only then did he finally let out a long sigh of relief.  

It seemed his actions hadn't crossed the boundaries set by the three cultivators.  

That night, when his training had offended them, their response had been surprisingly mild, though he couldn't be sure of their thoughts.  

From this, he could deduce that the three cultivators leaned more toward the lawful good alignment.  

With people like that, Jiang Li had been worried one of them might take issue with his methods.  

Even if they didn't, killing one-tenth of the caravan's aspiring cultivators was absolutely out of the question.  

If recruiting new disciples was part of the "immortals'" mission, then interfering with that mission would earn him a swift and brutal death.  

So, even with ample justification for revenge, he hadn't gone too far.  

In the end, he had used the jade tokens to turn the seven against each other, dealing with the ringleaders.  

This not only fractured their unity, reducing future trouble, but also spread the blame around. Even if the overseeing cultivators were displeased, the punishment would be lighter.  

Now, it seemed his actions had indeed stayed within their tolerance.  

Time to examine the spoils.  

Eight spirit stones in total—five more had been found on Wang Lin and Li Chao.  

Two jade tokens, currently useless, but he might find a way to sell them later.  

A bit of gold and silver, worth keeping since the mortal world was still the foundation of the cultivation world.  

And three bottles of pills.  

One was an internal injury medicine. After scanning it with his appraisal skill, Jiang Li swallowed over a dozen pills at once.  

[Consumed Golden Toad Pills. Slow Healing effect applied to self.]  
[Slow Healing: Recovers 2 HP per hour for 4 hours.] (-+)  
[Overconsumption of Golden Toad Pills. Enhanced Healing effect applied to self.]  
[Enhanced Healing: Recovers 4 HP per hour for 6 hours.] (-+)  

The successive notifications surprised Jiang Li. Apparently, some medicines could be taken in excess of the normal dosage.  

For ordinary people, overdosing was both wasteful and potentially harmful.  

But for him, it was another simple way to boost benefits.  

Holding the prompt for five seconds, he made Enhanced Healing a permanent state. Then he turned his attention to the other two bottles.  

A quick appraisal revealed their names: Dragon Essence Tiger Vigor Six-Flavor Pills... The name sounded suspiciously like a bedroom aid.  

These two really were scoundrels, bringing such things on a journey to seek immortality—one bottle each, no less. Truly... they deserved what they got.  

This single status effect directly increased his Constitution attribute. Indeed, a man ought to be masculine!  

*Knock knock knock—*  

A soft tapping came at the door.  

Jiang Li opened the small wooden door of the carriage to find an unfamiliar girl peering in shyly.  

"Jiang Li... I saw you didn't eat dinner, so... if you don't mind, please have mine."  

She handed him a wooden tray. Apart from a small portion of the steamed bun being missing, the roasted meat and thick soup were untouched.  

"Thank you."  

Jiang Li accepted the tray and stepped out to express his gratitude.  

"You're welcome. My name is... my name is... Ah!"  

Before she could finish, the girl suddenly blushed, covered her eyes, and ran off.  

Puzzled, Jiang Li looked down and realized—  

Changing from a seated to a standing position had caused... certain adjustments.
