# Chapter 83: Fireball Divine Cult

“God said, let there be light!”

Bai Jialie gently flapped his wings, extended a finger, and spoke with devout reverence. The white-robed figures behind him also extended their fingers.

*Buzz!*

Space vibrated as a milky white pillar of light descended from the heavens, completely enveloping the golden array formed by the eight ancient ships.

The pillar of light did not appear to possess great destructive power; instead, it exuded an incredibly sacred aura. Yet, the golden array enveloped by it melted away layer by layer, like snow under the sun.

The ancient ships vibrated uncontrollably, their outer arrays cracking. Zhou Tian’s brow furrowed deeply. He himself might not care, but Tian Ling and Zhou Zui beside him only had one life. If they perished here, it would be truly over.

Inside the Mechanical War Buddha, the black-gold mecha’s pilot also wore a grim expression. A tearing sensation constantly emanated from all parts of his body, and his mind felt hazy—a consequence of overusing his divine soul. The Mechanical War Buddha was merely a semi-finished product; its integrated AI could not support the calculations for the entire body, thus requiring his cooperation, which placed a tremendous burden on his divine soul.

Observing the urgent situation with the ancient ships, he knew these were seed-level talents from various major powers. In the future, the worst among them would grow into Great Emperor-level experts, and most would reach even higher realms. Losing them here would be a colossal blow.

Moreover, the Dao Master was eyeing him like a tiger, not expending too great a cost to deal with him. After all, he wasn’t a true Dao Master; he was merely fighting by leveraging the Mechanical War Buddha. The opponent only needed to restrain him, neutralize his attacks, and wait patiently for him to inevitably collapse.

Various considerations flashed through his mind. The black-gold mecha’s pilot gritted his teeth, and the energy furnace hummed. Inside it was a golden crystal, only the size of a fist, yet it provided energy for the entire Mechanical War Buddha.

*Click-clack!*

Nine mechanical magic orbs, as massive as stars, transformed into individual mechanical parts, surging towards the Dao Master’s Dharma Body.

The Dao Master’s towering Dharma Body surged with immense magical power. A pair of crimson flame divine wings ignited with fire, and the bronze divine spear brandished, constantly batting away parts. However, more mechanical parts swarmed in, circling him to form a cage that trapped him.

*Clank!*

Several chains of order pierced through his crimson wings, locking him firmly. Lightning crackled along the chains, and golden runes shimmered. Complex symbols flashed across the cage, imbued with a powerful sealing force.

Without hesitation, though the Dao Master appeared to be sealed, the pilot knew it was only temporary.

*Buzz!*

The entire body of the Mechanical War Buddha vibrated, and blue light seeped from its seams. Metal parts detached and flew towards the eight ancient ships.

“Do you take me for a non-entity?”

The Dao Master snorted coldly, his vital energy erupting. His crimson flame divine wings spread out for a thousand zhang, and fire dragons roared. The chains were shattered, and the external metal cage trembled uncontrollably, on the verge of collapse.

The black-gold mecha reappeared in the void, its obsidian-like metal shell riddled with cracks, and scarlet blood dripped from them.

Golden afterburners flared from the back of the black-gold mecha, propelling the entire machine towards the Dao Master. Simultaneously, the energy furnace in its abdomen began to operate under heavy load, its light intensifying.

“Blazing Sun Furnace!”

A resolute voice came from beneath the faceplate. The energy core in its abdomen glowed as brilliantly as a sun, emitting磅礴 energy fluctuations. This was a desperate move: under autonomous control, the mecha’s energy core overloaded, instantly unleashing all its energy to create unimaginable power. However, due to the mecha’s internal mechanisms, if this were done, the pilot would also be unable to escape such a massive energy reaction.

Zhou Tian’s gaze sharpened. He could tell that the black-gold mecha pilot’s self-detonation was to buy time. He didn’t have many skills; Holy Word had already been used, leaving only Blaze Bomb as an offensive skill. However, it could be dodged. He didn’t believe that experts at the Heavenly King and Dao Master levels couldn’t evade those fast-flying small fireballs.

But now, the Dao Master seemed to be sealed, presenting a prime opportunity. Without further hesitation, Zhou Tian focused his mind.

In the void, seven crimson flame fireballs, hundreds of zhang in size, appeared out of nowhere. The internal temperature was incredibly high, so much so that the color of the flames subtly turned golden.

“Holy crap, so these fireballs change based on the target’s strength!”

Zhou Tian secretly marveled at the seven sun-sized fireballs in the void. Last time, targeting a wooden table, the fireballs were only fist-sized. This time, with a Dao Master as the target, the special effects of these fireballs had become incredibly impressive.

Everyone in the void stared dumbfounded at the sudden appearance of the seven fireballs. No one knew how they appeared; there were no spiritual energy fluctuations, they simply materialized abruptly. Yet, everyone could sense the terrifying power they contained.

*Whoosh!*

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, the seven fireballs moved in unison, their target precisely the Dao Master sealed within the cage. Not only had their visual effects been greatly enhanced, but their speed had also increased significantly.

Bai Jialie and the others’ expressions changed. Holy Swords, Thunder Hammers, and drops of Yellow Springs Water fell, along with boundless shadows engulfing the area.

*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Four fireballs were detonated, transforming into a sky full of fire rain that dissipated. But three more continued to fly forward. The purple-robed Daoist and the two others also reacted, forcefully unleashing their divine abilities to block the divine arts and techniques of Bai Jialie and his group, who sought to destroy the remaining fireballs.

The Dao Master’s eyes were like ice. His white hair bristled into the void as he brandished the divine spear in his hand. The cage was covered in cracks, on the verge of shattering, but it ultimately held.

*Boom!*

The black-gold mecha slammed into the cage. Although it was blocked by the Dao Master’s crimson flame divine wings, the massive energy explosion still enveloped him.

At the same time, the remaining three Blaze Bomb fireballs directly impacted the Dao Master’s body, exploding immediately.

The entire void was destroyed. The starry sky crumbled, and stars fell. This was the Heavenly King-grade mecha’s ultimate trump card. Unlike human cultivators, the energy furnaces in such mechas contained immense latent energy, and when unleashed in an instant, even a Dao Master could not underestimate it.

The Blaze Bomb skill description stated it would deal 5% of the designated target’s current health. Zhou Tian didn’t know how this 5% damage was calculated, as this world wasn’t a game with digitized health bars. But since the system said it dealt 5% health, then it was 5% health. The Undying System was quite reliable.

When the dust settled, the crimson flame divine wings shrouding the Dao Master’s front had a large hole, but as they were merely energy manifestations, they were slowly repairing themselves. His purple armor was largely shattered, and there were cracks on his Dharma Body. Golden blood flowed from the corner of his mouth, and the beast head on his chest armor was also broken. His eyes seemed to spew fire. Although the black-gold mecha’s self-detonation was powerful, it at most caused him a bit of trouble. However, the subsequent, bizarre fireballs contained a strange power of laws, capable of bypassing his defensive divine abilities and directly corroding his body.
