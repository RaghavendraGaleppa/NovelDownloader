# Chapter 77: Inventory Check  

After examining the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Technique*, Li Shiming placed the *Sword Control Art* jade slip against his forehead.  

The *Sword Control Art* was the most expensive sword cultivation technique available for Qi Refinement cultivators, and this was reflected in its requirements. The technique demanded a longsword magical artifact with 100% mastery.  

This condition might seem simple, but it was actually extremely difficult to achieve.  

Take the *Blazing Flame Sword* as an example—despite Li Shiming repeatedly using the *Dragon-Dotting Technique* to deepen their connection, he had only achieved around 50% mastery.  

And this was with the *Dragon-Dotting Technique* being exceptionally effective in refining magical artifacts. If he had used other methods, he might not have even reached 10% mastery in the same amount of time.  

Those stories where someone picks up a divine weapon and immediately dominates the battlefield? Impossible in the cultivation world.  

No matter how powerful a magical artifact is, if it isn’t refined, it’s just a sharp ordinary weapon.  

The more thoroughly it is refined, the greater the wielder’s control over it, and the more power it can unleash.  

Ordinary combat techniques might not require much, but high-level techniques—especially those demanding precise control—have extremely strict mastery requirements.  

The *Sword Control Art*, being the pinnacle of sword cultivation techniques for Qi Refinement, naturally required the highest level of weapon mastery.  

Li Shiming copied the *Sword Control Art* into his IBMz15, creating a document labeled as such.  

As for practicing the technique, he would have to wait until his mastery over the *Blazing Flame Sword* improved.  

He chose the *Blazing Flame Sword* over the standard-issue low-grade longsword he had just received because the latter only enhanced sharpness, making it inferior in quality.  

He also had a mid-grade and a high-grade longsword, but given his current cultivation level, even using a mid-grade artifact was somewhat taxing.  

Take the *Azure Kite Wooden Sword*, for instance. Despite undergoing the same number of *Dragon-Dotting Technique* refinements over the same period, his mastery over it was still less than 5%.  

While he wouldn’t abandon refining the *Azure Kite Wooden Sword*, if he wanted to start practicing the *Sword Control Art* sooner, choosing a lower-quality low-grade sword was the best option.  

Once he improved his mastery over the *Azure Kite Wooden Sword* and his cultivation advanced, he could always switch to it later.  

That said, none of his current swords truly satisfied him. It wasn’t that his standards were too high—it was just that, after learning his primary elemental affinity was metal, he wondered if he should find a metal-attributed longsword.  

The *Azure Kite Wooden Sword* was excellent, but it was a wood-attributed high-grade artifact.

Li Shiming then retrieved the storage pouch of the Profound Nether Sect cultivator slain by Elder Cui. He hadn’t opened it on the flying boat.  

The pouch had a five-cubic-meter capacity, fitting for a Profound Nether Sect cultivator at the late Qi Refinement stage.  

He inspected it carefully, wary of the sect’s infamous tricks—poisons and smoke bombs were common.  

Fortunately, the pouch was neatly organized, free of any repulsive items.  

There were two bottles of unknown pills, pitch-black in color. Whether they were poisonous or beneficial was unclear.  

Ingesting something like this would require considerable courage.  

A disc-shaped object caught his attention. Li Shiming’s eyes lit up—he recognized this! It was an array disk.  

No longer a novice, he picked it up and cast the *Dragon-Dotting Technique*, performing both the "dragon-painting" and "eye-dotting" steps. Soon, he learned the array’s name and usage method.  

*Profound Nether Shadow Veil Array*—a concealment array that masked the user’s aura.  

It was similar to the isolation array in his room, but while the latter relied on the overarching formation of the Clear Autumn Pavilion, the *Profound Nether Shadow Veil Array* could be deployed anywhere to isolate an area.  

The downside was that the array worked best in darkness or dimly lit places. When activated, it created a shroud of black mist, making it glaringly obvious in broad daylight.  

Still, the array was useful, so Li Shiming stored it in his own pouch.  

Though it was a Profound Nether Sect artifact, it was the cleanest of his spoils—Elders Cui, Zhao, and Dai could all vouch for its origin.  

Of course, this didn’t mean he could use it recklessly, but at least he could explain himself if the sect questioned him.  

"What’s this?" His fingers brushed against a black banner. As he probed it with his spiritual sense, terrifying wails echoed from within.  

Shadows flickered across the banner’s surface. His heart skipped a beat, but fortunately, the shadows couldn’t escape the banner, and since it was inside the storage pouch, it posed no immediate threat.  

The banner was so eerie that he didn’t dare take it out, let alone attempt refining it with the *Dragon-Dotting Technique*.  

This was likely the item Elder Cui had warned him about. At the very least, he needed to identify it before deciding what to do. He set it aside and moved on to the next item.  

This one was a box covered in sealing runes, clearly designed to prevent whatever was inside from leaking any aura.
