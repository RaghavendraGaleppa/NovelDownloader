# Chapter 9: Body-Nourishing Thunder  

For the next month, Han Yue settled into a routine at the Meat Distribution District.  

During the day, he would roam the city with Xiao Liu as his guide. Under Xiao Liu's direction, Han Yue visited many unique workshops, though they frequented the trading houses most often. The dazzling array of goods broadened his horizons.  

Every day, Han Yue participated in at least one Meat Distribution Ceremony, accumulating a considerable stock of demon beast meat. His physical foundation grew steadily stronger.  

At night, Han Yue devoted himself to studying the scriptures of *Body-Nourishing Thunder*, meticulously translating each character of the runes and comprehending their meanings. He wanted to ensure he fully grasped the essence of the scripture before beginning his cultivation.  

After a month of contemplation, Han Yue felt confident he had mastered the method of practicing *Body-Nourishing Thunder*. He was ready for his first attempt.  

Secluded in his room, Han Yue began his cultivation. He channeled the thunderous power of *Thoughtless Slash*, gathering it in his dantian. Following the scripture's guidance, he started constructing the runic symbols stroke by stroke.  

The process was far from easy. The runes were intricate, with numerous strokes, and controlling the flickering, erratic thunder energy with his will proved challenging. Han Yue could only persist through repeated attempts.  

Fortunately, after a month of accumulation, the divine power within the *Thoughtless Slash* rune was nearly overflowing, giving him ample room for trial and error.  

Time passed as Han Yue cycled between condensing and expending energy. With each failure, he grew more attuned to the process. Though unsuccessful, the runes he formed became increasingly complete. His mind remained calm, unwavering in his belief that he would succeed.  

Finally, after consuming most of the stored power from *Thoughtless Slash*, a complex and exquisite runic symbol took shape within his dantian—*Body-Nourishing Thunder* had been successfully initiated!  

As soon as the rune formed, it began absorbing the accumulated energy within Han Yue's body and the ambient thunder qi from the surroundings. Eventually, the first wisp of thunder energy naturally manifested in his dantian.  

This small step in *Body-Nourishing Thunder* marked a giant leap in Han Yue's cultivation. For the first time, he could independently absorb external qi and generate his own mana.  

Han Yue was deeply gratified—he was now a true first-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

With this initial success, Han Yue soon condensed a second rune, slightly increasing the speed at which he generated and stored thunder energy.  

The subsequent practice of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* involved continuously condensing runes and accumulating mana. As Han Yue formed more runes, he guided the generated thunder energy into the *Thoughtless Slash* rune.  

*Thoughtless Slash* effortlessly absorbed Han Yue's mana, refining it into a higher-grade thunder energy for storage. A complete energy cycle formed within his body: *Body-Nourishing Thunder* produced mana, while *Thoughtless Slash* refined, processed, and stored it.  

Han Yue's body became like a bottomless pit, voraciously devouring the surrounding qi. With each additional rune, his absorption rate increased. Thanks to the conversion and storage capabilities of his divine rune, the amount of qi Han Yue absorbed far surpassed that of ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

This vast reserve of qi would serve as the foundation for his future growth.  

After a night of cultivation, Han Yue had condensed four *Body-Nourishing Thunder* runes. However, the mana generated was still insufficient to fully replenish *Thoughtless Slash*. His body remained largely empty, but Han Yue knew his cultivation was no longer rootless. With consistent effort, he would soon be brimming with mana.  

Han Yue retrieved *The Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws* and updated his information:

Compared to a month ago, *Thoughtless Slash* had seen significant progress.  

Emerging from his seclusion, Han Yue felt the accumulated energy from consuming demon beast meat over the past month had been completely depleted. His body signaled its hunger. Without hesitation, he headed straight for the central square.  

At the square, the Huang (Yellow) No. 17 Yard was in the midst of butchering a first-stage Barren Earth Boar, with about a fifth already processed. Han Yue quickly approached the yard's master and requested to join the butchering team.  

He asked not for currency but for a larger share of the meat. The master of Huang No. 17 Yard readily agreed.  

Han Yue immediately stepped forward with his *Gengjin Blade Embryo*, slicing through the meat with even greater speed than before. Over the past month, he had built a reputation in the Meat Distribution District as "Han the Swift Blade," the chief butcher of Tian (Heaven) No. 9 Yard, known for his sharp techniques and efficiency—and for never demanding extra payment.  

With Han Yue's help, the butchering concluded swiftly. The master of Huang No. 17 Yard, delighted, invited Han Yue to his residence to enjoy the boar's brain and kidneys. Han Yue politely declined—his appetite was too enormous to impose as a guest.  

Instead, he carried a massive one-ton slab of tenderloin back to his quarters. Summoning Xiao Liu, he set up a two-meter-long grill, lit the charcoal, and began roasting the meat.  

Han Yue devoured slice after slice, feeling his body's depletion gradually replenish. The *Body-Nourishing Thunder* runes within him continued generating mana tirelessly. To Han Yue, these runes were like power generators, working day and night to produce energy. He had to ensure their fuel supply never ran short.  

Soon, the entire ton of pork was consumed. Han Yue successfully condensed his fifth *Body-Nourishing Thunder* rune, and *Thoughtless Slash*'s mana reserves reached about 60%.  

Feeling his steady progress, Han Yue was filled with a sense of security. His goal for the coming period was clear: continue gathering resources, condensing runes, and accumulating mana.
