# Chapter 49: The Water-Avoiding Shuttle  

The moon hung like frost in the sky, and the night wind was biting.  

The night was hauntingly beautiful, but Wang Chan had no mind to appreciate it. The eerie howls that rose and fell from all directions sent chills down his spine, yet he paid them little heed.  

With a slight bow of his head, he moved swiftly along the wild mountain paths like a nimble deer or horse, leaving behind fleeting afterimages. A layer of protective mana and a mid-grade defensive talisman shielded his body.  

This was his first time traveling at night, and he dared not be careless. While maintaining his defenses, he also channeled his physical strength to enhance his speed. Two low-grade Swift Movement Talismans, each with three layers of restriction, were affixed to his legs, granting him the swiftness of flight.  

This method not only allowed for rapid movement but also conserved his mana, ensuring he remained in peak condition to handle any unforeseen dangers along the way.  

At the moment, he wore a White Ghost Mask, transforming his appearance into that of an unremarkable man in green robes, his aura slightly coarse. A white jade pendant hung around his neck, concealed beneath his clothing.  

Hidden in his robes were two mid-grade defensive talismans, wrapped in mana and ready to be activated with a mere thought. In his left sleeve were two white needles, while three black needles were tucked into his right sleeve. Beneath his feet, a low-grade Earthwalk Talisman lay hidden on each sole.  

Inside his storage pouch, the Butterfly Daggers rested quietly in a pre-prepared case, ready to be summoned with a flick of his divine sense.  

Most importantly, Wang Chan's mind remained connected to the restrictions of his Water-Fire Escape Technique and the divine patterns of Dragon's Essence and Tiger's Vigor. Should he encounter a powerful enemy, he could either counterattack or flee immediately.  

Though he had arrived at the Youlin Mountain by afternoon, the mountain stretched for a hundred miles. To his frustration, towering Spirit Locust Trees dotted the landscape at irregular intervals, making it impossible to identify which one served as the entrance to the black market.  

Unfazed, he found a secluded cave, consumed some spirit liquid, and meditated to restore his energy. Only when night fell did he take out the black market token.  

By then, the ghostly face on the token had vanished, replaced by a glowing map of Youlin Mountain with a flickering black dot. According to the jade slip left by Madam Cheng, the black dot marked the location of a Spirit Locust Tree that served as an entrance to the black market.  

It was said that Youlin Mountain was just one of eight black markets scattered around the wilderness near White Mountain City. This particular one had allegedly been overseen by a Foundation Establishment cultivator in secret for over a century, making it a long-standing establishment.  

As for which faction backed it, Wang Chan didn’t know. But he was certain the Enforcement Hall had a hand in it—otherwise, the black market would have been shut down long ago, no matter how well-hidden it was.  

Unlike regular markets or trading posts, the black market opened only three times a year, each time for just three days. The information was tightly controlled, and without an invitation or a specialized token, entry was impossible.  

Once inside, however, one could freely trade items that were otherwise forbidden in the open—all transactions were thoroughly scrubbed clean of any traceable connections afterward.  

Moreover, rare treasures unavailable in regular markets could be found here, including uncommon artifacts, pills, and formations—low-grade, mid-grade, and even high-grade items occasionally surfaced.  

For those with deep connections, there was even a chance to trade for secret techniques or cultivation methods—though such opportunities were exceedingly rare.  

After the time it took an incense stick to burn, Wang Chan estimated he was about thirty miles from the black dot on his token.  

Emerging from the forest, he found himself before a wide, nameless river flowing silently from the depths of Youlin Mountain. Instinctively, he followed its winding banks, navigating the rugged terrain toward his destination.  

Though the river's curves lengthened his journey, he didn’t mind. As a body cultivator, endurance was his forte. Besides, the black market wouldn’t open until midnight, and it was only the beginning of the Hour of the Boar—even if he had to travel an extra dozen miles, an hour would be more than enough.  

As he drew closer to the black market, he noticed more cultivators in the area. Some flew past on magical artifacts, others rode spirit beasts, while a few, like him, traveled on foot.  

Most were solitary travelers, with only a few moving in small groups. The majority were mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, with a smattering of early-stage practitioners. Late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators were a rare sight.  

Contrary to his expectations, he encountered no ambushes or robberies. Instead, the cultivators here seemed to follow an unspoken rule—when they spotted one another from a distance, they instinctively kept apart. If they accidentally drew too close, they would first size each other up, exchange nods, and then part ways.  

Wang Chan crossed paths with several such groups.  

Once, he even encountered a late-stage Qi Condensation female cultivator in a floral dress. Though she wore a mask, what struck him was that she didn’t look down on him for his lower cultivation. Instead, she seemed wary.  

Before he could retreat, she stared at him intently, hastily backing away a hundred paces before turning to leave.  

Wang Chan wondered if she was truly a late-stage cultivator.  

Another time, he ran into a group of mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. Relying on their numbers, they acted arrogantly, casting spells from afar to intimidate him into stepping aside.  

Though their methods were crude, their spells landed harmlessly in empty space—clearly meant only as a warning.  

Unfazed, Wang Chan clenched his fist and struck a nearby boulder. With a thunderous boom, a black fist-shadow erupted, and moments later, the boulder crumbled into dust, scattering in the wind.  

The group stiffened at the sight, recognizing the power of a mid-grade divine ability. After a tense moment, one of them cupped his hands in salute before leading the others away.  

Half a cup of tea later, Wang Chan mused, "These cultivators are heading in different directions—there must be multiple entrances to the black market."  

Just then—  

A sudden surge erupted from the river beside him. Towering waves, dozens of feet high, crashed toward him.  

Reacting swiftly, Wang Chan dodged the onslaught while summoning three Butterfly Daggers from his storage pouch. The blades circled around him, poised to strike.  

From within the waves, a blue shuttle shot out, smashing through several trees before skidding to a halt against a massive boulder.  

Inside the shuttle’s shimmering blue barrier, a disheveled man in black and a woman in white clung to each other, their clothes in disarray.  

Wang Chan relaxed slightly—they didn’t seem like bandits. Still, he remained cautious.  

The woman’s skirt had ridden up, revealing a plump, round backside.  

Though their faces were obscured by a mist-like spell, the woman’s glare was unmistakable when she noticed his glance. She hastily yanked her skirt down, then shot him a venomous look before releasing her mid-stage Qi Condensation aura.  

The man, also mid-stage but slightly weaker, dismissed Wang Chan with a casual apology. "Apologies, fellow Daoist. Our artifact malfunctioned."  

Without another word, he stored the Water-Avoiding Shuttle, slapped a pair of Swift Movement Talismans onto himself and the woman, and hurried off.  

"That woman gave me a nasty look," Wang Chan muttered, watching them disappear into the distance.  

Shaking his head, he resumed his journey—only to freeze mid-step.  

A wisp of black energy had silently attached itself to his true bone, forming a spider-like mark woven from intricate spell patterns—a signature of mid-grade sorcery.  

Just as the mark threatened to take hold, a layer of white lightning surged forth, encasing it completely.  

A moment later, a ripple of water silently merged back into the river, leaving no trace behind.
