Chapter 70: Courting Death?

"You could've just asked a random passerby, no need to go through so much trouble," Zhou Tian said with a snort.

"It's not like I can just go up to someone and ask," Zhou Zui replied, smiling shyly before quickly following the big Han ahead of them. Zhou Tian rolled his eyes and followed suit.

The big Han didn't get on the gray wolf beside him; instead, he walked alongside it. Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui trailed behind, keeping a safe distance. The big Han seemed oblivious to their presence, striding confidently forward.

As they turned corner after corner, the crowd thinned out. After one particular turn, the big Han suddenly vanished. Zhou Tian, having seen similar scenarios countless times in TV dramas from his past life, immediately said, "Let's stop. We've been discovered."

Before Zhou Zui could respond, a low, rumbling voice came from behind them. "You're quite observant, aren't you?"

Turning around, they saw the big Han standing behind them, his face dark and menacing. The gray wolf by his side bared its teeth, growling low in its throat.

"Senior, what do you mean?" Zhou Zui asked, forcing a laugh as he pretended to be clueless.

"What do I mean? You're following me, that's what!" the big Han growled, his muscles trembling with anger. The wolf's eyes glowed green, and its fur stood on end.

"How could we be following you, Senior? We were just... going the same way," Zhou Zui explained, feigning confusion.

"Don't play dumb! I changed my route four times, heading in different directions, and you still followed. Don't think I wouldn't notice just because my spiritual sense can't penetrate the body here," the big Han snarled, his experience in Tian Guan making him far more cunning than the two young men.

Zhou Tian's eyes widened at the mention of spiritual sense not being able to penetrate the body. He had some thoughts on this but needed verification.

Zhou Zui was also taken aback, not expecting the big Han to be so perceptive despite his rough appearance.

"We... we were just looking for... the location of the brothel, Senior. Please don't misunderstand," Zhou Zui stammered, trying to explain.

"You're newcomers to Tian Guan, right?" the big Han asked, changing the subject.

Zhou Zui nodded. The big Han fell silent for a moment, a look of wariness crossing his face. "Alright, alright. You can go. Turn right at the end of this road, and you'll see a red building - that's the brothel."

Zhou Zui quickly understood that the big Han had recognized their affiliation with Tian Qin. "Thank you, Senior," he said, before pulling Zhou Tian away.

As they passed the big Han, Zhou Tian caught a whiff of a bloody scent. Once they were out of the alley and back on the main street, Zhou Zui let out a sigh of relief. "Don't worry, he won't dare to动手 (make a move) within Tian Guan. Even if he did, it's unlikely anyone could save us. Thankfully, he was wary of our identity."

Zhou Tian wasn't thinking about the big Han's potential threat; he was pondering other issues. "You said that within Tian Guan, one can't use their spiritual sense freely?"

"That's right. The Tian Zun array formation suppresses it. Only a few leaders from the eight major powers stationed here can extend their spiritual sense, but not all the time. That's why there are so many patrol soldiers on the streets," Zhou Zui explained, pointing to the armored guards.

Zhou Tian thought to himself that it seemed possible to increase his death count even before entering the God- Forsaken Land.

Back in the imperial capital, his death count couldn't be increased mainly because there were always people secretly protecting him. He couldn't find an opportunity to "die." But the situation here seemed different.

"What are you thinking?" Zhou Zui asked, noticing Zhou Tian's contemplative expression.

"Nothing," Zhou Tian replied dismissively.

"Let's go then. I'm eager to see how the ladies here compare to those in the imperial capital," Zhou Zui said excitedly.

Zhou Tian followed, his mind still racing with plans.

Within Tian Guan, there was a long-standing rule against using force. Few dared to challenge this rule. Zhou Tian needed to come up with a solid plan.

Upon arriving at the brothel, they were greeted by numerous scantily clad women. With their deep pockets, they opted for the top-tier services, which meant they had to be served by the most skilled courtesans.

However, their behavior was unusual - Zhou Zui couldn't indulge due to his cultivation method, and Zhou Tian was preoccupied with thoughts of "courting death." They ended up spending a large sum just to chat with the courtesans, becoming the talk of the brothel.

As night fell in Tian Guan - marked by the periodic darkening of the sky due to the void storms surrounding the God-Forsaken Land - they returned to the Tian Qin residence.

The main hall was brightly lit, with Zhou Xun Chuan and others gathered there, including Zhou Yan and a stranger. Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui were caught upon their return.

"You were told not to wander off, and yet you still went out. Tian Guan is not the imperial capital; you must be cautious. If something happens, it would be too late for us to react," Zhou Yan scolded upon seeing them.

"It was Zhou Zui who dragged me out; I couldn't resist," Zhou Tian said, throwing Zhou Zui under the bus.

"You..." Zhou Zui looked incredulous but saw Zhou Tian mouthing "处～～" (a hint at some sort of advantage or benefit) and could only hang his head, admitting, "Yes, I was the one who took him out."

"Hmph, a dog will always eat shit," Liu Yan snorted, her comment awkwardly out of character.

The atmosphere turned awkward, with no one knowing how to respond.

"Alright, let me introduce you. This is Wen Hou, the garrison commander for Tian Qin in Tian Guan," Zhou Ying intervened, pointing to a middle-aged man seated in the upper position.

"Greetings, Commander Wen," they said in unison.

Wen Hou, dressed in blue robes, was unremarkable except for his eyes, which shone like golden lamps in the void. "Youngsters being a bit restless is normal. Just stick to areas where the patrols are active; avoid secluded places," he advised, his words seeming to carry an underlying message that Tian Guan was not as simple as it seemed.
