# Chapter 234: Mid-Stage Foundation Building  

Among the Foundation Building cultivators of the Shu Mountain Sect, the elixirs bearing Li Shiming's mark had gained significant renown due to their most distinctive feature—they were all high-grade elixirs. This further elevated Li Shiming's reputation as a newly advanced high-grade alchemist.  

Unfortunately, mid-to-late Foundation Building cultivators who wished to seek Li Shiming's services for elixir refinement found no way to contact him. Li Shiming's activities were confined to Sword Holding Peak, Sky Eye Peak, and Alchemy Cauldron Peak—areas inaccessible to ordinary sect members. Without any connections, they couldn't even reach him through identity jade slips.  

Unbeknownst to Li Shiming, his reputation had already spread far and wide. Under Elder Ma's protection, he had been granted a year to grow.  

This one-year period was already treating Li Shiming as a super genius. Elder Ma was concerned that, due to his lack of experience, Li Shiming might fail in refining elixirs for private clients, which would not only damage his reputation but also affect his Dao heart.  

Failure in private elixir refinement meant the loss of hard-earned spiritual herbs collected by others. While alchemists weren't responsible for such losses, the repercussions could still be significant.  

Elder Ma intended to protect Li Shiming, allowing him to accumulate sufficient experience by refining elixirs for the sect first.  

However, he had never anticipated Li Shiming's rapid growth. In just one month, Li Shiming had refined 1,600 batches of second-grade elixirs, completing his accumulation of alchemical experience.  

"Senior Brothers, come back at this time tomorrow to collect your elixirs," Li Shiming said to Wan Zheng and Lu Shi.  

His words stunned the two senior brothers, who thought they had misheard.  

"Junior Brother, there's no need to rush. Take your time refining," Wan Zheng said after a moment.  

"Enough! Who's the alchemist here—you or Junior Brother? Do as he says, or take your pill recipes and herbs back!" Before Li Shiming could respond, Senior Sister Ye Jingxian interjected with a firm slap on the table.  

"Then we'll return at this time tomorrow," Wan Zheng and Lu Shi conceded helplessly.  

"Refine with confidence. Even if they all fail, it doesn't matter!" Senior Sister Ye's parting words nearly made Wan Zheng and Lu Shi stumble.  

Though they were true disciples, gathering the herbs for fifty batches of "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills" had cost them considerable time, effort, and favors.  

However, given Senior Sister Ye's temperament, they dared not argue.  

"You two—how could you doubt Junior Brother's alchemical skills?" Ye Jingxian shook her head at the two as they left Sword Holding Peak.  

With that, she flew off to her own peak, leaving the two senior brothers behind.  

---  

For Li Shiming, refining fifty batches of "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills" was just a day's work. He didn't rush into the task. Instead, he first completed his daily cultivation routines—"Diamond Body Protection Divine Art" and "Sword Demon Secret Canon."  

He sensed that he was just a hair's breadth away from the peak of early Foundation Building. However, he had no idea how long the bottleneck between early and mid-Foundation Building would hold him back—it was impossible to estimate.  

His physical refinement continued to improve with each session. Unfortunately, as a high-grade alchemist, combat between cultivators was becoming increasingly distant from him.  

Fortunately, his clone, Li Yuanba, was constantly engaged in battles, continuously sharing combat experience with him, ensuring he wouldn't become a cultivator devoid of fighting skills.  

The refinement of "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills" proceeded smoothly. Even though it was his first time refining this particular pill, he encountered no issues. He flawlessly produced ten batches of high-grade "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills," yielding 198 high-grade pills and 2 top-grade pills.  

Of course, all his alchemy was now conducted within the confines of his Machine Room Space. This method offered significant advantages—micrometer-level control allowed him to precisely manage the refinement process.  

More importantly, achieving a 100% success rate with the "Hundred-One Pill Division Technique" was only possible within the Machine Room Space.  

Over the course of a day, he refined all fifty batches of "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills" without disrupting his daily cultivation routine.  

By the time he finished, he had produced 990 high-grade "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills" and 10 top-grade pills.  

This private refinement session truly opened his eyes to the staggering profits of alchemy.  

Of these, 330 high-grade pills were for Wan Zheng and Lu Shi, while the rest belonged to him.  

Even excluding the doubled output from the "Hundred-One Pill Division Technique," he still earned 165 high-grade and 10 top-grade pills.  

He stored the 330 high-grade pills in a large jade vial, ready to hand them over to his senior brothers the next day.  

---  

The following morning, after practicing "Purple Qi Comes from the East," Li Shiming waited for his senior brothers to arrive.  

As he sat in the main hall, he suddenly felt ripples in his spiritual lake. A flash of insight struck him. A white lotus bloomed beneath his feet, while another appeared in his cultivation chamber.  

In an instant, he teleported to the lotus in the cultivation chamber, sitting cross-legged above the spiritual vein's outlet.  

The spiritual lake, initially rippling, soon churned with increasingly violent waves.  

The liquid Five-Element Thunder spiritual power surged violently within the lake, and Li Shiming's aura fluctuated wildly.  

The "Nine Heavens Thunder Strike Technique" activated automatically, guiding the unstable Five-Element Thunder spiritual power into a specific circulation pattern.  

In his perception, Li Shiming felt as though a wall stood before him. The Five-Element Thunder spiritual power relentlessly battered against it, striving to break through.  

He sensed that shattering this wall would allow him to advance to mid-Foundation Building. This wall was the bottleneck of early Foundation Building, manifested by his consciousness.  

Initially, he thought this seemingly impenetrable barrier wouldn't be easily overcome.  

Yet, after just over a dozen impacts, cracks spread across the wall as if it would crumble at any moment.  

Li Shiming had underestimated his own talent. His Dao body, enhanced by "Purple Qi Comes from the East," had been transformed by the innate Primordial Purple Qi into a flawless Dao body. Though not yet fully perfected, it provided immense assistance in overcoming bottlenecks at the Foundation Building stage.  

No cultivator in the history of the cultivation world had ever elevated their Dao body to his level by absorbing Primordial Purple Qi. Only through the fusion of his past life's scientific knowledge and this life's "Purple Qi Comes from the East" technique had such results been achieved.  

---  

"What's going on? Did something happen?" Wan Zheng sent a spell signal outside Sword Holding Peak to announce his arrival. After waiting for an incense stick's worth of time without seeing Li Shiming, he grew anxious.  

Beside him, Lu Shi was equally worried. The only explanation he could think of was that Li Shiming had failed in refining the pills and was too embarrassed to face them.  

"Let's ask Senior Sister to come. Even if the refinement failed, it's fine—consider it an investment in Junior Brother," Wan Zheng said, steadying his nerves.  

Hearing this, Lu Shi—no fool himself—realized Li Shiming's alchemical talent.  

Though the loss was significant, it wasn't entirely bad. Such a heavy investment would undoubtedly earn them a favor from Li Shiming.  

"Right, let Senior Sister persuade Li Shiming. He shouldn't let the loss of herbs affect his state of mind," Lu Shi agreed, nodding repeatedly.  

A spell signal flew out, this time directed at Senior Sister Ye Jingxian's peak. Since the senior brothers' peaks were clustered around Sky Eye Peak, communication was convenient.  

"What happened?" Senior Sister Ye soon appeared in the air, looking at the two.  

"Junior Brother didn't respond at the agreed time. We're worried he failed in refining and it affected his mindset," Wan Zheng explained with a bitter smile.  

"Good. You didn't think about your herbs first but considered Junior Brother's well-being," Senior Sister Ye praised before adding, "Wait here. Do you expect me to break the formation?"  

With that, she sent a spell signal into Sword Holding Peak and waited in the air.  

The wait lasted two full hours before the formation finally opened.  

The three sighed in relief, having feared Li Shiming might have taken the failure too hard—after all, he was still relatively new to cultivation.  

Entering the main hall, they found Li Shiming meditating, his aura unstable.  

At first, they feared he had suffered a Qi deviation. But they quickly realized his unstable aura was due to his recent breakthrough, making it difficult to stabilize his energy.  

Especially Lu Shi, whose jaw dropped in disbelief.  

How long had Li Shiming been in the sect? According to his records, he had only reached Foundation Building two years ago. How had he already advanced to mid-Foundation Building?  

Lu Shi thought of himself—it had taken him twelve years to reach mid-Foundation Building, and even then, Master Su had praised his talent.  

If his talent was considered excellent, what did that make Li Shiming?  

For a moment, Lu Shi questioned his entire existence.  

Li Shiming's spiritual roots were only of three elements. Master Su had accepted him as a disciple only because Li Shiming had brought back a third-grade Sunward Three-Leaf Grass as a token of gratitude.  

Wan Zheng and Senior Sister Ye were equally shocked.  

Was this the "great fortune" Master Su had spoken of? Were those blessed with high fortune always this monstrous?  

"Senior Sister, Senior Brothers, my apologies. I had a sudden epiphany and kept you waiting," Li Shiming said sheepishly.  

"Junior Brother, congratulations on reaching mid-Foundation Building! Now let's see Xu Chuan boast about no longer being the youngest disciple!" Senior Sister Ye laughed, her perspective uniquely cheerful.  

Wan Zheng and Lu Shi thought of Xu Chuan and couldn't help but chuckle.  

Xu Chuan, once the youngest disciple, had only recently become the fourth senior brother after Li Shiming's arrival. How long had his pride lasted before Li Shiming caught up?  

Though seniority in the sect wasn't strictly based on cultivation stage, if a senior brother's level fell behind his junior's, how could he still call himself a senior?  

"And you, Lu Shi—how long do you think it'll take Junior Brother to surpass you?" Senior Sister Ye teased.  

Lu Shi's smile froze. Given Li Shiming's speed, surpassing him didn't seem far-fetched.  

When that happened, how could he still call himself the third senior brother? The humiliation would be unbearable.  

"Senior Brothers, about the 'Azure Glass Five Elements Pills'—" Li Shiming began, only to be cut off by Wan Zheng.  

"Junior Brother, if the pills failed, so be it. Your breakthrough to mid-Foundation Building is what matters!" Wan Zheng waved dismissively.  

"Exactly! Don't let it affect your state of mind. Alchemy is about learning from failures," Senior Sister Ye added reassuringly.  

Lu Shi nodded vigorously, his expression equally unconcerned.  

Li Shiming felt a surge of warmth. His senior siblings' care made him feel genuinely cherished.  

"They didn't fail. Here are the 330 'Azure Glass Five Elements Pills,'" Li Shiming hurriedly produced the refined pills before they could console him further.  

Wan Zheng blinked in surprise as he accepted the large jade vial. Li Shiming had stored all the pills in a single large vial—a magical tool capable of preserving efficacy over long periods.  

Though not particularly valuable, such vials were highly practical.  

Wan Zheng scanned the contents with his spiritual sense and was stunned. The pills were of exceptional quality—far beyond ordinary high-grade "Azure Glass Five Elements Pills."  

Even among high-grade second-grade elixirs, there were subtle differences. The ones in the vial could only be described as perfect.  

"Junior Brother, your alchemical skills are beyond reproach. From now on, I'll rely on you for all my pill needs!" Wan Zheng said warmly, handing the vial to the eagerly waiting Lu Shi.  

"As long as it's within my abilities, you can come to me anytime," Li Shiming readily agreed.  

He had come to realize that, starting from mid-Foundation Building, the sect's supply of second-grade elixirs wasn't unlimited.  

Second-grade herbs took time to grow, and no stockpile could sustain his voracious refining pace.  

To refine more second-grade elixirs, private commissions were the way forward—not only would he earn more pills, but he'd also gain favors from fellow cultivators.  

Take his two senior brothers, for example. They had gone to great lengths to gather the recipes and materials, yet the pills they received amounted to less than half of what Li Shiming earned in a single day of work.  

Moreover, he couldn't monopolize the sect's alchemy tasks. With four other high-grade alchemists in the sect, he had to be mindful not to take all their work. Previously unaware, he now knew better.  

"Junior Brother, hurry up and become a high-grade alchemist. Then I'll have you refine my Golden Core breakthrough pills!" Senior Sister Ye said, her eyes gleaming.  

Though she was a half-step Golden Core cultivator, the final step required a long, arduous process. She had already prepared her breakthrough resources, waiting for Master Su to arrange Elder Ma's services.  

But if Li Shiming's alchemical skills progressed quickly enough, she would much rather entrust this critical task to him.
