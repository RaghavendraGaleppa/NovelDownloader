# Chapter 83: Development

Zhou Qing harvested the Vermilion Fruit and preserved it in a jade box, which would help retain its medicinal properties for longer and slow down their loss.

Afterward, he went to Qingfu Palace.

This time, Zhou Qing was lucky enough to find Fu Shan awake.

This was partly due to Fu Shan using his medical skills to treat himself after each awakening. Now, he could wake up about once every five days, and the duration of his awakenings was gradually increasing, reaching half an hour.

As for Fu Song, Fu Shan ignored him. That old rascal had no respect for seniority and had tried to attack him several times under the guise of Zhou Qing awakening him.

Fu Shan remembered all of it.

Besides, Fu Song spent his time practicing, eating, and sleeping whether he was mad or awake, so there wasn't much difference.

"Good, good, good," Fu Shan said, his face beaming as he looked at the vibrant red Vermilion Fruit.

As a grandmaster of medicine, he was naturally excited to see the legendary spiritual herb.

"Previously, when refining the Blood Coagulation Pill, I used herbs with similar properties to the Vermilion Fruit. However, the Vermilion Fruit is filled with spiritual energy, and refining the Qi Condensation Pill requires a higher temperature flame. The Blood Coagulation Pill couldn't withstand such a flame, so I haven't tried it yet. Moreover, I need my brother's assistance."

The two exchanged thoughts through their divine senses. They had already discussed many details beforehand. This time, after the Vermilion Fruit matured, Fu Shan would further observe its condition and make further adjustments.

Although both were extremely skilled alchemists in the world, this was the first time they were refining the Qi Condensation Pill.

The Blood Coagulation Pill, simulated with ordinary precious herbs, was always different from the Qi Condensation Pill. Fortunately, Zhou Qing had the Nourishing Life skill, which provided detailed feedback during the refining of the Blood Coagulation Pill. By observing with his divine sense and making deductions, he was quite confident in succeeding with a low-grade Qi Condensation Pill.

Even a low-grade Qi Condensation Pill involved complicated steps and required a high and pure flame. To achieve this, the two planned to use their True Qi to control the high-temperature flame of the brick kiln using the Dragon Capturing Skill.

"Actually, the best way is to find a True Yang Earth's core fire. Such places are hard to find, and Jiangzhou obviously doesn't have any suitable locations."

"I've already sent people to look for one. If it's close to Jiangzhou, we'll take over the place. If it's too far, we'll consider other options."

"Good."

Zhou Qing and Fu Shan discussed the detailed refining process, made thorough preparations, and then chose a day when Fu Shan was awake to refine the pill in the brick kiln using the high-temperature flame.

The biggest challenge in entering the brick kiln and controlling the flame was enduring the high temperature. Zhou Qing not only wore a fire-resistant suit but also had two cloaks woven from the fire feathers of the Demon Crane. He and Fu Shan each wore one, relying on the cloaks' natural defense and absorption of flames to resist the high temperature of the kiln.

The pill furnace was also moved in by the two of them.

Although Fu Shan had been taught the Dragon Capturing Skill by Zhou Qing during his awakenings, his True Qi had only just reached the threshold of the second level of Qi Refining after seven or eight years of continuous practice. His divine sense was far inferior to Zhou Qing's, not even comparable to Zhang Jingxiu's.

Therefore, the difference was immediately apparent when using the Dragon Capturing Skill to control the high-temperature flame of the brick kiln.

Zhou Qing's control over the flame was significantly stronger, and he could make subtle adjustments. He could even control the flame into the shape of a small snake.

Flames were continuously drawn into the pill furnace by Zhou Qing and Fu Shan using the Dragon Capturing Skill. Zhou Qing could also multitask, adding herbs according to the complex steps.

With Fu Shan's assistance in the early stages, Zhou Qing was much more relaxed.

Later, even though Fu Shan used golden needles to prolong his awakening time, his divine sense couldn't hold on. The flame he drew almost couldn't be controlled at the entrance of the pill furnace.

He had to step down.

When Zhou Qing was left alone, he felt the pressure increase significantly.

Fortunately, Fu Shan took advantage of his remaining awakening time to wake up Fu Song and tell him about his experience. Fu Song had watched Fu Shan refine pills since he was a child. He didn't understand when he was young and was often dragged by Fu Shan to stoke the fire. It wasn't until Zhi Shan came along that the task of stoking the
