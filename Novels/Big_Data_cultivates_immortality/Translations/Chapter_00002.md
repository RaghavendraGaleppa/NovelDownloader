# Chapter 2  

Feng Jun's phone was indeed a freebie from topping up his phone bill—not only was its configuration abysmally low and performance sluggish, but it also took an eternity to charge.  

Without fast-charging technology, it took a full four hours to barely fill the battery, which would then last about a day and a half to two days. If he used it continuously, it wouldn't even last a full day.  

What puzzled Feng Jun was how this phone had managed to charge fully in just about two hours.  

His curiosity was so overwhelming that he even forgot about the troubles of his impending resignation.  

Feng Jun was an avid reader of online novels—a choice born more out of necessity than preference. While he enjoyed pastimes like clubbing, those hobbies were too expensive. Reading was far cheaper; even subscribing to official releases cost less than a pack of cigarettes a day.  

*Could this be the legendary stroke of fate?*  

Feng Jun couldn't help but entertain the thought. After all, he had seemingly been struck by lightning—yet here he was, completely unharmed.  

He tested the phone by calling his colleague Wang Haifeng. The call went through perfectly, and he could even tell from Wang's tone that the man wasn't in the best mood.  

Wang Haifeng was one of the few people Feng Jun was close to at the Hongjie Club. Though also in his twenties, Wang held a professional trainer's license and was highly skilled in fitness training. Despite their similar ages and vastly different statuses, the two had a strong friendship.  

Feng Jun vented about the day's events and mentioned his intention to quit.  

Coach Wang responded absentmindedly, "Oh, Liu Shuming bullied you? I'll deal with him later."  

Liu Shuming was just an ordinary body-shaping coach in his thirties. Though his muscles were impressive, he was no match for Wang Haifeng in a real fight.  

After hanging up, Feng Jun muttered under his breath, "Something's on his mind."  

Well, other people's problems weren't his concern. Right now, he had to decide whether to show up for work tomorrow.  

Though the Hongjie Club was in the service industry, it was relatively well-regulated. For transient staff like waiters, the company offered daily wages. If Feng Jun resigned tomorrow, he would still be paid for the past twenty-some days.  

But… the finance department’s Sister Ren was notoriously nitpicky, and he’d likely endure a long lecture.  

More importantly, if he quit, he’d have to find his own accommodation tomorrow night—which would cost money.  

*"Sigh, hardly anyone at Hongjie is decent,"* Feng Jun grumbled as he glanced at his phone—the battery was charging fast, but would it drain just as quickly?  

Then his eyes landed on the QQ app, and he suddenly remembered: *I haven’t harvested my crops in QQ Farm yet!*  

---  

QQ Farm wasn’t something Feng Jun had installed voluntarily. He’d done it to curry favor with his boss—specifically, the club’s general manager, Sister Hong, who loved stealing crops.  

While the workplace wasn’t as rigid as government offices, it still paid to indulge the boss’s hobbies. Wang Haifeng had given him that advice.  

Sure enough, two days after installing QQ Farm, Sister Hong spotted the app during an inspection and casually asked for his QQ number. This gave Feng Jun a direct line to the top.  

But proximity to leadership wasn’t always a good thing. About a month after adding him, Sister Hong remarked offhandedly, *"Now that you’ve leveled up, you can’t just ignore planting grass."*  

Feng Jun had an epiphany: *She’s running a Ranch too!*  

He did have a Ranch, but he only planted grass when his own animals were running low. It had never occurred to him that Sister Hong’s Ranch might need fodder.  

Sister Hong never planted grass herself—her high level allowed her to focus on high-value crops.  

So how did she feed her animals? By stealing, of course. With so many employees at Hongjie, she had plenty of targets.  

Taking the hint, Feng Jun started planting grass regularly. He reminded himself not to harvest immediately but to wait until Sister Hong had stolen her share—though he hated the feeling of being robbed.  

But Sister Hong wasn’t punctual either. As the club’s boss, she was swamped. Often, Feng Jun would wait half a day for her to steal before finally harvesting what remained.  

*At least I’m being considerate, right?*  

Now, Feng Jun was ready to stop caring. *"I’m quitting anyway, and I remember planting nothing but grass this time…"*  

He opened QQ Farm, saw the ripe grass, and tapped the harvesting hand on the screen.  

*Holy grass—literally!*  

The next moment, everything went dark, and he found himself in a bizarre space that looked exactly like QQ Farm—ten plots of land filled with grass, some left fallow, and a doghouse nearby with an empty bowl in front (dog food cost money, after all, and buying it would ruin Sister Hong’s fun).  

Feng Jun stood frozen for ten minutes before slapping himself hard. The pain convinced him this wasn’t a dream.  

*"Holy… holy… holy…"*  

He was so excited he couldn’t even form words. *This is it—the legendary stroke of luck!*  

And it truly was. He got to harvest the grass *in person*, no sickle needed. Just reach out, grab, and pull—real hands-on work.  

But manual labor was exhausting. It took him half an hour to clear just one plot, which was about 30 square meters. *Why make the fields so damn big?*  

Then he stood up. *"How do I get out? System? System, are you there?"*  

He hoped the system would manifest as an ethereal fairy or, failing that, a robot—just no lolis. He wasn’t in the mood for cutesy nonsense.  

But there was nothing—no system voice, no prompts, not even a dreaded loli.  

Staring at the remaining nine plots, Feng Jun muttered, *"Maybe I have to harvest everything first?"*  

Six hours later, he sat on the field’s edge, panting, staring at the now-empty plots. *"This is inhuman. System… still not showing up?"*  

Silence.  

*"Fine, a loli will do. Loli… still nothing?"*  

Still nothing.  

Panic set in. *What if I’m trapped here?* His life might have its downsides, but he wasn’t ready to become a farmer—especially not one stuck in a game.  

A horrifying thought struck him: *What if I’m reduced to a stream of 1s and 0s?*  

After multiple attempts, he finally returned to reality half an hour later.  

He looked around, pinched his thigh (his ears still rang from the earlier slap), and exhaled in relief. *"Thank goodness. I was about to explore outside the farm."*  

There was no all-powerful system in that strange space. The reason he couldn’t leave earlier? A single blade of grass he’d missed.  

*"So the farm strictly follows its programming,"* Feng Jun mused, torn between laughter and tears.  

Next, as the beneficiary of this stroke of luck, he naturally wanted to analyze its origins.  

But then his stomach growled—he hadn’t eaten in seven or eight hours, and he’d been doing manual labor.  

When he checked the time on his phone, his jaw dropped. *"What? It’s still 8 PM?"*  

The date confirmed it: he was still on the same day, the day he’d gotten drunk and been struck by lightning.  

In other words, though he’d spent seven hours in the farm, no time had passed in the real world.  

*"This thing is insane,"* he marveled, already fantasizing about the flamboyant strides he’d take once this treasure propelled him to the pinnacle of life.  

As he reached his room’s door, his roommate Zhao Hongqi rushed in, took one look at his exhausted state, and blurted, *"Holy crap, what happened to you?"*  

Zhao, another Hongjie employee who mostly parked cars for tips, earned more than Feng Jun but was also a suspected thief—Feng Jun had lost money twice under suspicious circumstances when Zhao was around.  

So Feng Jun just sighed wearily. *"I was farming all day."*  

*"Farming?"* Zhao scoffed. Zheng Yang was a bustling provincial capital—where would anyone find land to farm? *"I’m just asking, no need to be sarcastic."*  

Feng Jun stared at him before replying sincerely, *"I’m serious. I really was… farming grass."*
