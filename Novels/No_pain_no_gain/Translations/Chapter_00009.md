# Chapter 9: Do Not Disturb My Dao Heart

After the Seven Mystical Sect’s mobilization meeting, this batch of disciples was not immediately dispatched down the mountain. Before their departure, many still needed to prepare a few handy weapons.

On the day before heading down, on a secluded beast trail near the outer perimeter of Cloudmist Mountain, a figure stealthily moved under the dim moonlight. Along the way, he skillfully avoided many hidden sentries, indicating a deep familiarity with Cloudmist Mountain’s defenses.

The night wind in the mountains masked the rustling sounds of dry branches under the black-clad figure’s feet, until he finally stopped beneath a large tree. With the accompanying wind, a series of howling sounds began. The black-clad figure mimicked the cry of a wild beast, and soon, the person he was meeting responded.

“Madman Wu’s direct disciple… will depart for Valley Encirclement Town tomorrow. A Protector might secretly follow…”

“The Third Gang Master will personally seek revenge, rest assured.”

...

Inside Han Zhen’s practice stone chamber at his new residence.

After nine cycles of *zhou tian*, Han Zhen completed his daily cultivation of the Berserk Python Art as usual. Suddenly, his innate fortune, [Heaven’s Reward for Diligence], glowed brighter than before. Han Zhen instantly felt the True Qi in his meridians surge violently. His body became incredibly hot, red patterns appearing all over his skin, and the True Qi within him rapidly grew stronger and more tempestuous. Han Zhen firmly guarded his mind, suppressing the raging True Qi as it flowed through his body according to the Berserk Python Art’s cultivation route.

Unlike previous practice sessions, Han Zhen suddenly felt as if he could control this violent True Qi, making it leave his meridians and even project beyond his body. Han Zhen understood: his Berserk Python Art True Qi cultivation had just broken through to the Mastery stage! He could now externalize True Qi, and even imbue it into weapons to unleash unexpected power.

“Before heading down the mountain, I always had a vague sense of unease.” This feeling instantly vanished after his martial arts internal cultivation breakthrough, and Han Zhen’s face lit up with joy. “Furthermore, how will the Mad Devil Staff perform with the enhancement of True Qi at the Mastery stage?”

Han Zhen was a man of action. Being able to test his capabilities before descending the mountain would make him feel more secure. In this private courtyard, he didn’t have to worry about affecting others. Han Zhen retrieved his Eyebrow-Level Staff. This was the weapon Master Wu used in his youth, and he had entrusted it to Han Zhen before his departure. Han Zhen felt the staff’s texture, made of some unknown wood, fiery red throughout, sturdy yet not rigid, flexible yet unbreaking. He performed a full set of Mad Devil Staff techniques, the Eyebrow-Level Staff moving in his hands as if an extension of his own arm. Then, Han Zhen focused his gaze forward, activated a secret technique of the Berserk Python Art, and crimson patterns coiled around his arms. The staff, imbued with True Qi, swiftly cleaved downwards from above.

With a muffled thud, the thick stone slab covering the practice chamber floor shattered, shards of stone flying and clattering against the stone walls. The ground was also left with a small crater from the strike. A fifth of Han Zhen’s True Qi instantly depleted, but a cool stream of energy rapidly circulated within his body, and his True Qi began to replenish itself ceaselessly. No wonder they say, “Practicing techniques without internal cultivation is pointless.” The power of this full-force strike far surpassed that of the Berserk Python Art before its Mastery stage, its destructive power increasing by severalfold.

He wondered how much he still lagged behind the three hidden Grand-Martial Ancestors of the Seven Mystical Sect. Among them were those capable of unleashing a three-inch sword aura, beings who could threaten even low-level cultivators. Han Zhen quickly shook his head. All things considered, he had only cultivated True Qi for just over two years, while those three Grand-Martial Ancestors were old fogeys who had lived for decades. If not for the Evergreen Art subtly improving his physical aptitude, allowing his meridians to withstand rapid True Qi growth, even with exceptional root bone, reaching his current strength would have required years of refinement.

Early the next morning, over a dozen black-lacquered carriages, each bearing a black and silver-edged triangular flag embroidered with the character “Xuan,” streamed out of the Seven Mystical Sect gates and galloped down the official road. Along the way, three of them suddenly separated from the procession, heading in a different direction.

Inside the leading carriage sat only four disciples from the Seven Absolutes Hall. Han Zhen recalled the time when thirty child aspirants were crammed into a single carriage to participate in the Seven Mystical Sect’s test. In just two years, his treatment had improved beyond comparison.

Han Zhen placed his Eyebrow-Level Staff in a convenient spot, with three three-foot-long fine-iron armor-piercing arrows secured to his back. For this mountain excursion, due to the varying martial arts cultivation levels among the disciples, the sect had specially permitted each small team to be equipped with five heavy crossbows. Although heavy crossbows were forbidden in the Yue Kingdom, the Seven Mystical Sect’s cooperation with the authorities allowed them to openly possess and use them. Han Zhen had also tested the power of the heavy crossbows; cultivators with even slightly profound True Qi could generally block them. Their lethality was far inferior to the armor-piercing arrows he could casually throw.

Zhang Xiuer and an ordinary-looking female disciple were the last to board the carriage. This team had only two girls, which was somewhat inconvenient. Han Zhen specifically allowed the female disciple from the Hundred Forges Hall to ride in their carriage. Zhang Xiuer glanced left and right. After seeing Wu Yan’s annoying face, she chose to sit on the side closer to Han Zhen. Han Zhen said nothing, but someone else was displeased. Wu Yan sneered a few times, making no effort to conceal his jealousy of Han Zhen. He had been here first! Wu Yan’s cousin-in-law was the Vice Sect Master, and Zhang Xiuer was the Fifth Elder’s niece. Both of them were disciples of the Seven Absolutes Hall, making them a perfect match in the eyes of outsiders.

Yet, he had been pursuing Zhang Xiuer for a long time, and she always treated him with indifference. But for Han Zhen, whom she had barely met a few times, she actively sought him out from the start. Zhang Xiuer watched Han Zhen, who was sitting cross-legged in meditation, unsure if he was cultivating or resting. She subtly shifted closer to Han Zhen, curiously touching his Eyebrow-Level Staff.

“Senior Brother Han is always so diligent! Xiuer hopes Senior Brother will take good care of her during this expedition.” As the carriage jolted, whether by coincidence or intent, Zhang Xiuer lost her balance and leaned over. Han Zhen raised his arm just in time, preventing her from falling into his embrace. Unexpectedly, his arm still brushed against a soft spot. Han Zhen impassively pushed Zhang Xiuer away; his arm couldn't even serve as a buffer to mitigate damage. *Such trifling charms dare to disturb my Dao heart!*

Though Han Zhen was not as narcissistic as Mo Juren, he was well aware of his impact on impressionable young women. Unfortunately, having embarked on the immortal path, Han Zhen was destined not to invest emotion in mortals. As for having his fill and walking away without responsibility, Han Zhen honestly asked himself, he couldn't bring himself to do such a heartless thing.

Zhang Xiuer, her face flushed, cast a glance at Han Zhen, finding him still like an old monk in meditation, seemingly brooding in silence. He was completely a “mute gourd,” even cultivating while traveling. What a waste of such a handsome face! Though Zhang Xiuer found Han Zhen uninteresting, she dutifully sat beside him; at least he was pleasant to look at. The other tall, taciturn senior disciple was equally quiet.

Two “mute gourds” and one annoying person gathered together, unable to squeeze out a single word for hours. Though deeply displeased, Zhang Xiuer could only half-heartedly respond to Wu Yan’s eager overtures. Along the way, while Han Zhen cultivated his True Qi, part of his attention remained outside, constantly vigilant. Seeing Wu Yan and Zhang Xiuer so relaxed and carefree, as if they had "we will win" written all over their faces, Han Zhen sighed.
