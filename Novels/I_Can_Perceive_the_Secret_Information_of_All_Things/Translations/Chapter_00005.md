# Chapter 5: I Just Wanted to Be Reborn, What Did I Do Wrong?  

The wife of the Lu family had fainted—whether from pain or from shock at her newborn child who could speak immediately after birth, no one could say.  

In any case, the matter was now over.  

Lu Jinyin instructed the maids to take his wife and child to another room for care while he stayed behind to handle the aftermath. After all, he had invited so many people to help, and now that the task was done, it was only proper to host a meal and distribute silver as thanks.  

The child declared that he could walk on his own, but he needed a set of clothes first.  

The dozen or so people who had come to assist with the delivery all marveled at Xiao Ji’s abilities. They exchanged names and addresses, hoping that if they ever crossed paths again in the cultivation world, they could lend each other a helping hand.  

These were mere pleasantries, of course. Everyone knew that once they left the Lu residence, they would go their separate ways. Unless they all lived in Willow Town, the chances of meeting again in this lifetime were practically zero.  

This world was vast, and the future was uncertain. No one dared claim they knew what lay ahead.  

"Congratulations, Master Lu, on the birth of such a prodigious son," said the Daoist physician, who had some insight. He knew the child would undoubtedly achieve greatness in the future.  

Before long, the news would spread throughout the city, and major sects would surely send representatives to recruit the boy.  

After offering their congratulations, the guests eagerly awaited their share of silver.  

The crowd soon gathered around Lu Jinyin, chatting animatedly.  

"If not for Daoist Xiao, not only would my child have been lost, but my beloved wife’s life as well," Lu Jinyin said sincerely as he approached Xiao Ji. "I would like to ask the Daoist to bestow a name upon my miraculous child."  

Xiao Ji declined several times, but Lu Jinyin remained insistent. Finally, Xiao Ji relented. "Then let him be called Lu Zha."  

"Lu Zha—what a humble name! Such names are easier to raise. Lu Zha it is, hahaha!" Lu Jinyin laughed heartily, the years of pent-up sorrow finally lifted from his shoulders.  

He invited everyone to the front hall for a feast. Whether they had contributed to the birth or not, he assured them that all would receive silver and must eat and drink to their hearts' content.  

Just as they were about to leave the rear courtyard for the front hall, Xiao Ji suddenly remembered something.  

The wife of the Lu family had carried not only a prodigious child but also an evil spirit infant, which had already taken physical form. It couldn’t be left unchecked.  

"Master Lu, there should have been an evil spirit infant in your wife’s womb as well. Where has it gone?" Xiao Ji asked.  

Before Lu Jinyin could answer, the midwife spoke up with a smile. "That evil spirit infant was already dead in the womb. After I pulled it out, I tossed it aside. Once your genius child was born, he chatted with his mother for a bit, then jumped down and stomped on the evil thing until it was finished. No way it survived."  

"But the evil spirit infant had already solidified. We can’t just leave it lying around," Xiao Ji said, still uneasy.  

Lu Jinyin reassured him, "Don’t worry, Daoist Xiao. I’ve already sent a servant to the magistrate’s office. The authorities will come to dispose of the evil thing."  

Passing the problem to the officials was indeed a reasonable solution.  

Just as they were about to turn away, the courtyard was suddenly enveloped in a chilling aura.  

A sinister wind howled, scattering the piled-up snow across the ground. The servants of the Lu residence, who had spent the entire morning sweeping, would now have to start all over again.  

"I just wanted to be reborn. What did I do wrong?" A shrill, ghostly child’s voice echoed from the room. The door burst open, revealing the supposedly dead evil spirit infant, its head caved in from being stomped, its body wreathed in black smoke.  

*You call this ‘rebirth’?*  

The logic of evil spirits was truly incomprehensible.  

The malevolent wind swirled through the courtyard, creating a terrifying spectacle. Lu Jinyin and his servants paled in fear, while the invited experts instinctively stepped back.  

Xiao Ji sensed the evil energy in the wind and determined that the spirit’s power was between the first and second levels of Qi Refining—something he could handle.  

It seemed the already dim-witted evil spirit had now descended into mindless rage.  

He glanced at the sect disciple beside him, who carried a massive sword. "Which sect are you from? Do you want to handle this?"  

The disciple shook his head. "I’ve recently hit a bottleneck in my cultivation. My qi is blocked. I’m afraid I can’t."  

**[Zhan Duanfeng, the worst disciple of the Falling Leaves Sword Sect. A five-element spiritual root waste, theoretically at half a level of Qi Refining. He hasn’t encountered a bottleneck—he hasn’t even seen one.]**  

**[His master, pitying his lack of talent, assigned him to menial errands. This time, he was delivering a birthday gift to the Cold Sky Blade Sect when he encountered a low-level rabbit demon. It chased him, causing him to lose both his travel funds and the gift. Now, he’s trying to earn some silver for the journey back to his sect.]**  

*A rather pitiful cultivator...* Xiao Ji’s gaze softened. "Lend me your sword, then. I’ll take care of this creature."  

*You really came here with nothing but wisdom, huh?* The others couldn’t quite understand Xiao Ji. He clearly had some skill, yet he was so poor he didn’t even have a talisman—always borrowing from others.  

Confusion aside, no one was stingy.  

Zhan Duanfeng handed over his greatsword.  

The evil spirit infant had already entered the courtyard. Having lost all reason, it had revived through sheer resentment. Its body was filled with nothing but malice, and it sought only to kill everyone in sight. Strength or weakness no longer mattered to it.  

Against such a creature, there was only one solution: extermination.  

Xiao Ji knew he was the strongest present—at the second level of Qi Refining. The evil infant spirit, fluctuating between the first and second levels, meant he was the only one who could end this.  

Before the spirit could charge, Xiao Ji, with Zhan Duanfeng’s help, managed to draw the greatsword.  

The oversized weapon, while impressive in appearance, was cumbersome to wield. Fortunately, Xiao Ji’s second-level Qi Refining allowed him to maintain control.  

He thrust the sword toward the evil spirit, which, seeing the attack, opened its tiny mouth lined with milk teeth and bit down.  

A piercing shriek echoed through the Lu residence.  

The enchanted blade pierced the spirit’s body, leaving a black hole in its chest that spread like burning paper.  

Barring any surprises, it would soon vanish from this world entirely.  

Silence fell over the courtyard.  

The onlookers stared at Xiao Ji, still holding the greatsword in a dramatic pose, with a hint of envy.  

**[In its final moments, the evil spirit struggled to recall its memories, but its mind was nearly blank. The only things it could remember clearly were Physician Xue from the Child-Giving Temple and the single-stringed pipa that had granted it a sliver of intelligence.]**  

An infant spirit that had never seen the light of day had gained a trace of sentience just by touching that pipa. The artifact was undoubtedly unusual, and a wandering physician who raised such spirits was surely a practitioner of dark medicine.  

*I could write an anonymous letter to the magistrate, asking the authorities to report it to the imperial court and have the Demon-Suppression Bureau handle it,* Xiao Ji thought. *But that single-stringed pipa is extraordinary. It’d be a shame not to take it and sell it.*  

After some internal debate, Xiao Ji decided to focus on improving his cultivation first. Then he would scout the Child-Giving Temple and decide his next move.  

"It’s over," Xiao Ji announced.  

Lu Jinyin took a long moment to recover before speaking. "Then let’s eat."
