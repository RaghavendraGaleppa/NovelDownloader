# Chapter 47: Brother Changsheng, Let Me Help You Cultivate!

The autumn sky was clear and refreshing.

A grand procession of carriages advanced steadily along the official road.

Dou Changsheng sat upright in the carriage, cradling the Hero's Sword in his arms. Beside him sat Ma Liren, the chief steward of the royal residence. Despite being a formidable martial artist, Ma carried himself with remarkable humility—as if Dou were the divine-level master and he merely an ordinary practitioner.

One glance revealed Ma Liren's background as a seasoned palace veteran.

Over the past two days of travel, Dou had been thoroughly satisfied with Ma's arrangements. Everything was meticulously organized, and Ma frequently reported updates, ensuring Dou never felt sidelined or excluded. It was the perfect balance—having full authority without needing to micromanage every detail.

Clearly, the Empress had put considerable thought into selecting this steward. Ma Liren was overqualified for this role.

Ma personally brewed tea and presented it to Dou with both hands, serving him attentively without taking a sip himself. Though Dou had initially refused such treatment, he had grown accustomed to it after two days.

After taking a sip, Dou felt his internal energy surge within him, undergoing another instantaneous refinement. He had now completed two of the Five Qi transformations.

With a sigh, he remarked, "I'm really not used to such premium tea. It's wasted on me."

Ma Liren smiled at Dou's humble deflection. "Hero Dou, you braved the Sword Gate twice and dueled with grandmasters. At Qingyang Peak, you outshone all heroes and exposed Qingyang Daoist's conspiracy. You are the epitome of integrity. This tea is truly deserving of you. Had it been consumed by the deposed emperor instead, that would have been a waste."

"Now, Hero Dou, you're traveling a thousand miles to escort the deposed emperor back to his fiefdom. Enjoying some fine food and drink is only natural. Even if you were to take some with you when you leave, it would be entirely justified."

Dou shook his head in silent refusal.

Over the past two days, the quality of his meals and drinks had risen significantly—especially this tea, which was infused with abundant spiritual energy, greatly benefiting cultivation. It was thanks to this that Dou had managed another breakthrough in refining his innate energy.

He had misunderstood the Grand General.

This escort mission was indeed a lucrative assignment.

If not for his conscience, it wouldn't be unusual for half of the hundred-plus carriages to go "missing" by the time they reached Beiyang. After all, if demonic cultivators raided them at night, staying silent to protect the deposed emperor would be perfectly reasonable.

A melodious voice suddenly sounded nearby. "Hero Dou."

"My mistress requests your presence."

Dou lifted the carriage curtain and saw a ten-year-old girl with a youthful face and a perky topknot. She gazed at him calmly, devoid of any emotion.

*Finally,* Dou thought to himself.

The past two days had been unnervingly peaceful—almost too comfortable.

But Dou knew this couldn't last.

The deposed emperor was bound to summon him eventually. If not for Dou, he would still be in the capital, revered as the supreme ruler. The Jin Kingdom stood as the foremost among nations, its authority unparalleled. To fall from such heights to the title of Prince of Beiyang—such a drastic shift couldn't possibly leave him unaffected.

Knowing he couldn't avoid this meeting—it was part of his mission, after all—Dou stepped out of the carriage and said, "If the Prince of Beiyang wishes to see me, lead the way."

The girl corrected him impassively, "My mistress is not the Prince of Beiyang."

Ma Liren quickly explained, "This is the Sword Maiden serving the princess consort."

The girl glanced at Ma and commanded, "The journey has been progressing too quickly. My mistress wishes to take this rare opportunity outside the palace to appreciate the local customs. She expects you to arrange this accordingly. She does not repeat herself."

Ma Liren bowed immediately. "Rest assured, Her Highness will be satisfied."

As the girl turned and walked away, Ma gave Dou a discreet push and whispered urgently, "Be careful, Hero Dou. Among this entire entourage, she is the most dangerous one."

"The prime minister's sister would be manageable if they were blood-related. But the fact that they're not makes her all the more perilous."

Dou understood the gravity of those words.

If Chen Taizhen had risen to power through familial ties, she would merely be riding on Chen Qingyao's coattails. But the truly terrifying part was that Chen Taizhen and Chen Qingyao were not siblings—they merely shared the same surname, with no blood relation whatsoever. Even the name "Chen Taizhen" might be entirely fabricated.

*Some ancient monster pretending to be young,* Dou mused.

Steeling himself, he followed the girl until they reached an ornate carriage. She gestured for him to enter. As he approached the curtain, a pale hand reached out to draw it aside, revealing a young woman who appeared to be an older version of the girl—same features, same attire, as if she had aged seven or eight years.

Inside, the carriage was surprisingly spacious—more like a study. Books lined the shelves, and a woman in a black dress knelt on a cushion, quietly reading.

Two attendants stood on either side—one middle-aged, the other elderly—both bearing an uncanny resemblance to the girl. It was as if they were the same person at different stages of life: childhood, youth, middle age, and old age.

Chen Taizhen's appearance wasn't strikingly beautiful, but the black mole between her eyebrows lent her an air of sacred dignity, making her unforgettable.

*Demon consort?* Dou scoffed internally. *Where did that nickname even come from?*

He remained motionless, waiting as Chen Taizhen continued reading.

After a long while, she finally set the book aside. The middle-aged attendant stepped forward to massage her shoulders, and Chen Taizhen leaned back in contentment, her gaze settling on Dou.

After scrutinizing him thoroughly, she spoke with satisfaction, "Chen Taizhen is about to die. She cannot remain caged in the Prince of Beiyang's residence like a songbird. I need a new identity."

"Initially, I hadn't decided. But seeing you gave me an idea."

"Dou Taizhen—how does that sound? If you dislike it, you may choose another for me."

She paused, then shook her head. "No, no, that still isn't quite right."

"My brothers are all peerless heroes, rare in this world. The top rank on the Human Ranking would barely suffice, but you're still three parts short."

"Yet behind every successful brother stands a devoted sister."

"Jin Sanming, the Bloody Hand—a rising star among demonic cultivators, ranked seventy-ninth on the Human Ranking—would be perfect for you, Brother Changsheng."

"The bottom of the ranking sounds too unimpressive. Seventy-nine has a much better ring to it."

"I've already calculated the timing. Tonight, you'll defeat Jin Sanming, just in time for tomorrow's ranking update."

*What a pity,* she lamented inwardly. *If not for that meddling old man, Jin Wuming—the Heaven's Lament Hand, ranked nineteenth—would have been the ideal stepping stone for Brother Changsheng's fame.*

*But if the younger brother is beaten, the elder will surely come seeking revenge. Then it won't be my fault.*

*How kind I am—always eager to help when I see an earnest young man.*
