# Chapter 159: The Red List of the Jianghu, The Transformation of the Physical Body

Dawn was about to break.

Li Xian wore light clothing, water droplets still clinging to the tips of his hair. A four-inch-long sword mark marred his chest, neither too deep nor too shallow, with no lingering internal Qi.

After applying medicinal ointment, it would heal completely in two days.

Li Xian rested for a moment and consumed one gram of Spirit Treasure. He retained four strands of Heaven and Earth Essence. Calculating the time, if he practiced martial arts diligently, he could digest it within two days.

Practicing martial arts and sparring with others are both ways to comprehend the world. This can speed up the digestion of "Heaven and Earth Essence."

The leaders of the Mountain Wind Stronghold and the Black Water Gang, Zheng Xuezhang, were all unorthodox practitioners. Every time they consumed Spirit Treasures, although they retained a fair amount of essence, they struggled to digest it.

Practicing superior martial arts can further aid in the digestion of essence.

The Madam was in seclusion, and there were no matters in the manor. Around the Chen hour (7-9 AM), Li Xian rode back to Qingning County. As soon as he entered the hall, Zhang Hou said, "Sir, you have returned."

Li Xian asked, "Is there something wrong?"

Zhang Hou took a piece of paper, spread it out, and said, "Sir, please take a look." He then explained the situation from this morning.

Early this morning, the Martial Commander Hall suddenly heard the sound of hoofbeats. The yamen runners went out to check and found a servant claiming to be a messenger from the Prefecture City, delivering this "Red List of the Jianghu."

The servant said, "The Martial Commander of Qingning holds down a region. It is time to eliminate the names on the Red List to accumulate merit. In the future, you may ascend to the heavens, patrol on behalf of the sky, and bring glory to your ancestors."

The so-called Red List refers to the vicious bandits of the Jianghu. Simply put, it is a wanted list, but it is not just a wanted list. Many extremely evil criminals take pride in climbing onto the "Red List."

"The people on the Red List are terrifying, with a reputation for killing that plagues a region. As a Martial Commander, I can eliminate the wicked, accumulate insights into the Martial Way, and digest Heaven and Earth Essence. There are many benefits."

"I have been in office for some time. This Red List should have been delivered long ago, but it only arrived today, and it came from the Prefecture City. Is the Cao family scheming behind this, using this opportunity to deal with me?"

Li Xian thought of this and asked, "What else did that servant say?"

Zhang Hou said, "The other criminals' names don't matter much. But the third on the list, 'The Child-Eating Old Man,' is a major criminal who has been hiding for a year. Now that his tracks have finally appeared, he is in the vicinity of Qingning County."

"The servant said that we must take this opportunity to arrest him within ten days. Otherwise, we might be accused of negligence. Since the new County Magistrate is taking office now, if we handle this poorly, I'm afraid it will be hard to explain."

Zhang Hou said angrily, "That servant had an arrogant look on his face, looking down his nose at people. I don't know what he's so proud of; it's truly hateful. Punishing the wicked and eliminating evil is our duty, but his words seemed to imply something else."

"He is threatening me," Li Xian understood. He knew his guess was correct; the Cao family wanted to get rid of him and had specifically devised this plan.

The Cao family, relying on their status as a large clan with immense power and deep roots, disdained playing tricks on Li Xian. Therefore, they put their methods on the table to see how he would respond.

That Child-Eating Old Man was certainly not weak. If they were to meet, the outcome of a battle would be hard to predict. They were forcing Li Xian to eliminate him, placing him in danger.

If Li Xian sought safety and did not hunt down the Child-Eating Old Man, the Cao family could use this to make trouble, framing him with the crime of "colluding with bandits and aiding their escape."

At that time, the county soldiers would surround and suppress him, which would be extremely easy. The Cao family's power was overwhelming, and their actions were naturally extremely domineering. Step by step, they were trying to force Li Xian into a dead end.

"Martial Commander, what was the servant threatening?" Zhang Hou asked, confused.

Li Xian did not answer. This matter had nothing to do with him; there was no need to make him worry.

Li Xian had people draw portraits of the criminals and posted them on the board outside the hall. He struck the copper gong loudly, asking the neighbors to pay attention to the portraits. If they had any information, they could report it.

He warned everyone to pay attention to the facial features of the criminals. If they encountered them, they should avoid them immediately to avoid unnecessary casualties.

Evening arrived in the blink of an eye.

Li Xian had practiced martial arts for half a day and was extremely hungry. There was a noodle shop across the street from the Martial Commander Hall. The owner cooked hot noodles with a unique flavor and a tantalizing aroma.

Zhang Hou bought two bowls of hot noodles, adding three pieces of beef and two eggs. He brought them to Li Xian's table.

Li Xian slurped up the hot noodles and ate with great satisfaction. He took out the Red List and read it carefully: Three-Headed Flood Dragon Hou Li Wangsan, Blood Tooth Wang Ya, The Child-Eating Old Man Chu Niangpo Lao...

For each criminal, the martial arts they used and the evil deeds they committed were briefly recorded. Their recent locations were detailed, as if afraid Li Xian wouldn't be able to find them.

"Although the Cao family's plan is treacherous, this Red List is not necessarily a good training manual. The strong forge ahead, while the weak shrink back."

After finishing the noodle soup, Li Xian prepared his knife, bow, and sword and went out alone. He was born cautious; although he didn't demand perfection in everything, he always left a way out for himself beforehand.

He equipped himself fully with poison powder, flying darts, and hidden weapons. He even bought a map, memorizing it silently, focusing on the river systems.

Possessing the "Azure Water Pearl," river systems and great lakes were all his retreats. Li Xian had an excellent memory and was very familiar with Qingning County. In the past, when hunting in the wild, he had traversed the great mountains and rivers. Being alone in the mountains, he hadn't known their appearance clearly. Many places he had been to before lacked a systematic concept.

Now, looking at the map from above, he quickly understood it clearly. That very night, holding the Red List, he went to find criminals for training.

Midnight.

Li Xian walked to a riverbank and looked into the distance. Sure enough, he saw a boat house by the river. The boat house floated on the water, based on four boats several zhang long.

"The Red List: The Gluttonous Couple. The husband likes to eat kidneys, the wife likes to eat intestines. The couple poses as boatmen, ferrying people across the river. They pick their prey."

"If the passenger is to their liking, they steer the boat to the middle of the river, kill them, take their kidneys and intestines to consume, and chop the remaining meat to feed the fish."

Li Xian silently recalled the description. He scooped up some dirt on the ground and smeared it on his face to cover the red mole between his eyebrows. He walked to the river and said, "Boatman, I'm in a hurry. Can you ferry me across the river?"

The boatman was startled. Seeing Li Xian's dirty face, he said, "It's so late. Where are you going across the river?"

"Hehe, naturally to the Miao Xiang Fang in Huangyu City," Li Xian laughed.

"You?" The boatman's eyes lit up. "I've heard of that Miao Xiang Fang. They are all demons that eat people. You look fairly strong, but you might not be able to withstand those demons. They'll eat your vital energy!"

Li Xian laughed heartily. "Not afraid, not afraid." He patted his chest. "You don't know. I was born with iron kidneys. My nickname is 'Three Days and Nights Unyielding.'"

"Oh?" The boatman asked suspiciously, "Are you bragging?"

Li Xian laughed. "You have no experience. Forget it, forget it. You'll never get the chance to see my prowess anyway. Why am I telling you this? Boatman, are you going to take a passenger or not? Give me an answer."

"This big river isn't just your boat. If you won't take me, I'll find another."

The boatman said, "Hehe, I see you're in a sexual hurry. Alright, I'll take you for a ride, but I'll charge you more."

He then shouted towards the house, "Old woman, we have a guest! Come give me a hand!"

A middle-aged woman walked out, muttering, "How is there a guest so late? Sigh, let's finish this quickly and go back to bed to sleep."

"You thief man, if you don't pay your dues tonight, I'll cut open your belly and slice your intestines."

The woman looked fierce.

The boatman gave a sheepish smile. "You old woman, the guest is still here. Why are you saying such scary things?"

Li Xian observed the couple's expressions and words. Their eyes hid a violent aura; they had killed countless people. The room reeked of blood, and flies surrounded the boat. It seemed the Red List's record was indeed accurate.

The boatman shouted and rowed the oar, heading towards the opposite bank. The Longhua River's current was swift. The woman held an oar and slapped the water surface fiercely.

Using some unknown technique, she dispersed the swift current, making the boat move steadily without drifting with the waves.

Li Xian sat on a small stool in the boat and said with a smile, "Boatman, your wife's skill isn't bad."

"Nonsense. How could she be my wife otherwise?" the boatman laughed.

The boatman thought of his wife's words and asked again, "I say, guest, are you really not lying to me? Are your kidneys really that powerful?"

"Naturally," Li Xian said.

"I'm really envious," the boatman said. "To be honest with you, I've had weak kidneys since I was a kid. I even wet my pants when I pee. I've been married to that old woman for over ten years, and I don't have a single child. Sigh."

Hearing his lament, the woman's eyes flashed with a sharp light. She remained calm, but her peripheral vision was already observing Li Xian's movements.

The boatman continued, "My mother said, 'What you eat is what you补 (nourish).' I've eaten pig kidneys and sheep kidneys since I was a kid, but it was no use. Human kidneys, however, have some effect."

Li Xian laughed. "By that logic, do you want to eat my kidneys?"

The boatman said, "If you agreed, that would be best." As soon as the words left his mouth, the woman suddenly swung her oar and smashed it toward Li Xian.

This oar looked like wood, but it was actually filled with lead and iron. From the way she dispersed the swift current earlier, one could see the clues. This woman had immense strength and was not lacking in skill.

Li Xian raised his hand and caught it, firmly grasping the oar. "The Gluttonous Couple, so it really is you." He had chatted idly all night just to lure the two into making a move, so as not to harm an innocent person by mistake.

The woman shouted, "Thief man, this guy is stronger than me!"

The boatman was stunned. He splashed water with both arms, aiming for Li Xian's eyes. At the same time, he pressed a mechanism, and the oar turned into a large guandao, slashing horizontally.

Li Xian spotted a flaw, stepped on the guandao, and pinned it under his foot. Two flashes of blade light passed, and the couple's heads rolled to a spot together.

\[Great Luo Blade Art, killed a bandit, proficiency +29\]
\[Great Luo Blade Art, killed a bandit, proficiency +31\]

Li Xian waited quietly for the boat to reach the shore.

One of the Red List's criminals had been executed!

The moonlight was dim. Li Xian washed his blade by the riverbank, his sleeves stained with blood. Li Xian was very dissatisfied; his blade work still needed improvement. Stains from cloth, mud, and oil were easy to clean. Only bloodstains were troublesome.

If the stain were any bigger, the clothes would be ruined.

Li Xian had suffered before and knew the value of clothing.

"My martial arts are now considered to have some achievement. It is time to stop practicing behind closed doors, find people to spar with, accumulate experience, and seek more applications for my techniques."

The crescent moon hung in the sky; tonight there was no wind or clouds. Li Xian searched the couple's bodies. Under the boatman's shoe, he found a silver bill. From the inner pocket of the woman's sleeve, he found some copper coins.

There were no secret manuals of divine power, only a good prescription for nourishing the kidneys.

Li Xian said, "You've done plenty of robbery and murder, so why are you still so poor?"

And so it went.

Li Xian hunted criminals and sparred based on the Red List, tireless. The yamen runners didn't see him, but everything remained the same as he practiced martial arts diligently every day.

In these seven days, he first beheaded the Gluttonous Couple, then killed the Life-Stealing Scholar, and later eliminated Blood Tooth Wang Ya...

One by one, the heads of the Red List criminals were severed. Li Xian was fresh out of the gate, but he grew rapidly. Many of the Red List criminals, hearing his name, fled in panic.

Experience and insight were accumulated this way.

\[You fought against the wicked with great prestige, high-spirited and vigorous. You digested Heaven and Earth Essence. Proficiency in Eating Essence +1\]
\[You fought against a martial artist who eats essence and beheaded him with your sword. You felt an insight, the digestion of Heaven and Earth Essence accelerated. Proficiency in Eating Essence +1\]
\[You consumed a Spirit Treasure. Proficiency +1\]

The criminals varied in strength. The weak could commit countless crimes with just a kitchen knife, a thief's heart, and a thief's courage.

The strong could circulate Qi through the meridians, seal their blood and pores, and even step into the realm of Eating Essence.

The accumulation of martial arts progress was secondary. When martial artists consume Spirit Treasures, their bodies approach the state of the universe. Sparring with others is like two worlds colliding.

With the stimulation of a strong enemy, the digestion speed increases significantly.

\[Eating Essence\]
\[Proficiency: 10/100\]
\[Description: Martial artists drink the essence of heaven and eat the essence of earth, exploring the infinite. You have digested a certain amount of Heaven and Earth Essence, your realm has increased, and your physical body has undergone further transformation!\]
