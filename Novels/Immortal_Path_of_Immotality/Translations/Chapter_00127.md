# Chapter 126: "I Am Zixiao Sect's Thunderwind Disciple"

Under the supervision of the joint investigation team from the three demonic sects, Lin Shan gathered all the cultivators under his command in the Xiayi Sea region and spread the news that the remnants of the East Sea forces—Old Man Tortoise and his disciples—had fled to nearby waters.

Following the orders of the investigation leader, a Dharma Protector from the Blood River Hall, every island in the Xiayi Sea had to be monitored, with personnel stationed at each location. As an envoy, Lin Shan was required to personally patrol the area daily and report any suspicious activity immediately.

After issuing a long list of stringent commands, the Blood River Hall Dharma Protector finally left with the massive investigation team to assign tasks in the next sea region.

Once the group was gone, Lin Shan's expression immediately darkened. Not only was he in a foul mood, but all his subordinates were equally disgruntled. Just as their missionary work was nearly complete and they could finally rest, this mess had erupted.

Who was Old Man Tortoise? Every East Sea rogue cultivator present knew all too well.

He was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator who had fought his way out of the siege at Turtle Fishing Island. Despite three years of relentless pursuit by the three demonic sects, he remained at large!

If they encountered him, they wouldn’t even have time to call for help, let alone escape.

Even with his hidden trump cards, Lin Shan had no confidence in facing a late-stage Golden Core cultivator. The gap between early Foundation Establishment and late Golden Core was enormous.

Though he considered half-heartedly complying with orders, the words of the investigation team leader still echoed in his ears: "Those who dare to feign compliance will be executed without mercy!"

Who knew if there were spies among his hundred subordinates? If someone reported him, he’d be dead without a burial ground.

"Forget it, let’s just follow orders."

"The Xiayi Sea is vast, with hundreds of islands. The chances of running into him are slim."

"Consider it a chance to relax."

After reassuring his subordinates with some comforting words and a crash course in probability theory, he managed to calm their fears.

Lin Shan then assigned tasks—one person to small islands, two to medium-sized ones, and three to large ones—each to be stationed with a communication talisman. If they spotted Old Man Tortoise or his followers, they were to quietly relay the message first.

As for himself, he reluctantly began his daily patrols.

Higher-ups had policies; subordinates had countermeasures.

Patrolling daily was fine, but with a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s flight speed, covering the entire Xiayi Sea—spanning thousands of miles—was impossible. So he decided to patrol only the inner region during broad daylight.

Night patrols? No way. He needed to rest and recover his spiritual power at night. Everyone knew fugitives moved under cover of darkness—patrolling then would be suicidal.

Days passed as rumors spread across nearby sea regions, and the joint investigation team deployed forces widely, marking the beginning of a massive manhunt.

On the ninth day of the sixth month, whispers emerged of Old Man Tortoise being spotted in the northern Hongqi Sea.

On the twenty-third, official reports confirmed that the joint investigation team in the northeastern Huangsha Sea had killed five of Old Man Tortoise’s Foundation Establishment disciples.

By the twenty-ninth, rumors circulated about a recording stone capturing images of a severely injured man coughing blood—likely Old Man Tortoise.

On the fifth day of the seventh month, eyewitnesses claimed Old Man Tortoise had led his followers to the Tiger Shark Sea, where they massacred hundreds of cultivators from the Hundred Ghost Sect.

By the twelfth, sect transmissions suggested Old Man Tortoise was heading south.

On the twenty-fifth, official news reported that the joint investigation team had intercepted and killed dozens of fugitives in the Qinyang Sea, though Old Man Tortoise escaped severely wounded.

On the first day of the eighth month, rumors spread that Old Man Tortoise had fled into the Xiayi Sea.

On the second, after a long day of patrolling, Lin Shan returned exhausted to his cave abode—only to find an uninvited guest already waiting in his cultivation chamber.

"Forgive this old man for intruding unannounced, young friend!"

---

The night sea was eerie, with demonic birds screeching under the moonlight.

Lin Shan stood frozen at the entrance of his secret chamber, cold sweat dripping down his back as he stared at the pale, weakened Golden Core elder inside. The cave’s entrance had silently sealed shut, and a transparent barrier—a trapping formation—had risen around him. In the courtyard behind him stood a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Trapped between them, Lin Shan discreetly gripped his Wind Escape Talisman, only to realize the formation blocked all airflow, rendering it useless.

"Out of fifty islands in the Xiayi Sea, why did it have to be mine?" he thought, swallowing hard as he desperately plotted his escape.

There was no mistaking it—the intruder was Old Man Tortoise, whom Lin Shan had seen at the Turtle Fishing Island gathering. The young man behind him was likely a surviving disciple who had followed the fugitive all this way, now blocking his retreat.

Lin Shan sensed grave danger. Old Man Tortoise had infiltrated his abode in broad daylight and set up a killing formation.

His mind raced—should he use his Blazing Wildfire Talisman? He wasn’t sure how severely injured Old Man Tortoise was, but the talisman’s power, equivalent to a full-force strike from a late Golden Core cultivator, might kill him outright.

Even if it didn’t, it might break the formation, allowing him to use his Wind Escape Talisman. But in such a confined space, would the blast kill him too? Was this a suicide move?

---

Unbeknownst to Lin Shan, Old Man Tortoise was even more troubled.

After fleeing across countless sea regions and recently being ambushed and severely wounded by the demonic sects’ enforcement team, he had stumbled upon this spiritual vein to recover. Killing Lin Shan would only expose his location—major sects kept soul lamps for their disciples, and death would be detected instantly.

But imprisoning him would also raise suspicions when the regional overseer vanished.

At his peak, escape might have been possible, but now, surrounded by enemies with only one disciple left, the situation was dire.

The tension thickened as moonlight streamed into the cave, casting long shadows over the three motionless figures.

Finally, Old Man Tortoise broke the silence with unexpected words: "If I recall correctly, young friend, you seemed affiliated with the Zixiao Sect when we briefly met three years ago."

Lin Shan was stunned. Why was the Golden Core elder reminiscing instead of attacking? Then he remembered—at the East Sea gathering, he had sat with Thunderrain Disciple Lin Fan from the Zixiao Sect. Their association must have caught Old Man Tortoise’s eye.

Analyzing the situation, Lin Shan realized Old Man Tortoise was in a bind—too injured to risk killing him but desperate for shelter.

Seizing the opportunity, Lin Shan played along: "Your insight is impeccable, Senior. I am Thunderwind Disciple, a true disciple of the Zixiao Sect. Greetings, Elder."

Old Man Tortoise stroked his beard skeptically. "You hold such status?"

The young man in the courtyard scoffed, "I investigated you today. You’re Lin Shan, the Black Lotus Sect’s envoy overseeing the Xiayi Sea!"

Unfazed, Lin Shan straightened his robes with calm composure. "A year ago, my sect ordered me to infiltrate the Black Lotus Sect and gather intelligence on demonic activities."

Old Man Tortoise’s eyes gleamed. "Proof?"

With a crackle, Lin Shan activated his "Wind Thunder Qi," swirling with wind and lightning—a signature of Zixiao Sect’s rare dual-element cultivation.

Both men appeared astonished. Dual wind and lightning spiritual roots, cultivated to Foundation Establishment, were nearly exclusive to the Zixiao Sect in the Great Song Dynasty.

The young man remained doubtful. "You could be from distant Lu Country, where such techniques might be common."

Lin Shan smiled faintly. "I hail from the Lin Clan of Qinghe County in the Great Song’s southern border. My clansman Lin Fan and I joined the Zixiao Sect together. How could I be a foreigner?"

The young man faltered—verifying this in the vast East Sea was impossible.

But Old Man Tortoise nodded approvingly. "Indeed, young friend is a Zixiao Sect disciple!"

Lin Shan was taken aback. The elder believed him so easily? He had more arguments prepared!

"No mistake! I saw you three sect brothers attending the feast together—clearly close comrades." Old Man Tortoise seemed more convinced than Lin Shan himself, swiftly shifting to camaraderie. "Incidentally, I share a deep friendship with your Elder Ge."

Lin Shan seized the opening, feigning excitement. "Elder Ge of the Outer Sect Affairs Hall, in charge of spirit beast provisions?"

Old Man Tortoise’s cheek twitched, but he played along, puffing up with pride. "Precisely!"

Lin Shan bowed deeply. "So it’s Uncle Tortoise!"

"Nephew Lin!"

"Uncle Tortoise!"

"Nephew Lin!"

Tears welled in their eyes as if reunited after decades, nearly embracing.

The young disciple in the courtyard was baffled. They’d confirmed nothing yet were acting like long-lost relatives. Was his master senile?

But the pair inside were already lost in their melodramatic reunion.
