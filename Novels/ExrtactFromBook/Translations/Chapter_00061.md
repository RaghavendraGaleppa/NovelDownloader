# Chapter 61: Choosing the Magical Artifact  

Upon hearing Li Changle's words, Han Yue stopped worrying about the golden eagle and began controlling the chains to monitor its flight direction.  

The golden eagle was Li Changle's chosen means of transportation for Han Yue. Their journey to Luzhou would span at least several hundred thousand miles. In Li Changle's view, a first-rank cultivator like Han Yue would struggle to keep up with him on the return trip to the sect.  

He was unaware of the sheer speed of Han Yue's **[Earth-Treading Golden Light Art]**, making the capture of this eagle a natural choice.  

As they soared through the skies, Han Yue seized the opportunity to ask Li Changle about selecting his Dao-Bearing Artifact.  

"Master, after studying the *Nine Heavens Spirit Refinement Secret Record* these past few days, I'm still uncertain about how to choose my Dao-Bearing Artifact."  

Li Changle replied, "Though your major cultivation path remains undecided, given your exceptional mastery of *Nourishing Body Thunder*, you will undoubtedly choose one of the three thunder-based techniques from our Divine Thunder Palace, all of which lead directly to the fifth rank.  

"Thus, your best options for a Dao-Bearing Artifact lie within these two lineages. Artifacts from these lineages provide immense benefits to our Divine Thunder Palace disciples. Sooner or later, you'll refine at least two lineage artifacts for yourself."  

Han Yue followed up, "How much difference does the choice within the same lineage make?"  

"Within the same lineage, it comes down to personal preference and subsequent refinement—there's no practical difference."  

Li Changle's words solidified Han Yue's decision. He retrieved **[Mao Hour Gold]** and **[Yin Hour Silver]** from his **[Silver Hairpin]** and said,  

"Master, according to the *Nine Heavens Spirit Refinement Secret Record*, third-rank metallic minerals can serve as the primary materials for artifacts of these two lineages. I obtained these two third-rank materials by chance—are they suitable?"  

Li Changle was taken aback. He took the materials, examining them carefully before exclaiming,  

"Since when is Guizhou so wealthy? A first-rank cultivator like you has managed to gather two third-rank materials?"  

Han Yue hadn't expected such a strong reaction. He replied, "I had some opportunities to accumulate wealth and managed to purchase a few third-rank materials during an exchange gathering. Most cultivators around me don’t have such means.  

"Master, as a fifth-rank sect, wouldn’t the Divine Thunder Palace have ample resources?"  

In Han Yue's mind, the Divine Thunder Palace, as a major fifth-rank sect ruling over Luzhou, should have inexhaustible resources and treasures.  

Yet Li Changle gave a surprising answer:  

"In terms of individual combat prowess, our Divine Thunder Palace disciples are second to none! Each generation's true disciples are pillars capable of suppressing entire realms. Across all ranks, our disciples are unmatched in divine abilities and combat strength.  

"However, among our sect's great techniques, very few aid in accumulating wealth. Moreover, Luzhou is a land of treacherous mountains and rivers, with a fiercely independent populace.  

"The cultivators raised here are all battle-obsessed. Few have the patience for alchemy, artifact forging, or financial management.  

"If you told them to trade all their worldly possessions for combat power, they'd rush to do so. But if you asked them to exchange their battle techniques for alchemy or artifact-crafting skills to earn wealth, none would be willing.  

"Once you join the sect, you’ll understand soon enough."  

Li Changle revealed a glimpse of the Divine Thunder Palace’s reality.  

Han Yue began forming a vague image of his future sect in his mind—though he didn’t yet know that within the **[Jade Sky Realm]**, the Divine Thunder Palace was mockingly called the "Northern Savages" by other major sects.  

They were notorious for being aggressive, poor, and stubborn. With such a reputation, their disciples made far more enemies than friends during travels.  

After all, compared to the elegant, fragrant alchemists of the Dharma Blossom Pill Sect or the wealthy, dashing artifact-smiths of the Heavy Mystic Sect, who would prefer the penniless, belligerent brutes of the Divine Thunder Palace?  

Li Changle continued, "That said, our sect’s treasury isn’t lacking—not just in third-rank materials, but even in secret treasures for true disciples.  

"However, accumulating sect contributions and gathering materials for a Dao-Bearing Artifact is a necessary part of cultivation. The sect won’t provide them for free.  

"Compared to other sects, our disciples are terrible at managing resources. This makes the material-gathering process particularly difficult, leaving most of us perpetually broke.  

"But I’ve never seen a disciple fail to gather materials in the end."  

He wasn’t wrong. When truly desperate, Divine Thunder Palace disciples simply donned masks and "liberated" resources from other continents or realms.  

"Still, Yuanchu, gathering third-rank materials before even reaching the second rank means your fortune is truly exceptional!  

"Though I haven’t returned to the sect in three centuries, with these two materials, you’re likely the wealthiest among all disciples!"  

Han Yue considered this. Being called wealthy wasn’t an exaggeration—even Xiao Luo, a true disciple of another major sect, paled in comparison.  

Li Changle then asked, "Do you have any other ranked metal materials?  

"Since you already have third-rank primary materials, as your master, refining your Dao-Bearing Artifact is my duty. However, I’ll need some additional metals as catalysts."  

Han Yue immediately searched his **[Silver Hairpin]**, eventually pulling out a long-stored ingot. After a moment’s thought, he also handed over the **[Geng Metal Blade Embryo]** at his waist.  

Li Changle inspected them and nodded. "Both are suitable. Have you decided on the artifact’s form?"  

Han Yue replied, "I have no particular preference, but I want it to maximize the power of my divine abilities. If it can also aid cultivation, that would be ideal."  

Han Yue had absolute confidence in his four divine abilities—each was extraordinary. A Dao-Bearing Artifact that amplified their effects would be invaluable.  

His **[Ten Thousand Laws Compendium]** was his greatest secret. Every ability extracted from it served as his ultimate trump card.  

So far, the compendium contained four divine abilities, with six pages still empty.  

Regardless of how these abilities compared to those cultivated by orthodox sects, in sheer quantity, Han Yue was already far ahead.  

Thus, the most crucial function of his Dao-Bearing Artifact would be enhancing the might of his divine abilities!
