# Chapter 152: Elder, Don't Be Anxious

In the night sky, the white peacock glowed with brilliant radiance, saying, "Elder Zhou, don't rush. According to the rules, the half-month period hasn't arrived yet."

Upon hearing this, Zhou Tao felt a throbbing headache.

He believed this couldn't continue. Although nothing was against the rules, he wouldn't be able to explain it to the others once he returned. Which elder didn't have descendants or beloved disciples? Those wondrous medicines already had owners, and some old fellows were even hoping to cultivate them for longevity.

"Then activate the emergency plan; this assessment can end now!" He decisively made the decision from atop the raptor's back.

"What's the reason?" the white peacock asked very seriously.

Zhou Tao said, "Didn't you say that outsiders once spied on the area and secretly made a move, which you stopped?"

"The disturbance has passed, and the situation has calmed," the white peacock replied.

Zhou Tao said, "Old Bai, please help me out this once. That was originally an assessment ground, but now it's almost a vegetable patch. Continuing it further is meaningless." The main thing was, how would he explain it to those elders later?

The white peacock nodded, calmly stating, "Without major casualties, even if the situation is special, according to the rules, it must continue past today."

Hearing the word "rules," Zhou Tao felt a stifling sensation in his chest.

Late at night, in the forest, Qin Ming extracted medicinal essence as he walked.

The wondrous blood, of a light golden hue, steamed in the daylight, quickly atomizing into a fragrant mist that enveloped his entire body as a shower of light. Qin Ming took a deep breath, and the fragrance instantly filled his mouth, as if he were feasting on the morning glow and rinsing his mouth with dew. From head to toe, he was being baptized and purified, every pore opening, as if he were about to ascend to immortality.

Although it wasn't his first time experiencing it, he was willing to repeat this wonderful sensation of extending life, strengthening his foundation, and boosting his power every day. He even felt slightly intoxicated, as if standing in a celestial palace, golden light flowing all over him, white mist swirling around him. With his wide sleeves fluttering, he seemed ready to ride the wind away.

Zhuo Ya looked surprised. He was "taking medicine" directly—what method was he using? One should know that the portion she unexpectedly acquired, she hadn't dared to touch it at all. She would have to go back and ask an elder to help refine it, because the components of the wondrous blood were extremely complex.

"Are you refining medicine with an ancient method?" she asked, catching up. This was similar to some methods researched by old men in esoteric sects, not requiring a pill furnace.

"Yes, heaven and earth as the furnace, Six Supremacy Force as the fire," Qin Ming nodded.

Zhuo Ya didn't believe him, but she thought her cousin's defeat was truly no injustice. Just based on his dragon-slaying methods, two more cousins wouldn't be enough to fight him. She followed him all the way, accompanying Qin Ming to the next area, wanting to see his subsequent methods.

Greenstone Village, named for a large bluestone over ten meters tall by the fiery spring.

"What's wrong?" Zhuo Ya asked in surprise and alarm. There were sounds of weeping in the village, a somewhat sorrowful and gloomy atmosphere.

This was Cao Wuji's assigned area. Logically, one extraordinary person would be enough to handle the blood cases on record and resolve the local demon threats. Qin Ming quickly inquired about the situation. What exactly happened, and where was Cao Wuji?

An old man leaned against the large bluestone, sighing, "Alas, this time we offended the Golden Demon King and caused trouble."

The village chief walked over and explained in detail, saying, "Young Master Cao is a good man. He helped us eliminate demons and resolve hidden dangers. He was very responsible and wanted to get rid of the biggest demon, but he was no match for it and returned severely injured. The Golden Demon King itself didn't cross the boundary, but sent its subordinate demons to retaliate. Now Young Master Cao is injured and can't hold them off."

Soon, Qin Ming and Zhuo Ya saw Cao Wuji. He originally had sword-like brows and starry eyes, very handsome, but now he was in a sorry state, with many injuries on his body. His long black hair was matted with blood, sticking in strands to his forehead and neck. The most serious injuries were to his chest and abdomen, which were almost pierced through and carried a scorched smell. Although the wounds had been treated, they were clearly far from healed.

"It's embarrassing. I failed to eliminate the demon and instead caused problems. I'm sorry to the villagers here," Cao Wuji said. He was originally a talkative youth, capable of properly interacting with people from major sects and ancestral grounds, but now he was rather gloomy and dejected. It could be seen that although Cao Wuji was proud, he also had a strong sense of justice. He didn't know about the wondrous blood; he simply wanted to help the people here get rid of the biggest demon. As a result, he almost sacrificed himself. With his current achievements, he didn't need to bother with that Golden Demon King at all and was already sufficient to become a core disciple of the Six Supremacy Ancestral Ground.

"Brother Cao, don't worry. We'll go help you deal with that demon. You stay here and recover from your injuries," Qin Ming said.

"That's a golden rhinoceros. It has thick skin and tough flesh. Our Heavenlight Force can't even scratch it," Cao Wuji warned seriously. Like Zhuo Ya, he was considered a top-tier extraordinary person, with strength exceeding a thousand catties upon initial rebirth, but he hadn't learned any powerful force techniques. Now, he and Zhuo Ya were merely unpolished jade, somewhat lacking in offensive power. If they mastered the Six Supremacy Force, there was no doubt both would undergo a qualitative transformation!

Cao Wuji insisted on following, wanting to contribute at a crucial moment. Qin Ming pressed his shoulder, saying, "Your injuries are so severe; there's no point in going. Just wait from a distance."

Afterward, he and Zhuo Ya saw two corpses and three severely injured villagers in the village. Some had their chests pierced by horns, while others had their bodies severed in two. According to the villagers, some people had also been abducted to serve the demons in the Golden Demon King's territory. Moreover, just today, two Outer Saint-level demons had also brought some rhino demons to cause trouble.

Soon after, Qin Ming and Zhuo Ya stepped into the dense forest. Cao Wuji, ignoring their advice, followed from afar.

The Golden Rhinoceros's dwelling was flat and open, all trees having been cleared, forming a large grassland with a cluster of buildings. In such open terrain, sneak attacks were impossible. In fact, Qin Ming hadn't intended to act secretly. This time, he had come to deter the demons in the surrounding areas; he would openly and powerfully slay this Golden Demon King!

From a great distance, he saw more than twenty raggedly dressed men and women washing the backs of some old rhinoceroses and teaching young demons how to read.

"Ah..." A scream echoed. An old man, while trimming the hooves of a sturdy white rhinoceros, somehow angered it. He was kicked flying, spitting large mouthfuls of blood, with at least four ribs broken. He lay there on his back, in immense pain, unable to move.

"If you don't get up, you'll die," the white rhinoceros bellowed. It had already seen Qin Ming on the horizon and didn't care at all, doing this specifically for him and Zhuo Ya to witness.

With a boom, the distant ground exploded. Qin Ming charged forward, so fast that the white rhinoceros's pupils contracted. It sensed something was wrong, but it was too late to dodge. Qin Ming's entire body flowed with the aura of plants and trees. A verdant longsword appeared in his hand, and the entire grassland resonated with him, all the blades of grass rustling. Green mist uplifted him as he swept across.

With a wet thud, blood splattered. Qin Ming used his Yimu Sword to cleave the white rhinoceros in two, surging through its bisected corpse without stopping his pace, then immediately beheaded another Outer Saint-level old rhinoceros. Without uttering a word, he simply began a massacre in this area. In an instant, eighteen demon corpses, including rhinoceros demons and dog demons, lay sprawled across the grassland, blood covering the ground, shocking all the demons and enslaved humans.

Behind him, Cao Wuji watched in a daze. "This brother is really wild, just charging in like that?"

A low, suppressed roar emanated from the buildings, followed by a surge of golden light. A colossal rhinoceros appeared, stomping with heavy steps, its demonic aura billowing. It was entirely golden, taller than a giant elephant, like a small mountain. Every step it took shook the grassland, and fierce flames burned around its body. It charged furiously, shaking the earth and mountains, locking onto the human youth ahead.

Qin Ming was not at all hesitant. The Yimu Sword in his hand burst forth with dazzling green light, the entire grassland seemed to undulate with him, and a dense green mist ascended. He accelerated his run, charging towards the colossal demon.

"Brother, don't be reckless! You need agility to defeat it!" Cao Wuji shouted from behind, fearing Qin Ming would be impaled and killed by the giant rhinoceros in a single encounter.

Qin Ming swung the increasingly large Yimu Sword in his hand, and with a resounding crash, it struck the giant rhinoceros's head. The Golden Rhinoceros roared, completely enraged. A wound appeared on its head, bleeding profusely and staining half of its bovine face red.

"He injured it? Is he that strong?" Cao Wuji was greatly shaken in his heart. The opponent's Heavenlight Force was incredibly outrageous! Zhuo Ya, however, was calm; she had already witnessed it.

Qin Ming's expression was serious. To only open a single gash on the rhinoceros's head, this demon's defense was truly astonishing. Since he intended to deter the surrounding demons, he naturally had to display his true abilities. In an instant, he clenched his fists and began to clash head-on with the great demon.

The Golden Rhinoceros's demonic aura soared to the heavens, its entire body wreathed in fierce flames. The fiery light shot from its horns, like bolts of lightning, gathered into solidified beams that could swiftly incinerate an Outer Saint's flesh, striking out one after another. Its movements were surprisingly agile, quickly shifting its massive body, attempting to impale and slay Qin Ming with its horns. In an instant, enormous sounds reverberated throughout this area. The Golden Rhinoceros charged savagely, its demonic flames raging, destroying large swathes of grassland. Even when tall buildings blocked its path, it simply charged straight through, leaving behind a trail of ruins.

Qin Ming unleashed his full power, clashing head-on and blocking the Golden Rhinoceros, whose demonic aura surged to the sky. His entire body glowed, as if he stood in a pure land. His two fists, like golden crows illuminating all directions, flew and pounded, making the giant rhinoceros roar continuously, its body trembling incessantly. He continuously bombarded it with his strongest Heavenlight Force, marveling internally. Such thick-skinned and tough old demons were indeed difficult to deal with; how many punches had he landed already? No wonder Cao Wuji was severely injured and almost died here.

At this moment, the Golden Rhinoceros trembled, feeling its internal organs damaged, and even its golden hide showed cracks. It could no longer hold out. As Qin Ming unleashed his strongest Heavenlight Force once more, the massive rhinoceros's body swayed, letting out an enraged roar. All the light on its body converged on its longest horn, which then moved like a golden flying sword streaking across the void, blasting apart all nearby buildings.

Qin Ming shifted his body horizontally, quickly dodging. That was the ultimate golden firelight, mixed with malevolent aura, truly possessing the momentum to cleave through enemies in all directions. The Golden Rhinoceros went berserk, continuously sweeping.

Qin Ming saw that it was considerably weaker. He tried to engage it with Heavenlight Force and found that he could block that fiery light. Immediately, he confronted the demon directly and clashed with it head-on. Amidst cracking sounds, the Golden Rhinoceros's two horns were successively shattered and fell to the ground. It roared and wailed, struck repeatedly by Qin Ming's fists across its entire body. Finally, with a loud boom, it shattered into pieces, actually exploding.

Qin Ming quickly approached and extracted a large heart, faintly glowing with colorful light. It was indeed a divine creature. All the demons were scared stiff. The old Golden Demon was actually pounded to smithereens!

A group of enslaved humans, whose dull eyes gradually gleamed with light, then began to cheer. Zhuo Ya and Cao Wuji began slaying demons, leaving demon blood everywhere across the grassland.

"This rhino horn has excellent quality, golden and translucent, crystal clear. It would make great wine cups as gifts. Let's split it among the three of us." Qin Ming cut off a large piece of rhino horn, intending to give it to Meng Xinghai, Li Qingyun, and others. Having come to the edge of the world, how could he not bring back some local specialties?

Here, it was a scene of universal joy.

However, Elder Zhou Tao from the Six Supremacy Ancestral Ground was clouded with gloom, feeling his temples throbbing. Another "wondrous medicine" lost? It was almost completely harvested! When Qin Ming heard the news that the assessment would "perfectly" conclude once today passed, he immediately grew anxious, feeling like time waited for no one. He rushed without stopping towards the next area.

Zhou Tao heard that he was acting as if injected with stimulants, rushing wildly and charging towards other areas. Zhou Tao felt as if the sky was falling. It was supposed to be over, so why hadn't this youth stopped? Instead, he had accelerated!

Qin Ming was very disappointed. He went to help his "neighbors" Zhou Lei and Huang Cheng, whom he knew from the Six Supremacy Ancestral Ground, resolve their troubles, but he didn't find any creatures that produced wondrous blood. The two were very grateful, and under their complex gazes, he didn't stop for a moment, rushing to the next location.

Soon, Qin Ming realized something: the areas assigned to extraordinary people seemed to be special, all containing divine creatures, while the demons in other places were quite ordinary. Qin Ming immediately inquired about Cui Chongxuan's whereabouts, not willing to delay for a moment, and fought his way through.

When Cui Chongxuan saw Qin Ming, covered in blood and exuding murderous intent, his heart immediately sank. He said, "Brother, I bear no ill will towards you, you..."

"I'm here to help you eliminate demons. Tell me where the strongest old demon is!" Qin Ming said.

"Why is time passing so slowly? Isn't it over yet?" Zhou Tao felt anxious, living day by day as if pulling a heavy ox cart, because that incredibly powerful youth had found the right area and had already rushed over.

"Elder Zhou, as a senior expert, you must remain calm and not be anxious," the white peacock comforted him.

Zhou Tao was almost at his breaking point, nearly falling off the raptor's back. He said, "How can I not be anxious? Even though there were reasons for this, and the situation was special, several wondrous medicines have been harvested. Can I not go apologize to those old fellows? This matter is too 'rough,' I... I've suffered heavy losses!"

Finally, under Cui Chongxuan's shocked and complex gaze, Qin Ming tossed him the corpse of a purple sable, its heart missing, and walked away without looking back.

Elder Zhou Tao felt dizzy, as if the world was spinning. Would there be any wild "wondrous medicines" left in this area by the end?!

"It's finally over. Have everyone been brought back?" Zhou Tao felt a sense of powerlessness, yet he still had to force a benevolent smile to meet the group of youths.

Qin Ming felt delighted in his heart; this trip had yielded great rewards!
