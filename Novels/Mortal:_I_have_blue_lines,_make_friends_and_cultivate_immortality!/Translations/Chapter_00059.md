# Chapter 59: In and Out, Rocking and Rolling (2/3)

On the fifth day...

In the pitch-black underground world, a rat searched for food within a narrow crevice. Though the gap was tight, its plump body still managed to squeeze through. Finding its desired meal, it squeaked happily in delight.

"Lin Yun, you should join the Masked Moon Sect," Nangong Wan suddenly spoke softly as she gazed at him.

"What? Are you telling me what to do now? No thanks!" Lin Yun shook his head.

"You—hmph—" Nangong Wan was so angry she couldn't speak, only able to snort coldly and turn away. Her sidelong glance still lingered on Lin Yun. 

"Is there nothing else you want to say?"

Lin Yun slapped his forehead. "Ah right, we need to hurry and leave. If we're too late, we'll be stuck here for sixty years."

"That's all you have to say?!" Nangong Wan fumed. "And what do you mean by that? In such a rush to leave?! Would spending sixty years alone with this ancestor really be so unbearable for you?!"

"Why are you looking at me like that? I'm the victim here!" Lin Yun spread his hands innocently. "You're the one who got all the benefits."

It wasn't that Lin Yun didn't want to take responsibility. But according to the rules of fish farming: Never release a shark into your pond before it's big enough, or all the other fish you've painstakingly raised will be lost. 

So Lin Yun planned to expand his pond first before introducing Nangong Wan, this particular shark.

"You—" Nangong Wan was furious. She truly wanted to blast Lin Yun into pieces with her Vermilion Bird Ring right now. 

Not only did he have that monstrous talent for talisman crafting, but his cultivation aptitude was also strangely impressive—despite having five spiritual roots, his progress was alarmingly fast, suggesting some special constitution. 

And let's not forget his strikingly handsome appearance—more so than any Masked Moon Sect disciple. 

Not to mention his physique, which she had personally verified to be exceptionally robust!

Yet here he was, clearly unwilling to take responsibility!

At this thought, Nangong Wan felt deeply wronged. She, a heaven-grade fire spiritual root, a Core Formation elder of the Masked Moon Sect, had actually been rejected by a mere Qi Condensation cultivator?!

For a moment, she was on the verge of tears, but she quickly composed herself. After all, she wasn't some lovestruck girl who couldn't extricate herself from romantic entanglements. 

"If you don't want responsibility, I don't even want you!" she huffed proudly, tossing her head. "Don't come begging to me later!"

"After I reach Nascent Soul, I'll capture you and keep you locked in my cave!"

"Then I'll make you beg for death while serving me!" she laughed wildly.

Nangong Wan didn't understand why, but whenever she got too close to Lin Yun, her body would react uncontrollably. 

In this life, she had few indulgences. 

She loved watching him move in and out, and hoped he enjoyed seeing her rock and sway.

[Ding! Nangong Wan's favorability +59. Current favorability: 59 (Love-Hate Relationship)]

Meanwhile, outside...

Han Li, who had been unconscious for nearly two days, groggily rose from the ground, shaking his head.

"My head hurts so much! What happened to me? Where am I?" He looked around in confusion, trying to piece together his memories. 

"I came to the Bloody Trial for Foundation Establishment Pills... then got information about a stone hall from Zhong Wu... was chased by Masked Moon Sect cultivators... Brother Lin saved me..."

"Brother Lin—!"

Han Li jolted fully awake as if doused with cold water. 

He remembered now—he'd been injured by that Masked Moon Sect Core Formation elder, then lost consciousness. 

Turning to look at the collapsed tunnel behind him, Han Li's heart clenched. 

"This is bad—did Brother Lin not make it out while saving me?"

Panicked, he immediately pulled out the Golden Yuan Sword Talisman Lin Yun had given him. 

Han Li was certain Lin Yun was still down there—otherwise, why would he be lying unconscious outside alone? If Lin Yun had escaped, he would've taken Han Li with him.

"Brother Lin, wait for me! Han Li is coming to save you!"

Just as Han Li was about to activate the talisman, a thunderous explosion rocked the ground, sending him tumbling. 

"What's happening? More enemies?" 

"No—the tremor came from underground! Did Brother Lin make it out?"

Han Li rushed outside the stone hall to see a massive crater in the clearing before it. Soaring above was a strange flaming bird. 

Seeing this, Han Li trembled. "That's the Masked Moon elder's magic treasure! The pressure is at least ten times stronger than underground—is this the true power of a treasure?"

Meanwhile, standing atop the Vermilion Bird, Nangong Wan examined her hands in bewilderment. 

"My cultivation is recovering too quickly—I can't control it! This never happened when practicing the Maiden's Reincarnation Art before... Could it be because I lost my purity?"

Her aura had already reached early Foundation Establishment and continued rising unstoppably.

BOOM—

Following the flaming Vermilion Bird, Lin Yun leaped out from the crater. 

After checking his internal condition, he frowned. "Too much spiritual energy—my meridians are about to burst. Is this from absorbing the stored power of Nangong Wan's Maiden's Reincarnation Art? Not time to break through yet—I'll wrap it with the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light first."

He immediately sat cross-legged to meditate and stabilize the turbulent energy.

From above, Nangong Wan glanced down at Lin Yun's aloof silence and snorted. "Hmph! Just you wait!" 

With that, she flew away on her Vermilion Bird.

Seeing the Core Formation elder depart, Han Li hurried over but hesitated to disturb Lin Yun's cultivation. 

After some time, Lin Yun finally opened his eyes. 

"Brother Lin, are you alright?" Han Li asked worriedly.

"Fine," Lin Yun replied as the Bloody Banquet's sky began flickering between light and dark, signaling the imminent closure of the secret realm. 

"Brother Lin, we must leave now or be trapped for sixty years," Han Li urged.

"Let's go." Nangong Wan nodded, casually robbing other sect disciples of their spirit herbs and storage pouches along the way. Combined with previous loot, it should be enough.

He couldn't wait to see Old Freak Qiong's expression upon learning the Masked Moon Sect disciples had been wiped out. 

Then again, someone as eccentric as Qiong probably didn't care about unrelated Qi Condensation ants. 

"That old fox's real target was me, wasn't it?" Lin Yun mused. "Stirring up the other sects to test whether I could survive his little game?" 

"Hmph—"

"Too bad you picked the wrong person. Right now you indeed have the strength to look down on me. I've accepted your 'gift'—let's see if you can handle mine."
