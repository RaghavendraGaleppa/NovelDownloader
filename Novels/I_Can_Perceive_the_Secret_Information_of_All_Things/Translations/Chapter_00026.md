# Chapter 26: The First Storage Artifact in My Cultivation Life  

The Four Seas Two Stones Shop still had its sign hanging, but the interior was in complete disarray—empty of goods and clearly abandoned. A well-dressed cultivator was directing a few workers inside.  

"Take down this shelf. It's tacky and takes up too much space."  

"Stick talismans in the corners to ward off bad luck."  

"The sign hasn't been removed yet—someone come take it down..."  

Xiao Ji stood at the entrance, watching the bustling scene with mixed emotions. It felt like a sure thing had slipped right through his fingers.  

The situation was obvious: the Two Stones Shop had gone out of business, all its goods had been moved, and the dust-covered treasure he had his eye on was now nowhere to be found.  

With a look of concern, Xiao Ji asked, "Hey, fellow cultivator, what happened to this shop?"  

"Changed business. From now on, it's a barbecue place. If you live in Taigu City long-term, come by often—20% off for the first three years of opening." The owner was already trying to attract customers.  

"But why close such a good Two Stones Shop?" Xiao Ji couldn't hide his disappointment.  

"Couldn't make enough spirit stones, simple as that," the owner replied, glancing at Xiao Ji's plain clothes but refined appearance. Though the young man looked poor, his bearing was extraordinary, so the owner didn't dismiss him outright. "The initial business model was flawed. Most cultivators in Taigu City are at least at the sixth level of Qi Refining, with many at Foundation Establishment or even Core Formation. They generally look down on low-grade artifacts."  

"And with Taigu City's high foot traffic comes high rent. The Two Stones Shop relied on thin profits and high turnover, but sales couldn't keep up. Over time, it was doomed to fail."  

"Not to mention, the overhead wasn't cheap. Two spirit stones for one artifact, ten for another, a hundred more—each shop had at least a few hundred artifacts, plus pills and other trinkets. Do the math." The owner chuckled ruefully. "I was impulsive when I started the Two Stones Shop—biggest regret of my life."  

"Barbecue is different. Cultivators still have their earthly desires, and no one can resist the allure of grilled meat. With premium beast cuts and my secret seasoning blend, success is guaranteed."  

Two spirit stones might be precious to ordinary people, but to cultivators, they were trivial.  

The path of cultivation was difficult—not just because of innate talent, but also due to disparities in wealth. More resources meant faster progress.  

This was why mortal emperors who pursued immortality often plunged their kingdoms into chaos, draining their treasuries and leading to ruin.  

Without talent, relying solely on resources was a waste.  

"What happened to the remaining stock? Where did it go?" Xiao Ji pressed.  

The owner thought for a moment. "Some were sold at half price, and the dusty artifacts were bundled and sold to a merchant who trades in Dao City. You're too late—no bargains left."  

Not wanting to push his luck, Xiao Ji gleaned more details through his perception.  

The merchant was still in Taigu City but would leave by month's end, heading to mortal lands to resell the cheap artifacts at triple the price to rogue cultivators.  

Not all cultivators frequented Dao City. Many found it too chaotic, its worldly atmosphere detrimental to cultivation and prone to stirring restlessness.  

After all, exposure to luxury and high-level cultivators bred envy.  

Moreover, visiting Dao City required travel expenses and entry fees—why not just absorb those spirit stones instead?  

This created opportunities for middlemen.  

After getting a rough description of the merchant, Xiao Ji hired a sketch artist among the local cultivators, paying with a few spirit stone fragments.  

With the portrait in hand, he confirmed the likeness with the barbecue owner before setting off to track the merchant down.  

Even with his perception range of thirty zhang (about a hundred meters), finding someone in sprawling Taigu City was no easy task.  

After wandering two streets, he realized this approach wouldn't work.  

After some thought, he decided to seek out the swindler he'd met upon first arriving in the city.  

That guy knew Taigu City inside out. With his help, the search would be much easier.  

Finding a con artist was simple—just go where the crowds were.  

Within an hour, Xiao Ji located him at the floating ship docks.  

He handed the portrait to the swindler. "Keep an eye out for this man at the docks. If you see him, come find me on Main Street."  

The docks were the only exit from Taigu City.  

The swindler was wary of Xiao Ji—something about this young man made him feel exposed, as if every trick would be seen through. For safety's sake, he agreed to help.  

They arranged to meet on Main Street.  

In the meantime, Xiao Ji decided to explore the city.  

There were three benefits to this: earning cultivation points, purchasing a storage artifact, and possibly locating the merchant through local knowledge—far more efficient than searching blindly.  

His first stop was a treasure shop.  

Every artifact inside revealed its attributes, crafting methods, and even flaws to his perception, earning him cultivation points.  

He advanced from the seventh to the eighth level of Qi Refining.  

The shopkeeper, noticing Xiao Ji's prolonged browsing, approached. "Fellow cultivator, you've been here a while. Is there something that catches your eye?"  

"I need a storage artifact," Xiao Ji said.  

The shopkeeper beamed. "You've come to the right place! My shop has the best selection in Taigu City—top quality, unbeatable prices. Look here."  

He led Xiao Ji to a section filled with storage artifacts of various designs, some exquisite, others bizarre.  

"Take this gourd," the shopkeeper said, holding up a small vessel. "Storage gourds are all the rage these days. Huge capacity, easy to carry—just hang it at your waist for an immortal touch. Not 998, just 198!"  

Xiao Ji knew the man wasn't lying but politely listened before admitting, "That's a bit expensive."  

"Then how about this purple-gold top? Stores items and doubles as a fidget toy—size adjustable." The shopkeeper was patient.  

"Truth is, my budget is only ten standard spirit stones. Can you recommend something in that range?" Xiao Ji didn't want to waste time.  

"Ah, frugal living, I see," the shopkeeper said tactfully. "Then this might be your only option."  

From a crate, he pulled out a brick-like object. "Prices have soared—ten stones barely gets you anything these days. But here, miracles happen. Check this out—brick-shaped storage artifact. Ten compartments, and you can even use it as a weapon in a pinch."  

Xiao Ji hefted the brick, then decided to shop around.  

But after visiting other stores, he realized this was the only storage artifact he could afford.  

*Might as well make do. I can always upgrade later.*
