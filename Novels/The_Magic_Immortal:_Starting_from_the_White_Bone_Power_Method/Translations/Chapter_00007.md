# Chapter 7: The White Bone Qi-Devouring Strength Method

Whoosh!
Whoosh!
Whoosh!

Three needles shot out in rapid succession.

The third needle pierced Li Yuan's yinqiao acupoint, twisted slightly, then flew back. Picking it up would have been unclean, so Wang Chan didn't catch it directly. Instead, he first drove the third needle into the nearby soil, channeling the yin evil energy it had absorbed into the earth. Then he used the withered grave's yin energy to cleanse it thoroughly until he was certain no trace remained before retrieving it.

From his storage pouch, he took out a yellow gourd containing spirit spring water, carefully washing the needle several times before drying it meticulously with spirit cloth. Only then did he reluctantly return it to its case.

Meanwhile, Li Yuan, whose yinqiao acupoint had been pierced, saw the protective ghostly shadows around him visibly shrink and fade. The supporting magical energy seemed to be sucked away by an invisible vortex.

At the same time, Madam Cheng's face took on an eerie appearance as pink mist seeped from her pores, enveloping her like a rosy cloud. The peach blossom illusion surrounding her expanded as well.

"Is this... dual cultivation?" Wang Chan shuddered, a chill running from his groin through his entire body.

After a dozen breaths, a cry rang out as Madam Cheng was flung backward, landing beneath a small tree over twenty zhang away. Both the flower illusion and pink mist vanished completely.

Where Li Yuan had stood now lay a desiccated corpse—a skeleton wrapped in skin—an utterly gruesome sight.

The sight sent waves of revulsion through Wang Chan. Recalling how he'd nearly slept with Madam Cheng just days ago, cold sweat drenched his back in waves of retrospective fear.

Women in this world were terrifying!

He must remain chaste, absolutely chaste! Never again would he touch a woman whose background he didn't fully understand!

"I can't hold on any longer, Fellow Daoist Wang. Quick—this is a mid-grade Fireball Talisman. Destroy the evidence."

Collapsed on the ground, Madam Cheng didn't bother dressing. With a wave of her hand, she retrieved a fiery red talisman from her storage pouch and sent it flying toward Wang Chan. Simultaneously, she used a magical hand to collect the corpse's storage pouch.

Having done this, she immediately fell unconscious.

Seeing the talisman approaching, Wang Chan instinctively dodged rather than catching it directly. He hesitated—having fulfilled his promise, he wanted to leave immediately to avoid complications. But she hadn't paid him yet.

After observing carefully to confirm the Fireball Talisman wasn't dangerous, he finally used a magical hand to catch it securely.

Holding the talisman, Wang Chan didn't act immediately. Instead, he coldly observed the corpse for several breaths before shooting another needle at it repeatedly until he was certain it posed no threat. Only then did he approach cautiously with the talisman.

As for Madam Cheng, he didn't spare her a glance—it would be best if she died too, allowing him to reap the rewards. A perfect outcome.

Just as he was about to activate the talisman, a voice sounded in his ear: "Wait, Fellow Daoist Wang!"

Madam Cheng had somehow sat up again. Though her breathing was erratic, she exuded an intensely dangerous aura.

Startled, Wang Chan dropped the talisman and looked at her in confusion.

Madam Cheng studied him for a few breaths before remarking meaningfully, "I never imagined Fellow Daoist Wang's dedication to the Dao would be so firm—you truly uphold your oath. Were I in your place, with no hope of Foundation Establishment, I would have broken my vow, taken advantage of the situation, and killed without hesitation. Yet you... didn't harbor even a trace of murderous intent toward me."

Realization dawned on Wang Chan—Madam Cheng had feigned unconsciousness to test him. Had he attacked, breaking their oath, she would have been free to kill him without restraint.

A chill shot up his spine as his hair stood on end. Human hearts were more treacherous than ghosts! Damn it all!

Had he lacked his golden finger and any hope of advancing, he might indeed have acted as she predicted. The storage pouches of two demonic cultivators would have been a rich haul.

"I must stay far away from this woman—she's nothing but traps and danger," Wang Chan resolved.

Noticing his wariness, Madam Cheng smirked. "Actually, what I gave you wasn't a mid-grade Fireball Talisman but a mid-grade Fireblast Talisman. Their formations are nearly identical... When destroying the evidence, you should first wrap it in magical energy and retreat ten zhang before detonating. Otherwise..."

Wang Chan's scalp prickled again.

"Giggle..."

Still chuckling behind her sleeve, Madam Cheng donned a conservative, dignified dress, her alluring demeanor vanishing as her aura purified completely—now resembling a righteous female cultivator.

She collected the two storage pouches at her waist, then took a jade pouch from one and tossed it to Wang Chan. "Inside are one hundred and three spirit coins. Please handle the cleanup. I'm unwell and must take my leave."

A white talisman slipped from her sleeve, transforming into a gust of wind that carried her swiftly toward Little Tea Mountain—a valuable mid-grade Minor Windriding Talisman.

"My name is Cheng Miaomiao. Feel free to visit Little Tea Mountain, Fellow Daoist Wang. I'm quite taken with your Ten Finger Barrage technique... Oh, and remember to bathe in the river before returning to Lotus Mountain, lest the patrols catch your scent..."

Her whisper faded as the wind carried her beyond the distant treetops.

Wang Chan watched her departure before inspecting the jade pouch. Opening it cautiously, he noted the pile of spirit coins—at least a hundred. The extra three, she'd mentioned, must be payment for disposing of the corpse.

That she'd left the body to him, expended a valuable Fireblast Talisman, then fled urgently with another precious talisman suggested she'd reached her limit and dared not linger.

Stowing the pouch, he picked up the talisman and approached the corpse while examining it with his spiritual sense. Yet he couldn't distinguish between a Fireball and Fireblast Talisman.

Following her instructions, he wrapped the talisman in magical energy and placed it on the corpse before retreating twenty zhang and taking cover at the valley entrance.

"Fizz..."

Black-tinged flames erupted, consuming the corpse to ashes within moments before dissipating. No explosion occurred—it had been a Fireball Talisman all along.

"That deceitful wench!" Wang Chan's face darkened. "When I rise to power, I'll teach her a brutal lesson!"

Cursing, he summoned a gust of wind to scatter the ashes—only for a faintly golden, rib-like object to emerge from the remains.

His eyes narrowed as a magical hand seized it. Spiritual sense revealed its contents, and his expression shifted dramatically.
