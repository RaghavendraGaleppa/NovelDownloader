# Chapter 94: The Plan Succeeds, Infiltrating the Drizzle Pavilion

“This letter is from the Drizzle Pavilion.”

Zuoqiu Yang saw the swallow pattern at the bottom left of the letter and shot to his feet, a murderous aura boiling around him once more.

“Hm?”

Shang Wu narrowed her almond-shaped eyes and swept her gaze over to him.

With a fierce look on his face, Zuoqiu Yang hugged his head and squatted down.

“Master, he seems to know something about the Drizzle Pavilion.”

“Understanding the Drizzle Pavilion's intentions and movements will be helpful for our mission.”

Li Mo reasoned with his master, appealing to her emotions. He then gestured for Zuoqiu Yang to come over and look together, because he couldn't read it himself.

The writing on the letter was likely the Drizzle Pavilion's secret script, more like a form of pictograph. Without specialized study, it was impossible to understand.

Zuoqiu Yang took the letter and began to read aloud:

“Have the three of you not neglected your martial arts?”

“The winds of change are sweeping across the world, yet you brothers are holed up in Huai Shan Town, engaging in the petty trade of looting and plundering. How can you ever hope to stand out this way? With the opening of the Interrogation Trial, you should seize this opportunity to leave the mountains and join the Drizzle Pavilion. From then on, you will have a backer.”

“I, your humble brother, am not without talent. I have advanced a step further in the Observation Realm and have secured the position of 'Man-Slaughterer' in the Drizzle Pavilion.”

Upon reading this, Zuoqiu Yang's voice trembled, and his emotions fluctuated violently.

He could be certain that the one who sent this letter was the sworn enemy who had killed his master. It felt as if the仇人 were right in front of him, and he was enraged.

“I know you're anxious, but don't be in a hurry just yet.”

Li Mo gestured for him to finish reading the letter first.

Zuoqiu Yang took several deep breaths before continuing:

“Recently, I received news that the traitor we killed a few years ago still has a disciple, who has also learned the techniques of our Drizzle Pavilion.”

“To dare to learn the martial arts of our pavilion, it is only right to clean up the门户. You shall kill him for me, then come find me at the old place.”

“The main pavilion plans to establish a branch in Ziyang Prefecture. If you handle this matter well, I will put in a good word for you in front of the branch master, and securing a good position will not be a problem.”

“—Smiling Maitreya.”

...

The letter revealed a great deal of information.

Li Mo and the others fell into deep thought.

“The Drizzle Pavilion is opening a branch in Ziyang Prefecture?”

It was no wonder they had chosen Ziyang Prefecture as the location for the Interrogation Trial. They planned to recruit on the spot.

However, Ziyang Prefecture was located on the edge of the Eastern Wasteland Domain; it was not a prosperous place, and it was far from the center of the storms and tides of the so-called Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Why would the profit-driven Drizzle Pavilion set up a base here?

“Holding the Interrogation Trial is one thing, but daring to extend their influence into Ziyang Prefecture as well?”

Shang Wu's willow-like eyebrows shot upright. “If this old lady finds that branch master, I'll beat the shit out of him.”

One cannot tolerate others sleeping soundly beside one's own bed; this had touched the bottom line of the Clear Abyss Sect.

No sect would tolerate a killer organization setting up a base within its own territory.

But the Drizzle Pavilion's movements were unpredictable, and their spies were everywhere. They were like a slippery troublemaker. Even when the Great Yu Dynasty and several other supreme sects joined forces in the past, they failed to uproot them completely. Destroying one base without being able to eliminate all its members meant a new base would soon pop up again.

“Finding the Drizzle Pavilion's branch will likely not be easy,” Xiao Qin mused as he picked up three iron 'Hall Swallows' from the ground.

Zuoqiu Yang looked at the three Hall Swallows with some confusion.

These Hall Swallows were forged with special techniques. After the Interrogation Trial began, they would absorb a trace of the owner's internal energy. If the owner died, the Hall Swallow would shatter.

Yet these three were perfectly intact.

Could it be because the Huai Shan Three Tyrants all died from their own internal energy?

“Should we... pretend to be the Huai Shan Three Tyrants and infiltrate the Drizzle Pavilion?”

“The numbers match perfectly, if Brother Zuoqiu also joins us,” Xiao Qin said, showing a strong sense of responsibility. Having accepted the sect's mission, he intended to see it through with all his effort.

Zuoqiu Yang shook his head.

“I practice the Unborn Blade. I can't hide my identity in front of members of the Drizzle Pavilion.”

Hearing this, Li Mo glanced at the girl beside him out of the corner of his eye, his gaze filled with inquiry. *Has the girl ever considered becoming an emotionless assassin?*

Ying Bing: “?”

At this moment, Zuoqiu Yang spoke again: “This恐怕 is not feasible. The three of them were clearly on close terms with Smiling Maitreya. If you were to actually meet him, you would be exposed.”

“Unless... we kill Smiling Maitreya! Then no one would know we are fakes.”

Zuoqiu Yang's eyes lit up, as if he had found a chance for revenge.

The opponent was in the Observation Realm. The only way to have a chance was to join forces with these disciples of the Clear Abyss Sect.

---

“Pleasant cooperation.”

Li Mo smiled.

Helping the other party get revenge could be considered an investment, and it would also allow him to complete the sect's mission. He had no reason to refuse.

The next problem was how to find the 'Smiling Maitreya' hiding in the shadows.

“I will search within the city, but it may not yield results in a short time. That person is extremely cautious,” Zuoqiu Yang said. He had been gathering information on the opponent on his way to Ziyang Prefecture, but he still knew very little.

“Rather than us searching for him, it would be better to make him come to us主动,” Li Mo said thoughtfully.

“If we use the identity of the Huai Shan Three Tyrants and rank high in the Interrogation Trial, we might be able to lure him out.”

Zuoqiu Yang suddenly saw the light. This disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect, surnamed Li, was truly sharp-witted. Why hadn't he thought of this method?

“Restoring the fame of the Qunyu Peak will happen right now.”

“If you run into a fight you can't win, call me,” Shang Wu said. She felt that her disciple's intelligence was not inferior to her own, so she was too lazy to think. He would do the thinking, and she would provide the force when necessary. Perfect.

“Wait, how do we distinguish who is participating in the Interrogation Trial?” Xiao Qin found a flaw in the plan.

“We'll reopen this post station. I'll have my own way then,” Li Mo said while looking at a map.

This was the closest post station to entering Ziyang Prefecture City. In other words, most people entering the city would pass through here. At that time, he just needed to use his Eyes of Fate to take a look...

Zuoqiu Yang and Xiao Qin were both curious. But since Li Mo said so, he probably had his own method. So they didn't doubt him and began cleaning up the scene.

Li Mo snapped his fingers, releasing his internal energy. Instantly, the corpses on the ground burned into white ash.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, seemingly disliking the ash flying everywhere. She turned her hand over, and clouds and mist surged, gathering the ash together and scattering it in the back courtyard's flower bed, contributing to nature.

“The internal energy of these two...”

Zuoqiu Yang's pupils trembled. He had thought himself outstanding among his peers, rarely having a match in the same realm. But the mere act of projecting their internal energy made the young man and girl in front of him terrifying. Was this what a genius of the Clear Abyss Sect was like?

Also...

Why were they so熟练 at destroying evidence?

Well, they even had the boy-girl teamwork thing down.

Xiao Qin was tidying up the tables and chairs when he scratched his head. “Do you guys think we forgot something?”

“No, what could we have forgotten?”

Li Mo looked around. They were burned to ash, what could be missing? Absolutely no oversight.

...

Meanwhile, in the center of Ziyang Prefecture City.

In the main hall of the government office, members of various sects were feasting and drinking.

“By the way, why aren't the people from the Clear Abyss Sect here yet?”

“Seriously, it's their own business at the foot of their mountain, yet they make us worry about it.”

“Well, with Shang Wu leading the team, how reliable can you expect them to be?”

The people from the other sects were all discussing amongst themselves.

“Ah, the peace of Ziyang Prefecture depends entirely on all of you,” Prefecture Governor Cui said, his eyes shifting as he stood up to toast everyone.

“Governor Cui, you flatter us.”

“Upholding justice and righteousness is, after all, our duty as well.”
