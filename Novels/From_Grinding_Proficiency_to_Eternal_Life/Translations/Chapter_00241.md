# Chapter 241: Words as Sharp Weapons

Xu Yunfan appeared affable on the surface, but in reality, he was ruthless and vicious. Though his mouth was full of modest and polite words, his actions were incredibly heavy-handed.

Listening to Qi Huan's tone carrying a hint of displeasure, Pei Yan's heart stirred slightly. He suddenly recalled when they had first left the Tiangong Cave and spoke of the rapidly rising Xu Yunfan, known as the number one of the younger generation in Tiangong Cave. At that time, Qi Huan had also spoken two sentences with an indifferent coldness.

His heart stirred slightly, naturally understanding that the relationship between Xu Yunfan and Qi Huan had an extremely deep rift.

The setting sun elongated Xu Yunfan's hammer-wielding figure. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer tore through the twilight. Under the explosive release of the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, the heavy hammer, carrying the wind of thunder and fire, swept across the rock wall, actually scorching spiderweb-like burn marks into the basalt.

Pei Yan leaned against the shadows of the cave wall, his knuckles unconsciously stroking the somewhat darkened meridians on his wrist. This was the mark of serpent venom erosion. If not for the suppression of a divine weapon and precious armor, he would never have been able to ponder these matters here.

Although Xu Yunfan hadn't shown much, just now when he lifted the heavy hammer to practice martial arts, the hammer hummed with his every move, driving gusts of thunderous airflow. The head of the hammer burst with thunder and fire, making it extremely dangerous.

The other party's strength was not inferior to his own. Perhaps, looking at Xu Yunfan's relaxed and effortless manner, it might even be superior.

Naturally, he did not want to admit this.

"His hammer technique..."

His throat rolled as he swallowed the second half of his exclamation.

As a rare Natural Sword Bone of the Sword Pavilion, he was too familiar with this realm of handling heavy weights with ease.

Eight years ago, when he first held the Divine Weapon Green Bamboo Sword, he too had casually划破 the autumn rain without staining his robes.

But the man before him wielding a four-hundred-jin heavy hammer was even more composed than when Pei Yan twirled his sword.

As the chief disciple of the current generation of the Sword Pavilion, a Natural Sword Bone, he grasped any sword technique at a glance and mastered it upon practice. Though barely twenty years old, aided by the Sword Pavilion's secret medicines, various precious herbs and spiritual pills poured into his body, and the sword qi of the Divine Weapon Green Bamboo Sword washed his meridians day and night. In just eight short years, his muscles, bones, and skin had all reached the Great Perfection realm.

In his life, he had never been inferior to others. Even against experts of the Blood Transformation Realm, he dared to draw his sword and fight.

But the Xu Yunfan before him, only a few years older, had evidently already entered the Blood Transformation Realm.

Just how had he cultivated?

Originally, he thought Xu Yunfan had merely encountered some fortuitous opportunity. But over the next few days, Xu Yunfan practiced martial arts without rest or sleep, to the point that he could be said to have not even slept, only eating.

Watching Xu Yunfan once again lift the heavy hammer to go practice, Pei Yan's expression finally changed. He looked at Qi Huan, who was already accustomed to this.

"What meditation method does he practice every night?"

It could actually replace sleep; it was truly heart-stirring.

Qi Huan shook his head slightly. "I'm not sure. This isn't a method from the Tiangong Cave. The Tiangong Cave... does not have such a meditation practice."

When Xu Yunfan finished his evening meal and prepared to lift the heavy hammer to practice again, Pei Yan stopped him.

"Brother Xu... please wait a moment!"

"Has Senior Brother Pei made a decision?"

The blood energy that Xu Yunfan had just stirred up instantly retracted back into his body. The white mist that had just begun to rise between the armor scales quickly dissipated.

He casually leaned the heavy hammer against a stalactite pillar, shaking the stone stalactites hanging from the cave ceiling, causing dust to fall in rustling layers.

Pei Yan's pupils contracted slightly.

Under Xu Yunfan's explosive strength, the hammer head had already perfectly displayed the power of a treasure artifact. With the surge of strength, the nine spiral lava patterns on the hammer handle lit up one after another, and the scale-like marks on the head...

He subconsciously touched the ice armor on his chest. The serpent venom wandering through his Three Burner meridians immediately sent forth a stinging pain, as if reminding him that his time was running out.

The dust falling from the cave ceiling made Pei Yan frown.

He raised his hand to fan it away and asked, "Does that meditation practice of yours have a name?"

Xu Yunfan instantly understood what Pei Yan wanted. A hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his eye.

"You want me to trade this method for the Void Clearing Sword Washing Technique?"

Pei Yan said, "The Void Clearing Sword Washing Technique is impossible, but I have a method called the Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Technique. Though it cannot compare to the Void Clearing Sword Washing Technique, it is still a top-tier martial art in the Organ Refining Realm. If you can perfect your Organ Refining, you may not be unable to step into the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation."

Xu Yunfan said, "Even if I gave you this method, you wouldn't be able to practice it. If not for a series of coincidences and fortuitous encounters, I wouldn't have been able to master it either... The Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound is good, but I want the Void Clearing Sword Washing Technique more."

Pei Yan said with a hint of disbelief, "With my aptitude, any martial art in the world is clear at a glance and mastered upon practice. Brother Xu, if you don't say it, how can you say I cannot practice it?"

Xu Yunfan smiled slightly but did not argue.

The Lin Character Mantra was of great importance; he naturally would not take it out. Furthermore, this kind of method was obtained through the ability of the Attribute Panel after touching the Extreme Path Remains, equivalent to a direct transmission. Before it was fully mastered, how could it be taught to others?

Before Pei Yan could speak, Xu Yunfan said calmly, "Brother Pei, your time is running out. This small secret realm is likely having problems; otherwise, the six major sects would have opened the exit long ago. How could they have dragged on until now with no news?"

His gaze was profound. "There are many things that only have hope if one is alive. If you die, it will truly be all over. That恶蛟 (Evil Flood Dragon) devoured more than ninety disciples of your Sword Pavilion. Don't you want to avenge them with your own hands?"

For a proud and arrogant person like Pei Yan, if you used torture, he would rather die than utter a single word.

Only by slowly breaking down his psychological defenses can you obtain what you want.

Why did he choose to stay in a mountain area with poor spiritual energy? It was to weaken the other party's ability to resist the serpent venom.

With the reputation of a Sword Pavilion Walker, he definitely had ways to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, but Xu Yunfan could confidently say that the other party absolutely could not detect the gathering points of spiritual energy.

Each of Xu Yunfan's words stabbed into his heart like a knife, making his face turn deathly pale.

At the time, he had been full of pride and ambition. When he discovered the seriously injured evil flood dragon, he led ninety-six Sword Pavilion disciples to form a sword array, intending to kill it, only to realize his idea was terribly wrong.

If not for the desperate fight of the more than ninety Sword Pavilion disciples, he would have had no way to survive.

During the final attack on the evil flood dragon, he had already been prepared to die, but was saved by Xu Yunfan and Qi Huan, who had arrived.

The bonfire cast flickering shadows in Pei Yan's eyes. Looking at the silent Pei Yan, Xu Yunfan spoke again.

"The ninety-odd heroic souls of the Sword Pavilion are still wailing in the dragon's belly. Brother Pei, are you truly willing to lie here in eternal sleep?"

*Crack!*

Pei Yan's knuckles cracked as he clenched them. Veins bulged on his neck and forehead, his expression turning somewhat ferocious.

His Adam's apple rolled with difficulty. In his daze, he saw the final scenes of his fellow disciples turning into blood mist again. The more than ninety disciples sacrificed themselves, desperately blocking the death radius of the dragon's tail sweep to protect his safety, creating an attack opportunity for him.

But he had exhausted everything, even burning his secret martial arts to boil his blood energy,挥洒 (wielding) the divine might of the Green Bamboo Sword to a great extent, yet it was still futile. He even had his left arm shattered in the process.

Pei Yan's emotions surged rapidly, and he suddenly began to cough violently.

"Those children... before we set out, they all bowed to me in the Ancestral Master Hall, calling me Senior Brother."

(Updating one chapter for now; I'm still writing the other one. I had some matters to attend to today and arrived late, my apologies.)
