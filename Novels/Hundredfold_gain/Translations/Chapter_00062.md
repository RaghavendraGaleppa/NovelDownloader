# Chapter 62: Deeper Debts and Misunderstandings  

"What is this?" Qi Chan'er instinctively accepted the copied manual of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique, her fair face showing a hint of confusion as she flipped through it with her delicate fingers.  

"It's a body refinement technique—the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body. I obtained it during a recent mission. It should be quite useful," Qi Chuan explained casually, offering a convenient excuse. "Since we both come from the Qi Family and are now inner disciples, it's only right that we help each other. I thought this body refinement technique might benefit you, so I copied it for you."  

The reasoning was flimsy at best.  

However, given that his collaboration with Qi Chan'er in the Cloudrise Mountains had allowed him to obtain both the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body technique and a talisman treasure—where he had already gained a significant advantage—Qi Chuan felt it was only fair to share the body refinement technique with her. Otherwise, his conscience wouldn’t be at ease.  

Better to give it to her sooner rather than later. Even if the excuse was weak, delaying it wouldn’t make it any more convincing.  

"A body refinement technique? I can't accept this." Hearing this, Qi Chan'er paused in flipping through the manual before shaking her head vigorously, as if she were a rattle drum, and attempted to return it.  

Body refinement techniques were undeniably valuable.  

She already felt that the debt she owed Qi Chuan for saving her life in the Cloudrise Mountains hadn’t been fully repaid. She intended to repay him more in the future to ensure her life didn’t seem too cheap. How could she possibly accept such a precious gift without reason? Wouldn’t that only deepen her debt?  

"This body refinement technique might slightly increase your chances of successful Foundation Establishment," Qi Chuan added at this moment.  

"W-what? It can improve Foundation Establishment odds?" At these words, Qi Chan'er's movement to return the manual halted momentarily as her bright eyes fixed on Qi Chuan’s refined features.  

"Exactly. The three major hurdles of Foundation Establishment—spiritual energy, physical body, and soul—are all crucial. Strengthening your body and cultivating abundant vital energy through this technique will undoubtedly aid in your breakthrough. You should know this," Qi Chuan explained.  

"That does make sense..." Qi Chan'er nodded hesitantly.  

As the granddaughter of the Qi Family’s technique-transmitting elder and now an outer disciple of the Moonbreeze Sect, she was naturally aware of the three major hurdles of Foundation Establishment. However, when Qi Chuan first presented the body refinement technique, she hadn’t immediately connected it to this. Only after his reminder did she recall the significance.  

"Exactly. So, just keep the manual. If you feel uneasy, you can always repay me with something else once your cultivation advances."  

Having said this, Qi Chuan waved his hand dismissively. "I only came here for this matter. Now that it's settled, I’ll take my leave."  

"Wait—this body refinement technique—" Watching Qi Chuan act as if nothing had happened, Qi Chan'er was momentarily stunned, her mind still processing the situation. Yet, her fingers twitched slightly as she still intended to return the manual.  

"Oh, one more thing. This body refinement technique is somewhat special. It consumes a tremendous amount of spirit stones, especially in the second and third layers. The resource expenditure becomes even more staggering. I’d advise against practicing beyond the first layer. Mastering just the first layer is sufficient."  

Suddenly remembering something, Qi Chuan turned back to add, "Even the first layer alone will harden your skin to the level of a low-grade magical artifact and significantly enhance your vital energy, which will help with Foundation Establishment. There’s no need to push further—doing so might hinder your spiritual energy cultivation."  

"Alright, that’s all. Farewell!"  

With those final words, Qi Chuan had already stepped out of the small pavilion, closing the door behind him to prevent Qi Chan'er from returning the manual.  

Then, with a faint shimmer of crystalline light beneath his feet, his figure flickered and vanished down the mountain in mere moments.  

Standing alone in the pavilion, holding the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body manual, Qi Chan'er stared blankly at the closed door. After a few breaths, she snapped out of her daze and hurriedly opened the door to chase after him.  

"Qi Chuan! I still think this technique—Huh? Where is he?"  

Outside the pavilion, Qi Chuan was nowhere to be seen. Only when she gazed into the distance did she spot a rapidly disappearing figure at the foot of the mountain.  

"Was that Qi Chuan? How is he so fast? Did he use a speed-enhancing talisman, or...?" Her lips parted slightly in astonishment.  

"But this body refinement technique..."  

Looking down at the manual in her hand, Qi Chan'er pressed her fingers to her smooth forehead and fell into silence. She hadn’t expected that a moment’s hesitation would cost her the chance to return it.  

"Never mind. The debt from him saving my life hasn’t been fully repaid anyway. What’s one more favor? A body refinement technique can’t possibly outweigh a life." She shook her head with a faint, bitter smile.  

"As Qi Chuan said, once my cultivation advances, I can always repay him in full later."  

Qi Chan'er had no doubt that she would soon advance beyond the outer sect. She had every intention of entering the inner sect—perhaps even aiming for a core disciple position or a Foundation Establishment Pill. That was why she had been taking on missions so diligently.  

Her unwavering determination fueled her confidence that she could repay Qi Chuan for everything.  

"But why would Qi Chuan come all the way to the outer sect to deliver this technique to me as soon as he obtained it? And then run off before I could refuse?"  

"His excuse about us both being from the Qi Family helping each other seems too forced. This is a body refinement technique—not some trivial item..."  

"Could it be...?"  

Staring in the direction Qi Chuan had disappeared, Qi Chan'er murmured to herself before a startling thought struck her. Though they were both from the Qi Family, they weren’t related by blood.  

In the world of cultivation, wealth, companions, techniques, and territory were essential. And among companions... a Dao partner...  

"No, no, no! I must be overthinking this. It’s probably just as Qi Chuan said—he has a strong sense of familial duty." She shook her head vigorously, dispelling the wild thoughts.  

Returning to the pavilion, she muttered to herself, "Let’s see what this Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body is about... According to Qi Chuan, I should avoid the second and third layers and focus only on the first?"  

---  

Meanwhile, Qi Chuan had already returned to the inner sect.  

With a sigh of relief, he felt a weight lift from his mind. Delivering the technique had settled one matter, clearing his thoughts. As for how Qi Chan'er would interpret it—that was beyond his control. He’d deal with the consequences later.  

"First, I’ll stop by the Alchemy Pavilion to purchase some herbs to refine the second layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body and replenish my stock of Gathering Essence Pills..."  

With this in mind, he headed toward the Alchemy Pavilion.  

He had already reached the second layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body—the Crystalline Bone Realm.  

However, he had only just stepped into it. His physical body was currently comparable to an average mid-grade magical artifact.  

Only by refining the Crystalline Bone Realm to its peak could his body rival the finest mid-grade artifacts. And only then would he be ready to cultivate the third layer.  

The power of the third layer went without saying—it would grant him a physique at least on par with high-grade artifacts, if not the finest top-grade ones!
