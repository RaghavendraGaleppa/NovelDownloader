# Chapter 97: Spring Water Quenching Body

What made Chu Ning frown slightly was whether it was due to the immense consumption from two consecutive battles, or if these people were truly that poor. Chu Ning barely found anything on Old Liu and the effeminate young man. He didn't even bother with a few low-tier talismans; their quality was worse than what he could casually draw. The only things of some use were over twenty low-grade spirit stones and Old Liu's iron hammer, which looked like a mid-grade magic tool. The effeminate young man's spiked weapon, however, was only a low-grade magic tool. This greatly reduced Chu Ning's interest in searching the yellow-faced man.

He then approached Old Sun's corpse. Earlier, Old Sun had managed to block the attacks of three people by himself, clearly using some good items. Besides some talismans, there was a black shield and a small golden knife beside Old Sun's body. Chu Ning had seen Old Sun use both of these earlier; they seemed to be decent magic tools. Unfortunately, they had been damaged under the siege of the three. Chu Ning shook his head, then began to retrieve Old Sun's storage bag. Putting aside other things, if he wasn't mistaken, the Bloodglow Grass should be in Old Sun's possession.

Chu Ning took out Old Sun's storage bag, erased the imprints on it, and then opened it, taking out everything inside. What first caught Chu Ning's eye were several jade boxes. He opened the jade boxes almost without thinking, and his eyes immediately filled with joy. As expected, these jade boxes contained Bloodglow Grass. Chu Ning quickly counted them; there were eighteen stalks in total. Moreover, all eighteen stalks of Bloodglow Grass were over a foot long, with broad leaves and a vibrant, blood-red color. Clearly, they were all very mature.

After carefully putting away the Bloodglow Grass, Chu Ning began to examine the other items. To his surprise, there wasn't much inside Old Sun's storage bag. Chu Ning had observed Old Sun fighting the few men earlier; despite his lower cultivation, he had lasted for a long time. He had assumed Old Sun would have more valuable items in his storage bag. What puzzled him was that there were only two mid-grade low-tier escape talismans, with no offensive or defensive talismans remaining. There were no other magic tools or items, and even spirit stones numbered only a dozen or so. Chu Ning blinked, slightly taken aback. Logically, Old Sun owned a shop in Qinghe Market; it was unlikely he only had this much wealth. Immediately, Chu Ning thought of another possibility.

Perhaps Old Sun was merely the manager for a cultivation family there, and the items in the shop weren't entirely his own. "According to what Du Han told me previously, there's a Sun family in this vicinity, affiliated with the Azure Stream Sect, and many spirit fields belong to them. Could this Old Sun be the manager of that Sun family in Qinghe Market?" Thinking this way, it made sense. "No, that's not right either. Even when he sold those Seven-Star Spirit Fruits earlier, his income was more than this. Could it be that he spent all those spirit stones in about a year?"

With no one to answer his speculation, Chu Ning decided not to dwell on it further. After putting away the spirit stones, Chu Ning's gaze fell upon the last item: a jade token that seemed to be of good quality. Chu Ning picked it up, noticing that the jade token seemed to bear some kind of restriction, and carved upon it were two large characters: "Cloud Sea." Feeling the slightly familiar restriction and seeing these two characters, Chu Ning almost immediately thought of Cloud Sea Pavilion.

"A Cloud Sea Pavilion jade token, what's this for?" Chu Ning rubbed the jade token, his expression a mix of doubt and contemplation. Could it be that Old Sun had also joined Cloud Sea Pavilion? If so, it might cause some trouble. But then, Chu Ning shook his head again. "Not necessarily. Even if Old Sun really sold a few Seven-Star Spirit Fruits to Cloud Sea Pavilion, it wouldn't be enough for him to join them. This token might have another purpose." Thinking this, Chu Ning simply tossed the jade token into his storage bag.

Standing up, Chu Ning then walked towards the yellow-faced man. He checked the body and indeed found a storage bag, but as Chu Ning expected, there was nothing particularly valuable inside. However, the short spear he had just dropped was still intact. Chu Ning picked it up and saw that it was also a mid-grade magic tool. After searching everyone, Chu Ning cast several fireballs in succession, completely incinerating the bodies.

Just as Chu Ning was about to walk towards the Earth Spirit Spring, his gaze shifted. He looked at the ground behind where the yellow-faced man had been, and there, a pitch-black small knife was stuck in the earth. Chu Ning remembered clearly that before Old Sun died, he had unleashed a dark light that directly pierced through the yellow-faced man's body. If not for that, killing the three later would have been quite tricky. Chu Ning walked up to the pitch-black small knife, gently picked it up, and after a brief examination. "Judging by the power this magic tool displayed just now, its grade is clearly very high. It even seems to be higher than my Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield. Is this a high-grade magic tool? Or perhaps a top-grade one?"

Chu Ning held the pitch-black small knife, his face filled with uncertainty. However, when Chu Ning picked it up and tried to infuse it with spiritual power, he found no reaction whatsoever. Although the knife had seemed to be of a high grade earlier, it was completely devoid of spirituality now; it seemed unusable. "Could it be a one-time use item? Is that why Old Sun didn't bring it out earlier?" Chu Ning mused inwardly. He tried continuously sending spiritual power, but it simply wouldn't enter the small knife. After several attempts, he had to give up. Unable to figure out the situation, he simply put the pitch-black small knife into his storage bag as well. He could only hope for a chance to figure it out later.

After all this was done, Chu Ning finally arrived at the Earth Spirit Spring. "According to the jade slip's description of the Earth Spirit Spring, this substance, when combined with Bloodglow Grass, is one of the excellent treasures for body tempering. Its benefit lies in a comprehensive improvement of the physique. Although each session's effect isn't extremely dramatic, the tempering process is quite gentle. It's best if it can be used for long periods of immersion." Chu Ning began to recall the information he had read about the Earth Spirit Spring. If, as mentioned in the jade slip, it's best to use one stalk of Bloodglow Grass per day for continuous body tempering.

"In that case, would I need to come here for over ten consecutive days?" Chu Ning murmured softly. After all, the Earth Spirit Spring water couldn't be transferred; once taken out, it would immediately lose its spiritual efficacy. However, he immediately felt that it might not be impossible. Judging by the conversation of the few people earlier, this place was extremely secret, and only two people knew about it. One was Old Sun, and the other was Old Liu San, who had died by his hand earlier. And now, Old Sun was dead, and Old Liu and his two companions, who were with Old Liu San, were also dead. The few of them seemed to be rogue cultivators; judging by their words, they had been tracking Old Sun for nearly a year and likely operated together. Based on this deduction, they shouldn't have any other accomplices. After mentally sorting through the situation, Chu Ning largely concluded that staying in this cave carried little risk.

He immediately took out a stalk of Bloodglow Grass from the jade box. After some thought, Chu Ning said to Little Spirit White: "Little White, go outside the cave and help keep watch. If anyone comes, tell me immediately." Little Spirit White, who had been curiously watching Chu Ning destroy the bodies, didn't immediately act upon hearing this. "Ying!" Instead, it chirped at Chu Ning. "Want to eat!" Hearing Little Spirit White's words, Chu Ning laughed and scolded: "You little rascal, always looking for a benefit."

While saying this, Chu Ning didn't hesitate, directly throwing the Bloodglow Grass in his hand to Little Spirit White. "Ying!" Little Spirit White let out a joyful cry and swiftly ate the Bloodglow Grass. Then it scampered off towards the cave entrance. At this moment, Chu Ning took another stalk of Bloodglow Grass from the jade box and tossed it into the Earth Spirit Spring. Miraculously, after the Bloodglow Grass was thrown in, the calm, ripple-less pool began to gently churn, simultaneously emitting wisps of heat. In just a few breaths, the Bloodglow Grass completely disappeared, melting directly into the Earth Spirit Spring water. And the spring water, which was originally crystal clear, now turned a fiery crimson, like fresh blood.

Chu Ning reached out and gently touched the Earth Spirit Spring water; it was warm, but not scalding. He immediately shed his clothes without hesitation and jumped directly into the crimson Earth Spirit Spring. As his body was immersed in the blood-red Earth Spirit Spring water, Chu Ning immediately felt an incredibly comfortable warmth. It was as if the warm Earth Spirit Spring water was directly penetrating his body.

"Comfortable!" Chu Ning couldn't help but let out a sigh of contentment. Even if it didn't temper his body, simply experiencing this unique kind of hot spring bath was enjoyable enough. After a brief moment of appreciation, Chu Ning began to carefully observe and sense. Under his keen perception, he could detect wisps of spiritual energy seeping into his body through his skin. The speed wasn't fast, but it was genuinely happening. Meanwhile, the blood-red Earth Spirit Spring water was, in this process, gradually fading in color at an extremely subtle rate. At the same time, the temperature of the Earth Spirit Spring water was slowly dropping. And Chu Ning's body temperature was slowly rising.

About an hour passed like this. The Earth Spirit Spring water's color fully returned to normal, without a trace of red. Chu Ning, on the other hand, felt a burning sensation in his body. He immediately leaped out of the Earth Spirit Spring and began cultivating the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art. After cultivating for a while, Chu Ning stopped only when the burning sensation in his body completely disappeared. Then, Chu Ning immediately checked the cultivation proficiency in his mind.

[Azurewood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (2/2100)]
[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Undying Bones 254/600]
[Spirit Refining Technique, First Layer 331/1000]

The Azurewood Eternal Spring Art and Spirit Refining Technique showed no change, but the proficiency of Undying Bones had increased by a full 3 points.
