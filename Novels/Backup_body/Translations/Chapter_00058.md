# Chapter 58: Immortal! Immortal!

**Name:** Gu Xuan  
**Age:** None  
**Cultivation:** None  
**Fortune:** None  
**Note:** The target's cultivation far surpasses your own. Information retrieval failed!  

**Insufficient spiritual energy! Please exhaust all your internal qi and supplement with seventy-two spirit stones!**  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing bowed deeply, his head lowered, his expression unreadable.  

Yet within his heart, a storm raged.  

It was him!  

It had to be him!  

Even after consuming ten graded spirit stones, it still wasn’t enough to reveal detailed information about this person!  

He would still need to expend all his internal qi and supplement it with seventy-two more spirit stones!  

Just to uncover the secrets of this Elder Gu, the golden page required the vast spiritual energy equivalent to over a hundred spirit stones?  

Previously, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official had only needed twelve additional spirit stones!  

Yuan Zhengfeng, who existed between life and death, had only required three graded spirit stones!  

How could this Elder Gu, who only appeared to be at the True Qi realm as an inner sect elder, be so unfathomably deep?  

Just how high was this Elder Gu’s true cultivation level?  

Beyond the peak of True Qi—  

The Immortal Realm!  

Yet such a figure had been poisoned by the Venom King Xin Xuan in the capital and remained bedridden to this day?  

"Xin Xuan’s abilities are nothing remarkable to us, but he is still at the True Qi realm."  

"Moreover, his Divine King Gu is indeed formidable. Coupled with the numerous gu insects he refined and those offered by the seventeen tribes of the Southern Wasteland, he could act with impunity."  

Elder Gu spoke slowly, his voice low. "You’ve only just entered the Internal Qi realm a little over a month ago. By what means did you kill him?"  

Li Zhengjing fell silent for a moment. Only when the golden page returned to its original state, displaying his own information again, did he focus on the "Fortune" column.  

Then he replied, "When the Venom King Xin Xuan attacked me with his gu insects, I felt as if I had fallen into an icy abyss. But in an instant, the cold dissipated."  

Elder Gu’s eyes narrowed slightly. "His gu poison had no effect on you?"  

Li Zhengjing nodded. "None."  

Elder Gu exhaled softly. "A constitution impervious to all evils?"  

He paused before continuing, "But even without his gu insects, Xin Xuan was still at the True Qi realm."  

Just as Li Zhengjing was about to respond, Elder Gu spoke again.  

"Enough."  

The elderly man on the sickbed waved his hand weakly. "The Sect Master did not interrogate you. The First Seat of the Ancient Moon Peak did not interrogate you. Neither shall I."  

"But there’s one more thing. Xin Xuan escaped using the Star-Shifting Formation. Even he didn’t know where the formation would transport him. How did you know his landing spot?"  

"Can you enlighten me on this?"  

His gaze fixed on Li Zhengjing, his sickly appearance making him seem on the verge of death.  

For a moment, Li Zhengjing felt a pang of sympathy. Seeing the man so close to death, he couldn’t bear to leave him with unanswered questions.  

So he replied, "I just happened to run into him on the road."  

Elder Gu’s face stiffened.  

The atmosphere turned awkward.  

After a long pause, a hoarse chuckle broke the silence.  

"Amusing..."  

Elder Gu laughed softly and waved his hand. "I won’t press you further. You may leave."  

With that, he turned and lay flat on the bed, adding, "Oh, the protective mirror on the table is a token of gratitude. You killed Xin Xuan, avenged me, restored the sect’s honor, and upheld the dignity of the Central Continent. A small gift—don’t disdain it."  

Li Zhengjing took the mirror, bowed, and departed.  

After he left, Elder Gu slowly raised his hand.  

Moonlight streamed through the window like a veil, settling upon his palm.  

After a long while, he clenched his fist, as if grasping the moonlight itself.  

"So it truly is the Evergreen Sacred Body..."  

His whisper carried an indescribable complexity.  

---  

Moonlight bathed the Ancient Moon Peak.  

At its summit, atop a boulder, the current First Seat of the Ancient Moon Peak sat cross-legged. The moonlight enveloped him, enhancing his ethereal aura.  

Before him, a low table held two cups of steaming tea.  

But the seat opposite him was empty.  

Only half of the tea in the opposite cup had been consumed.  

The drinker had left, yet the tea remained warm.  

After some time, a figure approached and bowed. "A message from the main peak—the Sect Master requests your presence for discussions."  

"Understood."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master stood, about to leave, but paused. His gaze lingered on the half-drunk cup of tea.  

After a moment of silence, he murmured, "After his trip to the capital, it seems he has lost much..."  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master hesitated. "Lost what?"  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master remained silent for a beat before replying, "Perhaps his magic power... or perhaps more than just that."  

His gaze shifted to the Law Enforcement Hall Master, his tone grave. "Since returning from the capital, he has weakened."  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master frowned. "Yet from my perspective, he seems stronger."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master replied coolly, "How so?"  

"Your subordinate is at the peak of the True Qi realm, with a perfected Heavenly Cycle. In the past, when I saw him, I felt slightly inferior, but in a life-or-death struggle, I still had a fifty percent chance of victory."  

"But just now, when I saw him, I could sense his aura was overwhelmingly powerful, far surpassing mine."  

"If we were to fight now, I wouldn’t stand a chance."  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master said solemnly, "Perhaps his injuries have healed somewhat, making him stronger than before."  

"No."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master shook his head slowly. "In the past, when you saw him, you felt you had a fifty percent chance of victory. But did you know that when I saw him, I also felt I had a fifty percent chance?"  

"What?!"  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master felt as if struck by lightning, his mouth suddenly dry.  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master said calmly, "Before he went to the capital, anyone who saw him felt they had a fifty percent chance of victory against him."  

"In other words, before his trip to the capital, he was truly unfathomable."  

"Now, you can sense that he is stronger than you."  

"And I can sense that he is slightly weaker than me."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master’s voice deepened. "Though he remains immensely powerful, he no longer feels unfathomable. At the very least... I no longer find him unfathomable."  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master hesitated before asking, "What exactly happened to him?"  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master clasped his hands behind his back and gazed at the moon in the sky.  

"This matter is of great importance. Investigate it personally for me."  

"Find out everything he did in the capital—every place he visited, every action he took. Leave no detail unexamined."  

"Before I leave the mountain, I want answers."  

His gaze returned to the Law Enforcement Hall Master. "You have seven days to give me a satisfactory report."  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master felt a headache coming on but had no choice but to comply. Yet, from these words, he sensed something more.  

"Seven days from now, you’ll be leaving the mountain?"  

"The Sect Master has summoned me to the main peak for discussions, undoubtedly regarding the Ghost Valley Spirit Official. This matter is of great significance, and someone must descend the mountain to handle it."  

"But you oversee the Ancient Moon Peak’s grand hall. If you leave, who knows what that 'Creditor' might do?" the Law Enforcement Hall Master said quietly.  

"He is no longer as unfathomable as before."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master continued, "Moreover, the Ancient Moon Peak currently has more than just me guarding it. After I descend the mountain, someone else will take my place."  

"There’s one more thing. This journey is long, and we’ll need thirty-six inner sect disciples to operate the Heavenly Cloud Vessel."  

"Focus on investigating the 'Creditor’s' activities in the capital."  

"As for selecting the disciples..."  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master pointed toward Elder Gu’s courtyard at the foot of the mountain.  

"Let him compile the list."
