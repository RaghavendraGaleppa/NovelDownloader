# Chapter 62: Turmoil

The entire mansion was as bright as day. Though it was the season of falling snow, it was warm as spring and summer here, with vibrant flowers in the garden plots and lush green plants in the courtyards.

In the spacious hall, the stern middle-aged man did not speak immediately. The brief silence made Cui Hong, who stood with his hands at his sides, feel as if he were facing a towering mountain.

“Give him more Daygold, enough for him to live a life of comfort and abundance there.”

Cui Hong, a man with remarkably long arms, immediately nodded in assent, but then cautiously inquired again, “If he has already undergone rebirth, does he need…”

The middle-aged man spoke, “The cultivation method on the silk scroll cannot be mastered.”

“If he has abandoned the silk scroll, and in that remote and barren region, has changed to another method for survival, embarking on a new path of rebirth…” Cui Hong cautiously probed.

The middle-aged man rose and stood before a thick pillar inscribed with cloud patterns, looking out at the garden adorned with pavilions and towers, where every step revealed a new scene. He said, “Let him live a good life as an ordinary person, take root there completely. Wealth, peace—that is enough.”

Although Cui Hong nodded, he felt quite troubled. This matter was easy to handle now, but who knew if trouble might arise for him in the future?

Before leaving, he said, “If he is no longer alive, if he didn’t make it through, I will ensure he is properly buried.”

The stern middle-aged man hummed in acknowledgment, signaling that he could leave.

The annihilation of Jinjiling swept through the region like a hurricane. Naturally, the villages outside the great mountains erupted in cheers.

The powers rooted in this area, such as certain merchant guilds and mountain patrol teams, were shocked and stunned, and even the monstrous beasts in the mountains were alarmed.

“The scene was horrific. I went to see it; wild beasts were fighting over the remains. Not even a complete bone was left.”

“Jinjiling was so righteous! The last time they collected protection fees, they said it was to keep us safe, fighting monsters in the Great Rift Valley, almost completely wiped out. I didn’t believe it then, but now I’m convinced. They truly did what they said, they were completely wiped out, feeding the mutated creatures!”

Someone scoffed, indicating how unpopular Jinjiling was. Upon hearing of their demise, it was not quite universal cheering, but close.

“Which great hero did this? Please accept my bow!” someone exclaimed excitedly.

Many knew that Jinjiling’s two Grand Bandits were Four-times Rebirth cultivators, and a select few with insider knowledge were aware that there was also a five-times mutated old Golden Rooster there, making them one of the strongest forces in the area.

Yet, they were wiped out overnight.

Some merchant guilds dispatched people, and a few experienced mountain rangers accompanied them.

“There are knife marks, spear wounds, and arrow holes on the remaining bones left by the gorged monsters, meaning it must have been three powerful cultivators acting together to flatten Jinjiling,” someone analyzed seriously.

A mountain ranger spoke, “The one wielding the saber must be a master; the cut bones show no cracks whatsoever, their cross-sections are as smooth as a mirror. The person using the spear is also extraordinary; the force of each thrust is identical, and the spear holes in the bones look meticulously crafted. The archer’s strength should be the weakest of the three. Although their accuracy is terrifyingly precise, killing more than half of the mountain bandits alone, their arm strength is less than two thousand jin.”

Qin Ming was speechless when he heard these comments.

Upon learning of the incident, some larger organizations also began to pay attention.

This was because Jinjiling had the Golden Bandits behind them, whose activities spanned a vast territory, not limited to the area radiated by Red Cloud City.

Now, someone had shown no respect, directly eradicating one of their strongholds.

Subsequently, some hidden details were uncovered: the Jinjiling people were not entirely wiped out; two survivors had been out that night and escaped the calamity.

Those two had gone to seek refuge with the Golden Bandits, but before leaving, they spread a message.

“Our leader died a horrible death. When we returned to the stronghold, we heard their shouts from afar, mentioning the City Lord and the Mountain Guardians of the Transcendents.”

At this point, it seemed this public case began to surface, and many had their own conjectures.

Then, news came from the monster side: that night, Meng Xinghai, the new City Lord of Red Cloud City, had passed through the area and met the old Mountain Lord.

Afterward, people in Green Pine Town also claimed to have seen a Transcendent with two golden-armored Mountain Guardians staying at an inn that night.

“This new City Lord is very forceful. We’ll need to be careful when dealing with him from now on.”

“Transcendents have also gotten involved? Hmm, there’s news that Meng Xinghai once walked with a woman in feather robes. It seems it must be them.”

Some organizations pondered the matter. They didn't care about Jinjiling’s fate, but rather were trying to understand what kind of person the new City Lord Meng Xinghai was.

Li Qingyue was also paying attention, wanting to know the cause of Cui Chongxuan’s actions and the resulting consequences. She never imagined that the "melon" (gossip/trouble) would fall on her head.

She was an eyewitness and knew who committed the act, yet she was directly given an undeserved accusation.

The most crucial thing was that even Meng Xinghai was dragged into it and blamed, leading various parties to believe that the new City Lord was incredibly strong and difficult to get along with, and that he might make a move against the Golden Bandits as part of his "three fires" upon taking office.

“Uncle Meng, I’m truly sorry. You helped me seek the Yin-Yang Grand Medicine from Black White Mountain, but it led to you being misunderstood…” Li Qingyue showed her apologies.

Wiping out Jinjiling was a small matter; they indeed deserved to die. But causing various parties to misjudge Meng Xinghai’s character and his next moves could have a significant impact.

Meng Xinghai, dressed in green robes, looked to be about thirty-seven or thirty-eight. Though he appeared scholarly, his words were strong. He shook his head and said, “It’s fine. City Lord Lingxu and I correspond by letter and have exchanged ideas. Originally, he wanted to lure the Golden Bandits out at Jinjiling to hunt them down. I also want to do this, so I’m not afraid of any misjudgment from various parties.”

He then added, “What I got from the Mountain Lord was a branch of the Black White Tree. Lingxu still has the root. I’ll help you get a portion later.”

“Thank you, Uncle Meng.”

“Why be polite with me? Actually, for matters like this, your family or your master could solve it with a single word.”

Li Qingyue shook her head and said, “The Yin-Yang Grand Medicine is extremely important to Transcendents. Now, more than one powerful sect is coveting it, either writing letters to request it or sending people over. If we are even a step late, we might fall behind others and make a wasted trip.”

Meng Xinghai said, “Your path is enviable, truly brilliant, difficult for other paths to compare. In a few years, you might even catch up to me.”

***

The destruction of Jinjiling brought about various impacts, with different reactions from large organizations to local forces.

For example, the Three-Eyed Cult, uncharacteristically, sent people to various villages to ask if there were any monsters rampaging nearby, offering to help eradicate them with an incredibly good attitude.

They even sent food to the most difficult villages for relief.

Everyone’s first reaction was that the Three-Eyed Cult had gone mad. Not only were they not exploiting people, but they were actually providing relief in return?

Soon, people realized that the local high-ranking members of the Three-Eyed Cult had cowered, fearing they would follow Jinjiling’s fate and be annihilated. Now they wanted to earn a good reputation to protect themselves.

“Let me tell you, the hero who flattened Jinjiling that day was someone else. He rode a Purple Lightning Beast, holding a Heaven-rending Spear. He was truly heroic and single-handedly wiped out that group of mountain bandits, beheading the old Golden Rooster. He even came to our Green Pine Town once, scaring all the members of the Three-Eyed Cult into fleeing overnight.”

Finally, someone revealed a very reliable piece of news, but it was difficult to dig deeper, as all clues had long since vanished.

Some tried to contact the monster side. When they heard they wanted to inquire about the Purple Lightning Beast, some mountain monsters immediately turned hostile, not wanting to get involved at all.

People realized that the Purple Lightning Beast had a great origin.

“It infuriates me! This rotten business is never-ending, is it? Is it going to become a black mark in my history?” In the great mountain, the Purple Lightning Beast bristled, once again summoning the white owl, asking if there were any clues about that outsider. If not, to quickly send more people.

The owl said, “Black White Mountain is not our home turf after all. Investigations will still take time.”

Qin Ming had been practicing Yellow Earth Palm, not just having made initial progress, but having reached a certain level of proficiency. When the soft strength circulated and Skyglow Qi erupted, it was exceptionally terrifying.

He found a wild ox to test it. With a light pat of his right hand, the flesh, internal organs, and bones beneath its tough hide were rapidly destroyed, all pulverized.

“Not suitable for sparring; any strike would cause death or injury,” Qin Ming mused.

What he most anticipated was the Yellow Earth Palm after fusing with Earth Essence Qi; that was the ultimate technique he truly wanted to master.

Before leaving, Qin Ming still wanted to find one or two more ancient books. He asked Old Man Liu to help him look around. There was indeed one more fallen family, but their asking price was too exorbitant. Knowing that the Wu family had received fifteen Daygold, they immediately demanded fifty Daygold.

“Old man, could you inquire what kind of Skyglow Qi their family cultivates?”

Old Man Liu said, “No need to inquire, everyone knows it’s the Nail Qi. It is indeed very powerful, but their asking price is too black.”

“Even if they dropped the price to one Daygold, I wouldn’t look at it!” Qin Ming declared.

He felt a little emotional. This remote region indeed had limited secret manuals; only a few were circulating. The so-called Nail Qi, he had already mastered long ago. It was precisely the same Qi method that the bearded man, who wrote "I regret not being able to cultivate Rulai Qi" in the saber manual, had painstakingly sought out.

Two days later, Qin Ming prepared to travel afar, not wanting to alarm too many people. Before leaving, he came to the neighboring courtyard.

After eating the fire snake meat, Lu Ze’s injuries healed incredibly fast, and he also underwent his first rebirth.

Qin Ming told him that in his own cellar, he had another two-times mutated fire snake frozen for him, reminding him to eat it before spring bloomed. If his potential wasn’t too bad, he might undergo a second rebirth.

Qin Ming had brought back two large snakes and six small snakes in total. He hadn't even finished one large snake himself, and he had even shared part of the meat broth with Old Man Liu to help him recuperate.

Lu Ze and his wife were shocked, instantly realizing who had annihilated the mountain patrol team.

“Little Qin, are you really leaving?!” They were very reluctant.

Qin Ming nodded, “I want to go see the distant world.”

“Uncle, will you come back?” Wen Rui wiped her tears, clinging to him, unwilling to let go.

Two-year-old Wen Hui wasn’t speaking very clearly yet, but he also knew Qin Ming was leaving, looking up and indistinctly calling “Uncle.”

“I will come back,” Qin Ming patted the two children’s heads.

Before parting, he handed some hand-copied cultivation methods to Lu Ze, telling him to practice them well, and that he could teach them to Wen Rui later.

“First master Blending Light with Dust. If you undergo a second rebirth in a very short time, it can help you conceal it.”

Qin Ming did not let them see him off. He carried his sheep-fat jade iron saber and disappeared outside the village at extreme speed.

Old Man Liu waited in the distant snow, specifically to see him off there.

Meanwhile, a massive fierce bird, carrying Cui Hong and a handsomely dressed young man, pierced through the night mist, crossing the vast and boundless land, arriving at the Black White Mountain region. After circling for a large loop, it slowly descended into the snowy ground outside Silver Vine Town.
