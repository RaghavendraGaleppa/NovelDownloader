Chapter 92: Who Smiles Like That and is Still a Good Person?

The not-so-large inn was instantly transformed into a battlefield, with flashes of sword light and dagger shadows.

Zuoqiu Yang's waist dagger was enchanting and dazzling, taking a life with each swift flash.

The sound of clashing blades was like a thousand ants gnawing at one's heart.

"So strong," Xiao Qin thought to himself, feeling a shiver run down his spine. The other party's killing intent was terrifying, and he wasn't sure if he could defeat them in a life-or-death battle.

His teacher had once said that he was a talented individual among his peers, but Xiao Qin always felt that he was just average.

It wasn't until he left Qingyuan Sect and encountered people like Zuoqiu Yang that he realized how mediocre he truly was.

"Indeed, it's the Wusheng Dao technique. He's achieved perfection in it at such a young age," Qianxing Wuzun exclaimed, also surprised by Zuoqiu Yang.

"Do you know his martial arts style?" Xiao Qin asked.

"Of course, if I didn't, how would I have warned you?" Qianxing Wuzun replied.

"Teacher, why didn't you warn me about this inn being off?" Xiao Qin dodged to the side, avoiding the flying daggers and taking cover.

"It's not worth warning you about. These people aren't even considered assassins," Qianxing Wuzun said nonchalantly.

"Besides, they're not here to kill you," he added.

Xiao Qin nodded, understanding that he hadn't received any tasks from the Tangqianyang organization, and there were no innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire.

However, as he deflected a flying dagger, it accidentally hit an unlucky bystander, piercing their chest.

"That big-browed guy, I knew he was in cahoots with Zuoqiu Yang!" someone shouted.

"Kill him!" a group of people cried out, charging towards Xiao Qin with swords and daggers.

Qianxing Wuzun smiled faintly. "Now they are."

Xiao Qin fell silent, forced to join the battle.

Both he and Zuoqiu Yang were geniuses who could fight beyond their境界, and the group of fake assassins didn't even have a single person at the Neixi Yuye境界.

The outcome was predictable.

The impromptu battle soon came to an end, with the inn littered with corpses. Only the fake shopkeeper and chef had escaped, while the rest lay dead.

Zuoqiu Yang sat back down, wiping the blood from his face, and began eating his noodles. Before taking a bite, he transferred all the beef to Xiao Qin's bowl.

"Is this a thank you?" Xiao Qin asked, sitting down and raising an eyebrow.

Zuoqiu Yang swallowed his noodles and shook his head. "No, but I can give you a piece of advice. Leave now while you still can. The ones coming for me next won't be as easy to deal with as these."

"More people are coming?" Xiao Qin's expression turned serious.

He was still waiting for someone, so he couldn't leave.

Seeing Xiao Qin's reluctance to leave, Zuoqiu Yang frowned. "Have you heard of the Huai Shan San Sha?"

"I've heard of Huai Shan Town," Xiao Qin replied, shaking his head. "I passed by there on my way from Mianhe Fu to Ziyang Fu."

Zuoqiu Yang's expression turned grim. "The town is gone, razed to the ground. Three years ago, it was taken over by bandits led by three brothers who claimed to be the Huai Shan San Sha. They're skilled in coordinated attacks."

As he spoke, Zuoqiu Yang clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white.

"Didn't the authorities and sects do anything about it?" Xiao Qin asked, curious.

Xiao Qin hadn't seen any tasks related to Huai Shan San Sha on the external affairs hall's bulletin board.

Zuoqiu Yang sneered. "Huai Shan is located between two prefectures. The Ziyang authorities said it's too close to Mianhe Fu, so it's not their responsibility. Mianhe Fu, on the other hand, said it's separated by a river, and the villagers usually go to Ziyang Fu for help, so it's Ziyang's problem."

"They kept passing the buck, and it's still unclear if they forgot or are still debating who's responsible," Zuoqiu Yang said, glancing at the corpses on the ground. "Unfortunately, the Huai Shan San Sha are just pawns. The ones who killed my master are still out there..."

As if sensing his sorrow and hatred, Zuoqiu Yang's waist dagger began to hum softly.

The killing intent in the room surged again, sending a chill down Xiao Qin's spine.

"Leave, it's for your own good," Zuoqiu Yang's voice was cold and menacing, devoid of humanity.

Xiao Qin felt a shiver run down his spine.

Qianxing Wuzun sighed. "The Wusheng Dao technique is a high-level martial art from the Xiyu Lou sect. It's a technique that kills others and oneself, cutting off emotions and desires."

"Those who cultivate this technique usually meet with a tragic end, either dying at the hands of others or taking their own lives," Qianxing Wuzun continued.

"He's advising you to leave because he's afraid that when he loses control, he'll kill you too," Qianxing Wuzun explained.

Xiao Qin's expression turned speechless.

Zuoqiu Yang stopped talking and began to accumulate his killing intent, building up his momentum.

Just then, three figures burst through the rain curtain, approaching the inn at an alarming speed.

Boom! Two mangled bodies flew into the inn, smashing into a mess of tables and chairs. They were the shopkeeper and chef who had escaped earlier.

Their faces were filled with terror, as if they had seen a ghost.

"Huai Shan San Sha?" Zuoqiu Yang's eyes widened, his expression frozen.

Boom! Boom! More figures crashed into the inn, three people with similar features, each with a sunken chest.

Zuoqiu Yang's expression turned stone-like.

Xiao Qin walked to the entrance, munching on his lips. "Li Shidi, is that you?"

"Sorry, Xiao Shixiong, I'm late," a young man replied, walking into the inn. Despite being drenched from the rain, he looked immaculate, like a young master out for a leisurely stroll.

It was Li Mo.

He glanced at the carnage inside the inn, raised an eyebrow, and rubbed his belly. "Where's the waiter? I could swear I saw him earlier."

"The waiter is... over there," Xiao Qin said, pointing to a corpse on the ground.

Li Mo's eyes widened. "And the shopkeeper?"

"The fat guy you just threw in," Xiao Qin replied.

"So, the one next to him is the chef?" Li Mo asked.

Xiao Qin nodded. "You're quite clever, Li Xiong."

Li Mo looked puzzled. "What's going on here?"

Earlier, Li Mo and his companion, Ying Bing, were traveling in a carriage, heading towards their destination.

"How much longer until we arrive?" Li Mo asked, looking inside the carriage.

Ying Bing took out a map given by Qian Bufan and pointed to a location.

Li Mo frowned, unsure. "It's a bit far. Why did they choose a meeting point so far from the city?"

Ying Bing's finger hesitated, and she pointed to another location.

Li Mo looked up, confused, and saw Ying Bing's uncertain expression.

"Is that not correct?" Ying Bing asked softly.

Li Mo shook his head. "We're not here to visit relatives, are we?"

Ying Bing nodded.

Li Mo sighed. "Then why did you point to your home?"

In the end, Li Mo had to ask for directions from some people on the road, who claimed to know the way.

At first, Li Mo thought they were good people, despite their rough appearance.

However, as soon as they arrived at the inn, they revealed their true nature, their faces twisted with malice.

One of them even cackled maniacally, prompting Li Mo to wonder, "Who smiles like that and is still a good person?"
