# Chapter 91: The Body Manifests a Strange Phenomenon, The Enemy is Extremely Strong

Li Xian had been lying in wait for a long time, but no pursuing soldiers came. Although he did not know the specific situation, he guessed it must be good news.

He immediately returned to the village. On the way, he saw several horses that had been scattered in panic during the earlier battle and were now wandering in the forest. Since horses are valuable, he naturally took them along.

By the afternoon, he reached the village entrance. The people of Black River Village were all there. Seeing Li Xian return, they rushed to surround him and knelt down with a thud.

"What are you doing?" Li Xian frowned.

"We must kowtow to thank you for saving our lives. Please accept our gratitude," Fu Bo said, refusing to get up.

Li Xian said, "I have accepted it. Everyone, get up."

Only then did the villagers rise. Li Xian said, "The matter has been exposed. Starting today, the Mountain Wind Stronghold will come looking for us."

"If you want to live, you must listen to my arrangements."

Fu Bo bowed. "Sir, please arrange as you see fit. Even if you ask for my old life, I will not frown."

Seeing the atmosphere was right, Li Xian accepted the sentiment and began to make detailed arrangements.

First, he had people dig up the weapons they had buried last time. Then, pointing to the three horses behind him, he said, "The village butcher must slaughter the horses overnight and sell the meat at the market."

"The money earned will be used to buy iron nets. If iron nets are unavailable, fishing nets will do. There are many fishermen by the Black Water River, so fishing nets should not be scarce. If there is any money left, buy some iron shields. If there are no shields, use iron pots instead."

"Once these items are ready, I will teach you how to fight the enemy! Even without martial arts skills, you can capture and kill the bandits to avenge the humiliation."

"If we unite as one, as long as we scare the bandits, we can protect ourselves."

"It is far better than being bullied for generations!"

Li Xian's voice was as firm as iron. Despite his youth, he acted with the maturity of an elder. Standing there, he seemed like a pillar holding up the sky, giving the villagers a sense of reliance. It felt as though the storm before them could definitely be weathered.

Fu Bo reminded him, "Sir, live horses are worth more money."

Li Xian shook his head. "Live horses are hard to sell and easily expose us. The risk is too great. Slaughter the horses, cut the meat into pieces, and claim it is donkey meat. This is the fastest way to get money."

He continued his arrangements.

He took out the geographical map, which Fu Bo had drawn. It sketched out the area within a dozen miles of Black River Village. Because children often got lost in the mountain villages, the villagers had to organize searches, and the map had been created for this purpose.

Li Xian held the map and marked several points, designating them as "watchposts" and arranging for people to keep watch day and night. If there was any movement, a shout would alert the entire village.

After finishing these tasks, the atmosphere in the village became fervent.

Li Xian also thought: "In the end, I am no different from them. Helping them is also helping myself."

That night.

Li Xian returned to his small hut and cut open the half of the bear he had left. Back in the village, he had a large pot dug into the ground, people chop trees to make a fire, people cook rice porridge, and people gather seasonings.

A large pot of bear meat steamed hotly.

The entire population of Black River Village, men, women, old and young, gathered before the pot. Li Xian shouted loudly, "Eat the bear feast, bolster your courage!"

"Let's fight the bandits!"

The villagers had survived a life-and-death situation. Past grudges and minor hatreds scattered like clouds. Each person ate a piece of bear meat, a bowl of bear soup, and filled their bellies with porridge...

Under such an atmosphere, a fighting spirit truly condensed.

"Eat the bear feast, bolster your courage!"

"Damn it, I've wanted to fight them for a long time. Luckily, Master Li came to lead us to stand up!"

"A real man dies when he must! It's better than being bullied like this for generations, father to son!"

"Yes, we will follow Master Li's lead!"

"When the time comes, we old ones will go first. Damn it, we'll take one down with us!"

Who says there are no strong men among the villagers?

A pot of bear meat, a bowl of porridge, and they no longer fear the bandits.

That night, regardless of age, everyone stayed awake all night, carrying out the plan.

The butcher at the east village entrance sharpened his knife, slaughtering the horses and cutting the meat. The strong men helped hold the horses and boil water...

The children, being small and nimble, could move through the forest easily. They were arranged to guard the various watchposts and report any movement immediately.

Slightly older youths, who were quick-witted and learned fast, were gathered by Li Xian to learn the essentials of the "Iron Net Catching Demons Formation."

"If I hadn't gone to chase the Immortal in the Jar, how could I have learned this formation? Without this formation, how could I dare to oppose the Mountain Wind Stronghold?" Li Xian felt emotional.

The Iron Net Catching Demons Formation did not require "martial arts," only cooperation. If the coordination was good, even rural farmers could kill martial artists.

After all, Li Xian had thought it through. If he himself were trapped in this formation, it would be difficult to escape, even if the formation was executed by farmers.

An iron net covering the body, spears thrusting. Without the lightness skill and the "rebirth" level of vitality and power like the Immortal in the Jar, one would become a sieve in an instant.

But Li Xian did not blindly copy it. He simplified the "Iron Net Catching Demons Formation" into the "Farmers Killing Bandits Formation," with teams of ten, five, or three people. Based on his own understanding and the current situation, he adapted it to local conditions.

Black River Village had over a hundred households. Although the villagers did not have enough to eat or wear, because of the heavy labor of fighting for water and farming every year, every household had two or three men. Adding the women and the elderly, there were about four or five hundred people. Mobilizing all of them was a considerable force.

As for the women in the village, they were not idle either. Li Xian arranged for them to set up traps along the roads.

Everything proceeded step by step.

In the village chief's house.

Li Xian said, "Fu Bo, I have something to ask you."

"Sir, please speak," Fu Bo said respectfully.

"You have lived here for a long. You must have heard something about the five leaders of the Mountain Wind Stronghold?" Li Xian asked.

"Yes," Fu Bo said. "I don't know much about the leader, Ma Daozi. But I know a bit about the second, third, fourth, and fifth leaders."

"Ma Daozi is an outsider. But the four brothers under him are locals, even from the surrounding villages."

Li Xian asked, "Please elaborate."

"The second leader, Hong Kai, is about my age. He was very active decades ago and was ruthless. But in the last ten years, he has rarely come down the mountain."

"The third leader, Peng Fox, was originally a petty thief from the neighboring 'Peng Village.' Somehow, he became the third leader."

"As for the fourth leader, his name is Niu Liang. He was originally a fisherman from Black River Port. He killed someone from the Black Water Gang and had no way out, so he joined the Mountain Wind Stronghold. Because he is reckless and daring in battle, he was appreciated."

"As for the fifth leader... this is terrifying, truly terrifying."

Speaking of this, Fu Bo's face was filled with fear.

"Why is he terrifying?" Li Xian asked.

Fu Bo said, "He is only thirty this year, but his methods are truly frightening. Before killing someone, he likes to peel their skin off alive."

"Among these leaders, I hear he is the most favored by the big leader. It seems... it seems that in some aspects, he is different from ordinary people?"

Li Xian's heart tightened.

He had heard Pang Long say that there are always some favored children of heaven in this world. When they reach the Essence-Eating Realm, their bodies gradually manifest strange phenomena!

The enemy is extremely strong!
