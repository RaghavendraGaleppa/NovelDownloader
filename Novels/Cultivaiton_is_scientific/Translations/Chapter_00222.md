# Chapter 222: Divine Ability

Within the Divine Footsteps (神足通) inheritance, the only technique Li Yuanba could learn at the Foundation Establishment stage was "Lotus Steps" (步步生莲). The other secret arts were simply beyond the capacity of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's spiritual power.

However, mastering the Lotus Steps technique was no easy feat. It required visualizing a "White Lotus Diagram" (白莲图) from the Divine Footsteps inheritance within one's consciousness. 

For an ordinary diagram, a Foundation Establishment cultivator's spiritual power would make visualization effortless. But this White Lotus Diagram was different. At first glance, it appeared ordinary, but upon closer inspection, every minute detail of the diagram was composed of countless Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures.

Without the unique transmission method of the Jade Foot Relic (玉足舍利), it would be impossible to convey such a technique through mere words and images. 

The White Lotus Diagram contained over ten billion Sanskrit characters. Even for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, visualizing such an enormous number of scriptures to form the diagram was a task most could never complete in their lifetime. 

Human memory has its limits. Memorizing ten billion Sanskrit characters and arranging them into a specific pattern was simply beyond the capability of ordinary cultivators. Only Buddhist monks, who had been exposed to Sanskrit scriptures since childhood and understood their arrangement and sequential meanings, could minimize the memory workload to some extent.

With the additional assistance of the Buddhist intent emanating from the Jade Foot Relic, this seemingly impossible task could be accomplished.

After just one glance, Li Yuanba abandoned any immediate plans to learn Lotus Steps. This was not something that could be achieved in a short time.

He was indeed interested in Lotus Steps. Mastering such a rapid movement technique would significantly enhance his combat power. 

Imagine a sword cultivator who could move as if teleporting—no ordinary cultivator would be able to land a hit on him, while the sword cultivator could unleash his flying sword with full force, maximizing his offensive potential without worrying about his own safety.

This was the idealized combat style for sword cultivators—at least, traditional sword cultivators pursued such methods. 

Li Yuanba was a traditional sword cultivator. His "Sword Demon Secret Codex" (剑魔秘典) only covered the Foundation Establishment stage, leaving him with just a single magic treasure sword for the Golden Core stage. 

His primary cultivation technique, "Sword Intent Soaring Sky Art" (剑意冲霄诀), was also a traditional sword cultivator's method, naturally leading him to pursue long-range combat—a safer approach.

Meanwhile, Li Shiming was studying Lotus Steps, the introductory technique of the Divine Footsteps. 

He was unaware of the true nature of the Divine Footsteps; otherwise, he wouldn't have remained so calm.

IBMz15 was processing the White Lotus Diagram. Even for the supercomputer, handling a diagram composed of ten billion Sanskrit characters took some time.

Li Shiming attempted to have IBMz15 transfer the White Lotus Diagram into his consciousness—a method he had used before for rapid memorization. As long as IBMz15 opened the document through him, it was equivalent to him quickly reviewing the document, imprinting all its contents directly into his mind.

This time, however, when IBMz15 transferred the White Lotus Diagram, his consciousness experienced a brief pause—an overload caused by the massive influx of data.

Fortunately, his spiritual power was strong enough. Few Foundation Establishment cultivators possessed divine sense, but he managed to withstand the impact of the White Lotus Diagram's overwhelming data flooding his consciousness.

Visualization involved materializing something within one's consciousness, a process typically reliant on mental power. 

Li Shiming cheated again, leveraging his unique connection with IBMz15 to manifest the White Lotus Diagram in his mind.

As soon as the White Lotus Diagram appeared, it emitted a faint glow, and instantly, he gained insight into Lotus Steps.

The White Lotus Diagram was the core of Lotus Steps. With it, white lotuses could inexplicably manifest in the external world, allowing him to teleport between them within a certain range.

The most illogical aspect of this technique was the teleportation itself. Only after comprehending the core principles of Lotus Steps did he realize it was genuine teleportation, not merely a speed-based movement method.

His current cultivation level hadn't exposed him to the concept of Nascent Soul-stage divine abilities, so he didn't realize he was practicing an introductory divine ability technique.

"This defies science!" he exclaimed inwardly. But attempting to explain the world of cultivation with science was inherently unscientific.

Li Shiming stored his flying boat. A white lotus appeared beneath his feet, suspending him motionless in the air.

Expanding his divine sense, he willed the White Lotus Diagram to project another lotus a hundred meters away. His figure vanished from his original position and reappeared atop the distant lotus.

During the disappearance and reappearance, he felt the surrounding scenery shift as if space itself had transformed.

This change nearly caused IBMz15—which was constantly collecting data through his divine sense—to crash. If the supercomputer had consciousness, it too would have exclaimed, "This defies science!"

Li Shiming discovered his teleportation range exceeded that of Monk Jueyuan. He projected another lotus, this time two hundred meters away—nearly double the distance Jueyuan had achieved in combat. Even when Jueyuan expended time to unleash his full power, he had only managed one hundred and fifty meters.

---

Li Shiming was at the early Foundation Establishment stage, while Jueyuan had been at the mid-stage. This difference wasn't due to cultivation level but rather spiritual power.

Li Shiming possessed divine sense—a rarity among Foundation Establishment cultivators—which was why he could extend Lotus Steps' range to two hundred meters.

White lotuses blossomed one after another ahead of him as his figure flickered in and out of existence midair. The only limiting factor was the projection speed of the White Lotus Diagram, but even that only required a mere thought to activate.

If energy consumption were disregarded, this movement technique was over twice as fast as sword flight.

With five breaths of preparation, he could extend his maximum range to three hundred meters—his current teleportation limit.

"This is how an immortal should move!" White lotuses bloomed in the air as his figure flickered between them in a dazzling display.

However, considering the alliance between the Shu Mountain Sect and the Thousand Leaves Temple, he needed to consult his master about Lotus Steps to avoid potential complications.

Upon realizing that Lotus Steps involved genuine teleportation, he had already guessed this technique must be top-tier. If the Shu Mountain Sect had records of it, he could use it freely without concern.

He then thought of Li Yuanba. Based on his analysis, Li Yuanba's spiritual power was significantly stronger than that of ordinary cultivators.

Though Li Yuanba hadn't developed divine sense, he had cultivated spiritual awareness during the Qi Refining stage, granting him greater spiritual power than most upon reaching Foundation Establishment. 

When Li Shiming developed divine sense, Li Yuanba's spiritual power had also benefited.

Since Li Yuanba's spiritual power could withstand the transmission of the White Lotus Diagram, Li Shiming decided to have him learn Lotus Steps as well.

However, Li Yuanba couldn't risk receiving the diagram on the battlefield. If enemies attacked while he was defenseless, the consequences would be dire.

Moreover, having spent considerable time in the battlefield, it was time to report Jueyuan's defeat.

Li Yuanba began his return to the border checkpoint, encountering no Thousand Leaves Temple monks along the way.

He took a direct route—one rarely patrolled by the temple's monks, who typically operated in coordinated formations.

Buddhist monks trained in group tactics—Two Forms, Three Talents, Four Symbols, Five Phases, Six Harmonies, Seven Regulators, Eight Trigrams, and Nine Palaces—enhancing their collective combat power by severalfold.

They often stationed themselves at fixed locations, lying in wait for demonic cultivators.

Demonic cultivators were known for their unpredictable ambush tactics, so the monks preferred to wait rather than actively hunt.

Li Yuanba's chosen path happened to be unpatrolled.

Upon returning to the checkpoint, he headed to the Mission Hall.

The hall was crowded with sect disciples, none of whom exhibited their usual demonic demeanor. Instead, they appeared amiable and smiling.

The checkpoint was considered sect territory, and disciples were careful not to cause trouble here.

More importantly, several Golden Core elders were stationed here—a rare opportunity to impress them and potentially be taken as disciples.

"It's a true disciple!" someone exclaimed as Li Yuanba entered.

True disciples were the masters of the battlefield, leading every major battle. They also served as the spiritual pillars for all sect disciples. A true disciple's defeat would devastate morale.

Among the crowd, a few disciples exchanged meaningful glances.

They had heard rumors of Wang Chengjun and other mid-Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators plotting against Li Yuanba. Wang Chengjun's murderous gaze hadn't gone unnoticed.

These observers had been waiting to see the outcome. If Wang Chengjun returned, it would mean Li Yuanba's demise. If Li Yuanba returned, the plot had failed.

Some had even placed bets, with only one disciple wagering on Li Yuanba's survival.

That disciple now grinned triumphantly as he collected his winnings.

"Do you think Wang Chengjun is still alive?" one disciple whispered via sound transmission.

"If this true disciple managed to return alive, there's no way he killed all those mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators," another replied dismissively.

Just as Wang Chengjun had dared to ambush Li Yuanba, few believed in the latter's combat prowess. Li Yuanba had been a true disciple for too short a time.

Potential was just that—potential. For a true disciple to become a formidable force required at least a decade or more. What could one year of cultivation achieve?

"Senior Brother Li, please present your achievements," the mission attendant said respectfully.

The attendant was also a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but as a long-serving sect administrator, his status paled in comparison to a true disciple's.

Li Yuanba produced Jueyuan's corpse and placed it before the attendant.

The observing disciples were disappointed to see only one body—a meager result for a true disciple.

Many ordinary disciples had surpassed this tally.

"His name was Jueyuan. Given his strength, he was likely a true disciple of the Thousand Leaves Temple," Li Yuanba said uncertainly, indifferent to their opinions.

Before he could finish, a figure materialized beside Jueyuan's corpse. Li Yuanba and the others promptly bowed.

It was Elder Lü.

"Well done, Li Yuanba! You've killed the Thousand Leaves Temple's third-ranked monk. Your master, Elder Sword, will be proud!" Elder Lü examined the corpse and sighed admiringly.

A single sword strike to the forehead, with lingering sword intent at the wound, confirmed a sword cultivator's handiwork.

The sword intent matched Li Yuanba's, and since he had acted alone, it meant he had defeated Jueyuan single-handedly—a feat that astonished even Elder Lü.

While sword cultivators were peerless in combat at equal levels, Jueyuan had been mid-Foundation Establishment.

Sect intelligence indicated Jueyuan had inherited divine abilities. If Li Yuanba could kill him, his potential far exceeded Jueyuan's.

Crucially, Elder Lü's inspection revealed no external aids—this had been a fair duel.

True disciples often possessed life-saving trump cards capable of slaying higher-level opponents, but such methods left traces.

"My master slays arhats. I still have a long way to go," Li Yuanba replied humbly.

"I have high hopes for you. Grow quickly, so our sect gains another powerful Golden Core sword cultivator," Elder Lü said encouragingly, patting his shoulder.

Li Yuanba frowned. Despite Elder Lü's genial demeanor, he was still a demonic Golden Core elder—hardly benevolent.

He immediately checked his body for any hidden marks.

After multiple inspections revealed nothing, he remained wary.

As a sect elder, Lü should have known better than to make physical contact unless between close friends or master-disciple pairs. Such contact easily bred suspicion.

A shadow crossed Elder Lü's eyes as he sensed Li Yuanba's spiritual probe.

He had indeed left a harmless mark, intending to privately inquire whether Jueyuan's belongings included a relic.

With other elders present, he couldn't press further.
