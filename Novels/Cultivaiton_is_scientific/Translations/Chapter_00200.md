# Chapter 200: Recovery  

Li Shiming was led by Elder Su into the sect's grand formation. He refrained from using his spiritual sense to probe—such a high-level formation would reveal little in a short time. More importantly, with Elder Su by his side, he dared not make any suspicious moves.  

Elder Su brought him to a mountain peak, stopping at a bamboo pavilion atop the summit.  

"Junior Li Shiming greets Elder Su. I come bearing a token entrusted to me by Xu Chuan!" Li Shiming formally saluted, presenting the token with both hands.  

Elder Su gently raised Li Shiming with a hand and took the token. He tapped it lightly, receiving a message left by Xu Chuan within. This confirmed Li Shiming's identity—a friend Xu Chuan had made outside the sect.  

"This is the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass I obtained," Li Shiming continued, producing a jade box and holding it out.  

At the mention of the herb, Elder Su's expression shifted, a flash of joy crossing his eyes. Suppressing his excitement, he accepted the box, opened it briefly to inspect, then swiftly closed it again.  

"Stay in that cave residence for now. Do not wander," Elder Su instructed tersely, tossing a cave control token to Li Shiming before turning to leave.  

Li Shiming understood Elder Su's urgency. Despite the elder's efforts to remain composed, the faint black veins in his eyes betrayed the severity of his injuries. For a Golden Core cultivator to lose control over such minute details, the damage must be grave.  

Though unclear on the specifics, Li Shiming guessed Elder Su had been desperately awaiting this herb.  

One thing puzzled him, however—why hadn't Elder Su asked about Xu Chuan? It was impossible that Elder Su didn't care about Xu Chuan, given how crucial this mission had been.  

Unable to make sense of it, Li Shiming set the thought aside.  

With the control token in hand, he made his way to a cave residence on the mountaintop.  

The spiritual energy here was so dense it intoxicated him. Even outside the cave, the ambient energy was more than sufficient for cultivation. The path he walked was lined with spirit plants, most of them second-grade, and in some areas shielded by formations, he sensed the presence of third-grade specimens.  

To any Foundation Establishment cultivator, every step here was a treasure trove.  

Of course, Li Shiming dared not touch anything. This was Elder Su's private mountain—every plant, flower, and speck of soil belonged to him. Taking anything would be tantamount to theft from a Golden Core elder.  

Marveling at the wealth of a major sect's elder, Li Shiming arrived at the cave entrance.  

Activating the formation with the token, he stepped inside and was immediately stunned by the concentration of spiritual energy. It saturated every inch of space, seeping into his pores with every breath.  

Without hesitation, Li Shiming seized this rare opportunity. Such a cave wasn't meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators—it was reserved for Golden Core elders or their esteemed guests. Only the urgency of the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass had granted him access.  

Entering the cultivation chamber, he sat atop the spiritual energy vent and began circulating the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art*.  

He had always assumed that once external spiritual energy met cultivation needs, additional density wouldn't matter. But here, the sheer abundance forced energy into his body, accelerating his progress. Moreover, the energy here was purer, further enhancing his conversion efficiency.  

Li Shiming immersed himself completely, even shutting off his five senses to focus solely on cultivation. He wouldn't waste a single moment of this chance.

Meanwhile, outside, True Disciple Ji Hongbo, the stationed cultivator Yin Shaotao of Guanshan Town, the six enforcers, and the Lie Mountain Four Tigers all awaited Elder Su's response. But the expected retaliation never came.  

After that day, Elder Su seemed to vanish without a trace.  

While the lack of action should have relieved Ji Hongbo, it only deepened his unease. The silence suggested something far more significant at play.  

Even Elder Ji grew restless, considering a direct confrontation with Elder Su to clear the air.  

"It seems that cultivator brought back the spirit herb Su needed," Elder Ji murmured with a sigh.  

His relationship with Elder Su was one of rivalry—not petty squabbles, but competition for the sect's Nascent Soul inheritance qualification.  

Their contest had begun in Qi Refining and continued unbroken. Elder Su's faction emphasized sincerity, earning him many allies, while Elder Ji relied on strategy and alliances built on mutual benefit, matching Elder Su's influence.  

Had Elder Su remained uninjured, their rivalry would have persisted fairly. But Elder Su's wounds from battling a demonic sect's Golden Core cultivator gave Elder Ji an opening.  

With Elder Su's patron in seclusion, Elder Ji intercepted the herbs crucial for his recovery, prolonging his injuries. Another year, and Elder Su's foundation would be irreparably damaged—even his patron's return couldn't salvage it then.  

"Man proposes, heaven disposes. Heaven favors him this time," Elder Ji muttered, shaking his head.  

He felt no regret. If this attempt failed, others would follow. If all else failed, they'd compete fairly.  

The Nascent Soul inheritance qualification was non-negotiable—it was his path to becoming a Nascent Soul cultivator.  

This qualification wasn't merely about techniques—most sect inheritances were already accessible to Golden Core elders like them. The true prize was the resources: fourth-grade materials gathered by Nascent Soul ancestors during their travels, some of which could enhance a Golden Core cultivator's chances of breaking through. These were reserved for the qualified.  

---  

In the Ten Thousand Mountains, within the Netherworld Sect's cave residence, Li Yuanba was also cultivating. With his annual tasks completed and a pressing need to grow stronger, he had entered seclusion.  

Though both body and clone cultivated top-tier techniques, Li Yuanba's Heavenly Spiritual Root granted him a clear advantage. His progress was nearly twice as fast as Li Shiming's—despite Li Shiming's superior cave.  

Li Shiming could already foresee Li Yuanba reaching Golden Core while he remained stuck in mid-Foundation Establishment.  

But this wasn't necessarily bad. By then, he'd have a Golden Core cultivator gathering resources for him.  

---  

Two months later, Elder Su reappeared at Sky Eye Peak, his aura vastly different—stronger, revitalized.  

Half that time had been spent processing materials and commissioning a trusted ally to refine the pills. After past betrayals, he dared not entrust his lifesaving herbs to just anyone.  

The remaining time was devoted to consuming the Three Suns Revival Pill. This third-grade pill not only purged the lingering demonic energy but also unleashed his long-suppressed power.  

Only after fully recovering did Elder Su remember Li Shiming, still confined to the cave residence.  

As an outsider, Li Shiming couldn't leave the cave—everywhere else was forbidden. Thankfully, Foundation Establishment cultivators had little need for sustenance. A Qi Refining cultivator might have starved in two months.  

Approaching the cave, Elder Su sent a spell inside to summon Li Shiming.  

Receiving no response, he opened the formation himself.  

Inside the cultivation chamber, he found Li Shiming in deep meditation. With a light tap, he roused the young cultivator.  

"Elder Su!" Li Shiming blinked, then bowed awkwardly, unsure how to explain his prolonged seclusion.  

Yet he was pleased with his progress—his spiritual lake now brimmed with thunder灵力, enough for extended battles without the previous energy shortages.  

"Don't apologize," Elder Su said with a smile. "Cultivators must seize every advantage—competing against time, rivals, and fate itself."  

He was pleased with Li Shiming. During his recovery, he'd investigated the young man thoroughly.  

The reports painted Li Shiming as a cultivator of clean background. Though from distant Heavenly Sea Island, inquiries through the North Shu Trading House and former Heavenly Sea cultivators confirmed his story.  

Li Shiming had left his sect with permission, seeking opportunities in North Shu.  

Moreover, delivering the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass was a deed worthy of Elder Su's protection, regardless of any complications.  

"Now, tell me of Xu Chuan. Why didn't he return?" Elder Su asked.  

"Brother Xu diverted a Four-Clawed Flood Dragon to aid my escape during the herb retrieval. I never saw him again," Li Shiming replied mournfully.  

"Xu Chuan lives. His soul lamp still burns in the sect—likely healing somewhere," Elder Su stated firmly.  

Now Li Shiming understood why Elder Su hadn't inquired earlier—he'd known Xu Chuan survived.  

"I assumed the herb was a joint effort, but it seems you retrieved it alone. Xu Chuan's message asked me to take you as a nominal disciple and admit you into the Shu Mountain Sect's inner circle," Elder Su paused.  

Li Shiming stood silently, uncertain of Elder Su's intent.  

"I must assess you first," Elder Su said, scanning Li Shiming with his spiritual sense. His expression turned odd. "Describe your cultivation—both primary and body-refining techniques."  

The inspection revealed Li Shiming's triple spiritual roots—mediocre talent. Yet his physical body surpassed even average mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators, rivaling specialized body refiners.  

According to reports, the Heavenly Sea Sect had contributed little to Li Shiming's growth—he'd been an ordinary disciple, albeit with ties to a True Disciple female cultivator and a Golden Core elder's favor.  

Such connections couldn't explain his physique.  

Moreover, Li Shiming's thunder灵力 indicated a rare lightning-based primary technique—another surprise.  

For a third-rate talent to master top-tier body and primary techniques, reach Foundation Establishment young, and do so without relying on Foundation Establishment Pills (whose residues would linger for years, detectable to Elder Su's senses) was extraordinary.  

Elder Su's questioning crossed normal boundaries, but Li Shiming's aid had been too significant to repay with mere nominal discipleship.  

He saw potential in Li Shiming but needed to ensure he was worthy.
