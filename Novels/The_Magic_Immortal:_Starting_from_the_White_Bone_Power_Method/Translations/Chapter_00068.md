# Chapter 68: Low-Grade Talisman Crafting Technique

In a delicately fragrant boudoir, the beauty mark removed her soft armor as if shedding a layer of exhaustion. With a sigh, she threw herself onto the jade bed, burying her face in the gentle embrace of the quilt and taking a deep breath.

She wanted to fall asleep just like that, but something still felt unsatisfying.

So she clamped the sandalwood pillow between her long legs, finding it much more comfortable and fulfilling this way.

The influx of southern migrants into the Bai Mountain region had brought endless chaos, and she hadn't slept for seven days and nights straight.

Taking advantage of the two new patrol teams arriving today and having managed to finish her tasks early, she was determined to get some proper rest.

First, a good, deep sleep. After waking up naturally, she would take a fragrant bath.

If there was moonlight tonight, she might as well burn some spiritual incense in the courtyard, set up a qin table among the flowers and plants, slowly play a tune, and raise a cup to the moon...

It was a pity that wild little rogue cultivator didn't know what was good for him. Otherwise, the two of them could have enjoyed the moonlit night, whispering sweet nothings under the song of the Spring Moon Cicada, sparing her this lonely and cold solitude.

A quick calculation told her she had been patrolling the wilderness for nearly three years. Though the place was chaotic and harsh, the life-and-death trials had worn down most of the bottleneck to the late Qi Refining stage.

Once the three-year term was up and she returned to the Duty Hall for debriefing, she would likely be promoted.

Then, with steady cultivation over the next few years and the aid of the Spring Moon Cicada, advancing to the late Qi Refining stage would come naturally.

However, since she had secretly refined the Spring Moon Cicada into her lifebound companion, that strand of Spring Longing would eventually need to be entrusted to someone.

Once entrusted, with the power of Spring Longing complementing her own, given her talent and resources, forming a mid-grade Dao Foundation would be within reach.

But the Spring Moon Cicada's entrustment didn't care about roots, talent, or background—only fate. That day, upon hearing the name "Wang Chan," the Spring Moon Cicada had bestowed its Spring Longing.

She had thought he was just a wild little rogue cultivator, easy to manipulate.

Unexpectedly, he turned out to be someone who yielded to softness but not force, with a peculiar fondness for widows, and didn't take her seriously at all. Truly infuriating.

"Do I really have to become a widow for this?"

The beauty mark frowned and sighed softly.

No matter what, before returning to the city, she would make that stubborn man yield beneath her soft armor.

After all, before meeting Wang Chan, the Spring Moon Cicada had searched fruitlessly for over a decade for someone to entrust its Spring Longing to. If she missed this chance, there might not be another.

If so, her path to Foundation Establishment would be endlessly delayed.

Lost in thought, the beauty mark gradually drifted into sleep.

**BANG BANG BANG!**

Just as she was sinking into deep slumber, urgent knocking at the door jolted her awake.

"Who is it?!"

Too lazy to get up, she took out the formation token, infused it with a spell, and shouted irritably into it.

"Boss, urgent report!" came the voice of a female patrol member.

"Don't bother me! I'm sleeping now!"

"It's important!"

"How important?! Even if Bai Shaofeng himself showed up, tell him to wait outside for me!"

"It's the Golden Snake Twins!"

"I don't care if it's the Golden Snake Twins, ranked sixty-ninth on the wilderness wanted list, or even the top three—Blood Ghost, Thunderblade, and Floral Skirt—attacking the wilderness outpost together! I'm sleeping first!"

"The Golden Snake Twins are heading to Lotus Mountain. According to intel, they plan to raid either Cave No. 68 or No. 69 tonight. Should we set up a trap—"

"Don't bother—" Mid-sentence, the beauty mark jolted upright as if struck by lightning. Frantically donning her soft armor, she demanded, "Which one? No. 68 or No. 69?!"

"U-uncertain. But the two caves are next to each other, so both might get hit—"

Before the female patrol member could finish, a lithe figure had already rushed out. Hastily summoning her Blood-Eyed Goat, she mounted it and slapped its rump hard, barking orders at the patrol member: "Gather the troops and follow me! Tonight, we’re chopping those Golden Snake Twins into pieces!"

"...Yes!"

The patrol member blinked in confusion, about to turn and call for backup, when the beauty mark—impatient with the goat's speed—stowed it in her spirit beast pouch and instead activated a mid-grade Wind-Soaring Talisman. A gust of wind erupted, sending leaves swirling as she vanished into the night.

Amid the gale, the beauty mark regretted not staying at Lotus Mountain today.

Outlaws on the wilderness wanted list were at least mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators, with the top thirty-six in the late stage. Especially the likes of Blood Ghost, Thunderblade, and Floral Skirt—even if patrols spotted their tracks, they usually turned a blind eye.

Why? Because chasing them was suicide.

Ordinary wilderness patrol members like them only earned thirty to fifty spirit coins a month. Not worth the risk.

Of course, if the targets were weak, they’d gladly make the arrest—earning both merit and bounties.

The Golden Snake Twins, ranked sixty-ninth, were no pushovers. Twin sisters with a telepathic bond, both mid-stage Qi Refiners, they kept a pair of Golden Leaf Snakes as spirit beasts.

Though only low-grade, these snakes had mid-tier bloodlines and wielded a mid-grade divine ability called Golden Thread Bind. Their attacks were swift and deadly, and even if the victim survived, they’d be left with lethal poison.

Rumor had it the twins had sacrificed their own husbands as blood offerings to forge their bond with the snakes.

They also allegedly knew a low-grade soul-attacking spell, killing silently—many mid-stage cultivators had fallen to it.

With her return to the city approaching, the beauty mark had wanted to boost her record by capturing a few outlaws ranked below sixty-fourth. She’d briefed her team, but hadn’t expected results so soon.

What she didn’t anticipate was the Golden Snake Twins targeting Lotus Mountain.

Cave No. 68 housed an old, hunchbacked man—a mid-grade spirit farmer, decently successful among wilderness rogue cultivators, but hardly worth the twins’ attention.

As for No. 69’s Wang Chan, just a low-grade physician, he shouldn’t have been a target either...

But the Golden Snake Twins were women!

Sometimes, women weren’t after money—but men’s bodies!

Most importantly, they were widows. Maybe that scoundrel Wang Chan, with his handsome face, had flirted with them, drawn to their widowhood, and provoked them into coming after him.

"Men—no good ones!"

**SHRRIP!**

"Luo Bing, watch out!"

"Gah!"

In a flash, two golden threads pierced through Luo Bing’s white silk kerchief and Old Zhang’s low-grade barrier talisman, embedding themselves in their chests. The threads split into countless strands, worming into their bodies through the wounds.

The attack was too fast. Before Old Zhang and Luo Bing could react, they collapsed, convulsing in agony.

Their organs and bones felt bound by countless golden threads, the pain so intense it seared their souls, choking them breathless.

Just as they thought death was near, the threads loosened and vanished into their flesh. The pain faded.

Gasping like drowning men washed ashore, Old Zhang tried to muster his strength—only to scream as his qi stagnated and blood froze. He couldn’t even stand.

"Bing'er, are you okay?"

"Brother Zhang, I—"

Luo Bing was equally pale and helpless.

"Giggle, what a devoted couple."

A woman in a black dress strolled into the courtyard, her high-heeled shoes clacking sharply, accentuating her swaying figure. A golden snake coiled around her thumb like a ring, while a golden talisman on her body shimmered into a protective barrier.

A mid-grade Golden Essence Talisman—stronger than a standard barrier.

Hiding by the door, Ma Kang greedily eyed the woman’s legs before schooling his expression into a fawning smile.

"Hehe, Lady Golden Snake, I’ve done my part. About the promised two thousand spirit coins—"

**THUNK!**

A low-grade golden sword shot from outside, piercing Ma Kang’s back.

He coughed blood, eyes wide, pointing weakly at the doorway. "Elder Sister... you... swore..."

"With no hope of Foundation Establishment, what use is a Dao Heart Oath?" Another black-clad woman—the elder Golden Snake twin—stood outside, also shielded by a Golden Essence Talisman. "A heartless wretch who betrays his savior doesn’t deserve to live."

**SCHLICK!**

The sword burst from Ma Kang’s chest, spraying blood before returning to the elder twin’s hand. She let her golden snake lap up the blood.

The two twins were nearly identical—same face, height, and attire. The only difference was their belts: red jade for the elder, white jade for the younger.

"The patrol left Lotus Mountain half an incense stick ago. They’ll be busy with the rogue cultivator settlement below for about half an hour," the elder said. 

"Only three caves here—No. 70 is empty, No. 69 has a low-grade physician. I’ll handle him. You finish here quickly—we must extract that low-grade talisman crafting technique!"
