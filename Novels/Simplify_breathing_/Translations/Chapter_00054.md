## Chapter 54: Earning Money

Chen Fei still entrusted Chi Defeng with the task of purchasing medicinal ingredients. Since their interests were now linked, Chi Defeng naturally wouldn't try to deceive Chen Fei with fake ingredients again. Moreover, after learning that Chen Fei was an alchemist, Chi Defeng finally understood why Chen Fei had immediately recognized the fake ingredients he had produced earlier. If an alchemist couldn't clearly discern the medicinal ingredients used in their elixirs, their skill level would likely be questionable.

Chen Fei didn't bother with Grass Reversion Pills; he went straight for Swift Spirit Pills. After all, Swift Spirit Pills sold for more, and more people in Xingfen City would purchase them. Unlike small counties like Pingyin, Xingfen City had more martial artists, and naturally, more powerful ones. While Bone Forging realm cultivators weren't "everywhere," Xingfen City was certainly not comparable to Pingyin County. When Chen Fei was in Pingyin County, he had already cultivated the Swift Spirit Pill to the Grand Perfection stage. Now, when refining a furnace of pills, he could perfectly utilize all the medicinal properties of the ingredients, yielding four Swift Spirit Pills per batch. The ingredients for Swift Spirit Pills weren't expensive; while it might be an exaggeration to say they grew everywhere, they were indeed very easy to gather. Many even cultivated them themselves, and they didn't require much time to mature. It was precisely because the raw materials were simple that pills like Swift Spirit Pills and Floating Essence Pills could become widely circulated. Those with rare ingredients were largely eliminated by history.

Early morning.

"Are these the ingredients for Floating Essence Pills?" Chi Defeng glanced at the list, looking at Chen Fei in surprise.

"You recognize them?" Chen Fei was also a little surprised.

"Did you forget what I did in Pingyin County before? Although those Floating Essence Pill formulas were fake, they were somewhat related." Chi Defeng laughed, but the astonishment in his eyes lingered as he looked at Chen Fei. In recent days, Chen Fei's pill yield for Swift Spirit Pills had already astonished Chi Defeng. As an experienced veteran, Chi Defeng knew many things. Thus, he understood how high Chen Fei's refining skill must be to achieve such a yield. Back in Pingyin County, Chi Defeng had never heard of anyone reaching this level. And now, Chen Fei was actually going to try refining Floating Essence Pills!

While the Swift Spirit Pill formula was undoubtedly precious to ordinary people, there were still channels to obtain it. However, Floating Essence Pills were definitely not available in Pingyin County. Xingfen City had them, but no one would reveal the formula. Not to mention, they had only been in Xingfen City for a few days, making it even more impossible to obtain the Floating Essence Pill formula. Therefore, it was highly probable that Chen Fei had deduced it himself, and such alchemy talent was truly terrifying.

Chen Fei could still increase his pill production. In Xingfen City, the ingredients for Swift Spirit Pills were not difficult to buy. Chen Fei could easily earn over a thousand taels a day. However, Chen Fei ultimately suppressed this thought; too much production was prone to problems. Of course, too little was also something Chen Fei wasn't willing to do. He eventually settled on a moderate number. Such matters of profit always came with risks; it just depended on how much each person was willing to bear.

It had been nearly ten days since they arrived in Xingfen City. Besides the Swift Spirit Pill sales getting on track, the deduction of the Floating Essence Pill formula was also nearing its end. It was much smoother than Chen Fei had imagined, perhaps largely due to his current refining skill. Of course, the incomplete formula from the Zhao family also helped significantly. All these factors meant that Chen Fei could now attempt to refine Floating Essence Pills. As long as he succeeded once, the speed at which Chen Fei accumulated wealth would accelerate again. Chen Fei had always coveted the cultivation technique on his panel, 'Dragon Elephant Suppressing Art,' but fifty thousand taels was a daunting sum. Progress on pills was roughly as described, but what made Chen Fei happiest was that the 'Startling Swallowing Art' cultivation technique had finally advanced to Grand Perfection.
