Chapter 81: Outsider Saint

“You two are both more of a mess than the other!”

Zhou Lin, drenched like a drowned rat, once again transformed into Sister Fenfang. She swore never to go into the mountains with Qin Ming and Xu Sheng again in the near future.

After returning to the city, Qin Ming calmed his mind and did not find any suspicious individuals. Yet, slowly, his instinctive intuition sensed something abnormal.

There was indeed no one directly watching him near the inn, but the four-colored sparrows on the eaves were unusual, and the small black birds on the ridge of the roof also seemed problematic.

Qin Ming was alarmed. If these birds were all compromised, his location would have been infiltrated like a sieve.

In fact, he had always been wary of special species like sparrows and crows, having witnessed how cunning they could be. He hadn't expected that some birds he had overlooked also had a “roguish gleam” in their eyes, which was highly abnormal.

Qin Ming secretly observed, comparing them to ordinary birds, and indeed found six that were quite unusual. After his fourth rebirth, his instinctive awareness had improved, and he chose to trust this feeling. It turned out he was being monitored by a group of unscrupulous birds.

“It's not that Xu Sheng, from his frequent night travels, picked something up; it’s that there’s a problem with my side,” Qin Ming closed the window, pondering who was targeting him. He felt this method was too "gentle." If it were truly ruthless individuals, they would have no qualms and would directly crush him with overwhelming force.

At this stage, the Cui family certainly didn't want him to die suddenly, because if something happened to him, everyone would think they were too harsh, ruthless, and unrighteous. Moreover, the Cui family would absolutely not want any other family to move against him at this time. Considering this, now was a relatively safe period for Qin Ming.

“Power must be used.” He now held a high-level token and planned to leverage Chixia City's strength to investigate.

“Young Master Qin, the City Lord requests your presence.” A man in black arrived at the inn to see Qin Ming, extremely polite.

Qin Ming rose and went directly to the City Lord’s mansion with him.

It was the same simple, rustic living room, adorned with ancient bronze artifacts like chime bells and tripods. Calming incense slowly burned in the censer, its smoke rising like threads.

Meng Xinghai greeted him with a smile, saying, “Come, taste this year’s first tea from that old tea tree outside the Thunderflame Alchemy Palace, the one repeatedly struck by lightning yet stubbornly alive. It was just picked and roasted today.”

Qin Ming paid his respects. After sitting down, he drank tea and chatted with Meng Xinghai, feeling that Old Meng was even more cordial than last time.

Meng Xinghai repeatedly wanted to speak but swallowed his words each time. After all, the matter he wanted Qin Ming to assist with was not simple and was bound to involve a group of familiar faces from aristocratic families. Although he had means to obscure the young man's true appearance for a few days, Qin Ming's cultivation realm was somewhat low. Taking up a Golden Armor Guard spot meant for Li Qingyue and participating in the confrontation in that spiritual cave would be extremely dangerous.

Meng Xinghai thought for a moment. There was still time, so he temporarily refrained from mentioning the upcoming competition among a group of the most outstanding Outer World disciples for a certain legendary item.

“Are you accustomed to living in Chixia City? Have you encountered any problems?” he asked casually.

“Uncle Meng, I won’t stand on ceremony with you. As a matter of fact, I do have something. I'm being monitored, and I almost had an accident in the mountains.”

Meng Xinghai thought to himself, *This boy is truly too informal. Every time I ask a casual question, he naturally spills something.* However, Meng Xinghai found it no trouble at all; rather, he was pleased. Otherwise, immediately bringing up the Outer World disciples’ affairs would make it seem like he was demanding repayment for a favor.

“Such a thing is happening? Daring to do such a thing in Chixia City? Thoroughly investigate!” Meng Xinghai ordered his trusted aide to find out.

“Thank you, Uncle Meng.” Qin Ming stood up and poured him tea, genuinely grateful.

“Why be so polite with me?” Meng Xinghai drank his tea, then casually asked, “You endured six or seven waves of heavenly light last time, and not a single injury?”

“I sustained some injuries and recovered after two days of rest.” Qin Ming wanted to say a few more days, but then remembered he had met Meng Xinghai two days after that incident.

“You little rascal are still hiding your true abilities from me. You must have been undergoing rebirth during those two days! Truly remarkable, to withstand the erosion of heavenly light. Perhaps I will truly need your help in the future.”

“Uncle Meng, just give the command.”

Meng Xinghai waved his hand, saying, “No rush, let’s see how the situation develops. We’ll talk about it later.” He looked at Qin Ming and sighed, “Your talent is so extraordinary. If assisted by an aristocratic family’s resources, unconstrained by the golden age period, allowing you to embark on the path of rebirth earlier, you should be able to emit heavenly light outwards by now.”

“The Outsider Saint realm?” Qin Ming asked.

“That term isn't popular anymore. Both those secret sects and those from beyond the mundane world mock our realm, calling it ‘nephew’ [a pun on ‘外圣’ which sounds like ‘外甥’ – nephew],” Meng Xinghai said with some emotion. “Thinking back to the pioneering era, when the Rebirth method paved the way, how glorious and incredibly powerful the Outsider Saint stage was! But who knew that our path would become increasingly difficult, increasingly narrow!”

Qin Ming nodded. “This is the path of ordinary people. How else can one advance? Only through physical mutation. Fortunately, through the research of our predecessors, the Rebirth realm is now considered controllable.”

Meng Xinghai said, “This path is difficult. After the Rebirth stage, one can only advance step by step; the body can no longer mutate.” He looked at Qin Ming, “You must strive for nine rebirths!”

After recovering his memories, Qin Ming naturally understood these things. Even in thousand-year aristocratic families, it was extremely rare for someone to achieve nine rebirths; eight was generally the limit. From a simple perspective, mutating eight times was already incredibly difficult; one had to find other methods to advance. At that point, by using certain medicines to break through, one could manifest heavenly light outwards, entering the Outsider Saint realm. After that, one could capture spiritual substances from the void and proceed on the path.

In fact, achieving seven rebirths was the ultimate dream for many. Through consuming powerful medicines, they could manifest heavenly light outwards and enter that realm.

Qin Ming said, “Uncle Meng, you flatter me too much. Nine rebirths, no one has achieved that for many years now, have they?”

Meng Xinghai’s eyes gleamed. “It’s just us two talking right now, so you don’t need to be modest. Just based on your ability to withstand six or seven waves of heavenly light at your current stage, I believe your talent is exceptional and you can achieve nine rebirths.”

After his old head injury healed, Qin Ming naturally understood this. For ordinary people, achieving nine rebirths was as difficult as ascending to heaven. Because, during the first rebirth, one's arms must possess nearly a thousand jin of strength. At that point, one could already be called a prodigious youth. The book Xu Sheng read also recorded that reaching this level, revered as a prodigious youth, was already a legend!

Meng Xinghai’s eyes were deep. “How do you know there aren't hidden dragons with nine rebirths within the thousand-year aristocratic families?” He then sighed, “It is only because those creatures close to deities are too terrifying, and those near immortals are too strong to be fathomed, that those of us on this path appear increasingly dim.”

“Are there any people who have achieved ten rebirths?” Qin Ming asked.

Meng Xinghai chuckled dumbfounded, “The number nine is already the final transformation.” He continued, “Of course, there are differences among those with nine rebirths. There are vague records that some, during their first rebirth, possessed a thousand jin of strength. Such individuals' nine rebirths would be even more powerful.”

Qin Ming actually knew all this. Whether one was a prodigious youth with nearly a thousand jin of strength during their first rebirth or even surpassed that legend, the ultimate result was still nine rebirths. However, the benefits gained from the final rebirth differed; the more one surpassed the legend, the greater the feedback received during the ninth rebirth.

The two chatted congenially, and Qin Ming was invited to stay for dinner. Just as he finished eating and put down his chopsticks, Meng Xinghai's trusted aide returned, stating that the investigation results were clear.

Qin Ming was surprised; the efficiency was truly high.

“We used exotic birds to capture the problematic birds outside the inn. Following the trail, we found Xinyi Hall, and then rooted out the people behind it. We also apprehended two implicated deputy heads of Xinyi Hall.”

“Where are the people behind it?” Meng Xinghai asked.

“We brought them.”

Soon after, a pale-faced youth appeared, accompanied by an old man and a young man.

“Brother Cui, no, Brother Qin, I’m truly sorry, I… I didn’t want to do this either,” the youth apologized as soon as he entered, bowing and cupping his hands.

Indeed, as Qin Ming had expected, it wasn't some old monster or ruthless figure. He had an impression of this sixteen or seventeen-year-old youth; he should be Zhao Jingshuo, who was always at the very back during their travels back then, sometimes not even having a seat at the last table.

Qin Ming looked at him, saying nothing.

Zhao Jingshuo saw the face before him. Even though he knew Qin Ming no longer held his former noble status and was now an ordinary person, he still felt a tremor of fear when truly close.

“Brother Qin, you should understand, how could someone like me dare to wade into such troubled waters? Among those former acquaintances, I could only stand at the very back. I was forced into it! Just one look, one hint from them, and I dared not refuse!” Zhao Jingshuo’s voice became tearful, whether truly afraid or just acting.

“Who told you to do this?” Meng Xinghai asked.

“City Lord Meng, I…” Zhao Jingshuo was truly trembling this time, knowing that the other party was one of the vigorous young talents dispatched by a thousand-year aristocratic family, frequently changing locations as a form of tempering.

“Speak!” Meng Xinghai glared at him.

“They are all people Brother Qin knows. One is that old acquaintance from the Zheng family, and the other is Li Qingxu’s cousin,” Zhao Jingshuo tearfully confessed.

“One by one, they are so young, yet so restless and rotten to the core,” Meng Xinghai said, staring at Zhao Jingshuo. “You go back and tell the Cui family directly.”

“I…” Zhao Jingshuo was nearly in tears. He was truly having a difficult time, but in the end, he had to nod.

“Brother Qin, I only have two hundred day-gold left, and it’s all been spent. I’ll compensate you next time,” Zhao Jingshuo took out a money bag and handed it over with both hands.

Qin Ming accepted it without ceremony. Two hundred day-gold, if spent frugally, would be enough for a family of three in Black and White Mountain to live for two hundred years. In Chixia City, prices were higher, so it would be about one-third of that.

Zhao Jingshuo saw him take it and secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Even after more than two years, seeing that face again, he still felt some reverence.

“Leave that bow too,” Qin Ming pointed to the large bow on the young man’s back. Clearly, it was a fine bow, and the young man was quite resistant and unwilling.

Zhao Jingshuo anxiously urged, “Quickly give it to Brother Qin! I’ll compensate you later.”

“You may go.” Qin Ming waved his hand. If he had violently killed the three, it would likely cause some problems. It was more suitable to let them return and tell the Cui family about this incident.

The next day, someone secretly came to the inn to visit Qin Ming.

“Young Master Qin, I am Dai Shifeng, a deputy head of Xinyi Hall.” The old man who arrived introduced himself. After two deputy heads were arrested, he was now considered the second-in-command of that organization. He quickly stated, “Our head, Ge Qianxun, wants to deal with you and instructed us to find an opportunity to kill you in the mountains.”

Qin Ming looked at him, saying, “You all certainly don't take the conventional path. Why are you here to inform on him?”

“Because I found that Hall Head Ge Qianxun is secretly selling off properties and other assets, and covertly embezzling Xinyi Hall's private funds. He is likely preparing to flee.” Dai Shifeng was quite cautious; he had originally opposed taking on such a hot potato. However, he found Ge Qianxun acting on his own initiative, then investigated, discovering that the boss was preparing to abandon everything.

“He must have also been forced by others. So, having no other choice, he happily took a sum of day-gold from the other party and plans to complete this deal and then disappear, leaving a pile of messes for us.”

“He’s a hall head, the leader of an organization. He’s just abandoning his foundation like that?” Qin Ming asked.

Dai Shifeng explained, “What major organization can there be in Chixia City? We are just a small hall; he doesn’t care about it at all. Moreover, I suspect he is one of the Golden Thieves and has already sensed that the situation is unfavorable, so he wants to lie low from the new City Lord.”

“Hmm, what is his strength like?” Qin Ming asked.

Dai Shifeng informed him, “He consumed spiritual substances over twenty times, pushing himself to the realm of six rebirths. But he failed after consuming a powerful medicine in the final stage, unable to advance to the Outsider Saint realm where one emits heavenly light outwards. Finally, he did not hesitate to deplete his potential, taking forbidden medicine to push himself to the realm of seven rebirths, halting his progress for life at that point.”

“Where is Ge Qianxun now?” Qin Ming asked.

Dai Shifeng replied, “He is very cautious. Currently, he is outside the city. He keeps a flying beast, and he will flee if the situation turns unfavorable. I suspect that after he coordinates with us to deal with you, he will immediately mount that fierce beast and escape far away.”

Qin Ming nodded. “Then let’s discuss…”

Two days later, after Qin Ming had spoken with relevant individuals, he left the city alone. Not long after entering the mountain forest, Dai Shifeng appeared with his men, surrounding him.

At the same time, two fierce beasts appeared in the sky. On one black giant beast stood an old man, presumably Ge Qianxun, the head of Xinyi Hall. On the other silver exotic beast was a young man, looking down impassively.

“The employer has appeared in person! Another familiar face, and one with no small background!” Qin Ming stared at the sky.

He sighed. As an ordinary person, he just wanted to fulfill his grandfather’s wish, grow up safely, and live a good life, but some people simply wouldn't give him a way out.

Qin Ming's expression gradually turned cold. “Since you’ve forced me to this point, I can only demonstrate my true strength and make City Lord Meng firmly support me!”
