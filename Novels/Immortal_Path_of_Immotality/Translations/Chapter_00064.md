# Chapter 64: Wind-Attributed Spirit Fruit

Under the cover of night, Lin Shan followed Gongsun Yu's directions. Turning right at the intersection ahead and walking about four or five li, he arrived at a brightly lit town. 

A large stone stood beside the road, inscribed with two ancient seal script characters: "Yi Chuan."

"Is this the gathering place of cultivators?" 

With the excitement of a fledgling returning home, Lin Shan approached the city walls step by step, his heart surging as if on a pilgrimage.

Two late Qi Refinement cultivators in blue and white robes stopped him at the gate, extending their hands. "Token!"

Lin Shan was puzzled. "What token?"

Seeing his confusion, the two raised their eyebrows. "New here?"

Lin Shan quickly admitted he was.

Without further ado, they took him aside to register. After briefly recording his name, they extracted a wisp of his aura and imprinted it onto a token resembling a magical artifact.

Once done, Lin Shan held the token. His enhancement panel popped up, but the item wasn't worth enhancing—it was just an identification badge.

A nearby cultivator, likely a market enforcer, briefly instructed him: "To rent a cave dwelling, take your identity token to the Internal Affairs Hall in the city center."

"Cave dwellings in the mountains outside the city cost two spirit stones per month."

"Those within the city range from ten spirit stones monthly for basic ones to thirty for premium ones."

"The southern district is for street vendors, the north for shops, the east for residential areas, and the west for entertainment."

"Fighting is strictly prohibited within the market. Violators will be expelled from Yi Chuan permanently."

"Monthly checks are conducted for cultivators who avoid renting caves and practice in the mountains illegally. Offenders face permanent banishment."

After explaining the rules and ensuring Lin Shan understood, the enforcers let him pass.

Upon entering, Lin Shan immediately sensed the spiritual energy inside was over three times denser than outside—fifteen times that of the mortal world! No wonder accommodations were so expensive.

He mentally tallied his assets. From the Hook-Nosed Man and the Green-Robed Elder, he had collected about 50 spirit stones each—likely a decade's worth of their mortal world tributes.

The Hook-Nosed Man's storage pouch only contained a low-grade magical sword and some smithing manuals. The Green-Robed Elder's held a small tower for raising flying ants, unidentified vials, and insect-rearing notes.

Lin Shan regretted destroying their talismans and artifacts in battle, leaving little loot.

The Green-Robed Elder's gourd for raising moths was also ruined. The flying ants in the tower had been left behind when fleeing Princess Guo's pursuit. Only the empty tower remained, though it still held some insect eggs.

But Lin Shan knew nothing about insect rearing—it would take years of hands-on practice to master. Now at the market, his priority was selling these useless items for profit.

His total spirit stones amounted to 220: 30 reserved for the Grand Elder's Vermilion Fruit, 80 for redeeming the courtesan for Immortal Huang, leaving him with only 110. 

He couldn't touch Immortal Huang's funds, unsure how much more was needed for the courtesan's freedom. Returning excess was fine, but covering shortages was out of the question.

With his limited funds, he could barely afford a year's stay in the market—and that was without purchasing anything else.

"Enough overthinking. First, find lodging."

Though lanterns lit the streets, shops were closed at night, with few cultivators about. Lin Shan found an inn, renting a room for one spirit stone per three nights to rest after his fortnight-long journey.

The next morning, Lin Shan opened his window to see cultivators already bustling outside. Most seemed to have come from outside the city—urban prices forced many to live in the outskirts.

After leaving the inn, he headed to the shop district, locating the Hundred Treasures Pavilion as instructed by the Nightingale Grand Elder.

The pavilion stood prominently in a bustling area, its ornate architecture and yellow-tiled roof exuding grandeur. Inside, various cultivation resources—techniques, pills, weapons, ores, herbs, puppets, and formations—were neatly categorized.

A sharp-eyed attendant approached as Lin Shan browsed. "Fellow Daoist, are you seeking something specific?"

After some awkward searching, Lin Shan admitted, "I heard your establishment sells innate Vermilion Fruits..."

The attendant nodded. "Ah, the Five Elements Spirit Fruits. Please, have a seat."

Soon, a long jade box was presented. Inside lay five spirit fruits of different colors—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

"Which element and how many? Each costs thirty spirit stones, fair and square."

Lin Shan realized these fruits, fiercely contested by innate experts in the mortal world, were as common as cabbages to cultivators. 

Since the Grand Elder hadn't specified an element, Lin Shan chose wood—its gentle energy would suit the elder best. 

Paying thirty stones, he stashed the fruit, relieved to fulfill one promise. The remaining twenty stones from the Grand Elder were now his to spend.

Curious, Lin Shan asked, "Are there wind-attributed versions of these fruits?"

The attendant, pleased with the sale, replied, "While we lack wind-type Vermilion Fruits, we do have other wind-attributed spirit fruits. Would you like to see?"

Lin Shan agreed. Soon, a jade jar the size of a teapot was brought out, containing green dates brimming with pure wind energy. Just sensing them made Lin Shan crave their power—regular consumption would swiftly push him to peak Qi Refinement sixth layer.

Noticing his interest, the attendant smiled. "Wind Dates—twenty per jar, sixty spirit stones."
