# Chapter 62: Reward

Returning home, Li Shiming couldn't quite understand why that Xuanming Sect cultivator had been carrying two storage pouches. 

He felt relieved of psychological pressure now. Since the Foundation Establishment cultivator had found one of the Xuanming Sect member's storage pouches, they probably wouldn't suspect the existence of a second one.

After many sleepless nights, even as a cultivator, his low cultivation level left him utterly exhausted. 

Before going to sleep, he directed his consciousness into his computer room space. He examined the storage pouch he had picked up - it looked distinctly different from ordinary storage pouches. 

Shaking his head, he decided not to dwell on its appearance. The storage pouches he'd obtained before all came from rogue cultivators - perhaps sect cultivators' pouches were simply different. 

With this thought, he retrieved the pouch from the computer room space and channeled spiritual power into it. 

The moment Li Shiming sensed the contents, he nearly threw the pouch away in shock. Instead of the expected items, the pouch contained a corpse.

He wasn't unfamiliar with dead bodies, but this one was completely different from any he'd seen before. The corpse wore a black robe, its exposed skin displaying a bronze-like hue. 

Most disturbingly, the corpse emitted waves of yin-cold spiritual energy, which continued circulating within its body. The environment inside this pouch also differed from normal storage pouches - it was filled with yin energy, perfectly suited to preserve the corpse's condition.

"This isn't a storage pouch - it's a space pouch for refining corpses!" Li Shiming realized what he had obtained. He didn't know the pouch's proper name, but understood its purpose.

He worried whether the corpse might emerge from the pouch, but fortunately it remained perfectly still, allowing the yin-cold spiritual energy to circulate undisturbed. 

Unsure how to handle the refined corpse, Li Shiming decided to keep it stored for now. Judging by its current state, it would remain peacefully inactive without his intervention.

Early the next morning, a Hundred-Mile Message Talisman from Gu Jia summoned Li Shiming to the courtyard outside the imperial palace - a place he'd visited once before.

"Little friend Li, Elder Cui mentioned you and wants to give you a reward. Be very careful - this concerns your future survival in the sect!" Gu Jia unusually greeted him at the gate, immediately whispering this warning through transmitted sound.

Unable to transmit sound himself, Li Shiming could only nod emphatically to show understanding.

Entering the room, he saw Elder Cui seated in a chair examining something. The elder didn't look up when Li Shiming entered.

He stood quietly for about the time it takes an incense stick to burn.

"Good temperament. I've reviewed your records. Tell me, what cultivation method are you practicing?" Elder Cui finally nodded and asked.

Although Gu Jia's investigation results were included in the records, Elder Cui needed absolute certainty about Li Shiming's background before awarding him anything. 

After all, his reward would virtually guarantee Li Shiming's entry into Tianhai Sect. No matter which Foundation Establishment cultivator presided over the Ascension Assembly, none would dare refuse Li Shiming and risk offending Elder Cui.

Understanding the importance, Gu Jia had taken extra care to warn Li Shiming.

"Honored elder, this junior practices the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art', discovered in the back garden of Nanling Prefecture's government office," Li Shiming replied with a bow.

"'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' - that's actually a top-tier Qi Refinement method. You're quite fortunate," Elder Cui remarked with a smile before continuing, "It seems you won't need to select a primary cultivation method after entering the sect. The 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' can carry you all the way to peak Qi Refinement."

Pausing thoughtfully, the elder considered for a moment.

Li Shiming's heart leapt with joy. If even a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Elder Cui called the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' a top-tier method, he wouldn't need to change techniques. 

Switching cultivation methods significantly impacted cultivators, wasting considerable time converting existing spiritual power to the new method's format. Moreover, everyone naturally wanted their cultivation method to be the best available.

"Gu Jia mentioned you inquired about using magical instruments. I'll teach you the 'Dragon Painting Dotting Eyes Art' for controlling magical instruments," Elder Cui said solemnly. 

"Although I discovered this technique during my travels, it's already been reported to the sect. Therefore, you alone may learn it - no transmission to others. Understood?"

"Thank you, elder! This junior will strictly comply," Li Shiming bowed gratefully.

"Learn it here now. After mastering it, I'll reclaim the jade slip," Elder Cui instructed, producing a rectangular green jade slip and placing it before Li Shiming.

Accepting the jade slip - his first time handling one, though he'd read about them - Li Shiming examined it curiously. 

Jade slips served as treasure vessels for recording cultivation methods in the immortal world. Their contents could endure for millennia unaffected, far outlasting paper records. 

Moreover, many profound cultivation methods contained vast amounts of information that would require impractical quantities of paper. A single jade slip could store enormous volumes of data, making them the preferred medium for sect transmissions.

"Place it against your brow and concentrate your mind to perceive it," Elder Cui advised kindly, noticing Li Shiming's uncertainty.

Positioning the jade slip against his forehead and focusing his consciousness there, Li Shiming received a stream of information - images and text. 

Fortunately, the 'Dragon Painting Dotting Eyes Art' wasn't excessively profound. Even without IBMz15's assistance, a cultivator's enhanced memory could retain it after several reviews. 

He not only memorized it personally but also created a document in IBMz15 to archive the technique. 

Not wanting to appear exceptional, he reviewed the jade slip's contents five times - what seemed a normal memorization duration - before removing it from his forehead.

"The 'Dragon Painting Dotting Eyes Art' is a universal method for controlling magical instruments, and can be considered an introductory sword cultivator technique. Don't disappoint it," Elder Cui said while retrieving the jade slip with a wave of his hand.

With another wave, Elder Cui dismissed him.

Understanding the gesture, Li Shiming respectfully bowed and withdrew from the room.

"Receiving Elder Cui's approval before the Ascension Assembly means you're practically guaranteed to become my junior brother. Master the 'Dragon Painting Dotting Eyes Art' well - you'll understand its value once you enter the sect," Gu Jia said while seeing him out, patting his shoulder.

"I must thank elder brother for this," Li Shiming replied earnestly with a deep bow. 

From Elder Cui's words, he'd discerned how much Gu Jia had advocated for him - without which the elder might not have shown such favor.
