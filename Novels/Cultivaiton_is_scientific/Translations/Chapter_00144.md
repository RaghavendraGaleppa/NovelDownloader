# Chapter 144: New Abode

Li Shiming arrived at Xun Peak once again, but this time not as a spiritual farmer.  

The cave dwelling was located on a subsidiary peak adjacent to Xun Peak, a smaller mountain than the main peak, with the cave positioned midway up the slope.  

This area was rather unique—the entire side of the mountain was relatively gentle, except for a short cliff with a significant drop where the cave was situated.  

Apart from this single cave dwelling, the surrounding area was entirely covered in spiritual fields.  

Fortunately, cultivators didn't need to walk, or else entering and exiting the cave would have been quite troublesome.  

The spiritual fields of Xun Peak didn’t allow people to come and go as they pleased, as the spiritual plants grown in the mid-grade spiritual fields were already quite valuable.  

Some of the medicinal herbs produced in these mid-grade fields could even serve as ingredients for Foundation Establishment-stage pills.  

Flying above the mid-grade spiritual fields, one could immediately sense the purity of the spiritual energy in the air.  

Occasionally, dark clouds would rise—these were the spiritual farmers casting spells to irrigate the fields.  

It was precisely because of the spiritual farmers' continuous use of rain-summoning techniques that Xun Peak's environment was the best among the nine peaks.  

Upon reaching the entrance of the cave dwelling, Li Shiming took out his identity jade token, and the cave's defensive formation automatically deactivated.  

The moment he stepped inside, he was enveloped by a rich concentration of spiritual energy.  

Compared to the lower-grade spiritual vein, the spiritual energy here was more than twice as dense.  

He hadn’t expected that, even as a Qi Refinement cultivator, he would need to seek out a better spiritual vein due to insufficient energy.  

Back when he had discovered the lower-grade spiritual vein in the underground space of Eagle Beak Island, he had thought it would be enough to sustain him until the peak of Qi Refinement.  

The cave followed the standard layout for cultivators—one main hall, two rooms (a cultivation chamber and a storage room), with the mid-grade spiritual vein’s energy outlet located in the cultivation chamber.  

There was no extra space in the cave, let alone any area for growing spiritual plants. Outside the cave was the cliff face, and beyond that lay the sect’s mid-grade spiritual fields.  

As for the cave interior, this wasn’t Eagle Beak Island—he couldn’t just dig around as he pleased.  

The sect’s cave dwellings in the nine peaks had to be maintained exactly as they were when assigned.  

Cultivators only had usage rights, not ownership. Once someone died or left the sect, the cave would be reclaimed.  

Thus, there were no traces left behind by previous occupants, let alone any hidden secrets.  

Li Shiming took out formation flags and set up a new defensive isolation formation, creating a dual-layered formation with the original one.  

This place was merely for cultivation—he would come here daily to train and then return to Eagle Beak Island afterward.  

He also noticed a downside to the cave dwellings in the nine peaks: the sense of confinement. The cramped space made him feel as if he had returned to the big cities of his past life, where owning a two-bedroom apartment through sheer hard work was already considered a success.  

But after getting used to the spacious environment of Eagle Beak Island—where even the underground space was larger than this cave—he found it hard to adjust.  

Li Shiming had come only to take possession of the cave and set up the formations. Once that was done, he didn’t linger and immediately left.  

"Senior Brother Li!" a clear voice called out.  

Li Shiming turned toward the sound and smiled, then flew over using his wings.  

Outside the mid-grade spiritual fields stood three Qi Refinement cultivators, one of whom was Jin Fengzhi—a fellow disciple who had entered the sect with him and was also from Great Xia.  

Jin Fengzhi, once the Fourteenth Princess of Great Xia, now bore no trace of royal demeanor. She wore the standard sect-issued robe, devoid of any adornments.  

"Junior Sister Jin, have you become a spiritual farmer?" Li Shiming greeted the other two cultivators with a nod before asking Jin Fengzhi with a smile.  

"I’ve just learned the 'Earth Spirit Art,' but I’m only an assistant to a spiritual farmer," Jin Fengzhi replied with a helpless shake of her head.  

She still remembered how Li Shiming had mastered spiritual farming techniques right after entering the sect.  

It was precisely because of his status as a primary spiritual farmer that he had chosen to leave the sect’s cave dwellings in the nine peaks.  

"This is Senior Brother Cheng, the spiritual farmer I’m assisting, and this is Senior Brother Zhang," Jin Fengzhi suddenly realized she hadn’t introduced the two and quickly did so before asking curiously, "Senior Brother Li, have you joined Xun Peak?"  

Running into Li Shiming here had piqued her interest.  

After the initial training period ended and they went their separate ways, she had heard nothing about him.  

Now, seeing his demeanor—especially the wings he had used to fly—it was clear he was doing well, which filled her with envy.  

Moreover, among their batch of new disciples, most were struggling. Without a leader, they had no one to turn to when facing mistreatment.  

"I haven’t joined Xun Peak. I just applied for a cave dwelling here—it’s over there," Li Shiming replied honestly, pointing toward the cliff.  

"To think Senior Brother Li’s cave is so close to us! We’ll have to rely on your guidance in the future," said Senior Brother Cheng, the spiritual farmer who had remained silent until now.  

When he first saw Li Shiming, he had sensed that his cultivation was at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement—the same as his own.  

Thus, when Jin Fengzhi greeted Li Shiming, he hadn’t reacted much.  

Jin Fengzhi had only been in the sect for three years and was merely at the second layer of Qi Refinement. If not for her learning the 'Earth Spirit Art,' which made her somewhat useful, she would still be stuck doing menial tasks.  

Comparing Li Shiming’s progress to that of his peers, the gap was staggering. Either he was exceptionally talented or had powerful backing—either way, Senior Brother Cheng couldn’t afford to offend him.  

Hearing that Li Shiming’s cave was near the cliff, he realized that Li Shiming’s status was far from ordinary.  

That cave was connected to a mid-grade spiritual vein, which was typically reserved for either geniuses at the ninth layer of Qi Refinement with potential to reach Foundation Establishment or actual Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

For Li Shiming, only at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement, to occupy such a cave meant he was no ordinary disciple. Senior Brother Cheng no longer dared to stay silent, fearing he might inadvertently provoke Li Shiming.  

"Senior Brother Cheng, you’re too kind. Junior Sister Jin and I both hail from Great Xia—I hope you’ll look out for her," Li Shiming said with a smile.  

"Of course!" Senior Brother Cheng replied eagerly, delighted at the opportunity to establish a connection with Li Shiming.  

Perhaps, with further interaction, they could even become friends.  

Jin Fengzhi, however, felt conflicted. Hearing Senior Brother Cheng address Li Shiming as "Senior Brother" made her realize that Li Shiming’s strength was at least on par with his.  

And for Senior Brother Cheng, an intermediate spiritual farmer, to be so deferential suggested that Li Shiming’s cave was something extraordinary.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Li. Our batch would like to invite you for a gathering sometime," Jin Fengzhi said with a bow.  

"Certainly. Just send a message to my cave. Though it’s temporary, I’ll be there every day," Li Shiming agreed with a smile.  

Though none of his batchmates stood out, they still shared a bond.  

Moreover, these disciples had come from the mortal world. If they failed to progress in the cultivation world, many would likely return to secular life.  

While they might be the weakest here, back in the mortal world, their influence would be immense.  

Though cultivating the 'Five Elements Absorption Art' required him to be in the Xun Peak cave, adjusting his training schedule minimized the inconvenience.  

Every afternoon, Li Shiming would go to the cave to cultivate. With the mid-grade spiritual vein’s energy supply, he was confident his progress would meet expectations.  

He and his doppelganger sat in the cultivation chamber, the spiritual vein’s energy outlet right behind them, surrounded by a spirit-gathering formation.  

A mid-grade spiritual vein could support Foundation Establishment cultivators, so sustaining two Qi Refinement cultivators was effortless.  

The doppelganger cultivated the 'Five Elements Absorption Art' at the maximum speed of a Heaven spiritual root (100), while Li Shiming’s main body maintained the same peak efficiency.  

However, after one session, Li Shiming realized his actual progress far exceeded the theoretical value.  

Theoretically, his main body’s cultivation speed should have been 50, but the actual effect was much higher.  

He then noticed something he had overlooked before—the cultivation speed of a peak Qi Refinement cultivator couldn’t be measured by the same standard as that of a fifth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Previously, the lack of sufficient spiritual energy had obscured this fact. Now, with abundant energy, the rapid increase in his main body’s spiritual power made it evident.  

This was excellent news—it meant his cultivation speed wouldn’t just surpass that of Heaven spiritual root geniuses but would also allow him to catch up to his doppelganger’s level sooner.  

As for the doppelganger’s advancement to Foundation Establishment, he had long since changed his mind. He would only consider it once his main body reached peak Qi Refinement.  

After finishing cultivation, he stored the doppelganger in the computer room space.  

As he left the cultivation chamber, he noticed a message talisman floating within the defensive formation.  

It was from Jin Fengzhi, inviting him to a gathering at another cave dwelling.  

The cave was located at the foot of the mountain, indistinguishable from the others in the same standardized layout.  

These caves were assigned to early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, all sharing a single spiritual
