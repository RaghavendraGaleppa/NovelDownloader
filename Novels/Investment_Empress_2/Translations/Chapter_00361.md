# Chapter 361: Fortunately, No Lives Were Lost

“Ah, what could I possibly teach him? The boy is just talented on his own.”

“When he was little, he was physically weak. I thought about sending him to the Qingyuan Sect to build up his health. Who would’ve thought that, in the blink of an eye, he became a Crouching Dragon, far surpassing his old man.”

Surrounded by relatives like a star surrounded by planets, Li Dalong spoke with a modest tone while showing off. His hands waved dismissively, but the wrinkles on his face bloomed like flowers.

Actually, Brother Dalong felt a bit guilty.

After all, he didn’t even know that his son and Little Bing’er had made the Crouching Dragon List. It wasn’t until the County Magistrate rushed out the next morning to personally hold the reins of his horse that he found out after making some inquiries.

Truly awesome.

Old Li was in high spirits when, suddenly, the surroundings fell silent, and someone pinched his waist.

He looked up.

“Oh, son, you’re finally back.”

“The pride of the Li family has returned. Quick, quick, take a seat.”

“You’ve rendered such great merit in the Southern Frontier. The Emperor must surely reward you, right? How much money will that be?”

“That’s enough to be ennobled as a Marquis, at least!”

The whole family was beaming with praise. It felt a bit different, yet somehow the same.

Last year when the family gathered, he was still frail and sickly, and his uncles and aunts were also smiling and praising him to the skies—just the content of the praise had changed.

Even though Little Li had become a霸王 (Overlord), he was someone who had seen the big scene now.

But facing the praise of friends and relatives, he still felt that familiar urge to curl his toes.

Li Mo and Ying Bing sat down, one next to Li Dalong, the other next to Gu Xueqin.

In front of friends and relatives, the two of them became much more well-behaved, seemingly returning to the distant, indifferent relationship they had before entering the Qingyuan Sect.

After all, so many people were watching.

He lowered his voice and asked, “Dad, it’s not even New Year yet. Why are all the uncles, aunts, and uncles here?”

“They’re here to fish for information,” Li Dalong said quietly, without changing his expression.

Li Mo was confused. What information?

“Don’t you know what they call you on the Crouching Dragon List?”

“‘Divine Hammer Little...’ ‘Wife-Boosting Fighting Soul’?”

“If you know, then why are you asking?” Li Dalong raised his wine cup and drank with his granduncle.

“......”

Li Mo’s fist clenched so hard it creaked.

Who said the Qingyuan Sect’s Best Actor didn’t have any rivals? Huh?

The Yantian Sect! Just you wait until I turn the tables on you.

Once he and Ying Bing took their seats, the atmosphere grew even more enthusiastic. Since Ying Bing had been an ice cube since she was little, cold and aloof, no one went to provoke her.

All the firepower was directed at Little Li.

Seeing the two of them sitting together, so proper and formal, and remembering that they used to have conflicts, the aunt squinted her eyes and smiled as she asked, seeing that they didn’t look like anything was wrong:

“Little Mo, you’re at this age now. Haven’t you found a wife yet?”

It was very common in the Great Yu Dynasty to get married at sixteen.

*CREAK—*

Huh?

The aunt had just finished asking when she looked at the side in confusion. What was making such a loud noise?

“My parents are deeply in love, so I also advocate for free love. I don’t go for that arranged marriage stuff.”

Li Mo sat up straight, his face serious.

Second Uncle Li Xiaolong coughed lightly and said:

“Free love is good. If you ever get the idea, tell Second Uncle. Some of my colleagues have daughters who are very pretty. As a concubine, they’d be presentable enough.”

*CREAK!*

“...I haven’t even taken a wife yet. What concubine...”

Li Mo’s expression changed slightly, waving his hands repeatedly.

It was the granduncle who was sharp-eyed. He squinted at the training uniforms they were both wearing:

“Let’s not worry about the young ones’ business. Little Mo and Little Bing’er, these two kids, are surely single-mindedly focused on the Path of Martial Arts. In the future, they’ll be competing for the number one spot on the Crouching Dragon List. Do we need to arrange anything for them?”

Li Mo nodded, indicating that the granduncle was right.

He, Li Mo, was single-mindedly devoted to the Martial Dao.

Tonight, he even planned to ask the ice cube for guidance all night on how to project his consciousness to the Golden Crow. His heart seeking the Dao needed no explanation.

---

Who would have thought that the granduncle took another drink of wine, stroked his beard, and said:

“Then again...”

“You two little ones made it onto the Crouching Dragon List and can still be together. That’s great. Working together and making progress together is also a fine story.”

“......”

Li Mo’s eyelid twitched.

Damn it, I forgot to change when I got back.

“Hey, that’s right. The clothes you two are wearing are quite a match,” Li Dalong said, his face beaming.

“Training uniforms. These are the training uniforms the sect customized for me and Ying Bing.”

“Why are the standardized uniforms one black and one white, with different styles?”

Faced with this soul-searching question, Little Li was momentarily speechless.

“I’m going to rest.”

Ying Bing glanced at Li Mo, then stood up and walked back to her room.

“Son, what happened in the Southern Frontier?”

Gu Xueqin changed the subject. She had been worried for a long time. Seeing her son return safe and sound, she still felt a sense of relief, as if surviving a disaster.

Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief and recounted some of what he saw and heard in the Southern Frontier, picking only what he could tell.

After a few rounds of drinks, he also made his apologies and got up to leave the table.

He subconsciously walked towards the wing room, then retracted his steps and corrected his path, heading to his own bedroom.

The ice cube was at home, of course, and wouldn’t be living in the same room with him.

They could only temporarily ‘go their separate ways.’

The friends and relatives watched as the two each went to their own rooms, looking at each other in dismay. It was hard to imagine these two ending up together.

The main reason was Ying Bing. The child was beautiful, yes, but too frosty. When she was brought home as a child, people thought she was a mute who couldn’t speak.

But when her eyes looked at you, it made you feel like Lady Mengpo had added a lot of water to the soup she gave her.

“Aren’t these two little enemies?” the aunt asked, a bit puzzled.

The granduncle watched Li Mo return to his room, raised an eyebrow:

“Heh, isn’t being enemies a good thing? In the future, you all should stop worrying about these two kids’ business.”

Little Bing’er’s personality—if she doesn’t take a liking to someone, who can get close to her?

If they couldn’t even speak to each other, could they be enemies?

The word ‘unique’ is what’s special.

The aunts, second uncles, and other friends and relatives really did feel like these two kids didn’t seem to have anything going on, but since the granduncle had spoken, they just nodded.

For example, the second uncle, it was because his superior had mentioned the matter several times that he came to convey the message.

Friends and relatives took their leave one after another, and the main hall became quiet again.

Li Dalong watched the two kids go to different rooms, smacked his lips, and finally put his heart at ease.

He and Gu Xueqin were both a bit worried.

Little Bing’er looked like she was still that cold and aloof person, but invisibly, she was indeed a bit different. The other friends and relatives couldn’t detect it, but the couple who had watched her grow up had a sixth sense about it.

This time they returned, that feeling was even stronger.

Fortunately, the two of them hadn’t reached the point of sleeping in the same room.

They weren’t married yet. What if they caused a life to be lost...?

Old Li and his wife exchanged a glance. Although they were relieved, they felt a bit empty inside.

“Wife, where’s the dictionary and the reading glasses? Get them for me.”

“What for?”

“I’m going to pick a good character in advance, so it’ll be convenient to pick a name later...”

“You’d better not.”

Gu Xueqin rolled her eyes at him.

Little Mo is fine, just a bit mischievous. The private school teacher who sent him home even said the boy is smart, but he just can’t discipline him.

Li Dalong?

This is the kind of guy who, after the teacher taught him eight times, could still recite ‘人有所操’ (a man has his principles) as ‘操所有人’ (f*** everyone).

Oh right, father and son had the same private school teacher.
