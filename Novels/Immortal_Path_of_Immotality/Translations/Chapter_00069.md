# Chapter 69: Sect's Divine Ability

Lin Shan rubbed his forehead with a sigh. "You know as well as I do how expensive housing is in Yichuan City these days. The cheapest rents are ten spirit stones per month, and the central district costs thirty! Life isn't easy!"

The middle-aged stall owner mumbled, "You could always live in the suburbs—two spirit stones a month..."

Lin Shan appealed to his emotions, "Bandit attacks are frequent on the outskirts of Yichuan Market, and most victims end up dead without a proper burial. I have powerful enemies waiting outside, and with my current financial situation, I might not even make it back to my hometown in the mortal world. My life depends on your kindness!"

Tears welled up in the stall owner's eyes as he replied, "I risked my life to steal these talismans from my uncle's trash bin. If my clan finds out, I could be exiled or even have my cultivation crippled! I'm risking everything to make a living too!"

After a lengthy back-and-forth, neither could convince the other. Lin Shan finally gave up haggling. "I'll buy the first one for five spirit stones, and the rest at half price."

The stall owner agreed. Since his merchandise cost him nothing, he had been unwilling to lower the price when he noticed Lin Shan's keen interest in the Mind-Calming Talisman. But to keep a returning customer, he was willing to offer discounts on subsequent purchases.

Lin Shan picked out a Bloodburn Talisman and an Invisibility Talisman, along with the Mind-Calming Talisman, totaling ten spirit stones. The stall owner threw in a stack of Healing Talismans as a free bonus.

Back on the street, Lin Shan examined his new acquisitions.

**[Invisibility Talisman]**  
Grade: Low-tier  
Description: Conceals the user's form but not their aura. Can be detected by spiritual sight or divine sense.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

Lin Shan immediately thought of the Aura-Concealing Talisman he had bought earlier. Combining the two—one for invisibility and the other for masking his aura—would mimic the effect of a high-tier Stealth Talisman. While it wouldn't fool a Foundation Establishment cultivator's divine sense, it should suffice against Qi Condensation practitioners.

Next, he checked the other talisman:

**[Bloodburn Talisman]**  
Grade: Low-tier  
Description: Burns the user's essence blood to temporarily boost speed.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

The stall owner had explained that the Bloodburn Talisman was derived from the mid-tier Bloodburn Technique, which itself was a simplified version of the Blood Escape Technique—a last-ditch method for fleeing danger. With the Windriding Technique and this talisman, Lin Shan could dramatically increase his escape speed, significantly improving his chances of survival.

As for the other talismans, like the Hungry Ghost Summoning or Beast Summoning Talismans, they were low-tier and could only summon early Qi Condensation entities for a limited number of uses, making them less valuable.

Passing another stall, Lin Shan noticed rows of jade slips laid out on the ground—likely containing spell techniques. The slips appeared freshly copied, suggesting the seller had connections to a reputable source.

He picked them up one by one, pressing them to his forehead to scan with his divine sense. Each slip had protective restrictions, revealing only snippets of content to potential buyers. But with his enhancement panel, Lin Shan wasn't worried about being deceived.

After browsing, he found three wind-based spells that caught his interest.

**[Hurricane Technique]**  
Grade: Mid-tier  
Description: A wind-based offensive spell that summons a hurricane to devastate a wide area.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

**[Windwall Technique]**  
Grade: Mid-tier  
Description: A wind-based defensive spell that conjures a barrier to block physical and magical attacks.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

**[Windglide Technique]**  
Grade: Mid-tier  
Description: A wind-based movement spell allowing brief low-altitude gliding, with a maximum height of 15 meters.  
Enhancement Cost: 16 points  

The stall owner claimed these mid-tier spells usually sold for 30 spirit stones, but he was offering them for 25, as they were secretly copied from his Foundation Establishment uncle's shop. He assured Lin Shan of their quality and legitimacy.

Lin Shan nodded. Wind-based spells were rare and more expensive than basic elemental spells. Having checked prices in the shop district the previous day, he knew 25 spirit stones was a bargain.

He couldn't help but find it amusing how every stall owner seemed to have a well-connected relative—uncles for talismans, uncles for spells. What were ordinary rogue cultivators supposed to do?

But that wasn't his concern. With only 55 spirit stones left—enough for renting a cave dwelling—he could afford just one spell. The Windglide Technique tempted him as an advanced version of the Windriding Technique, albeit a downgraded form of the Flight Technique. However, compared to offensive and defensive options, he ultimately chose the Hurricane Technique.

His current defenses included the Water Veil Talisman and Mind-Calming Talisman, while escape options were covered by the Windriding Technique and Bloodburn Talisman. His concealment needs were met with the Aura-Concealing and Invisibility Talismans. The only gap was offensive versatility—aside from his Cold Iron Sword, he only had the basic Wind Blade Technique.

Prioritizing a broader arsenal, Lin Shan spent 25 spirit stones on the Hurricane Technique, leaving him with just 30 for lodging.

After browsing other stalls without finding anything of interest—or having the funds to spare—Lin Shan nearly moved on. But as he passed an elderly woman's stall cluttered with miscellaneous items, his fingers brushed against a straw doll-like object, triggering a rare prompt from his enhancement panel.

**[Nailhead Seven Arrows Art]**  
Grade: Divine Ability  
Description: A simplified version of the immortal technique "Nailhead Seven Arrows Art." A curse-type divine ability, one of the signature techniques of the "Witchcraft Sect," a major immortal cultivation sect.  
Usage: Requires a straw doll, bow and arrows, and two lamps. Place an item, blood, or hair carrying the target's aura before the doll, then perform the curse ritual by shooting arrows into the doll to inflict long-range damage. (Limited to three uses per day.)  
Note: The target's cultivation must not exceed the caster's by one major realm, or backlash will occur.  
Enhancement Cost: 128 points  
Ancient Aura: 12 points  
Absorb?  

Lin Shan's heart raced as he read the panel's description.  
"*What is this? A jackpot?!*"  
"*This straw doll is the Nailhead Seven Arrows Art? A divine ability? How do I cultivate it? Is the method hidden inside the doll?*"  
"*Twelve points of Ancient Aura! No wonder it's a sect's signature technique. Has it accumulated faith and fortune from generations of disciples?*"  
"*Where is the Witchcraft Sect? Never heard of it in Great Song. Will there be consequences for learning their secret technique?*"  

Questions flooded his mind, but now wasn't the time for answers. No matter the cost, he had to buy it. Cave dwellings could wait—this was a divine ability!  

Suppressing his excitement, Lin Shan feigned casual curiosity and turned to the elderly stall owner. "What is this, fellow cultivator?"  

The old woman replied coldly, "No idea. It's black-market goods. Ten spirit stones if you want it."  

Recognizing the woman's late Qi Condensation cultivation and the faint killing intent around her, Lin Shan guessed she had looted the item from one of her victims. Clearly, she didn't know its true value—not everyone had an enhancement panel for identification. She likely thought it was just an oddity or hoped to swindle him.  

But this woman was a hardened killer, making bargaining tricky. Still, he had to secure it.  

Just then, a cold female voice interrupted.  

"Ten spirit stones. I'll take the doll."  

Lin Shan whirled around.  

"Princess Guo!"
