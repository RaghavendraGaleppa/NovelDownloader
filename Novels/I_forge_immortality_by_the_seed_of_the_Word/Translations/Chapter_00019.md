# Chapter 19: Breaking Through to Qi Refinement Realm, First Attempt at Magic

As they drew closer to the small courtyard, Ji Bochang walked ahead, hunched over and tiptoeing as if afraid of startling Wu Mingyuan away. Zhang Jing followed behind with a dark expression.

This guy must have read too many storybooks and gotten too deep into the role—otherwise, he wouldn't be acting in such an incomprehensible manner.

Speaking of which, how did Ji Bochang manage to find a wealthy senior sister for dual cultivation right after entering the sect? Zhang Jing found it hard to imagine. Was it love at first sight? Logically, that shouldn't be the case. They were all cultivators, if not aiming for immortality, at least destined to live longer than mortals. Choosing a cultivation partner should be a careful decision.

Unfathomable! Truly unfathomable!

Just as Zhang Jing was lost in thought, Ji Bochang's hushed reminder reached his ears, and his footsteps halted.

"Brother Zhang, listen!" Ji Bochang pointed to the courtyard ahead with an enigmatic expression, as if witnessing a grand drama.

Listen to what?!

Zhang Jing was momentarily stunned before instinctively pricking up his ears and holding his breath to listen.

Though he hadn't yet reached the Qi Refinement Realm like Ji Bochang, his body had undergone continuous transformation during this time, and his hearing far surpassed that of ordinary mortals. He could easily catch the faint voices carried by the wind.

"Lingyun, is there really no chance?" The voice carried a trace of hope.

Zhang Jing recognized it immediately as Wu Mingyuan's.

Before he could ponder further, a soft, melodious voice tinged with a hint of coquetry but filled with finality followed.

"Brother Wu, you're a good person, but please don't say such things again. I wouldn't want Senior Brother Chen to misunderstand."

"Senior Brother Chen? Who is he?" Wu Mingyuan's voice was thick with reluctance.

"Brother Wu, Fairy Chu is referring to Senior Brother Chen Xiandao, one of the two monstrous talents who received the highest grade in this assessment," another voice interjected.

"Him?! No wonder Lingyun would choose him."

"You've misunderstood. Senior Brother Chen Xiandao is solely devoted to the Great Dao and doesn't even know—"

"Hey—Deng An, why are you bringing this up?" Chu Lingyun's voice, tinged with embarrassment, cut in sharply.

A heavy silence fell in the room, followed by a resigned sigh.

"I understand, Lingyun. You want to catch up to him. I happen to have some spirit pills and spirit stones sent from home that might help a little."

Hearing this, Zhang Jing and Ji Bochang exchanged glances outside, both seeing a trace of speechlessness in each other's eyes.

Wait, spirit stones?!

They suddenly realized and hurriedly dashed toward the courtyard. Wu Mingyuan might be generous, but they hoped he hadn't given away all his spirit stones—at least leaving behind the fifty they'd bet.

Soon, in the reception room:

Chu Lingyun and Ji Bochang sat at the head of the room, their expressions composed. Zhang Jing and Deng An sat opposite each other in the secondary seats, while Wu Mingyuan sat at the lowest position, his face a mix of sorrow and awkwardness.

Perhaps because the door was left open, a cold breeze swept in, shattering the silence.

Wu Mingyuan shivered involuntarily.

Strange—why was the wind so biting today?

"Brother Wu," Ji Bochang set down his teacup and looked at Wu Mingyuan. "Have you forgotten something? Like a certain bet?"

At these words, Wu Mingyuan felt the wind grow even colder.

After a moment's hesitation, he stood up and produced a small pouch from his sleeve, placing it on Ji Bochang's table.

"Brother Ji, you jest. How could I forget? I had it prepared long ago, but I've been busy lately, hence the delay."

"Brother Wu is indeed trustworthy!" Ji Bochang weighed the pouch in his hand and smiled.

Seeing Ji Bochang's unabashed action, Wu Mingyuan's face first flashed with anger, but remembering the difference in their current statuses, he swallowed his rage.

"Thank you for your praise, Brother Ji."

With that, Wu Mingyuan took out another identical pouch and placed it on the table beside Zhang Jing.

Meeting Zhang Jing's astonished gaze, he said apologetically, "Brother Zhang, I was young and impulsive to have wagered on your assessment results. I sincerely apologize. Please accept these spirit stones as a token of my regret."

As he spoke, Wu Mingyuan felt a surge of bitterness. But he knew this was necessary—Zhang Jing, as a top-tier talent, would likely join one of the top thirty mission squads after the assessment. It was best not to offend him.

Reading the flickering emotions on Wu Mingyuan's face, Zhang Jing could guess his thoughts—resentment, frustration, or unwillingness. But what did it matter?

He didn't care.

Still, it wouldn't do to rebuff a polite gesture.

Zhang Jing didn't even glance at the spirit stones on the table. Instead, he smiled and nodded at Wu Mingyuan. "Brother Wu is too kind. It was just a jest—nothing serious."

Hearing this and seeing Zhang Jing's reaction, Wu Mingyuan immediately expressed his gratitude. "Thank you for your understanding, Brother Zhang."

Then, he stole a glance at Ji Bochang, finding him increasingly detestable.

Once Wu Mingyuan returned to his seat, Chu Lingyun stood up, her eyes gleaming. "Today, it seems fate has brought us all from the Seventh Provisional Courtyard together again."

Zhang Jing and Ji Bochang looked up, waiting for her to continue.

"First, I must congratulate Brother Zhang for earning a top-tier assessment through sheer talent. Truly remarkable—I'm in awe."

"You flatter me, Fairy Chu," Zhang Jing replied with a faint smile, though inwardly, he grew wary.

"Brother Zhang, have you joined any mission squad yet?"

"Not yet."

Chu Lingyun's eyes lit up. "Perhaps you're unaware, but I have a cousin in the Lianshan Squad, ranked nineteenth in the outer sect, at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement. Why not join them, like Deng An and I have? Since we're from the same region, we can support each other, and with my cousin's guidance, your cultivation path will be much smoother."

Zhang Jing met her expectant gaze until she grew slightly uncomfortable before asking with a smile, "Fairy Chu, if I join the Lianshan Squad, would I still need to hand over thirty percent of my mission merits?"

"Brother Zhang, naturally. Everyone does—no exceptions." Chu Lingyun covered her mouth with a light laugh.

Inwardly, she added: Except for me, of course!

"Indeed, Brother Zhang," Deng An chimed in. "Thirty percent isn't much. Time flies in cultivation—just endure it for five years. The Lianshan Squad is ranked nineteenth. Without Fairy Chu's efforts, we wouldn't even have this opportunity."

"In a few days, I'll break through to Qi Refinement. If you hesitate any longer, Brother Zhang, your cultivation will fall far behind ours."

"Thank you both for your kindness. I'll consider it further," Zhang Jing declined politely.

As Chu Lingyun and Deng An opened their mouths to persuade him further, Ji Bochang interrupted, "Apologies, but Brother Zhang and I have matters to attend to. We'll take our leave now."

He winked at Zhang Jing, who took the hint and stood to bid farewell.

Soon, only three remained in the room.

"Brother Zhang, coming from a mortal background, has limited vision," Deng An sighed. "He only sees the thirty percent deduction but fails to realize the protection and resources a squad provides—far beyond what those merits are worth."

"Let it be," Chu Lingyun said calmly. "We've done our part."

"Once Brother Zhang ventures into the outer sect alone and completes a mission, he'll understand the benefits of joining a squad."

On their way back:

"Who knew Chu Lingyun would reach Qi Refinement so quickly? By the way, Brother Zhang, you still haven't joined a squad?" Ji Bochang asked curiously.

He'd seen several senior brothers from mission squads approach Zhang Jing and assumed he'd chosen one. To his surprise, Zhang Jing had declined them all.

Zhang Jing exhaled deeply. "Brother Ji, these squads demand thirty percent of my merits for five years. I need to think carefully."

"Have you joined one? Did you have to agree to their terms?"

Ji Bochang grinned proudly. "Brother Zhang, I joined the Five Colors Squad where my senior sister is. Aside from the top ten behemoths in the outer sect, the Five Colors Squad is among the strongest. And as for merit deductions—thanks to my senior sister, there are none!"

Zhang Jing was utterly dumbfounded. He stared at Ji Bochang, trying to discern what charm he possessed to win over such a senior sister.

Before parting:

"Brother Zhang, we'll leave for the market at dawn tomorrow."

"Understood."

That night, in a certain cave abode:

Spiritual energy condensed into a faint mist, shrouding the space in an ethereal haze.

"Senior Sister, is the Five Colors Squad still recruiting?" Ji Bochang's voice rang out.

"Oh? Do you have someone to recommend?" came the languid reply.

"A close friend of mine also received a top-tier assessment—exceptionally talented. Could you recruit him into our squad? And perhaps waive the thirty percent merit deduction?"

"Letting him join is no issue—his talent meets our standards. But the merit deduction..." The senior sister hesitated. "This rule has stood for nearly a millennium. I can't break it again. How about this: ask if he'd accept twenty percent? That way, it's manageable..."

Meanwhile, in a cultivation chamber:

Zhang Jing sat with his eyes closed, brows occasionally furrowing, steam rising from his head. He had reached the critical moment of his breakthrough.

Success would elevate him to the Qi Refinement Realm, granting him the abilities of a true cultivator. Failure? There was no risk—this step was a natural progression.

Zhang Jing focused his spirit sense throughout his body, monitoring every minute change. Spiritual energy coursed through him along the pathways of the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method, accelerating steadily. His body's transformation reached a tipping point under the energy's saturation.

Then—boom!

A deafening roar seemed to echo in his ears.

Every fiber of his being rejoiced, celebrating this moment.

In the dim chamber, Zhang Jing opened his eyes.

Now, even without his spirit sense, his naked eyes could perceive the spiritual energy swirling around him. Every detail in the room—dust, insects—was vividly clear, as if he'd activated a rudimentary version of his Mind's Eye seed.

Inside his body, near his dantian, spiritual energy gathered chaotically, compressing and radiating intense pressure.

At the same time, the Gathering Origin Spiritual Light at his dantian's core flared brilliantly, its radiance piercing through to illuminate the turbulent energy.

Time seemed to freeze.

A wisp of pure white emerged at the chaos's center—true spiritual power!

The moment it appeared, the surrounding energy surged toward it, merging seamlessly.

"Spiritual power... Qi Refinement Realm!" Zhang Jing murmured. "I've waited so long for this."

Within breaths, the wisp had absorbed all his spiritual energy.

Suppressing his excitement, Zhang Jing recalled the low-grade offensive spell, Frostblade Manifestation, from the Five Viscera Water Origin Scripture. He'd practiced its intricate spell patterns with his spirit sense for days in preparation.

Channeling his spirit sense, he deftly wove the complex spell patterns, this time infusing them with genuine spiritual power.

Soon, a crescent-shaped icy blade materialized in his palm, its chilling aura dropping the room's temperature sharply.

"Go!" Zhang Jing commanded inwardly.

The blade shot forth, a barely visible streak that pierced through the two-foot-thick stone wall before dissipating.

Zhang Jing examined the wall—a foot-long gash, edges smooth, frost creeping outward.

He inhaled sharply. The wall, hard as steel, had been sliced like tofu. What would this do to a human body?

Then an idea struck him: What if he infused the Frostblade Manifestation with the Dark Serpent Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme?

No sooner thought than done.

Thirty seconds later, another deadly blade formed in his hand. With a thought, the incomplete Dao Rhyme surged into it.

The blade trembled violently, as if alive—a serpentine force threatening to break free.

Zhang Jing released it toward the wall.

A streak of brutal light shot forth, faster than before, voraciously devouring ambient spiritual energy mid-flight.
