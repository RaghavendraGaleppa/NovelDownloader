# Chapter 191: An Arrow Breaks the Momentum, Beautiful Eyes Glimmer

Fortune, or luck, is a mysterious force. It is invisible yet ever-flowing. The world's fortune is finite, having flowed through the bodies of countless heroes and talents over the centuries.

Scholars seize fortune with literary energy.

Martial artists, however, have never been favored by fortune. This is because martial men often act without regard for "reason." Zhou Shijie, fortunate to have inherited a sliver of his father's fortune despite being a martial artist, entered the Qiong Tian Mansion Institute and cultivated diligently. He practiced martial arts and studied literature simultaneously, surpassing his peers.

Now, facing the elders and experts from various clans, he remained calm and composed. His words were sharp, his arguments clear, leaving others speechless.

Zhou Shijie thought to himself, "A golden carp appears only once in a blue moon. My fortune is thin, and my leverage is fragile. Yet... I cannot let this opportunity pass."

His poise and grace were truly extraordinary.

Ouyezi's expression changed, his eyes darting as his mind raced.

"A golden carp holding a pearl... The pearl is the most precious part. I have already received my share. It is a pity I cannot get the pearl itself, but my harvest is already substantial."

"Furthermore... I recently forged a precious artifact for a certain person on the [List of Hundred Beauties]. She paid me in advance with rare treasures, some of which I have already consumed, ensuring the forging's success."

"I came to the mansion city because I heard that Ice Jade Silkworm Silk was here sold sold.."

 ", his fortune is thin. If they were to oppose him with determination, he would be helpless."

"My words now must seem fair. I must make the great clans feel they have a chance at the pearl, while also creating space for myself to争取 a chance."

Zhou Shijie's mind was made up. He lightly fanned his folding fan and said, "Thank you, elders, for listening to this junior. The affairs of the world are all about reason."

"I have an idea."

"How about this? The distribution agreed upon by the elders remains unchanged. The golden carp swims with incredible speed. Let the figures from our Celestial Pavilion take on the task of capturing it."

"Whoever catches the golden carp gets its pearl. The rest will be divided among the five parties. What do you all think?"

The elders exchanged glances, their expressions showing approval. They secretly praised Zhou Shijie for living up to his reputation on the Hero List. His martial prowess was formidable, and his ability to assess the situation was equally commendable.

His actions were, of course, a scheme to ensure the pearl fell into his hands. However, by inviting the prodigies of the Celestial Pavilion to participate, he did not completely extinguish the clans' hopes of obtaining the pearl. Moreover, by forming an alliance with the families from Qiong Tian Mansion, he intended to resist Ouyezi, ensuring the smith had no share at all. In just a few words, he had hidden many calculations.

Given this, how could the great clans disagree? They immediately voiced their opinions in agreement.

Ouyezi spat and said, "Tch! And here I am, having this brat take a share from me, and I can do nothing about it."

In a distant pavilion.

Gu Nianjun praised, "He is masterful in his maneuvering. This Zhou Shijie possesses both literary and martial talents. His speech was truly brilliant. In my opinion, it is even more dazzling than a peak-level foundational martial art."

A man should have a spirit to stand tall and firm, and composure in the face of danger. Li Xian is brilliant, but he has only faced peers of the same generation. That is nothing to boast of. Zhou Shijie, however, maneuvered against the mansion's powerful figures and the master smith. That is truly praiseworthy.

Zhou Shijie said to the crowd, "Everyone, you have heard it. I have secured a chance for you all. There is no need to thank me. Go and seize your own opportunities!"

"Indeed..."

"In this contest, you may all display your skills without restraint. You are not limited to foundational martial arts, such as fists, legs, or hand techniques."

His words carried a hidden meaning. Seated high in his position, he had heard of Li Xian's ascent up the tower, continuously revealing peak-level foundational martial arts. He knew a confrontation was inevitable. His own martial talent was also high, and under the tutelage of a great teacher, he had perfected four foundational martial arts: Sky Eagle Claw, Coiling Earth Leg, Dragon Spine Fist, and Iron Ring Fan.

However, he calculated that he would struggle to defeat Li Xian's three sets of peak-level foundational martial arts. If Li Xian were to challenge him for the top spot, he would surely lose.

He was restless.

Fortunately, this turn of events allowed him to regain control of the situation.

Previously, within the Celestial Pavilion, the prodigies were somewhat restrained. Now, with their shackles broken, all seventy-four young prodigies from the seven-story tower rushed out.

Lightness skill, martial arts, and various techniques were unleashed to their fullest as they tried to capture the golden carp. The carp fled in a panic, darting up and down with incredible speed.

The lake was several miles wide, quite vast. The golden carp could swim at any depth, moving freely through the water.

It was extremely difficult to catch.

But the carp was shrouded in golden light. Even when it dove to the bottom of the lake, its golden glow remained, constantly revealing its position. Over seventy prodigies moved like dragonflies skimming water or拍浪擒鱼...

The chase was intense.

This battle further showcased the unique styles of each participant. Martial arts displayed strange phenomena... hidden weapons, lightness skills, and even Transcendent-level martial arts...

Suddenly, a prodigy from the Cao clan spotted the golden carp swimming past him. Overjoyed, he executed the "Serpent Scale Hand." This was a Lower-tier martial art that required soaking in medicinal baths to cultivate "serpent scales" on one's hands.

His hands plunged into the water, reaching out at incredible speed, ignoring the water's resistance. Just as he was about to grab the carp, a massive wave suddenly struck, washing him into the lake.

Zhou Shijie held the "Sinking River Sword" and stepped on the rolling waves. His long sword poked, slashed, and lifted... He used the sword to execute the "Treading on Waves" skill.

Combining the Sinking River Sword's [Manipulating Water] trait, he casually sent waves several zhang high. The waves the Qi拍拍., him to沉沉沉 him湖 him him him him。

Ji Hongyan sighed, "Young Master Zhou's strength far surpasses ours."

Wang Kun said, "Without that Sinking River Sword, I could could be him. But now... He roams the lake like the like a tiger with wings. I... I even touch him him him him!"

 him!"

Luo Bu'er, climbed onto the the lake island, soaking wet. He hadn not the the carp, but had he had抓不少 grass fish. He watched Zhou Shij manipulating the great waves, was golden carp,, vortex,..

 the he couldn his head and said with emotion, "It has to be Zhou Shijie. He is the undisputed number one. His strength and grace are impeccable. Hey, that Li Xian shone for a moment earlier, but once the restraints were loosened, he immediately paled in comparison. He's probably even worse than me."

Hearing this, everyone thought, "Even if a foundational martial art has reached its peak, its effect is minimal in such a vast lake."

Wang Kun's pupils constricted. He cried out in shock, "He's done it! He's created a vortex... and trapped the golden carp!"

He then said with admiration, "I am no match for Brother Zhou. It seems... this golden carp is destined to be his."

He sat down on the ground to watch Zhou Shijie's performance. Luo Bu'er's mind raced, hoping to reap the benefits of others' labor. As Zhou Shijie trapped the golden carp, he suddenly activated his lightness skill and lunged for the carp.

With a "bang," Luo Bu'er was blasted away by a wave. He exclaimed in shock, "How can this wave have such power?"

Wang Kun said, "Did you really think that holding the Sinking River Sword would make it easy to trap the golden carp? The carp's speed is incredible. An ordinary water vortex would be broken by it in an instant."

"Brother Zhou's Qi is astonishing. He used the Sinking River Sword's trait to infuse his internal Qi into the lake's vortex. It looks like a lake wave, but in reality, every drop of water contains Brother Zhou's internal Qi."

"I am in awe, truly in awe. Barring any accidents, this golden carp is his."

Ouyezi, who was watching from the side, said, "This brat is indeed capable. His schemes and strength are both quite impressive. Letting him take a share doesn't seem so hard to accept after all."

"The other little ones, whether terms of wit or strength, are worlds apart from him..."

Before he could finish his sentence, a sharp whistling sound suddenly tore through the air. Immediately after, the vortex that Zhou Shijie had worked so hard to create exploded with a "boom," sending water splashing several zhang high.

The golden carp... flicked its tail and immediately escaped again.

"Who was that?"

Everyone was bewildered. Wang Kun, Cao Xiuxiu, Li Ruhu... and the other prodigies had all experienced the power of the lake waves. They were gentle like water, yet tenacious and unyielding.

The vortex had already formed, growing larger and larger. Not to mention the golden carp, even the prodigies themselves would find it difficult to escape if they were caught in the vortex.

"Was it an arrow?"

"Who broke the vortex with a single arrow?!"

A long arrow floated on the surface of the lake. The prodigies were filled with doubt and astonishment. An arrow that could raise giant waves, an arrow that could break a vortex. This arrow must have hit the very center of the vortex, and it contained...

Internal Qi comparable to Zhou Shijie's. That was the only way an arrow could disrupt the momentum of the vortex!

Everyone looked around, but saw no one holding a bow. When they looked up, they saw that the formidable captain, Li Xian, had already climbed to the top of the tower. He had dismantled his umbrella into a bow, using the ribs as arrows.

He drew the bow to its fullest...

An arrow broke the momentum!

Li Xian did not know lightness skill, so he was indeed inferior in capturing the carp in the lake. Thus, he played to his strengths, using his archery to contend.

He had seen Zhou Shijie execute the [Treading on Waves] skill, creating the lake waves. He knew it was Zhou Shijie who had been secretly opposing him when he was climbing the tower. He immediately returned the favor, drawing his bow and loosing an arrow in an instant.

When he shot his arrow, he possessed a unique grace, one of a kind in the world.

The arrow left the string. In that instant, everything fell into a profound silence.

Gu Nianjun stood up unconsciously.

Madam Wen sat with her legs crossed, her posture alluring. A complex mix of emotions—appreciation, joy, and pride—shimmered in her beautiful eyes. Her red lips parted as she said with pride, "He is my man. Who dares to compete with him?"
