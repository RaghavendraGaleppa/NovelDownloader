# Chapter 63: Martial Artist vs. Immortal

Soon, another month passed.

Inside the cave abode, Lü Yang sat cross-legged on a meditation mat. In his palm, a swirling mass of white qi surged. After a long time, Lü Yang gently tossed it outwards.

Boom!

Following a loud boom, the white qi rapidly expanded, reforming into a human shape, revealing a face identical to Lü Yang's. However, the aura emanating from it was completely different.

This was because the aura of Lü Yang's true body was ethereal and otherworldly, characteristic of a true immortal cultivator, possessing the Dao charm of superior true qi. In contrast, the Lü Yang formed from white qi before him exuded a monstrous blood qi, every movement seemingly weighing a thousand *jin*, and his handsome, square face held an air of natural authority, even without anger.

"Not bad, not bad!"

Looking at the 'Innate One Qi Incarnation' he had painstakingly refined for a month, Lü Yang nodded in satisfaction: "I never thought martial arts could be used this way..."

Generally speaking, an Innate One Qi Incarnation had no way to break through. This was because its essence was a mass of white qi, formless and unpredictable, making cultivation impossible, much like how Lü Yang's previous cultivation of the Demonic Blood-Transforming Divine Light had ultimately resulted in his body turning into a blood shadow.

However, martial arts changed all that. Without following the path of immortal cultivation, martial arts focused purely on nurturing and refining blood qi. This unexpectedly suited the Innate One Qi Incarnation perfectly, allowing it to break through the limitation of being unable to cultivate!

"Unfortunately, I still don't quite understand how to take the fourth step..."

At this moment, the 'Innate One Qi Incarnation' only possessed the strength of the third step of martial arts. Although Lü Yang had deduced the fourth step, he had never found the correct path. Therefore, for this outing, Lü Yang planned to go to Tianjing City first. He intended to meet Wang Boyuan, the 'Scholar of Sacred Heart,' who had pioneered the fourth step of martial arts, hoping to gain some inspiration from him.

"Let you go out and explore for me then."

With a thought from Lü Yang, the Innate One Qi Incarnation immediately dissolved on the spot, transforming into a streak of white qi that vanished into the horizon, flying towards Tianjing City.

"Finally, he moved!"

Almost simultaneously, within the Wei family mansion in Tianjing City, the already ten-year-old 'Wei Yun' suddenly looked up at the sky, a bright light flashing in his dark eyes.

However, the next second, he frowned again: "No, it's an incarnation..."

Seeing the divination result, the Old Ancestor of the Yun family immediately gnashed his teeth in anger. After waiting for ten years and expending great effort to manipulate karma, he had only managed to lure out an incarnation. Was that little devil truly not anxious at all?

The Demonic Sect had always emphasized brave and diligent advancement, yet suddenly, such a cautious old turtle appeared. For the first time, the Yun Family Old Ancestor felt it was troublesome. However, he quickly adjusted his plan: "If you send out an incarnation, I will find a way to destroy it. Let's see if your true body can still sit still!"

Of course, he wouldn't act personally; that would only alert the enemy. The best method was still to let the martial artists within the secret realm kill Lü Yang's incarnation. This would also allow them to learn the truth about the secret realm, inciting them to resist.

Naturally, the resistance would not succeed. The Yun Family Old Ancestor didn't care whether they succeeded. What was important was the process of resistance, to have these martial artists fight their way out of the secret realm – that was the true key. As long as they left the secret realm, even if they died, their souls would enter the cycle of reincarnation. Even if a Dao Lord acted, it would be impossible to capture them back. Although they would lose their lives, they would also gain freedom. Upon their reincarnation, these hundreds of millions of living souls would fill the great karmic net between heaven and earth, which for him, would be an immeasurable act of merit.

"Perfect, I can have that person make a move..."

Having thought this far, the Yun Family Old Ancestor immediately performed a magic incantation, manipulating karma.

"What secrets are hidden within this Heavenly Book?"

In the imperial palace of Tianjing City, Ji Xiongying, the 'Martial Pacification King' and one of the seven Martial Dao Heavenly Human experts of this era, frowned deeply as he examined a golden book before him.

The Heavenly Book had four volumes: Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism each held one. Legend had it that the last volume was lost among the common folk and disappeared without a trace. However, no one knew that the Great Zhou Imperial Family had secretly obtained it. It was precisely by relying on this Heavenly Book that Ji Xiongying was able to complete the three steps of martial arts by the age of thirty. Furthermore, after Wang Boyuan, the 'Scholar of Sacred Heart,' revealed the method for the fourth step of martial arts, Ji Xiongying independently created 'Power Over All Under Heaven', condensing the Great Zhou's national fortune to empower himself, and ultimately successfully broke through to become a Grandmaster of the Heavenly Human realm.

However, the more he delved into the Heavenly Book, the more worried he became.

"Where did the Heavenly Book come from?"

"Everything must have its origin. The Heavenly Book is so profound; if it was truly created by someone with intent, then it could only be a legendary immortal."

Upon this thought, boundless ambition suddenly arose within Ji Xiongying. Because even after achieving the Heavenly Human realm in martial arts, he discovered that his lifespan had not increased at all, remaining the same as an ordinary person's. How could he accept this?

"I want eternal life! I want to live ten thousand years!"

"I desire to become an immortal...!"

A hint of blood-red flashed in Ji Xiongying's eyes. His already strong desires were now deliberately provoked, and it was at this critical moment—

"Who's there!"

Suddenly, Ji Xiongying looked up. His 'Power Over All Under Heaven' allowed him to sense the changes in the entire Great Zhou's national fortune, and Tianjing City, the capital of Great Zhou, was practically his domain. At this moment, he detected a clear 'anomaly' invading his territory.

With a thought, the might of the entire nation instantly empowered Ji Xiongying. At this moment, it was as if hundreds of millions of Great Zhou citizens were lifting his body, allowing him to break through the martial artist's limitation of being unable to fly, soaring directly into the depths of the clouds.

Then, he saw a figure. The newcomer's robes fluttered, hovering in the air, with clouds rising beneath his feet, looking as ethereal as a deity. Only the gaze he directed at Ji Xiongying held a hint of surprise.

"You can actually fly?"

Lü Yang looked at the martial artist before him, calculated with his fingers, and immediately understood Ji Xiongying's identity: "So that's it, a Heavenly Human truly has broken through the martial arts shackles..."

Ji Xiongying likewise stared at Lü Yang, frowning: "Your qi is not condensed, your blood is not refined; only your spirit and intent are somewhat acceptable. It seems you are an unorthodox rogue cultivator, yet you can fly. Could it be that you've obtained some secret technique... Never mind. Once I capture you, I will naturally understand the whole story!"

Having spoken, Ji Xiongying directly attacked!

In the past, although he was domineering, he wouldn't act indiscriminately. However, at this moment, he was filled with anxiety due to his unfulfilled desires. Moreover, in his view, Lü Yang was not a Martial Dao Heavenly Human. If he wasn't a Heavenly Human, he had no right to converse with him as an equal. In that case, he might as well capture the opponent to vent some of the anger in his heart.

"Come here!"

The next second, Ji Xiongying moved, instantly appearing before Lü Yang. His five fingers reached for Lü Yang's neck, and the air currents at his fingertips let out a sharp screeching sound.

Lü Yang and Ji Xiongying were extremely close, so much so that Lü Yang could faintly hear a sound like a great river flowing from within Ji Xiongying's body – that was his surging blood qi. The sound of his beating heart was like a heavenly drum pounding. What kind of powerful physique could support such an immense blood qi?

"Definitely comparable to Great Perfection in Qi Refinement..."

Lü Yang was astonished. In terms of physical toughness alone, Ji Xiongying even surpassed his own Saint's Plunder at minor accomplishment, almost inhuman.

"But it seems that's all he has..."

Pfft!

The next second, blood splattered.

Ji Xiongying reeled back as if struck by a heavy blow, retreating rapidly. He looked at Lü Yang with extreme horror, while a 'white line' gradually dissipated between the two of them. It was this 'white line' that had just sliced through his palm.

"What kind of martial art is this?"

"Sword Qi Talisman."

Under Ji Xiongying's shocked gaze, Lü Yang smiled faintly, then pulled out a piece of yellow paper covered in incomprehensible scribbles, and then set it alight with a flick of fire—

Boom!

In an instant, Ji Xiongying felt an intense pain in his glabella, and the sword qi that had just torn through the flesh of his palm erupted from the burning talisman!

Beneath the brilliant sword qi, a bewildered face was reflected.

"W-what?!"
