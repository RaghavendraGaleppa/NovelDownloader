# Chapter 234: Crushing the Enemy with Utter Ease

Watching Xu Yunfan’s figure rapidly receding, his expression shifted unpredictably. It was a long while before he finally exhaled, his gaze turning toward the distant place where demonic aura permeated the air.

If he were to remain here alone, the chances of survival were too slim. He had previously competed with that elephant demon, yet he couldn't even withstand a single hammer strike from Xu Yunfan.

Heaven only knows when the demonic qi might once again obscure his mind.

Only by sticking close to Xu Yunfan could he grasp a sliver of hope.

He lowered his head to look at his demonic body. Having made his decision, he immediately strode forward without hesitation, following the trail Xu Yunfan had left behind.

When Xu Yunfan’s foot crushed the fifth mountain rock, his nasal cavity was already filled with the sweet, metallic scent of blood.

Through the vision granted by the ore-seeking art of Dragon Vein Discernment, the valley ahead churned with impure qi like boiling water, every wisp of malevolent energy entwined with fine, thread-like purple light.

Suddenly, the leaf-like scales of his dragon scale armor twitched as his muscles tensed. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength surged violently, akin to steel cables binding his waist and abdomen, forcing his body into a right-angle turn. He shifted several inches through the air, narrowly dodging the stark white bone spurs erupting from the ground.

*Crackle!*

The earth surface rolled like waves, and ancient trees within a hundred zhang radius toppled all at once.

The Nine-Ringed Xiangliu burrowed out from the earth's veins, the toxic miasma from its nine snake heads dyeing the morning mist a dark green.

The vertical pupils of the central head reflected Xu Yunfan's leaping figure. As its scales opened and closed, a sound akin to clashing metal rang out.

What a massive creature!

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted slightly, yet he showed not a trace of fear.

"Come!"

With a thunderous roar, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swung out in a赤金 (vermilion gold) full moon arc. Xu Yunfan’s spine arched like a taut serpent tendon, the mercury-like thick blood in his veins exploding with twelve strands of vermilion gold lightning.

The compressed qi force enveloping the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer hadn't even touched the snake head yet, but the玄铁 (titanium-steel) scale armor on the left side of the Xiangliu’s head had already caved in like a giant bowl.

Three of the snake heads suddenly twisted together into a spiral drill. Demonic aura condensed into a pitch-black cone, carrying with it a piercing sound of tearing silk as it slammed forward!

So fast!

Xu Yunfan hadn't expected at all that this giant snake with its terrifyingly massive body could unleash such incredible speed.

In the critical split second, Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and hips into a terrifying arc, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength surging from his feet into the earth's veins.

The rock layer within a few zhang radius exploded upwards. A shockwave akin to a ground dragon overturning deflected the suddenly arriving snake head cone by three inches.

However, the seventh snake head crept out bizarrely from underground. Its giant tail, covered in bone spurs, swept across like a meteor. The cliff face shattered and collapsed amidst the sparks spraying off the dragon scale armor.

*Boom!*

Caught off guard, Xu Yunfan was struck squarely by the giant tail. His entire body embedded into the hundred-zhang mountain like a cannonball. The rock crust on the cliff surface exploded layer by layer like brittle frosting.

The dragon scale armor leaves bristled layer by layer at the moment of impact to dissipate the force. The fascia network of the Hundred-Refined Steel Body writhed like a living thing, constantly vibrating.

Vermilion gold sparks flew as his body rubbed against the rock wall at high speed, drawing a meteor shower-like trail in the dust.

A muffled thunder-like tremor of muscles and bones echoed from within the mountain. Countless stones were pushed out into web-like cracks by his back.

Qi Huan, who had arrived late and stood in the distance, watched in horror as Xu Yunfan was heavily smashed by the snake tail. He saw Xu Yunfan, like a falling fireball, embed deeply into the mountain body, causing a deafening, terrifying commotion.

The entire battlefield fell into a sudden, dead silence.

The writhing nine-headed snake slowly lowered its body, wanting to get closer to confirm Xu Yunfan's life or death.

Just as the venom dripping from the Xiangliu’s fangs corroded the rock wall into smoke, the pile of rubble suddenly exploded into dust.

"Lin!"

A command like a morning bell or evening drum erupted from the shattered mountain. Xu Yunfan, wrapped in vermilion gold blood mist, burst out from the rocks.

The qi force around his body surged, combining with his Pure Yang internal energy to form a qi armor that pierced through the demonic miasma. The scales behind him flared, and the fierce, molten aura of the Swallowing Dragon Cudgel erupted like a volcanic eruption.

Nine molten dragon patterns lit up one after another on the cudgel's body. The Swallowing Dragon Cudgel trembled and hummed incessantly, but in the next instant, a powerful willpower was sent into the heavy cudgel through Xu Yunfan's palm, forcibly suppressing the divine weapon's backlash.

The vertical pupil of the Xiangliu’s main head contracted sharply. The other eight heads spat out their innate toxic fire, forming a heaven-wide net.

Xu Yunfan, however, charged upward against the falling rock blocks. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, driven to the Blood Transformation Realm, actually condensed into a solid form. Every step he took left a molten vermilion gold ripple in the air.

When the giant tail swept over again, he didn't dodge or evade. The Hundred-Refined Steel Body converted the impact force into potential energy for his spine, the Great Dragon.

*Clang!*

The explosive sound of metal colliding shattered three snake teeth. Xu Yunfan used the force to spin his body, the Swallowing Dragon Cudgel drawing nine blood-red crescents.

Seven layers of ring-shaped shockwaves exploded from the逆鳞 (reverse scale) area of the Xiangliu’s main head. In the 'Lin' state, the vital energy and blood within his body, carrying the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength capable of tearing through metal and iron, poured into the demonic skull through the cudgel tip.

The attribute panel suddenly flickered wildly in his vision. The nine heavy hidden forces shaken out by the Nine Profound亢龙 (High Dragon) Cudgel Technique in an instant perfectly fused with the fierce aura of the Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

"Break!"

With the thunderous roar, the flowing fire entwining the cudgel tip suddenly solidified like a blade.

At the instant the Xiangliu’s nine heads were severed simultaneously, Xu Yunfan’s five fingers hooked like claws into the eye socket of the main head. With a kick of his foot arch, the entire cliff face collapsed with a sound. The earth vein node where the Xiangliu had perched crumbled away.

The unbalanced demon let out a cry like a wailing infant. The remaining snake heads could only watch helplessly as Xu Yunfan ripped out a massive chunk of flesh along with the spinal dragon bone!

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained calm. His arm, which had swollen to a grotesque shape, quickly recovered. He seized the opportunity to close in, the hammer head precisely striking the seventh head's reverse scale.

The battle lasted until dusk.

When Xu Yunfan tore off the last piece of snake neck meat, the attribute panel suddenly floated with a stream of information alerts that almost filled the screen.

A glance showed that most of them were notifications of increased proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique.

The Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique proficiency surged by three hundred points. The rapidly increasing cultivation progress made his Hundred-Refined Steel Body take on a jade-like luster.

After exiting the 'Lin' state, he turned his head to look at Qi Huan, who stood on a nearby mountain peak with a horrified expression.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's gaze fall upon him, Qi Huan slowly walked closer. Looking at the silent, twenty-zhang-long body of the nine-headed snake at his feet, he looked as if his view of life was being challenged.

"This demon, if placed in the outside world, would be comparable to a master at the Marrow Cleansing realm."

"Indeed," Xu Yunfan said with deep emotion. "I had to use almost all my tricks just to barely kill this demon."

Qi Huan remained silent for a long time, his Adam's apple rolling with difficulty, his green-scaled knuckles digging deep into his palm.

He had thought that with his half-human, half-demon body and greatly increased strength, he could easily defeat, or even casually kill, the other. But now, he was merely stuck at the Outer Three Unifications, at best using his demonic body to clash hard with a Muscle Refining expert.

But look at Xu Yunfan now. Quietly stepping into the Blood Transformation Realm, wielding two divine weapons, capable of crossing realms to kill a demon comparable to the Marrow Cleansing realm.

When Xu Yunfan bent down to process the giant snake's flesh, Qi Huan's pupils contracted sharply.

On the youth's neck, the bulging veins that appeared intermittently carried a jade-like luster. Every breath brought about a clear, audible vibration of the heart and lungs. The Hundred-Refined Steel Body had clearly reached the phenomenon of 'Golden Muscle, Jade Bone'.
