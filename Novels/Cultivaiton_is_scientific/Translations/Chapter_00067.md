# Chapter 67: The Journey

"These are disciples recruited from other nations. You may sit here to cultivate or rest, but keep your voices down!" Senior Brother Ma instructed the group before turning specifically to Li Shiming. "Junior Brother Li, you'll take shifts with us on watch duty. This is an alarm talisman—activate it immediately if you notice anything unusual."

Senior Brother Ma handed a talisman to Li Shiming, who accepted it carefully.

The first floor spanned about a hundred square meters, devoid of furnishings except for meditation cushions arranged throughout. Each newcomer either sat cross-legged in quiet conversation or lay curled up resting.

The talisman in his hand controlled the first floor's mechanisms. When inactive, it granted recognition from the floor's formation array, allowing the bearer to open the door and access the deck—a privilege reserved for watchkeepers, offering rare moments of respite in this confined space.

Assigned to the first watch rotation, Li Shiming found himself paired with Senior Brother Wu, who seemed tireless and willing to guide him. Though taciturn by nature, Senior Brother Wu showed no ill will toward Li Shiming.

"Senior Brother Li, I'm Jin Shufeng, and this is my sister Jin Fengzhi. We're both from Great Xia—perhaps we could look out for each other?" A youth clad in robes embroidered with four-clawed golden dragons spoke up as Li Shiming passed. 

Li Shiming had noticed him earlier. The young royal had already formed connections with two other youths from Great Xia, establishing himself as the leader of their small group through his imperial status and his sister's spiritual root talent.

Jin Shufeng extended the invitation because of Li Shiming's current unique position. Unaware of Li Shiming's spiritual roots, he assumed any subject of Great Xia would naturally defer to his authority as a prince.

Before the Ascension Assembly, Great Xia's imperial family had used their connections to test Jin Shufeng and Jin Fengzhi's spiritual roots. Upon confirming Jin Shufeng qualified for Tianhai Sect, they showered him with privileges. Though Jin Fengzhi possessed superior roots, as a woman, her prospects were deemed inferior—at least in the imperial family's eyes.

This upbringing fostered Jin Shufeng's arrogance. He'd restrained himself in the presence of Elder Zhao and the senior disciples, but now seized the opportunity to expand his influence. By recruiting Li Shiming, he hoped to command more youths and strengthen his faction.

"Maintain silence and rest properly," Li Shiming replied indifferently, dismissing Jin Shufeng's ambitions.

Jin Shufeng's face flushed crimson at the rebuke. 

Li Shiming found the prince's naivety almost amusing. The cultivation world wasn't so simple. His recent experiences had taught him its dangers firsthand.

Cultivators walked solitary paths, maintaining careful distances between one another. Forming factions within a sect required capabilities far beyond what Jin Shufeng possessed—especially considering his spiritual roots barely met Tianhai Sect's minimum threshold.

Merely passing the spiritual root test didn't guarantee formal disciple status. Newcomers faced probation periods, and poor performance could demote them to menial labor. Jin Shufeng would struggle to maintain even basic disciple standing, let alone lead a faction.

Noticing the prince's resentful glare, Li Shiming smirked inwardly and continued his patrol. 

Counting heads, he noted twenty-two youths—meaning the flying vessel had visited at least five kingdoms, judging by Great Xia's recruitment numbers.

"Junior Brother Li, it's mealtime. The provisions are in the storage bags inside that cabinet—distribute them." Senior Brother Wu's voice whispered directly into Li Shiming's ear through sound transmission.

Checking his pocket watch—around seven in the evening—Li Shiming memorized the timing for future reference. He retrieved four storage bags from the cabinet, each containing mundane food suitable for mortals.

Each youth received a meal of rice, fish, meat, soup, and fruit. As they began eating, Senior Brother Ma called out, "Junior Brother Li, join us for dinner!"

Senior Brother Wu joined them as well. Senior Brother Ma produced spirit rice and distributed spirit fruits. Feeling somewhat embarrassed, Li Shiming contributed a dish of stir-fried spirit bamboo shoots.

"These are some spirit ingredients I happened to acquire—I've saved a portion."

"Spirit bamboo shoots! It's been ages!" Senior Brother Ma's eyes lit up as he eagerly took a large bite, his face blooming with satisfaction. For Qi Refinement cultivators like them, spirit rice alone was a luxury—other spirit foods remained rare treats.

"Junior Brother Li, if you have more spirit bamboo shoots, don't consume them yourself. Exchange them for cultivation resources once we reach the sect," Senior Brother Wu advised between bites—an unusually verbose suggestion from the normally reticent man.

"Exactly! The spiritual energy from food is negligible. Converted into spirit pills, a single pill could significantly boost your cultivation," Senior Brother Ma added between mouthfuls.

Though touched by their apparent concern, Li Shiming remained cautious. Gu Jia had warned him—new disciples often faced "friendly" seniors who exploited their naivety to swindle resources. 

The sect turned a blind eye to such consensual scams, considering them lessons for the gullible. Being cheated within sect grounds meant losing resources; outside, it could cost lives.

Still, the shared spirit meal warmed relations between them.

Over the following days, the flying vessel traversed vast distances, stopping in three more kingdoms to collect nine additional youths. Including himself, Tianhai Sect had recruited only thirty-one qualified youths across the mortal realms this cycle—a testament to spiritual roots' rarity.

Jin Shufeng grew increasingly active, expanding his faction to nine members—a considerable presence on the first floor. Neither Elder Zhao nor the senior disciples intervened, though Li Shiming detected faint scorn in their gazes.

Finally, welcome news arrived: they were returning to the sect.
