# Chapter 64: Discussing the Dao of the Sword; Ying Bing: "Did I Underestimate Him Before?"

For the first time, Ice Cube was seriously cooking.
Out of principle not to waste, the few dishes were finally plated and served.
On the table.
The lumps sitting on the plates gave off an illusion of radiating a demonic halo.
"So... what exactly is this you made?"
Everyone knew that Li Mo had exceptional culinary skills.
But the dishes Ice Cube made were indeed a bit beyond his comprehension.
"Tomato scrambled eggs," Ying Bing said coolly, wiping her face clean with a handkerchief.
"....... And this one?"
Li Mo remained silent for a moment before asking again.
"Stir-fried meat with chili peppers."
After Ying Bing spoke, she received a surprised look from Li Mo.
She could actually identify them?
"And this..."
"Nine-Revolution Intestines."
She even answered before he could ask.
Li Mo took a sharp breath. Was she doing this on purpose or was it an accident?
He could only avert his gaze, unable to look directly. "Good... well, you've learned to cook for yourself... hehe, impressive. Have you been eating like this these past few days?"
"I only cooked once today," Ying Bing said softly.
Li Mo: "?"
So she didn't cook early or late, but specifically chose the day I came back?
This confirms it; she did it on purpose.
That makes sense. For Ice Cube to take the initiative to cook would be as unlikely as the sun rising from the west.
"You can't just look at the surface of things."
"Perhaps it just looks bad, but it might be surprisingly good in reality."
Ying Bing's serious, vermilion lips parted slightly.
Let's not elevate the situation right now!
Li Mo finally understood why Ice Cube had made this table of dishes.
Her appearance was peerless, and she harbored pride in her bones. Although she never said anything, it was evident from her usual demeanor.
Ice Cube was not one to be content with being second to anyone; she wanted to do everything perfectly.
Including cooking.
But then again, when God opens a door for you, he surely welds a window shut with cement.
Her peerless beauty, and with one move, she created something earth-shattering and ghost-weeping...
"If we don't eat soon, it will get cold."
Ying Bing spoke softly, cutting off the excuse Li Mo had just found.
The killing power of this sentence was no less than "Da Lang, drink your medicine."
"Alright!"
"Then today, I shall accompany the gentleman with my life!"
Li Mo nodded heavily and, with a heroic resolve, reached out with his chopsticks.
The hand holding the chopsticks trembled slightly.
But perhaps Ice Cube found his movements too slow. Before he could he夹 the tomato scrambled eggs, she夹了一块 a piece of Nine-Revolution Intestines for him.
The moment he ate it, a wonderful flavor exploded in his mouth, as wonderful as his life in his previous existence.
It was sour, bitter, and twisted, making his scalp tingle.
That taste was a life-long shadow that could make him wake up from nightmares in the middle of the night.
"You... why are you crying?"
"Grandma..."
"Are you thinking of the taste of your grandma?"
"No, I can see her."
Watching a tear fall from the corner of Li Mo's eye, Ying Bing frowned.
There were actually two reasons why she personally cooked.
First, she couldn't quite believe that there was something she couldn't do well.
Second, since she needed to ask Li Mo for help, she would owe him another favor and had to show some appreciation.
So, over the past few days, she had seriously researched it.
Take the stir-fried meat with chili peppers, for example. The recipe said that stir-fried meat with chili peppers must be spicy enough, so that the aroma bursts out as soon as it enters the mouth.
So she went to the Dan Ding Peak and asked Elder Xue for a few bottles of Black Evil Wood Oil. This material is generally used when the temperature for alchemy is insufficient and explosive firepower is needed to burn away impurities.
Elder Xue said it was safe to consume, so she brought it back and used it with peace of mind.
Then, she didn't quite understand the instruction to add "one spoonful" in the recipe.
After all, it didn't specify how big the spoon was.
So she added it for ten seconds.
Isn't it delicious?

Ying Bing夹了一块 stir-fried meat with chili peppers.
........
Half an hour later.
A new table of dishes was served.
Looking at Ice Cube's originally red lips, which had become even more lustrous and crimson, Li Mo sighed:
"Actually, I didn't help you that much. You didn't need to go through the trouble of cooking personally."
"Mm."
"Let's eat."
Li Mo rinsed his mouth and took two big bites of the vegetables he had fried himself before he felt alive again.
Ying Bing's eyes flickered slightly, and she asked again:
"How is she... doing now?"
"I left some healing supplements for Jiang Chulong. I also bought the residence she was staying in, so she doesn't have to worry about her daily life. I instructed the Mu family to deliver supplies to her regularly."
"Mm?"
Ying Bing couldn't help but flash a hint of surprise on her jade-like face.
She understood Jiang Chulong's personality; that girl was very closed off and had trouble even speaking clearly.
Jiang Chulong was actually willing to tell Li Mo her name; it seemed she got along well with him.
Watching Li Mo eat heartily, Ying Bing's gaze softened.
If it was him, it wasn't really that surprising.
"Thank you."
"Just a small favor."
Li Mo coughed lightly and said solemnly, "We're so familiar with each other. You don't need to be so serious and formal about small things like this."
After understanding the thought process behind Ice Cube's cooking, Li Mo表示...
Seriousness is a good thing, but sometimes it's unnecessary.
Considering Ice Cube's personality, Li Mo added:
"If you really want to thank me, you can just help me with something."
"How can I help?"
"For example... discuss the Dao of the Sword with me?"
Li Mo had no one else to ask.
After thinking it over, only Ice Cube remained.
There was no other way.
He really didn't know how to help Jiang Chulong with her confusion.
He had no idea what was inside that girl's little head.
"Discuss the Dao of the Sword with me?"
Ying Bing raised her eyes, her slender brows lifting slightly.
Instruction and discussion are two different things.
In the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, the number of people qualified to discuss the Dao of the Sword with her could be counted on one hand.
She once had control over a path of the sword, which meant her understanding of the sword had touched the origin of the Dao and stood at the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.
At least based on Li Mo's previous talent for the sword, he wasn't qualified to discuss it with her.
A deep discussion would be harmful and useless to him.
"Let's hear your question first."
"I made a list."
Li Mo grinned and pulled a piece of paper from his chest.
He was afraid he would forget, so he wrote down the questions.
Ying Bing glanced over it.
Her light eyes suddenly paused and slowly narrowed.
These questions...
They actually point subtly to the fundamentals of the sword path?
She could certainly answer them.
But how could Li Mo ask such questions?
Asking questions also requires a certain level. The doubts that arise in the minds of geniuses and mediocrities are completely different.
Ah...
It's like when someone gets hit on the head by an apple, they might ask why they were so unlucky today.
A genius asks why the apple falls down and not up...
Ying Bing stared at Li Mo, her ice-mirror-like eyes reflecting the youth, as if trying to see through him.
His previous talent was only considered strange, far from being a genius.
Strange, because Li Mo was sometimes dull and sometimes enlightened. It could only be said that he was 'prone to enlightenment,' which was different from others, but it wasn't that his talent for the sword itself was different.
Did I underestimate him before?
Ying Bing wasn't quite sure of the specific reason: "Is that all?"
Li Mo subconsciously scratched his cheek and nodded: "Yeah, that's it for now."
