# 35，仁师之死

“韩笠……”

Hearing Mo Daifu’s weak call, Han Li knelt on the spot, unmoving. He simply kowtowed, without a sound of crying, but resolutely refusing to budge an inch, unlike the carefree Xiao Si.

Mo Daifu sighed, seeming to understand, and didn't hold it against him. "In my years at the Seven Mysteries Sect, you are the only one with spiritual roots. I originally taught you the Immortal cultivation method with a tentative attitude, never expecting you to actually cultivate it."

Hearing this, Li Zhiming slowly stopped crying, his tear-filled eyes turning in astonishment to look at Han Li kneeling there.

Han Li knelt there, without uttering a word.

"...I envy you," Mo Daifu said, gazing at the roof, his voice filled with wistfulness and becoming distant. "Cultivating Immortality, seeking longevity and eternal youth, traversing mountains and rivers, overlooking the nine heavens, how wonderful."

The skin on Han Li’s back began to tighten slowly, his entire body visibly tensing up.

But Mo Daifu did not continue on that topic.

“The sages say: One must not have the heart to harm others, but one must have the heart to guard against others… In this, you are very good.”

“But what I want you to understand is only this sentence.”

Mo Daifu sighed, the next words causing the previously tense Han Li to freeze completely. “But, one’s heart must cherish the desire to save the world, endure the filth of the world; possess the depth of a abyss-like city, and discern the hearts of others, this is the righteous path.”

Mo Daifu’s voice grew weaker and weaker. “Think thrice before acting, this is good, but you are too cautious, hesitant, often protecting yourself with cleverness, indecisive in advancing and retreating…”

“Han Li, remember well, the matters of this world are extremely simple. Sometimes there is no need to look before and after. A reckless attempt will naturally solve it. In this, you are far inferior to Xiao Si.”

“After my death, there is one matter I entrust to you.”

“My family is in Lanzhou, with many wives and children. Alas, they are lonely and helpless, with no one to care for them. I was harmed by petty men and enemies and dare not return home. Today… I entrust you to secretly return to Lanzhou one day and take care of my family.”

“I cared for you for four years. In the future, please care for them for four years. After four years, our relationship will be settled.”

“You can go to the Spinning Light Sect to learn cultivation.”

“Cough, cough… These years, I have only taught you the path of cultivation, not the art of fighting, for fear that you would go astray and your foundation would be unstable.”

“Now, these are all hidden in the box, you… read them slowly.”

Having said that, without waiting for Han Li to respond, his hand fell limply.

In that instant, Li Zhiming, with tearful eyes, raised his head. These words had exhausted all of Mo Daifu's strength. From the very beginning, the fantasies, struggles, and desperate fights before entering this hall, nothing had happened!

Until this moment, Li Zhiming and Han Li were completely stunned.

Did it end like this?

Yes, it ended.

Mo Daifu's hand fell completely, his half-open eyes completely losing focus at this moment, his limbs cold, and his breath extinguished.

A foul odor uncontrollably permeated the room. In the instant of muscle relaxation, Mo Daifu lost control of his bowels.

At that moment, Li Zhiming instantly saw his master’s fate uncontrollably gushing out.

And this moment was completely different from the past!

Just like when Li Zhiming saw it on his father.

It was like a person completely opening their pages to you.

Fate: Light Green [Local Tyrant]

Skills: Devil Silver Hand max: You have cultivated Devil Silver Hand for forty years, and you are now invincible in the world! …No vigilance, can be copied.

Scholar: You have the cultural accomplishment of a scholar. …No vigilance, can be copied.

Hanging Pot to Help the World max: You have the best medical skills in the world. …No vigilance, can be copied.

Trapped Dragon Kung max: You have superb Trapped Dragon Kung skills. …No vigilance, can be copied.

…

In an instant, these Fates, including these skills, were like a person gradually becoming transparent and dissipating before death!

"Master!!!" Li Zhiming immediately kowtowed, tears streaming down his face. But at that moment, in the instant Mo Daifu breathed his last, a dark green shadow flew out of Mo Daifu's corpse! It was like a ghost, frantically pouncing towards Han Li!

Seeing this thing, both Li Zhiming and Han Li were frightened and took a step back.

But the moment this thing flew out of Mo Daifu’s corpse, it faced the wide open doors and windows, and the boundless sunlight pouring in. The thing let out a terrifying shriek, like ice and snow melting, as if it had encountered a natural enemy.

"You don't want your life! You madman, madman, madman, ah!!!!"

Yu Zitong let out a cry of unparalleled terror and despair before his death.

But he was still far away from touching Han Li when he completely vanished in the scorching sunlight!

He would never have imagined why there would be a mortal in this world who could resist the temptation of cultivating Immortality! Why, why!

Why was he willing to die, even if it meant perishing together with himself!

He would never have the answer, because everything about him had completely dissipated in this sunlight.

Only now did Han Li incredulously raise his head. He still couldn't believe that Mo Daifu was really dead.

He looked at the box his master had left him on the ground, and with trembling hands, he first slowly opened a small crack. After taking a deep breath, Han Li turned his body slightly, aiming the box at the sunlight outside.

Then, after taking a few deep breaths, he suddenly opened it!

But nothing happened.

Only now did Han Li look into the box. Inside was a map, the one torn from the secret room that day, marked with the location of "Lanzhou", and another red mark outside the Seven Mysteries Sect.

The second half of the Evergreen Formula, and various methods of immortal techniques.

A letter to his children.

And a book.

Li Zhiming recognized that book. It was the book he saw in the secret room that day, the one with the note inside. After seeing that book, Han Li was no longer the same as before.

Li Zhiming picked up the book and opened it.

Now that Li Zhiming was literate, he no longer needed Han Li to read the contents aloud. Opening the book, there were still countless notes inside. Li Zhiming read them carefully, and could not help but feel his hair stand on end.

This was the root of Han Li's desperate defense against Mo Daifu all these years.

This was an evil art!

It taught the evil art of how to seize a body!

That is, to have Han Li practice the Evergreen Formula, and after reaching a certain level, Mo Daifu would seize his body! In this way, Mo Daifu could escape a severely injured body and obtain a body suitable for cultivating Immortality!

It was precisely after accidentally seeing such an evil art that Han Li was convinced that Mo Daifu had ulterior motives towards him, and had been guarding against him for the past two years.

He had even kept silent about this matter to this day for fear of affecting Li Zhiming's view of Mo Daifu!

But what he never expected was that Mo Daifu, even in death, would protect his disciple and would rather die than choose to seize his body!

"Pa!" The book in Li Zhiming's hand fell to the ground. Facing the dead Mo Daifu and Yu Zitong, and the empty room, Han Li kowtowed heavily on the ground, finally bursting into tears, tears and snot falling to the ground.

When he raised his head again, blood was flowing from his forehead, and snot was running from his nose.

He was heartbroken, his eyes red.

"Master!!!!!!"
