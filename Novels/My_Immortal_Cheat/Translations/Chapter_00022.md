Chapter 22: Pervert

Qin Di approached Zhou Tian and said solemnly, "Zhou Tian, don't take it to heart. We're just being cautious. After all, the divine ability you displayed made us suspicious. If you're still upset, I apologize."

Zhou Tian waved his hand, indicating that he wasn't bothered. "It's fine, you guys are in high positions, you think a lot and consider a lot, it's understandable."

He then asked, "Is Tian Ling okay?"

Tian Ling had lost consciousness and slumped onto the chair when Zhou Tian first used his teleportation ability. It was clear that Qin Di was responsible.

Qin Di smiled and said, "Don't worry, I just made her sleep for a while. She's not hurt."

Zhou Yi walked up and asked, "You're not going to explain how you got that divine ability?"

Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Yi. "I already explained it. If you don't believe me, that's not my problem."

Zhou Yi's face turned red with anger. "Spirit controlling the body? Or some special training method? Don't try to deceive us!"

Qin Di intervened, "Alright, Zhou Tian, if you don't want to say it, then don't. Just remember that the Zhou family will always be your backing. If you have any problems, don't shoulder them alone."

He continued, "Your father was worried about your future cultivation, so he asked me to find ways to enhance your strength. But it seems that's not necessary now."

Zhou Tian looked at Zhou Yi and felt a warmth in his heart. "Oh..."

Zhou Yi remained silent.

Qin Di chuckled and said, "Although there were some twists, today's matter is settled. The people from Da Luo Academy will be discussing some things with me later, so you two can leave. The imperial edict is already drafted, and the marriage will be announced soon."

Zhou Yi nodded and said, "Then we'll take our leave, big brother."

Zhou Tian looked at Tian Ling, who was still lying on the chair, and had a bold idea. "You move aside, I'll wake Tian Ling up. It's time to go."

Zhou Yi glared at Zhou Tian. "You don't need to use your energy to wake her up."

Zhou Tian quickly stopped Zhou Yi, who was about to use his divine ability. "Hey, you're tired too. Don't exhaust yourself."

Zhou Yi sneered, "You're just trying to get close to her, aren't you?"

Zhou Tian's smile froze, and he retorted, "What's it to you?"

Zhou Yi coldly smiled, gathering a green energy in his hand. "You owe me after what you put me through this afternoon. Can't you just compensate me a little?"

Zhou Tian looked at Zhou Yi with pleading eyes. "Father, have mercy on your son..."

Zhou Yi's expression softened slightly, and he withdrew his divine ability.

Zhou Tian thanked him and then scooped up Tian Ling in his arms, cradling her like a princess.

Tian Ling was light, and Zhou Tian, despite being a mortal, didn't feel any strain. She was limp in his arms, her face pressed against his chest, her eyelashes fluttering gently.

As they left the palace, Qin Di watched them go, his eyes deep in thought. After a while, he said, "Return half of the things taken from the Hao Tian Sect, and give back half of their fief. Tell them it's Tian Ling's betrothal gift."

The order was acknowledged by a voice from the void.

Zhou Yi and Zhou Tian got into a carriage, with Zhou Tian still holding Tian Ling. Zhou Yi said, "Your soul lamp was used for verification today, so it's hard to detect your soul fluctuations in the future. Be careful."

Zhou Tian nodded, his expression neutral. "I know. I can take care of myself."

As they rode in the carriage, Zhou Tian couldn't resist pinching Tian Ling's cheek. She felt soft and comfortable in his arms.

Tian Ling stirred in his arms, making a soft sound. Zhou Tian immediately sat up straight, but when he looked down, he pinched her cheek again, satisfying his perverted desire.

Unbeknownst to Zhou Tian, Tian Ling's ears had turned red, and she was aware of everything that was happening.

Zhou Yi, however, was aware of everything, and he couldn't help but think that his son was smitten with this young girl. He also noticed that Tian Ling was pretending to be asleep, her eyelashes trembling slightly.
