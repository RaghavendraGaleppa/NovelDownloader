# Chapter 240: What to Give Him? A Date Plan!

The next day, at noon.

The courtyard, originally meant for alchemy, was now filled with a dense, sharp aura of weaponry and slaughter, all confined within this small space. The youth’s tempered physique, having shed its impurities, now radiated a gradually thick, dark luster. This was a sign that his Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body was approaching perfection.

Forging one's physique was easy in some ways, yet difficult in others. The difficulty lay in the persistence required day after day; the ease lay in the fact that one didn't need to overthink it—just strive toward a single goal, and be better than yesterday.

While enduring the tempering of the divine weapon, Li Mo, who was adept at utilizing time, was also contemplating the weapon's intent. This was a discovery he had made by accident. By observing the *Wukong Seeking Dao Diagram* to temper his soul intent while using the divine weapon to temper his physical body, the two processes not only didn't interfere with each other but actually complemented each other.

It was nearly noon when Li Mo finally stopped. He opened the courtyard gate and stepped out.

Today was the Autumn Festival. The tavern was already decorated with lanterns and colorful banners, bustling with excitement. Even Elder Zeng from Hengyun Sword City and Bai Jinghong had come to help with the preparations. The tavern hadn't officially reopened yet, so they were essentially the first guests.

The elders chatted with one another, while the younger generation shared tales of the martial world. It was a harmonious scene, as if it were just an ordinary day.

However, the young woman sitting there seemed somewhat out of place with the lively atmosphere.

Ying Bing sat beneath a tree, her gaze serene and distant. A letter lay before her, and she seemed to be pondering some profound martial principle. Even the autumn cicadas beside her dared not chirp loudly. The sunlight was just right, filtering through the leaves of the banyan tree to cast dappled golden shadows upon her sky-blue dress.

The disciples from Sword City looked at her with infinite reverence whenever their eyes swept over her, as if gazing upon a celestial maiden.

Suddenly, the young woman’s gaze shifted slightly as she caught sight of the youth emerging from the courtyard. Before he could turn his eyes toward her, she lowered her gaze once more to the small notebook in front of her.

"Li Shaoxia."

"You're still training on the Autumn Festival? That's so diligent."

"Here, this is a specialty from our Sword City. Happy Autumn Festival."

The familiar faces all greeted Li Mo and presented him with gifts. Li Mo had long prepared his return gifts and took out several boxes of mooncakes. They were the ones he had made previously, featuring little portraits.

"Brother Li, why are there mooncakes with everyone's faces on them, but not yours?"

Bai Jinghong opened a box of mooncakes and found ones with Tang Xiaobao's face, Ouyang's, Shang Wu's... but none with Li Mo's pattern.

"I don't have one either."

"Me neither."

"None? But I made plenty of lotus paste ones..."

Little Li scratched the back of his head, completely baffled. Moreover, the more he scratched, the itchier his head became. Where had all those lotus paste mooncakes gone? A reasonable guess was that Senior Brother Ouyang had eaten them; Ouyang often got up in the middle of the night to look for food...

The sound of their voices drifted to the nearby tree.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and gently stroked the head of the big-headed doll. Her expression remained indifferent as she翻开 the letter again. She picked up the brush, whose ink had already dried, yet she still didn't know how to write.

"Sister Bing, what are you... thinking about?"

A soft, weak voice came. Ying Bing turned her head to see Jiang Chulong standing there timidly.

"I'm thinking... about martial arts."

"Really?"

Jiang Chulong blinked her gray-white eyes. Although her voice was soft, the doubt in her eyes was visible even through the bandages. How could Sister Bing be lost in thought over martial arts for so long...

Ying Bing was momentarily lost. Suddenly, she didn't know how to face that clear, innocent gaze. So she looked at the box in Jiang Chulong's hands. "What is this?"

"A... gift for Autumn Festival... for Brother Li."

"Gift..."

Watching Jiang Chulong happily run over to Li Mo, Ying Bing couldn't help but feel a little lost. For the Autumn Festival... it seemed one was supposed to prepare gifts.

---

*Just go with the flow,* she thought. Exchanging gifts during the Autumn Festival is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. She didn't even celebrate her own birthday, let alone festivals, so she wasn't in the habit of preparing gifts. But what could she prepare on such short notice? It felt that no matter what she gave, it would pale in comparison to what he had given her...

Not far away.

"Huh? Lotus paste mooncakes? I don't know anything about that. I haven't even eaten a single mooncake yet."

In response to Li Mo's question, Ouyang looked completely clueless.

"It wasn't you who ate them?"

Li Mo was a bit puzzled.

"I swear on my chastity, I've been thinking about updates lately. I haven't eaten in two days!"

"..."

Little Li looked at Senior Brother Ouyang's ethereal expression and felt that if one removed the first half of that sentence, it would be quite convincing.

Li Mo asked curiously, "You draw pretty fast, isn't the workload too heavy lately?"

"It's mainly about finding locations. I'm out running around every day."

Ouyang shook his head. "One can't draw what one hasn't seen. I've been wandering outside these past few days, recording down scenery worth drawing."

"Running around outside every day and not even eating, aren't you hungry?"

"Actually, I don't feel hungry."

Ouyang found it strange too.

"..."

Li Mo couldn't help but imagine the scene. It was the Autumn Festival. As everyone knows, on such a grand festival, the streets are bustling with activity. Moreover, the Autumn Festival carries the meaning of lovers' reunions. The streets are filled with the "scent of love." For a *hikikomori* otaku like Senior Brother Ouyang to walk the streets, it's a miracle he wasn't overwhelmed.

"Then, which places have good scenery?"

Li Mo changed the topic, avoiding a deeper inquiry into the matter. Although Senior Brother Ouyang's specialty was drawing cool girls, his sense of scene composition wasn't bad either.

"You've asked the right person."

Ouyang looked knowledgeable and spoke eloquently: "Besides the Dragon Gate at Yulong Street, the Magpie Bridge and the Zhuangyuan Tower in Yunzhou City have excellent scenery."

"Brother Ouyang has a good eye."

Wu Chushu nodded from the side, smiling. "The poetry gatherings at Zhuangyuan Tower and the river lanterns at the Magpie Bridge are both wonderful sights."

Bai Jinghong rarely joined the discussion. "That's right, later there will be a fireworks festival that can be seen all over Yunzhou City."

Li Mo listened to the vivid descriptions from the group, mentally noting down the places they mentioned. He couldn't help but look to the side.

"Ice Cube!"

"Hm?"

Ying Bing raised her head, and the youth's figure entered her vision. The sunlight, filtering through the leaves, happened to shine upon her, dispelling her usual aloofness. Of course, to outsiders, she remained as cold as ever. But Li Mo didn't think so.

"Shall we go to these places tonight?"

"Alright."

"You haven't even asked what places they are."

Li Mo laughed in amazement.

The young woman had already stood up and sat beside him. Her hair drifted over to his neck, carrying a faint scent that made it itch.

"You'll know when we get there."

A hint of softness in Ying Bing's eyes—perhaps even she hadn't noticed it herself?

Ouyang: "..."

Why couldn't he control his own mouth? The mooncakes he had just received were now unappetizing. He suddenly understood why he hadn't felt hungry after running outside for two days.

"..."

Bai Jinghong and Wu Chushu exchanged a glance.

*We were having a nice conversation, and you're here collecting date routes?*

*Is that polite?*
