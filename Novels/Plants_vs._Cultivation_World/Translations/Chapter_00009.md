# Chapter 9: The Corpse Ghost True Explanation  

Three days after the assault incident, the disciples from the sect's Law Enforcement Hall had already apprehended the attacker. The culprit was also an outer disciple—a Qi Refining outer disciple who had entered the sect several years earlier.  

Among this year's batch of outer disciples, Fan Shaoming was the first to reach the Qi Refining stage. Now, he was undoubtedly the strongest of his peers, so naturally, no one dared to target him.  

Once the attacker was caught, his cultivation was immediately crippled, and he was expelled from the sect. Outer disciples were already those with the poorest spiritual roots, and with his cultivation destroyed, he would never have another chance to cultivate in this lifetime.  

As for Fan Shaoming, he retrieved his lost opportunity. However, this time, he directly offered the treasure to an outer sect steward, earning the steward's favor and receiving medicinal pills to heal his injuries.  

Though Fan Shaoming lost an opportunity he couldn’t control, he gained the protection of a steward—a stroke of fortune in disguise. With a steward backing him, Fan Shaoming's future would undoubtedly be much smoother than that of the other outer disciples.  

The incident left the outer disciples with mixed feelings. Some praised the sect’s strict enforcement of the law, feeling reassured by how quickly the culprit was caught. Others envied Fan Shaoming’s good fortune.  

As for Gu Mo, his heart was filled with vigilance. He, too, had an opportunity—one even greater than Fan Shaoming’s treasure.  

If the existence of the Sunflower were discovered, would he also be targeted? The answer was almost certainly yes.  

"It seems I still need to keep a low profile," Gu Mo muttered, taking a deep breath. Fan Shaoming had exposed himself because he had been too conspicuous. With his poor spiritual roots, his cultivation speed rivaled that of someone with mid-grade spiritual roots—any fool could tell something was amiss.  

Thus, Gu Mo decided to slow his cultivation progress. Originally, he could have reached the Qi Refining stage in three months. Now, he chose to extend that timeline.  

Previously, he refined one portion of solar essence every day. Now, he planned to refine one portion every two days, matching the expected speed of someone with poor spiritual roots. The remaining solar essence would be used to disperse the dark mist in the Black Mist Space.  

Gu Mo had always held high expectations for the Black Mist Space. However, his previous goal had been to reach the Qi Refining stage as quickly as possible, so he had abandoned exploring it.  

Now that his cultivation had to slow down, it was the perfect time to investigate the Black Mist Space. If he could find another Sunflower seed, it would be a massive gain.  

Time passed swiftly in cultivation—though for Gu Mo, cultivation mainly meant practicing the Cleaning Art. As for his actual cultivation base, he only spent a few breaths every two days absorbing solar essence.  

His relentless practice of the Cleaning Art made him feel as though he was inching closer to mastery.  

"Brother Yao won’t be coming today. He’s currently preparing to break through to the Qi Refining stage," someone announced a month later when the group gathered again. This time, Yao Shifeng was absent—his mind now solely focused on advancing his cultivation.  

Without Yao Shifeng, the group chatted briefly about recent events before dispersing. Their next meeting would depend on when Yao Shifeng emerged from seclusion.  

"Gu Mo!"  

Just as Gu Mo was about to return to his cultivation, Chu Feifei called out to him. "I have some doubts about the Cleaning Art. Could you guide me again?"  

A month ago, thanks to Gu Mo’s guidance, Chu Feifei had finally mastered the Cleaning Art. This thrilled her—now she could maintain her cleanliness at all times, something of utmost importance to a female cultivator.  

However, after mastering the Cleaning Art, Chu Feifei noticed something strange: every time she cast the spell on herself, her cultivation speed increased slightly.  

This puzzled her. She was certain she was using the Cleaning Art, but she had never heard of it boosting cultivation speed.  

To unravel this mystery, she decided to seek Gu Mo’s advice again. After all, she owed her mastery of the Cleaning Art entirely to his guidance.  

"Of course," Gu Mo nodded.  

When it came to his talent for comprehending spells, Gu Mo didn’t need to hide it. Displaying his aptitude appropriately could even benefit him—such as now, where helping Chu Feifei might earn him future favors.  

As Gu Mo explained, many of Chu Feifei’s doubts were resolved. At the same time, she was astonished by his profound understanding of the Cleaning Art.  

Yet, his explanations didn’t clarify why the spell enhanced her cultivation speed. After hesitating, she ultimately chose not to voice her confusion. Their current relationship wasn’t close enough to share such secrets.  

Watching Chu Feifei leave with a troubled expression, Gu Mo was baffled. Had his explanation been unclear?  

Recalling what he had said, he shook his head. He had shared his insights—whether she understood them was no longer his concern.  

"Hmm?"  

Upon returning to his hut, Gu Mo’s gaze sharpened. Someone had entered his room while he was away. He was certain because a booklet now lay on his table.  

**"The Corpse Ghost True Explanation!"**  

The words on the cover made his brow twitch. This was a cultivation method—and a sinister one at that.  

"Persistent, aren’t they?"  

Flipping through the booklet, Gu Mo confirmed it was a body-refining technique. The method was profound, required no spiritual roots, and promised rapid progress. The only drawback? It demanded the consumption of a cultivator’s flesh and blood essence.  

Combined with the Soul Devouring Art—which required devouring living souls—this was truly a way to exploit every part of a victim.  

Clearly, whoever had left this book was connected to the one who had given him the Soul Devouring Art. Moreover, they hadn’t forgotten about him, this insignificant outer disciple, and had kindly delivered an even more advanced cultivation method.  

What was their goal? Were there others in the Qinglu Sect who had received similar techniques? Countless questions swirled in Gu Mo’s mind.  

But he quickly suppressed them. Right now, he lacked the ability to investigate—he didn’t even dare report this to the sect.  

The only thing he could do was refuse to practice these dark arts. As long as he wasn’t tempted, he wouldn’t be ensnared.  

Those demonic cultivators likely wouldn’t dare act openly within the Qinglu Sect. At most, they could only make small, covert moves.  

Tossing **The Corpse Ghost True Explanation** into the Black Mist Space, Gu Mo thoroughly searched his room to ensure no traps had been left behind.  

At the same time, he was grateful he always stored the Sunflower in the Black Mist Space before leaving. If he had left it out and someone noticed, the consequences would have been dire.  

After confirming his room was safe, Gu Mo resumed his daily cultivation. No matter the intentions of those who had sent him the dark arts, the best countermeasure was to grow stronger.  

As time passed, Gu Mo maintained his routine—refining one portion of solar essence every two days and using the other to disperse the Black Mist Space’s darkness.  

Neither task took much time, leaving him ample hours to relentlessly practice the Cleaning Art. He could feel himself nearing perfection.
