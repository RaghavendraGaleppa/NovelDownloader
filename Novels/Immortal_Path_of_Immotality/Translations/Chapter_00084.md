# Chapter 84: The Curse Technique

After finding a cave deep in the mountains, Lin Shan meditated for a day to restore his spiritual energy. He then headed south and, two days later, emerged from the Yan Yun Mountain Range, arriving at the Daming Prefecture in the northern part of the Great Song Dynasty.

At the local Nightingale branch, Lin Shan flashed his elder token, and the branch leader immediately arranged a carriage and driver for him. For the next ten days, Lin Shan leisurely made his way back, lying comfortably in the carriage.

Traveling westward, he entered through the strategic Dongmen Pass, crossed the central Luosong Mountain Range that ran through the Great Song, and arrived at the capital region. As he neared the capital city of Bianliang, Lin Shan dismissed the carriage driver and entered the city under the cover of night. After all, this was the territory of Princess Guo and her ilk—these nobles were the local power players. Entering openly would only alert them.

Slipping past rows of houses, Lin Shan made his way to the Bowang Marquis's residence. Inside, he turned left and right before finally stopping in front of a room.

Late at night, two candles still burned in the room. A white-browed elder in his nineties sat cross-legged on a mat—the Nightingale's Grand Elder. Suddenly, the candle flames flickered slightly. The Grand Elder's innate senses detected something amiss and opened his eyes in confusion, only to find a young man in white robes already seated beside him, smiling.

"Immortal Lin? You've returned!" 

The Grand Elder rubbed his eyes to ensure he wasn't hallucinating before breaking into a delighted smile. He quickly stood and poured tea for Lin Shan. "When did you return? Where's Immortal Huang?"

Lin Shan had been relaxed until the latter question dampened his mood. "I just got back. There were some delays on the road. As for Immortal Huang... his lifespan ended prematurely, and he passed away."

The Grand Elder nodded slowly, not pressing for details about Huang's death. At their age, they were all grasping for one last chance, so an early passing wasn't unexpected. Still, he asked somberly, "Did he accomplish what he set out to do?"

Clearly, the Grand Elder and Huang had been close, and he had some idea of Huang's goal. He cared about whether his old friend had fulfilled his wish.

Lin Shan's expression turned odd at the question. Huang had asked him to redeem a courtesan from twenty years ago, but she had since become the madam of a brothel—and a powerful figure in the demonic path. What was there to redeem?

Still, from a certain perspective, Lin Shan had delivered Huang's letter and spirit stones to the intended recipient. That counted as completing the task, even if he hadn't gained anything from it.

"Consider it done," Lin Shan replied weakly.

Seeing Lin Shan's reluctance to elaborate, the Grand Elder simply nodded. "You did your best." Then, he began fidgeting, hesitating as if he wanted to say more.

Lin Shan knew exactly what the old man was thinking. He pulled a jade box from his storage pouch and slid it across the table.

The Grand Elder carefully opened the box, revealing the Wood Spirit Vermilion Fruit inside. He inhaled its pure spiritual energy greedily before bowing repeatedly in gratitude.

Lin Shan waved him off. "Just a transaction. No need for formalities. What about the tokens...?"

The Grand Elder laughed heartily and immediately pulled Lin Shan up. "Come with me!"

---

In a side hall, sixty to seventy chests were arranged on the floor, each neatly filled with Nightingale tokens.

"Tokens from over twenty Nightingale branches across the Great Song's prefectures are all here. I'll leave you to it."

The Grand Elder considerately closed the door behind him, leaving Lin Shan alone to indulge in his treasure-hunting spree.

The chests contained nearly ten thousand Nightingale tokens in total. Lin Shan spent nearly an hour and a half examining each one, then went through them all again to ensure he hadn't missed any.

After confirming, he had gained a total of 61 points of Ancient Charm—his biggest haul yet.

This also marked the complete depletion of the Nightingale organization's "wool." For eight hundred years, the Nightingales had monopolized the assassin trade across the Great Song, their reputation widespread in the martial world.

"Probably no other mortal organization like the Nightingales could endure so long and remain so renowned," Lin Shan mused.

"The token, not the person."

This unique tradition, celebrated in countless folk tales, had turned Nightingale tokens into legendary artifacts, gathering the faith of martial artists and commoners alike.

With 77 points of Ancient Charm now in hand, Lin Shan felt it should suffice for future enhancements—whether for advancing cultivation techniques, spells, or equipment. Still, as his cultivation progressed, the cost of Ancient Charm would multiply. The more reserves he had, the better. With the Nightingales fully tapped, he'd need to shift his focus to immortal sects for a steady supply.

One thing weighed on his mind: the Foundation Establishment Pill. Such items were practically priceless, appearing only occasionally at auctions. Strengthening one wouldn't be as simple as enhancing a Qi Refining pill—it involved merging "qi and spirit" and the effects of "Dao marks," which would require significant effort.

---

After leaving the hall, Lin Shan bid farewell to the waiting Grand Elder. They then discussed the investigation Lin Shan had commissioned earlier—regarding a certain noble who had brought a giant black lotus Buddha statue from the Southern Border to the capital.

The Grand Elder stroked his beard, explaining that over the past six months, he had only traced the statue's entry into the capital before it was directly delivered to the imperial palace. The palace's tight security made further investigation impossible.

Lin Shan sighed inwardly, tucking the matter away for now. The imperial palace was guarded by Foundation Establishment cultivators from major immortal sects. Moreover, the Great Song royal family had hoarded spirit stones for generations, nurturing several of their own Foundation Establishment experts. For now, he couldn't risk infiltrating.

Worse, Lin Shan had killed the Great Yan princess—whom a royal Foundation Establishment cultivator had purchased at the Yichuan auction. Princess Guo and her companion knew this and might report it to the royal cultivators.

The only silver lining was that, according to the princess's dying words, the royal cultivator who bought her was currently visiting a cultivation family and might be too preoccupied to act immediately.

Lin Shan shook his head and set the matter aside.

The Grand Elder then offered Lin Shan a position as a Nightingale consultant with generous benefits, but Lin Shan declined. The mortal world was too barren—staying here would stunt his progress.

After chatting a while longer, dawn approached, and Lin Shan finally took his leave. His next targets—Princess Guo and the brocade-robed middle-aged man—were both royal cultivators with considerable influence in the mortal world. He didn't want to drag the Nightingales into this.

---

At daybreak, Lin Shan concealed his appearance and checked into an inn.

Though he had completed the Grand Elder's commission and harvested Ancient Charm, he wasn't ready to return to Yichuan. The ambush on his way here couldn't go unanswered.

Two of the four assailants had died, but the masterminds—Princess Guo and the brocade-robed man—were still alive.

Lin Shan wasn't one to let grudges slide. Holding a grudge without retaliation? Unthinkable.

Fortunately, after his fight with the red-faced monk, he had retrieved the brocade-robed man's broken talisman sword. Now was the perfect time to test his newly acquired curse technique—the Seven-Arrow Book of Nailing Heads.

"Brocade-robed man, today you'll be my test subject!"

In his room, Lin Shan set up the ritual: a straw effigy at the center, two lamps lit on either side, the broken sword placed before the effigy, and a homemade bow and arrow at the ready.

Drawing the curtains, the room dimmed, leaving only the eerie flicker of the two lamps. A strange, chilling aura seeped into the space.

The small straw effigy suddenly seemed to loom large, its shadow stretching across half the room in the dim light. Behind Lin Shan, an even larger shadow emerged without warning.

Unaware of any anomaly, Lin Shan merely nodded in satisfaction at the ominous atmosphere.

"Heh heh heh..."

With a sinister grin, Lin Shan drew the bowstring, slowly aiming at the effigy.

Deep in his soul, the seed of his divine ability awakened an indescribable essence. Lin Shan suddenly felt as though his arrow wasn't aimed at the effigy but at a tiny spatial rift connected to it.

His consciousness stretched infinitely, traversing an unknown distance. Through the effigy, he glimpsed another dark, enclosed space where a shadowy figure sat cross-legged.

The lamplight eerily seeped into that space, revealing the figure's brocade robes and square face—the very man who had ambushed him alongside Princess Guo.

The brocade-robed man suddenly shivered, sensing the unnatural chill. He opened his eyes in confusion, only to find two inexplicable beams of light in his pitch-black chamber. Beneath him, two of his own shadows overlapped faintly.

"What the—? Am I seeing things?"

Before he could process it, Lin Shan released the bowstring.

*Thwack!*

The arrow struck the effigy.

"Aaaargh—!"

On the other side, the brocade-robed man let out a bloodcurdling scream, his voice laced with terror, confusion, and despair.

Lin Shan peered through the rift, watching as the man clutched his chest, his face contorted in agony. He collapsed to his knees, his body wreathed in eerie purple-gray mist.

Gray patterns emerged on his skin, as if unspeakable horrors writhed beneath. His veins bulged and shrank erratically, like countless ants crawling under his flesh.

The man descended into madness, alternating between frenzied thrashing and pitiful sobbing.

"Screech! Screech!"

Unearthly shrieks shattered the silence as his skin ruptured like a punctured balloon. Black beetles burrowed out, crawling in and out of his body.

Lin Shan shuddered at the sight. This was nothing like his first experiment with the technique on the green-robed elder's soul.

"Was the soul too fragile and just... dissolved? Does a living person need prolonged torment?"

"Gah! Hrk—!"

"What is this?! No—!"

The scene blurred as the rift closed, but not before Lin Shan glimpsed the figure convulsing uncontrollably, as if something even more horrifying had descended upon him.

The ragged breathing, chaotic footsteps, tearing flesh, and final screams sent chills down Lin Shan's spine.

"This technique... seems a bit off."

The ritual tools returned to normal, as if nothing had happened. But Lin Shan knew it was all real.

Pulling open the curtains, daylight flooded the room. The straw effigy lay on the floor with an arrow embedded in it, the two lamps still burning—though their flames had dimmed.

Lin Shan pondered. The flames still burning meant the brocade-robed man was alive. If they went out, it would mean he had been cursed to death. Perhaps Lin Shan's late Qi Refining cultivation wasn't overwhelmingly stronger than his target's.

One attempt wasn't enough? Then he'd try again. You wanted to play? Let's play!

The Seven-Arrow Book of Nailing Heads could only be used three times a day. After exhausting his quota, Lin Shan waited patiently for the cooldown.

Over the following days, he remained in his room, cursing the brocade-robed man whenever possible. Each time, the lamps dimmed further, their flames on the verge of extinguishing.

Meanwhile, in the grand and opulent Prince Qi's residence southwest of the capital, a group of women wept incessantly.

The prince's heir had fallen gravely ill, his condition worsening by the day. The aged Prince Qi had even summoned imperial physicians from the palace, but none could cure him!
