## Chapter 14: Black-on-Black!

A flash of sword light, the roar of thunder.

In an instant, Zhao Xuhe's head was taken by the sword light. But before his head could hit the ground, his body suddenly exploded, turning into a pile of bones.

"I wonder which fellow disciple awaits me here?"

After the bones shattered, a wisp of yin energy flew out, eventually reforming into Zhao Xuhe's appearance a hundred meters away, a trace of panic still lingering on his face.

However, before he could finish speaking, the sword light followed like a shadow.

*Swish—!*

The next second, Zhao Xuhe's head shot into the sky again, but once more transformed into a sky full of bones. The yin energy retreated another hundred meters, manifesting his figure.

"I..."

*Boom!*

"You..."

*Crack!*

"Enough!"

Dozens of sword lights filled the space, cutting down Zhao Xuhe more than ten times before he finally regrouped, seizing an opportunity to evade the sword lights.

Though it was only a fleeting moment, Zhao Xuhe grasped it precisely. He then flung his sleeve, and a sky-filling crimson mist instantly billowed forth, shielding his entire body in its center. He swallowed several pills in succession to recover from his injuries and replenish his *qi*, before finally diverting his attention to scan his surroundings.

"Lu Yang, it's you!"

Zhao Xuhe's gaze was like a torch; he instantly recognized the sword light that had killed him over ten times as the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art, immediately calling out Lu Yang's identity.

Yet, even so, his heart was filled with unspeakable shock. He had personally experienced the power of that sword light; it was not something an early Qi Condensation cultivator could achieve. In just a few days, Lu Yang had actually reached mid Qi Condensation.

"This person must have some great fortune!"

Thinking this, Zhao Xuhe suppressed his angry expression, feeling an inexplicable joy in his heart: "Excellent, excellent! Truly, double happiness has arrived today. I shall accept this fortune!"

Outside the Illusory Maze Formation, Lu Yang's expression was grave.

"Truly troublesome..."

He prided himself on being ruthless enough, yet Zhao Xuhe still managed to seize a sliver of life, preventing him from being killed outright with a single combo. He even had his identity exposed.

However, with the Illusory Maze Formation confusing all directions, his true body was hidden in the dark, only attacking remotely with his flying sword. If it came to a real fight, his chances of winning were still higher.

At the same time, Zhao Xuhe also discovered the presence of the Illusory Maze Formation around him. Although it was just a simple trapping formation that he could easily break with a bit of time for deduction, with Lu Yang interfering and his *qi* currently less than fifty percent of its peak, he was helpless against it for the moment.

Thinking this, Zhao Xuhe's eyes rolled, and he suddenly spoke: "Brother Lu, truth be told, you and I actually bear no animosity..."

"Go!"

Strike while the iron's hot; Lu Yang naturally wouldn't reminisce with Zhao Xuhe or give him a chance to heal and recover. He immediately conjured sword arts and continued his assault.

"Tsk! You refuse the toast and choose the forfeit!"

Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe's gaze turned cold. He immediately abandoned the thought of stalling for time, instead conjuring a spell and sacrificing a metallic seal into mid-air.

This item, named the "Primal Magnetic Gold Seal," could absorb all metallic objects under heaven, specifically counteracting flying swords. It was Zhao Xuhe's most treasured secret artifact, prepared for future use against Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion disciples on the battlefield of the righteous-demonic war. Now, however, he had brought it out early, intending to restrain Lu Yang's sword light.

"Solidify!"

Zhao Xuhe activated the treasure seal, precisely seizing a sword light that was slashing towards him. With one stamp, it instantly subdued the sword light, making it impossible to move or shift.

Lu Yang, seeing this, remained unperturbed. He was still at his peak, while Zhao Xuhe was at a low point. This kind of *qi*-draining war of attrition was advantageous to him, so he wasn't flustered at all.

"My greatest advantage right now is being hidden in the dark, concealed by the formation. Zhao Xuhe can't find my location. This way, even if he has some means to turn the tide, as long as I don't show myself, it'll be useless. As long as I keep draining his *qi*, I'm sure to win."

So Lu Yang made up his mind: *I won't show myself. Flying sword? I don't need it! Anyway, you won't be able to refine my flying sword anytime soon, and you'll have to expend *qi* to suppress it. That suits me just fine. Let's see how long you can last!*

*Rumble!*

Lu Yang stood outside the formation, circulating his *qi*. A wisp of misty white *qi* floated from above his head, transforming into a several-zhang-sized handprint that slammed into the formation from the air.

This technique wasn't particularly potent; it was purely about overwhelming with brute force.

Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe's face instantly darkened, knowing that his plan had been seen through by Lu Yang.

"You bastard!"

Zhao Xuhe couldn't help but curse inwardly. Lu Yang was clearly a mid Qi Condensation cultivator like himself, yet he was so cautious. How was he supposed to turn the tide? Although he still had the strength to fight for his life, even if he killed Lu Yang, he himself would hardly survive. How could Zhao Xuhe, who had finally obtained such a great fortune, be willing to accept that?

Watching his *qi* being depleted more and more, Zhao Xuhe finally couldn't hold back and shouted: "...Brother Lu, do you know what fortune I obtained on this Coiling Dragon Island? A Grade-3 True Art that directly points to the Golden Core Great Dao! If Brother Lu stops now, I, Zhao, am willing to share this cultivation method with you!"

"Grade-3 True Art?"

Outside the Illusory Maze Formation, Lu Yang suddenly stood up upon hearing this. *Qi* had nine grades and thirty-six stages; below Grade-7, there was no path to Foundation Establishment, and below Grade-3, no entry to Golden Core.

And now, Zhao Xuhe had actually offered a cultivation method that allowed one to cultivate Grade-3 true *qi*, with a promising future for Golden Core! What a great fortune!

"No, wait..."

Lu Yang took a deep breath, suppressed his greed, and sat back down: "This person is offering great benefits, still trying to lure me out. If I go out, I'll fall into his trap."

"How about it? Brother Lu, can we reconcile?"

Inside the Illusory Maze Formation, Zhao Xuhe was still trying to persuade him, when a voice suddenly came from all directions: "Foolish! If I kill you, the cultivation method will still be mine!"

"Brother Lu, you are mistaken," Zhao Xuhe shook his head and laughed. "So-called fortune is predetermined by heaven. This Grade-3 True Art is a fortune I obtained by cultivating diligently for three lifetimes, exchanging it with merit. It has no affinity with you, Brother Lu. Even if you kill me, the cultivation method will simply fly away and will not fall into your possession."

"What?"

Lu Yang was stunned upon hearing this, his expression immediately turning uncertain. Fortune predetermined by heaven, no affinity with the cultivation method, and it would fly away automatically even if obtained?

But Lu Yang quickly reacted, sneering, "If that's the case, why should I reconcile with you for this cultivation method then?"

Zhao Xuhe quickly explained: "Brother Lu, you originally had no affinity with this cultivation method, but if I willingly share it with you, then that lack of affinity will turn into affinity."

"...Alright." After a moment of silence, Lu Yang said, "Give me a copy of the cultivation method, and I'll let you out."

"Agreed." Zhao Xuhe readily accepted. He then took out a jade box, opened it, revealing two volumes of cultivation texts inside.

"The upper volume, 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art,' is a Qi Condensation realm cultivation method. It can refine a 'True Dragon Malice,' making one a leader in terms of combat power within the same realm. The lower volume, 'Myriad Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Treasure Scroll,' is a Foundation Establishment realm cultivation method. It can refine a 'Myriad Chariots Imperial Dragon' Dao foundation, offering future prospects for the Golden Core Great Dao."

After introducing the cultivation method, Zhao Xuhe suddenly changed the subject: "However, Brother Lu, I am currently injured and my *qi* is weak. If I just give you the cultivation method like this, what if you turn hostile and break your promise?"

"...That's simple." Lu Yang's eyes darted, and he proactively suggested: "You can give me the 'Myriad Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Treasure Scroll' first, and keep the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art' for yourself. I am only in the Qi Condensation realm right now. Even if I had a Foundation Establishment cultivation method, I wouldn't be able to cultivate it. You don't need to worry about me turning hostile and harming your life." At this point, sincerity was written all over Lu Yang's face: "How about this: after I let you out, you then give me the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art'?"

Zhao Xuhe thought for a moment and felt that Lu Yang's words made a lot of sense. "It's a deal!"

Zhao Xuhe took out the "Myriad Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Treasure Scroll" from the jade box. Lu Yang still did not show himself, instead condensing a large *qi* hand to grab it from a distance.

Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe could only sigh inwardly, suppressing his last bit of hesitation, and obediently handed the cultivation method to Lu Yang.

Lu Yang received the cultivation method, memorized it word for word, then grinned.

"Goodbye!"

The next second, Lu Yang settled his *qi* in his *dantian*, directly activated the Life-Slaughtering Curse, and brazenly self-destructed!

*Boom!*

A moment later, the sky-filling dust dispersed, revealing Zhao Xuhe's face, which was filled with bewilderment.

"My cultivation method... gone?"

*Why self-destruct? Self-destructing is one thing, but why not sooner or later? Why wait until he got the cultivation method before self-destructing? I hadn't even had a chance to look at that cultivation method myself!*

"Lu Yang..."

Zhao Xuhe stood in the wind, looking at the "Myriad Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Treasure Scroll" that had turned to ash, uttering Lu Yang's name, his expression slowly twisting:

"You beast!"
