# Chapter 24: Breakthrough to Qi Refinement Second Layer

"All disciples who passed the assessment from this academy must gather at the Inheritance Pavilion within half an hour!"

A majestic voice suddenly resounded, spreading rapidly from the Inheritance Pavilion in all directions.

In various courtyards, cultivation chambers, and even cave dwellings, pairs of eyes abruptly opened, revealing expressions of excitement, apprehension, or doubt.

At the Seventh Provisional Courtyard, Instructor Wang sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion with his eyes slightly closed. The sound of his lecture on the Dao echoed continuously in the teaching hall—until it abruptly ceased.

With a complex expression, Instructor Wang glanced toward the direction of the Inheritance Pavilion and murmured, "So soon? This batch has too many geniuses. I wonder how Junior Brother Zhang's cultivation is progressing now. With his talent, he should have a chance to rank within the top twenty..."

Regaining his composure, his gaze swept over the forty-plus faces below the platform as he said indifferently, "You have three more days. If you still cannot master the foundational meditation technique by then, you will have no place in Dragon Lake Academy. Return peacefully to your mortal lives."

Despair and frustration spread among the crowd, accompanied by intermittent sobs.

Inside a cultivation chamber, Zhang Jing's face flushed crimson as he swallowed the last Grain Spirit Pill. A torrential surge of spiritual energy erupted within him like floodwaters.

The illusory great river within his body flowed faster and faster, continuously refining the spiritual energy into dark spiritual power. Strands of spiritual power filled his dantian, churning violently as if on the verge of boiling.

The Gathering Essence Spiritual Light pulsed rhythmically—contracting and expanding. Wherever its radiance passed, the spiritual power stabilized, yet its aura grew increasingly heavy and oppressive.

At a certain moment, as if reaching a critical threshold, the spiritual power erupted into a furious boil before gradually coalescing under immense pressure.

"Qi Refinement Second Layer!"

A flash of excitement crossed Zhang Jing's face as his aura surged dramatically. After taking a deep breath, his expression returned to calm as he continued practicing the "Five Organs Guiding Water Origin Technique" methodically.

Only when the transformations in his dantian fully stabilized did Zhang Jing slowly open his eyes, carefully sensing the changes brought by reaching the second layer of Qi Refinement. His spiritual power had grown more abundant and potent, while his spiritual sense and physical body had also strengthened significantly.

To test his progress, Zhang Jing channeled his spiritual sense to construct the arcane patterns of the "Frozen Edge Manifestation Art," infusing it with spiritual power. Within mere moments, a vibrating blade of condensed ice materialized in his palm, its terrifying sharpness penetrating deep into his bones.

"Indeed!" Realization dawned in Zhang Jing's eyes. Though it was the same spell, the difference in power was staggering due to his enhanced spiritual sense and spiritual power at the second layer.

With a faint smile, Zhang Jing summoned the Five Arts Spiritual River. Instantly, a broader and more turbulent river of spiritual energy materialized around him, within which five peculiar spell-formed fish swam freely. Upon his mental command, the Frozen Edge Manifestation Art in his hand transformed into a noticeably larger spell-fish within the river.

"So the capacity of the Five Arts Spiritual River increases with cultivation level—can it now hold eight spells?" he mused.

Next, the jade talisman appeared before his eyes. Seeing the somewhat disorganized skill information displayed, Zhang Jing raised an eyebrow. "It seems I need to categorize and organize these skills properly."

Under his control, the jade talisman flickered briefly before displaying the following:

**Spiritual Seeds:**
- [Low-Grade Spiritual Seed: Mind's Eye (Cannot be upgraded)]

**Cultivation Techniques:**
- [Five Organs Guiding Water Origin Technique - Level 2 (71/400)]
  - Skill Trait: Five Arts Spiritual River (Intermediate)
- [Pure Essence Breathing Meditation - Level 2 (161/300)]
  - Skill Trait: Gathering Essence Spiritual Light (Low-Grade)
- [Azure Sparrow Qi Attraction Method - Not Started (0/50)]

**Low-Grade Spells:**
- [Frozen Edge Manifestation Art - Level 3 (2/120)]
  - Skill Trait: Sharpness (Low-Grade)
- [Frostlight Curse - Level 3 (8/120)]
  - Skill Trait: Double Radiance (Low-Grade)
- [Wave-Treading Skywalk Technique - Level 1 (33/40)]
  - Skill Trait: Chilling Breath (Low-Grade)

**Special:**
- [Dark Python Devouring Void Dao Imprint - Fragment (Cannot be upgraded)]

"I've learned quite a few spells and skills," Zhang Jing remarked with a faint smile.

Additionally, he retrieved a flying sword from his storage pouch. Wrapped in dark spiritual light, the sword darted through the chamber with astonishing speed, radiating a formidable aura. Its power now far surpassed that of the black-robed man's sword from before.

"With my improved cultivation, controlling the flying sword feels much more natural, and its power nearly rivals that of the Frozen Edge Manifestation Art enhanced by the Sharpness trait," Zhang Jing noted with satisfaction. This meant he could now rely primarily on the flying sword for combat, while the Five Arts Spiritual River served as a supplementary and tactical resource, storing different spells as needed.

The combination of the two would allow him to handle most situations effectively.

Just then, the majestic voice boomed again, startling Zhang Jing momentarily before realization struck. "It seems the academy is about to announce the ranking competition format for this assessment. The timing makes sense."

He promptly stood and headed out.

Before even reaching the Inheritance Pavilion, Zhang Jing spotted the towering stone pillars standing imposingly in the square. Their sheer presence exuded an oppressive aura that grew stronger as he approached.

Shifting his gaze away from the pillars, Zhang Jing noticed nearly a hundred people already gathered before the pavilion—young men and women with youthful faces—while more continued to arrive. On the periphery stood a dozen or so outer sect disciples in green robes, observing with detached interest.

"Brother Zhang, over here!" A familiar voice called out. Turning, Zhang Jing saw Ji Bochang waving at him.

"You're here early, Brother Ji," Zhang Jing remarked as he approached.

"Ah, I happened to be nearby. By the way, I have good news for you," Ji Bochang said excitedly.

"What news?"

"Since you haven't joined a mission squad due to the high commission rates, I've been persuading Senior Sister for a while. She finally agreed—if you rank within the top twenty in this assessment, she'll recommend you for the Five Colors Squad, with the commission reduced to just five percent."

"Thank you, Brother Ji," Zhang Jing replied sincerely, touched by the gesture. Though his actual goal was the top ten, Ji Bochang had gone out of his way to help without knowing that.

"Just remember, once you join the Five Colors Squad, don't mention the commission to anyone," Ji Bochang cautioned.

"Understood," Zhang Jing agreed.

As they spoke, the crowd continued to swell. Without any formal arrangement, the gathering naturally divided into three distinct groups, separated by clear boundaries. The rising murmur of conversations created a cacophony.

"Do any of you know why the academy summoned us here?" someone from the back asked quietly.

"You know?"

"Of course," the speaker replied, his tone growing animated. "See those twenty-nine people at the front? They're the geniuses who received Grade B evaluations in the assessment!"

"What does that have to do with us gathering here?"

"Haven't you noticed how rarely those Grade B geniuses appear before us? We live in the same area, after all."

"Now that you mention it..."

Before they could continue, the entire square abruptly fell silent as all eyes turned to a young man and woman who had just arrived at the forefront.

Grade A! Monsters!

The same thought flashed through everyone's minds. Even the previously indifferent outer sect disciples now wore expressions of seriousness.

Among the crowd, Zhang Jing observed the two figures calmly, his expression unreadable.

"Two Grade A monsters..." Ji Bochang muttered with mixed emotions, at a loss for words.

The silence was broken by a booming voice: "It seems everyone is present."

Two figures in purple robes descended gracefully from the top of the stone pillars, hovering above the assembly. Zhang Jing recognized one of them—Senior Brother Liu, despite the change in attire.

Senior Brother Liu announced solemnly, "I shall now declare the second phase of Dragon Lake Academy's assessment."

"In light of the recent deaths of many junior disciples during demon-subjugation missions, we of the Inheritance Pavilion have unanimously decided that the second phase will consist of combat duels to determine the final rankings. Let this serve as a reminder—never neglect the path of self-defense."

"The event will take place here in three days," the other purple-robed man added. "Ranking rewards: top ten will receive fifty merit points monthly; ranks ten to twenty, twenty points; twenty to thirty, five points—all for one year."

With that, the two transformed into streaks of light and vanished into the Inheritance Pavilion.

The square remained silent for a moment before erupting into chaos.

Those at the back wore expressions of confusion or despair. "Combat? I don't even know any spells—how am I supposed to fight?"

"Why only rewards for the top thirty? What about the rest?"

"Does this mean no rewards for us?"

Meanwhile, Ji Bochang sighed. "Combat duels... This will come down to raw cultivation, spells, and magical instruments."

"Brother Ji, regardless of the format, isn't that what it ultimately boils down to? This just makes it more direct," Zhang Jing replied calmly. For him, having reached the second layer of Qi Refinement and possessing both offensive and defensive artifacts along with the Five Arts Spiritual River, this was favorable news.

"True... Well, I have three days left—hopefully, I can break through to the second layer by then," Ji Bochang said before taking his leave. "I should return to cultivate. Farewell for now."

"Farewell," Zhang Jing responded, turning to depart as well.

Meanwhile, in Yong'an City, at the Zhang Family Herb Shop.

"It's been almost a month—Jing'er has never been away from us for so long," Zhang Jing's mother said tearfully. "I wonder how he's doing... Is the food to his liking? Is the bed comfortable? Is anyone bullying him?"

Her husband pulled her into an embrace. "Dear, don't worry so much. Jing'er is grown now."

"How can I not worry?"

Just then, a knock sounded at the shop's door.

"Coming!" Zhang's father called out, hurrying to answer. His wife quickly wiped her tears.

"Apothecary Zhang, our employer sent me to ask—when will you be moving out?"

"I'm terribly sorry, but our son will return in three to five days. We'll relocate immediately after he arrives," Zhang's father replied respectfully.

The well-dressed middle-aged man frowned impatiently. "See that you keep your word. Our employer is growing anxious."

"Understood. You have my word."

After the man left, Zhang's parents exchanged relieved glances.

Soon after, their neighbor, Shopkeeper Liu, slipped in quietly. "They're pressuring you again, Apothecary Zhang?"

"Yes," Zhang's father admitted wearily.

"Tch. They've been harassing me too. If not for you holding out, we'd have been evicted long ago. If that Hundred Herb Pavilion owner didn't have connections to immortals, who does he think would sell their shop for such a pittance? In his dreams!"

"Careful with your words, Shopkeeper Liu," Zhang's father cautioned with a smile.

"By the way, where has your Zhang Jing gone? It's been a full month."

Before Zhang's father could reply, his wife interjected smoothly, "Our Jing'er is visiting relatives in a neighboring province. He'll return soon."

"I see..."

After Shopkeeper Liu left, Zhang's father asked, "Dear, why did you—"

"Husband, must you be so dense? If you told them the truth, they'd pester Jing'er with questions when he returns. Don't you see how that would upset him?"

"Ah! Of course! How thoughtful of you!"
