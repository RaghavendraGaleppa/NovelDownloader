# Chapter 107: The Foundation Establishment Demon Cultivator

"I'll take all these failed pills. How much do they cost?"

A voice rang out from behind, its tone so bold that the low-level cultivators gathered around the stall all turned to look. A plain-looking young man, around twenty years old, stood there. 

On the surface, he appeared utterly unremarkable. The junior cultivators grew displeased:

"You want to buy all the failed pills? Do you even have enough spirit stones?"

"Exactly, just a mid-stage Qi Refinement brat acting all high and mighty. Can't you see I'm already at the late stage?"

"Kid, daring to provoke public anger—are you looking to die?"

...

Lin Xuan couldn't be bothered to engage with their taunts. These Foundation Establishment failed pills were something he absolutely needed. He cast a cold glance at the loudest troublemakers.

Where his gaze landed, the voices abruptly ceased. The cultivators felt a chill run down their spines, as if they'd been targeted by a venomous snake, cold sweat beading on their foreheads.

How was this possible? This was just a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, weaker than them—so why did his aura feel so terrifying?

The heart-palpitating sensation vanished as quickly as it came. The junior cultivators wondered if they'd imagined it, but they no longer dared to speak recklessly.

"We're all here to buy pills—highest bidder wins. I have no intention of forcing a purchase. If any of you are willing to pay more, you're welcome to take the failed pills."

As he spoke, Lin Xuan took out twenty spirit stones from his storage bracelet. The stall owner only had one bottle of failed pills, and given their described efficacy, this was already a generous offer.

The low-level cultivators exchanged glances but showed no intention to compete. Three to five failed pills were only equivalent to one low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill. Paying twenty spirit stones for a single bottle was far too extravagant for them.

Under the envious and jealous gazes of the crowd, Lin Xuan secured the failed pills.

This was an unexpected windfall. He hadn't imagined he'd stumble upon Foundation Establishment failed pills here. Though a hundred pills weren't much, they would sustain his cultivation for a while.

His thoughts turned to the Spirit Medicine Mountain—perhaps a new plan was in order.

After browsing the market a while longer, Lin Xuan found nothing else worth purchasing. It made sense—now that he was at the Foundation Establishment stage, the chances of finding treasures at this level of trade fair were slim.

With nothing else of interest, he saw no reason to linger. Just as he prepared to leave, a deafening explosion shook the ground.

"BOOM!"

The cultivators trading in the market froze, exchanging bewildered glances. What had just happened?

---

The explosion had come from the market's entrance. The simple illusion array there had been shattered, and dark clouds now roiled in the sky...

"Look! What's that?"

A mass of black mist appeared in the empty sky, churning violently as an overwhelming spiritual pressure radiated from within.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator!

Lin Xuan frowned. The aura was vicious and violent—clearly, this person meant trouble.

"Listen well, you little insects below! Hand over all your spirit stones and treasures, or face annihilation!"

At these words, the crowd erupted like boiling oil splashed with water. Such incidents had happened before—high-level cultivators bullying their way in to rob the trade fair.

The world of cultivation was one where the strong preyed on the weak. But past robbers had met grim fates—not because the low-level attendees were formidable, but because among them were often disciples of major sects. Even if unimportant, their masters would still avenge them to save face.

Thus, after the first few chaotic trade fairs, such incidents had become rare. No one expected to witness one today.

Lin Xuan remained calm, showing no intention of stepping forward. The intruder's aura was strong—likely at the second layer of Foundation Establishment, and unmistakably a demonic cultivator.

Before the Core Formation stage, demonic cultivators of the same realm typically surpassed orthodox cultivators in combat strength. Their sinister techniques made them especially troublesome. Without absolute confidence, Lin Xuan wouldn't foolishly intervene.

He'd observe first.

"Esteemed senior, we're merely low-level Qi Refinement disciples. Surely we possess nothing worthy of your attention. Might you show us mercy...?"

The speaker, dressed like a young noble despite being only in his late twenties, appeared to be one of the fair's organizers.

"Enough chatter! Hand over your treasures and live, or keep them and die. Choose." The voice from the black mist was hoarse and emotionless.

Youthful boldness and strength in numbers emboldened the crowd. Though facing a Foundation Establishment expert, the blatant robbery provoked anger. A hot-tempered young man shouted, "We call you 'senior' out of respect, but don't push it! So what if you're one realm higher? With so many of us here, do you really think we fear you?"

"Brat, you've got nerve..."

The voice from the black mist laughed in fury. Lin Xuan sighed—youthful impulsiveness often led to disaster.

---

A wisp of black mist separated from the cloud, drifting slowly yet arriving with terrifying speed as it enveloped the defiant youth.

In moments, it wrapped around his body and constricted.

"Ah!"

A female cultivator screamed in horror. Within seconds, the previously spirited young man withered as if drained of all vitality, his body shriveling into a desiccated corpse.

"You... you're a demonic cultivator?"

Though inexperienced, the crowd recognized the sinister technique. Fear spread like wildfire among them.

While orthodox cultivators weren't necessarily virtuous, none matched the bloodthirsty cruelty of demonic practitioners.

"See? This is your fate if you disobey."

"Senior, this junior is a disciple of the Thundercloud Manor. Might you spare us?" Another youth stepped forward, presenting an identification token.

"Oh? Thundercloud Manor?"

"Indeed. If you could consider our sect's reputation—"

Before he finished, another wisp of black mist engulfed him. A grating laugh echoed from the clouds: "What do I care about the three great sects of Youzhou? I despise those who try to threaten me."

As the second desiccated corpse collapsed, the cultivators fell into terrified silence. This assailant bowed to neither soft pleas nor hard threats—not even the mightiest sects gave him pause.

The shrewder observers noted a telling detail: the robber remained hidden within the black mist, revealing nothing beyond his Foundation Establishment demonic cultivation. Even if they survived, seeking vengeance would be impossible without any identifying information.

Lin Xuan surveyed the crowd—expressions ranged from terror to suppressed fury, with some already resigned to submission.

"Useless fools," he muttered disdainfully.

He had no delusions of heroism. With his escape techniques, he could leave this danger zone easily. Even if the robber tried to stop him, revealing his true cultivation would deter any attack—no sane cultivator would risk fighting a peer over trivial loot.

As for the others? Their survival wasn't his concern.

This wasn't cruelty—the cultivation world operated on ruthless self-interest. Moreover, people must learn to rely on themselves rather than expect salvation.

Truthfully, their predicament stemmed from their own weakness. Had they united, even a Foundation Establishment expert couldn't withstand a thousand simultaneous low-level spells. Their divided, self-serving mindsets had doomed them.

Why should he save such people?

---

The silence didn't last. The raspy voice rang out again: "Well? Made your choice? Treasures or lives? Hesitate longer, and I'll start slaughtering."

His spiritual sense locked onto a nearby cultivator.

"Senior, please don't! Spare me—I'll hand them over!"

Trembling like a leaf, the pale-faced man reluctantly surrendered his possessions—five or six spirit stones, some talismans, and a few medicinal herbs. Hardly a fortune.

"Pathetic." The black mist snorted but kept its word: "You may go."

"Thank you, senior!"

The man cast one last longing look at his life's savings—paltry to a Foundation Establishment expert but everything to a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator.

With this precedent, surrenders came in waves. A few tried hiding valuables, but none escaped the robber's spiritual sense. Their blood soon stained the ground...
