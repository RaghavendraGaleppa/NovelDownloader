# Chapter 96: The Fourth Void Heaven  

### Third Void Heaven  

Nine towering steps pierced through the clouds.  

**Boom—**  

A raging river of ice and snow, resembling a hundred-zhang-long flood dragon, coiled around the steps with an aura of bone-chilling cold. It ascended effortlessly—  

Sixth step!  

Seventh step!  

Layer by layer, it advanced as if encountering no resistance at all.  

Before long, Zhang Jing, seated at the forefront of the Five Treasures Spirit River, slowly reached the tenth step.  

Not far ahead—  

**Crack! Crack!**  

A shadow resembling a dragon-horse hybrid gradually shifted, its gray-black hue rapidly fading to reveal a majestic body forged from molten gold.  

**Neigh—!**  

The dragon-horse charged forward with overwhelming ferocity—  

Only to be instantly engulfed by the violent torrent of the Five Treasures Spirit River.  

In less than half a breath, its body crumbled into dust.  

Zhang Jing raised an eyebrow.  

In terms of sheer presence, this dragon-horse was nearly on par with the white ape from before. Yet this time, it hadn’t lasted even half a breath against the Five Treasures Spirit River.  

The reason?  

Zhang Jing’s gaze drifted to the **Frostwind Banner**, floating ominously within the river and radiating terrifying fluctuations.  

All the high-grade magic artifacts had been forced into a corner, clashing and grinding against each other—  

And the culprit was none other than the Frostwind Banner.  

"Even as just a nascent treasure, its power far surpasses that of ordinary magic artifacts," Zhang Jing mused, a glimmer of realization in his eyes.  

The difference in the Five Treasures Spirit River’s might before and after incorporating the nascent treasure was staggering.  

A sudden thought struck him—  

*Should I take this opportunity in the Wanshen Small Void Heaven to replace all my magic artifacts with nascent treasures?*  

After all, they would better suit his needs once he advanced to the Foundation Establishment realm.  

But then he recalled the exorbitant prices of nascent treasures in the Wanshen Treasury.  

A sigh escaped his lips.  

*Too expensive!*  

Besides, if he truly had that much spiritual essence to spare, wouldn’t it be better spent on comprehending Dao Intent?  

He knew which priority outweighed the other.  

### Fourth Void Heaven  

An endless sea stretched before him.  

The moment Zhang Jing appeared, five pairs of astonished eyes locked onto him.  

He met their gazes without hesitation.  

The lively conversation among the five abruptly ceased.  

They exchanged glances before all eyes eventually settled on the man in the center—  

Their expressions seemed to say: *What a jinx!*  

"Are you… Junior Brother Zhang Jing?" A portly male cultivator broke the silence, addressing Zhang Jing.  

He already knew the answer—  

Yet he couldn’t resist hearing it confirmed.  

"Zhang Jing greets all senior brothers and sisters," Zhang Jing replied with a faint smile.  

Originally, he had planned to test how far the enhanced Five Treasures Spirit River—now bolstered by both a nascent treasure and perfected Dao Rhyme—could carry him in the Fourth Void Heaven’s trial.  

But it seemed that would have to wait.  

As he spoke, he stepped toward the group.  

Yet in the next moment, a peculiar expression flickered across his face.  

One of them looked familiar.  

The **Nether Python Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme** he possessed had come from this very person.  

*I wonder if this senior brother remembers me,* Zhang Jing mused inwardly.  

Truth be told, he was deeply grateful to this unnamed senior brother. Without that incomplete Dao Rhyme, it was uncertain whether Zhang Jing would have even qualified to enter the Wanshen Small Void Heaven.  

In the Dao Academy’s entrance trials, falling behind even a single step could dictate one’s entire cultivation future.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, your progress is astonishingly fast," one of them remarked.  

"Truly worthy of being called a genius!"  

As Zhang Jing approached, the group quickly warmed up to him.  

After brief introductions, he matched each of the five to their names on the Spiritual Essence Rankings for the Fourth Void Heaven.  

Among them were—  

Two from the Divine Firmament Inner Court, two from the Mystic Radiance Inner Court, and Senior Brother Song Ci—the very man who had escorted Zhang Jing to the Dao Academy back then.  

"Senior Brother Song, do you still remember me?" Zhang Jing asked with a smile.  

"How could I forget?" Song Ci chuckled, nostalgia coloring his tone.  

"Back then, I was the one who brought you from Yong’an Academy to the Dao Academy. Thinking back, it feels like just yesterday."  

"And now, without even realizing it, you’ve already surpassed me."  

A tinge of melancholy laced his voice.  

"Senior Brother flatters me," Zhang Jing said modestly.  

"This isn’t flattery," Song Ci sighed, placing a hand on Zhang Jing’s shoulder. "For a Qi Refinement cultivator like you to reach the Fourth Void Heaven, you must have grasped a sliver of Dao Intent. Once you leave, you’ll be able to forge a superior Dao Foundation."  

"Your path to immortality is assured."  

"Unlike me, who barely managed a white-grade Dao Foundation. Two hundred years from now, I’ll return to dust."  

Zhang Jing fell silent.  

He knew what a white-grade Dao Foundation meant—  

A foundation built upon incomplete Dao Rhyme, devoid of any potential for growth.  

His gaze shifted to the other four.  

Those still lingering in the Fourth Void Heaven were likely all early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators with similarly flawed foundations.  

After a moment’s thought, Zhang Jing offered, "Senior Brother, don’t lose heart. Now that you’re in the Wanshen Small Void Heaven, there’s still hope. If you can perfect your Dao Rhyme, your foundation will naturally evolve into a crimson-grade one."  

Song Ci managed a weak smile.  

"Then I’ll take your words as a blessing."  

But in truth, if perfecting Dao Rhyme were so easy, he wouldn’t have settled for a white-grade foundation in the first place.  

Moreover, historical records showed that only a rare few had ever managed to evolve their Dao Foundations within the Wanshen Small Void Heaven.  

Song Ci harbored no illusions of being among that elite group.  

Half an hour later, the five senior brothers and sisters bid Zhang Jing farewell, flying off the island and plunging into the sea.  

The island they stood on—the only landmass in the Fourth Void Heaven—spanned a mere hundred li, completely devoid of demonic spirits.  

All such creatures lurked beneath the boundless waves, as Zhang Jing had learned from Song Ci.  

Silence reclaimed the island.  

Zhang Jing lifted his gaze to the nine towering steps that pierced the heavens, a blazing determination igniting in his eyes.  

*Time to test my limits.*  

Meanwhile, deep beneath the icy waters—  

Five figures huddled together in the dim light, their spiritual senses abuzz with urgent discussion.  

"Brothers and sisters, the worst-case scenario has come to pass! Who could’ve imagined Junior Brother Zhang Jing would reach the Fourth Void Heaven so quickly? Being overtaken by a Qi Refinement cultivator—we’ll be immortalized in the Dao Academy’s records for all the wrong reasons!"  

"What should we do?"  

"Advance to the Fifth Void Heaven as soon as possible, of course! That way, we can at least save some face."  

"Nonsense! Wasn’t that our goal even before Zhang Jing arrived?"  

"What I mean is—"  

"From now on, we hunt demonic spirits together. Pool our resources to exchange for Enlightenment Tea. Only by perfecting our Dao Rhyme and evolving our foundations can we truly leave Zhang Jing behind."  

"But how long will that take? By then, Zhang Jing might have already left us in the dust. We’d never live it down."  

"No need to worry about that."  

"Exactly. Zhang Jing has likely grasped a trace of Dao Intent. Progressing further in Dao Intent won’t be easy. And remember—he can only enhance his spells with Dao Intent, while we have our Dao Foundations!"  

"Wait!"  

Song Ci, who had remained silent until now, suddenly interjected—  

"If that’s the case, why not invite Zhang Jing to join us?"  

The other four fell silent.  

Their reluctance was palpable.  

### Fourth Void Heaven, Seventh Step  

A fox-like creature, half the height of a man, lay curled on the ground.  

Its fiery red fur was dusted with frost, its human-like face twisted in agony. Occasionally, its intelligent eyes would flicker toward Zhang Jing, pleading silently.  

Zhang Jing remained expressionless.  

Without hesitation, he directed the Five Treasures Spirit River to sweep over the creature.  

A blood-curdling wail pierced the air—  

**+5,000 Spiritual Essence!**  

**[Spiritual Essence: 43,310]**  

**Pant— Pant—**  

Only now did Zhang Jing allow himself to relax, his battered form bearing witness to the struggle.  

He eyed the corpse warily.  

This was the first time he had encountered such a demonic spirit—  

Frail in body, yet wielding spells of terrifying potency. Most alarming was the unfamiliar Dao Rhyme it had manifested in battle.  

A single lapse in focus, and endless distracting thoughts would ignite within Zhang Jing’s mind, burning his spiritual sense with pale white flames.  

Thankfully, the **Crimson Divine Radiance** had shielded him.  

Even so, it had taken everything he had to slay this creature.  

Zhang Jing glanced at the two remaining steps above before shaking his head and descending.  

There was little point in pressing further.  

At his current strength, he might barely clear the eighth step—  

But the ninth?  

Impossible.  

"Two paths remain," he analyzed coldly. "Either comprehend Dao Intent or strengthen the Five Treasures Spirit River with more nascent treasures."  

The choice was obvious.  

Dao Intent was his primary objective for entering the Wanshen Small Void Heaven.  

And unlike the Third Void Heaven, where demonic spirits were scarce—  

Zhang Jing’s gaze swept across the boundless ocean below.  

Countless demonic auras twinkled like stars in its depths.
