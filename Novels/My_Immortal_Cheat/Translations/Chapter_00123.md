# Chapter 123: Ancestor Zhou

The Saint Demon extended a jade-like finger, and lines of glowing runes drifted out. He intended to capture Zhou Tian and study him slowly.

“Because of a few of my Zhou family’s Old Ancestors.”

Zhou Tian only spoke these words as the runes were about to touch his body. At the same time, he deactivated his Undying System, focusing his gaze on the Saint Demon before him.

Zhou Tian had seen descriptions of several of his family’s Old Ancestors in their family records. They were indeed eternal paragons, all formidable cultivators at the Heavenly Venerate realm.

“Oh?”

A hint of surprise flashed in the Saint Demon’s eyes, followed by a thoughtful look. He lightly clenched his hand, retracting his divine ability.

The Zhou family’s Old Ancestors were on the same level as the Buddhist Lords of Luotian Temple, the Dao Ancestors of the Dao Alliance, and the Supreme Saints of Daluo Academy—all Heavenly Venerate-level figures. Ostensibly, there were only three, but whether there were hidden existences beneath the surface, no one knew.

Reaching the Heavenly Venerate realm meant entering an entirely different world. When it came to such figures, the Saint Demon dared not treat them lightly. He wanted to hear what Zhou Tian could possibly say.

“Do you know what my physique is?” Zhou Tian asked, his expression much calmer.

“Hundred Apertures Blocked, a natural-born good-for-nothing.”

The Saint Demon had investigated Zhou Tian. The reason he initially targeted Zhou Tian was precisely because of his physique; he couldn’t cultivate at all and possessed no strength, which meant much less trouble.

“No, no,” Zhou Tian denied. “While it is Hundred Apertures Blocked, it’s not a natural-born good-for-nothing physique. Instead, it’s a supremely powerful physique. If I had been born into an ordinary family, then I truly would have been a natural-born good-for-nothing, but I was born into the Zhou family.”

“Coincidentally, among my Zhou family’s Old Ancestors, one possessed the Hundred Apertures Blocked physique, but this physique is rarely seen in ten thousand years. He sought a successor but failed to find one—and that’s when I was born.”

Zhou Tian spoke slowly. Though he was stark naked, it didn’t hinder his train of thought in the slightest. He was used to being nude for periods every day. Stories like this were countless in web novels from his previous life; he didn’t need to rack his brain to think them up, he could just use them.

The Saint Demon frowned slightly. Someone with Hundred Apertures Blocked was a supremely powerful physique? Why did he not know this information? Even if it required immense resources to cultivate, he shouldn’t be completely ignorant. Moreover, countless years had passed since the Zhou family ancestors rose to prominence, so how could there not have been a single person with the Hundred Apertures Blocked physique appear?

But perhaps not. After all, the Zhou family was a family-based power. If an Old Ancestor took a disciple who wasn’t part of their family, it could be troublesome. The Saint Demon’s mind raced, countless pieces of information flashing through it.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian continued, “The reason I can revive is because that Old Ancestor cast a method on me that can pull me out of the flow of time and bring me back to the moment before my death.”

“Is that so?” The Saint Demon’s eyes were deep, with flecks of golden light swirling in his pupils, dazzling like a great sun. He scrutinized Zhou Tian inside and out but found no trace of any divine ability on his person.

He had already touched upon time, but merely touching it was a completely different concept from plucking someone from the River of Time. However, he also didn’t know if Heavenly Venerate-level figures truly possessed such a divine ability. He had never truly interacted with a Heavenly Venerate. Although the higher one’s cultivation, the greater the impact on time, making it harder to pull someone out, given that Zhou Tian was currently just a mortal, this possibility wasn't entirely out of the question.

“Then why do you still have no cultivation whatsoever?” The Saint Demon’s eyes returned to their calm state, his dark pupils placid.

“Because the Hundred Apertures Blocked physique requires activation, and the materials are incredibly precious. Even my Zhou family hasn’t managed to collect them all yet.”

“Such as?” What materials could possibly be so hard for even the Zhou family to acquire? He didn’t believe it.

“The Heart of the World, Grandmist Purple Qi, and so on.” Zhou Tian spouted off effortlessly. He had many more impressive-sounding titles like those.

The Saint Demon was silent for a moment. He considered himself a prominent figure in the cultivation world, and while he was still some distance from the peak of the pyramid, he had surpassed most people. Yet, after talking with Zhou Tian today, he felt like a country bumpkin who had never heard of anything.

“How do you prove it?” The Saint Demon asked the most crucial question. Zhou Tian’s explanation sounded plausible, but he still needed to resolve one final issue to prove the veracity of his words.

Zhou Tian smiled. All his previous buildup was for this very question from the Saint Demon.

“My Zhou family’s Old Ancestor not only arranged the revival method on me but also another divine ability. Through this divine ability, I can borrow his power, but due to my own limitations, the duration is limited. Furthermore, I can use this method to call for his aid, but only in truly life-or-death situations, such as encountering someone who can interfere with time, or if I am imprisoned.”

“And since I’ve just been revived once, I need to recover energy, so it will take some time before I can use it. I think this should be enough to prove whether my claim is true.”

The Saint Demon’s eyes flickered. Calling for aid from a Heavenly Venerate-level figure? If Zhou Tian was telling the truth, then he might be in danger. He didn’t believe he could escape with his life from the pursuit of a Heavenly Venerate.

“Indeed, that can prove it.” The Saint Demon said. The Nine Provinces were protected by a powerful formation. Although it was jointly set up by the various major powers of the Nine Provinces, for safety, the means left behind were not enough for Heavenly Venerate-level figures to cross directly. To break through the realm and arrive, even Heavenly Venerates within the Nine Provinces had to pay a great price. This explained why Zhou Tian hadn't called for aid earlier but instead chose to talk big, trying to make him believe he truly had a trump card. And the Saint Demon didn’t want to face the pursuit of a Heavenly Venerate—that would be a certain death scenario. Having Zhou Tian prove it was the best choice.

“Alright then, wait for me for a while. I just used up the power left on me by the Old Ancestor, and it needs to recover.”

“How long?” The Saint Demon didn’t say much more. Zhou Tian had already mentioned that if he were to use it, there would be a waiting period.

“Twelve hours at most.” Zhou Tian opened his Undying System and checked. There were about six or seven hours until his next revival count refreshed.

The Saint Demon nodded, his eyes sparkling as he looked at Zhou Tian. “You’d better be telling the truth, or else I’ll show you what true torment is!”

As he spoke, a cute little fairy fluttered its wings, hopped onto his shoulder, and sat down with a plop. Its crystalline wings stilled, and it sighed contentedly, looking utterly adorable.

However, Zhou Tian felt a chill run down his spine. He couldn’t help but recall the despicable individuals from the Shadow Cult he had just encountered. Then, looking at these adorable little fairies, the stark contrast made him extremely uncomfortable. The Saint Demon’s preferences were truly peculiar.
