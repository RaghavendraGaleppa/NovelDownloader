Chapter 438: Reaching for the Stars, Forging the Immortal Path

The magnificent scenery of the twenty-six peaks of the Primordial Sect suddenly unfolded before their eyes.

High above the nine heavens, seven floating immortal mountains drifted like buoys amidst the waves. Atop their peaks, Black Tortoise statues breathed in and out vast amounts of cloud qi. The surfaces of the mountains were covered with profound Dao patterns, flowing with azure and golden light under the morning sun.

These seven floating mountains were naturally the residence of the True Monarchs.

Below the sea of clouds, seventy-two spiritual waterfalls cascaded down from various peaks, transforming into dense spiritual mist at a height of ten thousand zhang.牵引ed by the mountain protection array, the mist formed countless spiraling spiritual energy vortices.

In the distance, the Crimson Flame Peak was entirely crimson red. The radiance from the erupting terrestrial fire dyed half the sky a deep scarlet.

Even more震撼 was the main peak, the "Primordial Heavenly Palace." The palace, carved from a single block of innate spiritual jade, floated above the sea of clouds. The bronze chimes hanging from the eaves rang out without wind, their sound waves rippling through the sea of clouds within a hundred-mile radius.

Xu Yunfan swept his gaze over the crowd.

"From today onward, all of you will cultivate on the True Martial Peak. Remember, you must not go to—"

Before he could finish, a sudden change occurred!

Xuezhen's body suddenly burst with a piercing blood light. The枯荣 True Qi violently clashed with the spiritual qi of the Taihua Realm, blowing him into a bloody figure.

The other old monsters also let out miserable screams.

Like a long drought meeting sweet rain, these腐朽 bodies that had barely survived in the Divine Martial Realm for two hundred years, relying only on the meager energy of the earth veins and mundane medicinal herbs to barely maintain their vitality, suddenly encountered such pure spiritual qi of heaven and earth. It was like a long-dried, cracked wasteland suddenly being washed by a torrential downpour. Their dry meridians and decaying flesh were simply unable to withstand such violent spiritual impact!

"Focus your minds!"

Yunfan's sleeves moved without wind. The True Martial power around him surged like a river, instantly condensing into a Black Tortoise phantom entangled with a snake. As the phantom raised its head and roared, it opened a green light shield about half an acre around everyone, completely blocking the violently surging spiritual qi of heaven and earth.

He had long anticipated this situation. The spiritual qi he was guiding now was the diluted "Primordial Spirit Qi."

Twelve specks of azure light appeared at Xu Yunfan's fingertips. Driven by his Foundation Establishment cultivation, the True Martial power condensed into tangible spiritual light. With a light turn of his wrist, the azure light moved like a living creature, accurately penetrating the brow spirit portals of the twelve old monsters.

The moment the spiritual light entered their bodies, the meridians of their枯朽 flesh immediately浮现ed the circulation patterns of the Hundred Meridians Penetrating Art. This was the shadow of a dantani he had ignited at their sea of qi using True Martial power as a guide.

The methods of a Foundation Establishment cultivator were no longer comparable to those of mortals. The acupoints that required a Foundation Establishment Pill for ordinary Qi Condensation disciples to open were nothing more than a snap of the fingers for him.

Xu Yunfan finally understood why, despite its miraculous effects, the Foundation Establishment Pill was considered a niche item. If one had some connections, or simply waited for the time the Primordial Sect opened its doors to teach disciples, a Foundation Establishment True Person could casually point a finger to reshape their internal meridians. What need would there be for a Foundation Establishment Pill?

It was just one of the upward channels left for the struggling lower-level disciples.

After the azure light entered their bodies, it began to evolve on its own, outlining a complete cycle within their meridians, like carving a new water system on a dry riverbed.

The old monsters' turbid eyes filled with shock. They could clearly feel the chaotic and decaying qi within their bodies being awakened by this wisp of azure light.

Xu Yunfan withdrew his hand seal and stood with his hands behind his back. The condensed power had not yet dissipated, and the residual Black Tortoise cloud patterns flickered faintly in his sleeves.

"This is the method of continuing the meridians and building bridges. All of you must remember not to remove the newly formed spiritual meridians and organs within your bodies. These spiritual nodes evolved from flesh and blood are the key to continuing your immortal path. If you damage them recklessly, you will be like a tree with severed roots, with no possibility of nurturing meridians again. Your immortal path will be severed here."

His gaze swept over the crowd. These old monsters who had struggled in the Divine Martial Realm for two hundred years had long since pushed mundane martial arts to the extreme. Every inch of their bones had been tempered a thousand times, and every drop of their essence blood contained astonishing vitality. Now, nourished by spiritual qi, they were like withered trees meeting spring. The physical potential that had been pushed to the limit was焕ing with astonishing vitality under the scouring of spiritual qi.

"With your martial foundation, coupled with spiritual nourishment, extending your lifespan by another hundred years is not a difficult matter."

Xu Yunfan's fingertips flowed with azure light. "There is no need to worry about the depletion of your lifespan. However..."

His tone shifted, turning cold. "I know you all have a very good habit of research. If anyone damages their spiritual meridians without permission, let alone their immortal path being severed, this physical body that has been tempered a thousand times will also turn to dust under the backlash of spiritual qi. Do not let it be that before you even become an immortal, you yourselves perish and vanish."

The old monsters' hearts chilled upon hearing this. They could clearly feel the newly formed spiritual nodes slowly extending tendrils with the beating of their hearts, just like seedlings stretching out, perfectly blending with the originally tempered flesh and blood. The martial foundation they had diligently cultivated over these two hundred years had already cast a very solid foundation for them.

Before his words had faded, the blood pill under Xuezhen's purple robe had already begun to circulate on its own, sending out layers of spiritual ripples within the new meridians.

Three breaths later, Xuezhen was the first to open his eyes.

The blood pill under his purple robe had turned liquid, forming a small cycle within the newborn meridians. He trembled as he touched his cheek, where there was a deep wound that revealed bone, which was now slowly being repaired by spiritual qi.

"Do not practice on your own for the first three months," Xu Yunfan said calmly. "Come to this green shield every day at the hour of Chen. After three months, once the internal meridians have grown, stepping into Qi Condensation will be a natural consequence. If you come late, even exploding your body and dying would be a light punishment."

After settling everyone down, Xu Yunfan gently shook his sleeve. Black Tortoise cloud patterns spread out on the green stone floor of the hall, forming an array.

A wisp of clear light appeared at Xu Yunfan's fingertips. True Martial power outlined the trajectory of the Big Dipper in the void. As his wrist turned lightly, he formed a hand seal and pointed into the void. Seven points of starlight suddenly lit up, connecting in the night sky to form the Black Tortoise constellation entangled with a snake.

The moment the starlight fell, the array patterns faintly visible on the ground stone responded, actually dropping specks of starlight within the one-acre green shield.

"Condense!"

He lightly tapped the eye of the array with his sword finger, and the array immediately began to rotate. A spiritual gathering array that would usually take an array master a month to set up was now under his control like an extension of his arm.

This was not due to his profound attainments in array formations, but rather the unique talent granted by the Attribute Panel, which allowed him to intuitively grasp every key point of the array's operation, like a butcher disassembling an ox, penetrating to the very essence of the Dao of Arrays. Although he was only at the入门 level of the Dao of Arrays, with the assistance of the Attribute Panel, his understanding of arrays far surpassed that of those array masters who merely copied patterns.

From this point, knowing the reason behind it already allowed him to defeat most array cultivators.

As he continuously adjusted, the falling starlight became increasingly brilliant, actually condensing into three pillars of light within the array. Xu Yunfan gently shook his sleeve, and the Black Tortoise cloud patterns followed the array patterns, harmonizing the light of the sun, moon, and stars into a gentle spiritual mist. Only then was it complete.

If array cultivators who merely copied formations saw this scene, they would probably be dumbfounded. The spiritual qi ratio that they needed to repeatedly adjust was, for Xu Yunfan, merely a matter of a slight thought.

He looked at the crowd, who were feeling much better and even showing expressions of enjoyment, and slowly began to speak.
