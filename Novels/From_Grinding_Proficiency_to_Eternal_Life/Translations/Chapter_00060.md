Chapter 60: Minor Success in Bone Tempering

He finally understood clearly why, after perfecting the training of tendons, bones, and skin, there remained a realm known as the "Three External Unifications."

If one cultivated the complete Iron Bridge Suppresses the Pass manual, achieving the Three External Unifications might have been relatively easier. After all, most of the internal forces were similar, and the twisting and unification would naturally follow.

However, how many martial arts in this world are truly flawless? Most excel in one aspect while lacking in another.

Thus, this realm represents a fusion of understanding, gathering the blood and qi of the entire body, and unifying the three into one.

The method for the Three External Unifications is particularly precious, especially the Pure Yang One Qi Gong that the Dao Sect's elder, Bi Sheng, once presented. Within the realm of the Three External Unifications, it stands as the most top-tier martial art in the world.

Li Haomiao is truly my benefactor.

Xu Yunfan sighed with emotion. If only he had known, he would have squeezed more information out of him earlier.

At the summit of Jiyun Mountain, the violent winds tore through the night sky. A peerless beauty, dressed in a white dress adorned with light gauze and a blood-colored petal mark between her eyebrows, walked slowly toward the peak, her jade-like feet bare.

The surrounding snow and wind, within a zhang of the woman, were blocked by an inexplicable aura, turning into rising steam that quickly dissipated into the air.

Her bright, star-like eyes searched the snow-covered peak. Finally, her gaze fixed slightly, and she turned to walk down the mountain for a while.

Eventually, she stopped beside a small mound formed by piled snow. With a slight lift of her fair hand, an invisible force rose from nothing, rapidly expanding into a tornado about ten meters wide, sweeping away all the snow before her.

As the snow cleared, the woman finally saw that beneath the mound, a person was curled up.

It was Li Miaoyun, who had once fought Li Haomiao. Her qi had been completely sealed by Li Haomiao's true blood, turning her into an ordinary person who had frozen to death on Jiyun Mountain.

"Senior Sister..."

The woman stared fixedly at Li Miaoyun's corpse for a long time before a complex, mocking expression finally appeared on her face.

"Li Miaoyun, Li Miaoyun. You competed with me from childhood, from a cloth doll to a precious treasure, all of which you snatched from my hands. Yet now, you have ended up in such a state."

She lingered for a long time before turning her head to look at Zhang Shuyang, who was clad in armor and leaning on the long sword at his waist. He was striding quickly up the mountain to the summit.

Upon seeing the woman, his eyes glanced at the Li Miaoyun beside him. His pupils contracted sharply, but his expression quickly returned to normal as he nodded slightly.

"Saintess Wan, now that we have found Saintess Li's trace, and the Prince of Yan has been taken away by the Dao Sect's Bi Sheng, I must return to Yujing to report to His Majesty."

Wan Miaoyin nodded slightly without a word.

Zhang Shuyang cupped his fists, turned, and left without another word.

With Li Miaoyun's death, the position of Saintess of the Celestial Pivot Sect would naturally fall to Wan Miaoyin. However, unlike Li Miaoyun, who fought for everything, Wan Miaoyin had a cold and detached personality and was relatively easy to get along with.

Zhang Shuyang was naturally in a good mood. As for Li Miaoyun's death, if it weren't for the slight connection to himself, he would have wanted to clap his hands and laugh out loud, saying, "She died well!"

Wan Miaoyin stood for a long time before reaching out to lift Li Miaoyun's body.

The moment her fingers touched Li Miaoyun, her movements paused slightly. She saw that Li Miaoyun's body, like a porcelain vase, had a clear crack appearing at the point of contact.

Her gaze sharpened, and she saw countless cracks rapidly spreading over Li Miaoyun's body, covering her entirely.

Immediately after, like pearls falling to the ground, the countless cracks shattered with a bang, turning into shards of ice that covered the ground.

A visible mist of qi seeped out from within.

"This is... Li Miaoyun's Primordial Essence!"

Wan Miaoyin's eyes widened. Before she could react, this wisp of Primordial Essence spontaneously rushed into her.

The Saintess of the Celestial Pivot Sect nurtures essence from the same source. This wisp of condensed Primordial Essence would naturally enter her body.

For a time, the aura around her grew even more profound and ethereal, deep and unpredictable.

After a long while, she opened her eyes and looked down at the shards all over the ground, a strange expression on her face.

"Senior Sister, Senior Sister. Who would have thought that you would pave a path for me with your own life..."

To receive the fruit, one must understand the cause.

To achieve success in qi cultivation, she now had the加持 of Li Miaoyun's wisp of Primordial Essence. Her own foundation grew significantly, and as the essence nourished her, her physical quality was also rapidly increasing.

Cultivating the martial path this way would naturally see progress by leaps and bounds.

However, to advance further later, she would need to sever the obsession within this wisp of Primordial Essence.

To sever it, she would need to deal with the person who killed her.

"You really... have given me a difficult problem."

As she pondered this, she suddenly looked up, gazing toward the direction of Beiye City, a ripple appearing in her expression.

"There is another person?"

Nearly a month had passed since the day Lu Yi gave him the Divine Weapon Order. Xu Yunfan had been burying himself in diligent training, practicing tirelessly without a hint of slack.

His identity could not withstand scrutiny. If discovered, he would likely face a full-scale hunt by the entire Great Zhou Dynasty's officials. He naturally needed sufficient strength to deal with it.

Iron Bridge Suppresses the Pass: Bone Tempering Chapter had finally reached the Minor Success stage this morning.

The progress of Flying Leg and Red Copper Vajra Body Cloak Hammering was also gratifyingly close to Perfection. According to this rate of cultivation, within a year at most, he could push the tendon and skin training to the Perfection realm.

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan glanced at his attribute panel.

'Iron Bridge Suppresses the Pass 0/1000 (Minor Success)

Special Effects: Hard Bones Forging Body, Thousand-Jun Bone Bridge, Body Contains Hard Force, Hard Bones Suppress the Pass'

The most important special effects were "Hard Bones Suppress the Pass" and "Thousand-Jun Bone Bridge." The Bone Bridge referred to the spine as the main support. In his memory, the Iron Bridge Suppresses the Pass Bone Tempering Chapter was simply monstrous.

Every day, one must use secret medicine to wash the body, constantly reconstructing the bones within.

Now that it has reached Minor Success, the load-bearing axis of the bones has been reconstructed, and the spine behind has been pulled taut. Combined with the physical quality of perfected tendons and skin, he could support a ten-thousand-jin gate with his arms without it falling.

His strength had taken a great leap forward, delighting him immensely. He had finally made his decision.

"Master Lu, I'm off!"

On this day, spring was warm and flowers were blooming. The snow on Jiyun Mountain had mostly melted, leaving only a small patch at the peak still standing firm.

Xu Yunfan, carrying the War Drum瓮金 Hammer on his back and dressed in a black border-trimmed tight-fitting outfit, came to the blacksmith shop to bid farewell to Old Man Lu.

He held the two best jugs of wine from the Longfeng Tavern in his hands. As he spoke, he placed the jugs by the furnace.

Lu Yi, who was burying his head and flexing his muscles to hammer and forge iron, looked up at Xu Yunfan, a smile appearing on his face as he nodded slightly.

"Go. I'd like to see what kind of name you can make for yourself in this vast martial world."

As he spoke, Lu Yi put down his hammer, broke the seals on the jugs, and poured two bowls of wine. Instantly, the aroma of wine filled the entire blacksmith shop. The workers in the shop couldn't help but turn their heads, looking on with mouths watering.

Xu Yunfan looked at the wine bowl Lu Yi handed over and smiled as he drank it down with him.

After finishing the bowl in one go, Lu Yi wiped his beard, full of emotion.

"The Drunken Branch from the Longfeng Tavern is truly captivating!"
