# Chapter 293: The Purple-Robed Night Visit and the Beauty’s Forced Marriage? An Alliance of Interests for Wealth and Scheming

Fu Dachun sent Li Xian and Nangong Liuli to the shore, flattered them a few times, then retreated to the cabin to steer the ship back to the island.

The carriage was parked by the shore. The journey was long, and Li Xian was efficient and decisive. After getting the carriage ready, he set off toward Peach Blossom Town. The sun set in the west, and the sky darkened. The wild path had no lights, relying only on the dim moonlight for illumination.

Nangong Liuli let out a soft breath, slumping in the carriage. She felt extremely tired and hungry. For breakfast, she had eaten pickled vegetable and plain porridge, while lunch and dinner were both dry biscuits. Although she didn't need to move during the journey—and couldn't move anyway—she felt inexplicably exhausted.

"This cloak covers my figure, but it makes me so hot. That scoundrel Hua Wucoo is full of bad ideas, deliberately making me look狼狈 (embarrassing me), wanting to see me make a fool of myself. If I get the chance, I'll give him a good beating."

Nangong Liuli leaned against the carriage wall, her cheeks puffed up, her thoughts wandering. Recalling the bee farm and the fruit orchard... she sat sideways on the horse. Although she didn't show anything unusual, she couldn't help feeling unbearably shy.

A gentle breeze blew, lifting the carriage curtain. She looked out the window and suddenly thought of something else, her head heating up: "If... if just like this... Wucoo suddenly wanted to bully me..." She tried to suppress these wild thoughts, but they inevitably spread.

Her cloud-like hair hung like a waterfall, her beauty like a flower. Her toes rubbed slightly, her heart rising and falling. All these feelings were truly hard to describe.

In a daze.

They had already returned to the Ox Residence.

It was the hour of the Boar (9-11 PM), and there were still pedestrians on the streets, with night market vendors shouting and selling their goods. Li Xian lifted the carriage curtain, and Nangong Liuli was startled, asking in embarrassment, "You... what are you doing?"

Her tone was very strange. The final "ma" (particle) lacked any resolute resistance.

Li Xian said, "We're home!"

Nangong Liuli's cheeks flushed red, "Oh, oh." Li Xian helped her out of the carriage, entered the Ox Residence, and bolted the door.

She let out a breath of turbid air; this matter was finally over. She had been inspecting outside for a whole day, her legs and feet sore and numb, her whole body exhausted, covered in sweat and grime. She urged, "Help me undo this."

Li Xian asked confusedly, "Undo what?"

Nangong Liuli's slightly calmed heart immediately panicked again, stammering, "You... you..." Her mind raced, her beautiful eyes flashing, both shy and afraid. She quickly said, "You promised me you wouldn't take the opportunity to bully me."

Li Xian smiled, "I am a man of my word; what I said naturally counts." Nangong Liuli breathed a slight sigh of relief, yet felt a hint of disappointment. Li Xian continued with a smile, "But I remember, Liuli-jie said it was 'outside' and wouldn't take the opportunity to bully you. But now we are 'inside', the situation is different."

Nangong Liuli was stunned, her pearly teeth biting her red lips, glaring at Li Xian. She thought her eyes were filled with killing intent and anger, but they were clearly like water, like waves. Li Xian added, "Liuli-jie foresaw this early on, deliberately not making the statement absolute, deliberately waiting for me to bully you, isn't that right?"

Nangong Liuli bit her red lips, her gaze shifting, "You... you... cunning brat, I... I didn't, don't talk nonsense." She didn't know how to answer. She thought that a slip of the tongue had caused this situation. But if she asked her heart, her heartbeat was much faster than usual.

She said again, "You despicable little thief, you bully me because I can't move easily. If you have the ability, let me go, and I'll beat you until your teeth are all over the floor, ah! You're serious?!"

While she was speaking, she was already picked up by Li Xian. Li Xian laughed, "When paths meet on a narrow road, the victor is king. I won't undo it, what can you do to me? It'll be hard for me to find my teeth all over the floor tonight. But Liuli-jie, you are going to suffer."

Nangong Liuli cursed, "Despicable, shameless." She struggled for a moment but couldn't escape the predicament.

Li Xian said, "Alright, you dare scold me? You're in my hands now, and still so arrogant?"

Nangong Liuli seemed angry, but actually charming, hiding a provocation as she said, "You bully me because my hands and feet are inconvenient, but even so, I have the ability to make you surrender."

Unwilling to show weakness, confronting each other. A battle ensued, let's see who wins. Nangong Liuli was the daughter of a noble family, her temperament gentle but with a big sister's style, but her mouth was extremely tough, so she had suffered a lot because of it.

The next day.

Li Xian practiced the "Wraith-Slaying Spear" in the morning,挥洒 (wielding) the spear light, accumulating [40] proficiency points. His spear Dao grew increasingly profound. Feeling progress every day, he felt infinite motivation.

He practiced until his Qi lake rippled, his body blood like a rainbow, and his Yang energy burst forth. The slanting sun shone on him, and a colorful aura burst from his shoulders. It was a beautiful sight.

[Proficiency +1]

"Scouting the Grass to Startle the Ghost," "Broken Crow Defeats the Moon," "Ripping Open the Belly"... The spear light flashed frequently, and his spear Dao gained further improvement. Li Xian was full of energy. He practiced until around the hour of the Dragon (7-9 AM), seeing the sky gradually brighten, so he put away his spear and pushed the door open.

He bought a pan-fried cake, took a bite, oil sizzled, and the meaty fragrance filled his mouth. The island was rich in flowers, blooming in all four seasons, and floral products were used for food. The oil in the pan-fried cake was rich, inevitably greasy. But mixed with a certain flower petal, it just right removed the greasiness.

Li Xian suddenly came into a windfall, so he was quite generous with his spending. Along the way, passing by merchant stalls and small shops, if he saw exotic food, he would casually buy and taste it. Flower sugar pastries, flower shortbread, fried flower stems... the tastes varied, and he ate with great relish.

In Peach Blossom Town, there were places of pleasure like the "Red Pavilion" and the "Women's Building," where the Flower Cage Gate disciples gathered all day. The courtesans in the buildings were all captured from other places, with the sound of zithers day and night, their situations miserable.

Li Xian passed by the Red Pavilion and the Women's Building, recognized by the disciples inside, who invited him upstairs for a drink. Li Xian smiled and declined, walking straight away.

The matters of the "Bee Farm" and "Fruit Orchard" had spread throughout the island, and the reputation of "Hua Wucoo" was even more renowned. It had surpassed Wang Changjiang and Wolf Blade.

Leaving Peach Blossom Town, the view opened up, and the terraced fields were arranged in order. Common people could be seen bending over to work in the fields, old oxen plowing, tireless.

Li Xian suddenly felt a sense of emotion: "The sea has turned into mulberry fields, a hundred years in a flash. These fields are still these fields, but the farmers plowing them have changed from generation to generation." He thought of last night's events.

He was strong and vigorous, young and full of spirit, naturally surpassing Nangong Liuli. But he felt a slight loss in his body, though imperceptible, it was indeed there. So, seeing the farmers in the fields, he remembered the old saying, "There are only worn-out oxen, no worn-out fields," and had this emotion.

"I'm worrying unnecessarily. With my physique, a little food will replenish the loss. Moreover, the 'Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity and Meeting Yang Meridian' can strengthen the five organs, the 'Food Consumption' skill can replenish losses, and the 'Pure Yang Body' can strengthen the physique... with the combination of many effects, am I afraid of others?"

Sailing into the inner island.

He suddenly felt the island was very lively, with quite a few new faces. Shi Yufei saw Li Xian from a distance, waved and shouted, "Wucoo, come here."

Li Xian walked over quickly and said, "Chief Envoy Shi!"

Shi Yufei nodded and smiled, saying to the side, "This is Hua Wucoo, a new talent of my Flower Cage Gate. A very fine young man. Wucoo... this is the master of the 'Plate Moon Manor' from the Flower Water Prefecture, Master Zhang De. This is Elder Sheng Yunfei of the 'Li Mountain Sword Sect' from the Huaiyin Prefecture..."

Li Xian greeted them one by one, feeling quite surprised. When looking at Elder Sheng of the "Li Mountain Sword Sect," he couldn't help thinking of "Chu Liuqing" and "Shan Guyun." The Dongran Lake and Li Mountain are both in the Huaiyin Prefecture, making them close neighbors. This meeting was surprisingly harmonious. He immediately figured it out: "Chu Liuqing took Shan Guyun, which did slap the Li Mountain Sword Sect's face. But she didn't reveal her 'Candle Cult' identity, nor did she misuse the 'Flower Cage Gate' background. This Li Mountain Sword Sect Elder Sheng Yunfei probably doesn't know the inside story. And since he can appear here, he probably isn't a good person."

Shi Yufei said, "These几位 (several) martial前辈 (elders) are here to purchase flower companions. They are both regular customers and honored guests. You can get to know them briefly. In the future, if you have difficulties outside, you might be able to find them."

Li Mountain Sword Sect Elder Sheng Yunfei laughed, "Hahaha, your sect has produced a true dragon. Hua little friend is very handsome. With this appearance and demeanor, it's hard to find someone like this even in my Li Mountain Sword Sect. I'm afraid that if you crook your finger, the girls will chase you all the way to the flower field, right?"

Zhang De stroked his beard and smiled, "Hmm, not bad, not bad, truly a fine appearance!"

Li Xian smiled, "I dare not accept the praise. This little one is just helping Chief Envoy Shi with some odds and ends."

The crowd chatted with each other, the topics varied. From the conversation, Li Xian gradually understood the situation.

Originally...

The Water Altar is a secret and important place for the Flower Cage Gate. Elder Sheng of the Li Mountain Sword Sect, Master Zhang De of the Plate Moon Manor... all came to purchase "flower companions." They boarded flower boats and were sent to the Water Altar. The water route was winding and extremely complex, requiring seven days and seven nights.

Although they were not disciples of the Flower Cage Gate, because they often came and went, they were already very familiar with the island. They had even purchased mansions on the island, privately keeping beautiful women and companions, and occasionally came here for a vacation when they had free time.

The Li Mountain Sword Sect was a famous orthodox sect. Elder Sheng Yunfei held the position of Elder, enjoyed a good reputation outside, and was known as the 'White Cloud Sword Master,' meaning as pure and ethereal as white clouds, and keeping himself clean. Legend had it that early on, after his beloved wife died, he swore he would never marry again. Who would know that this man secretly loved women extremely and was extremely hypocritical. He revealed in his speech that although the Li Mountain Sword Sect was a famous sect with the title 'Gentleman's Sword Sect,' there were actually several people like him.

Li Xian's face was calm, chatting and laughing with them, but he was secretly surprised, lamenting that he had gained more martial world experience. Shi Yufei specifically introduced him, helping Li Xian connect with people and build his reputation, showing his initial prominence. Friendship between gentlemen is desirable, but being in the same boat makes the relationship even stronger. During the conversation along the way, Sheng Yunfei and Zhang De both treated Li Xian as a friend, pulling him to drink and have fun together.

Although Li Xian was unwilling in his heart, he didn't show it and chatted naturally. It took a lot of time to send them off, and then he went to the Martial Inquiry Pavilion to talk with Yan Hao about the Five Elements Strange Evasion.

Meanwhile, on the other side.

The Ox Residence was quiet and peaceful. The Five Elements Flags were arranged throughout the house, forming a simple maze that isolated sound from inside and outside. Nangong Liuli woke up in a daze, finding herself leaning against the trunk of a fruit tree. She felt a bit dizzy and wanted to raise her hand to rub her head, but was startled to find her hands and feet immobile.

Memories flooded back. Nangong Liuli's face turned red, blooming with beauty. She cursed several times about the absurdity, not knowing if she was scolding herself or someone else. Her family upbringing was strict, and she valued etiquette greatly. The events of last night, and even many previous times, were very difficult for her to accept, but she had gradually accepted them subconsciously. She felt increasingly strange, her thoughts seemed to be changing, always breaking the bottom line, having ambiguous relations with Li Xian. She saw the surrounding environment and knew it was the outer courtyard. After returning to the Ox Residence last night, she hadn't entered the house.

Nangong Liuli became clearer. Seeing the surroundings so open, although there were vermilion doors and courtyard walls blocking it, it was empty like an open space. The sky as a quilt and the earth as a bed—this situation was truly her first experience. She felt she couldn't face anyone, secretly庆幸 (glad) for the 'Five Elements Flags,' which pulled the five elements layout in the courtyard to form a unique maze. The strange noises probably didn't disturb the neighbors.

Nangong Liuli wanted to cry but had no tears. She hid back in her room before barely calming down. She muttered to herself, "Nangong Liuli, Nangong Liuli, why don't you learn your lesson? Who did you have to provoke but that little thief Hua? You were in a submissive state, and provoked him again, wasn't that asking for trouble?"

"I watched my uncles and aunts in the family, all terrified of the fierce women at home. Every time they talked about paying taxes and grain, they would complain endlessly. They also said... in this matter, men can never beat women. It seems that's also false. Al, I lost to him again."

"Stinky little brother..."

Her spirit swayed, her eyes bright, and her pretty face turned red again.

[You consulted Yan Hao about the Five Elements Strange Evasion, Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Minor Five Elements Strange Evasion]
[Proficiency: 23/100]
[Description: The five elements of heaven and earth evolve endlessly. Few are精通 (proficient) in this Dao. By making flexible use of Five Elements Strange Evasion, one can set up "mazes," "cultivate strange grass," "increase fortune," "change terrain"...]

Li Xian discovered that the "Five Elements Strange Evasion" had great capabilities. From observing the stars and moon to predict good and bad fortune, down to cultivating flowers and managing houses, it had significant妙用 (wondrous uses). For example, "farming." In the theory of Five Elements Strange Evasion, this is the result of "natural evolution."

Setting up the evolution of "Water," "Earth," and "Wood." If Li Xian were given a piece of farmland, he could use the surrounding five elements to make the field more fertile. With the cycle of the five elements and natural evolution, the rice could ripen three, four, or even five times.

But Five Elements Strange Evasion has taboos. It's okay to use it for self-preservation. If one妄施恩情 (arbitrarily bestows favor) and乱布五行 (disorderly arranges the five elements), it will only invite trouble.

Therefore, Yan Hao did not help the indigenous residents arrange the five elements of their farmland. But two harvests a year were enough to be plentiful.

Li Xian whistled and walked leisurely back to the Ox Residence. When he returned home, the sky was completely dark. He first went to the West Wing to check on Nangong Liuli. Seeing her clothes slightly disheveled and wrinkled, bored to death, she was sleeping soundly in bed.

Li Xian thought to himself that the joke had gone too far and gently patted her awake. Nangong Liuli let out a cold "hum," turned her head away, closed her eyes and pretended to sleep, refusing to pay attention. Li Xian smiled, "Are you angry?"

Nangong Liuli said, "How dare I? Don't mind me, let me fend for myself." Li Xian said, "How can that be... I'll undo it for you first."

Nangong Liuli glared, "Alright, now you remember me, what were you doing earlier? Get lost, I don't want to see you."

Li Xian said, "Liuli-jie, if you keep acting like this, I'll have to teach you a lesson again." Nangong Liuli said, "Am I afraid of you, you evil thief?"

The words had barely left her mouth when she regretted it. She was actually very afraid in her heart, but her mouth would never give in. Even if she was completely defeated, she had to maintain some dignity verbally. Because she was trapped, her self-esteem was in danger of being lost at any moment, so she was particularly stubborn. If she returned to her family, she would change.

It took an hour like this. Finally, Nangong Liuli's emotions were smoothed over. The two played and joked, not truly angry. Nangong Liuli hadn't eaten all day and was starving. Li Xian cooked some plain porridge, simply ate it with pickled flower vegetables, and sat in the courtyard drinking porridge.

Midnight, the hour of the Rat (11 PM - 1 AM), about to go to sleep.

However, Elder Han Zisha of the Flower Cage Gate suddenly visited.

This beautiful woman had exquisite makeup, plump red lips, a fox-like face, and peach blossom eyes. She wore a semi-transparent gauze dress, with a voluptuous figure.

Her legs were wrapped in gauze stockings, decorated with silver gauze. Under the moonlight, her legs shimmered like starlight. Her waist was slender. Standing there, she exuded charm.

After sitting in the hall, she lifted her feet, intentionally showing her full legs, her beautiful eyes scanning up and down.

Li Xian said, "Elder Han, it's so late, is there something?" When he took over the 'Bee Farm' and 'Fruit Orchard,' Shi Yufei had told him the basic situation. Li Xian had entered and exited the inner island several times and顺便 (took the opportunity) to inquire about the elders, knowing of Han Zisha and An Weicheng. Although it was their first meeting, he recognized her quickly.

Han Zisha giggled, examining Li Xian's face, her eyes rippling, "What a handsome young man, such vigorous blood energy, such a strong body, you've charmed me to death."

Li Xian said, "Elder Han is joking." He handed over a teacup. Han Zisha took a slow sip, her beautiful eyes still examining him, feeling she couldn't get enough. She even propped up her chin and leaned closer to look. Li Xian said, "Elder Han, summoning me so late, it should be about the bee farm and fruit orchard, right?"

Han Zisha was slightly surprised, smiling foxily, "Hua little brother, you're quite direct. I like men like you who are straightforward and pierce right through a woman's heart."

Li Xian lightly coughed twice, "Elder Han, Wucoo is currently just a Holder Disciple, I can't bear the title of 'little brother'." Han Zisha smiled, "You said it yourself, 'currently', you won't be in the future. Do you know how many elders fought over that bee farm and fruit orchard, yet it was given to you?"

Li Xian knew the reason. It was Shi Yufei's bias towards the 'Candle Cult'. Although the Flower Cage Gate had ties with the Candle Cult, the Candle Cult was now publicly destroyed. Even the elders of the Flower Cage Gate would find it hard to join the Candle Cult. He smiled and shook his head.

Han Zisha said, "I don't know either. So, you must have something special. I特意 (specifically) came at night, naturally because... a man and a woman talking at night, things are更容易 (easier) to discuss." She walked towards Li Xian, turned gracefully, and had already lightly sat in Li Xian's lap.

Her fingers twirled Li Xian's sideburns gently.

Li Xian's expression was calm, "Elder Han, what do you mean?"

Han Zisha whispered in his ear, "Let's go to your bedroom to talk." As she spoke, she exuded a faint pink fragrance that tickled the ear. This was 'Pillow Flower,' a martial art technique. It had the wondrous effect of affecting the mind. The more lustful the opponent, the deeper they fell into the 'flower'. If it went deep into the bone marrow, they would even become her puppet, living and dying for her.

The faint mist followed the ear canal, invading the body and mind. Its principles were profound, containing both 'toxins' and 'ethereal fairy sounds'. But Li Xian's self-control was originally very strong. He had just been playing around with Nangong Liuli, so his lust had faded. Combined with his strong 'Five Organs', and his Pure Yang Body's resistance to poison...

He secretly played the 'Body Guarding Sound', which echoed in his mind. It neutralized the effect of the 'Pillow Flower'. Li Xian smiled, "Elder Han, the bedroom is unnecessary. Let's just talk here."

Han Zisha giggled, "Good boy, quite playful. That works too." She was about to take off her shawl. Li Xian stood up and stepped back several paces, "Elder Han, let's just talk about business, no need for this."

Han Zisha shot him a风情万种 (charming) glance. Her face was merely pretty, but her figure was voluptuous and sexy. She wore rare rouge on her face and had learned a set of alluring martial arts. The way she pursued him gently was indescribably charming. Many elders of the Flower Cage Gate had been taken down by her like this, and she had gained many benefits from them.

She certainly wanted to use this method to accomplish that important matter. But she also saw Li Xian's appearance and truly wanted to taste the flavor of this young man. Han Zisha said, "I'm a woman, and I'm not afraid. You're a man, why are you being so shy?"

Li Xian stepped back several more paces. Han Zisha felt quite frustrated and sat back in her original seat. With a light wave of her slender hand, the gauze dress floated up from the ground, wrapped around her fingers, and then, like water flowing upstream, followed her fingers and skin, draping over her shoulders again.

Han Zisha said, "I'm here to do business with you. A deal that's guaranteed to make a profit." Li Xian already knew this woman would do anything to achieve her goals, so he naturally didn't believe her.

Han Zisha said, "Hua little brother, although you have flower companions, you don't have a wife or concubines yet, right? What if I married you?"

Li Xian said, "Elder Han, don't joke like this. You are an esteemed elder, I am not worthy." Han Zisha said, "Oh dear, I'm sincere." Her gaze looked like she wanted to eat him.

After a while, Han Zisha thought: "The first step went wrong. If I could have talked in bed, I had a ten percent certainty of taking this boy down, making him go east if I said east, and west if I said west. Unfortunately, this boy's mind is very firm. I was too hasty just now, and he's already on guard." She said again, "Give me the bee farm and the fruit orchard, and I'll marry you. That way, I'm yours, and the bee farm and fruit orchard are also yours. It's a guaranteed profit, aren't you tempted?"

Li Xian thought: "If I were tempted, I'm afraid I'd be eaten by you without even the bones left." He said, "Such a good thing, this little one dares not dream of it." His tone was resolute.

Han Zisha said, "Alright then, I'll buy your bee farm from you. Five hundred taels of silver per mu. I'll pay fifty thousand taels of silver for your bee island."

Li Xian understood in his heart: "She's after the Golden Jade Island. Her calculations are loud. The Golden Jade Bees on my island are worth a fortune. If I sold them all, it would be more than fifty thousand taels." He said, "No, Chief Envoy Shi said this island was inherited from Elder Tong. The moment I took over the island, I also inherited Elder Tong's last wishes. His bones are still not cold. If I sell the island now, wouldn't that be对不起 (unforgivable) to him?"

Han Zisha raised her eyebrow slightly, sensing that Li Xian was difficult to deal with. What last wishes, it was all nonsense. She would be a ghost if she believed it. But in Li Xian's words, he mentioned Chief Envoy Shi, which made her extremely wary. The elders of the Flower Cage Gate were hunted and killed outside. The Water Altar was their refuge. If she offended Chief Envoy Shi, he didn't need to act personally. He just needed to deliberately not allow her to enter the island to push her into a dangerous situation. Moreover, her assets and industries were all in the Water Altar. She needed to pass through Chief Envoy Shi to enter and exit. Involving this figure, she had to be cautious.

Han Zisha said with a淡笑 (faint smile), "Hua little brother, are you sure you won't reconsider? Fifty thousand taels of silver... this amount is not small. Have you ever seen fifty thousand taels of silver? You need to know that one dan of fine rice only costs half a tael of silver. A full fifty thousand taels of silver, how many people can you support, how big a mansion can you build, how many fine treasures can you eat?"

"Martial arts cultivation is very expensive. When you've personally set up a cauldron and cooked fine food, you'll understand. Not to mention this necessary consumption, just the martial arts techniques, rare treasures, and precious artifacts... all have extremely high values. If others have them and you don't, you are inferior to others. And that's not even mentioning alchemy. When you come into contact with alchemy later, it will burn even more money."

Li Xian secretly nodded, deep in thought. Recalling the Yihe Manor, where Lady Wen's money flowed like water, he felt it was even more fitting. Han Zisha thought Li Xian was persuaded, smiling and asking, "So, have you made up your mind? Hua little brother, if you agree, this elder can give you some extra rewards. I live on West Street in Hua Liu Town. As long as I'm in the Water Altar, you can find me anytime."

"This elder's methods are not comparable to those common,庸脂俗粉 (commonplace women). You... you'll know once you've tried it."

Her expression was charming, her voice silky to the bone. It was a soul-parching, body-numbing use of a certain fairy sound.

Li Xian secretly played the Body Guarding Sound, protecting his mind, unaffected. He said, "Sorry, Elder, I still can't sell." He knew that Han Zisha's promise of "fifty thousand taels" would be hard to give even ten thousand taels. The rest would surely be in arrears or paid in "flesh." He would not be easily deceived.

Han Zisha's expression changed, looking very ugly. She had tried both seduction and temptation, but this boy was impervious, truly annoying.

As the atmosphere remained tense, Li Xian laughed heartily:

"But having said that, it's not that we have no possibility of cooperation."

(P.S.: Prepared enough, tomorrow I should be free, I should be able to update ten thousand words.)
