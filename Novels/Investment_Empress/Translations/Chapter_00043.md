# Chapter 43: The Bond Between Chixiao and Tianshuang, Target: Boulderbane Meteor Hammer!

Chixiao Sword was a sword with double standards. It practically threw itself at the ice lump, but for our little student Li, it presented a trial.

Ten sword moves. If he could withstand them, he would become its master.

Li Mo's vision blurred. *Buzz—* A familiar swordsman's figure had already appeared opposite him. The atmosphere instantly turned solemn and deadly.

The swordsman slowly cupped his fist in a salute towards him. "Please enlighten me."

Li Mo, holding his Green Steel Sword, likewise cupped his fist. The next moment, the two figures collided. The metallic clang of weapons resounded throughout the entire fourth level.

In the third level, all the renowned swords began to tremble slightly.

"Is that commotion caused by Brother Li?" Murong Xiao couldn't help but turn his head, looking towards the dark, cavernous entrance of the fourth level. That sword cry just now had made his hair stand on end.

"What's happening?" Xiao Qin looked up, a damaged greatsword in his hand. This was something he had found under the guidance of Venerable Thousand-Forms. Among the renowned artifacts, though it was unassuming in appearance and only half remained, its material was superior to the others. It was also one of the few renowned artifacts willing to acknowledge him as its master. Its spirituality was a bit weak, requiring him to nurture it himself in the future, but Xiao Qin himself was quite satisfied.

Yet at this moment, the greatsword was trembling slightly with that sword cry.

"Your Junior Brother Li is currently sparring with a Profound Artifact," Venerable Thousand-Forms said casually, without witnessing it firsthand.

"Sparring with a weapon?" Xiao Qin didn't quite understand what that meant.

"The stronger a martial artist, the more formidable their spirit becomes," Venerable Thousand-Forms explained. "The weapons they use year after year become imbued with their will. Do you know which sword is the most powerful in the Tianshan Sword Manor, renowned throughout the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands?" Venerable Thousand-Forms was quite happy to share some anecdotes with his disciple to broaden his horizons.

"Please enlighten me, Master," Xiao Qin listened with great interest.

"It's a wooden sword that once belonged to the Sword Ancestor." Venerable Thousand-Forms' tone was as if he had witnessed it firsthand: "It carries an entire Pure Grandmaster Sword Dao. Hundreds of years ago, this sword flew a thousand li from the Sword Tomb, cutting off a river and slaying an evil flood dragon with a single strike. To this day, the waters of that great river remain severed."

"A single sword severing a river for hundreds of years?" Xiao Qin gasped, drawing in a cold breath. For him now, this was simply an unimaginable feat.

Venerable Thousand-Forms was very satisfied with his disciple's shock, and continued: "The Sword Ancestor's personal weapon is far beyond what any Profound Artifact can compare to. Of course, that Chixiao is also an excellent Profound Artifact. Whether your Junior Brother Li can master it depends on if he learned anything from that girl."

"Chixiao, it would indeed complement Tianshuang well," Xiao Qin thought, pursing his lips. He didn't envy it, but rather grew to love his own damaged renowned greatsword even more.

In the fourth level, Li Mo had already withstood Chixiao's sixth sword move in his consciousness space. The sound of the sword cry actually made his soul feel an electric shock, and his consciousness a tingling numbness. Was this the aura of a Profound Artifact? Or perhaps... the residual Jing-Qi-Shen of the master who once wielded this sword?

Li Mo couldn't help but recall what the ice lump had told him beneath Qingyuan. Obsession could actually transform into a Yin creature. Then it was quite reasonable that Jing-Qi-Shen could condense into a swordsman with powerful sword techniques.

"This sword cry seems to have the effect of tempering one's spirit," Li Mo mused. It was quite faint at first, but the further he went, the more pronounced the feeling of spiritual tempering became.

"Come," Li Mo concentrated his mind and calmed his qi, seriously sparring with it.

The seventh move! The eighth move! The ninth move! These three moves were already truly sword techniques of the Consummation level. After sparring against nine moves, he felt his Jing-Qi-Shen had improved considerably, and his consciousness had become slightly more agile. If not for the ice lump's guidance, solely relying on his own martial dao insights to force his way through, he would likely have been stuck here. This wasn't surprising. It was like a profound math problem: without mathematical talent, one could ponder painstakingly for a lifetime and still not find the answer. Ordinary people could only use the 'formulas' summarized by geniuses to take shortcuts.

"The tenth move!" The aura of the swordsman opposite instantly became restrained yet powerful. Li Mo lightly exhaled a breath of turbid air, his concentration unprecedented.

The tenth sword cry resounded throughout the Divine Edge Cave, lingering endlessly, like a helpless sigh.

Outside the Divine Edge Cave.

"The Chixiao Sword has acknowledged a master," Elder Hancrane said, gently stroking his beard, his expression slightly strange.
