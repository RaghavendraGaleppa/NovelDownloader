# Chapter 6: Grade C

High above the platform, the elders watched the proceedings.

"Truly extraordinary. This is likely the finest I have seen in my lifetime."

Xue Jing, still clad in his patchwork robe, stroked his long beard, his eyes gleaming. He was not surprised by Ying Bing's Grade A+ bone structure.

"Is this the promising seedling you spoke of meeting down the mountain?"

A lazy voice sounded from nearby. A woman in palace robes leaned back in her chair, her cheeks flushed, looking utterly relaxed.

"That's her. I just wonder how far she can go on the Ascension Stone Stairs," Xue Jing replied, glancing at the woman with a look of helplessness.

"I like this girl," the woman in palace robes said, taking a large swig of wine.

The elders were speechless. *Are you sure you aren't just saying that because she is a peerless beauty?*

"She is not suited for your school of martial arts," Xue Jing sighed.

"Why not?!" The woman's eyebrows shot up.

"Why should she settle for you? You've trained yourself into a walking furnace. It is obvious to anyone that this girl should not be your disciple," a cold, hard voice cut in.

"Han He, are you looking for a fight?" The woman clenched her fists, looking eager to try.

Elder Han He instinctively took a half-step back, letting out a cold huff of disdain.

"Enough. Settle down."

The voice was filled with authority. Only after the Sect Master spoke did the woman reluctantly pick up her gourd and gulp down a few more mouthfuls of wine.

The elders exchanged glances. *Could the Sect Master be interested in that young girl as well?*

***

Unknowingly, another incense stick's worth of time passed. By the time it was Li Mo's turn, five hundred people had already had their bones felt.

The old woman grabbed his shoulder, and a surge of energy immediately flowed in, preparing to circulate through his meridians and body. But in an instant, the energy vanished.

*Hmm?*

The old woman frowned for the second time. Internal energy could stimulate the organs and bone structure. The better the bone structure, the stronger the reaction. But this boy's body showed no reaction at all. Not only that, but her internal energy had vanished like mud thrown into the sea.

If she hadn't seen the boy standing there with her own eyes, she would have thought she was touching a stone.

After a moment of hesitation, she wrote down his name.

"Li Mo, Grade C. You may pass."

"Thank you."

Li Mo had expected this. He cupped his fists toward the old woman and walked through the mountain gate with a calm expression.

"Tsk, tsk. Grade C. My dad is going to be unhappy," he muttered. "You'll have to put in a good word for me then. Your words carry weight with him."

Li Mo laughed heartily, bumping his shoulder against the girl beside him.

Ying Bing was slightly surprised. Grade C资质 was not much different from what she remembered, yet he didn't seem disappointed at all.

Li Mo looked completely nonchalant, his spirit undiminished.

"Three parts are determined by fate, seven parts rely on hard work," he said. "Many people can't even enter the mountain gate. I'm already quite lucky."

There was something else he didn't say: *Why panic? I have a cheat.*

Ying Bing looked at the boy's genuine carefree attitude. *So be it.*

At least his bottle of Pure Yang Pills had helped her open her meridians early, saving her half a year of time. His state of mind was worth pulling up slightly; how far he could go would depend on him.

Just then, an elder's announcement drew everyone's attention again.

***

"Wang Hu, Tiger Arm and Leopard Waist. Grade B-!"

A commotion broke out in the crowd. Aside from the two Grade A monsters, Wang Hu already possessed the best talent. He was truly one in ten thousand.

Basking in the flattery of those around him, Wang Hu laughed arrogantly, casting a glance into the crowd.

"What are you looking at?"

Li Mo fell into deep thought.

***

A moment later, a figure landed before the mountain gate.

"Tiger and Leopard physique?"

A tower-like middle-aged man reached out and grabbed Wang Hu's shoulder. Wang Hu was startled, but then he saw his cousin, Wang Hao, walk out from among the disciples and signal to him with his eyes.

"Indeed. He has a Tiger Arm and Leopard Waist," the tower-like man said with a satisfied smile.

"Master, this is my cousin," Wang Hao bowed respectfully.

"Good, good. He is even more suited to practice my Tiger and Leopard Thunderclap Fist than you are."

His laughter boomed, vibrating painfully in everyone's eardrums.

"Futu, wait until he enters the inner sect before you take him as a disciple," a short, fat elder frowned and reminded him.

*Futu?*

Wang Hu was stunned for a moment, then felt a surge of wild joy. This was a powerful inner sect elder. If not for the fact that every elder position was already filled, he would have already been in charge of a peak.

"Hehe, I know the rules," Futu said, cupping his fists casually.

Under his cousin's signal, Wang Hu hurriedly bowed.

"Greetings, Master."

"Pass the Ascension Stone Stairs first," Futu didn't bother to correct the title.

After Futu left, Wang Hu held his head even higher, almost as if the word 'arrogant' were written on his forehead. Walking past the mountain gate, he went straight toward them and cupped his fists with full confidence.

"Miss Ying, we are fellow disciples from now on."

Then, he was met with utter indifference.

In Ying Bing's eyes, Wang Hu's Grade B and Li Mo's Grade C were no different. They were both just pebbles; why bother distinguishing which one was flatter?

Left hanging, Wang Hu's face flushed red. He turned to Li Mo instead.

"Hehe, we are from the same hometown. Now that I have risen to prominence, how could I forget you?"

"Wait, there is a difference between the inner and outer sects. It won't be easy for me to come down here."

"And perhaps, in a few days, I will be a true disciple. It might actually be more convenient for me to see Miss Ying than to see you, right?"

His smile was malicious. Having an inner sect elder as his backer, the young and arrogant Wang Hu felt his ego swelling to the heavens.

Several other boys and girls from Ning'an County looked indignant but couldn't speak up. Wang Hu had been arrogant and domineering in the county to begin with, and now he had skyrocketed in status. Originally, they hadn't had a good impression of Li Mo either, but compared to Wang Hu, Li Mo suddenly seemed much more likable.

"...Yes, yes, exactly," Li Mo said.

Li Mo's Fate-Seeing Eyes had been on ever since Wang Hu had his bone structure tested. Originally, Wang Hu's fate was blue, but after the test, a thread of black appeared. As he showed off his arrogance, the black deepened further.

His evaluation had even changed to: *'Stubborn and self-righteous. Being used as a guinea pig by Inner Sect Elder Futu without realizing it. A bleak future.'*

Li Mo didn't like arguing with idiots, and he was too lazy to argue with a half-dead man.

He was ignored again.

"You!" Wang Hu choked on his breath, a nameless fury surging in his heart.

However, the short, fat elder seemed to notice the scene. He withdrew his gaze from Li Mo and Ying Bing, sneering inwardly.

*We have plenty of time.*

*After all, there is a world of difference between the outer sect and a true disciple. They won't be able to stick together.*
