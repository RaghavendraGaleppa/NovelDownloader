# Chapter 687: This Vixen, I Must Make Her My Dual-Cultivation Companion

Suddenly looking back, Xu Yunfan saw that the True Lord of Universal Salvation,承化妙有普度真君, had somehow already appeared a hundred yards away.

He was draped in a pristine white Daoist robe, surrounded by pure energy that seemed to merge with heaven and earth. Only his deep eyes reflected the Aitila World, as if containing the flow of the starry river.

*What the hell?!*

*How did this old dog end up in Aitila?!*

Xu Yunfan’s gaze shot like lightning toward Dongming Zhenjun, carrying a sharp edge.

Her dark Daoist robe swayed slightly, her peerlessly beautiful face perfectly displaying a hint of innocence and panic.

"Don't be angry, Junior Brother Xu. When you were intercepted by Chiyang Tongxuan in the Boundary Sea, Senior Sister was gravely injured and couldn't hold on. I had to risk my life to flee back to the Taihua Lingxu World to seek help. Brother Pudu oversees the sect's inspection of the myriad heavens; how could I dare hide this world's coordinates?"

Her words came rapid, carrying the grievance of being misunderstood.

"If not for Senior Brother tearing through the boundary wall to descend in time, secretly deterring the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect and preventing their True Lords from entering again, how could we have从容 collected the Dao Fruit?"

Xu Yunfan cursed internally.

*You bitch, you definitely leaked the coordinates on purpose to bring him here for a share of the loot. I’m going to fuck you to death later!*

Xu Yunfan forcibly cut away the killing intent and frustration in his heart, instantly suppressing his aura. He straightened his Daoist robe, his expression solemn, and bowed respectfully to True Lord Pudu.

"Senior Brother is too kind. I have just obtained a Dao Fruit of All Things Vitality. This Dao Fruit is merely an embellishment for me. Since it fated with Senior Brother, I naturally should offer it up."

A flash of lightning in his palm, and a crystal appeared, emerald green and dripping with vitality, containing a scene of vines twisting and all things growing. It was precisely the Dao Fruit of All Things Vitality from the natural lord, Orion.

Although this item could increase lifespan and solidify foundations, it contradicted his Divine霄 Destruction Dao. It was far less compatible than the extreme yang attribute of the Great Light Immeasurable Dao Fruit.

If Xu Yunfan were to hand over a Dao Fruit, he would only offer this one.

If he were asked for the Great Light Immeasurable Dao Fruit.

Then he would truly have to say sorry.

True Lord Pudu smiled and nodded, not pressing the matter. Although this Dao Fruit wasn't of much use to him—he had long since completed the Wood Dao Fruit after ten thousand years of performing the Great Circulation—what he wanted was merely Xu Yunfan's attitude.

Seeing Xu Yunfan was sensible, he lightly brushed his sleeve. The emerald Dao Fruit turned into a stream of light and vanished into his palm.

His gaze swept over the messy battlefield, finally landing on Xu Yunfan.

"This world has a robust origin. Although the authority of the three main gods has been lost and the Heavenly Dao is injured, the foundation remains. The Tongxuan True Lord of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect has escaped; this world's coordinates will definitely be exposed. The struggle between the two sects is imminent."

His tone was calm. "Junior Brother Xu, you have managed this world for a long time and even possess the Heavenly Dao Token. From this day forth, you shall command all affairs of the Primordial Origin Sect in this world. All sect disciples and subordinate forces are to obey your orders. You must seize the initiative and extract the origin before the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect invades in full force."

Xu Yunfan’s heart chilled; he knew this was applying pressure to him. After all, hiding this world was something True Lord Pudu was naturally displeased about.

*A man under the eaves must bow his head.*

On his face, however, there was no hesitation. He answered solemnly.

"I respectfully obey Senior Brother's decree. I will do my utmost to fulfill the entrusted task."

Commanding a world's campaign meant a massive amount of resources and merit. It was exactly what he needed to stabilize his Golden Core and impact the mid-stage. Perhaps he could even mediate and find a way to the Samsara Sea of Bitterness in the Taihua Lingxu World.

True Lord Pudu nodded slightly. His gaze flowed between Xu Yunfan and Dongming Zhenjun for a moment, then suddenly revealed a meaningful smile.

"Observing your two auras blending, yin and yang mutually nourishing, it seems your dual-cultivation path has made considerable progress. The so-called mutual aid among fellow disciples, accompanying each other on the Dao path, is truly a beautiful story. Why not let me preside over it and forge a Dao Companion pact for you two, jointly contemplating the Great Dao of longevity? What say you?"

With these words, the atmosphere instantly froze.

Xu Yunfan’s brows furrowed instantly. Before Dongming Zhenjun could react, he spoke with absolute resolve.

"I appreciate Senior Brother's kindness. However, a Dao Companion pact involves karmic and luck connections; it is no trivial matter."

He turned his gaze to Dongming, his words sharp as a knife.

"Sister Dongming is skilled in the wondrous methods of dual-cultivation; the number of men beneath her skirt is恐怕难以计数. What I seek is merely to use the Nine Yin Mysterious Evil to harmonize the Divine霄 Supreme Yang, taking what each needs. A dual-cultivation companion is acceptable, but to become Dao Companions? I must decline!"

Sex is fine, marriage is out.

If he did that, he’d likely be wearing a green hat on his head the moment he turned around.

"Xu Yunfan!"

Dongming Zhenjun’s willow-leaf eyebrows stood upright. Her dark Daoist robe moved without wind, and the Nine Yin Evil Mist surged violently. The surrounding temperature dropped sharply.

To be honest, these words were like a stab to the lungs; no woman could accept that.

Her peerless face flushed red from shame and anger, and her eyes shot ice-pick-like cold light at Xu Yunfan.

"Good! Very good! A dual-cultivation companion! Let's see if you have the skill to touch a single strand of my hair from now on!"

Facing the overwhelming evil aura, Xu Yunfan instead hooked a roguish smile. Purple-gold lightning crackled around him, meeting her glare head-on.

"Naturally, I will touch. Your Nine Yin Mysterious Evil is extremely yin and cold, while my Divine霄 Thunder is extremely yang and fierce; they are a match made by heaven, complementary paths. How can I give up such a great Dao opportunity just because of Senior Sister's past experiences? It's just as they say: thunder ignites the earth's fire. It's a matter of mutual consent; can Senior Sister stop it?"

The final words carried naked provocation, his burning gaze sweeping over her heaving chest.

Xu Yunfan wasn't afraid that Dongming Zhenjun wouldn't come to seduce him. He now possessed the Dao Fruits of Thunder and Fire; his yang energy was practically soaring to the heavens. To Dongming Zhenjun, he was a natural great tonic.

Although the Great Light Immeasurable Dao Fruit was an external fruit position and couldn't be considered orthodox, the Li Guang Ran Yan Red Yang Dao Fruit was genuinely in his hand. Just waiting to be refined, once his cultivation advanced greatly, she would have to swallow her pride and come to him.

Dongming Zhenjun trembled with rage, the evil mist flickering uncertainly.

True Lord Pudu observed their reactions, the smile on his face unchanged, but a hint of imperceptible understanding and indifference flashed in his eyes.

He had only said this casually and didn't force it.

Changing the mind of a True Lord is extremely difficult.

And he couldn't very well strike them.

He said no more, his figure slowly dissipating like a breeze, leaving only his lingering voice.

"The disputes of this world are entrusted to Divine霄 True Lord. The dignity of the Primordial Origin Sect must not be lost."

The moment True Lord Pudu's aura completely vanished, a fierce light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

His figure moved like lightning, instantly closing in on Dongming Zhenjun. Purple-gold lightning turned into chains that wrapped around her fair wrists, and he pulled her into his embrace without explanation.

Dongming was shocked and furious; the Nine Yin Evil Mist instinctively counterattacked but was forcibly suppressed by the violent Divine霄 Thunder.

"Xu Yunfan! You are outrageous!"

Dongming Zhenjun struggled and rebuked him.

"Shut up!"

Xu Yunfan lowly shouted, one arm wrapping around her slender waist, the other hand forming a sword point and tapping her heart cavity.

"You just obtained the Eternal Night Dao Fruit; isn't it perfect to use my thunder and fire to stabilize the authority you just seized? I'll take a loss and add fuel to the fire for you. This is the duty of a dual-cultivation companion."

Before the words faded, the majestic purple-gold lightning, carrying the pure yang fire of the Red Yang Dao Fruit, violently rushed into Dongming's body.
