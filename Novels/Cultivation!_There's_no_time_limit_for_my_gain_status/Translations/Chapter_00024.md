# Chapter 24: Hardened Skin Pill

After applying the ointment, the temperature in the alchemy chamber seemed to instantly drop. A cool sensation enveloped his skin, shielding him from the external heat. Taking a few steps closer to the furnace, while he could still feel some warmth, it was now completely within tolerable limits.

This stuff is amazing! Jiang Li's eyes lit up as he decisively held down the plus button for five seconds.

**[Cooled Skin: Fire resistance increased by 50 points, Duration: ∞]** (-)

Another reliable enhancement acquired!

"Fan the flames every two breaths!" The red-haired elder's voice came from beside him.

Jiang Li took his position at the furnace vent as directed by Xiao Si, channeled pure wood-attribute spiritual energy into the small fan, and gave it a gentle wave forward. Just as Xiao Si had said—it really wasn't difficult. The technique for using a single attribute's spiritual energy was also covered in the wood-attribute cultivation method he had exchanged for.

With a single wave of the fan, a faint green breeze brimming with vitality blew forward. Wood feeds fire—under the influence of the wood-attribute spiritual energy, the flames beneath the furnace surged slightly higher.

Jiang Li silently counted the seconds—two breaths roughly equated to five or six seconds—and waved the fan at each interval, maintaining a steady burn beneath the furnace. However, having only recently begun his Qi Refinement cultivation, his spiritual energy reserves were limited. Each fan wave consumed one point of spiritual energy, putting considerable pressure on him.

Opening his personal status panel:

**[Active Debuffs: None]**

Over this period, Jiang Li had broken through to become an internal martial artist and then a Qi Refinement cultivator. His attributes had undergone significant improvements compared to before, and new categories had appeared, making the panel far more detailed. However, he was still just a novice who had only recently begun Qi Refinement—his spiritual energy was a meager 29 points.

At a rate of one fan wave every five seconds, he could last only two minutes and twenty-five seconds at most. That was far too short and didn't match his "vigorous man" persona at all.

As expected, he would have to rely on Qi Restoration Pills. Jiang Li bit open a bottle cap and tossed a pill into his mouth. The moment the pill landed in his stomach, it felt like he had swallowed an effervescent tablet—strands of spiritual energy dispersed from the pill, directly replenishing his dantian from within.

**[Consumed Qi Restoration Pill. "Qi Recovery" applied to self.]**  
**[Qi Recovery: Recovers 6 spiritual energy per minute. Duration: 30 minutes.]** (-+)

Six points per minute meant one point every ten seconds—still not enough. Jiang Li subtly glanced at the red-haired elder and Xiao Si before tilting the bottle to his mouth again, gulping down half the contents in one go.

**[Excessive consumption of Qi Restoration Pills. "Accelerated Qi Recovery" applied to self. "Dantian Exhaustion" will be applied after effect ends.]**  
**[Accelerated Qi Recovery: Recovers 30 spiritual energy per minute. Duration: 30 minutes.]** (-+)

Following his usual habit, he held the plus button for five seconds.

**[Accelerated Qi Recovery: Recovers 30 spiritual energy per minute. Duration: ∞.]** (-)

Huh? Dantian Exhaustion? Sorry, but I'll probably never see that debuff in this lifetime. Jiang Li felt slightly disappointed as he looked at this buff—this was the upper limit of stacking Qi Restoration Pills? Still not reaching second-by-second recovery. However, recovering one point every two seconds already exceeded his consumption rate. At the very least, as a furnace-tending disciple, Jiang Li could now operate perpetually.

Of course, he still had to keep up appearances. Jiang Li subtly puffed his cheeks slightly, swallowing visibly every ten minutes or so—pretending he was still holding pills in his mouth and consuming them one by one. This was actually a common practice in the cultivation world, allowing one to free up their hands for combat or other tasks while speeding up pill consumption. It was a practical technique taught by the Transmission Elder in class, so Jiang Li's actions didn't seem out of place.

About an hour and a half later, Jiang Li was already sitting to the side. Since the red-haired elder had demanded faster fanning, Xiao Si, worried Jiang Li couldn't keep up, had taken over for him.

Just then, the furnace let out a dull *thump* as the spiritual flames beneath it gradually extinguished. The red-haired elder raised his hand, and over a dozen round pills flew out, landing on a jade plate atop a nearby table, emitting a medicinal aroma laced with heat.

Jiang Li noticed that several pills were partially charred—clearly defective products. The remaining successful pills, however, looked quite presentable. Unlike the small, pitch-black trial pills from before, the standard "Experimental Hardened Skin Pills" had a gray, cracked stone-like texture, appearing quite mystical.

**[Name: Experimental Hardened Skin Pill]**  
**[Type: Pill]**  
**[Grade: Yellow Tier Mid-grade]**  
**[Note: A pill that has not passed safety inspections. Caution advised when consuming.]**

It had directly reached Yellow Tier Mid-grade? Jiang Li grew excited.

"Jiang Li, come. Give it a try. Don't worry—I'll make sure you're fine," the red-haired elder said.

Jiang Li picked up one of the Experimental Hardened Skin Pills. It was still warm. After blowing on it lightly, he placed it in his mouth and swallowed.

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill. "Tough Skin" applied to self.]**  
**[Tough Skin: Skin toughness increased by 50%. Duration: 30 minutes.]** (-+)

Oh, this was good. Jiang Li could already feel himself becoming far more resilient—his skin's toughness had significantly improved. It was like raw hide being processed into leather armor—ordinary mortal blades would now find it difficult to pierce his skin.

But before he could celebrate, his vision darkened, and his legs nearly gave out beneath him.

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill. "Anemia" applied to self.]**  
**[Anemia: All attributes reduced by 30%. Temporary stamina reduction of 300 points. Duration: 3 hours.]** (-+)

This... why was it yet another different negative effect?

Before he could process it, his stomach gurgled violently, and a sudden urge to erupt surged within him.
