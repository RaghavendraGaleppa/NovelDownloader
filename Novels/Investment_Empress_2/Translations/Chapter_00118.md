# Chapter 118: Departure for Qinghe County, Look at You, Getting Impatient Again

Morning.

Autumn Water Pavilion.

"I'm still a step short of the Xuan Dan Realm, just as I thought."

Li Mo shook his head.

For most cultivators at the Inner Breath Jade Liquid Realm, even with good talent, it's normal to be stuck before the Xuan Dan Realm for three to five years. His current speed of progress is already something countless people can only dream of.

"Seven Stances of the Universe, I can now execute the Sixth Stance."

"As for swordsmanship... hmm, it's even more handsome!"

Little Li is now a formidable opponent even among those at the Inner Breath Realm, relying solely on his sword.

After cooking, he ate while looking at the room on the second floor.

"Two types of inner breath stacked together, tsk tsk."

Shang Wu narrowed her almond-shaped eyes: "Even without reaching the Xuan Dan Realm, her inner breath intensity is enough to instantly kill most Xuan Dan Realm cultivators and make those at the Divine Observation Realm wary."

"..."

Li Mo fell silent for a moment. He wondered, was Ice Cube cultivating with herself? In that case, she wouldn't need to practice the first level of "Phoenix Singing in the World's Marsh" with him anymore. Hmm... the second level might be more suitable. But that would have to wait until after entering the Divine Observation Realm.

Putting his thoughts aside, Li Mo checked his travel essentials. While checking, he casually asked, "Master, aren't you planning to come to Qinghe County with us this time?"

After seeing Shang Wu出手 once, not entirely seriously, Little Li felt that having her around guaranteed a sense of security.

"Hmph, I'm not going."

Shang Wu let out a soft哼, clearly displeased: "Those old men said I've worked hard and deserve a break, so they won't let me follow this time."

Li Mo试探ed, "Is it possibly because they're afraid you'll get into fights with people from other sects?"

"Come here, come here. Before we leave, let your Master test if you've regressed."

Shang Wu put her hands on her hips, intending to give her precious disciple some special care.

Fortunately, Ying Bing came down at that moment.

Li Mo scrambled into the carriage, narrowly escaping disaster.

.........

The Clear Abyss Sect's departure for Qinghe County was naturally a grand affair. Elders and stewards from various peaks were mostly present.

This expedition was led by three elders, as the incoming forces were a mixed bag, coming not only from the East Wilderness Domain but also from nearby foreign domains. Therefore, the leaders were Yin Huaxuan, Elder Qian Bufan, and Xue Jing.

One was powerful and extremely familiar with various exotic beasts, the other was adept at socializing... and could eat a lot. As for Xue Jing, he was there to prevent accidents from happening to the disciples.

The disciple contingent was also composed of elites. For example, the chief disciple of the previous generation, Ouyang from Ruyi Peak. The leader among the disciples was Yin Huaxuan's son, Yin Huacheng.

For the remaining disciples, the Clear Abyss Sect held a small selection tournament. There was no age limit this time; all disciples at the Divine Observation Realm and below could participate. In the end, thirty were selected. Most of them were true disciples at the Divine Observation Realm. There was only one inner disciple.

Xiao Qin.

During the selection tournament, he emerged as a dark horse, suddenly bursting with immense power to defeat his opponent. Standing among the many true disciples, Xiao Qin seemed particularly conspicuous.

"Where are Li Mo and Ying Bing?"

Qian Bufan stood at the very front of the formation. He glanced at the sun, a bit puzzled.

"The sect's operation, and they're late."

Yin Huaxuan frowned, looking to the side.

"Father, rest assured. Once we enter the秘境, I will instruct them to follow orders."

Yin Huacheng said with a smile, cupping his hands.

He had just finished speaking when a familiar sect leader's carriage appeared on the mountain path, approaching at a leisurely pace.

The carriage curtain lifted.

"You two little rascals, why are you late?"

Qian Bufan cleared his throat and asked casually. After all, one couldn't expect the Ice Cube to socialize.

Li Mo smiled and said, "We were at a critical point in our training temporarily. Please forgive us, Elder Qian. I'll treat you to hot pot later."

"Alright."

Qian Bufan nodded, a smile appearing on his face. After sensing their auras, the smile turned into surprise.

"You two, you've both improved so much? Good, very good."

He could see clearly. These two little rascals were both not far from the Xuan Dan Realm. Although Ying Bing was further from the Xuan Dan Realm than Li Mo, she was cultivating two types of inner breath, yet her progress was the same.

Qian Bufan retracted his gaze and said seriously, "The situation in the Blood Phoenix秘境 is complex, with many forces. You two must stick close to us along the way."

"Mm, the safety of Xiao Mo and Xiao Bing'er is the top priority. What we gain in the秘境 is secondary."

Xue Jing also nodded in agreement.

"Once we enter the秘境, I ask for Junior Brothers and Sisters to follow my arrangements and not cause trouble."

Yin Huacheng's indifferent voice came.

Who is this guy? Why does he talk so arrogantly?

Li Mo couldn't help but size him up, seeing the handsome yet gloomy face of the chief true disciple from the Rare Beast Peak.

"Elders, we plan to act separately."

One could tell with half a mind that the Blood Phoenix秘境 was very important to the Ice Cube. The Ice Cube would definitely be a lone wolf. Li Mo planned to make some investments in the秘境 and wouldn't follow the main force either; they would meet up later. So, following orders was out of the question.

"Hmph, most of those entering the秘境 this time are at the Divine Observation Realm. You two are only at the Inner Breath Realm, inexperienced in the world of Jianghu. Without my protection, you won't be able to move an inch."

Yin Huacheng's tone wasn't exactly friendly, yet he insisted on keeping them within his sight.

What's with this Senior Brother? Is he acting like a domineering CEO? So crazy?

Li Mo was a bit confused.

"You?"

Ying Bing tilted her head slightly, looking at Yin Huacheng. Her deep, clear eyes didn't ripple at all. It was possible that seeing an ugly dog on the roadside would cause more emotional fluctuation than this.

Ignoring him.

This was the greatest mockery...

Yin Huacheng reacted strongly, his face turning pale and then green, looking utterly miserable. He remembered on the cliff, it was also this pair of young man and woman, with the same gaze...

Li Mo: "...... Cough, Senior Brother, look at you, getting impatient again."

It's not that serious. By the way, the Ice Cube's mocking aura should only be effective on villains. Could it be...

Qian Bufan and Xue Jing exchanged a glance, both seeing the silence in each other's eyes. When they said to be careful, they meant outside the秘境. Inside the秘境...

Divine Observation Realm?

Experience in Jianghu?

You probably don't know how the Infinite Trial ended...

They were afraid these two little rascals would pull that stunt again. They seriously suspected that after Li Mo and Ying Bing separated from the main force, they would put on masks and become the Three Tyrants of Huai Shan... Oh my, not to mention, Xiao Qin was also there, so the Three Tyrants of Huai Shan would be quite complete.

"Disorganized and undisciplined."

Yin Huaxuan turned, intending to have the other two elders say something.

"Acting separately is fine."

Qian Bufan cleared his throat. Xue Jing also nodded in agreement: "I agree."

Yin Huaxuan was slightly stunned, not expecting the two to be so agreeable.

"Hmph, then I wish you two great success in your秘境 journey."

Yin Huacheng, his face completely lost, turned and left in a huff.

Watching his back, Li Mo raised an eyebrow, a flicker of obscure light in his eyes.

Divine Eye of Fate, activate!

PS: I'm a first-tier writer now, hehehe. Hehe, thank you all, dear readers. When I started this book, I didn't expect the results to be quite good. It's my first time writing a fantasy genre as a little unknown author. Some details weren't handled perfectly. I'll be more serious in the future and do a good job with every plot, mwah!
