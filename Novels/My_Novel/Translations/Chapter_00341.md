Chapter 341: The Five Swordsmen Visit, the Mistress Beats the Dogs, Xiao Wanjian Submits, and the Great Battle is Proposed

In the main hall of the Blue Fragrance Pavilion, Wen Caishang and Li Xian arrived late. There were five distinguished guests in the hall: the five team leaders of the Five Mountain Sword Alliance—Xiao Wanjian, Duan Yixin, Hou Yuande, Hu Yueyue, and Wang Zongheng.

The five men were calm and composed. Standing beside each was a senior disciple of their respective sect, dressed in purple robes, carrying long swords on their backs, and wearing silver coronets. Hearing the movement, Xiao Wanjian glanced sideways and saw Wen Caishang and Li Xian. Noticing that Wen Caishang was even more allusive than before—with flushed cheeks, raised eyebrows, red lips, and hazy eyes—he cursed under his breath, "Despicable man and shameless woman." He raised his tea cup, skimmed off the tea foam, and took a sip to cover his actions.

Wen Caishang walked over gracefully, her attire exquisite and fitting, dignified and gentle. The disciples’ eyes lingered on her, staring blankly. The elders coughed softly to remind them, preventing them from losing composure. Wen Caishang took the host's seat. A fragrant breeze drifted as she cupped her hands toward the five and said, "To have the five of you grace us with your presence is an honor. I have been remiss in my hospitality, unable to meet you immediately. Please forgive me."

Xiao Wanjian said coldly, "We waited a good while, yet never saw Lady Wen appear. We thought you had already fled without a trace. To have the fortune of seeing Lady Wen again is truly great luck." As he spoke, he infused his voice with Qi, making it full and resonant, his words like swords that could flay flesh and draw blood. Fine cracks appeared on the bluestone tiles beneath his feet, and the stone pillar behind him was marked as if by a chisel; with every word he uttered, another fine mark appeared.

In the tomb, he had suffered greatly, unable to display his strength. Now, with no constraints, his internal Qi was abundant and vigorous, his martial dao fully evolved, and his cultivation steady to the extreme. He wished to casually display his power. His words concealed sharp intent, instantly imposing a show of dominance.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "All of you are my guests, and I have long admired your names. Whether you wish to drink, taste tea, admire flowers with me, or speak of idle matters, I am more than willing—how could I avoid seeing you?"

The disciples’ hearts stirred, but they quickly regained their composure.

Xiao Wanjian said, "That is good, that is good. Lady Wen, my Yangshan Sword Sect has received your 'care,' so we have specially sent you a gift." He waved his hand lightly, and a disciple waiting behind him stepped forward, holding a long box horizontally in his hands.

Xiao Wanjian said, "My Yangshan Sword Sect is remote and sparsely populated, with a rough style, not as refined as yours. That boy, please take this long box for your mistress to inspect!"

Hu Yueyue frowned slightly, feeling it was inappropriate. She thought, "Using this to test the waters is probably fine," so she relaxed and pretended not to know. Li Xian brushed his sleeve over his face, his dual pupils seeing through the box to reveal a precious sword inside. It was the "Yunyang Sword," an ornament rather than a weapon, with an exquisite form and a golden sword tassel. However, it concealed the evolution of martial dao within.

Xiao Wanjian sending the sword was a pretense; the real purpose was to test them. He had a short temper and a narrow mind. In the tomb, he had been sent flying by Li Xian's sword and defeated by his spear, feeling deeply humiliated. He wanted to test Wen Caishang and, by the way, make things difficult for Li Xian.

Before sending the sword, he had used the Yunyang Sword to perform a move from his sect's sword art, "Gale and Thunder Sword." He only executed half the move before sealing it in the box. The sword body retained the evolution of martial dao and lingering ethereal music. If one could not dissolve this move, they would be inexplicably shaken and injured, or cut by fragments... That was why he specifically had Li Xian deliver it.

Wen Caishang raised her eyebrows slightly and said, "Since your style is rough, that is even better. I will follow Elder Xiao's lead and omit the unnecessary formalities; there is no need for more words." Her sleeve flipped, releasing a suction force. The long box flew over and landed steadily before her. She tapped the box with her toe. The lid immediately opened, and a precious sword flew out.

Wen Caishang caught it easily and examined it closely. The sword was two fingers wide and three feet long, with a handle carved from jade. Xiao Wanjian frowned. He had held this sword to perform the "Jade and Stone Burn" move within the "Gale and Thunder Sword." This move was meant for life-and-death combat; the long sword would shatter into countless fragments, raining into the enemy's body. He expected that the moment Li Xian passed the box, the precious sword would explode and scatter fragments everywhere.

That would both avenge his grudge and display his power.

He never expected Wen Caishang to easily dissolve the sword move. She held the sword and examined it, sneering, "Since Elder Xiao is a rough man, I will speak plainly, for fear Elder Xiao might not understand. This precious sword... barely acceptable. As a ceremonial weapon, a jade handle and golden tassel are too tacky, with slightly poor taste in appreciation. As a weapon, the blade is too narrow and sharp, full of intent to harm but lacking the ability to do so, which is frustrating and incompetent. But since it is Elder Xiao's kind intention, I will take it for your sake and naturally store it in the treasury."

She handed the sword to Li Xian and said, "Xiao Xian, if you like it, you can play with it." Li Xian took the sword, casually waved it a few times, and drew several graceful sword flowers. He sighed disappointedly, "Better to store it. I don't know if Yangshan Sword Sect is poor and incompetent, or just lacks sincerity. How could they send such a inferior sword to fool people?"

Wen Caishang took the opportunity to lecture, "Xiao Xian, do not be rude. Although Elder Xiao is a rough man and knows no etiquette, you are not. Speaking like this is somewhat inappropriate."

Li Xian repeatedly said, "Yes, I have been taught."

Xiao Wanjian's face turned pale and then green. He heard the hidden barbs in their words, the two vile women and treacherous man mocking and stabbing indirectly, making him lose all face. He slapped the table and cursed, "How dare you arrogant brat and vicious woman be so insolent, looking down on my Yangshan Sword Sect's gift! Since that is the case, I will not send this sword anymore. Return it to me!" He reached out to snatch the long sword back.

Xiao Wanjian appeared to be grabbing the sword, but actually concealed an attack. The precious sword was in Li Xian's hand, so Xiao Wanjian directly approached Li Xian, reaching for the sword hilt. This was a feint; his real intention was to strike vital points like the throat or heart. With his abundant internal Qi, high realm, and profound martial dao evolution, every move was extraordinary. Though without strong killing intent, he was determined to make Li Xian suffer and be injured. Li Xian's internal Qi and strength were sealed, so he naturally found it hard to resist. Yet he remained calm.

When Xiao Wanjian was two steps away from Li Xian, seeing his scheme about to succeed, he thought, "You vicious woman, there are no tomb mechanisms here. No matter how strangely strong your treacherous man is, I have a thousand ways to deal with you. Today, I will show you my might!"

His attack was like a sword, now revealing its edge. He was certain Li Xian could not resist. But suddenly, he felt a dizzying sensation, his hair standing on end, his scalp tingling, and a powerful crisis burst forth in an instant. Xiao Wanjian's soul shuddered. He hurriedly raised his Qi to defend, executing the martial art "Yangshan Body-Protecting Gang." He crossed his arms to protect his chest.

It was Wen Caishang who struck. Her palm movement was slow, the angle not tricky. Her hand was fair and delicate, as if gently stroking or patting. It lightly landed on Xiao Wanjian's crossed arms. Only a "thud" was heard, like rotten wood striking an evening bell, or a stone flow meeting an empty gorge. The two moves collided, and the Qi surge swept out instantly.

Hu Yueyue, Duan Yixin, Wang Zongheng, and Hou Yuande hurriedly used their power to stabilize their bodies. The disciples staggered, retreating several steps, their feet firmly planted to barely stand steady. The bookshelves in the main hall toppled, porcelain shattered, jade tables, candlesticks, red chairs, and screens all collapsed and rolled. The windows on all sides rattled and clattered.

In this exchange, martial arts evolved endlessly, with unpredictable power. Wen Caishang's hand remained fair, her figure still dignified and elegant as she sat in the chair. Xiao Wanjian, however, broke out in a cold sweat, gritting his teeth to resist. "Yangshan Body-Protecting Gang" was his strongest defensive martial art. Like Yangshan standing firm in a storm, it remained unmoved. This martial art derived its name from that.

When executed, the body was like a mountain. Regardless of howling winds, pouring rain, or roaring thunder, one remained calm and composed. No matter how many moves the enemy had, they could not harm him in the slightest. The golden light of protection was extremely condensed, as if leaning against a mountain behind him.

But he gradually felt his protective golden light being eroded layer by layer. He was like a vivid, mountain-like statue, but Wen Caishang's light palm was digging at the mountain's roots, cutting down vegetation, driving away beasts, severing water flows, and destroying his foundation.

Suddenly, several "crack" sounds were heard. The bluestone tiles beneath his feet spread with cracks. Xiao Wanjian let out a muffled "ugh" roar, his eyes filled with indescribable shock. In the underground caves, he had encountered her several times, and Wen Caishang had cleverly used mechanisms to trap him. Xiao Wanjian had guessed that Wen Caishang's strength, though not weak, might not surpass his. Now that they were out of the tomb, with no more bell sounds affecting them, why should he fear this woman?

Thus, he acted without restraint, immediately showing刁难 (difficulties) to test them. Seeing Li Xian's disrespect, he dared to attack him directly. Now, after just one exchange, he knew his guess was completely wrong. He was foolishly arrogant, unaware of the vastness of the world. This woman's strength was unfathomable. He already felt regret and wanted to seek help from the fellow elders. But his breath was all held in his chest, fiercely resisting. A thousand words were hard to speak; speaking would release his breath, risking his life.

Wen Caishang suddenly turned her hand, her fingers like leisurely picking flowers. She lightly flicked, making a "ding" sound. Xiao Wanjian vanished instantly.众人 (Everyone) looked around to find him. Then they heard a "rumble" and knew Xiao Wanjian had been flicked away, crashing into and collapsing a courtyard wall.

The elders were dumbfounded. They immediately followed the sound and saw that after crashing through one courtyard wall, Xiao Wanjian did not stop. He successively crashed through three more walls, being shot into the street, knocking down a large crowd of pedestrians. He rolled on the ground to dissipate the force, covered in dust, extremely disheveled.

He barely stood up, but his feet kept retreating quickly. Suddenly, he felt he could retreat no more; his back hit a vermilion wall, shaking his whole body, his bones making "cracking" sounds. Finally, his momentum ceased, his legs sore and weak.

He knelt on the ground, gasping for breath, but then felt even more terrified. The vermilion wall behind him was densely cracked, actually forming a lotus pattern. He exclaimed in shock, "It's the 'Flicking Flower Finger'!" He then saw flowers and plants growing from the cracks, vines creeping out... In an instant, it turned into a flower wall.

Martial arts evolution is endless. Even killing intent can be full of life! At this moment, he looked at the Blue Fragrance Pavilion, already a mile away. He felt infinite terror: "I... I thought her strength was ordinary, never imagining... it would be so terrifying. This woman is truly... truly formidable!" He looked at his arms again; his bones were broken. But he practiced martial arts and could heal his injuries quickly.

Li Xian looked on, secretly thinking, "The Mistress seems to have become stronger again. This move should be the 'Flicking Flower Finger'; I have seen her use it before. Seeing it again is truly enviable. If I could learn this move, it would be another powerful aid. Well, I can't digest too much at once. I haven't even started practicing 'Flicking Gold Finger' and 'Supreme Heart Skill' yet. Coveting the 'Flicking Flower Finger' would be too greedy." He saw Wen Caishang's expression was normal, lightly patting her dress, as if it were nothing.

Wen Caishang said, "I wonder if the other four are also here to give gifts? If you are giving gifts, it's best to have some etiquette." Hu Yueyue, Duan Yixin, Hou Yuande, and Wang Zongheng exchanged glances, each sitting back in their chairs, silent.

Xiao Wanjian ran back to the Blue Fragrance Pavilion, seriously injured. He cupped his hands and said, "Lady Wen, just now... it was I, I was reckless and impatient. Please forgive me."

Wen Caishang said calmly, "Being reckless and impatient is fine. But if you want to hurt my little man, don't blame me for being a bit heavy-handed." She grabbed Li Xian's hand and gently patted the back of it.

Xiao Wanjian repeatedly nodded, "Yes, yes, it was my foolishness. I hope Brother Li will not blame me." He brushed the dust off his clothes and sat back in his seat. Wen Caishang said, "If you have important matters, please speak directly."

The five elders looked at each other, communicating with their eyes, hesitating.

This matter dates back several days. That day, the Five Mountain Sword Alliance discussed and wanted to find Li Xian and Wen Caishang to cooperate against the enemy. Unfortunately, they were unfamiliar with the tomb and searched hard for a day without finding any trace.

The Five Mountain Sword Alliance did not know if Li Xian and Wen Caishang had already left first. Blindly searching hard might only put them in a more disadvantageous position, so they stopped wasting effort. They thought about how to escape, but had no clever plan, so they tried to break out forcefully.

Just as they left the main hall, they indeed saw He Wentian tightly guarding with troops, leaving no path for survival. The group had no cultivation or internal Qi... How could they withstand a volley of ten thousand arrows?

They resisted several times but were forced back into the main hall. He Wentian then said, "Brothers of the Sword Alliance, I, He Wentian, believe I have treated you well, yet you covet the treasures of my Flying Dragon City. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance is said to be an alliance of gentlemen, but now it seems it is just a reputation-seeking sham."

He turned the blame on them, making the Sword Alliance members grind their teeth with anger. He continued:

"I now give you a path to survival, allowing you to exchange one life for another. Disciples take disciples' heads, elders take elders' heads. You have only just formed an alliance, with little friendship between you. At this time, it is understandable that 'if one does not seek for oneself, heaven and earth will destroy him' for the sake of survival."

"If you worry about having nowhere to go in the future, you can naturally join Flying Dragon City. I, He Wentian, particularly appreciate those who know the times. Although my Flying Dragon City is a remote city, it has mountains, water, and magnificent scenery. I will not disappoint any talented heroes."

He was very skilled at bewitching people. With these few words, he truly caused chaos in the Five Mountain Sword Alliance. The various sword sects nearly developed suspicions. Fortunately, the five elders suppressed everyone's emotions, barely stabilizing the situation.

Hu Yueyue, Xiao Wanjian, Duan Yixin, and others all felt it was tricky. They thought, "He Wentian has a good plan. His words cut off our retreat. If we stay in the main hall for a long time, he dare not send troops rashly and will have to spend great effort to stalemate us. Time, manpower, and resources would be wasted, and his grand plan would be hindered."

"Once he said this, it would be hard for us to remain calm for long. Prolonged stay will inevitably lead to friction and mutual suspicion. Later, when we are hungry and cold, we will likely cause internal strife first. The Sword Alliance will split, fighting desperately to save their lives, only to benefit him. The urgent priority is to kill the enemy first, uniting everyone's hatred outward."

Thus, the Five Mountain Sword Alliance had no choice but to plan another aggressive strategy to achieve results, boost the disciples' morale, reduce internal troubles, and no longer be swayed by evil words. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance... the five sword sects trace their roots to the same origin.

The Five Mountain Sword Alliance formed because, although the five sword sects differed in region, martial arts style, and character, they shared the same roots. The five team leaders of the Five Mountain Sword Alliance each possessed a volume of "Sword Manual." When pieced together, they formed a Five Mountain Sword Formation.

The five elders had already pieced them together but had not studied them in detail. Now trapped, they needed to unite the power of the five sects. No one held back, and they practiced the Five Mountain Sword Formation together.

After a day of effort, the sword formation became familiar. They needed practical combat training, so the five elders led the formation and charged into the enemy ranks. The scene was truly like ten thousand arrows piercing the heart, five swords emerging to kill the enemy bandits.

The disciples' sword dao attainments were all present. They arranged formations, cooperated with each other, and coordinated tacitly. Although the enemy was numerous, as long as the formation did not break, they could barely cope. In this way, they forcefully broke out of the main hall, bringing out the fighting spirit of all disciples and elders.

The sword sect disciples, though injured, were rare elites and would not easily be defeated. Previously, they had been overturned by Li Xian alone, their morale greatly dampened. Now, fighting in the formation, relying on exquisite sword moves, they easily flipped enemy armor, broke enemy spears, and struck enemy vital points. They realized they were not weak; it was just that Li Xian was too abnormal. Their hearts burst with spirit, and confidence quietly returned. They wanted to be like Li Xian, fighting many with few and showing their might.

The more they fought, the higher their morale rose. He Wentian was terrified, never expecting this. He held a bow and shot from afar. Though his archery was outstanding, it was far inferior to Li Xian's. Though he could cause interference, he could not change the battle situation. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance actually broke through a layer of encirclement. In this battle, they annihilated three thousand seven hundred enemy troops.

The enemy troops fled in disarray.

The Sword Alliance cheered and became excited, wanting to pursue and completely destroy the enemy. Zhao Chunxia said sternly, "We are deep in this place, and there will be many more fierce battles ahead. It will likely be the norm to not rest for over ten days. It is妄谈 (absurd talk) to want a quick victory. Everyone must be prepared. Keeping full strength is the top priority. I know of an enemy camp where supplies are stored!"

The elders all said, "Good! Chunxia's words are reasonable. The desire for quick victory must not be had, or a single defeat will greatly dampen our spirit. We must advance steadily and surely, step by step. Go quickly to take the supplies." Zhao Chunxia led the way, fighting to a military camp where the women had once stayed.

The supplies inside were complete: fruits and vegetables, dry cakes, clean water, long bows, arrows, armor... The elders put on armor, replenished their equipment, and cooked food to quickly replenish their strength.

They took what they could carry and ate the rest. Then they charged out again, engaging in several waves of confrontations. Although the sword sect side suffered losses, they fought more fiercely as they battled.

Tempered by the soldiers, the Five Mountain Sword Formation gradually became proficient. The five team leaders cooperated to kill the enemy, able to move freely through the enemy ranks. Seeing it was difficult to take them down in one go, He Wentian changed to mainly harassing and besieging.

The sword sect was initially brave and fierce, sharpening their blades. But after several days of fighting, they inevitably felt unbearable fatigue, and their morale slightly dipped. Combined with the enemy's numerical superiority, they began to suffer setbacks.

Outside the main hall was He Wentian's territory. He was extremely familiar with the tomb's forks and secret paths... He set up ambushes along the way and laid mechanisms on the roads. He was elusive, and the Five Mountain Sword Alliance suffered losses repeatedly. The situation became critical again.

At this time, Han Qingxiao suddenly appeared holding a golden plate, assisting the Five Mountain Sword Alliance. Lin Aoshan joyfully called out, "Brother Han!" Han Qingxiao was the current巡天司 (Patrol Heaven Department). When he entered the cave, he was surrounded and attacked by heavy troops, and got separated from Li Xian and the others.

Han Qingxiao thought at the time: "If I wander around aimlessly again, I will just be wasting effort. It would be better to use the golden plate to first draw a map of the garrisons and the tomb." So he relied on the golden plate, moving between the various tomb garrisons, observing the terrain he saw, and drawing a tomb map, clearly marking all the locations.

For over ten days, he did nothing else. Later, he gradually heard the faint sound of the bell. He felt even more urgent and did not dare show himself easily, secretly moving around. Until he saw He Wentian frequently moving troops, he knew a major change had occurred inside. He took advantage of the chaos to lurk and saw the members of the Five Mountain Sword Alliance.

Seeing that the Five Mountain Sword Alliance was unfamiliar with the terrain and suffered losses repeatedly, he appeared to help. In this way, He Wentian lost his geographical advantage and became greatly panicked. He no longer dared to entangle himself in the tomb. He did not hate the Five Mountain Sword Alliance but hated Wen Caishang to the core.

All matters and causes were挑起 (provoked) by Wen Caishang. He wanted to escape from the tomb and order soldiers to guard the cave. Anyone who showed their head would be immediately shot and killed. By now, he was enraged and could not accomplish anything.

Who knew that on his escape route, he was suddenly ambushed by a soldier who had escaped. Caught off guard, his leg was injured. He looked back in shock. The soldier removed his disguise—it was Gu Nianjun!

That day, Gu Nianjun had accidentally walked into the "Nine Caverns Dragon Heart Cave" and soon encountered a large group of soldiers. After shaking them off, the more she thought about it, the stranger she felt. So she found a way to hide among the soldiers.

She and Wen Caishang had set foot in the cave one after the other. The tomb's terrain was dark, and both women caused骚乱 (disturbances) and围剿 (encirclements). Gu Nianjun hid herself, while Wen Caishang actively revealed herself. As a result, the soldiers only knew Wen Caishang had infiltrated the tomb, overlooking Gu Nianjun. When the enemy troops围剿 (encircled) Wen Caishang, they suffered heavy casualties and needed to调兵 (transfer troops) to replenish. Gu Nianjun took this opportunity to blend into the interior.

At this time, no one knew of her existence. It was just a coincidence that Wen Caishang attracted He Wentian's attention, causing him to inevitably neglect other matters while dealing with them.

Gu Nianjun had planned to leave after exploring once. Unexpectedly, by chance, she overheard He Wentian's plot: to capture the women of the sword sect and frame the Flower Cage Sect. She was extremely shocked. She never thought He Wentian, who appeared gentle on the surface, hid such ambition, and acted cunningly and viciously, which was shameful. She wanted to sneak out and inform them.

But before she could escape, she heard that He Wentian's insidious scheme had succeeded, and the women of the sword sect had already been captured. Gu Nianjun was alarmed. At the time, she thought she was not very familiar with the tomb, and sneaking in was already luck. To escape perfectly would inevitably leave flaws. Since she had already infiltrated the enemy, why not take this opportunity to secretly find out where the women were.

So she observed the situation while secretly exploring. Her results were minimal, but at the most critical moment, she caused He Wentian's complete defeat. In this way, the members of the sword sect saw the light of day again. After several twists and turns, they secretly captured He Wentian, and their sects were safe.

The various sects rested for several days, looking refreshed. But thinking it over, there was still one matter that needed to be resolved. Wen Caishang had坑杀 (trapped and killed) sword sect disciples, and a final decision was needed. However, the measure of this matter was very difficult to grasp.

Hu Yueyue said, "This matter was first instigated by He Wentian. If we use this to make trouble again, it would seem we are unreasonable." Xiao Wanjian said, "I would rather be unreasonable than give an explanation to the dead disciples. He Wentian is naturally extremely hateful, but is Wen Caishang a good person?"

Duan Yixin said, "That's right. What happened in the main hall does not count. As martial artists, we ultimately need to settle things with martial arts." Hou Yuande said, "That may be true, but this will provoke trouble, and it's not good to cause deaths again."

Hu Yueyue said, "How about this: we challenge Lady Wen to a duel. We only decide victory, not life and death. If she loses, she must find a way to mourn the dead disciples. If she wins, we will never mention this matter again, and all grudges will be settled."

Thus, the Five Mountain Sword Alliance delayed their departure. They paid attention to the movements in the city. Only when Wen Caishang and Li Xian appeared in the city did they show themselves to visit.

In the main hall of the Blue Fragrance Pavilion, Hu Yueyue exchanged glances with the five elders and said, "Lady Wen, the events in the cave were indeed caused by a villain secretly plotting. But our sword sect disciples died, and they cannot die in vain. The five of us wish to invite you to a duel. We only decide victory, not life and death, to settle this grudge."

A strange light flashed in Li Xian's eyes.

(P.S.: I stayed up coding until 2 a.m. again. I'm really too sleepy. Thank you all for your monthly ticket support. I wanted to work hard to code more to give back, aiming for 8,000 words. Who knew a phone call came, and I have to work overtime this weekend. The work is too busy. Let's see how石榴 (Pomegranate) feels, and I'll try to update more when possible! Or maybe I should make a plan for extra updates?)
