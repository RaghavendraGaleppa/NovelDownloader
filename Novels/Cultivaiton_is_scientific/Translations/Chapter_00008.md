# Chapter 8: Tracking

Shi Ximing stood atop the eaves, his body light as a feather, his legs shimmering with a faint blue glow. He had come to Daxia for one purpose—to claim an inheritance.

His cultivation talent was mediocre at best. After more than twenty years of practice, he had only reached the third level of Qi Refining—an embarrassingly low achievement. Most wandering cultivators at the Qi Refining stage surpassed this level. With his limited time spent on cultivation, he had barely mastered any combat techniques, making even robbery beyond his capabilities. Were it not for the resources passed down from his ancestors, he might not have even reached this meager stage.

While casually flipping through his ancestor's notes, Shi Ximing had stumbled upon a journal entry mentioning an old friend of his forebear. This friend, severely injured with no hope of advancing further in the immortal path, had returned to Daxia. The journal mentioned that this friend had been fortunate enough to obtain a top-grade magical weapon during the early stages of Qi Refining.

Top-grade magical weapons were treasures that even most late-stage Qi Refining cultivators couldn't obtain, let alone an offensive one like his ancestor's friend possessed. Though his ancestor had likely recorded this as mere reminiscence, Shi Ximing saw it as his golden opportunity. With such a weapon, he could easily overpower most low-to-mid level cultivators. Even if a low-level cultivator couldn't sustain the weapon's use for long, its power could breach the defenses of mid-level cultivators lacking proper protective artifacts.

Convinced this was his destined chance at immortality, Shi Ximing had come to Daxia. However, having no connections in the mortal world, his inquiries about his ancestor's friend's descendants had leaked.

The target was Chief Escort Wang, whose ancestor had indeed been the friend mentioned in the journal. The inheritance left by Chief Escort Wang's forebear had become the foundation of the Wang family. This legacy wasn't limited to cultivation techniques—it included several supreme martial arts manuals. While such manuals held little value in the cultivation world, they had allowed the Wang family to produce numerous martial masters across generations. The current Chief Escort Wang had even achieved the rank of Grandmaster, elevating the Prestige Escort Agency to become one of Daxia's top escort services.

Aware of his inheritance's importance, Chief Escort Wang had taken precautions when he learned someone was investigating his ancestor. The day he gathered his agency's escorts to discuss countermeasures was the day Shi Ximing found them. Seven escorts sacrificed themselves to buy Chief Escort Wang time to flee from Tianxiang Tower. Using his familiarity with the surroundings, the Chief Escort managed to shake off Shi Ximing's pursuit.

Shi Ximing hadn't expected Chief Escort Wang to be so cunning. A mere mortal Grandmaster should have been no match for a third-level Qi Refining cultivator like himself. What should have been an easy capture turned into an embarrassing escape due to his momentary carelessness.

The incident at Tianxiang Tower had caused quite a stir, especially with numerous scholars present and several injured examinees among the seven casualties. The local authorities launched a full-scale manhunt for Shi Ximing. While unafraid of mortal authorities, he couldn't afford to draw too much attention before securing his prize. If the situation escalated, the immortal sects backing Daxia would dispatch cultivators to handle the matter—cultivators far beyond a mere third-level Qi Refiner like himself.

Thus, Shi Ximing refrained from further violence, instead employing subtler methods to track Chief Escort Wang. Yet after scouring nearly half of Nanling City without success, his patience wore thin. He stormed the Prestige Escort Agency, slaughtering everyone inside, then used the blood of Chief Escort Wang's direct descendants to activate a low-grade Bloodline Tracking Talisman.

To his immense frustration, the talisman failed to pinpoint Chief Escort Wang's location. Only two possibilities remained: either the target had traveled beyond five hundred li from Nanling Prefecture, or he was already dead, rendering the talisman ineffective.

Gritting his teeth, Shi Ximing retrieved another talisman from his pouch—this one radiated significantly more spiritual energy than the previous one. It was a mid-grade Aura Tracking Talisman, one of the few valuable artifacts inherited from his ancestors. A single mid-grade talisman equaled a hundred of its low-grade counterparts in value, far beyond what a third-level Qi Refiner like himself could produce. The thought of wasting such a treasure on a mere mortal pained him deeply.

"Once I find you," he muttered while retrieving a piece of clothing from his storage bag, "I'll extract your soul and turn your corpse into a puppet." The garment, taken from the escort agency, carried Chief Escort Wang's lingering aura.

Channeling his spiritual energy, Shi Ximing activated the mid-grade talisman. It transformed into a beam of light that merged with the clothing, instantly revealing the Chief Escort's movement trail. The talisman would remain effective for three hours—ample time to locate his target within Nanling City. Even if Chief Escort Wang had died, the talisman could trace the aura left along his final path.

His search of the escort agency had yielded no sign of the inheritance artifact. Through interrogation, he'd learned that Chief Escort Wang had taken an item with him during his escape. Therefore, even if the man himself couldn't be found, recovering the artifact remained highly probable.

Applying a low-grade Lightbody Talisman to maintain his feather-light state, Shi Ximing spared no expense in his pursuit. Following the aura trail, he leaped across Nanling City's rooftops like a phantom.

Half an hour later, he arrived outside the prefectural yamen. The talisman's guidance finally revealed why his previous searches had failed—Chief Escort Wang had taken refuge within the government compound itself. The most dangerous place often proved the safest; who would suspect that the man sought by both a cultivator and the authorities would hide in the heart of official power?

Without hesitation, Shi Ximing prepared to breach the compound, consequences be damned. The aura trail led toward the rear gardens, whose high walls meant nothing to him. With a single leap, he cleared the barrier, his feet barely grazing the treetops as he followed the ethereal trail.

The gardens stood empty—Prefect Li Wenyuan had been exceptionally busy lately. With only himself and his son Li Shiming in residence and most servants dispatched to handle the recent citywide crisis, the grounds were deserted. Though weak by cultivator standards, Shi Ximing's enhanced senses and the Lightbody Talisman allowed him to penetrate deep into the garden complex without alerting a soul.
