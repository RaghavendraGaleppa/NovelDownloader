# Chapter 15: A Single Embroidered Needle

"Ah, Sister Cui, Ran Yue, don't be too upset. This is just fate!"

"Yes, outside Fangshuo City these days, the Xu family are the law unto themselves. We can't afford to provoke them!"

"..."

Neighbors came by to console Cui Shi and Yin Ranyue before shaking their heads and leaving with heavy sighs.

The three members of the Qin family returned inside.

After entering, Qin Ziling asked for details and learned that Cao Zhengbin had been celebrating his birthday today. Being short-handed, he had hired Yin Ranyue to help out.

Cao Zhengbin was merely the father-in-law of Xu Yuanwu, the young master of Xu Manor. Considering Xu Yuanwu's noble status, he naturally wouldn't deign to attend in person. However, since Cao's daughter had borne him a healthy son this year, he sent his half-brother Xu Yuanbiao to represent him.

Xu Yuanbiao happened to catch sight of Yin Ranyue and was immediately overcome with lustful intentions. He attempted to force himself on her right then and there. Fortunately, Yin Ranyue wasn't some pampered young lady—she was strong and quick-witted. Taking advantage of Xu Yuanbiao's momentary carelessness, she managed to break free and flee the Cao residence, leading to the scene Qin Ziling had witnessed earlier.

"That damned bastard!" Qin Ziling cursed, his face dark with anger.

"Don't be angry, Young Master. This is my fate, and it seems I'm not destined to continue serving you and Madam," Yin Ranyue said, wiping away her tears.

"No, Ranyue. That villain will surely face divine retribution. Perhaps the heavens will claim his life tonight!" Qin Ziling declared.

Cui Shi and Yin Ranyue could only weep silently in response.

What else could they do but console themselves with such thoughts?

"Madam, Young Master, please rest for a while. I'll prepare dinner," Yin Ranyue said after a moment of silence, drying her tears as she stood up.

"You're leaving tomorrow. Let me prepare a meal for you tonight. Ziling, go catch a hen and slaughter it. The three of us will have a proper meal together," Cui Shi said, holding Yin Ranyue back.

"Madam, how could I possibly allow that?" Yin Ranyue protested.

"Why not? You've served me all these years. Now that you're leaving tomorrow, let me do this for you," Cui Shi insisted.

Without a word, Qin Ziling went to the yard and caught a hen.

That evening, the Qin family enjoyed an unusually lavish dinner.

Though the hen had been slaughtered for Yin Ranyue, during the meal, she kept placing the choicest pieces—the drumsticks and large chunks of meat—into Qin Ziling's bowl.

Qin Ziling accepted without protest, eating quietly while his heart swelled with emotion. What a wonderful girl she was! Even though he, as her master, had failed to protect her, she bore no resentment. Instead, she remained utterly devoted to him. In his previous world, no amount of money could buy such loyalty from a woman.

After dinner, Qin Ziling silently returned to his room and closed the door behind him.

Seeing him withdraw without a word, Cui Shi and Yin Ranyue assumed he was consumed by guilt and sorrow. They wept quietly for a while before sighing and heading to the west wing to pack Yin Ranyue's belongings.

In the east wing, Qin Ziling sat cross-legged in meditation, then projected his spirit from his mind's celestial court and flew toward the Cao residence in the eastern part of the village.

The celebration at the Cao residence was still ongoing—glasses clinked, lanterns blazed, and the atmosphere was lively. Though Xu Yuanbiao was merely the illegitimate son of the Xu Manor's lord by a concubine, here at the Cao residence, he was treated as a VIP, seated at the place of honor while everyone toasted him and showered him with flattery.

Before long, the banquet concluded.

Xu Yuanbiao boarded his carriage and departed for Xu Manor.

Qin Ziling's spirit followed at a distance, but Xu Manor lay beyond the range his spirit could travel from his physical body. Soaring higher for a better vantage, he watched until Xu Yuanbiao's carriage entered the manor gates before withdrawing his spirit and returning to his body.

Once reintegrated, Qin Ziling took a moment to steady his breathing and calm his mind. Then he rose and searched for an embroidering needle.

Finding one, he once again projected his spirit and attempted to manipulate the needle.

By candlelight, the needle in the room twitched abruptly, then floated into the air. It darted back and forth through the room, though not particularly swiftly—if someone were alert and on guard, it would be difficult to strike successfully.

Generally, martial artists who had trained to the Skin Membrane level developed a heightened sensitivity to danger.

Young Master Xu was tall and robust, his muscles taut, his breathing steady, and his gaze sharp and penetrating. He was at least at the first level of Skin Membrane cultivation, possibly even the second level—Iron Skin. If a needle were to approach him slowly while he was awake, he would undoubtedly sense it.

After a while, the needle drifted back down to the table.

Qin Ziling, who had been sitting with his eyes closed, slowly opened them and exhaled deeply.

"Good thing I can control the needle. Otherwise, I'd have to wait for that bastard to fall asleep and try to frighten him through his dreams to unsettle his mind. But martial artists with strong physiques usually have resilient spirits too. If their willpower is strong, it would take days of dream invasion to truly damage their spirit—time I don't have."

"But with the needle, once he's asleep, taking his life will be easy—unless he's reached the Energy level. Still, better to be safe and add a little extra insurance."

Picking up the needle, Qin Ziling's mind raced. In the candlelight, his expression took on a sinister, ruthless edge that clashed starkly with his youthful, handsome features.

Soon, the needle vanished from his hand. The next moment, it appeared within the Corpse Nurturing Ring, embedded in the severely tattered wing of the Four-Headed Avian Copper Corpse.

Yellowish corpse fluid seeped steadily from the wing's tattered flesh, quickly coating the needle.

Though the avian corpse's wings were badly damaged, Qin Ziling had learned from Li Mo's fragmented memories that this was actually the most powerful of the three copper corpses. It had originally been a Silver Corpse but had regressed to copper due to severe injuries sustained in battle.

Thus, its corpse fluid was the most toxic.

"Hmph, even an ordinary person would risk fatal infection from a rusty needle prick to a vital spot. I refuse to believe a needle soaked in copper corpse fluid won't be enough to end that bastard's miserable life!" Qin Ziling's lips curled into a cold, merciless smile. He blew out the candle and sat in meditation to rest his spirit.

A dark cloud drifted across the sky, blotting out the moonlight.

The land was plunged into darkness.

It was now the dead of night.

Lying in the darkness, Yin Ranyue stared at the ceiling, her heart filled with dread and despair for the future. Sleep was the last thing on her mind.

"Creak!" A faint but unmistakable sound pierced the quiet night.

Startled, Yin Ranyue quickly got up, threw on her outer robe, and tiptoed to the window. Through the paper pane, she thought she glimpsed a shadowy figure flitting past.

Her heart pounded, but she steadied herself and cautiously cracked the door open to peer outside, ready to scream at the slightest sign of danger.

Just then, a night breeze swept through, dispersing the clouds. Moonlight spilled like quicksilver across the courtyard—empty and still.
