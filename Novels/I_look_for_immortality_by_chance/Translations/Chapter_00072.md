# Chapter 72: Playing Tricks  

The golden light was dazzling, like the radiance of the sun—overbearing, scorching, and overwhelming.  

Though the Cloud and Mist Seal was formidable, it couldn't withstand this terrifying golden light. The seal was pierced through, and the violent energy surged recklessly, striking Gu Yuan directly in the eyes.  

Gu Yuan stood frozen, as if he had lost consciousness.  

Seeing this, a burst of laughter erupted from behind the dissipating mist.  

"Hahaha! A mere disciple of Qingfeng Dao Academy, did you really think my Azureflame Water Ape clan was some weakling you could bully at will?"  

"If you want to seize my spirit land, you’d better have the skill to back it up!"  

The mist, now uncontrolled, gradually dispersed, revealing a green-furred ape within.  

This was the same ape that had commanded the horde of demons earlier, but now its aura had surged dramatically. Previously, it had been barely at the sixth level of Qi Refining, but now it had reached the threshold of the eighth level—a massive leap in power.  

Its eyes gleamed with a rich golden light as it stared at the motionless Gu Yuan, a cold smirk on its lips.  

A mere seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator, struck by its Flame-Eye Technique—there was no way he could survive.  

"Another impure-blooded water ape… It seems the Azureflame Water Ape clan has truly abandoned Feilang Mountain, leaving only small fry to guard it."  

But just as the water ape stepped forward, ready to twist Gu Yuan’s head off, a sigh suddenly reached its ears.  

The ape’s eyes widened in disbelief as it looked ahead.  

The seemingly unconscious Gu Yuan had abruptly opened his eyes.  

Those eyes shone with a golden brilliance, as if forged from pure gold, even more dazzling than the ape’s own golden pupils.  

Compared to Gu Yuan, the ape felt its own golden eyes were nothing more than gilded fakes.  

"This is the Flame—"  

Before it could finish its shocked exclamation, a vibrant peach blossom shot toward it.  

The blossom was dazzling, radiant, yet carried a deadly edge.  

The sharp energy sliced through the air with a chilling intensity, making the ape’s fur stand on end.  

"Bang!"  

Without hesitation, the ape swung its fist, smashing toward the peach blossom.  

A brilliant golden light erupted from its fist—unbeknownst to anyone, the ape had donned a pair of golden gauntlets.  

"Boom!"  

Dense spiritual energy flared from the gauntlets, amplifying its already immense strength. Over a hundred thousand jin of force swept through the air, shattering the peach blossom instantly.  

But before the ape could even feel relief, the sky rained down with countless more blossoms.  

One, two, three…  

Hundreds of peach blossoms descended, the air humming as if sliced into countless fragments, cold and deadly.  

"Top-grade sword seals!"  

The ape cried out in panic, swinging its fists wildly, desperately trying to smash the blossoms apart.  

Yet each blossom was condensed from razor-sharp sword qi, cold and unrelenting. Though the ape fought with all its might, its fists were no match for the sheer number of blossoms.  

Wounds began to appear, accumulating until they erupted in a shower of blood from its body.  

"No!"  

"Spare me!"  

The ape screamed in despair, its heart sinking like a stone.  

But it knew it was futile—human cultivators would never show mercy.  

"Whoosh!"  

Yet, at that moment, the deadly peach blossoms seemed to heed its plea, dissolving into fine pollen that scattered like foam in the wind.  

"Hand over the spirit peak’s treasures, and I’ll spare your life."  

The cold voice rang in the ape’s ears like a divine melody.  

"I’ll give it! I’ll give it!"  

"Immortal, please don’t kill me!"  

It begged frantically, fumbling through its fur before tossing a grayish-green storage pouch at Gu Yuan’s feet.  

Trembling, it watched Gu Yuan, terrified he might change his mind.  

"Swish!"  

But Gu Yuan paid it no mind. With a wave of his hand, he summoned the pouch with his magic power, then vanished like lightning toward the mountain peak.  

His gaze seemed to pierce through all illusions as he swiftly traversed the cliffs and lakes, plucking every spirit herb and spirit fruit in sight and stuffing them into the pouch.  

Then, his figure gradually disappeared into the mountain.  

"This… this…"  

The ape gaped, utterly baffled by what had just happened.  

Not only that, but when it touched its bloodied wounds, it realized they were only superficial.  

The peach blossom sword qi that should have shredded its flesh and organs had merely scratched its fur. Though it looked battered, its strength was barely diminished.  

"What a strange man…" The ape scratched its head in confusion.  

But then, its expression suddenly twisted in alarm as it turned toward the side.  

A golden sword shot from the air, aiming straight for its throat.  

At the same time, a green chain flickered into existence, coiling toward the ape.  

"Who’s there?"  

The ape panicked, its golden gauntlets flaring as it mustered all its strength to strike at the two artifacts.  

"Bang!"  

To its surprise, the two artifacts let out a mournful hum and were sent flying.  

"Damn it, this ape isn’t injured at all!"  

The air rippled as two young men in green Daoist robes emerged from the side of the cliff.  

Their expressions darkened as they saw the golden light still radiating from the ape.  

The two had followed Gu Yuan into the mountain, hiding with a secret technique, intending to swoop in once he and the demons had weakened each other.  

But to their shock, Gu Yuan had left immediately after defeating the ape, not even bothering to set up a formation.  

Stunned yet thrilled, they saw this as a golden opportunity.  

Shocked by Gu Yuan’s strength but overjoyed that he had abandoned the spirit peak, they exchanged eager glances.  

"Heaven-sent chance!"  

Watching Gu Yuan’s retreating figure, they could no longer hold back and attacked the ape.  

But to their dismay, the ape—though seemingly battered and pitiful before Gu Yuan—was almost entirely unharmed.  

"Damn it, we’ve been tricked!"  

They cursed inwardly.  

Meanwhile, the ape realized that compared to the previous human, these two were worlds apart in strength.  

"Daring to ambush your grandpa ape? Die!"  

With a vicious grin, its eyes flared gold as its fists swelled, launching a fierce assault.  

A fierce battle erupted instantly.  

Meanwhile, Gu Yuan had already arrived at another spirit peak.
