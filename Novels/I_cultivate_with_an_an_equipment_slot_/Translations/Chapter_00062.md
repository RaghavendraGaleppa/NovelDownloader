# Chapter 62: First Place?

"Secret realm..."

After reading the flying sword message, Zhuge Wan's expression shifted repeatedly. 

Her peripheral glance swept over the seated Golden Core cultivators. She noticed they had all obtained the news through various means.

"It seems chaos is coming again," Zhuge Wan thought impassively. No matter how turbulent things became, it wouldn't affect their Qingheng Sect. 

After all, Qingheng Sect was backed by the Tianmu Mountain Range. Unless the demon beasts of Tianmu Mountain revolted, external disturbances would hardly impact them. However, the likelihood of a demon beast uprising was extremely low.

Compared to the yet-to-open secret realm, she cared more about whether Zhang Yan could achieve a good ranking in the competition.

Perhaps due to the new secret realm, Zhuge Wan could sense the Golden Core cultivators becoming distracted. Though their bodies remained watching the competition, their minds had long since wandered.

Unaware of the changes outside, Zhang Yan remained fully focused on studying the plant disease before him.

This particular disease was quite intriguing. Normally, a single disease would only affect one or a few types of spiritual plants. Yet, the disease introduced by the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace could affect all spiritual plants—this was highly abnormal. Moreover, commonly used remedies proved ineffective against it.

"What exactly is causing this?" Zhang Yan felt a headache coming on.

If even he was struggling, the remaining competitors were in worse shape. Many had already withdrawn from the competition. What kind of nonsense was this? They had come to participate in a competition, not deal with such absurd challenges.

At this moment, Zhang Yan finally identified the root of the problem. 

The so-called disease had actually contaminated the spiritual soil first before affecting the plants. He had initially assumed it was root transmission, which had misled his approach.

"Interesting."

Having found the culprit, Zhang Yan worked swiftly. Relying on his extensive experience and knowledge, he easily resolved the disease.

Watching Zhang Yan solve the problem, the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace overseer sighed deeply. "Truly, each new generation surpasses the last. I still remember when I encountered this issue—it took me over ten days to figure it out. I was quite proud of myself back then, but now I see such a prodigious young talent."

The speaker was a thin, dark-skinned elder. With his words, the competition had effectively ended. 

Their Ten Thousand Flowers Palace... had lost.

"But we still have the Flower Grafting technique!" another cultivator protested. With their signature technique, the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace had rarely suffered defeat.

In fact, sometimes all three top positions were claimed by their disciples.

"Flower Grafting is but a minor trick! True strength lies in solid foundations. Look at our current generation of disciples—the best among them has only achieved minor mastery in Flower Grafting. Yet, this young man has reached major mastery in two techniques. What a pity he isn't a disciple of our Ten Thousand Flowers Palace." The elder sighed regretfully. "Our palace was founded upon the path of spiritual plant cultivation!"

"Nowadays, talented individuals all pursue other paths. Those who come to study spiritual plants—look at them, just look! What sorry specimens they are. Once our generation passes, I wonder if the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace can maintain its dominance."

Hearing the elder's words, the other Ten Thousand Flowers Palace members exchanged glances but remained silent. None dared to respond, as their status was far below his.

After solving the disease issue, time flew by. In the blink of an eye, the final day arrived.

The growth in Zhang Yan's spiritual field was exceptionally promising. 

Lush spiritual rice and abundant spiritual melons filled the plot, presenting a bountiful sight.

"Time's almost up," announced the overseeing referee. Under the recording of the memory stone, he began tallying the harvest.

"It's over already?" 

Zhang Yan watched the referee organizing the harvest, somewhat incredulous.

"Damn, I didn't use the Wood Essence Technique for several days while treating the disease. Will that affect my ranking?" Zhang Yan worried.

By then, the referee had finished the evaluation.

To his astonishment, Zhang Yan's single acre of land had produced spiritual goods worth 500 spirit stones.

"You..."

The referee stared at the harvest, then at Zhang Yan, his voice trembling slightly. 

This guy was terrifying. 

A single acre of spiritual field had outperformed others by such a massive margin!

However, upon inspecting the field, the referee slowly relaxed. 

Though Zhang Yan had achieved staggering yields, it wasn't without cost—the spiritual energy in that acre of land had been nearly depleted. 

He had killed the goose that laid the golden eggs!

The referee consoled himself with this thought.

But... what nonsense was this?

To exhaust the land's potential required extraordinary skill in the first place!

He recalled that the previous record for a Qi Refining cultivator in the Spiritual Plant Competition was a harvest worth how much?

If he remembered correctly, it was 100 spirit stones per acre!

This guy had quintupled that!

He must have cheated!

That was the referee's first thought, but he quickly dismissed it. 

Cheating was impossible. 

He had personally overseen the entire process, and the memory stone recordings provided further proof. 

This guy was simply a monster. How could he be this skilled?

If only he belonged to the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace!

As the results were compiled, Zhang Yan returned to Zhuge Wan's side. 

Only then did he notice that Mu Sen and the others had arrived at some point.

"Master."

"You performed well in this competition. After returning, you may take whatever you desire from my spiritual plant garden." 

Zhuge Wan spoke calmly, though the corners of her lips curled slightly. "If you don't find what you want in my garden, you may also take from the sect leader's garden. Just say I permitted it."

Zhang Yan was baffled. Why would his master's reward extend to the sect leader's garden? 

What if he took that third-tier spiritual plant? Would the sect leader allow it?

He remembered a third-tier spiritual plant at the heart of the sect leader's garden, but he didn't dare mention it, much less take it. 

Such treasures were beyond the reach of a mere Qi Refining cultivator like him.

"Let's wait for the final results first. Senior Brother Mu, how did you all do?"

Zhang Yan turned to Mu Sen and the others.

Mu Sen: "..."

The other senior brothers and sisters: "..."

How should they respond?

They had initially thought their results were decent, but compared to Zhang Yan's, they were embarrassingly inadequate. 

Everyone knew Zhang Yan had likely broken records.

Finally, Mu Sen twitched his wooden face and spoke quietly, "Junior Brother, a secret realm is about to open."
