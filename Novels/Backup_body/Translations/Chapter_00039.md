# Chapter 39: A Former Enemy! The Crippled Gu Insect!

Yuan Zhengfeng possessed a robust physique. Even during his cultivation of external martial arts, he was exceptionally formidable. Since joining the sect, his reputation had soared, yet he never knew restraint.

Whether in the outer or inner sect, it was inevitable for elders to suppress disciples or senior brothers to bully juniors. But Yuan Zhengfeng, with his fiery temperament, would throw punches whenever he witnessed injustice!

Among them, the Great Elder of the inner sect, Chen Zhu, had entered the immortal sect in the same year as Yuan. Relying on the blessings of his "Chen Clan ancestors," he gained the sect's favor and became extremely arrogant, often oppressing his peers.

According to records, during their time in the outer sect, Chen Zhu had been beaten by Yuan Zhengfeng twelve times.

In the inner sect, Yuan Zhengfeng had struck him three more times.

However, later on, Chen Zhu advanced to the True Qi realm earlier and was no longer inferior to Yuan Zhengfeng, thus avoiding further beatings.

At that time, Yuan Zhengfeng's internal energy cultivation had reached its peak, and his formidable physique gave him a significant advantage. He was only slightly weaker than Chen Zhu, who had attained True Qi, and thus remained unafraid of him.

"What a pity. Elder Yuan lacked ambition, allowing Chen Zhu to advance to the True Qi realm first and depriving him of the chance to keep beating him up."

Li Zhengjing did the math—only fifteen beatings in total, none of which had crippled or killed Chen Zhu. It didn’t seem satisfying at all.

Disappointed, he flipped to the next page.

By the age of fifty, Yuan Zhengfeng had advanced to the True Qi realm. By then, Chen Zhu was already in the mid-to-upper echelons of the True Qi realm, his skills firmly surpassing Yuan Zhengfeng’s. Yet, the two never clashed again.

After all, both had reached the True Qi realm and ascended to the sect’s upper ranks, where too many considerations restrained them.

"No wonder Chen Zhu harbors such deep hatred for him. Beaten in the outer sect, beaten in the inner sect, and when he finally advanced to the True Qi realm first, he still couldn’t guarantee a sure victory…"

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "By the time Chen Zhu reached the mid-to-upper True Qi realm and was confident of winning, Elder Yuan had also advanced. It seems Chen Zhu never gained the upper hand against Elder Yuan—only suffered losses."

He continued reading.

After turning sixty, Yuan Zhengfeng became an inner sect elder. The following year, he was assigned to the Enforcement Hall.

During his tenure, Yuan Zhengfeng was strict, impartial, and upheld the law without favoritism, earning the respect of the Enforcement Hall’s chief. He was thus appointed as a long-term Enforcement Hall elder.

"During his time as an Enforcement Hall elder, he issued 3,200 disciplinary decrees?"

"Over a hundred disciples from the Chen Clan were punished, including that dead ghost Chen Youyu?"

"Moreover, thirty-two members of the Chen Clan were severely punished for violating sect rules and expelled from the mountain."

"And three were executed for grave crimes?"

Li Zhengjing kept reading and discovered another major reason for Chen Zhu’s hatred of Yuan Zhengfeng.

Earlier, a member of the Chen Clan had committed a capital offense. Chen Zhu had interceded, attempting to reduce the punishment from execution to expulsion.

But Yuan Zhengfeng reported him for attempted bribery and shielding his clansman. As a result, Chen Zhu was sentenced to ten years of confinement in the rear mountain, forbidden to take a single step outside!

"Wasn’t that like sentencing Chen Zhu to ten years in prison?"

Li Zhengjing’s expression turned odd.

Further records showed that aside from the Chen Clan, other inner sect elders, their disciples, and relatives had also been punished by Yuan Zhengfeng to varying degrees.

Yuan Zhengfeng never showed favoritism. Even former friends and fellow disciples who violated sect rules faced his disciplinary actions.

Over time, his old friends and those he had once protected grew distant.

Meanwhile, his former adversaries’ hatred only deepened.

"What a paragon of justice."

Li Zhengjing couldn’t help but sigh. "The sect’s atmosphere must have been impeccable back then. Something like Chen Youyu suppressing me would never have happened…"

He closed the dossier and set it aside, then carefully placed the broken jade disk back.

Silently, he counted the days. Less than twenty remained before the return of the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.

Over the next two days, using the merits left by Elder Yuan Zhengfeng and his own remaining credits, Li Zhengjing visited the scripture repository to exchange for a movement technique manual.

He felt that his movement skills were a fatal weakness in combat.

For instance, during the capture of the evil cultivator in Wanlin County, if he had mastered movement techniques, he wouldn’t have had to worry about the enemy escaping.

More importantly, he envied Elder Shi, whom he had once slashed. Renowned for his movement skills in the True Qi realm, Elder Shi possessed exceptional survival abilities.

"Life is so dull for humans," the Hanging Bird lamented. "We birds are born with wings—we can fly whenever we want. Who needs movement techniques?"

"Bah! Eagles eat little birds. So what if you’re a Divine White Phoenix? If you meet a great avian demon, won’t you just get snatched up midair?" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its newly sprouted tender branch in mockery.

"Bird Lord thinks you don’t want that new hand of yours anymore!"

With a flick of its wing, sharp as a blade, the Hanging Bird severed the tender branch.

"Ah… my hand…"

The Five Elements Creation Tree extended its roots from the soil, waving them frantically. "Master, he cut me! He cut off my hand!"

Li Zhengjing frowned, anger rising. "You two are utterly shameless! Wasting time, neglecting cultivation! White Hanging, do you know how much effort I spent nurturing that tender branch before you casually chopped it off?"

"Master, how much water should I add to brew the Five Elements Creation Paste?" The Hanging Bird held the freshly severed branch, asking earnestly.

"For such a small piece, half a pot is enough," Li Zhengjing replied.

"Got it." The Hanging Bird flew toward the stove.

"…"

The Five Elements Creation Tree vaguely sensed that even if the Hanging Bird hadn’t cut it this time, the master would have found another opportunity to do so.

But then it reconsidered—the master had been nurturing it diligently lately, changing its soil and watering it with great care, treating it like his own child. Such sincerity couldn’t possibly be feigned.

"The master punished it with hard labor."

Li Zhengjing patted the Five Elements Creation Tree’s trunk, speaking earnestly. "After all, it’s a guest, and you’re part of the household. As hosts, we should tolerate our guests a little. Besides, I’ve been nurturing you all this time and haven’t given it any special treatment…"

The Five Elements Creation Tree was deeply moved. "So the master truly sees me as his own tree, while that bird remains an outsider…"

"Focus on your cultivation, absorb spiritual energy from all directions, and grow your upper half soon. Once your body is complete, you’ll be the master’s pride and joy."

Li Zhengjing encouraged it further. "When you’ve grown a bit more, I’ll transplant you into a pure gold pot—a proper home for you!"

"Thank you for your nurturing, Master! This humble one will strive to absorb spiritual energy and grow swiftly!"

"Keep it up!"

Li Zhengjing nodded, thinking to himself, "This tree has grown lazy lately. It needs to work harder so the spiritual energy it gathers will be richer, greatly benefiting my cultivation!"

Just as he pondered this, the courtyard gate was knocked.

He opened it to find the Fake Medicine Peddler standing outside.

But this time, the peddler hadn’t come to deliver a medicine cauldron.

"Brother Li, do you want a Gu insect?"

"Yes!"

Li Zhengjing nodded without hesitation, then eyed him suspiciously. "You’re not trying to fool me with another poisonous insect, are you?"

The Fake Medicine Peddler didn’t explain. Instead, he retrieved a medicine cauldron and opened it quietly. Inside lay a black cicada, its aura feeble.

A crimson bloodline streaked across its carapace.

And its left side was missing a leg.

"A black cicada? The Gu insect from that barbarian half a year ago?"

Li Zhengjing’s expression darkened instantly. "Where did you get this?"
