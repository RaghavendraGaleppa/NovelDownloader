# Chapter 151: Peerless Figure

When Dugu Jiu's figure vanished into the horizon, three thousand steel blades crumbled into iron dust, each leaving an inch-long sword mark on the wielder's虎口 (tiger's mouth/hand grip).

On the Observing Star Platform, the blood pool suddenly erupted with a three-zhang high wave of blood, and Guo Lang's Daoist crown was blown away by the shockwave.

The exposed skin of his scalp bulged with veins, and the jade-white sinews glowed with a cold light under the moonlight.

The twelve main blood urns let out mournful cries simultaneously, and the black iron chains at their mouths were melted into molten iron by the boiling vital blood within.

Guo Lang had to stop his actions, staring blankly at the blood urns before him.

"Why did you stop?"

The Empress's voice came from beneath the Nine Dragons Canopy, the twelve tassels of her jade crown swaying slightly.

The golden bricks with the Black Bird patterns beneath her feet were cracking, with dark red impurities from the earth's veins seeping out from the cracks.

*Clang!*

Guo Lang staggered and knelt in the center of the star map, looking at the Taiyi Splitting Light Sword in his hands breaking apart inch by inch, his expression dazed. The peerless divine weapon passed down through the Ghost Valley generations could not withstand the backlash of heaven and earth and shattered.

"It's still lacking... still lacking three million living souls to complete the Heaven and Earth Bridge... Now, it's still a bit short."

With a bitter expression, he suddenly recalled the ancient silk scroll he saw yesterday in the密室 (secret room) of the Imperial Observatory, hidden within the Ghost Valley.

*Nine million blood sacrifices can reverse fate.*

At the time, he had circled this number heavily with a vermilion brush, the tip of the brush tearing through three sheets of宣纸 (rice paper), before finally erasing it completely.

The Empress's face darkened as she looked up at the sky, where the auras of the primordial spirits were gradually fading.

When the Empress stood up, the sun, moon, and stars on her twelve-patterned black robe began to reverse.

"Then let the Incense Offering Sect go to Jiannan Dao, to Monan Dao, to... Jiangnan Dao!"

The Golden Radiance Sword at her waist unsheathed itself by half a foot, its light illuminating the inscriptions on the base of the Observing Star Platform.

*Bestowed by Heaven, long live and prosper.*

Guo Lang remained expressionless and silent.

"The earth dragon is turning!"

Below, the guards on the walls of the Jade Capital shouted in terror.

The battlements began to crumble, and the moat flowed backward into the city.

The morning bell of the Monan Maitreya Temple rang on its own, and cracks appeared on the surface of the eight hundred bronze bells.

The Abbot, Liao Chen, felt his prayer beads shatter. The old monk pressed his wrinkled hand against the ground, clearly feeling the violent surging within the earth's veins.

His thin, withered back suddenly straightened, and the sound of metal clashing came from beneath his kasaya. A golden luster appeared on his body, like a gilded statue.

"Abbot, should we deploy the Arhat Hall?" asked the head monk, looking at the tilting Great Hero Hall.

Abbot Liao Chen closed his eyes and let out a long sigh. "The turning of the earth dragon is a natural disaster; it cannot be stopped by human power."

The black iron foundation at the bottom of the Observing Star Platform suddenly cracked, and the tendons in Guo Lang's left leg made a sound of unbearable strain.

He knelt on one knee. The hexagrams in the blood pool were only three away from completion, but seven of the twelve main blood urns had already exploded.

"Minister Guo!"

Seeing this, the Empress could no longer restrain her emotions. Her furious shout caused roof tiles to fall.

The Great Zhou Emperor suddenly shattered the golden bricks and shot onto the Observing Star Platform like a hawk.

Her宫靴 (palace boots) with Black Bird patterns stepped on the edge of the blood pool, and her golden-threaded soft armor glowed coldly under the moonlight. "My Golden Radiance Sword can sever the earth's veins!"

Guo Lang's pupils constricted.

"Your Majesty, you must not!"

Guo Lang's warning was drowned out by the sword's cry.

The moment the Golden Radiance Sword struck the blood pool, a roar like that of a prehistoric beast came from underground.

The twelve Dragon Pillars snapped in response. The tendons in Guo Lang's right arm suddenly burst, and the jade-white sinews shot out like bowstrings, whipping deep, three-inch grooves into the pillars.

Deep in the Guixu of the East Sea, the Zhenhai Tower of the Penglai Pavilion was slowly tilting.

Fairy Yunlan walked barefoot on the waves, and the vortex stirred by her Water-Splitting Stingers suddenly exploded into a hundred-zhang water curtain.

Her wheat-colored skin shimmered with a silver light like water patterns, and wisps of refined energy circled her body, making her look like a celestial being descended to the mortal world.

"Pavilion Master, the sea eye is beginning to flow backward!" a长老 (elder) roared, his voice drowned out by the sound of the waves.

Yunlan looked at the reddening horizon in the west, a strange look on her face.

Suddenly, she turned her head.

"Go into the sea. Open the sea eye."

The Golden Radiance Sword on the Observing Star Platform suddenly chipped, and blood welled from the Empress's grip.

Guo Lang struggled to prop himself up with his broken right arm, shouting hoarsely, "Quick, retract the sword! The dragon energy of the earth's veins is about to counterattack!"

Before his words finished, a continuous, muffled thunder came from beneath the Jade Capital.

The ground of the thirty-six districts collapsed simultaneously, revealing the赤红色 (crimson red) magma of the earth's veins beneath.

The jade meridians in Guo Lang's left leg finally snapped completely. He fell like a rag doll onto the position of the阵眼 (formation eye), watching the last three blood urns turn into molten iron in the magma.

"Why?"

The Empress's black robe was scorched by the subterranean fire, her golden skin covered in cracks, her expression filled with a hint of confusion and helplessness.

A century of planning had come to nothing. The entire Observing Star Platform was collapsing.

Guo Lang spat out a mouthful of blood and gave a bitter smile. "Three million living souls are not enough to complete the Heaven and Earth Bridge. Your Majesty, have you ever heard of the saying 'The dragon flies too high, it will have regrets'? In this era, the stars have not yet returned to their positions, and the earth's veins are still dormant. To forcefully open the primordial spirits, heaven and earth will not permit it. At best, this will be like two thousand years ago, a brief period where the primordial spirits are about to scatter but have not yet done so. A few decades later, they will fall silent again.

Even if you throw in another thirty million living souls, it will be futile! Your Majesty, give up. Human power cannot overcome the will of heaven. This is destiny, the will of Heaven!"

"You deceived me!!"

The Empress's expression turned fierce. Her hair, gray with streaks of green, rose without wind, writhing like snakes.

Her eyes were filled with endless killing intent and fury.

"I appointed you as the head of the Imperial Observatory, granted your family endless wealth and honor. Whatever you wanted, I gave you. Whatever you wished to do, I allowed it. Your status is no less than that of Minister Fang; you are second only to me, above a myriad officials.

Why did you deceive me?!"

As she spoke, thunderous rumbles rolled from her throat, shattering the long sky. The visible sound waves even spread throughout the entire Jade Capital.

Guo Lang gave a bitter smile.

"Your Majesty, in this world, you were born in the wrong era. If it were five hundred years later, no, three hundred years later, perhaps you could truly pursue the path of longevity. Now, no matter how hard you try, you can only force out the primordial spirits hidden beneath the earth's veins. I have tried too many times."

After a long while, the Empress let out a long sigh. Just as she was about to say something, she suddenly grabbed the violently trembling Golden Radiance Sword.

She looked up sharply, her gaze piercing through the clouds, looking towards the distance.

The head of the Imperial Observatory, who was about to speak, suddenly felt a stinging pain all over his body, as if pointed by thousands of invisible sword tips.

The golden threads on the Empress's twelve-patterned black robe suddenly snapped. She was horrified to find that the surface of the Dragon Pillar three zhang away was, at some unknown time, covered with hair-thin sword marks.

"Sword Qi... it's ninth-realm Sword Qi!" Guo Lang roared hoarsely, and the star plate in his hand cracked in two.

The three thousand six hundred bronze lamps around the Observing Star Platform went out simultaneously, but the blood in the blood urns continued to boil.

When Dugu Jiu's figure appeared above the clouds, the sound of ten thousand swords rang out across the entire Jade Capital.

The seventy-six famous inherited swords in the Six扇门 (Six Gates) vaults flew out of their repositories. The ordinary iron swords in teahouses and taverns trembled and stabbed into the beams, and even the wooden swords in the hands of children pointed towards the same direction.
