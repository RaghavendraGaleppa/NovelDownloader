# Chapter 209: The Non-Aggression Pact and the Top of the Hidden Dragon List

**【Hidden Dragon List, 18th Place: Ying Bing.】**

**【Martial Arts:** Divine Observation Two Apertures, Sword Heart Clarity, Martial Arts Attainment has reached Creation Level, Possesses an extremely powerful secret technique, suspected to be able to observe Divine Forms.】

**【Battle Record:** Current Chief Disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect, Sword Hero of Yun Province. Within the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, she joined forces with Li Mo to repel Han Zhen and Yin Huaxuan, forcing them to retreat in defeat. While at Divine Observation One Aperture, she defeated the Heavenly Demoness who was at Divine Observation Three Apertures. While observing a strange stone atop the Sword Pavilion, she comprehended a style of Divine Art. At Divine Observation Two Apertures, she shattered the Heavenly Demon Illusion Form with her sword.】

**【Title:** Moon Sword Phoenix, Cold Fairy.】

The shore of the Yulong Lake suddenly fell silent. Just moments ago, the voices clamoring to bring Young Master Li back as a son-in-law had all died down.

No one had ever seen a figure of such youth receive such an evaluation from the Heaven Prying Sect in their lifetime. If one were to search for anyone comparable, they could only count the legendary figures of the past.

Everyone realized they might be witnessing history in the making.

"I'm over fifty years old and haven't even mastered a single supreme martial art, yet her martial arts attainment has reached Creation Level?"

"I was fortunate enough to hear her lecture at the Sword Pool. I lowered my head to pick up my brush, and when I looked up, I couldn't understand what she was saying anymore."

"She's only at Divine Observation Two Apertures. If her realm catches up one day, won't it be easy for her to seize the top spot on the Hidden Dragon List?"

"The fact that she made Yin Mianmian, the sixth on the list,接连 suffer setbacks is enough to prove her worth."

"If it weren't for her and Young Master Li this time, the Hengyun Sword City might have been in danger of losing a supreme treasure!"

"I thought 'The霸道 Empress Falls in Love with Me' was just an illustrated book, but it turns out that was still too conservative."

"Who has the latest issue of the illustrated book? I haven't been able to buy one for three days, I feel like ants are crawling all over me."

"Hiss... Wait, Young Master Li is a wife-lucker, and Ying Xianzi's talent is unparalleled in history. If the two of them..."

...

The shore of the Yulong Lake was in a state of chaos for a time.

Hengyun Sword City, atop the Sword Pavilion.

The Sword Pavilion towered into the clouds. From here, one could faintly see the Dragon Gate if they looked far into the distance. Of course, for certain powerful experts, this distance was still enough to see the Dragon Gate clearly.

At this moment, Tian Miao was sitting at a stone table, pouring herself a bowl of blood-nourishing soup boiled with蛟皮 and donkey-hide gelatin. As she drank, she fell into deep thought.

Although she couldn't see through the young man's fate, the Heaven Prying Sect's information channels weren't limited to just the Walkers. There were various other sources.

From what the Heaven Prying Sect had already掌握ed, the description of Li Mo on the Hidden Dragon List was evasive, avoiding the important points.

It didn't even mark the words 'Yinghuo' (Mars/Fiery Star).

What was her Master considering by doing this?

"Thank you, Walker Tian Miao."

The white-haired youth, Elder Xu, finally let out a sigh of relief.

The character 'Sword' was saved.

"For what?"

Tian Miao, whose complexion had improved somewhat, looked up and asked.

Another elderly Law Body Elder was stunned for a moment:

"Uh, it's about that kid comprehending the strange stone..."

"..."

Tian Miao was a bit confused. She had fainted due to the backlash from her Fate Observation Technique at the time and had no idea what happened afterward.

*What exactly did he comprehend?*

A moment later, she smiled lightly:

"That's to be expected. No need to mention it."

...

Inside the Painted Boat Mansion.

Hearing that a new courtesan had arrived here, with a graceful demeanor and天生媚骨, some people abandoned the Hidden Dragon List to come here to listen to music, hoping to become her guest of honor.

The sounds of silk and bamboo were pleasant, the zither and se were melodious.

In the small courtyard, the crowd gathered to listen to the music gradually became mesmerized, as if they had seen a celestial maiden descend to the world, filled with lingering passion and tenderness.

Then,不知 who moved first, they started fighting, fighting until their heads were broken and blood flowed.

The madam seemed to have习以为常, and directly walked behind the screen.

"Holy Maiden, Xu Yi still hasn't sent back any news."

"He might already be dead. It seems that kid is determined to draw a clear line with the Drizzle Tower."

There was no response for a long time. The madam didn't dare to say anything more.

The Holy Maiden had become a backdrop for two people in a row, and in Yun Province, the reputation of the Drizzle Tower had also been greatly affected, to the point where people almost lost their sense of awe.

If there were stocks or something, they would be terrifyingly green, urgently needing to release some good news...

After a long while, Yin Mianmian seemed to have come back to her senses:

---

"Then go change the bounty, and increase it by ten times."

"Yes."

...

**【Hidden Dragon List, 17th: He Jinhuan.】**

**【Hidden Dragon List, 16th: Huikong.】**

...

The Hidden Dragon List continued to flash with the names of one genius after another like flowing water.

"Tch... Look at that nickname."

Young Master Li wasn't surprised by Ice Cube's ranking at all.

Only one spot apart, how could the nicknames be so different? Are they even from the same style?

Forget it, anything is better than something like 'Flying Venom Green-Haired Turtle'.

Thinking of Huang Donglai's nickname, Li Mo's mood improved a lot. He pouted and laughed:

"Moon Sword Phoenix?"

"..."

Ice Cube's deep and quiet eyes swept over him slightly, the hand holding the tea cup curled up a bit.

Read but no reply.

Li Mo's smile grew even wider as he called out again: "Cold Fairy?"

"..." Ying Bing swallowed her tea, her slender brows slightly raised:

"Wife-Lucker Fighting Soul?"

"Hiss..."

Li Mo sucked in a cold breath, goosebumps falling all over the ground.

He couldn't imagine at all what would happen if someone came to challenge him in the future, and the first thing they said was these four words.

It would be a truly embarrassing social death scene...

However, Ice Cube put down her teacup, propping her chin with one hand.

She was quiet for a few seconds, then looked straight into Li Mo's eyes and added:

"Wife-Lucker Fighting Soul?"

"...... I was the one being unreasonable just now."

He never expected that one day Ice Cube would learn to deliver the finishing blow.

Young Master Li was now well-behaved.

Seeing this, the corner of Ying Bing's eyes carried an imperceptible satisfaction.

Perhaps because of something, she seemed a bit happy?

She wasn't quite sure herself.

Maybe it was because... she finally ranked higher than Li Mo?

Then the next system ranking should also be...

Afterwards.

They paid no mind to Elder Qian and Elder Xue who were frantically slapping each other's philtrums, nor to the Senior Brothers and Sisters who were dumbfounded and doubting their lives.

The two sides signed a Non-Aggression Pact, and from now on, neither would call the other by their nickname.

"Chulong, you be the witness. From now on, no one is allowed to call each other by nicknames... Chulong?"

As Li Mo spoke, he turned his head.

却发现 Little Princess Jiang's expression was a bit off. Her little鹅蛋脸 was blank, staring at the Hidden Dragon List within the Dragon Gate, her lips almost biting through to draw blood.

Li Mo followed her line of sight and looked towards the center of the lake.

**【Hidden Dragon List, 2nd: Xie Xuan】**

**【Hidden Dragon List, 1st: Jiang Yu】**

**【Martial Arts:** Possesses a True Dragon Body, also obtained the Bone of the Imperial Sword, born sacred and extraordinary. Already able to observe the Map of Rivers and Mountains, bearing the ten thousand directions of the Nine Provinces, has a wisp of Dynasty Qi added to his body,掌握了 the Dragon Transformation Method, mastered the Shangfang Imperial Sword Technique...】

**【Battle Record:** Among his peers, has never suffered a defeat. Captured the Giant Whale of the Vast Sea in the North Sea. Fought for several days against the Saint Son of the Summon Demon Cult, who was once the number one on the Hidden Dragon List, and killed him after a breakthrough in the heat of battle.】

Jiang Chulong's little鹅蛋脸 suddenly turned whiter than snow.

She frantically wiped her tears, her speech becoming even more incoherent:

"I... I... I'm fine..."

"That is the Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty." A voice transmission sounded in her ear from Ying Bing.

Hmm... both have the surname Jiang, and he is the number one on the Hidden Dragon List.

He is one of Jiang Chulong's closest relatives, and also her deepest nightmare.
