# Chapter 138: Parents and the Ice Cube's Feedback (Part 1)

Outside Red Maple Mountain.

The entire mountain range was in turmoil, as if it were on the verge of collapsing.

"An earthquake? There has never been an earthquake in Qinghe County before."

"It's the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm! Something's wrong!"

"Is the secret realm about to collapse!?"

"The Blood Phoenix Secret Realm has existed for such a long time. Why now?"

"Does this mean the inheritance has been taken, causing it to shatter?"

...

The crowd around the mountain peaks was in chaos.

Those who had come to watch the spectacle scattered like birds, fleeing in all directions.

Shaking mountains and moving earth were natural disasters; not everyone had the strength to resist them.

*Rumble—*

The rumbling grew even more intense.

The aura from within the secret realm had already leaked out.

Several figures stood suspended in mid-air, unleashing their own domains.

"Everyone, this secret realm seems to be shattering," said the white-browed elder from Hengyun Sword City, standing at the forefront.

Among everyone present, he was the only one at the Fifth Realm, the External Scene Realm.

Qian Bufan, feeling the leaking aura, narrowed his eyes, his chubby face tightening.

"I wonder what kind of anomaly has occurred inside."

"Rescuing people is the top priority. I hope everyone can set aside their sectarian differences and disperse to rescue them. What do you say?"

A secret realm collapse is not something that those at the Internal Breathing Realm or even the Divine Observation Realm can withstand.

As soon as he finished speaking.

A money tree appeared within Qian Bufan's domain, the coins on it looking as real as could be.

Jingling and swaying, they wrapped around him as he charged into the secret realm.

Before entering, he looked far into the distance, as if locking eyes with someone.

The others did not hesitate for long.

One by one, those at the Internal and External Scene Realities used their own methods to charge into the gradually disintegrating secret realm.

...

Qinghe County.

The commotion of the shaking earth also reached here.

The people were panicked, living in constant fear, afraid that the city might collapse with the mountain.

Inside a certain courtyard in the West Alley.

"Master, the earth dragon has turned over. We probably won't have time to run away," said a middle-aged woman, her clothes elegant, her youthful beauty still faintly visible. Tears streamed down her face, her expression resolute. "Even if I die, I want to die with you."

"Don't be afraid, Qin'er. As long as I'm here, we will never be separated, even in death."

The middle-aged man she leaned against stood tall and straight, with handsome, chiseled features. Anyone who saw him would call him a man who could hold up the sky.

The two of them seemed to be enacting a tragic romance before the end of the world.

Beside them.

Xue Jing: "....."

Elder Su: "....."

Elder Shen from Ruyi Peak: "....."

Shang Cangcang: "......"

Shang Wu: "Snoring... smack."

Setting aside Shang Wu, who was sleeping soundly and not even woken by the earthquake, the others felt they were superfluous, completely ignored.

No... it didn't seem like they were being ignored.

They had become part of the play.

*Thud—*

At that moment.

Shang Cangcang gently lifted his foot and stomped the ground.

Strangely enough, the shaking of the earth and the trembling of the mountains were instantly quelled, as if they had never existed.

Not just the Li Mansion.

The entire Qinghe County fell silent.

After the silence fell, the middle-aged couple was still hugging and weeping.

"Cough, Dalong," Xue Jing said, his mouth twitching. This was his former disciple. He gave him a meaningful look. "The Sect Master is here."

The middle-aged man, called Li Dalong, was stunned for a moment before he awkwardly laughed and said, "My apologies, my apologies. My wife and I were overcome with emotion. We couldn't help it, we couldn't help it..."

Xue Jing: "....."

Facing the puzzled looks from the other elders, his old face flushed slightly, and he sighed.

He really wanted to clarify something solemnly.

---

Li Dalong's theatrical personality has absolutely nothing to do with him!

"It's time for us to go," Shang Cangcang said softly, his hands behind his back.

...

On the other side.

Inside the secret realm.

It was now truly like a scene of heaven falling and earth perishing.

They all wanted to get out, but there was no way out of this space. Even if they wanted to run, there was nowhere to go.

Run upwards?

The battle up there wasn't over yet.

Run downwards? The entrance they came from had already vanished!

Up above.

Li Mo's aura was rapidly falling.

He could no longer use the power of the world, and the Blood-soaked Battle Soul Talisman's time was up.

Little Bao Shixiong crawled out of his Dantian, his small face pale. He lay on the ground, panting heavily with his tongue out.

Li Mo could only use his last shred of will to recall the Panjie Meteorite Hammer.

Then he slumped to the ground, letting the intense weakness wash over his entire nervous system.

"Brat! You have ruined my hundred-year plan!"

Han Zhen's expression was ferocious. The body, powered by the bones of the掌玄 (Palm Mystic), had already aged as if it were rotten wood.

This clone could not be kept.

The only thing he could do was kill the other to vent his anger.

Yin Huaxuan stood motionless. After receiving Han Zhen's signal, he crushed a stone seal, and a wisp of pure black aura surged out.

A sharp sound echoed through the sky.

This was a call to the people from the Demon Summoning Sect who were supposed to guide them.

Meanwhile, Han Zhen, filled with hatred, launched his final attack toward Li Mo.

It was that palm strike again, carrying a profound aura.

This was also a supreme technique, activated by the remains of the Palm Mystic, its power terrifying.

Previously, it had only been slightly inferior when clashing with the Panjie Meteorite Hammer.

Now, Li Mo had no way to block it whatsoever.

However.

Little Li was not panicked at all; in fact, he even smiled.

He had already heard the system's notification sound just moments ago.

"Sever!"

A cold, clear voice fell to the ground.

A stunning sword light shone once more, as if slashing down from the ninth heaven.

*Pfft—*

The sword light swept past.

In the midst of his utter horror, the elderly Han Zhen only managed to barely twist his body, causing the sword light that was meant to bisect him to land on his shoulder.

"Ah!!"

Han Zhen's arm was not severed.

Because the Frost Slash did not target the physical body.

The Sword of No-Self can sever the soul.

This arm of his had already been 'killed.' No matter where his soul returned to, his hand was废 (useless).

A quarter of an hour had already passed!

Han Zhen was unwilling.

He wanted to attack again.

*Swoosh—*

Sword light crisscrossed, carving a deep trench in front of him.

Han Zhen abruptly looked up.

He saw Ying Bing standing guard in front of a certain person, sword drawn, her gaze icy.

"Cross this line, and you die."

That gaze seemed to pierce through to the depths of his soul, sending a deep chill to the core of his being.

It made one unable to doubt those three words in the slightest.

Han Zhen fell silent.

A few breaths later, he gave the two of them a deep look, the light in his eyes fading.

The body collapsed powerlessly to the ground, its flesh and blood rapidly vanishing, turning back into a skeleton.

Yin Huaxuan shot up into the sky.

Sounds of various battles echoed from the outside again.

But our Little Li had no heart to pay attention to any of it.

Sitting behind the Ice Cube, he braced himself.

After a laborious day, Li Mo couldn't help but check the rewards he had just obtained.
