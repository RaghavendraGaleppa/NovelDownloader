# Chapter 563: News from the Heavenly Realm

Tian Yan Zhenren paused slightly, his gaze sweeping over Lu Chuan. Seeing no reaction from him, he continued, his tone softening a little.

"However... Xue He—also known as you all's Blood Ancestor Devil—had a heart fallen to the demonic path. As his lifespan neared its end, he was plagued by the Five Turbidities and his Six Senses were obscured. He actually brazenly charged into Shen Xiao Peak in broad daylight, mobilized his Foundation Establishment, and attempted to slaughter his fellow sect members. He had already severed ties with the sect and acted like a traitor.

"His violent deeds are there for all to see. For you to execute him was to eliminate a great scourge for the sect and avert a major disaster. In this matter, you have performed a merit!"

After establishing the nature of the situation, came the turn.

This was entirely perfunctory talk.

Although Xu Yunfan had committed a taboo, Blood Ancestor Devil was far more deserving of death. Killing him was a merit that far outweighed the offense.

This was a verdict delivered on behalf of the Sect Master. Although it still sounded official, it was enough to clear Xu Yunfan of the biggest charge: "maliciously harming fellow sect members."

Of course, the restraining influence of the power represented by Lu Chuan was indispensable in this.

Xu Yunfan naturally understood that this matter was far from over. It was impossible for it to be a severe punishment on the surface but lenient in reality. Just then, he heard Tian Yan Zhenren's tone shift.

"However, while merit and demerit can offset each other..."

Tian Yan Zhenren's gaze once again locked sharply onto Xu Yunfan, a hint of a smile appearing on his face.

"Xue He bore a heavy responsibility for the sect, which he had yet to complete. Now that he is dead, the primary responsibility for this unfinished business naturally falls on you, the main party involved. You must shoulder this duty."

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged, but his mind raced. He glanced at Lu Chuan, who remained silent. He understood in his heart; it seemed the two sides had reached an exchange, and his status in this matter had been fixed.

He asked cautiously, "May I ask the Sect Master, what is this heavy responsibility?"

"Under the jurisdiction of the Primordial Origin Sect, we have detected a newly ascended realm whose boundary membrane is still firm. The natives of this realm call it the Heavenly Realm," Tian Yan Zhenren said slowly. "This realm has been gestating for a long time, and there are clear traces of a Dao Fruit manifesting within it. It is a realm with immense potential."

A Dao Fruit!

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted.

Having experienced the affairs of the Divine Martial Realm, he naturally knew the weight of the term "Dao Fruit."

It is the condensation of the laws of heaven and earth, the foundation for achieving Zhenjun.

With the stature of the Primordial Origin Sect, they would naturally covet the Dao Fruit gestating within that realm.

These lofty Golden Core Zhenjuns would certainly not let it go.

Absorbing a Dao Fruit from another realm into one's own Cave Heaven would bring immense benefits.

Xu Yunfan immediately asked, "Since a Dao Fruit is gestating, the will of that realm's Dao must be vigorous. Could there already be a Golden Core Zhenjun who has achieved the Dao locally guarding it?"

A hint of indifference appeared on Tian Yan Zhenren's face. "Whether there is a Zhenjun within that realm is still unknown. Even if there is, a Zhenjun born from a small, newly formed realm is merely a firefly in the face of the full moon before the Zhenjuns of our sect. You need not worry about matters on that level; the sect's Zhenjuns will handle them."

Only then did Lu Chuan speak, his voice steady.

"Junior Brother Xu, although this trip is to shoulder a responsibility, it may also be a great opportunity. This Heavenly Realm is newly opened, with the essence of heaven and earth permeating it and its rules just beginning to manifest.

"If you can lead the vanguard disciples and establish a sufficiently powerful Dharma Domain stronghold within this realm, and even assist the sect's Zhenjuns in guiding its essence, anchoring it into the main world of the Taihua Spirit Ruins...

"Then not only will the sect reward you, but the Dao of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World will also reward you. The immense功德 (merit) you will receive can pave the way for your future path to the Golden Core."

Golden Core!

Xu Yunfan naturally understood.

Matters involving the quest for the Golden Core and the proof of the Dao are fraught with great risk. A place where a Dao Fruit is gestating will inevitably see great battles.

But the rewards are also extremely tempting.

The merit spoken of by Lu Chuan is the purest馈赠 (gift) from the Dao of Heaven. It is more precious than any heavenly treasure or spiritual material; it can directly enhance one's Foundation, Fortune, and even improve one's Innate Aptitude and Comprehension.

If one accumulates enough merit and makes great contributions to this realm, one might even be directly supported by the Heavenly Dao as the Son of Destiny of that realm. At that time...

It would truly be the fate of finding money just by stepping out of the door, finding a legacy cave by falling off a cliff, and discovering spiritual marrow in a meal.

Moreover, Senior Brother Lu Chuan personally spoke up to clarify; this was almost an expectation and an investment from the lineage of Zhenjun Qingyuan for his journey.

He instantly understood the meaning behind Lu Chuan's previous silence and clearly felt the balance Tian Yan Zhenren was maintaining under the pressure from both factions.

"This disciple understands!" Xu Yunfan's mind was made up. He no longer hesitated and said resolutely, "This is a heavy trust from the sect. This disciple dares not refuse and will dedicate all his strength to clear all obstacles, seizing the Heavenly Realm for our Primordial Origin Sect!"

Seeing him agree so readily, both Tian Yan Zhenren and Lu Chuan's eyes flashed with a hint of approval.

Look, how beautifully he phrased it. "Clearing obstacles for the Primordial Origin Sect"—it was a pleasure to hear.

Truly excellent.

If he had been hesitant and evasive, it would have naturally left a bad taste.

But Xu Yunfan was like this.

He knew his place.

Regardless of what Xu Yunfan was thinking in his heart, his actions demonstrated loyalty.

Even sages judge people by their actions, not their thoughts.

Tian Yan Zhenren nodded. "Good! As the Sect Master, I must uphold justice. Since you are shouldering this heavy responsibility, according to sect惯例 (convention), as the commander of the vanguard, whatever you obtain within the Heavenly Realm—excluding items the sect's Zhenjuns have explicitly designated to be kept, such as the Dao Fruit itself—is yours to keep. I and the sect will not take a single share."

This was equivalent to granting Xu Yunfan a near-unlimited license for plunder.

The vanguard breaking into a new realm, with the收益 (gains) belonging to oneself, has always been the greatest incentive the Primordial Origin Sect offers to its pioneers.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a surge of joy.

To be honest, with Zhenjuns intervening, the invasion of another realm already came with a major insurance policy. What was there to fear?

This compensation was far too generous.

He was more than willing!

Loyalty!

However, Lu Chuan Zhenren then slowly added, "However, Junior Brother Xu, there is one more thing you must remember. This Heavenly Realm was not discovered by our sect alone.

"According to reliable intelligence, those sword-crazed maniacs from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect have also detected the fluctuations from this realm.

"At that time, there may be clashes on the level of the Zhenjuns between the two sects, but the true battlefield will still be among you Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"The counterattack from the Heavenly Realm's natives is secondary. The true sword cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, with their peerless killing arts and extreme personalities, might be your greatest opponents on this journey. Their swords are not easy to deal with."

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Xu Yunfan felt a chill in his heart. To be described as having "extreme personalities" by a Zhenjun of a Demonic Sect, that was truly saying something.

He had never had a direct confrontation with the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, aside from his interactions with the Pure Yang Ancestor. This time, he would have to see what they were like.

An image of his clone, Han Shi, paying respects at their mountain gate flashed through his mind.

Now, his clone Han Shi was thriving inside.

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother Lu. This disciple will be careful," Xu Yunfan said with a solemn expression, his voice heavy. "I will definitely handle it with caution!"

Lu Chuan nodded slightly and gave his final instructions, his tone filled with genuine concern.

"Remember, your life is paramount. If the situation turns unfavorable, if the environment within the realm is too perilous, or if you encounter an enemy you cannot resist, prioritize your safety. You can withdraw through the channel at any time.

"Don't be bound by the gains and losses of a single moment or place, and certainly don't fight to the death. As long as the green hills remain, there will be a time to rise again! The Zhenjuns are standing behind you."
