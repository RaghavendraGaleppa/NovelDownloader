# Chapter 50: The Ways of the World

Taihe Sect.

Sect Leader Zhang Jingxiu had already passed sixty years of age. Apart from his graying hair, his physical features resembled those of a middle-aged man. His broad sleeves hinted at well-defined muscles, exuding an imposing presence.

"Ruowang, bring me the item to examine."

Xiao Ruowang hurriedly presented the Heart-Mending Pill.

After inspecting it, Zhang Jingxiu remarked, "It is indeed the Heart-Mending Pill, nearly identical to what I saw in my youth. I never expected the alchemical legacy of Qingfu Temple to be revived by Tiannan Province's new top scholar. Master Fushan spent his life indifferent to fame and fortune, yet ultimately it was someone from scholarly circles who inherited his alchemical mantle. And..."

Zhang sighed inwardly. The boy was only sixteen—already the top scholar of the provincial exams and possessing such talent in alchemy. Truly, the gap between people's innate gifts could be wider than that between humans and dogs.

Though Zhou Qing's talent was rare, Zhang had seen similar prodigies before. The Tang family's young scholar, for instance, was versed in both literature and martial arts, inheriting the family's Overlord Spear technique. The Tangs' accumulated wealth made them among the most extravagant in Xijiang Province, second only to the Prince of Qinghe's household.

Yet that proud Tang scholar would likely face hardship in his later years. In contrast, Zhou Qing was modest and prudent—qualities that would ensure his safety and longevity. As a Daoist, Zhang admired such traits.

Still, the Tang scholar's flamboyant life would undoubtedly appear more dazzling than Zhou Qing's quiet existence. From what Zhang had heard, Zhou lived simply and unassumingly, embodying the Daoist ideal of selflessness and anonymity.

In Jiangzhou City, people rarely spoke of this young scholar anymore—he was too reclusive, offering no dramatic stories worth retelling. The public preferred tales of soaring highs and crushing lows, thrilling and heart-stirring. Zhou Qing was clearly not that type.

Zhang then asked Xiao Ruowang for his impressions of Zhou Qing. Xiao recounted everything truthfully, including Fushan's creation of the Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm by synthesizing the Book of Changes.

After pondering, Zhang said, "Fushan realized things too late. But if this palm technique is passed down and combined with Taiyue's True Form Scripture, Qingfu Temple might produce a breakthrough to the Innate Realm in the next generation."

Xiao sighed, "Master, how difficult is it to reach the Innate Realm?"

A rare bitterness flashed across Zhang's face. "For some, it's as easy as eating or drinking. For others, no amount of struggle will ever suffice."

"Are there truly such people?"

"Yes, but they're one in a million. Neither you nor I are among them. You're young—your chances are better than mine. But in these times, opportunity alone may not be enough."

"Indeed. On my journey here, I saw many starving corpses. I distributed all my silver but still couldn't save many." Xiao came from an upright noble family. Though he couldn't help looking down on commoners, he naturally pitied the poor. Beyond cultivation, he spent little on himself, often giving anonymously.

To Zhang, Xiao's temperament made him the ideal successor—humble, compassionate, hardworking, though sometimes too accommodating. But perfection was impossible, and Zhang was satisfied.

Yet with turbulent times ahead, Zhang couldn't predict whether Xiao could lead the Taihe Sect forward. He could only manage the present, not foresee the future.

"Rest first, then deliver the Heart-Mending Pill to the Prince of Qinghe's residence. As for the explanation..." Zhang paused. "Mention that Tiannan's new top scholar Zhou Qing contributed significantly, but no details are necessary."

"Yes."

Given the relationship between Taihe Sect and the Prince, there was no need to claim full credit. In the martial world, skill and influence mattered less than making more friends than enemies. Qingfu Temple's current decline was temporary—with a young scholar's support, its revival was inevitable.

Once the Prince learned of Zhou's contribution, any future reciprocation would naturally convey Taihe Sect's goodwill. No further words would be needed.

"Excellent! Mingyue is recovering!" The Prince of Qinghe rejoiced as his beloved daughter's condition improved after taking the pill, soon able to eat porridge. His long anxiety finally eased.

Seizing the moment, Xiao mentioned Zhou Qing's assistance. The Prince was deeply grateful but said, "Were he an ordinary man, I'd thank him personally. But as Tiannan's top scholar, it would be inappropriate."

For a feudal prince to actively befriend a scholar from another province would raise suspicions. Yet how could he not repay his daughter's savior?

After pacing, the Prince decided, "I have a handwritten scroll by Master Jingyang—a priceless unique copy. Deliver it to him as a token of my gratitude. Discretion is key; let Scholar Zhou know it's from me."

---

Ensuring Chen Hu was thoroughly dead, Zhou Qing retrieved his crossbow bolt. When the night watch arrived at the sound of the tiger's roar, they found only their leader's corpse, unaware Zhou had already strolled casually out of the Strong Tiger Gang under night's cover.

Looking back at the commotion within, Zhou felt the exhilaration of a chivalrous hero from the martial world stories of his past life. Truly, scholars disrupted order with words, warriors with force—he did both.

Yet who would know?

Zhou merged with the night, leaving no trace.

---

"Ten steps, one slain; a thousand miles, no traces left.
Deed done, robes brushed; name and form concealed."

By lamplight, Zhou penned these lines of "The Swordsman," his calligraphy enriched by the vigor of his spirit. "What a damned world," he muttered before washing up and sleeping soundly.

At dawn, as Zhou practiced his Five Animals Exercises, the rooster Moyang crowed—a visitor approached.

"Daoist Xiao, what brings you here?" Zhou opened the gate. His exercises, influenced by the Health Sutra, had become extraordinarily challenging. Mastery of four animal forms (excluding the ape) granted him longevity, but this wasn't the sutra's limit—Zhou demanded boundless potential.

Six knocks sounded—Butcher Hu's signature. After greetings, Hu explained the ongoing clashes between his Black Tiger Gang and the Strong Tiger Gang. Though they'd mapped the enemy's operations, eliminating them was impossible due to their backing from Golden Light Temple.

"Understood. I kept them around for your gang's training. Now that you're ready, they're unnecessary."

"How shall we proceed?"

"Leave it to me." Zhou's calm assurance relieved Hu, who departed to prepare follow-up plans without question—absolute trust in Zhou's capability being key to his rise.

That night, during the Hour of the Ox (1-3 AM), Zhou struck. Finding Chen Hu awake was unexpected, but a tiger's roar-enhanced "Soul-Strike" ensured swift silence. A crossbow bolt to the chest and a sword through the throat left no room for resistance.

As the gang discovered their leader's corpse at dawn, Zhou was already gone, savoring the satisfaction of righteous vengeance. The martial world's romantic ideal—acting unseen, leaving no trace—was now his reality.

Back home, he wrote:

"Ten steps, one slain; a thousand miles, no traces left..."

The damned world demanded such measures. After washing away the night's deeds, Zhou slept peacefully, ready for another day's cultivation at dawn.
