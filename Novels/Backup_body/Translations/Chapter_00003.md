# Chapter 3: Proper Cultivation! A Disgrace to Scholars! Imaginary Friends! Words Contrary to Deeds!

"Are there really detailed methods?"

Li Zhengjing felt a surge of excitement and immediately looked further.

First, his internal organs were currently injured, and he needed to heal the damage to his five viscera and six bowels within three days!

Based on his current cultivation level, the severity of his injuries, and his immediate surroundings and situation, the following treatment methods were derived:

1. Find someone who has attained the Dao and use their spiritual power to cleanse and refine his body, undergoing a complete transformation. His internal injuries would be healed immediately!

2. Find a woman who has reached the "True Qi" realm and engage in dual cultivation with her. Borrowing her True Qi to enter his body and nourish his organs, after three days and nights of treatment, he would recover completely!

3. Find any spiritual item beneficial to the internal organs and consume it. Recovery could be instantaneous or take up to three days!

"..."

Li Zhengjing's expression was indifferent, his face devoid of emotion, his heart ashen.

Which of these three methods for healing his internal injuries could he, Li Zhengjing, possibly achieve?

Those who had attained the Dao were transcendent beings, practically immortals, already standing above the mortal world. Even worldly imperial power meant nothing to them. How could an outer sect disciple like him possibly request their help?

Within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, such immortal figures could be counted on one hand. In the Ancient Moon Peak where he currently resided, only the elusive peak master, who spent most of his time in seclusion, had reached such a realm!

If he were to seek out the Ancient Moon Peak master, he might as well look for his old acquaintance, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, and die more straightforwardly!

As for the second option...

"Find a woman who has 'opened all hundred acupoints and can externalize True Qi'?"

Li Zhengjing frowned deeply. When he saw the words "three days and nights," he immediately waved his sleeve in disdain, thinking, "I am a proper cultivator! How could I resort to such unorthodox methods? It's a disgrace to scholars!"

Just as he was thinking this, a knock came from outside his courtyard, accompanied by a clear voice.

"Senior Brother Zhengjing, this junior has brought the medicine cauldrons."

"Coming."

Li Zhengjing stored the cauldrons from which he had removed the low-grade spirit stones and went to open the courtyard gate.

The refined young man outside was none other than the fake medicine peddler, who smiled and handed over a cloth bag.

"Ten medicine cauldrons. Please count them, senior brother."

"Come in."

Li Zhengjing took the bag, opened it, and counted the contents before nodding. "I'll get the silver for you..."

As he spoke, a thought occurred to him. Remembering that this fake peddler also dealt in all sorts of rumors, he hesitated.

"Senior brother has a friend who wants to ask... in the brothels of the dark alleys in the towns below the mountain, are there any women who have reached the True Qi realm making a living?"

"What did you say?"

The fake peddler looked up in shock, his expression utterly bewildered.

"Don't misunderstand! Senior brother is a proper gentleman!"

Li Zhengjing's expression turned solemn as he said seriously, "It's just that my friend is kind-hearted and has nothing but silver to his name... If there are any women who have reached the True Qi realm but are still struggling to make ends meet, he is willing to offer assistance out of benevolence!"

"Senior brother, what nonsense are you spouting?"

The fake peddler coughed and said, "Those at the True Qi realm are grandmaster-level figures. How could they lack worldly wealth and stoop to such lowly trades?"

The True Qi realm was the third level of cultivation!

Within the immortal sect, those who reached it before the age of sixty became inner sect disciples!

Even if they were past their prime, they were still qualified to serve as inner sect elders!

In the mortal world, such individuals were grandmasters of their respective schools, capable of founding sects and dominating the martial world!

Even in the imperial army, such figures could "take the head of a general from amidst ten thousand soldiers" and were easily granted titles of nobility!

"Ahem... I know it's unlikely for such an absurd situation to exist. It's just that a friend asked me to inquire, so I thought I'd ask on his behalf."

Li Zhengjing coughed into his fist and said, "Wait a moment. I'll get the silver..."

He hurried back into the courtyard, opened his pouch, counted out five hundred taels of silver, and handed them to the fake peddler.

"I heard that since senior brother joined the sect, you've been suppressed by Elder Chen Youyu. Most outer sect disciples fear being implicated and avoid befriending you, so..." The fake peddler took the silver with a strange expression and whispered, "The 'friend' you mentioned earlier is actually you, isn't it?"

"Nonsense!" Li Zhengjing angrily waved his sleeve. "I am a proper disciple of the immortal sect! How could I possibly visit such depraved places as dark alley brothels?"

"The righteous immortal sect is a place of purity. Why do you think those places are called 'dark alleys'?" The fake peddler stepped closer and whispered, "Because they can only exist in the shadows, unseen by light. If you were truly a proper disciple of the immortal sect, even after three years, you wouldn't know of such places, let alone after just half a year..."

"Are you here to do business or not?" Li Zhengjing flushed with anger. "You talk too much! Get lost!"

After shooing away the fake peddler, Li Zhengjing hastily closed the gate and began placing the low-grade spirit stones from the cauldrons into his mouth, one by one.

In his mind, the contents of the golden page continued to reveal themselves.

Under the "Fortune" section, beneath the third line regarding healing his internal injuries, new text appeared:

"Based on current cultivation level, injuries, environment, and situation, the following items are listed: Five Elements Creation Tree, Mystic Wood Emperor Ginseng, Myriad Dao Origin True Pill, Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill, Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed, Creation Five Mystic Pill."

"Obtaining and consuming any one of these will cure the ailment!"

Li Zhengjing's brows furrowed into a deep "川" shape as he muttered, "Every single one of these things, as far as I know, is a supreme treasure of the immortal sect..."

He had never heard of the Myriad Dao Origin True Pill, but the Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill was well-known.

It was personally refined by the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Alchemy Pavilion master. Last year, the sect's top inner disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, had slain seventy-two great demons during his travels and was rewarded with just one Life-Death Pill!

As for the Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed, it was one of the heirloom treasures passed down by successive generations of sect masters and was currently in the hands of the Feather Transformation Sect Master!

The Mystic Wood Emperor Ginseng had been obtained by the previous sect master from the southern wilderness. The entire sect possessed only one, planted in the forbidden rear mountain, guarded and nurtured day and night by the Supreme Elder!

The Creation Five Mystic Pill was equally precious, capable of enhancing the cultivation of even those who had transcended mortality and attained immortality!

However, the Five Elements Creation Tree was even more valuable than the Creation Five Mystic Pill because its fruit was the primary ingredient for refining the latter!

Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples. As far as he knew, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect possessed only two Five Elements Creation Trees—one in the forbidden rear mountain and the other atop the spiritual vein at the front of the mountain!

"The Five Elements Creation Tree follows the natural order, its internal five elements cycling and transforming every six years!"

"After five cycles, the power of the five elements coalesces into five branches, bearing fruit. Harvesting these yields the main ingredient for the Creation Five Mystic Pill!"

"The Creation Five Mystic Pill is a supreme spiritual pill of this world, and the Five Elements Creation Tree, as its primary ingredient, is guarded day and night by the sect's higher-ups. I've heard the guards rotate only once every six years!"

"All these are immortal treasures. How could I possibly obtain them? It seems I can only wait for death?"

Feeling hopeless, Li Zhengjing looked up at the sky and sighed, then listlessly popped the last of the low-grade spirit stones into his mouth.

But at that moment, new text appeared on the golden page:

Method to Alter Fate:

Starting tonight, during the second watch (9-11 PM), take a jug of strong liquor and hang it under the pavilion to the left of the mountain gate. Leave immediately and do not linger!

Repeat the same on the second night!

On the third night, during the second watch, place twelve jugs of strong liquor and immediately retreat a thousand steps away.

After two quarters of an hour, return to the pavilion with a sack to obtain a Five Elements Creation Tree!

Cut five branches, grind them into powder, mix with water, and consume. The internal injuries will heal, and the remaining medicinal effects will continue to benefit the five viscera and six bowels, greatly aiding cultivation at the "Internal Qi" level and doubling results with half the effort!

Note: The liquor must be unsealed and preferably soaked with poisonous insects for best results!

"What the hell?"

Li Zhengjing was stunned for a long moment, thinking to himself, "Just leave liquor at the pavilion, and on the third night, I'll get a Five Elements Creation Tree?"

It sounded utterly absurd, but the method came from the golden page, leaving him no choice but to try!

Given his current predicament, this seemed to be his only lifeline.

"Could it be that by leaving liquor at the pavilion, some heavy-drinking sect elder will take the bait, see my youthful talent and handsome appearance, notice my internal injuries, and, moved by my gift of liquor, leave a Five Elements Creation Tree at the pavilion to heal me?"

"What kind of cliché plot is this? Trading a Five Elements Creation Tree for liquor? Unless that elder's head was kicked by a donkey!"

Li Zhengjing looked up and murmured, "It's late..."

Hoping against hope that such a donkey-kicked elder might exist, he turned back to his room, rummaged through his belongings, and pulled out three jugs of strong liquor.

The jugs were labeled with red paper reading: "For commemorating a thousand taels spent—Dark Alley Brothel."

As he picked up a jug to leave, he remembered the final note on the golden page and turned back to open one of the medicine cauldrons.

The cauldrons delivered by the fake peddler were empty, but the three he had seized earlier still contained poisonous insects—deadly ones at that!

Once bitten, twice shy. He wrapped his hand in three layers of cloth before retrieving a venomous spider and dropping it into the jug, then sealed it tightly.

Carrying the liquor, he locked his door and ventured out into the night.

---

Meanwhile, in Chen Youyu's courtyard.

The brazier flickered with flames.

Chen Youyu held the "Viscera-Nourishing Internal Energy" manual, tearing out page after page and tossing them into the fire.

"Yuan Zhengfeng humiliated me back then. Now that he's in the underworld, did he ever imagine that the youth who entered the sect with his token would be relentlessly suppressed by me, Chen Youyu, with no hope of rising?"

Remembering past grievances, Chen Youyu couldn't suppress his anger. Suddenly, he channeled his Internal Qi and struck out with his palm.

The lush tree beside him trembled violently.

The bark peeled away, revealing the trunk beneath—now frozen solid, glistening like crystal in the firelight.

"You've mastered the 'Heart-Freezing Chill Art' to perfection."

A calm, indifferent voice came from outside the courtyard.

Chen Youyu started and turned to look.

Night had fallen. Under the shade of the trees outside the courtyard, a figure emerged from the shadows.

The newcomer was slender, around forty years old, with a pale, weary face and an unmistakable air of arrogance in his expression.

A silver token hung at his waist, illuminated by the firelight, clearly engraved with two characters: "Chen Yang."

This was the token of an inner sect disciple!

Within the immortal sect, inner sect disciples held the same status as outer sect elders.

In truth, though both were at the "Internal Qi" level, outer sect elders were all over sixty, while inner sect disciples were younger with brighter futures. Thus, within the sect, inner sect disciples were generally held in higher regard.

And this Chen Yang was even more esteemed than the average inner sect disciple—he was the most favored junior of Grand Elder Chen Zhu!

Seeing the visitor, Chen Youyu hurried forward to greet him.

"Nephew Chen Yang, what brings you here?"

"Grand Elder Chen Zhu has entered seclusion to cultivate the 'Heavenly Flame Immortal Incineration Art.' Before secluding himself, he heard that you've been deliberately suppressing that youth who entered the sect with Yuan Zhengfeng's token. He sent me to remind you: Yuan Zhengfeng deserved his fate, but that youth is innocent. Don't break the sect's rules in your actions."

With that, Chen Yang casually tossed over a pill bottle. "A reward from the Grand Elder."

Chen Youyu accepted the pills, overjoyed. Since he had received a reward today, it meant his suppression of Li Zhengjing had the Grand Elder's tacit approval!

These higher-ups loved this hypocritical game—disgustingly subtle!

"To the Grand Elder, that youth is nothing but an ant. He hasn't spared him a single thought since his entry into the sect."

Chen Yang said calmly, "But as someone who serves at the Grand Elder's side, I don't want him to emerge from seclusion and see anyone related to Yuan Zhengfeng in the inner sect, souring his mood."

He took a step forward and said lightly, "The inner sect assessment is in seven days."

Patting Chen Youyu's shoulder, he added, "Uncle, within seven days, put him to rest."

His gaze then fell on the half-burned manual in Chen Youyu's hand, its text clearly visible in the firelight.

"'Viscera-Nourishing Internal Energy'?"

Chen Yang glanced at it and suddenly frowned. "Why are there errors on this page?"

Chen Youyu's expression turned odd as he looked up, cursing inwardly: "I gathered people to alter this manual on your orders, and now you're asking me this? What a hypocritical, two-faced bastard!"
