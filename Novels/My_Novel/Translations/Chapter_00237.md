Chapter 237: A Dead End? Turning the Tide!

Li Quan’s face turned ashen, his whole body trembling. His pouncing attack halted, he cried out in despair, "Oh no, I was too reckless! My life is over!" His heart sank into darkness, his hands and feet grew cold, and he knew he could not survive. Yet, to accept his fate so easily was unbearable. With nothing left to lose, he staked his life on the "Thousand-Jun Drop" technique.

A dark light burst from his body as he plummeted violently downward, smashing into the ground. The flowers and grass within a thirty-meter radius were uprooted and crushed into dust, turning to fine powder. His legs sank deep into the earth, burying him up to his knees.

"Fool, you've fallen for my trick!" Su Qiuwu cursed.

Seeing that his body was unharmed, Li Quan realized he had been deceived and was furious. Hearing Su Qiuwu call him a fool made him lash out, "Su Qiuwu, if you have the guts, use your 'Three Steps of Drifting' and chase him yourself!"

Li Xian stepped through the air again. He was now over fifteen meters high; he had used two of the seven steps. However, the seven vital points in his body—the Yellow Court, the Mud Pill, the膻中 (Shanzhong), the Life Gate, the Spinal Ridge, the Hundred Convergences, and the Tailbone—were the keys to gathering the "Lightness Momentum" for the Seven-Step Treading technique.

It was like a boat on a lake; if the inside is hollow and gathers the lightness momentum, it can float on the water. If water floods in, it sinks immediately. So-called "Lightness Skill" works on the same principle. The body acts as the boat, and the surroundings are the "water." The vital points in the body are where the "Lightness Momentum" resides. Every time Li Xian broke through a vital point, he could tread on air and leap higher, but his lightness momentum was also depleted.

It was like cruising on a lake and then chopping the boat to make oars. Once the boat is punctured and filled with water, it naturally sinks into the lake.

The Tailbone and Hundred Convergences had already been broken.

Li Xian focused his spirit and stepped again. The vital point at the Spinal Ridge broke, and he treaded on air, reaching a height of twenty-one meters. To rise so high without any support, his strength was already commendable.

Su Qiuwu said, "What kind of trick is this kid playing? Does he think he can fly over the cliff? With this kind of ascent, he will eventually fall. Isn't this effort wasted?"

He was highly suspicious but then thought, "Well, he has no way to escape left or right. In his death throes, it's not strange for him to use any desperate move." He calmed himself down.

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "Hehe, who cares about him?" With a flick of his long sword, he stabbed a disciple of the Taixin Sect to death. With a slight shake of his wrist, he silently practiced the "Yellow Sand Heart Sutra," sucking the disciple dry until he became a withered corpse. With a flick of his wrist, he shot the withered corpse out.

Li Quan threw a punch. Zhao Zhiyuan parried with his sword and roared, "What are you doing!" Li Quan said, "Why did you kill a disciple of my sect!"

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "He was the closest just now. I didn't notice which sect he was from. I just killed him."

Li Quan snorted coldly, unable to pursue the matter further. The withered corpse flew toward Li Xian with terrifying speed and contained an extremely powerful internal energy.

Wen Caishang said, "Use the 'Sun and Moon Exchange' move." The first layer of the Setting Sun and Fading Blood Sword had a move called "Sun and Moon Exchange," which belonged to both the Yin and Yang swords.

The sword move was gentle, deeply understanding the principle of the intersection of Yin and Yang.

Li Xian followed her instructions and stabbed at the withered corpse. The sword tip spiraled slowly, evolving to the extreme. His surroundings would darken and then brighten in an instant. Finally, with a kick, he sent the corpse flying.

Zhao Zhiyuan frowned, deeply impressed. The withered corpse contained an extremely powerful internal energy. If Li Xian had劈开 (split it open), the internal energy would have exploded immediately, and the "bones" of the corpse would have turned into countless sharp spikes, piercing his body.

This move was called "Sacrificing Oneself to Seek Benevolence," an extremely sinister technique of the Yellow Sand Sect. It was often used upon first meeting to test the opponent and quickly establish dominance.

Li Xian's "Sun and Moon Exchange," enveloped in gentle energy, stabilized the internal energy within the corpse, then unraveled it like pulling silk from a cocoon. Through a combination of attacks and消解 (dissipation), he neutralized the killing intent and avoided the subsequent trap. This showed Wen Caishang's precise knowledge of martial arts, quick judgment, strong skill, and excellent countermeasures.

Zhao Zhiyuan immediately felt wary: "This woman is terrifying. My move is usually unstoppable, and few can see its trick. Yet, despite her weakness and inability to move her body, she casually pointed it out with words. If I were to fight her, I would have no chance of winning."

Li Xian used this opportunity to break through the Life Gate, Shanzhong, and Mud Pill points one after another. His figure was now nearly thirty-three meters high, breaking through the colorful mist.

Everyone saw his momentum was about to stop and didn't know what trick he was playing. Wen Caishang was also full of confusion.

Li Xian turned his body upside down, his head toward the ground and feet toward the sky. He put away his sword, took his bow and arrows. He nocked two arrows, aiming at Su Qiuwu and Zhao Zhiyuan. But just as the arrows were about to leave the string, their direction changed completely, shooting instead toward the distant cliff.

"What is this..." Su Qiuwu was stunned, his heart tightening. He shouted, "Stop him!"

Li Xian's lips curled into a smile. He pulled the bowstring taut and shot the two arrows. The arrows were filled with immense intent, flying together with a force that seemed to pierce the heavens. At the tail of the arrows were connected extremely fine silken threads. Li Xian, being upside down, naturally hung in that position. He used the tip of his foot to hook the silk in the middle.

Using the "Mystery of the Light Word," his entire body flew out with the arrows, galloping freely. Wen Caishang was greatly surprised: "So that was the plan, to fly with the arrow. What excellent skill! What a clever mind! What a great strategy!"

Ordinary people, even with a similar idea, would find it extremely difficult to replicate. An arrow leaves the string with incredible speed. An ordinary martial artist would find it hard to catch up. Even if they did, the moment they touched the arrow, the arrow's momentum would be damaged, and its speed would immediately decrease. How could it carry a person out? Even if it did, it would only be for a few meters.

But Li Xian had meticulously planned it. When shooting the arrow, he was already upside down. The actions of shooting with his hands and hooking the silk with his toes were all carefully calculated.

Moreover, his archery was exquisite to the extreme, reaching the pinnacle! The more dangerous the situation, the more spirited he became. Li Xian's brow was filled with confidence. Though he didn't speak, his expression said: Let heroes rise one after another, what can they do to me?

The arrows he shot were powerful, and their intent was profound.

He then used the "Mystery of the Light Word," making his body light.

But even so, with all these arrangements, after flying a few dozen meters, the arrows' speed was significantly reduced because they were supporting two people. Escaping with two arrows was still a pipe dream.

Wen Caishang had already felt it was brilliant, but now, unable to escape, she thought: "It's done. He has done his best. In such a situation, how can he reverse it alone?" A hint of sadness crossed her heart.

Su Qiuwu, filled with fear, seeing the接连 (continuous) surprises, dared not sit and wait for death. He leaped into the air, treading several times, wanting to rush over and kill. Li Xian laughed and said, "Old fool, you've finally come to die."

Su Qiuwu cursed, "Hmph, you are not qualified to speak to me!" He held his hands behind his back, treading on the tips of his feet, looking extremely ethereal. This was the "Three Steps of Drifting," extremely strong in evasion, but slightly weaker in ascent.

But as a third-level expert, his body was like a small world, capable of evolving martial arts. He was not someone Li Xian could compare to. Seeing him approach rapidly, there was no way to dodge. Li Xian remained calm, put away his bow, drew his sword, and unleashed the "Yang Origin Sword Qi" in an instant. Scorching Yang fire rushed forward.

Su Qiuwu swerved his body to avoid it, a cold smile forming on his lips. Suddenly, he felt the scorching heat wave growing more and more intense. When he turned back, he saw a shocking scene.

The Yang Origin Sword Qi had struck the colorful mist. The mist was formed by "pollen," densely packed and scattered like countless fine particles. Because they were so tiny, they ignited upon contact with fire. The moment a spark appeared, it was like a prairie fire, exploding with infinite killing power in an instant.

A massive explosion occurred.

The Yang Origin Sword Qi's fire was fierce.

With a "rumble," the power was immense. Ordinary disciples of the Yellow Sand Sect, Sword Rain Pavilion, and Taixin Sect were instantly burned to death or severely injured. The composed and confident Su Qiuwu, Zhao Zhiyuan, Xi Kairen, and others, caught in the blast, were blown away. Their hair, skin, and clothes were instantly destroyed.

Su Qiuwu had been focusing on dealing with Wen Caishang and noticed too late. He was immediately caught in the blast, blown away, and smashed into a huge boulder, getting deeply embedded. His clothes caught fire.

Li Xian practiced the sword technique, Sheng Yang Hua. The Yang Origin Sword Qi was scorching, with waves of heat.

In an instant, the situation changed completely. Li Xian used the propulsive force and the momentum of the arrows to fly high up. The two long arrows lodged in the middle of the cliff, and Li Xian hung upside down from it.

This place was dozens of meters from the ground and dozens of meters from the top, stuck in the middle. Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes were filled with surprise and brilliance. She suddenly understood: "So that's how it is... Yesterday, he asked me about the pollen, preparing for this. He used the flammable nature of the pollen mist to lure them in, then ignited it all at once. The two of us could then use the explosive force and the arrow's momentum to create distance. This boy's schemes are deep and his plans are far-reaching. That would be normal, but... his thinking is wild and unconstrained. Every strategy is breathtaking and surprising... How rare."

"Li Xian... you not only fooled me terribly, but you also played the others for fools."

Putting herself in his shoes, Wen Caishang had felt hopeless. But Li Xian had blazed a new trail and found a path to life. For a moment, she felt great admiration, with a hint of hidden adoration.

She saw the sea of flowers turn into a sea of fire, burning fiercely. Wailing and screaming filled the air, a scene of chaos. Zhao Zhiyuan, Su Qiuwu, and the others were all injured, their bodies blackened, and they looked utterly wretched.

Su Qiuwu, furious with shame, looked into the distance. Seeing Li Xian hanging upside down on the cliff, stuck in the middle, he roared, "Chase him! There's still a chance!"

Li Xian laughed aloud and said, "Little old man, is my sea of flowers beautiful?" Su Qiuwu had considered himself infallible and highly intelligent. He looked down on Li Xian, but the first great loss he suffered was delivered by Li Xian.

Su Qiuwu said, "You little thief, you won't live long!"

Li Xian said coldly, "Is that so?" With his foot hooked on the silk, hanging upside down on the cliff, his bow was drawn like a full moon. Wen Caishang's eyes twinkled and said, "Shoot the Qihu point!"

Li Xian's eyes narrowed slightly, his dual pupils showing faintly as he stared at his opponents. He released the string, and the Huang Dao Bow unleashed its killing intent. The arrow was附着 (attached) with a yellow light. Su Qiuwu raised his hand to grab it, feeling the sharp arrow intent, and was greatly shocked.

Wen Caishang said, "Lingxu point, Tianquan point, Shimen point..." Li Xian shot as instructed, each arrow precise, filled with infinite intent.

Su Qiuwu dealt with several arrows, initially at ease, but grew colder as he接招 (received them). Gradually, he felt a "sword intent" within the arrows!

Wen Caishang冷笑 (sneered): "Your skill is lacking, how embarrassing. Shoot his Huagai point."

This arrow came, and all of Su Qiuwu's martial arts had nowhere to be施展 (displayed). He felt as if someone had picked apart all his moves with a single sword. The defeat was certain. He desperately called for help: "Come and help me!"

Qian Jinghao, holding a large whip, stepped forward to assist. Wen Caishang said, "Useless people are useless, no matter how many there are."

Wen Caishang named the acupoints, and Li Xian shot with precision. The two had a natural tacit understanding, their minds in sync. The more they fought, the more indescribable joy they felt. Wen Caishang had been plagued by misfortune, suffering great setbacks and feeling immense frustration. Now, she vented all her憋闷 (suppressed feelings), feeling incredibly exhilarated.

Su Qiuwu, Qian Jinghao, Li Quan, Zhao Zhiyuan, and the others, having suffered a great loss and with the distance growing, felt more and more alarmed as they fought. They first felt Wen Caishang's immense martial dao. No matter how fast the arrows were, there was always a time interval between the arrow leaving the string and reaching its target.

But the group had the错觉 (illusion) of trading blows with a master swordsman. This showed... Wen Caishang's martial dao was far superior to theirs. She could predict their moves several steps ahead, or even more. The gap was immense!

They also felt the strength of Li Xian's archery. The arrows were endless, incredibly precise, and their intent was unparalleled. Every arrow was flawless, astonishing the world.

Finally... they marveled at the two's默契 (tacit understanding). After a few exchanges, the arrow fire suddenly stopped. The five people gathered together, none daring to separate.

If they were to be caught in the open, they would surely be shot to death.

After a moment, more arrows came. The five people united to deal with them, back to back, truly wretched. The wailing from the sea of fire was endless. The flames were fierce, and black smoke rose. Most of the disciples they had brought were already dead.

And there were still hidden arrows shooting at them.

Hard to deal with! Too hard to deal with!

Terrifying! Too terrifying
