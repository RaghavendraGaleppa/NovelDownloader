# Chapter 288: Mountain Lord Temple, The Desire for Somersault Cloud Reaches Its Peak

The winter rain fell in a steady drizzle.

On the desolate mountain, the sound of wind rustling through the leaves was incessant, the chill seeming to seep into the bone marrow with the air.

In the cold, silent temple, a group of traveling merchants burst in, complaining as they shook off the rain and checked their goods.

"It looks like we'll be delayed on the mountain tonight. This mountain path is shorter, sure, but who knew the weather would be so terrible?"

"Ah, who knew the mountain road would be so difficult to travel?"

"Will we run into any demonic beasts if we spend the night up here?"

The merchants shivered as they complained.

"Don't worry, this is the Mountain Lord Temple. The priests from the surrounding fortresses offer sacrifices here often. It's very effective."

"With the Mountain Lord's blessing, I've stayed here occasionally. It's safe."

Their middle-aged guide spoke with full confidence.

Seeing how certain he was, the merchants relaxed and started a fire to cook.

Not long after.

There was a noise at the entrance. Startled, everyone looked up to see two people walking in.

"Pardon the intrusion," the young man said, cupping his fist in a salute to the group.

"When traveling, we must help each other out," the guide said with a beaming smile.

The young man glanced thoughtfully at him, then sat down to the side with the woman wearing a light veil.

The merchants were initially curious about the two, but soon paid them no mind, eating their roasted flatbread and drinking wine as they chatted.

"Have you heard? The witch spirits in many places have been killed."

"The witch spirits of Nine Spirit Stronghold and Humao Town are all gone now."

"Who would be so audacious and heretical?"

"It wasn't a person. It was a pair—one a恶蛟 (evil flood dragon), the other a bird demon. They somehow teamed up."

"Ah?"

The young man was a bit surprised.

He was called the Peerless Flood Dragon on the demonic beasts' side.

He had been slaying demons and monsters all the way here, but his reputation seemed a bit different from what he had imagined.

The merchants glanced at him. The fire was now burning brighter, allowing them to see the young man's handsome face and gentle brow. When he smiled, he seemed bright and cheerful, perhaps a 'modest gentleman' as they say outside the Southern Frontier.

The woman beside him wore a black gauze hat, hiding her face, but she gave off an aura that kept people at a distance.

"What... what evil deeds did they do?" asked the young man, the 'evil dragon,' Li Mo.

"They killed the witch spirits, but they don't accept people's worship. Who will the people believe in now?" one of the merchants stated as if it were obvious.

Li Mo: "..."

He couldn't help but recall.

He and Ying Bing had slain a fat-headed fish disaster beast. That fish deliberately stirred up trouble in the river, capsizing boats.

Only after receiving sacrifices would it calm down slightly.

Just by doing a little less evil, it could openly enjoy incense and offerings in the temple.

A small sacrifice once a month, a grand sacrifice once a year.

Small ones involved cattle and sheep, large ones involved young boys and girls.

"If you don't worship the witch spirits, then you won't need offerings," Li Mo said.

"That won't do," a merchant said, looking at Li Mo as if he were an alien, somewhat angry. "It has always been this way."

"Exactly. A few cattle and sheep, two children, in exchange for everyone's safety. It's a very good deal."

"For example, this Mountain Lord. With the Mountain Lord's protection, the wild beasts outside don't dare to come in. That's why we can sit here and chat."

"And what if the ones offered up... were you?" Li Mo said softly all of a sudden.

Unbeknownst to them, the woman in the hat beside him had already disappeared.

The bonfire flickered and swayed violently. A gust of cold wind blew into the Mountain Lord Temple, making the air feel even colder.

It was as if something was awakening...

Everyone was terrified. They scrambled to run out, but they had only just reached the entrance.

*Bang—*

A huge, dark shadow crashed to the ground.

It was a bluish-purple, mottled tiger head, ferocious and enormous. It was big enough to swallow an adult whole, terrifying beyond belief.

---

Yet it was dead. Its blood was frozen solid, leaving only the stench of blood to fill the air.

At some point, the rain had stopped.

Moonlight streamed down.

Before the headless tiger corpse, a少女 (maiden) draped in moonlight slowly sheathed her sword. The jade-green wings on her back slowly faded away.

The night wind lifted her black veil, accidentally revealing a corner of her breathtaking face.

"That Mountain Lord was pretty tough," Li Mo said with a light laugh, kicking the huge tiger head out the door. "He was much better than that fat-headed fish and that crow."

The merchants didn't dare make a sound for a long time. The very subject they had just been discussing had been sitting right beside them from the start.

"Mountain Lord!" the guide suddenly let out a shrill cry and collapsed, stiff, to the ground.

The merchants scattered and fled, as if they wished their parents had given them two more legs.

"You haven't taken your goods?" Li Mo shouted after them.

But this sounded like a demon's death curse to them, making them run even faster.

"唉 (Sigh)."

Little Li shook his head and kicked the long-dead tiger's servant out as well.

Perhaps it was because of Shang Qinqing.

They hadn't encountered any powerful disaster beasts on their journey so far, mostly just the so-called 'witch spirits' along the way.

But they had traveled less than a third of the way so far.

They had no idea what other changes might lie ahead.

He added a few logs to the fire, and the temple grew quiet.

"Li Mo."

Ying Bing took off her hat and put it away in the big-headed doll.

When she spoke his name, the tone in her voice was completely at odds with the sword intent she had just used to slay the Mountain Lord.

"I'm here," Li Mo said, sitting beside her and naturally taking her small hand.

"Take this," Ying Bing said, taking out the Demon-Slaying Gourd and handing it to Li Mo. She then held the Moon Essence Crystal in her left hand.

The Demon-Slaying Gourd was full. It could be used to water the Moon Essence Crystal. Although it wasn't as powerful as the Power of All Living Things, it was still a holy item for improving one's soul.

"Let's begin."

"Okay."

Li Mo frowned.

As everyone knows, opening the gourd requires two hands.

But he only had two hands, and one of them was holding his ice cube.

"..."

Ying Bing seemed to understand the young man's dilemma. She was about to let go of his hand for a moment, pursing her lips.

Then she saw the young man bite open the gourd's lid with a rather heroic motion.

"If we hold hands with both, will the effect of our dual cultivation be better?" Li Mo asked after pouring the essence into the crystal.

Ying Bing raised her slender eyebrows slightly. "In that case, would holding hands with feet work just as well?"

Li Mo: !

His ice cube had learned to extrapolate? She was starting to have a bit of his genius!

"I think we can try that. We might have discovered a new way to use the *Phoenix's Cry in the Sky Marsh*."

"But I have to keep watch. You'll have to practice on your own," Ying Bing said, a hint of amusement in her eyes as she gently poked his forehead with her index finger and stood up.

"Oh," Little Li said, his hand grasping at empty air.

At this moment, Little Li's desire for Somersault Cloud reached its peak.

Not to mention ten thousand eight thousand miles, but he should be able to get back to Nanguan City in one somersault, right?

Now they still had to take turns keeping watch, and they couldn't even dual cultivate.

He was still missing three of the Seventy-Two Transformations.

Once he completes these three, he can touch the next great ability...
