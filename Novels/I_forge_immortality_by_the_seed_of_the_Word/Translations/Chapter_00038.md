# Chapter 38: Establishing a Talisman Sales Channel  

At Luodu Island's Spirit Crane Garden, a clear crane cry pierced the air as Zhang Jing soared into the sky atop a spirit crane, skillfully navigating toward the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

After half an hour of crossing the vast Longze Lake, Zhang Jing arrived before the grand pavilion. He settled his crane among a group of others nearby before stepping inside.  

Passing through the familiar giant cyan-gold doors, a dazzling light momentarily blinded him. When his vision cleared, he found himself standing on the same seemingly endless street he remembered—bustling with crowds and lined with stalls selling high-grade materials and cultivation resources. Only a handful of these could be purchased with spirit stones.  

"Should I inquire about setting up a stall here or sell my talismans directly to the Thousand Techniques Pavilion?" Zhang Jing hesitated briefly before decisively entering the pavilion's talisman-selling section.  

He recalled that during his last visit, a senior sister had mentioned they only accepted superior-quality talismans. Since all the talismans he carried met that standard, they should qualify.  

Compared to selling to individual senior brothers and sisters, Zhang Jing preferred dealing with the Thousand Techniques Pavilion—provided their offer was fair and not unreasonably low. It was far more convenient. Given the pavilion's vast supply network catering to countless cultivators across the sect, his modest stock would be effortlessly absorbed. He just needed to be mindful not to sell an excessive quantity at once.  

Inside, Ruan Xing'er was lazily propped against the counter, chin resting on one hand as she yawned while watching disciples pass by outside.  

Suddenly, an aged voice spoke behind her, "Junior Sister Xing'er, how many superior-quality talismans remain on display?"  

Startled, Ruan Xing'er straightened instantly without daring to look back. "Senior Brother Zhu, we currently have 220 superior-quality talismans in stock: 21 high-grade, 53 mid-grade, and 146 low-grade."  

"So few left?" Senior Brother Zhu's voice carried urgency.  

"Indeed, Senior Brother," Ruan Xing'er explained. "Outer sect disciples have been undertaking frequent missions recently, leading to high talisman consumption. Even these expensive superior-quality ones are selling quickly."  

She then turned hopefully to the fifty-year-old elder in green robes. "By the way, the inner sect seniors haven't replenished our superior talismans in quite some time. Could you inquire with them? Our current stock won't last more than a few months."  

The elder sighed. "I'd like to, but those inner sect seniors often enter secluded cultivation. How could I disturb them over mere Qi Refinement-level talismans?"  

After a long pause, he continued, "I'll try contacting our cooperating talisman masters to see if they can produce more mid- and low-grade superior talismans. As for high-grade ones... we'll have to wait until the seniors remember us."  

"Junior Sister, if customers come, try steering them toward standard-quality talismans," he instructed before departing hurriedly.  

Once he was gone, Ruan Xing'er exhaled in relief, cheeks flushed as she stuck out her tongue playfully before resuming her idle watch over the shop.  

Not long after, a familiar figure entered—the junior who had previously only browsed without buying. Her eyes lit up. Had he finally decided to make a purchase?  

She approached with a smile. "Junior Brother, back again? Looking for something specific, or here to buy talismans?"  

"Senior Sister, I'm actually here to sell some talismans. I was wondering what price you'd offer."  

"Of course! Our prices are clearly marked—" Ruan Xing'er began guiding him inside before abruptly stopping. "Wait, you're selling? As I mentioned last time, we only accept superior-quality talismans."  

She studied Zhang Jing's youthful face with skepticism.  

Meeting her gaze, Zhang Jing nodded calmly. "I'm aware of your policy."  

"You have superior-quality talismans? How many?" Hope flickered in her eyes.  

"Not many—just a few dozen low-grade ones."  

"A few dozen?!" Her mouth fell open comically wide.  

"Please wait here, Junior Brother. I'll fetch Senior Brother Zhu!"  

Soon after, Zhang Jing stepped out of the shop, staring oddly at the eighty additional merit points now recorded on his identity jade slip.  

He had cautiously sold only forty Stellar Guidance Talismans this time. To his surprise, Senior Brother Zhu hadn't haggled at all—purchasing them all at two merit points each after verifying their quality.  

Moreover, the elder had given him a communication talisman, instructing him to contact them directly for future sales. Regardless of quantity, they would collect the talismans personally at the same price.  

This unexpected development caught Zhang Jing off guard. He had assumed his talismans would need to be discounted to sell. Now it seemed superior-quality talismans might be considered valuable even within the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

The specifics didn't matter to him—this was undeniably good news.  

With that settled, Zhang Jing continued exploring the pavilion's market-like area. Compared to Longze Market, the items sold here—exclusively for sect disciples—were of significantly higher grade and quality. Most would incite frenzied competition if leaked to rogue cultivators.  

Just then, a voice called out from behind, "Junior Brother ahead, a moment please!"  

Turning, Zhang Jing saw a middle-aged man in green robes approaching swiftly.  

"Senior Brother, how may I help you?" Zhang Jing asked, puzzled. He didn't recall ever meeting this man.  

Leaning in, the man whispered, "I noticed you sold talismans at the pavilion's shop earlier. Given their standards, they must have been superior-quality. Correct?"  

"What of it?" Zhang Jing countered warily.  

The man smiled amiably. "No need for suspicion. I merely wished to ask if you have any remaining superior talismans for sale. I'm willing to pay a premium."  

Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed. Why would this man bypass the pavilion to buy from him at a higher price?  

"How many do you need, and what types?" he probed cautiously.  

The man's face brightened. "You still have some? Excellent! Ten defensive and ten offensive talismans—I'll pay forty merit points."  

"Senior Brother, this price exceeds the pavilion's rates. Why not purchase directly from them?" Zhang Jing remained composed.  

That the man was willing to overpay by five merit points made Zhang Jing deeply suspicious. There had to be an ulterior motive.
