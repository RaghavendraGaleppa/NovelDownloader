**Chapter 91: New Acquaintance**  

The monster was slain by the sword light and fell onto the reef.  

"Who's there?" Li Shiming didn't spare a glance at the monster's corpse, instead turning his gaze toward the sea.  

Though he had been engaged in battle, his senses—enhanced by IBMz15's reception capabilities—constantly monitored his surroundings. Just as he delivered the final blow to the monster, IBMz15 detected a faint trace of a cultivator's aura carried by the sea breeze, along with unusual air currents within the wind.  

Normally, wind direction shifts predictably with air currents—something IBMz15 could calculate and anticipate. The irregular airflow suggested interference, and combined with the cultivator's presence, Li Shiming was certain someone was hiding nearby.  

"Don't misunderstand—I'm Qiu Tan from Changming Island. Here's my identity jade slip." A figure emerged from the spot Li Shiming had been watching—a cultivator riding a white bird, who presented his jade slip as he spoke.  

Li Shiming remained cautious, sensing the other's mid-stage Qi Refining cultivation.  

"Is Eagle Beak Island your residence?" Qiu Tan, noting Li Shiming's tension, smiled wryly and asked a seemingly pointless question to ease the mood.  

He had been passing by when he sensed the spiritual energy fluctuations of battle and decided to investigate.  

After all, this was within the sect's territory. Who would dare attack a fellow disciple here? The penalty for such an act was certain death.  

Risking such consequences over a mere sea beast would hardly be worth it.  

As for his initial concealment—well, that was just habit. Years of experience in the cultivation world had ingrained caution in him. Detecting a fight and preparing accordingly was simply second nature.  

"Yes, I'm Li Shiming, residing on Eagle Beak Island." Through IBMz15's micro-expression analysis, Li Shiming confirmed Qiu Tan bore no ill intent and relaxed slightly before responding.  

"I recall Eagle Beak Island has spirit fields. Could you be a spirit farmer, Junior Brother Li?" Qiu Tan asked curiously, struck by the thought.  

The sword light Li Shiming had used to slay the sea beast made it hard to believe he was a spirit farmer.  

But cultivators who rented residences with spirit fields usually fell into two categories: the wealthy or spirit farmers.  

Wealthy cultivators might use the fields to grow spirit plants, irrigating them with purchased spirit water or hiring spirit farmers to manage them—luxuries only a few late-stage Qi Refining disciples or renowned subsidiary professionals could afford.  

Given Li Shiming's cultivation level, his basic sect-issued robe, and his low-grade artifact, the Flaming Sword, he clearly didn't fit either category.  

"I'm a beginner-level spirit farmer," Li Shiming admitted, recalling that Changming Island was one of the larger nearby islands—recommended to him by a senior at the Affairs Hall.  

"Have you heard of Changming Island's market, Junior Brother Li?" Qiu Tan asked with a smile upon hearing Li Shiming's profession.  

Li Shiming was taken aback. Senior Brother Zhuji had mentioned that acquiring resources within the sect required exchanging merit points. He had never heard of any markets outside the sect's nine peaks.  

Seeing his expression, Qiu Tan confirmed his suspicion—this was a newly initiated disciple.  

"The market on Changming Island is a trading hub among cultivators. The sect neither encourages nor forbids private transactions. The market operates under the backing of a Foundation Establishment elder—no merit points needed, just spirit stones to trade for what you need," Qiu Tan explained with a grin.  

"Aside from spirit rice, I don't have anything else to trade," Li Shiming admitted, puzzled by Qiu Tan's enthusiasm.  

During his novice period, he had eaten spirit rice with every meal, so he assumed it held little value within the sect. Selling it would likely require leaving sect territory.  

"You're a spirit farmer—you've probably never had to buy spirit rice yourself, have you?" Qiu Tan asked, surprised. Without waiting for an answer, he continued, "The sect's spirit rice is indeed cheap—ten jin for one merit point. But merit points aren't easy to come by. No disciple wastes them on rice. The demand for spirit rice bought with spirit stones is huge."  

"Thank you for the insight, Senior Brother Qiu!" Li Shiming bowed slightly in gratitude.  

Had Qiu Tan not told him this, he might have remained ignorant for much longer.  

"If you really want to thank me, how about selling me half of that sea boar? I haven't had sea boar meat in ages!" Qiu Tan chuckled, pointing at the beast's corpse on the reef.  

"Of course! You can have half," Li Shiming agreed without hesitation.  

Had Qiu Tan not identified the creature as edible, he would have tossed the carcass back into the sea. Sharing half of it was a small repayment for the favor.  

With a thought, Li Shiming directed the Flaming Sword toward the sea boar's body.  

"Wait!" Qiu Tan shouted urgently.  

The sword light halted just above the beast. Had Li Shiming's Sword Control Technique been less refined, the blade would have already split the boar in two.  

Qiu Tan flew over and retrieved a small knife from his storage pouch, deftly working on the carcass.  

"The hide's a bit damaged, but it's still worth ten spirit stones," he remarked while skinning the beast.  

The sword had pierced the boar's skull, and another wound marred its body, but the pelt was otherwise intact.  

Only then did Li Shiming realize sea beasts were valuable resources. His lack of knowledge had blinded him to the possibility.  

Qiu Tan swiftly divided the meat into two piles, ensuring nothing—not even the organs—went to waste.  

"This much sea boar meat would sell for fifty spirit stones on Changming Island. I'll pay you that," Qiu Tan said, storing half and tossing fifty spirit stones to Li Shiming.  

"Thank you. Without your guidance, I wouldn't have known its worth," Li Shiming said, accepting the stones gratefully.  

"I have a copy of *Records of Sea Beasts* here—worth fifty spirit stones. Interested?" Qiu Tan smiled knowingly, exuding confidence.  

Li Shiming chuckled wryly and handed the fifty stones back without protest.  

Knowledge was invaluable in the cultivation world. Spending fifty stones on a bestiary was a fair trade.  

"Let's exchange contact details. If you ever visit Changming Island, look me up—I can help you find whatever you need," Qiu Tan said, retrieving the stones and tossing over a jade slip before presenting his identity jade again.  

The identity jade served both as proof of status and a communication tool. By registering each other's jade slips, they could now contact one another remotely within a certain range.
