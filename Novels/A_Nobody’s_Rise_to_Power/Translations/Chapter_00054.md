# Chapter 54: Defeating Them One by One

The first person Yang Can sent for was the village head, Shi Jiuyue.

The basis for this was some problems Li Xiansheng had found in the accounts.

A village head was the lowest level of management in a village. His main responsibilities included collecting taxes, performing official duties, and managing household registrations. These people were usually middle landlords or rich peasants, because only they had the ability and prestige to deal with the common people at the most basic level. Furthermore, if necessary, they had the financial means to pay the taxes on behalf of the households they managed. Of course, they would later add interest and collect the money from the farmers.

When Yang Can’s men took Shi Jiuyue away, he was embracing a rather pretty young woman and getting intimate. She was a little wife recently given to him by a poor peasant who couldn't pay back the taxes Jiuyue had advanced for him the previous year. Since this piece of fat meat was already in his mouth, Shi Jiuyue wasn't in a hurry. He had planned to have a few drinks to set the mood before enjoying a passionate battle, but Yang Can's arrival interrupted his plans.

"Li Xiansheng, why did Head Yang arrest Village Head Shi? Will anything bad happen?" Xiao Tan asked coquettishly, sitting on Li Damu's lap with her arms around his neck.

"Don't worry. Since Head Yang has come all this way, do you think he'll go back empty-handed?" Li Damu said with a smile, pinching the little temptress's perky bottom. He was now "on a mission to flirt," a tragic hero who sacrificed his looks to go deep into the enemy's den for the sake of the investigation. What did he have to worry about? With this psychological burden lifted, he felt the girl in his arms smelled even better.

Xiao Tan widened her eyes. "You mean Head Yang has to find something to pin on them to give an explanation to the main house and the young mistress?"

"Exactly, you're a clever girl," Li Damu chuckled, pressing down on Xiao Tan's shoulders. The clever Xiao Tan immediately understood his meaning and gave him a flirtatious roll of her eyes.

"You mean Yang Can just wants to catch some cases to give an explanation to his superiors?" Zhang Dashao asked nervously, looking at Xiao Tan.

Xiao Tan replied, "That's right. The things on Village Head Shi aren't that serious to begin with. Li Xiansheng said Head Yang just needs to give his superiors an explanation, and that's all there is to it."

Zhang Dashao let out a breath of relief. With his worries gone, he beckoned Xiao Tan over with a smile. When Xiao Tan snuggled obediently into his arms, he whispered with a grin, "Tell me how Accountant Li bullied you."

Xiao Tan was Sang Zhi's personal maid, and Sang Zhi was Master Zhang's concubine. But from the looks of it, Xiao Tan and Zhang Dashao seemed to have a secret relationship. In that case, it was hard to say whether Miss Sang Zhi had any relationship with Zhang Dashao either. Xiao Tan knew of Zhang Dashao's peculiar癖好, so she vividly described the scene to him. Zhang Dashao was instantly aroused. He pressed Xiao Tan down and, following her description, acted it out himself. Only after satisfying his desires did he let her go.

Shi Jiuyue was just a small village head and couldn't withstand the torture from Yang Can's men. He endured for half a day. Instead of waiting for reinforcements, he received a hint: just confess, the problem isn't big. So, he spilled everything about the problems Li Damu had found in the accounts like pouring beans from a bamboo tube. Of course, he didn't say a word about things he shouldn't know or shouldn't say.

The stewardess interrogating for Yang Can got the confession and stopped making things difficult for him, but she didn't release him either. Using the excuse of "further investigation needed," she locked him in the granary. It was late spring, and many granaries were empty, making them perfect for holding people. The huge space, the oppressive environment, the lonely person...

Next, the mill manager, Wang Goudan, was invited for "tea." Don't look down on Goudan. As the small manager of the grinding workshop in Feng'an Village, he also held immense power over the common people. Processing grain meant taking a portion of it as a fee. Taking a large measure in and giving a small measure out was his standard operation. Skimming off the finished product and using "priority rights" to extort and demand bribes all depended on how black his heart was.

"Tell him to confess everything. What's the big deal? It's not a capital offense," Zhang Dashao said nonchalantly, legs crossed. "Once Head Yang returns to the mountain, this young master will compensate him."

Goudan couldn't hold out anyway. After receiving the message from Zhang Dashao's man, he confessed readily. Thus, Shi Jiuyue welcomed his first fellow sufferer, making the lonely Jiuyue weep with joy.

While Jiuyue and Goudan were having a heart-to-heart talk in the empty large granary, the two stewards and two matrons sent by Suo Chanzhi set out simultaneously, each inviting someone for "tea." They were the tenant head Shi Yiyue, Shi Jiuyue's younger brother; the artisan head Liang Feng; the canal chief Yao Yu; and the granary supervisor Zhuang Dehou.

Lai Gulu and Peng Jin, seeing this situation, couldn't hold their ground. They hurriedly went to find Zhang Dashao. Zhang Dashao was in the middle of fooling around with Sang Zhi and was cornered in the room by them. In a panic, he pushed Sang Zhi into the cabinet. This was his father's concubine. His father could use her to entertain guests, but that didn't mean he could sneak a bite.

As soon as Peng Jin entered, he sniffed. The smell in the room was a bit strange. "Young Master, it seems Head Yang has no intention of stopping."

"Yeah, yeah. He's arresting people one by one, almost clearing out all the lower-level staff," Lai Gulu added.

Zhang Dashao frowned. "What could be the problem? He hasn't even touched you two. Those small managers at the bottom are just suffering a bit. What's the big deal?"

Lai Gulu said worriedly, "Young Master, I'm afraid Yang Can has no intention of stopping! If he keeps this up, who will he arrest next?"

Peng Jin twitched his eyebrows, his expression grave. "It's only been three days. The Master has only been gone for three days. But..." Peng Jin's face lit up. "Shouldn't the Master be back soon?"

Lai Gulu also woke up as if from a dream and said happily, "That's right! The Master said he'd be back in two days. Today should be... maybe the Master was slightly delayed, so... he should be back tomorrow."

Seeing the two men's joyful expressions, Zhang Dashao felt quite displeased. With his father away, he was the most powerful figure in Feng'an Village, commanding the wind and rain, feeling incredibly free. But once his father returned, he would be reduced to the same old废物 his father looked down upon.

Zhang Dashao's face turned cold. "Since that's the case, what are you worried about? When my father returns tomorrow, he'll handle everything."

"Right, right, right," Lai Gulu and Peng Jin agreed repeatedly; that was what they were thinking too. Compared to Zhang Dashao, they had more confidence in Master Zhang. So, the village head Lai Gulu and the field supervisor Peng Jin bowed and took their leave.

Zhang Dashao didn't let Miss Sang Zhi out of the cabinet. He suddenly felt the cabinet was a very interesting place, so he climbed in too. The cabinet in Zhang Dashao's room began to creak and sway.

Meanwhile, Lai Gulu and Peng Jin were blocked at the gate leaving Feng'an Fort. In front of everyone, they were taken away roughly by Xiao Qingmei and her men.

Yang Can first removed the fuel from the fire and lured the tiger away from the mountain. Then, he began to nibble away at the branches and apply pressure step by step. The arrest of Lai Gulu and Peng Jin brought this to a climax.

Every time a manager was taken away in the past few days, it stirred up a storm in Feng'an Village. The psychological pressure on the managers, big and small, grew heavier, while the awe the villagers felt for Zhang Yunyi weakened more and more. By this point, Zhang Yunyi's supreme authority in Feng'an Village had collapsed with a crash.

All along, in the hearts of the Feng'an villagers, Master Zhang was their god. Now, a new god had arrived. When the new god and the old god clashed, whose divine power would be stronger? The villagers of Feng'an weren't entirely sure about this yet. So, even after Yang Can's notices were posted in the village, they were still watching and waiting.

There were five notices in total, posted at the four village exits and one at the entrance to Feng'an Fort. Yang Can listed the various illegal acts of these managers on the notices, encouraging the villagers to report or sue for their grievances. Once verified, Head Yang would offer compensation on behalf of the Yu family. This "benefit" made everyone quite tempted, but they still wanted to wait a bit longer, to see if Master Zhang would come down from Phoenix Mountain.

They had lived here for generations. If Head Yang couldn't defeat Master Zhang and just left, what would they do? At this time, a "shill" was needed.

This shill appeared. His name was Lin Yan, a relative of Cheng Dakuan, who was known as Leopard Head. Cheng Dakuan took him to see Zhang Yunyi, who was detained in the hunter's hut, giving him the courage to report.

In villages, conflicts among the people are common. If your wall is half a foot higher than mine, or my field ridge encroaches on your land by three inches, it can lead to a dogfight. These matters are inherently subjective. Sometimes they even involve matters of feng shui, making them extremely difficult to balance.

In the past, when Master Zhang's people handled such matters, they did so crudely. Either both parties were beaten fifty times, or the side that offered a bribe was heavily protected. Thus, although public resentment was great, it was all covered up by his absolute power.

Now, Lin Yan sued, and Yang Can's people sorted it out clearly and judged very fairly. The Lin family received their compensation smoothly, but Master Zhang never showed up. Rumors began to spread in the village that Master Zhang was detained on Phoenix Mountain. This was, of course, intentionally spread by Yang Can through Leopard Head's family. And it spread not only quickly but also became increasingly believable.

So, more villagers couldn't hold back. They still didn't dare to sue Master Zhang directly, but there was no harm in suing the managers, big and small, who had already been arrested. Thus, after Lin Yan set a precedent, Yang Can's notice was like poking a beehive, with a continuous stream of people coming to sue.

Fortunately, Yang Can didn't accept written complaints. Considering the villagers' illiteracy rate was almost 100%, Yang Can also allowed them to give oral statements. This exhausted Xiao Qingmei. Because there were few literate people, Xiao Qingmei also had to receive the suing farmers and help record their statements. The villagers' ability to express themselves was poor; they often beat around the bush for half a day without getting to the point. Qingmei had to repeatedly interrupt and bring their wandering topics back.

After a busy day, Xiao Qingmei's hands were sore and her mouth was dry. The pen in her hand didn't stop, and she didn't even have time to drink water. But Zhang Yunyi's supreme authority in Feng'an Village was being dismantled brick by brick in this process. The tower that had suppressed Feng'an Village for so many years was about to collapse!
