Chapter 49: The Crossing River Pawn Takes the Initiative

The noodles were finished.

They were delicious. Yang Can even drank the soup.

When Chef Zhu walked out of the small courtyard carrying the empty plate, he was full of pride.

Because eating everything clean is the best compliment a chef can receive.

There were guards sent by Manor Lord Zhang at the entrance of the small courtyard, and eight guards inside belonging to Yang Can and Qingmei.

But no one suspected Chef Zhu, because he was a genuine chef.

Early the next morning, Yang Can eagerly headed to the blacksmith’s shop.

Yang Can could propose reasonable ideas, while Li Yue was an experienced craftsman familiar with forging all kinds of farm tools. Working together, their progress was rapid.

By the third day, Blacksmith Li began crafting the curved-plow with his apprentice.

On the fifth day, they successfully built one and carried it to the fields for a test.

The plow still had flaws, but Blacksmith Li had already realized its advantages.

Even though it wasn't a finished product, its superiority was already evident.

That evening, after dinner, Yang Can sent a guard to invite Qingmei.

Qingmei was the personal maid of the noble lady of the Suo clan, so she had developed the habit of bathing daily. Her habits hadn't changed since coming to Feng'an Manor.

At this moment, she had just finished her bath.

Qingmei had changed into a breathable, absorbent cotton nightgown and sat before her dressing table. She hummed a cheerful tune while combing her hair with a horn comb.

"Miss Qingmei, Steward Yang requests your presence."

A knock came at the door, followed by the voice of a servant girl from the Zhang household.

In the boudoir, Qingmei's heart skipped a beat, and an irrepressible joy surged within her.

"Oh, understood."

Qingmei answered calmly. Hearing the footsteps fade away outside, she suddenly became flustered.

She hurriedly opened her makeup box, dipped a powder puff into the face powder, and patted it onto her face. Her delicate, fair skin seemed even more tender and white. Gazing at her reflection, she tilted her head back and applied powder beneath her neck as well.

Then, she used her little finger to scoop a bit of rouge, lightly traced her lips, and pressed them together.

Next, she tied her slightly damp hair into two double buns, secured with purple ribbons, before finally selecting her clothes.

Li Damu lived directly opposite Yang Can, with a pond separating the two buildings. The pond was covered with lotus leaves, lush and green.

At that moment, Li Damu stood by the window, hands clasped behind his back, his brow furrowed in conflict.

He had something on his mind.

During the account auditing, Miss Xiaotan had been attending to him closely. The charming, cute girl would occasionally massage his shoulders, pound his legs, serve tea, or pour water...

When Li Damu gradually reached out with his "greedy paws," Xiaotan would act shy and coy, half-resisting and half-yielding.

But whenever he tried to go further, Xiaotan would gently refuse him.

So, Mr. Li was distressed.

He knew in his heart this was a bait laid out by Manor Lord Zhang.

If possible, he wouldn't mind taking the bait. He never expected to rise high just by auditing Feng'an Manor's accounts. No matter how high he flew, he would still be an accountant. If Manor Lord Zhang offered enough, he wouldn't mind "showing leniency."

However, accepting money is different from accepting a person.

Accepting money is straightforward, a clear price for a clear service.

Accepting a person, he worried Manor Lord Zhang might make some unreasonable demands of him. He was willing to play dumb, but that didn't mean he wanted to wade into troubled waters.

Yet, thinking of that little woman as delicate as a fragrant fan pendant—visible but untouchable—made him itch with frustration.

He had been agonizing over this for days, feeling unbearably itchy.

Suddenly, he saw Qingmei from his window.

Slightly dressed up and even more charming, Qingmei was sneaking toward Yang Can's residence like a thief. Before entering, she even looked around nervously.

Li Damu was instantly filled with envy and jealousy.

Why?! Why does Steward Yang have beauties constantly throwing themselves at him, while old Li has to endure it hard?

Yang Can had been "shirking his duties" these past few days to work on improving the plow, which Li Damu had heard about. Since the head steward has started "slacking off," why should I work so hard?

Finding a reason to convince himself, Li Damu suddenly felt excited. This bait, I'll take it! I'll take it tomorrow!

"Cough... it's so late... why did you ask me to come?" Qingmei asked carefully, her heart pounding, her face warm.

Yang Can's curved-plow was about to be completed, and Leopard Head had also made progress. He was ready to cast his net.

For a man, the only thing that can surpass the temptation of beauty is probably fighting.

Yang Can, brimming with fighting spirit, completely ignored Qingmei's mixed feelings of fear and anticipation. He grabbed Qingmei and said excitedly, "Come here, I have something to tell you."

Qingmei was pulled by him and thought she was about to be thrown onto the bed. After all, that seemed to be one of his little quirks. Gritting her teeth to prevent herself from screaming when she fell onto the bed, she was instead pushed down into a round-backed chair.

Huh? Is it possible here too?

Qingmei thought it might be a bit difficult, but given her petite figure, it might not be impossible. But it's her first time, wouldn't it be too casual?

While Qingmei was lost in wild thoughts, Yang Can had already pulled a chair and sat down opposite her.

"Qingmei, I want you to return to the mountain villa tomorrow."

Qingmei was stunned and said blankly, "Ah? Return to the mountain villa?"

Yang Can nodded. "Yes! I'm all set here and ready to act. For safety's sake, I need more help. You go back to the mountain tomorrow. When you see the young mistress, say..."

Yang Can explained the plan he had repeatedly deliberated to Qingmei in detail.

The romantic notions in Qingmei's heart were completely replaced by shock.

"Are... are you sure? If there's a mistake, you won't be able to explain yourself..."

"It's not a big problem. I'll use the completion of the curved-plow as a cover, and also use it as a guarantee."

Yang Can said, "As for the rest, I'll leave it to fate."

Qingmei wasn't just a little maid who only knew how to serve people; she understood the stakes involved. After a moment of hesitation, she nodded. "Alright, I'll head back to the mountain early tomorrow morning. But if I leave, the guards will go with me. You'll be left alone and vulnerable... Don't act recklessly before I get back."

Yang Can smiled. "Don't worry, without you to protect me, what can a scholar who can't even tie a chicken do?"

The two discussed the details thoroughly before Qingmei got up to leave.

By the time she went downstairs, the night was deep, and the moonlight flowed like water.

In the building opposite, Li Damu had finished his bath and changed into his pajamas. Perhaps because he had just bathed, his spirits seemed somewhat low.

Through the slightly open window crack, he saw Qingmei again. At that moment, the mist from the pond was silently rising onto the stone steps, flowers, and the blue bricks under the eaves. Qingmei strolled through it, like a fairy.

"Tsk, Steward Yang eats well indeed. That's fine... fine rice and white flour!"

"Ah, youth is truly wonderful. She stayed so long!"

Li Damu sighed in admiration, his slender fingers stroking the beard under his chin, as elegant as playing a zither.

The same moon hung over the sky above Dailai City, upstream on the Wuding River.

Dailai City is a vital transportation line between the Hetao region and the Central Plains. It is also the headquarters that Yu Huanhu, the second branch of the Yu clan's main family, has operated for many years.

The population within Dailai City and the surrounding rural households totals over seventeen thousand, with nearly one hundred thousand people. Of course, this only accounts for registered households. The local nomadic tribes, the dependent populations of temples, the hidden populations of local tyrants, and some floating populations engaged in industry and commerce are not included.

This is also the reason why Yu Xinglong did not dare to easily kill Yu Huanhu.

The residence of the Yu clan head is called "Phoenix Mountain Villa," while Yu Huanhu's residence is called "North Tower Villa." The character "Que" implies palace restrictions, while "Bieye" refers to an unofficial residence. By naming his residence this, Yu Huanhu's restless ambitions are already glaringly obvious.

The "Blackwater Pavilion" in North Tower Villa is decorated in a strong Hu style. The walls are hung not with calligraphy and paintings, but with swords, blades, bows, and arrows. The floor is covered with a huge, brightly colored pile-woven carpet with relief-style patterns of artistic transformations of lightning and mountains.

It was late at night, but Yu Huanhu was full of energy, without a trace of fatigue. Behind a side table sat his eldest son, Yu Rui.

"Father, the main family has sent people to inspect the manors. Their first stop was Feng'an Manor."

Yu Huanhu narrowed his eyes. "Feng'an Manor is the closest to Phoenix Mountain. It's only natural they checked it first."

Yu Rui said, "Father, are we just going to sit back and watch?"

Yu Huanhu chuckled lightly. "Since we've already handed them over, how can we interfere openly?"

Yu Rui understood the subtext and his eyes darted around. "Zhang Yunyi has always been sharp. They might not be able to find any evidence against Manor Lord Zhang?"

Yu Huanhu shook his head and said calmly, "When others want to find fault with you, you are bound to have faults. Besides, I handed over the six manors in a great hurry. Zhang Yunyi didn't have time to do much tampering."

"Then... are we just going to watch?"

"So what?"

Yu Huanhu said dismissively, "It's not just one Feng'an Manor. Even the six manors and three pastures are just chips I threw on the table. Killing a thousand enemies costs eight hundred of our own. I can afford to lose, but your uncle cannot. Besides, I publicly declared that I would live in seclusion in Dailai City. My words are still fresh. If I go back on them now, how can I ever be trusted again?"

Yu Rui nodded and smiled. "Father, do you know who the main family sent to inspect the manors?"

Yu Huanhu frowned. "This is a thankless job, full of pitfalls at every step. He wouldn't send his close confidants. If it's not a close confidant, I can't guess."

"Yang Can! It's Yang Can!" Yu Rui said with a smile. "It seems this man, who spoke up for you, has indeed offended the head of the main family."

Yu Huanhu was taken aback. It was actually him?

Regarding Chengye's death, the Yu clan was investigating, and Yu Huanhu, who had been wrongly blamed, was also investigating. However, the truth was shrouded in a fog, and he had yet to find any clues.

But he hadn't forgotten about Yang Can. He had previously sent his second son, Yu Ming, to investigate Yang Can's background and learned that he was a scholar from a poor family who had fled to Longshang after offending a powerful figure in the Central Plains.

Yu Huanhu pondered, "Your uncle plans to make this Yang Can take the blame when I make my move this autumn."

Yu Rui said, "Father, is this person worth recruiting?"

"Hmm..." Yu Huanhu stroked his beard and fell into deep thought.
