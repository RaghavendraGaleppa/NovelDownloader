# Chapter 54: Burial Yin Coffin

The coffin appeared unremarkable at first glance, its grayish surface giving off a smooth, stone-like coolness to the touch, yet upon closer inspection, one could discern the wood grain texture of its material.

Once lifted from the water, droplets quickly rolled off its surface as if repelled by some non-stick coating, leaving it dry and clean in moments.

"Divine objects conceal their brilliance, and it even has nano-coating technology? Excellent! Absolutely excellent!"

This was Jiang Li's first time acquiring a magical artifact, and he couldn't help but admire every aspect of it. No matter what peculiarities the coffin displayed, in his eyes, they were all manifestations of its extraordinary and high-grade nature.

[Note: Promotion brings prosperity]

A quick appraisal spell revealed almost no useful information, which only heightened Jiang Li's excitement. The fact that it couldn't be easily identified suggested its grade was anything but low.

Circling the coffin twice, he lifted it to test its weight. The craftsmanship was undoubtedly solid—it felt like it weighed at least five hundred jin. But what was its original purpose? Surely it wasn't meant to be wielded as a blunt weapon or simply as a resting place for the dead? He wondered if it would reveal other functions once refined.

Pushing open the lid, Jiang Li reached inside and rummaged around. Moments later, he retrieved the fire-attribute flying sword. The blade bore a noticeable dent and a slight bend. Attempting to channel spiritual energy into it yielded no response. 

Yet, a flying sword was still a flying sword—even if unusable, its sharpness remained unparalleled. The gleaming edge could likely slice through stone with ease. Flipping the blade, Jiang Li pressed its tip against his palm and drew it across forcefully, creating a gash that immediately welled with blood.

Ordinary blades could hardly pierce his skin anymore. If not for stumbling upon this sword, drawing blood would have been a challenge. Not one to waste, he quickly smeared his bloody hand across the coffin.

As he chanted an incantation, his blood continued to flow but didn't spill onto the ground like water. Instead, it slowly saturated the coffin's surface, seeping in alongside his yin-attribute spiritual energy.

[Yin Refinement Technique Lv4]  

This was the third spell Jiang Li had mastered.  

The Yin Refinement Technique, a yin-attribute support spell, specialized in refining and enhancing magical artifacts.  

---  

The iron chain Jiang Li had been using all this time, aside from its inherent ferocious nature, owed its capabilities to this very technique.  

Back at the outer sect's burial grounds, he had captured two minor ghosts drawn by the yin energy and used them as materials to refine the chain twice. This granted it the ability to twist and turn mid-flight to some extent.  

Otherwise, without any formal training in whip or chain techniques, how could he have mastered its use so quickly? He could wrap it around anything he aimed for with near-perfect accuracy.  

Now, using his own blood as a medium, Jiang Li sought to refine this coffin for his own use.  

Initially, due to the coffin's high grade, the refinement process proved challenging.  

However, perhaps because the coffin had remained ownerless for so long, devoid of any living presence, it had grown lonely.  

Or maybe its material was simply extraordinary, savoring the taste of fresh blood.  

Before long, the absorption of blood and yin energy accelerated dramatically. Soon, all the spilled blood had been absorbed, and a suction force latched onto the wound on his right hand.  

This was unexpected—it could actually drink blood?  

Jiang Li felt his hand tighten as the once-smooth coffin surface suddenly adhered to his palm. The suction intensified, draining his blood several times faster than normal. It seemed intent on sucking him dry!  

[Bloodsucking Wood makes contact with wound. Acute Blood Loss effect applied to self.]  
[Acute Blood Loss: HP decreases by 10 per second. Blood loss accelerates. Wound healing suppressed. Duration: 30 minutes.] (-+)  

Bloodsucking Wood? The name alone reeked of ominous implications.  

Thirty minutes? At sixty seconds per minute and ten HP per second, that amounted to a staggering eighteen thousand HP—six to seven times his maximum health.  

If he couldn't break free, multiple versions of himself would be drained dry, ending up like that Fire Sword cultivator from the Shu Mountain's Five Elements Peak.  

But with the status panel now active, Jiang Li wasn't overly worried. Instead, he leveraged the Bloodsucking Wood's properties to accelerate the refinement process, allowing his blood and spiritual energy to permeate deeper.  

Two minutes later, pale-faced, he dispelled the Acute Blood Loss effect. Yet his hand remained firmly stuck to the coffin.  

An ordinary human would be on the verge of death after losing thirty percent of their blood. As a cultivator with spiritual energy reinforcing his body, Jiang Li could survive with just fifty percent or even less.  

Still, such massive blood loss left him feeling weak.  

---  

For now, he couldn't dwell on it. With his accelerated blood regeneration, recovery would take less than two days. The priority was refining this coffin.  

The blood he had already invested far exceeded the Yin Refinement Technique's requirements, so each time the blood loss effect reappeared, he promptly dispelled it.  

Then, he poured in more yin-attribute spiritual energy to continue the refinement.  

This coffin's grade had to be beyond Yellow-rank—otherwise, refining it wouldn't be this difficult!  

Though Jiang Li had temporarily halted the blood loss, the wound remained. Every thirty seconds, the Bloodsucking Wood's properties would trigger another bout of blood loss.  

He had no choice but to repeatedly dispel the effect and press on with the refinement.  

At times like this, he realized that clicking the minus button thirty times took less than five seconds. His years of honed clicking speed from his past life finally proved useful, saving him a significant amount of HP.  

Half an hour later, Jiang Li's hand finally came free, and he collapsed onto the ground, panting heavily.  

Refining a magical artifact was no joke—he had nearly been drained dry. Even with accelerated energy recovery, his spiritual energy had almost been completely exhausted.  

Weren't artifacts supposed to recognize their masters with just a few drops of blood? How did picking up an ownerless coffin turn into such a fiasco?  

At least it was finally done. Now, let's see what you really are.  

He cast another Appraisal spell.  

The mechanics of Appraisal were rather unscientific. Half an hour ago, it had revealed nothing. But now that the coffin was fully refined and belonged to him, the appraisal proceeded without issue.
