# Chapter 12: Enraged Liu Kuang, the Emissary Arrives!

"Su Yu!"

As Manager Zhou's voice rang out, the bustling hall instantly fell silent. The two words "Su Yu" seemed to possess a magical power, causing everyone present to widen their eyes and stare intently at the white-robed young man at the counter.

"Is Su Yu the young man President Liu paid so much attention to a few days ago?"

"Yeah, I also heard there was a genius named Su Yu who appeared in Hengcheng a few days ago, but I never saw him, so I thought it was fake. I can't believe I'm meeting him today!"

"If Su Yu has appeared, doesn't that mean Hengcheng's record for the youngest martial artist has really been broken?"

Everyone discussed animatedly. A few days ago, rumors spread within the Martial Artist Association that a young man named Su Yu had broken Hengcheng's record, one that had stood for decades, even centuries. However, since most people hadn't seen Su Yu, they just dismissed it with a laugh. It didn't cause much of a stir in the Martial Artist Association, as there were simply too many false rumors in this era. Furthermore, high-ranking officials like Liu Kuang hadn't confirmed it, so most people assumed it was fake. Unexpectedly, the legendary Su Yu had appeared today. Now, connecting this to Su Yu's earlier request to see Liu Kuang, everything made sense.

A moment later, under Manager Zhou's lead, Su Yu arrived at Liu Kuang's office door. Manager Zhou knocked. Soon, Liu Kuang's deep voice came from within.

"Enter!"

With Liu Kuang's unspoken permission, Manager Zhou then led Su Yu, pushing open the office door and stepping inside. Upon entering, Su Yu saw Liu Kuang sitting majestically on the sofa, his gaze fixed on a stack of documents on the table. Liu Kuang's peripheral vision caught sight of Su Yu, and he immediately smiled.

"What brings our little genius here?"

As he spoke, he stood up to greet Su Yu. Manager Zhou, witnessing this scene, felt a pang of envy. He knew that even he, as one of the most powerful individuals under the two presidents of the Martial Artist Association, had never received such treatment from Liu Kuang. Yet, Su Yu, merely a martial artist who had just entered the realm, was treated this way by Liu Kuang. Even Manager Zhou felt a bit sour. But there was nothing he could do; after all, Su Yu was Hengcheng's youngest martial artist in over a hundred years.

"That's how it happened."

After Su Yu finished recounting the events, he noticed that Liu Kuang's face had turned ashen.

*Thud!*

Liu Kuang slammed his fist onto the table. The sturdy table instantly cracked, lines spreading across its surface. It looked as if a mere gust of wind could easily shatter the now-fissured table. Manager Zhou, standing nearby, also frowned deeply, his expression extremely grim.

"The Li Clan Group..."

Liu Kuang took a deep breath, so angry he began to laugh instead. "Very good. A mere small group dares to disregard the Martial Artist Association's rules, just because they have a Blood Forging realm martial artist, eh?!"

"Zhou Wen!" Liu Kuang roared.
