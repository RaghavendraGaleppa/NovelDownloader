# Chapter 212: The Flood Dragon Rises! Heroes Stir the Waves

The python-dragon had积蓄 momentum for many days, finally breaking its shackles. It left the pool for the river, and the river for the great waterway. Within the murky river waters, the dragon's form flickered in and out of sight.

Lightning flashed brilliantly, reflecting off its scales, casting a chilling radiance in all directions.

Watching the dragon churn, its massive tail slammed against the riverbank. With a thunderous roar, the bank collapsed, turning into a rolling torrent of mud that was swept away.

The river, which had just begun to calm, surged several times faster in an instant. The wind howled, the rain screamed, and heaven and earth changed their colors.

Yet the heroes...

Feared not that the world would fall into chaos, nor that the waves were not high enough!

Li Qianfan stood at the helm at the forefront, shouting, "Now *this* is a proper river wave!" He turned the rudder, the wind filled the sails, and he closely followed in the dragon's wake.

The river was vast and surging endlessly. The Dragon Boat rocked upon the waters but did not capsize. Swept along by the current, its speed was such that the scenery on both banks flashed by in a blur.

Li Xian had never witnessed such a sight. The more violently the river surged, the hotter his blood boiled. Hearing the rolling thunder, his chest swelled, and a fiery passion refused to subside. He came to the deck and saw a massive wave at the river's head, rising dozens or even hundreds of meters high!

Li Xian also let out a few loud shouts, opening his heart and calling out. His long hair danced in the wind as he gripped the ship's handrails tightly. The ship was sometimes lifted several meters high by the waves, then slammed heavily back into the river.

It was sometimes turbulent and trembling, sometimes on the verge of capsizing. It seemed precarious, yet it remained miraculously resilient.

Tan Yang, the scholar, stood at the bow. Regardless of how the ship rocked, he remained calm and composed. Moved by the moment, he recited, "Ten thousand miles of rivers flow eastward; today, they enter the sea to become a true dragon!"

The python-dragon broke through the water, leaping into the sky. Rising dozens of meters high, its entire form was revealed. Dragon roars echoed one after another, as if responding to Tan Yang's heroic verse.

Such a river current—could it cover a thousand miles in a day?

It was ten thousand miles in a day!

The python-dragon churned the river, a grand momentum indeed. The rising of the waters had begun. It was the gathering point of heaven and earth's splendor, driven by the currents of fate. All was contained within.

Suddenly, the python-dragon let out a roar that shook the heavens.

Rushing for a hundred miles, the first obstacle appeared before them... a gate full of sharp spikes stood across the river, blocking the path of the rising waters.

On both banks.

The guests of the Hundred Miles Banquet had been waiting for a long time. Seeing the python-dragon rise and the Dragon Boat approach, the head of the banquet, Zhang Yu, stood on high ground and cupped his fists. "Senior Dragon, please ascend the Dragon Seat!"

He then said to the crowd, "Release for me!"

The powerful experts from the banquet all displayed their techniques, pushing huge boulders into the river. Carried by the current, the boulders crashed into the gate. With a "cracking" sound... the gate shattered, and the spikes were all broken.

The python-dragon roared twice, as if in thanks. It rushed past the gate and swam away.

Zhang Yu led the heroes, standing on the riverbank to see him off, cupping their fists in salute. Li Xian stood on the boat, watching from afar.

The great splendor, the grand banquet, the major event of the world... these were the keys to bolstering or crushing one's spirit. With a grand spectacle before one, if one is afraid, one's spirit is crushed. If one is奋起 (fènqǐ - to rise up vigorously), one's spirit is enriched.

Without seeing the world's grand sights, so-called spirit is merely supported by a bit of will. But to see the world's grand sights, to embrace all the world's风采 (fēngcǎi - elegance and style). To be hacked by axes and chisels, yet if one's spirit still does not waver or diminish, then it is truly soul-stirring.

"We martial cultivators, if we do not gallop across the heavens and earth, what is the point of cultivating martial arts? Today, I have witnessed the dragon entering the sea. In the future... if I could ride a dragon to travel the world, it would truly not be a waste to walk this path!" Li Xian's heart surged. His robes billowed, the river wind rushed, and in an instant, heroic spirit flooded his heart.

Wen Caishang observed through the window. Her brows furrowed and then relaxed. She glanced at the old dragon in the river, then closed her eyes to rest, quietly waiting for her opportunity.

Thus, the python-dragon rose for over a thousand miles.

There were obstacles all along the way, but heroes helped at every turn.

"Junior Jiang Kai of the Two Hundred Miles Banquet, here to help Senior ascend the Dragon Seat."

"Junior He Qi of the Three Hundred Miles Banquet, here to help Senior ascend the Dragon Seat."

Two groups of heroes gathered by the river. They charged all the way, opening a path through danger, obstacles, and difficulties... The momentum of the rising waters was unstoppable.

When they passed a tributary within the "Yunan Dao Yangchun Prefecture."

They were already thousands of miles from Dragon Claw Town. Here, a "Thousand Miles Banquet" was set up. Its head was "Thunderclap Mouth · Iron Big Mouth," an old and powerful expert of the Jianghu.

He cursed loudly, his voice traveling extremely far. "Damn it, a bunch of little rats, using such insidious methods. If I catch them, I'll宰了 them and eat them!"

Beside him was "Divine Leg of the Iron Foot · Wu Feiyu," a famous light-footwork expert in Yunan Dao. He said, "We should be cautious. We can't guarantee they won't succeed."

Iron Big Mouth saw the river current growing more urgent and frowned. "The Senior Dragon is arriving. This matter must be resolved quickly!"

It turned out...

This place was called the "Mother-Son Fork," the first great danger in the rising waters!

The Benhua River flowed to this point and was split by the terrain into two—one left, one right. The flowers, plants, and architecture on both banks, as well as the mountain shapes, were all extremely similar. With the naked eye, it was difficult to spot the trick.

However, the left river channel flowed into the sea. The right channel, however, gradually transformed from a river into a lake. If the python-dragon took the right path, it would become shallower and narrower, and the rising of the waters would be over.

It would be trapped among the lakes.

It would be like a fish on a chopping block, butchered at will by those hosting the Dragon-Slaying Banquet. Therefore, this section was crucial to success or failure and could not be treated carelessly.

And it was precisely here that villains, using the terrain, had set up a reversal confusion array. It could make one lose their sense of direction, with fog obscuring everything, one's mind wandering, making it hard to distinguish left from right.

It could be said to be extremely insidious.

Iron Big Mouth said, "His grandmother's, is there anyone in our banquet who understands Feng Shui and geomancy? Can we break this damn array?"

Everyone looked at each other, all feeling anxious. But they were helpless against this confusion array. Seeing the river surge and the python-dragon's rise approaching this place, if a mistake occurred, all their efforts would be in vain. It was truly a pity.

Iron Big Mouth said, "Damn it, these little rats playing this hand, I really didn't expect it. But we aren't vegetarians either."

"Feiyu... you're fast. Since we can't distinguish left from right here, you just pick a river channel, run a few miles or ten miles, confirm which channel leads to the sea, and immediately light a signal to let us know!"

Wu Feiyu said, "In that case... it seems we have no other choice." He stepped on the waves, crossing the surging river. His speed was so fast he became a black dot in the blink of an eye.

The Benhua River was forty-nine thousand miles long, winding and twisting, with countless tributaries. The experts of the赏龙宴 (Shanglong Banquet) had started rushing here several days ago.

Relying on the surging river water, they rode nimble and fast boats, arriving ahead of the python-dragon. They were here to escort it, to deal with the crisis of the dragon-slaying banquet. The rising of the python-dragon was a gathering of splendor.

The struggle of man, the struggle of heaven, the struggle of earth... all was contained within!

"It's here!"

Iron Big Mouth saw the river water churn and the emerald green dragon body appear. Further back, the Dragon Boat rocked in the water, also following the current.

Wen Caishang frowned, standing at the bow of the ship, and said in a low voice, "A Feng Shui geomancy array?"

Inside the Dragon Boat, Tan Yang the Scholar (Qi Kaiyan), Golden Blade Earth Dragon (Zhu Butong), the Sword-Hugging Old Woman (Su Yu), and several other experts gathered at the bow.

Su Yu said, "I have long heard that Madam Wen is widely knowledgeable. What array is set up here? What is its function?"

Wen Caishang pointed to the towering mountains on both banks. "Look closely. These are the Mother and Son Mountains. Because the Feng Shui of the two places is similar, their culture, customs, and terrain are all alike. Over a long time, two similar great mountains were formed."

"They are like twin brothers, similar in appearance. But even twin brothers have a senior and junior distinction. No matter how similar these Mother and Son Mountains are, they are divided into Mother and Son. Someone has arranged a confusion array based on the mountain terrain."

"There is a bronze tripod in each of these mountains. Do you all see it?"

Zhu Butong looked from afar and saw a large tripod standing atop the mountain peak. He said, "It is indeed so."

"These two bronze tripods are also one Mother and one Son. In the Son Mountain, they placed the Mother Tripod. In the Mother Mountain, they placed the Son Tripod. This has the meaning of confusing Mother and Son, and reversing Left and Right."

"The water vapor here is dense, and the Feng Shui is chaotic. Standing here, Left is no longer Left, and Right is no longer Right. It is easy to take the wrong river channel."

Wen Caishang said gravely, "If we take the wrong river channel, it will be eternal damnation!"

Qi Kaiyan asked, "Does Madam Wen have a way to break it?"

Wen Caishang shook her head. "It is out of reach. If I had arrived here earlier, this small confusion array would have been easily broken. Unfortunately, we are approaching the fork, time is tight, and it is already too late."

"What then?" Su Yu asked urgently.

"Reversing Left and Right is not a problem. It is merely a gamble on luck," Wen Caishang said calmly.

"In such a situation, Madam Wen is still so composed. What great bearing!" Qi Kaiyan and Zhu Butong praised, both feeling admiration. They gazed at the river channel, but could not help feeling worried.

Suddenly, a loud sound was heard. Iron Big Mouth was using his martial art, his voice like thunder. "Senior Dragon, please come this way!"

The experts of the Thousand Miles Banquet on the shore displayed their martial arts, slapping the giant waves. They created a commotion, and Iron Big Mouth's loud voice, like an exploding thunderclap, made everyone's spirits shake. Their gazes pierced through the fog, and they saw the heroes of the banquet.

The python-dragon churned its body and, following the指示 (zhǐshì - instruction), swam into the correct river channel. After traveling another dozen miles, the fog gradually cleared, and it swam past the array. Seeing the vast river water, it felt suddenly enlightened.

The heroes on the boat all felt slightly relieved. Thus... across the ten-thousand-mile river, the python-dragon rose, passing through layer after layer of obstacles. It was not just the dragon showing its might; the Jianghu experts along the river, who among them did not shine with brilliance, each displaying their skills.

At the five-thousand-mile mark.

The Benhua River turned north, entering the Longxiong Dao.

Here was a dangerous place with a drop, a rare spectacle: the Sky-Reversed Waterfall.

The terrain here was special. It actually made the water flow upwards, so the river, passing through this place, had to climb a steep cliff.

The river surged endlessly. Whether it flowed up or down, how could an outsider tell? So to an outsider, this place was a thousand-zhang high waterfall.

In reality, the water was flowing upward; it was a reverse waterfall.

This unique natural barrier was a problem gifted by heaven. The Benhua River stretched for nearly fifty thousand miles to the sea, with countless strange terrains. How could it be easy to transform from a dragon to a true dragon?

The python-dragon, rising to this point, had to cross a thousand-zhang high cliff. Although the water flowed upward, it was difficult to support the dragon's massive body. Even the much smaller Dragon Boat would find it difficult to cross this obstacle.

The python-dragon was between a python and a dragon. It could fly, but not very high. How could it cross a thousand-zhang cliff?

Suddenly, a "rumbling" sound was heard.

The python-dragon made its first leap, rising hundreds of zhang, its body fully displayed. But it was still far from the high cliff. The python-dragon plunged into the waterfall water, using the upward force of the waterfall to leap again.

It rose another hundred zhang or so, and plunged into the waterfall water again. Using the water's force, it leaped again... another hundred zhang. It continued this several times, reaching nine hundred zhang from the ground.

But it revealed a desperate situation. Each time it entered the water to leap, it only rose ten-odd zhang. But the distance it fell was also ten-odd zhang.

So... even using all its strength, it could only maintain its position and not fall back. With no other choice, the python-dragon fell back below the cliff, resting and蓄势 (xùshì - gathering momentum), preparing for another impact.

Li Xian had seen many strange things and sights. Seeing the "Sky-Reversed Waterfall" again, he was no longer surprised. But he still marveled at this magnificent scenery.

The water flowed in reverse upwards, with clouds and mist gathering, the water cliff standing tall.

Seeing this scene, he could not help but ponder: "Such a water cliff, even if the water flows against the current, providing force to push against midway, it is still extremely difficult to cross."

The rising of the python-dragon was truly not easy.

And just at this moment, a strange sound was heard!
