**Chapter 126: Patriarch-Level Performance**

The living room was quiet. Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun sat motionless, no longer making a sound, fearing they might disturb the focused young man.

In the bronze censer, the calming incense, known for clearing the mind, slowly burned.

Qin Ming set down the three pages of scripture, walked into the courtyard, took a deep breath, and exhaled with a special rhythm, his eyes shining like stars. According to his own understanding, he transformed his Tianguang Jin into an astonishing number of fine lines, expanding them within his flesh, verifying the three diagrams corresponding to the three pages.

His Tianguang Jin was the foundation of his current standing; after its integration and unification, for Outer Realm disciples, it was like a golden sun shining down.

Now, his Tianguang Jin flowed like golden rivers within his flesh, mirroring the dense network shown in the first diagram.

He felt warm and quite comfortable all over. At this moment, his brow glowed, his body heated up, and he became clear and unblemished from head to toe, as if he were about to ascend to the heavens.

Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun were dumbfounded. This was more than just feeling something different; he was already achieving results!

How much time had passed, all things considered? Both of them were lost in thought at this realization!

“Everyone’s comprehension is different. Is he opening up a completely new operational route?” Li Qingyun transmitted his voice secretly, not daring to speak aloud for fear of disturbing the intensely focused young man.

He knew very well that the engravings on the copper plate were outrageously numerous, giving one no clue where to start. Everyone who tried to comprehend it would invariably grasp their own unique operational path.

He was filled with anticipation, a brilliant light shining in his aged eyes. He was actually witnessing a young man expanding a new path firsthand!

“Historically, this scripture has stumped many patriarchs, yet he has comprehended it quite deeply and is opening a new path!” Meng Xinghai secretly nodded, praising in his heart, truly worthy of his high regard!

Subsequently, Qin Ming used his Conscious Spiritual Light to form strands of lines, traversing through his flesh, constructing a dense network.

Soon, he frowned; it wasn't as smooth or comfortable as before.

In the mountain-river spirit nest, not only had his spirit undergone a qualitative change, but he had also practiced a chant Li Qingyue taught him, giving birth to Conscious Spiritual Light. However, most of it had already nourished his physical body, leaving only a small amount to maintain a certain balance.

And in the past two days, while practicing the methods from the Esoteric Sect's thin booklet, sacred light was born within his body, and a similar phenomenon occurred: that light nourished his physical body, ultimately leaving only a small amount to maintain balance.

The so-called sacred light was what the Esoteric Sect called "Divine Wisdom," which underwent qualitative changes with cultivation, constantly accumulating and improving.

Qin Ming discovered that when he tried to construct dense lines within his flesh separately using Conscious Spiritual Light and Divine Wisdom, expanding them forward naturally, he encountered significant resistance.

Moreover, he didn't have that feeling of lightness and emptiness he had earlier; it was very uncomfortable, which went against the true meaning of the scripture.

“Is it really only suitable for those on the New Life Path?” Qin Ming murmured to himself, standing still, pondering the scripture and the three diagrams.

Then, he twisted his Tianguang Jin, Conscious Spiritual Light, and Divine Wisdom into a single strand, letting it spread within his flesh, constructing a mysterious network and expanding it outwards.

Qin Ming instantly felt his body become light, his mind clear, as if cleansed of worldly impurities and mental dust. From his body to his spirit, he felt a sense of enlightenment and completeness, as described in ancient religious texts.

“This feels like nourishing oneself.”

He carefully savored the feeling, realizing the true wonder of this scripture. Long-term practice could alter one's bone structure, enhance life vitality, and nourish essence, qi, and spirit.

In this state, with a clear mind and empty consciousness, the efficiency of comprehending techniques increased, and he felt a sense of joy and satisfaction, like an instant awakening.

Qin Ming suddenly realized: weren't these exactly the "famous tricks" Li Qingyun had mentioned, cultivated by renowned figures?

He had actually touched upon all of them. He now understood that the content on the three pages and the engravings on the copper plate should be considered the outline of this scripture.

Qin Ming knew he had comprehended and mastered it.

“This cultivation method has many wonders. Persistent practice is equivalent to slowly altering one's fate, but it’s still far from true longevity,” he mused.

He looked up and saw the fervent light in Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun’s eyes as they stared at him.

“You comprehended it?”

“You’ve already expanded a new path?”

Both were quite agitated, asking eagerly.

Clearly, they were more invested than he was.

Qin Ming nodded and said, “I don’t think the difficulty is that great.”

He spoke the truth, because this scripture hadn't stumped him for even half a day.

It should be known that a single silk scroll had taken him over a decade and a near-death experience to even get started, after which he formally embarked on the New Life Path.

In Qin Ming's mind, there was no cultivation method more difficult than that silk scroll.

However, Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun didn't know this, so their feelings were naturally hard to describe.

Especially the latter, who felt a bit doubtful about his own life and even a little sad for himself. Li Qingyun had meticulously studied it, secluded for several years, yet he couldn't compare to a young man's sudden enlightenment.

Qin Ming said, “You two seem very interested in this book? It is indeed quite extraordinary; it can enhance talent and prolong life. I can teach you.”

“This…” Li Qingyun hesitated. At his advanced age and profound cultivation, to sponge off a junior’s enlightened insights? He couldn’t bring himself to do it.

Meng Xinghai was more open-minded and immediately followed suit to learn.

Li Qingyun gritted his teeth and threw caution to the wind as well.

However, soon both were staring blankly. They couldn’t operate the new path Qin Ming had expanded. Forcing it, they almost caused internal blockages.

“What’s going on?” Qin Ming was also surprised. He then asked them to follow him, even allowing them to extend their Conscious Spiritual Light to observe the path he constructed.

Even if the two followed and imitated, it was useless; they simply couldn't operate it.

Li Qingyun, with his profound cultivation, eventually observed that each time Qin Ming circulated his Tianguang Jin, the dense lines subtly adjusted themselves as time passed.

“How do you control that?” he couldn't help but ask.

Qin Ming explained, “This scripture, in essence, talks about ‘Internal Fortification’…”

The phrase “Internal Fortification” almost made Li Qingyun and Meng Xinghai break down. This was an ancient scripture related to longevity, of immense origin, from the depths of the Night Mist World.

And this young man treated it like ordinary martial arts circulating in the market?

Qin Ming explained, “This cultivation method is indeed extraordinary. If practiced persistently year after year, it can alter one’s bone structure, nourish the physical body and spirit, and eventually lead to a qualitative change.”

The two nodded, acknowledging it as a method of changing fate, a secret text.

Qin Ming continued, “It might not be what you imagine; it doesn’t grant longevity. Overall, it’s essentially a method for ‘Internal Fortification’.”

Their expressions changed again; those two words, “Internal Fortification,” were quite stimulating.

Qin Ming mused, “Perhaps, in ancient times, people pursued paths different from ours. They only sought to prolong life and change their physique, so the entire method is very gentle, far inferior in power to Heaven-Propping Energy or Six Imperial Energy. Looking at its outline, it’s a book on health preservation.”

“You mean you’ve thoroughly comprehended and mastered it completely, not just understood a part of it?” Li Qingyun asked.

Qin Ming nodded, “These three pages of scripture and their corresponding copper plate engravings, I feel I’ve comprehended their true meaning.”

“Tell me, how did you expand those paths and manage to operate them?” Li Qingyun didn’t mind losing face, asking and inquiring on the spot; he genuinely found it hard to believe.

Qin Ming began, “This scripture speaks of grasping the changes of Yin and Yang, breathing in spiritual essence, integrating consciousness and divine wisdom into Tianguang Jin, planting them into the flesh, mutually being Yin and Yang, aligning with heaven and earth…”

He added, “If there’s no Conscious Spiritual Light and Divine Wisdom, just Tianguang Jin is enough.”

He then demonstrated, telling them to follow their nature. Once aligned with heaven and earth, Tianguang Jin would naturally spread, and wherever it went would be the operational path. One would naturally feel comfortable, light, clear, accompanied by a sense of completion.

Li Qingyun was dumbfounded. After a long while, he finally said, “You’re too subjective! You’re completely letting Tianguang Jin choose on its own, and then you just memorized the path and told us?”

Meng Xinghai sighed, “How is this expanding a new path? It’s more like a path of free will.”

Both stared blankly. Everyone’s Tianguang Jin was different; the paths it flowed through would likely also be different. How could they imitate it then?

“This ancient scripture is too mysterious, too abstruse, one can’t even learn from others!” Old Li Qingyun sighed to the sky, helpless and somewhat disheartened. The hope he had just seen was quickly extinguished, which was incredibly frustrating.

Qin Ming said, “It’s not mysterious. Where’s the difficulty? You can also expand it at will, try the path of free will.”

“Don’t speak, let me be quiet.” Li Qingyun really wanted to hit him. What path of free will? Who would dare to try that casually? One wrong move could severely injure oneself.

Qin Ming pondered that perhaps the Tianguang Jin cultivated from the silk scroll art was incredibly compatible with him, allowing him to keenly control it and advance along paths that made him feel light and clear, acting on his subjective will.

If that were the case, he couldn't help others.

Qin Ming said, “This cultivation method is indeed extraordinary. It can enhance talent and prolong life, making it a priceless treasure. But there’s no need to overly praise ancient methods. I think, in terms of offense, it should be far inferior to Heaven-Propping Energy.”

“Besides the outline, there are some specific methods later on, which should be very useful to you. Their value is greater than ordinary profound arts.” Li Qingyun left, looking at Qin Ming with a very complex expression before he departed.

“Why did Senior Li have that expression?” Qin Ming watched his gradually disappearing back, feeling somewhat puzzled.

“He was startled,” Meng Xinghai chuckled.

Then, he dropped his smile and said, “Before coming, he viewed you as Qingyue’s future Jade Armor Guard, Divine Armor Guard, her primary protector. After all, he had heard of your extraordinariness, but upon arriving here, your performance far exceeded his expectations. It’s on par with some patriarch-level figures’ performance in their youth on the Variant Path. For example, the patriarchs of the Five Element Palace, Yin-Yang Temple, and Pure Yang Palace only comprehended a part of that scripture.”

Qin Ming’s expression subtly changed. He had sworn that his bitter cultivation was not to be someone’s follower.

Meng Xinghai said, “Don’t rush, he means no harm. He just believes that this Variant Path truly offers no hope. Patriarch-level figures like Qingtian and Liu Yu also relied on time to slowly elevate their realms. This path is difficult, becoming harder the further you go.”

Then, Meng Xinghai laughed, “Your current state has absolutely stunned him. It’s as if a young patriarch is lying dormant…”

He then sighed, “Your performance today also greatly surprised me.”

Qin Ming shook his head, “What is this achievement of mine? In the struggle for near-immortal items, during the core disciples’ battle, I couldn't even participate. Though peers, I stood by like a grunt and watched. At the subsequent banquet, those Outer Realm disciples and people from the Esoteric Sect, weren't they all exceptional? Their cultivation was extremely profound. They weren't much older than me; some had already reached high grand realms, considered seeds of near-immortals. Not to mention others, just Cui Chonghe, who failed twice in possession, if you think about it, he’s terrifying. He’s my age, what level is he at now? His defeat was just a mishap, unexpectedly exposed by Qingyue’s spirit eyes.”

Meng Xinghai looked at him and said, “You call yourself a grunt? You just started on the path later, don’t belittle yourself. You’ll forge a patriarch’s path eventually.”

Qin Ming said, “Being behind is a fact. Some are much younger than me but are already higher in cultivation than I am now. I still need to work extremely hard.”

Meng Xinghai said, “Your gaze is set on other paths, comparing yourself to opponents on different paths, aren’t you?”

Qin Ming nodded, “Yes, other paths are unfathomable. The Outer Realm casually places a scripture that is highly valued on our path out there, available for outsiders to view for a price. This shows they don’t value it much; their own foundations far exceed our imagination.”

Qin Ming felt that the people of the Outer Realm must have gained greater harvests deep within the Night Mist World during the Great Genesis Era.

Meng Xinghai knew this; it was indeed true.

Subsequently, he thought of the grand examination, which had reached a critical stage, and asked, “Have you decided where you want to go? I have great confidence in you and am waiting to see you forge a patriarch’s path.”
