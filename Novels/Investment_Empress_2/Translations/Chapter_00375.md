# Chapter 375: Lost Fragments of Beauty, the Li Family's Tribunal!

"When did he leave?"

Ying Bing sat up. The space beside her was empty. She looked at the room, bathed in the morning light, so brilliant it was almost blinding.

It must be well past noon.

She knew that Li Mo had entered her dreams last night.

In fact, she had woken up while Li Mo was painting her, but facing those hazy, beautiful memories buried in the dust, she subconsciously deceived herself.

Now, the haziness of her memories had been wiped away, and everything from the dream appeared vividly before her eyes.

The way he seriously tricked her into calling him "Big Brother."

The Disaster Beast that came to their door ten years ago.

And the look of relief and joy in her parents' eyes as they faded away.

"Six Orifices of the Divine View..."

Ying Bing discovered that her cultivation level had increased, yet it didn't feel like a cause for wild joy.

She sat at the tea table, bathed in sunlight, and brewed a cup of clear tea, quietly gazing at her reflection in the water.

Her clear, phoenix eyes were slightly red, filled with a trace of confusion.

*Herself.*

*She seemed... different?*

In the past, her childhood memories had always been vague, but at this moment, those memories were vivid.

Moreover, the words her parents spoke in the dream before it vanished显然 had exceeded the scope of what should exist within a dream...

A flurry of thoughts flashed through her mind, but she couldn't figure out whether this was due to her rebirth or something else.

After a long while, Ying Bing picked up her tea cup and took a light sip.

The words her parents had spoken in the dream surfaced in her mind.

*'Dreams eventually wake. Let it be a beautiful one.'*

After drinking the tea, Ying Bing returned to the bedside and crouched down.

Under the bed was a box she had forgotten for a long time, left there all this time.

The box was covered in thick dust and wasn't locked.

"I remember now."

"I wasn't always alone on my birthdays, at least... not when I was in the Li Mansion."

"Long, long ago, I received a gift for every birthday."

*Click—*

The box opened. The dust caused ripples in the dazzling sunlight.

A cloth doll... a rattle drum... a silver bell... inside were all things a little girl would like.

These lost fragments of beauty, after so many years, were once again dyed with the warmth of sunlight.

"Every birthday when I was little, he would give me a gift."

Ying Bing's eyes lowered, her eyebrows softening, making her face shine even more with a radiant beauty.

......

Meanwhile.

In the main hall of the Li family, a tribunal was in session!

Li Dalong sat at the dining table, holding a steamed roll in his hand and taking a sip of winter melon and pork rib soup. His serious expression made him look exactly like a fair and upright judge.

Madam Xueqin stood with her arms crossed. The usually gentle woman was rarely like this, looking at her precious son with scrutinizing eyes.

"Gulp..."

The "criminal," Li Mo, swallowed his saliva.

This kind of formation hadn't appeared for a long time.

His parents' education of him had never been particularly strict. It was a happy education; they never suppressed his nature, which led to Little Li's childhood being quite... disliked by people and dogs alike.

When he really made a mistake, like writing tally marks on the teacher's face, his father, Li Dalong, would step in, spank his butt, play the "bad cop," and then have his mother come comfort him, gently telling him not to do it again.

The combination of "good cop" and "bad cop," the carrot and stick approach to leave a lasting impression, usually resolved the issue.

The Li family rarely had the "husband and wife mixed martial arts" routine; it could be counted on one's fingers. The last time was when Li Mo was ten and stole money from home to buy a tobacco pipe to see what smoking was like...

*Bang—*

"Criminal!"

Brother Dalong slammed the steamed roll onto the table like a gavel and said solemnly:

"Do you admit your guilt and accept punishment!"

"Dad, why are you acting like you're interrogating a prisoner..."

"Be serious, I'm interrogating you. Don't call me Dad. If what you did is confirmed, I won't rule out the possibility of sacrificing you for the greater good!"

Normally, if their son had his eye on a girl, the parents' first reaction would be happiness.

But Little Bing'er is different.

She was entrusted to the Li family by the Ying couple before they died. They see her as their own daughter. It would be a good thing if the two kids got together, strengthening the family bond, but that's only under legitimate circumstances.

"It's just..."

Little Li, the criminal, wanted to argue a bit, but facing his parents' scrutinizing eyes, he became guilty and said:

"Just... dual cultivation, having a shared dream or something..."

"What thing?"

"Dual cultivation?!"

Li Dalong and Gu Xueqin widened their eyes.

Seeing their reaction, Li Mo knew they had definitely gotten the wrong idea, but it wasn't their fault. The term usually appears in the context of "flower-picking" bandits. His father had caught several who practiced "dual cultivation" martial arts that involved stealing yin to supplement yang.

"Not the kind you're thinking of..."

"I don't care what kind. Guards! Drag him out and give him fifty strokes!"

"Mom, Dad, it's a spiritual exchange, a harmony of wills and souls, you get it? Oh, you're a bit far from the Divine View realm, so you might not understand this aspect..."

"????"

"Wife, he's disrupting the court. Should we add another fifty strokes?"

The scene was chaotic for a moment.

But it quieted down instantly.

Li Mo turned around and saw Bing'er crossing the threshold of the main hall. Her eyes seemed slightly red, and her black hair wasn't tied up.

The usually cold and aloof Bing'er looked a bit tired today, like a beautiful cat that had just woken up.

Li Mo试探着 asked: "How did you sleep last night?"

"Mm... it was a beautiful dream."

Ying Bing thought for a moment and noticed the unnatural look on Little Li's face. He was worried about whether she remembered what happened in the dream.

She slightly furrowed her delicate brows:

"But, you lied to me last night. You're a bad person."

"???"

Li Mo's suspended heart finally died.

Bing'er remembered after all.

And now it wasn't even a matter of whether she remembered or not.

He stiffly turned his head. After a moment of shock, the parental love in his parents' eyes vanished quickly.

"Execute him! Drag him out and execute him!"

"Wife, go get the rolling pin! The thickest one!"

"!!!"

Li Mo leaned back in a tactical retreat, feeling his scalp tingle.

The mighty Divine Hammer Little Tyrant, the Battle Soul that Brings Fortune to his Wife, the Fourth of the Hidden Dragons, with perfected Hardened Body cultivation and even Golden Body Invulnerability.

But as everyone knows, bloodline suppression doesn't involve pain...

He was terrified!

"Bing'er, say something!"

It wasn't like that at all!
