# Author's Note on Release!!!

Dear esteemed readers, brothers, family, and beloved ones!

This 18-year-old rookie author will officially release the novel tomorrow at 12 PM!

As of now, the book has just over 7,000 collections—a modest result, but still slightly better than my previous work, though the improvement is minimal. That said, the overall feedback has been more positive, especially since it’s gone through four rounds of recommendations.

Perhaps the genre or the book’s title and synopsis aren’t the most eye-catching, but that’s all I’ve got—I’m really terrible at naming things, damn it!

But slow and steady wins the race. Writing is all about perseverance!

Who knows? If, by some stroke of luck, you generous readers click a little more, the initial subscriptions might just exceed my expectations!

If all goes well tomorrow, there should be five chapters. And if the response is particularly good, I might even add more.

Fair warning—I don’t have a single pre-written chapter. Everything’s being written on the spot, so I won’t be able to release them all at once. But I’ll do my best to write as fast as I can.

That’s all for now. Humbly begging for your subscriptions!!!
