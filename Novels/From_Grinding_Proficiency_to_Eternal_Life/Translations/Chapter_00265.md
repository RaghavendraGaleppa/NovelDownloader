# Chapter 265: Nine Palaces and Ten Realms True Force

Before the words had fully faded, his five fingers had already clamped down on Teng Lingchuan's crown.

"Speak!"

Meeting Xu Yunfan's wolf-like gaze, Teng Lingchuan trembled all over.

"..."

*You have learned the Nine Palaces and Ten Realms True Force.*

Looking at the words "Not Yet Mastered" appearing before his eyes, Xu Yunfan looked down at Teng Lingchuan, whose eyes had rolled back and who was foaming at the mouth.

He shook his head slightly. That Elder Yin from the Nine Radiance Sect truly doted on his beloved disciple to have传授 (imparted) the complete set of the Nine Palaces and Ten Realms True Force to him.

This True Force was already considered one of the most top-tier martial arts techniques in the Great Zhou. Blood Qi flows like the Nine Palaces, and only after repeatedly tempering the Blood Qi nine times does one gain the qualification to practice it.

The systems of these major sects had long become a systematic whole, with each link tightly connected.

If one did not cultivate the Sword Pavilion's Three Foci Sword Cultivation Art, one could not practice the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art. If one did not cultivate the Nine Radiance Sect's Nine Palaces Swallowing Qi Art, one could not learn the Nine Palaces and Ten Realms True Force.

"This秘境 (Secret Realm) is truly a good place..."

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, feeling somewhat regretful as he looked at the White Jade Palace gradually filling with cracks. He wondered if there were other sects' direct disciples still within this small world Secret Realm.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back before the ruins of the White Jade Palace, the dragon scale armor leaves still trembling incessantly due to the essence and energy within the Blood Sacrifice Jade.

He looked up at the coiling dragon reliefs on the dome that were cracking apart. Fragments of jade fell like falling stars,划出 (drawing) glowing trails in the dim light.

His fingertips stroked the cold jade slip just obtained from Jiang Xu, sweeping over the strange cloud patterns on the jade slip.

"What a pity, these thousand-year warm jades."

Xu Yunfan looked at this White Jade Palace with considerable regret. Not to mention anything else, a White Jade Palace built from carved jade would be priceless outside. If the Blood Sacrifice Jade were released, it would definitely cause a bloody scramble,吸他人血气强自身体魄 (sucking others' Blood Qi to strengthen one's own physique).

Xu Yunfan was certain that the vast majority of martial artists absolutely could not resist the temptation in their hearts.

He raised his foot and crushed a fragment of a pillar that had rolled to his side.青烟 (Green smoke) rose from the cracks.

If he could obtain all the top martial arts for each realm related to the Six Great Sects, and plow through them all, he would surely be able to be like the Sword Pavilion's once-in-a-millennium Sword Bones, the Heavenly Sword Lone Nine, and suppress all the martial artists in the world so they couldn't lift their heads.

But Xu Yunfan's heart wasn't in that. Having personally witnessed two cultivators, he understood that immortals existed in this world. He had completely lost interest in worldly fame and fortune, or being number one in the martial path.

Cultivation!

Longevity!

If it were half a month ago, he would have踏遍 (traversed) the Secret Realm to搜罗 (collect) the various sects' sect-guarding ultimate techniques, just like when he obtained the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Art. He would use Primordial Qi to penetrate the Three Foci meridians, making the Sword Bones that the Sword Pavilion found once in a hundred years become mere stepping stones.

But when he saw the various techniques Jiang Xu施展 (displayed), that terror that transcended martial arts understanding, it instead ignited the longing deep within his soul.

For now, he had to find a way to raise his strength to the Refining Organs realm.

This small world Secret Realm had rich spiritual energy. Although the spiritual energy was abundant because it gathered according to the mountain's terrain, it was still far, far better than the meager, wandering spiritual energy outside.

Suddenly, his gaze shifted as he looked towards the distance.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning, instantly locking onto the rolling dust rising from a distant mountain depression.

Just a breath later, as the ground began to tremble, a dark shadow rushed from the valley floor. Wherever it passed, withered grass and trees, and crumbling rock walls—it was actually a group of bloodthirsty demons attracted by the thick Blood Qi on his body.

The leading demon resembled a giant ape but had three ferocious heads. The central head was covered in green scales, with fangs protruding. The two side heads were one red and one black. The red head spewed poisonous fire, while the black head's roar shattered rocks with sound waves.

Its body stood five zhang tall, with bone spurs protruding from its spine. Its limbs were entangled with腐化 (decaying) sinews like chains. Every step it took left a焦黑 (scorched black) imprint on the ground.

Behind the demon ape, a tide-like wave of low-level demons surged forward, howling.

There were "Ghost-Faced Moths" with wings like blades and human faces on their bellies; "Rotting Corpse Toads" covered in pus-filled包 (bumps) with wriggling tentacles; and hundreds of "Blood-Eyed Spider Wolves," their eight legs like spears, spraying spider webs that粘 (stuck) the flying moths in the air into blood cocoons...

The乌泱泱 (dark and crowded) group of demons squeezed together, their煞气 (killing intent) soaring to the sky,染 (dyeing) the originally clear sky of the Secret Realm into a dark purple almost from afar.

The only slightly troublesome thing was that the longer these demons stayed in the small world Secret Realm, the higher their attack frequency would become.

He had already been in this Secret Realm for almost two months.

Xu Yunfan raised his head. At this moment, the number of demons had exceeded a hundred, but instead of retreating, he reached behind him and slowly drew out the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer that had been silent for a long time.

The moment the hammer body left its sheath, the surrounding sky shook and exploded.

As his劲力 (force) burst forth, the patterns on the hammer head erupted with紫红 (purple-red)雷火 (thunderfire), and the patterns缠绕 (wound) around the hammer handle hummed and trembled.

Xu Yunfan exerted force with his feet, the ground beneath him collapsed with a轰然 (rumbling) sound, and his figure shot like a cannonball into the group of demons.

While in mid-air, the hammer was already swung round, and a move called "River of Stars Falling to the Earth" descended fiercely.

"BOOM!"

The hammer wind,裹挟 (enveloping) the thunderfire, transformed into a purple-red light wheel three zhang in diameter and swept out.

The dozens of Blood-Eyed Spider Wolves at the forefront instantly碳化 (carbonized). The Ghost-Faced Moths had their wings shredded by the thunder force. The Rotting Corpse Toads' pus包 (bumps) burst, and their poisonous liquid splashed back, corroding their own kind.

Xu Yunfan's attack did not stop. The hammer's momentum shifted, and the "Wave-Crushing Mountain Break" from the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art followed closely. The影 (shadows) of the hammer were like collapsing mountains,硬生生 (forcefully) smashing the poisonous fire and sound waves spat out by the three-headed demon ape back into its mouth!

The demon ape howled in pain and retreated violently, blood trickling from the corners of the mouths of its three heads, but this only激 (stimulated) its ferocity.

It pounded its chest fiercely, the chain-like sinews suddenly tightening, actually pulling nine腐朽 (decaying) martial artist corpses from the ground. The corpses,缠绕 (entwined) with demonic energy, pounced towards Xu Yunfan.

At the same time, the fire pillar spewed by the red head and the sound wave roared by the black head merged, turning into a赤黑 (red-black) torrent. Wherever it passed, even rocks turned to powder!

Xu Yunfan's gaze was cold and sharp, without the slightest fluctuation. The sword force from the Three Foci meridians within his body suddenly turned.

Although the Red Serpent Mountain-Shaking Force within his body was like a惊涛 (stormy) sea, he had to admit that the sword force cultivated by the Three Foci Sword Cultivation Art was qualitatively much better than the Red Serpent Mountain-Shaking Force.

Upper Foci sword qi breaks evil, Middle Foci melts iron to forge form, Lower Foci spirals to temper the edge.

Three-colored sword qi surged from his mouth and nose,凝聚 (condensing) into a spiral sword aura at the hammer's edge.

He took a step forward,人锤合一 (man and hammer as one), and crashed down迎 (meeting) the torrent!

"CHING!"

The explosion from the collision of sword force and demonic killing intent撕裂 (tore) the air.

The demon ape's red-black torrent was shredded inch by inch by the sword aura, and the余波 (shockwave) even斩断 (severed) the demons pouncing from the side in half.

Xu Yunfan seized the opportunity to advance, the hammer影 (shadows) pouring down like a暴雨 (downpour), each strike accompanied by the explosion of thunderfire.

The demon ape's bone spurs shattered, its scales翻卷 (turned back), and finally, its central head was smashed to pieces by a hammer blow. The remaining two heads were still trying to struggle, but Xu Yunfan's left hand formed two fingers like a sword, and a strand of sword force from the Three Foci Sword Cultivation Art pierced into its brow, causing the skull to instantly爆裂 (explode)!

The group of demons, seeing this, actually paused for a moment.

How could Xu Yunfan miss this timing.

He took a deep breath,金髓 (golden marrow) surged, and the spiritual energy of the Secret Realm疯狂 (frenziedly) poured in from his mouth and nose into the Three Foci, rapidly turning into sword force. His sword momentum actually increased by another three points.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was raised high above his head...

"ROAR!"

The moment the hammer fell, purple-red thunderfire spread and surged out. Wherever it passed, the demons all turned into焦炭 (charcoal).

The shockwave swept through half the mountain depression. Of the more than a hundred demons, fewer than one in ten remained.残肢断臂 (Severed limbs and broken arms) mixed with the焦臭 (scorched stench) filled the valley.
