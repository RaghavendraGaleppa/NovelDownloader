# Chapter 149: Multiverse Auction House  

With a flash of vision, Zhang Jing found himself back in the room he had previously arranged as his cultivation chamber in the lower realm. Although he had been away for over two years, everything inside remained exactly as he had left it.  

With a thought, a line of text appeared before his eyes:  

**[Zhang Jing (Disciple of the Chiming Taihao Cave Heaven): 2,299,990 Luck Points]**  

"So, Master's Chiming Taihao Cave Heaven indeed grants one million Luck Points annually," Zhang Jing murmured, a faint smile playing on his lips.  

Rising to his feet, he turned his gaze toward the room's door.  

"Beyond this door must be the true Radiance Immortal Realm," he mused.  

Creak—  

The wooden door slowly swung open.  

Zhang Jing peered outside. He appeared to be standing atop a towering mountain peak, with thick clouds obscuring his view ahead. A rugged path stretched before the door.  

Simultaneously, a stream of information flooded his mind:  

**Current Location:** Chiming Taihao Immortal Mountain  
**Teleportation Permissions:** Activated  
**Accessible Areas:**  
- Dao Treasury Secret Realm  
- Shangyuan Qingjing Immortal Mountain  
- Multiverse Auction House  
- Secret Realm Mission Hall  
- Azure Sky Immortal City  
- Yellow Sand Immortal City  
- East Sea Immortal Palace  
- Evergreen Immortal City  

Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed slightly. With the heightened perception of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he swiftly scanned through the countless names and quickly located the Multiverse Auction House mentioned by Senior Brother Xuan.  

"To the Multiverse Auction House!"  

Connecting with the Radiance Immortal Realm through his thoughts, Zhang Jing's figure vanished in an instant.  

---  

A pure white room, no more than ten zhang in length and width, materialized around him. As Zhang Jing appeared, the pristine whiteness of the space began to fade rapidly, replaced by a dazzling display of countless treasure listings and rapidly updating auction prices. Each item bore a countdown timer.  

"What is this?" Zhang Jing muttered, puzzled as he surveyed his surroundings.  

Just then, a sweet voice chimed in:  

"Honored guest, welcome to the Multiverse Auction House. How may I assist you?"  

Transparent ripples shimmered in the space before him. From within, a graceful figure emerged.  

At the sight of her, Zhang Jing couldn't help but show a flicker of surprise.  

Her features were indistinguishable from a human's—exquisitely refined, radiating a natural harmony. Her emerald-green pupils complemented her verdant hair, lending her a playful charm.  

Two pairs of translucent jade-green wings adorned her back, intricately patterned as if carved from the finest imperial jade by a master artisan.  

"Honored guest?" the peculiar woman called softly as she approached.  

"You're not human, are you?" Zhang Jing stated with certainty.  

It wasn't just her appearance—though many cultivators, especially those beyond the Foundation Establishment stage, often bore bizarre features. What set her apart was the absence of the innate aura unique to humans.  

"Reporting to the honored guest, Yari is a Nature Spirit, not human," the woman replied honestly.  

Zhang Jing nodded in understanding.  

So this was a Nature Spirit?  

Meanwhile, Yari smiled sweetly and asked again, "Honored guest, how may Yari be of service?"  

Zhang Jing's expression turned serious. "I wish to sell some items here. How does the process work? And how do I participate in bidding?"  

Yari extended a jade-green key shimmering with golden light and explained, "It seems this is your first visit. You may first refine this jade key, which will allow you to communicate with the Multiverse Auction House."  

"To sell treasures, simply present them and set a starting price and an instant-purchase price. To buy, submit your request directly to the auction house."  

"Communicate with the Multiverse Auction House?" Zhang Jing murmured, finding the process oddly familiar.  

Without hesitation, he attempted to connect with the so-called auction house.  

A chaotic Dao Mark materialized on his forehead.  

In an instant, Zhang Jing successfully linked with a vast consciousness. Guided by it, he retrieved the three drops of Longevity Rejuvenation Elixir he had brought. Recalling Senior Brother Xuan's earlier advice on pricing, he set a starting bid of 250,000 Luck Points per drop and an instant-purchase price of 350,000.  

The elixir vanished from his hand the next moment.  

Simultaneously, the auction listings for the three drops appeared before him.  

Barely listed, they already attracted numerous bids, swiftly driving the prices close to the instant-purchase threshold.  

---  

**True Ascension Treasure Peak Heaven**  

Within the majestic Nine Dragons Immortal City, an ornate pavilion stood at its heart, its dazzling radiance rivaling the sun itself. Yet, despite its grandeur, not a single passing cultivator dared entertain greed—not even a Unity Realm True Immortal.  

The reason?  

The inscription above its entrance: **Multiverse Auction House!**  

Though seemingly modest from the outside, the auction house's interior defied spatial limits, vast beyond measure.  

At that moment, in one of its thousand-zhang-wide halls, tens of thousands of cultivators stared intently at their jade-green tokens, faces taut with tension.  

Suddenly—  

"Someone's auctioning life-extending treasures! Longevity Rejuvenation Elixir—three drops, each extending lifespan by thirty years! Starting bid: 250,000 Luck Points. Instant purchase: 350,000!" a cultivator exclaimed.  

The hall erupted into a flurry of activity as everyone scrambled to search for the listing.  

Among them, a youthful-looking boy, no older than seventeen or eighteen, frantically scrolled through his token, hope flickering in his eyes.  

"Grandfather, hold on! Someone's selling life-extending treasures!" he whispered urgently.  

Within moments, he found the elixir listing.  

After a brief glance at the auction house's description, the boy winced at the price but didn't hesitate. He selected the lowest-priced drop and submitted the instant-purchase offer.  

He was shrewd—he didn't try to bid incrementally or snatch all three drops. He knew just how many eyes were fixed on these treasures.  

Sure enough, the moment his purchase succeeded, the remaining two drops were instantly bought out at the instant-purchase price.  

A chorus of sighs filled the hall.  

---  

Back in the auction room, Zhang Jing stared in astonishment.  

The three drops he had just listed had barely slowed near the instant-purchase price before all were snapped up at 350,000.  

"Are life-extending treasures really this sought after?" he muttered.  

Judging by the frenzy, the prices Senior Brother Xuan had suggested seemed... conservative.  

"Senior Brother Xuan, you've misled me!" Zhang Jing chuckled wryly.  

Turning his head, he noticed Yari, the Nature Spirit, clutching her jade key and staring at him—or more precisely, at the chaotic Dao Mark on his forehead—with wide-eyed surprise.  

"Honored guest... are you a Cave Heaven disciple of the Supreme Unity Infinite Immortal Sect?"
