# Chapter 5: Official Status, the Immortal Seedlings' Astonishment

After his breakthrough, Qi Chuan immediately reported it.

"Qi Chuan, having reached the first level of Qi Refinement, you are now officially granted status. Additionally, you will receive a token, a set of robes, and two spirit stones," said a middle-aged man dressed in the attire of a steward the next day, standing on a flat area of the Red Dust Peak. He smiled as he spoke.

The steward had been dispatched by the family. Any immortal seedling who reached the first level of Qi Refinement would receive such treatment.

"Thank you, Steward," Qi Chuan said, cupping his hands in respect before stepping forward to receive the items with both hands.

The token was entirely red like jade, adorned with natural wood grain patterns. It was made from the renowned Red Maple Wood of the Red Maple Valley. On the front was carved the undulating outline of the valley, with clouds floating above and a "Qi" character encircled by them. The back bore the characters "Qi Chuan," along with a line of smaller text stating that he was a member of the Qi family and that any harm done to him would be severely punished.

This was the Qi family's identity token. With it, one was truly considered a member of the Qi family's main lineage, under their protection, and entitled to an annual stipend of two low-grade spirit stones.

The standard-issue robes resembled the Taoist robes of his previous life, with several red maple leaves embroidered on the sleeves—natural and exquisite. Enhanced by formations, they could adjust in size to some extent, repel dust and water, ward off insects, and offer protection.

The two low-grade spirit stones were square, about the size of a fingernail. Upon holding them, one could immediately sense the spiritual energy within—they were the universal currency of the cultivation world.

Clothes make the man. Once Qi Chuan donned the robes and stood tall, his demeanor transformed completely. He now truly resembled a disciple of a cultivation family, a far cry from his previous appearance in fine garments.

Nearby, the other immortal seedlings emerged from their tiled houses, their gazes turning toward him with undisguised envy.

"I never expected Qi Chuan to reach the first level of Qi Refinement so quickly."

"It's only been a month, hasn't it?"

"No wonder he has an eighth-grade spiritual root. It's not something our ninth-grade roots can compare to."

The immortal seedlings sighed inwardly. They had all undergone spirit root testing on the same day as Qi Chuan, joined the main lineage, and received their cultivation techniques. Yet while they were still struggling with their cultivation, Qi Chuan had already broken through and gained official status.

Was the difference between just one grade really this stark?

"No need for thanks, Qi Chuan. Even the Transmission Elder was surprised by how quickly you broke through. However, each level of Qi Refinement becomes progressively harder, with several bottlenecks that have stymied many family cultivators. Keep working hard, and you might achieve something in the future," the steward said encouragingly after presenting the items, then took his leave.

Qi Chuan placed a hand over his chest, feeling the token and spirit stones beneath his robes, a sense of satisfaction and security settling in his heart.

With his official status came an additional layer of protection. He could now begin accessing some of the family's resources to accelerate his cultivation.

As he pondered this, another figure approached from the foot of the mountain.

"The steward just left. Who could this be?" Qi Chuan wondered.

Before he could dwell on it, the newcomer arrived at the peak—a handsome elderly man with graying hair, his face weathered, giving off an air of twilight years. Yet within his tired eyes flickered a glimmer of anticipation.

"Which one of you is Qi Chuan?" the old man called out, slightly out of breath as he scanned the group.

"That would be me," Qi Chuan replied, stepping forward. The man was here for him—could it be...?

"You're Qi Chuan? I'm your grandfather!" The old man's eyes lit up as they landed on Qi Chuan, his voice booming.

The nearby immortal seedlings stared in astonishment.

Qi Chuan's lips twitched as he stepped forward to perform a junior's salute. "Qi Chuan greets Second Grandfather. Has Second Grandfather received Uncle's letter?"

"Indeed! Ah-Chuan, I'm your second grandfather! I just returned from a mission and received the letter, which is why I came to find you."

Qi Bai Cang accepted Qi Chuan's salute with satisfaction, patting his shoulder cheerfully. "I, Qi Bai Cang, entered the main lineage at the age of ten and have been adrift for over fifty years. Now, at last, I have a descendant—what joy!"

As he finished speaking, his belated gaze fell upon Qi Chuan's robes, and his expression froze momentarily in surprise. "These are the family's bestowed robes... Ah-Chuan, you've already reached the first level of Qi Refinement?"

"Yes, Second Grandfather. I just broke through," Qi Chuan nodded.

"So quickly? It's only been a month since the Spirit Root Testing Ceremony! Good... good! Hahaha!" Qi Bai Cang calculated the time and grew even more delighted. "What grade is your spiritual root?"

Given the speed of his breakthrough, his spiritual root must be quite good.

"Lower eighth-grade," Qi Chuan replied.

"Eighth-grade, huh..." Qi Bai Cang was somewhat taken aback—this wasn't what he had expected. "Then you must be highly compatible with the Evergreen Art to have broken through so swiftly. And an eighth-grade spiritual root is already quite good. Your second grandfather here only has a lower ninth-grade root."

After chatting for a while and learning more, Qi Bai Cang glanced around the Red Dust Peak and made a suggestion. "Come with me. Now that you've reached the first level of Qi Refinement and have official status, there's no need to stay here any longer. Though my cultivation isn't much to speak of, I do have my own mountain."

"Of course," Qi Chuan agreed readily. A private mountain was undoubtedly better than the Red Dust Peak.

---

Thus, Qi Chuan bid farewell to the other immortal seedlings and, under their watchful eyes, left the Red Dust Peak with his second grandfather.

Before long, they arrived at an unremarkable mountain, its appearance somewhat chaotic. A few simple houses were scattered across the peak, and some spirit fields had been haphazardly cultivated with unknown crops.

"I built all these houses myself. I'll tidy up one for you. From now on, we grandfather and grandson will live here undisturbed," Qi Bai Cang said cheerfully.

Surveying the wild and disorderly state of the mountain, Qi Chuan was momentarily speechless. If not for the fact that the spiritual energy here was slightly richer than that of the Red Dust Peak, he might not have wanted to move at all. Still, having a private mountain was indeed preferable—especially the peace and freedom it offered.

Soon, Qi Bai Cang prepared a room for Qi Chuan to settle in. Not long after, he prepared a lavish dinner and invited Qi Chuan to join him.

"Ah-Chuan, eat to your heart's content. Many of these ingredients contain trace amounts of spiritual energy. I just returned from transporting goods for the Murong family and made a small profit—I can afford this much," Qi Bai Cang said with a wave.

"The Murong family?" Qi Chuan looked up.

Qi Bai Cang nodded. "Another cultivation family. They're on good terms with our Qi family, though they're not nearby. My cultivation is weak, so I only participated in the transportation this time."

"Second Grandfather, are there many cultivation families like ours?" Qi Chuan asked curiously.

"Quite a few. The Murong family, the Ye family, the Xiao family... including our Qi family—all have Foundation Establishment ancestors presiding over them. Beyond that, there are smaller or declining families barely held together by late or even mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators."

"However, all the families in this region are under the rule of the Wind Moon Sect, living at their mercy!"
