# Chapter 133: Han Zhen Appears, Grand Shang Imperial Preceptor?!

Within the Secret Realm, a violent gale howled, and a terrifying aura descended from the heavens.

In the ethereal void, it seemed as though the weeping of phoenixes echoed between heaven and earth.

A vast, primordial scene pressed down as if it were real.

A bronze divine tree seemed to float in the void, ancient and profound, transcending time and space, possessing an infinite, vast cycle of life and death.

Perched upon it were Phoenixes, Luan birds, Golden Crows, Vermilion Birds, and Black Birds... vivid and lifelike, each radiating the aura of a ruler of their own domain.

It was merely an illusion.

Yet it seemed capable of suppressing the entire world.

"The Divine Bronze Tree."

"The Destiny Artifact of the Great Shang?"

The scene flashed through Li Mo's mind, recalling fragments he had read in the *Chronicles of Divine Forms*.

He looked at the girl's back, knowing he could not disturb her right now.

"Junior Brother Xiao Bao."

"Hmm?"

"Be ready to act on opportunity."

Ying Bing's jade-like face was slightly pale.

The Seventh Realm was, after all, the Seventh Realm.

Regardless of how one achieved the status of a Martial Saint, they possess a self-contained inner world within their body. They can traverse the void with their physical body, roaming tens of thousands of miles. A casual strike can submerge a thousand miles of land, resembling a humanoid natural disaster.

Her speculation was correct.

This Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was not a secret realm at all.

It was the inner world of a Master of the Profound Sage realm.

However, compared to a true Master of the Profound's inner world, it appeared dilapidated and desolate.

*Hum—*

On the illusion of the Divine Bronze Tree, a divine bird cast its gaze down.

It seemed to want to force this ignorant young girl into submission.

Ying Bing met its gaze calmly.

Her other foot stepped onto the end of the staircase.

In an instant.

All the divine birds perched on the Divine Bronze Tree looked over coldly.

Scorching, freezing, eerie—various immense and unmatched divine intents pressed down upon her.

Thousands of pressures descended upon her body.

Ying Bing's black hair danced wildly, her face like frost under the moon.

"Just a mere incomplete illusion."

"Even if your true form descended, you should kneel upon seeing me."

A multicolored radiance circulated around Ying Bing, accompanied by the aura of the Great Yin.

The two intertwined, as if the sun and moon followed her, reflecting off each other and releasing countless beams of light.

Xuandan Realm.

And it was two Xuandans formed simultaneously.

Upon closer inspection, each one seemed to contain a strange rhythm flowing within.

The girl was set off even more, appearing crystalline like jade, becoming the sole light before the dark, bronze great hall.

"Back down."

Her figure remained small.

But wherever she walked, the illusion of the Divine Bronze Tree receded like the tide.

After taking just two steps.

Ying Bing's ears twitched slightly.

She heard a set of footsteps following behind her.

It wasn't Tang Xiao Bao.

It was him.

He... was truly strange.

Ying Bing couldn't help but recall the scene on the Ascension Stone Steps.

It seemed that regardless of the type of pressure, it was as if it were void to that少年.

Although the divine form of this Divine Bronze Tree was not complete, the will within it was not something that the Internal Breath realm or even the Observation of the Divine realm could withstand.

Yet Li Mo walked up casually, as if taking a stroll in a garden.

For some reason.

At this critical moment, having him follow behind her gave her a sense of reassurance...

"Now is not the time for such thoughts."

A distance of several dozen meters.

The two had already stood at the entrance of the palace.

This palace was clearly broader and more imposing than the ones below.

A plaque still bore characters written upon it:

'Palace of Facing the Heavens'

"These tricks can be stopped now."

"Come out."

Ying Bing narrowed her eyes, looking at the palace entrance, her tone leaving no room for doubt.

The front of the palace was empty, with no stone stele present.

As Ying Bing's words fell.

---

*Rumble—*

The thick, tall doors of the Palace of Facing the Heavens slowly opened.

Li Mo looked inside, but found it deep and dark, impossible to see clearly.

*Whoosh—*

Suddenly.

Two lamp flames lit up, and then, as if in a chain reaction, the lights further inside ignited rapidly, resembling two lines of fire.

Inside this magnificent palace, the furnishings were exquisite and solemn.

And although the various objects were ancient in appearance, they were all spotless and new.

The ground was etched with patterns like spiderwebs, forming a formation.

In the center of the formation.

A pale golden, jade-like skeleton sat in a meditative posture, its hollow eye sockets gazing at the heavens, as if questioning the unfairness of the heavens.

Even though it had been dead for an unknown amount of time.

It still exuded an supreme aura.

"This is the corpse of that Master of the Profound?"

Li Mo was somewhat confused.

The focal point of the secret realm was the burial place of this Master of the Profound powerhouse?

He glanced at Ying Bing, but found that the Ice Cube's gaze was fixed on the depths of the darkness.

"This is my remains, or rather... the me of the past."

Abruptly, a voice echoed幽幽ly within the palace.

"It's you?"

Li Mo's eyebrows raised, and he became alert.

He had seen this blood-robed youth before.

The one who came with the Red Whale Gang during the Nine Peaks Tournament.

He had intended to use the Eye of Fate to observe him back then, but due to a coincidence, he hadn't seen him.

Li Mo's eyes flickered with obscurity, activating the Divine Eye.

【Name: Han Zhen】

【Age: 22 (5330)】

【Bone Structure: Blood Phoenix Indestructible Body.】

【Realm: Observation of the Divine, Three Apertures.】

【Destiny: Purple Gold.】

【Evaluation: Former Grand Shang Imperial Preceptor. After Yu destroyed Shang, due to possessing the Blood Phoenix Essence, he领悟ed the mystery of the Blood Phoenix Essence to a deeper level when his soul and body were about to perish, allowing him to be reborn through a surrogate. He has now been reborn seven times.】

【Recent Encounter: Seeing Ying Bing, he believes the restoration of the state is within reach, hoping to have her serve the Great Shang. To accumulate the power of the Blood Phoenix Essence, he has caused countless bloody storms.】

"Grand Shang... Imperial Preceptor?"

Li Mo understood.

It wasn't a case of sharing the same name!

This was the very author of the *Chronicles of Divine Forms*!

No wonder, ever since he stepped into the palace, he felt the karma fire within him stirring restlessly.

This man named Han Zhen had沾染了多少 blood debts.

Han Zhen stood on the steps, hands clasped behind his back.

"You are more outstanding than I imagined, more unparalleled through the ages, simply a masterpiece crafted by the heavens with its heart and soul!"

When he spoke these words, the ecstasy surging in his eyes was almost pathological.

He had witnessed everything just now, when Ying Bing resisted the Divine Bronze Tree.

Han Zhen did not possess a complete Divine Form of the Great Dao.

In the distant past, even though he possessed the Blood Phoenix Essence and transformed himself into a Blood Phoenix Indestructible Body, he could only barely condense a trace of the illusion of the Divine Bronze Tree.

But that still shouldn't have been something an Internal Breath realm could withstand.

That wasn't the point.

The most important thing was.

Han Zhen sensed an aura within this young girl that was even more noble than his own!

His Majesty, the Crown Prince, none of them compared to her.

"Please forgive the offense from earlier."

Han Zhen actually performed a salute, his gaze burning:

"I initially intended to recruit you, but I have changed my mind."

He paused, then glanced at Li Mo:

"And you, your performance just now was also passable."

This少年 also possessed his own extraordinary qualities.

Otherwise, even though most of the pressure was shared by Ying Bing, it would have been impossible to stand here.

"Are the two of you willing to join me in a grand undertaking?"

Han Zhen said solemnly.

Ying Bing's gaze remained cold throughout.

Li Mo caught a glimpse of her expression from the corner of his eye and smiled as he spoke:

"Tell us what the benefits are."

...

PS: The little failure of an author didn't get stuck on writing, it's just that this segment of the plot needs to tie up foreshadowing from earlier, so it had to be written quite carefully, hence the late update. Begging for a little support, hehe, mwah.
