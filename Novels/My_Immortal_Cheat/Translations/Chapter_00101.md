**Chapter 101: Escape**

Zhou Tian understood that Anduin must have held back his voice, likely fearing they wouldn't be able to bear it.

The Energy Construct's figure gradually approached, each step steady, as if a real person inhabited the armor.

Its metallic hand, three times larger than a normal person's, splayed open. Patterns lit up, energy converged, and a mass of pure white flame roared forth, then was molded into a ten-foot-long spear.

Although its sentience had been nearly eroded away by the long years, it could still recognize and respond to the blasphemous and evil language, and had corresponding countermeasures.

Anduin remained unmoved, his whispers growing faster. The sound seeped from the void, reverberating throughout the area. The creatures thrashed even more violently; they were merely minor evils, how could they compare to the blasphemous language, the most malevolent of all?

The Energy Construct's armor glowed brightly, runes flickering, as it pointed its spear directly at Anduin in the cage.

Anduin suddenly raised his head, his eyes pitch black, pupils vanished. A golden light ignited in his hand, and the crimson phantom behind him let out a sky-shattering roar as the golden light shot forth.

*Boom!*

Flames erupted above the cage, and white patterns appeared on the dark railings. These were seals hidden deep within the cage, normally unseen, now surfacing to reinforce it and block the penetration of divine light.

Unfortunately, if the cage's seals were at their peak, stopping a mere wisp of divinity would be effortless, but they were now struggling to hold.

The divine light penetrated the cage's seals, passed through the armor, and shot into the interior. The Energy Construct's movements froze, its entire body stiffening.

The light inside flickered erratically. Patterns and incredibly complex runes appeared on the armor covering its entire body, forming a powerful seal that trapped the internal light cluster, which had been infected by the alien god's divinity.

The Energy Construct's external armor retracted its limbs, standing firmly rooted to the spot, unable to move.

When this Energy Construct was created, its internal sentience and external armor were separated for safety. If one part malfunctioned, the other would activate a seal.

Seeing this, Anduin also closed his mouth, wiping the sweat from his brow. His voice came through: "It's done. Just wait for them to come."

In the room where Zhou Tian had been brought, the Holy Sword embedded in the Judgment Emissary's statue emitted a burst of light, projecting an image: the unmoving Energy Construct.

"What trick is that Evil God's descendant playing now?" a white-robed figure frowned. This wasn't the first time something like this had happened since the Evil God's scion was imprisoned here.

The first time it occurred, they were on high alert, but nothing came of it; the Energy Construct simply recovered after being bathed in holy light for a period.

"The Tribunal has imprisoned quite a few more culprits recently. To be safe, let's have a few Holy Knights come and check," another white-robed figure said, and the others nodded in agreement.

Inside the Tribunal, time passed minute by minute. Zhou Tian waited quietly. Suddenly, Anduin nodded at him; Zhou Tian knew their people had arrived.

Moments later, a team of glistening figures approached. Upon their arrival, Zhou Tian realized they were knights clad in golden armor, ten in total, completely enveloped by their golden suits, with longswords hanging at their waists.

The leader removed his helmet, revealing a weathered face, his brow deeply furrowed, his gaze sharp and stern.

Without hesitation, Zhou Tian instantly teleported out of the cage. Since his cage was still some distance from the actual entrance, he couldn't reach the spatial portal in a single leap.

However, Zhou Tian could already see the spatial channel. As Anduin had predicted, it was indeed a long-distance spatial pathway, guarded by two golden-armored knights.

The moment they saw Zhou Tian, they reacted, drawing their holy swords from their waists. Two sharp sword lights slashed out, emitting whistling roars. These were knights meticulously cultivated by the Holy Divine Church; each one was formidable, capable of rivaling a Dharma Idol Realm expert.

The knights behind them also reacted. The leader's expression drastically changed, and he roared, "You seek death!"

Without him even moving, a sword light slashed out, like a celestial river pouring down, grand and powerful. The rest also unleashed their sword lights. For a moment, the area glittered with light, and fierce sword qi surged. Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow, standing still.

Silently, all twelve attacks vanished, completely sealed by him. He teleported again, now just a step away from the spatial channel.

Although Zhou Tian's previous display was bizarre, the two guards were not slow. Their bodies flared with energy, they roared, and their longswords glowed as they slashed towards Zhou Tian.

"Still!" Zhou Tian lightly uttered, but it was directed at the knight lunging at him from behind. The Holy Word, enhanced by his death count, descended, and unlike that Dao Lord, the knight instantly froze in place.

With a flick of his hand, a sword light shot out. Although it only possessed 80% of its original power, the opponent was already immobilized. With a *splat*, in the knight's terrified gaze, the sword light entered his body, blood splattered, and his head was severed, rolling on the ground.

He exhaled another sword light from his mouth, forcing the knight slashing at him from mid-air to change direction.

With a flicker, Zhou Tian entered the spatial channel. The last thing that met his eyes was the furious sword strike of the leader, but it was a step too late.

Emerging from the spatial channel, the four white-robed figures outside simultaneously changed expressions. Holy flames surged, all striking towards him, but he was already prepared.

He unleashed a thick sword light, this being the Knight Captain's sword light, accompanied by several other sword lights.

*Boom!*

A violent collision, shockwaves rippling. The four combined to block the sword light. As the dust settled, Zhou Tian's figure had already vanished. The four's expressions were exceedingly grim.

Zhou Tian instantly teleported upwards to his limit, appearing in mid-air. Looking down, it was the cluster of spired buildings where he had been imprisoned. Though array formations were laid, they couldn't stop Zhou Tian from leaving.

Before that so-called Pope could react, Zhou Tian randomly chose a direction, flickered to the ground, and walked away.

Moments later, a burst of light emanated from the central grand cathedral. A towering humanoid phantom, hundreds of zhang tall, appeared, crowned with a laurel wreath. Waves of prayers resonated, imbued with profound holiness. Its gaze swept across the entire city of Sael, but found nothing.

Zhou Tian had already left Sael City via teleportation.

"Finally out," Zhou Tian's figure appeared on a small hill outside Sael City. He twisted his waist, sat down on the grass, and took out the blood-stained silk cloth from his embrace.

"Now, I just have to wait for that guy's followers to come find me."

Zhou Tian thought for a moment, then teleported further away. This place still felt too close.

He found a cave, entered it, and quietly waited.
