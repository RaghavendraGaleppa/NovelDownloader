# Chapter 225: The Spiritual Land Takes Shape

The City Lord's Estate.

Within the vast outer courtyard.

Pavilions and towers, green bricks and dark tiles, with every step revealing a new vista.
The scene overflowed with the vibrancy of spiritual energy.
Small mountains and exotic stones were artfully scattered, subtly forming a miraculous array that gathered the boundless immortal spiritual energy from the surrounding region.

At various spots throughout the courtyard, tables were laden with immortal fruits, rare delicacies, immortal tea, and spiritual wine, as if they were of no value.
Teams of beautiful, pretty-faced maidservants weaved gracefully among them.

As time passed, the tables gradually filled with cultivators of varied attire—men and women, old and young. The only commonality among them was that their cultivation bases were at least at the Foundation Establishment realm.

At this moment, nearly everyone's attention was fixed on the straight path in the center of the courtyard. From time to time, a figure exuding a powerful aura would walk along it, heading directly into the inner court, sparking endless discussions among the onlookers.

"That's President Shi of the Flying Dragon Demon Hunt Association!"
"And Pavilion Master You of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion!"
"The Rime Wind Sword Immortal of the Winter Imbibing Pavilion!"
"Young Master Yu of the Azure Spirit Pavilion!"
"..."
"Hiss—, the City Lord's Estate has actually invited all the Golden Core realm cultivators in Three Yuan City today. What an extravagant gesture!" Someone counted the formidable figures who had passed by, exclaiming in astonishment.

Immediately, another person took up the conversation. "Young City Lord has entered the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm and become a formal disciple. Isn't it only natural for the City Lord's Estate to celebrate like this? After all, he has instantly become a disciple of a legendary Immortal Dao Lineage; longevity is within reach!"

***

The inner court.

Compared to the outer courtyard, there were far fewer cultivators here, and it was much quieter.

At a table in a certain corner, Zhang Jing leaned back in his chair, his expression relaxed, as he curiously observed his surroundings. Next to him sat several Golden Core realm cultivators. Zhang Jing recognized all of them as Golden Core cultivators from the pavilions near his current location, the Azure Spirit Pavilion.

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, look." A middle-aged man in a black robe beside him nudged his chin, subtly gesturing towards three young cultivators with arrogant expressions seated on the high platform at the very front. He spoke with reverence, "Those three are said to be the Young City Lord's senior brothers whom he befriended in the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm this time. It is rumored that the two men are surnamed Wang and Nong respectively, while the female cultivator is surnamed Lan. Tsk, truly disciples from an Immortal Dao Lineage. Although we are all at the Golden Core realm, it's clear that we are not on the same level as them."

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Yu, don't belittle yourself." Zhang Jing said with a smile, attempting to comfort him.

But unexpectedly, upon hearing Zhang Jing's words, the black-robed man's expression immediately turned serious. He said earnestly, "I'm not joking. Yu once witnessed a Golden Core realm disciple from the Taiyi Dao Sect make a move. I won't hide it from you, Fellow Daoist, that might was something I might never forget in this lifetime. It was too powerful, so powerful it even exceeded Yu's understanding of the Golden Core realm."

He let out a bitter laugh. "It was only after that incident that Yu realized the disparity within the same realm, the gap between us rogue cultivators and the disciples of Immortal Dao Lineages, could be so vast and despair-inducing."

"Indeed."
"Even though we are all in the same realm, the difference is like that between clouds and mud." For a moment, the other Golden Core realm cultivators sitting beside Zhang Jing spoke with great emotion.

Beside him, seemingly noticing the indifference on Zhang Jing's face, the black-robed man kindly advised, "Fellow Daoist, your strength, which earned you the esteemed title of 'Young Master Yu' in the Azure Spirit Pavilion, is naturally evident to us all. However, one must remember the principle that 'there are always people stronger than you, and heavens beyond the heavens,' and maintain a respectful heart."

"Thank you for your guidance, Fellow Daoist. I'll remember that." Zhang Jing nodded with a smile.

Just as the few of them were conversing, two bright streaks of light suddenly whistled through the air, then gently landed on the high platform at the front.

"Haha, today is a wonderful day to celebrate my son's entry into the Taiyi Immeasurable Dao Sect for cultivation. Therefore, I specially host this Immortal Ascension Banquet. Everyone, please enjoy the food and drink." A hearty voice suddenly resounded in everyone's ears, carrying a faint yet terrifying pressure.

"A Dharma Idol realm cultivator?" Zhang Jing's eyes flickered, and his face instantly showed a 'sure enough' expression. He had known that Three Yuan City must have more than just the one Dharma Idol realm cultivator stationed outside Lingshu Mountain. Otherwise, how dared they covet the spiritual land of Lingshu Mountain? The other two forces, Yushui Sect and Longxiao Sword Gate, must also be formidable.

***

Time slowly passed. Zhang Jing and the others were still chatting.

Suddenly, they saw a young man in green robes, around twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old, full of high spirits, walking straight towards their location. Behind him followed several attendants, some carrying dishes, others holding wine.

"Qilian Yang, the main character of this Immortal Ascension Banquet, why is he walking towards us?" A voice filled with surprise and a hint of nervousness rang out beside him.

***

A trace of intrigued smile emerged on Zhang Jing's face. He could clearly feel that this Daoist junior, named Qilian Yang, had his attention fixed on him the entire time. Clearly, this person was likely coming for him.

As for the reason—

His gaze gently fell on Li Jie, who was following behind Qilian Yang with an obsequious expression. Zhang Jing roughly guessed a few things.

Not long after, it was as he had sensed. Qilian Yang walked directly up to Zhang Jing, lowering his head, his eyes flickering. He probed, "This must be Young Master Yu, Fellow Daoist Zhang Jing, I've long admired you!"

"Two years ago, you annihilated three Golden Core realm demon beasts in one battle, and it's said you even have a Golden Core realm white deer mount and a Golden Core realm natural immortal spirit. Truly enviable. May I ask, Fellow Daoist, what is your lineage and where are you from?"

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing answered vaguely, "I wander all over the place, unlike Fellow Daoist Qilian." He did not directly reveal his identity. It wasn't for the sake of 'playing the pig to eat the tiger,' but purely because he felt it was unnecessary and would save trouble. After all, his objective was the spiritual land of Lingshu Mountain. And the reason he attended this 'Immortal Ascension Banquet' today was simply because "one doesn't hit a smiling person." Since the other party had specially sent an invitation and even specifically mentioned that no gifts were required, Zhang Jing naturally saw no need to offend the City Lord's Estate and make them uncomfortable.

On the opposite side, upon hearing Zhang Jing's words, Qilian Yang hadn't reacted yet, but Li Jie, who was behind him, instantly flashed a look of relief. Seemingly noticing Zhang Jing's gaze, Li Jie even smiled and nodded, his face uncharacteristically lacking its previous restraint.

Then, Qilian Yang confidently said, "Since that's the case, why doesn't Fellow Daoist Zhang join our Three Yuan City? I'm sure Fellow Daoist is aware that I have already joined the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm and become a formal disciple of the Taiyi Immeasurable Dao Sect. The Three Yuan City of the future will surely not be what it is today, and it is precisely at such a time that we need a genius like Fellow Daoist."

"I guarantee you, if you join Three Yuan City, a position as a High-Grade Enshrinement will immediately be yours."

After speaking, seeing no hint of emotion on Zhang Jing's face, Qilian Yang changed to a more enticing tone and tried to persuade him again: "I heard from Li Jie that as soon as Fellow Daoist arrived in Three Yuan City, you showed considerable interest in Lingshu Mountain. How about this: as long as Fellow Daoist joins Three Yuan City, then when the spiritual land of Lingshu Mountain is fully formed and we relocate our base into it, we will build a cave dwelling for Fellow Daoist near a spiritual leyline nexus? How does that sound?"

***

"Fellow Daoist's kindness is appreciated, but I'll decline." Zhang Jing said calmly, his tone clearly conveying refusal.

Seeing his repeated invitations rejected, a flicker of anger crossed Qilian Yang's face, but in the next instant, the anger was replaced by indifference.

"Fellow Daoist, don't be too quick to refuse. Please consider it carefully before deciding." With those words, Qilian Yang turned and left without looking back.

"Fellow Daoist, no, my lord, you should really reconsider. Our Young City Lord has entered the Taiyi Immeasurable Dao Sect; surely you understand what that means. If you miss this village, you won't find this shop again." Li Jie, lagging a few steps behind, couldn't help but look strangely at the man he once called 'my lord'. He then sighed and offered a few heartfelt words of advice before hurrying away.

At the original spot, "Fellow Daoist, you're foolish! The conditions offered by Three Yuan City are so good, why refuse?"

"Crucially, if you agree, you'd be forming a connection with Young City Lord Qilian Yang. As a disciple of a Daoist sect, whatever crumbs he casually drops will be more than enough for us rogue cultivators." The black-robed man beside him said with great distress, an expression of wishing he could take Zhang Jing's place unconsciously appearing on his face.

"Everyone has their own aspirations—" Zhang Jing responded lightly.

However, before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by an unmistakably profound void fluctuation that seemed to come from nowhere.

This is? Zhang Jing's eyes immediately deepened.

The next moment, within the City Lord's Estate, numerous cultivators simultaneously rose, looking directly in the direction of Lingshu Mountain. "The spiritual land is fully formed!" A shared thought emerged in everyone's minds.

***

On the other side, approximately thirty-two thousand miles from Three Yuan City, lay the Yushui Sect's base. Pavilions and towers stretched for dozens of miles.

The Canglan River, hundreds of feet wide, flowed through it, surging powerfully and emitting a thunderous roar.

At this moment, within a magnificent palace in the central area, two figures sat opposite each other.

On one side, a middle-aged beauty with a palace bun adorned with a phoenix coronet sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, exuding a gentle, fluid aura.

On the other side sat a middle-aged man with long eyebrows and a long beard, his body as straight as a sword. An extremely sharp, almost world-cleaving aura enveloped him, making it impossible to look directly at him.

"Brother, Nephew Qilian Yang has already entered the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm, and with him, Three Yuan City has risen in prominence. It seems that for the spiritual land of Lingshu Mountain, our two families will return empty-handed."

***

A soft, pleasant voice suddenly rang out.

"Alas, times change!" The long-browed middle-aged man sighed, then said sourly, "I never expected that the balance our three families maintained for over a hundred years would be directly broken by Nephew Qilian Yang. Old man Qilian Jin has truly struck gold."

He paused, then stared at the woman with a half-smile, deep in thought. "Sister, you called me here today, surely it's not just to vent your frustrations, right?"

"Nothing escapes you, Brother." The woman smiled gently, then said, "Sister was thinking, since our two families are already destined not to compete with Three Yuan City for Lingshu Mountain, then... why not sell it for a good price now?"

"You mean—" The man was astonished.

"Exactly! Brother, through my connections, I found a Daoist disciple from the Dongming Blessed Land. I intend to give him the information about Lingshu Mountain. In return, he guaranteed to open two spots for cultivation within the Blessed Land. What do you think, Brother?"

"Dongming Blessed Land? Legend says that within the Taiyi Immeasurable Dao Sect, a Blessed Land is a higher place than a Dharma Realm. Two spots to cultivate in a Blessed Land?" At this point, the man stared at the woman, dumbfounded.

Finally, "Sister's connections are truly far-reaching! Haha, there's no reason for me not to agree."

Just then, a profound fluctuation came from afar. In an instant, the two exchanged glances, a smile flashing across their faces simultaneously as they both exclaimed, "The spiritual land is fully formed!"

"Sister, may I ask where the esteemed individual from the Dongming Blessed Land is currently? We need to reach Lingshu Mountain as quickly as possible."

"Please rest assured, Brother. That individual is not far away."

"Haha, excellent, Sister! This move truly is 'removing the firewood from under the cauldron.' I admire you, Brother! Old man Qilian Jin is surely going to be dumbfounded today."

***

Time trickled by.

In front of Lingshu Mountain, as more and more curious cultivators gathered, the entire area became boisterous.

Not long after, cultivators from the three forces—Three Yuan City, Yushui Sect, and Longxiao Sword Gate—appeared one by one, then arrayed themselves into three distinct factions, beginning their standoff. The atmosphere suddenly became tense and murderous. The combined, surging aura pressed down in all directions. The numerous onlookers were immediately thrown into disarray, yet despite this, no one dared to utter a single complaint.

In a more distant location, a subtle, inconspicuous streak of light quietly landed.

***

Zhang Jing's figure suddenly appeared.

Then, he lowered his head and looked ahead. In his line of sight were three Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, who had long been waiting, their bodies exuding faint traces of the terrifying aura of the Dharma Idol realm.

"How have things been? No problems recently, I hope?"

"Reporting to Master, everything is well. No accidents occurred," Bingfeng, the leader of the three Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, immediately said, puffing out its chest.

"That's good. Follow me into the spiritual land, then," Zhang Jing said with a faint smile, his expression serene, as if completely oblivious to the tense standoff in the distance.
