# Chapter 7: The Mysterious Space

Feng Jun's employee dormitory had four beds, with one unoccupied and only two roommates: Zhao Hongqi and Qin Tao. 

Both were junior staff at the club. Zhao Hongqi had a somewhat tense relationship with Feng Jun, while Qin Tao was the type who wouldn't utter a word even if beaten with three sticks. Apart from work hours, he spent all his time gaming at internet cafes—a true shut-in.

Despite his internet cafe habits, Qin Tao never stayed out overnight, though he often returned very late. As a local of Zhengyang, his relationship with Feng Jun was also rather distant.

Feng Jun glanced at the empty farm on his phone, then at his two sleeping roommates, and curled his lips in displeasure. Both were highly suspicious, but... there were two of them. It was impossible to determine who was more likely the culprit.

Such was life at the bottom of society—all kinds of petty malice, ugly faces, and despicable behavior were laid bare without pretense. Hurting others without benefiting oneself? That was perfectly normal.

Feng Jun sighed silently. There was nothing to be done—who told him not to set a password for his screensaver?

But the next moment, his eyes lit up. Since pulling weeds was exhausting, clearing the pasture grass was a decent alternative. 

For a moment, he forgot that he could have used his right hand to harvest the grass. 

In any case, the incident didn't dampen his mood too much. Leaving the dorm, he treated himself to a hearty breakfast, stuffing himself with fried dough sticks until they nearly reached his throat before finally putting down his chopsticks in satisfaction.

Exploring the farm's mechanics was truly a labor-intensive task.

Ignoring the vendor's surprised gaze, he bought breakfast for Xiao Li and leisurely made his way to the club.

Since he hadn't shown up the previous night, the area he was responsible for had been cleaned by someone else. Feng Jun wandered around and, noticing Xiao Li hadn't arrived yet, strolled into the employee locker room.

Liu Shuming was already there. Seeing Feng Jun enter, his face darkened. After a while, he asked through gritted teeth, "Did you break my charger?"

Feng Jun gave him a dismissive glance and said nothing, pulling out his phone to fiddle with it.

Liu Shuming's face turned livid with anger, but he didn't dare press further. He spat viciously and muttered, "Pretty boy, think you're some kind of big shot now?"

The remark carried an insinuation about Feng Jun's relationship with Sister Hong, though it wasn't explicitly stated. Feng Jun's complexion wasn't particularly fair—just not dark—so being called a "pretty boy" likely stemmed from his higher education.

Feng Jun ignored the jab. He placed his left hand on the table, fingers absently tapping the surface, then set his phone down and used his left hand to tap a blank spot on the screen.

He knew his left hand couldn't interact with QQ Farm—or any other icons, for that matter—but surely tapping an empty spot wouldn't cause any issues, right?

This was the kind of idle action born from sheer boredom, and as the saying goes—idle hands are the devil's workshop!

The next moment, Feng Jun met with tragedy. To his astonishment, he found himself transported into a bizarre space.

It was a wasteland, nothing but gravel stretching as far as the eye could see, as if he were standing in a desert.

He looked up. The sun hung in the sky, but it was unusually large—at least twice the size of the normal sun. In the distance, he could make out mountain ranges and faint patches of green.

Yet where he stood was utterly desolate. No plants, no animals, not even insects—just endless gravel and biting gusts of cold wind.

Feng Jun stood dumbfounded for a long while before muttering under his breath, "Damn... I really have a knack for trouble."

Leaving now would be easy, but since he was already here, he decided to explore and figure out what this place was.

As for the fact that he'd entered the phone right under Liu Shuming's nose? That didn't matter. It was too late for regrets now. Once inside, time outside should have stopped.

He scanned his surroundings again. To the east, beyond the distant mountains and faint greenery, he thought he could make out some orderly structures.

Might as well check them out. Feng Jun set off eastward. His hearty breakfast meant he didn't have to worry about stamina for now.

However, the saying "the mountain looks close, but the journey is long" held true. After walking for nearly three hours, he'd barely closed the distance. Now, he could vaguely discern rows of buildings—likely houses.

Would there be people inside? Feng Jun frowned. According to web novel tropes, he should stay hidden and be wary of villains lurking around.

He glanced at the sun, which had begun its descent. The light and warmth were fading, and the desert grew colder, the wind picking up. The moment he stopped, he felt a chill seep into his bones.

He turned up his collar to shield against the cold.

But the next moment, he nearly jumped out of his skin. "Holy—I brought my clothes in with me?"

The realization thrilled him. Back in Zhengyang, it was early autumn. Feng Jun wore a long-sleeved shirt and trousers—standard summer attire at the Hongjie Club.

He reached into his pocket and, sure enough, found cigarettes and a lighter.

The lighter wasn't windproof. After much effort, he managed to light a cigarette. Taking a deep, satisfying drag, he couldn't help but grin. "I've hit the jackpot. This is incredible—the possibilities are endless!"

A personal storage space like this fulfilled all his fantasies of a fortuitous encounter.

After some thought, he decided to approach the houses stealthily. Charging the phone enough to enter this space was costly, and until he could monetize this ability, he needed to conserve his limited funds.

Two hours later, he finally crept within half a kilometer of the houses.

The sun had sunk lower, and the wind grew even harsher.

But Feng Jun could only gape at the structures. "Ruins?"

It was clearly a village—seventy or eighty houses, all with collapsed roofs and crumbling walls, leaving only broken remnants.

Yet the layout was orderly enough that from a distance, they appeared intact.

To the west of the village was a large threshing ground, complete with a stone roller.

The wooden axle remained, but the frame was long gone, adding to the desolation.

Feng Jun frowned, weighing his options. Was anyone still here?

His gut said the village had been abandoned long ago, but... in this world, one had to always be wary of others seeking to kill and plunder.

Well, not plunder—but kill for his secret.

Yet leaving now meant who knew how long before he could gather enough energy to return.

After much hesitation, he steeled himself. At worst, he'd just have to buy more electricity.

The real issue was... it was freaking freezing here!

The next moment, he was back in the Hongjie Club's locker room.

A loud bang sounded nearby. Feng Jun turned to see Liu Shuming slamming his locker shut.

Seems he didn't notice anything odd. Feng Jun exhaled in relief—then smacked his own thigh hard. "Damn, I'm such an idiot."

Only now did it dawn on him: if time outside stopped when he entered the phone, any odd behavior from his body would last only an imperceptible instant.

He might as well have entered the phone physically—no one would notice. Time was frozen.

If he'd known earlier, why bother borrowing a phone at all?

He pocketed his phone, locked his clothes in the locker, and stepped into the shower. In that short span, another layer of grime had accumulated on his skin.

Turning the water to its hottest, he sighed in relief as the scalding stream washed over his chilled body. "Heavenly. I nearly froze to death earlier."

As he showered, he studied the fading mark on his arm. At this rate, he likely had only one more trip into the space left.

After drying off and changing, he left the locker room to find Xiao Li had arrived, finished breakfast, and was enthusiastically explaining something to two young men at the front desk.

Feng Jun reconsidered borrowing a phone. If time stopped, who would notice anything amiss?

Instead, he needed to prepare properly for his next trip—to confirm the storage capabilities and, ideally, uncover the secrets of that wasteland.

Of course, he'd have to plan carefully to avoid wasting energy.

The morning passed uneventfully. At noon, he skipped the cafeteria again, visiting the hole-in-the-wall eatery for the third consecutive day.

This time, he ate less, but the owner didn't mind. While settling the bill, the man suddenly remarked, "Have you grown taller lately?"

"Taller?" Feng Jun glanced at him and smiled. "Twenty-three, still sprouting—maybe."

Truthfully, he'd felt the same.

"Definitely taller," the owner nodded firmly. "We used to be the same height. Now you're a bit taller."

People of similar stature notice such changes most acutely.

"Really?" Feng Jun's interest was piqued. At 173 cm, he wasn't short by local standards.

But these days, height was prized. Just the other day, Wang Haifeng had declared 175 cm as "third-class disability."

The guy was 181 cm tall, so he could afford to say such things.
