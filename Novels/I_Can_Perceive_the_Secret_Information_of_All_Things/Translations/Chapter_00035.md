# Chapter 35: Where Did the Corpse Go?  

"We're here to find the Cui family steward's corpse," Xiao Ji said. "Once we locate the steward, we can wrap up this case."  

Xiao Ji intended to take a string from the Koi Luck-Transfer Embroidery, but he naturally wouldn't reveal his true motive upfront.  

However, finding the Cui family steward's corpse was indeed the key to solving the case.  

He planned to use this corpse to unravel the conspiracy of murder born from greed.  

The mass grave was thick with yin energy, and the presence of wild beasts and birds made the surroundings even more chaotic.  

"What do we do after we find the steward's corpse?" Song Yuanbao asked.  

"All we need to do is spread the word that the Cui family steward's body was found outside the city, dug up by wild dogs. Whoever rushes to the scene in a hurry to retrieve something from the corpse will be the killer. The rest—torture and interrogation—is your specialty as a constable," Xiao Ji explained his initial plan.  

"Brother Xiao, don't say such things. We don’t use any spirit whips, chili bone-drilling water, or agonizing finger presses for interrogation..." Song Yuanbao protested weakly.  

"That’s for later. First, let’s find the corpse," Xiao Ji said, not wanting to waste time.  

The two ventured deeper into the mass grave.  

"This place is quite large. Maybe I should have Chang Ping quietly bring some men over. More hands make light work," Song Yuanbao suggested, thinking it impossible for just the two of them to search such a vast area.  

"Just follow me," Xiao Ji said. "Though this place is chaotic and full of corpses and debris, the Cui family steward died recently. For the scavengers that come out at night, a fresh corpse is a feast—like stumbling upon a skewer of fresh lamb. Even if they can’t eat it, they’d still be drooling."  

The analogy was hard to stomach... Song Yuanbao suddenly found lamb skewers far less appetizing.  

"So, Brother Xiao means we just need to look for where the beasts are gathered and frantically digging. That’ll lead us to the freshest corpse, since the older ones have already been picked clean to the bone."  

A flock of night crows took flight, and a few wild dogs scattered.  

Xiao Ji suddenly stopped.  

Song Yuanbao stood quietly nearby, unsure what the Daoist had noticed.  

A *plop-plop* sound came from behind a pile of bones.  

**[A mutated black bear is digging at the burial site of the Cui family steward. It has smashed the sturdy wooden coffin in frustration—its emotions are furious because the food is missing.]**  

"Found it," Xiao Ji said, leaping forward, his figure darting under the moonlight.  

That easily?  

Song Yuanbao felt his intelligence was being humiliated in front of the Daoist.  

As a third-level Qi Refining constable, he wasn’t exactly a fool—he had plenty of experience in solving cases. But ever since meeting this Daoist from the Origin God Temple, he felt like a dumb ox being led by the nose.  

They didn’t even have a portrait of the steward, had never seen him, and now, without even encountering the corpse, Xiao Ji had pinpointed its location just from some *plop-plop* sounds.  

"Daoists are just like this—mysterious and inscrutable," Song Yuanbao muttered to himself, making excuses for Xiao Ji as he hurried to catch up.  

A mutated black bear, three men tall, stood under the moonlight, waving its massive furry arms as if saying, *Nice to meet you, let’s get acquainted.*  

Xiao Ji was happy to oblige.  

His sword *shinged* out of its sheath, its gleaming edge darting straight for the bear’s kidneys.  

Having lived in the mass grave for years, feeding on all sorts of mutated creatures, the bear had naturally mutated itself. It was immensely strong, nearly impervious to damage, and even had magical attacks.  

It opened its maw and exhaled a gale-force wind.  

Unfortunately, the wind wasn’t strong enough to budge Xiao Ji—or even Song Yuanbao.  

Seeing its ranged attack fail, the bear swung its massive paw.  

It met the sword head-on.  

*Swish!*  

The paw fell to the ground.  

The wild dogs lurking in the shadows and the crows perched on dead trees, waiting to scavenge, took one look at this scene and fled.  

They were seasoned scavengers—they knew danger when they saw it.  

The mutated bear, now missing a paw, let out a roar and turned to flee, its bipedal sprinting silhouette comically obvious under the moonlight.  

Xiao Ji accelerated and ran his sword through the bear from behind.  

A chance encounter, a swift battle—victory went to the Daoist.  

Returning to the dug-up pit, they found nothing but the shattered coffin. The Cui family steward’s corpse was nowhere to be seen.  

Xiao Ji was taken aback.  

He crouched and focused his senses on the broken coffin.  

**[The Cui family steward’s corpse was affected by the power of the four-string pipa fragments inside it, triggering an anomaly. It reanimated as a revenant, remembering only that it had a rendezvous with the Cui family’s madam and went to keep the appointment.]**  

Truly, the unpredictable happens.  

Even Xiao Ji was left speechless, standing dumbfounded in the cold wind.  

"Brother Xiao, there’s no corpse here. Let’s keep looking," Song Yuanbao said. "I just had a great idea—why don’t we split up? You take the east side, I’ll take the west..."  

Xiao Ji collected himself and glanced at Song Yuanbao. "A fine idea, Constable Song. I fully agree... but right now, we need to head to the Cui residence. I suspect the steward has gone to see the madam."  

"Wha—?" Song Yuanbao shook his head, thinking he’d misheard. "Brother, didn’t you say the steward was already dead?"  

"Ghostly cases happen every year. A corpse going on a date isn’t that strange, is it?" Xiao Ji started walking toward the city. "We need to hurry."  

This was an unforeseen complication. It meant all their plans had to change.  

The original strategy of luring out the killer might not work anymore—after all, if a dead man showed up at the Cui residence, both Han Kaishan and Coroner Wang Dajiu would find out.  

If the revenant steward dropped the Koi Luck-Transfer Embroidery from his stomach, things would get even messier.  

At the same time, Xiao Ji thought about the Nine Treasures fragments. These ancient artifact shards were truly miraculous—different people gained different abilities from them. Even stuffed inside a corpse, they could trigger reanimation, making the dead rise again.  

Han Kaishan probably never imagined his carefully planned corpse-stashing scheme would backfire like this.  

The corpse had taken the embroidery and gone on a date.  

The two sprinted under the moonlight.  

At the city gates, they showed their passes and entered through a side door, heading straight for the Cui family’s main residence.  

Before they even reached the door, they heard a commotion.  

In the distance, the Cui residence was brightly lit, with fires burning in some areas.  

At the main gate, officers stood guard while investigators rushed inside.  

"Constable Song, you’re here," Chang Ping greeted them. "Something’s happened at the Cui residence—many people are dead."  

"Who did it?" Song Yuanbao asked.  

"A frenzied zombie," Chang Ping replied.
