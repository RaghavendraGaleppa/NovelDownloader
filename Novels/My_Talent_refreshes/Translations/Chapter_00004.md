# Chapter 4: The Ding District of the Spirit Plantation

He Changyou picked up the jade slip previously given to him by Elder Chen and began reading names aloud.

"Bai Xiaotian, Fire Kitchen Division!"

"Qiu Yu, Spirit Beast Division."

"Chen Dao, Spirit Plantation Division."

...

He Changyou called out each name after glancing at the jade slip. Chu Ning guessed he was checking their spiritual roots before assigning them to different divisions based on their attributes, since he'd mentioned the cultivation techniques and spells would vary.

"Chu Ning, Spirit Plantation Division."

Hearing his name called for the Spirit Plantation Division, Chu Ning felt a quiet relief.

After all assignments were made, Chu Ning estimated nearly thirty newcomers were sent to the Spirit Plantation Division—the largest group—followed by the Spirit Beast Division. It seemed agriculture and husbandry remained core industries of the Qingxi Sect.

Several people emerged from the building to lead the groups to their respective divisions, with He Changyou personally guiding the Spirit Plantation group.

"Those assigned to Spirit Plantation, follow me," He Changyou said, heading toward the mountain's base.

Many hopeful disciples looked disappointed at descending the mountain, distancing themselves from the sect's core. Chu Ning wasn't surprised—farming typically happened in lowlands. He wondered how immortal cultivation's farming differed from Earth's. Having grown up in the countryside, he'd done his share of planting rice and harvesting crops before city life consumed his time.

As they walked, vast fields came into view, with small courtyards scattered along the boundary between farmland and mountain.

"Our Qingxi Sect's spirit fields are classified into four grades: Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding," He Changyou explained. "Higher cultivation allows tending higher-grade fields with better spirit plants. The Jia and Yi fields are managed by outer and inner disciples, even stewards and elders. Our Hundred Arts Hall oversees Bing and Ding districts. As newcomers, you'll start in the Ding district."

They reached the outermost fields where a group of mostly middle-aged cultivators waited. They greeted He Changyou respectfully, addressing him as "Steward He," receiving only a slight nod in return.

Chu Ning noted the stark hierarchy—He Changyou's deference to Elder Chen contrasted sharply with his aloofness toward the labor disciples. It reminded him to keep a low profile until stronger.

"These are this year's newcomers," He Changyou announced. "Follow the usual procedure—each of you take one to mentor." Turning to the newcomers, he added, "Later, someone will deliver cultivation manuals and supplies. Your seniors will teach you basic planting techniques and simple spells for the Ding district. Every fortnight, gather at the Teaching Hall for guidance from assigned instructors. After three months of training, those who pass the assessment may tend fields independently."

Assignments proceeded swiftly. When Chu Ning's turn came, He Changyou said, "Chu Ning, you'll follow Cao Dongxin."

A dark-skinned, slightly hunched middle-aged man stepped forward. Appearing nearly fifty, Cao Dongxin stood out even among the older labor disciples. Chu Ning greeted him politely as "Senior Brother Cao," receiving only a glance in response.

After assignments, the groups dispersed. Cao Dongxin walked away without a word, leaving Chu Ning to follow silently, wondering if his mentor was mute.

Nearby conversations caught his attention:

"The Ding district has hundreds, but few newcomers, so only some of us were called."

"Most here are at early or mid Qi Refining stages, with the highest being fifth layer. Those reaching sixth layer with potential for late-stage advancement move to higher-grade fields. We're essentially the least talented, waiting to grow old here."

"New batches every three years give us three months of helpers—our only perk as old-timers."

The self-deprecating yet talkative senior, Shang Zhaoxiang, provided valuable insights. Chu Ning realized why these seniors lacked ambition—repeatedly watching more talented juniors surpass them had worn away their drive.

Reaching a small courtyard, Cao Dongxin entered without ceremony. Chu Ning finally spoke up: "Senior Brother, which room is mine?"

Cao Dongxin pointed wordlessly to the eastern room.

"Any other instructions?" Chu Ning pressed.

After a pause, Cao Dongxin replied without turning, "Report to the fields at dawn tomorrow," before disappearing inside.

So he could speak—just exceptionally taciturn. Chu Ning maintained a neutral expression, careful not to show displeasure toward his uncommunicative mentor. He didn't notice Cao Dongxin observing his reaction through the closing door, expressionless but noting Chu Ning's composure.

The eastern room was sparse but clean. Chu Ning settled in until a voice called from the courtyard: "Chu Ning, collect your supplies!"

This would include the cultivation manuals—the very reason countless sought entry to Qingxi Sect. True immortal cultivation techniques awaited.
