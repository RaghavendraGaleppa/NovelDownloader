# Chapter 191: Taiyin Domain

“Our Lord is magnificent!”

In a certain corner of Hero's Isle, a group of creatures from the Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction cheered excitedly in unison. Facing a Prince of the Human Emperor's Dao Court, one of the strongest immortal orthodoxies of the human race, their Lord had actually defeated him in an almost sweeping manner. This scene instantly made their blood boil.

“Our Lord truly lives up to his heritage as a Celestial God descendant! Even among all Foundation Establishment cultivators in our Eleven Heavens of Myriad Spirits, he ranks among the foremost.”

“It seems that no matter how exaggerated the talents of human prodigies are, at least at the Foundation Establishment stage, they are still unable to compete with the prodigies of our Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction.” The Water-Evasion Deer had an expression of vicarious pride on its face.

“Indeed! This time, the first place undoubtedly belongs to our Lord. And then he’ll gain another innate divine ability, the Soaring Sun Auspicious Cloud. I can’t imagine how powerful our Lord will become in the future.”

“Perhaps he might even rival or surpass—” The Red-Eyed Golden Roc’s words were barely out of its mouth when a fox-like creature beside it immediately stopped him.

“Hush, careful what you say!”

On the arena stage.

*Gulp—* A sound of swallowing saliva echoed beside his ear. Zhang Jing involuntarily looked to his side. He saw Qu Junhou, currently staring blankly at the graceful figure on the opposite stage. He seemed to have never imagined that the battle between her and Ji Changyu would end in such an unexpected manner for everyone. One must know that Ji Changyu was no weakling. Even a powerful figure like Brother Zhang only found Ji Changyu's weakness after a period of entanglement and secured victory in one blow.

For a moment, Qu Junhou couldn't help but sigh with emotion. “Myriad Spirits of the Heavens, ah!”

Beside him, Zhang Jing gently shifted his gaze from Qu Junhou, then looked at Chang Jin on the opposite side, a strange light flashing in his eyes. That phantom of a bright moon that rose behind her just now—could it be a racial talent? He just didn’t know what kind of power that peculiar moonlight possessed. It was able to make Ji Changyu, who wielded the terrifying Human Dao True Flame, lose the duel directly without any power to resist? Zhang Jing slowly recalled the scene he had just witnessed, yet he gained nothing.

Ultimately, “Never mind. At worst, I’ll experience it myself later,” Zhang Jing thought to himself. His expression remained calm and unperturbed. Although the astonishing scene that had just unfolded on the arena stage had caused a huge commotion among others, this did not disturb Zhang Jing's state of mind. Defeating Ji Changyu in an instant was not a difficult task. If he used the pseudo-version of the Innate Primordial Immortal Light, he could easily achieve the same. It was merely a question of whether he wanted to or not, and whether it was necessary.

Coming back to his senses, Zhang Jing suddenly noticed that Qu Junhou beside him was staring intently at him.

“Brother Zhang, did you see that? Ji Changyu didn’t even have the slightest power to resist in front of that woman. This… this…” At this moment, Qu Junhou’s mind was blank. He completely didn't know what words to use to describe his feelings at this moment.

After a long while, Qu Junhou finally recovered from his immense shock. Then he seemed to realize something, a hint of hesitation flashing in his eyes, as if he wanted to speak but held back.

“Brother Qu, just say whatever you want to say,” Zhang Jing said with a smile, having seen the conflicted expression on the other’s face. His voice was as gentle and calm as ever.

Hearing this, Qu Junhou took a deep breath: “Brother Zhang, that woman's identity is absolutely not ordinary. Later... you must be extremely careful! Actually, even if you lose, it's nothing; at least you still have Ji Changyu at the bottom.” He sighed faintly. “As for that innate divine ability... Anyway, we've already earned enough fortune this time. Once we return, what divine abilities aren't available in the Dao Scripture Secret Realm of the Flowing Light Immortal Realm?”

“This is all I can say, Brother Zhang. Take care!” As soon as he finished speaking, he saw the other’s figure flash, instantly vanishing from the arena stage. In an instant, a flash of light swept across the scroll suspended in the sky. Zhang Jing's number of victories also quietly changed from ninety-seven to ninety-eight. And Qu Junhou’s direct act of conceding defeat actually failed to attract anyone's attention. Evidently, everyone was still immersed in the shock of Ji Changyu’s crushing defeat. Many of them had even fallen into despair. For no other reason, it was simply that the gap between the two had reached an incomprehensible level.

Time slowly passed. The ninety-ninth round of the ranking battle quietly arrived. This was the round that would directly determine the ownership of the top spot in Foundation Establishment this time. It was also the round that would decide whether the first place belonged to the human race or the Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction. Logically speaking, the atmosphere should have been very enthusiastic. However, at this moment, there was a profound silence. Countless gazes, filled with trepidation, worry, and even despair, were cast towards an empty arena stage.

Two numbers slowly appeared on it: A-1! B-1! The two individuals who had consistently ranked in the top two on the victory scoreboard on the celestial scroll, and were currently the only two with full victories, finally clashed in the final round. A scene that should have been exciting, but in the eyes of the crowd at this moment, it strangely carried a hint of tragedy.

At the same time, on the other arena stages, regardless of whether they were creatures from the Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction or human cultivators, they all tacitly stood in place, their gazes fixed on that particular arena. However, the expressions on both sides were vastly different. The creatures of the Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction had, at some point, filled their faces with anticipation and excitement; while many human cultivators revealed complex expressions. It was a kind of helpless despair, as if they had already seen the outcome but still had to face it. Some even turned their backs, unwilling to watch anymore.

In mid-air, Zhang Jing’s gaze slowly swept across everyone's faces. “What’s going on? So what if Ji Changyu lost miserably? Is it really like the sky is falling?” Zhang Jing immediately showed a wry smile on his face. The next moment, a rainbow light flashed past, and the spot was suddenly empty.

At the same time, on Hero's Isle, a clear, cold moonlight, enveloping a figure, slowly rose.

***

“Fellow Daoist Zhang Jing, please enlighten me.” Chang Jin’s voice, clear yet carrying authority, accompanied by a series of silvery bell-like sounds, slowly reached Zhang Jing’s ears.

“Fellow Daoist is too polite. Please enlighten me too.” On the opposite side, Zhang Jing’s eyes flashed with surprise, then he smiled faintly, responding just as courteously. He seemed to subtly detect a hint of solemnity in her words. This was not the typical demeanor of someone who had just swept aside their opponent, nor did it align with external expectations.

So... “A keen perception? Interesting,” Zhang Jing mused inwardly, a faint smile glinting in his eyes.

Just then, “Zhang Jing, I know you definitely have trump cards. You probably won’t keep them hidden this time, right?” A voice, carrying a hint of curiosity, softly sounded in his ear. He looked across, his gaze seeming to pierce through layers of mist, once again seeing those crystalline eyes, curved in a smile, as bright as the clear moon.

“Well... who can say for sure?” Zhang Jing replied softly.

“Heh, then I’ll just see for myself! Make sure to... be careful,” Chang Jin’s voice held a hint of cunning.

***

As her words fell, a familiar phantom of a bright moon suddenly entered his vision. In an instant, Zhang Jing saw this phantom growing higher and larger, and in but a blink of an eye, it had already ascended into the sky. The sky instantly dimmed. The great sun was obscured, a bright moon hung high, and boundless cold moonlight showered upon the land.

Zhang Jing subconsciously looked around. The arena stage beneath his feet had long vanished, replaced by an ancient, desolate land, subtly exuding a wild, primeval aura. *Where was this?* A hint of confusion flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Just then, behind his head, a faint, misty five-colored spiritual light slowly rose. As the five colors circulated, a crimson hue suddenly burst forth with great brilliance, instantly dyeing Zhang Jing crimson. Before long, his consciousness slowly returned to clarity. However... the scene before his eyes had not changed in the slightest; it was still the same ancient, desolate region.

A thoughtful expression flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. Firstly, he could be certain that the area he was currently in was definitely not a truly existing place in the absolute sense, because such a method was not something a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator could employ. But if it were an illusion... Zhang Jing shook his head. Due to the existence of the Dao Yuan Auspicious Cloud, ordinary illusionary techniques simply could not affect him. It was the same principle: if one wanted to forcefully pull him into an illusion, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator would definitely be unable to do so, not even if the opponent was a prodigy from the Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction.

Furthermore—seemingly sensing something, Zhang Jing couldn't help but close his eyes. The Dao Yuan Auspicious Cloud rose behind his head, its five-colored spiritual light began to circulate wildly, and a ‘Heart Eye’ quietly opened.

Taiyin Dao Intent!

At this moment, in Zhang Jing’s perception, every grain of sand, every pebble, every blade of grass, and every leaf in the area beneath his feet seemed to be permeated by various forms of extremely pure and overwhelmingly domineering Taiyin Dao Intent. Here, nothing could be tolerated but the Dao and principles of Taiyin!

“Dao Domain?” Zhang Jing suddenly had a flash of insight. He suddenly felt that this was very similar to the description of the Dao Domain he would form in the future from his cultivate Primordial Beginning Realm legacy. But the next moment, Zhang Jing shook his head again. One could only say it was somewhat similar to a Dao Domain, but in reality... it was vastly different, miles apart. The terrifying nature of a Dao Domain was far from something this ancient, desolate land beneath his feet could compare to. Rather than calling this a Dao Domain, Zhang Jing preferred to call it a “domain,” which might be more fitting.

***

“A domain filled with the principles of Taiyin, is this your talent? It’s truly terrifying, no wonder Ji Changyu was defeated so easily.” After figuring it out, he couldn’t help but smile faintly, his mind suddenly clear. Under the oppression of this Taiyin Domain, Ji Changyu, relying solely on that weak and incomplete Human Dao True Flame he wielded, would certainly have no room to resist. He was utterly suppressed. What a pity... he wasn’t Ji Changyu!

Zhang Jing’s gaze suddenly deepened. A mere Taiyin Domain; he would simply shatter it!

Suddenly, a chaotic-colored immortal light abruptly appeared in his hand. The four elements of earth, fire, wind, and water intertwined at the edges of the immortal light, flickering with bright and dim radiance. Whisps of terrifying creation intent quietly permeated the surroundings.
