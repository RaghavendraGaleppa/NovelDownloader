# Chapter 84: The Sudden Appearance of the Joyous Demon Sect

As Mo Changqing spoke these words, his gaze remained fixed intently on Zhang Yan, making the latter feel somewhat uneasy. 

Zhang Yan understood Mo Changqing's implication—he wanted him to bring back more techniques from the Chuan Dao Tower. However, Zhang Yan could only shrug in response. He would do his best, but his greatest advantage lay in equipping magical artifacts. If the Chuan Dao Tower didn't have artifacts for him to equip, he would only be slightly more capable than an ordinary genius. 

After all, his innate comprehension was already quite remarkable. Coupled with the boost from the Enlightenment Cushion, his understanding far surpassed that of an average person. Therefore, he should be able to achieve decent results. 

The sect placed great importance on this expedition to the Chuan Dao Tower. Two Golden Core cultivators were dispatched—one was Lei Kunhai, and the other was an elderly woman Zhang Yan didn’t know well, having only seen her a few times. 

What truly surprised him was that the two elders had brought along someone he recognized—Ji Yourong! 

After several years apart, she had become even more radiant. Her Daoist robes couldn't conceal her curvaceous figure, and she stood out effortlessly in the crowd. 

Seeing Ji Yourong again, Zhang Yan had to admit he felt awkward. Looking back, he realized his past behavior had been rather reckless. Even so, he didn’t see the point in apologizing now—too much time had passed, and bringing it up would only make things more uncomfortable. 

Ji Yourong clearly recognized him too, her expression one of disbelief. She couldn’t understand how that scoundrel from back then had become a True Disciple in the years she had been away on her master’s travels. 

Though resentful, she had no choice but to meekly greet him as "Senior Brother True Disciple" when Lei Kunhai introduced them. 

Such was the hierarchy—rank dictated respect, and the status of a True Disciple far surpassed that of an ordinary Inner Disciple. 

"Alright, now that introductions are done, let's depart," Lei Kunhai said impatiently. With a wave of his hand, a flying ship materialized in the sky, and everyone quickly boarded. 

Once aboard, Zhang Yan had intended to explore the ship’s control room, but Lei Kunhai intercepted him. 

"Kid, how’s your artifact forging coming along?" Lei Kunhai asked with a grin. 

"Not bad. I’ve completed all the ones you gave me," Zhang Yan replied, retrieving a pile of artifacts from his storage pouch. 

"Let me take a look." 

Lei Kunhai was pleased to see so many artifacts. He picked them up one by one, inspecting them closely. His initial intention had been to guide Zhang Yan and point out any flaws, but as he examined them, his expression shifted to astonishment. 

Zhang Yan’s progress was terrifyingly fast. 

He had forged eighteen artifacts—standard flying swords, the simplest type of artifact. Though basic, crafting flying swords still posed a challenge for most. 

Zhang Yan’s first few attempts had obvious flaws, but his improvement was rapid. By the sixth sword, the flaws had nearly vanished. By the tenth, it was a perfectly serviceable weapon—on par with those made by seasoned forgers in the Thousand Treasures Peak. 

By the fifteenth sword, Lei Kunhai was speechless. 

The craftsmanship bore his own unmistakable style—from the hammer strikes to the finishing touches. If not for the fact that he hadn’t forged such basic swords in years, he might have mistaken it for his own work. 

"Elder Lei, how did I do?" Zhang Yan asked earnestly. 

Lei Kunhai hesitated. He preferred a tough-love approach, pointing out flaws rather than offering praise. But how could he criticize Zhang Yan’s work when it mirrored his own? 

Criticizing Zhang Yan would mean criticizing himself—and he saw no reason to do that. 

After a long pause, Lei Kunhai finally said, "These are just low-grade standard artifacts. Move on to mid-grade ones." 

He handed Zhang Yan another storage pouch, this one containing materials for mid-grade artifacts. As for the low-grade swords, Lei Kunhai bought them back at market price, giving Zhang Yan a tidy profit. 

The new blueprint was for a shield-type artifact—a circular design that would be more challenging to forge. 

But for a genius like Zhang Yan, it was child’s play.

The flying ship moved swiftly, especially under the control of a Golden Core cultivator. By noon the next day, they had arrived at the secret realm’s location. 

To Zhang Yan’s surprise, the realm wasn’t situated in some remote mountain or plain but in the heart of a city. The mortals had long been evacuated, leaving behind empty houses. 

This worked in their favor—they simply occupied a well-maintained mansion. The family living there had vacated immediately upon their arrival, even cleaning the place before leaving. 

"The Flower Palace hasn’t arrived yet. Once they do, the secret realm will officially open," Lei Kunhai announced as the group’s leader. 

Three days passed in a flash. 

Then, a massive petal-like object appeared in the sky, carrying over a dozen figures—members of the Flower Palace. 

Once they arrived, all the Golden Core cultivators ascended to meet them. 

When Lei Kunhai and the elderly Flower Granny returned, their expressions were grim. 

"The Flower Palace has gone too far!" Lei Kunhai fumed. "This is a Zhao Kingdom secret realm, yet they invited sects from the Shen Kingdom without consulting us. What are they playing at? They don’t respect us at all!" 

"I suspect the Flower Palace had no choice," Flower Granny said calmly. "Their Nascent Soul elder is on the verge of death. To maintain their dominance in Zhao, they need outside support—and the Joyous Demon Sect from Shen is their best option." 

She spoke openly in front of Zhang Yan and the other True Disciples, as they were now privy to sect affairs. 

Ji Yourong, being her disciple, was also included. 

"Aligning with the Joyous Demon Sect? Are they planning to offer their own disciples as cultivation cauldrons?" Lei Kunhai scoffed. 

Flower Granny merely smiled. 

In truth, the Flower Palace’s actions had little impact on the Qingheng Sect. Their influence was concentrated in the Tianmu Mountain Range, and they rarely recruited from Zhao’s general population. 

"The Flower Palace will pay for this," Lei Kunhai muttered. "Women’s decisions are always irrational." 

Flower Granny’s expression darkened, and she left without another word. 

Lei Kunhai sighed—his blunt tongue had gotten him in trouble again. 

---

Despite the Joyous Demon Sect’s sudden inclusion, the major sects remained unfazed. Only minor families lost their spots, but no one dared protest. 

With the Flower Palace’s Nascent Soul elder and now the Joyous Demon Sect’s two Nascent Souls—one mid-stage, one early-stage—everyone kept their heads down. 

The Joyous Demon Sect had turned the Shen Kingdom into an impenetrable stronghold over two centuries, and now their influence was spreading to Zhao. 

The irony? Zhao’s strongest sect had invited them in. 

Zhang Yan couldn’t help but think of his grandmaster. Once the old man reached Nascent Soul, things might change—but that would have to wait until Zhang Yan himself reached Foundation Establishment. 

"Let’s enter the secret realm," Lei Kunhai said, checking the time. 

He led the group to a stone stele—the entrance to the Chuan Dao Tower. 

Once everyone had gathered, three figures—one man and two women—descended from above. All three were at late Golden Core. 

One woman wore the Flower Palace’s robes, but the other two—a man and a woman—were the real focus. 

The man was handsome, the woman beautiful. 

Zhang Yan found their presence oddly repulsive. 

"The Joyous Demon Sect is a demonic sect. Be careful if you ever encounter them," Lei Kunhai warned Zhang Yan quietly, erecting a sound barrier. 

"Demonic? But isn’t dual cultivation a legitimate path?" Zhang Yan asked, confused. 

"Dual cultivation is indeed a Daoist practice, but the Joyous Demon Sect specializes in *plundering* cultivation—draining partners dry. They treat others as mere cauldrons, even targeting those of the same gender. No one who falls into their hands escapes unscathed." 

Some victims were drained completely, while others were kept alive as perpetual energy sources, repeatedly exploited until their life force was exhausted. 

Rumor had it that the Joyous Demon Sect’s two Nascent Souls had advanced by consuming their cultivation partners entirely. 

"Truly demonic methods," Zhang Yan murmured. 

But he understood the appeal—why cultivate painstakingly when you could steal power from others? 

"Just be cautious if you ever cross paths with them," Lei Kunhai said, satisfied with Zhang Yan’s reaction. 

---

As they spoke, the Flower Palace and Joyous Demon Sect jointly opened a swirling portal. 

"The second layer of the secret realm is ready. Prepare to enter," Lei Kunhai said, dispersing the barrier. 

"The path is open! Enter now!" the Flower Palace’s Golden Core cultivator commanded. 

A stream of cultivators surged forward, some attempting to sneak in but swiftly executed by the Golden Cores. 

Zhang Yan entered unhurriedly. 

The moment he stepped through, the world spun around him. 

When his vision cleared, he found himself in an enclosed space—the Chuan Dao Tower. 

A cold voice echoed: 

"Bloodline detected…"  
"Talent detected…"  
"Physique detected…"  
"Comprehension detected…"  
"Combat ability detected…"  
"Potential detected…"  
"Analysis complete!"  

"Race: Human"  
"Talent: High-grade wood spirit root, mid-grade metal spirit root, low-grade water and fire spirit roots"  
"Combat ability: Weak"  
"Potential: Below average"  
"Trial initiated. Begin."  

"Accurate assessment," Zhang Yan chuckled. "But you missed my cheat."  

The trial presented him with a late Qi Refining wolf demon, baring its fangs.  

Zhang Yan grinned.

**Author's Note:** Apologies, everyone. I meant to write more last night, but after running six kilometers in the morning and cycling twenty in the evening, I collapsed after finishing the chapter. I woke up at noon the next day when someone called me. My bad!
