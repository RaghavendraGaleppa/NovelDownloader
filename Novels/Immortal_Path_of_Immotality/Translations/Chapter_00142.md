# Chapter 141: The Depths of the Starry Sky

Dongmen Pass, one of the strategic fortresses connecting the eastern and western regions of the Central Plains through the Luosong Mountain Range, had stood since ancient times, reinforced and expanded through successive dynasties.

When the war between the righteous and demonic factions reignited, this formidable city was directly taken over by the righteous cultivation world from the Great Song imperial family. Led by the Zixiao Sect, twelve small and medium-sized sects jointly defended it.

Now this impregnable city was engulfed in the flames of war, with half its walls collapsed as swarms of demonic cultivators poured in from outside. In the sky, Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators flew in on their swords—the anti-flight formations had been secretly destroyed by suicide squads the previous night.

At the center of the aerial battle, three figures clashed fiercely, their magical power rippling out for dozens of miles. Three massive Nascent Soul Dharma Idols unleashed divine abilities while powerful magic treasures blazed with light.

A closer look revealed two Black Lotus Sect Dharma Kings ganging up on a single Zixiao Sect elder, wearing him down deliberately to prevent him from directing the battle below.

Moreover, unspoken rules existed in cultivation world warfare—high-level cultivators couldn't indiscriminately slaughter low-level disciples during conflicts. Usually, soldiers fought soldiers while generals battled generals. If top-tier experts targeted weaker opponents, their own disciples would be wiped out. This consensus had been deeply ingrained over centuries.

The Battle of Dongmen Pass had gathered half the forces from the central warzone. Reinforcements continued arriving from other regions—the full-front assault was merely a feint to disperse righteous faction forces before concentrating firepower for a decisive breakthrough.

This was an overt stratagem!

Even knowing the demonic faction's intentions and understanding that prolonged defense would inevitably fail, the righteous cultivators had no choice but to divide their forces. Just the day before, even the three Black Lotus Dharma Kings themselves hadn't known their main attack point—they planned to concentrate forces wherever cannon fodder first succeeded.

The Dongmen Pass vanguard had struck gold, collapsing half the walls and destroying anti-flight formations! Compared to other treacherous locations, this was clearly the optimal breakthrough point. Thus, other vanguard teams were abandoned as all forces were redirected here to expand the advantage and fully penetrate the central Luosong Mountains.

Below, the city echoed with battle cries as righteous and demonic mid-to-low level cultivators engaged in street fighting. The demonic cultivators clearly held the upper hand, steadily advancing while righteous forces retreated—victory seemed imminent.

Suddenly, winged spirit beasts appeared from the west as righteous reinforcements arrived. Simultaneously, fleets of flying boats approached from the east with demonic reinforcements. Both sides began reinforcing piecemeal, testing who would last longer.

...

The Poison Burial Canyon was far less lively. The vanguard team waited from dawn to dusk, then through another night—three full days passed without any follow-up forces. With their ragtag group of a thousand having reached this point in one night, it was impossible for the main army of ten thousand to take three days.

"We can't wait any longer. Everyone moves out now!" Protector Yan finally decided, leading the group forward.

Retreat wasn't an option—if they fought through to reunite with main forces at the capital Bianliang, they might survive. Returning meant facing military punishment! To Nascent Soul cultivators, Golden Core experts were merely larger ants, expendable at will. As a local faction member without any high-level backing, she'd been sent as cannon fodder anyway.

Lin Shan rose with his forty-odd followers. For him, reaching the Great Song capital sooner meant better opportunities to fish in troubled waters—he'd been coveting the giant Black Lotus Buddha statue for six or seven years.

The group set off in subdued spirits, even the usually lively Luan Chun growing quiet. The stone forest ahead, whether natural or man-made, stood in orderly rows—massive boulders of varying heights aligned with feng shui principles and celestial patterns. Though seemingly ancient, they displayed no supernatural phenomena now. Striking them with magic tools left only white marks.

Lin Shan touched one and his enhancement panel identified them as high-grade spirit materials. Delighted, he tried extracting them but found them rooted deep underground. With hundreds watching, he couldn't openly use his Severing Water Sword to cut them out, reluctantly abandoning them for now.

After several hundred miles, the front halted abruptly. Before anyone could react, Yan Yuanchun's voice echoed in their minds: "Take cover!"

As cultivators hastily dropped down, an enormous shadow loomed overhead. Dense footsteps approached—"Tap tap tap tap tap"—revealing a thirty-meter-long giant centipede. Its nightmarish head sported five-meter antennae probing the air, its segmented black-and-yellow armor gleaming as hundreds of legs carried it through the stone forest, leaving wet trails behind.

---

This venomous creature clearly topped the Poison Burial Canyon's food chain. Having grown to this size over countless years, it had absorbed heaven and earth's essence while devouring countless creatures.

Lin Shan held his breath, motionless as the behemoth crawled past. The agonizingly slow passage ended only when the creature fully departed, allowing everyone to exhale in relief.

"That centipede is one step from shapeshifting! And here I am, barely recovered to Qi Refining stage—why must I encounter such monsters?" The Black Skeleton Demon Lord watched the creature leave with palpable fear—even a skeleton could feel terror.

Lin Shan ignored its complaints. Against such high-level venomous creatures, he was insignificant as an ant, unworthy of notice unless provoked. His meager flesh wouldn't even make a snack.

The encounter sobered the group, who proceeded with heightened caution, wary of encountering other lethal threats in this treacherous land.

The stone forest spanned over a thousand miles. Moving carefully to avoid venomous creatures, the group took a full day to traverse it, reaching the final danger zone—the Yin Miasma Illusion Wind Belt.

Beyond this wind belt lay righteous faction territory.

Perpetual winds carrying yin energy and miasma blew here, compounded by illusionary effects that could trap unwary cultivators forever. Historical accounts from survivors warned that one might already be ensnared in illusions while believing themselves lucid.

Without hesitation, Yan Yuanchun charged in first, forcing Lin Shan and others to follow reluctantly.

...

Biting winds stung Lin Shan's face—even spiritual barriers proved ineffective against the pervasive yin energy that gradually corroded both body and cultivation. His followers clung to him, making each step feel like dragging dozens of people.

Amid howling winds and indistinct cries, white fog obscured everything. Dispersed spiritual sense forced blind advancement in one direction.

Time lost meaning as Lin Shan's thoughts slowed. He remembered only the need to lead everyone out, the purpose beyond fading from memory.

"Brother, wake up!" The skeleton pendant's voice pulled him from stupor. His vision refocused on the white void as wind howled anew.

"Hmm? You woke me?"

"Actually... I'm cold. Could you lend me some clothes?" The embarrassed Black Skeleton Demon Lord, merely Qi Refining level without flesh, couldn't endure the yin winds bare-boned.

"A skeleton afraid of cold?" Lin Shan eyed it skeptically—an underworld creature complaining about chill?

"I'm from the Hell World! We live near lava pools—completely different from Underworld skeletons!" After its lamentations, Lin Shan reluctantly gifted it a mid-grade magic robe from his storage bracelet.

Turning around, he found his followers vanished. "Where are they?"

The skeleton admitted they'd gotten lost half an hour prior. Alone again, Lin Shan pressed on, now alert thanks to the skeleton's warnings.

After hours wandering the featureless white expanse, he recalled his Void Star Compass. The silver compass's needle spun wildly before stabilizing, revealing he'd been walking in circles. Reorienting eastward, he marched until the scenery abruptly changed—a lush ancient tree stood ahead, bearing green fruits.

"Demon Taro Fruit!" The skeleton exclaimed with lustful excitement.

Lin Shan eyed the verdant spirit tree skeptically—how could this be "Demon Taro"? The skeleton explained it was a rare material requiring millennia in extreme heat and demonic energy to form, crucial for advancing its body to Golden Core stage.

Yet it seemed incongruous here. Lin Shan scoffed: "You see demon fruit, I see spirit fruit—this is clearly illusion!"

As if reacting, the tree withered instantly, fruits blackening. "...Really?" Lin Shan deadpanned at the tree's pathetic deception—changing appearances mid-conversation?

The withered tree shook pathetically, but Lin Shan mused aloud: "Demonic fruits are useless. I'd prefer spirit peaches to quench thirst."

Immediately, the tree transformed into a stout peach tree laden with fruit. Even the centuries-old skeleton was dumbfounded by such an idiotic tree!

Done playing, Lin Shan drew his sword—prompting the tree to uproot itself and scamper away on dozens of root-legs!

"Illusion Spirit Ancient Tree!" The skeleton suddenly recognized it, urging pursuit while explaining: "Born in yin winds, it takes millennia to gain sentience and mimic various trees. The wood is priceless for illusion artifacts and formations! Its sap enhances illusion resistance with prolonged use—eventually seeing through most illusions!"

Lin Shan quickened his pace—while the Void Star Compass helped navigate, it couldn't counter advanced illusions. Who could resist such benefits?

But the tree's dozen legs outpaced his two. The skeleton insisted on capturing it alive for sustained harvesting, preventing him from simply cutting it down.

Their chase lasted indeterminably long, Lin Shan abandoning his compass to focus on the prize—until suddenly plunging into another space.

The starry void replaced white winds. Losing the tree, Lin Shan stood bewildered amidst cosmic vastness, countless stars twinkling as the familiar cold darkness of space unfolded beneath him.

Before he could process this, intense light erupted nearby. Shielding his eyes, he beheld a massive white formation—millions upon millions of white-robed, silver-helmed cultivators arrayed in perfect order, their capes billowing without wind.

Most shockingly, each soldier projected a transparent Dharma Idol—a Nascent Soul hallmark. This implied an army of millions at minimum Nascent Soul level!

"Such elaborate illusions for one Foundation Establishment cultivator?" Lin Shan still assumed this was illusion—cosmic armies of Nascent Souls seemed impossible.

But then the entire army turned toward him, commanders' flags sweeping down as countless divine abilities lit the cosmos, torrents of power surging past him toward something behind.

Turning, he saw a white elliptical ring anchored in space, weathering the onslaught unmoved. From its center emerged a futuristic saucer—its sleek design, electromagnetic railguns, nuclear propulsion, and observation windows revealing blue-uniformed officers monitoring holographic displays.

"A mirage?!" The skeleton trembled, recognizing this as a spacetime anomaly projecting real events—past or present.

As they watched, the saucer accelerated away like a blue comet. From the cultivator army emerged a scholarly-robed man who simply raised his hand—all starlight vanished as absolute darkness engulfed space.

One hundred-thousandth of a second later, the distant saucer exploded into cosmic fireworks.

"Immortal Court Supreme!" The skeleton's voice shook with awe.
