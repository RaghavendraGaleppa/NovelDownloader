# Chapter 136: The Buddhist Son

After exchanging opinions with Tian Ling on whose tongue was smoother, and presented with ironclad evidence, Zhou Tian had to admit that his tongue was indeed a little smoother. He apologized to Tian Ling, acknowledging that he was truly a glib-tongued person, and then the two temporarily parted ways.

Ling Yu and Mu Su were still waiting for him to deal with their situation. Led by a servant, Zhou Tian arrived at the temporary residence arranged for Mu Su and Ling Yu.

Since the two were Zhou Tian's friends, the accommodations were quite good. Both were currently in Mu Su's room; of course, they had simply arrived in a strange place and were sticking together for warmth as people from the same origin. They weren't doing anything improper, which left Zhou Tian slightly disappointed.

"Zhou Tian, you're here..."

Seeing Zhou Tian arrive, both stood up to greet him, their gazes somewhat complex.

Zhou Tian said with a touch of apology, "My apologies, both of you. Things happened very suddenly; I didn't expect to encounter a Saint Devil, which led to your involvement." He truly felt regret towards Ling Yu and Mu Su, not feigning his attitude.

"It's fine, nothing happened to us," Ling Yu replied. The appearance of the Saint Devil was truly unexpected for them. One moment they were considering how to contend for divine positions, the next they were here. Such is the impermanence of life. Although Ling Yu was somewhat indignant about suffering this unprovoked disaster, she had also personally witnessed Zhou Tian constantly striving to preserve their lives. Most crucially, this was now Zhou Tian's territory, so why would she show resentment?

"Regardless, this matter is indeed my responsibility. It's just that the outside world is a bit chaotic these days, so you might have to stay here for a while," Zhou Tian said, feeling a bit awkward. He had promised to take them to the Hall of Gods, but now he had broken his word. Although it wasn't his fault, it still left him feeling guilty. "But rest assured, once the Hall of Gods reopens, I will definitely secure divine positions for you. I understand your mother's wishes, Mu Su, and I will handle them. I will never break my promise to you."

Zhou Tian made his commitment. Though he could be a bit playful at times, he still had his bottom line. Treating others with integrity, just as he expected to be treated, had been Zhou Tian's code of conduct in his previous life.

"...Thank you!"

Ling Yu and Mu Su were silent for a long time, eventually sighing out their gratitude. Given the current situation, Zhou Tian had no need to deceive them, and they could also discern the vastness of the power behind Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian did not linger there. He could see that Ling Yu and Mu Su's attitudes toward him had subtly changed. He felt helpless about this change, as it was a shift in their inner thoughts, which no one could alter.

Upon leaving Mu Su's place, Zhou Tian ran into Zhou Zui, who was looking for him and seemed to be in a hurry.

"Zhou Tian, hurry up and come with me!"

Zhou Zui saw Zhou Tian and, without a word, a stream of pale golden light emanated from his hand, forming a protective barrier around them. Then, he directly ascended into the sky.

"What's the rush? Has Liu Yan found another man?" Zhou Tian asked, finally finding a chance to speak, surprised.

"How could that be? Zhou Xunchuan is going to fight one of Luotian Temple's Buddhist Sons today. This is a rare battle!" Zhou Zui explained. "The battle was originally scheduled for tomorrow, but they heard you were back, so they specifically moved up the time, to welcome your return with a victory."

Welcome my return with a battle victory, how… Zhou Tian was speechless. Since they had already gone to such lengths, how could he refuse to go?

"Are our people having a conflict with the monks from Luotian Temple? Why would they arrange a battle?" Zhou Tian asked.

"No, it's just that you're aware of the current situation. We can only move within the range covered by the grand formation. We can't go to distant places, so we're bored out of our minds every day. We either go look for wandering Saint Spirits with low combat power to fight, or we arrange battles with each other. This is the only way to pass the time."

The distance wasn't too far. The arena wasn't on the ground, but floated in the sky, resembling an inverted cone-shaped mountain peak, with four thick Profound Iron Divine Chains extending into the azure heavens.

Many people were already there, their eyes sparkling brightly, heads gleaming with divine light, and vital energy soaring to the heavens. There were also those with single horns on their heads or divine wings on their backs; most were Special Saint Bodies, possessing organs different from ordinary people, endowed with mysterious and unfathomable power. They all stood proudly, their aura vast and formidable. These were the contemporary prodigies of the Eight Great Powers.

They were mostly scattered around, looking down disdainfully in all directions, except for one bustling area, where shouts like those of mortal vendors could be heard.

"There's still fifteen minutes until the battle begins! Those who haven't placed their bets, hurry up! One side is the Son of the Qin Emperor, the other is a Contemporary Buddhist Son. Both have peerless reputations! The odds are 1:1; the more you bet, the more you gain! Come on, hurry!"

Many people had already gathered, not just the young prodigies of the Eight Great Powers, but also some rogue cultivators from Kyushu, taking out various rare items to bet.

"These are people from Gathering Treasure Pavilion. Only they would abandon their so-called dignity as powerful cultivators and act like vendors. Let's go, we'll place a bet too."

"Nine out of ten bets are scams. Cherish life, stay away from gambling." Zhou Tian righteously refused, but Zhou Zui had already crowded forward. With the thought of not letting Zhou Zui get drawn into it, Zhou Tian also joined the crowd.

The one setting up the gambling den was a thin young man with a flag planted behind him, bearing a large inscription: "Gathering Treasure Pavilion, Li Rulong."

Zhou Tian was speechless. No wonder there were so many people; he had announced his affiliation and name. Gathering Treasure Pavilion valued its reputation above all else and would certainly never renege on a debt, nor would it allow its subordinates to do so.

"One gram of Azure Source Ancient Gold, betting on the Luotian Temple Buddhist Son to win. Alright, please keep your redemption slip." The young man named Li Rulong expertly took a small, shimmering piece of green light mixed with golden specks from a middle-aged man's hand. He placed it into a bronze, dark-gold toad statue in front of him. The toad's eyes flashed gold, and it spat out a jade token, which he handed to the middle-aged man.

"Ten grams of Dark-Veined Azure Dragon Iron, betting on Zhou Xunchuan to win." Zhou Zui flipped his hand, producing a piece of blue iron with black纹路. A faint dragon's roar seemed to emanate from it, shaking the surroundings and drawing everyone's attention. This was a precious material that could even serve as a primary component when forging Saint King-grade weapons. Although not large, it was definitely considered a rarity. However, upon recognizing Zhou Zui, everyone was appeased, understanding that his financial resources certainly allowed him to possess such an item.

But the gazes directed at Zhou Tian, who stood beside Zhou Zui, were somewhat bewildered; they didn't have much of an impression of him.

"I remember now, isn't he that cripple from King Qin's..." Someone spoke, but did not finish, because Zhou Zui's chilling gaze had already swept over. The speaker was a rogue cultivator from Futian Province and dared not offend Heavenly Qin.

"What, you won't even let people speak? Isn't he just the crippled son of the Heavenly Qin's King Qin? What's there not to say?" Not everyone belonged to Futian Province; there were always some who, for some purpose, spoke in mockery.

"Are you looking for death?" Zhou Zui's eyes were cold. The man's gaze shrank, but he retorted stubbornly,

"What, are you going to throw your weight around?"

Zhou Tian frowned and pulled Zhou Zui back. "Just a dog barking; no need to pay attention." This person harbored ill intentions. If they were to act, it might make them a target of public criticism. Zhou Tian hadn't expected the atmosphere here to be so unfriendly. He hadn't yet fully grasped the situation of this place; after all, it wasn't his familiar turf in Heavenly Qin, where he could handle anything. The identities of the people here were no lower than his, but he wasn't afraid. If truly provoked, with his "thirty-one-second true man" ability, he'd never feared anyone.

Some truly distinguished prodigies didn't speak, nor did they even pay attention to this area. For example, a young man in the southeast corner sat cross-legged in the void, his eyes closed, his entire body wreathed in chaotic energy. That section of space seemed to be compressed by his presence, and no one dared to stand within dozens of meters of him. From the moment Zhou Tian arrived, this young man had not moved, as if nothing could disturb his inner peace.

"Om Mani Padme Hum."

A burst of Buddhist chants drifted over. From the northwest, a bald monk in white robes approached through the air, barefoot, his eyes seemed neither fully open nor fully closed, his hands clasped in prayer. Buddhist chants seemed to emanate from the nine heavens, accompanying him.

"This is Master She Yin, one of Luotian Temple's three Buddhist Sons. It is said that his Buddhist Dharma has reached the pinnacle. He once subdued a Saint-level fierce beast with just a single Buddhist chant and is highly regarded by several ancient Buddhas of Luotian Temple." Someone exclaimed, as this person's reputation preceded him, and many had heard of him.

Upon stepping onto the floating mountain peak, She Yin did not converse with anyone. Instead, he found a secluded spot, sat down cross-legged, and quietly chanted scriptures. Phantom images of ancient Buddhas and Bodhisattvas encircled him, as if he were establishing a Buddhist kingdom on earth.

"Why didn't we keep him back then?" Zhou Tian nudged Zhou Zui beside him and asked. Although the question seemed out of the blue, Zhou Zui understood.

"Keeping a few insignificant monks is fine, but if we were to keep him, those old monks in death seclusion would surely rush out and fight us to the death."

"Don't they advocate for all sentient beings being equal?"

"They do. All living beings are equal to one of *them*. No problem there."

Zhou Tian was speechless. Zhou Zui really could talk nonsense.
