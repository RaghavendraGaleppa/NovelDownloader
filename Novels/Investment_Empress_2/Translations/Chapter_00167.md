# Chapter 167: The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me!

Several carriages pulled by exotic spirit beasts were parked outside the Autumn Water Pavilion. The chief disciples from various peaks had already gathered.

In truth, a martial artist at the Divine Perception Realm could travel faster than a carriage. However, enduring the wind and sun along the way would inevitably leave one covered in dust, ruining their dignified demeanor. At an event like the Martial Arts Summit, everyone present was a person of status...

"Senior Brother Ouyang, you're bringing so many things with you?"

Li Mo walked out of the Autumn Water Pavilion with nothing but the clothes on his back. Among the senior brothers and sisters present, he was only familiar with Ouyang. If a certain disciple from the Rare Beast Peak were still here, he would have had one more acquaintance.

"The Spatial Treasures are so expensive, how could I afford to buy one?" Ouyang sighed.

"Cough, didn't you earn quite a bit recently? All spent already?"

"You know I run a small business. I didn't earn much to begin with."

"Have you considered finding a bookstore for mass printing? With your drawing skills, Senior Brother Ouyang, it should sell very well."

"I have no problem with that, I'm just afraid the Great Yu Dynasty's laws wouldn't approve..."

"It doesn't necessarily have to be... cough... that kind of book."

"Oh? Do you have a brilliant idea, Junior Brother Li?"

The two chatted idly as they boarded the carriage. Senior Brother Ouyang's thirst for knowledge was insatiable. Little Li was more than happy to share his advanced storytelling experience. After all, if Senior Brother Ouyang made money, it counted as his investment.

Meanwhile, by the other carriages, everyone was exchanging pleasantries.

"Senior Brother Shen Yunfei, you secured a spot last time you went to Hengyun Sword City. You're practically a shoo-in this time too, right?"

"How could I dare claim that? But Senior Sister Xu Zhiqing, after years of seclusion, must have cultivated a formidable Sword Intent."

"Alas, there might be a few prodigies from the Hidden Dragon List coming to the Sword Trial this time. Just getting to witness the风采 of these prodigies would make this trip worthwhile."

Suddenly, everyone fell silent.

Because not far away, a少女 walking over with a sword in her arms.

The chief disciples inexplicably held their tongues. For some reason, facing Ying Bing made them more nervous than facing the Sect Master.

After all, the Sect Master was of a higher realm, but not of their generation.

They had just been talking about the prodigies of the Hidden Dragon List. Yet, the moment she appeared, it made one feel that the Hidden Dragon List was nothing special...

...

After Ying Bing arrived, the carriages slowly set off.

中途, Li Mo distanced himself from the convoy and went to a hotpot restaurant.

Upon learning that she could travel the martial world with Brother Li, Jiang Chulong was so happy her mind went blank. She immediately went to carry her small backpack, not even having time to change her clothes.

Just as the two were about to walk out of the hotpot restaurant, Li Mo felt his clothes being tightly tugged by Jiang Chulong.

What was wrong?

He touched the back of his head and realized Mei Yun was frowning, looking at the two of them with a stern gaze. The words "Do you think I'm invisible?" were practically written on her face.

"How has the hotpot restaurant's business been lately?" Li Mo asked awkwardly.

"Decent. A profit of twenty taels a month." Mei Yun was still frowning.

Li Mo looked at the bustling restaurant, feeling a bit confused. When he opened the hotpot restaurant, he never bothered with the accounts. Was the profit really that low?

"Following the recipes you gave, the ingredients have to be the best, and after paying all sorts of taxes to the government..." Mei Yun shook her head, not dwelling on these issues. She sighed softly, "Actually, I don't want Chulong to go to Yunzhou with you."

Recently, Chulong's progress in the Sword Dao has been immense, far more terrifying than she had imagined. Back then, the Matriarch was a celestial genius, and she was in a Sword Dao holy land like the Tianshan Sword Manor, yet she was still inferior to Chulong. Once Chulong enters Hengyun Sword City, it would be impossible for her not to stand out.

"Once one enters the martial world, many things become身不由己."

"Where there are people, there is a martial world." Li Mo subconsciously replied.

Mei Yun pondered this phrase, narrowing her eyes.

Jiang Chulong bit her lip. Through the cloth bandages, one could see the plea in her gray-white eyes: "Auntie Mei..."

After a moment of silence, Mei Yun seemed to have come to a realization and sighed.

---

"Fine, you may go. But you must promise me a few things."

She gave many instructions before finally letting her go.

...

Night fell.

The carriage traveled on the broad official road. The low-key yet luxurious carriage compartment blocked out the noise from outside, making the interior seem even quieter.

Li Mo put down his tea cup. What filled his vision was Ying Bing's perfect jade-like face, and not far from her, Jiang Chulong curled up, afraid of dirtying or damaging anything.

Mmm...

Ouyang, who was sketching and drawing, was subconsciously ignored.

"Ice Cube, can we discuss something?" Li Mo suddenly spoke.

"Go ahead." Ying Bing glanced sideways, her willow-like brows slightly raised.

Jiang Chulong tilted her head in confusion, finding it a bit strange. Ever since they got on the carriage, Brother Li and this cold sister hadn't said a word to each other.

Li Mo said helplessly, "Can we, in the future, cancel the part where we hit... certain areas... when we spar with the sword?"

Instantly, Ying Bing's fingers curled up reflexively. That numbing sensation at the base of her spine seemed to be surging back up.

"I... I've already forgotten about it. Why would I blame you?" Li Mo: "...."

With that said, my butt would have an opinion.

You don't remember, but you hold a grudge, is that it?

"By the way, Junior Brother Li." Ouyang suddenly spoke.

"Hm?" Li Mo turned his head, almost forgetting there was someone else in the carriage.

Ouyang held his drawing board and said苦恼ly, "You know I'm only good at drawing, Junior Brother Li. I'm really not good at storytelling."

Li Mo's suggestion to him was to make picture books. The literacy rate in the Great Yu Dynasty wasn't high, which created a barrier for the spread of novels. If they were to switch to picture books, even ordinary people could understand them. It was a complete dimensional reduction attack!

"Stories..." Li Mo thought for a moment, glanced at the Ice Cube, and said, "How about I write one for you?"

The Ice Cube seemed to enjoy listening to storytellers. This was perfect, as Senior Brother Ouyang needed material. It was a win-win!

"Ah?" Ouyang was stunned.

Li Mo smiled. "This junior brother is not talented, but I once had a work that was deeply loved by readers."

"What work?"

"*The Empress Returns*."

Jiang Chulong blinked, feeling curious. The story Brother Li was about to tell seemed different from her teacher's.

Ying Bing: "...."

She found that she actually remembered the plot. A double harvest of career and love...

Ouyang: "!"

Just from the name, it sounded very promising.

"However, the story I'm going to tell today is not that one." Little Li's performer personality took over, transforming into a storyteller in a second. He had already decided what to tell. In a later era, this might be a cliché, but in this era, it would be earth-shattering!

"What is it then?" Ouyang quickly offered tea.

Li Mo cleared his throat:

"This story is called... *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*!"

Ying Bing: "!"

*Clang*—

The teacup in her hand fell to the ground in her moment of distraction.

PS: We're approaching a major plot point again. The little author is taking a short break. I'll only update two chapters today to adjust my state and sort out the plot, then go to bed early. Mwah.
