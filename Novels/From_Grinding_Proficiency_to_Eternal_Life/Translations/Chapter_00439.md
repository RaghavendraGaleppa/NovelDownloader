# Chapter 439: The True Lord's Entanglement

"The True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra encompasses all things; it is not limited to techniques of slaughter."

Xu Yunfan's voice carried a metallic resonance beneath the starlight. "Its fist techniques can summon the power of the Big Dipper to manifest the true form of the Black Tortoise. Its palm techniques secretly align with the changes of the Four Symbols. Treading the Yu Step can connect with the earth's veins, while the sword incantation directly points to the path of slaying souls with the Great Yin. The True Martial Subdues Demons Sword Art can be considered a path of the immortal sword."

As he spoke, a thread of spiritual power rippled between his fingers. With his explanation, it continuously evolved, sometimes transforming into the Demon-Subduing Seal of intertwined turtle and snake, and at other times becoming the推演盘 (calculation plate) of the Twenty-Eight Mansions' rotation.

The old monsters saw clearly that within the starlight, there were actually Cloud Veil Talismans that concealed heavenly secrets, and patterns of Gang and Sha that could summon thunder and fire.

"The Way of True Martial is a blend of hardness and softness."

Xu Yunfan suddenly merged his fingers into a sword shape, his spiritual power instantly condensing into a three-foot-long green锋 (edge). "Hardness can subdue demons and guard the Way; softness can nurture life."

The sword edge turned, transforming into sweet dew that rained down. The decaying joints of the众人 (crowd) immediately emitted crisp sounds like new buds sprouting and branches growing.

After finishing the explanation and answering everyone's questions one by one, the moon was already high in the sky.

Xu Yunfan did not return to his cave dwelling but instead rode a beam of light straight for White岳 Peak.

As the light swept past the seventy-two spiritual waterfalls, it startled the patrolling spiritual cranes into scattering.

The White岳 True Lord was refining the "Ten Thousand Mountains True Form Map" at the peak. Seeing the Black Tortoise light break through the air and arrive, he extended a wisp of his spiritual sense. When he received the information that there was an important matter to report, his eyes flickered, and he largely guessed the purpose of the other's visit.

The White岳 True Lord, Chu Chengnan, had not yet dispersed the hand seal he was掐 (pinching). The Ten Thousand Mountains True Form Map slowly rolled up in mid-air.

He raised his eyes to look at Xu Yunfan, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes. "Junior Brother Xu, visiting late at night, has some change occurred?"

This old fox. Even if he couldn't deduce it, he could probably guess the gist.

Xu Yunfan cursed inwardly, cupping his fists in salute. "Senior Brother Chu, I was ambushed by a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Primordial Origin Sect in the Divine Martial World."

He flipped his palm and summoned the black banner. The blood-fiend energy remaining on the banner immediately filled the hall. Hundreds of vengeful spirits and fiend demons rolled and churned on the banner surface, causing black energy to roll in billows.

The White岳 True Lord, Chu Chengnan, looked at this with a hint of approval in his expression. This Junior Brother Xu had a very strong adaptability. In just this short time, he had already refined a Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

He is truly a disciple of my Primordial Origin Sect.

If not for a True Lord calculating his origins and confirming he was truly a native of the Divine Martial World, he would have thought he was the reincarnation of some Foundation Establishment True Lord from a demonic sect.

After all, materials for a Ten Thousand Soul Banner are rare. If refined properly, it could potentially become a spiritual treasure that can cover the sky and hide the sun in the future.

As long as one is a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, almost everyone will find a way to forge one.

Everyone is from the Primordial Origin Sect; such matters are already习以为常 (a common practice).

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. He shook the black banner, quickly retracting the black energy while releasing several wisps of the Purple Robed True Lord's aura.

That was all he had; the man had been reduced to ashes by him.

Sensing these few wisps of aura, the White岳 True Lord frowned slightly, and a three-inch golden light suddenly burst from his fingertips.

He looked at Xu Yunfan.

After getting Xu Yunfan's nod, the golden light, like a spirit snake, wrapped around the black banner, outlining seven ferocious ghost faces on the surface.

"No... this hides..."

As if想到了 (remembering) something, the White岳 True Lord suddenly stopped speaking, only sneering.

"What a method of grafting and transposition!"

He formed a seal and struck out a sound-isolating restriction, then set up multiple prohibition arrays. After confirming that the inside and outside were isolated and heavenly secrets could not penetrate, he asked, "Tell me in detail, did that Foundation Establishment cultivator use any special cultivation techniques?"

Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense moved slightly, and the battle scene immediately浮现 (materialized) in the black banner: "When that person summoned the Blood River Great Array, he crushed a jade pendant carved with twin lotus flowers."

This was true. When that Purple Robed Foundation Establishment True Lord said the True Lord had harmed him, a jade pendant in his hand shattered.

"Twin lotus flowers?!"

The White岳 True Lord's expression quickly turned grave.

He took a deep breath, and three golden talismans flew out from his sleeve, actually burning themselves out in the air. "This matter must be reported to the True Lord immediately! This is not something we can handle. It seems the other side is preparing to make a move."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed. The White岳 True Lord's expression was enough to说明 (indicate) that the other party knew someone had invaded the Divine Martial World.

This was a test, and also a pledge of allegiance.

A golden talisman flew out from the White岳 True Lord's sleeve. "This matter must be reported to the Clear Source True Lord immediately!"

As the golden talisman burned out, the sea of clouds at the peak suddenly parted to the sides.

A clear qi descended from the nine heavens, condensing into the illusion of jade steps and red stairs in the air.

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped onto the jade steps, the surrounding scenery changed drastically. He was already in the "Clear Source Immortal Palace" floating above the sea of clouds.

Looking up, there was a glazed plaque above the palace, inscribed with 'Clear Source Mysterious Way Carrying Fate Profound穹 True Lord'.

The glazed tiles of the main hall of the Immortal Palace flowed with the clear light of heaven and earth.

The blue-robed Taoist sitting in the hall slowly opened his eyes. A cinnabar mole on his forehead made the entire hall flicker.

After following the White岳 True Lord into the Immortal Palace, Xu Yunfan did not dare to be negligent.

"Disciple pays respects to the Clear Source True Lord."

As Xu Yunfan performed the salute, he noticed that the "Carrying Fate Lamp" before the True Lord, which never extinguished for three thousand years, now had a flame showing a phase of interwoven青 (azure) and black.

A heavenly secret treasure!

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. The extraordinary nature burning in that lamp was such that just a fleeting glance caused a feeling of infinite mystery to surge in his heart.

The Clear Source True Lord nodded slightly.

"Detail the process of the ambush."

When Xu Yunfan spoke of the Foundation Establishment cultivator refined in the blood banner, a clear chime of a jade chime suddenly rang through the hall.

A "Dongxuan Mirror" flew out from the True Lord's sleeve. The mirror light illuminated the residual fiendish energy of the blood banner with extreme clarity.

"It's not the style of the Primordial Demon Sect. It's a bit like covering one's ears to steal a bell."

Finally, as if remembering something, he chuckled lightly. "It seems it was left behind intentionally."

The Clear Source True Lord's smile grew colder.

He formed a seal to summon the mirror light. The surrounding clear qi in the hall's ceiling began to rotate.

"Heavenly secrets have been obscured..."

The mirror surface suddenly cracked with a spiderweb-like pattern.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. He clearly saw half a woman's face flash within the cracks. The cinnabar mole on her forehead was identical to the Clear Source True Lord's.

"So it is her."

The Clear Source True Lord's expression was complex. He sighed and waved his sleeve to repair the treasure mirror. "That bitch Jiuyuan is using the Samsara Mirror to stir up heavenly secrets again."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's puzzled expression, the True Lord said meaningfully, "Do you know why my Dao title contains the words 'Carrying Fate'?"

The White岳 True Lord beside him, upon seeing this, naturally didn't say a word, obviously knowing the inside story.

"Back then, I and Jiuyuan studied the 'Supreme Ultimate Golden Flower Purpose' together. We combined dragon and tiger, yin and yang, and it was originally just a mutually beneficial dual cultivation. But she insisted on refining that useless Book of Fate."

After saying just this one complaint, the Clear Source True Lord stopped, clearly impatient.

Xu Yunfan naturally dared not interrupt. This was the other party's private matter. In just a short sentence, it naturally made his mind race with speculation.

Jiuyuan.

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, there is only one with this title, addressed as the Nine Abyss Mysterious Sha Illuminating True Lord.

The romantic entanglement of these two True Lords made him feel it was both ridiculous and funny.

The next moment, an overwhelming force of the clear qi of heaven and earth poured into him from above. The True Martial spiritual power in Xu Yunfan's气海 (qi sea) instantly boiled, and the Black Tortoise phantom actually manifested a实体 (physical form) behind him.
