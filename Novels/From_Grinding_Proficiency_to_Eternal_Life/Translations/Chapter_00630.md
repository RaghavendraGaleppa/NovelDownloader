# Chapter 630: Pure Immortal Gold Nature

Cultivators operate on the principle of swallowing a Golden Core into their dantian, believing that "my fate is in my own hands, not in the heavens." They emphasize that all great powers should be归于自身 (return to the self). In contrast, the cultivation in this world relies on Divine Spheres and the power of faith and belief, which can be said to be deeply bound to the Great World itself.

From this, it can also be seen that the control the Heavenly Dao of this world exerts over the Transcendents is far beyond that of the cultivators in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, who only think of exploiting the heavens. These are two completely different extremes. The Taihua Spirit Ruins World, having produced Nascent Soul Dao Lords, is fundamentally unable to be controlled. It is more like a cooperative relationship with the cultivators. In contrast, the Great World of Aitila controls these Transcendent Gods through Divine Spheres, a system of form bestowed by the Heavenly Dao.

Here, the Heavenly Dao is the one and only master.

Delice curled up on the ground. The agony of having her Divine Sphere stripped from her soul had not yet fully subsided. The lingering tearing sensation made every wisp of her consciousness tremble, causing her muscles to spasm from time to time.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan reached out and pinched Delice. She watched helplessly as Xu Yunfan's fingertips pinched that wisp of something that had been pulled out from the core of her Divine Sphere.

A wisp of clear, pure golden thread of light, radiating an aura of eternal immortality.

It was the foundation she had spent nearly a thousand years meticulously collecting and purifying the devout faith and belief of the townspeople, ultimately condensing it into her very foundation. It was the essential essence of her immortal divinity.

Her divinity was being stripped away!

Looking at the wisp of pure, clear golden thread of light radiating an aura of eternal immortality that lingered around his fingertips, Xu Yunfan's gaze was focused and filled with delight.

This was a good thing. In the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, even Foundation Establishment cultivators would fight over it, and the originally loving fellow disciples of the Primordial Sect would instantly tear their faces apart.

The value of this wisp of Immortal Gold Nature stripped from the core of Delice's Divine Sphere far exceeded the sum of her thousand years of accumulated faith and belief power.

It was pure and condensed, without any imprint of the Aitila Great World. It was the most ideal resource for constructing a Heavenly Dao and knocking open the door to the peak of Foundation Establishment.

This kind of attributeless, consciousness-free Immortal Gold Nature is a perfect fuel. Using it to condense one's own Immortal Gold Nature would be without the slightest obstruction.

A new Great World is indeed full of treasures everywhere.

"My divinity!"

Delice slumped to the ground. The rapid emptiness of divine power within her filled her with desolation. Her miserable cries echoed in the empty church, but they could not move Xu Yunfan in the slightest.

She clearly felt her most core power source being forcibly pulled away. The power source that supported her divine position, as if its foundation had been dug out, instantly became precarious and its divine light dimmed.

Xu Yunfan's gaze remained on that wisp of gold nature, his tone flat without a single ripple.

"What are you howling about? I didn't touch the root of your Divine Sphere. I just extracted a bit of the immortal interest nurtured within your Divine Sphere. The matter of you hitting me earlier isn't over yet. This is just a little compensation."

His fingertip moved slightly, and the wisp of gold nature, like a living creature, was wrapped and confined by his spiritual power, and put away into his sleeve.

Upon hearing this, an indescribable bitterness and anger blocked Delice's chest, but she couldn't even muster the courage to retort.

The existence before her was far beyond the limits of her understanding.

It was definitely an Upper God-level existence.

那种渊深似海，视神灵如草芥的威压，她只在那些统御一方神域的上位神身上感受过些许，甚至可能还犹有过之。

She could only curl up in the corner, watching helplessly as the Immortal Gold Nature she had accumulated for nearly a thousand years, which she considered the root of her life, was stripped away by Xu Yunfan. Her heart was filled with icy despair.

It was the foundation she had spent countless efforts on, doing so many practical things for her believers, from which the faith and belief of her believers had condensed. Now, it was all for naught, turning into a wedding gown for others.

Not waiting for her to recover from this huge blow and humiliation, and not giving her any chance to explain or beg for mercy, Xu Yunfan had already made his move.

Xu Yunfan placed one hand on Delice's golden hair, and then his Divine Sense, like a cold steel needle, instantly pierced into the depths of Delice's soul.

The opponent's consciousness was instantly搅得一片混沌 (stirred into a chaotic mess).

Finally, the dark banner surface of the Star Spirit Banner rolled up, and Delice's remaining soul consciousness, like smoke and dust, was forcibly pulled out. Together with her Divine Sphere, which had lost its core divinity, its light obviously dimmed, and was filled with mottled and chaotic faith and belief power, it was thrown into the banner, turning into a new Banner Spirit within it.

In this way, the Divine Sphere formed when Delice ignited her Divine Fire and was bestowed by the Heavenly Dao of this world was completely squeezed out by the Star Spirit Banner.

Xu Yunfan's Divine Sense swept through the Star Spirit Banner, carefully examining the Divine Sphere that had been stripped out.

Just as he had expected, although this Divine Sphere carried the imprints of the god's authority, its core was composed of massive, mixed, and chaotic incense and faith power.

These belief powers were filled with the seven emotions and six desires of mortals, prayers, and distractions. They were harmful and useless to Xu Yunfan's own cultivation. Forcibly absorbing them would only pollute his Dao Foundation and ruin his spiritual power and cultivation.

However, it wasn't unusable. On the contrary, it could be used as quite good fuel.

The belief power of this divinity itself, however, was an extremely high-grade material for refining artifacts.

"As expected, it's a useless thing, but it's quite suitable for strengthening magical artifacts, especially for a magical artifact like the Star Spirit Banner that needs to accommodate thousands of souls and spirits."

After all, the Star Spirit Banner is not picky, especially with these kinds of incense and belief powers.

Xu Yunfan's heart moved slightly. If he used this to condense Zhang Ziyang's physical body, it would probably be enough as well.

Ignoring the resentful gaze of Delice's Star Spirit within the banner, Xu Yunfan gave her a slight smile.

This kind of 'big洋马', he hadn't had any contact with in his previous life. This time, he definitely had to have a good exchange with it.

The Heavenly Empress, who had been silent beside him, secretly spat when she saw Xu Yunfan's familiar smile.

*Shameless rascal.*

What Xu Yunfan施展 next was the supreme true scripture from the Primordial Sect's Hundred Desires Peak, the *True Scripture of Heaven and Earth's Mutual Conquest and Yin-Yang Separation and Union*.

This was not an ordinary dual cultivation technique, but a deeper level of exchange, a fusion of body and god.

As his spiritual power circulated, Yin and Yang qi flowed, forming a profound force field that enveloped Delice.

Repeated dozens of times, in-depth analysis,牵引 (traction), and separation.

With each in-depth exploration, Delice's deepest memories, as well as her innate understanding of the power system of the Aitila Great World, information about the magic circles, the divine system structure, and the distribution of other weak gods in the surrounding areas, were all forcibly榨取 (squeezed) and pulled out, merging into Xu Yunfan's sea of consciousness.

For Delice, this process was continuous. After all, how could such a matter be clearly explained.

This was a desecration that pierced through the soul. Her own spirituality was worn away even more thoroughly in the repetition.

It could be said to be a form of 'other kind of enlightenment.'

For Xu Yunfan, however, this was merely an efficient intelligence gathering and knowledge duplication.

After all, even though Delice was weak, she was once a formal god who had ignited her Divine Fire and condensed her Divine Sphere. Her knowledge reserve was equivalent to a Foundation Establishment初期 (initial stage) cultivator who had初步 condensed (preliminarily condensed) his Dao Foundation in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Moreover, relying on her Divine Sphere and divinity, her lifespan was twice that of an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator. Five lifetimes of reincarnation would only be about half of her lifespan.
