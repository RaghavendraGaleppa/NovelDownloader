# Chapter 183: A Wish Fulfilled

Under the night mist, in the main hall of the divine temple, the white-clad woman noticed that Qin Ming, facing her, was exceptionally excited and bellicose, as if he had been injected with a surge of energy. Heavenly Light Energy flowed within her, becoming extremely dangerous. It was truly outrageous; someone actually looked forward to facing her!

She uttered only one word: "Come."

"Great!" Qin Ming's eyes blazed with fervent light. Facing such an "Ancestor Master" in a battle of similar cultivation levels, he wished he could spar with her for three days and three nights. He charged forward like a streak of light, carrying Thunderfire Energy and Wind Energy, with Overlord Energy as his core, as valiant as an overlord reborn.

The white-clad woman secretly gritted her teeth. No one had ever dared to be so excited when facing her!

Beneath her tattered plain white dress, her legs, shapely and long, strode out, moving as if she were treading on lightning, her speed incredibly swift.

Whoosh!

This time, she unleashed an unfathomable strike right from the start. As her bare hand swept past, it seemed to cleave a line across the sky. The light appeared peaceful at first, but later, it gained an unstoppable momentum capable of shattering anything!

Qin Ming sensed danger. After unleashing Thunderfire at her, he sidestepped, continuously shifting his position. Even so, a lock of his hair was still severed, as that special beam of light flew past, grazing his cheek. He suspected this might be an energy technique from the *Sky Severing Strategy*, comparable to Buddha's Energy and Jade Purity Energy. Moreover, his opponent had cultivated it to a profound level. Could someone who had only undergone seven rebirths truly unleash something like this?

The white-clad woman felt a slight twinge of guilt. She had indeed crossed a red line again. She didn't continue, instead switching to another energy technique.

However, Qin Ming had grown serious. Concerned that such an "Ancestor Master" might indeed be able to cultivate to such a perfect level, his Heavenly Light Energy began to boil. He unleashed twelve-tenths of his power, treating it as a life-or-death decisive battle! In an instant, the vitality of his entire body's flesh and blood surged. It was as if he was bathed in light from beyond the mortal realm, his essence, qi, and spirit seeming to burn. He was forced into a "back-to-the-wall battle"!

One, feeling guilty, changed her technique, while the other went all out. With one retreating and the other advancing, both sides misjudged the situation. As a result, in this clash and direct confrontation, the white-clad woman suffered a great loss.

Crackling!

Throughout the divine temple, Heavenly Light Energy raged. Qin Ming's every punch was like a blazing sun, every palm like a celestial blade. Burning his bridges, he adopted a stance as if intending to fight the Ancestor Master to the death.

The white-clad woman felt as if struck by lightning this time, her entire body trembling. The sleeves, already singed by Thunderfire, further burst apart, almost fully exposing her snow-white shoulders. She couldn't help but grit her teeth. Was this guy a martial arts fanatic? Once engaged in combat, he forgot everything, caring not whether she was the Temple Lord. His gaze was fiery, as if he longed to press a palm onto her head and suppress her.

Whoosh!

Qin Ming's glowing palm-blade swept past, burying itself in her dark, beautiful hair, touching her ear. This startled her into instantly accelerating. She evaded with mysterious and unfathomable footwork, like a phantom crossing a sea of mist, vanishing with every step. Even so, a lock of her hair was still shorn off. Moreover, at that last critical moment, Qin Ming's fingers were already close to her snow-white, delicate neck. Heavenly Light Energy surged forth, nearly causing her to bleed instantly.

At that instant, a strange light flowed over her body. It was a few Pure Yang patterns spreading, transforming into a defense, resonating magnificently around her fair neck. Qin Ming's unleashed Heavenly Light Energy was devastating, like surging waves, one after another. That was because he had fused many types of Heavenly Light Energy, which were continuously stacking at this moment! Had the white-clad woman not crossed a red line by using that strange light to block, she would certainly have been extremely dishevelled this time.

Qin Ming's unified fusion technique had been tested by the Pure Yang patterns, proving its extremely high quality, even dimming that strange light. Furthermore, his fingertip ultimately touched a delicate spot. Unfortunately, the layers of Heavenly Light Energy he had unleashed in this attack were already exhausted, failing to pierce through that snow-white neck.

The white-clad woman escaped the crisis with her mysterious footwork, standing still in the distance, concrete beams of light shooting from her beautiful eyes. She looked at the lock of hair on the ground, then touched her own neck, snow-white and delicate as congealed fat. The opponent's finger had actually poked that spot. She mused, if she were truly someone on the path of rebirth, and her body had only mutated seven times, then she ought to be unable to withstand this youth. She had always been confident and exceedingly proud, having indeed thoroughly studied the path of rebirth. Thus, she believed she would have few rivals in this domain. Yet, the monstrous talent she encountered today severely shook her confidence.

"Senior, are you alright?" Qin Ming asked with concern. At the same time, he rubbed his hands together eagerly. The strange light that had appeared from his opponent at the critical moment was very special, and he wanted to try it again; it had actually managed to block his strongest Heavenly Light Energy. Mainly, the white-clad woman had concealed it, not revealing any Pure Yang aura, so he hadn't perceived the truth.

The white-clad woman had originally been considering whether to end it here, find an excuse to step down, and just count him as having passed. But then she found him growing even more excited, looking as if he intended to "deceive his master and destroy his ancestors". She felt this was intolerable! She truly couldn't understand why this guy had such a great interest in fighting her!

Mainly, Qin Ming's sense of crisis was strong. He consistently held himself to high standards, always taking the immortal seeds from the outer realms and the divine seeds of esoteric sects as his imagined opponents, aligning himself against them. He believed that the white-clad woman, in her current state, belonged to the "ancestral seed" level on the path of rebirth, ridiculously powerful. He wanted to use this opportunity to test himself and seriously gauge this opponent of similar cultivation. Once his belligerent spirit surged, he craved a thoroughly satisfying battle!

The white-clad woman was unaware of all this. She only knew that this guy had offended her, was extremely interested in blaspheming an ancestor master, and was determined to challenge authority.

"As you wish!" she said, clenching her pure white fist.

"Senior, you wouldn't be exceeding the limits, would you? What supreme art did you just use? I've never heard of those energy techniques on the path of rebirth," Qin Ming asked. His intuition was sharp, and he still harbored some doubts.

The white-clad woman felt a tightness in her chest. She truly felt a bit embarrassed for having crossed a red line. In the end, she decided to defeat this youth through her marvelous techniques, combat awareness, and subtle force.

"I won't overstep the boundary, rest assured. Come!" she said, then took the initiative to attack, stepping forward as terrestrial qi surged. She seemed to be moving by manipulating qi, her speed swift and graceful!

Qin Ming exclaimed in admiration: "This isn't the Wuji Sutra, but it has similarities! To be able to move by controlling terrestrial qi, and even use it this way... I think I understand how to adapt it now! Marvelous!" Then, he attempted to imitate it.

The white-clad woman was somewhat surprised. This guy's comprehension was exceptionally high. After seeing her technique once, he grasped its essence and extrapolated from it, reinterpreting it with other sutras. She smiled faintly, performing her art again, avoiding his frontal assaults and continuously breaking his techniques with subtle force. The white-clad woman's speed grew faster and faster, as she attacked around Qin Ming. Beneath her feet, besides terrestrial qi, there seemed to be lightning intertwining. But upon closer inspection, it wasn't lightning manifesting beneath her feet, but subterranean fire, a blinding crimson, spreading across the ground, burning fiercely, and finally, luminous mist rose up.

With a wave of her hand, a fierce gale raged in mid-air, and the night mist surged. Then, water vapor billowed as she consecutively unleashed Heavenly Wind Energy and Black Water Energy, derived from two marvelous techniques. Soon, Qin Ming understood what she intended to do. She had manifested four marvelous techniques, corresponding to: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water.

In an instant, four types of Heavenly Light Energy circulated, as if to cleave open the void and evolve all creation, carrying immense pressure. The four Heavenly Light Energies blossomed simultaneously, actually showing signs of evolving into a picturesque landscape of mountains and rivers. Heavenly Light Energy carrying such anomalous phenomena was somewhat astonishing. Normally, these wouldn't appear in the realm of rebirth, unless certain energy techniques were incredibly compatible, resonating with an out-of-bounds power for a brief moment.

Qin Ming instantly thought of manifesting the Five Elements with the five great marvelous techniques he had mastered, to directly confront her. However, his Heluo Energy had not yet reached great accomplishment. Each time, he had to borrow the power of the other four elements. In that case, the Five Elements would most likely fail to rotate properly. He still tried, forcefully activating the Five Elements, instantly illuminating a flawed light wheel that emitted five-colored shimmering light. In his palm, the five-colored light wheel appeared, blasting forward. Soon, Qin Ming's expression changed. Because, within the four types of Heavenly Light Energy manifested by the white-clad woman, yin and yang qi emerged, with black and white lights appearing and continuously shining.

The situation was critical. Qin Ming used the teachings from the silk scrolls to govern all his techniques, spreading them throughout his body. Finally, gold threads and jade light appeared on his body, as if he had donned a layer of battle armor. And beyond this "gold-threaded jade armor", twenty-seven divine halos emerged, layer upon layer, forming terrifying beams of light as he swung his fists.

Boom!

In this area, fierce winds raged, lightning flashed, thunder roared, and it even began to rain—that was due to the surging water mist. Within the main hall of the divine temple, various Heavenly Light Energies intertwined: Thunderfire, gale winds, terrestrial qi... continuously surged, like ebbing and flowing tides.

The white-clad woman was very dishevelled. Her dress was even more damaged this time, her snow-white calves exposed. Electric arcs clung to her hair, and flames intertwined on her face. With a cold snort, the area immediately became calm, and all Heavenly Light Energies extinguished.

"Senior!" Qin Ming sobered up, standing quietly there, feeling uncertain. Had he offended the Temple Lord this time? Even he, looking at her, felt he had been somewhat offensive. The white-clad woman's shoulders were exposed, and her snow-white, crystalline jade feet trod on the ground, her shoes and socks having been shredded by his Heavenly Light Energy.

"Here!" With what felt like suppressed anger in her heart, she tossed over a five-colored bottle. For a moment, Qin Ming doubted: was she truly the Temple Lord? He always felt her mentality wasn't old, there was a peculiar sensation about her. He quickly caught it, shaking it gently. The Heavenly Light Liquid inside the bottle should be enough for his eighth rebirth. He nearly broke into a smile. But he restrained himself, fearing he might provoke her.

The white-clad woman lightly waved her hand, and the clouds shrouding the walls instantly dispersed. Immediately, the area was bathed in brilliant light. All the characters on the wall, flying like dragons and dancing like phoenixes, flowed with Heavenly Light, manifesting themselves and illuminating the place. Qin Ming was so suppressed he nearly stumbled to the ground. He staggered, resisting the immense pressure, his eyes blazing as he stared at the scriptures, his heart filled with excitement and immense joy.

***

In the peculiar small town, many people watched on.

"Can that brother still walk out of the divine temple? I think it's doubtful."

"That's a desolate temple, Xiao Wu. Your friend won't be coming out. My condolences."

***

Back in the divine temple, the white-clad woman paced barefoot within the hall, her dark hair swaying. She was very displeased. How could she have been offended in such a way? How could she have lost?

The scriptures on the wall glowed brilliantly. Qin Ming, enduring the pressure, diligently studied them, gaining immense insights and feeling a profound sense of accomplishment in his heart. Suddenly, he felt his view obstructed. At this moment, the white-clad woman had come to stand before the wall. The night wind blew into the divine temple. Her figure was tall and slender, her robes fluttering, and the silk ribbon tied around her delicate waist danced in the wind.

"Senior, you're blocking the characters," Qin Ming whispered.

"Can you cultivate this scripture?" the white-clad woman asked.

"Yes!" Qin Ming replied with great confidence.
