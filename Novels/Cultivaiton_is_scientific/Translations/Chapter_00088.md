# Chapter 88: Spirit Spring

Li Shiming arrived beside the pool and finally understood the source of the spiritual energy. Bubbles were rising from the water's surface, carrying with them pure spiritual energy. It seemed there was a spiritual vein beneath the pool.

Since this spiritual vein hadn't been discovered by the Tianhai Sect, he couldn't determine its origin. However, judging by the distance from the sect's main island, it was likely a newly branched vein from the main spiritual vein. Perhaps there were two branch veins leading to Eagle Beak Island—one being the inferior-grade vein that had been discovered, while the other remained hidden underground, connected to this sealed space.

Normally, even if a cultivator were to dig a cave dwelling, they wouldn't excavate too deeply on an island. It was only because Li Shiming had an unusual purpose and needed more space that he accidentally uncovered the passage leading to this underground chamber.

Perhaps, many years later, an earthquake, a battle between powerful cultivators, or some other terrain-altering event would expose this new branch vein to the surface, allowing the Tianhai Sect to discover it.

His first thought was to seal the entrance above. He wasn't noble enough to report this spiritual vein to the sect. Given his current status, unless he was in one of the Nine Peaks, he would only be allotted an inferior-grade spiritual vein as a Qi Refining cultivator. Even in the Nine Peaks, the spiritual energy wasn't as freely available as it had been in the Autumn Clear Pavilion.

In the cave dwellings of the Nine Peaks, spiritual energy was distributed through formations, with the amount allocated depending on a cultivator's cultivation level and status. The main spiritual vein of the Nine Peaks was powerful, but with so many cultivators sharing it, consumption had to be carefully managed.

The concentration of spiritual energy in this underground space, combined with his Spirit Gathering Plate, might actually rival the cultivation environment of the Nine Peaks. More importantly, Qi Refining cultivators in the Nine Peaks had daily tasks and very little free time. Enjoying resources came with obligations.

Surveying the vast space, Li Shiming began formulating his plans. For construction, the 100-square-meter underground chamber above would need to be built like a typical cultivator's secret room—to conceal the existence of this place. Even if someone discovered the underground chamber, they would never suspect another hidden passage leading deeper below.

For this underground space, he planned to employ technological methods—building a generator powered by his spare shadow servant. After all, even after construction was complete, electricity usage would be minimal for the time being. One generator and some batteries would suffice for short-term needs.

But construction was only part of it. His cultivation plans were even more intensive.

The 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' would remain his primary cultivation technique, supplemented by the 'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art' for body refinement, and the yet-to-be-practiced 'Sword Control Art'—all crucial for his combat strength. Particularly for the 'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art,' he needed to decide whether to purchase spiritual herbs or their seeds to grow himself. Otherwise, his progress would remain painfully slow.

As for the copper corpse, he had no plans to further strengthen it at the moment. Although he had ready-made materials for refinement, he was still too weak to control a more powerful corpse. However, he needed to practice coordination with it. During today's excavation, he couldn't multitask while controlling the corpse—a serious disadvantage in combat. He considered finding a technique for divided attention, but all such techniques required sect contribution points, which he currently lacked. For now, he would have to rely on repeated practice to develop combat synergy.

Though currently weak, he would grow stronger, and he couldn't afford to delay training until then. His skills as a spiritual farmer also needed improvement. Advancement required mastering the basic techniques before purchasing higher-level spells—a common restriction for many auxiliary professions. Again, the problem was contribution points.

Li Shiming, barely past his novice period, was already worrying about contribution points.

His thoughts were interrupted by movement in the water. A small white fish swam near the surface, its body saturated with spiritual energy from living in the pool. Soon, more fish emerged from the depths—likely startled earlier by the lighting he had installed, only now daring to return.

Seeing them, Li Shiming's appetite stirred. Since becoming a cultivator, he had abandoned mortal food, subsisting only on spiritual rice. Later, he was fortunate to add bamboo shoots from the spirit bamboo as an occasional side dish, but their limited yield prevented indulgence. Upon joining the sect, the novice benefits only provided unlimited spiritual rice. During his 'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art' training, he often had to supplement his meals with extra rice cooked in his machine room space.

The sight of these fish made him crave fresh ingredients. After so long without meat—and with body refinement requiring more than just vegetarian fare—his impulse was understandable. Spiritual meat was currently beyond his reach, making these spiritual fish irresistible.

Acting on impulse, he activated his Object Manipulation technique. An invisible spiritual hand dipped into the water, deftly grabbing three fish from the densest school. The rest scattered, but it didn't matter—Li Shiming was already examining his catch with delight.

He discovered the pool wasn't saltwater as he'd assumed, but freshwater—a spirit spring. His spiritual senses through the technique revealed the water's rich spiritual energy. He could even drink it to replenish his own energy, though the effect would be mild, its advantage being long-term availability.

Had he more experience, he would have recognized the bubbling spring as a spirit spring the moment he saw it. Spirit springs were rare, requiring water channels to overlap extensively with spiritual veins and undergo centuries of tempering by spiritual energy.

Though unfamiliar with the fish species, he knew any ordinary fish living in a spirit spring would transform into spiritual fish. Already, he could imagine their aroma—a simple soup made with spirit spring water and fish, needing no seasoning, would be the most delicious spiritual cuisine he'd ever tasted.

Using a diesel stove, he boiled a pot of spirit fish soup. The moment the fragrance wafted up, he knew—this was the most exquisite meal he'd had in a long time.
