## Chapter 148: Entering

Whether the people of Jiuzhou were caught trying to ambush, or the Holy Spirits of those deities harbored ill intentions and were blocked, there seemed to be a sealing force present here. Both sides were simply in a standoff, with no major battle occurring.

Zhou Tian's arrival caught the attention of both parties. The Daobing of the Dao Alliance were present, and they hadn't witnessed Zhou Tian's display of power on the arena. Their gazes weren't overly concerned; seeing him arrive, they merely motioned for him to join their ranks.

"Roar!"

The Stone Giant among the Holy Spirits of the Divine Kingdom let out an inexplicable roar, and other Holy Spirits also roared, but that was the extent of it; there were no further actions.

Zhou Tian glanced at the group of Holy Spirits, not knowing what they were howling about, and ignored the Daobing of the Dao Alliance. With a flicker of his figure, he appeared before the gate of the ancient bronze palace.

Observing the grand gate from such a close distance, a primal, weighty aura assailed him. Enormous patterns and several statues were carved upon it. Zhou Tian saw a statue encircled by numerous winged creatures, likely the Holy Lord of Gods, and another deity standing on a pegasus chariot, wielding a great sword, with many corpses of various creatures strewn beneath the chariot.

There were many statues in total, seemingly depicting all the deities, but many had blurred faces and gave off a sense of lost divine essence, for reasons unknown.

A captain-level figure among the Daobing saw Zhou Tian disregard his gesture. His brows furrowed; insubordination on the battlefield was a grave taboo, leading to many unpredictable consequences. He immediately shouted, "Come here quickly! We've already investigated; there's a restriction, and we can't get in at all!"

Zhou Tian turned his head at the sound, not getting angry. He knew the man had no ill intentions and smiled, "Let me try."

The captain's brows furrowed even tighter. Just as he was about to speak again, his pupils suddenly contracted because, before the ancient bronze palace gate, Zhou Tian's figure abruptly vanished. This left him utterly shocked, and many thoughts flashed through his mind.

"Bang! Bang!"

The Stone Giant's basin-sized fists slammed against the bronze bricks. Fists capable of shaking small mountains left not even a scratch. Possessing considerable intelligence, they naturally understood what Zhou Tian's disappearance signified.

The captain looked displeased as he gazed at the group of Holy Spirits. Regardless, Zhou Tian was a person of Jiuzhou and had entered the Hall of Gods ahead of time. Although it was unknown if there were dangers inside the hall, it wasn't a bad thing for now.

If not for the area being covered by restrictions, making all energy difficult to use, he would have charged forward long ago.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian had directly entered the Hall of Gods. As he expected, those ancient deities weren't bored enough to make the gate over 3100 meters thick.

Initially, he arrived in a place of complete darkness, where he couldn't see his hand in front of his face. But before he could make any move, a light illuminated before his eyes, shining upon the area.

"Oh!"

Glancing around, Zhou Tian was startled, for a deity was seated on the nearest ancient bronze throne. He instinctively used teleportation to move away from the spot.

However, after a moment, no movement occurred. Zhou Tian felt something was amiss; if a deity were truly seated there, they should have discovered him long ago and reacted.

Returning to the seat, Zhou Tian finally noticed something peculiar. The figure appeared substantial but was actually an illusory projection, and its face was incredibly blurry, revealing nothing at all. It also felt very different from the Holy Lord of Gods.

"It can't be that it's just placed here to scare people, can it?" Zhou Tian stroked his chin, feeling that those deities shouldn't be so bored.

He carefully observed the scene. This was an enormous hall, much larger than it appeared from the outside, likely due to spatial expansion. He was at the very end, with the ancient bronze palace gate behind him.

Two rows of massive ancient bronze thrones extended into the distance. A single chair leg alone was dozens of zhang (tens of meters) high, covered in intricate patterns, and it seemed that the patterns on each seat were unique.

Looking ahead, at the very front was an even larger seat, far grander than the other ancient thrones. An illusory figure was also seated upon it, which appeared to be the position of the King of Gods.

Moreover, many seats had illusory figures seated upon them, especially the ancient bronze thrones near the end, where not a single one was empty; all had mysterious illusory figures on them.

"According to this arrangement, the ones at the very end should be the weakest deities." Zhou Tian pushed up his non-existent glasses, speculating inwardly. This didn't require much thought; in a world where strength was paramount, there couldn't possibly be a "rankings not in any particular order" system. Besides, the temples beneath Mount Myriad Gods were arranged in a similar fashion.

"Are these illusory figures on the seats because these deities still exist?"

"No, that's not right. It's impossible for so many deities to still exist. Only the powerful ones could barely escape; it's impossible for this many deities to still be present." Zhou Tian overturned his own speculation. A war capable of shattering a Great World wasn't something to be taken lightly. If every little cat and dog could escape, how would the other Great Worlds manage?

"What's that?" Zhou Tian let out a soft "咦," and upon closer inspection, he discovered something emitting a peculiar light at the very center of the illusory figure, right on the seat of the ancient bronze throne.

Since there was a question, it had to be answered. At the leg of the ancient bronze throne, Zhou Tian attempted to touch the illusory figure. His palm extended into it without any danger occurring. He walked entirely into it, as if passing through a layer of water film, and even directly touching the ancient bronze throne caused no reaction.

Zhou Tian pondered for a moment, sensing no apparent danger. He looked up, and without further hesitation, teleported directly onto the seat. The substance emitting that mysterious radiance lay there.

However, the instant Zhou Tian's foot landed on the seat, something abnormal occurred. Zhou Tian felt a dizzying sensation, as if the world was spinning, and before he could react, he lost consciousness.

Upon regaining consciousness, Zhou Tian found himself in a strange space. There was a sun in the sky, grass on the ground, and a river in the distance, but the overall feeling was incredibly bizarre, much like the scenery textures in some particularly low-quality games Zhou Tian played in his previous life, giving a very awkward sensation.

Without much thought, Zhou Tian directly attempted to use his teleportation ability. The scene instantly shifted, and his consciousness returned to his body.

He found himself mid-air, away from the ancient throne. Returning to the ground, he looked up at the radiant substance on the throne. Zhou Tian's eyes glinted; since that place couldn't restrict him, he didn't mind investigating what was going on.
