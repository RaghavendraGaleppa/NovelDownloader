# Chapter 107: The Six Emperors

Cui Chongxuan's face was calm, but his heart was churning with great waves. The other party was actually reciting the Six Emperors Heart Sutra. Who exactly was this person?

This scripture had an extraordinary origin; ordinary people couldn't even come into contact with it!

Back then, even when Cui's father exhausted all his connections and the Cui family paid countless rare treasures, they only managed to acquire the first volume for him. The other party told him to try it, and only if he had an affinity could he learn the subsequent parts.

"What's the problem?" Cui Chongxuan asked indifferently. Although he was young, he was not lacking in composure, his face showing no ripple.

Qin Ming's expression was calm as he said, "Your Six Emperors Force can only be considered a 'Lesser Six Emperors.' Its grandeur is somewhat lacking."

In truth, he only knew this small section, which wasn't of much use to him.

In those days, Cui Chongxuan dedicated himself daily to studying the Six Emperors Heart Sutra, and he had once recited it inadvertently.

In the past, Qin Ming wanted to borrow the scripture to observe it and verify his own newly developed techniques.

That day, Cui's father watched calmly and asked him if he lacked confidence in cultivating the methods on the silk scroll. The matter of borrowing the scripture then came to nothing.

"The Six Emperors also have 'greater' and 'lesser' forms?" Cui Chongxuan asked, yet still maintained his composure.

"Heaven has six energies: Yin, Yang, Wind, Rain, Gloom, and Radiance. With these six energies, myriad phenomena can be created. The Six Emperors Force you cultivate is rooted in this," Qin Ming said.

He wasn't speaking idly; these six energies could also be seen in other books. Through their exchange, he had already determined that Cui Chongxuan clearly used this as his foundation.

"What's wrong with that?" Cui Chongxuan asked.

"The foundation is a bit shallow; it doesn't match the true meaning of the Six Emperors," Qin Ming commented unreservedly.

This time, a faint divine light of the Six Emperors flashed in Cui Chongxuan's eyes. He had diligently studied and arduously cultivated for so long, only to be looked down upon.

"How does one achieve a Six Emperors with true grandeur? Please elaborate!" He genuinely wanted to hear the other party's profound insights and see if they truly had substance.

Qin Ming began, "Yin and Yang can remain, but Wind and Rain are insufficient to command all things. Gloom and Radiance are already contained within the Yin and Yang categories. You should seek four more foundations that encompass the essence of all things. This is the 'Greater Six Emperors.'"

Cui Chongxuan's expression subtly changed, and he could no longer maintain his composure. Indeed, a great storm raged in his heart, and for a moment, he felt a slight tremor of doubt.

Qin Ming was waiting for this exact moment. He wanted to verify something: whether he could resonate with the scripture when he provoked strong emotional fluctuations in those around him.

His mind was highly focused as he watched Cui Chongxuan. It was indeed effective; he saw fragmented portions of the Six Emperors Heart Sutra, not many, and they were related to the Lesser Six Emperors and Greater Six Emperors he had mentioned.

Unfortunately, this emotional resonance was highly unstable, and in an instant, he was forced to withdraw.

Qin Ming's face was calm as he said, "I have only read one volume of the Six Emperors Heart Sutra. This is merely my humble opinion; you don't have to take it seriously."

"Perhaps, you are a senior disciple of my sect?" Cui Chongxuan suspected.

Otherwise, how could this person before him have seen such a legendary secret text? The Cui family had paid such a huge price just to secure an opportunity for him to begin learning it.

Qin Ming smiled faintly and said, "The so-called Six Emperors Heart Sutra—don't just look at the literal meaning. The two words 'Heart Sutra' grant the Six Emperors infinite possibilities; one must not be confined by form."

He wasn't misleading; this was how he had understood it after catching fragments of the Six Emperors scripture.

Back then, he and Cui Chongxuan were like brothers, so how could there have been no feelings between them? It was only on the night of their final parting, when he had to take another path to his death, that he looked back to see Cui's father, Cui's mother, and Cui Chongxuan quickly disappearing into the distance without a single glance back, chilling his heart.

The young Cui Chongxuan hadn't known the truth and indeed considered Qin Ming his elder brother. But by the time of their impending separation, he should have already understood everything.

Qin Ming had long since come to terms with many things. Now, he was unreservedly coveting the Six Emperors Heart Sutra. After all, his own silk scroll had also been studied by the Cui family, but no one had managed to cultivate it.

He spoke again, "Actually, if we don't talk about the 'Heart Sutra' aspect of this Six Emperors Heart Sutra, and only discuss the Six Emperors Force, there's also a most fundamental true meaning."

"Oh?!" Cui Chongxuan's emotions fluctuated.

Qin Ming's eyes were deep, his spirit resonating as he stared at Cui Chongxuan for a moment before saying, "In the ancient books of those beyond the mundane world, and within the scriptures of esoteric sects, there have been vague mentions of six legendary quasi-immortal beings, god-like entities, known as the Six Emperors."

Cui Chongxuan naturally knew this, and his mind was instantly shaken. If the Six Emperors Force developed in this direction, it would indeed be quite terrifying.

Qin Ming didn't miss the opportunity. His spirit was highly concentrated as he watched the young man whose expression had changed before him.

Unfortunately, he couldn't touch Cui Chongxuan at close range, and the emotions of a living person like this were exceptionally complex, not like the pure crystallization of past masters' efforts found in secret texts.

The fragments of the Six Emperors Heart Sutra he obtained were disorganized and didn't form a complete system, but they could serve as a reference, mainly lacking some finer details.

Qin Ming spoke again, "'御 (Yù)' inherently means to rule or command. Such Six Emperors would require immense grandeur to control."

Cui Chongxuan murmured to himself, "The six quasi-immortal beings, god-like entities, are said to have all perished deep within the Night Fog World. This direction indeed sparks profound contemplation."

Qin Ming nodded and said, "Indeed, the Six Emperors Force can also transform into the Six Emperors' Might."

Cui Chongxuan's thoughts churned. He had been obsessively studying the Six Emperors Heart Sutra for the past two years, and with this new perspective, his mind was naturally greatly stirred.

Qin Ming rapidly "absorbed" the scripture. He placed great importance on the Six Emperors Force.

In the past, when Cui Chongxuan wanted to cultivate the silk scroll, his father had said that he would find him the Six Emperors Heart Sutra, which could rival the Tathagata's methods and would be no worse than the silk scroll.

Qin Ming was present at that time and had felt a strong desire.

Suddenly, a voice echoed within Cui Chongxuan's head: "Chongxuan, wake up quickly! You're almost being conned blind by him!"

"What's going on?" Qin Ming's mind was highly focused, capturing fragmented Six Emperors Heart Sutra, when he actually heard such a voice.

"Brother, why did you wake up early?" Cui Chongxuan asked in his mind.

"Your thoughts fluctuated too intensely, affecting me." A voice sounded in Cui Chongxuan's mind.

Qin Ming's expression instantly changed. He could resonate with strong emotions, and he had actually caught this kind of fluctuation. Someone had cheated their way in.

This was a considerably dangerous individual. This time, various factions had restricted "old disciples" from entering, which implicitly targeted Cui Chonghe, yet he had still managed to slip in.

His greatest trump card was not Zhou Chengru, nor the several young powerhouses he had invited, but rather the partial attachment of his consciousness to his younger brother's body, personally being present here.

Cui Chongxuan's gaze sharpened. After his elder brother's reminder, his eyes regained their clarity. Regardless of whether he agreed with what the other party said about the Six Emperors, now was not the time for contemplation.

"Hm?" He was startled to find that the core disciples' battle had already concluded. Had he committed a serious error?

"Even if you went, it would be useless. You're nowhere near her opponent," Cui Chonghe's voice echoed in his mind.

At this moment, Li Qingyue, in her shimmering silver armor, walked from the fiery red lake. Her dark hair floated, and for the first time, such a solemn expression appeared on her beautiful, flawless face.

She had cultivated a special Spirit Eye, which allowed her to see an abnormality within Cui Chongxuan's body: a powerful cluster of consciousness light was reviving, giving off a sense of danger.

By the lake, Zhou Chengru knelt on one knee, continuously coughing blood. Even his protective golden robes could not ensure his complete safety; he had suffered severe injuries.

He struggled to lift his head, looking at the armored woman, and let out a helpless sigh. He had given his all, but truly, he was no match.

He even understood why Li Qingyue hadn't invited young powerhouses who cultivated special Heavenly Radiance Force to serve as her golden armored guards—because there was simply no need.

Zhou Chengru was certain that even if Cui Chongxuan and a few others joined him in besieging Li Qingyue, they still wouldn't be able to defeat her.

"Cui Chonghe, you've violated the rules!" Li Qingyue said, having already signaled Qin Ming to retreat.

In fact, Qin Ming had already noticed Cui Chonghe's possession and was about to warn her, but he hadn't expected her dual pupils to be so powerful that she had already detected it.

"What?" Zhou Chengru abruptly looked up, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and stood up, swaying slightly.

Cui Chongxuan stood still, unmoving.

Cui Chonghe remained silent for a moment before saying, "Junior Sister Li, your perception is truly sharp; to think you could discover me even like this."

He sighed. If he hadn't recovered early, he wouldn't have alarmed Li Qingyue at all. Such an unexpected turn of events put him in a very passive position.

"Brother, this is my mistake!" Cui Chongxuan felt ashamed and apologized to his elder brother in his mind.

In the distance, Zhou Chengru's expression was uncertain. He had become highly vigilant, knowing that this was an extremely dangerous phase.

Even though that person was Cui Chonghe, his senior uncle's favorite closed-door disciple, he might now be dealt with along with him.

To avoid being silenced, Zhou Chengru was prepared to ally with Li Qingyue.

At this moment, Cui Chongxuan's physical body emitted dazzling light, as if a terrifying monster was reviving within him. The circulating light of consciousness tore through the surrounding boulders and vegetation, turning the ancient medicinal field back into scorched earth, a truly terrifying sight.

Core disciple Zhou Chengru's expression suddenly changed, bracing himself for a life-and-death battle.

"Cui Chonghe, I heard that your master, that senior renowned throughout the Night Fog World, recently refined a furnace of Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir," Li Qingyue said, her expression calm, showing no signs of an impending battle.

"So what if he did?" Cui Chonghe's voice responded.

Reflected in the fiery spring, Li Qingyue's armor glowed, her hair gently lifted by the breeze. She spoke with great composure, "I am not an unyielding person. I want three Dragon-Tiger Pills, and today we can pretend nothing happened, but you must leave immediately."

Zhou Chengru was dumbfounded. Li Qingyue was actually threatening his senior brother Cui Chonghe. How could this be? Wasn't she worried about instantly triggering a massive and terrifying storm?

"You are very confident!" Cui Chonghe said coldly.

Li Qingyue said, "In your current state, you cannot kill me. Moreover, since you possessed Cui Chongxuan, you cannot completely erase the traces in his flesh and blood in a short time. If an elder personally investigates, it certainly won't remain hidden."

After a brief silence, Cui Chonghe said, "I'll yield that legendary item to you. I'll withdraw now."

Li Qingyue's tone was firm. "It's not you yielding it. I strive and struggle, and if I can get my hands on it, it is what I deserve."

"One Dragon-Tiger Pill," Cui Chonghe said decisively.

"Three!"

...

Following that, they began to transmit their voices secretly.

"Junior brother, I will compensate you when we return." Cui Chonghe looked at Zhou Chengru, then his light of consciousness completely receded deep into his younger brother's body.

Qin Ming really wanted to ask: Everyone else got something, what about me?

He thought for a moment, then decided against it. Best not to provoke the other party and avoid any unforeseen incidents.

Cui Chongxuan regained control of his body, his eyes flowing with the divine light of the Six Emperors. He looked at Li Qingyue and said, "Sister Qingyue, we must admit that we were thoroughly defeated. Even if Senior Brother Zhou Chengru and I had teamed up, we still couldn't have stopped you."

Zhou Chengru's handsome face was filled with helplessness; he really didn't want to stay here any longer!

Cui Chongxuan turned to Qin Ming and asked, "Who exactly are you?"

Qin Ming said, "You wouldn't believe it if I said I was a disciple abandoned by the Tathagata. You'd also be suspicious if I mentioned being a disciple of the Jade Purity Sect. Just consider me a successor of the Six Emperors Force."

"Before leaving, I want to fight you!" Cui Chongxuan's eyes blazed with fiery light, eager to fully gauge the true strength of this opponent.

In truth, the "Greater Six Emperors" and "Six Emperors' Might" that the other party mentioned had indeed stirred him, making it feel as if voices continuously echoed in his heart, leaving him restless for a long time.

Qin Ming said, "Setting aside the Greater Six Emperors Force and Lesser Six Emperors Force, your own Heavenly Radiance Force doesn't seem solid enough. You've undergone more rebirths than I have, yet you can't suppress me."

"I've only cultivated one Emperor Force so far; I'm still building momentum," Cui Chongxuan stated.

He was using the Six Emperors Heart Sutra to nourish his physical body and continuously accumulate foundation, as he wanted to become an "Extraordinary," and thus wasn't rushing to exhaust his nine rebirth opportunities.

According to the Six Emperors Heart Sutra, cultivating two Emperor Forces during the rebirth stage was considered a success.

Each Emperor Force was essentially a single sheet of true transmission, densely covered with intricate Heavenly Radiance Force circulation diagrams, making them extremely difficult to cultivate.

Most importantly, each Emperor Force required personal insight and comprehension, as well as finding a "domain" that aligned with oneself, laying the groundwork for the future.

Because the Six Emperors Force held infinite possibilities.

Cui Chongxuan erupted, his entire body glowing as if bathed in divine radiance, extraordinarily dazzling.

This was the Bright Emperor Force he had cultivated, which integrated techniques related to light, fire, and the sun.

Therefore, when he struck, his fist resembled a great sun streaking across the sky, incredibly dazzling, completely illuminating the area.

Qin Ming was fearless, directly meeting it with his Yellow Earth Palm. With a bang, fist and palm collided, and the golden sun dimmed.

Cui Chongxuan's entire armor roared, like dragon scales unfurling. His pores seemed to erupt with dazzling divine flames. He attacked his opponent with a left fist and a right palm.

His speed was also raised to its limit, leaving a hazy afterimage in his wake.

Before the fiery red lake, two figures moved like lightning, their Heavenly Radiance Forces clashing fiercely.

Qin Ming's Golden Silkworm Force slightly permeated his skin, causing Cui Chongxuan's palm to turn crimson and seep a little blood.

With a boom, Qin Ming's Departing Fire Force erupted. His palm collided with the opponent's divine flame fist, as if large swathes of firelight were scattering everywhere.

Qin Ming's right palm stuck to Cui Chongxuan's arm, causing him to stumble and nearly fall to the ground. Their elbows collided, instantly producing explosive sounds like wind and thunder.

In a brief moment, Qin Ming used his integrated and unified Heavenly Radiance Force to activate the hard and unique martial arts he had cultivated, shaking Cui Chongxuan so much that his vital energy and blood churned.

Cui Chongxuan was certain that the other party had undergone fewer rebirths than him, so why could he wield so many force techniques?

He himself possessed the Six Emperors Heart Sutra, so which supreme Daoist lineage's successor was the other party?

*Pfft!*

Cui Chongxuan coughed up a mouthful of blood, sent flying by Qin Ming. He was already injured, his sun-like fist was a bloody mess, and four of his finger bones showed cracks.

He was somewhat dazed, and ultimately left the place with Zhou Chengru.

Outside the Mount Luofu Immortal Ruins, many people were closely watching the battle.

People wanted to know how long Zhou Chengru could withstand Li Qingyue.

Furthermore, as Cui Chongxuan confronted that mysterious youth with his Six Emperors Force, who was stronger and who was weaker?

Not only were the related Daoist lineages beyond the mundane world and ancient aristocratic families somewhat nervous, but many outsiders also found it difficult to remain calm, as the betting markets across various regions had gone wild with wagers.
