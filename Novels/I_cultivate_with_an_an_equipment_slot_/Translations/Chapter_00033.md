# Chapter 33: Spirit-Nurturing Root

**[Equipment Name]**: Spirit-Nurturing Root  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Gold  
**[Equipment Effect]**: Spirit-Nurturing Technique (Intermediate) (Secret Art: Can extract spiritual energy from treasures to enhance one's spiritual root quality.)  

Upon seeing this emerald-green bamboo, Zhang Yan was instantly overwhelmed with desire.  

The true form of this Spirit-Nurturing Root was unknown—perhaps some kind of spiritual bamboo—but its spiritual aura appeared dim, suggesting it wasn't particularly valuable.  

For Zhang Yan, the real treasure was the Spirit-Nurturing Technique inscribed upon it.  

Without hesitation, he picked up the Spirit-Nurturing Root.  

"Elder Liu, I would like this bamboo," Zhang Yan said, holding the green bamboo out to Liu Changfeng.  

"Hmm?"  

Liu Changfeng was taken aback by Zhang Yan's choice. He had a clear understanding of every treasure in this vault.  

The most valuable item here was a refined high-grade spiritual herb.  

He had expected Zhang Yan to choose that.  

Yet, instead, the young man had picked a bamboo stalk.  

"I didn't expect you to choose this bamboo," Liu Changfeng mused, his eyes flickering with nostalgia as he glanced at the green stalk. "To be honest, this bamboo was left behind by our ancestor. At first, we thought it might be something extraordinary, but later, we realized it was just an ordinary spiritual bamboo. So, it ended up stored here."  

"I see. No wonder I felt an unusual aura from it," Zhang Yan said politely.  

"If you want this bamboo, then it's yours."  

Liu Changfeng and others had already examined it thoroughly. There was truly nothing special about it.  

In reality…  

It was indeed just an ordinary spiritual bamboo.  

Useless to anyone else.  

After all, in this world, only Zhang Yan could see the inscription on it.  

After thanking the Liu family patriarch, Zhang Yan returned to his courtyard.  

The moment he stepped inside, the silly bird flapped over excitedly.  

Zhang Yan caught it, tossed it some spirit rice, and then set it aside.  

Eagerly, he equipped the Spirit-Nurturing Root into his inventory slot.  

The moment it was equipped, a surge of information flooded his mind.  

He had acquired a secret art:  

**Spirit-Nurturing Technique!**  

This was not a spell but a secret technique—fundamentally different from ordinary magic.  

Secret arts often possessed unique abilities.  

Notorious examples included the *Heavenly Demon Dissolution Technique* and the *Blood-Burning Secret Art*.  

The Spirit-Nurturing Technique was similar.  

Once activated, it could extract spiritual energy from treasures to enhance one's spiritual root quality.  

However, the technique had its limitations.  

The improvement it offered was minor, and the required spiritual materials were exceedingly rare.  

*"Is this the reason the Liu family has so many spiritual roots?"*  

*"No… probably not."*  

At first, Zhang Yan wondered if this technique was the secret behind the Liu family's unusually high number of cultivators.  

But he quickly dismissed the idea.  

The reason was simple.  

The materials needed to enhance spiritual roots were far too expensive—each costing several thousand spirit stones.  

Some were so rare he hadn’t even heard of them, suggesting even higher prices.  

Yet, the improvement in aptitude was minimal.  

The cost far outweighed the benefits.  

Perhaps the Liu family might use this method to enhance the talent of a chosen heir, but they certainly wouldn’t waste resources on every member.  

*"Maybe… the Liu family has another secret."*  

*"Perhaps their ancestor discovered something extraordinary in that ancient cave."*  

But that was none of Zhang Yan’s concern.  

He had no intention of meddling in others' affairs.  

Their fortunes were theirs alone.  

He only wanted to farm peacefully, cultivate steadily—nothing more.  

*"Still, I should keep an eye out for those spiritual materials from now on."*  

Spiritual roots were crucial for cultivators.  

They determined not only cultivation speed but also one’s ultimate potential.  

Zhang Yan’s triple spiritual roots were all low-grade.  

His wood affinity was close to mid-grade, but it still fell short of the real thing.  

Since the Spirit-Nurturing Technique could enhance his aptitude, he would naturally seize the opportunity.  

Low-grade spiritual roots…  

Were simply too weak.  

*"Moreover, the efficiency of the Spirit-Nurturing Technique varies depending on mastery—beginner, intermediate, or advanced."*  

*"So, I should first master it to perfection before absorbing spiritual materials. That way, I’ll get the best results."*  

For others, mastering the technique would be the hardest part.  

But for Zhang Yan, learning spells was the easiest thing in the world.  

*"Still, it’s a shame it only came with intermediate mastery. If it were perfect, I wouldn’t have to work so hard!"*  

He sighed.  

*"As expected, relying solely on the equipment panel isn’t enough. I’ll have to put in the effort myself!"*  

---  

Time passed swiftly.  

Three months went by in the blink of an eye.  

Zhang Yan now had only one month left before his sect mission concluded, after which he would leave the Liu family and return to his sect.  

During this time, he continued his diligent cultivation.  

In his spare moments, he studied spells and alchemy, living a comfortable life.  

He had also taken it upon himself to teach the Liu siblings about spiritual plant cultivation.  

Normally, he wouldn’t have gone out of his way to do so.  

But since he had obtained the Spirit-Nurturing Root from their family vault—though they didn’t realize its significance—he felt obliged to repay them.  

This wasn’t about profit.  

It was simply the right thing to do, aligning with his conscience.  

The Liu family was overjoyed by his teachings and treated him with even greater respect.  

His daily meals were upgraded to the highest-grade spirit rice and delicacies, occasionally accompanied by fine spirit wine.  

"Master! Master!"  

One day, as Zhang Yan finished tending to the spiritual herbs in the garden, a clear voice called out to him.  

He turned to see Liu Yiting rushing toward him.  

"What’s wrong?" Zhang Yan asked, surprised. He had known Liu Yiting for some time now but had never seen her so flustered.  

"We found a second-grade spiritual herb outside! The family head was worried we might damage it, so he sent me to ask for your help!"  

Her voice was urgent.  

"A second-grade spiritual herb?!"  

Zhang Yan’s calm demeanor shattered.  

He had never even seen a second-grade herb before!  

"Where is it? Is it dangerous?"  

As soon as they stepped outside, Zhang Yan suddenly remembered something and turned to Liu Yiting.  

After all, the herb wasn’t his—he needed to ensure his own safety first!
