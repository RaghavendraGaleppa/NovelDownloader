# Chapter 69: Facing the Heavenly Thunder

The news of the northern war couldn't be kept secret, and with Zhou Qing's encouragement, it spread with increasingly exaggerated rumors. 

Zhou Qing hadn't killed Prefect Ling. Instead, he used him to eliminate the powerful families who openly opposed him. In reality, Jiangzhou City had already been covertly divided among the local gentry and powerful families led by Zhou Qing.

This year's spring was unusually cold. Even by late February, snow still occasionally fell, and spring thunder was long overdue.

The disappearance of Gu Fan, the Southern Commander of the Wude Division, should have been a major incident. Only a few in Jiangzhou knew Gu Fan had died in Zhou Qing's courtyard. Normally, this would have drawn inquiries from the Governor's Office and the Provincial Administration. But with two major events unfolding, no one could spare attention for Jiangzhou's affairs.

First, as the northern war intensified, rebels from the Anping Sect rose up, sweeping through several provinces in an instant with tremendous momentum.

Second, Yuan Hua of the Qinghe Prince's Mansion suddenly rebelled, carving out half of Xijiang Province.

Compared to these earth-shattering events, the disturbances in Jiangzhou were completely overshadowed and insignificant.

Even if someone reported Zhou Qing to the Governor's Office, they wouldn't have time to deal with minor Jiangzhou matters now. 

With the Great Zhou Dynasty potentially on the verge of collapse, local governors and powerful officials were too busy stabilizing their regions to stir up new troubles. Many were seizing the chaos to establish de facto control over their provinces.

Of course, some loyalists wanted to rally to save the dynasty, but in troubled times, it was the ambitious who thrived.

The martial monks of Golden Light Temple gradually moved to Changzhou to serve Governor Song He, who was pleased. He had long wanted to incorporate them into his forces and had kept Golden Light Temple's master martial monk, Yong Hu, by his side.

Amidst the chaos, Zhou Qing ascended the mountain leisurely through the spring snow.

For him, the convoluted affairs of Jiangzhou weren't worth unraveling. He had taken the most direct approach—cutting the Gordian knot. If any remaining powerful families or the Jiangzhou garrison made trouble, he wouldn't hesitate to conduct another decapitation strike.

Zhou Qing's greatest deterrent wasn't just his martial prowess, but also his youth—he wouldn't turn twenty until August. As long as he lived, he had endless chances to start over, while his opponents only needed to fail once to join their predecessors in ruin.

Moreover, Zhou Qing didn't value wealth and actively shared benefits. The deaths of some powerful families only meant feasts for the survivors. Assigning blame was easy—after all, no tyrant's hands were truly clean. Even if they restrained themselves, their subordinates wouldn't.

To outsiders, it seemed Prefect Ling was behind the purges, given his history of stirring trouble since taking office.

Zhou Qing also had an ally in Governor Feng of neighboring Hushan Prefecture, whose prestige had soared through bandit suppression campaigns, making him a genuine regional power. The Hushan naval forces were formidable, and since their commander had once served under the Qinghe Prince, Song He dared not remove him, instead relying on Governor Feng to maintain stability and tax revenues.

Thus, through tacit understanding between Zhou Qing and Governor Feng, the underworld and officialdom of Jiangzhou and Hushan were united.

Given these factors, Jiangzhou's stability exceeded expectations—exactly as Zhou Qing predicted. He understood that sharing benefits and creating shared interests naturally bred allies. The difference between Emperor Gaozu of Han and Xiang Yu lay in the latter's unwillingness to share spoils.

For Zhou Qing, leveraging resources to achieve goals and collect rare cultivation materials far outweighed amassing wealth. Secular power was merely a tool for cultivation, not his life's pursuit.

The steep, slippery mountain path posed no obstacle to Zhou Qing, who soon arrived at Qingfu Palace.

There, he found Zhang Jingxiu strolling leisurely across the training grounds, appearing utterly at ease.

"Such heavy killing intent," Zhang remarked with a smile.

"Your senses grow sharper, Elder Brother. Are you training or simply walking?"

Zhang smiled. "Adjusting my qi to harmonize with the mountain's. When heavenly thunder comes, I'll sense it immediately."

Snowflakes like willow catkins fell onto Zhou Qing's fire-resistant robe, only to be shaken off without a trace—a detail Zhang noticed. "Your bone and muscle development exceeds my expectations. Have you acquired new techniques?"

Zhang had sensed Zhou Qing's killing intent but wasn't surprised, having vaguely discerned Jiangzhou's events. His priority now was breaking through to the Innate Realm. Even news of the Qinghe Prince's rebellion from his sect couldn't distract him—he'd long anticipated this day. He only hoped his disciple Xiao Ruowang could lead the Taihe Sect through the crisis in his absence.

Many hidden dangers had already been cleared, after all.

Watching the madly cavorting Fushong on the training grounds, Zhou Qing massaged his temples in frustration. "When your master first awoke, was he like this?" he asked Zhishan.

"Respectfully, Elder Uncle, not just similar—exactly like this," came the honest reply.

Zhou Qing now suspected Qingfu Palace's cultivation manuals were flawed. Why was Zhang Jingxiu unaffected by heavenly thunder, while both Qingfu elders went mad? Now, before even treating Fushan, he had another lunatic to handle.

"I'll need to find a solution." Though Fushong had awakened as an Innate expert—his combat perception skyrocketing despite incomplete bone marrow cleansing—controlling him safely would require Zhang's help. First, clues were needed.

Zhou Qing wasn't joking—Qingfu Palace's manuals definitely had issues. Otherwise, both Fushan and Fushong wouldn't have gone mad after facing heavenly thunder. Since Zhou Qing also practiced the Rejuvenation Manual, he needed to prevent similar problems during his own Innate breakthrough.

"Though I practice the Rejuvenation Manual, Elder Brother's martial prowess is terrifying. Even with Elder Zhang's help, subduing him would be difficult. Fushong is more manageable, but I haven't deeply studied his Great Mountain Manifestation Manual. To cure his madness, I must examine that manual's hidden flaws."

All Qingfu Palace's manuals shared common origins—likely stemming from a lost foundational text Zhou Qing couldn't reference.

"Great Mountain Manifestation Manual, reveal your secrets to me!"

Soon, the characters of the Great Mountain Manifestation Manual surfaced in his Mind's Nurturing Master, merging symbols with the Rejuvenation Manual.

Fushong's spine undulated like a dragon, vitality surging as his blood flowed like rivers—cleansing his organs and renewing his blood. Gradually, thunderous sounds emerged from his body, resonating with Zhou Qing.

Resonance!

Zhou Qing perceived subtle changes within Fushong—a mysterious energy originating from his heart.

True Qi?

It felt both familiar and alien—similar to the heat generated by his Five Animals Exercises yet far more refined, pure, and mysteriously profound.

The synchronization ended abruptly as Fushong's tremors repelled Zhou Qing. Simultaneously, thunderous sounds emerged from Zhang Jingxiu—each distinct. Fushong's carried earthly solidity; Zhang's, fiery intensity.

Sunlight pierced through, coalescing like a diamond at Zhang's forehead before dissipating. When his eyes opened, sunlight shimmered in his pupils as if absorbing solar essence—the mark of Taihe Sect's Solar Qi Manual reaching Innate Realm, making Zhang the first since the founding ancestor to achieve this.

"So this is tempering the spirit with sun and moon," Zhang exhaled blood-tinged breath. His internal injuries were severe, but his spiritual transformation exceeded expectations—manifesting divine sense that could perceive internally and extend externally to absorb sunlight.

Zhou Qing tossed him a seventh-grade Blood Qi Pill—his last spare. Though Fushong had taken two before facing the thunder, Zhou Qing's Organ Thunder Resonance activated residual pill energy, aiding Fushong's recovery and True Qi cultivation.

"Thank you," Zhang said solemnly, marking the debt.

Zhou Qing smiled. "Remember, I've obtained millennium ganoderma. Refined into pills, they'll be inferior to seventh-grade pills but more abundant. Moreover, I'll surely reach Innate within years without peril—no need to feel indebted."

The red python's inner core surpassed seventh-grade ginseng, perhaps rivaling eighth-grade. Zhou Qing had gained immensely from that hunt. He hadn't expected Zhang to reserve his seventh-grade pill for Xiao Ruowang—a master-disciple bond Zhou Qing struggled to comprehend, let alone predict.

Fortunately, Zhang had successfully faced the heavenly thunder.

Over seven days, Zhou Qing tended to Fushong with Organ Thunder Resonance and acupuncture, but the elder remained unconscious while Zhang recovered, exchanging cultivation insights.

Whenever Zhou Qing questioned Zhang's advice, the reply—"You're not Innate, how would you understand?"—left him speechless yet enriched.

Noting Zhou Qing's rapid bone-muscle development and knowledge from Golden Light Temple, Zhang imparted Taihe Sect's body tempering secrets. With his mastery of Six-Word Nurturing Technique, Organ Thunder Resonance, and rudimentary Palm Thunder, Zhou Qing's path to Innate Realm was clear—once bone-muscle resonance and organ thunder united to cleanse marrow and renew bones, breakthrough would follow naturally.

This prospect filled the thunder-surviving Zhang with envy. Zhou Qing's Innate foundation would be incomparably solid, his future limitless.

Zhang realized even with ancestral techniques, entering Innate meant starting anew like an infant—requiring years to restore youth, provided he maintained childlike purity like the mad Daoist, whose cultivation would accelerate with elixirs.

During these exchanges, Zhou Qing gained not just Zhang's experience but centuries of Taihe Sect's heritage, deepening his martial comprehension until even his mid-stage Literary Core inscriptions grew fuller.

On the tenth day, Fushong "awoke."

Watching the elder frolic madly on the training grounds, Zhou Qing sighed. "Is your master's condition identical?" he asked Zhishan.

"Respectfully, Elder Uncle, not just identical—precisely the same."

Zhou Qing now suspected Qingfu Palace's manuals were flawed—why else would both elders go mad after heavenly thunder, while Zhang remained sane? Before even treating Fushan, he had another lunatic to handle.

"This requires careful consideration."
