**Chapter 126: Seeking Opportunity**

Above the vast plains, millions of qi-devouring worms surged forward in endless waves, their collective hissing like claps of thunder echoing across the heavens. More importantly, these qi-devouring worms exhibited a degree of suppression against the Myriad Spirit Banner. This was because the Myriad Spirit Banner could not transform them into Banner Spirits!

"No souls?"

High in the sky, Lu Yang, while recuperating, scanned the entire battlefield with his divine sense. "The true qi-devouring worms with souls, I'm afraid there's only one." A hint of regret flickered across Lu Yang's face. He had originally hoped to use these worms to replenish his Myriad Spirit Banner, gathering a few million of them as a useful tool for future battles. But now, it seemed unlikely, unless he could subdue the Insect King hidden in the shadows.

"Have you found its location?"

Before Lu Yang's words even faded, a helpless sigh reached his ears. "My apologies... these worms are simply cannon fodder; there's no way to trace their origin." It was Xu Xin who spoke. He had intended to use a qi-tracing technique to plant a trace of his qi inside a demon worm, hoping to follow it back to the Insect King when it returned to report. Alas, these worms were sent to die and never intended to return.

From another direction, Jiaolong Daoist's voice chimed in, "The scent of blood is too strong; it's interfering with my sense of smell. It will be very difficult to locate them."

A moment later, Bi Feiyuan's message arrived: "I do have some sense of it. It should be Dao Court cultivators observing me in secret, but the distance is too great. I can't pinpoint their exact location, only a general area..." Following her words, a wisp of spiritual sense drifted up.

Lu Yang swept his divine sense over it, comprehending the contents, and immediately locked onto an area spanning tens of thousands of li. However, this range was still too vast. He needed more precision.

*Fortunately, the search area has already shrunk considerably.*

Thinking this, Lu Yang immediately took out the Bagua Compass that Chongming had given him. He channeled his magic power and began to silently deduce the karmic connections within that region. Yet, the results were unsatisfactory. Even with Su Nü's full amplification using her Foundation Establishment realm authority, he could only barely narrow the original tens of thousands of li down to a radius of ten thousand li.

"...Should I try?"

Lu Yang glanced at the Blood Sun Sword Pellet in his hand. It contained a great divine ability of slaughter, accumulated over a long time—his trump card for ultimate victory. According to his estimations, if fully amplified by Su Nü's Foundation Establishment realm authority, this great divine ability could strike within a five-thousand-li radius. However, he only had one shot. If he unleashed it now, it would be a gamble of luck, and if he lost, many unforeseen variables would arise.

Just as Lu Yang hesitated, a voice suddenly rang out: "...I succeeded!"

It was Qin Tianhe.

The next second, a spiritual sense transmitted, and Lu Yang, high in the heavens, immediately followed the connection to locate his target within the previously designated ten-thousand-li range.

"Well done."

As his words fell, a crisp popping sound came from the Blood Sun Sword Pellet in Lu Yang's hand. It then cracked inch by inch, and corona-like brilliance seeped out from the fissures.

***

A short while ago, at the Dao Court's hiding place.

"Fellow Daoist Wang, I accepted the Dao Court's invitation to participate in this Battle for the Dao to clash with the Demonic Sect, not to cower here wasting time!"

"Calm yourself, Immortal Miaozhen."

Facing the angry, dissatisfied heroic woman before him, Wang Jinting could only offer a bitter smile. "The demonic cultivator is cunning. A Foundation Establishment True Lord has arrived..."

"Impossible!" Yun Miaozhen shook her head without hesitation. "Foundation Establishment True Lords cannot enter. Perhaps the opponent possesses a high status, but they are absolutely not a Foundation Establishment True Lord."

*These unyielding sword lunatics!*

Wang Jinting cursed inwardly. Although the Dao Court, strictly speaking, was ranked among the righteous sects just like the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion, they harbored apprehension towards the Sword Pavilion. Internally, the Dao Court even explicitly referred to the Sword Pavilion disciples as "sword lunatics." This wasn't because the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion disciples were all obsessed with the Way of the Sword and mad for swords; rather, the Dao Court considered them a group of sword-wielding madmen!

Even the demonic cultivators of the Initial Saint Sect, cunning as they were, could still be reasoned with if you spoke of interests. However, the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion was entirely different; they possessed their own unique logic. Whatever you said to them, you could only follow their logic. If you couldn't, then it was a direct confrontation with drawn swords.

Such was the case now. In Yun Miaozhen's view, a Foundation Establishment True Lord could not participate in a Qi Refining level Battle for the Dao, so no matter what, the opponent could not be one. But in Wang Jinting's eyes, facts spoke louder than words. Even if Lu Yang truly wasn't a Foundation Establishment True Lord, what difference did it make, given the combat power he displayed when annihilating the Pure Land Buddhist cultivators? He was irresistible!

However, Yun Miaozhen did not think so. She was the most outstanding true disciple of the Sword Pavilion in this generation. Now at Qi Refining Great Perfection, having cultivated a great divine ability, she was only a step away from the Foundation Establishment True Lord realm. Even the Sword Pavilion Master had praised her, believing she had a promising future. The reason she came as an external aid to participate in this Battle for the Dao was precisely to slay demons and eliminate evil, to forge an invincible Sword Heart, and thereby break through to Foundation Establishment.

Therefore, an inherent pride resided within her heart. As long as the enemy wasn't Foundation Establishment, she had the confidence to fight them. A sword cultivator would rather bend than break; even if she truly wasn't a match, she must have the courage to draw her sword. How could she remain hidden and cowering forever? If things continued like this, her conviction would be compromised!

Thinking this, a hint of killing intent even flickered in Yun Miaozhen's gaze as she looked at Wang Jinting. To obstruct her conviction was to obstruct her Great Dao. And if anyone obstructed her Great Dao, what did it matter if they were also from the righteous path? To forge an invincible Sword Heart, one naturally needed the resolve to sever all ties. How could one be bound by mere titles? Even parents, children, and siblings could be slain! It would precisely settle the karma of this life and prove a Sword Heart Illumination!

"Calm yourself, Immortal Miaozhen." Seeing the slight change in Yun Miaozhen's expression, Wang Jinting felt a chill run down his spine and quickly said, "I was just about to meet with a fellow Pure Land Daoist. He should know the demonic cultivator's background. Why don't you accompany me to speak with him first, understand the situation, and then if you wish to fight the demonic cultivator, I will absolutely not stop you."

Upon hearing this, Yun Miaozhen lowered her gaze, reined in her killing intent, and nodded slightly. "...Very well."

Wang Jinting finally breathed a sigh of relief. He immediately walked out of the hiding place with Yun Miaozhen. Before long, a bald man in the crowd came into view. Seeing him, Wang Jinting immediately put on a mournful expression and stepped forward, saying, "Fellow Daoist... Sigh, we've also heard about the Pure Land's plight; it's truly disheartening..."

He had assumed the survivor, having narrowly escaped death, would surely be battered and consumed by despair. Yet, to his surprise, the moment he appeared, the Pure Land Buddhist cultivator who had escaped death looked at him with wild joy, pointed, and shouted, "It's him! It's him!"

Wang Jinting was momentarily stunned. *Why this reaction...?*

"...Not good!"

In an instant, Wang Jinting reacted. While retreating swiftly, he also pulled out his [Omniscient Terrain Map] to check the changes in auras on the map. As long as the demonic cultivator's aura appeared, he would immediately flee!

Then he froze, even subconsciously rubbing his eyes. Because on the [Omniscient Terrain Map], centered on him, there was nothing else within a five-thousand-li radius, only a single aura remaining.

The next second, he looked up. Not just him, all the Dao Court cultivators were looking up at this moment, gazing into the distance, for from the depths of the endless sea of clouds, a second sun had startlingly risen.
