# Chapter 120: The Sword Light From the Heavenly Star Cave!

On the southeastern coast, by the beach.

Shi Yuan had ordered a pavilion to be built. Though not particularly sturdy, with no wind or rain today, it provided ample shade.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing lay on a rattan chair, a wooden table beside him laden with two plates of fruit, a pot of tea, two plates of pastries, and a plate of dried meat.

The Five Elements Creation Tree had taken root near the cliff edge not far away, while the Wave-Severing Gu was conserving its energy, amassing venom.

The Wall-Climbing Bird flitted around the shoreline, teasing a flock of seagulls.

The Dragon Girl had plunged into the sea, as joyous as a dragon returning to its domain, swimming freely.

Meanwhile, a few members of the Gao Clan were grilling meat over a fire.

"Little friend Zhengjing, given the gravity of the situation, isn't this a bit too relaxed?" Yuan Zhengfeng whispered. "Gao Xuan is about to come for us. Shouldn't we at least maintain some tension?"

"We've done all we can. Staying tense won't help and will only wear us out. Might as well relax and enjoy ourselves for now," Li Zhengjing replied lazily, stretching as he plucked a grape and popped it into his mouth. "If only I had a pair of sunglasses right now, that'd really set the mood..."

In Jiangshang Prefecture.

The three deities and the Prefect had all received news from Hongshan Town.

The atmosphere grew heavy once more.

What was that kid doing?

At such a critical moment, with a life-and-death battle against a Human Immortal imminent, he was lounging by the beach?

Here they were, three deities and a Prefect, meticulously planning their next move—how could he afford to be so carefree?

"Does he truly have no fear?" the Dragon God of Gu River murmured. "I shall follow the river into the sea and lie in wait to see what his true reliance is. Await my signal, everyone..."

"You're venturing into the sea alone?" the Prefect of Jiangshang asked. "Shall I dispatch some of your subordinates from the Gu River Water Mansion to assist you?"

"No need. Their cultivation is still shallow, and as river creatures, they are ill-suited to the sea. The people's worship is confined to the riverbanks—beyond Gu River, their power wanes."

The Dragon God's explanation made sense. It was akin to freshwater fish being plunged into the ocean—they might not even survive.

As the Dragon God transformed into a white dragon and soared away, the Prefect couldn't help but ask, "As the River God of Gu, won't venturing into the sea weaken him as well?"

The remaining two deities exchanged glances, their expressions odd.

"He's a god of fresh water, not a freshwater fish."

"His divine form ensures he merely loses some power outside his domain. The impact is minimal."

"Meanwhile, we should proceed as the State Preceptor instructed."

"Let us depart."

With that, the two deities vanished, while the Prefect began mobilizing troops, preparing to converge on the southeastern coastal area.

At the border between Linjiang Prefecture and Jiangshang Prefecture, a lone figure sailed into the sea, skirting the edges of Jiangshang Prefecture toward Li Zhengjing's location.

He traveled by sea to avoid alerting the Prefect's official seal.

A sword hung at his waist as he murmured, "Last time, I underestimated Li Zhengjing. Who knew he could stir such chaos in the capital? Now that Gao Xuan has obtained a heaven-defying opportunity, even Li Zhengjing may struggle to handle him..."

This was none other than the Great Xuan Dynasty's State Preceptor, Lin Fuxuan!

He had once intercepted Li Zhengjing but was forced to retreat by the Dragon Girl, losing his Profound Mirror in the process.

Not long ago, hearing of the shattered Imperial Seal and the heavy casualties in the capital, he had gone to investigate—only to be repelled by the newly repaired Imperial Seal wielded by the Great Zhou's State Preceptor.

And the method to repair the Imperial Seal? It had come from Li Zhengjing.

Two consecutive defeats, both tied to Li Zhengjing.

Yet he felt no anger. Instead, he pondered deeply, realizing Li Zhengjing's potential was even greater than he had imagined.

If this youth could be recruited for the Great Xuan Dynasty, the restoration of their rule would be within reach!

Especially now, with the Great Zhou's fortunes waning, the new emperor unable to command respect, regional powers growing restless, and the descent of the Heavenly Star further destabilizing the realm...

"For years, I've dedicated myself to restoring the Great Xuan Dynasty. Though resolute, I knew the odds were slim—the Great Zhou was too strong."

"Generations have passed, and people now see themselves as subjects of the Great Zhou, not the Great Xuan. The path to restoration seemed hopeless."

"But now, chaos has erupted in the Central Plains. Hope is no longer out of reach."

Lin Fuxuan thought to himself, "A once-in-a-millennium opportunity... If seized, I could become the first State Preceptor of the new dynasty, commanding the fortunes of the entire Central Plains, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the leaders of immortal sects!"

As these thoughts crossed his mind, he noticed turbulent waters ahead.

He halted his boat, focusing his vision to pierce through illusions.

Beneath the waves, a dragon swam, its magic isolating the surrounding seawater.

"The Dragon God of Gu River? It can't adapt to the sea?"

Lin Fuxuan's eyes narrowed as he followed silently. "It must be heading toward Li Zhengjing... When it strikes, I'll ambush it from behind. Let the Great Zhou lose another deity!"

---

Amidst the brewing storm, Li Zhengjing lounged comfortably on the beach, nearly dozing off.

But soon, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice reached his ears.

"Less than thirty li away—Gao Xuan is coming."

"Good."

Li Zhengjing rose leisurely, fastening his robes and tucking Yuan Zhengfeng's remnant jade into his mouth. With a wave of his hand, the Wall-Climbing Bird reluctantly left the seagulls and landed beside the Gao Clan members.

"Your Third Elder is here," the bird announced.

"Third Elder..." A woman named Gao Lin still couldn't believe their kindest elder had come to devour them.

"The imperial forces are after him, and Immortal Zhengjing uncovered the truth. Third Elder must be in trouble," the eldest Gao youth muttered. "He wouldn't harm us. Whoever's coming to kill us now... may not be him."

"Immortal Zhengjing is renowned across the land. He once abandoned a formation that could have refined thousands of cultivators, Human Immortals, and deities into divine pills. He wouldn't target us without cause," another Gao youth said, his expression conflicted.

"You're all quite sharp. I thought we'd have to deal with some fools," the Wall-Climbing Bird chuckled. "With your meager skills, harming you would be effortless. Rest assured—if the master says he'll protect you, you'll be safe."

"Third Elder is here."

Gao Lin looked ahead.

From the direction of Hongshan Town, an old man emerged slowly from the trees.

His aura radiated outward as he walked across the land.

He didn't arrive on clouds or with grand phenomena.

But wherever he passed, the surrounding trees withered instantly.

His eyes were murky, yet deep within his pupils burned a savage light.

When he saw his descendants, his expression twisted with complex emotions—like a parched man in a desert finally spotting water and food.

Yet his aged, gaunt face contorted further, as if wrestling with himself, before settling into ravenous bloodlust.

He took a step forward, his aura flaring as he lunged!

But at that moment, a thunderclap boomed across the clear sky!

Then came a barrage of lightning-infused blade lights!

Gao Xuan halted abruptly.

Before him, five scorched gashes, each dozens of zhang long, marred the beach.

"Too hasty..."

Li Zhengjing gripped the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Blade, his expression odd. "I predicted your movement and slashed five times, each slightly off your path. Yet you stopped dead. Did you predict my prediction, or has your mind rotted away in the Heavenly Star Cave?"

"You seek death!"

Gao Xuan, though frenzied, wasn't entirely mindless. Enraged, he charged at Li Zhengjing!

His aura surged—yet no magic power manifested.

Instead, an incredibly sharp energy erupted from his hand!

With a mere flick of his sleeve, a sword light shot forth!

Despite being at the Qi Refinement realm, the sword light he unleashed was terrifyingly potent.

"What?!"

Li Zhengjing's heart jolted. His expression turned grave. "That's the Great Derivation Void-Severing Sword Qi!"

Without hesitation, he channeled his 365 strands of magic power into a dragon.

The dragon's maw opened, unleashing 365 sword beams that merged into a roaring river!

Li Zhengjing's Great Derivation Void-Severing Sword Qi clashed with Gao Xuan's sword light!

BOOM!

The collision sent shockwaves rippling outward.

Li Zhengjing retreated, shouting, "Get them into the sea!"

The Gao Clan members had served their purpose as bait. Staying would only get them killed.

The Wall-Climbing Bird spread its wings, grasping two with its claws, one in its beak, and another dangling from its tail feathers.

Though small, it managed to carry all four, flying comically over the sea before circling at a safe distance.

Back on the beach, sensing his kin growing farther away, Gao Xuan's eyes burned with madness. He leaped, intent on pursuit.

But Li Zhengjing intercepted him with the Dragon-Patterned Blade, unleashing the Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Saber Technique while his 365 sword beams clashed with Gao Xuan's light!

The beach was torn apart!

Sand turned to ash as the ground collapsed, seawater rushing in as if their battle had moved onto the ocean itself!

"Little friend Zhengjing, his sword light is stronger than yours," Yuan Zhengfeng observed.

"What kind of opportunity did he obtain?" Li Zhengjing wondered. "He's still at the Qi Refinement realm, yet each sword light he fires—using only a wisp of Qi—is this powerful?"

His own Great Derivation Void-Severing Sword Qi was fueled by Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power.

Perhaps because Yuan Zhengfeng's magic wasn't self-cultivated, the sword beams were slightly weaker.

But Gao Xuan wasn't using magic—just Qi!

Even at the peak of the Qi Refinement realm, Li Zhengjing's sword beams couldn't match Gao Xuan's light.

What had he gained?

"Notice his right hand!" Yuan Zhengfeng said suddenly.

A seasoned warrior in life, Yuan Zhengfeng had participated in every one of Li Zhengjing's battles.

Now, his sharp eyes caught the detail—Gao Xuan's sword light originated from his right hand!

Aside from that, everything else about him matched a Qi Refinement cultivator. Even the spells from his left hand were mundane—pale in comparison to his right's sword light.

"Did he obtain a sword-based divine ability in the Heavenly Star Cave, grafting it to his right arm—like my left?" Li Zhengjing mused, stepping back. "In a direct fight, I'm slightly outmatched."

On the cliff, the Five Elements Creation Tree aimed the Profound Mirror at Gao Xuan, beams of light shooting forth.

But Gao Xuan's right hand flicked, erecting a barrier of sword light that dissolved the mirror's rays.

"So strong?!" The tree shuddered, abandoning plans to deploy the Wave-Severing Gu. "Can the master handle this?"

Suddenly, draconic roars echoed as 25 golden dragons burst from the sand, encircling Gao Xuan!

Buddhist beads previously buried now activated, forming a radiant formation to trap him.

"Victory already?" The Wall-Climbing Bird flew back, seeing Gao Xuan ensnared.

"Not so fast."

A voice came from the clouds. The bird looked up to see a hand emerge, grabbing its green horn and yanking it skyward.

"Uncle Guiguzi?" The bird blinked.

Beside Guiguzi sat another figure—cross-legged, masked in bronze, his aura feeble yet profound.

The Third Generation Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Ship of Salvation!

"Gao Xuan remains at Qi Refinement. So does Li Zhengjing."

"But Li Zhengjing, through机缘 (opportunities), wields Human Immortal combat power. Gao Xuan's机缘 leans toward offense—sharper, fiercer..."

The Heavenly Venerable said coolly, "Earlier, Gao Xuan repelled the Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect at the Heavenly Star Cave of Flame Pass Mountain. Now he's crippled two imperial deities..."

Guiguzi whispered, "His current display isn't enough to defeat two联手 (working together)."

The Heavenly Venerable replied calmly, "Though mad, he's holding back. How peculiar."

BOOM!

The Buddhist formation shattered!

Three golden dragons were bisected, dissipating as they fell.

"Damn it! Three dragons lost—it'll take three months to restore the Pillar Dragons!" the bird cursed.

Then Gao Xuan's blood and Qi churned, surging like magic power as he pressed toward Li Zhengjing!

"Qi fused with blood, mimicking magic power?!"

Li Zhengjing watched as Gao Xuan's hair grayed further, his skin withering, his frame hunching.

Yet his aura grew even stronger!
