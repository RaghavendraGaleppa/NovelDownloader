# Chapter 233: Sweeping Through Immortal and Divine Paths [Two Chapters Merged]

A wheat-skinned female strength practitioner carefully placed several sealed jars on the table, then retreated far away. The jars were made of different materials—some lead, some spiritual crystals, some exotic bones—but all were inscribed with the special runes of the Immortal Daoist Sanctuary. An inner disciple introduced, "These jars contain heavenly discards, extremely dangerous. Once you get contaminated, most people come to no good end."

Qin Ming nodded, then waved for them to withdraw, preparing to approach cautiously himself. He was deeply immersed, fully committed, and as his concentration peaked, he continuously "turned pages," accelerating the process of this experimental cultivation.

"What is this?" Four months later, one side of his neck swelled up. Upon internal inspection, it was a head, nearly fully formed. Not only that, other parts of his body were also protruding. Was this a terrifying mutation? He quickly lowered his head to inspect carefully, realizing that such chaotic organ growth would not do! This was malignant growth, putting a burden on his body, yet it didn't yield any divine enhancement. What good was such a "tumor"? Qin Ming sighed inwardly, no wonder they were called discards; they were all negative. Initially, he had wanted to study whether his Heavenly Radiance could absorb some of their dangerous properties. Perhaps a palm strike could give an opponent a giant head, and another strike could cause them to mutate, growing an extra leg afterwards. But in the end, he gave up, because the returns were far less than the effort; to kill a thousand enemies, he would have to harm himself three thousand.

"'Searching for forbidden items isn't about the stranger or more monstrous, the better or stronger,' Qin Ming sighed. Thankfully, this was just acting, an experience, not a real occurrence, otherwise it would be truly perverse. He continued his verification, opening the second jar."

He immersed himself once more, experiencing the hardships and difficulties of an external saint. This time, the "exotic substance" was quite lethal, severely eroding his flesh and blood. Once contaminated, it was incredibly difficult to get rid of. Qin Ming accelerated the "process" of time. In his unique vision, after prolonged contact with these substances, he became extremely wretched, parts of his flesh dissolving. He shivered. Indeed, there was a reason why the ancient Immortal Daoist Sanctuary's experts classified them as "heavenly discards"; they were all dregs. Qin Ming, unwilling to give up, dragged his "mutilated body," continuing his role-play, trying all the discards in every jar. By the end, he was almost ready to "die" there. This was even with him being a quasi-core disciple, consuming various precious medicinal powders daily to restore his body's vitality; otherwise, he would have died suddenly long ago.

It could be said that he really put himself through the wringer during this trial. When he exited the role-play and viewed it from an outsider's perspective, he realized that the so-called grand medicines and discards were merely wisps of qi, all illusions. Qin Ming knew his time in this Immortal Daoist Sanctuary was limited, because once he "died suddenly," he would be forced out of the simulation and leave. During this period, he collected some immortal alchemy formulas and obtained scriptures accessible only to quasi-core disciples. Finally, he "died young" here and was forced to depart.

Chen Bingyan, Ren Yiping, and others were somewhat lost in thought. The person hailed as the strongest young strength practitioner had actually "died peacefully" so quickly? Qin Ming sat in the thick fog before the mountain gate, taking a long time to recover. He had been too deeply immersed; the experience of arduously cultivating over the years, and the final experience of death, all felt real. "This place is truly absurd. If you have regrets in life, you can start over!"

He knew that this place was most effective for immortal seeds and divine seeds. Some of them had already entered the Third Realm, and a few might even replace the core disciples of this place. Qin Ming planned to rest and digest what he had gained. He relayed all the alchemy formulas to Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan.

Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan wanted to invite experts from the Immortal Path to retaliate against the newcomer, but after a long search, they couldn't find a suitable candidate. They simply didn't have enough influence. The top immortal seeds were busy infiltrating different dojos, competing for core disciple positions and gaining various benefits; who would bother with them? The two were familiar with Li Qingxu, but the current Immortal Seed Li was trapped in a strange loop. After his crushing defeat in the secret realm, he continued to hit walls here. Li Qingxu had entered three orthodoxies in a row, and after deep immersion, he clashed with ancient prodigies, only to suffer disastrous defeats every time.

He even mocked himself, saying he should change his name to Li Defeat. However, no one criticized him this time, nor did anyone dare to look down on him, because this time he was fighting truly formidable opponents. Many who dared to challenge them all ended up losing. In the ancient top dojos, certain exceptionally talented individuals in the Second Realm were indeed far stronger than many had anticipated. Several mountain gates and a few special individuals had become very famous, regarded as unprovokable quasi-core disciples. After Qin Ming's "death," he could no longer enter the first dojo. After resting, he stepped into another mountain gate.

He decided to be pragmatic and not to casually choose those malevolent auras or exotic substances anymore. He planned to first cultivate and establish a solid foundation before seeking rare materials to nourish his Heavenly Radiance and then perform experiments. However, before that, he had to obtain a sufficiently high status, otherwise, he wouldn't be able to acquire resources here. The second dojo had an extraordinary immortal aura; clouds transformed into great dragons, circling in the sky, and golden sun-tree forests stretched across the mountains.

At this moment, the tranquility was shattered as a fierce battle erupted within a golden forest. "It's him! I've been avoiding him, not wanting revenge anymore, so why did he follow again?" Zheng Maoze's pupils contracted as he once again saw that detestable newcomer. Zeng Yuan was even more dumbfounded, because that contemporary strength practitioner was fighting one of the toughest nuts to crack. Recently, a large number of Immortal Path disciples had hit a brick wall, unable to defeat this person.

Qin Ming felt a bit of existential doubt because the fight was incredibly difficult. His opponent was a white-haired youth, whose immortal techniques emerged endlessly, even possessing a "mind-slash" that seemed to disregard space, its dazzling sword light cutting right before his forehead. At the critical moment, Qin Ming activated the *Golden Silkworm Scripture*, using its "Golden Silkworm Force Field" as a trump card to distort that spiritual sword light, thereby neutralizing the opponent's attack. In this battle, Qin Ming and the white-haired youth exchanged blows over a hundred times, continuously employing trump cards. He repeatedly smashed with the "Wuji Seal" and unleashed the killing move, the "Lihuo Shuttle," before finally making the opponent vomit blood profusely and tearing his body apart. Each of the Eight Marvelous Arts corresponded to a specific trump card, and Qin Ming had to use at least five of these unique techniques to finally slay this tenacious opponent.

He sat there reflecting, wondering if he had become overconfident recently. Why was this fight so hard? This opponent was at the mid-stage of the Second Realm, one minor realm higher than him, yet it required him to use ruthless methods and unleash all his techniques to finally defeat him. Li Qingxu was probably also at the mid-stage of the Second Realm. Qin Ming had thought that even if he was only at the early stage of this realm, he could still kill Li Qingxu, but now he began to seriously ponder whether he had overestimated himself. "Hmm, early stages aren't all the same. I haven't absorbed exotic substances or mastered corresponding cultivation methods yet; I'm still at a blank slate stage, with room for improvement." He reassured himself.

In the distance, both the ancient disciples and those currently immersed in the simulation were shaken. Who was that? That was one of the "immortal bones" most difficult to chew among the major mountain gates. Many formidable individuals from the Pure Land, Immortal Earth, and Blight Land had gone to challenge him, only to be brutally beaten. Now, a newcomer had taken down this white-haired youth, replacing him! Li Qingxu's devastating defeat had begun with facing this very person, leading to his collapse.

"Impossible?!" Some people couldn't believe it, finding it utterly preposterous! Could this be a hidden disciple personally taught by one of the Ancestors of the New Generation Path, taken as a closed-door student in this era?! Otherwise, it simply couldn't be explained; how could there be such an over-the-top external saint? "You two again, come here!" Qin Ming spotted Zheng Dazhuang and Zeng Yuan in the distance.

"What... what do you want?" Both of them now had psychological trauma. This newcomer was simply defying heaven; he had even slain someone the Immortal Seed Li Qingxu couldn't defeat. Qin Ming said, "You two... come serve as my strength practitioners." "You... you're turning the world upside down!" Zeng Yuan cried out. With a bang, his spiritual light of consciousness shattered, but this time he wasn't sent away. He knew the other party intentionally held back, restraining his power.

Subsequently, people in the present world showed strange expressions, seeing two Immortal Path disciples actually serving as strength practitioners for a newcomer. Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan caved in quickly; just two slaps had completely reshaped their worldview. Qin Ming, however, felt apathetic. He waved them away, intending to conduct his experiments here and not truly expose himself to such individuals. This time, using his status as a quasi-core disciple, he acquired various precious medicines and other resources, then began cultivating from the *Boshu Fa* of the Second Realm.

This was his fundamental scripture, profoundly abstruse, naturally containing the health-preserving techniques required for the Second Realm, capable of resisting the erosion of refining malevolent qi and absorbing exotic substances. "After reaching the Second Realm, the plant and wood qi drawn from circulating the *Yimu Scripture* isn't suitable for fusing into Heavenly Radiance, but it's excellent for nourishing the physical body, which is good." In fact, every Marvelous Art contained methods for preserving health; each was a complete system, not just a simple energy technique or a single trump card. Even the ferocious *Lihuo Scripture* could refine the physical body with fire, a unique form of cultivation that stimulated the physique.

"The Five Elements Marvelous Arts, connecting internally to the five zang organs, with the five scriptures resonating together, seem to have excellent health-preserving effects." In this dojo, Qin Ming's early stage was dedicated to cultivation, "strengthening internally," and consuming the sect's precious medicines to accelerate the process. Afterwards, he seriously and thoughtfully pondered how to choose divine exotic substances. "Before an external saint breaks through to the mid-stage, how do I want my Heavenly Radiance to change? Day in one thought, night in another!" With this goal, the selection process began.

Using his status, Qin Ming began to request various Earthly Fiends, Nine Heavens Pure Qi, and other substances. "Most substances related to night are yin-attributed exotic substances, while those related to day are mostly yang-attributed." Qin Ming embarked on his experimental cultivation journey once more. In the end, with a single thought, his Heavenly Radiance became as black as ink, covering the ground where he stood. With another thought, he himself became like a blazing sun in the sky. "Even with abundant resources, it still took a considerable amount of time," Qin Ming frowned. Most importantly, when he tested the power of his Heavenly Radiance, it was only "decent," still falling short of his expectations.

"This won't do. It relies too much on external objects. If I had Solar Fire Essence and Lunar Quintessence, without a doubt, my day and night Heavenly Radiance would be stronger." But where in the current world could he gather all sorts of top-tier exotic substances? "Since ultimately one must shed external influences and cleanse oneself of lead and splendor, could I perhaps not use various exotic substances from the start, and still rapidly stimulate Heavenly Radiance to undergo nirvana?" Currently, Qin Ming was not entirely satisfied with the time consumed, the exotic substances required, or the final power. He felt it needed to be more ingenious. Qin Ming repeatedly experimented, constantly verifying, and finally, in this dojo, he once again "died young" due to his relentless trials.

After "dying" again, he rushed to the next dojo. In the third dojo, Qin Ming learned that its treasury contained the sap of the Kunling Ruin's Immortal Tree. He therefore suspected that this sect might also have living people. "Are the strength practitioners of later generations so desperate? What is he doing, drawing extraterrestrial starlight essence into his flesh? Is he crazy? Hmm, as expected, he died suddenly, trial failed."

Qin Ming moved from one dojo to the next as if attending a series of events. The dojo he now entered had many disciples of an esoteric sect. He was inspired by the complex terrain here, suspecting that someone in ancient times had subdued this place, used its essence to become a god, and then severed their connection to it.

"Could my Heavenly Radiance do the same? Use a borrowed chicken to lay an egg?" Qin Ming thought of many things, inevitably linking them to the contents of the *Fate-Changing Scripture*. Soon, he became a core disciple, discovering various choices upon stepping onto the divine path. He studied one of them, meticulously pondering the unique terrains.

"Hmm?" In the end, Qin Ming threw himself into the situation, "dying suddenly" in a grotto with an anomalous magnetic field. "Though the immersion is deep, one shouldn't take it seriously afterwards. Death, what is there to fear? Just change to another one!"

In the second esoteric sect dojo, Qin Ming defeated a very formidable young disciple, once again causing a stir. Undoubtedly, this was another "divine bone" difficult to gnaw through; he had blocked many esoteric sect elites, all of whom had failed to challenge him.

"Who is this person? He's too ferocious! He actually cleaved that ancient prodigy who was blocking the way right down the middle! My ears are ringing!" Although it was all role-play, the ancient people seen hadn't lived to this era, yet their combat power was absolutely real. Such a scene stunned many people.

Some familiar faces were there, such as Xin Youdao, Lu Yuzhi, and Zhuo Ya; they were all dual-path cultivators and watched in astonishment. Only Xin Youdao understood who it was; even though he knew his background, he was still somewhat dazed at the moment. Today, Qin Ming fought his way through both the Immortal and Divine paths, solely to make mistakes and explore the path suitable for himself!

On this day, he "died suddenly" eight times in total. The experimental cultivation yielded good results; he summarized many valuable experiences. Primarily, he had truly practiced by repeatedly putting himself through the wringer and courting death.

During this period, Qin Ming discovered that some people who had become too deeply immersed in the role-play truly couldn't exit and were about to be assimilated into the simulation. However, he didn't find Ning Siqi, which made him sigh in relief. Qin Ming believed that at least three orthodoxies still contained living people! Not only had he discovered this, but some immortal and divine seeds also sensed it and wanted to facilitate contact between the ancient Immortal Daoist Sanctuaries and the contemporary Immortal Path and Esoteric Sects.

In the first dojo, shrouded in white mist, several crystal coffins showed signs of life reviving, and they were conversing. Chu Pianran said, "In this era, even strength practitioners are incredibly strong. We should go out, otherwise we will be eliminated by the times." "Indeed, we should seize this opportunity to escape Kunling. If this place is sealed again, who knows when the next era will arrive." "The descendants who inherited our orthodoxies, they are close to immortals yet abandon immortality, solely seeking truth. Their spirit is greater than ours; we can interact with them more and see how splendid this era of a hundred schools of thought contending is."

Qin Ming mused that, with the Immortal and Divine paths, plus the Ghost Path of the Underworld, at least three ancient paths were sealed within the Kunling domain! This time, some underworld areas appeared, and Immortal Daoist Sanctuaries emerged, effectively releasing some spirits and deities, adding new hues to this night-mist world. On the same day, Little Wu also visited several dojos, gaining considerable harvests. "Let's go, leave this place first," Qin Ming said. In fact, people from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, Heaven-Propping Sect, Jade Purity Gate, and other organizations had also arrived, and having learned that there were living people here, they too were preparing to withdraw.

In a sense, the revived Immortal Daoist Sanctuaries here were closely related to the later generations' Outer Lands and Esoteric Sects. The scriptures Qin Ming obtained were all related to immortals and gods. He somewhat looked down on the methods of those ancient strength practitioners; those old seniors' lives were truly a bit hard. Such people were euphemistically called "strength practitioners," but in reality, they were servants. In this era, some people wanted to recreate that scenario, defining the newcomers as strength practitioners.

Qin Ming frowned and said, "With several Ancestors having passed away, are the people of the New Generation Path truly going to be reduced to strength practitioners?" "That is our worry!" In Yellow Sand City, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan both sighed. However, upon arriving at Red Beauty Inn and seeing the former number one beauty, now over a hundred years old, smiles once again bloomed on their aged faces, like wrinkled old orange peels smoothing out. "Ah Yan, you are still as radiant as ever!" When Qin Ming and Little Wu heard this, they felt goosebumps prickle all over and quickly left.

Days later, Kunling, which had recently settled into peace, once again experienced a shocking change. Blood-red heavenly thunder surged, and crimson lightning intertwined, covering the entire sky above the region. The dense black clouds were dispersed, and the entire land once again saw the night sky. That day, the Underworld region was filled with wails and howls; it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it a night of ten thousand ghosts. Whether slumbering or already roaming, those half-decayed monsters screamed and fled. Their disadvantage was that they were truly close to decaying, their consciousness blurred, and the cold underworld could not completely freeze their lifespans.

Therefore, many who walked the Ghost Path were now in a daze, having made no prior arrangements for their retreat. Only a small group of fully revived ghost cultivators fled frantically, rushing out of the Kunling domain. Undeniably, from then on, the night-mist world gained another path. The Ghost Path, one of the great ancient evil paths, reappeared in the human world, and in this era of a hundred schools contending, it too was about to be re-established.

As for the Immortal Daoist Sanctuary area, some living people had indeed "frozen" their lifespans and walked out intact. And when Kunling underwent another drastic change, they calmly traversed the night mist and departed. In the outside world, people saw the black mist dissipate, and many mountains blurring, slowly disappearing. The recently expanded Kunling was about to return to its former state. "Kunling is sealed again!"

"Are the Ancestors returning?" Instantly, people were in an uproar. The news spread to all corners, unsettling the entire night-mist world, astonishing everyone. Between heaven and earth, terrifying blood-red lightning shattered black clouds, striking down upon various legendary lands. Some people observed from afar that if the lightning strikes were connected, they formed a regular, mysterious pattern. Boom! The earth blurred, mountains receded into the distance, and some areas completely vanished!

Just as people had expected, on that day, terrifying fluctuations emanated from afar. Ancestor-level figures had returned and were engaged in a great battle. "You demons, you fantasize about completely sealing us into the unknown reaches of ancient Kunling? Is that even possible? It's time for reckoning!" With just this one sentence, people understood what had happened in recent days. The Ancestors of various paths had unexpectedly left the current world and entered the sealed lands, but in the end, they had returned calmly and were now ready to confront the Auspicious Beast and its allies.

The Auspicious Beast and its allies had been strengthening the seal, attempting to block their path back, but they failed, and now the passage had been breached. In truth, these Ancestors would have returned long ago if they hadn't been exploring secrets.

"You are truly audacious, colluding with races from the depths of the night-mist world! We haven't even pioneered yet, and already demons have arrived from afar." Outside the Third Forbidden Zone, an exceedingly terrifying battle erupted. Not only did the earlier figures make their moves, but the trumpet calls of elephants pierced the night sky from afar, as Dragon-Elephants also arrived from distant lands to join the fray. Furthermore, old seniors from the Immortal Path, standing within golden great suns, descended through the clouds, diving towards the battlefield. This was a fierce battle, but its outcome was already predetermined.

All the Auspicious Beast could rely on was its attempt to unexpectedly seal everyone into the ancient Kunling lands, but it failed. Beneath the night sky, the enormous golden beast-shadow roared, standing like a small mountain. It was already injured, and now its body was torn apart. Multiple Ancestors jointly attacked the Auspicious Beast, contending for its auspicious blood that could extend lifespans! In addition, several other demons were also severely wounded.

On this day, the plateau outside the Third Forbidden Zone was breached. The Auspicious Beast dwelling nearby and its summoned helpers were all slain; not a single top-tier demon escaped. People witnessed golden Auspicious Beast blood splattering. After it exploded, its remains were divided among them, and multiple blazing suns swept across the sky, leaving no drop of blood behind. "According to the original plan, the hunt begins now! All juniors can participate! Don't let any demon on this plateau escape!" "This is a rough preview of a grand pioneering!" "Participants will be rewarded based on their strength and achievements, which will naturally include Auspicious Beast blood!" That night, these words spread throughout the Kunling vicinity.

It was like a great ship that had deviated from its course, now being recalibrated back to its original trajectory. "The entire plateau has been sealed off! No demon can escape, even with wings! Slay them all within half a day!" That night, all parties were making intense preparations.

The next day, armies set out from various directions, charging towards the plateau outside the Third Forbidden Zone. "Everyone, whoever captures the demon seed 'Demon One' will be rewarded with a double portion of Auspicious Beast blood!" As the various forces advanced, a voice echoed through the night sky like booming heavenly thunder. At the same time, various discussions rose and fell. "Speaking of which, there hasn't been any news of him for a long time. He didn't enter the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, so where did he end up?" "Even if he's a heterodox cultivator, what then? Exceptional talent holds no future; he can only walk the hopeless New Generation Path, nothing to worry about." "However, I somewhat suspect that he might have cultivated the *Boshu Fa*!"

The Kunling domain was swept by raging winds and clouds; all parties charged towards that plateau, intending to resolve the battle within half a day.
