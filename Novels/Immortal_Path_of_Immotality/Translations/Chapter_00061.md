# Chapter 61: The Pursuers Arrive

Lin Shan and Master Huang raced northwest for roughly two days before feeling somewhat safe. They then turned northeast, as Yi River lay in the eastern part of the Yan Yun Mountain Range, and they had strayed too far off course.

During their detour, they passed through territories of many high-level demonic beasts. By day, they could see flocks of birds crying overhead, and by night, they spotted massive, mountain-like shadows moving in the distance. 

Master Huang's expression grew grave as he warned that they had likely ventured deep into the heart of the Yan Yun Mountains, nearing the forbidden zones. These forbidden areas, marked by generations of cultivators through bloody lessons, contained treacherous terrain, bizarre poisonous creatures, and even legendary ten-thousand-year-old demons capable of human transformation. 

Though they were only at the fringes, the number of demonic beasts comparable to Qi Refinement cultivators had increased significantly. If they stumbled into a beast horde, survival would be a matter of luck. 

Yet turning back meant risking another bloody encounter with their pursuers. The ambush by Princess Guo and the brocade-robed man had clearly been well-planned, with more allies waiting across the stream. Their enemies were either in pursuit or lying in wait along the main route to Yi River—perhaps even blocking the southern entrance to Yi River's market. 

Their only option was to circle north through the dangerous beast territories. Though perilous, cautious navigation offered a chance of survival. Neither Lin Shan nor Master Huang was one to hesitate, and once decided, they pressed forward resolutely.

A day later, they passed a volcano where crimson spirit trees swayed atop its slopes. After waiting half an hour, a massive black-and-red serpent slithered past, its tongue flickering. Both men broke into a cold sweat, grateful they hadn't acted rashly. Knowing the area was guarded, they retreated.

The next day, they stumbled into a territory of apes and were pelted with boulders by the muscular beasts. Lin Shan's mastery of the Wind Riding Technique saved Master Huang from a beating. 

Over the following days, dangers and troubles persisted, but Yi River drew nearer. As daylight travel in the depths of the mountains proved too hazardous, they adopted a nocturnal routine.

...

After days of travel, they rested beneath a tree. 

Lin Shan, exhausted, asked, "Brother Huang, how did you ever make it to Yi River before, given how dangerous these mountains are?"

Master Huang shook his head. "The Yan Yun Range spans thousands of miles, mostly untamed wilderness with multiple forbidden zones. But the path we took earlier was cleared by ancient cultivators, so it was relatively safe."

Lin Shan recalled the ambush. "Safe or not depends on the enemy. Princess Guo clearly had our route scouted out and knew exactly where to strike." 

A realization struck him. "There might be a traitor among our six, feeding her information!"

Master Huang remained indifferent, as if he'd already suspected as much, his gaze distant.

Under the moonlight, they sat by a fire, lost in thought. Lin Shan pieced together clues and suddenly remembered something he'd overlooked—the green gourd.

"That green gourd!" he exclaimed, startling Master Huang. 

"If the green-robed elder hid a soul fragment inside, he won't give up easily!" Lin Shan's eyes burned with urgency as he demanded, "Give me the gourd with your spirit insects!"

Master Huang looked bewildered. "Soul fragment? What are you talking about?"

Just then, applause echoed through the trees as a fierce wind rose. 

"To uncover my hidden soul fragment—impressive, Fellow Daoist Lin!" 

Out stepped the green-robed elder, clapping slowly. 

Both men sprang to their feet. Lin Shan scanned the surroundings for hidden foes while Master Huang demanded, "How did you track us?" 

The elder smirked. "Multiple ways. My soul fragment was in the gourd, my blood essence marks your spirit insects, and my beasts remember your scent." 

His expression darkened. "You led me on quite the chase. Today, you stay here for good!"

Lin Shan remained wary. "Are you alone?"

The elder cackled. "Fellow Daoist Lin, after you wounded Princess Guo, did you think I'd come unprepared?" 

Before they could react, a hook-nosed man emerged behind them, cutting off their escape. 

The elder had stalled to allow his ally to flank them. 

"No more delays," the hook-nosed man said, drawing his hooked blade. "Before Princess Guo arrives, we end this."

His words revealed the stakes—Princess Guo's group was nearby, forcing Lin Shan and Master Huang to fight now or lose any chance of escape.

"Fine! If you want my treasures, you'll have to take them!" Master Huang knew he couldn't escape alone. 

The elder summoned hundreds of glowing moths from a gourd, then coaxed, "Fellow Daoist Lin, your skills and treasures are formidable. Leave now, and we won't stop you." 

The hook-nosed man frowned but stayed silent. Master Huang tensed, watching Lin Shan's reaction.

A heavy silence fell, thick with tension. 

Then, slowly, Lin Shan drew a blue three-foot sword from his pouch. Stroking its intricate patterns, he smiled at Master Huang, teeth gleaming. 

"Brother Huang, when I fought Princess Guo, you stood by me in my darkest hour." 

"Today, I'll stand with you against these two."
