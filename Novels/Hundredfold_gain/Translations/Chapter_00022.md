# Chapter 22: Dominating the Hall, the True Dark Horse

The great hall fell into absolute silence.

Countless gazes turned toward Qi Li and Qi Huo, sensing the Qi Refinement second-level spiritual pressure emanating from them. The crowd fell into speechless silence.

Seriously? Even Qi Refinement second-level cultivators were stepping forward to compete for this inner sect spot?

Were they overly confident, or had they simply not received the news that there was a fourth-grade spiritual root in the clan whose cultivation had likely reached at least Qi Refinement third-level peak?

In truth, Qi Li and Qi Huo were indeed uninformed. 

With no background or connections, these grassroots cultivators had no elders in the main lineage to rely on. In fact, they were even more isolated than Qi Chuan, who at least could obtain information through Second Elder Qi Bai Cang.

Since entering the main lineage, the two had focused solely on cultivation. After four years, they had reached Qi Refinement second-level but remained largely ignorant of clan affairs.

Now, suddenly learning about the competition for one inner sect spot and three outer sect spots, how could they not take the chance? After all, there was nothing to lose.

What if they got lucky?

But reality was cruel.

At the front, the clan leader and elders watched the scene unfold with helpless expressions. They had expected Qi Refinement third-level youths to compete, but second-level was pushing it.

Several elders exchanged glances before the Transmission Elder signaled his granddaughter with a look.

In the hall, Qi Chan'er noticed her grandfather's gaze and nodded slightly. She stood up, her voice clear and confident.

"Clan Leader, esteemed elders, this junior Qi Chan'er believes she qualifies for the inner sect spot. My current cultivation level..."

"Qi Refinement fourth-level!"

As her calm words fell, she released the spiritual pressure of a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator without restraint, causing ripples in the air.

When this pressure spread through the hall, the crowd was stunned into silence, faces filled with shock.

"Qi Refinement fourth-level? Not third-level peak?"

"As expected of a fourth-grade spiritual root!"

"She's only fourteen, right? Mid-stage Qi Refinement at fourteen—such terrifying talent and limitless potential!"

"It seems the inner sect spot is hers without question."

Everyone was astonished.

Though they knew Qi Chan'er possessed a fourth-grade spiritual root, breaking through mid-stage bottlenecks was still challenging. Even with superior spiritual roots, bad luck could delay progress for extended periods—there was an element of unpredictability.

For Qi Chan'er to reach mid-stage Qi Refinement at fourteen with a fourth-grade spiritual root was remarkable, further cementing her reputation as a prodigy.

The competition for the inner sect spot appeared to be a foregone conclusion.

Indeed, reality seemed to confirm this.

When Qi Chan'er stood up, Qi Li and Qi Huo exchanged embarrassed glances, their faces flushing red before they immediately sat back down.

They were the same age, yet she had already reached mid-stage while they remained at second-level. How could they possibly compete?

Had they known earlier, they wouldn't have embarrassed themselves by trying.

Meanwhile, the other young cultivators under eighteen in the hall also abandoned any thoughts of competing with Qi Chan'er.

Among them, even the strongest—disregarding age—were only at Qi Refinement third-level peak, still below Qi Chan'er's level. 

And those at third-level peak were older than her.

They could only concede and set their sights on the outer sect spots instead.

At the front of the hall, Clan Leader Qi Wu You and the elders observed the scene without surprise. Many nodded approvingly at Qi Chan'er.

Reaching Qi Refinement fourth-level at fourteen earned her high marks in their eyes.

The Transmission Elder stroked his white beard, pride and satisfaction evident as he watched his granddaughter dominate the hall effortlessly.

But this was just the beginning.

Once she entered the inner sect of Fengyue Sect, her future would be even brighter. He believed that with her determined personality, her achievements wouldn't stop at late-stage Qi Refinement—reaching the tenth-level Great Perfection was almost guaranteed. By then, she could return to the clan as a Grand Elder.

As for Foundation Establishment...

That remained merely a hope. Even with her fourth-grade spiritual root and inner sect status, she would still need to compete for the position of a true disciple—a "Foundation Establishment seed"—to obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill.

Without the pill, she would have to settle for lesser spiritual materials, significantly reducing her chances of success...

As these thoughts raced through the Transmission Elder's mind, Clan Leader Qi Wu You surveyed the hall. With Qi Chan'er standing alone, he nodded in approval.

The outcome seemed clear.

He knew Qi Chan'er's talent well—none of the Qi Clan's youths could rival her.

After a brief pause, he declared, "If no one else wishes to compete, I hereby announce that the inner sect spot goes to Qi—"

"Junior Qi Chuan has also reached Qi Refinement fourth-level!"

Just as the name "Qi Chan'er" was about to leave his lips, another calm voice unexpectedly rang through the hall.

What?

The declaration sent shockwaves through the entire assembly—Clan Leader Qi Wu You, the elders, and dozens of cultivators present all turned toward the source.

In a corner of the hall, a clear-eyed young man rose slowly. He clasped his hands respectfully toward the clan leader and elders before speaking evenly.

"Clan Leader, esteemed elders, this junior believes I too qualify for the inner sect spot."

"My age is comparable to Qi Chan'er's."

With these words, Qi Chuan activated his Evergreen Art. As his mana flowed, the restrained spiritual pressure of a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator unfurled, filling every corner of the hall unmistakably.

The genuine Qi Refinement fourth-level pressure was now on full display for all to witness.

And its owner was a previously unknown, unremarkable youth.

As this scene unfolded, the great hall plunged into utter silence—so quiet one could hear a pin drop. Every face bore expressions of complete astonishment.
