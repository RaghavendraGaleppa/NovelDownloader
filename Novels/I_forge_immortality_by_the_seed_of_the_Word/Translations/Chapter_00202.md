# Chapter 199: Returning to the Dao Gate, Void Creatures

Behind the heavy, ancient stone gate, the spirit of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm stood, watching Zhang Jing and Feng Wuyu's receding figures with a complex expression.

Soon, their figures faded, leaving only a sigh echoing in the air. "Tsk, another young master. The distribution of fortune in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm will change in a thousand years!"

...

Two figures quietly appeared in the plaza at the entrance of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, unnoticed by anyone.

"Junior Brother, is there anything else you need to take care of in Proud Cloud Immortal City? If so, I can wait a few days." Feng Wuyu asked with a smile, "Or shall we return to the Dao Gate now?"

Zhang Jing pondered for a moment. After the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, he had gone directly to the core to comprehend the Undying Proud Sun, staying for three years. He hadn't yet handed over the rented palace to the woman he initially dealt with. He had intended to check on it, but after thinking about it, three years had passed, and those people might not even be there anymore. There was no point in going. Besides, all his belongings were in his personal storage space.

"Forget it, let's not waste time. Let's leave directly." Zhang Jing's eyes flashed, and he turned to Feng Wuyu. "Senior Brother, I have nothing else to take care of. But, are there any Void Treasure Ships heading to the Clear Azure Profound Heaven right now?" he asked doubtfully.

"Haha, Junior Brother, these Void Treasure Ships that cross the heavens usually only depart every few months or even years. We don't have time to wait. I'll take you back directly. We can't delay the apprenticeship ceremony." Feng Wuyu said with a smile.

Zhang Jing's eyes flashed with realization. He had almost forgotten that Senior Brother Feng was a Harmony Dao Realm existence, and traversing the void with his physical body was not difficult. Unlike them, who needed to ride Void Treasure Ships to reach other heavens.

As for the apprenticeship ceremony he mentioned... When the teacher asked him to address him as Master in the main hall, Zhang Jing had vaguely guessed something. But he only guessed that he might soon become a formal disciple, not that there would be a ceremony!

Coming back to his senses, Zhang Jing said gratefully, "Junior Brother understands. Then I'll trouble Senior Brother."

"Haha, Junior Brother, that's your only flaw, you're too polite." Feng Wuyu shook his head. A bronze immortal light bloomed from beneath his feet, instantly enveloping Zhang Jing. The next moment, the two transformed into a cyan rainbow, soaring into the sky and disappearing into the vast void.

...

In a certain part of the void, boundless, deep darkness tightly surrounded a small Void Treasure Ship, no more than a hundred feet long. It looked extremely oppressive. The Void Treasure Ship was already in chaos, filled with screams, cries for help, and wails.

As time passed, the tens of thousands of people who had originally boarded the Void Treasure Ship were now reduced to only three to five hundred, forced onto the deck. They looked around, their hearts filled with despair.

In their field of vision, countless black, locust-like creatures gathered into a sea. Their sizes varied, from a foot to several feet, even tens of feet! Even the weakest of these black locust creatures emanated traces of Foundation Establishment Realm power. The dense flapping of wings, crawling, and gnawing sounds, like a tide, directly engulfed the entire Void Treasure Ship.

On the deck, someone sighed despairingly, "Is there really no way out for us?"

"Where can we find a way out? This sea of insects would overwhelm and devour even the high and mighty Harmony Dao Realm True Immortals. Not to mention that none of us even have a Dharma Idol Realm existence."

"Encountering these void creatures, we can only say that we are unlucky."

In the crowd, a young woman stared blankly at the black locust creatures filling her entire field of vision. Her once rosy and pretty face was now devoid of color. "Am I going to die?" she said tremblingly, her voice a little hoarse, but still faintly revealing its former crispness.

Beside her, a similarly young man gently embraced her, a miserable smile on his face. "Yun'er, it's okay, I'm here with you."

Just as the two were speaking, someone suddenly shouted excitedly, "Look, what's that?!"

Instantly, everyone turned their gaze towards a bronze immortal light that suddenly appeared in the deep, boundless void.

"It looks... like a teleportation technique? A strong human traversing the void with their physical body!" someone shouted excitedly.

In that instant, hundreds of gazes erupted with intense, bright light. It was the desire for life!

On the other side, seemingly noticing the abnormality of the Void Treasure Ship, the bronze divine light abruptly changed direction in the eyes of the crowd.

At the same time, the vast black sea of insects seemed to sense some kind of terrifying crisis and immediately abandoned the Void Treasure Ship, beginning to shrink and squirm.

In the end, it condensed into a huge black creature tens of thousands of feet long, its countless scarlet compound eyes greedily and violently looking at the bronze immortal light.

*Boom!*

A terrifying aura belonging to the Harmony Dao Realm quietly spread out.

Inside the bronze immortal light, "Senior Brother, what is that?" Zhang Jing couldn't help but ask curiously, looking at the huge and extremely terrifying strange creature.

However, there was no trace of worry on his face. Although this guy gave him the same feeling as Senior Brother Feng Wuyu beside him, he knew very well that it was only the same level of cultivation.

In terms of actual combat power, Senior Brother Feng, who cultivated the Dao Soldier path of the Primordial Beginning Origin Realm and had already condensed his Dao Domain, was definitely at the top of the Harmony Dao Realm.

He naturally trusted Senior Brother Feng's strength!

Of course... He was already on the other party's pirate ship, surrounded by the vast void, with no way to escape. He had no choice but to trust him.

"Junior Brother, this is a void creature. Born in the endless void, but filled with malice towards the various races of the Xuanhuang Realm, including our human race and the various races of the myriad spirits camp." Feng Wuyu's serious voice interrupted Zhang Jing's thoughts. "Void creatures can never be completely killed or exterminated. The strong among them are even comparable to Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs. Junior Brother, you must be careful in the future."

"Thank you for your warning, Senior Brother." Zhang Jing replied seriously. Then, his eyes flashed, and he asked tentatively, "Full of hostility towards the creatures of the Xuanhuang Realm... May I ask, Senior Brother, have these void creatures always existed in the Xuanhuang Realm, or—"

Hearing this, Feng Wuyu seemed to understand what Zhang Jing was asking, and then said meaningfully, "Junior Brother, I can tell you very clearly that void creatures appeared along with the many secret realms of the Xuanhuang Realm."

"Do you understand?!"

"Junior Brother understands, thank you for your explanation, Senior Brother." Zhang Jing understood in his heart, then took a deep breath and stopped asking.

As they spoke, the two had already arrived directly above the huge black creature.

"What a handsome beast! It's a pity that it can't be tamed, nor can it be infected by the power of bronze to be transformed into a Dao Soldier. Otherwise, it would be perfect for you to guard the island, Junior Brother, and it would be extremely majestic." Feng Wuyu said with a smile.

The next moment, the Bronze Dao Domain appeared from beneath his feet, then rapidly expanded, instantly transforming into a round of cyan sun.

*Screech—*

Below, the ten-thousand-foot black locust creature let out a shriek, then spread its huge wings, and streaks of black light rapidly spread.

An extremely distorted and majestic aura spread out.

The void suddenly began to boil.

However, the next moment, the cyan sun trembled slightly.

Ten thousand rays of bronze immortal light suddenly burst out from it, all falling on the ten-thousand-foot black creature.

The creature's movements froze instantly!

On its black and huge body, patches of bronze luster began to expand at an extremely terrifying speed.

In an instant, the ten-thousand-foot black void creature transformed into a huge bronze statue.

Then... From beginning to end, it gradually turned into dust and dissipated into the boundless void.

The entire battle process took less than three breaths, with no twists and turns.

Just as Zhang Jing had guessed before, it was even more exaggerated than he had imagined.

This Harmony Dao Realm void creature was as fragile as a piece of paper in front of Feng Wuyu, who was also in the Harmony Dao Realm.

It shattered with a single touch!

Zhang Jing unconsciously glanced at Feng Wuyu beside him. "The Dao Domain recorded in the Primordial Beginning Origin Realm! Is this the Dao Soldier path? As expected, it is one of the paths that Master once advocated."

"I wonder, when I enter the Harmony Dao Realm in the future, what kind of Dao Domain will I evolve..." A hint of anticipation flashed in his eyes.

...

At this moment, on the Void Treasure Ship below, there was silence.

After a long time, someone exclaimed, "What kind of method was that? It actually instantly turned that ten-thousand-foot void creature into a bronze statue?"

At this time, an old man seemed to have thought of something and slowly said, "Bronze divine light, turning enemies into bronze statues... Currently, among our human race, there is only one strong person famous for this kind of divine power—that is the legendary thirteenth true disciple of the Undying Dao lineage, the Immeasurable Grand Yi Dao Gate, Lord Feng Wuyu!"

As soon as he finished speaking, "Hiss—, it's actually him!"

"No wonder that void creature died so quickly, so miserably."

"..."

In the crowd, a man and a woman looked at each other, their eyes revealing a hint of surprise and doubt.

Just now, in that round of cyan sun, they vaguely saw two figures.

"One of them is Daoist Zhang Jing, there's definitely no mistake. I watched him for three whole months in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, there's no way I could mistake him." The young woman said excitedly.

"It should be Daoist Zhang Jing, so the one next to him is the legendary Lord Feng Wuyu?"

"It's just that these two seem to have a good relationship? A Foundation Establishment Realm and a Harmony Dao Realm, is that possible?"

The man and woman looked at each other again.

They both saw a touch of disbelief in each other's eyes.

...

Time slowly passed.

Inside the bronze divine light, the expression on Zhang Jing's face shook, and a hint of nervousness arose in his heart.

The familiar Crimson Bright Grand Clarity Grotto Heaven was right before his eyes!
