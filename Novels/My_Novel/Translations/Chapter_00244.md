Chapter 244: The Little Fairy in Public, Master Li Behind Closed Doors

Candlelight flickered, and incense curled in the air. Wen Caixiang, her demeanor alluring and her emotions deep, was fulfilling her promise to reward Li Xian. Suppressing her shyness, she served him wine.

However, as the cups went back and forth, their gazes intertwined, and passion flowed between them. Desire became difficult to restrain. Added to this were the life-and-death dangers they had faced along the way—being trapped multiple times, only to escape again. The bond forged in life and death was far from ordinary.

With no one to disturb them, their affection grew more unrestrained. Li Xian had a handsome face and an abundance of pure Yang energy, his body forged into one of pure Yang. Like a raging furnace, after drinking the Tiger Wine, his Yang energy flared, making him exceptionally hot.

"Wen Caixiang asked, "Li Lang, are you sweating?" Her beautiful eyes were dazed as her fingers gently traced circles on his chest.

A moment of clarity suddenly struck him. He thought, "I am fulfilling my promise to serve him. But how did it... turn into this? Am I about to serve myself to him as well?"

He hurriedly stood up, yet he couldn't help but feel a sense of longing. His emotions were complex—a mix of shyness, anger, annoyance, and joy. Li Xian said, "Madam, you should drink too." He filled a cup and gently brought it to her lips.

Wen Caixiang was slightly tipsy, her mind hazy. Affection swirled in her heart, a mix of sweetness and panic. This was beyond her control. She thought, "Forget it... forget it... What can I do to him?" She let down her guard and let nature take its course.

They drank from the same cup, their expressions intimate.

Just then, the inn's main door swung open. A group of people barged in, their noise and commotion ruining the couple's mood. Wen Caixiang frowned and said, "Ignore them."

Li Xian smiled. "For safety's sake, we should be cautious." He picked up Wen Caixiang and set her back in her seat. "I'll go take a look. If it's nothing, please continue feeding me wine."

Wen Caixiang pouted. "Hmph, if you miss this village, there won't be another inn like this. Don't even think about it." Li Xian replied, "Then I'll just return to that village and find that inn again. As the saying goes, a monk may run, but the temple cannot."

"You rascal," Wen Caixiang cursed, though she couldn't help feeling a little expectant. Li Xian gently opened the door and crept along the corridor. His eyes revealed their heavy pupils, capable of seeing through the wooden wall to the hall on the first floor.

There were five or six men, all dressed in yellow robes with arrogant expressions. They were urging the innkeeper to prepare dishes, talking about an important figure who would be arriving soon.

Li Xian thought, "I am being hunted, a target on the Red List. We are close to the Weihu River, and at this critical juncture, I should avoid trouble if possible." Confirming there was no danger, he was about to return to his room when he suddenly heard a tiger's roar.

The main gate was shattered by a single palm strike, and a massive tiger body squeezed into the inn. Its maw was wide and bloody, its fangs ferocious. The tiger's fur was like needles, its eyes like copper furnaces, incredibly robust and majestic.

On its back sat a person. It was Zhang Hu, one of the Four Talents of Taixin! The disciples of the Tiger Sect gathered around him with respectful expressions, urging the innkeeper to serve wine and food.

Zhang Hu nodded. "Hmm." His gaze swept upstairs, vaguely sensing a pair of eyes watching him.

Li Xian was startled. "Zhang Hu? Have they moved so fast to have already caught up? If so, the others should have surrounded the area. No... it doesn't seem like it... I'll observe a bit longer."

A disciple of the Tiger Sect said, "Thank you, Senior Brother Zhang, for your visit and exchange. Our sect has benefited greatly. Why not stay a few more days? In a few days, there will be the rare spectacle of the Tiger Leaping River."

Zhang Hu said, "I would like to stay longer, but I have urgent matters and cannot linger." The disciple replied, "What a pity. We have already ordered food and wine. Please take a seat, Senior Brother Zhang."

Zhang Hu said, "The Tiger Sect's hospitality is excellent. Your sect kindly lent me this 'River-Turning Tiger.' I, Zhang Hu, am grateful." He then sat down and began to eat and drink heartily.

It turns out...

After the battle at the city gates, Zhang Hu's beloved tiger was killed. Both his legs were broken, making movement difficult. Without his tiger, his strength was reduced by ninety percent.

Furious at Su Qiuwu's attitude, he broke away from the others in a huff and rushed alone to the Tiger Sect. Although Taixin Sect and Tiger Sect were far apart, they had long been acquainted. Disciples often visited each other for exchanges and sparring.

When Su Qiuwu arrived at the sect, he requested a tiger mount. The Tiger Sect welcomed him warmly and specially selected the "River-Turning Tiger" for him.

After training with the tiger for a few days, Su Qiuwu developed a bit of a bond with it. He couldn't stop thinking about Li Quan and Wen Caixiang and was eager to rush back to assist them and vent his anger.

The Tiger Sect sent people to see him off. The disciples took the opportunity to curry favor and arrived at the inn ahead of time to make arrangements, leading to this scene.

Li Xian deduced the general situation from their conversation and felt a bit more at ease. He returned to the room and informed Wen Caixiang of the situation. Upon hearing this, Wen Caixiang retracted her playful mood and her expression turned grave.

Li Xian said, "Madam, wait in the room. I will go observe again." He stealthily left the room and watched the people in the hall.

Zhang Hu was eating tiger meat and drinking tiger wine in large bites. The accompanying Tiger Sect disciples flattered him, their words extremely respectful.

After eating and drinking to his heart's content, a disciple said, "Innkeeper, prepare two superior rooms for Senior Brother Zhang to stay in. If you serve him well, there will be a generous tip."

Zhang Hu said, "No need to go to such expense!" The disciple said, "Senior Brother Zhang, this..."

Zhang Hu said, "What good rooms can such an inn have? Narrow and cramped, it's no fun to stay in."

"Ah!" the disciple exclaimed. "I have been thoughtless. I will find another inn immediately to ensure Senior Brother Zhang's comfort."

Zhang Hu shook his head. "The night is already deep, and I must travel tomorrow. I can't be bothered with the trouble. I'll just sleep here." He said to the innkeeper, "You, listen up. Don't say I didn't warn you. Heh heh, when I fall asleep, the tiger under me won't be calm. If it eats your guests, don't blame me."

The River-Turning Tiger breathed out scorching air. Its eyes flashed with ferocity, and saliva dripped from its mouth, as if it had been hungry for a long time. It let out a low growl from its throat, and its sharp claws scraped against the floor. The innkeeper's legs immediately trembled with fear.

The innkeeper thought it over for a moment, then hurried upstairs to inform all the guests, refunding their money and asking them to leave to avoid being devoured by the tiger. The guests were all terrified and hurried downstairs, passing by the tiger with fear and trepidation.

Zhang Hu laughed heartily, feeling immensely proud. When most of the guests had left, Li Xian frowned in thought, intending to slip out through the back door.

Suddenly, Zhang Hu's voice rang out, loud and clear: "If I am not mistaken, there is a rather capable friend on the second floor, secretly watching me, isn't there?"

"What, are you too ashamed to show yourself to me, Zhang Hu?"

The River-Turning Tiger roared, its sound shaking the surroundings, a wave of ferocity rolling out. Li Xian thought, "A third-grade martial artist has sharp instincts. He can vaguely sense when he's being watched. But this Zhang Hu is extremely crude. He might just be trying to scare me."

Hearing no movement, Zhang Hu thought, "Was it just my imagination?" He paid it no more mind and continued drinking heartily. He picked up a tiger bone and fed it to the ferocious River-Turning Tiger.

The Tiger Sect disciples exchanged glances, all thinking they needed to show their eagerness to serve. They shouted in unison, "Senior on the second floor, Senior Brother Zhang of Taixin Sect requests your presence. Why not come down and meet him?"

They then asked the innkeeper, "Innkeeper, are there still people upstairs?" The innkeeper dared not hide anything and told them about Li Xian and Wen Caixiang's room.

Three to five people went upstairs together, intending to personally invite them down. Li Xian and Wen Caixiang exchanged a glance. At the final moment, a complication had arisen. Li Xian whispered in Wen Caixiang's ear, telling her his plan. Wen Caixiang nodded, finding it feasible.

Wen Caixiang sat steadily in the room, with Li Xian standing beside her. Both appeared calm and composed. Soon, the door was pounded on. The Tiger Sect disciples had arrived.

"Senior inside, please come down for a drink!" the Tiger Sect disciples called out loudly.

Hearing no response, they exchanged a glance. As they knocked, they secretly channeled their internal energy and shattered the door with a "bang." Li Xian said coldly, "Seeking death!" He picked up a teacup, filled it with tea, and threw the cup and the tea at the group.

The cup flew through the air, the tea swirling rapidly within it. Wen Caixiang nodded slightly and said, "Little Xian, you've truly learned the essence of that pot-bearing怪人."

The cup flew before the group of people. With a "pop," it exploded, and the Tiger Sect disciples were sent flying, a sorry sight.

"That Senior Brother Zhang doesn't have the qualification to invite us down. It just so happens that we want to invite him for a drink."

Li Xian's voice rang out, clear and loud: "Go down quickly and say... a Madam has been waiting for a long time and requests his presence upstairs!"

The Tiger Sect disciples exchanged glances and hurried down to deliver the message.

"What Madam is so arrogant? Hmph! Other than the Sword-Breaking Madam, who am I afraid of?" Zhang Hu puffed out his chest and said with a cold laugh, "So fierce and overbearing, I'll go meet her!" He rode his tiger upstairs.

When he reached the door, he saw Wen Caixiang sitting calmly with a faint smile. It was indeed the Sword-Breaking Madam. His face filled with terror, and he was about to leap away to escape. Wen Caixiang said, "It's rare to meet. Where are you going? Why not have a drink before you leave?"

A chill ran down Zhang Hu's back. He remembered their last encounter, when Wen Caixiang had no internal energy and was severely injured. If she was just putting on a show, wouldn't he be missing a great opportunity to capture her? He also thought that at this distance, if the Madam wanted to kill him, he would have no chance of escaping.

Facing death either way, he entered the room and said warily, "Wen Caixiang, why are you here?"

Wen Caixiang smiled. "What do you think?" She picked up a wine cup, gently filled it, and pushed it toward him with a smile. "Please, have a drink."

Zhang Hu's hair stood on end. The more gentle Wen Caixiang appeared, the more terrified he became. He dared not refuse, his mind going blank. He numbly picked up the cup and drank it with a trembling hand.

Wen Caixiang said, "Is it good?" Zhang Hu said, "G-good..."

Wen Caixiang said, "Please have another." Zhang Hu let out a wail, his eyes turning red. He knew there was no escape for him today and drank several more cups on his own.

Wen Caixiang said, "I originally planned to go to the Tiger Sect tomorrow to find you personally. I didn't expect to run into you now. Please, have another drink."

Zhang Hu trembled. "L-looking for me? What about Li Quan? What about Su Qiuwu?"

Wen Caixiang smiled. "Naturally, they are dead. Otherwise, why would I travel thousands of miles to find you here?"

"Ah!" Zhang Hu felt an immense sorrow. He hugged his head and wept. The mighty讨剑联盟 (Sword-Hunting Alliance) had come to a tragic end.

Wen Caixiang said, "I have grown tired of killing. I asked you to sit and drink because I want you to finish all the food and wine, and then commit suicide right here."

"Thank you, Madam, for your grace in allowing me to commit suicide!" Zhang Hu's heart was filled with bitterness. He ate and drank on his own, occasionally letting out a cry of grief.

When the table was cleared, Zhang Hu raised his palm and channeled his energy, ready to end his own life. The Tiger Sect disciples rushed forward and said in panic, "Senior Brother Zhang, is this necessary! Whatever the grievance, let's return to the Tiger Sect to mediate!"

Zhang Hu laughed coldly. "Return to the Tiger Sect to mediate? If I really went to the Tiger Sect, even your sect master would have a hard time dealing with the consequences. Get lost quickly! If I delay my suicide, it will be even more miserable!"

He kicked them all away. He slapped his own chest with a heavy palm, and with a "bang," he ended his life on the spot.

Wen Caixiang remained serene and dignified. "If any of you wish to drink, please take a seat." The Tiger Sect disciples didn't know Wen Caixiang's name, but seeing her dignified and beautiful appearance and how she had forced a powerful expert to his death with just a few words, they were all terrified.

"If you don't want to drink, crawl back to your sect," Li Xian shouted.

"Yes... yes!" The Tiger Sect disciples all knelt and scrambled out, their knees on the ground, but they fled for their lives with surprising speed.

Li Xian saw the ferocious tiger, its fangs fully bared. He swung his sword in a single slash, killing the River-Turning Tiger on the spot.

"This place is foul and stinking. Little Xian, let's find another place to stay," Wen Caixiang said calmly.

Li Xian replied, "As you wish, Madam."
