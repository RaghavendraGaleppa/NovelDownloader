Chapter 230: Yin-Yang Liangyi Microdust Array

One hundred and fifty years!

After a careful assessment, a blazing divine light suddenly erupted from Zhang Jing's eyes, and an uncontainable excitement flashed across his face.

This Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monument had actually doubled the rate of his Fated Realms' evolution. At this pace, the first layer of his Fated Realm would reach complete evolution in a mere one hundred and fifty years.

By then, the power of the Great One Heavenly Constellation Divine Fate Realm would undergo a qualitative change. At the same time, he might no longer have to worry about the terrifying situation he faced today, where a full-force attack almost completely drained him.

Moreover, the Innate Divine Body of Dao would also be born! He had been looking forward to this for a long time.

Of course, Zhang Jing wasn't overly concerned with the Innate Divine Body of Dao's strength. Though he could easily imagine that anything related to innate divinity would certainly not be simple. Yet, compared to its strength, what Zhang Jing anticipated most was the Innate Divine Body of Dao's terrifying comprehension ability towards certain Great Daos. After all, it was a being born from a Great Dao; calling it a Child of the Great Dao would not be an exaggeration.

Coupled with his skill upgrades at that time... upgrading various divine abilities into Immortal Seeds likely wouldn't be as difficult or as resource-intensive as it was now.

"That might be an unprecedented and terrifying transformation, akin to forming an Immortal Foundation and condensing a Primordial Golden Core!" Zhang Jing murmured to himself, his eyes incredibly deep.

His thoughts returned to reality. He couldn't help but look at the other thirty-five immortal peaks of Lingxu Mountain. From his previous perception, there were another thirty-five Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monuments on them, each corresponding perfectly with the remaining thirty-five layers of his Fated Realms.

And Zhang Jing could clearly feel that the thirty-six Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monuments formed a complete whole; not one could be missing.

But then—

As if he had thought of something, Zhang Jing's brows furrowed slightly. He raised his head. In his line of sight, as he collected this Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monument into his first Fated Realm, the dense spiritual mist shrouding the entire Lingxu Mountain Daoist temple had already thinned considerably.

"The thirty-six Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monuments are the foundation of this Innate Heavenly Constellation Bewildering Divine Array that covers the Daoist temple. If all of them are taken away, then undoubtedly, the grand array will collapse." Zhang Jing mused.

What kind of true disciple's Daoist temple would it be without a guardian array? More importantly, it wouldn't be safe!

After all, in his plans, one of the thirty-six immortal peaks would be directly handed over to Deer Thirty-Eight, to be used entirely for cultivating immortal roots and spiritual plants. This would also facilitate the natural manifestation of the Womb Treasury Realm through their bloodline divine ability. Once those hundreds of immortal roots fully grew, their value would be immeasurable! He certainly couldn't just leave them exposed.

However, giving up the other thirty-five Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monuments was even more impossible. The nurturing and evolution of the thirty-six Fated Realms was the top priority, even concerning his path to the Dharma Idol Realm and beyond to the Dao Integration Realm.

"So..."

Zhang Jing seemed to have an idea. With a thought, an ancient, unassuming array disc quietly appeared in his hand, upon which two small black and white flags floated. There was no aura leaking from it, making it seem utterly ordinary. However, the subtle black and white immortal light occasionally flashing upon it sent shivers down Zhang Jing's spine, a terrifying sensation as if even a touch of that immortal light would lead to instant death. This was despite the fact that he had already refined it.

"The Yin-Yang Liangyi Microdust Array that Martial Uncle Yuande gifted me... using it as a guardian array for the Daoist temple is truly a bit wasteful."

"I originally wanted to keep it as a personal trump card." Zhang Jing shook his head regretfully.

But then he reconsidered. Even if he kept this Yin-Yang Liangyi Microdust Array with him, given his current cultivation, he wouldn't be able to activate it unless his Fated Realm had fully manifested and grown to the size of a normal small world. It was better to set it up within the Daoist temple.

After a moment of thought, he no longer hesitated. His terrifying magic power, which had just recovered, surged forth, instantly activating the Yin-Yang Liangyi Microdust Grand Array in his hand. Then, he gently tossed it into the air.

In an instant, the array disc burst forth with monstrous black and white immortal light, condensing into a gigantic Yin-Yang Double Fish array diagram. With Zhang Jing at the center, it immediately covered the entire hundred-thousand-li expanse of Lingxu Mountain. An extreme, oppressive killing intent permeated the air. Even the four Mighty Heaven-Crafting Ghost-Gods, who were diligently working tens of thousands of li away, froze in place, not daring to move an inch.

Before long, the array diagram slowly descended. It then burrowed into the earth脉, subtly merging with the vast Lingxu Mountain. Above, the two small flags, one black and one white, transformed into two streaks of light, landing respectively in the eyes of the Yin-Yang Double Fish, becoming two array cores. The small flags gradually faded, and the Daoist temple once again became calm, as if nothing had happened.

However, only Zhang Jing could clearly sense that a terrifying grand array, permeated with boundless Yin-Yang Annihilation Immortal Light, had already enveloped the Daoist temple. With just a thought, he could activate it. The earth脈 power beneath Lingxu Mountain continuously supplied the Yin-Yang Liangyi Microdust Array's consumption, keeping it running ceaselessly.

"Below Heavenly Immortal, if anyone dares to trespass without permission..." A faint smile flickered in the corner of Zhang Jing's eye.

Immediately, he transformed into a bright streak of light, moving among the various immortal peaks, collecting the Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monuments one by one into the thirty-six Fated Realms behind him.

Time slowly passed.

As the last Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monument vanished from the Daoist temple, a resonant hum echoed. Mysterious connections appeared within the phantoms of the thirty-six Fated Realms, giving them a strange sense of wanting to merge into one complete entity.

And furthermore—

"Indeed, with all thirty-six Nine Stars Heavenly Constellation Dao Monuments gathered, the evolution speed of the first Fated Realm has accelerated even further."

"One hundred and twenty years, then?" Zhang Jing's eyes shone brightly.

...

Time slowly passed.

"Clan Leader Hansheng, how is it? Look around this hundred-thousand-li Lingxu Mountain Daoist temple. Where would you like your Cold幽 Tribe to reside? The Daoist temple is quite empty now, and it truly needs you to manage it." Zhang Jing said with a half-joking tone.

"My Lord, please just call this old one Hansheng." Behind him, Hansheng, the Dao Integration Realm Ice Crystal Immortal Spirit, instinctively looked at the vast, boundless Lingxu Mountain Daoist temple, brimming with immense spiritual energy, and a look of shock suddenly flashed in his eyes. Such a terrifying Daoist temple... belonged to his Lord? His Lord's formidable background was easily imaginable.

Of course, he understood even more clearly that while a powerful background was one aspect, his Lord's own talent and strength in acquiring this Daoist temple were equally, if not more, important. The rules of the immortal world had always been thus.

"Perhaps, in the unseen depths, following my Lord is an unimaginable great opportunity for the Cold幽 Tribe!" he thought, as if sensing something.

After some selection, Hansheng finally chose a small spiritual peak, only several hundred zhang tall, within the Daoist temple as the living quarters for the Cold幽 Tribe, rather than one of the thirty-six heaven-reaching immortal peaks.

"Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?" Zhang Jing withdrew his gaze from the small spiritual peak below and asked with a smile, his voice as gentle as ever.

"Reporting to my Lord, this place has mountains and lakes, and it happens to be situated on an immortal spiritual earth脉. Such a spiritual land has already far exceeded Hansheng's imagination." Hansheng explained with a smile.

"Very well," Zhang Jing nodded. "Then your Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits shall live here." As he spoke, he extended one hand and gently pointed in mid-air. In an instant, the extremely dense immortal energy in the surroundings began to gather towards the spiritual peak they had chosen.

Zhang Jing then took out the pure white edict. With a thought, a profound vortex slowly appeared before him, then began to expand rapidly. One by one, Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, carrying small bundles and bringing their families, joyfully flew out, curiously surveying their surroundings. A constant chirping and chattering filled the air.

Before long, "We greet our Lord!" Nearly a thousand Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, large and small, a vast throng, bowed in unison before Zhang Jing under the leadership of their clan leader Hansheng, respectfully calling out.

"Rise, no need for such ceremony." Zhang Jing said warmly, a faint smile gracing his lips. With these Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, he would have much less to worry about within the Daoist temple in the future. And Deer Thirty-Eight would finally have help.

The next moment, as if sensing something, Zhang Jing turned his head slightly, his gaze falling directly towards the foot of Lingxu Mountain.

"They haven't left yet? Could it be... the matter of expounding the Dao?" He instantly realized. According to what Zhang Jing knew, true disciples of the Daoist sect or other powerful beings, after establishing a Daoist temple, would customarily expound the Dao once for all beings. This served as a formal announcement of the Daoist temple's existence and also to settle the karma of occupying the land.

Since that was the case, he would follow custom. Zhang Jing smiled slightly, without the slightest worry in his heart. Although his current cultivation was only at the Golden Core realm, the various Dao principles and laws he had mastered, whether it was the Way of Red Lotus Karma Fire, the Way of Innate Primordial Great One, or the Way of Primordial World Evolution, all far surpassed the imagination of ordinary cultivators. Expounding the Dao would naturally be effortless for him.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing immediately called for Hansheng, who was still directing the numerous Ice Crystal Immortal Spirit tribesmen in building their dwellings. He subconsciously glanced at the Mighty Heaven-Crafting Ghost-Gods who were carrying a hundred-zhang tall mountain gate towards the foot of the mountain, and said calmly:

"Hansheng, you shall go down the mountain on my behalf."

"Tell those people that, as per custom, I shall open the gates of Lingxu Mountain three months from now to expound the Dao for all beings. All who are fated may come and listen."

"Understood, my Lord." Hansheng respectfully responded. As his voice fell, an azure immortal light flashed, and his figure vanished instantly.
