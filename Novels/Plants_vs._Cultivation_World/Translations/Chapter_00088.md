# Chapter 88: Spirit-Dispersing Array  

Although Gu Mo was now an outer sect disciple with the additional title of Spiritual Planter, obtaining a second-grade spirit field as a Qi Refinement cultivator remained extremely difficult.  

If one were to compare a second-grade spirit field to a treasure, it would be among the finest of its tier. After all, a well-maintained second-grade spirit field could continuously produce second-grade spiritual materials. Such a field could serve as the foundation for an entire Foundation Establishment clan outside the sect.  

Even within Qinglu Sect, second-grade spirit fields were scarce, and most were controlled by Foundation Establishment deacons. For example, Zhao Qiancheng owned several acres of second-grade fields—his livelihood and the source of his cultivation resources.  

While difficult to obtain, there were still ways to acquire a second-grade spirit field. Gu Mo knew of two methods. The first was to become a disciple of a Golden Core elder, such as Elder Qi, a third-grade Spiritual Planter. Given that Elder Qi’s spiritual peak was filled with fields of at least second-grade, securing one wouldn’t be an issue.  

Unfortunately, becoming Elder Qi’s disciple required Gu Mo to first reach Foundation Establishment. Yet without a second-grade spirit field, he couldn’t advance to that stage—a vicious cycle with no solution.  

Thus, Gu Mo was left with the second option: exchanging sect contribution points for a second-grade field. The sect deliberately made rare treasures available through contribution points to emphasize their value. However, the cost for a second-grade field was exorbitant. At Gu Mo’s current rate of accumulating points, it would take several years to gather enough.  

For most, needing only a few years to earn enough contribution points for a second-grade field would be astonishing. But Gu Mo didn’t have years to spare—he would reach the peak of Qi Refinement soon, and without a second-grade field, his progress would stall.  

To speed things up, Gu Mo needed to focus on high-reward sect missions, particularly special tasks. These were rare and often difficult, but completing just one could rapidly boost his contribution points.  

For now, he decided to continue his current work as a Spiritual Planter while keeping an eye out for suitable special missions.

Having settled on his plan, Gu Mo stood and rearranged the three meditation cushions in his room. His bed had been replaced with these cushions, and his already small hut was now divided into three sections—two clearly marked with feminine touches, belonging to Yuan Niya and Chu Feifei.  

The two women frequently visited to cultivate with him, so they had moved some of their daily necessities into his space.  

*Buzz!*  

A message talisman vibrated. Gu Mo glanced at it and opened the field’s barrier, allowing Yuan Niya and Chu Feifei to enter.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, just give us the barrier control jade slip. It’s such a hassle to notify you every time," Yuan Niya complained as she stepped inside.  

"Not a chance. What if I’m bathing and you two barge in?" Gu Mo shot her a look. Handing over control was out of the question—his spirit field held too many secrets.  

"That’s unfair! You’ve already seen everything about us, yet you hide yourself away," Yuan Niya huffed, recalling how thoroughly Gu Mo had examined her body.  

Still, she didn’t press the issue. Both she and Chu Feifei knew Gu Mo had secrets, and they respected his boundaries—an unspoken rule among cultivators.  

"Then how about we cultivate *completely* openly next time?" Gu Mo teased.  

"Tch, as if I care!" Yuan Niya immediately backed down.  

As the two bickered, Chu Feifei shook her head and began setting up an array. Now a certified Array Master, she had received her training with Yuan Niya’s help—far superior to what the Array Peak offered outer disciples.  

The array she was constructing would enhance the spiritual energy concentration in the hut, compensating for its inferior density compared to Yuan Niya’s cave abode.  

To cultivate the Heartfire Art without side effects, Yuan Niya needed Gu Mo to activate Chu Feifei’s special constitution. But the weak ambient energy slowed her progress, so Yuan Niya had tasked Chu Feifei with devising a solution.  

---  

The most common solution was a Spirit-Gathering Array, but its effects were slow. A more aggressive alternative was the Plundering Array, which forcibly drained energy from the surroundings—but it was too advanced for Chu Feifei and would devastate the nearby spirit fields, a crime even an inner disciple like Yuan Niya couldn’t afford.  

Instead, Chu Feifei found a compromise in the Spirit-Dispersing Array. As the name suggested, it extracted spiritual energy from items—such as spirit stones—and dispersed it into the environment.  

Using spirit stones this way was extravagantly wasteful. Most cultivators absorbed energy directly from stones at a slow, steady pace. But Yuan Niya’s needs demanded faster replenishment.  

High-grade spirit stones would have been ideal, but those were rare and mostly held by high-ranking cultivators. While Yuan Niya could obtain a few from her master, they wouldn’t last long.  

Instead, she opted to burn through low-grade spirit stones—a small price to pay for accelerated cultivation. As her strength grew, both her master and the sect would reward her with even more resources.
