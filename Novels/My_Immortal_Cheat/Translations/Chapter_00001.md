# Chapter 1: Zhou Tian  

"Young Master, the lord requests your presence in the main hall. We have guests!"  

In a luxurious room adorned with jade pillars carved with dragons and phoenixes, and grand vermilion furniture, an elderly man slightly hunched over spoke softly to the figure lying on the bed.  

The bed was carved from a single piece of translucent jade, embellished with golden threads along its cloud-patterned edges. A faint, misty aura swirled within, hinting at some unknown mystical property.  

On the golden silk covers lay a young man with delicate features, his face still bearing traces of youth. Though not yet fully matured, his handsome potential was evident—were it not for his disheveled hair and vacant stare, which marred his appearance.  

The young man seemed not to hear the elder's words, his empty gaze fixed on the ceiling's intricate patterns, his body unmoving.  

"Young Master!"  

The elder raised his voice slightly, sighing inwardly. His young master had suddenly become like this—like a salted fish that had lost all ambition. The lord had been deeply troubled, summoning numerous renowned physicians, yet none could remedy the condition.  

"Oh."  

Finally, the young man stirred. His eyes regained some focus as he attempted to sit up—though his method was flawed, and he failed.  

The elder's eye twitched. *Young Master, you're still a mortal. You can't just use your head to lift your body—do you plan to rely on sheer momentum?*  

As the young man stubbornly struggled, the elder hurriedly intervened before he could snap his own neck.  

"Attendants! Assist the Young Master in dressing!"  

At this command, the young man paused, his head drooping back onto the bed.  

Two young women entered, their heads slightly bowed as they helped him up and dressed him.  

"Dressing" here meant stripping off his current garments and replacing them with fresh ones—a process that involved more than a few incidental touches. The maids, after all, were lowly servants; catching the young master's eye could change their fortunes.  

But when one of them "accidentally" brushed against him yet again, the young man finally snapped.  

"Could you stop touching me? If you want one so badly, go install it yourself!"  

The two maids and the elder froze. The maids' expressions twisted into something indescribable.  

An awkward, almost surreal silence followed. Amid this bizarre atmosphere, the young man was finally dressed—now clad in a regal purple robe embroidered with golden thread forming a dragon-like emblem at the chest. His hair was tied back, and with his height nearing six feet, he cut a dashing figure—if only his eyes weren't so lifeless.  

"Young Master, let us go. The lord and our guests are waiting."  

The elder gestured politely. The young man shuffled out, and once he had left, the elder's expression turned cold. He shook his head slightly.  

The two maids paled, but before they could speak, a shadowy arm emerged from the darkness behind them, wielding an obsidian dagger. With a swift motion, it slit their throats.  

The blade seemed enchanted—though it left only a thin cut, darkness flooded their eyes, extinguishing their lives instantly. The shadowy arm caught their bodies before vanishing back into the dark.  

The elder surveyed the now-empty room, then suddenly reappeared near where one maid had fallen. Bending down, he held out a white handkerchief just as a single drop of scarlet blood fell onto it, spreading like a winter plum blossom.  

Satisfied, he nodded. *At least the room wasn't stained.* Then, his voice icy, he warned,  

"Be more careful next time, or you'll be the ones disappearing."  

A hoarse voice responded from the void, "Understood."  

Folding the handkerchief, the elder tucked it away and resumed his kindly expression before stepping out.  

His duty was to handle his master's troubles discreetly. Had those maids spread word of what happened during the dressing, rumors harmful to the young master might have arisen. The young master might not care, but he did.  

Outside, the young man had only walked a few dozen meters. Hearing footsteps, he turned to see the elder alone emerging from his room. His hollow gaze flickered briefly, but he said nothing.  

He wasn't of this world. He was a transmigrator—his past name irrelevant now. Here, he was Zhou Tian, the third son of the Zhou family in the Tianqin Empire.  

Though he had once fantasized about transmigration while reading web novels, when it truly happened, he was left disoriented and lost. Even now, he hadn't fully adjusted. *Perhaps this is the so-called 'Ye Gong's love of dragons.'*  

The Zhou family ruled the Tianqin Empire. The current emperor was his uncle, making his lineage illustrious. That alone wouldn't be so bad—living as a pampered noble had its perks. But from the fragmented memories of this body's original owner, he knew this world possessed supernatural powers.  

Earth-shattering experts, star-plucking divine abilities, and terrifyingly bizarre secret arts were all part of this world—a world fraught with danger.  

And the cruelest joke? He was a cultivation cripple. Born with all but one meridian blocked, he was practically an "energy insulator"—rarer than even the legendary Saint Dragon or Celestial Emperor physiques. After a year of futile training without sensing even a wisp of spiritual energy, the original owner had given up, drowning himself in debauchery.  

Zhou Tian sighed. *I have all the external traits of a protagonist... but where's my golden finger?*  

*How am I supposed to survive without a cheat ability?*  

Walking slowly, Zhou Tian navigated the Zhou estate with ease—after three days here, he at least knew the layout well enough to avoid getting lost.  

---  

In an unknown dimension, a massive formation spanned thousands of miles. Each glyph in its design was as thick as a finger, and faint, wailing spirits writhed within, attesting to its sinister origins. Dark runes floated amidst the formation, corroding space itself into jagged fissures.  

At its center stood a towering bone altar, a thousand zhang tall. It wasn't merely built from human bones—the largest was a hundred-zhang skull embedded at its core, glowing faintly purple with crackling thunder runes. Whatever creature it belonged to, its生前 aura was unmistakably formidable.
