# Chapter 56: Someone, Bring Fresh Tea!

"Senior Brother Qiu, there's someone outside the hall requesting to see you, claiming to be an old acquaintance."

In the Personnel Hall, Qiu Mingshan was leisurely sipping tea and reading when suddenly a disciple approached and announced this.

"An old acquaintance? Did they give a name?" Qiu Mingshan frowned.

"They said their name is Gu Yuan," the disciple replied.

"Hmph, him?" Qiu Mingshan slammed his teacdown with displeasure. "That opportunist! He took advantage of me, pretending to have connections, and made me offend the Lan family. If Lan Tianming hadn't just welcomed a new son, causing Lan Tianlu's status to decline, I'd still be suffering the consequences!"

"Does he really think just because of sect rules, I can't do anything to him? A mere fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator dares to request an audience with me, the Personnel Hall steward? Send him away!"

Qiu Mingshan had been fooled by Gu Yuan's act before. The young man clearly knew he had no real connection to the revered elder yet pretended otherwise, extorting benefits from him while forcing the Lan family to yield a cave abode and spiritual water. The audacity!

Every time he recalled this, anger bubbled up. Though Gu Yuan's handsome features, refined demeanor, and sharp tongue had fooled him initially—after all, the elder had personally brought him into the sect—Qiu Mingshan had decided to let it go without retaliation. But now Gu Yuan dared show up again?

As a ninth-level Qi Refining expert and Personnel Hall steward, he had no time to entertain junior disciples. Yet the disciple hesitated: "Senior Brother, he brought a jade box as an apology gift."

Presenting the box, Qiu Mingshan opened it to find twenty spirit stones and a Fire-Water Flame Fruit. He chuckled dismissively. "At least the boy knows his manners. Consider this matter settled, but this isn't enough for an audience. If he has some minor request, handle it for him."

The disciple scratched his head. "Senior Brother, Gu Yuan seemed extraordinary—his aura suggests he's already at the sixth level of Qi Refining."

"What? Sixth level?" Qiu Mingshan straightened. Reaching fifth level wouldn't surprise him, given the spiritual water in that cave. But two months to advance two levels? "What did this kid eat? Even aristocratic disciples consuming pills daily couldn't progress this fast!"

"Could he have seized the Shell King at the Shell Fields? But how could a nobody like him manage that?" A thought struck him. "Bring him in! And serve the spiritual tea!"

The disciple, smiling at the spirit stone in his sleeve, ushered in a tall young man whose ordinary robes couldn't hide his striking presence. His confident bearing made even the plain garment seem dignified.

Qiu Mingshan narrowed his eyes—this was the same imposing aura that had deceived him before. Today, he wouldn't be fooled again. He'd uncover the truth.

"Senior Brother Qiu, your brilliance remains undiminished," Gu Yuan greeted courteously, unfazed by Qiu Mingshan's wariness.

"And Junior Brother Gu grows ever more remarkable," Qiu Mingshan replied, inviting him to sit. Cutting to the chase, he asked, "Your rapid progress—did you visit the Cloud Cliff Shell Fields?"

"Indeed. The Emerald Fire Ape occupied our sect's Shell Fields for millennia, stubbornly refusing to yield. When the sect mobilized, I joined the campaign," Gu Yuan declared righteously.

Qiu Mingshan pressed, "You obtained the Shell King?"

"By sheer luck," Gu Yuan waved modestly.

"With your weak cultivation and techniques from the Woodgreen Sect, how could you seize it? Did you scheme against fellow disciples?" Qiu Mingshan's ninth-level aura flared aggressively.

Gu Yuan merely smiled. "A misunderstanding, Senior Brother. My humble origins limited me, but the revered elder took pity. He granted me a token to study advanced techniques in the Transmission Hall and bestowed protective artifacts. Thus, I narrowly succeeded."

Casually, he toyed with a golden ring at his waist.

"Eight Winds Treasure Ring!" Qiu Mingshan gasped, immediately retracting his aura. Ordinary disciples wouldn't recognize it, but as a steward, he knew—this treasure, forged from eight rare winds and spirit-binding gold, could suppress nearly all magical weapons. When all eight rings combined, few artifacts could withstand them. 

Rarely crafted because collecting the winds required Golden Core cultivation, this was a treasure even aristocratic clans had failed to obtain. Yet here it was on Gu Yuan's waist—undeniable proof of the elder's favor.

"Someone, bring fresh tea! My finest Mistcloud Spirit Tea for Junior Brother Gu!" Qiu Mingshan's demeanor transformed instantly. "From now on, Junior Brother needn't announce yourself—enter freely! Whatever you require, just ask. I'll ensure it's done!"

If he'd doubted before, the ring erased all skepticism. Even if Gu Yuan claimed to be the elder's son now, he'd believe it. 

Smiling, Gu Yuan stated his purpose: "Senior Brother, my cultivation has slowed—the cave's spiritual energy feels insufficient. Might I relocate to Golden Yuan Island?"
