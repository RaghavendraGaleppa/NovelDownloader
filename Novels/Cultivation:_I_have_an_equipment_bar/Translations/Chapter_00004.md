# Chapter 4: The Difference Between Equipment

The Qingheng Sect, while largely ignoring outer disciples and even constantly harvesting them, still provides some rewards when they first step into the Qi Condensation stage. This is considered an investment in their disciples. Though the items aren't many, they are quite important for a disciple like Zhang Yan, who has no power, influence, or backing.

After tidying his appearance, Zhang Yan walked out of his room, just as Old Lin emerged from his.

"Ready to go?" Old Lin greeted him with practiced ease, preparing to take Zhang Yan to work.

But suddenly, he froze, staring intently at Zhang Yan.

"You... you've reached Qi Condensation!" Old Lin's voice was not entirely calm.

"Just by chance!" Zhang Yan bowed, not denying it. He couldn't hide his cultivation, nor did he plan to.

"By chance?!"

"Damn it, how come I never got 'by chance'!" Old Lin scoffed at Zhang Yan's words.

"Greetings, Senior Brother. I just entered the Qi Condensation stage today and wish to claim the sect's welfare." Zhang Yan hastily bowed and said to the middle-aged Daoist.

"Oh, so it's a newly initiated Junior Brother! I recall new disciples only joined two months ago. For Junior Brother to have already entered Qi Condensation is truly commendable!" The middle-aged Daoist congratulated him, then continued, "May I ask Junior Brother's lineage?"

"I have no lineage; I am merely an outer disciple. I'm currently a spiritual farmer in the Spiritual Plant Garden," Zhang Yan revealed his situation without concealment.

"No lineage, yet you entered Qi Condensation in just two months! Junior Brother truly is a genius!" After speaking, the middle-aged Daoist quickly verified Zhang Yan's identity, then took out a jade talisman and a storage bag, handing them over.

"The benefits for outer disciples entering Qi Condensation are: one storage bag, two Daoist robes, one jade talisman, and 100 contribution points. You may also go to Enlightenment Peak to learn two spells for free."

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Zhang Yan quickly expressed his gratitude for the rewards.

The Daoist robes were already placed in the storage bag. The jade talisman, a symbol of the Qingheng Sect identity, was also considered a magic artifact. It could store contribution points and, in times of crisis, could activate a protective shield capable of withstanding a single attack from a late Qi Condensation cultivator. Simultaneously, it would release a marking spell to mark the enemy. If sold, this single jade talisman alone could fetch dozens of spirit stones.

Of course, this was a personal identity token, and virtually no one would sell it. Moreover, the Qingheng Sect strictly prohibited such behavior; if discovered, cultivation would be immediately abolished, and the disciple expelled from the sect. In severe cases, the culprit might face a fate worse than death.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Having received his benefits, Zhang Yan thanked the middle-aged Daoist before turning to leave.

Especially that nameplate jade talisman. It turned out to be a green-grade equipment. However, what puzzled him was that while the attributes on this equipment were powerful, they were different from those on the Cultivation Jade Slip and the Spiritual Hoe. The Cultivation Jade Slip had the "Minor Accomplishment in Evergreen Art" attribute. The Spiritual Hoe, moreover, contained two professional attributes: "Spiritual Plant Identification" and "Spiritual Plant Cultivation." Yet, this green-grade equipment only had the original attributes of the magic artifact itself. This struck him as odd.

"Could these two magic artifacts be different in some way?" Zhang Yan frowned, pondering deeply.

Finally, he suddenly realized. These two magic artifacts did seem to be different from the previous two. The previous two magic artifacts were both second-hand. But these current two were different. These two magic artifacts were merely standard-issue sect artifacts; they were brand new. No one had ever used them before.

"So that's how it is!"
