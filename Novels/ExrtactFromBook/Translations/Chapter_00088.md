# Chapter 87: The Iron-Eating Beast  

That day, as usual, Han Yue lay hidden within a crevice of rocks, patiently waiting for his injuries to heal while casually perusing an ancient text.  

Just as he became engrossed in the contents of the scripture, a series of thunderous roars echoed from the distance!  

Han Yue immediately suppressed his aura and quietly observed his surroundings.  

His current position was the highest point in the vicinity, granting him an unobstructed view.  

After several days of recovery, though his body still appeared a bloody mess, his combat strength had largely returned.  

Thus, he remained calm—if worst came to worst, he could simply transform into a streak of light and escape.  

The strange disturbance in this lifeless wasteland piqued his curiosity.  

The noise grew louder, rhythmic and distinct.  

To Han Yue, it sounded like the footsteps of a four-legged creature running at full speed.  

Sure enough!  

A short while later, a massive beast, over ten meters tall, came charging toward the mountain where Han Yue was concealed.  

Han Yue focused his gaze and saw that it was a black-and-white panda, its fur glossy and its body round and plump!  

The panda moved with light, rhythmic steps, clearly in high spirits.  

As it ran, it sniffed the air with its nose, seemingly tracking a particular scent!  

Despite its terrifying maw filled with sharp fangs, its current expression was one of pure, dopey excitement. Combined with the dark circles around its eyes, it didn’t appear the least bit menacing!  

This panda was no ordinary creature—its body radiated formidable mana, marking it as a second-tier demon beast!  

Han Yue had naturally already detected this second-tier panda.  

For some inexplicable reason, though it was clearly a powerful demon beast, Han Yue couldn’t help but feel an immediate fondness for it. He couldn’t muster any killing intent!  

After years of cultivation, Han Yue no longer harbored the slightest fear or wariness toward second-tier demon beasts.  

He didn’t strike immediately, choosing instead to observe the panda’s next actions.  

But what happened next nearly made Han Yue burst out laughing!  

The panda, still sniffing enthusiastically, happily bounded straight toward Han Yue’s hiding spot.  

Yet halfway there, the massive bear suddenly stumbled—its front paws giving way as it face-planted into the ground with a resounding crash!  

The impact was so violent it seemed as if an invisible giant had forcefully shoved the bear’s head downward.  

The collision sent a deafening boom echoing for miles.  

The sheer momentum sent the panda’s body tumbling forward, flipping it completely upside down!  

Another, even louder crash followed, the tremors shaking the earth so violently that Han Yue could feel them from afar.  

Now sprawled on its back, the panda wore an expression of utter bewilderment!  

**"Awooo!"**  

The bear let out a series of distressed howls, flailing its limbs as it struggled to right itself—but to no avail!  

Han Yue hadn’t expected it, but right at the foot of this mountain lay a **[Ground Suction] death trap**.  

And this poor panda had the misfortune of stepping right into it, instantly becoming trapped!  

Now pinned on its back by an irresistible force, the bear couldn’t break free no matter how hard it tried.  

Han Yue watched the unlucky creature with amusement.  

Its desperate flailing, limbs flapping in the air, was like a comedic performance just for him.  

Seeing that the bear wouldn’t escape anytime soon, Han Yue didn’t rush to intervene.  

He continued his recovery process, and with the panda’s antics as entertainment, the tedious healing time became slightly more bearable.  

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.  

Han Yue’s injuries had healed to the muscle layer, bringing him one step closer to full recovery.  

In those three days, the panda had struggled at least a hundred times, but as its stamina and mana dwindled, its efforts grew weaker—its chances of escape fading with each attempt.  

Two more days later, the panda finally gave up on freeing itself and lay still, conserving its energy.  

But it hadn’t abandoned hope—instead of self-rescue, it switched to pleading for help.  

Han Yue listened as the bear sprawled on the ground, periodically letting out pitiful cries:  

**"Awooo!"**  

**"Help!"**  

**"Save Wubing!"**  

**"Someone save me!"**  

**"Ah! I’m so hungry! It smells so good!"**  

Between its cries, the panda would suddenly start sniffing the air with that same dopey, obsessed expression!  

Its behavior left Han Yue utterly speechless.  

Little did Han Yue know, what had drawn the panda across such a distance was the scent of the precious medicine **[Sweet Dew]** that had leaked during his recovery!  

Though he had mastered the **[Aura Concealment Art]** and could normally suppress such scents, his severe injuries had briefly disrupted his control.  

And this panda, Wubing, possessed an innate divine ability called **[Nose of the Gods]**, granting it an extraordinary sensitivity to the aura of treasures.  

By sheer coincidence, while roaming nearby, Wubing had caught a whiff of the **[Sweet Dew]** and, unable to resist the temptation, had rushed straight toward Han Yue’s hiding spot!  

Unfortunately, in its intoxicated pursuit of the scent, Wubing had unwittingly stumbled into the **[Ground Suction]** death trap.  

Without outside help, it would likely remain trapped for quite some time.  

But what tormented Wubing the most was that the treasure was right there—so close, yet utterly out of reach.  

The maddening aroma filled its senses, making its mouth water uncontrollably.  

**"Hungry! So hungry!"**  

Its cries grew louder, more desperate.  

Finally, Wubing could bear it no longer.  

With a furious roar, it mustered every last ounce of its strength and, in a desperate struggle, managed to flip itself over!  

Now, instead of lying on its back, the panda was face-down, rear in the air.  

Then, it unleashed the signature divine ability of its kind:  

**Supreme Divine Ability—[Iron Devourer]!**  

The panda opened its maw wide and began voraciously gnawing at the ground, heedless of anything else.  

In no time, it had chewed a massive crater into the earth.  

The **[Iron Devourer]** ability allowed the panda race to consume all manner of metals and minerals, digesting them to strengthen their bodies!  

This innate divine ability was also the reason pandas were known as the **Iron-Eating Clan** in the **[Jade Sky Realm]**.  

The **[Iron Devourer]** was already formidable, but in the metal-rich **Golden Blade Gorge**, it was even more effective—everywhere was a potential feast.  

After gorging itself on rocks, Wubing temporarily sated its hunger and regained enough energy to resume its cries for help.  

Once again, its howls echoed across the plains—but this time, they attracted an unexpected new development.  

A swarm of terrifying giant hornets, each over two meters long, was drawn by Wubing’s noise!  

Seven of the monstrous insects approached, each with six metallic wings, a venomous stinger, and a black-and-gold carapace that gleamed ominously.  

Their wings buzzed furiously as they circled the trapped panda, their intentions clearly hostile.  

Wubing immediately clamped its mouth shut and buried its head deep in the crater, pretending nothing had happened.  

These seven first-tier giant hornets were **[Gold-Devouring Wasps]**—one of the most dangerous swarm-type demon insects in the gorge!  

And among all the creatures in the **Golden Blade Gorge**, they were some of the most perfectly adapted!
