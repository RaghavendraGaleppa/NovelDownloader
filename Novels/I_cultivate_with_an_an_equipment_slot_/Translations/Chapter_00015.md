# Chapter 15: Now, Qi Refinement Second Layer  

"First, I need to see what this spirit field is suitable for planting."  

Zhang Yan didn't immediately start planting medicinal herbs. Instead, he first built a thatched hut in the valley.  

If nothing unexpected happened, this would become his base.  

Then, he carefully surveyed the entire valley.  

Although the valley was large, much of the land wasn't spirit fields—just ordinary soil. The actual spirit fields were limited to a small patch.  

According to the Sect Affairs Hall, this valley was newly developed spirit land.  

No one had cultivated it before.  

Zhang Yan was among the first batch assigned to plant here.  

This had both advantages and disadvantages.  

The benefit was that the spirit fields here were relatively fertile, with abundant spiritual energy.  

The drawback was that no one knew what these fields were best suited for. They could only rely on personal experience to judge.  

Zhang Yan had prepared for this. Equipping his spirit hoe, he began meticulously inspecting the fields.  

"These hundred acres are suitable for spirit rice. These twenty acres have slightly denser spiritual energy—they should be good for medicinal herbs."  

Soon, he had mapped out what to plant where.  

After finishing his survey, he took another walk around the valley.  

To his delight, he discovered another large plot of land infused with spiritual energy.  

Rough estimates suggested it spanned over three hundred acres.  

However, the spiritual energy here was sparse—not enough to qualify as proper spirit fields, so the sect wouldn't register it.  

But just because the sect overlooked it didn’t mean it was useless.  

"For these semi-spirit fields, I can plant some half-spirit grass or broadleaf vines," Zhang Yan thought, already planning.  

Half-spirit grass was essentially a type of spiritual weed. Aside from being used as fodder for spirit beasts, it had little other value.  

Broadleaf vines, on the other hand, were low-grade plants used to make talisman paper. They were easy to grow—just scatter the seeds, and they’d thrive without much care.  

These semi-spirit fields were perfect for broadleaf vines and half-spirit grass. The profits wouldn’t be high, but since they required no rent to the sect and minimal effort, it was a worthwhile investment.  

With his plan set, Zhang Yan got to work.  

His first task was to cultivate the two hundred acres of spirit fields.  

"It's a shame I don’t know any earth-element spells," Zhang Yan sighed. With such spells, the work would go much faster.  

But it didn’t matter. Though he lacked earth-element magic, his spirit hoe had the "Sharp" attribute, and so did his Golden Bamboo Sword.  

Equipping both, he began tilling the land. The hard soil parted effortlessly under his tools.  

Occasionally, he even used the sword’s blade aura.  

A single sweep of the aura could plow open a hundred-meter stretch of land.  

"Using the Golden Bamboo Sword’s blade aura for farming is incredibly effective!"  

After another slash, Zhang Yan admired the freshly tilled earth with satisfaction.  

If others knew he was using a flying sword for farming, they’d be baffled. Flying swords were among the more expensive magical artifacts.  

An average low-grade artifact might cost twenty to thirty spirit stones, but even the cheapest flying sword started at fifty.  

The reason was simple: flying swords were versatile.  

They could attack, defend, and even serve as flying tools.  

Because of this, most cultivators treated their flying swords with great care, maintaining them meticulously to avoid damage.  

And here was Zhang Yan—using his for farming!  

Truly, the joy of farming was something others couldn’t comprehend.  

Once all the spirit fields were plowed, Zhang Yan started sowing.  

For the spirit rice fields, he used Wang Ping’s seeds.  

After inspecting them, he found each grain was plumper than usual, with stronger spiritual energy.  

With such seeds, the harvest was bound to be bountiful.  

After planting the rice, he moved on to medicinal herbs.  

Most of his herb seeds were low-grade, except for a few high-quality ones given by Mu Sen.  

But he didn’t plant those.  

For two reasons:  

First, the spiritual energy of these fields wasn’t sufficient.  

Second, while high-grade herbs were valuable, their growth cycles were too long—often taking years. He couldn’t afford to wait that long.  

In short, crops like spirit rice—harvested three to four times a year—and fast-growing low-grade herbs were more practical.  

At least they’d provide a steady income.  

After planting all the low-grade herb seeds, Zhang Yan finally relaxed.  

Then, he took out the Tranquil Rain Whisk.  

Though it was only a low-grade artifact, its effects were remarkable.  

When activated, a dark cloud formed in the sky.  

The cloud wasn’t large—only about ten square meters at first.  

But as he channeled more spiritual energy into it, it gradually expanded to cover an acre.  

"Activate!"  

With a low chant, faint lightning flickered within the cloud.  

The moisture thickened until it reached a critical point, condensing into raindrops that pattered onto the ground.  

Within moments, the drizzle turned into a steady, fine rain, nourishing the fields below.  

Watching this, Zhang Yan couldn’t help but marvel at the wonders of magic.  

In his past life, artificial rain wasn’t always successful—it depended on atmospheric conditions.  

But magic defied logic. Once cast, it worked without fail.  

"With these rain spells, the harvest should be excellent."  

Due to his limited spiritual energy, one rain spell could only cover an acre.  

Including the semi-spirit fields, he had five hundred acres to water—requiring five hundred castings!  

After each spell, he immediately sat down to meditate and recover his energy.  

...  

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.  

On this day, after casting another rain spell, Zhang Yan was about to rest when a sudden inspiration struck.  

He began circulating his spiritual energy, directing it toward his meridians.  

The energy surged like a tidal wave, relentlessly battering the barriers within.  

Under its force, cracks began to form.  

"This is my chance!"  

Feeling the shift, Zhang Yan’s heart leaped with joy.  

He had noticed earlier that exhausting his energy through spellcasting and then replenishing it slightly improved his cultivation.  

Over these past days, he had repeated this cycle hundreds of times.  

Now, it was time to reap the rewards.  

Pushing harder, he even took out a spirit stone to absorb its energy.  

Finally, the stubborn barrier shattered under the overwhelming force.  

At this moment—he reached Qi Refinement, Second Layer!
