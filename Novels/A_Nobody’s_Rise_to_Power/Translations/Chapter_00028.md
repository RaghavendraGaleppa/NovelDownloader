Chapter 28: Welcome Banquet

The welcome banquet was held in the wing of Steward Li’s small courtyard.

Almost all the outer estate stewards of the main branch’s senior line were present.

They included Niu Youde, the outer estate steward responsible for overseeing all outer estate affairs; Li Damu, the head accountant who managed the main branch’s finances, contracts, and land ledgers; Zhao Hongyu, the procurement steward; Ma Sanyuan, the granary steward; and Liu Yu, the captain of the guard.

The position of captain of the guard had originally been held by Cheng Dakuan, but Liu Yu, the former deputy captain, had taken over.

As for Cheng Dakuan, ever since being rescued from the water prison, he had been running a high fever and was currently recuperating.

As the chief steward of the main branch, Li Youcai enjoyed the privilege of having his own private kitchen where the master’s dishes were prepared.

In aristocratic families, the hierarchy was strict. The diet and lodging of servants and subordinates varied strictly according to their rank.

Stewards like Yang Can, who were senior management personnel, enjoyed the privilege of "allotted meals."

They did not dine with the masters but shared the same kitchen. The dishes were prepared by the estate’s head chef, though the specifications were slightly lower than those for the masters. Their daily dietary standards were actually equivalent to those of a low-ranking official in the court.

Below them, the servants and maids enjoyed different dietary treatments based on the difficulty of their skills and the nature of their duties.

For example, Qing Mei, a personal chief maid, had pastries, eggs,酱肉 (marinated meat), and other items included in her daily rations.

Ordinary rough maids and servants, on the other hand, only had millet rice and pickled vegetables daily, and they only saw meat once every ten days.

Today, Li Youcai was hosting Yang Can. Although he said it was arranged by his wife, he was actually paying for it himself. Most of the dishes were prepared by the chef.

This was Yang Can’s first formal meeting with the outer estate stewards of the main branch in his capacity as the second steward. Although he already knew some of them, Li Youcai still introduced them one by one.

Among them, procurement steward Zhao Hongyu and granary steward Ma Sanyuan were newcomers. Li Youcai subtly hinted to Yang Can during the introductions, meaning that these two were arranged by the young mistress, Su Chan Zhi, and thus were not his own people.

Yang Can smiled and nodded, thinking to himself, "So these two are the ones on our side."

With the death of the young master, Yu Chengye, and the young mistress, Su Chan Zhi, taking control of the main branch, it was now split into two factions: the Young Mistress Faction and the Late Young Master Faction.

However, the two sides were currently on relatively good terms because it was still uncertain whether the young mistress was pregnant.

If the young mistress was not pregnant, the main branch would be dissolved sooner or later.

By then, the stewards of the original main branch would be assigned to other places or simply be "sent to the cold palace."

Therefore, before it was confirmed whether the young mistress was pregnant, there was no conflict between the two factions; they were all waiting.

Even if it was confirmed that Su Chan Zhi was pregnant, the two sides would not engage in a fierce conflict.

Because they would have to wait another nine months to determine whether the child was a boy or a girl.

Before that, the new and old factions, the Young Mistress Faction and the Late Young Master Faction, were like two unfortunate brothers sharing the same suffering.

There would be competition between them, but before the situation became clear by the end of this year, there would be no irreconcilable situation.

"Which affairs of the main branch will the Second Steward be handling in the future?" Accountant Li poured a cup of wine for Yang Can and asked with a smile.

Yang Can replied with a smile, "The Chief Steward has been very considerate of me. Since I am new here, the Chief Steward was afraid I wouldn't be able to handle it, so he assigned me to manage the six large manors and three pastures that the Second Master handed over, to make things less troublesome."

"Pfft!" Li Damu spat out a mouthful of wine. Fortunately, he quickly turned his head, otherwise he would have ruined the entire table of fine dishes.

Less troublesome?

The six large manors and three pastures handed over by the Second Master, less troublesome?

It’s extremely troublesome, okay?

The stewards present were all sharp-witted. Hearing this, they all looked at Li Youcai, thinking, "Chief Steward, that’s not very noble of you."

Li Youcai’s face flushed. He didn’t know if Yang Can was genuinely foolish or just pretending to be stupid. He could only raise his cup to hide his embarrassment and said loudly, "The manors and pastures already have established rules. As long as we follow the procedures, there won’t be any mistakes. So, I thought that I would have Steward Yang start with the manors and pastures to familiarize himself with the affairs of the main branch. Our Yu family is based on farming. As long as Steward Yang doesn’t make any mistakes, it will be easy for him to rise to prominence."

Yang Can raised his cup with a grateful expression and said, "Thank you for the Chief Steward’s care. I will remember it in my heart."

Li Youcai laughed and said, "I am getting old, and I don’t have much ambition to compete for higher positions. I sincerely hope that all the stewards of our main branch will do well. Today, I take good care of you all. In the future, when you rise to prominence, don’t forget this bond. Come, come, let’s drink, let’s drink."

After saying this, Li Youcai raised his cup and drained it in one gulp. The others naturally raised their cups in response.

Those who saw through the ruse did not expose it; that was the way to be good friends.

This welcome banquet for good friends lasted until nearly the third watch before it ended. Among the stewards, those who couldn’t hold their liquor were already walking unsteadily.

Li Youcai loved wine and was even more drunk, lying on the table like a dead pig, snoring loudly.

The two young servants, Laixi and Wangcai, were waiting in the side room and had long since dozed off.

Yang Can woke them up, lit a lantern, and saw the guests out. Madame Pan heard the commotion and also came over.

Seeing Yang Can trying to lift Li Youcai up, who was so drunk he was unconscious and completely limp and unmovable, Pan Xiaowan said impatiently, "This dead ghost drank so much again. Don’t bother with him, just let him sleep here for the night."

Yang Can said, "It’s not quite right to leave Brother Li here. Rest assured, Sister-in-law, I can manage to carry him."

Pan Xiaowan went around to the other side of Li Youcai. She and Yang Can each lifted one of Li Youcai’s arms and put it over their shoulders before they could pull him up.

The two of them exerted a lot of effort before they could carry Li Youcai into the main room, around the screen, and into the bedroom.

"Let go, Sister-in-law, I’ll carry Brother Li to the bed."

As Yang Can spoke, he moved his arm around behind Li Youcai’s shoulder. He wanted to change his position to support Li Youcai under his armpits and put him on the bed.

Unexpectedly, Madame Pan let go a bit late. Yang Can’s hand reached out, and the back of his hand brushed firmly against a soft mass.

*Gasp*—Yang Can was startled and quickly withdrew his hand. This time, it really wasn’t Pan Xiaowan trying to take advantage of him. When he touched her, she subconsciously let go too. The two of them let go at the same time, and Chief Steward Li was left unattended.

Chief Steward Li had a silly, dazed smile on his face. He swayed in place for a moment, then his body tilted forward, and his forehead hit the edge of the bed with a loud *thud*.

Yang Can was startled. That was a really hard hit.

However, under the influence of alcohol, Li Youcai didn’t feel any pain at all.

He slid weakly down against the bed, using the footstool as a pillow, and fell into a peaceful sleep with a purplish bruise on his forehead.

"Chief Steward, wake up, sleep on the bed..."

Yang Can still wanted to drag him onto the bed, but Pan Xiaowan said impatiently, "Alright, alright, don’t bother with him. Once he’s had two pounds of horse piss, not even thunder can wake him up."

Pan Xiaowan spoke while pulling Yang Can up. Her seductive eyes instantly filled with a misty moisture. "Brother-in-law, were you satisfied with the food and wine tonight?"

Brother-in-law? Although Pan Xiaowan’s address wasn’t wrong, the way she said it in a coquettish tone felt strange.

Yang Can forced a smile and said, "The food was extremely delicious."

Pan Xiaowan said, "Then... which dish did you like the most?"

"Uh... all... they were all quite delicious..."

Madame Pan said softly, "That Qiang Zhu and醍醐 (Tihu) were made by Sister-in-law. I don’t know if..."

"Good, extremely good, very delicious. That Qiang Zhu is spicy and fragrant, it really whets the appetite. Especially the Tihu, drinking a bowl after getting drunk is sobering and refreshing. It’s excellent, excellent."

"Qiang Zhu" is boiled sliced meat, a dish developed from the fusion of Xianbei and Qiang cuisine.

As for "Tihu," it is yogurt made from refined milk fat.

Not all yogurt is called "Tihu." Only yogurt made with the best ingredients and with the best taste is called Tihu.

Pan Xiaowan giggled, raised her hand to tidy the hair at her temples, and said with seductive eyes, "Since Brother-in-law likes it, just let Sister-in-law know when you want to eat it."

There was still someone lying on the floor. Yang Can felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles. "Oh, okay, okay, thank you, Sister-in-law. Brother he..."

"Leave him be. Even if he slept in the courtyard, he’d be comfortable."

As if to prove her words, Pan Xiaowan kicked Li Youcai in the butt. Li Youcai grunted twice but continued to sleep soundly.

Yang Can forced a smile and said, "In that case, I’ll take my leave."

Yang Can turned and walked away, but Pan Xiaowan followed him like a shadow.

When they reached the corridor, Yang Can quickly turned back and said, "Sister-in-law, please go back."

Pan Xiaowan looked at Yang Can with watery eyes. "Your residence, Sister-in-law cleaned it up for you this afternoon. You don’t know where things are placed. Why don’t Sister-in-law go with you... to look for them together."

"No need, no need, I only have a few things. It’s getting late, Sister-in-law, please go back."

Pan Xiaowan said, "Actually, Sister-in-law also knows how to make a milk pastry. It tastes even better than the Tihu. Does Brother-in-law want to try it?"

She held her hands behind her back, speaking in a sweet voice while pushing her chest out high, almost telling Yang Can the origin of the milk pastry.

"Hehe, no, no, I’m already full. No, I can’t hold any more wine."

"Hehe, today is your first day taking office. That dead ghost welcomed you, so Sister-in-law will cleanse the dust off you."

"No, no, another day, let’s talk about it another day!" Yang Can finished speaking and fled in a panic.

Oh my, did the Chief Steward marry such a young, beautiful wife but not satisfy her? Why is she so thirsty, like a she-wolf?

Watching Yang Can flee like a bolt of lightning, Pan Xiaowan couldn’t help but giggle. Her face still held a seductive charm, but her eyes gradually turned cold.

"The Su family is really willing to part with it. To extend their reach into the Yu family, they even sacrificed one of the 'Three Beauties of the Su family.'"

The Three Beauties of the Su family were a title given by the arrogant young masters of the high-ranking families in Longshang to the three most beautiful girls in the Su family.

These three beauties were: Su Xianxiang, Su Zuigu, and Su Chan Zhi.

Pan Xiaowan suddenly laughed softly. "It’s a pity that Yu Chengye was killed by his second uncle. If Su Chan Zhi fails to get pregnant, the Su family’s efforts this time will probably be in vain."

"Ah..."

Pan Xiaowan sighed softly and looked up at the bright moon in the sky. "If the main branch is dissolved, I’m afraid I... will also become a useless discarded piece."
