# Chapter 1: Green Lake Market

"Boom! Rumble!"

A thunderous roar suddenly echoed across the cloudless sky.

In the next moment, a dark cloud about an acre in size condensed out of thin air, pitch-black and churning as it descended.

After several flashes of lightning and claps of thunder, a light rain began to fall, droplets landing on the fields below.

The rice ears in the field visibly plumped up at a remarkable speed.

Lu Xu stood with his hands forming seals, eyes closed and motionless.

Only when his face turned pale and sweat dripped from his temples did he finally open his eyes.

Letting out a soft exhale, he looked at the acre of mature Green Lake Spirit Rice before him, a glimmer of joy appearing in his eyes.

"Half a year of hard work, casting the Minor Cloud Rain Technique so many times, and finally it's harvest time!"

As he released the hand seals, the dark cloud above his head immediately dissipated.

The sky cleared once more without a trace of impurity, the scorching sun beating down on the earth as waves of heat rolled across the land.

Looking at the fruits of his labor, Lu Xu sighed softly, a hint of self-mockery rising in his heart:

"I was farming before transmigrating, and I'm still farming after transmigrating. Did I transmigrate for nothing?"

Yes, Lu Xu was a transmigrator, not a native of this world.

This was a world where immortals, demons, monsters, and ghosts existed.

When he was first introduced to the path of immortality, Lu Xu had been excited, thinking he would become one of those carefree immortals who soared through the skies, slaying demons with a swing of his sword.

Who would have thought that not long after, he'd be assigned as a spirit farmer!

Who knew cultivators had to farm too?

Weren't they supposed to live on mist-shrouded mystical mountains, dining on wind and dew, befriending pines and chrysanthemums, accompanied by deer, arriving on the wind and departing on cranes, free and unfettered?

But after transmigrating, Lu Xu had to face reality:

Not only were there farming cultivators, but there were also those who raised pigs, chickens, grew tea, fished...

The only difference from the mortal world was the addition of the word "spirit" before these occupations.

Before transmigrating, Lu Xu had been an agricultural university student, spending years working the land.

Now, he was a spirit farmer attached to the Green Lake Market of the Wei Kingdom, just sixteen years old, having only officially entered the cultivation world last year.

Life as a cultivator was far from easy.

Farming was troublesome—one had to learn farming techniques, prevent pests and spirit beasts from destroying the crops, and constantly tend to them with care.

During his first six months at Green Lake Market, Lu Xu had worked as a helper in Old Zhang's fields next door.

While assisting with the spirit fields, he studied techniques and practiced his spiritual power.

Only after gaining some ability did he strike out on his own.

After applying to the Mo family, owners of Green Lake Market, to contract an acre of spirit fields, Lu Xu officially became a spirit farmer.

After half a year of hard cultivation, the day of harvest had finally arrived.

"Crack! Snap!"

Having recovered his spiritual power, Lu Xu took out a sickle and cast a Sharpness Technique on it before stepping into the rice field.

Under the enhancement of the Sharpness Technique, the originally tough stalks became fragile.

By sunset, Lu Xu had nearly finished harvesting all the Green Lake Rice from the acre of land, bundling it up.

"Whew!"

Standing up and rubbing his sore back, Lu Xu looked at the bundled rice in the field, thinking to himself:

"This market isn't entirely peaceful—theft happens frequently. The closer to harvest, the more vigilant I need to be!"

"I'll have to process all this rice overnight and wait for the Mo family's steward to come tomorrow..."

With this in mind, he didn't dare rest and immediately set to work.

By the next morning, several large sacks had appeared before Lu Xu.

Each sack was filled with plump spirit rice, pale green in color, exuding a refreshing, fragrant aroma.

"Whoosh!"

A red streak shot over from the distance, arriving before Lu Xu in moments.

The red light revealed itself to be a crimson sword wreathed in blazing flames.

Standing on the sword was a stout, short man who nimbly twisted his body and hopped off with a light tap of his toes.

With a wave of his hand, the sword shrank and turned into a red streak that disappeared into a gray cloth pouch at his waist.

Lu Xu watched with envy—he knew that gray pouch was the legendary storage bag.

And that crimson sword was a magical artifact only cultivators could use.

Unfortunately, neither was something he could afford at his current stage. Even the most ordinary storage bag cost hundreds of spirit stones.

Having only entered the cultivation world a year ago, Lu Xu's pockets were empty—he didn't have a single spirit stone to his name.

After putting away his artifact, the stout man turned to Lu Xu with a bright smile.

His eyes narrowed amiably, giving him the appearance of a Maitreya Buddha.

"Little Lu, this is your first harvest—how did it turn out?"

The man walked over and patted Lu Xu's shoulder as if they were old friends.

This stout man was Mo Hu, a member of the Mo family and the manager overseeing spirit farmers like Lu Xu.

"Steward Mo, the harvest is all here. I estimate about eight hundred catties," Lu Xu said carefully after some thought.

"Oh? Eight hundred catties?"

Mo Hu's slit-like eyes gleamed as he examined the coarse sacks before Lu Xu.

Rubbing his hands together, he went to heft each sack, his smile growing wider:

"Little Lu, you're exaggerating! For a first harvest, how could you get eight hundred catties? At most, I'd say seven hundred!"

"Steward Mo, I weighed them carefully last night—it's definitely eight hundred catties."

"Hahaha, you must have miscalculated!"

Dangerous glints flashed in Mo Hu's narrowed eyes as he gripped Lu Xu's shoulder like an eagle's talon, causing sharp pain.

According to Mo family rules, any spirit farmer contracting their fields had to pay six hundred catties of spirit rice per acre, regardless of yield.

Mo Hu was the Mo family's collector of spirit rice.

Clearly, this was a highly lucrative position.

He undoubtedly took advantage to line his own pockets.

Originally, with an eight hundred catty harvest, Lu Xu would keep two hundred.

But Mo Hu insisted it was seven hundred catties because he intended to skim one hundred, leaving Lu Xu with only one hundred.

"Ahem, Steward Mo, isn't that too little? At least seven hundred fifty catties?" Lu Xu said with a troubled expression.

Mo Hu's face immediately darkened:

"Little Lu, don't be greedy. Seven hundred catties is already plenty! Besides, I'm counting all this rice as first-grade for you. If any turns out to be subpar, your quota would increase!"

Lu Xu instantly understood the threat in Mo Hu's words.

When under someone else's roof, one must bow their head.

Mo Hu was powerful, with rumored backing from a Mo family elder—far beyond what a small-time spirit farmer like Lu Xu could afford to offend.

Lu Xu clenched and unclenched his fists before forcing a smile:

"Steward Mo is right. It's my first harvest—how could I have such high yields without experience?"

"Hahaha, Little Lu, I like straightforward people like you!" Mo Hu laughed heartily, immensely pleased.

With a wave of his hand, seven of the eight sacks disappeared from the ground, leaving Lu Xu with just one.

Lu Xu cursed inwardly, mentally noting Mo Hu's name in his little black book.

"Little Lu, do you want to sell this remaining rice or keep it for yourself?"

Mo Hu's small eyes darted as he looked at the last sack.

"What's your buying price, Steward Mo?"

Lu Xu didn't answer immediately, wary that this greedy bastard might try to fleece him further.

"Ahem, spirit rice goes for forty catties per spirit stone. Your hundred catties are worth two and a half stones. Tell you what—I'll give you three stones as a favor. How's that?"

Lu Xu was surprised and looked at Mo Hu with newfound respect.

The extra half stone was likely compensation.

A stick followed by a carrot—this fat bastard had some tricks up his sleeve.

"I'll take your offer, Steward Mo."

Mo Hu departed on his flying sword, leaving Lu Xu with three spirit stones.

Looking at the stones in his hand, Lu Xu sighed.

Half a year of backbreaking work for just a few stones—life as a spirit farmer was tough!

After storing the stones, he entered a simple wooden hut by the field.

This was his temporary dwelling where he occasionally stayed during busy farming seasons.

Inside, Lu Xu moved a heavy cabinet aside.

Lifting a wooden plank beneath revealed a dark hole in the ground.

Jumping in, he found himself in a seven or eight square meter cellar.

In the corner sat two sacks emitting the fragrance of spirit rice.

Lu Xu grinned—these were the two hundred catties he'd hidden the night before.

His actual harvest had been one thousand catties; he'd underreported two hundred to account for Mo Hu's skimming.

"Selling some of these two hundred catties plus my three stones... it's enough! More than enough!"

Excitement flashed across Lu Xu's face.

Closing his eyes to perform internal vision, a glowing green stele appeared before him.

This was an external object he'd discovered within himself after gaining the ability for internal vision—likely the source of his transmigration.

Lu Xu wasn't entirely sure what the stele was.

But after extensive exploration, he'd mostly figured out its function.

On the stele's surface, lines of text glowed green:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 16/103]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining - First Layer]
[Spiritual Roots: Wood (Mid-Low)]
[Technique: Green Wood Art (Novice) 26/100]
[Duplication Points: 0]
[Skills - Spells]:
Minor Cloud Rain Technique (Novice): 76/100
Gengjin Sword (Novice): 44/100
Sharpness Technique (Novice): 32/100

It was an utterly ordinary status panel!

The only unique feature was the "Duplication Points."

This was the stele's most heaven-defying aspect.

The stele could duplicate others' mature experiences for Lu Xu's use, instantly granting him insights that would normally require years of tempering.

Whether cultivation experiences, breakthrough insights, or skills like alchemy, artifact forging, talisman-making—all could be duplicated!

Duplicating these experiences required duplication points.

There was only one way to obtain them!

Holding the three spirit stones, Lu Xu focused his will.

A green light immediately emanated from the stele, enveloping the stones.

In the blink of an eye, the stones vanished.

After the green light faded, the stele showed a change—the duplication points increased from 0 to 3!

"It really works! Spirit stones can convert to duplication points. Next is verifying whether these points can truly duplicate experiences!" Lu Xu's heart swelled with excitement at the sight.

He took slow, deep breaths to calm his racing heart.
