Chapter 161: Lightning-Fire Refines Inner Medicine

In the spacious living room, on the sandalwood table, the pristine white teacups remained untouched. Mu Huaijin and two others frowned, somewhat uneasy about the disciples.

"They are chatting happily. If you don't believe me, go see for yourselves," an elder from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court said.

Mu Huaijin actually stood up, disregarding the elder's slightly stiff expression.

Soon, Mu Huaijin returned expressionless, his face rather rigid.

He discovered that some disciples were earnestly exchanging ideas with Qi Zizai, even showing admiration and shock, humbling themselves to ask for guidance.

Qin Ming put down his teacup and said, "Fire is earth, lightning is heaven. When fire rises, it can connect with lightning. This is what is meant by 'earth fire activating heavenly lightning.' Your fire energy is already complete; you don't need to seek lightning from emptiness. You only need to activate the fire. When it can scorch the night sky within your body, the lightning energy will naturally appear."

"This... can it really work?" The silver-armored girl's expression shifted from indignation to doubt, then surprise, and finally, a complex look mixed with admiration.

Qin Ming smiled and said, "Of course, it can. Have you forgotten? During our duel, when I used Yi Wood Essence Qi to fuel your flames, didn't your lightning energy naturally appear when your fire energy surged?"

"I think I understand!" The silver-armored girl nodded solemnly.

Normally, fire energy and lightning energy should advance together, but fire and lightning had long been out of balance in her body. Thus, she had to find another path: once the fire energy was sufficiently abundant, there was no need to force it; lightning energy would naturally manifest.

Even extreme Yin can give birth to Yang, and lightning-fire energy is fundamentally one. Lightning energy can naturally be born from "extreme fire."

In fact, Qin Ming had more associations, but he thought they might not be suitable for the silver-armored girl, as a slight misstep could lead to her death.

"Lightning and fire combine to refine great medicine." Qin Ming astutely pondered the implications of this phrase.

Many would believe that when Purple Mansion Lightning-Fire is cultivated to a certain degree, it becomes a special spiritual flame capable of assisting alchemists in refining external medicine.

However, Qin Ming believed that this wasn't about seeking external medicine, but rather about "inner refinement."

He had deeply studied the *Changing Fate Scripture* and was quite familiar with the ancient sages' style. That concise sentence was very likely a "true word."

He felt that if a few more words were added, it wouldn't be so easily overlooked.

"Lightning and fire combine, Dragon-Tiger Conjunction, can refine great medicine." He mused, feeling there was a deeper meaning, and it was likely this interpretation.

Qin Ming temporarily set aside these thoughts, as he still needed to have friendly and cordial exchanges with others. Besides the silver-armored girl, there were other people present.

He still had his sights on the *Immortal Wrestling Scripture*, but Li Daocheng's will was firm, so it was probably out of reach.

He could only start with other disciples, fixing his gaze on the yellow-clothed youth who had once manifested eight pairs of golden arms.

"Brother, there's a problem with your technique." It was a familiar opening line; he had just used it with the silver-armored girl and had engaged in a "heated discussion" with her for a long time.

Moreover, a group of extra-sect disciples could see that the silver-armored girl had indeed benefited greatly.

They also didn't understand why this madman from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court was so enthusiastic, kindly helping them analyze their problems.

"No way, I feel like his terrifying comprehension is almost comparable to my sister's," the white-clothed girl Luo Yao observed Qin Ming.

She was very perceptive, noticing that he could extract a large section of insights from just a small piece of scripture, far more detailed than the original meaning.

Not long ago, the silver-armored girl had briefly mentioned a few sections of the scriptural teachings related to her problems, so everyone present had observed Qi Zizai's performance.

The yellow-clothed youth initially didn't want to bother with Qin Ming, thinking that his scriptural teachings were a secret technique that outsiders couldn't possibly understand.

"What is called 'manifesting a thousand hands' is an imitation of the 'god-like creature' deep within the Night Mist World. It sits on a holy mountain, its body like a scorching sun, holding divine artifacts and scriptures with its thousand arms, impossible for ordinary people to look at directly."

Qin Ming's expression was calm as he discussed with him.

"Your *Thousand Hands* manual, also known as the *Battle Body*, was created by a senior predecessor on my path of rebirth after he ventured deep into the Night Mist World, observed the god-like creature from afar, and bled from his eyes until he became blind."

The yellow-clothed youth was stunned. This differed little from what the elders had told him; he actually knew all this!

Then, the two began to interact.

Qin Ming sensed his emotional fluctuations, gaining more valuable information. He began to cite classics and then delve into deeper analysis.

The area fell silent. The group of extra-sect disciples were all stunned. Was this still the "loser" they had looked down upon?

At this moment, their psychological superiority was shaken and began to crumble, because in terms of comprehension alone, the other party was truly "monstrous"!

"A future Grandmaster on the path of rebirth?" Someone's eyes held a strange glint, as if they were looking at a monster.

"Excuse me, could you please make a cup of tea?" Qin Ming's throat was dry from talking, and he handed out his teacup.

The white-clothed girl Luo Yao, in a daze, directly took it. Then she nearly bristled. Was he already ordering her around?

Qin Ming didn't even see who took the teacup. He was still discussing the Dao with the yellow-clothed youth, determined to acquire the *Thousand Hands* technique, which, if he comprehended it, would unleash vastly different power.

Luo Yao's body stiffened slightly. How could she possibly be willing to pour tea!

But if she were to flare up and smash the cup, would that lead to a misunderstanding between the two sides?

Nearby, the disciples of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court were all amazed. Senior Brother Qi Zizai was even casually ordering around extra-sect disciples; his prestige was truly immense.

Only Zhuo Ya doubted his identity, but she had no evidence.

She searched but found that Qin Ming and Cao Wuji had not arrived. It was said they were in secluded cultivation practicing a rare technique.

In the end, Qin Ming didn't get his tea, but he was very satisfied with obtaining the *Battle Body* and prepared to study it in depth.

A golden strange bird soared from behind the Six Imperial Ancestral Court mountain. Although it appeared only palm-sized, its speed was incredibly fast, beyond human imagination, crossing the boundless, dark world.

Finally, it appeared before a mountain gate shrouded in clouds and mist. After reporting, it flew inside, and the letter it carried landed in a slender, fair hand.

"Lu Zizai has revived, and his aptitude is even stronger than Lu Yu's," the owner of the slender hand murmured in the night, then unfolded the letter to read it.

***

In a relatively harmonious atmosphere, the exchange meeting concluded. Qin Ming had interacted with many people but only acquired two secret techniques, which he was content with.

That same day, he began to study them.

Of these, the *Thousand Hands* technique, when cultivated, was considered a powerful Battle Body. However, Qin Ming only practiced it for one night before temporarily giving up.

It was already good if his Heavenly Light Qi could be emitted slightly in the newborn realm. Practicing this secret manual now was too strenuous. After a brief attempt to manifest some arms, they were short and faint, making him look like a centipede overall.

Mainly, it was still quite difficult for him to materialize Heavenly Light Qi, as it was hard to stabilize and would quickly dissipate.

After resting, Qin Ming studied the *Purple Mansion Lightning-Fire* manual.

He had already mastered Leaving Fire Qi, Wind-Lightning Qi, Wind-Fire Qi, etc., which inherently contained fire and lightning energy. Now, after deeply analyzing this book, it could be said that his efforts were twice as effective.

Ultimately, he not only cultivated Lightning-Fire Qi but also gained some mastery, as it could be converted from Wind-Fire Qi and Wind-Lightning Qi.

For a moment, a layer of lightning-fire appeared on Qin Ming's body.

"Now, while the Lightning-Fire Qi hasn't reached great completion, is the perfect time to try refining medicine. Even if my understanding is wrong, it won't severely injure me."

What he sought was naturally not external medicine; he began "inner refinement."

Following his understanding, Qin Ming activated "earth fire" from his feet, moving upwards, and cautiously guided "heavenly lightning" from his head, letting it spread downwards.

With a bang, golden stars danced before his eyes. Such lightning-fire energy rushing wildly within his own body was quite uncomfortable.

Fortunately, this lightning-fire had only just been cultivated and was far from fatal, so he could confidently and boldly manipulate it to verify his thoughts.

Qin Ming was blasted by the lightning-fire energy at least thirty times. Even his powerful physical body felt intense pain. His face was bruised, and his hair stood on end, making him look quite disheveled.

If anyone knew what he was doing, they would surely think he was looking for trouble, purely self-abusing.

On the thirty-sixth attempt, Qin Ming's lightning energy passed through his head, no longer exploding in his face, and his fire energy had also spread to his legs.

On the forty-ninth attempt, the earth fire reached his abdomen, and the heavenly lightning reached his chest. His expression changed slightly, not because he was severely injured, but because he felt his flesh and blood were being subtly baptized.

"There's a way! The heavenly lightning and earth fire haven't even fused yet, and they're already tempering the body. As expected, it's not just an offensive technique, but also a method of inner refinement!" His confidence grew.

Finally, after nearly a hundred attempts, Qin Ming was close to success.

The earth fire and heavenly lightning met in his chest and abdomen, intertwining and revolving, slowly shrinking, as if about to transform into a single pill.

"Lightning and fire combine, Dragon-Tiger Conjunction, can refine great medicine!"

Qin Ming confirmed that this method was viable.

He continued to experiment. Once, as the lightning and fire intertwined and rotated violently, he seemed to catch a faint medicinal scent!

Of course, this wasn't smelled through his nose and mouth, but rather his accumulated spiritual light of consciousness and divine wisdom within his body sensed it, "smelling" the peculiar "fragrance" emitted by the faint "inner medicine."

"This method is wonderful. Even if I can't refine the Great Dragon-Tiger Medicine, a daily session of lightning and fire will serve to baptize my flesh, blood, and internal organs. It's not just a killer move, but also a very high-level health cultivation technique."

Qin Ming was confident that he would eventually refine the "inner medicine"!

Two days later, Lu Zizai appeared and told him they needed to leave.

Qin Ming had been immersed in inner refinement, completely oblivious to the outside world, but now he was fully awake.

"Senior Brother Lu, I'll go with you!" He worried he couldn't leave alone, especially since his various performances had surely drawn the attention of the old guys from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court.

"Yes, you can," Lu Zizai nodded in agreement.

"Senior Brother Lu, what's your background anyway?" Qin Ming asked.

"My grandfather is Lu Yu," Lu Zizai informed him.

"Lu Yu?" Qin Ming's eyes widened. Could the so-called Lu Yu be... Six Imperial?!

"It's just as you imagine," Lu Zizai said calmly.

Qin Ming's heart surged with waves, and it took him a long time to say, "I thought you were a Young Ancestor."

Lu Zizai sighed lightly, "Not many of that generation are left."

When Lu Zizai led Qin Ming away, no one stopped them. They moved unhindered, smoothly exiting the mountain gate.

Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief. It was then that he noticed a small golden bird on Lu Zizai's shoulder. He was about to praise its beauty when he instantly stiffened.

Because the little bird was also looking at him, making him feel as if he was being stared at by a primordial beast.

In a trance, within his keen instinctual perception, he seemed to see a Night Mist World behind the small bird, where a colossal golden raptor, comparable to a mountain, stood!

He quickly averted his gaze. Was even a small bird so absurd?

"Old Man Li!" Someone waved outside the mountain gate. It was actually Li Qingyun; he had been guarding here for who knew how many days.

"Old Man Li!" Qin Ming was deeply moved and immediately ran over.
