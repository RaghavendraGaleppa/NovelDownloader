# Chapter 160: Talisman Treasure  

"I have a powerful talisman that can unleash an attack equivalent to an early Foundation Establishment cultivator's strike!" said one Qi Refining cultivator.  

One after another, the Qi Refining cultivators revealed their trump cards. As elite disciples of their sects, each of them possessed means that surpassed their current cultivation level.  

Of course, these trump cards were not easy to use. For instance, the self-detonation of a Bronze Corpse would backlash onto its master if not protected by the 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation'. In the midst of battle, such a move was almost equivalent to mutual destruction.  

As for powerful talismans, activating them at the Qi Refining stage required time. True instant activation was impossible, and that brief moment could mean the difference between life and death.  

Li Shiming was also considering whether he should reveal his own methods. Previously, he had wanted to keep his Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse and mid-grade Gatling magical artifact a secret, as neither had ever been seen in this world before.  

However, after meeting Ren Fei'er's mother—a Golden Core powerhouse—and seeing the way she looked at his Bronze Corpse and Gatling, he realized he had been overestimating himself.  

To powerful cultivators, his tricks were insignificant. No matter how many variations a Qi Refining-stage Bronze Corpse had, its combat power remained at the Qi Refining level.  

As for the mid-grade Gatling, its true strength lay in its continuous attacks at the level of a late Qi Refining cultivator. But beyond a certain threshold, such attacks wouldn't even break through defenses.  

Even if the attacks piled up to a terrifying number, they would still be ineffective if they couldn't penetrate.  

Of course, this was from the perspective of a Golden Core powerhouse. Among Qi Refining cultivators, the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse was merely an oddity—just more attack angles and weapons.  

The mid-grade Gatling, however, was a true killing machine. Unless one had the physical resilience of someone like Baili Jinyan, there was no way to withstand its barrage.  

Moreover, Li Shiming wasn't worried about others coveting his Bronze Corpse or Gatling.  

The foundation of the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse lay in his knowledge of anatomy and surgical techniques from his past life, allowing him to connect every minute blood vessel and nerve with precision, combined with the medical researcher's creative ideas.  

Additionally, there was the 'Nether Ghost Realm Formation' crafted from third-grade spiritual materials. Without these, any imitation of a Three-Headed, Six-Armed Corpse would be nothing more than a hollow shell, devoid of practical use.  

The reason the corpse puppet could smoothly circulate Yin energy was precisely because every blood vessel and nerve had been meticulously connected.  

As for the mid-grade Gatling, there was even less to worry about. The cost of crafting a single one was as high as 10,000 spirit stones, not to mention the intricate micro-array formations densely inscribed on its surface.  

These micro-arrays were crafted with sub-micron precision—something even Li Shiming couldn't replicate outside his computational space.  

The complexity of the Gatling's formations also served as a natural encryption. Even if an array master wanted to study it, the trap formations designed by IBMz15 would drive them mad.  

Most importantly, Li Shiming now had backing. Though it might seem like he was relying on connections, he did indeed have the support of a Golden Core elder.  

Anyone who dared to try and take advantage of him would have to consider Elder Yin's stance.  

Of course, he didn't know that his backing extended beyond Elder Yin—Ren Fei'er's mother, Elder Ren of the Profound Nether Sect, was also a Golden Core elder.  

"Everyone, let's prepare to counterattack. I'll advance the 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation'. Fellow senior brothers, coordinate your attacks for maximum effect!" Li Shiming said as he summoned his Bronze Corpse.  

The appearance of the corpse puppet stunned all the cultivators, especially the two Profound Nether Sect disciples, whose eyes gleamed with interest.  

If not for propriety, they would have thrown themselves at the corpse for closer inspection.  

The Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse was undeniably eye-catching, though the mid-grade magical artifacts in each of its six arms somewhat diminished its grandeur.  

The two Profound Nether Sect disciples couldn't help but wonder—who was the real Profound Nether Sect disciple here? This corpse puppet was unmistakably refined using the 'Profound Nether Corpse Refining Method'.  

There was no way they could be mistaken—they themselves had studied the same technique.  

"Wait, Junior Brother Li, did you say you're going to *move* the 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation'?" He Chuan suddenly asked, catching the key point in Li Shiming's words.  

The other cultivators snapped out of their awe and turned to Li Shiming for confirmation.  

Moving a formation while maintaining its operation was an extremely complex task, requiring vast calculations. Few formation masters were willing to attempt it, as the slightest mistake could lead to embarrassment—or worse, the formation collapsing outright.  

"Yes. The 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation' can move at the cost of a 30% reduction in defensive power. It won't be fast, so let's first agree on a target to focus our attacks and then launch a surprise assault!" Li Shiming nodded.  

Though the fighting had paused, the distance between the two sides was only about a hundred meters—close enough for long-range spells and even some magical artifacts to pose a threat.  

However, at this range, the Northern Shu Qi Refining cultivators still had enough time to react to any attacks.  

The Northern Shu cultivators were also discussing battle strategies, trying to figure out how to break the 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation'.  

"The three of us will attack the third from the left!" one of the seven-sect cultivators said firmly.  

"The three of us will target the one holding the horsetail whisk!" another added.  

Having fought the Northern Shu cultivators before, they knew it took at least three of them working together—with at least one using a trump card—to inflict damage.  

They split into teams of three, leaving one team with only two members and Li Shiming alone.  

No one made demands of Li Shiming, as his task—moving the formation—was already heavy enough.  

The seven-sect cultivators adjusted their positions and began preparing their time-consuming techniques in advance.  

In truth, moving the formation wasn't as difficult as they imagined. IBMz15 had already analyzed the surrounding environment, and with the data it provided, relocating the formation merely required repositioning the array flags logically.  

Li Shiming activated his spiritual sense and Levitation Art, needing to move all eighteen array flags simultaneously.  

The formation trembled slightly before expanding forward by several dozen meters.  

With the flags repositioned, the 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation' now consisted of two interconnected sub-formations.  

The seven-sect cultivators, already prepared, launched their attacks. The sudden advance of the formation caught the Northern Shu cultivators off guard.  

Under the concentrated assault, two Northern Shu cultivators died instantly, while two others barely escaped with injuries.  

Li Shiming sighed inwardly. Even in such a situation, the Northern Shu cultivators could still evade, proving the strength of their defensive treasures.  

However, he wasn't overly concerned. Defensive treasures usable by Qi Refining cultivators were typically one-time consumables.  

Most were created by powerful cultivators sealing their defensive spells into artifacts, allowing them to withstand attacks beyond the Qi Refining stage—but only once.  

Sustaining repeated attacks above one's level without consequence was impossible.  

This brief skirmish ended with the seven-sect cultivators gaining the upper hand, reversing the numerical advantage in an instant.  

The seven-sect side expended four trump cards, while the Northern Shu side lost several defensive treasures.  

Now, it was twelve seven-sect cultivators against eleven Northern Shu cultivators—two of whom were seriously injured.  

The two Profound Nether Sect disciples glared fiercely, about to send their own corpse puppets out for a suicidal attack, when Li Shiming's Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse struck first.  

Li Shiming targeted the two heavily injured Northern Shu cultivators.  

He withdrew the rear array flags and repositioned them, closing the distance once more.  

The six mid-grade Gatlings in the corpse puppet's hands roared to life, each firing an average of thirty ice-crystal bullets per second—every shot equivalent to a late Qi Refining cultivator's strike.  

For any Qi Refining cultivator present, blocking a single attack was manageable. But when the number escalated to one hundred and eighty per second, quantity transformed into quality.  

No matter how strong a Qi Refining cultivator was, they were still at the Qi Refining stage. Unless they had Baili Jinyan's freakish physique—forged from Golden Core-grade materials—they couldn't ignore such an onslaught.  

The two injured Northern Shu cultivators had their defenses shattered instantly. They tried to evade, but the barrage was too overwhelming.  

Within a single breath, both were dead.  

The Bronze Corpse didn't stop. Its six Gatlings swiveled toward another Northern Shu cultivator still within range.  

Two breaths later, the cultivator's top-grade defensive artifact and several talismans were obliterated.  

Only by sacrificing these and suffering injuries did the cultivator manage to retreat beyond the Gatlings' range.  

The expressions of all cultivators—friend and foe alike—changed drastically. If they had been amazed by the Bronze Corpse's uniqueness earlier, they were now terrified of the Gatlings.  

They realized they had underestimated the true threat—the mid-grade Gatlings were the real nightmare.  

In the hands of a Qi Refining cultivator, the Gatling was a divine weapon. Its relentless barrage of late Qi Refining attacks made defense impossible.  

The Northern Shu cultivators also recognized the deadly synergy between the formation, the Bronze Corpse, and the Gatlings.  

To attack the Bronze Corpse, they had to break the formation. But to break the formation, they had to get close—only to be met with the Gatlings' fire.  

It was an inescapable loop.  

Compounding the problem was the confined battlefield, leaving little room to maneuver without risking entrapment.  

They couldn't retreat either—leaving meant surrender.  

Neither side had the authority to concede. This was a battle between two major powers—victory or death.  

"Brothers, cover me!" one of the Northern Shu cultivators—clearly of higher status, likely backed by a Golden Core elder—shouted.  

The others immediately understood and unleashed their strongest attacks to shield him.  

Mist and other obscuring techniques blocked the seven-sect cultivators' vision.  

But Li Shiming's spiritual sense pierced through the haze, revealing the Northern Shu cultivator kneeling with a Talisman Treasure in hand.  

He recognized it instantly—the 'Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation' would never withstand a Talisman Treasure's strike.  

A Talisman Treasure was a Golden Core cultivator's ultimate gift to their descendants, capable of annihilating even late Foundation Establishment experts.  

Without hesitation, Li Shiming wrapped himself in sword light and shot out of the formation.  

Sword Flight was his fastest short-range movement technique, but it left him completely exposed—defensive artifacts couldn't be used mid-flight.  

Normally, no cultivator would use it in large-scale battles for this very reason.  

His sudden appearance stunned both sides.  

"Stop him!" the Northern Shu cultivators yelled.  

The mist hindered their vision too, making it hard to track Li Shiming's trajectory.  

They could only blanket the area ahead with spells, though their options were limited to avoid hitting their own.
