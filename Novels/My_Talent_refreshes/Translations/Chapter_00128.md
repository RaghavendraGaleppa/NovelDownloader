# Chapter 128: Driving the Formation

Chu Ning, along with the others, arrived at an open space in the direction of the formation-laying area.

He began to observe the others, estimating the approximate numbers. Back at the training ground before entering this Spirit Realm, there were roughly over four hundred people. Now, there were still more than three hundred. It seemed that the losses along the way weren't too significant.

Chu Ning also noticed that most of the lost individuals were among the batch who had entered later with him, those disciples who had broken through to the sixth level of Qi Condensation with the aid of Breakthrough Pills. Nearly half of the last batch of over a hundred people who entered hadn't appeared, likely having met with accidents en route.

Seeing this, Chu Ning inwardly sighed with emotion. "Not everyone is as cautious and fortunate as Shang Zhaoxiang, who managed to avoid dangers all the way, and then just happened to run into me when encountering demonic beasts. For those who had just entered the sixth level of Qi Condensation, encountering a first-tier high-grade demonic beast offered no hope of victory. Even against a powerful first-tier mid-grade demonic beast, a slight carelessness could easily cost them their lives."

While lamenting inwardly, Chu Ning also secretly frowned at the sect's approach. With the vision and cultivation of these Golden Core cultivators in the sect, after roughly understanding the situation within the Spirit Realm, how could they not be aware of such a predicament? The reason for making such a choice was naturally for the sake of the so-called sect's interests.

As Chu Ning was pondering this, not long after, ten Qi Condensation Completion cultivators appeared before everyone. The ten individuals varied in appearance and age. The youngest looked to be only around twenty, while the older ones included a middle-aged man of forty. What slightly chilled Chu Ning's heart was that, aside from three or four individuals whose auras were weaker than Shang Rui's, whom he had met previously, the auras of the rest were close to his own. The aura of the one in the middle was even stronger by a few points. Chu Ning knew this meant that these people had been in the Qi Condensation Completion realm for a considerable time. Or perhaps, these people had already stepped half a foot into the Foundation Establishment stage, only lacking an opportune moment.

As Chu Ning observed them, the oldest and most profound-cultivating among the ten, the middle-aged cultivator, spoke, "Fellow junior brothers, my name is Meng Zhenggong, and I am the sect's designated负责人 (person in charge) in the Spirit Realm. You have all just entered the Spirit Realm, and I'm sure you've already heard some information from your familiar senior and junior brothers. To prevent you from making wild guesses and speculations, today, we will clarify everything for everyone."

Upon hearing Meng Zhenggong's words, the crowd below immediately stirred. After all, everyone might have heard some news from different sources, but not everyone had Chu Ning's experience and understood the situation so clearly. Therefore, everyone was undoubtedly extremely concerned about what Meng Zhenggong was about to say. Even Chu Ning himself was no exception, as the information he had received from Zhuang Yunde did not seem to be entirely complete.

"The reason this place is called the Spirit Realm is because a Spirit Seed was born here. A Spirit Seed, also known as a Heaven and Earth Spirit Seed, is formed from the purest spiritual energy of heaven and earth and possesses extreme sentience. It is said that there is only one Spirit Seed of each attribute in this world. A Spirit Seed cannot be refined, but if a cultivator obtains one, they can absorb its spiritual energy and comprehend the Grand Dao of Heaven and Earth through it. If a Golden Core stage cultivator can gain enlightenment from it, they will have a great chance of entering the Nascent Soul stage. And if a Nascent Soul stage cultivator obtains it, they can not only greatly improve their cultivation but even reaching the Spirit Transformation stage is not impossible."

Meng Zhenggong's words caused an uproar below, and Chu Ning inwardly sighed. This so-called Spirit Seed actually possessed such miraculous effects, no wonder both the Azure Stream Sect and the Yin Devil Sect were so determined to acquire it. This was indeed too tempting for the Azure Stream Sect's Sect Master and the several elders.

Sure enough, Meng Zhenggong immediately continued, his voice tinged with excitement, "Among our seven major sects in the Azure Gorge Mountain Range, currently, none possess a Nascent Soul stage cultivator. If our Azure Stream Sect can obtain this Spirit Seed, a Nascent Soul stage cultivator will emerge, and we will instantly become the foremost great sect in the Azure Gorge Mountain Range. And we will become meritorious officials of the Azure Stream Sect, whose names will be passed down through the ages!"

"Whoa!"

As Meng Zhenggong's words fell, the scene immediately erupted in a clamor. Many faces showed unusual expressions.

"Nascent Soul cultivator."

"The foremost great sect of Azure Stream Sect."

...

Amidst the uproar, Meng Zhenggong continued, "Moreover, as the ones driving the formation, we are not without rewards..."

Hearing this, Chu Ning knew that the other party was about to talk about the Spirit Resonance Qi that Zhuang Yunde had mentioned. And indeed, Meng Zhenggong then used highly evocative language to describe the effects of the Spirit Resonance Qi. Although Spirit Seeds had attributes, this Spirit Resonance Qi did not. It was more like the accumulation of heaven and earth spiritual energy when the spiritual resonance erupted, so anyone, regardless of what cultivation technique they practiced, could benefit from it. Marrow cleansing and bone transformation, talent enhancement... almost everyone who obtained Spirit Resonance Qi could improve their cultivation and greatly increase their success rate in Foundation Establishment.

As Meng Zhenggong spoke these words, Chu Ning slightly turned his head, observing the varying expressions of the crowd: some were excited and agitated, others were puzzled and bewildered. But in the eyes of most, a fervent glow flickered. Chu Ning, observing coldly, inwardly sneered when he saw that Meng Zhenggong did not continue to explain how many people would die when the spiritual resonance erupted.

However, Meng Zhenggong's next words instantly made Chu Ning's expression extremely solemn. "After years of continuously driving this formation, three months ago, we finally forced the Spirit Seed to appear and confirmed it to be a Wood Spirit Seed. This time, the sect arranged for you junior brothers who cultivate wood-attribute techniques to come in, precisely to force that Wood Spirit Seed to fully manifest. What we didn't explain to you earlier, junior brothers, is that to avoid any delays, everyone will now directly enter the formation-laying area and replace the others to drive the formation."

Enter the formation-laying area now? Hearing Meng Zhenggong's words, Chu Ning and many others wore expressions of shock. After all, what he had heard from Zhuang Yunde was completely different from what Meng Zhenggong was saying now. Just two days ago, everyone was still preparing for a long-term operation.

"So, I don't have to wait three to five years? And there's no time to adapt or understand, I have to go activate the formation directly?"

Chu Ning was greatly surprised by Meng Zhenggong's sudden arrangement. He wondered why there was such a sudden attack. Could it be because of the Yin Devil Sect? Since he had been in the Spirit Realm for two days, Chu Ning believed that Tan Zhang should have found an opportunity to inform Meng Zhenggong and the other responsible parties about the Yin Devil Sect's infiltration. However, the sect seemed to be taking no action at all. He didn't know whether Meng Zhenggong and the others didn't know how to identify the infiltrators, making it difficult to act, or if there were other arrangements. Of course, these were not matters for Chu Ning to worry about right now.

After Meng Zhenggong briefly explained these matters to the crowd, he organized another batch of people to come in. This batch was larger than Chu Ning's group, with nearly five hundred people. For a time, there were nearly eight hundred Qi Condensation disciples gathered in the area. Most of the faces of the newly arrived individuals were unfamiliar; Chu Ning guessed they were wood-attribute cultivators who had entered earlier and remained here.

Indeed, the next moment, Chu Ning heard Meng Zhenggong's voice sound again. "Now, all disciples cultivating wood-attribute techniques here have gathered. Next, we will proceed to the location where the Qiankun Five Elements Formation is laid out. We will replace our fellow disciples who cultivate other attribute techniques. This activation of the formation is critically important, and everyone must follow instructions and exert their full power..."

Speaking of this, Meng Zhenggong's gaze swept over the more than 800 people. "If anyone makes a mistake midway, don't blame us for being impolite." As he said this, Meng Zhenggong's voice turned a few shades colder. This made everyone look at each other, though it was primarily the newcomers whose expressions were more complex. Most of the disciples who had already been in the Spirit Realm for a while looked normal, seemingly already psychologically prepared.

"There's one more thing to emphasize: this time, when driving the formation, two people will take turns. There will be no one else to replace you for a short period. The sect has specially prepared ample Spirit Recovery Pills for everyone. If you feel your Dharma power is nearing depletion, you must immediately hand over and switch, and take a Spirit Recovery Pill to quickly restore your Dharma power, lest an accident occurs due to Dharma power exhaustion."

With that, Meng Zhenggong took out a jade slip from his hand and said, "Next, I will call out names to divide you into groups. Once grouped, our ten people will lead each group into the formation-laying area."

Meng Zhenggong called out names one by one, and the 800 people were divided into four groups. A small portion, about thirty people, were not called, including some of those disciples who had temporarily broken through to the sixth level. But there were also some disciples at the seventh and eighth levels of Qi Condensation, and even several at the ninth level and Qi Condensation Completion. Chu Ning didn't know why.

Chu Ning was assigned to the third group, and to his slight surprise, Zhuang Yunde was also in the same group. However, in the specific order of their group numbers, they were a few apart. As they walked out, the two exchanged glances, a silent communication. As for the other people Chu Ning knew, none were assigned to his group. Tan Zhang was in Group One, Mu Ling in Group Four, and Shang Zhaoxiang and Lin Lan were both in Group Two. Shang Zhaoxiang had also just broken through from the fifth to the sixth level of Qi Condensation, yet he was chosen; Chu Ning didn't know whether to call it luck or misfortune.

Chu Ning then observed the situation of each group, finding that the realm distribution was quite even, generally pairing high-level disciples with low-level ones. Clearly, Meng Zhenggong and the others were well aware of everyone's cultivation realms. Chu Ning followed the people of the third group. The two Qi Condensation Completion cultivators leading them were a thirty-something year old cultivator surnamed Yan, who seemed taciturn, and a twenty-six or seven year old cultivator surnamed Liu, who chatted with everyone but also carried a hint of arrogance in his demeanor.

Along with a Qi Condensation (9th level) disciple, the three checked everyone's identity one by one, then directly handed each person a jade bottle much larger than the usual ones for pills. When Chu Ning opened it for a quick look, he couldn't help but be surprised. This larger jade bottle actually contained 100 Spirit Recovery Pills.

"Is this preparing for a prolonged war of attrition?" Chu Ning sighed inwardly, naturally not saying much. He then followed the cultivator surnamed Yan, leaving the residential area and heading towards the formation-laying grounds. Seizing this opportunity, Chu Ning also sent a voice transmission to Zhuang Yunde, asking, "Senior Brother Zhuang, if this Spirit Resonance erupts, can we use Dharma artifacts or talismans to defend against it?" This was a crucial question that Chu Ning had originally intended to clarify during his stay here. However, to his surprise, they were heading to the formation-laying grounds so quickly.

"Yes," Zhuang Yunde's affirmative reply came through, and Chu Ning slightly relaxed. In terms of defensive capabilities, he was quite good among everyone present.

He silently followed the crowd forward. "The spiritual energy density here..." As they walked towards the formation-laying grounds, Chu Ning noticed that the spiritual energy density was continuously increasing, which greatly astonished him. After walking for about a li, when everyone arrived before a mountain peak, the spiritual energy density was already more than twice what it had been. The entire mountain peak was shrouded in white mist, making it difficult to see clearly. Even with Chu Ning's outstanding Divine Sense, looking at the mountain peak ahead, he still had a feeling of not being able to see through it. Chu Ning naturally didn't use his Divine Sense to probe, but simply watched the leader who had already stopped.

At this moment, the cultivator surnamed Yan took out a yellow flag from his hand. As he injected Dharma power, the flag immediately glowed yellow. Then, the cultivator surnamed Yan pointed at the white mist in front of everyone. Immediately, the white mist dispersed, revealing a passage wide enough for one person to pass through.

"So it's a formation," Chu Ning realized at this point. The white mist earlier wasn't entirely due to the dense spiritual energy; rather, there was a formation concealing it, preventing everyone from seeing clearly.

"Everyone, enter," the cultivator surnamed Yan said. The young cultivator surnamed Liu was the first to step inside. Chu Ning and the others then filed in one by one under the gaze of the cultivator surnamed Yan. Passing through the white mist tunnel and entering, the scene inside immediately astonished everyone.

They found themselves on a not-so-tall mountain peak. In front of them, two hundred figures sat in meditation. These two hundred people were seated beside one hundred stone pillars, each about the size of a bowl's mouth. Half of them were sitting cross-legged in meditation. The other half had their hands pressed against the stone pillars in front of them, their Dharma power surging, evidently channeling it into the pillars.

In front of these two hundred people, a crimson light, a convergence of Dharma power, shot into the air. Simultaneously, there were also four other lights of different colors: blue, yellow, white, and gold. After these five lights converged, they plunged into a hollow surrounded by five mountain peaks. There, subtle flowing light flickered, but Chu Ning and the others couldn't see it clearly.

"Next, I'll speak, and you listen. Do not make any noise, lest you disturb our fellow senior and junior brothers ahead who are casting the formation," the cultivator surnamed Liu turned to Chu Ning and the others and instructed. "Many of you have already driven the wood-attribute formation on another mountain peak before, and it's the same as the wood-attribute formations you've driven. According to the sequence, two people will form a team responsible for one stone pillar. All you need to do is inject your Dharma power into the stone pillar. The newcomers will observe from the side and follow suit later."

The cultivator surnamed Liu continued with a serious expression, "Because we will be switching directly from the five-element attributes to pure wood attribute in a moment, it is imperative that everyone obeys the unified command. The fellow senior and junior brothers cultivating fire-attribute techniques who are currently casting spells must also do the same; do not stop channeling Dharma power until commanded."

After the cultivator surnamed Liu finished, he asked the crowd if they understood. Once everyone nodded, he continued, "Alright, those who are currently meditating can now withdraw. The first team of wood-attribute cultivators, step forward and prepare."

As the cultivator surnamed Liu spoke, those who were originally sitting and meditating left, and immediately over a hundred people stepped forward. These were all individuals like Zhuang Yunde, who had entered the Spirit Realm earlier and had already driven the formation. However, the cultivator surnamed Liu did not immediately order them to take over. They waited for about a quarter of an hour.

Then, the hitherto silent cultivator surnamed Yan suddenly spoke, "Wood-attribute cultivators, prepare. Listen for my command to take over." As the cultivator surnamed Yan spoke, Zhuang Yunde and the others extended their palms, approaching the stone pillars. After waiting for a few more breaths, the cultivator surnamed Yan let out a low shout.

"Three, two, one, switch!"

As these words were spoken, one hundred wood-attribute cultivators quickly placed their palms on the stone pillars. The fire-attribute cultivators, who were previously channeling their power, immediately withdrew their hands. The next moment, the crimson light in the air flashed, instantly turning into a blue light. At the same time, the other white, yellow, and gold lights also changed color to blue. Only the initial blue light remained unchanged.

The five blue lights converged in the air into a thick blue light pillar, plunging directly into the ground. For a moment, flowing light flickered beneath the ground. However, there wasn't much movement; the flowing light beneath the ground seemed like a black hole, continuously devouring the Dharma power light pillar.

"Fire-attribute cultivators can now withdraw. Remaining wood-attribute cultivators, move to the standby positions," the cultivator surnamed Liu said again. The fire-attribute cultivators who had just withdrawn their Dharma power now retreated to the rear. Their faces all showed a hint of surprise. However, under the guidance of the ninth-level Qi Condensation disciple, everyone quickly withdrew from the formation. Chu Ning and the others, following the order, sat cross-legged beside the stone pillars.

Chu Ning's partner was a ninth-level Qi Condensation disciple named Wang Weizhong, who was not tall and had a dark complexion. The two had a brief exchange earlier, and Chu Ning learned that Wang Weizhong was a disciple from the Spirit Beast Stable. Seeing that Wang Weizhong's complexion was relatively relaxed after injecting his Dharma power, Chu Ning had a rough estimate of the Dharma power consumption.

Then, Chu Ning's gaze somewhat curiously examined the several converging blue lights. "This Qiankun Five Elements Formation can not only gather the power of the five elements but also converge Dharma power of the same attribute, which is quite miraculous." Chu Ning had always known that the seven major sects in the Azure Gorge Mountain Range were not proficient in formations, but after seeing this formation, Chu Ning felt that if this formation was indeed laid out by the Azure Stream Sect, then setting up a teleportation formation should not be difficult. He wondered why they hadn't.

Immediately, Chu Ning's gaze unconsciously fell upon the flowing light beneath the thick blue light pillar. "If nothing unexpected happens, that should be the location of the Wood Spirit Seed. Is it to force it to manifest by continuously gathering Dharma power and spiritual energy?" Chu Ning vaguely guessed the purpose of laying out this formation, but he also had some doubts in his heart: what would happen after the Spirit Seed manifested? How could he and the others here obtain it? The sect clearly had a backup plan, but he didn't know what it was. Moreover... Chu Ning's gaze inadvertently swept to the left.
