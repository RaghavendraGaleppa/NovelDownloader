# Chapter 15: Dual Cultivation of Magic and Body  

Wei Qian and Li Guchen rode swiftly on their horses, quickly leaving the auction site behind as they galloped toward the Misty Ridge Mountains.  

However, as they rode, they soon noticed two "tails" following them.  

"Brother Qian, there are two people following us," Li Guchen said nervously to Wei Qian.  

"I noticed too," Wei Qian replied.  

Anyone who dared to chase them now must be strong and confident in their abilities.  

"Guchen, did Elder Wanqing give you anything before you left?" Wei Qian asked.  

Even though he was poor, Wei Qian had gone out of his way to buy talismans to enhance his survival chances before attending the auction. Li Guchen, the son of a wealthy family elder, surely wouldn’t have been sent out empty-handed.  

Without suspicion, Li Guchen answered honestly, "He gave me six first-grade high-tier talismans, some healing and mana-recovery pills, and a 'Minor Thunder Bomb.' But I already used two talismans when someone tried to attack me earlier."  

The first-grade high-tier talismans didn’t surprise Wei Qian—he wouldn’t have been shocked even if Li Wanqing had given Li Guchen a second-grade talisman equivalent to a strike from a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

But the mention of the "Minor Thunder Bomb" truly startled Wei Qian.  

He had only heard of the "Thunder Bomb," a one-time-use artifact infused with a bolt of lightning capable of killing even a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Even if the "Minor Thunder Bomb" was a lesser version, it could undoubtedly obliterate a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.  

"Head toward that deep valley ahead!" Wei Qian pointed. "We’ll lure them there and cut off those tails!"  

The two adjusted their course, urging their horses toward the valley.  

"Big Brother, those brats are trying to escape!" the dark, burly man said.  

The leader took out a leaf-shaped artifact from his storage pouch, infused it with spiritual energy, and expanded it.  

"Get on!"  

The two brothers boarded the flying leaf artifact and gave chase, no longer concealing their murderous intent.  

"Whoa—!"  

Forcing their horses to a halt, Wei Qian and Li Guchen dismounted and turned to face the pursuing bandit brothers.  

"If you keep chasing us, don’t blame us for killing you without mercy," Wei Qian warned. If they could avoid a fight, that would be ideal.  

Without hesitation, Li Guchen activated a first-grade high-tier "Wind Blade Talisman," sending a three-foot-wide blade of wind slashing toward the bandits.  

At the same time, Wei Qian signaled Li Guchen to take out the Minor Thunder Bomb and aim it at the two.  

The bandit brothers hastily leaped off their flying artifact and summoned a shield to block the incoming wind blade.  

*Sssshhk!* The wind blade easily sliced through the low-tier shield, its momentum only slightly weakened as it continued forward.  

The leader hadn’t expected the shield to fully stop the attack—it was only meant to buy time.  

His burly, fifth-level Qi Refining brother then summoned a mirror artifact, intercepting the wind blade’s path.  

The mirror shattered, but it fulfilled its purpose, dissipating the weakened wind blade.  

But the real shock came when the two bandits saw what Li Guchen was holding.  

"A Minor Thunder Bomb!" they exclaimed in recognition.  

"Care to test its power?" Wei Qian taunted, summoning his own hidden artifact behind his back.  

The bandit brothers exchanged glances, their expressions bitter and unwilling. But their opportunistic greed had already waned significantly.  

There was no helping it—that was a bomb capable of killing a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator!  

Even bandits needed to know who they could and couldn’t afford to provoke.  

Seeing their hesitation and retreat, Wei Qian inwardly sighed in relief. Avoiding a life-or-death battle was for the best.  

Li Guchen also relaxed.  

Heaven knew he had no experience in life-and-death struggles—he had been panicking the whole time.  

The bandit brothers had already retreated dozens of steps when, just as Wei Qian thought the matter was over, an unexpected voice boomed from the depths of the valley:  

"Good, good. I’ve been waiting here for two days, and finally, a big fish shows up."  

A towering nine-foot-tall man emerged barefoot from the valley.  

The moment the bandit brothers saw him, their faces paled.  

"Bloodhand Fiend!"  

The name alone made Wei Qian’s expression darken.  

He didn’t know who this "Bloodhand Fiend" was, but anyone with such a title was undoubtedly formidable.  

"I’m wanted by the Flowing Cloud Sect, so I couldn’t go to the auction to pick my prey," the giant said casually, completely unfazed by the Minor Thunder Bomb in Li Guchen’s hand.  

"Had to resort to this crude method—lying in wait. Didn’t expect to catch something so soon."  

Noticing the man’s talkative nature, Wei Qian decided to probe further. "Aren’t you afraid of this Minor Thunder Bomb?"  

"Hahaha!" The giant laughed heartily before unleashing his aura—revealing his cultivation level: ninth-level Qi Refining!  

Even more terrifying, he tore off his upper robe, exposing a scorched scar on his chest.  

"Back when my *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art* wasn’t perfected, I took a Minor Thunder Bomb to the chest and almost died," he sneered.  

"Today, I’d like to see how it feels again!"  

Dual cultivation—magic and body!  

A ninth-level Qi Refining mage with a perfected tempered physique. No wonder he was so confident.  

With his strength, he was practically unrivaled below the Foundation Establishment realm.  

The two bandit brothers, seeing the giant, immediately turned tail and fled. The man didn’t stop them.  

But Wei Qian knew—if he and Li Guchen so much as twitched to escape, this monster would strike without hesitation.  

"Guchen, throw the bomb in three breaths!" Wei Qian whispered urgently.  

The next moment, he unleashed his full power—a streak of black light shot toward the giant’s ankle before his body-tempering technique could fully activate!  

"Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering!" the giant roared, hastily circulating his defensive technique.  

He was arrogant, not stupid.  

But Wei Qian’s sudden attack had given them one precious opportunity—his strike landed before the giant’s defense was complete!
