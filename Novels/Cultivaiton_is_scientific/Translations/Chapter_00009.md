# Chapter 9: Explosion  

"He's been here for a long time!" Shi Ximing sensed the signal from the intermediate tracking talisman. Based on the intensity of the aura, he concluded.  

Before him stood a rock garden, a relatively secluded spot in the courtyard.  

After a while, a look of confusion appeared on his face.  

He could only sense the aura of Chief Escort Wang lingering here but detected no traces of him leaving.  

Logically, Chief Escort Wang should still be here.  

Even if Chief Escort Wang had died and his body had been moved, there should still be traces of his aura left behind.  

Yet, according to the aura here, it was as if Chief Escort Wang had stayed for two days before vanishing into thin air.  

Although Shi Ximing was deeply puzzled, his primary goal wasn’t to find Chief Escort Wang but to locate that particular item.  

With a wave of his hand, a green light flickered.  

Life in the cultivation world hadn’t been kind to him, but he did have his specialties—his greatest skill was in plant cultivation.  

This was a garden, filled with all kinds of flowers and plants.  

By channeling his wood spiritual energy, he could easily sense the condition of the surrounding vegetation.  

This method was far more convenient than Li Shiming’s analysis using the large-scale server IBM z15. In just moments, a smile appeared on his face.  

"Found it!" He arrived at the spot where the wooden box was buried.  

The aura of a small patch of grass here was off. Under the influence of his wood spiritual energy, this small area stood out like a beacon in the night.  

He dug open the surface soil and uncovered the wooden box.  

Upon seeing the box, his smile widened.  

Though the box appeared ordinary, the patterns on it were commonly used in the cultivation world to isolate auras.  

Whatever was inside this box was definitely not something that belonged in the mortal world.  

He didn’t take any protective measures. For one, this was the mortal world—any hidden mechanisms in such a small box would have limited power, and as a third-level Qi Refining cultivator, he was immune to mundane poisons. Secondly, he was poor.  

A single primary defense talisman was worth three to four attack talismans, and he simply couldn’t afford to waste them.  

When he opened the box, he found it filled with a liquid resembling water. At the same time, he noticed a flash of white powder ignite as soon as the box was opened.  

Had Shi Ximing known what was inside the box, he would have fled as far as possible, sparing no expense in using every defense talisman he had.  

But due to the difference in knowledge systems, he had no understanding of the liquid or the white powder inside the box.  

He assumed this was a trick set up by Chief Escort Wang—a failsafe to destroy the contents if the box fell into the wrong hands.  

In his urgency, he immediately tried to retrieve the visible items from the box.  

He had spotted two books inside, made from materials commonly used in the cultivation world for texts that could remain intact for millennia without decay.  

Li Shiming had filled the box with nitroglycerin, while the white substance was white phosphorus.  

The box, crafted with unknown techniques, had excellent sealing properties.  

When Li Shiming had arrived earlier, he had placed some nitroglycerin from his server room space into the box, sealed it, and then extracted the excess air inside, transferring it back into the server room space. He then sprinkled a bit of white phosphorus onto the surface of the nitroglycerin inside the box.  

Nitroglycerin was an extremely volatile explosive—even the slightest disturbance could set it off.  

White phosphorus, upon contact with air, would ignite.  

The result of white phosphorus burning atop nitroglycerin was exactly what Shi Ximing experienced—right before his eyes.  

The amount of nitroglycerin was substantial—approximately one kilogram.  

One kilogram of nitroglycerin could produce 715 liters of gaseous matter while releasing around 3,980 joules of heat energy, generating a pressure of about 9000×10^5 pascals.  

An explosion of this magnitude occurring right in front of him would have been devastating. Even if Shi Ximing had used a defense talisman, a primary-level one would have been utterly useless, and even an intermediate-level one would have offered limited protection.  

In the instant the explosion occurred, Shi Ximing realized what was happening—but it was already too late.  

"Which fellow cultivator set this trap? Why is there no trace of spiritual energy?"  

With this final thought, his body was torn apart by the terrifying blast.  

The explosion didn’t just kill Shi Ximing—it also cleared a five-meter radius around the epicenter. The unfortunate rock garden was reduced to scattered debris.  

In his small study, Li Shiming felt the entire room tremble. The deafening explosion left his ears ringing.  

"Young Master!" Siqin, his maid, screamed from outside, calling out for him in panic.  

In Siqin’s heart, her young master was her entire world.  

"Siqin, don’t be afraid. I’ll go see what happened," Li Shiming reassured her.  

"Young Master, don’t go! Wait for the guards!" Siqin grabbed his sleeve, pleading.  

"Don’t worry, I’ll be fine," Li Shiming said, patting her head.  

Stepping out of the courtyard, he saw the devastation. Though the explosion had occurred in the garden, the debris had scattered far and wide.  

Many plants had been damaged by the flying rocks, and dust hung in the air like a thick gray fog.  

He knew immediately that the only way his hidden trap could have been triggered was if someone had discovered the wooden box.  

The location had been meticulously concealed, and given that it was in the magistrate’s rear garden, even if ordinary people knew it was there, they wouldn’t have been able to find it without making noise.  

The trap had been set specifically for the cultivator. It was likely that the one caught in the explosion was that very person.  

As for whether the cultivator had survived, the sheer scale of the destruction was answer enough.  

If anyone could live through an explosion of that magnitude, Li Shiming would have doubted whether they were human at all.  

By now, the magistrate’s office, along with the guards and servants from the rear courtyard, were rushing toward the garden in chaos.  

An incident of this scale in the magistrate’s garden was far more serious than the murder of the thirty-some people at the Weiyuan Escort Agency.  

Unlike the others who were scrambling around aimlessly, Li Shiming knew exactly where the explosion had originated. He quickly made his way to the rock garden.  

The closer he got, the more horrified he became at the sheer power of the explosion he had engineered.  

A single box filled with nitroglycerin had caused such devastation—the rock garden was now a barren crater, one meter deep, with all surrounding vegetation reduced to fragments.  

Li Shiming’s gaze sharpened as he spotted scattered flesh and blood on the ground—remnants of a body torn apart by the blast.  

The sight brought him relief. No matter the collateral damage, as long as the cultivator was dead, the biggest threat had been eliminated.  

Then he noticed a leather pouch lying on the ground. Despite the massive explosion, it remained completely intact.  

Li Shiming picked it up. This pouch must have belonged to the cultivator.
