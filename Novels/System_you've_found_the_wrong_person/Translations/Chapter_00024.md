# Chapter 24: The New Dou Chui

Outside the main gates of Chen Family Fortress.

Iron Spear Wang stood motionless like a statue, indifferent to the comings and goings of martial artists through the wide-open fortress gates. His sole mission was to keep watch over Firecloud Zhenren—everything else was meaningless and beyond his responsibility.

The current struggle between both sides over military provisions had become increasingly frequent, but this was merely the beginning. It hadn't yet escalated to the point where grandmasters would personally enter the fray in a bloody battle.

His cold eyes remained fixed on Firecloud Zhenren.

Firecloud Zhenren gazed into the distance, his greatcoat fluttering in the wind. He spoke to Wang Tianhe, who stood nearby slurping noodles from a bowl: "The Dragonflies were just the first wave. Though Chen Family Fortress is currently undermanned, they can still muster another Xiantian Zhenjing martial artist without issue."

"As long as the Dragonflies hold out for a while, when the second Xiantian Zhenjing expert arrives—"

"Even if this Dou Changsheng has truly mastered your Wang Clan's teachings, he'll still be no match."

Firecloud Zhenren chuckled coldly, then suddenly seemed to remember something and slapped his forehead. "Ah, how forgetful of me."

"That Dou Changsheng isn't actually from your Wang Clan, so naturally your esteemed elder wouldn't intervene."

"In that case, this Dou Changsheng can only die."

Wang Tianhe drained the last of his broth, set the bowl down, and replied, "What are you scheming now, Little Yun?"

"Of course Dou Changsheng isn't from the Wang Clan."

"I came here solely to fulfill my duty—to honor my promise to the Prime Minister and His Majesty."

"I absolutely cannot allow any Wang Clan disciple to be involved. Now that someone dares impersonate a Wang clansman, as the family head, it's my responsibility to take action."

"You've sent two Xiantian Zhenjing experts, but in my opinion, their strength is still insufficient."

"Whoever dares impersonate a Wang clansman must have significant backing. Let this old man handle it personally—I'll capture the impostor and resolve this problem for you."

Firecloud Zhenren abruptly turned, his cold gaze boring into Wang Tianhe as he said solemnly, "So the esteemed elder plans to go kill him?"

"Will you be delivering Dou Changsheng's corpse to this junior?"

Wang Tianhe sighed. "Little Yun, you're overthinking things."

"Dou Changsheng must have powerful backers. As the Wang Clan head, of course I need to uncover the mastermind behind this scheme against our clan."

"Dou Changsheng absolutely cannot die—he must be taken alive."

"I'll lock him in the dungeon, make him scream in agony every day, wishing for death but unable to find it."

"This will serve as a lesson to all—this is the price of offending the Wang Clan."

Firecloud Zhenren said coldly, "More likely you'll take him back to the Wang Clan and restore his original name."

Wang Tianhe shook his head. "Little Yun, you misunderstand this old man too deeply."

"Enough of this pointless talk."

"Bring me another bowl of noodles—I'll eat it when I return."

Firecloud Zhenren extended an arm to block Wang Tianhe's path, speaking calmly, "This junior cannot stop the esteemed elder, but you should consider carefully."

"Once you go, there will be no turning back."

"The Xiangzhou Wang Clan's thousand-year legacy didn't come easily."

"I urge the esteemed elder to think twice."

Wang Tianhe lightly brushed aside Firecloud Zhenren's arm with a pat and strode forward. Just as he reached the gate, he saw the Xiantian Zhenjing expert who should have gone to reinforce the others now scrambling back in disarray alongside another Xiantian expert.

Wang Tianhe stopped in his tracks at the fortress gate, watching as the two practically crawled to kneel before Firecloud Zhenren.

He couldn't help but laugh, all thoughts of leaving forgotten as he stood beside Firecloud Zhenren with amused interest. Pointing at Feng Zhongyi, he said, "I remember you."

"Weren't you supposed to reinforce that fellow—what was his name? Dragonfly?"

"Why have you come back alone?"

Wang Tianhe already understood most of the situation from this scene—as did Firecloud Zhenren—but opportunities to see the younger man humiliated were rare.

This "Little Yun" wasn't the same respectful youth who used to address him as "esteemed elder" in reverent tones.

Now ranked on the Earth List, a dominant figure across nations.

Not nearly as endearing as before.

Firecloud Zhenren's face darkened as if dripping with water, but he didn't stop them. Their failure meant something had gone wrong, and he wanted details.

Most importantly, that old scoundrel Wang Tianhe had no sense of propriety.

If not satisfied, who knew what trouble he'd stir up?

The memories of past suffering at his hands remained fresh.

If not for the death of Wang Tianhe's elder brother at the hands of Southern Chen's Demon Master, the respectable Wang Clan would never have let this shameless old man become family head.

Feng Zhongyi dared not look directly at Firecloud Zhenren, stealing only furtive glances before his gaze shifted to Wang Tianhe. At first sight of the man, Feng Zhongyi immediately pressed his forehead to the dirt, his heart pounding wildly as if trying to escape his chest.

Wang Tianhe was no obscure figure—especially after Dou Changsheng's appearance, Feng Zhongyi had become hyper-aware of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan, collecting extensive information about them.

He recognized instantly that this was the Wang Clan head.

As expected.

Dou Changsheng had significant backing.

Otherwise, why would such a prominent figure come all the way from Xiangzhou to the northern borders?

Truly, when gods battle, mortals suffer.

Feng Zhongyi carefully composed his words before speaking: "This subordinate was ordered to reinforce, but my horse was slow, so I arrived too late."

"I witnessed with my own eyes as Lord Dragonfly was slain by Dou Changsheng with a single sword stroke."

"Against anyone, just one sword."

"Dou Changsheng's strength is unfathomable—Xiantian Zhenjing isn't his limit."

"His three-zhang sword energy was invincible, especially when one sword stroke split into eight—enough to shake heaven and earth, make ghosts and gods weep."

"The failure of this reinforcement mission isn't this subordinate's fault—Dou Changsheng was simply too powerful."

"On the return journey, I reflected that Dou Changsheng may appear young, but is likely an ancient monster in truth."

"He's changed his name and altered his appearance."

"Why couldn't he be a martial artist in his thirties pretending to be younger?"

Before Feng Zhongyi could finish, Wang Tianhe interrupted: "Nonsense!"

"I've seen Dou Changsheng with my own eyes—his bone age definitely doesn't exceed twenty."

"A genius born once in a generation, a celestial being descended to earth."

"How dare you slander him? Such a man will undoubtedly reach the Human List and stand above all others."

"A single sword suppressing the entire martial world for a decade."

Firecloud Zhenren suddenly looked up sharply at Wang Tianhe.

Old scoundrel—you've finally revealed your true colors!

Reach the Human List and stand above all?

Suppress the younger generation for ten years?

You want to create another Demon Master in the martial world.

What tremendous ambition.

Wang Tianhe suddenly seemed to realize his slip and quickly corrected: "This is my Wang Clan's direct lineage!"

"Absolutely no relation to Dou Changsheng!"
