# Chapter 523: Failed Golden Core Attempt

A deafening roar of thunder and blinding flashes of lightning were all that remained of the world.

In an instant, the sky above Cold Crow Pass churned with celestial thunder, and countless bolts descended from the nine heavens.

The Great Arhat’s pupils constricted. He barely managed to raise a faint layer of protective Buddha Light before being completely submerged by the endless thunder of the Divine Sky.

A crisp cracking sound echoed continuously. The already fractured Vajra Body of Glazed Light exploded piece by piece. The protective kasaya turned to ash, exposing his scorched, withered flesh to the ravages of the ten thousand thunderbolts.

A look of utter disbelief and horror finally appeared in the Great Arhat’s eyes. He had never imagined that a mere Core Formation cultivator could unleash such a profound technique.

The Great Arhat was blasted out of the sea of lightning, his body reeking of heavy, burnt stench like a torn sack. Without looking back, he transformed into a golden streak and fled the territory of Cold Crow Pass in an instant.

His objective had been achieved. If he didn't leave now, once the other Great True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect reacted, being trapped in their territory would mean he might as well consider reincarnation.

There are lines that must not be crossed.

Since his goal was accomplished, there was no need to linger any longer.

***

Meanwhile, on the Eastern Wasteland battlefield.

The moment the aura of the Dao Fruit's favor abruptly vanished, the atmosphere in the heart of the Eastern Wasteland battlefield, which had been shattered and split asunder, suddenly froze.

On the side of the Primordial Origin Sect, the Qingyuan True Lord’s body, previously enveloped in a hazy, clear "Immortal Palace Clear Qi," trembled violently. The pure Dao intent flowing within its radiance showed a rare hint of disorder.

He sensed with absolute clarity that Chu Chengnan had failed to attain his Dao Fruit.

His face instantly turned ashen. His icy, piercing gaze was fixed tightly on the direction of Cold Crow Pass, his teeth gritted hard.

His eyes were filled with fury.

Chu Chengnan was a pawn he had schemed over for a long time, a crucial piece for his own promotion to the mid-stage of the Golden Core.

The secret pact to use Chu's "Immovable Mountain" Dao Fruit to stabilize the foundation of his own path to the Great Dao was now shattered, and his own path was suddenly fraught with twists.

Boundless regret and rage churned in his chest, but he forcefully suppressed them.

"Amitabha! Karma arises and ceases, a cycle of cause and effect. Benefactor Chu lacked the fortune; it cannot be forced, for it would only create more karmic obstacles."

The Grand Awakening Bodhisattva’s grand Buddha voice rang out at the opportune moment, tinged with a hint of compassion. However, his wizened, wrinkled face held not a shred of sorrow; instead, it was laced with a bit of mockery and delight.

To be honest, if not for his status, he truly wanted to jump up from his lotus throne and dance.

The demonic forces wane while the Dao flourishes. This time, the Bodhisattva Pure Land had gained the upper hand and was destined for great prosperity.

The Qingyuan True Lord said coldly, "Bodhisattva, your methods are truly impressive. With a thousand calculations and ten thousand twists, I never expected your Bodhisattva Pure Land to have a Great Arhat hiding in ambush all this time. I wonder which Bodhisattva reincarnated this is? We should have a good talk about that!"

The Grand Awakening Bodhisattva wore a slight smile on his face.

"Forgive me, True Lord. My unruly disciple stole my spiritual treasure and left, and I never thought he would commit such an act. I shall surely lecture him when he returns."

The Qingyuan True Lord, hearing this, was somewhat infuriated. The Clear Qi of the Immortal Palace around him surged, wanting to transform into a world-shattering attack, but he held back with great effort.

He had lost this game of chess.

He admitted it.

With a cold snort, he turned his gaze to the Pudu True Lord.

This mid-stage Golden Core True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect did not even lift his eyelids, showing not the slightest displeasure at the sect's failure.

He had experienced this too many times. Compared to newly promoted True Lords like Qingyuan, his age was at least tens of thousands of years.

Throughout his life, he had experienced countless rises and falls, victories and defeats.

With a wave of his claw-like hand, the shattered remains of the Heavenly and Earthly Terrestrial Immortal Peach Tree, which Wukong had smashed to pieces, began to gather points of glazing spiritual light.

Broken branches and trunks visibly restored themselves, and the scorched spiritual roots regained their vitality. In just a few breaths, a complete, treasure-glowing, and spiritually rich Immortal Tree once again stood tall on the land of the Eastern Wasteland.

Without a word, the Pudu True Lord swept his gaze over the two True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect suspended in the heavens. His figure, amidst the gentle swaying of the Immortal Tree's leaves and branches, silently vanished like a bubble, without a hint of attachment.

"Hehehe..."

A silver-bell-like laugh, filled with deep-seated irony, rang out, as piercing as an ice pick.

From the Primordial Origin Sect's阵营, the Nine Abyss Mysterious Fiend, Lord Dongming, whose beautiful figure was veiled in black纱, stepped forward gracefully.

The Nine Nether Cold Qi swirling around her condensed into black lotuses, but her gaze was like a poisoned hook, fixed firmly on the rigid back of the Qingyuan True Lord.

She lowered her voice, but each word was clearly transmitted into Qingyuan's ears.

"Senior Brother Qingyuan, what a brilliant scheme, what a grand dream. What a pity, though. The highest mountains in a dream are, in the end, just piles of sand. The taste of celebrating in vain must be... unforgettable, right? I wonder if your glazed Dao Heart is still pure and flawless at this moment?"

Her words were laced with an unspeakable hatred and twisted pleasure, clearly showing a deep-seated grudge between the two. At this moment, she made no effort to hide her schadenfreude.

Seeing the Qingyuan True Lord's Clear Qi churn but ultimately not erupt in response, with only the chill on his back growing heavier, Lord Dongming sneered several times, her form turning into a shadow and vanishing without a trace.

The Qingyuan True Lord was naturally憋着一肚子火. Lord Dongming had always had a rift with him. For her to only speak sarcastic remarks instead of actually striking while the iron was hot was already a matter of poor timing. Otherwise, that madwoman would have drawn her sword and charged at him without hesitation.

For this scheme, he, the Qingyuan True Lord, was the main actor. To invite Lord Dongming, he had paid a considerable price to get her to agree.

Now that the matter had failed, Lord Dongming was naturally happy to watch the show.

The remaining Bodhisattvas of the Bodhisattva Pure Land, who were still locked in combat, saw that the situation was lost and that the two core True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect had already left. They no longer dared to linger.

The Sword Intent of No Return, which pierced through the void from the direction of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, had been retracted, but its sharpness remained, held in check.

They had just fought with the Demonic Sect of Ultimate Darkness. If the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect took up the baton, they would be lucky to escape with their lives, even if they didn't die.

These sword maniacs, who prided themselves on being the leaders of the Righteous Path, were stubborn and eccentric. They naturally looked down upon the禅法 cultivation of the Bodhisattva Pure Land.

One Bodhisattva after another, their Buddhist light surging rapidly, swept up their remaining disciples and followers, transforming into streaks of swift golden meteors. They vanished from the Eastern Wasteland's sky in an instant, afraid that a moment's delay would lock them in the terrifying Sword Intent.

The once noisy and tumultuous battlefield fell into a dead silence in an instant, leaving only the lingering killing intent and the shattered mountains and rivers.

As for the Qingyuan True Lord, who was now alone, he wasn't worried about being targeted by the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

The Kun-Qing Qi Wonder Dao True Method he cultivated was, in terms of escape, something even those sword cultivators couldn't compare to.

The Qingyuan True Lord hung alone in the air, his back desolate.

He slowly retracted his gaze from Cold Crow Pass, took a deep breath, and slowly exhaled, as if trying to forcibly suppress all his churning emotions.

"The path is arduous and long..."

In the end, he paid no mind to the terrified Wukong and his three disciples below.

There was a plan for this. If he were to truly ignore everything and kill this master and his disciples, it was highly likely that the Lord of the Dao of the Bodhisattva Pure Land, the World-Honored One Tathagata, would descend in person, teaching him what it means for a high-level expert to bully the weak, like a max-level god-tier character showing off in a新手村.

With a flick of his sleeve, a hazy immortal light flashed, and his figure silently disappeared into the void, leaving behind only a faint, icy snort that echoed over the desolate land.
