# Chapter 46: Requisition

They were two magnificent horses. Tall and imposing, with glistening coats, they were exceptionally spirited and exuded a formidable aura! This was an aura Ding Rui had never witnessed in any of the Ma Xiu he had encountered before. Ma Wen, whom Ding Rui had previously considered strong and tall, almost his height, now truly seemed like an immature pony beside these two Ma Xiu. Ding Rui could only look up at these two horses. Clearly, these were two adult Ma Xiu.

"Young friend Ding Rui, we've long heard of you. We are Ma Wen's parents. My name is Ma Tu, and she is Ma Yun." Before Ding Rui could even ask, the two Ma Xiu introduced themselves.

"Greetings, esteemed seniors. It is an honor to meet both of you." Ding Rui immediately bowed. Adult Ma Xiu were all powerful individuals.

He had initially intended for them to be used as aids for transportation, but he had overlooked their potential applications on the battlefield. Fortunately, upon discovering these pieces of equipment, the Sect members immediately realized their value. They promptly dispatched someone, accompanied by a decision-making Ma Xiu elder, to discuss the matter with Ding Rui. Within the Sect's territory, great importance was placed on cultivators' original creations, whether for cultivation or daily life. As long as something proved useful, the Sect would certainly acquire it, offering rewards that would fully satisfy the creator. And now, these pieces of equipment were undoubtedly most suitable for the Ma Xiu. Thus, the Ma Xiu had striven to acquire them, and it was therefore appropriate for the Ma Xiu tribe to provide Ding Rui with the rewards. Ding Rui immediately stated that he could readily provide them. If the Sect needed them, he would hand them over, allowing the Sect to maximize their value, and he, naturally, would receive the appropriate rewards. He couldn't keep them from the Sect, nor was there any need to do so.

"Why aren't you thanking Senior Ma Tu yet?" Mu Tian prompted from the side.

Ding Rui finally realized that these two Ma Xiu were likely more than just Ma Wen's parents; they were significant figures within the entire Ma Xiu tribe. He immediately offered his gratitude, but Ma Tu and his wife, in turn, insisted that it was they who should be grateful to Ding Rui. Ding Rui had provided immense help to the entire Ma Xiu community.

"Then we will accept these blueprints for now. If young friend Ding Rui has no other immediate engagements, you can visit our Ma Xiu mountain gate now and select some items you like," Ma Yun said with a smile.

"They’re all excellent items! I’ve been coveting them for ages, but without contributing to the tribe and the Sect's domain, you simply can't acquire them," Ma Wen reminded him from the side.
