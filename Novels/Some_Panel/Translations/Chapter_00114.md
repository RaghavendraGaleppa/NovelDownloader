Chapter 113: I Seem to Have Been Tricked, The Utterly Helpless Yang Ji

"Did you tell anyone else?" Chun Ye stared at Yang Ji, speaking sternly.

"No!" Yang Ji replied solemnly.

"How did you know he was a Heavenly Demon? We only just managed to uncover his identity as a Heavenly Demon after great effort not long ago." Chun Ye scrutinized Yang Ji from head to toe, his surprise evident.

"This disciple also learned of it by accident," Yang Ji replied evasively.

"Learned by accident? Your 'accident' is almost comparable to the power of the entire sect," Chun Ye said, astonished.

"Stay here, don't move. I'll be back shortly," Chun Ye suddenly said after a moment of thought.

"Understood, Elder." Yang Ji nodded.

Chun Ye transformed into a streak of light and flew out of the Dao Pagoda.

"Revered Master, I never expected the sect to know that boy was a demon," the Buddhist Child expressed his surprise.

"I didn't expect it either. It seems the Dao Sect lives up to its name. Although they only found out recently, they did find out in the end. Their methods are numerous, their foundations deep; it's truly hard for ordinary people to fathom. It's for the best that the sect knows," Yang Ji said, moved, and couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

At this moment, in Wuji Pavilion, on the Ninth Heaven.

Sect Master Wuji Zi, Chun Ye, and five other Mahayana Elders were all seated on cloud cushions.

The atmosphere here was somewhat peculiar compared to usual.

"You're saying that the disciple who inherited the East-Orthodox Demonic Emperor's legacy exposed Liu Xiaosheng's identity as a Heavenly Demon?" A Mahayana Elder asked, utterly astonished, finding it hard to believe.

"Yes, my heart also jolted when I first heard it," Chun Ye said, frowning.

"You must know that the sect, using supreme methods, monitored him for hundreds of years, and only then unexpectedly discovered he was a Heavenly Demon. This 'accident' is almost impossible to replicate; it's due to our sect's prosperous fortune, our destiny not being cut off. As for this disciple, is his fortune even more profound than that of the entire sect? Otherwise, I truly can't imagine how he discovered it," a Mahayana Elder said, his eyes flickering with intense curiosity.

"I didn't ask in detail. From his demeanor, I doubt he would tell the truth," Chun Ye mused.

"How interesting. I used to think this disciple might become a True Disciple, but now I've changed my mind. I believe there's a ninety percent chance he'll become a Dao Child, and his ultimate achievements might even surpass ours," a Mahayana Elder suddenly laughed.

"Why do you say that?" another Mahayana Elder asked, puzzled.

"What kind of person is Liu Xiaosheng? He is the reincarnation of a Demonic Emperor's consciousness, with profound fortune and strength ranking among the top ten True Disciples. Behind him is hidden a vast Heavenly Demon force. Such a scheme is equivalent to consolidating all the fortune of this Heavenly Demon force, yet it was discovered by an inner disciple who is only at the first stage of Nascent Soul. How extraordinary is that?" the Mahayana Elder explained.

"Is there a possibility that their destinies are mutually exclusive?" Wuji Zi suddenly interjected.

"Sect Master, are you saying this disciple counters Liu Xiaosheng?"

"Mhm." Wuji Zi nodded calmly. "Where there is Yin, there is Yang; where there is positive, there is negative; where there is life, there is death. All things have two sides. I think this disciple is the side that counters him."

"Sect Master's words are reasonable. Otherwise, how can we explain his ability to discern Liu Xiaosheng as a Heavenly Demon? The cause and effect of heaven and earth revolve, and all things are interdependent and mutually restrictive. Given this, why don't we use this disciple to restrain Liu Xiaosheng?" a Mahayana Elder suddenly proposed.

"I agree. This disciple being able to know he's a Heavenly Demon suggests their destinies clash. If this disciple's destiny can restrain him, it would be better than our deliberate schemes. Moreover, we can use this opportunity to secretly investigate Liu Xiaosheng's conspiracy and the Heavenly Demon force behind him," another Mahayana Elder stated.

"This disciple's strength is still a bit weak. I worry he might suffer in a destiny confrontation. Should we secretly provide him with some resources to enhance his strength?" a Mahayana Elder mused.

"No, the most taboo thing in destiny confrontations is external interference. If we intervene and disrupt his fortune, it might backfire," another Mahayana Elder shook his head.

"He found Chun Ye, and Chun Ye informed us. Aren't we also a part of his fortune? We are already caught in this great karma," Wuji Zi said slowly.

"Then the Sect Master's meaning is..."

"Resources can be given, but not too much. If it truly disrupts his fortune, it might indeed backfire, as Elder Ye said," Wuji Zi clarified.

"I just used a supreme immortal art to divine with my fingers, and it turns out Liu Xiaosheng intended to recruit him. This should be their first encounter, and in this first encounter, their destinies clashed, and he recognized him as a Heavenly Demon. It seems they truly are destined to be opposites," a Mahayana Elder said with interest. "This disciple is also quite a character. He probably doesn't want to be subservient to anyone, so he exposed the fact that Liu Xiaosheng is a Heavenly Demon, hoping to shift the conflict."

"The sect cannot accept this conflict; we must let them fight. The sect will be his strongest backing," a Mahayana Elder chuckled.

"Why not send out a message saying that Yang Ji is destined to become a Dao Child, so how could he possibly be subservient to anyone?" a Mahayana Elder suddenly said with a sly smile.

"Isn't that going too far? Wouldn't it harm this disciple?" a Mahayana Elder frowned, feeling it was inappropriate.

"Let's just give a polite refusal. Anyway, their destinies clash, so this disciple wouldn't agree to join Liu Xiaosheng's ranks. We can help him express his true feelings. Secretly spread the news that an inner disciple at the first stage of Nascent Soul, Yang Ji, politely declined an invitation from the True Disciple Liu Xiaosheng," Wuji Zi said calmly.

"Alright, we'll listen to the Sect Master," a Mahayana Elder laughed.

"Chun Ye, you know what to do," Wuji Zi said.

"I understand," Chun Ye smiled faintly.

Dao Pagoda.

Suddenly, a streak of light flashed, and Chun Ye returned.

"Youngster Yang, this matter is of great importance. You absolutely must not tell a second person, understand? The sect has already begun its arrangements. Rest assured, this Heavenly Demon won't be able to stir up any waves," Chun Ye said sternly.

"Good," Yang Ji naturally understood the implications.

"Hmm, you should go back now. Remember to always be careful with your words and actions," Chun Ye said strictly.

Yang Ji nodded, bowed, and then withdrew from the Dao Pagoda.

But on his way back to the sect, he overheard people beneath the white clouds talking quietly: "I heard that an inner disciple named Yang Ji actually refused the True Disciple Liu Xiaosheng's invitation. He actually turned down such an opportunity to join Tianyu and become a trusted aide of a True Disciple. It's truly perplexing; if it were me, I'd agree a hundred times over."

"No way? He refused a True Disciple's invitation? Why don't I ever get such good fortune?" A disciple shook his head repeatedly, full of envy.

Yang Ji, however, was dumbfounded. When did he refuse? This hadn't even happened yet.

"Revered Master, could it be that someone on Dao Peak is making wild guesses and spreading rumors?" the Buddhist Child mused.

"Let's go, we'll know if we ask," Yang Ji said, his expression sinking.

Flying along, he heard many people discussing the matter, and Yang Ji's brows furrowed deeply.

At Dao Peak, Yang Ji summoned all the handyman disciples.

They stood before him, heads bowed. After questioning them, no one admitted to spreading rumors.

No unusual information appeared above their heads, indicating they were likely telling the truth.

Just as Yang Ji was feeling extremely frustrated, he suddenly thought: "Could it be that the sect played a trick on me? Otherwise, how could the news spread so quickly?"

"The sect leaked it?" The Buddhist Child's small eyes spun.

Yang Ji nodded blankly.

"Revered Master, what do we do now?" the Buddhist Child asked.

"The sect clearly knows Liu Xiaosheng is a Heavenly Demon, yet instead of punishing him, they pushed me out. Do they want me to escalate the conflict with him?"

Yang Ji instantly thought of various possibilities. Is the sect trying to make me fight him? He wouldn't do it. He sprawled out on his large chair, his face showing utter despair, "Utterly helpless!"

"How can you be utterly helpless, you vibrant, fortunate disciple?"

Suddenly, a profound voice echoed in the hall. It was Elder Chun Ye, who tore through space and walked out with a smile.

"Eh, Youngster Yang, cheer up. Anyway, you wouldn't agree to serve him, so what's the harm in us speaking it out for you?" Chun Ye deliberately dragged out his words.

"Don't you just want some benefits? Tell me, what do you want?" Chun Ye glanced at him, smiled lightly, then sat down and poured himself a cup of tea.

"Time Stones, Space Stones, three immortal arts, and spiritual items that can raise my root bone quality to that of a Dao Body, plus I also want to see the Boundless Immortal Scripture," Yang Ji suddenly stood up and declared.

"Pfft!" Chun Ye nearly spat out his tea. "You want to see the Boundless Immortal Scripture? Even I can't see it! You truly are making an outrageous demand!"
