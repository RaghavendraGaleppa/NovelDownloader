# Chapter 27: Record!

"Giggle..." Madam Cheng laughed coquettishly at Wang Chan's anger, her chest heaving, before suddenly turning serious with a sincere expression. 

"The sealing talisman only lasts three days. Within that time, Fellow Daoist Wang must either find a way to deal with that demon bone or flee a thousand miles away. Otherwise, once the time limit passes, the Autumn Wind Cicada will still be able to track you."

Having said this, Madam Cheng gave Wang Chan a deep look, then immediately controlled her Flower-Cutting Blade to swiftly slice at the corpse of the tiger-jiao. 

Soon, precious materials like jiao scales, jiao skin, jiao tendons, jiao claws, and three jiao fangs were dissected and piled up. She even collected a flask of jiao blood. The rest of the jiao corpse was divided into many pieces.

Wang Chan had thought Madam Cheng might have some sealing method to take all these items away and considered whether he could take advantage to get a share. After all, these materials were quite valuable—if they could be safely taken, it would be a windfall.

Unexpectedly, Madam Cheng waved her sleeve again, sending the materials flying with a gust of wind, scattering them throughout the valley.

"Fellow Daoist Cheng, what are you..." Wang Chan asked, puzzled.

"Though I can't take them away, there's no harm in indulging in the thrill of collecting spoils," Madam Cheng said somewhat reluctantly. Then she activated a white mid-grade Purification Talisman.

Instantly, a cool, invisible wind centered around her spread out, washing over the entire valley.

Wang Chan probed with his spiritual sense and confirmed that their previous traces in the area had indeed vanished.

Madam Cheng then applied a gray Concealment Talisman to herself and slapped a low-grade Earthwalk Talisman on her body. A flash of yellow light, and she sank into the ground, leaving without even a word of farewell.

Wang Chan watched her leave but didn't take out a sealing talisman for the jiao horn, simply holding it in his hand. He wasn't worried about being tracked.

Not just the Autumn Wind Cicada—even the more advanced Spring Moon Cicada or the legendary Lunar Cicada wouldn't be able to find him.

Wang Chan tightened his grip on the jiao horn, channeling his magic power into it. Immediately, a line of text appeared before his eyes:

[Superior-grade demon bone detected. Record with the Bone Devouring Great Strength Art?]

Staring at this message, Wang Chan inexplicably grew tense, gritting his teeth as his expression shifted.

Once he became a demonic cultivator, there would be no turning back—only a path of darkness ahead.

But he was just a minor rogue cultivator in the wilds. He had no choice.

Even if things went smoothly with Qu Lian and he had the chance to obtain a low-grade unorthodox cultivation method, it might not suit him. 

And the future was unpredictable.

After all, the world of cultivation was ever-changing.

Most importantly, a superior-grade demon bone was incredibly rare and precious to him. If he missed this opportunity, there might never be another.

"The future is uncertain. All I can grasp is the present—record!" 

Wang Chan let out a low shout.

He had expected some dramatic change in his surroundings, but nothing happened.

Yet, in the depths of his consciousness, a strange sound seemed to echo in his ears.

At the same time, the jiao horn in his hand suddenly became lighter, as if only an empty shell remained. Wang Chan casually crushed it to dust.

Immediately afterward, mysterious forces began circulating through his body, like countless ants crawling beneath his skin, occasionally bringing sharp, biting pains.

Strangest of all was the twisting and screaming in the depths of his soul.

It seemed this sensation would persist for some time.

Wang Chan didn't idle either. He activated a mid-grade Purification Talisman, creating an invisible cleansing wind centered on himself that swept through his storage pouch and eventually washed over the entire valley.

Following Madam Cheng's example, he applied a Concealment Talisman to himself and activated a low-grade Earthwalk Talisman at his feet. A flash of yellow light, and he swiftly burrowed underground, disappearing without a trace.

...

A dozen breaths later.

Fellow Daoist Bai led several patrol guards as they rushed over from the forest, landing at the edge of the valley.

The guards with triangular eyes and others saw the dissected tiger-jiao corpse in the center of the valley and glanced at the headless dog carcass not far from them, their expressions turning grave.

Fellow Daoist Bai's first glance wasn't at the tiger-jiao corpse but at the headless dog carcass about three zhang away from him. His expressionless face twisted imperceptibly, a cold glint flashing in his eyes before his features smoothed again.

"Such a short time... If only I had just let it devour that man directly instead of hesitating..." 

As he was thinking this, the triangular-eyed guard beside him whispered, "Captain Bai, should we go over..."

Fellow Daoist Bai raised a hand. "Let's stay here. Don't disturb the traces and aura. Wait for Mei'er to arrive."

The triangular-eyed guard and the others nodded, standing quietly to the side without another word.

Half an incense stick's time later.

A white cloud drifted over from the horizon, soon appearing above the valley. Before the cloud could descend, two figures dropped from the sky.

One wore white robes with a black skirt, her silver ponytail swaying—Fellow Daoist Chen.

The other was elegant and dignified, clad in a white soft-armor patrol uniform that accentuated her heroic bearing—Beauty Mark.

The moment they landed, Fellow Daoist Chen noticed the filth on the ground and instinctively tiptoed, lightly leaping onto a patch of clean grass.

Then she sighed in relief and crossed her arms, surveying the scene. When she saw the dissected tiger-jiao corpse, her eyes chilled slightly.

Beauty Mark, however, stood frozen for three or four breaths, her face filled with disbelief as she looked left and right before finally settling her gaze on Fellow Daoist Bai and the others in the distance. "Brother Feng..."

Bai Shaofeng slowly shook his head.

Beauty Mark withdrew her gaze, first staring at the dismembered tiger-jiao corpse before letting out a scornful laugh. She patted her storage pouch and summoned a mid-grade flying sword.

The sword's blade was engraved with red-and-white plum blossoms. The moment it appeared, it emitted a clear hum.

"Go!"

With a sharp point of her finger, the flying sword shot forth. Mid-flight, over thirty sword shadows blossomed like plum petals, slashing mercilessly at the tiger-jiao corpse.

In just a few strokes, the corpse was chopped into chunks, leaving the ground stained with blood...

Only then did Beauty Mark reveal a fleeting smile of satisfaction, as if she had reclaimed some dignity.

But the smile vanished as quickly as it came, replaced by fury as she muttered to herself, "No matter who you are, if you dare steal the demon bone and the jiao core, I'll dig you out even if I have to turn every inch of land within a thousand miles upside down!"

With that, she flicked her sleeve, releasing a thumb-sized yellow cicada.

The cicada chirped as it flew toward the tiger-jiao corpse, then to the three-eyed crimson hound, before circling the entire valley like a headless fly for a long while.

When it finally returned to Beauty Mark's sleeve, her face turned deathly pale, and she remained silent for a long time.

"They used purification and concealment talismans," Fellow Daoist Chen said coolly, her sweeping gaze retracting.
