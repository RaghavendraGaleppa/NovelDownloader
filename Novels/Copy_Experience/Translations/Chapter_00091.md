Chapter 90: Green Vine Flower

The Merchant Alliance's strength is truly unfathomable!

This was the thought that surfaced in Lu Xu's mind after seeing those two thousand armored soldiers and these magic-treasure-grade battleships.

What are magic-treasure-grade battleships?

It means that once these battleships are activated, they can unleash terrifying power, akin to a Golden Core True Person wielding a magic treasure. However, unlike magic treasures, they are not limited to being manipulated only by Golden Core True Persons. The Blazing Sun Crossbows, serving as the main crossbows on these ships, can be operated by just three Foundation Establishment cultivators.
