# Chapter 16: The Loose Cultivator Market

The next day.

Chen Daoxuan, having finished his morning cultivation early, began investigating the magic tool market in Guang'an Prefecture as planned.

"Guang'an Prefecture's Immortal City is mainly divided into four areas: the core commercial district, the loose cultivator market, the cave dwelling rental area, and the Zhou family cultivator's residence, who manages this Immortal City. The areas we will mainly investigate today are the core commercial district and the loose cultivator market."

The core commercial district, needless to say, is the most prosperous area of the entire Guang'an Prefecture Immortal City. Land is incredibly expensive here, and most shops are priceless. To buy a shop in this bustling commercial area, having spirit stones alone is not enough; someone must be willing to sell. Most of the shops in the core commercial district are controlled by the Zhou family and several major Foundation Establishment families, making it difficult for ordinary cultivators to get involved.

As for the loose cultivator market, it is a commercial area dominated by loose cultivators and small families. Shops are scarce here, and most are stalls set up by loose cultivators. As everyone knows, loose cultivators are generally poor, with empty pockets, so their spending power is naturally far less than that of the disciples of large families.

However, although the individual wealth of loose cultivators cannot compare to that of large family disciples, their numbers are vast. In terms of quantity, the number of loose cultivators in the surrounding ten thousand miles of sea area exceeds that of family disciples by dozens of times. Therefore, the seemingly chaotic loose cultivator market has become the second most prosperous place in the entire Guang'an Prefecture Immortal City, second only to the core commercial district.

"Thirteenth Uncle, why don't we split up? This way, we can speed up the investigation."

Hearing this, Chen Xianhe thought for a moment, "Alright."

After some discussion, Chen Xianhe chose to investigate the core commercial district, while Chen Daoxuan went to the loose cultivator market, which they both favored more.

Riding in a Cloud-Stepping Beast carriage, Chen Daoxuan headed to the loose cultivator market of Guang'an Prefecture Immortal City.

As soon as he entered the loose cultivator market, before getting out of the carriage, the bustling noise from outside entered Chen Daoxuan's ears.

After paying the fare and getting out of the carriage, Chen Daoxuan carefully examined the largest gathering place for loose cultivators in the surrounding ten thousand miles of sea area.

The streets here are much wider than those in the core commercial district. Rather than calling it a street, it is more like a rectangular square.

On both sides of the street, countless loose cultivators spread out carpets, placed some goods on them, and began to shout and sell. It looked quite similar to a flea market from his previous life.

In comparison, the shops on both sides of the street were much quieter. Loose cultivators seemed to prefer to haggle for items at the stalls rather than go to the shops.

Chen Daoxuan thought for a moment and walked towards the quiet shops instead of the more lively loose cultivator stalls.

"Tongbao Pavilion!"

Standing in front of a shop, Chen Daoxuan glanced at the signboard and walked in.

It seemed like it had been a long time since a customer had visited. The shopkeeper of Tongbao Pavilion was stunned when he saw a customer enter, then his face filled with a smile, and he trotted forward.

"This fellow Daoist, I wonder what you would like to buy? We have magic tools, pills, talismans, spirit rice, and various spiritual materials to choose from..."

Seeing a customer, the Tongbao Pavilion shopkeeper gave a long introduction, afraid that Chen Daoxuan would run away.

After listening to the shopkeeper's introduction, Chen Daoxuan had a rough idea in his mind. This shop was a general store, selling almost everything, but the quality of the goods was unknown.

"Shopkeeper, you're too kind," Chen Daoxuan cupped his hands and pondered, "I wonder how the magic tools in your shop are sold?"

"Magic tools!"

Hearing "magic tools," the shopkeeper's eyes lit up. A big deal! "The prices of different magic tools vary. I wonder what grade of magic tool fellow Daoist wants to buy?"

"First-order magic tools. Bring me a low-grade, a mid-grade, and a high-grade flying sword for me to take a look." Chen Daoxuan said straightforwardly.

The shopkeeper nodded, "Fellow Daoist, please follow me upstairs."

After speaking, he made a gesture of invitation.

After going upstairs to the second floor, the shopkeeper asked a shop assistant to serve tea, while he personally fetched the magic tools for Chen Daoxuan.

After about half a cup of tea's time, the shopkeeper brought three sword boxes according to Chen Daoxuan's request. Inside the sword boxes were three flying swords, respectively of first-order low-grade, mid-grade, and high-grade.

"Fellow Daoist, please take a look!"

The shopkeeper first opened the leftmost sword box, and a cold, shimmering cyan flying sword came into view.

"This is a first-order low-grade flying sword, the Azure Edge Sword. This sword is extremely sharp. When infused with true qi, the sword芒 can reach two feet."

Chen Daoxuan took the flying sword and infused it with true qi. Immediately, a sword芒 more than two feet long shot out from the tip of the sword.

"How is it?"

Chen Daoxuan remained noncommittal and looked at the other two sword boxes.

The shopkeeper didn't mind and opened the second sword box.

Immediately, a silver light came into view.

"This is a first-order mid-grade flying sword, the Silver Moon Sword. It is made entirely of Silver Moon Stone. This sword can not only unleash a five-foot sword芒, but it is also not afraid of intense fire. It is truly the nemesis of fire-type spells!"

Seeing that Chen Daoxuan was dissatisfied with the first flying sword, the shopkeeper quickly introduced the second flying sword.

However, when Chen Daoxuan saw the second flying sword, he already had a vague understanding of the magic tools sold in this shop.

Without waiting for the shopkeeper to introduce it, he opened the third sword box himself.

As expected...

Chen Daoxuan's face was full of disappointment, but he was secretly happy.

"Shopkeeper, why are the magic tools you sell all second-hand goods!"

Seeing Chen Daoxuan expose the secret in one sentence, the embarrassed expression on the shopkeeper's face flashed by.

Chen Daoxuan didn't speak nonsense. These three flying swords were all second-hand flying swords that others had used, and they had been used for at least five years. The spiritual charm on the flying swords had begun to dissipate.

You must know that the lifespan of a general first-order magic tool is only about ten years.

A flying sword that has been used for five years has already reached half of its lifespan. Unless the price is extremely low, even loose cultivators are unwilling to buy such a flying sword.

"Fellow Daoist has sharp eyes," Seeing that Chen Daoxuan saw through the trick, the shopkeeper no longer concealed it, "The flying swords in our shop are indeed flying swords that were traded down by disciples of large families."

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan took a sip of tea and waited for the following.

Seeing Chen Daoxuan's indifferent attitude, the shopkeeper continued, "Fellow Daoist should know that my Myriad Star Sea has been at war with the Kingdom of Chuyun. The demand for magic tools on the front line has reached a critical point. Even within the Myriad Star Sea, if you go to the seven Immortal Cities on the front line, flying swords of this quality, even if they are second-hand, would have been snapped up long ago!"

Hearing this nonsense, Chen Daoxuan couldn't help but sneer, "Then why doesn't the shopkeeper go to the front line to sell these flying swords?"

He believed the shopkeeper that the front line lacked magic tools, after all, magic tools have a lifespan, and fierce battles will drastically shorten the lifespan of magic tools.

The Myriad Star Sea and the Kingdom of Chuyun have been fighting for hundreds of years, and the lack of magic tools on the front line is obvious.

But to say that any random second-hand magic tool would be wanted by the cultivators on the front line is completely a lie.

Because the more cultivators fighting on the front line, the higher the requirements for the quality of magic tools.

After all, no one wants to lose their lives on the battlefield because the quality of the magic tool is too poor.

You should know that even if the Qian Yuan Sword Sect wants the cultivators of the Myriad Star Sea to contribute to the war with the Kingdom of Chuyun, they can only rely on various cultivation methods and cultivation resources to attract them.

Who dares to force the cultivators on the front line to use these inferior second-hand goods? Aren't they afraid of a mutiny at any moment?

Seeing that he couldn't deceive Chen Daoxuan, the shopkeeper had no choice but to continuously lower the price of the flying swords, until finally he reduced the price of the Azure Edge Sword to 50 spirit stones, but Chen Daoxuan still refused to budge.

"Since your shop doesn't have the magic tools I want, then I won't bother you any longer."

After saying that, Chen Daoxuan was about to leave.

"Fellow Daoist, don't waste your effort," Seeing that Chen Daoxuan was unwilling to buy the magic tools in his shop, the shopkeeper's attitude also cooled down, "Whether it's in our loose cultivator market or the core commercial district, the probability of you buying a brand new magic tool is too low."

After speaking, the shopkeeper didn't say anything more.

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan paused, cupped his hands, and left the shop.
