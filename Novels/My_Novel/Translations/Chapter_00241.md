Chapter 241: Falling Flowers Have Feelings, Seeking a Lover on Their Own. Shaping the Bones and Embryo, the Immortal Sound Begins to Play!

The next day.

The rooster crowed, and the eastern sky turned pale. Li Xian rose at the sound of the rooster to practice his swordplay. The Sinking River Sword was three feet long and two fingers wide, its cold gleam flashing as it could cut through iron as if it were mud.

It could also manipulate water to create waves.

As day turned to night, the sunlight slanted down. The tip of Li Xian's sword met the sunlight, slowly drawing it in. The Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword had reached its peak perfection; it could actually pull the sunlight along, bending it with the sword. It划过一道光弧 (drew a arc of light).

Dimly, a purple aura seemed to gather. Li Xian slowed his sword movements, executing the Three Days Open Prosperity, Standing Under the Sun, Setting Sun Like Blood, Scorching Sun in the Sky... many profound sword techniques, one after another. He emphasized intent over form, so the Yang Sword danced gracefully, without dispersing a trace of scorching heat.

The sword tip drew in the purple aura, bringing a refreshing coolness instead. Suddenly, it thrust out diagonally, the blade vibrating continuously, making a "humming" sound. The purple aura became incredibly dense, setting off Li Xian's extremely noble appearance.

This move was called "Purple Qi Coming from the East." It was a move of immense killing power within the Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword, requiring the moment of day and night transition to gather abundant purple energy at the sword tip and unleash it. One needed a perfect level of attainment to barely execute it.

[You gathered abundant purple energy, Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword Level 1 and Level 2 proficiency +59.]

Heaven rewards the diligent; there will surely be gains. Li Xian's mind was greatly delighted, his interest further expressed. He suddenly thought: "Since I started practicing martial arts, my skills may not be systematic, but my attainments are not shallow. I can try to combine and execute them."

Suddenly, he flipped his palm and struck, executing the 'Green Luo Palm.' Mist filled the air. Where Li Xian's sword tip划过 (drew), colorful light shimmered, as if there were divine signs. A complete set of sword dance was performed, within the broken courtyard of the earthen house, five-colored lights shone, immortal energy was dense, and mist drifted.

Li Xian continuously executed sword moves, the red mole between his eyebrows glowing slightly. The Perfect Appearance naturally revealed itself. The mist around him seemed like immortal energy, elegant and handsome.

Li Xian was graceful, his long hair dancing. His jade-like face and immortal features were extremely handsome. Filled with Yang energy, his pure Yang body was like an invisible furnace, attracting the gazes of women.

Wen Caishang lay in bed, already awake, silently observing. Her red lips were slightly pursed, her beautiful eyes like the surface of a lake in February, the spring mood becoming harder and harder to conceal.

In the morning, Li Xian practiced his sword. At noon, he saw the farmer resting under a tree and went over to chat, inquiring about strange news and stories, chatting about local affairs.

At night, he helped Wen Caishang with a massage.

Life in the countryside was not without its charm. The Flower Water Prefecture was a relatively wealthy land, with fertile soil and abundant water, a mild climate, and rich production of venomous snakes and frogs. And because flowers bloomed abundantly, they attracted bees and butterflies. Occasionally, one could see beehives and extract honey.

In the Harmonious Village, there were mischievous boys who, after finishing their farm work, would go into the mountains in groups to pry open beehives and steal honey, returning with their heads swollen. The men busy in the fields always carried small baskets at their waists. When they saw venomous snakes, eels, or frogs, they would catch them casually. Cooking a pot of snake soup or eel soup was also a fine delicacy.

Wen Caishang, lying idle and bored, watched the farmers transplanting rice seedlings. Seeing so much related to "snakes, eels, and frogs," she couldn't help feeling a bit curious. She asked Li Xian to catch some for her to try.

Li Xian was greatly surprised but naturally satisfied her request. He went into the fields at night, catching venomous snakes, kicking frogs, catching eels... skillfully skinning and gutting them, and cooked a pot of "Three Delicacies of the Fields."

His culinary skills were truly impressive. The soup was fresh and delicious, with a hint of earthy flavor adding a unique local style.

[You cooked Three Delicacies of the Fields, Culinary Arts proficiency +12.]

Just like this, in the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Wen Caishang's left hand could already move, her fingers nimble. But it was difficult to exert strength. Wielding a sword was no problem, but if she tried to lift a heavy object, she couldn't.

Wen Caishang said: "Don't underestimate me. If you put five stones in my palm, ordinary experts couldn't get close to me."

Li Xian was very curious and decided to test it. He found stones in the courtyard, washed them clean, and placed them in Wen Caishang's palm. Then he played the role of a bandit, pretending to break into the courtyard.

Pushing open the wooden gate of the small courtyard, he heard a "whoosh" sound, a stone bounced around, accurately striking towards him. This was the "Falling Flowers Have Feelings" move from the "Pinching Flower Finger."

Falling flowers have feelings, seeking a lover on their own. Therefore, the stones bounced around, always hitting towards Li Xian. Wen Caishang no longer had internal energy; her Pinching Flower Finger had form but no rhythm, yet it was still extremely powerful.

Li Xian leaped up, nimbly dodging. While in mid-air, the second and third stones shot out one after another. The angles were strange, the force was light, but three or two such forces could kill a tiger!

Li Xian flipped his body, gracefully avoiding all of them. He already knew Wen Caishang's strength, rushed into the room, and laughed: "I'm close to you, you've lost."

Wen Caishang said: "I'm weak and powerless, with no internal energy, unable to use powerful moves. Even if my whole body could move, I wouldn't be your match. The ordinary experts I spoke of are those below the Food Essence level. You're just bullying the weak with your strength."

Li Xian said: "I just like bullying the weak with my strength." They played with each other for a while, tickling her waist, neck, soles of her feet... Wen Caishang's laughter was clear, with shyness in her breath, joy hidden in her shyness, and happiness in her joy. The earthen house was built of yellow mud, not soundproof. A villager passing by muttered: "These young people have no shame, doing that in broad daylight." He looked up, wanting to see some erotic scene. A stone shot out, 'pfft'一声 (with a sound) pierced his eye, blood flowed non-stop, and he screamed in agony in an instant.

Wen Caishang raised her eyebrows and sneered, another stone pinched between her fingertips. She thought: "Disturbing my mood, you mud doll, if your eyes aren't clean, I'll废了 them (disable them)." She lightly flicked it, aiming for the other eye.

Li Xian felt a slight chill in his heart: "My lady's attacks are still so vicious." Unwilling to cause trouble, he took a silver coin from his chest, threw it out, and knocked down Wen Caishang's stone. The silver coin's momentum had just ended, landing right in the farmer's hand.

The farmer's eye was bleeding, originally terrified to the extreme. But seeing the silver coin hit him, his panic instantly dispersed. He pocketed the silver coin and ran far away. Wen Caishang snorted: "You refuse to gouge out others' eyes for me, so I'll do it myself. Why did you stop me? Are you closer to that farmer than to me?"

Li Xian said: "I don't want to cause trouble. If you blind both his eyes, his screams will shake the heavens. His wife and children will surely come looking for us. What then? We can't stay here anymore."

Wen Caishang said: "What's there to be afraid of? If they dare to make things difficult, I'll disable their eyes one by one, turning this Harmonious Village into a Village of the Blind. There are so many villages in the world, we can just find another place. As long as you and I are fine, that's what matters."

Li Xian sighed inwardly: "My lady's hand has just started working, and she's already restored her former ruthlessness. When her strength fully recovers, I wonder if she'll show me any mercy." He became determined to escape afterwards.

Wen Caishang knew Li Xian's temperament well, unlike herself. She主动 (actively) softened her voice and said: "You blame me for being too ruthless, are you angry? I'm doing it to them, not to you. When I get better, I'll thank you properly." Remembering Wen Caishang's methods, Li Xian wanted to take the opportunity to "bully the weak with his strength" and give her a good beating. Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes rippled; although she cursed Li Xian for being disrespectful, she clearly enjoyed it.

Night.

Li Xian lurked in the dark, sneaking up to the farmer's house, and listened with his ear pressed to the wall: "You damn man, how did you get so badly injured? The doctor said your eye... there's no hope for it!"

"Ouch, speaking of which, it's unlucky. Didn't a young couple come to our village? They're quite young, but the man doesn't farm and the woman doesn't weave. I got curious and went to take a look. Who knew a stone would hit me in the eye? It hurts like hell!"

"I told you to be nosy. I bet you wanted to see if his wife was good-looking, right? You damn pervert, don't I know you? You deserve it! Oh, but it's too severe. A perfectly good eye, just disabled like that."

"You know what... although I didn't see her face, her voice, it was truly like a fairy's voice, hehe."

After listening for a long time, suddenly the candlelight was extinguished, and sounds of rustling clothes being taken off came through. Li Xian muttered: "Man, injured like that, and still doing manual labor. Farming by day and farming by night, you've really worked hard." It was inconvenient to watch further, so he used his lightness skill and left.

In the blink of an eye, it was the tenth day.

Wen Caishang's Qi and blood had circulated enough for her to sit up. She sat cross-legged in the room, her long hair hanging down... but then it fell.

She murmured: "What a powerful蛊虫 (poisonous insect). The moment I accumulate a trace of internal energy, it吸走了 (sucks it away)."

Li Xian's goal was clear, hiding in Harmonious Village for two purposes: waiting for Wen Caishang to recover from her injuries, and spending time fabricating a route.

Wen Caishang's injuries were difficult to heal, but her finger strength was gradually dissipating. She was gradually able to protect herself.

Li Xian relaxed his mind and mingled with the villagers, inquiring about distant and nearby rumors. He indeed gained something, learning of a local "Fuhua Trading Firm."

Trading firms travel for business, exchanging goods, inevitably going on long journeys. This Fuhua Trading Firm mainly sells silk and shoes to the south, and its trade route goes directly to the Southern Frontier. The Qiong Tian Prefecture is a frequent stop along the way.

The road conditions along the way were naturally very clear.

During these past few days, Li Xian frequently visited the trading firm. He treated people to drinks, made friends, and凭借 (relying on) his elegant demeanor, befriended the people of the trading firm.

When asked about the journey south, the people of the trading firm boasted and joked, with various stories: encountering demons, killing bandits, fighting wicked merchants, breaking through mazes... and so on.

It was truly full of ups and downs, dangerous and thrilling, incredibly exciting. The truth and falsehood within were hard to tell.

Rising at the sound of the rooster, sleeping at the sound of frogs.

Sleeping together at night, playing together during the day.

This night, the two embraced as they slept. Li Xian took the opportunity to ask: "My lady, why do I feel my body gradually getting heavier?"

Wen Caishang said: "You're showing the signs of reaching the Second Realm of martial arts!"

"The 'Immortal Sound'?" Li Xian asked.

"Correct," Wen Caishang said. "The Immortal Sound... the Great Plainness is the bone quality. The Second Realm of martial arts is related to human bones. You consume the essence of heaven and earth, your physique transforms, gradually turning inward."

"The so-called 'Immortal Sound' is actually when the bone quality has transformed to a certain extent, the bones are no longer ordinary, and when they collide with each other, they produce a strange sound. It's roughly like a light 'bell sound.'"

"But people are different, there will always be slight differences."

Li Xian said: "So that's it. The bone quality transforms, so the body suddenly becomes heavy. The bones collide with each other, producing a crisp bell sound, which is the 'Immortal Sound.' This sound can disturb one's thoughts?"

Wen Caishang said: "Naturally it can. If you study it carefully, it has many wonderful uses. Some martial arts schools and martial arts moves... are developed based on this foundation."

"Su Qiuwu, Li Quan, Zhao Zhiyuan are all skilled at using the Immortal Sound. But your level isn't high enough to see the trick. In your eyes, it's just an ordinary punch or thrust, but in reality, it contains profound martial principles."

Li Xian felt this was very useful and pursued the question: "That's right, why do martial artists of this realm dissolve upon touching water?"

Wen Caishang said: "Naturally it's because..." Remembering how Li Xian had compared her to a wild boar in a roundabout way, her temper flared up. She said: "I'm not telling you. Figure it out yourself. Or else, beg me."

Li Xian laughed: "I don't beg people. I have my own way to extract the answer." Wen Caishang panicked, then saw her feet being lifted up, and the soles of her feet being tickled.

Half an hour later, Wen Caishang repeatedly begged for mercy and吐露了实情 (revealed the truth).

It turned out that... the way of martial artists, the body is like the universe. The Second Realm of martial arts has already shown a glimpse, so it undergoes a process of "Turbid Sinking, Clear Rising."

When falling into water, a martial artist's body becomes buoyant, and the turbid energy within the body sinks. This drags the martial artist's body down into the lake.

No matter what swimming technique is used, it's difficult to resist.

And in the water, lightness skills are useless. You can't swim, you can't fly... there's nowhere to借力 (borrow force). Naturally, you can only drown in the water.

Therefore... dissolving upon touching water, like a mud Bodhisattva.

After this day, Li Xian tried the "Immortal Sound," gradually able to emit a faint strange sound. The human body has "two hundred and six" bones. Every bone, at its joints, friction, collision, or light touch can produce a strange sound.

This "Immortal Sound" contains extremely profound knowledge. When fighting with others, the bones must move, producing all kinds of strange sounds, making people unconsciously get hit. It's incredibly powerful!

Li Xian felt he had entered a new world. He was infinitely delighted. When dancing his sword, amidst the hazy immortal mist, paired with the "Immortal Sound," some inexplicable changes seemed to occur.
