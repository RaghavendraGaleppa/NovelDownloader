# Chapter 70: Advantage is Mine—Settle Scores and Grudges  

The wind howled as white clouds gathered in the sky.  

Pristine, unblemished clouds piled upon one another, their hues gradually darkening until they transformed into an oppressive canopy of black clouds that blotted out the sky.  

Standing atop the single-horned savage tiger, Gongshu Duwang lightly tapped its forehead. The beast’s horn ignited with a brilliant light, shooting a radiant beam straight into the heavens.  

The sea of dark clouds was instantly torn apart, revealing the azure sky beyond. Dazzling sunlight poured through the gap, bathing the central square in its glow. The light fell precisely within the boundaries of the square, while the surrounding areas remained shrouded in shadow, as if separated by an invisible barrier.  

Under the brilliant sunlight, Dou Changsheng could clearly feel a peculiar energy seeping into his body through his skin. Meanwhile, Liu Baiyu—who stood before him, holding a pagoda aloft with an imposing, mountain-like presence—watched as his aura visibly withered at an alarming rate.  

The nine-tiered exquisite pagoda in his hand dimmed, its luster fading in an instant as if covered in rust, stripped of all radiance.  

The pagoda had been sealed. Of course, Dou Changsheng knew this was only possible because Liu Baiyu hadn’t resisted, deliberately yielding to the power of the Universal Love Divine Ring. Otherwise, Gongshu Duwang alone wouldn’t have been able to suppress so many powerful experts.  

*No blades* didn’t mean fighting barehanded.  

Every martial artist had their own strengths—some specialized in swordsmanship, while others excelled in palm techniques.  

The true restriction was on the grade of treasures. Liu Baiyu, known as the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King, relied heavily on his nine-tiered exquisite pagoda. Without it, his combat prowess plummeted drastically.  

Lin Sanxing, a commander of the Golden Feather Guard and an imperial official, should have naturally sided with Liu Baiyu. However, realizing this wasn’t a life-or-death battle but merely a controlled skirmish, he chose not to intervene, instead currying favor with the Wang Clan.  

Liu Baiyu ranked fourteenth on the Earthly Rankings—no small feat.  

But compared to the ninth-ranked Nine Heavens Cloud Crane, his standing paled in comparison.  

The top ten of the Human Rankings were in a league of their own, far surpassing the rest. The same went for the Earthly Rankings, where every figure in the top ten could sway the tides of the world.  

If not for Yu Yun, Chen Qingyao, and Wang Tianhe, the Wolf Lord would have long since marched south with his armies rather than biding his time, covertly meddling in the Great Jin’s martial world.  

Liu Baiyu’s expression remained calm, but a closer look revealed the shadow in his eyes. The mere mention of the Nine Heavens Cloud Crane—without the man even appearing—had been enough to sway Gongshu Duwang’s stance and silence the other grandmasters.  

*When would he ever command such influence?*  

Had he possessed such clout, the previous coup would never have unfolded behind his back—neither the Martial King nor the Empress would have dared exclude him from their plans.  

Had he ranked among the top ten of the Earthly Rankings and led the imperial clan, the Empress’s ascension would have hinged on his approval.  

Now, he could feel his strength waning. His martial core—once a boundless source of energy—now lay dormant, replaced by the weaker flow of innate true essence, which was rapidly degrading further into mere innate true qi.  

This weakness was like a debilitating illness, leaving him as fragile as porcelain—one wrong move, and he would shatter.  

Liu Baiyu was unaccustomed to this state. His innate true qi, golden and radiant like sacred light, flickered briefly before dissipating. Frowning, he realized the situation was worse than expected. He had assumed the suppression would only affect his energy, not his realm comprehension—something that should have remained intact.  

Ordinary martial artists in the Divine Marvel realm began by condensing their martial intent, then progressed to pure yin or pure yang, and finally to the extremes of those states.  

But he had already reached the Martial Core realm, surpassing the Divine Marvel realm entirely.  

He had intended to leverage his superior realm to dominate, but now he found the Universal Love Divine Ring’s power far more formidable than anticipated. His realm itself seemed blurred. He knew that forcibly breaking the suppression would restore his strength, but doing so would violate the spirit of the duel.  

Not only did he lack any advantage now, but with his pagoda sealed, his combat power had diminished further. He was being deliberately targeted, weaker than usual.  

As if reading his thoughts, Monk Lu, his arms crossed to reveal the green tattoos covering them, sneered.  

"Liu Baiyu, what’s with that expression? This is your true strength."  

"Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King—what a grand title. But most of it is just hot air. This is what you really are."  

"That’s why you’ll never compare to the top ten of the Earthly Rankings."  

"Their strength comes from themselves. Their treasures are just embellishments."  

Monk Lu strode forward, his towering and muscular frame exuding overwhelming pressure. Clenching a fist, he raised it high with a savage grin.  

"I’ve long wanted to beat the arrogance out of you."  

"Hiding behind your treasures, acting all high and mighty."  

"Today, I finally get my chance."  

Liu Baiyu’s expression darkened. "Impudent!"  

"Don’t think that just because we’re both on the Earthly Rankings, you’re my equal. A waste who can’t even condense a martial core dares look down on me?"  

The two collided in an instant.  

This was an opportunity too rare to miss.  

Dou Changsheng paid them no mind. As the Universal Love Divine Ring’s power took effect, more figures began appearing in the central square. Clearly, Gongshu Duwang had invited quite a few people.  

Among the younger generation, it wasn’t just Dou Changsheng, Jin Wuming, and Sun Duxiu. Others had arrived as well, including several ranked on the Human Rankings. However, the one Dou Changsheng had been watching for—the leading figure of the Mohist younger generation, the Nine Precepts Daoist Zhao Feile—had yet to appear.  

Zhao Feile, ranked tenth on the Human Rankings, was a true prodigy, destined to become a high-ranking figure among the Mohists.  

Rumors said he had originally been a Daoist priest before abandoning Daoism for Mohism, earning him the title "Nine Precepts Daoist." His very name—*Feile*—reflected one of the Mohist Ten Doctrines, a clear declaration of his convictions.  

Dou Changsheng was eager to face him. The Earthly Rankings experts were irrelevant—if he won, he’d rise by stepping over them; if he lost, it was only expected.  

In this chaotic melee, he held a significant advantage.  

He had no reputation to uphold, unlike Jin Wuming and the others. If they lost to him in an equalized battle, their rankings would suffer. Even a draw would boost his standing.  

Most importantly, this battle was calibrated to his strength.  

*The advantage was his.*  

His gaze shifted to Zhao Wudao.  

"Senior," he said bluntly.  

"Shall we?"  

Last time they met, the man had glared at him with hostility.  

Little Dou never forgot a grudge.  

If Monk Lu could settle scores, so could he.
