# Chapter 139: The Poisoned Gorge

A hundred miles before the entrance of the Poisoned Gorge lay the encampment of the Black Lotus Sect's army.

Thousands of cultivators bustled about, casting spells to construct high platforms, dig trenches, fill them with water, set up formations, and build cave dwellings. In just a few short days, this military camp had been transformed into a colossal stronghold.

Rows of silver-white rune-covered war chariots stood at the camp's forefront, backed by runic cannons mounted on the battlements. In the sky, numerous airships hovered in patrol. The war machines of the cultivation world were on full display.

Lin Shan followed Protector Yan into this heavily fortified camp, where an atmosphere of solemnity and suffocating tension hung in the air.

Protector Yan was immediately summoned to the central command hall to discuss military strategy, while Lin Shan and the others were assigned temporary quarters. During his free time, Lin Shan wandered around, gathering information about the surrounding area from others.

The situation remained grim—the Poisoned Gorge was far more terrifying than imagined.

According to scouts who had ventured inside, the perpetual mist shrouding the gorge contained deadly toxins. A single breath would kill a mortal instantly, and cultivators could only rely on their spiritual energy to protect themselves. Prolonged exposure would gradually corrode both flesh and magical artifacts.

The upper skies were blocked by the Nine Heavens Gale Winds, and the toxicity of the mist increased in layers the higher one ascended, making flight nearly impossible. The only way through was on foot.

The ground was almost entirely wetlands and swamps, teeming with venomous insects and beasts. Even the plants and flowers were poisonous, and drinking from the springs would cause one's body to rot. Toxic springs were everywhere.

After traversing three thousand miles of the gorge, another natural barrier awaited—the Yin Miasma Illusion Wind Belt.

This area was perpetually swept by an eerie wind carrying miasma, which not only corroded and poisoned but also induced hallucinations. Cultivators who entered often either lost their way and stumbled into forbidden zones or exhausted their spiritual energy and perished within the illusions.

Even if one managed to cross the Yin Miasma Illusion Wind Belt, they would still face the well-rested forces of the righteous sects waiting on the other side.

The vast Luosong Mountain Range stretched for hundreds of thousands of miles, with over a dozen east-west passage entrances. The righteous sects had no way of knowing which route the three demonic sects would choose to breach, so they stationed troops at every possible entry point.

Now, Lin Shan and the others fully understood the peril of their mission.

The demonic sects' strategy was simple—only the high-ranking elders in the command center knew which routes were the main assaults and which were diversions. 

The plan was to attack on all fronts.

While the Poisoned Gorge was exceptionally deadly, the other passages through the Luosong Mountains were no less treacherous—some involved mountain paths, waterways, dark valleys, or even graveyards, each with their own unique dangers.

Protector Yan spent three hours in the central command hall before returning.

None of his subordinates knew what had been discussed, but they were informed that they would set out in three days, heading straight into the Poisoned Gorge.

This time, the three demonic sects were coordinating their assault, launching attacks at all dozen-plus strategic passes simultaneously. Every unit's objective was to break through and march straight to the capital, Bianliang!

There was no retreat—only forward.

No one knew which routes were the main assaults and which were feints. Regardless, the first wave of cannon fodder consisted of local forces and rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea, with the main forces following half a day later.

The demonic sects were staking everything on this one decisive battle, committing all their forces to break through the Luosong Mountains once and for all.

Rumors said that the righteous sect guarding the other side of the Poisoned Gorge was the prestigious Cangxuan Sect from Yingchuan.

Lin Shan collected the free supplies provided by the camp—pills to repel insects, dispel miasma, detoxify, and restore spiritual energy. The sect's alchemists were working overtime to produce more pills, ensuring the army had enough provisions for the campaign.

Every cultivator around wore a grave expression, the tension palpable.

No one knew if they would survive this mission. They would either reunite in the imperial capital of Bianliang or be forever separated by death.

After all, their previous battles had been easy victories. This was the first time they would face a truly formidable opponent, and heavy casualties were inevitable.

As night fell, the cultivators in the camp gathered in small groups, discussing strategies. Lin Shan sat alone by a campfire, seemingly lost in thought, not joining any of the conversations.

But though he appeared alone, he was actually conversing with the tiny skull pendant on his wrist.

"Kid, I've led armies in countless battles—jungle warfare, desert warfare, plains warfare, naval and aerial battles. You name it, I've done it. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about!"

"You're not the commander. What's the point of listening to you?"

"Now, now, that's not the right attitude. This Demon Lord has never lost a battle. Wherever my forces march, victory follows. I can definitely help you avoid unnecessary trouble."

"Fine, then tell me—what should I do?" Lin Shan listened half-heartedly as the skull rambled on.

"First, in a surprise assault, an individual's strength is negligible. You could easily die from the residual effects of a high-level cultivator's spell before you even know what hit you."

"I know—death by random AoE damage in a team fight."

"So you need to find ways to improve your overall strength—not just in specific defensive abilities, but in all aspects."

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord prattled on endlessly, leaving Lin Shan more confused than enlightened. After listening for nearly an hour, he finally realized the skull was subtly hinting that he should allow it to advance to the Foundation Establishment stage.

---

If its avatar could recover to Foundation Establishment strength, it could unleash more techniques, greatly enhancing their chances of survival.

Under the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's leadership, Lin Shan's odds of making it through would skyrocket!

Lin Shan frowned. Its leadership? So this thing still dreamed of reversing their roles and making him its subordinate?

Though the Poisoned Gorge was undeniably perilous, Lin Shan remained confident. His true trump card was the ancient charms. As long as he conserved enough of them, he could save himself in critical moments.

Better to rely on oneself than others. Apart from his own enhancement panel, Lin Shan trusted no one.

Besides, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had already tricked him out of a high-grade magical artifact back in the Stormy Sea. There was no way he'd give it a free pass now.

The skull pendant continued to plead, but Lin Shan remained unmoved. With its current strength inferior to Lin Shan's and no means of escape, it could only sigh in despair, convinced it would eventually be dragged to its doom by this stubborn kid.

---

Three days later, tens of thousands of cultivators stood in formation at the entrance of the Poisoned Gorge, all solemnly awaiting their final orders. This was a full-frontal assault—anyone attempting to desert would be executed on the spot by the disciplinary troops.

The commander overseeing the operation was none other than the Black Lotus Sect's leader. Whether any Nascent Soul experts accompanied their unit remained unknown—such elite forces, serving as strategic deterrents, kept their movements strictly confidential.

The sect leader checked the sky, counting the hours until dusk. As the first night watch began, he issued the command to Protector Yan's Ninth Division.

"Junior Sister Yan, lead your team ahead to scout. The main force will follow at dawn."

"Understood!"

"Stay safe, Junior Sister."

Without another word, Protector Yan led Lin Shan and the others straight into the Poisoned Gorge.

Under the cover of night, the gorge's towering cliffs loomed on either side, their peaks lost in the mist. The distant view was obscured by a dense, swirling fog, making the entrance resemble a gaping maw, ready to devour all who entered.
