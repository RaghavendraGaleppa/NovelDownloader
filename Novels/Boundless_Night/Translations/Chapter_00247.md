Chapter 247: Discussing Important Matters

Night reappeared, the world steeped in darkness.

All the Ancestors had withdrawn their Heavenly Light and consciousness auras.

Cao Qianqiu felt a blockage in his heart; he had become the biggest loser.

Deep within the plateau, an object floated with a hazy glow, rising from the ground into the sight of all the Ancestors.

Cao Qianqiu’s eyes gleamed eerily, fixated on it.

It was the rusty long spear, now seemingly reawakened and appearing in the night sky. With no "great suns" hanging overhead, it was strikingly conspicuous, its shaft clearly adorned with divine symbols.

Everyone knew this was the spear Old Cao had thrown down. No one dared to seize it now, as they all sensed its malevolent nature.

Cao Qianqiu watched it, an indescribable feeling in his heart. Ever since he had obtained this spear, he had known no peace, experiencing one misfortune after another. His turning point today, in particular, was when he suddenly plunged from the sky, blasted apart in an instant, a downward spiral from which he had been unable to recover.

"Did Black and White Mountain’s influence persist until now?"

Cao Qianqiu’s gaze remained eerie, deeply silent. No one knew his mood or what he was thinking.

The rusty spear swayed leisurely, like a street wanderer, flying through the long night sky and drifting like a ghost near Old Cao. Finally, it circled Cao Qianqiu once before leisurely flying away.

Old Cao’s eyes blazed with fury. It truly felt like a tiger falling into the plains to be bullied by dogs! Even a rusty spear dared to "show off" in front of him. He longed to slap it away.

But he held back, having deeply realized how deep the waters were here, and that the issues involved might be even more terrifying than the Ancestor War itself.

The spear moved away, vanishing into the vast night. Its direction seemed to be towards Black and White Mountain. The others did not intervene; as extraordinary figures, they naturally discerned some clues. Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan, among others, knew that Cao Qianqiu had brought this object from somewhere, and his recent plight—constantly "faltering"—had been evident to all.

The Night Mist World was boundless, seemingly without end, filled with mystery, the unknown, and unpredictable horrors. Ancestor-level figures were not only cautious about the Great Desolation but also dared not let down their guard regarding the territories they already occupied. Within the existing human domain, there were still dangers they did not comprehend; even an Ancestor could perish with a slight misstep.

Thick dark clouds once again covered the magnificent plateau. All Ancestors, like radiant moons, slowly ascended, piercing through the clouds and vanishing from people’s sight.

The world turned as black as ink, returning to its original hue. The Ancestor-level figures had gone above the heavy clouds to negotiate. Without a grand battle, such tranquility would not have descended. Ultimately, strength compelled rationality.

Of course, sitting on the dark clouds to talk, the atmosphere could not be overly harmonious. After all, they had just engaged in a fierce, bloody battle, and everyone was injured. Occasionally, a dazzling light would still rip through the clouds—that was an Ancestor "slamming the table," like lightning streaking across the night sky.

"What, are you still trying to exert control? If it doesn’t work, let’s fight again! You kill yours, I kill mine, severing each other’s paths. No one gets off easy!"

Such voices clearly echoed from the depths of the clouds in the sky, like the Thunder God and Lightning Mother quarreling, shaking the firmament. Outside the plateau, many were terrified.

"Sun Taichu, you’re too hypocritical, wanting to have your cake and eat it too!"

Immediately, many Immortal Path disciples on the grassland quickly bowed their heads. Were such words meant for their ears? Everyone felt that the Ancestors of the New Life Path were too fierce, daring to utter anything.

"Cao, you little brat, go sit aside. You have no place to speak here. Even if you’re indignant, suppress it, or I’ll just make you disappear!"

From afar, people listened, dumbfounded. In truth, many didn’t want to hear the dialogue of the great figures, fearing great disaster. But who didn’t have curiosity? Information proactively bored into their ears; who didn’t want to delve into an Ancestor’s privacy?

"Lu Yu, are you threatening us?"

"Qingtian, have you been eating carrion lately? Your mouth is so venomous!"

"Rulai, it’s better for you to be mute. To suddenly chime in at a crucial moment and try to decide the fate for us?!"

Ancestors were human too; they were not transcendent during negotiations. In the dense night, clouds occasionally exploded, indicating the surging of Heavenly Force and consciousness auras.

"If we mutually dig up roots and sever young shoots, who fears whom? Our New Life Path has a large base and low threshold, but for you to find disciples with special endowments and even more powerful Immortal Seeds, that will be much more troublesome!"

At this moment, the Immortal Path Ancestors had a numerical advantage, but they found that the New Life Path Ancestors not only weren’t intimidated but were provocative, their eyes gleaming, morale high, as if eager to fight another round. Sun Taichu, Qian Jingxing, and others had to wonder again: Did someone on the opposing side truly forge a path, needing to die once and then be reborn? These people were lunatics!

Eventually, both sides largely reached an agreement. As for the minor bumps and stumbles during the process, they were nothing. Only Cao Qianqiu felt a knot in his heart, filled with resentment. Even during the negotiation, that old scoundrel Qingtian was "daily humiliating Cao."

"Cao Four, you only have less than half your cultivation and a little over forty percent of your pure Yang consciousness essence left. You’re not qualified to sit at our table."

On the grassland, people listened speechless. Old Cao was truly miserable, now bearing a new appellation bestowed by the New Life Path Ancestors. Undoubtedly, this was far worse than his previous title, "Cao Unbeatable."

The privacy of the great figures should not be excessively divulged. On the pitch-black cloud summit, a hazy light emanated, shrouding the area, and no more sounds escaped.

"Old Cao, it’s alright. Rest for a while, there’s still hope for everything," Sun Taichu comforted.

Cao Qianqiu was half-crippled, but Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan did not take excessive retaliatory actions. In truth, this blade should be sheathed. It shouldn't be revealed at this stage, especially with the Great Desolation approaching. Keeping it exposed would be bad for everyone.

"You are not righteous. I am an Ancestor, and after such an event, you don’t fight back? Did you just use me as a laborer before!" Cao Qianqiu said coldly.

Sun Taichu replied, "Old Cao, don’t think too much. After we return, you can choose any extraterrestrial divine objects or treasures from the depths of the Night Mist World. Perhaps you can recover in the future."

Zhao Wenhan also spoke, "Their research into 'rebirth' should have broken through inherent layers. Someone has forged a path. Those old fellows claim they’re about to die, but in reality, they all want to use us to temper themselves, to face death to live. We naturally cannot let them have their way. Brother Cao, you need to calm down."

The clouds dispersed, and those gentle great suns and bright moons all flew towards Kunleng City. Clearly, some matters still needed to be discussed with the Esoteric Sect.

On the grassland, Yuque longed to fly towards Qin Ming but, considering the circumstances, temporarily restrained itself. It wasn't strong enough yet and didn't want to be noticed by certain individuals, becoming a burden to the Mountain Lord.

"Princess, I think we should visit such a heaven-gifted individual afterward," Yuque urged the Purple Lightning Beast, hoping to reunite with the Mountain Lord through her.

"It’s strange, I feel he has a peculiar quality, as if we’ve interacted more than once before," the Purple Lightning Beast mumbled.

"That means you’re destined, you can become one of us!" Yuque said.

Many acquaintances wanted to see Qin Ming, but the occasion was unsuitable. There were simply too many people, making it difficult to approach him. Some others who had briefly met Qin Ming in the past were now incredibly shocked, finding it hard to believe he could reach such heights.

For example, Luo Yao, the white-clad girl from the Immortal Land, carefully stared at that figure, confirming it was the young man she had met at Black and White Mountain. She felt it was utterly preposterous! Back then, she and a green-clad woman had briefly stayed in Black and White Village, even jokingly telling the young man not to overthink it, as the distance between them was as vast as mountains and seas. How much time had passed? Half a year? Yet he had grown to this point. Luo Yao would only become an Immortal Seed in a few months, while he had already defeated two Immortal Seeds here.

Qin Ming sensed something and glanced over. In fact, he had seen Luo Yao at the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, but at that time, he was using the alias Qi Zizai and had defeated a group of challengers from the Outsider Immortal Land who practiced the New Life Path’s supreme art, the *Immortal Combat Scripture*.

"No, I have to go see him, get a closer look!" Luo Yao murmured to herself. Could this be a powerful prodigy comparable to her elder sister? Her sister had seized the greatest fortune of Black and White Mountain, and the "leftover scraps" she discarded had been picked up by Qin Ming.

"It's a pity my sister didn't come to Kunleng."

There were too many people around Qin Ming, and Luo Yao couldn’t push through, making it impossible to approach him for the time being.

Qin Ming smoothly obtained four portions of Auspicious Beast Blood. No one troubled him this time. After all, Pu Heng, who had initiated the earliest challenge, had already been crippled!

Qin Ming was surprised; each portion of Auspicious Beast Blood was ample, sealed within crystal chunks the size of a human head. Even for those with high cultivation, it was more than enough. Many gazed with fervent eyes at the four large crystals he had obtained. The blood within shimmered brilliantly, its golden radiance dispelling the night mist, like fragments of the blazing sun had been截取.

Qin Ming was very satisfied. It wasn't time to distribute the treasures yet, so he kept them all on his person. Many showed envious expressions. Qin Ming was now an incredibly dazzling new star on the New Life Path, and with Lu Zizai, Yu Gensheng, and Zhao Ziyuan accompanying him, no one dared to harbor ill intentions.

"Brother Ming!" Little Wu squeezed over. He had obtained two portions of Auspicious Beast Blood, which was enough for him.

On the grassland, the crowd dispersed, with most heading towards Kunleng City.

On that day, divine radiance blossomed from the Fourth Forbidden Land, and the ground had violently shaken. Some great figures from the Esoteric Sect had been seen there. Rumors spread that an old monster from the Immortal Path had gone to excavate that area, searching for something, leading to an inexplicable conflict. Ultimately, peace returned there, and the matter was left unresolved.

However, after some Esoteric Sect giants returned, their gazes towards the Immortal Path Ancestors were off, and the atmosphere became incredibly tense for a time. Especially since Lu Yu, the Contemporary Rulai, and Yuqing were all in Kunleng City, Ancestor Qingtian even explicitly called out, stating he could cooperate with the Esoteric Sect to take action together.

Qingtian said, "What? You’re just going to let it go like that? Esoteric Sect, I look down on you. Old monsters from the Immortal Path went to dig up your peerless mighty figures, and you’re just this cowardly!"

The Immortal Path people were displeased, seeing him sowing discord and stirring trouble. Fortunately, the Esoteric Sect people restrained themselves and turned the page. According to the Esoteric Sect giants, they had not suffered any losses.

When Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan learned of this, they both lamented that the Esoteric Sect and the Outsider Lands had truly profound and unfathomable foundations!

Qin Ming returned with them to the Mountain River Academy and settled in smoothly. Lu Zizai departed in a hurry, likely to meet with the various Ancestors. Currently, within Kunleng City, not only were Ancestors from the New Life Path, Esoteric Sect, and Outsider Lands gathered, but also extraordinary beings like the Six-Tusked Dragon Elephant and Purple Lightning Beast Ancestor had arrived. People felt that the Era of Grand Expansion might truly not be far off.

Not only that, it was rumored that an old Ancestor from the Ghost Path had also appeared that day, personally visiting Kunleng City, and even sect leaders from ancient divine immortal lineages had revived and rushed over. They had all emerged from the Yin Earth and mysterious Daoist sites because the Kunleng region was temporarily unsealed; they were ancient beings.

Undoubtedly, the paths in the world had therefore increased. For a time, winds and clouds from all directions converged upon Kunleng City. Ancestors from various paths met here to discuss important matters. Experts and elite disciples from each path naturally stayed, entering the city, making the already prosperous city even more lively. All inns were overflowing with people.

After Qin Ming returned to the Mountain River Academy, many wished to visit him. He also received a large pile of invitations, some from Divine Seeds of the Esoteric Sect and Immortal Seeds of the Outsider Lands, for a gathering of the Night Mist World’s top prodigies in the coming days. In addition, there were other invitations involving banquets, auctions, and other events attended by various famous figures.

Little Wu was also in the same situation, with various parties extending olive branches to him. He sighed, "I feel like I have too many things to do. All sorts of party invitations are pouring in."

Humans are social creatures, so Qin Ming and Little Wu naturally couldn’t seclude themselves. They certainly had to attend some invitations and events. With Ancestor-level figures now present, they weren’t afraid of anyone causing trouble here and wanted to broaden their horizons. However, these extraordinary gatherings definitely had priorities. Among these arrangements, there were people Qin Ming wanted to see, as well as activities he was passively attending.

He naturally had to see Li Qingyue, Ning Siqi, Xiang Yiwu, and others; even the top prodigy gathering had to take a backseat. At the same time, he wanted to know if Meng Xinghai and Old Master Li had come to Kunleng City, wanting to repay them with some generous gifts.

As for now, Qin Ming remained steadfast in his heart and went nowhere, diligently studying the *Geomagnetic Scripture* that Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan had given him—a cultivation method to which the two elders had devoted most of their lives. This system was very complete, with subsequent secret tomes building upon this miraculous *Geomagnetic Scripture*.

"Little Qin, the *Scripture of Wither and Flourish* has also been found!" Not long after, the two elders brought Qin Ming the miraculous scripture he had been longing for. Qin Ming had coveted this scripture for a long time. He had been excited when he obtained half of the Wither Scripture from the ghost cultivators, and only now had he received the complete version. This was primarily because, in his subsequent plans, this miraculous scripture was quite important for his cultivation in the Second Realm.

"Is there anything else you need? Just say the word!" Zhao Ziyuan said.

Qin Ming replied, "Seniors, no rush. This is Auspicious Beast Blood. Please take it first and see how much lifespan it can extend."

Yu Gensheng shook his head, saying, "We have taken similar miraculous blood elixirs before, so we might have drug resistance. Let's not waste it."

Qin Ming insisted, "This is Auspicious Beast Blood; it should be able to extend your life!"

...

In Kunleng City, many cultivators from various paths arrived, creating a rare opportunity for exchange. Though not deliberately organized, it was comparable to a grand convention.

At this time, there were naturally also those who were dejected. The most prominent among them, without a doubt, was Cao Qianqiu’s lineage. Old Cao was seething with unvented anger. Ancestors from various paths were discussing important matters, but he was excluded, unqualified to enter. This was mainly because the New Life Path Ancestors disliked him, and the Immortal Path people didn’t want to fight again because of him.

Cao Qianqiu’s eyes were icy. Sitting in a quiet room, he began to seriously contemplate a method of breaking and establishing, as he simply could not endure such a massive disparity. He couldn't even manage "out of sight, out of mind" because he had no way to leave immediately. He couldn’t return to the Pure Land alone, fearing assassination. In his current state, he had to travel with Sun Taichu and the others.

Pu Heng was utterly devastated. After being crippled, his entire essence, qi, and spirit were gone. His only hope was that his master could forge a path of destruction and rebirth to lead him back to prominence.

As for Li Qingxu, he was very calm, seemingly unaffected. This was because he had already been mocking himself, changing his name to Li Defeated. Having been beaten so much recently, his Dao heart had stabilized. He increasingly felt that for a person, breaking and then establishing was his great Dao.

"Absorb lessons, comprehend various scriptures, travel the world. Among three people walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher," Li Qingxu murmured to himself, his conviction firm.

When Cao Qianqiu heard this, even though he was generally good to his disciple, he couldn't help but want to beat him up. Such "three people walking together" made Old Cao feel humiliated, almost unbearable.

"Little Qin, he really exceeds my expectations, even more powerful than I imagined!" At this moment, Meng Xinghai arrived; he was also in Kunleng City. Moreover, he was currently traveling with Li Qingyun.

Although the Ancestor War had ended, many people were still eagerly discussing it. Besides the various Ancestors, Lu Zizai and Qin Ming, who had uniquely obtained four portions of Auspicious Beast Blood, were also focal points of discussion.

"This Qin Ming defeated two Immortal Seeds in the mid-stage of the Second Realm while only in its early stage. His stunning performance is beyond doubt. I’m afraid people in the same realm will find it hard to restrain him!"

"Do you think Cui Chonghe in the same tier can suppress him?"

"We’ll only know after they fight."

From the New Life Path to the Immortal Path, and then to the Esoteric Path, many mentioned him. Even his competitors wore extremely serious expressions, studying him.

"No need to worry, you are overthinking," said Mu Qingfeng, a renowned figure of the Immortal Path. His status was extraordinary; he was a direct disciple of an Ancestor. He said, "He won’t become your competitor."

"Hmm, that’s right!" Many suddenly realized.

Mu Qingfeng continued, "He is a person of the New Life Path. He rose quickly in his early years. However, now that he has entered the Second Realm—Outward Manifestation—it’s like a true dragon being shackled, or a phoenix having its wings clipped. It can no longer fly so high or so fast, only slowly making its way on the ground." As a direct disciple of an Ancestor, his words naturally carried weight. He said, "What does a 'newborn' rely on? They have to endure through the years. He completed the First Realm in seven or eight months, but next, he will sink into a quagmire, stagnating for a very long time."

Then, Mu Qingfeng smiled, "Even if he is remarkable now, his ultimate competitors will not be you, but your juniors." He jokingly added that if they didn’t believe him, they could bet with him. Even if Qin Ming’s talent was exceptional, he would have to accept this cruel reality. Mu Qingfeng concluded, "Forget within a few months, even in the coming year, or even several years, Qin Ming will find it difficult to break through a realm!"

At Mountain River Academy, Qin Ming was also pondering this issue. He had a clear understanding of himself and murmured, "My cultivation speed cannot slow down. I must maintain it!"
