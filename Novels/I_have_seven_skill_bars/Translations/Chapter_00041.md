# Chapter 41: Equipment

"What is it, what is it?" Ma Wen didn't bother with modesty, quickly leaning into Ding Rui's ear to ask.

Ding Rui smiled, "Brother Ma, don't be in such a hurry. Answer a few questions for me first."

"Ask away, ask away," Ma Wen said eagerly.

"Why do other cultivators ride you guys?" Ding Rui asked.

"Because we run fast, of course!" Ma Wen replied.

"I know, I know. What I mean is, since you run fast, what problem can you help other cultivators solve?" Ding Rui was serious.

"Solving their problem of not being able to run fast," Ma Wen replied even more seriously.

"..." Ding Rui thought about it. It seemed there was nothing wrong with that answer.

"Let's put it this way," Ding Rui said. "Other cultivators need your help to reach places they can't get to quickly on their own. Only with your speed can this be achieved. But, have any cultivators ever said that riding you is uncomfortable, that the wind is too strong, it's too shaky, or unsafe, and that they have to hold on tightly to avoid falling off?"

Ma Wen immediately nodded, "Yes, they have! And you human cultivators are still okay, but other cultivators can't ride us at all. Like the chicken cultivators, for example, they can't stand steadily. It's more convenient for them to fly themselves, even if they don't fly as fast as us."

"And once those problems are gone, won't you be able to run even faster? You'll be able to better meet your customers' needs, and then you'll be able to do even more business, won't you?"

After listening, Ma Wen's eyes darted around, and he immediately nodded vigorously. "Absolutely! If that's truly possible, business would be booming! Do you have a way?"

"Of course I do! But I have to try it first; right now, it's just an idea," Ding Rui said.

"Then hurry up and try it!" Ma Wen urged, his hind hooves already impatiently tapping and scuffing.

"Of course. I called you over today precisely for this. But I have to state upfront that I can't be one hundred percent certain. We'll need to work together and research it for a while," Ding Rui said.

"No problem!" Ma Wen nodded.

"Also!" Ding Rui said with a smile. "During this period, you might not be able to do business at noon, and I'll also have to take some time out of my midday to help solve your problem. I'll be incurring a loss too. So, if it works out in the end, and the results are really good, I'll need to take a small portion of spirit rice!"

Ma Wen's ears perked up, and he immediately became wary. "How much?"

"It won't take too much of your time. Maybe we'll just need a little bit of time to make a tool. Brother Ma, come with me."

Ding Rui ran to the 377 Spirit Field and picked up an ordinary knife used by the spirit field cultivators to make furniture and other items. He then led Ma Wen to a small grove.

Ever since his first time riding Ma Wen, these ideas had frequently popped into Ding Rui's mind.

How could one ride a horse without tools?

For example, a saddle.

The purpose of a saddle is to protect the rider from falling off, help maintain balance, and greatly enhance riding comfort, allowing a person to sit on the horse's back more safely and for longer periods.
