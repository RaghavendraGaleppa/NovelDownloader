# Chapter 6: Top Scholar

Half an hour later...

Staring at his reddened and slightly swollen fist, Zhou Qing wished he could slap himself. He shouldn't have been so curious about testing the power of the "Black Tiger Steals the Heart" technique.

Although the move was indeed powerful—enough to knock down an average adult man, leaving them either writhing in pain or bedridden for days—Zhou Qing had forgotten one crucial principle in his excitement: the reciprocal nature of force.

His hands, unaccustomed to rigorous martial training, were still soft and delicate. The bones of a young man weren't particularly sturdy either. Thus, when he tested the technique on a soft wooden board, tragedy struck. The board shattered under his punch, but the recoil left him grimacing in pain.

"At least it's just swollen and not cut," Zhou Qing consoled himself.

He reflected on his impulsiveness. The thrill of mastering the "Black Tiger Steals the Heart" technique had clouded his judgment, making him overlook the hardness of his own fists.

Still, there was a silver lining. The test proved the technique's effectiveness—with this move, he could unexpectedly take down a burly man. However, for actual combat, this alone wasn't enough. Fighting required both lethality and distance control. The crude footwork accompanying the Black Tiger Fist was barely useful, inferior even to the steps from the Deer Play of the Five Animals Exercises.

Zhou Qing pondered how to integrate the Deer Play's footwork with the Black Tiger Fist. For now, his best plan was to combine the fist techniques with the Tiger Play's power generation, evolving the latter into a form of Tiger Fist.

His training regimen was clear: first fists, then legs. The Tiger Play would strengthen his body over time, making his bones and muscles tougher, ensuring that future tests wouldn't leave his fists swollen. It was no wonder martial arts emphasized physical conditioning—without a strong body, even the most potent techniques would harm the user as much as the opponent.

Zhou Qing mused that this was likely why weapons were favored in combat: they delivered powerful strikes without causing self-injury.

Once he moved to a more spacious residence, preferably a courtyard house, he could consider training with weapons. To live longer and delve into the mystical, he couldn't rely on others for safety—self-improvement was essential. Moreover, the world's lawlessness made encounters with bandits a real danger during travels.

In the following days, Zhou Qing continued teaching at the village school in Hu Village in the mornings. In the afternoons, Hu Mo, the blacksmith, was absent. Rumor had it he had closed his shop and ventured into the mountains with a bow and a cleaver to gather herbs. The Western Mountains stretched for hundreds of miles, and herb-gathering trips often lasted weeks.

Villagers wondered why Hu Mo, a lame man with some martial skills, would risk such a journey. As a bachelor with no dependents and a steady income from his smithy and teaching, he could have lived comfortably without such risks.

Zhou Qing suspected it was related to the obscure ancient characters Hu Mo had asked him to decipher. "Perhaps he obtained some martial arts manual and, after understanding those characters, is now preparing to train with herbs from the mountains," he thought.

Though curious, Zhou Qing refrained from prying. Life taught him not to covet everything—what suited him was best. One should only bite off what they could chew.

In the afternoon, Zhou Qing returned to the city and borrowed ointment for bruises and swelling from a pharmacy called Jishi Hall. The owner, Manager Han, knowing Zhou Qing was now a village teacher, trusted him to repay the debt even if he failed the imperial exams.

Back home, Zhou Qing applied the ointment and considered its effects. "If this promotes blood circulation, practicing the Five Animals Exercises might enhance its absorption," he reasoned. He proceeded to train, starting with the full set before focusing on the Tiger Play.

As he moved through the forms, Zhou Qing felt a familiar warmth in his body. This time, instead of dispersing, the heat concentrated in his fists, merging with the ointment's cooling effect. A vigorous sweat broke out.

After finishing, Zhou Qing examined his fist—the swelling had subsided, and it felt stronger. The ointment had turned dark and foul-smelling, indicating the expulsion of stagnant blood.

"This heat, combined with the medicine, accelerates healing and strengthens my body," he realized. Unlike external martial arts that hardened the body at the cost of damage, this method enhanced his right fist internally—a far superior approach.

"This confirms that the heat generated by the Five Animals Exercises improves my physique. With medicinal aid, the enhancement is even greater. Injuries also trigger the heat's healing properties."

This wasn't solely due to the exercises; the "Everlasting Life Master" played a role. Though the improvements were gradual, their cumulative effect was significant. Checking the Everlasting Life Master, Zhou Qing saw his remaining lifespan remained at thirty years—a rough estimate, suggesting no qualitative leap yet.

Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Qing acknowledged a new expense: medicine. With it, his training progress would accelerate, and the Black Tiger Fist's power would increase without self-harm.

Money was the recurring theme—studying, martial arts, and health all required funds. A tranquil environment was also essential. The cramped space at home hindered his Tiger Play training; practicing outdoors was unsafe and risky.

Ten days passed swiftly. Zhou Qing taught by day, using calligraphy to calm his mind. Evenings were dedicated to the Five Animals Exercises and the Black Tiger Steals the Heart. His teaching was efficient and tailored, leveraging his sharp memory to track each student's progress. For the unruly, he employed his newfound tiger-like aura to intimidate them.

The villagers noticed the students' improved demeanor. Zhou Qing avoided fostering bookworms—he explained meanings vividly, told stories, and encouraged critical thinking. One day, he recounted the tale of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains. When a student questioned whether the descendants would continue the task, Zhou Qing likened the mountain gods to local bullies. The story, he explained, symbolized resistance against oppression—history and myths often concealed deeper truths beneath their surfaces.

He knew most students wouldn't pass the imperial exams, but understanding life's lessons from classical texts would benefit them regardless. Teaching wasn't just about livelihood skills—it was about nurturing minds. Grateful for the village's support during his hardships, Zhou Qing aimed to inspire independent thinking in his students.

Suddenly, Butcher Hu arrived, beaming. "Congratulations, Young Master Zhou!" The students were puzzled until he announced, "No classes this afternoon—we're feasting! Young Master Zhou has topped the prefectural exams, earning a stipend at the state academy!"

The students erupted in excitement. Their teacher, orphaned and alone, had not only passed but achieved the highest honor. At under fifteen, Zhou Qing was a prodigy—his fame would spread across provinces.

Zhou Qing remained composed, dismissing the class. As he stepped out, the threshold cracked under his foot—a moment of unintentional exuberance that amused everyone. The air was jubilant.

That night, surrounded by gifts in his once-bare home, Zhou Qing felt a rare contentment. Neighbors had wanted to decorate his house festively, but he declined, citing his mourning period. Smiling, he reveled in his success—the path ahead was now clearer. With his worries dispelled, he celebrated privately.

Later, invigorated by his joy, Zhou Qing practiced the Five Animals Exercises with unprecedented fluidity, especially the Tiger Play. As he finished, a surge of warmth coursed through him, more potent than before. Checking the Everlasting Life Master, he saw his lifespan had increased to thirty-one years, and the Tiger Play had advanced from "basic" to "proficient."

Relieved, Zhou Qing affirmed: the Five Animals Exercises truly nurtured life and extended longevity.
