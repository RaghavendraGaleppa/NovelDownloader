# Chapter 224: Spiritual Qi Like a Sea

The Dragon Scale Armor was a Grade 8 Divine Weapon and naturally paid no mind to the struggles of the Grade 7 Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel. With the Calm Mind State stabilizing his heart, the encirclement trajectories of the seven skeletal war souls suddenly decomposed in his vision.

The wielder of the broken halberd on the left front stepped in harmony with the Celestial Pivot position, while the holder of the残剑 on the right rear牵引 the Earthly Evil. Seven strands of煞气 locked down all eight directions of retreat like the Big Dipper.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flickered, and in an instant, he understood. These seven skeletons were treading upon the Big Dipper formation from the Heavenly Artificer Forging Technique.

The Seven Stars Treading on the Dipper—the flaw lay in the摇光 (Yao Guang) star.

Xu Yunfan’s foot arches and tendons trembled like a dragon vein, and the Hundred-Forged Steel Body emitted a ringing sound of metal.

His left shoulder blade violently shifted three inches, his entire arm instantly transforming into a nine-foot-long whip. The Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel, wrapped in wind and thunder, smashed toward the southeast corner of the altar.

Before the heavy cudgel arrived, the shockwave it stirred had already compressed the air within thirty feet into a thick, viscous state. The Dragon Scale Armor glimmered with a faint red light.

Nine Changes Return to Origin, Mountain Shattering Stance.

Lightning patterns on the cudgel body lit up one after another, nine spiral forces converging at the tip.

The moment the shield-bearing skeleton attempted to block, the heavy cudgel passed around the shield face at an impossible angle, brushing past the edge of the bone shield and detonating seven layers of shockwaves.

The ghostfire in the skeleton's eye sockets shook violently, and red flames shot out from the gaps in its bones—this was the distinct Marrow Burning characteristic of the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel.

But Xu Yunfan’s killing move was the follow-up.

When his right foot stomped the ground, the earth within a thirty-foot radius surged like waves, and the scales on the waist and abdomen of the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly stood erect.

Using the rebound force, the muscle groups of his shoulders and back collided like tectonic plates, and his entire spine exploded with a crisp sound like a bowstring snapping.

The Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel, its momentum未尽, forcibly changed direction. The hook at the end of the handle struck upward toward the skeleton's throat like a venomous dragon swinging its tail.

*Crack!*

The bone shield shattered into dust instantly, and the lingering force of the cudgel wind截断 three ancient trees at their waists.

Xu Yunfan, however, used the rebound force to leap into the air. The Hundred-Forged Steel Body twisted into a strange arc mid-air, the joints of his body exploding in sound like a string of firecrackers.

The Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel划出 a perfect crescent moon trajectory; the lightning patterns on the cudgel head even sparked流火 due to high-speed friction.

The seven skeletons' joint attack formation was forcibly torn open.

The Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength within Xu Yunfan’s body circulated frantically through his muscles, bones, and skin. As the Dragon Scale Armor was喷涌 with blood energy, the armor scales spontaneously泛起 a red heat, and finally, a stream of flame拖出 a ten-zhang-long trail behind him.

When the heavy cudgel touched the second skeleton's chest bone, he suddenly withdrew seventy percent of his force. The tendons in his foot arches coiled like a spring, and his shoulder blade shifted three inches to make space for the force.

*Boom!*

A seemingly light touch was actually compressing nine layers of shock force into a square inch of space.

Spiderweb cracks first appeared on the skeleton's chest bone, then a red pillar of flame炸开 from within.

Xu Yunfan’s figure moved like a phantom through the rain of fire. The Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel would sometimes turn into a spear to刺命门, sometimes turn into a棍 to sweep a thousand soldiers. The nine basic cudgel techniques were浑然天成 in the Calm Mind State, with no wasted movements.

When the seventh skeleton's skull was crushed by the cudgel wind, the Qiu Long Ding on the altar suddenly trembled.

The pitch-black Xuan Ming True Water surged out along the cracks in the cauldron body, actually producing a strange resonance with the lightning and fire of the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel.

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt his palm scalding hot. Looking down, he saw the lightning patterns on the cudgel body frantically devouring the black water. The originally red cudgel body gradually revealed dark golden patterns.

It seemed to be补全 the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel, washing away the fierce and murderous aura of the凶兵.

"Interesting..."

Xu Yunfan raised his head to look at the sky. The rift that had caused him to fall had long since vanished without a trace.

Exiting the Calm Mind State, Xu Yunfan looked at the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel in his hand, which was still struggling and humming, yet firmly suppressed by the Dragon Scale Armor.

"...You really are a贱皮子 (masochist)."

Xu Yunfan sighed with emotion. Since the Hundred-Forged Steel Case had been shattered by the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel, Xu Yunfan simply used the Dragon Scale Armor leaves to open and clamp the cudgel body.

It was actually much more stable than before.

Only then did Xu Yunfan have the time to glance at the information prompts appearing in his vision.

`You have successfully slain the War Soul Tomb Guardian, your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Technique has increased significantly.`

`You...`

A dozen consecutive proficiency increase prompts made Xu Yunfan unable to help but beam with joy.

He was now only two hundred and twenty-three proficiency points away from the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Technique reaching Great Perfection.

"The Divine Weapon Secret Realm..."

Xu Yunfan had clearly heard Zhan Yan's exclamation in the cave of the Divine Weapon Valley earlier.

He was even more surprised in his heart. He had never imagined that the Divine Weapon Ridge would possess a Secret Realm comparable to the six great sects of Great Zhou.

From what Pei Yan and Qi Huan had said before, the True Origin Sect's True Origin Secret Realm had a rich atmosphere of Heaven and Earth's Primordial Spirit. Cultivating within it allowed one to truly experience the cultivation speed of the true golden age two thousand years ago.

Although in this era of Declining Law, the Primordial Spirit Qi in the Secret Realm was like duckweed, decreasing as it was used.

The accumulation from two years ago was still a truly vast amount.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. Without even needing to deliberately guide the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, those Primordial Spirit Qi continuously钻ed into his body.

`Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Technique has increased.`

Seeing a message float up in his vision, Xu Yunfan immediately gave up the idea of finding a way back immediately, deciding to find a place to cultivate for a while first.

He did not hesitate, sitting cross-legged before the Qiu Long Ding. The blood energy that had yet to settle still扩散着 a scorching heat, and the暗金 soil beneath his butt sizzled under the炙烤 of his body temperature.

He deliberately slowed his breathing frequency, circulating the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, allowing the Pure Yang Internal Qi to form a large cycle within his body.

A vortex gradually formed between his nose and mouth.

The thick Primordial Spirit Qi in the surroundings was like a hundred rivers returning to the sea. As it poured into his lungs through the nasal cavity, it actually发出 a rumble like a bellows鼓动.

The key points of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique were the three words 'Swallow, Transform, and Fuse'.

At this moment, there was no need for deliberate guidance. The Primordial Spirit Qi rushing into his body collided with the Pure Yang Internal Qi flowing through his flesh and blood, immediately like pouring hot oil onto a raging fire, rapidly boiling.

Xu Yunfan clearly felt his twelve pairs of ribs opening and closing like furnace grates, and the Dragon of his spine trembling节节, pumping the refined internal Qi into his tendons and membranes.

*Crack!*

His shoulder blade suddenly shifted half an inch, and the Hundred-Forged Steel Body automatically adjusted its load-bearing structure.

The Red Flood Dragon scales on the surface of the Dragon Scale Armor stood erect like逆鳞,导出 the excessive Primordial Spirit Qi outside his body, forming a three-zhang Red Flame Ring around Xu Yunfan.

He simply abandoned the orthodox sitting posture,反手握住了 the handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, and stimulated his blood energy with the starting stance of the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer.

The moment the hammer head touched the ground, the earth within a fifty-foot radius collapsed with a boom.

Xu Yunfan’s foot arches and tendons turned over like an蛟龙, his feet sinking three inches into the rock layer. His waist and hips twisted, bringing up a hammer wind like a tornado.

The Primordial Spirit Qi that originally required thirty-six cycles to be transformed was now forcibly pressed into his flesh and blood under the violent hammer momentum.

The hammer wind swept over the inverted waterfall; the逆流 ice crystals汽化成雾 before they could fall.

White mist喷吐ed from Xu Yunfan’s pores, and the distinct spiral strength of the Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength surged between his tendons.

The instant the Pure Yang Internal Qi and Red Flood Dragon Strength fused, golden sparks exploded before Xu Yunfan’s eyes.

The Dragon of his spine suddenly arched up like a full moon, and the two hundred and six bones of his body爆响 simultaneously.
