# Chapter 53: The Fall of the Corpse Demon

"This... seems to be a sword cultivator from the Five Elements Peak of Mount Shu?"

Jiang Li stepped forward to examine the body. The cultivator's robes were nearly identical to Yin Qiu's, except for an additional small sword emblem on the chest. The corpse appeared pale and withered, but aside from four bloody holes in the neck, the rest of the body remained remarkably intact without any obvious external injuries.

At that moment, the riverbed beneath the sword cultivator's corpse began to ripple slightly. 

Jiang Li's heart stirred—he knew the tree roots from the graveyard below were about to surface to collect the body. 

The black zombie quickly acted, using its still-intact arm to grab the corpse and drag it aside. 

The riverbed's movement soon ceased, and the roots didn't emerge. It seemed that, like with the black zombie, as long as the corpse remained in motion, the roots below wouldn't react to it.

Dragging the sword cultivator's body, Jiang Li had the black zombie pick up the flying sword along the way. He then controlled the zombie to open the coffin lid and placed both the sword and the corpse inside.

Huh?

Jiang Li watched as the sword cultivator's body was placed into the coffin, only to vanish the moment it touched the bottom. 

What... was going on? 

Did the coffin just... eat the corpse?

Wait, no! 

This was the world of cultivation. Could it be that this thing contained a spatial dimension?

Jiang Li suddenly grew excited. Spatial artifacts were incredibly valuable. 

From what he knew, even Golden Core stage elders might not necessarily possess storage treasures—they were that rare and precious.

After a moment's thought, the black zombie gripped the coffin's edge and flipped inside. 

The instant its back touched the coffin's base, the surroundings abruptly changed. The cramped space, barely large enough for one person to lie flat, transformed into an empty rectangular area—eight meters long, four meters wide, and four meters high. 

It was roughly the size of a small classroom. The sword cultivator's corpse and the damaged flying sword lay to one side. 

A quick glance revealed that most of the coffin's interior was flooded with river water. A few ghost lantern fish had somehow entered and swam lazily, providing a relatively stable light source. 

A pile of miscellaneous items of unknown origin sat in a corner, appearing quite aged. 

Just as Jiang Li, driven by treasure-hunting instincts, was about to inspect them— 

*Bzzzt—bzzzt—*

A sensation akin to a poor signal disrupted the Five Divine Senses connection. The link became unstable, and large portions of the shared vision vanished!

Damn it! 

The spatial artifact had shielding properties!

Before the connection was completely severed, Jiang Li hastily controlled the black zombie to climb out of the coffin.

---

Fortunately, this thing was unclaimed. Otherwise, it would have been like walking into a trap. 

Feeling the restored connection, Jiang Li let out a sigh of relief. 

By now, more and more cultivator corpses had fallen into the river. 

Guided by the core principle of cultivation—*never pass up free advantages*—Jiang Li dragged the coffin around, collecting bodies. 

However, unlike the sword cultivator who had landed nearby, the other corpses were scattered unpredictably, most of them far apart. 

Coupled with the increasing turbidity of the water due to the black blood from the dead zombies and the roots' swift retrieval speed, Jiang Li often couldn't react in time. 

After managing to snag only three corpses by sheer luck, he finally gave up and began moving downstream with the coffin, gradually distancing himself from the battlefield.

---

Above the river, the battle had reached its climax. 

Initially, when the Golden Core Corpse Demon had first emerged, its might was overwhelming, but its energy expenditure was equally immense. 

It had used corpse poison multiple times, been pierced by flying swords, and even spat out its core for an attack. 

Most notably, when countering the Five Elements Sword Formation, the massive surge of corpse energy it released was akin to a cultivator forcibly burning their cultivation—a self-destructive move with severe consequences. 

Though it had hordes of zombies assisting, those zombies couldn't fly. 

After the battle shifted to higher altitudes, the Golden Core Corpse Demon found itself fighting hundreds of cultivators alone. 

Lacking the intelligence to assess the situation, it was easily overwhelmed, exposing more weaknesses as it relied solely on instinct. Its yin energy drained like floodwaters through an open sluice, and its accumulating injuries worsened rapidly. 

As time passed, nearly fifty Foundation Establishment cultivators fell, but the Core Formation experts finally seized an opportunity to deal a critical blow to the Corpse Demon. 

*(Note: False Core, True Core, and Golden Core all fall under Core Formation.)*

By now, the Corpse Demon's aura had weakened drastically. Everything below its waist had vanished, leaving a gaping wound in its abdomen where dangling, nonfunctional organs swayed grotesquely. 

This was the result of a full-powered secret technique unleashed by the Five Elements Peak's leading elder from Mount Shu, supported by the others—though at the cost of temporarily losing combat capability. 

The sect elders and a rogue False Core cultivator surrounding the Corpse Demon were also battered, their wounds tainted with black, foul-smelling poison that slowly spread, testing their endurance to the limit.

---

If they attacked now, they could easily finish off the Corpse Demon. 

Yet they hesitated, held back by caution. 

The Golden Core Corpse Demon, seemingly aware of its impending doom, kept its final trump card—the core—tucked in its mouth, ready to spit it out at any moment. 

In their current state, none of the cultivators could withstand such an attack. Whoever struck first would likely perish alongside it. 

Elder Weng Sanqi was frustrated. Even one remaining puppet would have made a difference at this point. 

But then, his pallid face—drained from blood loss and poison—suddenly lit up with ecstasy. 

The other cultivators, however, reacted with complex expressions, mostly tinged with worry and apprehension. 

Because on the distant horizon, a flying ship was rapidly approaching, growing larger by the second. 

As it drew near, the red pavilion emblem on its hull became clear—this was a vessel from the Scripture Storage Valley! 

"Insolent Corpse Demon! How dare you wreak havoc!" 

Arrays lit up across the ship as the cultivators aboard channeled terrifying spiritual energy, capable of annihilating everyone present with a single strike. 

"Elder Duan! Don't damage the core!" Elder Weng shouted urgently. Being fellow elders of Scripture Storage Valley, he naturally recognized the newcomer. 

"Understood!" 

Two beams of white spiritual energy shot from the ship's bow. 

One struck the river, instantly freezing a vast expanse of water and zombies alike. 

The other hit the Corpse Demon, flash-freezing both its half-remaining body and the core it had just spat out into an ice sculpture! 

With the Golden Core Corpse Demon finally slain, the division of spoils was no longer Jiang Li's concern. 

By now, he had already traveled far downstream to a minor tributary of the Mazu River. There, he flung out a broken chain, hauling an ancient coffin up from the riverbed.
