# Chapter 307: Marrow Cleansing Complete

Xu Yunfan grinned, casually patting the bow's body. "This bow has quite the temper. It thinks I'm unworthy of it. No matter, it's a divine weapon; it needs its spirit tempered. Give me some time, and after I 'discipline' it properly, it'll naturally behave."

For divine weapons like this, as long as one frequently infused it with strength or even pure Yang true qi to cleanse it, it would eventually be easily controlled. As for whether it would completely acknowledge him as its master, Xu Yunfan didn't care.

A forcibly picked fruit isn't sweet, but it quenches the thirst.

Moreover, he had a vague feeling that the quality of the Void-Piercing Cloud Cleaver Bow was likely the best in the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss. Given time, it might truly nurture its own spirit, undergo a qualitative transformation as a weapon, and advance once more to become an eighth-grade divine weapon.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but clench his five fingers, his knuckles tapping against the cold iron body of the Void-Piercing Cloud Cleaver Bow, producing a clear, resonant clang.

The more he looked at it, the more he liked it. Bows of this divine caliber were rare in the world and truly extraordinary. He patted this unruly divine weapon without a care. "You arrogant thing, you think I'm not good enough for you?"

The bow's body trembled, spitting out three or two sparks, as if responding to his provocation.

"We have plenty of time..." Xu Yunfan muttered to himself.

"Every day, I'll cleanse you with pure Yang true qi. In battle, I'll sharpen you with the blood of enemies. Let's see if your bow spirit is tougher, or my fists are harder!"

Bi Yuan, upon hearing this, had his wide sleeves stir without wind. A look of admiration, like viewing uncut jade, flashed in his eyes, and he slightly nodded. "Good, you have courage."

Cui Yu deeply looked at Xu Yunfan and said in a low voice, "Both divine weapons are extraordinary, especially the Void-Piercing Cloud Cleaver Bow... If you can truly tame it, it will surely become a great killing weapon in the future."

Bi Yuan hadn't expected that Xu Yunfan would be able to pull out two extraordinary divine weapons in one go.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan wore the Dragon Scale Armor with its faint dark light, the Blazing Python Cudgel coiled on his back, and the patterns on the Mountain Shaking Hammer at his waist seemed to have the flow of earth veins. Now, with this fierce bow added, he was a walking arsenal.

Truly luxurious!

Even Shen Wuya, the Vice Sect Master who had been standing silently by, looked at him and, without a word, turned and walked away.

Since the founding of the Dao Sect, who has ever managed to gather four or five divine weapons on their person...

Do you even have enough hands to use them all?

"..."

A full month had passed since entering the Sword Burial Abyss, and Xu Yunfan still hadn't relaxed in the slightest.

On this day, before dawn, the fierce winds at the mountain's peak were like blades.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the Black Jade Terrace. The blood qi steaming around his body condensed into a red mist in the cold wind.

His eyes were tightly shut, his spine undulating like a dragon. A rumbling like a surging river echoed from within his body. As the *Scripture of Marrow Cleansing* was pushed to its limit, the golden marrow throughout his body began to churn. Since yesterday, the marrow in his body had been washed by his劲力 (jìnlì - strength/power), transforming one by one into golden marrow.

Xu Yunfan's entire skeleton seemed to be forged by an invisible giant hammer, emitting the sound of clanging metal amidst high-frequency vibrations.

The surging medicinal power from the Golden Marrow Tempering Pill he had swallowed earlier had transformed into a thousand purple streams. As they surged along with the blood qi and strength propelled by the *Scripture of Marrow Cleansing*, they burrowed into the bone crevices like living things.

If someone with the Eye of Heaven could observe it, they would surely find that where the purple medicinal streams passed, fine thunder patterns would appear on the bone surface. Fine, hair-like purple lightning would erupt from deep within the marrow cavity, refining the originally turbid marrow浆 (jiāng - pulp/fluid) into a brilliant golden color.

This was the embryonic form of the "Golden Body" recorded in the scriptures of the Maitreya Temple. The Buddhist sect calls it "Vajra Body," while the Dao Sect calls it "Jade Bone."

At this moment, every bone in his body was like black iron tempered by thunder and fire a thousand times. When his marrow flowed, it actually brought forth the sound of wind and thunder.

Occasionally, stray purple lightning would shoot out from his body's surface, drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy of heaven and earth and turning it into wisps of arc lightning that flickered around him.

'You continue to cultivate, aided by the medicinal power of the Golden Marrow Tempering Pill and supported by the medicinal power of the Ten Thousand Year Ginseng King. Your proficiency in the Scripture of Marrow Cleansing has increased.'

'You continue to cultivate...'

Watching the proficiency prompts pop up on his vision from time to time, Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath and glanced at the proficiency of the Scripture of Marrow Cleansing on his attribute panel.

He was just three points short of the thousand-point proficiency required for completion.

Three months of day and night hard training had allowed the Dragon Tiger Breathing Technique and the Eight Wastes Dragon Fall Cudgel Method to both step into the minor success stage, but it was the Scripture of Marrow Cleansing that he had practiced most diligently.

Three months of sleepless, bitter cultivation had long since made Xu Yunfan's blood qi boil like magma.

At this moment, he sat cross-legged on the Black Jade Terrace at the peak of Qingwei Mountain. Blue veins coiled like dragon under his skin. Every breath drew in the thin spiritual energy of heaven and earth, blending it with the surging medicinal power within his body.

As the *Scripture of Marrow Cleansing* was pushed to its absolute limit, he let out a low shout. Instantly, a dense series of "crackling" sounds erupted from his skeleton, like thousands of jade pearls falling to the ground, or like the clanging of metal.

'Your Scripture of Marrow Cleansing has reached Great Completion.'

With a message prompt appearing in his vision.

An immense, warm current, vast as the ocean, was born instantly within Xu Yunfan's body, filling his four limbs and hundred bones.

Under the warm currents generated by the attribute panel, his bones were repeatedly hammered by an invisible heavy hammer. The originally dense bone quality shattered inch by inch, then rapidly reformed under the embrace of his blood qi and pure Yang true qi.

A淡金色 (dànjīnsè - light golden) marrow fluid seeped from deep within the bone marrow. Wherever it passed, fine, mysterious patterns appeared on the bone surface, resembling star charts or talismans. This was the标志 (biāozhì - sign/mark) of the Great Completion of "Jade Marrow Golden Bones."

His skeleton suddenly erupted with a series of popping sounds, like frying beans, actually producing a clear, echoing resonance like bells and chimes.

With such density, it was likely that even a treasure artifact would struggle to leave a mark if it slashed at him.

Xu Yunfan was inwardly shocked. No wonder the Maitreya Temple's Scripture of Marrow Cleansing was known as the foremost marrow cleansing technique; for hundreds of years, no one could compete with it. Just by relying on this Golden Body, one could fight bare-handed against a treasure artifact.

He now finally believed the story Li Haomiao had told him about an old monk from the Maitreya Temple shattering a divine weapon with his bare hands.

He slowly rose. As his limbs stretched, his spine arched like a dragon's spine, capable of twisting to incredible angles according to the moves, yet snapping straight in an instant when force was applied, transmitting power throughout his body without any obstruction.

The broken bone stubs within his body healed in an instant under the scouring of his blood qi. The newly formed bone膜 (mó - membrane) shimmered with an amber luster, hiding vitality within, making his blood qi even more浓厚 (nónghòu - thick/dense).

Marrow generates blood power; the blood transformed from golden marrow now carried a hint of crimson gold.

What caught Xu Yunfan's attention most was that the cleansing effect after Great Completion had made his perception completely surpass the mortal boundary.

The trajectory of a flying insect's wings a hundred zhang away was clearly discernible; he could even see the faint purple halo of flowing spiritual energy.

The rustling of mountain wind passing through pine needles, the rustling of earthworms burrowing three zhang underground, even the rumbling of his own blood rushing through his veins—if he listened with a calm heart, they were all as distinct as drumbeats.

Xu Yunfan's nostrils flared slightly. The lingering medicinal scent from the pill he had taken, the earthy smell from underground, the scent of metal rust... thousands of scents were decomposed into independent threads. He could even smell the sandalwood fragrance lingering on the sleeves of Senior Sister Qingluan from three days ago.

Thoughts arose in his heart. He extended a fingertip and lightly touched the stone platform, surprisingly able to perceive the edges of the quartz particles within the rock. The sensitivity of his skin to changes in airflow had reached a level where he could predict the trajectory of an opponent's moves.
