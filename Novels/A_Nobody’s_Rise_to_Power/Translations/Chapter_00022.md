# Chapter 22: He Arrives Bathed in Light

Yu Huanhu clasped his fists and gave a sweeping bow to the crowd, his voice clear and resonant. "For the past few years, because of my elder brother's minor illness, he has entrusted me, Huanhu, with the management of six manor estates, over fifty thousand mu of fertile farmland, and three pastures."

"Since taking over these properties, I have been diligent and cautious, not daring to be the least bit negligent."

"The harvests from these manors and pastures under my management are clear to every branch and lineage. I, Yu Huanhu, have not failed the Yu family."

"Today, to avoid suspicion, I, Huanhu, will return all these properties to my elder brother."

"The tenant farmers and retainers attached to these manors and pastures will also be returned along with them."

"Huanhu will henceforth live in seclusion in 'Dailai City' and will no longer meddle in the family's affairs."

A uproar instantly swept through the hall at these words.

Yu Xinglong's expression changed, and he hurriedly tried to dissuade him. "Second Brother, is this truly necessary? Is this truly necessary?"

"I only wish to uncover the truth behind my son Ye's death; I never suspected you. Why must you..."

Yu Huanhu cut him off. "Elder Brother, I naturally trust you. But, rumors are a terrible thing!"

Yu Huanhu sneered, casting a glance at Suo Hong, and raised his voice. "Now, since someone claims I schemed to murder the Yu family's eldest heir for my own selfish gain, then I will proactively return these properties and live in seclusion in Dailai City. Surely this can prove Huanhu's innocence? Hah, hahaha..."

Yu Huanhu let out a sorrowful laugh to the heavens,甩了甩 his large sleeves, and turned to leave. "Elder Brother, Huanhu is leaving now. The account books for the manors and pastures will be delivered shortly!"

"Second Brother, Second Brother, you... Sigh, why must you do this to yourself!" Yu Xinglong could not catch up in time and could only stamp his foot, his face filled with regret.

Seeing this, Yu Xiaobao was overjoyed. Regardless of whether his second brother's move was a strategic retreat, it was a golden opportunity for him.

Managing such a large family was a great drain on one's energy.

If the elder brother hadn't been so frail and lacking in energy, how could he have gradually transferred so many properties to the second brother in the first place?

Now that the second brother was returning these properties, and the elder brother didn't have the energy to manage them, didn't that mean...

The "invisible man," Third Master Bao, immediately stepped forward.

"Elder Brother, Elder Brother, Second Brother has always had a fiery temper. Please don't take it to heart; his mood will settle down after a few days."

"Although Second Brother has laid down his burden, isn't your Third Brother still here? I will surely help you share your worries, Elder Brother. You don't need to worry too much."

Yu Xinglong watched Yu Huanhu storm off, and with the return of the six fertile manor estates and three pastures as the price, he could not possibly press the issue any further. He could only let out a long sigh.

He glanced at Yu Xiaobao and said with a sigh, "Third Brother, try to persuade your Second Brother later. The foundation of our Yu family, built over hundreds of years, can only remain stable and long-lasting if our clansmen work together."

Yu Xiaobao was ecstatic, taking this as his elder brother's approval for him to help manage the properties. He hurriedly replied, "Rest assured, Elder Brother. Second Brother is just a stubborn mule. I will talk to him."

Suo Hong and Suo Chanzhi exchanged a glance and feigned indignation. "The Clan Head says Second Master Yu isn't the killer, so are you suspecting that someone from my Suo family was behind this?"

Yu Xinglong gave a wry smile. "Brother Suo, our two families are now linked by marriage. We rise and fall together. How could the murderer of Chengye possibly be from your Suo family?"

"Yang Can was a trusted aide cherished by Chengye. He was simply overwhelmed with grief by Chengye's death."

"And he was unaware of the deep connection between our two families, so he let his imagination run wild and spoke such nonsense. Please don't take offense, Brother Suo."

After speaking, Yu Xinglong turned to Yang Can with a stern expression. "Yang Can, quickly apologize to Second Master Suo."

Yang Can maintained his straightforward demeanor. "Clan Head, my suspicions are based on evidence..."

"Silence! Apologize!"

"Clan Head, the young master died tragically, and the true killer is still in question. The guard captain of our main household was originally innocent, yet he has become the scapegoat."

"Now, you want me to apologize to the Suo family? I am not convinced! A thousand times not convinced!"

Yu Xinglong said, "Cheng Dakuan failed to protect his master. What more is there to say? Is it not appropriate for me to give him a minor punishment?"

"In a moment, you may go to the water prison and bring him out. Now, you will apologize to Second Master Suo at once."

Yang Can hesitated for a moment, then, as if forced to lower his head for the sake of Baozi Tou, he walked toward Suo Hong.

Second Master Suo waved his hand impatiently. "No need, no need. I don't want to accept..."

"Hm?"

They saw Yang Can walk past Second Master Suo and give a deep bow with clasped fists to Suo Chanzhi.

"Young Mistress, I was also overwhelmed with grief by the young master's death. If I have offended you in any way, I ask for your forgiveness."

Suo Chanzhi's fair, jade-like face flushed slightly. She wasn't quite sure if the "offense" Yang Can spoke of was truly an offense.

This rascal had a slightly roguish look in his eyes when he spoke to her; it didn't seem like he was talking about a mere offense.

"Ahem! Forget it. Seeing as you are loyal to my late husband, I will not pursue the matter. You may leave."

"Young Mistress, your magnanimity is deeply appreciated. I take my leave."

Yang Can turned and bowed to Yu Xinglong once more. "I take my leave."

Then he walked out of the Mingde Hall and headed straight for the water prison.

Suo Hong, his hand still raised awkwardly in the air, retracted it and stroked his beard to cover his embarrassment. "Ahem! I walk a straight path and sit in an upright place; I have nothing to fear from suspicion."

"But my poor niece. Now that she is the wife of your Yu family, Clan Head Yu, do not treat her poorly."

Yu Xinglong said, "Brother Suo, please rest assured. Chanzhi is now the eldest daughter-in-law of the Yu family. This will never change. I, Yu, will certainly not treat her poorly."

Suo Hong sighed and said, "I hope the heavens have eyes and allow Chanzhi to leave behind a child for Chengye. That way... this poor child will not be too lonely in the future."

"Yes, let us hope so!" Yu Xinglong agreed with a smile, but a shadow of concern quietly rose in his heart.

Was Suo Chanzhi truly pregnant?

Was that child truly the son of my own, Chengye?

Yu Huanhu did not wait for the ancestral ceremony the next day. In a fit of anger, he walked out of the Mingde Hall and immediately went down the mountain.

The carriage jolted along. Yu Huanhu leaned against the soft backrest, swaying gently with the bumps, his eyes slightly closed, not saying a word.

His second son, Yu Ming, had accompanied him to Phoenix Manor, and Yu Ming's face was currently filled with anger.

"Father, does that mean we're the killers just because they say so? Returning those six manor estates and three pastures won't cripple our branch, but to just hand them back like that... isn't that letting them off too easily?"

Yu Huanhu, his eyes still closed, said faintly, "What else could I do if I didn't agree?"

Yu Ming said, "What do you mean? Would Uncle dare to kill you?"

"If he dares to make a move, my brother is holding down Dailai City. We'd rebel against him immediately."

"But what if he doesn't kill your father, but confines him at Phoenix Manor instead? And then finds an excuse, saying he's only investigating the truth to prove your innocence?"

Yu Huanhu opened his eyes and stared fixedly at his son. "And what if this truth can never be found? What then?"

Yu Ming was taken aback and stammered, "This... Uncle... he wouldn't..."

Yu Huanhu gave a cold smile. "Wouldn't he? Hmph. In the Mingde Hall just now, he had already hinted at it."

"If your father hadn't seen the situation clearly, and if he weren't a man of indecisive character, right now, hmph!"

Yu Ming fell silent, unable to help but tug at his collar in frustration.

Yu Huanhu let out a soft breath. "Since your uncle staged such a grand show, and instead of chasing the real killer of his son, he wanted to pin the crime on your father, we had to offer him a piece of fat meat big enough to satisfy him for me to get away."

Yu Ming said shamefacedly, "Yes, I was too naive."

Yu Huanhu narrowed his eyes slightly. "However, when Chengye was alive, your uncle didn't have the energy to manage these affairs, let alone now?"

He clasped his hands inside his sleeves, a hint of mockery on his face. "Besides, all the stewards of those manors and pastures are my people."

"Now that your uncle has taken them over, he can't just replace them with anyone he finds. Especially..."

Yu Huanhu smiled comfortably. "The spring plowing is just around the corner. At this time, will he make a big move against the stewards of the major manors?"

"If he doesn't move against them, then he won't be able to move against them in the future. Otherwise, he'll inevitably earn a reputation for discarding the millstone after the grain is ground."

"If he does move against them, heh, delaying a single spring plowing season means delaying the entire year."

"The manors were doing perfectly fine under my management. But once they're back in his hands, if the autumn harvest turns out poor across the board..."

"Then as the Clan Head, will he need to give an explanation to the entire family?"

Yu Ming's eyes lit up immediately.

Yu Huanhu said, "Your uncle has just formed an alliance with the Suo family through marriage, and with the death of his heir, he has the fierce momentum of a grieving army. We had to take a step back at this time."

"But since I have taken this step back, he will find it difficult to press his advantage further."

He paused, and a curious glint appeared in his eyes again. "That Yang Can... there's something strange about him."

"Yang Can?"

"Yes, him. We need to investigate this person thoroughly."

***

Inside the water prison, Baozi Tou was nearly frozen stiff.

Suddenly, the large door creaked open.

A pillar of light shone in from the prison door, falling directly on Baozi Tou.

Baozi Tou squinted and looked up toward the stone steps.

A figure appeared at the entrance of the water prison, walking down the steps one by one.

The sunlight scattered from behind the man, making him look like a deity: a god of light.

He walked up to Baozi Tou and bent down slightly.

Only then did Baozi Tou see the man's face clearly. It was Yang Can.

Baozi Tou's eyes widened in shock. "Brother... Brother Yang?"

His muscles were frozen stiff, and even these words were spoken with difficulty.

Yang Can smiled and said, "Brother Cheng, I told you that as long as the Clan Head saw me, you would be safe. Now, the Clan Head has seen me."

Baozi Tou's dark eyes widened. "Brother Yang, are you saying...?"

"That's right. You can come out now."

In that instant, tears streamed down Baozi Tou, Cheng Dakuan's face. "I... I would go through fire and water for you, Brother Yang!"

A hoarse, trembling cry, born from the depths of the soul, echoed from within the water prison.
