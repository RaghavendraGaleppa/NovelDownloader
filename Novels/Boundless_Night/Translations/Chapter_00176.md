# Chapter 176: Very "Costly" to Ancestors

A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, and the moonlight, clinging to the forest floor like a veil of white mist, seemed to sway with the wind.

Qin Ming awakened, his consciousness a blazing fire, his will to survive fierce!

He knew he was still in danger. The Silk Scroll Art, which had once dimmed after activating on its own, was now faintly glowing again. Still, it was a surprise that it could bring him back from the brink of death. Not long ago, he had truly experienced the sensation of death, his consciousness like a seed falling into the underworld, sinking into endless darkness. Back then, his flesh was like dead soil, lifeless and dark as an abyss. At the last moment, the Golden Thread Jade Robe had enveloped him, piercing through the dark mist and giving him the strength to break free.

Qin Ming inwardly observed his body. His five viscera, six bowels, and entire being still bore many terrifying cracks, but they were slowly healing. He had a heartbeat and breath, no longer a living corpse. He was fully awake now, clearly seeing the golden threads and jade light within his flesh, stitching and mending, saving his collapsing body.

"The Silk Scroll Art is my fundamental technique," Qin Ming murmured. This was the technique he had practiced the longest, starting from childhood, for over a decade. It was more natural than breathing, having become an instinct. Otherwise, it wouldn't have activated on its own just now. It constantly smoothed his entire body, merging perfectly with his flesh and blood, fitting him best. When his body was dying, the Silk Scroll Art, now a flesh-and-blood instinct, saved him and brought him back to life.

Qin Ming wondered if something similar had happened when Li Qingxu shattered his skull years ago, ultimately bringing him back from the dead. His entire body itched, as if tiny flesh buds were growing. His five viscera and six bowels felt numb and tingly, and a sense of pain returned, signaling his body was regaining sensation. The organs and internal viscera that had ceased functioning began to operate again. Of course, these were very faint fluctuations; his various bodily functions were only slowly recovering.

"What's wrong?" Qin Ming's intuition was sharp. Although he had revived and his body showed signs of improvement, why did he still feel something was off? This flash of extraordinary premonition was elusive, like a lightning bolt streaking across the night sky—untraceable, yet deeply unsettling. He pondered if it was related to his body, if he could undergo rebirth this time. Probably not. After his seventh rebirth, his body hadn't fully "recovered," and in such a terrible state, simply being alive was a blessing. However, when the old woman from the Spirit Field realm fell, she was clutching a five-colored treasure bottle containing rich Heavenly Light Fluid, which should be enough for him to undergo rebirth. She had also fallen into this area; a careful search might reveal her remains.

"If it's not a matter of rebirth, then where does this unease come from?" Qin Ming looked up at the silver disk in the night sky—brilliant, translucent, like a divine lamp wreathed in faint night mist, casting down moonlight like water. It seemed to have some issues; he didn't believe it was the legendary moon. Then, to his astonishment, he saw what looked like a flying immortal's light near the bright moon in the night sky, streaking past at extreme speed, circling the moon, and then quickly dissipating. "What's up there?" He gazed intently, his expression extremely grave. Then he shook his head again. He should focus on fully recovering first; there was no time to worry about such things now.

Qin Ming found that the Silk Scroll Art was operating with considerable difficulty. This flesh-and-blood instinct felt somewhat sluggish; the golden threads and jade light were no longer as bright. It was clear he was too severely injured. The good news was that he was indeed recovering. The wounds in his five viscera and six bowels were healing. At this rate, his body, like shattered porcelain pieced back together, would eventually become as good as new.

As his body revived, continuously healing and restoring its functions, Qin Ming felt an endless weariness. He was about to fall into a deep sleep. But he felt quite at ease. This time, it wasn't a descent into the abyss of death, but a true dormancy. When he woke, he might be as lively as a dragon and a tiger. Just before losing consciousness, he was still thinking about the Silk Scroll Art. It was indeed extraordinary, saving his life time and again. In fact, to be precise, he was saving himself. Any cultivation technique was dead; only he had mastered this particular one and made it a flesh-and-blood instinct.

Following the path of the Silk Scroll Art was incredibly difficult. He had practiced for over a decade before truly comprehending it. It should be noted that even the *Fate-Changing Scripture*, which was said to stump many "famous figures," didn't stop him; he quickly mastered its basics. According to records, the Silk Scroll Art required a previous generation's "guidance," using their self-cultivated Heavenly Light Energy to "lead" and help successors "blaze a path," only then could the initial cultivation cycle form and succeed. Otherwise, there was no hope; no successor could ever cultivate it. However, the several founding ancestors of the technique, suspected to be figures of the Six Sovereigns, Tathagata, or Jade Purity level, had all either died, been crippled, or vanished, not to mention the fates of their disciples. The "ominous reputation" of this scripture spread far and wide, and its path was naturally severed as a result. Everyone knew it was powerful and terrifying, but it could only be studied as a reference. To truly walk its path required immense courage and determination. After all, it was very "costly" to ancestors! Qin Ming, however, had purely "forced his way through," relying on himself to embark on the path!

As he drifted into unconsciousness, changes occurred within his body. Streaks of light continuously surged forth, blossoming within his flesh and blood, like otherworldly heavenly light piercing through the night mist, falling across various parts of his body. The operational pathways of the Silk Scroll Art had somewhat dimmed. However, his body hadn't deteriorated; it was still recovering. His flesh and blood regenerated, his five viscera and six bowels regained vitality, and his heart began to beat strongly, his breathing becoming more stable. As time passed, various colorful mists and shimmering lights surged within Qin Ming's body, truly resembling meteors constantly streaking across the sky, piercing through the darkness. His body hummed and vibrated gently, different areas emitting distinct and vibrant lights, each acting independently. It was precisely because of this that Qin Ming fell into a deep slumber and couldn't wake up, as if he had been sealed within his own subconscious. The Golden Thread Jade Robe was still present, but barely maintaining its hold. Now, Qin Ming's body had different colored lights flowing through various regions, his flesh seemingly divided into separate territories, somewhat isolated from each other. As a result, his senses were cut off and very sluggish. Even if an earthquake occurred right now, he wouldn't be able to wake up immediately.

...

He didn't know how much time had passed, but when Qin Ming regained consciousness and opened his eyes, his hair stood on end. He saw a kind-looking old woman. In that "place" in the sky, he had encountered the Cui family's old woman and nearly exploded to death. Now, seeing a smiling old grandmother right after waking up, he was truly startled. A candlelight flickered. The room was small, with old tables and chairs that gleamed slightly from long-term polishing. He was lying on a bed with peeling paint.

"Child, you're awake. It's time for your medicine," the silver-haired old woman said with a smile.

Qin Ming instantly sat up, feeling his body was in good condition, without pain, and his vitality was very strong, no worse than before. This made him sigh in relief, and he quickly asked, "Hello, elder. Where... where is this?"

A young man heard the voice and entered the room. He was sturdily built and strong, with a full beard and piercing eyes.

"You were carried back by Yaozu," the old woman said with a smile.

"Many thanks, Big Brother," Qin Ming said, getting up and feeling that his body was fine.

"I'm only sixteen; I might even be younger than you," the bearded youth said. From his voice, he indeed didn't sound like an adult man.

"Oh... thank you, brother." Qin Ming hadn't expected him to look so mature, likely due to not shaving, which concealed his youthful face.

The old woman smiled and said, "Don't rush to get out of bed. When Yaozu found you, you had a layer of blood scabs all over your body; your condition wasn't very good."

The youth, Wu Yaozu, brought him a bowl of soup with chicken pieces and mushrooms, emitting a rich aroma. Qin Ming thanked him profusely. He was indeed hungry and quickly finished it after taking the bowl. He wasn't worried about any issues; if others had wanted to harm him, he wouldn't have woken up in the first place.

However, the next moment, he felt something was wrong. Why was the entire room filled with ethereal aura and divine light? The old woman was like an ancient statue, full of antiquity, emitting an inscrutable glow so intense that it was difficult to keep his eyes open. This sight was terrifying!

Qin Ming then looked at the youth. He was also extraordinary, definitely extremely strong for his age. A "rainbow light" steamed within his body, his physical form like a mere container to hold this light. Next, he found that this "humble room" had also transformed, becoming resplendent with light, adorned with carved beams and painted pillars, incredibly magnificent. The old tables and chairs, polished for years, began to emit five-colored divine mists, and even the bed he was lying on emanated purple qi. This place was now resplendent with gold and jade, a true celestial palace. The scenery before his eyes had completely changed.

Qin Ming was dumbfounded. What was happening? Through the doorway, he saw an old hen in the yard, and as it flapped its wings, it was actually radiating a divine glow. He pinched his face hard and vigorously shook his head, trying to clear his mind. Otherwise, he felt it was all too unreal, too preposterous. Suddenly, he discovered that his own body was also radiating light and color, with various splendid divine mists distributed in different areas within him—this was not normal.

"It's fine, don't be nervous. After drinking the medicinal soup, you'll experience slight hallucinations. It'll pass soon," the mature-looking youth, Wu Yaozu, reassured him.

Were these hallucinations? Qin Ming was deeply uneasy, and then he felt his eyelids grow heavy and unable to lift. He had just woken up, only to become drowsy again under the effects of the medicinal soup, falling back into sleep.

In a daze, Qin Ming felt as if he was having many strange dreams, faintly hearing people talking and seeing many bizarre and fantastical scenes. In a trance, he saw the old woman walk unsteadily out of the yard, seemingly muttering to herself, "The last time I saw someone like this was the last time. They exploded with a bang. Someone still dares to practice it, truly courageous." Then, Qin Ming dreamed of his grandfather, followed by the people of Twin Tree Village and Meng Xinghai, among others. In his dream, he saw Li Qingyue and the scenery around her. He also seemed to hear others' conversations: "Ancestor, I also want to possess a near-immortal item." As he was about to wake, he saw the old woman outside the courtyard burn to ashes, and then the entire town became a sea of fire, with broken walls and ruins everywhere.

Finally, Qin Ming woke up. He was drenched in sweat but felt very comfortable, his entire body unblocked, and his vitality exceedingly strong. He got up and out of bed, went outside. Some vegetables were planted in the courtyard, and an old hen was strolling around. He walked out of the courtyard. Outside, fiery springs gurgled, and the surrounding area was desolate, full of rubble and ash—just as he had seen in his dream! Above the ruins, only the dilapidated small courtyard behind him remained. In the distance was a large forest, accompanied by a fiery spring lake, bathed in moonlight, appearing exceptionally peaceful and serene.

Qin Ming felt intensely uneasy. Had he truly fallen from the sky into a forbidden land? But if so, how could he still be alive? These so-called forbidden lands were places where even old masters of profound cultivation dared not easily tread, for they were truly deadly! Take Cao Qianqiu, for example, who was so domineering and powerful. Once, a dying old master invited him to venture into a forbidden land together, but Cao Qianqiu simply shut his door and ignored the request. The entire ruin was empty, without a single person. The youth Wu Yaozu and the old woman seemed as if they had never existed. Yet, this small courtyard was so real, right behind him, with an old hen clucking. However, on such desolate ruins, for only one small courtyard to exist was clearly abnormal! He turned and gazed. If he were to walk out of here and go into the distance, would this small courtyard disappear?

Immediately, Qin Ming focused on himself. The cracks on his body had vanished, and his five viscera and six bowels were completely healed! This filled him with delight. So fast? His body was completely healed; he had truly returned from the dead. "Perhaps I was unconscious for a long time?" He harbored this suspicion.

A moment later, Qin Ming discovered something that made him lose himself, causing a massive earthquake in his heart. Within his body, various lights flowed, each occupying a distinct area. Could it be that what he saw in his dream was not false, and those were not entirely illusions and hallucinations?! He finally realized what was happening to him, never expecting this day to arrive so soon. Qin Ming's brows furrowed deeply. Was this his ultimate destination? However, he soon smiled again, his brows relaxing. He believed this was a good thing. For it to arrive early and be discovered was better than anything, allowing him to resolve it from its root!
