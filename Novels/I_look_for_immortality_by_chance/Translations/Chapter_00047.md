# Chapter 47: Awakening and Departure

The dark water cavern gradually came alive with activity.

Fish of various shapes and sizes cautiously swam into this long-sealed virgin territory. Upon discovering no dangers in these waters, they became lively, swimming freely and feasting on the algae covering the cave walls, their eyes filled with joy.

Yet some particularly adventurous little fish recklessly charged toward a patch of "dry land" in the midst of the water. There, an invisible force emanated from the center of the current, pushing back the water to create a dry area—normally forbidden territory for aquatic creatures. Yet some small fish crossed this boundary, leaping onto the dry patch.

Deprived of water, the little fish immediately began to fall, plummeting toward a handsome face. Just as it was about to land, a pair of cold, sharp eyes suddenly snapped open.

"Bang!"

A surge of spiritual energy erupted, forming a barrier that repelled the fish several meters away, sending it tumbling back into the water. The fish flicked its tail and darted off, never daring to approach again.

Those cold eyes swept the surroundings, spiritual senses probing, as if searching for something. Finding nothing, the eyes nonetheless relaxed slightly.

"Still alive..."

Gu Yuan lowered his head and saw that the wound on his fingertip had already healed. Though his body still felt weak, he was otherwise unharmed. The jade serpent and the golden seal, however, were nowhere to be seen. The vast cavern was now only inhabited by a few bold fish swimming about.

"The jade serpent didn’t kill me?"

"The Seal of Boundless Fortune?"

Recalling the Daoist patterns he had glimpsed before losing consciousness, Gu Yuan’s expression darkened.

"Did the stone liquid lead me to this opportunity? Or did the Seal of Boundless Fortune sense the stone liquid and lure me here?"

The thought sent a chill down his spine. He immediately checked his body, and upon confirming the stone liquid was still there, he exhaled in relief.

The Seal of Boundless Fortune was an immensely powerful fate seal, capable of elevating a person’s fortune to unimaginable heights. Even sitting idly at home, cultivators might inexplicably die nearby, allowing the seal’s bearer to effortlessly claim their treasures.

Reflecting on his reckless decision to enter the cavern, Gu Yuan wondered—was this all a trap? Had the seal’s owner detected the stone liquid’s uniqueness and set up this scenario to lure him in, kill him, and seize it?

But now, it seemed that wasn’t the case. The stone liquid was still with him, meaning the seal’s owner hadn’t detected it. Perhaps the stone liquid’s nature was even more profound than the seal’s.

"Still... I must have been influenced by the seal, acting recklessly to enter the cavern. Was my purpose simply to offer my blood to that jade serpent?"

Gu Yuan considered the possibility but quickly dismissed it. At only the sixth level of Qi Refining, how could his blood hold any significance?

Yet the sudden liveliness of the cavern and the jade serpent’s hatching were no mere coincidences. The Seal of Boundless Fortune’s influence was undeniable. The seal had concealed this cavern for years, preventing any creature from discovering it. The shellfish bed had existed right under the nose of the Azure-Fire Golden-Eyed Ape, yet it had never noticed the seal—something was clearly amiss.

But why had the jade serpent spared him after he witnessed the seal?

"Enough. Overthinking is pointless. Escaping with my life is fortune enough."

After pondering for a while without answers, Gu Yuan gave up. He understood that the jade serpent’s possession of the Seal of Boundless Fortune marked it as no ordinary being—far beyond his current level of comprehension. Dwelling on it would only exhaust him.

"This is no place to linger. Best to leave now."

With a final glance at the cavern, Gu Yuan sighed and swiftly ascended.

The expedition to the shellfish bed was not meant to last long. The sect’s Dragonfang Treasure Ship would return in at most four days.

Gu Yuan had initially spent only half a day in the shellfish bed, yet his unconsciousness had lasted two and a half days. It made no sense—had time in the cavern been distorted?

After this ordeal, he had no desire to stay and gather pearls. By now, most of the harvest would have been claimed, and the shellfish king’s fate decided. So he returned directly to the treasure ship, planning to rest for a day before heading back to the sect.

His arrival, however, caused a stir among the cultivators aboard.

The reason? He had reached the sixth level of Qi Refining.

This meant he had defeated the shellfish king of the fifth-level bed—an unexpected feat for a relatively unknown new disciple, especially when many seasoned sect members, including some formidable figures, had also competed.

Almost immediately, people approached to engage him in conversation. Gu Yuan responded politely but briefly before retreating to a corner to meditate in silence.

"Tch, those Azure-Fire Golden-Eyed Apes are cunning. They must have infused the shellfish bed with malevolent energy, driving the Crimson-Tailed Apes into a frenzy. They fought like demons, stronger than ever. I should have gotten at least four pearls, but this time, I only managed two. I’d have been better off cultivating back at the sect."

Gu Yuan’s unwillingness to converse eventually deterred the others. Soon, familiar faces on the deck began grumbling among themselves.

"Count yourself lucky. It’s been ages since the last large-scale expedition. With so many unpredictable factors, look around—nearly ten fellow disciples never made it back. Do you really think they all died to the Crimson-Tailed Apes?"

Someone sneered, their gaze flickering toward Gu Yuan.

"Watch your words!" A companion quickly tugged at their sleeve, silencing them.

The speaker seemed to realize their mistake and glanced nervously at Gu Yuan before falling quiet.

"Hah, a few deaths are nothing. You probably haven’t heard—the Sunset Cloud Sect has invaded Thunderclap Mountain. In just a few days, over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators have fallen, and who knows how many Qi Refining disciples."

"What? The Sunset Cloud Sect is directly attacking the Violet-Gold Six-Winged Eagle?"

The exclamation drew startled reactions across the deck. Even Gu Yuan opened his eyes to listen.

The Sunset Cloud Sect was a major power in the Eastern Mountains, rumored to possess a Dao Embryo cultivator, making them formidable and deeply entrenched. Meanwhile, the Violet-Gold Six-Winged Eagle of Thunderclap Mountain was a rare beast, born with strength at the seventh level of Qi Refining. With minimal growth, it could reach Foundation Establishment, reigning over the mountain range for a millennium as its undisputed ruler.

A clash between these two forces would shake the heavens.

"This fight was inevitable."

"The Five Thunder Dao Patterns on the Violet-Gold Six-Winged Eagle’s body are essential for the Sunset Cloud Sect’s ‘Five Thunder Divine Light Seal.’ The two sides have been covertly battling for centuries. They only held back before because of the constraints of higher powers. But now..."

Someone pointed upward meaningfully.

With the fall of the Supreme Being, the old restraints had vanished, and hidden undercurrents were now surging to the surface.

"Don’t dwell on it. Focus on your cultivation."

"The sect’s ambitions extend far beyond a single shellfish bed."

A sigh rippled through the deck.

"Though the Sunset Cloud Sect has suffered heavy losses, in just a few days, three new disciples have already broken through to Foundation Establishment, extending their lifespans by three hundred years."
