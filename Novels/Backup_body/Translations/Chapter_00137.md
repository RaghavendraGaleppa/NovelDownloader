# Chapter 137: The Guide – One After Another, I’m Completely Numb!

The cage was broken from the inside!  
And inside that cage was the old soldier who had survived the Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven!

This old soldier only had the cultivation of the Inner Qi realm—how could he break a cage forged by the Great Zhou Dynasty?

The scene just now was like a living hell. A Human Immortal Divine General and a Golden Body Arhat had perished, along with thousands of soldiers, torn apart without intact corpses—among them, many were masters of the True Qi realm.

"Judging by the traces at the scene, I don’t think it was some transcendent Human Immortal-level expert who slaughtered everyone just to rescue this old soldier," Li Zhengjing said solemnly. "I’m more inclined to believe it was the work of that old soldier named Guan Sheng."

The Young Master of Kunlun wore a complicated expression. "I think so too."

The two exchanged glances, and the atmosphere fell into silence.

An old soldier of the Inner Qi realm shattered the cage and caused the hellish scene they had just witnessed?  
The Yan Guan Mountain indeed held unimaginable opportunities.

Gao Xuan, who had escaped from Yan Guan Mountain with his True Qi realm cultivation, now carried a broken sword within him—his power was so great that he could repel beings at the peak of the Human Immortal realm.  
And now, this old soldier named Guan Sheng seemed to have escaped with Inner Qi realm cultivation yet possessed the ability to effortlessly kill Human Immortals?

But after Gao Xuan emerged, he devoured the blood of his kin, consumed by a murderous intent. So what kind of opportunity had this Guan Sheng obtained?  

"Though I can’t guess what opportunity he gained, judging from what we just saw..."  
Li Zhengjing said, "He seems to have lost his sanity—growing fangs and claws, filled with a desire to kill."

After a pause, Li Zhengjing looked at the Young Master of Kunlun. "Now that we’ve lost our guide, and with two precedents before us, do you still intend to enter the Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven?"

"Yes!"  
The Young Master of Kunlun’s expression was resolute. "Whether there’s a guide or not, I must enter Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven! I want to see for myself what world-ending secrets are hidden within the celestial star that fell from the heavens... and just how terrifying this so-called Annihilation Qi truly is..."

Li Zhengjing fell silent for a moment before asking, "How confident are you that you can return safely?"

The Young Master of Kunlun shook his head slightly. "I don’t know. But one thing is certain..."  
He looked at Li Zhengjing, his expression growing graver. "If I cannot return from this place unharmed, then apart from the Debt Collector, no one in this world will be able to escape the calamity to come."

The celestial star’s descent did not bring opportunity—it brought calamity.  
For now, the calamity remained confined within the Cave Heaven, but sooner or later, it would spread beyond, engulfing the world.  
If even he could not escape unscathed, then no one—save the Debt Collector—could avoid this disaster.

His words implied that the power he now wielded placed him second only to the true Debt Collector in this world!  

"Have you fully inherited Kunlun Immortal Sect’s legacy?"  
Li Zhengjing immediately grasped the deeper meaning behind his words. "I’ve heard that the most profound treasure passed down through Kunlun’s lineage is the Nine Calamities Inherited Thunderflame, left behind by the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign..."

"It’s inside me now."  
The Young Master of Kunlun did not hide it, speaking plainly. "That is my confidence in daring to enter Yan Guan Mountain."

With that, he turned his gaze forward. "I know you want to seize the Heavenly Venerate’s token from the Golden Ship of Salvation... Remember to come here tomorrow at this time to receive me. Right here—don’t forget."

"Understood."  
Li Zhengjing nodded slightly.

Then he watched as the Young Master of Kunlun erupted with an overwhelming aura, thunder and flames swirling around him.  
Ahead lay the domain of Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven!  

The Young Master of Kunlun drew his sword and slashed forward!  

A single strike, accompanied by thunder and fire!  

The void split open abruptly!  

Within, a gray mist stretched endlessly—desolate and icy, sending a chill down Li Zhengjing’s spine. Even the half-broken sword inside him trembled violently.  

A sharp pain shot through him. Li Zhengjing grunted, blood trickling from his nose and mouth as he staggered back.  

The Young Master of Kunlun, without looking back, stepped straight into the rift.  

The void sealed shut behind him, and all returned to normal.  

Li Zhengjing wiped the blood from his face, feeling the half-broken sword within him gradually settle. He thought to himself, *This broken sword came from inside Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven. Now that it reacted so strongly to the Cave Heaven’s aura—as if facing a mortal enemy—what exactly lies within?*  

He exhaled deeply. *Forget it. I’ll find Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official first. Tomorrow, when I return to receive the Young Master, I’ll understand everything.*  

Earlier, he had been worried about whether the Young Master of Kunlun could return safely.  
But after learning that the Nine Calamities Inherited Thunderflame had been refined by him, those concerns vanished.  

Because the Nine Calamities Inherited Thunderflame was the very foundation that had made Kunlun Immortal Sect the leader of the three great immortal sects!  

Throughout history, every Kunlun Sect Master who wielded the Nine Calamities Inherited Thunderflame had been nearly invincible in their era—so long as the true Debt Collector did not appear.  

Based on what Li Zhengjing had deduced from the golden page, the greatest threat within Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven was the so-called Annihilation Qi.  
But since the Young Master of Kunlun was aware of it and still dared to explore the Cave Heaven, he must have been fully prepared.  

"I’ll come for you tomorrow."  
With that thought, Li Zhengjing memorized the location and turned to leave.  

He took out a golden feather.  

Under the night sky, the feather shimmered faintly.  
Its golden light guided him toward Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official.  

---

Meanwhile, on the other side of Yan Guan Mountain Cave Heaven...  

Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official suppressed his aura to the extreme—even his breathing, heartbeat, and blood flow slowed to a near halt, his vitality concealed.  

His deep understanding of the physiology of living beings made this feat effortless.  

Ahead of him stood a massive white rat draped in a cloak.  

Before long, Jingxu the Revered—who had feigned defeat in the battle over the old soldier Guan Sheng—arrived at the rendezvous point.  

Though revered as one of the Twelve Loose Immortals of Central Continent, Jingxu was no true rogue cultivator. He had joined the Golden Ship of Salvation during his True Qi realm days, relying on its resources to break through to the Human Immortal realm and become the Second Helmsman.  

The two joined forces, tracking the movements of the Forbidden Divine General.  

Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official followed them silently.  

"He landed around here," Jingxu said. "Then he headed east."  

They followed the trail until, after a while, the White Rat sniffed the air.  

"He changed direction. Did he realize he’s being followed?"  

Jingxu frowned. "He left no traps or obstructions—probably didn’t notice. Unless..."  

The White Rat understood. "Then it wasn’t the Forbidden Divine General who found the clue. Like us, he was tailing someone who might have discovered something!"  

The Forbidden Divine General had spotted a target, faked serious injuries to escape the battlefield, and was now secretly following them.  

Thus, his route was dictated by his prey’s movements.  

"Let’s go!"  

The White Rat and Jingxu hurried forward.  

---

Further ahead, the Forbidden Divine General concealed himself, tracking a figure in the distance.  

Worry gnawed at him. *I left the battlefield and haven’t returned. Others will notice. I must find the Heavenly Venerate’s token and legacy quickly—otherwise, more will come after me.*  

He glanced back. The battle over Guan Sheng had begun to die down.  

Among the Golden Ship’s forces alone, he knew the White Rat, Yuan Shen the Monkey, Liu the Snake, the Second Helmsman, and three other senior Human Immortals had gathered near Yan Guan Mountain.  

But he was certain more Golden Ship experts lurked in the shadows, all vying for the Heavenly Venerate’s legacy.  

*I must hurry. Every day wasted brings more variables.*  

The Golden Ship of Salvation had no shortage of powerhouses.  
More were surely on their way—only distance delayed them.  

He had to secure the token before his competitors multiplied.  

---

Ahead, the figure who had emerged was none other than one of the Golden Ship’s Guides—a disciple of Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official.  

Earlier, he had led troops to attack the rogue cultivators, further destabilizing the battlefield. Even Li Zhengjing hadn’t realized his true goal: to exploit the chaos and slip away unnoticed.  

Now, the Guide hurried along a mountain stream, his face etched with urgency.  

*When I passed by with the army after crushing the Southern Barbarian tribes, I sensed the Heavenly Venerate’s presence near the stream’s source. Back then, he must have just left the token—his aura hadn’t yet faded.*  

*At the time, I didn’t understand. Only after the Heavenly Venerate’s message spread did I learn he was fleeing the Debt Collector and left his legacy here.*  

*The token must have been washed downstream. It should be nearby...*  

He formed hand seals, casting them into the water.  

Nothing.  

He tried again on the rocks. Still nothing.  

His anxiety grew. *Tonight’s chaos is my only chance. Once order returns, every move I make will be watched.*  

Countless Golden Ship experts lurked in the shadows. Only tonight’s turmoil provided cover.  

Just then, a furious voice roared:  

"Are you fucking looking in the wrong place? I’ve been watching you forever—how have you not found it yet?!"  

The Guide’s heart lurched. He looked up.  

On a hill ahead crouched a massive ape, clad in black robes, its eyes blood-red with impatience.  

*Damn it! I’ve been followed! Even in this chaos, someone tracked me!*  

This was Yuan Shen the Monkey—an ancient demonic immortal, a Helmsman from the Second Heavenly Venerate’s era, comparable to a peak Human Immortal!  

Even his master, Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official, was no match for this beast.  

"Hurry up and find it!" The ape bared its fangs. "The fighting’s dying down. Any longer, and others will come!"  

It lunged forward, snarling, "Find the token, and I’ll make you the First Helmsman. Fail, and I’ll eat you alive!"  

The Guide’s heart sank. *This place is compromised. The token is lost to me.*  

He sighed. "It should be here. But the token could be anything—a plant, a fish, a pebble... I can’t find it."  

"Then we’ll dig up everything within ten miles! I’ll carry the whole patch home and sift through every grain of dirt!"  

The ape raised its hand, about to unleash its power—  

When a spear shot from the side!  

"Old monkey, you’re not fit to be Heavenly Venerate!"  

The Forbidden Divine General could wait no longer. He lunged at Yuan Shen.  

"You too, Forbidden?" The ape’s eyes burned crimson.  

The two Human Immortals clashed.  

Trees shattered. Rocks flew.  

The Guide despaired. *Even the Forbidden Divine General was tailing me?*  

Then another voice rang out:  

"You idiots! You’ll ruin everything!"  

The White Rat emerged, pretending to mediate—but its strikes were lethal, aiming to eliminate rivals under the guise of peacekeeping.  

The Forbidden Divine General and Yuan Shen turned on it, and the three descended into chaos.  

Amid the fray, another figure crept forward, attempting to seize the land itself.  

"Second Helmsman?!"  

The Guide was dumbfounded. *I thought I was being stealthy... but everyone was following me!*  

"Jingxu, you dare steal this land?"  

A giant serpent erupted from the water, spewing corrosive venom.  

Jingxu retreated, engaging the serpent in battle.  

Then another Golden Ship elder emerged, one hand covering miles of land, the other striking at the Guide.  

"You led everyone here. You’re useless now."  

The killing intent was palpable.  

The Guide blanched, scrambling back—  

Only for a sigh to sound beside him.  

A banner unfurled before him—the *Summoning Banner of Luofu*!  

Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official had finally revealed himself to save his disciple.  

The Guide’s eyes were utterly numb.
