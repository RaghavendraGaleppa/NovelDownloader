# Chapter 422: An Itch in an Unreachable Place

Looking at Li Mo's serious expression as he asked, and then at Qin Yuzhi, who was on the verge of losing completely, Shangwen Cang and the other elders were not so much shocked as they were plunged into deep thought, trying to decipher the meaning of the familiar characters Li Mo had just uttered.

Demon Summoning Sect Master?

Your employee?

An Elder of the Qingyuan Sect???

How could these three titles possibly belong to the same person? This was utter nonsense!

"Wait a moment, let me process this..." Shangwen Cang and Elder Hanhe tried to make sense of it, only to realize their own comprehension skills were severely lacking.

"Ahem, let me start from the beginning."

Li Mo cleared his throat and said, "Back then, I saw the people of the Southern Frontier suffering under the Demon Summoning Sect for too long. Coincidentally, I needed the power of the masses for a martial art, so I allied with the seniors of the Demon Race. As everyone knows, they seem to have a natural talent for mimicking martial arts..."

"Later, things took a rather inexplicable turn, and I ended up becoming the Demon Summoning Holy Son's uncle-in-law..."

"So you created a new sect?! To scam the Demon Summoning Sect?" Elder Hanhe's eyes widened, and he rolled up his sleeves. He was utterly bewildered.

He even found it somewhat plausible... the Ten Thousand Forms Immortal Sect, the Primordial Heavenly尊, and even bringing Little Bing'er to be the Holy Maiden.

"Calm down, Hanhe." Seeing Elder Hanhe's eccentric temper about to flare up, Shangwen Cang quickly stopped him. Taking a deep breath and telling himself to remain calm, the Sect Master said, "Continue."

"Actually, there's no treasure at the bottom of the Yunmeng Palace, only the former Demon Summoning... Sect Master, who is Qin Yuzhi. But others wouldn't believe that, so I used a martial art that allows me to take on another form to throw a stone and lure them away..."

"Heh, the people from the Demon Summoning Sect aren't the brightest; they're probably still celebrating happily."

"......"

Now it was Elder Zeng and the Three Heroes of Hengyun's turn to fall into a pensive silence. So, the hair they had fought so hard to obtain... was just a single strand of hair! (Slams table)

The Sect Master and the Elder from the Divine Weapon Peak felt a headache coming on. This kid... no, this beast, had some nerve! His actions were utterly outrageous!

"Then I saw that Sect Master Qin was all alone with nowhere to go. Since we had a strategic cooperation with the Demon Summoning Sect, and she's a born prodigy for labor, I thought why not recruit her into the Ten Thousand Forms Immortal Sect."

"顺便来 our Qingyuan Sect as an Elder would be the icing on the cake..."

"You beast, shut your mouth!!"

The Sect Master lost his composure and almost swung his tobacco pipe at Li Mo's head. Was he trying to turn their ancestral foundation into a nest?

Could it still be called a sect? At best, it would be a corporation, and a massive one at that.

"Speaking of which, the Qingyuan Imperial Tomb..." Qin Yuzhi raised her head, and memories came flooding back. "I designed the Imperial Tomb myself. I even placed many statues imbued with divine intent at the entrance to intimidate villains and prevent tomb raiders. Why can't I see them now?"

So, the Qunyu Peak was the entrance to the Imperial Tomb? She was talking about those statues of deities?

Li Mo looked at his own master.

"?"

Shang Wu touched her delicate nose, whistling innocently as she gazed up at the sky at a forty-five-degree angle.

The beautiful master pretended not to understand what you were talking about.jpg

So, it turned out the ancestral foundation was designed by someone else.

Shangwen Cang's expression was complex. A Seventh Realm expert, a掌玄 (Palm of Mystery), was a formidable existence that many major sects ruling entire states might not even possess in their ranks. The Immortal Realm was a legend, and the通天境 (Heaven-Piercing Realm) had vanished from the world. The Seventh Realm was already the most powerful foundation openly known in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths.

But her identity was indeed too sensitive, and the implications were too profound.

"This matter is of great importance; we need to discuss it at length."

The Sect Master hurried back to the main peak, perhaps to consult with the true Elder.

Elder Zeng of the Hengyun Sword City and Bai Jinghong's group went to temporarily stay at the Divine Weapon Peak. The Three Heroes of Hengyun had all made it onto the Dragon Subduing List, and their journey to the Imperial Capital from Ziyang Prefecture was now much closer.

As for Elder Hanhe...

---

"Perfect, I'm not very good at this. Senior, you take my place."

Li Mo gave up his seat and sat next to the Ice Cube, preparing to learn a thing or two.

Elder Hanhe frowned. "This old man never participates in such group gambling activities. They are a waste of time and sap one's will."

"Chui Bao, didn't we agree to go back to the Divine Weapon Peak to practice forging?"

Li Mo muttered to himself.

Could this kid be interested in the art of smelting?

Oh, right, the Divine Hammer Little Tyrant...

Elder Hanhe silently reversed his course and sat back down.

"A little harmless diversion is fine."

"Shang Wu, today I'll let you know that the true First Mahjong God of the Qingyuan Sect is someone else!"

And so.

The clattering sound of mahjong tiles rang out once more.

The First Mahjong God of the Qingyuan Sect was indeed someone else, not Shang Wu, but neither was it Elder Hanhe. After Li Mo left the table, the Ice Cube played even better!

Then, Little Li was still offering mahjong loans.

One was winning money, the other was lending it. Could you call this anything other than a husband-and-wife scam?

Helpless, for the sake of the other three's gaming experience, they had to bring back the confident Little Li, who thought he had already mastered the game.

"It's the same spot, but why are the tiles I draw so terrible?"

Li Mo grumbled, scratching his neck.

Ying Bing lowered her gaze and saw a few beams of sunlight filtering through the banyan tree, shining on Li Mo's neck, casting mottled light spots. This made the red marks from scratching particularly noticeable.

"Haha, I win! Pay up, pay up."

Li Mo was the last one again to not win a hand, so he was a bit frustrated.

Before he could even reach up to scratch his neck, a cool touch suddenly came from there.

Hmm?

He turned his head and was startled to find that at some point, he and the Ice Cube were sitting very close together. If they got any closer, she would be sitting in his lap.

"Is it here?"

"Mm... there's another place that's itchy too."

"Where?"

"The other side."

Li Mo said, feeling a bit guilty.

"?"

What kind of posture would allow someone to scratch both sides of his neck at the same time?

She would have to stand up, move behind him, and let his head rest against her stomach...

Ying Bing banished the image from her mind and glanced at the arranged mahjong tiles.

"You've played several tiles wrong."

"Ah?"

Li Mo raised an eyebrow and found that his already terrible hand had gotten even worse. He smacked his lips, feeling a bit melancholic, unsure if it was because of the mahjong or something else...

And his hands got worse and worse.

This round, it felt like it was doomed.

Little Li's mouth twitched. He tilted his head back and bumped into a soft, warm surface.

Was it an illusion?

A faint, subtle fragrance seemed to mingle with his breath, and a cool sensation spread across his neck.

He froze and turned his head. His cheek could even feel the graceful curve of her abdomen.

"Still itchy?"

"No longer itchy."

Li Mo took a deep breath and casually pushed his arranged tiles over. The elders across from him, Elder Hanhe and the others, first frowned, then their eyes widened in shock.

"I won."

Ying Bing said, but her trembling gaze wasn't on the mahjong tiles.

He said he wasn't itchy anymore.

But could it be that his itch had been transmitted to her, in a place she couldn't reach?
