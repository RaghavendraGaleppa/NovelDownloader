# Chapter 349: Where the Ice Lump Slept, the Golden Crow's Ultimate Form Manifests!

After traveling for many days, Li Mo and the senior demon beasts finally stopped within the territory of the Green Luan Clan.

The scenery here was breathtaking.

From afar, large, magnificent, and towering blue-leafed trees formed a canopy like structure. Occasionally, the crisp sounds of bells or various musical instruments could be heard from within, making one momentarily mistake the clashing jade-colored leaves for the source of the sound.

"Further south, we will reach the territory of the Demon Summoning Sect and the Great Shang Remnant Clan," Shang Qinqing said, gazing southward.

"We shouldn't go any further south then," Wu Qing said with some regret. During this period, she felt as if she had grown younger.

Walking through village after village, following Li Mo to display his divine might, gave her a feeling reminiscent of her youthful days of chivalry.

Shang Qinqing placed a hand on her hip and laughed. "Little Mo, where did you learn all these tricks? If you were to trick Little Bingzi one day, wouldn't you make her cry?"

"I wouldn't trick her," Li Mo replied without hesitation.

"Tsk, tsk, tsk," Shang Qinqing pouted, her expression teasing.

"The amount of Faith Power collected this time is terrifying. It should be enough, right?" Guo Chuan asked, rubbing his belly.

The quantity of Faith Power isn't just determined by the number of people, but also by the believers' piety.

When the common people worshipped the Witch Spirit, there was reverence mixed with fear. But when they worshipped the 'Heavenly尊 Lord,' it was pure devotion. Thus, the efficiency of collecting Faith Power was likely far more terrifying than that of the Demon Summoning Sect in the past.

"It's enough," Li Mo confirmed.

"Then, does that mean we can't continue showing our divine might outside?" Ling Yuangou asked, sounding as if he hadn't had enough and wanted to continue.

Shang Qinqing shook her head. "If we go further south, the Demon Summoning Sect and the Great Shang Remnant Clan will stop at nothing to come after us for a life-and-death battle."

She paused, then looked at Li Mo. "In fact, even now, the Demon Summoning Sect won't just let this go. You can stay in the Green Luan territory for a while, but we can't protect you forever. You need to plan ahead."

Li Mo rarely saw the usually frivolous Shang Qinqing being so serious.

She was right.

He couldn't get carried away just because he had repelled a portion of the Demon Summoning Sect and the Great Shang Remnant Clan's forces in Qingmu City. First of all, that victory was achieved with the backing of an army, thanks to the soldiers of the Qingmu Camp fighting for their lives. Moreover, that might not have been the full strength of the Demon Summoning Sect and the Great Shang Remnant Clan; it was perhaps only the force Han Zhen could rally at the time.

Both were long-standing powers in the history of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, and they were certainly not to be underestimated. He had not yet grown to the point where he could overpower all methods with sheer power. A genius on the Hidden Dragon List was, after all, just a hidden dragon. The true rulers of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were those on the Heaven List, the Earth List, and even the experts not recorded on either list.

He yearned for power!

Bidding farewell to the senior demon beasts, Li Mo was led by a young Green Luan girl to a high tree hollow.

Inside the hollow, however, was a world of its own—an antique and elegant room that resembled a maiden's boudoir. He was truly a unique case, becoming the first human male to set foot in the Green Luan territory.

"Why are you staring at me?" Li Mo asked, a bit confused.

The Green Luan girl shrank her neck back, her eyes still filled with curiosity, but she only jingled the bracelet on her wrist.

Oh, right. The people of the Green Luan Clan cannot speak until they meet their destined one...

Li Mo didn't understand music, but he instinctively looked at the red string on his wrist, from which hung a small jade-feather whistle.

"Do you know Bingzi?" he asked.

"?" The Green Luan girl looked completely blank.

"The Green Luan Divine Maiden," he clarified.

*Jingle, jingle—*

The Green Luan girl immediately nodded. She seemed a bit anxious and flew away immediately.

Left alone in the tree hollow, Li Mo scratched his head, not quite understanding what she was trying to convey. He sat down on the bed and lay back casually.

A faint, delicate fragrance suddenly wafted to his nose, like an orchid in a secluded valley. It was very familiar.

"Is this... where the Ice Lump slept?" Li Mo was stunned. No wonder the place looked more and more like a maiden's boudoir from ancient times.

In a daze, he thought: Was it not long ago that the Ice Lump lay in this very spot?

---

...staring at the moon outside the window, her fingers gently stroking the head of a big-headed doll...

Thinking of this, he gently shook the jade-feather whistle on the red string. A breeze passed through the whistle, producing a pleasant and ethereal sound.

Faintly, at the edge of his hearing, he seemed to hear the nursery rhyme she had softly sung...

He sank into a dream.

***

Not long after.

Inside the World Seed.

"The Faith Power within the Pagoda of Clarity and Myriad Colors should be enough to manifest an Ultimate Form now," Li Mo thought.

He took out the exquisite pagoda, carefully observing the layers now tinged with a strange glow. There were just six layers.

After he displayed his divine might, a layer would be filled approximately every five to seven days. One layer of Faith Power could manifest one Supreme Form. Six layers could manifest one Ultimate Form.

In reality, by normal calculations, he shouldn't even have six layers yet. It's just that every time he passed through a village or town and had the people there worship him for the first time, he would receive a large burst of Faith Power. It was a bit like receiving a 'down payment' from them, followed by a steady stream of 'monthly payments'.

"If this is the case, then to manifest a Dao Divine Form, wouldn't it require thirty-six layers?" Li Mo mused silently. It seemed it wouldn't take too long after all.

Should he try manifesting an Ultimate Form first?

Right, the Heavenly Return True Mirror seemed able to recall projections, dissolving them back into Faith Power. There would naturally be some loss in this process, but it wasn't unbearable.

"Anyway, I can't project Brother Monkey for the time being. I can't just waste all that time without improving my Divine Intent."

Li Mo took out the painting, *The Golden Crow Transforming into the Sun*. Coincidentally, Princess Jiang Chulong was also close to breaking through to the Observation of the Divine stage. Both of them could use it.

When Princess Jiang Chulong breaks through, there would also be a Golden Destiny feedback...

*Whoosh—*

The Heavenly Return True Mirror projected a团 of burning flame, resembling the sun, or perhaps a burning egg embryo stirring to life. Scorching solar flames rolled outwards. The shadow of a divine bird became increasingly distinct within the firelight as Faith Power was injected into it.

"Teacher, this... what is this?" Jiang Chulong hugged her peach blossom branch, giving a small shiver.

"Your birthday gift," the Heavenly尊 Teacher smiled. "This is a Golden Crow from ancient times, an existence that transformed into the great sun. As long as you defeat it, you should be able to step into the Observation of the Divine stage."

"G-Golden Crow?" Upon hearing it was a gift, Jiang Chulong was no longer afraid. She even felt the divine bird within the fiery egg embryo was somewhat familiar. But mostly, she was happy. "Thank you... thank you, Teacher! If only... if only Brother Li were here..."

*...*

Li Mo thought to himself, *Jiang Chulong probably never properly celebrated a birthday before, right?*

An image inevitably surfaced in his mind: a little girl, huddled in a cold, deserted palace courtyard, lonely and desolate, with no cake, no birthday song, no candles...

His eyes couldn't help but well up with tears.

When he gets back, he should make up a birthday for Jiang Chulong...

Just as he was thinking this, the Heavenly尊 Teacher suddenly gave a slight jolt. The scene in his mind seemed to change involuntarily. Everything else was the same, but...

The person had changed!

It had become a young woman, cold and aloof, hugging her long legs, with no one to accompany her, spending the day she came into this world in desolation and loneliness...

It was the empty-nest Ice Lump!

The Golden Crow projection broke out of its shell, heat waves rolling, its momentum astonishing. However, Li Mo had no heart to pay attention to it. He murmured to himself, "That's right, the Ice Lump's birthday is also coming up soon..."

P.S.: The Ice Lump will get a birthday present, but will the little author get some power support? (Checking pockets)
