# Chapter 21: The Heavenly God Cult Retreats, Grandmaster Appears!

At this moment, outside the Martial Artist Association.

Bai Zhan radiated a golden light, throwing a punch that caused the space before him to ripple slightly. This was the Golden Body Realm! His body was like gold! Once one reached the Golden Body Realm, even the sharpest weapons couldn't harm them in the slightest, unless it was a spiritual artifact!

In front of Bai Zhan, the black-robed man also emanated a faint golden light. However, compared to Bai Zhan's, his golden radiance was somewhat dimmer.

"Damn Heavenly God Cult, how dare they invade our human cities!" Bai Zhan was furious.

One should know, the Heavenly God Cult invading human cities was originally very rare. After all, invading a city required an enormous amount of manpower and resources. Invading smaller cities yielded few benefits, and they lacked the strength to invade larger ones. Therefore, it rarely happened. Like this current situation, if Su Yu's golden talent hadn't been exposed, the Heavenly God Cult probably wouldn't have acted like this. But the more he thought about it, the angrier Bai Zhan became. It was all due to his own negligence.

"Hehehe, as long as we can kill your prodigies, what does it matter if we pay a price? Overall, we still profit."

A pair of shadowy eyes stared intently at Su Yu. "Su Yu, was it? Very well, I'll remember you! This time, consider yourself lucky, but next, prepare to face the endless assassinations of my Heavenly God Cult!"

The black-robed man let out a low roar, pushing Bai Zhan back with all his might, intending to retreat. But how could Bai Zhan let him escape so easily?

"Stay here!" Bai Zhan roared, thrusting both fists forward, an endless golden light surging and covering them. He brutally smashed them into the black-robed man's body. The black-robed man was also a ruthless individual; he forcibly endured Bai Zhan's attack, blood spurting from his mouth as if it were worthless. But he also used the force of Bai Zhan's punch to swiftly flee towards the wilderness.

Bai Zhan's expression darkened. "Damn it, he actually got away!"

Bai Zhan didn't pursue. Who knew if there were other Heavenly God Cult experts in Heng City? The most important thing now was to protect Su Yu! And with the Golden Body Realm expert of the Heavenly God Cult gone, the unrest in Heng City was quickly quelled.

An hour later.

In a room at the Martial Artist Association. Bai Zhan, Dong Buwei, Liu Kuang, and Su Yu sat quietly on a sofa.

"I didn't expect that this oversight would almost lead to a disaster." Bai Zhan glanced at Su Yu and continued. "So, the higher-ups might have decided to open it early, which is good news."

At this moment, Su Yu was a little puzzled. "Didn't they say the Prodigy Camp was open at any time?"

Bai Zhan's attitude towards Su Yu was much better now, and he explained with a smile. "To be precise, those aren't considered prodigies, but rather another kind of identity."

"Oh?"

"Repeat students!"

"Repeat students? What does that mean?" Su Yu was a bit confused.

Bai Zhan then continued.
