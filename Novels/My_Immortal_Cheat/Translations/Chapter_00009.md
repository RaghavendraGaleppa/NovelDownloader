# Chapter 9: The Violet Flame Clan

The Imperial City of the Tianqin Empire was enormous, divided into several districts. At its very center was the Imperial Palace. Outside the palace lay the High-End District, where many upscale establishments were located, including the Imperial City Arena. Beyond the High-End District was the bustling commercial area, where the carriage currently was.

Many shops that didn't qualify for the High-End District were primarily found here. There were also street vendors with stalls, though most were essentially hawking exaggerated claims.

"A Vajra Gourd! A treasure of Saint-level! Come take a look, come take a look!"

"The Nine Dragons Arrogance Art! A cultivation technique straight to the Great Saint realm! Only three spirit stones to make it yours!"

...

"A Thunderflame Stallion!"

Someone by the roadside recognized the exotic beast pulling the carriage and couldn't help but exclaim, "That's a Sanzang Realm exotic beast! With a little training, it could become a Dharma Idol-level demonic beast! Who has such an impressive display of wealth?!"

"Quiet down..." Someone next to him tugged at his sleeve and whispered, "Don't you see the purple divine dragon on the carriage? This is a carriage from the Qin King's Estate, and it belongs to a very important figure from the Qin King's Estate... We can't afford to provoke such a person."

The voices drifted in from outside the carriage. Zhou Tian frowned slightly and muttered, "Activate the silencing array, and also activate the reflection array."

"Yes!"

The grey-clad servant's voice came from outside. Golden arrays flickered on the carriage walls, sound was isolated, and the walls gradually became transparent, allowing a clear view of the scene outside.

The Imperial City's roads were incredibly wide, more than ten meters across, paved entirely with grey luminous stone bricks that possessed remarkable compression resistance. This was because the roads weren't just for humans; many other powerful races were also common in the Imperial City.

Zhou Tian, feigning nonchalance, pointed at a creature nearby whose appearance was vastly different from a human's. "See that? That's a member of the Violet Flame Clan. They're not often seen in the Imperial City, but I didn't expect to see one today!"

Upon hearing this, Tian Ling looked in the direction Zhou Tian was pointing.

It was a creature three meters tall, wearing specialized clothing, though a large portion of its skin was still exposed. Its muscles were like stone, its body covered in purple patterns. Its face, however, was somewhat similar to a human's, with five sensory organs, but on its head were two curved purple horns, spiraling patterns adorning them. They didn't grow from the sides of its head but extended from its forehead, making it appear exceptionally ferocious.

"Don't they live near the Mu Casting Volcano in the west? Why are there traces of them in the Imperial City?" Tian Ling's eyes gleamed with fascination. She had read about the Violet Flame Clan in the Haotian Sect's ancient texts. Their ancestors were the Crimson Flame Clan, a race born with innate control over fire. Through long ages of inheritance, their bloodline had undergone a mutation; the crimson flame patterns on their bodies turned purple, and their innate fiery power became even stronger. By tapping into their bloodline power, adults could reach the Sanzang Realm, and with a bit more growth, they could contend with Dharma Idol experts. Some elders could even challenge Saints, making them a formidable clan.

The feeling of seeing something in ancient texts couldn't compare to witnessing it firsthand. Tian Ling stared intently at the Violet Flame Clansman, muttering to herself, "Looking at the patterns on his body, he doesn't seem to be an adult yet..."

As members of the Violet Flame Clan aged, the patterns on their bodies would gradually cover their entire form. This Violet Flame Clansman's head wasn't yet covered, indicating he likely hadn't reached adulthood.

Zhou Tian gazed at Tian Ling's delicate profile, searching through his memories. Fortunately, he had some recollections concerning this Violet Flame Clansman. After organizing his thoughts, he explained, "General Gu Feng, the Frontier Guard General in the west, is on good terms with the Violet Flame Clan's patriarch. This time, when General Gu returned to the capital, the Violet Flame Clan patriarch had his son accompany General Gu back to broaden his horizons. This person is the Violet Flame Clan patriarch's son."

The carriage drew closer to the Violet Flame Clansman. Both were moving along the center of the road. When the Violet Flame Clansman saw the carriage approaching and noticed the emblem on its body, he silently moved to the side, clearing the path.

"Uncle Gu told him not to provoke anything bearing that emblem."

Tian Ling retracted her gaze at this sight and looked back at Zhou Tian, saying, "Your Qin King's Estate seems to hold a very high status..."

Zhou Tian nodded and replied, "Indeed, my Qin King's Estate holds a very high status in the Imperial City. My father is the Qin Emperor's blood brother, born of the same mother, unlike the other princely uncles. Their relationship is very close."

After introducing Tian Ling to some Imperial City knowledge and encountering several non-human races, the carriage finally arrived at the Imperial City Arena.

The Imperial City Arena was a cylindrical structure, towering ten thousand meters high. One shouldn't find this height surprising; the Treasure Gathering Pavilion across from it was roughly the same height, and the adjacent Celestial Dance Pavilion was only a head shorter.

It was entirely greyish-white, carved with various exotic beasts. At its summit was a colossal golden dragon emblem, the royal totem. Below, five large characters, "Imperial City Arena," were inscribed in crimson.
