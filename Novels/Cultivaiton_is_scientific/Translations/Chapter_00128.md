# Chapter 128: Holding Hands

"Ah, and there's that scrap metal!" Li Shiming's description of it as scrap was of course a joke. Although the sword-shaped metal appeared damaged, the terrifying aura it emitted made his heart tremble.

He could confirm that this sword-shaped metal was made of third-grade material. Compared to the third-grade sword foundation his clone used to cultivate the "Sword Demon Secret Code," this sword-shaped metal had an even more intense aura.

Naturally, the quality of this sword-shaped metal was exceptional—it had been Elder Baili's primary offensive magic treasure. If not for Elder Baili's miscalculation, he wouldn't have used his primary offensive magic treasure to block the close-range explosion of two tons of solid explosives. The result was the complete destruction of the treasure's internal structure, severing even its connection to Elder Baili.

What Li Shiming now held in his hand was merely the most basic third-grade metal material. With his current knowledge, he couldn't identify what specific third-grade material it was.

A normal magic treasure would not only consist of a primary third-grade material but also include high-grade auxiliary materials to grant the treasure additional properties. In its current state, even a skilled artifact refiner capable of crafting magic treasures wouldn't be able to accurately determine its composition.

The unimaginable explosion had affected the material of this treasure, causing subtle changes. Li Shiming hesitated. Originally, he had lost interest in the "Sword Demon Secret Code," as his clone was already cultivating it. It wasn't that he had no interest at all—his "Vajra Protection Divine Art" and the "Sword Demon Secret Code" both had body-refining effects. The former relied on Buddhist vajra power, while the latter relied on external objects.

These external objects determined the power of the "Sword Demon Secret Code." Using high-grade magical weapon materials would set the upper limit of the refined body's toughness at that of a high-grade magical weapon. While this seemed formidable enough, after witnessing his clone's physique and possessing the "Vajra Protection Divine Art," such an improvement seemed unnecessary.

If he hadn't encountered suitable materials, he might not have considered the "Sword Demon Secret Code" at all. But now, with a piece of third-grade metal right in front of him, it felt as if the heavens were urging him to cultivate it. 

*Heaven's gifts are not to be refused; to refuse invites calamity.*

Li Shiming was extremely familiar with the "Sword Demon Secret Code." He controlled his clone to cultivate it daily, so even though his main body hadn't practiced it, his understanding of the technique had reached an exceptionally high level.

He held the sword-shaped metal in his hand, and the spiritual energy in his body cycled through the pathways of the "Sword Demon Secret Code." After completing a full cycle, the energy transformed into an extremely peculiar force that gathered in his palms.

This peculiar energy made contact with the sword-shaped metal, seemingly without any visible changes. However, with his spiritual sense, he could perceive that the metal was being slowly decomposed by the energy. Of course, the decomposition speed was incredibly slow. By the time the first session of cultivation ended, there was no visible change to the metal.

Yet, Li Shiming could sense that the peculiar energy had absorbed some substances from the metal, which were now dispersing throughout his body. This was a long-term cultivation process—results wouldn't be visible in the short term.

After completing the "Sword Demon Secret Code," he ate two spirit fish and began cultivating the "Vajra Protection Divine Art." He wanted to be absolutely certain that there was no conflict between the two body-refining techniques. If there were, he would have to choose one and abandon the other.

Despite the word "demon" in its name, the "Sword Demon Secret Code" had no relation to demonic cultivation. The term "demon" here referred more to the technique's deviation from orthodox sword cultivation. The "Sword Demon Secret Code" refined the body with a sword and the sword with the body, absorbing high-quality metal to strengthen the physique. 

The high-quality metal would grow alongside the cultivator, deepening their connection over time. By the Golden Core stage, it could directly become a powerful magic treasure. However, the reason it was called "demon" was also due to its divergence from traditional sword cultivation principles.

The sword foundation cultivated through the "Sword Demon Secret Code," no matter how high its quality, couldn't be used as a flying sword like a true sword cultivator's. This was a technique for wielding a sword in hand—the sword foundation only reached its full potential when held, and once separated from the body, it was merely high-quality material, losing its mutual enhancement effect with the cultivator.

What Li Shiming valued in the "Sword Demon Secret Code" was its body-strengthening effect. Using third-grade metal, it could theoretically refine the body to the toughness of third-grade material.

As the vajra power circulated within him, continuously strengthening his body, the Buddhist chants produced by IBMZ15 in his ears—enhanced manyfold by the "Demonic Sound Lotus"—forced him to divert part of his consciousness into the server room space to avoid being influenced by the chants.

The "Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique" provided him with resistance to mental influences, and combined with his diversion tactic, he remained unaffected by the chants. The stronger chants generated more vajra power, and pure vajra power continuously surged from the relic into his body, steadily enhancing his physique.

There was no conflict whatsoever—the substances absorbed by the "Sword Demon Secret Code" didn't clash with the vajra power. On the contrary, they seemed to accelerate the body-refining process. This session's effects were stronger than any previous one, though he couldn't determine whether this was a coincidence or the result of the two techniques interacting.

Li Shiming stood up, his bones crackling like popping beans. He could clearly feel that he had grown taller—IBMZ15's precise calculations confirmed an increase of two centimeters.

His final cultivation session was the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique." Since developing his spiritual sense, the spiritual energy vortex within him had grown significantly, reaching the mid-stage of the fourth level of Qi Refinement. Such progress would normally have taken years of arduous cultivation.

As he began practicing the technique, he noticed something unusual—not in a bad way, but his cultivation speed had increased again. He had previously researched cultivation speeds: a clone with Heavenly Spiritual Roots had a baseline speed of 100, which served as the standard. 

With his Triple Spiritual Roots and an 81-value Metal Spiritual Root, focusing solely on metal-attribute spiritual energy, his theoretical maximum speed was 27. Previous research suggested he could only approach this value, never exceed it.

But today, his cultivation speed reached 28.5. 

With his spiritual sense enhancing his cultivation, he had recently approached the theoretical limit of 27 for the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique." Yet today, he effortlessly surpassed it. If not for IBMZ15's flawless calculations, he would have doubted the result.

This theoretical limit represented a cultivator's maximum potential. Even with cultivation-enhancing pills, a cultivator could only approach this limit, not surpass it. Otherwise, the cultivation world wouldn't place such importance on Heavenly Spiritual Roots. If resources could bridge the gap, sects wouldn't hesitate to invest heavily in nurturing disciples during the Qi Refinement stage.

But a cultivator's spiritual roots determined their perception and absorption limits. Li Shiming had never taken cultivation-enhancing pills because his natural speed was already fast enough. Even with abundant top-tier first-grade pills—free of pill toxin concerns—he could only reach the theoretical limit of 27.

Due to various factors, aside from Heavenly Spiritual Roots, most cultivators couldn't achieve their theoretical maximum speed. Yet today, Li Shiming shattered this established conclusion. Though the increase was only 1.5, the implications were profound—it meant he could break through the limitations of his spiritual roots and achieve greater cultivation efficiency.

He suspected the "Sword Demon Secret Code" was responsible, as today's cultivation differed from the past only in that regard. Absorbing a trace of third-grade sword metal might have boosted his speed. Of course, this was merely speculation—even if his speed continued to rise, he couldn't definitively attribute it to the "Sword Demon Secret Code" or the simultaneous cultivation of both techniques.

IBMZ15 issued an alert. Li Shiming extended his spiritual sense through the eyepiece and saw a familiar emerald-green flying boat with a graceful figure standing atop it.

He hurried back to the cave dwelling and activated the small mountain-protecting formation. Arriving at the dock reserved for flying boats, he met a pair of autumn-water-like eyes filled with fading worry and joy.

"You're here!" Li Shiming felt unusually tongue-tied, far less articulate than in their jade slip exchanges. He sensed concern from Yin Shilan—it felt good to be cared for.

"I'm here," Yin Shilan replied softly, gazing at him quietly.

Five days without word from Li Shiming had initially made her assume he was in seclusion. But as time passed, her worry grew. On the surface, the matter with Baili Jinyan seemed resolved, but she knew Elder Baili wouldn't let it go so easily. News from the Holy Ice Sect revealed that several disciples who had hosted her had disappeared. Even the Heavenly Ocean Sect had lost multiple disciples recently.

Though some disappearances seemed unrelated, she sensed an underlying connection. More importantly, through the jade slip's permissions, she discovered Li Shiming wasn't on Eagle Beak Island.

After losing contact, her anxiety mounted, eroding her usual restraint. She had waited outside Eagle Beak Island every morning since.

"Come inside," Li Shiming said, stepping aside.

They sat in the cave dwelling, where Li Shiming poured tea into glass cups.

"These past few days, I've been restless, worried something might happen to you," Yin Shilan murmured after a sip, her gaze lifting to meet his. At this moment, she was no longer the lofty immortal but a vulnerable mortal, her eyes filled with tenderness.

"I'm sorry for worrying you. I should have let you know beforehand," Li Shiming said apologetically. "This time, I went to—"

"You don't have to say," Yin Shilan interrupted, extending a talisman toward him.

The talisman bore the image of a bow rather than runes, exuding an overwhelming pressure—stronger even than the third-grade metal, akin to facing a Golden Core cultivator. Li Shiming had encountered such pressure before, from a talisman depicting a white jade cup.

"What is this?" Li Shiming didn't take it, knowing it must be extraordinarily precious—likely Yin Shilan's life-saving treasure. Though he'd never asked about her background, her flying boat and Baili Jinyan's pursuit hinted at a status comparable to his.

"It's a Treasure Talisman, imbued with a fraction of a Golden Core cultivator's magic treasure. Keep it with you—it can protect you in danger," Yin Shilan insisted, placing it before him.

"I have ways to protect myself. You should keep it—I'd feel better knowing you're safe," Li Shiming countered.

"I have many means of protection—this one won't be missed. Please, don't make me worry," Yin Shilan pleaded, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. Her tender vulnerability left Li Shiming flustered.

He picked up the talisman, sensing her resolve. Seeing this, Yin Shilan smiled through her tears.

For a moment, Li Shiming was dazzled, as he had been when he first saw her—the immortal in the rain, now blooming like a flower just for him.

The entire cave seemed bathed in spring light, all colors paling before her smile.

"Thank you," Li Shiming said, reaching out to gently cover her delicate hand. In normal times, he wouldn't have dared, but the immortal's descent into mortality, her enchanting smile, emboldened him.

Their hands touched, trembling slightly. Yin Shilan didn't pull away, her blush deepening with shyness.
