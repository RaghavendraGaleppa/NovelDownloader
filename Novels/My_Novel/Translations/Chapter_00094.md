# Chapter 94: Bountiful Harvest and Great Wealth

The Black River Village launched a surprise attack, catching the mountain bandits completely off guard and achieving a resounding victory. In a single clash, their will to fight was shattered.

Just as the situation was decided, one bandit, like a fish that slipped through the net, managed to evade capture by the villagers. Seizing a moment to flee, he fumbled at his waist for an object, trembling as he prepared to light it.

Li Xian immediately shot an arrow, killing him on the spot.

Li Xian picked up the object and saw it was a "sky-piercing cannon," used for sending signals.

"Uncle Fu, count the numbers and tally the casualties," Li Xian called out.

After a moment, Uncle Fu replied, "Young Master, our village only has one injured man who fell during the charge."

"Hahaha, it seems these mountain bandits aren't so formidable after all."

"If you had come earlier, Young Master, we wouldn't have been bullied for so long."

The villagers' faces were filled with joy. The anger from decades of oppression was finally released as they kicked, beat, and cursed the bandits.

"Pride leads to defeat," Li Xian said calmly. "It's not that the bandits are weak, but that Niu Liang was foolish. This victory has an element of luck; we cannot be blindly confident."

"You are right, you are right," Uncle Fu said, not daring to argue in the slightest. He now revered Li Xian as if he were a god. If Li Xian said it was luck, then it was luck.

"Tell everyone not to sleep tonight. Clean up the battlefield."

"I've already told you the specifics of what to do."

"Bury the dead, strip the living of their clothes,搜刮 their silver. Make sure they are tied up tightly. Also, bring all these horses into the village."

Li Xian walked through the battlefield, taking in the chaos. He intentionally raised his Qi while speaking so that everyone could hear him clearly.

As for Niu Liang... this man was extremely fierce. Ordinary people probably couldn't bind him properly; Li Xian had to deal with him personally.

With several swift slashes, blood sprayed into the air. Niu Liang grunted as his left leg and right hand were severed. The pain woke him up only to make him faint again.

Li Xian's ruthlessness and decisiveness not only intimidated the bandits but also the villagers of Black River Village.

Though his hands were stained with blood, Li Xian remained exceptionally calm. This was how the world was. If he had been defeated, his fate would have been far worse.

Furthermore, every single person who became a mountain bandit was a heinous criminal, without exception.

Seeing the large number of bandits here, a sudden idea occurred to Li Xian. He thought that bandit lairs were usually set up in treacherous mountains, and the number of bandits was usually limited.

There were nearly a hundred bandits here, so the lair must be empty. If he took this opportunity to sneak in, he might be able to cause a great uproar and wipe them out.

He immediately brought over a horse and mounted it. After giving a few instructions to Uncle Fu, he rode off toward the bandit lair.

The bandit horse knew the way. As they got closer to the lair, Li Xian looked into the distance and saw that the lair was sparsely guarded, just as he had expected.

"They call it a lair, but it's really just a bunch of worthless chicken and dogs."

"In terms of manpower, resources, and scale, it's far inferior to the Black Water Gang."

The Great Wu Empire was in a period of turmoil, with forces all over the country carving up territory. Gangs, factions, sects, and clans emerged one after another.

And "bandit lairs" were the weakest of them all.

There was a reason for this.

The term "bandit lair" itself implied a limited scale. A few hundred or a thousand people was the limit. Moreover, without a foundation in secular industries, they could only rely on robbing common people.

The bandits under their command had high turnover and little loyalty. If the situation turned slightly unfavorable, they would surrender immediately, or even defect.

Such a force dared to challenge the Black Water Gang. The reason lay in the terrain of the lair.

The location of a lair was always easy to defend and difficult to attack, with natural barriers for protection. The Black Water Gang controlled the river and was much wealthier than the Mountain Wind Lairs, but it had never had the intention to annex the Mountain Wind Lair.

"The core members of a lair are often just a few leaders."

"The rest of them aren't very skilled in martial arts."

"Even so, one must still be extremely careful."

Outside the lair's entrance.

Li Xian crouched in the grass, his ear to the ground, listening for movement inside the lair.

The mountain guards were few and far between, leaving many openings. However, the real obstacle was the mountainous terrain itself.

After observing for half an hour and getting a clear view of some of the passes and checkpoints, Li Xian focused his spirit and grabbed a handful of snow, stuffing it into his mouth. The snowflakes melted into ice water, stimulating his mouth and waking him up.

Because Niu Liang had been reckless and taken most of the bandits with him, the lair's defenses were weak. Although watchtowers were everywhere, half of them were empty.

He sneaked up the mountain, passing by several houses. Inside, snores were thunderous, rising and falling one after another.

"In terms of sleeping conditions, these bandits are no different from the servants in the village," Li Xian thought.

Deeper inside were buildings like the Hall of Brotherhood, the Husbandry Hall, and the Black Prison... Because it was on a mountain, transporting wood and firewood was extremely difficult. Therefore, the buildings were low and had no aesthetic appeal.

In the Mountain Wind Lair, the five leaders had their own independent courtyards with beautiful servants to attend to them. The Third Leader's courtyard was on the south side.

"Cough, cough."

"Help me up," Peng Fox said, growing increasingly restless as the sky darkened. He called out to the servant girl beside him.

The servant girl dared not disobey and helped him up.

"Get me paper and a pen!" Peng Fox said in one breath, then coughed a few more times.

Soon, the servant girl laid out the paper and handed him the brush. Peng Fox hesitated for a moment, dipped the brush in ink, and began to write.

He had originally thought that since his Fourth Brother had set out, even though he was reckless, his strength, manpower, and equipment were all there. It was only natural that he would avenge them and win.

Once all the heads were brought back, this matter would be considered over. There was no need to let the Big Brother know, which would leave him with the impression of being "incompetent."

However, the sky had already turned dark. His Fourth Brother was still not back, and he felt a growing unease. He could no longer worry about anything else. He immediately wrote down the entire situation on the paper.

He stuffed it into a bamboo tube and sent it off via a homing pigeon.

"I hope Fifth Brother can arrive quickly. Otherwise... with the lair so empty now, I am also..." Peng Fox muttered to himself as he watched the homing pigeon.

Just at that moment...

Li Xian suddenly appeared, placing a hand on his shoulder.

Peng Fox was startled. "You... How dare you? You're here already?" his voice trembled.

He knew the other was bold, but not this bold.

"Fourth Brother... is he dead?" Peng Fox asked, breathing heavily.

"Not dead, but he will be soon," Li Xian asked, "What did you just send?"

"Cough, cough, it was a pigeon," Peng Fox said. His hand moved inside his clothes, gripping a small knife hidden against his body. He suddenly turned around to stab, but Li Xian snatched the blade and stabbed him back in return.

The blade pierced his heart.

Peng Fox fell to the ground, knowing he had no chance of survival. Blood flowed nonstop from his wound. He stared wide-eyed at Li Xian. "F-Fifth Brother... will... will avenge me!"

With that, his breath ceased and he died.

"I'm a step too late," Li Xian said, looking in the direction the homing pigeon had disappeared.

"Fifth Brother?"

"Is that the... unusual Fifth Leader?"

Li Xian's eyes narrowed.

The next morning, at the hour of the Chen (7-9 AM).

Li Xian was practicing his fists in the courtyard, his fist wind fierce. When the [Square Fist] had first reached perfection, there was an air of a master in how he threw and retracted his punches, drawing attention.

Now, as his proficiency accumulated day by day, he was not far from reaching the pinnacle. Li Xian was gradually able to achieve "mastery over release and restraint," his punches powerful yet restrained.

[Proficiency +1]

After completing a set of Square Fists, the lake of Qi in his body rippled slightly. His spirits were high, and he wanted to practice more, but a guest was already at the door.

Left with no choice, Li Xian called out, "Come in."
