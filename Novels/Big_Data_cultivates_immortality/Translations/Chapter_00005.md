# Chapter 5: The Grass is Growing Well

"Huh?" Feng Jun froze for a moment, sniffed, then lifted his arm to take a whiff before replying blankly, "I don't smell anything."

"It's stinky!" The boss decisively waved a hand in front of his nose. "You can't smell your own stink... Well, this is friendly advice. Others might not bother to tell you."

He didn't want to offend a customer.

However, Feng Jun's reaction surprised him. The guy was momentarily stunned before bursting into laughter. "Then I should really thank you for the reminder. Otherwise, how embarrassing would that be?"

Watching the young man leave with a laugh, the boss shook his head with a smile. "That stinky kid has a pretty good temper... Well, he really is stinky. Very stinky."

Feng Jun's happiness, of course, had a reason. The foul odor on his body—wasn't that the legendary... marrow cleansing and tendon transformation?

This was indeed a stroke of luck, complete with all the expected reactions. A genuine miracle.

Taking a shower at Hongjie Club was incredibly easy. Most fitness centers had shower facilities.

Considering his clothes might also smell, Feng Jun returned to the dormitory to grab a change of clothes. By chance, he spotted a phone charger on Zhao Hongqi's desk.

He decided to borrow it for now. He didn't want to buy a new charger only for it to explode immediately.

This time, he used his right hand and smoothly completed the charging process.

His guess was correct. The old-fashioned phone began charging, slowly but steadily.

Feng Jun looked around, plugged the charger into an outlet under the bed, turned off the phone, and hid it there before grabbing his clothes and heading out.

Under the shower, he realized just how dirty he was. A layer of grime covered his skin, blending in with his complexion so well that he hadn't noticed it before.

As for the smell? Maybe there was some, but it clearly wasn't overpowering. Otherwise, the restaurant owner would have likely refused him service.

Evidently, the descriptions of marrow cleansing and tendon transformation in online novels weren't entirely accurate. The impurities weren't black, nor were they that foul.

Feng Jun used soap three times before finally feeling clean. This reinforced his decision to stay at Hongjie—showering outside would cost money, and the club provided free soap.

By the time he finished showering, it was almost 1 PM, the quietest time at the fitness club.

Feng Jun left the club, swiped his bus card, and rode a public bicycle to a phone store half a mile away. He spent fifteen yuan on a cheap charger. Seeing the latest smartphones on display, he felt a strong urge to buy one.

With his newfound luck, why bother saving money?

But in the end, he restrained himself. Not only because he hadn't found a way to monetize his situation, but also because the dormitory wasn't secure. He was already worried about his old phone being stolen—let alone a new one.

Back in the dorm, he swapped out Zhao Hongqi's charger, stashed the phone under the bed again, and went to sleep. Unfortunately, he forgot to turn the phone back on.

When he woke from his nap and checked the phone, he was shocked to find it was already 4 PM.

The old phone's battery had reached 83%.

That was enough charge for the day. He unplugged the charger and was about to do something when Zhao Hongqi burst into the room.

The chubby guy was drenched in sweat, panting heavily. "What's wrong with you? Why was your phone off? Manager Guo wants you over there now."

Feng Jun frowned. "What's the rush?"

"It's about yesterday," Zhao Hongqi replied, unable to hide his schadenfreude. "The power kept cutting out, so Manager Guo didn't have time to deal with you. Now that the transformer's fixed, she's handling it... Plus, you skipped work yesterday afternoon."

Feng Jun gave him a strange look. "You seem pretty happy about my misfortune?"

"Why would I be happy?" Zhao Hongqi feigned seriousness. "But you broke company rules. They have to address that, right?"

Feng Jun sighed and headed out the door.

The fitness club was starting to get busy, but most of the visitors were members—government employees who had finished their morning shifts and were enjoying paid leisure time.

With more members around, the staff had less to do. Regulars didn't need guidance.

Manager Guo had gathered the idle coaches and attendants for a lecture, her words flying fast. When Feng Jun walked in, she glared at him. "You dare show your face?"

Feng Jun's temper flared, but he suppressed it. "I overslept today. Count me as late."

But Guo Yueling wasn't about to let him off easy. "Late today, but what about yesterday? Not only did you neglect your duties, but you also skipped work in the afternoon. I don't get it—how can someone so young be so arrogant? What gives you the confidence?"

"The company feeds and houses you, and this is how you repay us? A wolf in sheep's clothing... What makes you think you can act this way? Your double degree? Don't make me laugh. That's just two pieces of worthless paper. These days, college graduates are a dime a dozen!"

Feng Jun's anger surged. As a college graduate, he could joke about graduates being common—that was self-deprecating. Other graduates could say it too. But Manager Guo, with her mere vocational school diploma, was outright insulting him.

His patience snapped. "My food and lodging are earned through my work, not handed out by the company. Get that straight. And I don't think I was wrong yesterday—why should I take the blame for Liu Shuming's mistake?"

His mood soured further. Looks like I'll have to leave after all. What a shame—free showers and soap.

"Blame you?" Guo Yueling laughed sharply. "Because Liu Shuming is a coach, and you're not. That's why. Got a problem with that?"

The logic was brutally unfair, but that was reality. Coaches outranked assistants—certified professionals were rare, but unskilled labor was easy to find.

Feng Jun wasn't about to back down. "Of course I have a problem. Right is right, wrong is wrong... A coaching certificate? In my eyes, that's just another piece of worthless paper!"

The other coaches' faces darkened. Kid, you're asking for trouble.

Feng Jun immediately regretted his words, but what was said was said. No point dwelling on it.

Manager Guo smirked. "A coaching certificate? It absolutely matters. Let me make this clear—in this industry, a coaching certificate is far more valuable than your pathetic double degree."

Feng Jun's hands clenched at his sides. He narrowed his eyes. "Are you insulting me?"

"Insulting you is doing you a favor," Guo Yueling sneered. "What, you want to hit me?"

Feng Jun had no intention of violence. Unless absolutely necessary, he wouldn't lay a hand on a woman.

He was about to resign. His newfound luck wasn't tied to the dormitory. Leaving now would just mean higher expenses.

But just as he was about to speak, a cold, bell-like voice rang out behind him. "What's going on here?"

Everyone turned to see the company's general manager standing there.

Today, "Sister Hong" wore a white short-sleeved blouse with a small collar and a light gray pencil skirt.

On another woman, the outfit would scream corporate professional. But on her, it exuded authority and an intimidating presence.

A woman without stockings seemed to shed all pretense, revealing her true commanding demeanor.

Manager Guo quickly explained, "Sister Hong, I was addressing a disciplinary issue. I didn't see you arrive... The company's morale has been slipping. The younger staff are getting lax. We need to clamp down on this."

"Hmm," Sister Hong murmured noncommittally.

Guo Yueling knew she had to justify herself. She pointed at Feng Jun. "This one's a prime example. Doesn't get along with colleagues, skipped work yesterday, late today..."

After a pause, she added, "Some members took a liking to him, but he doesn't know his place."

"Oh?" Sister Hong studied Feng Jun, vaguely recalling him. She knew exactly what "members taking a liking" implied. The club had its share of peculiar clients. "The graduate student, right?"

Feng Jun's lips twitched. Double degree, not graduate student!

"Yes," Guo Yueling nodded. "His name's Feng Jun. Never really fit in."

"Hmm," Sister Hong nodded again before suddenly brightening. "Feng Jun... You're 'Falling Flowers Season'?"

"Ahem." Feng Jun coughed awkwardly. Was this really the time to discuss gaming nicknames in front of everyone?

"Yep, his QQ name is Falling Flowers Season," Zhao Hongqi chimed in. "Something about 'meeting you again in the season of falling flowers.' So pretentious."

Sister Hong gave him a withering look. Her own online alias, "Sister Hong of the Streets," wasn't exactly humble either.

Her appearance wasn't coincidental. She'd come for a reason.

After assessing the situation, Sister Hong turned a cold gaze on Liu Shuming. "Let it slide this time. If you harass our members again, don't blame me for what happens next."

Liu Shuming shuddered under her stare and nodded frantically. "S-Sister Hong, I understand. My mistake."

No one dared ignore Sister Hong's warnings. Since the club's opening, troublemakers had always faced consequences—a fact every employee knew well.

Liu Shuming's legs were practically trembling.

Sister Hong then glanced at Feng Jun and gave a slight nod. "You... Well, the grass is growing nicely."
