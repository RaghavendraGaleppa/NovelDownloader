# Chapter 52: This is a Talisman Shop  

Shuangfeng Street.  

Standing before a two-story building, Zhang Jing once again checked the address written by Senior Brother Yan before taking out his keys.  

The location was excellent—adjacent to one of the entrances of Mingdeng District, with a constant flow of cultivators coming and going. It was clear that this was one of the shops Senior Brother Yan had specifically set aside.  

To the right was a pill shop called 'Lingdan Xiaozhu.' A quick glance earlier had revealed a figure in a green robe inside, likely an alchemist from the outer sect.  

The building to the left was tightly shut—probably one of the remaining shops in Senior Brother Yan's possession.  

Creak—  

Zhang Jing pushed open the door, and the interior of the shop came into view.  

The space wasn't large.  

Directly facing the entrance was a counter about ten feet long.  

Behind and to the left of the counter was a small door, likely leading to a rest area. To the right was a slightly larger space with a few tables and chairs, as well as the staircase leading to the second floor.  

Upstairs, the second floor contained a bedroom and a quiet cultivation room, fully furnished with everything one might need.  

"Senior Brother Yan has been very thoughtful," Zhang Jing mused inwardly, recalling the white-haired figure.  

After a brief rest, he hurried back downstairs.  

Now, it was time for the real work!  

It took Zhang Jing nearly half a day to fully set up his talisman shop.  

The counter was now stocked with various talismans, each accompanied by descriptions and prices—listed in Dao Merits, of course, and slightly higher than those in the Dao Academy's Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

Star Guidance Talisman: 2.1 Dao Merits.  
Blazing Sun Talisman: 1.6 Dao Merits.  

A few other talismans he had crafted earlier, such as the Concealment Talisman and Spirit Healing Talisman, were also displayed with their respective prices.  

This pricing wasn't Zhang Jing being greedy—he had thoroughly researched the three talisman shops he passed on his way here and found that they all charged similar prices. It seemed everyone was eager to capitalize on this rare opportunity.  

But those shops sold ordinary-quality talismans.  

Zhang Jing, however, was selling premium-quality ones.  

In business, you had to have your own unique advantage—otherwise, how could you lure customers away from competitors? High quality at reasonable prices would be his signature selling point!  

Wait—he almost forgot!  

As if struck by a sudden thought, Zhang Jing quickly grabbed a small wooden board and wrote:  

**"Final Three Days! Bloody Discounts! All premium-quality talismans in this shop are 20% off (only for transactions using demon cores)!!!"**  

After finishing, he examined the board with satisfaction.  

If he were a wandering cultivator or a fellow disciple, wouldn't he be tempted to buy in bulk upon seeing this?  

Next, Zhang Jing crafted a shop sign. Once everything was ready, he hung both the sign and the discount board in prominent spots outside the shop.  

Standing inside and watching the passing cultivators, Zhang Jing let out a long sigh.  

From this moment on,  

**"This is a Talisman Shop"** was officially open for business.  

Tap, tap—  

Footsteps approached.  

Hearing the sound, Zhang Jing turned his expectant gaze toward the door.  

Was his first customer arriving so soon?  

Under Zhang Jing's eager stare,  

A man in a green robe slowly appeared.  

Holding a small jade vial, the man stood at the entrance with a smile, eyeing Zhang Jing's youthful face before asking tentatively:  

"Ah, this—"  

Recognition flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes. He smiled and said, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother."  

"So it's Junior Brother Zhang. I'm Senior Brother He, the one selling pills next door. Seeing your shop open today, I came to offer my congratulations."  

The man stepped forward and handed Zhang Jing the jade vial.  

"Ah, Senior Brother He!" Zhang Jing replied politely.  

"Earlier, I noticed someone in Lingdan Xiaozhu next door and planned to visit after settling in here. I didn't expect Senior Brother to come first—I'm truly embarrassed."  

"Hey, no need for such formalities between fellow disciples!" Senior Brother He waved his hand dismissively.  

Then, pointing at the shop sign outside, he chuckled:  

**"This is a Talisman Shop**—what a brilliant name! Junior Brother, you're quite the character!"  

"Senior Brother flatters me. It's nothing special," Zhang Jing replied modestly.  

As they spoke,  

Senior Brother He glanced at the talismans on the counter and suddenly exclaimed in surprise:  

"Junior Brother, these talismans of yours—they're all premium quality, aren't they?"  

"To be honest, crafting premium-quality talismans isn't too difficult for me," Zhang Jing answered confidently.  

Senior Brother He's gaze darted between the talismans and Zhang Jing's face before he clicked his tongue in admiration.  

"Such skill at your age is truly impressive. May I ask which squad you're in—Luodu or Panlong?"  

"Junior Brother is in Luodu Squad."  

"I knew it! Only the top three squads could nurture a talent like you. I'm in Yanxia Squad. When you return to the academy, feel free to visit me on Yanxia Island. And if you ever need pills, just come to me—I'll do my best to help."  

Senior Brother He handed Zhang Jing a communication talisman, his tone warm and enthusiastic.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother. I'll definitely visit when I have the chance."  

After exchanging pleasantries, Senior Brother He leisurely returned to his shop next door.  

Back inside,  

Zhang Jing opened the jade vial and found ten Purple Spirit Pills inside.  

"Truly the generosity of an alchemist," he murmured appreciatively.  

Perhaps because the shop had just opened or because it was late in the day,  

Zhang Jing didn't receive any customers on the first day.  

That night,  

Upstairs,  

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on the bed, meditating.  

Suddenly, he extended his right hand, and a Mistroot Water Ginseng materialized in his palm, emitting a faint misty glow.  

A peculiar fragrance wafted into his nostrils.  

Without hesitation,  

He swallowed the ginseng whole.  

Instantly, a faint bitterness spread across his tongue, filling his senses.  

At the same time,  

A surge of moist, gentle spiritual energy erupted in his abdomen, as if alive, eagerly merging into the raging river of energy connecting his organs.  

The speed of his **Five Organs Water Essence Circulation Technique** accelerated dramatically.  

Time passed indistinctly.  

Sigh—  

A sigh suddenly echoed in the room.  

Zhang Jing opened his eyes.  

"If I were in the cave abode, I would've broken through to the fourth level of Qi Refining by now. Instead, I'm still just a hair's breadth away."  

But his disappointment vanished as quickly as it came.  

All in all, the Mistroot Water Ginseng had saved him at least a month of cultivation—its effects equivalent to several high-grade spirit pills.  

Moreover, thanks to his Gathering Yuan Spirit Light, the bottleneck between the third and fourth levels of Qi Refining didn't exist for him.  

With this in mind,  

He circulated the **Five Organs Water Essence Circulation Technique** once more and quickly reached a conclusion.  

Three days!  

At most three more days of cultivating with the Purple Spirit Pills,  

And he would naturally advance to the mid-stage of Qi Refining.
