# Chapter 248: Thousand Illusions

Li Shiming held a jade box in his hand, watching as Venerable Huike flashed into the distance, disappearing after a few more movements. He felt a deep sense of relief in his heart.

Without the backing of the Shushan Sect and the intervention of an elder, it would have been impossible to suppress Venerable Huike.

Venerable Huike had used the Divine Footstep Technique, which Li Shiming recognized, having inherited knowledge of it himself.

Li Shiming truly understood the terrifying power of the Nascent Soul stage's "Inches Apart Like Miles" ability—covering a mile with a single step was akin to the legendary ability to shrink the earth to inches.

He knew that the interval between each use of the Divine Footstep Technique depended on the speed of the cultivator's thoughts. If one's mental speed was fast enough, the technique could be used continuously.

This made cultivators who mastered the Divine Footstep Technique nearly invincible. Li Shiming yearned deeply for this ability at the Nascent Soul stage.

Of course, given his current level of understanding, Li Shiming's perception of Nascent Soul cultivators' abilities was still limited, like a blind man trying to describe an elephant.

The jade box in his hand contained the compensation given by Venerable Huike. One hundred and twenty-eight formation flags had been destroyed, and the pressure from the Nascent Soul mighty had injured him slightly. Naturally, Venerable Huike wouldn't offer second-grade spiritual materials as compensation.

Moreover, Venerable Huike had no choice. As a Nascent Soul mighty, he didn't possess second-grade spiritual materials.

In the end, Venerable Huike had no option but to give Li Shiming a piece of third-grade Mystic Iron as compensation—a metal-attribute material sufficient to forge a flying sword treasure.

This was equivalent to Venerable Huike gifting a treasure outright, a generosity that surprised Li Shiming.

In truth, receiving third-grade forging materials was far better than receiving a ready-made treasure. Treasures crafted by others were tailored to their own characteristics and would never be a perfect fit for someone else.

If Li Shiming could forge the Mystic Iron into a treasure according to his own needs, it might even surpass the other flying sword treasures he currently possessed.

Li Shiming stored the Mystic Iron away but didn't leave immediately. He had a feeling that although Venerable Huike had departed, he was still observing him in some way.

With a faint smile, Li Shiming took out another set of one hundred and twenty-eight formation flags and set up a new formation.

He almost wished Venerable Huike would return and give him another piece of third-grade forging material.

After all, he wasn't in a hurry. He had already reunited with Li Yuanba, who was now safe. Waiting a while longer to escort Li Yuanba was no issue.

---

Venerable Huike was indeed observing Li Shiming from afar. He still harbored suspicions about him, even suspecting that Li Shiming was the one who had set up the surveillance measures.

Li Shiming's location was too sensitive—too close to where Li Yuanba's pass token had disappeared.

In the world of cultivation, there were no coincidences; everything was connected.

Given his Nascent Soul stage, Venerable Huike's intuition was credible.

If not for Li Shiming's identity, Venerable Huike would have captured him and used some means to extract a confession.

The Buddhist sect had many methods to confuse the soul, and with Venerable Huike's cultivation level, forcing Li Shiming to reveal the truth wouldn't be difficult.

But Venerable Huike didn't want to do this. While Li Yuanba's status as a reincarnated Bodhisattva was important, the alliance between the Shushan Sect and the Thousand Leaves Temple was even more critical.

Li Yuanba's identity was still just a speculation. Capturing and interrogating Li Shiming, a true disciple of the Shushan Sect's alchemy lineage, over a mere suspicion would strain relations between the two sects, even if Li Shiming emerged unharmed.

Moreover, soul-confusing techniques would inevitably affect a cultivator's soul, hindering future cultivation.

"Venerable Huike, you didn't find Li Yuanba?" Arhat Zhiming asked upon seeing Venerable Huike's return.

"No. Zhiming, go monitor Li Shiming in the formation about a hundred and twenty miles away. He's a true disciple of the Shushan Sect's alchemy lineage. Don't let him notice you," Venerable Huike instructed, pointing in a direction.

As a venerable, he couldn't monitor Li Shiming indefinitely. He believed Arhat Zhiming, with his mid-stage Foundation Building cultivation, was more than capable of the task.

"Venerable Huike, is Li Shiming connected to Li Yuanba?" Arhat Zhiming asked, puzzled.

Although both cultivators shared the surname Li, it was a common surname in the cultivation world, numbering in the millions if not billions.

"It's just a feeling. The Shushan Sect values Li Shiming highly. Report any findings directly to me—don't act on your own," Venerable Huike emphasized sternly.

"I'll head over now," Arhat Zhiming said, deciding not to question further. If Venerable Huike suspected Li Shiming, there must be a reason.

---

Li Shiming stayed in place for a day, ostensibly to recover from his injuries. In truth, his injuries were minor—his Pure Body allowed him to heal much faster than other cultivators, and he had already recovered by the time he spoke with Venerable Huike.

When he decided to leave, he collected his formation flags.

Though he couldn't pinpoint any surveillance, he felt an uneasy sensation, suspecting the Thousand Leaves Temple was still monitoring him somehow.

He didn't head toward the mountain pass checkpoint but instead changed direction, flying toward the Thousand Illusions Sect.

His clone, Li Yuanba, had gone into seclusion within the Machine Room Space. With ample top-grade spiritual pills and the recent battles, this was an opportune time for rapid improvement. Seclusion in the Machine Room Space wouldn't hinder his cultivation.

This time, Li Shiming didn't use the "Lotus Steps" technique. He was frustrated—just one use of the technique by his clone had drawn the pursuit of a Nascent Soul mighty from the Thousand Leaves Temple.

If he used "Lotus Steps" and was discovered, the temple would surely come after him as well.

So he obediently took out a flying boat, which carried him steadily toward the Thousand Illusions Sect.

The boat bore the Shushan Sect's insignia, ensuring smooth passage even within the Thousand Illusions Sect's territory. He encountered no trouble along the way and soon arrived at the sect's mountain gate.

Li Shiming hadn't informed Yin Shilan in advance, but from their previous messages, he knew she hadn't been in seclusion recently, instead focusing on studying formations.

He took out a flying sword he had refined during his Qi Refining days and left a message on it with his spiritual sense. He then threw the sword, which transformed into a streak of light and vanished.

This was the "Flying Sword Message" technique from the sword cultivator inheritance, recorded in the "Sword Intent Soaring to the Heavens Art."

Other sword cultivator inheritances had similar techniques, differing in application but identical in essence.

After roughly knowing the recipient's location, one could use a refined flying sword to carry a message, imprint the recipient's aura, and let the sword find them automatically.

This was a sword cultivator's method of communication, requiring sword intent.

Li Shiming quite liked the "Flying Sword Message" technique—it reminded him of the homing missiles from his past life.

However, after studying it, he realized the technique couldn't replace homing missiles. At his current level, it could only be used within a hundred miles, and the sword couldn't carry any objects.

The idea of using "Flying Sword Message" as a homing missile was unfeasible, at least not at the Foundation Building stage.

The technique carried no offensive intent, which was why it wasn't blocked by formations.

When encountering a formation, the "Flying Sword Message" would emit a friendly signal, similar to a cultivator's notification spell, allowing it to pass unimpeded.

Before long, a graceful figure appeared on a familiar green flying boat.

---

Though now a Foundation Building cultivator, Yin Shilan hadn't replaced her flying boat. This wasn't unusual—the difference between Qi Refining and Foundation Building boats was minimal. Only at the Golden Core stage would flying boat treasures appear.

But not all Golden Core cultivators possessed such treasures, which were considered luxuries reserved for the elite few with high status and abundant resources.

"Lan'er," Li Shiming called softly, gazing at her flawless, fairy-like beauty.

"Shiming!" Yin Shilan's face lit up with rare excitement, her cheeks flushing slightly at his unexpected visit.

The two stood silently outside the mountain gate, their eyes filled with the joy of reunion, as if trying to imprint each other's images deep into their souls.

"Junior Sister Yin, who is this?" A grating voice shattered the serene moment.

Li Shiming turned to see a young-looking male cultivator. However, having taken the "Eternal Youth Pill," Li Shiming was sensitive to subtle signs of aging.

With one glance, he noticed the fine wrinkles at the corners of the man's eyes and mouth, indicating an age of at least a hundred. The man had likely used skin-care spiritual items to maintain his youthful appearance.

The cultivator was a late-stage Foundation Building true disciple, as indicated by the emblem on his robe.

"Lan'er, let's go to your cave," Li Shiming said with a smile, noticing Yin Shilan's faint look of disgust.

Yin Shilan still had to live in the Thousand Illusions Sect, and Li Shiming didn't want to provoke its true disciples and cause trouble for her. He himself wasn't afraid of trouble.

"Who are you? How dare you call her 'Lan'er'?" The man's face darkened when they ignored him. Hearing the intimate address, he couldn't contain his anger.

The man, Xiao Ke, was a true disciple of the Thousand Illusions Sect. After meeting Yin Shilan, he had become infatuated, pestering her relentlessly in hopes of becoming her Dao companion.

Given Yin Shilan's status as a formation true disciple, Xiao Ke didn't dare go too far, limiting himself to verbal advances.

Yin Shilan, who preferred solitude, spent most of her time in her cave or studying formations with her master. She hadn't mentioned Xiao Ke to Li Shiming to avoid worrying him.

"Lan'er, let's go," Li Shiming said, stepping onto Yin Shilan's flying boat and lightly touching her arm.

Xiao Ke's eyes turned red with rage. In his mind, Yin Shilan belonged to him, and Li Shiming's action crossed a line.

"How dare you kidnap Junior Sister Yin at the Thousand Illusions Sect's gate? You deserve death!" Though furious, Xiao Ke still found a pretext to justify his attack.

Even if questioned later, he could claim it was a misunderstanding. Given his status, killing an outsider wouldn't be a major issue.

As he spoke, Xiao Ke sent a flying sword toward Li Shiming.

He didn't use his signature illusion techniques, as they took too long to kill. He worried the sect's patrolling elders might interfere.

"Be careful!" Yin Shilan exclaimed, summoning a spirit tool shield to block the attack.

She knew Xiao Ke was an experienced Foundation Building cultivator, ranking among the top twenty in combat prowess within the sect.

For a major sect, this meant he was an elite among thousands.

Though Yin Shilan knew Li Shiming had reached Foundation Building, he had cultivated for less time than she had.

Before she could react further, Li Shiming's Central Palace Sword shot out faster than her shield.

The sword clashed with Xiao Ke's in mid-air, its lightning sword intent piercing the latter's defenses and disrupting its spiritual imprint with a surge of terrifying lightning energy.

Xiao Ke felt a sharp pain in his head. Before he could recover, the Central Palace Sword was at his throat.

Li Shiming knew killing a true disciple at the sect's gate, even with justification, would bring trouble.

So he held back. After breaking Xiao Ke's protective spiritual energy, the sword merely pricked him before returning.

At that moment, a figure appeared, unleashing a terrifying aura that enveloped the three.

"What's going on? Why are you fighting at the mountain gate?" A Golden Core elder scanned the scene, his gaze lingering on Li Shiming.

Since both sides were true disciples, the elder didn't immediately restrain them.

"Elder Zheng, Xiao Ke attacked my friend without provocation!" Yin Shilan said angrily, bowing slightly.

"Greetings, Elder Zheng. I am Li Shiming, a true disciple of the Shushan Sect's alchemy lineage. I didn't realize the Thousand Illusions Sect's gate was so strict that even with a true disciple's escort, one could be ambushed!" Li Shiming's tone was far from polite—no one would be happy about an unprovoked attack.

Xiao Ke tried to speak but found himself unable to utter a sound.

Elder Zheng assumed Xiao Ke had no defense and frowned. A true disciple of the Shushan Sect's alchemy lineage was a top-tier figure. Any discourtesy here would reflect poorly on the sect!
