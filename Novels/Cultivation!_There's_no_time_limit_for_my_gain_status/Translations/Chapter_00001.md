# Chapter 1: My Plus-Minus Buttons  

"My head!!"  

This was Jiang Li's first sensation upon regaining consciousness—his skull felt as if it had been kicked square in the face by a donkey, the pain so intense it seemed deformed.  

Struggling to open his eyes, he found himself in a moving carriage. With each jolt of the wooden vehicle, the throbbing in his head intensified, making him grimace in agony.  

Biting back the pain, he took in his surroundings: a cramped space enclosed by darkened wooden planks, with several boys and girls dressed in ancient-style robes sitting crowded together. Some glanced at him with schadenfreude, while most simply ignored him.  

He realized he was lying on the floor. The damp, musty smell and the cold, clammy sensation beneath him were deeply unpleasant. He tried to push himself up, but just then, another wave of excruciating pain erupted in his mind.  

It felt as if his intracranial pressure had suddenly spiked, his brain threatening to burst as a flood of unfamiliar memories flashed before him like a rapidly spinning lantern.  

Jiang Li's legs spasmed, his eyes rolled back, and he passed out once more.  

---  

"Jiang Li! Wake up! Jiang Li!..."  

In his dazed state, Jiang Li heard someone calling his name. His drifting consciousness gradually settled, and he slowly opened his eyes.  

Have I... transmigrated?  

Jiang Li could still recall the acrid smell of smoke when his holographic gaming pod short-circuited and caught fire. The security door of his home was notoriously sturdy—by the time rescuers broke in, he had likely already been reduced to ashes.  

Moreover, this antiquated carriage and the mold-covered wooden planks were things he'd only ever seen in period dramas back in his own time.  

Sifting through the unfamiliar memories now embedded in his mind, Jiang Li began to piece together his current identity and the basics of this world.  

This world closely resembled ancient China—or rather, the fantastical version of ancient times found in legends—because here, immortals were said to truly exist.  

Coincidentally, his current body shared his name, Jiang Li, and was the eldest son of a martial arts family. His name, meaning "dawn," was meant to symbolize a prosperous lineage—essentially a more poetic version of "Bring More Sons."  

Half a month ago, during a routine examination, the original Jiang Li had been fortunate enough to be discovered with spiritual roots—the prerequisite for cultivating immortality.  

---  

Immortal fate was rare. Everyone dreamed of ascending to immortality, and likewise, immortal sects sought to recruit more and better disciples to strengthen their ranks.  

Even a beggar who stumbled upon such an opportunity could soar to greatness. Thus, as long as one possessed spiritual roots, most sects wouldn't turn them away.  

However, Jiang Li's father, the head of the Jiang family, Jiang Yuanshan, had spent too long navigating the complex social webs of the martial world. To secure his son's place in an immortal sect, he had gone to great lengths—and expense—to pull strings.  

Now, Jiang Li was on his way to an immortal sect in this very carriage.  

Pushing himself up from the floor, he found the headache had lessened somewhat. He turned to the person who had woken him—a young boy with a round face, broad nose, and thick lips, whose only small features were his eyes. Despite his comical appearance, the boy carried an air of quiet authority, clearly not from an ordinary family.  

"Heh, Jiang Li, you're finally awake. If you'd slept a few more hours, they might've tossed you out to feed the wolves," the boy said with a grin.  

Jiang Li rubbed his temples, searching his memories, and quickly identified the boy.  

"Thanks, Yan Hong."  

There was still a difference between those who had connections and those who didn't. At the very least, none of the boys and girls in this caravan were commoners.  

This Yan Hong was the son of a prince in their kingdom—not the eldest, but still highly regarded. His status far surpassed that of a mere martial arts family heir like Jiang Li.  

"Heh, what are brothers for? Come on, get up."  

Yan Hong helped Jiang Li to his feet. Despite appearing only thirteen or fourteen, the strength in his arms far exceeded that of Jiang Li's adult self from his past life.  

"Oh, and take this. I managed to snag it back for you, but don't lose it again."  

Before Jiang Li could react, Yan Hong discreetly slipped him a small cloth pouch. Feeling it, Jiang Li recognized the hard, smooth texture—a jade pendant.  

A memory surfaced:  

*"My son, this object is no ordinary trinket. Our family paid a fortune to obtain this boon from an immortal. It will exempt you from menial labor for two years, allowing you to ascend directly onto the immortal path! Guard it with your life—do not lose it!"*  

*"Your journey to seek immortality is long and uncertain. This is the last thing your father and family can do for you. May you become an immortal and bring glory to the Jiang name!"*  

The speaker in the memory was a burly, middle-aged man—the original Jiang Li's father, a top-tier martial artist said to have mastered internal energy.  

---  

Jiang Li quickly checked his person. All his valuables had been stolen. Before setting out, Jiang Yuanshan had provided him with not only the jade pendant but also a considerable sum of gold and silver.  

After confirming the pendant was intact, Jiang Li exhaled in relief. If not for Yan Hong's help, this loss would have spelled disaster.  

Immortality and eternal life had been humanity's eternal fantasy in his past life. The holographic game he'd been playing before his death had been set in a cultivation world—of course he was intrigued by the prospect.  

He had no intention of wasting two years as a menial laborer just because he'd lost the treasure his family had sacrificed so much to obtain.  

Though his start in this world had been a beating, there was a silver lining.  

He had inherited the original Jiang Li's memories, but their personalities and habits were vastly different. Had he been forced to interact closely with the original's family, his odd behavior would surely have raised suspicions.  

This era was deeply superstitious, and with actual supernatural forces at play, if someone had called in an itinerant immortal to "exorcise" him, things could have turned ugly.  

But now that he was away from home, it was a different story. It was common knowledge that cultivating immortality required severing worldly ties. After a few years, not only would personality changes be expected—many cultivators outright disowned their families.  

"Thank you so much, Yan Hong. Without this, I'd be finished."  

Jiang Li carefully tucked the pendant into an inner pocket, wincing as the movement tugged at his injuries.  

"Heh, no need for thanks between brothers," Yan Hong said with a guileless grin.  

"But as my brother, why did you leave me lying on the floor for so long before waking me?"  

Jiang Li's sudden question made Yan Hong's expression turn awkward.  

"Ah, well... you can't blame me for that. Not after what you did to Yan Fengyue."  

Jiang Li froze. Now that he thought about it, the original owner of this body hadn't been a particularly upstanding individual.  

It seemed his death hadn't been entirely unjust—and now Jiang Li had taken his place.  

"She's a princess. Have you any idea how many admirers she has in this caravan? Personally, I'm not fond of her, but by family hierarchy, I still have to call her 'Aunt.'"  

"So, as your brother, the most I could do was help you on the sly."  

Listening to Yan Hong, Jiang Li recalled why his predecessor had been beaten.  

As much as he hated to admit it, from any angle, the original Jiang Li had gotten exactly what he deserved.  

---  

The original Jiang Li had been the epitome of a wastrel—neither scholarly nor martial, barely literate by sheer ancestral luck.  

With his family's influence, bullying men and harassing women had been his daily routine.  

Those scenes in period dramas where young heroes always stumbled upon young masters harassing commoners? They weren't just plot devices—such occurrences were so frequent they were hard to avoid.  

Ironically, Yan Hong had become his friend under similar circumstances. Who'd have thought a fair-weather friend would turn out to be so reliable?  

As for Yan Fengyue, she was the youngest sister of their kingdom's emperor, said to be the daughter of the late king and a foreign woman. With snow-white skin, a tall figure, and the delicate features of a mixed-race beauty, she was leagues beyond the other girls in the caravan.  

But the original Jiang Li had been too dense to realize that while his family might cover for him back home, in this caravan, his status was near the bottom.  

Undeterred, he'd let his hormones override his common sense with consequences too cringe-worthy to recount.  

Getting rejected after confessing was one thing—but why spy on her while she bathed?  

And if he was going to spy, how could he be stupid enough to get caught?  

And if caught, why not run instead of trying to force himself on her?  

The rest was predictable. The white knights had arrived, beaten him senseless, and the original Jiang Li had departed this world, leaving his body for the current Jiang Li to inhabit.  

The most infuriating part? The original hadn't even seen anything worthwhile. Talk about adding insult to injury.  

Yet, recalling the details before the beating, Jiang Li sensed something amiss.  

Yan Fengyue had likely noticed him long before but deliberately lured him to the riverbank—a classic honey trap.  

Tsk. Not so simple after all. As expected of royalty—no truly naive souls among them.  

"Fair enough. My bad. Thanks again, Yan Hong. Got any medicine, though? Those guys took everything on me."  

Jiang Li touched the back of his head—his fingers came away stained red. Bruises and swelling covered his body. Without proper treatment, his condition could easily worsen.  

"Heh, already got you covered."  

Yan Hong handed him a small porcelain jar.  

"This is Pear Blossom Frost, a secret recipe from North Sun Temple. Martial artists would kill for it—great for bruises and cuts, leaves no scars. Even the imperial concubines swear by it."  

"Anyway, patch yourself up and come out for dinner. I can't stay—if people find out I helped you, I'll be ostracized too."  

With that, he opened the carriage door and scampered off with surprising agility for his size.  

Jiang Li sighed. His predecessor's actions had been indefensible. After inciting a mob beating, he'd become public enemy number one. Yan Hong risking association with him was already pushing it.  

No matter. Right now, treating his injuries took priority.  

He removed his clothes and applied the ointment evenly over his wounds, hissing at the sting.  

True to Yan Hong's word, the Pear Blossom Frost worked wonders. Within minutes, a cooling sensation seeped into his injuries, significantly dulling the pain.  

**[Pear Blossom Frost applied. Slow Healing effect active on self.]**  

A line of text appeared in the center of his vision before fading away.  

The sudden development startled and delighted Jiang Li. He immediately focused his mind, summoning a translucent blue screen—just like the interface from his holographic game.  

**[Name: Jiang Li]**  
**[Age: 13]**  
**[Race: Human]**  
**[Main Class: Mortal]**  
**[Subclass 1: None]**  
**[Subclass 2: None]**  
**[Health: 132/200]**  
**[Stamina: 92/160]**  
**[Strength: ]**  
**[Speed: ]**  
**[Constitution: ]**  
**[Spirit: 1]**  
**[Insight: ]**  
**[Cultivation: Yearning Tiger Art Lv0]**  
**[Skills: Appraisal Lv1, Mountain-Cleaving Sword Lv1]**  
**[Buffs: Slow Healing]**  
**[Debuffs: Moderate Injuries, Hunger]**  
**[Slow Healing: Recovers 2 HP per hour. Duration: 6 hours] (+-)**  
**[Moderate Injuries: All stats reduced by 20%. Duration: 72 hours] (+-)**  
**[Hunger: Loses 1 Stamina per hour.]**  

This... this was his game interface from his past life! It had crossed over with him!  

A quick scan told him everything he needed to know. Aside from the Yearning Tiger Art and Mountain-Cleaving Sword—likely remnants of the original Jiang Li—this body was pathetically weak.  

But what thrilled him most were the plus and minus buttons (+-) beside his status effects.  

Somehow, during his death and transmigration, not only had his game interface followed him, but so had the cheat mod that had caused his gaming pod to short-circuit.  

Excited, Jiang Li focused on the plus button beside **[Slow Healing]** and held it for five seconds.  

**[Slow Healing: Recovers 2 HP per hour. Duration: ∞] (-)**  

The duration changed to the infinity symbol.  

It worked!  

Next, he pressed and held the minus button beside **[Moderate Injuries]**. The debuff vanished from his status bar.  

Though his lost HP didn't recover, he immediately felt lighter, as if the injuries no longer hindered his movements.
