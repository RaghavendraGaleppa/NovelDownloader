# Chapter 113: Hold On

Fu Jin paused before continuing. "The Incense Fire Sect in Wuzhou has also grown powerful. It has become too big to be easily quelled, far beyond what the 100,000 Tiger Guard Black Armor Army could suppress. The Sect Master of the Incense Fire Sect, Luo Kai, is a Grandmaster of the Nine Realm Supreme Qi Cultivation. Now that the Empress has ascended the throne, the Qi Grandmasters of the Great Zhou Imperial Court have hidden themselves away and refuse to show themselves."

"That Empress has lost her mind. The 100,000 Tiger Guard Black Armor Army entered Wuzhou, but their blades did not strike the Incense Fire Sect. Instead, they raised their butcher knives against the fourteen sects of Wuzhou."

Fu Jin let out a cold snort as he spoke of this. "That Empress disregards the common people. She is truly inhuman."

Watching Fu Jin jump about and curse the current Empress, wishing he could smash her head apart with his twin hammers, Xu Yunfan quietly contemplated on the side.

For a woman to ascend the throne, her methods and wisdom must be extraordinary. This move likely held deeper meaning.

When those at the top harbor a single thought, it plunges the common people into a state of suffering. Having come from Wuzhou, Xu Yunfan understood this deeply.

"Senior Brother, by doing this, the Empress has likely pushed the sects to the opposite side. What exactly is she trying to do?"

Hearing this, Fu Jin's curses immediately quieted down. He let out a breath, brushing the dust off his body as he sighed. "When the people from the Nine Luminaries Sect entered the Imperial Capital, they left without saying a word, as if nothing had happened."

He paused, then said, "Only Sect Master Hong probably knows a thing or two about the inside story. We don't need to be too anxious. If the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up. The most urgent matter is for you to prepare well for the True Disciple Ceremony."

Xu Yunfan agreed readily, then recounted what had just happened to Fu Jin.

Fu Jin sneered coldly upon hearing it. "You did well, Junior Brother. You can be even more unbridled in the future. That Qi Huan is the head disciple of the Hidden Blade Pavilion. His talent is excellent, and his fast sword technique is indeed superb. However, he is narrow-minded and intolerant. If things don't go his way, he holds a grudge and always schemes to cause trouble in the dark."

He looked utterly disdainful. "He's the same type as their Hall Master. If you run into him again, find a chance to give him a hammer. Our Casting Hall may keep a low profile, but we aren't the type to keep our tails tucked in when bullied."

"..."

In the following days, Xu Yunfan stayed indoors, constantly practicing the Cicada Strength. With the assistance of the Secret Martial Art, the Cicada Body Refining Technique, and sufficient medicinal pills and exotic beast meat as supplements, his proficiency increased rapidly.

At most, within five months, he would be able to max out his Bone Tempering proficiency.

...

Time flew by. Xu Yunfan basically never left his courtyard, spending his days inside refining the Cicada Strength.

A month later, the fine steel walls of the Heavenly Work City gleamed coldly. The noon sun cast the shadows of the battlements onto the bluestone bricks.

The city became increasingly crowded with martial artists, converging from all directions. At the North Gate of Heavenly Work City, sixteen Dragon Blood Horses exhaled breaths smelling of sulfur, and the玄 iron carriage left ruts half a foot deep on the blue stone slabs.

A burly driver pressed a stone lock down with a single arm, the veins on his wrist twisting like iron chains. Opposite him, the Chief Escort of the Long Wind Escort Agency had sweat dripping from his forehead, shattering three tiles as they competed for who would enter the city first.

These two factions already had old and new grudges. If not for the Nine Luminaries Sect and the Heavenly Work Cave territory behind them, they would have started fighting right there.

Once the guests for the ceremony were seated.

In the vast plaza of the Heavenly Work Cave's Mechanism City, the seven statues of the founding ancestors were polished to a chilling gleam. On the platform cast from hundred-refined steel, Hong Baichuan's muscles bulged like old tree roots beneath his brocade robe.

This Grandmaster, who had become the number one in Cangzhou with the "Nine Revolutions Celestial Pivot Vein Forging Method," left a half-inch shoe print on the ironwood platform with every step he took. The Lord of the Red Crocodile Gang, watching from below, squinted as he counted the depressions.

"Three steps to shake a tiger, seven steps to shatter a mountain. This old ghost Hong's washing marrow strength has reached a state of perfection. If not for being past his peak and having no chance of breaking through, he might have actually stepped into the visceral refining realm."

"Heroes and talents of the world! Today is the day of the True Disciple Ceremony for our Heavenly Work Cave's Casting Hall. I thank you all for gracing us with your presence."

"Since its establishment, the Heavenly Work Cave has always adhered to the principle of 'Using vessels to carry the Dao, and using the Dao to control vessels.' The Casting Hall is the cornerstone of our Heavenly Work Cave, so selecting true disciples is of utmost importance. This time, we have invited various sects to observe the ceremony, and we also wish to take this opportunity to reopen the Armory."

Hong Baichuan's voice was loud and resonant, echoing over the plaza.

Hearing that the Armory was to be reopened, even the envoy from the Nine Luminaries Sect couldn't help but sit up straighter.

Below, the Sect Master of the Green Phoenix Sword Sect revealed a look of understanding.

"Heh, this old ghost Hong's ultimate goal is probably this. The True Disciple Ceremony is just a means to an end... Truly a money-grubber!"

"If he weren't such a money-grubber, how would he have built this Mechanism City? It's truly unique in the Great Zhou."

The speaker was a bearded man, the Head of the Observation Mountain Gate, one of the Eight Sects of Cangzhou. His face carried a hint of emotion, somewhat envious of the Heavenly Work Cave's ability to make money.

After Hong Baichuan finished speaking, he and Zhan Yan both looked toward Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan let out a breath. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back shimmered with a dark, lustrous luster under the sunlight.

It was time for him to take the stage.

The nearly four-hundred-pound hammer did not affect his movements in the slightest. His steps were silent, his movements gentle, yet they gave people a sense of immense power.

Zhan Yan stood on the side of the high platform, watching Xu Yunfan walk up, a hint of relief flashing in his eyes.

He stepped forward and cupped his fists to the crowd below. "Everyone, this is Xu Yunfan, the newly promoted true disciple of our Casting Hall."

His gaze swept over the nine peaks and six divisions of the Heavenly Work Cave, a smile appearing on his face as he cupped his fists again. "If anyone within the Heavenly Work Cave is unconvinced, you may come forward to challenge him. If you can win, you will obtain a position as a true disciple of the Casting Hall!"

As soon as these words were spoken, many disciples who had been kept in the dark immediately caused an uproar, discussing amongst themselves, their eyes filled with the desire to give it a try.

A true disciple of a hall!

That represented that he would be trained with all resources available, without reservation.

Looking at Xu Yunfan standing on the high platform, the heavy hammer behind him, the forged head showing purple scars under the sunlight. Each lightning pattern was a groove personally knocked out by Zhan Yan using the tail bone of a Flood Dragon. Who could enjoy such treatment?

The sound of metal grinding came from the guest seats. Yue Shan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion was grinding his back molars. The newly installed bronze front teeth were still stained with cedar wood shavings. Previously, when Fu Jin threw him, his teeth were shaken loose, and he had no choice but to go to the Mechanism Hall to install two new ones.

After waiting for a while and seeing no one make a move, Zhan Yan pointed toward the back where a fire hole burned with flickering light.

"Walk out from the Quenching Cave. If you pass the Quenching Trial, you will be granted the True Disciple Token!"

Someone below let out a light laugh. "The Heavenly Work Cave is really running out of people. Just letting such a disciple take a trip through the Quenching Trial counts as obtaining the status of a true disciple. It's barely presentable."

"Hold on!"

A light shout interrupted the existing procedure.

Among the other seven great sects, the envoy from the Nine Luminaries Sect finally showed a look of "it's finally starting."

The true disciples of any sect are fought for with fists. How could it be so easy to just walk through it lightly?

Qi Huan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion walked into the arena. After saluting the various parties, he looked at Xu Yunfan and said loudly, "Qi Huan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion. The martial art I cultivate is the Thousand Layer Wave Sword. I am a Three-Practice Martial Artist. I have come to challenge you. Do you dare to fight me? If you are unwilling, the Casting Hall must allocate a true disciple position to my Hidden Blade Pavilion!"

As he spoke, the fine steel sword case on his back slammed heavily onto the ground. The immense force shook the ground slightly, and the fine steel sword case actually sank three inches into the brick.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, took down the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back, walked down from the high platform, and stood opposite Qi Huan.

"Why wouldn't I dare?"
