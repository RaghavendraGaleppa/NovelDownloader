# Chapter 254: The Final Opportunity for Longevity

Xu Yunfan saw it all and naturally understood what the other was thinking.

A hint of a smile appeared on his face, pretending not to notice as he said, "I didn't expect to run into you here, Su Xiong. It's truly a case of 'where in life do we not meet again'."

Su Zhenhe was taken aback for a moment, the complex emotions on his face completely fading as he began to ponder the phrase.

A moment later, he looked up and praised, "Xu Xiong is truly a man of great talent. That line is excellent, like a sudden awakening, truly exquisite."

He brushed the dry grass off his clothes and walked up to Xu Yunfan, cupping his fist in salute.

"How did Xu Xiong come to be here?"

Xu Yunfan was speechless. He hadn't expected that a casual remark of his could completely dissolve the killing intent in Su Zhenhe's heart.

"I accidentally fell in from another秘境 (Secret Realm) entrance," he said casually.

Before Su Zhenhe could ask more, Xu Yunfan took the initiative to ask, "Su Xiong, do you know about the palace below?"

Su Zhenhe fell silent for a moment, shifting his gaze from Xu Yunfan to the white jade palace emitting a clear radiance below.

His fingers unconsciously stroked the Xuanzhen Sect token hanging at his waist, as if weighing whether he should reveal this information.

At that moment, Su Zhenhe suddenly recalled Xu Yunfan's ghostly, silent movements from just before. His pupils couldn't help but contract sharply. When Xu Yunfan had closed in on him moments ago, he had been as silent and ghostly as a phantom, undetectable even to a true disciple of the Xuanzhen Sect like himself.

His throat moved slightly as he suppressed the shock in his heart and asked in a hoarse voice, "Xu Xiong, what is your current martial realm?"

"Seventh Realm of Martial Dao, Marrow Cleansing."

Xu Yunfan said it lightly, but those six short words exploded in Su Zhenhe's mind like thunder, making his head buzz.

His expression changed drastically, and he instinctively took half a step back, his back pressing against the wall. His voice even changed pitch. "How is that possible?!"

The person before him was barely in his early twenties. Even if he had started cultivating in his mother's womb, it would be absolutely impossible to reach the Marrow Cleansing Realm at such a young age. It was a realm that even the elders of the Xuanzhen Sect had to toil for decades to possibly reach!

One wrong step, and one could waste their entire life without being able to advance further.

Hearing Su Zhenhe's exclamation, Xu Yunfan let out a soft chuckle and said nothing. The moment his slightly bent fingertip moved, a wisp of tangible energy burst forth, tearing through the air like an arrow and blasting the hard stone wall three inches from Su Zhenhe's ear to pieces.

As stone fragments flew, the energy's force didn't diminish, leaving a three-inch-deep hole in the rock wall behind, its edges smooth as if carved by a sword.

Su Zhenhe stood frozen on the spot, cold sweat beading on his temples. If that finger had been half an inch to the side...

"Marrow Qi reaching the divine, lifting the light as if it were heavy, transforming force into Gang..."

Su Zhenhe's face was filled with shock. This was something that had never happened since ancient times. No one had ever reached Marrow Cleansing at such a young age. Even the Li surname who founded the Great Zhou Empire eight hundred years ago only entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm at the age of thirty.

"Since Xu Xiong has asked..."

Su Zhenhe finally spoke, his voice low. "I did indeed see relevant records in the Xuanzhen Sect's *Qingyue Unusual Records*. It is said that this white jade palace is not from this world. Instead, two thousand years ago, when the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was about to dissipate but hadn't yet fully done so, it flew down from beyond the heavens, crashing through two layers consecutively, tearing open a passage to the Secret Realm and falling into it."

Speaking of this, Su Zhenhe turned his head to look at the white jade palace below, which was continuously emitting a clear radiance, his expression carrying a hint of unimaginable fanaticism.

"Your Tiangong Cave has too short a history. Too many things happened two thousand years ago, completely causing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to disperse. This white jade palace appeared after a great battle back then."

Great battle?

Xu Yunfan's eyebrows slightly raised, and the muscles under his dragon scale armor unconsciously tensed.

He could feel the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace on his back trembling slightly, as if sensing something from that palace.

That battle two thousand years ago definitely held a great secret within.

Seeing the inquiring look in Xu Yunfan's eyes, Su Zhenhe didn't hesitate and said directly, "The path to longevity. Back then, those who had cultivated to the absolute peak in the world, the so-called Land Immortal Realm in the martial world, fought for the last opportunity for longevity after the spiritual energy of heaven and earth dissipated."

Martial cultivation, at its end, although it grants the power to shake mountains and cut rivers, does not increase one's lifespan by much. Even a supreme grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation, through various secret methods to extend life and nurturing with spiritual pills and precious herbs, absolutely cannot live beyond three hundred years.

One barrier, a heavenly chasm. To live past three hundred is a consensus in the world that no one has achieved.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly. He suddenly remembered what the mysterious woman in white had said back in the Extreme Dao Remains: that in two thousand years, she had only met two or three people.

That person was most likely an Extreme Dao expert from that era, but how could she have lived for over two thousand years?

Relying on the slumber of the Source Ancient Jade Tablet?

"Interesting."

Xu Yunfan grinned, revealing his stark white teeth. "Continue."

Su Zhenhe glanced at the dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan's body, which was faintly glowing with a dark golden luster. He couldn't help but clench his fingers slightly. The oppressive feeling the other gave him was too intense, like a giant demon squatting on his chest, making it difficult to breathe.

Even if Su Zhenhe was a genius, facing a Marrow Cleansing master directly, no matter how much he could jump around, even if he possessed a divine weapon, the weapon on the other person was no worse, especially that dragon scale armor which was visually stunning. It opened and closed with Xu Yunfan's breathing, as if it were a living thing.

"...The ancient texts record that at the time, seven major sects sent out their elite explorers, including the three Supreme Elders of my Xuanzhen Sect, the Heaven Sword Pei Wujiu of the Sword Pavilion, the Vajra Master of the Amitabha Temple..."

"Get to the point. What happened to the people who went in?"

"Nobody came out."

Su Zhenhe's voice grew even lower. "Everyone who entered the palace vanished without a trace. Later on, the various sects joined forces to cover up the news. The white jade palace spontaneously sank into the mountain, hidden from sight, and this history gradually faded... I didn't expect it to appear today..."

He glanced at Xu Yunfan before him, having a vague guess in his heart.

According to the sect's records, the various spiritual energies within the Small World Secret Realm are interconnected. If one part is moved, the whole is affected.

This Small World Secret Realm was originally only accessible to martial artists at the Outer Three Harmony Realm, but suddenly a Marrow Cleansing master has appeared.

God knows how great an opportunity this person has obtained.

Su Zhenhe couldn't help but ask, "Xu, Xu Xiong, did you break through to Marrow Cleansing within the Secret Realm?"

"Naturally. The spiritual energy here is abundant, and the environment for a breakthrough is far better than the outside world. If it weren't for the excessive number of demonic beasts, I would want to live here long-term."

Although he had been fully immersed in cultivation these past few days, demonic beasts still charged at him. Moreover, it seemed that after a month, in the same location, the intensity of the demonic beasts encountered would increase by several levels.

You even want to live here long-term.

Su Zhenhe gave a dry laugh and didn't respond. If one could truly live here long-term, this Small World Secret Realm would probably have been built full of bases by the six major sects.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan turned his head and took a few steps to the edge of the cliff.

He narrowed his eyes and looked towards the east side of the white jade palace. Seven figures were rapidly ascending the broken stone steps. The energy bursting from the feet of the leader was actually scorching the moss, leaving charred marks.
