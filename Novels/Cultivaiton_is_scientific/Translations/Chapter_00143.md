# Chapter 143: Clone

Li Shiming battled his clone while simultaneously employing various methods to observe if the clone was leaking any external aura.

Besides the array formation, the main body and the clone maintained an active connection through their spiritual senses.

After an entire night, he found no anomalies with the clone.

He left the clone within the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array,' where it transformed into a state of a refined corpse.

The clone could no longer cultivate the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art.' The spiritual energy vortex was already saturated, and continuing cultivation would likely force a breakthrough attempt.

He needed to wait a while longer, verifying some ideas before considering the clone's breakthrough.

Furthermore, the clone's breakthrough needed to be at its limit before attempting it. The clone's life state had indeed reached its limit in terms of physique, spiritual power, and spiritual sense, even surpassing ordinary peak Qi Refining cultivators.

However, the clone's refined corpse state had not yet reached its peak.

Li Shiming had no research into the clone's living corpse state, but he followed his own judgment, waiting for the clone's refined corpse body to reach its limit before considering advancement.

Besides, with the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array' in place, reaching the copper corpse's peak was not difficult and wouldn't take too long.

Just like his copper corpse, it couldn't stay in the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array' and was always kept within the corpse-containing bag.

Li Shiming had the copper corpse for less than three years, and it was under the effect of the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array' that the copper corpse had reached its peak.

He sent a message to Yu Yongan of the Qianlong Trading Company, ordering a high-grade gold-attributed sword. As for defensive magic tools, he hadn't considered them.

Even the high-grade gold-attributed sword was for temporary use. Once the clone advanced to Foundation Establishment, he would need to consider super-grade swords or spiritual artifacts.

He did have a spiritual artifact longsword, but it wasn't gold-attributed and wasn't suitable for the clone.

The reason he didn't buy defensive magic tools was that the defense of high-grade defensive magic tools was likely inferior to the clone's skin defense. Even super-grade defensive magic tools might not be as strong.

Of course, although the clone didn't have a suitable weapon, it could still use the third-grade sword base at any time. The third-grade sword base was much more powerful than any spiritual artifact, except for the inability to attack from a distance, everything else far exceeded the spiritual artifacts used by Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Yu Yongan replied quickly, telling Li Shiming that the trading company had a suitable high-grade gold-attributed sword, and he would send it over immediately, priced at three thousand spiritual stones.

In less than thirty minutes, Li Shiming received the ordered high-grade gold-attributed sword, the 'Golden Light Piercing Sky Sword,' which was of excellent quality.

Li Shiming directly refined it using the 'Dragon Finishing Touch Art.' The special connection between him and the clone allowed them to share magic tools, which had been proven in practice.

Whether the magic tool was refined by the main body or the clone, it was equivalent to self-refinement for both bodies.

The only exception was their respective third-grade sword bases, which were fused with the body and only recognized the body's control, not the soul.

Li Shiming also refined the super-grade armor, a compensation from the Yun Clan, named 'Vajra Body Protection Armor,' which seemed to have a connection with him.

This Vajra had no connection with the Buddhist Vajra but was named after a material called Vajra Crystal in the armor.

When crafting magic tools, artificers would give their creations a name, and the name and usage details of the magic tool could be learned during refinement.

The characteristic of this 'Vajra Body Protection Armor' was comprehensive protection. It had two forms: one was worn inside the robe for close-fitting defense, and the other was to activate full protection, transforming into a full-body armor that covered the head, hands, and feet.

Unfortunately, with his current Qi Refining fifth-level strength, the 'Vajra Body Protection Armor' could only last for ten seconds before exhausting his spiritual power.

The clone could use it first, but it wouldn't be of much use. The clone's defense was too strong, and Li Shiming deeply suspected whether the defense of this super-grade 'Vajra Body Protection Armor' could match the clone's.

Li Shiming had an important problem to solve, which was the Foundation Establishment cultivation method.

He was used to being prepared. He himself was still a long way from advancing to the Foundation Establishment stage, but the clone was very close.

With the clone's aptitude, he wouldn't consider ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivation methods, but now he couldn't even get ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivation methods.

He placed this matter as a priority, otherwise, even if the clone advanced to Foundation Establishment, there would be no main cultivation method to practice.

He was considering whether he could propose the matter of Foundation Establishment cultivation methods to the sect when he reached the level of an advanced array master.

The reason for this consideration was that he was learning array knowledge too quickly. Now his array starlight sea had expanded more than doubled, and he felt that reaching the ninth level of Qi Refining and trying to break through was not as fast as becoming an advanced array master.

When he was cultivating the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art,' a flash of inspiration came to him, and he looked at the clone in the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array' in a refined corpse state.

The clone walked out of the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array,' and after leaving the ghost domain environment, it transformed into a human.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist!" Li Shiming said with a smile.

"Helping you is helping me!" The clone's handsome smile was dazzling.

Li Shiming had a flash of inspiration, thinking that both he and the clone were cultivating the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' and were both in the Qi Refining stage.

The clone was a Heavenly Spiritual Root, with a cultivation speed of 100, while the main body's cultivation speed was only 38.

Since the clone could no longer add spiritual power to the spiritual energy vortex, he might as well input the spiritual power generated by cultivating the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' into the main body's spiritual energy vortex.

Spiritual power recognized its owner, and normally, the feasibility of this idea was almost zero.

Although spiritual power was extremely obedient within a cultivator's body, that was because the spiritual power was cultivated by the cultivator themselves and carried the cultivator's own soul imprint.

The same spiritual power, when entering another cultivator's body, would be a highly destructive attack.

Li Shiming's inspiration came from the fact that he and the clone shared the same soul. The clone's refined corpse spirit was essentially separated from his blood, and coupled with the clone's special nature, the clone and the main body were now truly sharing a soul.

Of course, he couldn't experiment with cultivation right away. The clone extended a finger, with a point of spiritual power flickering on it.

The clone gently touched the main body, and this point of spiritual power entered the body along the skin.

If anything went wrong, the clone could withdraw this point of spiritual power at any time, but obviously, there was no need for that.

This point of spiritual power entered the main body without causing any damage. Although it wasn't particularly compatible with the main body's spiritual power, that was because the clone's spiritual power intensity far exceeded the main body's.

"I'm so stupid, why didn't I think of this sooner!" Li Shiming said, slapping his head in annoyance.

He seemed to have forgotten that he didn't dare to summon the clone from the machine room space before, and the main body couldn't enter the machine room space either.

Although his cultivation speed was currently considered relatively fast, looking at Ren Fei'er, who was only a year younger than him, was already at the eighth level of Qi Refining.

This was the difference in talent. If he could make up for this gap through the clone, then the clone's role would be too great.

The spirit gathering array gathered the spiritual energy from the low-grade spiritual vein into the array. The main body and the clone sat back-to-back.

The 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' was activated simultaneously, and Li Shiming quickly realized how big the difference in cultivation between him and the clone was.

He and the clone simultaneously imported one hundred points of gold-attributed spiritual energy into their bodies. The main body converted 38 points of spiritual power that could be imported into the spiritual energy vortex after running the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' in the body, while the clone converted all 100 points of spiritual energy into spiritual power that could be imported into the spiritual energy vortex.

This was the difference, a huge difference.

Seemingly only a difference of more than two times, but the main body had gone through various means, even breaking through its own limit absorption rate, to reach the current level.

The clone, however, was stable at this level because the absorption limit was 100.

The spiritual power converted by the clone through the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Art' was imported into the main body.

Li Shiming felt the impact on the main body's meridians, but fortunately, he had cultivated two body refining techniques, and his physique was extremely strong, so he withstood the spiritual power transmitted by the peak Qi Refining clone.

The clone's spiritual power and the main body's spiritual power were introduced into the spiritual energy vortex together. The spiritual energy vortex shook slightly, but it quickly stabilized.

Only at this time did he confirm the truth and feasibility of his idea.

But he encountered a new problem, which was that the spiritual energy produced by the low-grade spiritual vein was far from enough for him and the clone to cultivate at the same time.

This cultivation, according to IBMz15's calculations, had increased his cultivation speed to 138, and theoretically, 100+38 equals 138, even if there were losses in between, it shouldn't only be this speed.

Of course, this cultivation speed was almost no different from a Heavenly Spiritual Root, but he was not satisfied yet.

He clearly had a Heavenly Spiritual Root peak Qi Refining cultivator working for him, but in reality, it didn't achieve the imagined effect.

He thought of the rich spiritual energy of the Nine Peaks, and it seemed that he could try to apply for a cave dwelling in the Nine Peaks.

After the cultivation, the clone transformed back into a refined corpse and returned to the 'Netherworld Ghost Realm Array,' while Li Shiming's main body went to the Nine Peaks of the sect.

Coming to the Nine Peaks naturally meant finding Uncle-Master Zhuge first. If he went directly to the Affairs Pavilion, he was afraid that the Qi Refining senior brothers in the Affairs Pavilion wouldn't have the authority to handle this matter, which would be even more troublesome.

"Uncle-Master Zhuge, I'm here to trouble you again!" Li Shiming said, saluting as he entered the Spirit Machine Pavilion.

"It's not to apply for the advanced array master assessment, is it?" Uncle-Master Zhuge said jokingly.

Of course, he was joking. If advanced array masters were so easy to advance to, the sect wouldn't have a headache over the scarcity of advanced array masters.

"Let's talk about it in two years. I'm here to ask if I, as an intermediate array master, can apply for a cave dwelling in the Nine Peaks?" Li Shiming said, spreading his hands.

Uncle-Master Zhuge ignored his talk about two years, thinking he was joking too.

He did hear Li Shiming's request clearly, and was first stunned, then pondered for a moment.

"Eagle Beak Island is your private property. Theoretically, you can apply for another cave dwelling!" he said with a smile, then asked, "You're living well on Eagle Beak Island, why do you want to find a cave dwelling in the Nine Peaks?"

Although the spiritual vein of Eagle Beak Island was a bit poor, the geographical location was very good.

Besides, with Li Shiming's three spiritual roots talent, that low-grade spiritual vein was enough for him.

"Well, I'm considering that it's more convenient to do tasks, and having a cave dwelling in the Nine Peaks can better serve the sect!" Li Shiming naturally wouldn't answer honestly.

"Alright, even I don't believe this reason. I'll give the Affairs Pavilion a heads-up, you go to the Affairs Pavilion to handle it!" Uncle-Master Zhuge waved his hand and said unhappily.

"Uncle-Master, I heard that intermediate array masters have benefits in spiritual vein applications. I wonder if you can arrange a cave dwelling with a stronger spiritual vein?" Li Shiming asked a little embarrassed.

"You came here for this, didn't you? Intermediate array masters do have benefits in this regard. Do you want a low-grade spiritual vein?" Uncle-Master Zhuge pointed at him and asked with a smile, shaking his head.

"Can it be higher? A low-grade spiritual vein is a bit insufficient!" Li Shiming knew that now was not the time to be polite, and quickly fought for it.

"I understand what you mean. Intermediate array masters can apply for a mid-grade spiritual vein at most. I'll give you the reason that you need to research array formations!" Uncle-Master Zhuge said, operating on the identity jade disc.

The sect's benefits for intermediate array masters were very high, to some extent possessing benefits similar to those of Foundation Establishment cultivators, but Li Shiming had only been an intermediate array master for too short a time, and had contributed too little to the sect.

If it weren't for Uncle-Master Zhuge's help, Li Shiming wouldn't be able to apply for a mid-grade spiritual vein cave dwelling on his own.

Li Shiming turned around and went to the Affairs Pavilion. He didn't recognize the Qi Refining cultivator he met this time.

He still used spiritual stones to pave the way, taking out ten spiritual stones and handing them to the handling cultivator.

"Because you haven't officially joined the Nine Peaks in the sect, the cave dwellings you can choose are only within this range. Choose one!" The handling cultivator accepted the spiritual stones and opened the virtual form of the three-dimensional map.

Because it was set within the Nine Peaks range, and it was a mid-grade spiritual vein cave dwelling, there weren't many cave dwellings to choose from.

On the three-dimensional map, there were only thirty or so cave dwellings.

"Senior Brother, do you have any suggestions?" Li Shiming looked at the thirty or so cave dwellings. He originally wanted to choose a cave dwelling on Dui Peak, but seeing that the vacant cave dwelling on Dui Peak was very close to the Spirit Machine Pavilion, he didn't want to choose it.

Being so close to an advanced array master, even with array formations for isolation, he felt unsafe.

It wasn't that he was worried about Uncle-Master Zhuge peeping, but that he had too many secrets, and if any advanced array master accidentally discovered anything unusual, it would be a big trouble.

"This cave dwelling on Xun Peak has just become vacant. It originally belonged to a senior brother at the ninth level of Qi Refining, who accidentally died outside. It has been confirmed that he has died. The cave dwelling is close to the mid-grade spiritual field, the environment is excellent, and at the same time, there is no second cave dwelling in a large area nearby," the handling cultivator said, gently pointing at a place.

Spiritual stones were never spent in vain, which had been proven many times.

Cultivators didn't have the saying that the cave dwellings of dead people were unlucky. When it came down to it, any cave dwelling in a ten-thousand-year-old sect had had dead people as its previous owners.

"This cave dwelling it is!" Li Shiming said without hesitation, gently pointing at the cave dwelling.
