# Chapter 80: Three Years of Growth

The discussion between the two second-stage Golden Core realm senior apprentices grew increasingly profound, leaving Han Yue unable to contribute and only able to listen quietly. However, their scholarly debate citing classics attracted many disciples to follow along. For a time, the mountain was abuzz with transmitted magical messages, giving Han Yue an eye-opening experience!

Ultimately, Miaosheng and Miaoyun reached a consensus. On their next journey down the mountain, they would head straight for the sea to capture that giant starfish and bring it back to the sect for everyone to practice on. Then they could all evaluate it together.

Returning to his cave dwelling, Han Yue immediately immersed himself in cultivation. He had made a three-year agreement with his master, during which he needed to master three divine abilities: "Breath Concealment Art," "Silken Lightning Garment," and "Primordial Great Hand Seal." Additionally, he had four texts to study: "Upper Cavern Nine Heavens Spirit Refinement Treasure Secret Record," "Divine Thunder Palace Sect Records of the Jade Sky Realm," "Secret Sect Transmission of Various Classified Divine Arts," and "Sect Answers to Disciples' Questions." Time suddenly became extremely tight!

Han Yue imposed stricter discipline on himself, forcing himself to focus with greater intensity as he embarked on this new round of cultivation.

"Silken Lightning Garment" had already been thoroughly comprehended through the "Primordial Gourd Heart-Questioning Meditation Mat," allowing him to begin practicing immediately. This was yet another long-term cultivation method!

During the process, the practitioner needed to unravel the neatly woven wire armor with their own magic power, then condense their magic power into threads according to a unique method and weave them together with the original armor in a specific pattern. This was an extremely meticulous task!

Each piece of wire armor contained three thousand complex knots that served as its magical conduits. Han Yue needed to dismantle and replace each knot one by one, weaving in his own magic threads. Only after all three thousand knots were rewoven would the "Silken Lightning Garment" be considered complete. The originally mesh-like wire armor would transform into coiled strands due to the incorporation of numerous magic threads, greatly enhancing its defensive capabilities.

Moreover, upon reaching mastery, the practitioner could transform it into permanent inner armor residing in their consciousness during the Golden Core formation, protecting not just the physical body but also the soul! Han Yue approached this divine ability with great seriousness. Over the past few years, the wire armor's defensive capabilities had proven invaluable in many situations, becoming an indispensable skill for him.

Han Yue allocated half an hour each day to dismantling the wire armor, completing the modification of roughly one knot every three days. Calculating this way, he would certainly finish all modifications before reaching the second stage. Thus, Han Yue resumed an extremely regimented lifestyle.

Each day consisted of refining techniques, consecrating artifacts, studying texts, and participating in group discussions. When restlessness struck, he would fly around Wuhui Peak for a while, practicing with his "Demon-Slaying Sword." Life couldn't be more delightful!

Time flew by unnoticed during this process. The first year passed in the blink of an eye. Han Yue successfully mastered both "Breath Concealment Art" and "Primordial Great Hand Seal," adding two more rare green-grade divine abilities to his repertoire. Both were recorded on new pages of the "Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods."

Han Yue had also grown accustomed to life in the Divine Thunder Palace, becoming familiar with all disciples who remained at the sect. Though they might not have met in person, they had all communicated through "Minor Thunder Sound Technique."

The second year passed without major incidents. During this time, Han Yue thoroughly studied all four texts, significantly broadening his knowledge. He completely shed his novice status, gaining deeper understanding of the cultivation world. With approval from the "Lineage" True Person, he entered the "Divine Thunder Stele Forest" for the second time. After careful selection, he obtained "Lineage Revised Divine Thunder Talisman Compendium"—another secret text revised and verified by the "Lineage" True Person, containing extensive knowledge about talismans essential for cultivation, artifact forging, and technique refinement. The sheer volume of information in this single text surpassed that of the previous four combined.

During these two years, Han Yue attended two scripture lectures hosted by the "Lineage" True Person, covering "Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Method" and "Five Viscera Refinement Dao Treasure Manual"—clearly tailored for Han Yue and Wang Mumu. Han Yue found these immensely beneficial. He also listened in on countless online discussions among fellow disciples, many of which contained high-quality exchanges about cultivation that proved quite enlightening.

By year's end, having achieved significant progress in his studies, Han Yue felt it inappropriate to always benefit from others without contributing. So he took time to share his experiences and improvements regarding "Minor Thunder Sound Technique" information compilation. This sharing session made Han Yue instantly famous, earning recognition from numerous disciples including the "Lineage" True Person and Shang Xi. The "Lineage" elder even revised the main text of "Minor Thunder Sound Technique" as a result. Han Yue received 500 sect contribution points—enough to exchange for half a third-grade treasure material—and helped Wang Mumu greatly advance his "Minor Thunder Sound Technique," eliminating the brain-scrambling noise. A single move yielding multiple gains!

In the third year, Han Yue entered the "Divine Thunder Stele Forest" again, obtaining three more texts: "Divine Thunder Spiritual Objects Study," "Spirit Fire Alchemy Treasure Record," and "Array Inquiry of Longevity," covering advanced cultivation knowledge in natural history, fire control for alchemy, and formation arrays respectively.

Learning without thinking is labor lost; thinking without learning is perilous. After three years of dedicated study, Han Yue was completely transformed. Both in capability and knowledge, he had become a qualified major sect cultivator. Among the four essential elements—techniques, arts, physique, and artifacts—he had developed superior potential in three (techniques, arts, and artifacts), needing only continued cultivation to surpass his peers. Even in his relatively weakest area—physique—thanks to tempering through "Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Method" and nourishment from "Sweet Dew," he was no weaker than others.

These were Han Yue's most joyful three years, his most diligent three years, and his fastest-growing three years. Since joining the Divine Thunder Palace, his progress had been rapid and constant, continually surprising even himself.

One day, Han Yue summoned the "Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods" to examine his attribute changes:
