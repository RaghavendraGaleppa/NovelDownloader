# Chapter 115: Fury

Li Shiming also felt a trace of reluctance in his heart. Having spent some time with Ren Fei'er, he found her very modern.

Yes, the term "modern" didn't exist in this world, but Ren Fei'er's personality and behavior were very much like the women from his previous life. Through her, he seemed to catch a glimpse of his past.

The jade token in his hand puzzled him. Could Ren Fei'er not be a demonic sect cultivator? Otherwise, how could a mere jade token allow him to contact her?

Li Shiming was familiar with the sect's grand formation, which extended communication range to a thousand miles within the sect's territory. This was why identity jade slips could be used to communicate with fellow sect members within the sect's boundaries. However, he had never heard of the grand formation being used to communicate with outsiders.

Regardless, this was good news. At least he felt that Ren Fei'er's sect wasn't an enemy—otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to establish communication.

"Junior Brother, thanks to your bronze corpse, we managed to drive away that demonic cultivator!" The stationed cultivator approached Li Shiming with a smile.

"Senior Brother was the main force. The bronze corpse only served as a delaying tactic," Li Shiming replied modestly.

Through this battle, he had also learned how to use the bronze corpse effectively. The bronze corpse was indeed formidable in close combat, especially against cultivators of the same level—it could completely tie them down.

As a sword cultivator, Li Shiming currently focused on long-range attacks. With the bronze corpse engaging enemies up close and him attacking from a distance, he could maximize the sword cultivator's offensive potential while ensuring his own safety.

Previously, he had worried that the bronze corpse might attract unwanted attention. But after becoming a formation master, revealing the bronze corpse was no longer a major concern. The stationed cultivator's attitude made it clear that the sect wouldn't react much to the bronze corpse's existence.

"The Han Clan is truly finished this time!" The stationed cultivator had just emerged from a fierce battle, yet his face couldn't hide his joy.

Before encountering the Profound Nether Sect cultivator, even with Li Shiming's assurance that he would deal with Han Tianlei, the stationed cultivator had still harbored some concerns.

But now that the Han Clan's collusion with the Profound Nether Sect had been confirmed, even if Han Tianlei had influential backing within the sect, it wouldn't save the Han Clan's fate.

Moreover, even if Li Shiming couldn't handle Han Tianlei, the mere fact that the Han Clan had colluded with the Profound Nether Sect would be enough to strip Han Tianlei of his position as a law enforcement cultivator.

Without the authority of a law enforcement cultivator, Han Tianlei's personal threat was negligible to the stationed cultivator.

"My business here is done. I'll return to the sect immediately to deal with Han Tianlei," Li Shiming said solemnly, thinking the stationed cultivator was reminding him.

"Junior Brother, wait a moment. The Han Clan has some spoils of war. Though they're nothing special, they're still compensation for our efforts," the stationed cultivator said, gesturing for him to stay.

Before long, the imperial family delivered several large chests. Most of the contents were low-grade spiritual materials. The stationed cultivator politely let Li Shiming choose first.

In truth, neither the stationed cultivator nor Li Shiming thought much of these items. The spiritual materials possessed by rogue cultivators in the secular world—especially those in cities—were of predictably poor quality.

Higher-grade spiritual plants couldn't survive in mortal cities due to the heavy pollution. The millennium peony in the imperial palace was only able to thrive because of a special formation and the unique environment of the palace.

With a wave of his spiritual energy, Li Shiming extracted all the jade pieces imbued with spiritual energy from the chests.

"I'll take these. The rest are yours, Senior Brother," he said after selecting the jade, making no further moves.

"Then I won't stand on ceremony. With the Han Clan gone, my family will move here to take their place. I hope Junior Brother will look after them after I'm gone, for the sake of our sect ties," the stationed cultivator said, bowing to Li Shiming.

"If they encounter trouble and I happen to be free, I'll lend a hand," Li Shiming replied, softening at the memory of the stationed cultivator's performance in battle and his aged appearance.

Without lingering further, Li Shiming summoned his black wings and flew toward the city's outskirts.

The stationed cultivator remained bowed until Li Shiming's figure disappeared into the sky.

A cultivator's promise was a serious matter. Li Shiming's agreement represented a responsibility.

Though the stationed cultivator was at the late Qi Refining stage, his strength paled in comparison to Li Shiming's, who was only at the fourth level of Qi Refining.

Li Shiming's status as a formation master, his late-Qi Refining bronze corpse, the high-grade sword artifact, and the high-grade flight artifact he possessed—all these revealed his profound background.

Unable to express his gratitude further, the stationed cultivator could only offer his sincere thanks in this manner.

On his way back to the sect, Li Shiming practiced his sword flight. The Black Sparrow Wings consumed almost no spiritual energy, allowing him ample time to recover with spirit stones while continuously practicing his sword flight.

His increased speed significantly shortened his return journey.

Along the way, he also analyzed and studied the new techniques he had acquired, planning to start practicing them as soon as he returned.

After traveling over land and sea for several days, he finally re-entered the sect's territory.

His first thought was to order some spiritual materials. For cultivating the "Jade Heart Ice Mind Technique," it would be best to prepare calming incense. He also wanted to replenish his formation materials, so he decided to handle everything at once.

He took out his identity jade slip to contact Qiu Tan.

Strangely, there was no response from Qiu Tan. It was possible that Qiu Tan had left the sect's range.

But Li Shiming knew that even if Qiu Tan was away, any communication attempts would be redirected to his shop, where his assistants would handle them.

Qiu Tan was a shrewd businessman and wouldn't make such a mistake. He often emphasized providing the best service to customers and personally delivered goods to them.

A bad feeling crept over Li Shiming. Checking his map, he saw that he would pass by Changming Island soon and decided to stop there first.

Changming Island was hosting its day market, with few cultivators around.

As Li Shiming walked through the market, he sensed an air of tension.

Soon, he spotted Qiu Tan's spiritual plant shop—closed. It was around nine in the morning, prime business hours.

He approached the shop next door and discreetly handed two spirit stones to the attendant at the entrance.

"Did something happen to Qiu Tan's shop?" he asked quietly.

The attendant's face lit up at the spirit stones but darkened at the question. After glancing at the stones, he pulled Li Shiming aside.

"Boss Qiu has gone missing. Not just him—his two shop assistants also vanished ten days ago," the attendant whispered after ensuring no one was nearby.

Leaving Changming Island's market, Li Shiming's heart grew heavy.

He recalled the hundred catties of spirit rice in Baili Jinyan's storage bracelet—rice he had grown in his machine space. He had suspected that Baili Jinyan had targeted him because of something Qiu Tan had let slip.

Now, with Qiu Tan and his assistants missing, could it be related to Baili Jinyan?

The more he thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. On his way back to Eagle Beak Island, he remained vigilant, wary of sudden attacks.

Nothing happened during the journey, but when he reached Eagle Beak Island, he encountered trouble.

His identity jade slip couldn't activate the island's formation, barring his entry.

This shouldn't have happened. Even if a cultivator went missing, the sect would maintain their lease on the cave dwelling for years. A cave dwelling was a cultivator's private property—their home and safest place.

The very reason cultivators joined sects was for the resources and security they provided.

Since his jade slip didn't work, Li Shiming used it to check the status of the island.

To his shock, he discovered that Eagle Beak Island—originally his—had been transferred to Han Tianlei's name.

"No wonder the formation won't open," Li Shiming muttered, staring at the familiar island with rising fury.

Eagle Beak Island was crucial to him. The underground spiritual spring and low-grade spirit vein were his secrets, especially the spirit fish in the spring—key to his cultivation of the "Vajra Body Protection Divine Art."

Without the spirit fish, given his lack of connections in the sect, obtaining the resources needed for the divine art would be difficult.

He cast a cold glance at the island, wondering if the cultivator inside knew he had returned.

He was no longer a rootless newcomer. He was an intermediate spiritual farmer, a primary formation master, and two uncles owed him favors.

After some thought, he decided to visit the Formation Pavilion first to see which uncle was available.

The Formation Pavilion was the domain of formation masters, who held high status in the sect. Having an uncle from the pavilion intervene would be more effective.

Li Shiming turned and flew toward the Nine Peaks. Using his identity jade slip, he entered Competition Peak and approached the Formation Pavilion's entrance.

This time, there was no formation barrier. He entered and saw Uncle Zhuge, who had overseen his assessment.

"Greetings, Uncle Zhuge," Li Shiming said, bowing.

"It's you. Did you encounter problems with your formations? I haven't seen you take on any formation tasks," Uncle Zhuge said, recognizing him with a smile.

His words suggested he had been keeping an eye on Li Shiming.

"Uncle Zhuge, I've encountered injustice and have come to seek the Formation Pavilion's help," Li Shiming replied gravely, maintaining his bow.

"Who dares bully our formation masters in the sect? Tell me. If you're in the right, I'll stand up for you," Uncle Zhuge said, straightening and motioning for Li Shiming to rise.

"After reaching the fourth level of Qi Refining, I was assigned a mandatory mission to Southern Mountain Country by Han Tianlei of the Law Enforcement Hall. On the way, ten mid-Qi Refining cultivators from Han Tianlei's secular family ambushed me."

Uncle Zhuge interrupted him. "Do you have evidence of this ambush by the Han Clan's ten mid-Qi Refining cultivators?" he asked sternly.

The sect had many cultivators, especially at the Qi Refining stage, most of whom were left to their own devices beyond mandatory tasks. This led to frequent conflicts among Qi Refining cultivators.

Though such incidents were common, formation masters had always remained aloof. Now, the issue had reached one of their own.

"Elder Duyuan happened to pass by and can testify," Li Shiming said, bowing.

"Elder Duyuan? No wonder you survived an ambush by ten mid-stage cultivators," Uncle Zhuge said, recognizing the esteemed Buddhist monk, whose word was as good as a sect elder's.

"Later, in Southern Mountain Country, the stationed cultivator and I discovered the Han Clan's collusion with the Profound Nether Sect. The stationed cultivator must have reported it. After completing the mission, I returned to find my cave dwelling—Eagle Beak Island—no longer mine. It had been transferred to Han Tianlei," Li Shiming continued, omitting the fact that he had killed the ten Han Clan cultivators.

Uncle Zhuge silently checked his identity jade slip, confirming Li Shiming's claims.

"Come with me. We'll go to Eagle Beak Island first," Uncle Zhuge said, enveloping Li Shiming in spiritual energy.

Li Shiming felt the sect's grand formation resist momentarily before they were teleported over a hundred miles away from the Nine Peaks, close to Eagle Beak Island.

He was astonished—he hadn't known the grand formation could teleport cultivators such distances.

Without needing to fly, Uncle Zhuge carried him to Eagle Beak Island in moments, far surpassing his sword flight speed.

"Open!" Uncle Zhuge commanded, extending his hand toward the island's defensive formation.

The formation parted, allowing them entry.

Upon entering, Uncle Zhuge froze, and Li Shiming caught a whiff of decay.

A corpse in Heavenly Sea Sect robes lay at the cave dwelling's entrance. Uncle Zhuge examined it.

"Dead for at least nine days. Is this Han Tianlei?" he asked.

Li Shiming studied the decomposed body. Neither the clothing nor the features matched Han Tianlei.

"No, it's not him," he replied.

"The Law Enforcement Hall is in chaos—stealing cave dwellings and killing indiscriminately. Let's go. Today, we'll get you justice," Uncle Zhuge said, wrapping Li Shiming in spiritual energy again.

They left the corpse behind and vanished from Eagle Beak Island.

The death of a Qi Refining disciple wasn't significant in itself, but the fact that it happened on a sect island barely two hundred miles from the Nine Peaks was a slap to the sect's face.

Moreover, the disciple had died while Li Shiming—the original cave owner—was away on a mandatory mission, one that was essentially a death sentence.

With Li Shiming cleared of suspicion in the disciple's death, the Law Enforcement Hall's involvement became highly suspect.
