# Chapter 12: The Cave Heaven Treasure - Mountain-Sea Pearl! Continuous Gains!

"Brother Lin, I really can't accept this!" Han Li looked at the damaged magic treasure fragment and the Golden Bamboo Brush in his hands, utterly at a loss for words.

This Brother Lin had already helped him so much. Earlier outside, he had even stood up against that clan cultivator for Han Li's sake. Han Li didn't know how to express his gratitude—he never expected to encounter someone so genuinely warm-hearted in the cultivation world.

Now Lin Yun was giving him both the recovered magic treasure fragment and the specially purchased Golden Bamboo Brush. This... this was practically treating him like a blood brother!

"Brother Han, I feel like we've been friends for a lifetime at first sight," Lin Yun said with deep sincerity. "That magic treasure fragment was originally yours—how could I possibly take it from you?"

"As for the Golden Bamboo Brush, didn't we agree earlier that we'd go out to buy it together? Now that we've bought it, you're refusing it—what kind of reasoning is that?"

"This..." Han Li couldn't find words to refute Lin Yun's argument.

"Han Li, Han Li! What are you still hesitating about?"

"That magic treasure fragment was something Brother Lin worked hard to retrieve for you."

"And the Golden Bamboo Brush was something you agreed to beforehand—what's the meaning of refusing it now?"

After long consideration, Han Li finally nodded and accepted both items, promising Lin Yun: "Brother Lin, consider these two items as purchases on credit. I don't have enough spirit stones now, but I'll definitely repay you with spirit stones or items of equivalent value later."

Han Li resolved in his heart that when they eventually parted ways, he would compensate Lin Yun with extra pills or spirit herbs.

"Brother Lin, please forgive Han Li for being so cautious. It's just that the matter of the little green vial concerns my very life!"

After silently apologizing to Lin Yun in his heart, Han Li put the items away.

Lin Yun nodded. Whatever you say—just take the items first so I can claim my rewards.

"An Ancient Treasure Flower Basket and a Replica Eight Gates Golden Light Mirror—what excellent treasures!" Seeing the system notifications, Lin Yun was overjoyed.

The Flower Basket Ancient Treasure had the miraculous ability to confiscate treasures, while the Replica Eight Gates Golden Light Mirror could unleash terrifying Golden Light Divine Flames. Even Nascent Soul cultivators would covet these two treasures.

When Han Li first advanced to Nascent Soul stage, this Flower Basket Ancient Treasure became one of his combat methods, causing considerable trouble for the Mulan Grassland's spell warriors.

"I need to think of ways to get more things from Han Li." Lin Yun calmly stored the two items away and began considering how to continue benefiting from Han Li.

If he kept giving Han Li items, it would definitely make him suspicious. He needed to give things that would interest Han Li and make him feel he had to accept them.

Seeing Han Li still packing items into his bundle, Lin Yun had an idea. "Perfect opportunity!"

With a flip of his palm, a small brown pouch appeared in his hand, which he then offered to Han Li.

"Hmm? Brother Lin, what's this?" Han Li looked curiously at the small pouch Lin Yun handed him, not understanding his intention.

"Brother Han, this is called a storage pouch. I see you're still putting things in your bundle, so I assume you don't have one. I'm giving this to you too—it's not particularly valuable anyway."

"Storage pouch?" The name initially confused Han Li.

He took the pouch, examining its tiny opening, then looked at his comparatively enormous bundle, hesitating about how to fit everything inside.

Seeing Han Li's bewildered expression, Lin Yun chuckled. "Since it's your first time using a storage pouch, let me demonstrate!"

Lin Yun took out an identical storage pouch and explained while demonstrating: "Just point the opening at the item you want to store, channel some spiritual power into the pouch while focusing your mind on the item, and it will automatically be drawn inside!"

Under Han Li's watchful gaze, Lin Yun pointed the pouch downward, a white light flashing briefly in his hand.

A white glow shot from the pouch, enveloping the items on the ground. The objects rapidly shrank within the light before being sucked into the pouch.

The storage pouch's magic left Han Li both astonished and delighted.

"Retrieving items works the same way—just focus your spiritual power on the item you want to take out first." Lin Yun then demonstrated how to retrieve items.

"Cultivators are truly extraordinary! This storage pouch is amazing!" Han Li's first encounter with a storage pouch thrilled him. He immediately began practicing with his own pouch, storing and retrieving items repeatedly with great enthusiasm.

"This is something I need—I should accept it." Han Li made up his mind and clasped his hands toward Lin Yun. "Thank you, Brother Lin. Consider this another purchase on credit."

"Between brothers, why stand on ceremony? Talking about money hurts feelings." Lin Yun waved his hand dismissively.

[Ding! Congratulations to host for obtaining: Cave Heaven Treasure: Mountain-Sea Pearl.]

[Treasure description: Mountain-Sea Pearl, an extremely rare Cave Heaven Treasure inherited from the Sky Fish Clan of the Little Asura World. Obtained by Han Li from a cold pool during his cooperation with the Asura Spider Clan during his visit to the Little Asura World.]

"Ahahaha—" Seeing the system notification, Lin Yun felt every pore on his body open in delight!

So satisfying!

Don't let the battle stop now!

Lin Yun then tried offering Han Li some mid-grade and high-grade magical tools for protection, but no matter how earnestly he persuaded, Han Li firmly refused.

Lin Yun scratched his head. "This won't do—I'm being too impatient. I can't rush like this."

"I need to proceed step by step."

After some thought, Lin Yun realized he needed to offer things Han Li truly needed. He pulled out a book titled "Green Stream Records" from his storage pouch and handed it to Han Li.

"Brother Lin, accepting your storage pouch was already pushing my limits—I really can't take anything more from you," Han Li declined.

"Brother Han, you misunderstand." Lin Yun pressed the book into Han Li's hands. "This 'Green Stream Records' was written by a Yue Kingdom senior cultivator called Green Stream True Person who disliked cultivation and preferred traveling. He recorded all the secret stories and legends he encountered, with some pages even containing vivid illustrations."

"Some accounts in this book are Green Stream True Person's personal experiences, while others are hearsay, but all are rare and strange tales. Some even contain secrets never disclosed by cultivation families."

"Seeing how little you know about common cultivation knowledge, you should take this and study it carefully. It will greatly benefit you."

"This..." Han Li initially didn't want to accept it, but Lin Yun's gift addressed his exact needs. He truly needed this book, especially since he still hadn't figured out what the small token and flying sword talisman in his possession actually were.

Moreover, Lin Yun was right—his knowledge of the cultivation world was severely lacking. Lin Yun couldn't possibly explain everything to him, especially since he wouldn't know what Han Li did or didn't understand.

After careful consideration, Han Li finally accepted the "Green Stream Records," now more accustomed to the process. "Brother Lin, add this to my tab."

"What tab? Between brothers like us, talking about accounts hurts feelings!" Lin Yun laughed heartily, patting Han Li's shoulder.
