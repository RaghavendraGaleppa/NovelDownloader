# Chapter 92: Bandit Attack and Villager Training

Li Xian learned the news of the five leaders from Uncle Fu. He couldn't help but furrow his brows, contemplating his current situation.

The most troublesome one was undoubtedly the leader, Ma Daozi. This man had already entered the "Food Essence" stage, and Li Xian had heard that he recently began boiling essence food, causing his strength to rise to another level. If he were to attack, Black River Village would find it difficult to resist.

Although Li Xian had made progress recently, if he were to face him head-on, he feared that the outcome would be grim.

Next were the second, fifth, and fourth leaders... each one fierce and formidable.

"At the moment, the only option is to adapt to the situation. While martial warriors who have consumed essence are indeed extremely powerful, if we utilize the terrain and plan ahead... it is not impossible to kill them!"

Li Xian was not being arrogant. He had fought against the "Immortal in the Jar" and knew firsthand the terror of this realm of martial warrior. However, it was precisely because of this that he had some understanding and dared to make an estimate.

Even the formidable Immortal in the Jar was trapped in a formation, unable to move. In the end, he relied on the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" to frighten a guard and escape.

This shows that...

Even a martial warrior who has consumed essence is not omnipotent.

He had few retreats left. Whether human or ghost, god or Buddha, he would have to face them. Before that, what he could do was to practice martial arts diligently and devise plans!

Facing a great disaster, Li Xian remained calm.

For the sake of easier command of the villagers, he had moved from outside the west of the village into the village itself. Uncle Fu vacated a room for Li Xian to live in alone, serving as the "Command Tent."

It had its own small, fenced courtyard.

The sky was pitch black.

Inside the small courtyard.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Square Fist\]

\[Proficiency: 7819/10000 (Perfected)\]

Li Xian practiced his fist techniques while calming his mind. Now, Black River Village was united, and the morale of the troops was entirely with Li Xian. If he showed any sign of panic, it would surely collapse in an instant.

Conversely...

The calmer Li Xian was, the more united the villagers became.

"They haven't attacked yet?"

Li Xian's hearing was excellent. If there were hoofbeats, in the utter quiet of the night, he could hear them from several miles away.

"How strange."

"Normally, the Mountain Wind Stronghold should have already come to their door. Why haven't they found us yet?"

"Could it be..."

Li Xian wondered if he had accidentally succeeded. By carving the words "Black Water Gang" onto the arrows, had he truly diverted the disaster to another party?

"That must be it!"

"I caught a glimpse of the fourth leader, Niu Liang, once. He's the type with strong limbs but a simple mind."

"I heard from Peng Fox that Ma Daozi, Hong Kai, and the fifth leader, Lu Fengxue, are all at the 'Mountain Wind Pass' boiling essence food and are not in the stronghold. If that's the case, then the one in charge of the stronghold right now is that fourth leader, Niu Liang!"

Thinking of this, Li Xian was overjoyed and felt that this possibility was quite high.

He kept watch quietly through the night. The next morning, he went out to scout and indeed heard that the Mountain Wind Stronghold and the Black Water Gang had come to blows the previous night.

Coincidentally, the leaders of the Mountain Wind Stronghold and the Black Water Gang were both occupied with matters and could not get away. Ma Daozi had to guard the boiling of essence food, and Zheng Xuezhang was in seclusion to recover from his injuries.

These matters were neither too big nor too small, and they might not necessarily reach their ears.

But for Li Xian and Black River Village, this was a great thing, as it bought them more time.

The plan continued as scheduled.

Selling horses for money, purchasing iron nets and iron pots, teaching the farmers the anti-bandit formation, and uniting the people's hearts...

Li Xian spent a day personally arranging the details, ensuring everything was covered and progressing steadily.

There were some resistances along the way, but overall, things went smoothly. The affairs of Black River Village were put on the right track, and the "Farmers' Anti-Bandit Formation" was initially mastered.

Li Xian personally entered the formation to act as the enemy, training with the farmers.

Being entangled in fishing nets, his movements restricted, he also felt it was quite troublesome. He only managed to break free through quick adaptation and his understanding of the formation's flaws.

Another day passed.

More villagers learned the "Farmers' Anti-Bandit Formation," and the village now possessed a considerable fighting force. On top of that, the surrounding traps and lookout posts became increasingly hidden and perfected.

"That incident will be exposed sooner or later."

"Fortunately, Niu Liang is foolish, giving me time to prepare."

That evening.

The villagers gathered in the village, boiling pots to cook. Now, the village ate "communal meals," and the extra iron pots were used as iron shields.

The household choppers and sickles were tied to wooden sticks, making simple spears and long knives.

It could be said they were sharpening their blades.

Once the bloodthirst is stirred, it cannot be easily quelled without a real fight.

"Everyone, if the bandits come, let's make them taste our strength!" Li Xian said.

"Master Li, we will all listen to you! We are willing to be your vanguard, the first to charge!" the villagers shouted, holding bowls of hot porridge.

After eating and drinking their fill, it was already late. The villagers were still training diligently.

In the courtyard.

\[You consumed bear meat, the skill absorbed it, proficiency +8\]

Li Xian sat cross-legged on the ground. He had just finished a pot of bear bone soup, which turned into strands of heat flowing through his entire body.

His body hair rose and fell, his pores opened and closed. When the pores opened, a wave of heat radiated from his whole body; when they closed, the heat was all contained within.

"My 'Solid Blood, Closed Pores' technique is becoming more and more proficient!"

Li Xian focused his mind, allowing his Qi to flow throughout his body, controlling his solidified blood, and then extending from the solidified blood to the closed pores.

Although it was difficult to achieve the state where his blood solidified and his pores closed instantly with a mere thought, his progress was significant compared to just a few days ago.

"The amount of internal Qi determines a martial warrior's combat power."

Recalling the great battle with Peng Fox. Li Xian had two advantages: first, his internal Qi was slightly stronger; second, his martial arts quality was slightly higher.

When a martial artist executes a martial arts technique, they need to circulate the Qi and energy from their entire body to assist it. Only then can it possess formidable killing power. The greater the Qi circulation, the more powerful the martial arts technique.

The accumulation of Qi accompanies a martial warrior for their entire life.

"Commander Pang once told me that even he has not perfected any single martial art."

"Basic martial arts... are even harder to improve after reaching great completion."

"It's not that the martial talent is too poor, but that basic martial arts were originally created on a whim by some martial artist. The creator of the martial art may not have been proficient in it themselves."

"Although it has been improved and perfected by many later on... no one has ever wasted the energy to perfect a basic martial art."

Li Xian had the "Heaven's Reward for Diligence" and was limited by the number of martial arts he knew.

The fastest way to improve his strength was naturally to continuously delve deeper into his martial arts. Forcibly practicing a basic martial art to perfection, and even to its peak.

A powerful enemy was at the gates, and they could attack at any time.

After eating and drinking his fill and replenishing his energy, Li Xian immediately began to practice "Square Fist."

\[Your heart is like a mountain, Square Fist proficiency +4\]

\[Your fists are like stone, Square Fist proficiency +3\]

\[Proficiency: 8679/10000 (Perfected)\]

The lake of energy in his body rippled, and his strength improved bit by bit.

Li Xian very much wanted to see the scenery of "reaching the peak of perfection."

Just then...

He suddenly felt a slight vibration from the ground. He immediately pressed his ear to the ground and faintly heard the sound of hoofbeats.

At a lookout post at the east entrance of the village.

A sharp whistle sounded.

In an instant, the entire village was alerted, each person tense and terrified, yet also angry and excited.

They knew very well that the bandits from the Mountain Wind Stronghold had come down the mountain for revenge.

But this time, who would survive the encounter was not a certainty
