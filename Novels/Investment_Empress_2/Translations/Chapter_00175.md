# Chapter 175: Has It Begun? It Has Ended!

The massive Sword City lay between two mountain ranges.

The towering Sword Tower pierced the heavens like a colossal divine sword. At this moment, sunrise bathed the tower, casting its enormous shadow before the mountain gate.

The shadow covered ten arenas.

After the Sword City Elder finished speaking, a hush fell over the crowd.

“Which hero will be the first to set an example for us?”

“Where did all the great warriors go just now?”

...

To step onto the stage now meant having to hold the arena for three days. The difficulty was self-evident.

Only those with immense confidence in their own strength would dare to step up at this time.

“Allow me to try first.”

Suddenly, a voice came from the crowd.

Li Mo, who had just finished writing, looked toward the source.

He saw a man clad in beast-patterned armor with a resolute face. He held a long spear in his hand, surrounded by dozens of personal guards, exuding an imposing and solemn aura.

The Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark did not necessarily allow one to comprehend only sword techniques.

There were many swordsmen here because martial artists from Yunzhou and even the entire world revered sword cultivation.

“It is Young Master Zhong.”

“Young Master is mighty! He has the bearing of a general.”

The crowd flattered him endlessly.

Li Mo couldn't help but use his Destiny Divine Eye to look at him.

Hmm?

He raised an eyebrow slightly.

**[Name: Zhong Zhenyue]**
**[Age: 22]**
**[Physique: Iron Steed and Golden Halberd Body]**
**[Realm: Five Apertures of Divine Observation]**
**[Destiny: Blue with a hint of Purple]**
**[Evaluation: Son of the Prince of the South. Enlisted in the army since childhood. A straightforward man.]**
**[Recent Events: On his way to Yunzhou, he was deceived by Yin Mianmian, the Saintess of the Drizzle Pavilion. She didn't even need to use a mind-control technique, yet he is determined to marry her... He unintentionally helped the Drizzle Pavilion seize the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark and was severely punished by his father afterward.]**

Li Mo: “...”

A naive, straightforward rich kid encountering a top-tier siren?

This is going to be tricky.

The other party wasn't poisoned, wasn't charmed by some bizarre martial art, and isn't actually a member of the Drizzle Pavilion.

The Horizontal Cloud Sword City isn't like the Clear Abyss Sect; the higher-ups won't just believe whatever he says.

“Let’s take it one step at a time.”

Li Mo shook his head.

He currently had two things to do.

First, use the Sword Trial to refine the *Solitary Nine Swords* to a new level.

Second, help Bing Duo and Princess Jiang Chu observe the Horizontal Cloud Sword Mark.

The Drizzle Pavilion had designs on the Sword Mark, but he didn't seem to see any assassins from the Drizzle Pavilion through his Destiny Divine Eye.

However, as long as the Martial Arts Summit continued, they would eventually make a move.

“Bing Duo...”

Li Mo was about to speak, but he realized that Ying Bing had already stepped onto the stage.

Gasps of astonishment rippled through the crowd.

“Isn’t that the Overbearing Empress? Liu Wuyan?”

“It’s her! She looks exactly the same!”

“Bro, you read *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me* too?”

“The characters in that comic are based on reality, and they actually referenced reality?”

“Sob... I really want to be Sister Wuyan’s dog.”

“Empress Wuyan, invincible under the heavens!”

“I raise the banner for the Empress; who dares to be her enemy!”

...

The scene instantly became incredibly lively, making even more noise than when Zhong Zhenyue stepped up.

It was on the verge of turning into a fan meeting.

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

She didn't expect the comic to be so popular.

First of all, she wasn't called Liu Wuyan...

However, her frown only made the cheers louder.

Li Mo: “... So, Senior Brother Ouyang, you modeled Liu Wuyan after Ying Bing?”

“I had no choice. With a gemstone like her preceding me, you know how outrageously beautiful Junior Sister is. I racked my brain but couldn't come up with anyone who fits the Empress's aura better.”

Ouyang shrugged and added:

---

“By the way, Jiang Chen was modeled after you, Junior Brother Li. After all, art comes from life. You taught her well.”

Looking at the roaring crowd, Little Li never imagined that one day, his own boomerang would hit him in the head.

Nor did he expect to become a heartthrob...

“Wow, is that Jiang Chen?”

“He looks so gentle and handsome. He must be a gentleman, right?”

“Ah? So *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me* is based on the two of them?”

“Whimper, whimper, I really want to have little monkeys with Jiang Chen...”

...

Present weren't just martial heroes, but also onlookers, nobles, and commoners from all over Yunzhou.

The solemn atmosphere of the Sword Trial was completely gone.

On the high platform of Sword City.

“What is the External Affairs Hall doing?!”

Elder Zeng was furious. He slammed the table, sending the fruits flying into the air before they fell back down.

“Elder, there's nothing we can do either.”

“We hired about a hundred storytellers to take turns building hype for the three true disciples. The price of *Pang Dahai* (a type of throat lozenge) has been driven up by us.”

The steward of the External Affairs Hall said with a bitter face.

Even if the storytellers talked their throats raw, how could they compete with a comic book?

“You don't know this, but at the major bookstores, people are lining up every day. Someone even offered a hundred taels just to read the latest chapter of *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*.”

“Our methods for building hype are too outdated!”

“Outdated...”

Elder Zeng snorted and looked at Wu, Cao, and Bai standing there.

“It’s just petty tricks. In the end, it comes down to actual combat.”

“You three must show your spirit and style in the duel later!”

“Yes.”

The three cupped their fists in salute. Among them, Bai Jinghong sighed.

After they left the Sword City high platform, Elder Zeng narrowed his eyes at the steward:

“By the way, how do you know the bookstores are queuing?”

“Uh, well, I was just taking a stroll, and...”

“As a steward of Sword City, aren't you ashamed? Hand it over!”

“Ah? I haven't finished reading it yet...”

The steward reluctantly handed over the comic.

Elder Zeng took it and waited for the steward to leave before hurriedly flipping it open, as if he had found the antidote after being poisoned.

“Hehe, the latest chapter... hehehe...”

Elder Zeng is a good elder.

He keeps his private life and work strictly separate.

...

On the stage.

The ten arenas were finally filled.

The rules of the Sword Trial were very simple.

Each person could only step onto the stage twice. If their cultivation exceeded the opponent's by a major realm, they had to suppress their cultivation to the same level. After all, this is a friendly exchange of martial arts, not a competition of who has a higher realm.

Among the ten people currently on stage, nine were at the Divine Observation realm.

Only Princess Jiang Chu was at the Internal Breath realm.

Naturally, many who wanted to step up to make a name for themselves set their sights on her.

“Whose child is that?”

“She looks like a little beggar. I saw her feeding stray cats outside last night.”

“Hey, kid, get down quickly. You’re going to get scared to tears in a moment.”

A swordsmen at the Golden Core Realm jumped onto the stage.

This was a challenge.

Jiang Chu hugged her jade sword with the peach blossom branch, standing there timidly, looking somewhat lost and helpless.

She could only bite her lip and look at the adjacent arena.

She saw Li Mo smiling gently, giving her a thumbs-up under his robe.

Jiang Chu instantly gained confidence and asked softly:

“Has it started?”

“Yeah, it has started.”

*Swish—*

It was unclear when the peach blossom branch began its movement, nor when it ended.

But the resolve to never look back, the intent to leave—unstoppable.

It was like a spring breeze.

It had ended.
