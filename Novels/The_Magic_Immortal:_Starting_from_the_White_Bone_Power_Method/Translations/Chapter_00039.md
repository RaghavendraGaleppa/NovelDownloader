# Chapter 39: Does He Like Widows?

The Black River Market bustled with cultivators of all kinds, yet compared to its usual liveliness, there was now an undercurrent of violence and restlessness. Tensions between the southern migrants and local cultivators seemed to be escalating.

By rights, Ning Jingming should have been waiting for him in the courtyard. But today, he'd have to wait a little longer. This wasn't their first collaboration—letting him count ants for a while longer shouldn't be an issue. Besides, Wang Chan had run out of Purification Talismans, and it was always wise to keep some handy. One never knew when killing might be necessary.

Wang Chan headed straight for the shop district, boldly purchasing five Purification Talismans and ten portions of Spirit Nourishing Elixir from the mustached shopkeeper. Unlike before, with his growing reputation as a physician and his increased hidden strength, buying more items no longer posed any trouble.

The mustached shopkeeper's store, a reliable establishment, never ran out of stock despite rising prices and shortages elsewhere. He even gave Wang Chan a good deal—five Purification Talismans that would cost a hundred spirit coins elsewhere, and Spirit Nourishing Elixir that usually went for twenty, all for just a hundred and thirteen coins. He even threw in a box of Eight Treasures Spirit Frost Cake as a bonus.

Their rapport was good, so Wang Chan discreetly slipped a jade pouch containing twenty spirit coins into the shopkeeper's sleeve. "I heard you recently took in a new concubine, Brother Hu. Consider this a belated gift—hope you don't mind."

Feeling the weight of the pouch, the mustached man warmly insisted Wang Chan stay for a drink. Wang Chan excused himself, promising next time, but before leaving, he sent a covert message asking Hu to look into information about He Changkong of the Black Eagle Gang.

This Hu was a character who flirted with other men's wives and partners yet remained unscathed—Wang Chan knew he had powerful backing. From a casual chat with Ning Jingming, he'd learned that Shopkeeper Hu was actually an outer disciple of the Cloud Mist Sect, and the Hundred Herb Garden was owned by one of the sect's inner disciples. Hu wasn't just here to run a shop.

Hu didn't refuse, only asking gravely, "Do you have a grudge with He Changkong?"

"A minor misunderstanding. Just seeing if there's a chance to clear it up," Wang Chan replied.

Hu nodded, giving him a reassuring look.

Leaving the Hundred Herb Garden, Wang Chan wound through several alleys until he reached an old lane lined with willow trees, their tender green shoots swaying gracefully.

Though still part of the shop district, beyond this lane lay less savory establishments—places Wang Chan never visited, not even with a glance.

At the end stood a courtyard named "Longing House," specializing in low-grade talismans and related materials. From the outside, it looked deserted, as if business was poor.

Pushing the door open, Wang Chan stepped inside with practiced ease. The interior was well-tended with vibrant flowers, though they had a somewhat garish allure.

"The magpies were chattering away this morning—I wondered what good fortune was coming. So it's your esteemed presence, Daoist Wang!" A mature and alluring Madam Cheng greeted him, dressed in an elegant emerald gown that accentuated her voluptuous figure.

Wang Chan didn't spare her a second glance. Seeing her so eager, he even considered finding an opportunity to pay her with a certain intimate object instead of coins.

"Please, sit! I've just learned a new tea-brewing technique—'Delicate Hands Blending Fragrance.' You must try it," Madam Cheng insisted, pulling him toward a seat as she prepared the tea set.

"No need. The usual will do," Wang Chan quickly declined. Though he was now a demonic cultivator, he wasn't reckless enough to drink her tea—who knew what mysterious elixirs she might have slipped in?

"So cold, Daoist Wang," Madam Cheng pouted playfully. But seeing his businesslike demeanor, she sighed in mock frustration. "With all the chaos outside, mid-grade Stealth Talismans and Purification Talismans are in high demand. We only have three of each left in stock."

After experiencing the usefulness of these talismans, Wang Chan had sought out Madam Cheng to inquire about purchasing mid-grade versions. These were items one might not always need but couldn't afford to be without. The Black River Market had scarce supplies of mid-grade talismans, and these two types were particularly niche—most orthodox cultivators had no use for them.

Unexpectedly, Madam Cheng herself was a low-grade talisman master skilled in crafting Stealth and Purification Talismans. Longing House secretly sold mid-grade versions, along with a few other types—but only to those with connections.

Given their "close relationship," Madam Cheng offered him a generous discount. Mid-grade Stealth and Purification Talismans, each with fifteen layers of enchantments and totaling eighty-one sheets, cost only a hundred and forty spirit coins combined.

When Wang Chan hesitated, seemingly unable to afford them, she even offered credit.

Wang Chan suspected she had ulterior motives—after their previous encounters, though he hadn't lost out, she had certainly gained advantages. Still, he took the talismans. Having them on hand provided peace of mind. After all, despite being a demonic cultivator, Madam Cheng was bound by Daoist oaths and wouldn't dare harm him.

"I'll take them all," Wang Chan declared.

"Daoist Wang, this is a small business. No credit this time," Madam Cheng said coyly, feigning annoyance at his indifference.

"No matter. I'll settle last time's debt as well." Wang Chan produced a jade pouch containing five hundred and sixty spirit coins and placed it on the table.

"How decisive!" Madam Cheng's eyes sparkled at the sight of such wealth. She swayed over and handed him three jade boxes. "I'll throw in two extra low-grade Stealth and Purification Talismans as well."

"Thanks." Wang Chan accepted them without ceremony. Aside from her flirtatiousness, Madam Cheng was thorough in her dealings.

After verifying the contents, he stored the boxes in his pouch. Glancing around to ensure they were alone, he sent a covert message: "I have some items to dispose of discreetly. Given your wide connections, Madam Cheng, do you have a solution?"

Compared to Ning Jingming and others, such shady matters could be discussed with Madam Cheng without reservation. As an experienced demonic cultivator, she surely had channels.

"The black market?" Madam Cheng replied via message.

Wang Chan nodded solemnly. He'd heard of the black market but had never had the chance to visit. Such places operated in secrecy, unknown to most.

Seeing his seriousness, Madam Cheng dropped her playful act. "On the eighth day of the third month, the local black market opens. Come to Longing House at this same hour, and I'll take you."

"Farewell." Having obtained the information he needed, Wang Chan prepared to leave.

"Let me see you out." Madam Cheng clung to his arm, pressing close as she escorted him to the door. Her grip was surprisingly strong, her body pressing against him so tightly it almost hurt.

"Do visit often, Daoist Wang. My door is always open," she called after him, covering her mouth in amusement as he hurried away.

Just then, from another alley, Beauty Mole and two female guards in patrol uniforms appeared—whether on duty or leisure, it wasn't clear. They were chatting amiably when Beauty Mole spotted Wang Chan extracting himself from Madam Cheng's embrace and slinking off.

Taking in Madam Cheng's wanton demeanor, Beauty Mole's smile faded. "Who is that woman?" she asked the almond-eyed guard beside her.

"The new proprietress of Longing House," the guard replied after a moment's thought.

At the mention of "Longing House," Beauty Mole's brow furrowed slightly.

The almond-eyed guard added, "She goes by Madam Cheng. Quite capable—and a widow."

"A widow?" Beauty Mole's expression remained neutral, but her eyes betrayed strange emotions. Despite her repeated attempts to seduce Wang Chan, he'd shown no interest in laying a finger on her. Yet today, she'd seen him buried elbow-deep in Madam Cheng's embrace without a hint of shame.

"Could it be... he likes widows?!" The absurd thought flashed through Beauty Mole's mind, making her blink in surprise. Lowering her head, she walked past Longing House with her companions, lost in thought.
