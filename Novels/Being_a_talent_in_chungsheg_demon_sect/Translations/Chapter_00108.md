# Chapter 108: Promotion to True Disciple

In the center of Skeleton Mountain, Lu Yang sat in silent meditation, regulating his breath, holding the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, surrounded by a myriad of ghosts. His aura, that of a perfected Qi Refinement cultivator, was not concealed in the slightest.

Immediately after, a brilliant light shone into the [Yama Demon Hall].

The light coalesced into a human form, and Daoist Yinshan stepped out, his face filled with surprise. His gaze fixed intently on Lu Yang, while secretly calculating karmic connections.

However, he was stunned.

Because this time, Lu Yang had not deliberately concealed his own karma; instead, he had actively revealed most of it, which greatly shocked True Person Yinshan.

"You are... Lu Yang?"

According to his calculations, Lu Yang had only joined the sect a little over a decade ago, yet his cultivation had already reached the perfected Qi Refinement realm. If that was still comprehensible, then achieving a Great Divine Ability at such a young age was simply fantastical, definitely not something an ordinary grassroots disciple could accomplish!

After a moment of silence, True Person Yinshan reached the exact same conclusion as in his previous life:

"May I ask, fellow Daoist, which True Person of our Sacred Sect have you reincarnated from?"

Lu Yang: "..."

Before Lu Yang could respond, Patriarch Tingyou emerged behind him, scoffing, "What Sacred Sect True Person? This is a successor of my Witch Ghost Dao!"

"Witch Ghost Dao?"

True Person Yinshan was startled again upon hearing this. He looked at Patriarch Tingyou, calculated for a moment, and then his face showed surprise: "Tingyou? The last Sect Master of the Witch Ghost Dao?"

"The sixth generation, not the last!" Patriarch Tingyou spoke again, clearly displeased with the term 'last'. He said coldly, "My Witch Ghost Dao has continued for a thousand years without a break in its lineage. Lu Yang is my Witch Ghost successor, merely taking temporary refuge under the Chu Sheng Sect!"

"Oh?"

True Person Yinshan was taken aback, then understanding dawned in his eyes. If that were the case, then Lu Yang's rapid progress was understandable.

Joining as a master of existing arts, it made perfect sense.

Thinking of this, True Person Yinshan glanced at the Guardian Spirit Su Nü behind Lu Yang. That was the real reason he hadn't made a move the moment he appeared.

'An external incarnation, with Foundation Establishment cultivation?'

True Person Yinshan realized something, treating Su Nü as the hidden foundation of the Witch Ghost Dao. In this way, it was no longer strange for Lu Yang to have achieved a Great Divine Ability at such a young age.

After all, the difficulty of cultivating a Great Divine Ability was only limited to the Qi Refinement realm; for a Foundation Establishment True Person, it wasn't as hard. It was quite normal for Lu Yang to have cultivated it at a young age. The only doubt was the origin of this Great Divine Ability, but when True Person Yinshan calculated to the end, he traced it back to himself.

"You're one of my Three Rivers Association's people?"

Facing the changing expression of True Person Yinshan, Lu Yang remained calm and composed.

Among all his Great Divine Abilities, only one could have its karma traced back: the "Twelve Capitals Demon-Slaying Secret Demon Tribulation Light," which he had learned in this life.

And this Great Divine Ability was a benefit of joining the Three Rivers Association.

So no matter how it was calculated, his origins were impeccable. Moreover, he had signed the Three Rivers Association's contract, making him, strictly speaking, one of True Person Yinshan's own people.

As for other Great Divine Abilities with unclear origins, once he was promoted to a true disciple and gained status, revealing them would no longer arouse suspicion.

For this, he had to be promoted to true disciple as quickly as possible!

Generally, to become a true disciple of the Sacred Sect, one must have a Foundation Establishment True Person backing them, signifying that they have earned the sect's trust.

When you're out and about, it's about power and background.

Without a background, you're just a nobody, destined to be used as fodder.

Therefore, Lu Yang had to demonstrate his value to gain a sufficiently strong backer for himself, and the "Witch Ghost Dao successor" was an excellent tiger skin to wear.

"Indeed, Senior," Lu Yang replied.

Lu Yang respectfully bowed and said, "Senior Sister Feixia personally invited me to join. I apologize for concealing this before; please do not blame me, Senior."

"So that's how it is..."

True Person Yinshan looked at Lu Yang with a peculiar gaze: "You could have continued to hide it. Why did you actively expose yourself? Do you intend to re-establish the Witch Ghost Dao?"

He didn't doubt Lu Yang's identity. After all, Patriarch Tingyou's karmic ties were clear – the last Sect Master of the Witch Ghost Dao. Even he had actively acknowledged Lu Yang's status as a "Witch Ghost Dao successor." How could it be fake? It's not as if Lu Yang, a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, could deceive Patriarch Tingyou, could he?

"Senior, you misunderstand."

Lu Yang shook his head decisively: "I am a disciple of the Sacred Sect. Although I have received the Witch Ghost Dao's legacy, my heart is with the Sacred Sect. I have absolutely no intention of establishing another sect."

"In fact, I wish to offer the Witch Ghost Dao's lineage to the Sacred Sect."

"...Oh?"

Upon hearing this, True Person Yinshan looked at Patriarch Tingyou, and seeing no reaction from him, he grew even more surprised. Little did he know, Lu Yang had already discussed this with him.

A thousand years had passed; Patriarch Tingyou had long since accepted reality.

The focus was on the sect's continuation and the existence of its legacy. As long as the legacy remained, taking refuge under a larger sect and paying some price was a reasonable matter.

"Interesting..."

True Person Yinshan now understood. He looked at Lu Yang with a half-smile: "You intend to use the Witch Ghost Dao's legacy as your stepping stone for promotion?"

"Is that not permissible?" Lu Yang retorted.

"Hahaha! Permissible, of course it is!"

The next second, True Person Yinshan burst into laughter, all previous doubts gone. His gaze towards Lu Yang was filled with appreciation: "Truly worthy of being a disciple of my Sacred Sect!"

Under the Sacred Sect's rule, they didn't look at merit, reincarnation, or origin; they only looked at your value!

If your value was high enough, never mind being a successor of the Witch Ghost Dao; even if you were a successor of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, they would still accept you. The Sacred Sect never cared about such things!

Thinking of this, True Person Yinshan had already understood Lu Yang's request: "You desire the position of a true disciple?"

Lu Yang cupped his hands: "Your insight is keen, True Person."

"I agree to this matter."

True Person Yinshan smiled: "You offering the Witch Ghost Dao's legacy to the Sacred Sect is a great merit. I can recommend you upwards and secure you a true disciple spot."

At this moment, True Person Yinshan's gaze towards Lu Yang had changed. If before he had looked at him as a stranger, now, after learning that Lu Yang had joined the Three Rivers Association and signed a magical contract, he regarded Lu Yang as his own junior, believing him to be a talent worth cultivating extensively.

'Just in time. Senior Brother Chongguang and I have set a time to go to that place in eighty years.'

Although True Person Yinshan favored Luo Wuya, breaking through to Foundation Establishment was a near-fatal endeavor, and no one knew the outcome. Thus, he also wanted to find some backup candidates.

Moreover, strictly speaking, Lu Yang clearly had more hope than Luo Wuya.

"Many thanks, Senior!"

Seeing this, Lu Yang also smiled, cupped his hands in thanks, and at the same time, let out a sigh of relief in his heart. With this, he would have some standing in the Sacred Sect.

Of course, this status was currently like a castle in the air.

After all, his true disciple position was effectively an "airdrop," nominal and without substance. To truly gain the Sacred Sect's trust, he would inevitably have to go through a long period of assessment.

'But it doesn't matter.'

'After all, the one thing I'm least short of is time!'

***

Sacred Sect, at the center of the Cloud Sea Connecting Heaven.

This place was named "Sacred Fire Cliff," the secluded cultivation site for the Sect Master and various True Monarchs. The only True Person currently permitted to enter this place was the current acting Sect Master.

True Person Chongguang.

At this moment, this valiant and ambitious True Person stood solemnly before a quiet chamber, silently calculating the time in his heart.

'Almost time...'

After an unknown period, True Person Chongguang finally raised his head. Almost simultaneously, the quiet chamber before him emitted a soft sound, and a graceful figure pushed open the door and stepped out.

"Greetings, True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue!"

True Person Chongguang immediately bowed deeply without a word, until a gentle voice sounded: "Rise, there's no need for such ceremony. Chongguang, how has your recent cultivation been?"

"Slight progress."

True Person Chongguang remained bowed and solemnly said, "A few days ago, I successfully cultivated the last [Adamant Flame Furnace]. My Dao path is complete, lacking only the ascent to Heaven and assumption of my position."

"The [Adamant Flame Furnace] has been cultivated?"

True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue's face immediately lit up with joy upon hearing this: "This Earthly Fiend position belongs to [Great Desolation]. With this, your Dao path now has [Yue Feng], [Zhi Xu], [Zhan Meng], and [Great Desolation] complete—the four elixirs are perfected. It seems the position of [Lamp-Covering Fire] is now within your grasp."

"When do you plan to ascend?"

"It will still take some time." True Person Chongguang shook his head: "Hongyun is not dead, and he still has True Monarchs supporting him. A rash ascension might not succeed."

"Therefore, I intend to go to 'that realm'."

"Oh?" True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue paused upon hearing this, then nodded: "With your cultivation, although you can barely go, you will still need a few assistants."

"I already have candidates," True Person Chongguang nodded.

True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue did not ask further upon hearing this, nodding: "I've always trusted your judgment in matters. However, my emergence from seclusion this time is for the War of Dao Seizing."

"War of Dao Seizing? So soon?" True Person Chongguang was taken aback.

True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue shook her head: "The Great Calamity of a Thousand Years is approaching, and the Heavenly Stars are in disarray. This is to be expected. Go and inform the Sacred Sect, and gather the true disciples."

"...Yes!"

True Person Chongguang nodded, but a hint of worry appeared on his face.

If it had been a decade or so ago, he wouldn't have worried, because at that time True Person Yinshan had not yet broken through to Foundation Establishment, and could suppress the Qi Refinement disciples of all four Daoist traditions.

However, now, True Person Yinshan had already established his foundation.

Although there were some astonishing talents among the true disciples besides True Person Yinshan, most of them needed to be stationed across the Jiangbei region and could not move lightly.

Among the true disciples who could be mobilized, there was a lack of a sufficiently astonishing individual, one whose power could stabilize the situation.

Presumably, the other Daoist traditions also saw this point, which is why they initiated another War of Dao Seizing so quickly, intending to suppress the Sacred Sect's might.

"It seems this time, the Sacred Sect might have to suffer a bit of a loss..."

Thinking of this, True Person Chongguang couldn't help but sigh.
