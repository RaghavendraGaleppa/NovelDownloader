# Chapter 29: The Way to Make Money

Han Zhen calculated his available spirit stones. Even counting the equivalent value of the Vajra Talisman he possessed, he had less than thirty in total. In this situation, money-making ventures with high upfront costs were out of the question. The only feasible option he could easily start with was drawing spirit talismans.

He then reviewed the spells he had mastered: "Fireball Spell," "Wind Manipulation Art," "Object Control Spell," "Heavenly Eye Spell," "Spirit Quieting Spell," "Vajra Spell," as well as several auxiliary spells he had extracted from Golden Light Immortal.

Low-level cultivators typically employed spells in combat through three methods: direct spell casting, talisman arts, and spirit talismans. First were the most basic Five Element Spells. These consumed one's own magical power and required incantations. Those who cultivated them to mastery could even cast them instantly. Five Element Spells differ from Five Element cultivation methods. Unlike cultivation methods which generally require specific spiritual roots to learn, spells like the Fireball Spell can be learned by anyone in the cultivation world, perfectly illustrating this point. However, spells that matched the attribute of one's main cultivation method would be more powerful when cast.

However, few low-level cultivators invested significant energy into mastering spells. Their lifespans were limited during the Qi Condensation stage, so most of their time was dedicated to refining their magical power and improving their cultivation. Thus, talisman arts and spirit talismans became the optimal choice for most cultivators to cast spells. Ordinary spirit talismans sealed spells within a talisman paper. These talismans, activated by magical power for convenient use, were single-use consumables. Talisman arts, on the other hand, were spells that required the use of a pre-drawn talisman to be effective. When casting a talisman art, only a small amount of spiritual energy combined with a simple incantation was needed. The advantage was that they could be interrupted at any time and used repeatedly until the spiritual energy within the talisman was depleted. Clearly, talisman arts were more popular among low-level cultivators.

The Spirit Quieting Spell and Vajra Spell that Han Zhen had learned were spells that required the use of Spirit Quieting Talismans and Vajra Talismans, respectively. Both the Spirit Quieting Spell and the Vajra Spell included methods for talisman crafting. A Spirit Quieting Talisman was worth two spirit stones, and a Vajra Talisman was worth nine. Han Zhen had previously noted the prices of various talismans from stalls when he passed through the market square. Han Zhen made up his mind to start with these two types of talismans. He would first master drawing low-tier Spirit Quieting Talismans to earn some money, and then begin to comprehend and practice drawing mid-tier Vajra Talismans.

Emerging from the pavilion, Han Zhen arrived at the market square within Tai Nan Valley. Like other cultivators, he slowly strolled around, searching for stalls selling talisman crafting materials and brushes. Although Han Zhen coveted the exotic Golden Bamboo Brush in Han Yunzhi's possession, he knew it was impossible to acquire without seventy or eighty spirit stones. Among cultivators, besides bartering, transactions were predominantly conducted using spirit stones.

Because with the increasing scarcity and over-extraction of spirit stone mines in the cultivation world, the value of spirit stones had been steadily rising. Thinking of this, Han Zhen recalled the nameless isolated island in the northernmost part of Silver Sand Island in the Outer Seas of the Scattered Stars. Not only did it possess ownerless high-grade spirit stone veins, but it also contained top-grade spirit stones, rarely seen in the Human Realm. After its discovery, the nameless isolated island was later named Azure Spirit Island, because the top-grade spirit stone found there was of the wood attribute. Although Han Zhen had long since mentally reserved this top-grade spirit stone for himself, he would need to reach at least the Core Formation stage before he could scheme for it. This was because even a Core Formation cultivator flying non-stop from Silver Sand Island would require several months to reach the island using their flight shield. It was almost the outermost edge that ordinary cultivators could reach, which was also why the spirit stone mines on the island had remained undiscovered. Furthermore, the island was unusually large, with many demonic beasts originally residing on it, and the mineral veins were distributed in various hidden locations beneath the island, making them difficult to discover. Currently, Han Zhen could only dream about it.

Han Zhen scrutinized each stall. Books on spell incantations and talisman arts started at several tens of spirit stones, and although he yearned for them, he could only consider them once he had earned enough spirit stones in the future. After comparing prices, Han Zhen purchased a talisman brush crafted from a first-tier spirit fox's tail, along with five dozen blank talisman papers and the cinnabar needed for drawing talismans, from one stall for eighteen spirit stones and a tattered Vajra Talisman. Seeing that Han Zhen bought the full set at once, the stall owner generously discounted one spirit stone. Now, he had only one spirit stone left on him. If his plan to draw talismans failed, he might have no choice but to use the pills Han Li had given him.

Han Zhen walked back, occasionally glancing at the stalls on both sides. He even saw a stall selling high-tier defensive spirit talismans priced at sixty spirit stones. Many passing cultivators eyed them enviously, but none could afford the price. Han Zhen, however, saw a golden opportunity to make a fortune. Suddenly, Han Zhen stopped in front of a stall. On the stall were some low-tier talismans and several inconspicuous small gray cloth bags. The stall owner was looking down, but Han Zhen recognized her at a glance: it was the young girl Han Yunzhi, whom he had parted ways with a few days ago. Her burly elder brother, Han Yunfeng, was not with her at the moment. The young girl appeared noticeably more reserved compared to the other stall owners.

Han Zhen crouched down and picked up a small gray cloth bag. "Miss, what's inside this?" Han Yunzhi looked up at Han Zhen, who was clad in white robes and possessed an extraordinary aura. Her face flushed slightly as she softly replied, "These are Seven-Star Grasses over ten years old, the best raw material for making talisman paper." Han Yunzhi simply explained, treating Han Zhen as an ordinary customer.

"But after only a few days apart, Miss Han, you don't recognize me?" Han Zhen said with a bright smile, completely unaware of the impact this had on the young girl who was just beginning to experience infatuation.

"You are...?" Han Yunzhi froze for a moment. Upon recognizing Han Zhen, her face flushed even deeper, and she dared not meet his gaze.

"Brother Han, you... you weren't like this before," Han Yunzhi finally realized, remembering Han Zhen, and spoke with a flustered expression, a sight that made one feel pity for her.

"Being alone while out and about, I had no choice but to resort to this measure. I hope Miss Han can forgive me," Han Zhen explained, amused by Han Yunzhi's reaction. "Where's Brother Han? I don't see him."

"That's also thanks to that spiritual herb, Brother Han. My brother's cultivation recently reached a bottleneck, and he's preparing to break through," Han Yunzhi replied, her attitude becoming more familiar after she composed herself.

However, Han Zhen had no intention of lingering. Teasing the young girl was merely a momentary whim for amusement. After chatting casually with the young girl for a few moments, Han Zhen suddenly said, "Well then, I won't disturb Miss Han's business anymore. When Brother Han emerges from his seclusion, perhaps we can have tea together." He then informed her of the location of his pavilion, and promptly stood up, preparing to leave.

"Alright, Brother Han, see you again!" The young girl had wanted to say something else but ultimately smiled sweetly and bid him farewell. However, her beautiful eyes watched Han Zhen's retreating back, her heart unable to calm down for a long time. Han Zhen, however, was unaware that he had inadvertently set fire to the young girl's heart. After all, the contrast between his previous disguise as a hunter and his current appearance had a far greater impact on the young girl's heart than suddenly meeting an unfamiliar handsome young man.

Returning to the pavilion, Han Zhen hung up the "In Seclusion" sign and then prepared all the necessary talisman crafting tools in his cultivation chamber. "Everything is ready," he murmured. "Heaven Rewards Diligence—let me see your limits!" Han Zhen picked up the fox-tail brush he had named, dipped its tip in a bit of cinnabar, and drew the first stroke of a talisman on a blank talisman paper.
