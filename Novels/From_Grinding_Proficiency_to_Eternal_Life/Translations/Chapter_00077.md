# Chapter 77: Bone Forging Great Completion

Evening found Xu Yunfan seated cross-legged on the well platform in the center of the courtyard.

The setting sun's afterglow bathed him, stretching his shadow long across the ground.

He closed his eyes and focused his mind. The blood energy within him surged like a river, climbing up his spine segment by segment.

His spine trembled slightly, emitting faint "clicking" sounds, as if countless tiny hammers were striking his bones.

*'You have grasped the subtle connection between bone forging and breathing. When you adjust your breath, allowing each inhalation and exhalation to drive the vibration of your bones, and let blood energy cycle through them, both the strength and resilience of your bones are tempered. Your proficiency in Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Forging Chapter has significantly increased.'*

*'...'* 

Deep into the night, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, his expression extremely fatigued. He formed the Lin Seal with his hands before his chest and silently recited the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water.

An hour later, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, looking at the proficiency increase notifications that had been flooding his vision all day.

Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Forging Chapter, Swift Shadow Leg, Red Copper Body Cloak Hammer Technique, and the Lin Seal all had proficiency prompts, though Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Forging Chapter had the most, with the Lin Seal having only a few scattered entries.

"Marvelous!"

This immersive feeling of gaining proficiency through cultivation was intoxicating. If not for the fact that Pure Yang One Qi Art could only reach the Outer Three Unions Grand Master level at its peak, he wouldn't be so eager to join a sect.

Once one reaches the Outer Three Unions realm and becomes a Grand Master...

Well, you might as well stop四处拜师 everywhere and just find a place to establish your own sect instead.

Which sect would accept an Outer Three Unions Grand Master? Among the dozen or so sects in Qingzhou, there are a few lower-tier ones whose sect masters are merely Outer Three Unions Grand Masters. The master of the Shocking Waves Sect, Fei Qi, is also only at the Outer Three Unions Grand Master realm.

If you joined them, who would be the sect master—you or him?

For the next few days, Xu Yunfan basically stayed indoors, temporarily putting aside other martial arts cultivation to focus entirely on Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Forging Chapter. His proficiency increased by over a dozen points each day.

With the improvement in his cultivation realm and the completion of muscle and skin training, the effects on bone forging became increasingly pronounced.

Completing bone forging in a month was more than enough.

Until half a month later, after finishing his training, Xu Yunfan, who rarely went out, had just left the Long Wind Tavern after a hearty meal when he came face to face with a filthy, foul-smelling, thin beggar walking aimlessly with vacant eyes. Passersby couldn't help but cover their mouths and avoid him.

After a glance, he was about to walk past when Xu Yunfan's expression shifted. He turned to look at the beggar's retreating figure.

"Brother Su?"

The beggar trembled at Xu Yunfan's voice and turned around mechanically. Looking at the burly, tall man with a long-handled瓮金锤 (urn-gold hammer) and an iron box on his back, the beggar's gaze moved upward. Upon recognizing the face that called out his name, his lips quivered, and he burst into loud sobs.

"Brother Xu!!!"

It was actually Su Shiyu, the tomboy from the Su family of Beiye City.

When Xu Yunfan brought Su Shiyu back to the courtyard, he boiled a bucket of water for her to wash up and change into his spare clothes. He then looked at the delicate, handsome-faced Su Shiyu, who was half-hidden behind the door, looking at him timidly.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat helpless. "Brother Su, why are you looking at me like that?"

Su Shiyu was surprised. "You're not surprised that I'm a woman?"

"..." "In Beiye City, who doesn't know you are the Su family's eldest young miss, Su Shiyu."

Hearing this, Su Shiyu's expression was both helpless and dejected. She had thought her disguise was perfect, never expecting to be seen through at a glance.

Seeing Su Shiyu remain silent, Xu Yunfan asked, "Why were you in such a state just now?"

Although the Su family wasn't fabulously wealthy, they had a reputation for being well-off, backed by the Jiyun Mountain in Beiye City.

Su Shiyu's face darkened as she recounted the whole story.

It turned out that ever since the divine weapon, the Golden Tassel Cane, appeared at the Thousand Buddha Temple, almost all the experts in Yanbei Dao had been heading there. Even the Great Zhou Imperial Court specially dispatched a team of four hundred Tiger Guards, led by a Blood Transformation general.

Beiye City had become a place of turmoil, packed with experts. Disputes among various factions had stirred up the entire city. Although the Thousand Buddha Temple had an immense reputation, its highest strength was only at the Blood Transformation realm. How could it withstand such a flood of experts?

The various families in the city had already been forcibly "staying" by different experts. The Su family suffered the worst fate—a demonic Blood Transformation expert moved into their residence. One day, when the vegetables served didn't suit his taste, he made up a false charge and killed people recklessly. She was smuggled out of the city by her father amidst the chaos. Now, she was the only one left, and she had no idea how the Su family was faring.

The Great Zhou Imperial Court turned a blind eye. The government office acted like quails. Even the Black Armor Tiger Guards, upon hearing the news from the city, didn't move an inch, saying it was outside their military jurisdiction.

Such conduct was appalling.

Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly, making a mental judgment. He turned to look at Su Shiyu, whose eyes were red from crying and filled with hatred. After a moment of thought, he said, "If Miss Su doesn't mind, you can stay in the隔壁 (隔壁 - next door) room for now."

Hearing this, Su Shiyu, now in distress, naturally agreed. She quickly expressed her thanks.

After a pause, Su Shiyu performed a deep bow. "Thank you, Brother Xu. After I rest for a few days, I plan to go to Yujing to seek refuge with my uncle."

Xu Yunfan nodded. "Since Miss Su has a goal, I'm naturally happy for you."

To be honest, when Su Shiyu was at the Long Wind Tavern in Beiye City, she had spent several hundred taels of silver just treating him to meals. She was straightforward and generous. Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't refuse to lend a hand if it was convenient.

As for helping with revenge, Xu Yunfan expressed that he could do little about it.

A Blood Transformation expert could be called a senior in the Jianghu. Such a realm expert was considered first-rate in the world. He couldn't match them, and going would be no different from seeking death.

If he could wait, after he reached the supreme grandmaster realm of Qi Transformation, he could lend a hand.

In the following time, Xu Yunfan didn't waste it. He continued to cultivate Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Forging Chapter relentlessly. As proficiency advanced, time passed day by day.

Nine days later, Xu Yunfan stood in the courtyard. He took a deep breath, and the muscles in his chest and abdomen suddenly undulated like waves. His latissimus dorsi, like awakened pythons, writhed beneath his skin, tracing fierce paths as they ground over his spine segment by segment.

This was a method that relied purely on muscular strength to rub against the bones, toughening them. Every movement caused his entire body to feel numb, itchy, and sore.

"Crack!"

His scapula suddenly emitted a grating friction sound.

Xu Yunfan clenched his teeth, the veins on his neck bulging.

He could clearly feel his trapezius muscles turning into two iron brushes, scraping back and forth from his acromion towards his arm bones. Every inch of bone emitted a groaning sound as if unable to bear the strain, yet amidst the intense pain, it exuded a jade-like, lustrous glow.

The muscles in his legs suddenly tightened like bowstrings. The fibers of his quadriceps bulged one by one, vibrating at high frequency like guitar strings. His kneecaps emitted a dense "cracking" sound, as if a thousand silver needles were shuttling back and forth within the marrow cavity.

A beast-like growl rumbled from Xu Yunfan's throat, his ten fingers digging deep into the soil.

Suddenly, a message notification popped up in his vision.

*'Your Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Forging Chapter has reached Great Completion.'*
