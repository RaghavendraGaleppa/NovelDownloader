# Chapter 216: Li Mo's Way to Break the Game!

In the darkness, killing intent was revealed.

A blade edge devoured all the surrounding light, shooting straight toward Li Mo's throat.

Being trapped in the darkness felt like sinking into a mire.

At that moment, Li Mo felt his body was incredibly heavy. If it were an ordinary Divine Sea cultivator, they probably wouldn't even be able to move a finger.

However, with the simultaneous operation of his four Profound Pills and the moonlight radiance enveloping him from behind, he had already regained his mobility.

But he didn't dodge, because there was no need.

*Clang—*

The Money Tree grew rapidly, instantly illuminating the darkness.

The moment visibility returned, the strangely shaped black long sword was blocked by a Dragon-Tiger Alchemist's Furnace. Its owner was pushed back by Elders Xue and Qian simultaneously, while shouting:

"Kill him first!"

Peng Keshan hadn't come alone.

Black-clothed men swarmed in from the roof and the windows.

The Scarlet Phoenix Qi, like a cold current condensed into mercury, caused a long sword made of tea water to appear in Ying Bing's hand.

With a slight movement, it drew forth hundreds of sword intents and sword energies, freezing several black-clothed men into ice sculptures riddled with holes.

"So many people have accepted the bounty?"

Li Mo's Red Sky Sword swung out, slanting into the opponent's flaw, then piercing the man and his dagger together.

Sun Gui and the guards and servants he brought also joined the fray.

Thus, the large tavern instantly descended into chaos.

But Li Mo never relaxed his vigilance.

According to his experience, assassins from the Drizzle Tower were not suicide warriors. If an attack failed, they would flee far away to look for another opportunity, rather than fighting the target to the death.

However, these Drizzle Tower assassins showed no intention of leaving.

Just as this thought crossed his mind.

*Rustle—*

The floor suddenly shattered.

A chain flew over menacingly, like a life-like dragon rising to the sky, bringing with it a surging tide.

This was also an attack from a Inner Scene Realm expert.

However, the opponent's domain was compressed to the extreme.

It didn't look imposing, but in reality, its killing power was more concentrated. The aura of death was so strong it almost made one's thoughts freeze instantly.

*Pa—*

A suddenly appearing pink fist struck into the tide. It was Shang Wu, who had been standing by without making a move.

With just one move, she accurately grabbed the chain, and then a淡 golden flame rolled back.

The moment the beautiful Master made her move.

This battle was already over.

That Inner Scene assassin hiding in the dark never expected that the palace-robed woman, who seemed like a drunken cat, would be so fierce.

The scene was a bit brutal.

......

Several minutes later.

The furnishings in the tavern, doors, and windows were all smashed. It looked like a mess.

The Divine Sea assassins lay scattered on the ground.

Of the assassins from the Drizzle Tower, only two Inner Scene assassins remained stubbornly alive—meaning they hadn't died yet.

"It was just a moment of carelessness. I didn't expect you to be so well-prepared, however..."

The Inner Scene expert who wielded the life-taking iron chain lay heavily injured on the ground, looking at the people surrounding him, still arrogantly saying:

"We are just the beginning, hehehe... Don't waste your effort, we won't say anything..."

"Oh, you aren't planning to talk?"

Shang Wu's face was expressionless. She punched him, smashing his head into his chest.

Peng Keshan fell silent for a moment, pulling out a smile uglier than crying: "Ask away, I'll tell you everything..."

*Bang—*

His head exploded instantly.

"Ask your mother."

Shang Wu sneered, kicking the uneasily dead Peng Keshan into the Yulong Lake outside.

He spun three and a half times in the air, his movements extremely ungraceful, and the splash was too big, like炸 fish.

Little Li Mo gave it a score of zero, disqualifying the contestant.

Hopefully, contestant Peng reflects on his actions properly and won't make such a mistake in his next life.

"Gulp..."

Sun Gui swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He stood at attention the instant the palace-robed woman's gaze turned to him:

"I, using the reputation of my ancestors eighteen generations of the Hengtong Mercantile House, swear that this matter has absolutely nothing to do with me!"

"That box originally contained Profound Crystals..."

Elders Xue and Qian looked at Li Mo.

As everyone knows.

Little Li Mo has always been very accurate in judging people.

Li Mo sheathed his Red Sky Sword and nodded: "It is indeed so."

This Shopkeeper Sun indeed had no ill intent toward him, and there was no relevant information in recent encounters.

After the clarification.

Li Mo found that his beautiful Master was a bit unhappy.

Probably because... she couldn't extort a payment?

Fortunately, Shopkeeper Sun was quite sensible. He not only offered a sum of mental damage compensation but also promised to fully assist the Clear Abyss Sect.

He had to bear some responsibility for this matter.

Sun Gui went to the Hengtong Mercantile House.

The tavern became quiet again.

After tidying up the place a bit, everyone sat at the intact table.

Although the storm had passed, Xue Jing still frowned worriedly:

"There are only a thousand days of being a thief, not a thousand days of guarding against one."

---

Qian Bufan nodded: "As long as the bounty isn't removed, there will be no peaceful days."

"It's not just a problem with the bounty."

"I am probably now classified as a traitor by the Drizzle Tower."

Li Mo spoke up.

Whoever succeeds in taking the bounty will receive not only the reward but also additional bonuses from within the Drizzle Tower.

So, even with Inner Scene experts by his side, there would still be people willing to take the risk.

Xue Jing's face was as heavy as water, and he sighed again:

"Traitors of the Drizzle Tower will face endless追杀 until their death."

"I haven't heard of anyone who managed to escape in the end..."

"There is one."

Ying Bing suddenly spoke.

Everyone looked at her.

She parted her vermilion lips slightly:

"Simply achieve the Seventh Realm."

Li Mo: "....."

That makes so much sense, I have no way to refute it.

How many Seventh Realm experts are there in the world? Those are the ones called Sages. If they did nothing but cause trouble for a specific power, even the Great Yu would have a headache.

"Who could survive the Drizzle Tower's full-scale pursuit and live to reach the Seventh Realm?" Xue Jing said with a bitter smile.

First of all, how many people can even become a Seventh Realm expert?

Let alone facing pursuit and bounties.

Ying Bing's eyes moved slightly, looking at Li Mo.

She had once done it.

Little Li Mo felt the inexplicable trust from the Ice Cube...

"That's not a bad method, it's just a bit long-winded."

"I'm not saying I lack confidence, it's just that having assassins showing up at the door all the time is too troublesome."

"Actually, the Drizzle Tower has a weakness. We can start from that aspect."

Little Li Mo, who was racking his brains, said seriously.

Hmm?

Everyone looked at him simultaneously.

There's a way?

"What weakness?" Ying Bing asked softly.

Li Mo slapped the table, as if his train of thought had finally opened up:

"Greed, profit-driven!"

"Huh? Is that considered a weakness?"

Shang Wu sat up straight, frowning her willow-like eyebrows.

"Naturally, it isn't a weakness for ordinary people."

Li Mo smiled modestly:

"But I happen to have some assets."

No one doubted this point.

But Xue Jing stroked his beard, not understanding Li Mo's meaning:

"So what? That's the Saintess's bounty. You can't exactly hire assassins to kill Yin Mianmian."

"Besides, even if the person dies, the bounty will still remain."

Just like how Xu Yi killed both employers back then.

This was indeed something the Drizzle Tower would do.

"Elder Xue's thinking is still too rigid. I have an idea."

Li Mo smiled:

"I go to the Black Tower and hire Drizzle Tower assassins to protect me. Wouldn't that work?"

Xue Jing was stunned, leaning back slightly.

Is that... even possible?

Qian Bufan hesitated: "But don't they only take assassination contracts..."

"If someone tries to kill me, they kill that person. Doesn't that count as killing?"

Li Mo felt this was perfectly logical.

The bounty for protecting him would definitely be higher than the bounty for killing him.

Even the former is already so tempting, let alone the latter.

By then, within the Drizzle Tower, everyone would be in danger, turning it into a dark forest.

No one would know which bounty their comrades had accepted, and they might even end up killing each other.

In this way, not only would the threat of the Drizzle Tower be resolved, but it would also plunge them into internal strife.

It's killing two birds with one arrow!

Little Li Mo felt he was truly a genius!

"Ah?"

Qian Bufan and Xue Jing instantly had their minds blown and fell into deep thought.

The more they thought about it, the brighter the light of wisdom in their eyes became.

According to the rules of the Drizzle Tower...

What Li Mo said didn't violate any of their rules!

It actually works!!?

Wait, seriously, this works??!

PS:

It's been a long time since I went to bed before two o'clock. A little street writer really needs to recharge, get a good night's sleep to maintain good writing quality.

My sleep quality has been terrible lately. Yesterday, I dreamed that I got up to play on the computer, and no matter what game I opened, I would end up in the comments section, filled with readers urging for updates...

It was terrifying.

I'll post two chapters today and go to bed early. I'll try to update earlier tomorrow.

Please support me with some power stones, mwah~
