# Chapter 191: The Real Object Prevails

In the state of Sword Heart Clarity, the power of the Sky Frost had been pushed to its absolute limit.

Had Yin Mianmian still been at the eighth level of the Observing Deity Realm and been able to fully execute the Demon幻形, she might have been able to put up some resistance.

But there was no "if."

The moment the sword passed, the countless celestial maidens vanished like illusory bubbles, returning to Yin Mianmian's true form.

Yin Mianmian let out a muffled groan. Her aura returned to the eighth level of the Observing Deity Realm, but she was clearly injured.

The Sword Mark Strange Stone reappeared.

Guarding the stone, afraid of any further accidents, Elder Zeng moved as well. Five swords suddenly emerged from the void—gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—perfectly matching the grand momentum of the Five Elements.

The moment the five swords descended, countless strands of sword qi were born in the air, ceaselessly regenerating, never stopping.

It wasn't just the Sword Tower; it felt as if everything in the surroundings had been severed by this Sword Domain, losing all connection to the real world.

Endless sword qi formed a dense, massive net.

Yin Mianmian's figure darted about, her uncanny footwork pushed to the extreme, yet the space for her to maneuver was rapidly shrinking. In just a few more breaths, she would lose all room to turn.

Elder Zeng, meanwhile, stood tall in the void, casually directing the sword qi with the air of someone threading a needle or painting a masterpiece.

"Pretty cool."

This was the first time Li Mo had observed a Fifth Realm expert in action from so close.

A Scenery Realm expert could manifest the landscape within their heart into the world, giving it a flavor of a real world.

Of course, it was still far inferior to the World Seed.

"Master was known as the Five Elements Swordsman in his youth."

Wu Chushu breathed a sigh of relief. Seeing that Li Mo was still on high alert, he explained, "In the Observing Deity Realm, he observed five Medium Forms and transformed them into Great Forms. Finally, the Five Elements merged into one, achieving the Inner Scenery, and then the Outer Scenery."

"It's a pity that the Five Elements Sword Body is extremely rare..."

Li Mo asked, "Is the early-stage progress very slow because it's difficult to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?"

Wu Chushu was taken aback. "How did you know?"

"..."

So, it's just a five-element mixed spiritual root.

The Five Elements Sword Body cultivates the Five Elements Sword Realm.

Then, what would his Outer Scenery manifest when he reaches the Fifth Realm in the future?

Little Li couldn't help but feel a bit curious.

Since the Outer Scenery is somewhat close to a World Seed, what would happen if he were to make the World Seed descend into the real world by integrating his inner and outer worlds?

Unfortunately, he could only mobilize a bit more of the world's power now; trying to realize this idea was still a long way off.

The genius Li Mo fell into deep thought.

"So... what Teacher released... is the Outer Scenery."

Jiang Chulong peeked out from behind Li Mo.

"...Hmm?"

Bai Jinghong's ears perked up.

Wu Chushu was also curious. He wanted to know who the teacher was for this girl who was a prodigy in the Sword Dao. Could it be a powerful figure from the Tianshan Sword Manor?

"May I ask for your teacher's honorable name, young lady?"

"Teacher... said not to tell anyone."

Jiang Chulong grabbed the hem of her Big Brother Li's clothes with her little hands and shook her head quickly.

"Not to tell..."

Wu Chushu thought for a moment and changed his approach. "Young lady, what does your teacher's Outer Scenery look like?"

Experts on the Earth Ranking or even the Heaven Ranking have Outer Scenery or Dharma Bodies that are highly recognizable.

"It's... it's... the Heavenly Court."

"There are thirty-three heavens... the South Heaven Gate... the Celestial Palace... the Grand Pure Palace... the Eight Trigrams Furnace... and also the Nine Nether Underworld... the Great Sage Equal to Heaven..."

"Ah... and there's also a beach... I even... made a sand sculpture there..."

Princess Jiang described the PowerPoint animation she had seen in vivid detail.

The Three Heroes of Hengyun were dumbfounded, instinctively leaning back in their seats.

You call *this* an Outer Scenery?

Hengyun Sword City had once produced a Seventh Realm Master of Profound Principles, who had a small world within him. Even that small world didn't have the grandeur this girl described; not even one-ten-thousandth of it.

If someone else had said this, they wouldn't have believed it.

But this girl was so naive and innocent, she wouldn't even realize if she was being tricked. She didn't look like she was boasting at all.

Li Mo: "..."

He silently covered his face.

*The images are for reference only; the real object prevails.*

Perhaps one day, when Princess Jiang's cultivation level is higher, she will know the truth...

"Thirty-three heavens..."

Ying Bing's breathing hitched slightly, her clear, deep eyes flickering.

Among the Nine Heavens, she knew who the most ancient was, and she herself was the strongest.

---

Not even an Eighth Realm expert, who has a world manifested within them, could possess such divine wonders.

Even she couldn't understand it.

Perhaps not even an Immortal could achieve such a thing.

However, this was based on Chulong's verbal description; its actual existence was still questionable.

At the very least, in her past life, she had never heard of such a thing.

At that moment.

*Rip—*

Suddenly, a thread of pure darkness pierced through the Five Elements Sword Domain, tearing a hole in it.

The Outer Scenery was shattered in an instant!

The world turned dark and dreary, the sun and moon lost their light. Black hurricanes, like world-destroying mad dragons, swept across the land.

Yin Mianmian took this opportunity to escape.

However, Elder Zeng had no time to pursue her. The five long swords surrounded the Sword Mark Strange Stone and the people present, compressing the Sword Domain to resist the corrosion of the darkness.

In the distance, a vicious and ferocious Mingwang statue, bound to a black stone pillar by thousands of chains, was revealed. The chains rattled and hummed, as if a black sun had descended.

"Dharma Body."

"The Ninth Heaven's Killing, the Evil Mingwang."

Ying Bing retracted her thoughts and stated the other party's origin.

After the other party descended, they did not make a move.

After a deep look towards the depths of Sword City, the black tide receded, taking the surviving assassins of the Drizzle Building with it as they fled into the distance.

Hengyun Sword City also had Dharma Bodies, and not just one.

But the Dharma Bodies within Sword City did not pursue.

If they were to fight, regardless of the outcome, Hengyun Sword City, along with Yunzhou City, would likely be razed to the ground, completely destroyed.

The Drizzle Building's plot to seize the Hengyun Sword Mark had come and gone in a hurry.

After sweeping up the assassins who couldn't escape with the black tide, this great crisis was finally over.

Thanks to their foreknowledge, the casualties on site were minimal. Even the various factions attending the summit were only in a state of confusion.

...

"It's finally over."

Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief.

Immediately after.

A constant stream of notifications rang in his ear, one after another.

Various types of investment feedback, some common and some rare, flooded in at this moment.

A huge explosion.

The quality was hard to say.

But the quantity was definitely the highest in history.

Speaking of quality, there was still a reward from the ice cube that he hadn't claimed yet.

"Too many to click, I can't click them all."

Little Li suppressed his desire to claim the rewards.

The elders gathered at the top of the Sword Tower.

After exchanging glances, they all bowed to Li Mo in unison.

"Many thanks to Young Hero Li for providing the information, and to Miss Ying Bing for stopping that demoness at the critical moment and protecting our city's treasure!"

"From now on, the two of you will always be our Sword City's honored guests!"

If it weren't for them, whether the Sword Mark could have been protected is one thing, but being ambushed by the Drizzle Building by surprise would have caused Hengyun Sword City to suffer heavy losses, even if it wasn't completely destroyed.

The elders were very open and generous.

"The Sword City is selfless, sharing its treasure with the world, which shows its righteousness."

"It was a trivial matter, no need for thanks."

Li Mo smiled from the bottom of his heart, completely indifferent to the heavy rewards they offered.

Everyone was moved.

Putting aside everything else, this young man's character was truly impeccable.

He truly had the air of a chivalrous gentleman!

"Young Hero Li is flawless!"

"Thinking back to my days walking the Jianghu, I truly feel the urge to become sworn brothers with Young Hero Li!"

Elder Zeng said with a mix of admiration and emotion. The atmosphere was just right.

Wu Chushu: "Huh?"

If Elder Zeng knew that Little Li's source of information was the "Northwest Hammer King," he probably wouldn't have such a thought.

Speaking of the Sword Mark.

Everyone finally remembered that the main event of the Martial Arts Summit hadn't been completed yet.

There were still people who hadn't had a chance to observe the Sword Mark Strange Stone.

This session's Sword Hero had also yet to be chosen.

They all turned their gaze towards Li Mo and Ying Bing.

...

PS: This novice writer did give the Immortal Body too early, showing a lack of experience in the fantasy genre, but the Immortal Body setting is very well-developed and will accompany the protagonist until the very end. The ice cube has already observed two Divine Intents; Little Li definitely has more than just a "Monna Lisa" too.
