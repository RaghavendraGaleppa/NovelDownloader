**Chapter 48: Foundation Establishment Sets Karma**

Another morning dawned upon the Blood-Clad Tower.

Feixia Xianzi leaned against the railing of the balcony, her graceful silhouette reflecting, inspiring myriad enchanting thoughts.

"Thank you, Junior Brother Lu, for your help during this period."

The two had just finished their cultivation session. Feixia Xianzi had reached her limit, finding it difficult to make further progress in the short term.

"Today, I plan to leave the cultivation market."

Turning her head, Feixia Xianzi looked directly at Lu Yang: "My state of mind is not as good as Junior Brother's, nor is my talent. Yet, I am unwilling to fade into obscurity as an ordinary mortal."

"Feixia's departure now means our next meeting, Junior Brother, may be far in the distant future." Feixia Xianzi raised her eyes, her gaze full of tender longing, and then sighed softly, "Perhaps a Dao path awaits in the future, or perhaps my bones will be buried in a foreign land. The immortal path is lonely, especially within the Sacred Sect. Feixia only hopes to meet an old friend again then."

Having said this, Feixia Xianzi smiled enchantingly at Lu Yang.

Her beautiful face, her clear smile, seemed to open her heart to Lu Yang for the first time: "Junior Brother... would you be that old friend of Feixia's?"

"..." Lu Yang remained silent for a long time.

A peerless beauty gazed at him with tender affection, like a vast net meticulously weaving around him, enough to make any man lose his mind.

However, Lu Yang resisted.

He calmly raised his hand: "Senior Sister is always welcome to return for tea."

He was seeing her off.

In that instant, Feixia Xianzi's eyes flickered, showing an unreadable mix of disappointment and helplessness. She then put away her smile, reverting to her cool and distant demeanor.

"This one takes her leave."

As her words fell, a streak of light, shaped like a rosy cloud, shot into the sky and vanished into the horizon.

It wasn't until she had truly departed that Lu Yang let out a breath, turned, and returned to the quiet room of the Blood-Clad Tower. He activated the formation, grasped the Innate Primordial Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman...

...and finally stopped his body from trembling.

"Damn it, a Foundation Establishment Perfected One is definitely scheming against me!"

Regarding Feixia Xianzi, he had thought their interactions were purely for cultivation exchange and learning.

But just now, he had actually felt his heart stir!

He had been momentarily disoriented and infatuated with Feixia Xianzi, almost saying "I do" several times. This emotion was clearly wrong and fundamentally contrary to his true self!

With the experience from his previous lives, Lu Yang quickly came to a conclusion: "The Foundation Establishment Perfected One behind the scenes is getting impatient, resorting to crude methods now. They're using Feixia Xianzi as bait, forcefully trying to bind me to her... they want to lure me out of the cultivation market!"

"Seclusion... I must enter seclusion!"

Thinking this, Lu Yang immediately announced that he was entering death seclusion, seeing no outsiders for a short period, thereby maximizing his efforts to prevent his karma from being entangled by others.

"...Remarkable."

Outside the Skull Mountain Cultivation Market, atop a cliff, a figure stood with hands behind his back. Behind him stood a respectful blood-robed youth.

The next second, the figure with hands clasped behind his back smiled: "An ordinary disciple, without any strong background, yet he can produce such a talent with a resolute Dao heart. It's truly rare. I tried to lure him with spells several times, but he never took the bait, second brother. I truly don't know whether to say your discernment is good or bad."

"This disciple begs your forgiveness, Senior Brother."

The blood-robed youth bowed respectfully, his tone also tinged with helplessness: "My original intention was merely to find a cannon fodder, but I didn't expect a shallow pond to produce a dragon..."

The blood-robed youth was named Luo Wuyai, the "Second Senior Brother" of the Three Rivers Society.

His cultivation was at the Grand Completion of Qi Condensation, and he had mastered a Great Divine Ability. He was outwardly the strongest individual of the Sacred Sect in Skull Mountain, a truly prominent figure.

The identity of the person who could command such respect from him was evident.

He was the Head of the Three Rivers Society!

His Daoist name was "Yinshan." After successfully reaching Foundation Establishment ten years ago, he became a high-ranking member of the Sacred Sect, permitted by the Sect Master to establish the Yinshan lineage within the Sea of Clouds.

"However, Senior Brother, I still don't understand. Must it really be a Sacred Sect disciple?"

"Second brother, you don't know."

Yinshan Zhenren shook his head: "The Ancient Witch-Ghost Dao was a great demonic sect, and its secret realm carries profound karma. Even I am unwilling to lightly involve myself with it."

In this world, karma exists everywhere.

If you gain benefits and form karma, you must repay it.

The Ancient Witch-Ghost Dao established its secret realm precisely to find someone of great destiny, to plant karma with their sect's inheritance, and seek an opportunity for their Dao lineage to revive.

"If I were to act personally, finding the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm would naturally be easy. I wouldn't even need to search; the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm would actively reveal itself. But if that happened, the karma of the Witch-Ghost Dao would fall upon me. Who knows how many troublesome matters that would bring, obstructing my cultivation..."

To put it plainly, Yinshan Zhenren wanted the goods but didn't want to pay the price.

"That's why I need someone to open the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm for me. The Witch-Ghost Dao was a great demonic sect, so choosing a Sacred Sect disciple is most suitable."

"I had originally chosen that 'Blood-Clad Tower Lord.' I even specifically lured many formidable enemies to him. As long as he was willing to step out of the cultivation market, I would act as his backer, help him slay his enemies, and accumulate his destiny. Once his destiny was sufficient, the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm would be attracted by it and emerge..."

If Lu Yang were here, he would certainly find these words familiar.

Because that's how Xiao Shiye had died back then.

Man-made Sons of Destiny, seemingly blessed with boundless luck, invincible in every battle, were in reality just bait used by Foundation Establishment Perfected Ones to reel in opportunities.

And once the opportunity was reeled in, the bait became useless.

Behind Yinshan Zhenren, the blood-robed youth Luo Wuyai bowed his head deeply, secretly trembling at the terrifying methods of a Foundation Establishment Perfected One manipulating karma and destiny.

"...Forget it."

Suddenly, Yinshan Zhenren shook his head: "Since that 'Blood-Clad Tower Lord' is unwilling to cooperate, then we'll just switch to another. He's not the only option."

At this point, Yinshan Zhenren chuckled lightly: "Second brother, do you remember how the Ancient Witch-Ghost Dao was destroyed?"

"I know, it was by the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion."

Luo Wuyai nodded: "That generation's Sword Pavilion Headmaster, a Golden Core True Monarch, unleashed a single sword strike from the Seven Stars Cliff of the Sword Pavilion, and the Witch-Ghost Dao's mountain gate immediately sank into the earth..."

"Indeed, just one sword strike."

Yinshan Zhenren sighed with emotion: "During its peak, the Ancient Witch-Ghost Dao had a double-digit number of Foundation Establishment Perfected Ones, and even a Grade 4 formation suppressing its fortune."

"Even so, it still couldn't withstand a sword strike unleashed by a Golden Core True Monarch from tens of thousands of miles away."

"Furthermore, that sword strike still remains within the Witch-Ghost Dao's secret realm to this day!"

At this, a hint of dread flickered in Yinshan Zhenren's eyes: "A True Monarch's decree, sword qi enduring in the world. As long as the Witch-Ghost Dao is not destroyed, that sword qi will naturally not vanish."

This was also why he wasn't willing to personally enter the fray.

The sword qi of a Golden Core True Monarch, and from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, the leader of the righteous path at that! What if he went to open the secret realm and that sword qi casually struck him down?

So, finding a pathfinder was much safer.

"That sword qi and the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm have been intertwined for countless years, already becoming one. So, if we can't open the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm through a Sacred Sect disciple, we can change direction: find a way to lure a Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion disciple to obtain that sword qi. The effect would actually be the same..."

As he spoke, Yinshan Zhenren's gaze shifted, and he finally left the cultivation market.

Almost simultaneously, Lu Yang, who was in secluded cultivation within the market, suddenly felt his body lighten, as if an immense burden had been lifted, revealing a look of surprise on his face.
