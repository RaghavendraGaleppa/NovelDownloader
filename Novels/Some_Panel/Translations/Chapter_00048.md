## Chapter 48: A Genius Should Be Valued (Part 1)

Everyone looked around in bewilderment. They had followed the surge of spiritual light down here, only for this to be the result? There was nothing! They hadn't even seen a single thatched hut, which left everyone incredibly frustrated.

True Monarch Nan Kui frowned, unwilling to give up. He stretched out his right hand, reaching into the air to seize a trembling Ghost-Faced Mushroom. After soul-searching it, he found nothing. Next, he began soul-searching the Ancient Coiled Trees and Floating Insects, but he merely shook his head in disappointment.

Seeing this, True Monarch Ling Gu and True Monarch Chi Huo followed suit, not sparing the Ghost-Faced Mushrooms, Ancient Coiled Trees, Floating Insects, or even the Blue Indigo Grass. They conducted continuous soul-searches and tried to sense life traces, but found nothing. Everyone was utterly dejected.

"That soaring spiritual light must have been the energy released when the spatial restriction outside was destroyed. But how do you explain those flowing vajra-hard splinters? I believe there's definitely a hidden mystery down here; our cultivation is simply too low to perceive it," True Monarch Chi Huo said, his brows furrowed.

"In that case, we'll just have to return to the sect and ask a Supreme Elder to investigate," True Monarch Ling Gu remarked, scrutinizing the rock wall.

*A Supreme Elder to investigate? The senior who created the human-shaped weapon clearly comprehended the 'Dao', meaning their cultivation was at least at the Void Refinement Stage. Even if a Divine Transformation Supreme Elder were to investigate, they probably wouldn't find anything. Even if they found the concealing restriction, there's still a spatial teleportation restriction blocking the way. The chances of entering the inheritance land beyond are still slim. Since the senior who left the inheritance set the conditions for teleportation, it's likely that ordinary people absolutely cannot break the restrictions,* Yang Ji thought, his eyes flashing.

"No time to waste, let's go!" True Monarch Nan Kui glowed with a flash of yellow light and immediately turned to leave.

True Monarch Chi Huo's feet erupted in flames, and he likewise turned around.

"Changxiao, young friend, we should go too!" True Monarch Ling Gu turned back, glanced at Yang Ji and Li Changxiao, then grabbed both of them and performed his instant movement technique, fleeing outwards.

"Hey, hey, hey, wait for me!" Mang Biao panicked, his heart sinking. *Oh no, True Monarch Ling Gu wouldn't just take my little brother away like this, would he? What about my injuries then?* Thinking of this, his expression changed, and spiritual light surged around him. He unleashed a desperate burst of speed and frantically gave chase.

The instant movement technique of a Nascent Soul True Monarch was truly fast. In a mere instant, as the world twisted and shifted, they arrived above the waterfall. Yang Ji secretly clicked his tongue, such speed was terrifying.

Once outside, True Monarch Ling Gu swept his storage bag and took out a talisman. With a light tap, spiritual light flashed, and the talisman transformed into a palm-sized spiritual bird that swiftly flew into the distance.

"I've sent a message to the Supreme Elder via the spiritual bird. The Supreme Elder will arrive soon."

After doing this, True Monarch Ling Gu turned to Yang Ji, smiling amiably. "Young friend, where do you live? I'll escort you there."

Yang Ji was surprised by True Monarch Ling Gu's attitude towards him, and Li Changxiao. It was a bit too good. He was about to speak when he heard a loud shout from below the waterfall.

"True Monarch, he lives on Black Wind Island with me!" Mang Biao shot out as a streak of spiritual light, drenched in sweat. Seeing that everyone was still there, he frantically rushed over.

"Black Wind Island? Alright, then let's go to Black Wind Island to talk," True Monarch Ling Gu smiled, a sheet of spiritual light enveloping everyone, including Mang Biao and Tang Long. In the next instant, he performed his instant movement technique again. In just ten breaths or so, they arrived at Black Wind Island. One must remember that this distance had taken Mang Biao and the others a full day and night of desperate flight.

Noticing the hint of shock in Yang Ji's eyes, True Monarch Ling Gu chuckled. "Though my speed is fast, compared to those mighty cultivators who can tear space and cross vast distances, it's just a child flying a kite – not worth mentioning."

Then, he looked at Mang Biao. "You're the island master, correct?"

Seeing True Monarch Ling Gu looking at him, Mang Biao quickly nodded in affirmation, a warm smile on his face. "True Monarch, please come to the island and rest for a while!"

True Monarch Ling Gu gave a faint nod.

Mang Biao quickly led everyone onto the island and swiftly arranged a well-built secret chamber for Yang Ji, True Monarch Ling Gu, and Li Changxiao.

Outside the secret chamber, Mang Biao incessantly paced back and forth, his brow furrowed in worry. He was secretly uneasy. *What are they talking about? My little brother wouldn't expose my act of confining him, would he? If the True Monarch gets angry, will he cleave me in two? Perhaps I shouldn't have brought them here.* Mang Biao's face was a picture of misery as he frequently glanced inside, muttering anxiously to himself.

"Young friend, are you perhaps curious why we are so enthusiastic towards you?" Inside the secret chamber, True Monarch Ling Gu asked with a gentle smile.

Yang Ji nodded. He was indeed puzzled. He was merely a low-level Qi Condensation cultivator; why would a Nascent Soul True Monarch be so gentle and amicable towards him?

"Because you are a genius. A genius should be valued," True Monarch Ling Gu stated as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

"..."

True Monarch Ling Gu's frank praise genuinely left Yang Ji flattered and overwhelmed. He felt a bit unconfident and humbly said, "Senior, I merely possess an inferior spiritual root; I can hardly be called a genius."

True Monarch Ling Gu shook his head. "No, I'm speaking of your comprehension!"

"There are many spiritual treasures in this world that can improve one's spiritual roots, but individuals with outstanding comprehension are exceedingly rare."

"The further one progresses in cultivation, the more crucial comprehension becomes."

"As the saying goes, attaining the Dao is difficult, attaining the Dao is difficult! The reason it is difficult is precisely because comprehending the Dao is difficult!"

"I can frankly say that your exceptional comprehension is the reason I value you."

True Monarch Ling Gu smiled. "Young friend, if you join our Canglan Sect, let alone receiving my attention, as long as you demonstrate sufficient potential in comprehension, even Divine Transformation Supreme Elders will revolve around you."

"For instance, Changxiao is a direct disciple of a Divine Transformation Supreme Elder and also a nominal disciple of Jian Yuanzi. The Grandmaster Alchemists in the sect attend to him daily. The people in the Dining Hall always ask him with a smile what he wants to eat today – dragon liver or phoenix gall?"

"Although a Supreme Elder is the most supreme existence within the sect, they are on standby around the clock, serving Changxiao."

"If he's frustrated with cultivation, a Supreme Elder comes to guide him."

"Lacking combat experience? A Supreme Elder personally spars with him."

"Confused about cultivation? 'Come, a Supreme Elder will take you out for a stroll'."

"Want to learn a new spell? All the cultivation techniques and spells in the Skill Repository are freely available for him to choose from."

*What kind of treatment is this? Even Divine Transformation Supreme Elders revolve around him! This is practically being an uncrowned king!* Yang Ji swallowed incredulously, secretly glancing at Li Changxiao.

True Monarch Ling Gu noticed Yang Ji's expression and smiled faintly. "Young friend, if you come to the sect, everything I mentioned—Divine Transformation Supreme Elders, Grandmaster Alchemists, the Dining Hall, and even a Dao companion—will be arranged for you."

"I can even be assigned a Dao companion?" Yang Ji was momentarily stunned.

"Cough, cough, of course, that still requires the other party's consent. However, if you take a liking to a certain Immortal Maiden, I'm sure the sect's high-ranking officials will help you put in a good word. But then again, if a genius, especially a handsome genius like yourself, were to show favor, I doubt any Immortal Maiden would be able to refuse," True Monarch Ling Gu said with a smile, not holding back his praise.

"Am I really qualified?" Such flattery made Yang Ji feel a bit light-headed. His voice now sounded somewhat lacking in confidence.

"Cough, cough, you are temporarily not qualified for *that* level. What I mentioned is top-tier treatment, the kind that Changxiao currently enjoys. If you want to reach that level, you need to display your inherent comprehension. Your initial Sword Dao Imprint is enough to garner the sect's attention, but to receive further resource allocation, you'll have to rely on your own efforts going forward."

"Given the comprehension you've displayed so far, you can enjoy benefits befitting a quasi-Nascent Soul True Monarch. All cultivation techniques and spells within the sect are open for you to learn freely. Additionally, the cultivation resources you'll receive, such as pills, immortal dwellings, and spirit stones, will also be at this level."
