# Chapter 428: The Realm Gate

As Po Zhang's figure departed, a flicker of strange emotion crossed Miao Dian Bodhisattva's eyes, followed by a sigh.

If it weren't for Zhenjun Qingyuan being present, she could have easily handled the matter of the Xuankong Mountain Netherland herself.

If the Puchan Pure Land is to flourish, it must strive further.

She had made a great vow to attain the status of a Great Buddha. Only if the Puchan Pure Land thrives would she have even a sliver of a chance to glimpse the position of a Buddha.

With these thoughts, the golden body of Miao Dian Bodhisattva shimmered with a glazed aura, and the twelve-petaled lotus platform slowly rotated in the void.

She gazed at the setting sun in the west, and in her palm, the Brahman flower bloomed and withered.

This was the third thousandth time she had performed such divination, yet the line of rise and fall for the Puchan Pure Land remained obscure and unclear.

The Wansheng Sword Sect and the Primordial Demon Sect were two insurmountable mountains.

Once the Pure Land attempted to spread its teachings eastward, it would inevitably be intercepted by the Wansheng Sword Sect and thwarted by the Primordial Demon Sect.

"The Asura-Dragon Plan is still missing a crucial link..."

The Bodhisattva pinched a wisp of dissipating incense and wish-fulfilling power. The *Shurangama Mantra* hanging from the beam moved without wind, revealing the verse on the title page that had been covered in gold paint: "I vow not to become a Buddha until the Pure Land prospers."

This was the great vow she had made under the Sala tree back in the day, all for the sake of attaining the status of a Great Buddha. Now, however, it had become the heaviest shackle. Unless she could convert the newly ascended "Zhenwu" and turn him into a member of the Asura-Dragon race, she could not advance further.

Three months later, on Zhenwu Peak.

The Concealing Stars and Blocking Moon Formation had been operating for over three months. The originally faint mist had condensed into a tangible substance, and not even a sliver of divine sense could penetrate it.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back at the formation's core, observing how the spiritual light of the entire peak interplayed with the thirty-six formation flags.

The low-grade magic tools scavenged from Xu Tian and the others were now emanating a jade-like luster under the nourishment of the earth's veins.

It was a pity the materials were too low-grade. If he could find some high-quality formation flags to nurture here, given a few hundred or even a thousand years, they might just become a set of Dharma treasures.

Nourished by heaven and earth, their power would naturally be top-tier.

"Done!"

Xu Yunfan looked at the smoothly operating formation before him, feeling extremely satisfied.

He glanced at a line of text that had appeared in his vision.

*'Your "Preliminary Understanding of Formations" has reached Minor Completion.'*

After reaching Minor Completion, a vast amount of basic knowledge regarding formations appeared in his mind, making him highly proficient with them. The flaws in the Concealing Stars and Blocking Moon Formation he had previously laid out were now glaringly obvious to him, so he had rearranged it.

Perhaps due to the improvement in his own cultivation level, his comprehension of the *Preliminary Understanding of Formations* was extremely rapid. In just three short months, he had already pushed it to the realm of Minor Completion.

The progress was gratifying.

"You two will guard this place and cultivate diligently."

"We shall obey the Peak Master's command!"

Xu Yunfan casually instructed the male and female Taoist children before him, then paid them no further mind.

As the master of a peak, it would look rather pathetic to be all alone. Naturally, he had selected two outstanding talents from the newly recruited disciples of the Primordial Demon Sect to fill the place, adding a bit of liveliness.

"It's time to move."

After leaving Zhenwu Peak, Xu Yunfan headed straight for the southeast corner of the Primordial Demon Sect.

The Realm Gate forged by the Primordial Demon Sect was surrounded by nine bronze pillars engraved with the map of the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm. The star sand paving the ground rippled with his footsteps.

He took out the Realm Talisman obtained from Baiyue True Person—a赤 jade token inscribed with the words "Divine Martial"—and embedded it into the central formation core.

As the token settled into place, the patterns on the bronze pillars lit up one by one with a幽 blue light.

Xu Yunfan activated the Turtle Breath Concealing Spirit Technique from the *True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra*. His pores closed up like an ancient turtle hibernating, and the flesh tumor on his spiritual platform shrank to the size of a mustard seed, perfectly suppressing the true yuan fluctuations of the Foundation Establishment realm to the peak of the Qi Condensation realm.

It was a pity the Turtle Breath Concealing Spirit Technique had not yet reached Great Completion. If it could reach Perfection, this technique alone could conceal his fate, making it difficult for divination techniques to find any trace of him.

Although it could still block divination now, if the opponent possesses a Heavenly Fate Treasure to perform calculations, it would be easy for them to catch his trail.

Although Heavenly Fate Treasures are rare and seldom seen in the world, one must still be on guard.

Now that he had stepped into the early stage of Foundation Establishment, the *True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra* had also been cultivated to the realm of Great Completion. However, Xu Yunfan estimated that he would likely need to reach the peak of Foundation Establishment to bring this sutra to its ultimate perfection.

It was a long way off.

Xu Yunfan sighed, merely suppressing his own aura. His spiritual power sank into his dantian's qi sea, remaining dormant like a turtle hiding in its shell. The turtle and snake intertwined, like a deep freeze in winter.

When several strands of divine sense peered from outside the formation, they only detected the mixed aura of an ordinary Primordial Demon Sect disciple. After a few casual glances, they paid no further attention.

When the ninth bronze pillar was fully lit, the Realm Talisman suddenly burst with black light, tearing open a rift in the air with edges wreathed in grey-white mist.

Xu Yunfan immediately sensed the aura of the Divine Martial Realm from the other side of the rift.

It was far thinner and more impure than the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm, to the point where he felt it was somewhat difficult to even set foot there.

Damn it, after staying in such a good environment for so long, suddenly returning to this muddy place feels somewhat uncomfortable.

He checked the Zhenwu Sword hidden in his sleeve one last time, confirming that all thirty-six spiritual power nodes had been properly sealed with the Black Tortoise Subduing Demon Seal, before turning into a流光 and vanishing into the Realm Gate.

The moment Xu Yunfan turned into a流光 and vanished into the Realm Gate, a strange ripple appeared in the void thirty zhang away from the gate.

Two vague figures emerged from the shadows of the bronze pillars. One was a pale-faced cultivator holding a Sky-Spying Mirror.

As the rift of the Realm Gate was about to close, the紫袍 old man suddenly severed a karmic thread and said with a cold, sinister laugh, "He's in?"

The figure beside him nodded slightly. "The Zhenjun only managed to buy us this much time... It's just a pity that of all things, he had to cultivate this sutra. It's currently the only attainable and verifiable先天金性."

As he spoke, his eyes were filled with greed.

The紫袍 old man snorted coldly upon seeing this. "What, thinking of reincarnating to cultivate again?"

The tall, thin black shadow sighed upon hearing this and shook his head slightly, saying no more.

He didn't have the nerve. This *True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra* was a烫手山芋.

Whoever cultivates it gets screwed to death.

The cultivator beside him looked at the aura fluctuations of suppressed cultivation shown on the mirror surface and said in a hoarse voice, "He suppressed his cultivation to the peak of Qi Condensation."

He flipped his hand, revealing three blood-colored talismans. "This is the perfect time to pick the fruit."

He looked at the others, tilting his head. "Shall we go in together?"

"It's settled then, I want his body. As for the condensed Divine Martial Dao Foundation, whoever wants it can have it."

"That's what the Zhenjun wants. Whoever takes it won't even be able to enter the cycle of reincarnation!"

"..."

Immediately after, the three powerful auras of the Foundation Establishment realm were suddenly suppressed, as if restrained by an invisible hand.

The紫袍 old man performed hand seals and chanted incantations. Blood-colored patterns rippled around the three of them, and their cultivation level visibly dropped layer by layer, finally stabilizing at the peak of Qi Condensation.

Just as the rift of the Realm Gate was about to close, three figures turned into流光 and filed into it, vanishing into the grey-white mist.

While traversing the Realm Gate, Xu Yunfan's heart skipped a beat. Warned by his martial intuition, he instinctively activated the Martial Dao Sky-Eye in his brow to accept the surrounding information flow.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, a flicker of surprise in his eyes, followed by a hint of a smile at the bottom of his eyes.

"A bit interesting..."
