# Chapter 19: Mastering at First Glance

**Northern Storm (Part 1):** Time passed unnoticed in the mountain village. When I left again, I was already twenty-one without realizing it. Having achieved the Five Qi Converging to Origin and cultivated innate true energy, I planned to bid farewell to Black Eagle Venerable and return directly to Xiangzhou. Unexpectedly, conflict erupted once more in the northern lands.

Years ago, Black Eagle Venerable had risked life and limb to transport military supplies across thousands of miles, thwarting Fire Cloud True Master's grand scheme. Now, Fire Cloud True Master had returned for revenge, aiming to eliminate Black Eagle Venerable first to intimidate the northern territories.

When I arrived, enemies were already attacking.

A one-armed martial artist lashed out at me with his whip. I couldn't comprehend his audacity—how could a firefly dare challenge the sun?

At a glance, I saw through his technique. Though his whip appeared fierce, its weak point lay precisely seven inches from the tip—a single strike there would shatter his defense and kill him instantly. Yet with a mere wave of my hand, my innate true energy manifested as a roaring white tiger that obliterated him from existence.

Why bother targeting weaknesses when killing is this effortless?

The second attacker—a gaunt, black-robed man with a haggard face—dared to glance at me instead of fleeing.

Observing his crude and chaotic innate energy, I knew concentrating my power at a single point would easily break through his defenses. Instead, I simply swung my sword, unleashing a tidal wave of innate true energy that annihilated all remaining foes.

The purple-robed swordsman's arm trembled during techniques, creating momentary openings. The blue-clad middle-aged man's palm strikes were clumsy, his footwork even worse.

These worthless opponents weren't worth my attention—their flaws were too numerous to count.

**Ten Days of Diligent Training Reward: Basic Sword Techniques (Perfection) - Completed!**

Just as Dou Changsheng swallowed the Millennium Earth Pearl and began swelling with arrogance, a bucket of cold reality doused his enthusiasm.

The future version of himself had already shown signs of existing on a different timeline. Their timelines weren't synchronized, and the flow of time seemed unpredictable. Now it was clear—the future Dou Changsheng's time moved faster.

Catching up would be difficult when he couldn't predict how many years might pass before the next mission.

Even without the [Good Life System], the future Dou Changsheng's fortune would ensure rapid growth. Simple missions and constant serendipitous encounters made strength inevitable.

Witnessing how effortlessly his future self dispatched enemies only deepened Dou Changsheng's bitterness. That one-armed warrior he'd recently faced—a life-threatening opponent—had been casually swatted aside like an insect.

Dou Changsheng took deep breaths, suppressing his turbulent emotions. Dwelling on comparisons would only breed despair.

He turned to the martial manuals—a sword technique and a movement art—precisely what he lacked most. The sword technique focused on qi manipulation, perfectly suited to his abilities, while the movement art enhanced speed for both combat and escape.

Though still unbalanced, he was making progress, especially after recent battles that had taught him much.

After several readings, Dou Changsheng realized something odd—these techniques seemed... easy?

The *Boundless Sword Art* simply channeled innate qi in straightforward patterns before release. Its only challenge was requiring vast amounts of qi—something he now possessed in abundance.

The *Cloud Dragon Triple Leap* movement art allowed three consecutive jumps without needing to land—an ingenious technique for the Innate Realm.

Each rereading made the techniques appear simpler as new insights emerged. Dou Changsheng suddenly understood—this wasn't normal.

With his original talent, mastering *Fearless Sword Art* had been a struggle, requiring system assistance just to reach beginner level. This sudden comprehension must be the Millennium Earth Pearl's doing.

The treasure hadn't just enhanced his qi—it had reshaped his innate aptitude. While he couldn't claim mastery of supreme techniques overnight, these martial arts now came effortlessly at first glance.

Exhaling slowly, Dou Changsheng claimed his system reward. Talent alone meant nothing without time to cultivate—the system's instant rewards remained invaluable.

Having benefited from perfected thrusting techniques before, he eagerly anticipated mastering other foundational sword moves.

As he accepted the reward, countless training sequences flooded his mind—images of relentless practice.

Thrusts, points, slashes, sweeps, draws, flicks, intercepts, wipes, lifts...

His sword comprehension skyrocketed. Though he'd gained some insights previously, they'd lacked structure and foundation.

Sudden enlightenment couldn't transform a novice into a master—it provided conceptual understanding, while technical proficiency required grinding repetition.

The deepest realization came for *Fearless Sword Art*. Subconsciously, Dou Changsheng's fingers began executing thrusts and jabs.

From beginner to minor achievement, then major achievement—all within a single breath.

This simplest of sword arts, dubbed the "Courage Blade," lived up to its name. It demanded pure audacity—discarding thought to unleash increasingly powerful consecutive strikes.

Theoretically, a second or third strike shouldn't be possible through pure technique. But with *Triple Origin Reversion Art*—a perfect complement emphasizing valor—combined with his newfound insights and abundant innate qi, a second strike became achievable.

This wasn't elevating *Fearless Sword Art* to true innate-level techniques. It was creating a personalized strike impossible for others to replicate—even with *Triple Origin Reversion Art*, none could match his qi reserves or comprehension.

No wonder the Millennium Earth Pearl was legendary. Its transformative power was undeniable.

The future Dou Changsheng was even more formidable than imagined. If the Earth Pearl alone could produce such metamorphosis, what other trump cards might he possess?

How enviable... how utterly maddening his fortune was!
