# My Immortal Cheat - Chapter 51: Pros and Cons!

“Teacher, please rest assured. We didn’t leave anything that could directly prove we instigated them. Even if those people point fingers at us, we can simply deny it. They can’t possibly act against us based on the one-sided testimony of a few individuals, can they? We merely wanted others to know that our Great Luo Academy is not to be trifled with.” One of the individuals forcefully explained.

“Instigation? Denial? So you’re claiming this was all for the academy’s sake!” Academician Li trembled with rage, his silver hair fluttering. With a flash of runes, a teaching rod, resembling warm purple jade, appeared in his hand. It wasn't long, about a meter in length, crystal clear as if water could drip from it, enveloped in a mist of ethereal energy.

“Is this all you’ve learned at the academy?”

The purple teaching rod swung down without a sound, yet the faces of the individuals standing before him turned ashen. Sweat poured down them as they clenched their jaws, forcibly suppressing any cries.

Just as Academician Li was about to raise the rod again, the group's faces contorted in fear. Their gazes darted to Academician Li's left, where a person sat, also in the uniform of the Great Luo Academy. He was handsome, eyes closed as if in meditation. As if sensing their gazes, he opened his eyes. Both irises were a striking jade green, seemingly holding countless scriptures that floated and sank within their depths.

“Academician, if that rod descends again, these few will be crippled!”

The voice was gentle and full of magnetism, instantly inspiring goodwill.

Academician Li’s raised rod paused in mid-air. He let out a cold snort, then lowered it.

“Things have come to this; blaming them won’t solve the problem. It’s better to think about how to deal with it,” the person said indifferently, closing his eyes once more.

“Ziqing, it’s not easy for your family to produce a seed of Pure-Hearted Loyalty. If you were to fall here, wouldn’t your family be heartbroken to death?” From Academician Li’s right side came a lazy voice. A young man rubbed his eyes and yawned, looking as if he had just woken up. He flicked a bit of eye-crust towards Ziqing, which landed perfectly less than a foot from his body, turning into powder and vanishing into the void.

“Iron Ox, as the Chief of the Confucian Institute, why do you have such childish thoughts?” Ziqing’s expression remained unperturbed, calm as still water, as if Iron Ox’s previous action hadn’t affected him at all.

“Ziqing, don’t act like everything is within your control. You have Pure-Hearted Loyalty, not a Nine-Aperture Exquisite Heart. You don’t possess the ability to calculate heaven and earth…” Iron Ox said with disdain, utterly disliking people who always wore an expression of having everything under control.

“These junior disciples are right,” Ziqing said, opening his eyes and looking at the standing individuals. His deep jade-green eyes were unfathomable. “They all wore blurring formations. No formation can record their voices or appearances, unless they were foolish enough to speak in front of a powerhouse who is at least a Saint King!”

“No… no, we inquired carefully,” the person standing at the front quickly explained, trembling slightly under Ziqing’s gaze. “The deepest background we sought out was from the Haotian Sect, and the one who came with them was only a Saint. We approached him first, and after that, we randomly selected rogue cultivators. Even if Zhoutian received news, it would be impossible for him to arrange Saint Kings around so many rogue cultivators.” After all, they were individuals chosen through strict selection in Great Luo Province and had given it some thought—if only they hadn’t encountered Ziqing, this ‘protagonist’!

“Then what remains is merely a squabble,” Ziqing nodded. “Tianqin will not, and cannot, act against us based solely on the one-sided testimonies of a few people!”

It was clear that Ziqing was not on the same level as those few individuals; when the same sentiment came from his mouth, Academician Li merely frowned and remained silent.

Ziqing pondered for a moment before continuing. “You’re from the Disciplinary Court, aren’t you?”

“Uh… yes,” the individuals nodded, a bad premonition rising in their hearts.

“Go back and find Teacher Wuling. Demote yourselves by one academic rank and deduct 10 academic points,” Ziqing said slowly.

“…”

The complexions of those individuals, which had only just begun to recover from the earlier teaching rod incident, turned incredibly ugly. Unwillingness and resentment filled their faces. They opened their mouths, waited for a while, then finally spoke with extreme reluctance. “Yes…”

“Ziqing, you’re quite impressive, extending your reach even to the Disciplinary Court. Isn’t your family from the Heavenly Institute?” Iron Ox said in a teasing, sarcastic tone.

“This is for their own good. The Disciplinary Court’s punitive measures are the strictest in the entire Great Luo Academy. If Wuling were to come after them, the punishment wouldn’t be so simple.” He then turned to the few individuals and asked, “Do you know why you’re being punished?”

“Unscrupulous methods…” the person at the front said feebly.

“Wrong!” Ziqing frowned, like ripples suddenly disturbing a calm pond. “You truly haven’t learned anything at the academy! Your punishment does indeed stem from the problem with your methods, but not because they were 'unscrupulous.' It’s because your methods were too rudimentary, foolish! And you were far too overconfident!”

“This is Tianqin Imperial Capital. If the powerful figures of Tianqin want to investigate something, what can’t they find out? They can even find out how many girls Iron Ox was with last night, and how many times it happened, let alone your little tricks!”

“How could you… *cough cough*… don’t make up examples and fabricate facts!” Iron Ox stumbled, saying awkwardly.

“Do you really think the academy can protect you forever?” Ziqing ignored Iron Ox, who had almost blurted out the truth, and continued to lecture the few individuals. “Either you endure it, or you use the most perfect means to make them suffer in silence. What was this? The academy’s protection accounted for ninety percent of your entire scheme!…”

While they were discussing above, Tianling and Zhang San’s battle had already begun.

On the arena, as the divine chains of order restricting them vanished, neither of them wasted any words.

“Kill!” Zhang San roared, flames igniting in his pupils. His long spear turned completely crimson, as if roasted over divine fire. Heat waves enveloped his entire body, and scarlet runes surged forth, energy erupting like a volcano.

With a flash of his spear, a crimson flame dragon coiled around its shaft. Zhang San transformed into a streak of scarlet divine light and charged towards Tianling.

Tianling’s gaze was solemn. Fiery waves and a ferocious divine dragon surged towards her. Zhang San’s magnificent body unleashed a powerful aura, like a moving, active volcano!

“Hah!” Tianling lightly cried out. Towering gale-force winds rose heavenward, incredibly sharp, seemingly tearing space itself. Green runes enveloped her entire body, and within the boundless winds, a green longsword slowly materialized. Just a glance at it gave one the feeling of being about to be torn apart!

Tianling’s figure flickered, green tornadoes appearing beneath her feet. Gripping the green longsword, she swung her hand and unleashed a hundred-zhang sword qi. Gale-force winds surged, and boundless energy waves accompanied the sword qi.

Seeing this, Zhang San’s overwhelming crimson flames also swept across half the sky. An ancient volcano truly materialized behind him, spewing forth boundless lava. This was one of his divine abilities.

The entire arena was split into two colors as the green gale-force winds and crimson flames violently collided, as if a great star had exploded in that very spot, unleashing torrents of destructive power!
