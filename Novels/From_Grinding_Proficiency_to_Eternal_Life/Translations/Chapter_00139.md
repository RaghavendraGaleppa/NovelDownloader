# Chapter 139: The Heavenly Art Reverses

Bao Yan’s hands trembled as the sound of thunder rolled from his mouth. He sent Xu Yunfan flying backward, his fingers twitching uncontrollably as the scattered flying swords rushed back to protect him.

Xu Yunfan twisted his body, slinging the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer onto his back, and used the momentum to land right in front of Mo Shisan.

The moment the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer knocked the poisoned sword away, Xu Yunfan spun around and shouted, "Brother Mo, can your mechanical wings fly?"

Mo Shisan was stunned for a moment and answered subconsciously.

"There are mechanical wings three inches below my ribs. One flap can fly three..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan kicked him squarely in the waist.

The moment the mechanical wings sprang open, Mo Shisan plummeted toward the Heavenly Art City below like a kite with a broken string.

As he fell rapidly, Mo Shisan watched Xu Yunfan’s figure shrink quickly in his vision, his heart pounding with a complex mix of emotions.

He hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to throw him away to face Bao Yan alone. Although Bao Yan’s blood energy had dried up due to age, causing his realm to drop to the Half-Step Blood Transformation stage, he was still far beyond what a Three-Training Warrior could handle—even if Mo Shisan was at the peak of the Skin and Muscle Refinement stage.

A surge of heat rushed through his chest.

"Xu Yunfan, you..."

The howling wind swallowed Mo Shisan's roar.

He looked at the increasingly small figure on the Heavenly Art corridor, his eyes burning.

*The nuisance is finally gone.*

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath, looking at Bao Yan with a cold expression.

On the Heavenly Art bridge, Bao Yan’s black gold threads had already woven a heaven-wide net. He looked at Xu Yunfan standing alone on the eaves, a hint of surprise on his face.

"I underestimated your loyalty."

"Loyalty?"

Xu Yunfan scoffed. He strode forward, slapping the steel box behind him. The dragon-head pommel of the gilded mace sprang out, and he grabbed it instantly.

The steel box opened completely as the gilded mace sang its way out of its sheath. This heavy mace, a divine weapon from a great general of the previous dynasty, was covered in scale patterns. As it shook, the divine weapon hummed on its own, and wisps of molten gold seemed to flow along its surface.

In an instant, the weapon’s spiritual resistance caused the reverse scale patterns on the handle to cut open the palm of his hand. The veins on his arm bulged like green pythons coiling around a tree.

Bao Yan’s black gold threads pursued him, but Xu Yunfan used the recoil to leap three zhang into the air.

"Lin!"

Nine layers of thunderous sound exploded from Xu Yunfan’s throat.

The joints of Xu Yunfan’s left hand cracked like firecrackers. The great tendons of his arms twisted into a spiral, and the blood vessels under his skin bulged like green snakes coiling around a tree.

Deep within his sea of consciousness, a statue of a deity manifested. It had a face identical to Xu Yunfan’s, but its eyes were lowered like a clay statue in a temple.

Chaotic thoughts turned into black mist surging forward, only to be suppressed and dissolved by the deity’s hand seal of the Lin character. In the outside world, an instant passed, but in his sea of consciousness, three autumns had gone by. In the Lin state, there was the absolute control of "The Great Dao is devoid of emotion." The seven emotions and six desires all became puppets on his strings.

Muscle fibers boiled like volcanic magma. Blood beads oozing from his pores were evaporated into scarlet mist by the intense heat radiating from his body before they could hit the ground.

Xu Yunfan’s latissimus dorsi surged like a raging tide.

As the arc of the gilded mace swept out, the muscles all over his body contracted and condensed like a hundred rivers returning to the sea. The blood energy leaking from his pores spread over the Golden Skin and Jade Veins phenomenon, following the diamond-shaped patterns bulging on the surface.

The Lin state of the Three-Training Grand Perfection pushed his physical body to an unimaginable level. All his strength was rapidly squeezed out under the Lin state, exploding with power far exceeding the norm.

"A Divine Weapon?! Three-Training Grand Perfection?!"

Bao Yan’s heart and mind shook violently. He never imagined Xu Yunfan could pull out a Divine Weapon, nor that he was a Three-Training Warrior who had completed his transformation.

In an instant, all his calculations and schemes, his condescending attitude, were completely shattered by Xu Yunfan’s explosive blood energy unleashed by his secret technique and his desperate stance wielding the Divine Weapon.

*Boom!!*

As the air hummed, Bao Yan’s entangling silk net was torn to shreds by the wind of the mace.

Bao Yan threw out seven bone-piercing nails as he retreated violently. The gunpowder bags tied to the tails of the nails were ignited by the aura bursting from the gilded mace.

In the explosion's shockwave, the gilded mace was like an angry dragon leaving the sea!

Xu Yunfan stepped on the Chiwen beast on the eaves; the roof tiles shattered into dust under the immense force as he charged straight through the firelight.

In the golden arc of the gilded mace, the sixty-plus-jin mace felt as light as nothing.

Flames raced along the black gold threads. Bao Yan decisively abandoned the threads, trying to escape.

Xu Yunfan’s surging, powerful aura was like a Heavenly Art furnace, making Bao Yan’s heart tremble.

However, before the mace even arrived, the force generated by the heavy mace’s swing came crashing down like a mountain, leaving him almost no room to maneuver.

"Xu Yunfan!!!" Bao Yan roared, his hair and beard standing on end, his expression utterly manic.

The diamond-shaped muscles instantly shattered the玄甲 armor on his body. As he spread his hands wide and then brought them back together, the fallen swords shot back from all directions toward Xu Yunfan.

*Xuan亢 Dragon Mace, Ninth Power,亢 Dragon!*

Xu Yunfan let out a soft shout. The muscles of his waist and abdomen contracted and expanded like a surging tide under the force. He twisted his body, moving the Divine Weapon, the gilded mace, with him.

The nine layers of explosive force from the Xuan亢 Dragon Mace burst out through the gilded mace, generating a violent aura. The flying blades were twisted into spirals by the mace's aura.

The heavy mace’s momentum did not stop, trailing streaks of light like flowing golden lava. With the force of Mount Tai pressing down, the gilded mace, carrying the power of wind and thunder,劈落 (chop down).

The black gold threads Bao Yan hastily raised snapped one by one.

Facing Bao Yan’s desperate expression, Xu Yunfan’s face remained devoid of joy or sorrow. The heavy mace in his hand grew even heavier.

*Bang!*

Bao Yan’s entire body exploded. The golden flame spewing from the gilded mace burned him to nothingness.

*You have used the Xuan亢 Dragon Mace to kill a high-level enemy. You have领悟 (comprehended) the changes in its force application. Proficiency has increased significantly.*

*Your Xuan亢 Dragon Mace has reached Small Achievement.*

*...*

Glancing at the system prompts floating in his vision, Xu Yunfan quickly retracted the gilded mace and withdrew from the Lin state.

The battle came to an end.

Xu Yunfan’s fingernails turned purple-black due to burst capillaries. Purple-red bloodstains still appeared all over his body from the extreme depletion of his potential. He stumbled and sat on the ground, gasping for breath, letting the section of the Heavenly Art bridge beneath him continue to shift and change position.

Not to mention the power unleashed by the overload of his body, every time he used the Lin state, the emotional drop that followed made him feel the same lack of emotion as before, like a stone without a single ripple, leaving him with a feeling of emptiness.

He urgently needed to immerse himself in human presence to make up for it.

After a while, Xu Yunfan picked up the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer and got up. Staggering, he walked to the corridor bridge and looked down at the slaughter inside the Heavenly Art City.

Of the one thousand淬锋 (Quenching Edge) troops of the Heavenly Art Cave, nearly half were gone. The remaining troops, led by the experts of the various hall departments, were dividing into groups to kill the incense sect members inside the city, as well as... the Heavenly Art Cave disciples who had been blinded and hypnotized by the Bright Lord’s method of entering dreams through a vessel and could not wake up.

*Rumble!!*

As the Heavenly Art corridor bridge finished its reversal, under Xu Yunfan’s awestruck gaze, the entire牯牛 (Bull) Mountain began to tremble. The Azure Dragon winch had finally completed its reversal.

The metal shriek of the Azure Dragon winch reversing penetrated the mountain body. The entire Bull Mountain trembled as if a giant beast were turning over.
