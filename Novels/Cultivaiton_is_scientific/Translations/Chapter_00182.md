# Chapter 182: Jiang Chen

With the 'Nether Ghost Realm Formation'—a formation primarily constructed from the third-grade spiritual material 'Nether Crystal'—Li Shiming didn't need to search for a suitable place to refine corpses. The ghost domain environment provided by the formation reduced the material requirements for corpse refinement.

Even so, he still purchased second-grade materials for refining corpses. The main material he prepared for Li Yuanba was the corpse of Yun Xingyi, a Golden Core sword cultivator. His plan was for Li Yuanba to refine Yun Xingyi's corpse into his lifebound corpse—an idea he had long contemplated. 

Had Li Shiming not already used his sole lifebound corpse slot on Li Yuanba, he would have refined Yun Xingyi's corpse for himself. Even in death, Yun Xingyi's body possessed astonishing defensive capabilities. With the power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Shiming could barely cut through the skin using a third-grade sword foundation, and the process was excruciatingly slow—this despite Yun Xingyi's corpse lacking any spiritual energy after death. 

Once refined into a corpse puppet, its defensive capabilities would undoubtedly rank among the top-tier iron corpses. The skin was just the beginning; Yun Xingyi's muscles were even tougher, not to mention his bones. The bones of a Golden Core sword cultivator were nearly as hard as those of a Golden Core body-refining cultivator, a result of long-term exposure to sword intent. 

Although Yun Xingyi had only refined his right thumb into a "sword bone," his entire skeleton had been tempered by sword intent, continuously strengthening his bones over time. Even in death, the sword intent within his bones couldn't dissipate completely.

This time, Li Shiming dug out a cave dwelling himself while Li Yuanba set up a formation outside using formation flags. Inside, he prepared for the corpse refinement. His "Profound Nether Corpse Refinement Scripture" only covered refining corpses up to the Foundation Establishment stage, with the subsequent techniques missing—but this was sufficient for now.

The current advancement of corpse puppets relied mainly on the "Nether Ghost Realm Formation." The formation accelerated the refinement process significantly, at least until the Golden Core stage, far surpassing the methods described in the "Profound Nether Corpse Refinement Scripture." Once Li Yuanba officially joined the Netherworld Sect, obtaining a corpse refinement technique that extended to the Golden Core stage shouldn't be difficult.

True corpse refinement techniques were best found in demonic sects, as other sects often removed the more sinister aspects of such methods.

He hadn't expected to find lifebound corpse fluid available in shops. He still had some leftover, but it was only at the Qi Refining stage, insufficient for modifying the corpse of a Golden Core sword cultivator like Yun Xingyi. The lifebound corpse fluid he purchased this time was for iron corpses and of excellent quality—a true second-grade main material.

He extracted some blood from Li Yuanba and mixed it into the lifebound corpse fluid, combining it with various other materials. Yun Xingyi's corpse had been preserved exceptionally well, stored in an isolated environment that left it almost unchanged from the moment it was placed there.

The mixture of lifebound corpse fluid was carefully applied to the corpse's entire surface, with intricate patterns drawn on key areas. This method, derived from a corpse refinement secret technique obtained alongside the "Nether Ghost Realm Formation," was designed to enhance the refinement effects. He owed thanks to Ren Fei'er for allowing him to glimpse some Golden Core-level corpse refinement knowledge—though limited, it proved invaluable.

Yun Xingyi's corpse was placed within the "Nether Ghost Realm Formation." Under the influence of the ghost domain's yin-cold energy, the corpse quickly began to change. The skin turned bronze in color—a superficial transformation. Internally, within the hollowed shell, a corpse spirit was being born.

As the corpse spirit formed, the influence of the lifebound corpse fluid mixed with Li Yuanba's blood imbued it with Li Yuanba's aura. Li Yuanba sensed the birth of his lifebound corpse, feeling the gradual connection between his soul and the emerging corpse spirit.

The "Nether Ghost Realm Formation" compressed what would normally be a lengthy transformation process into just a few hours. The corpse spirit fully formed within four hours, but the corpse's transformation wasn't yet complete.

The bronze hue of the corpse's skin deepened, gradually shifting to an iron-black color. This was due to the second-grade lifebound corpse fluid and the corpse's inherent quality, allowing it to skip the copper corpse stage entirely and advance directly to the iron corpse stage under the formation's influence.

On the surface, corpse refinement seemed simple—a process that could grant a cultivator an iron corpse with Foundation Establishment combat power in a short time. But one had to consider the source of the corpse. Obtaining a Golden Core-level corpse, let alone a Foundation Establishment-level one, was extremely difficult.

Moreover, the corpse's original spiritual roots had to be taken into account. Otherwise, the corpse's potential would be limited, likely leaving it stuck at the copper corpse stage even after the cultivator themselves advanced to Foundation Establishment.

Corpse refinement also had a success rate—no matter how much preparation was made, failure was always a risk. Li Shiming's success this time was due to the second-grade refinement materials he had purchased, as well as the ghost domain environment created by the "Nether Ghost Realm Formation," which provided significant bonuses to the refinement process.

They remained at the site for three days, until the lifebound corpse's body reached its limit, with faint white light shimmering across its skin, marking the completion of the refinement.

Li Shiming even wondered—if he had possessed a complete Golden Core-level corpse refinement technique, could he have refined Yun Xingyi's corpse directly into a silver corpse? 

Of course, the likelihood was extremely low. The current refinement had nearly exhausted the corpse's potential. Further advancements would require massive amounts of refinement materials, and given this lifebound corpse's condition, the materials would need to be at least second-grade—possibly even higher.

The faint white light on the corpse's body was actually a silvery glow, a phenomenon that only appeared when an iron corpse reached its peak. Advancing further to a silver corpse would be far more difficult, with even the "Nether Ghost Realm Formation" offering limited assistance.

Yun Xingyi had been the strongest Golden Core sword cultivator of the Clear Heart Sect. Refining his corpse into a puppet would have instantly made Li Yuanba a prime target for the sect—had they not already retreated from the Northern Shu region.

To avoid causing major trouble for Li Yuanba, Li Shiming stored the lifebound corpse in his machine room space and performed cosmetic surgery to alter its facial features. However, he found that he could no longer cut the corpse's bones—even with a third-grade sword foundation, they were now impervious.

The refinement process transformed the corpse into a zombie, strengthening it in the process. Once refined, the corpse naturally generated yin-cold spiritual energy, which continuously enhanced its entire body. Over three days within the formation, Yun Xingyi's corpse absorbed vast amounts of yin-cold energy, undergoing constant modification and reinforcement.

The third-grade sword foundation was made from third-grade materials, but Li Shiming had only recently begun practicing the Foundation Establishment chapter of the "Sword Demon Secret Codex." In essence, it was still a spiritual artifact crafted from third-grade materials. Unless he advanced to Golden Core and mastered the corresponding chapter, the sword foundation wouldn't attain the power of a true magic treasure.

Left with no other choice, Li Shiming opted for augmentation. Fortunately, during refinement, the corpse's teeth had mutated, growing a pair of fangs, and its eyes had turned crimson. To prevent Yun Xingyi's acquaintances from recognizing him, Li Shiming added extra bone structures to alter the original facial features. These bones were sourced from other corpses—while inferior in quality, they had negligible impact on the lifebound corpse's overall strength.

Once everything was done, Li Shiming examined the lifebound corpse before him, feeling an oppressive aura emanating from it. Its terrifying appearance and peak iron corpse aura left no doubt that this was a true monster.

What was even more frightening was when Li Shiming tested the corpse's attack power using a spiritual artifact shield. To his shock, the corpse's claw strike carried traces of sword intent, instantly shattering the shield's spiritual imprint. The backlash left Li Shiming vomiting blood, his head splitting with pain. Fortunately, the lifebound corpse was under control and didn't follow up with further attacks.

Comparing his own Nezha to Li Yuanba's lifebound corpse, Li Shiming couldn't help but sigh at the difference. Of course, Nezha had great potential—being a corpse refined from a Heaven spiritual root. Though currently only at the early iron corpse stage, its three heads and six arms, combined with its growth rate, suggested future strength on par with Li Yuanba's lifebound corpse. The latter simply had a higher starting point, given its Golden Core sword cultivator origins.

"Let's call it 'Jiang Chen'—the king among iron corpses," Li Shiming decided after some thought. He then rummaged through his machine room space and found a corpse storage pouch to hand over. 

Since Li Shiming had his machine room space, this pouch was an old looted item. It was almost an insult to house a peak iron corpse like Jiang Chen in such a low-quality pouch. He resolved to replace it with a spiritual artifact-grade version when the opportunity arose.

Li Yuanba attached the pouch to his waist and stored Jiang Chen inside. With this new formidable combat asset, Li Shiming felt significantly safer.

"Let's go explore the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's ruins together!" he said, standing up with a smile.

"Let's go, fellow Daoist!" Li Yuanba replied cheerfully.

After collecting the formation flags and erasing their traces, the two took to the skies on sword glows, their sword遁 techniques carrying them into the distance.

Li Shiming now used the sword遁 technique from the "Ten Directions Sword Art." With his sword intent, his speed was only slightly slower than Li Yuanba's. He could easily pass as a sword cultivator—few ordinary cultivators would be able to tell the difference.

However, his fastest movement technique wasn't sword遁 but the lightning遁 technique from the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art." The problem was the immense spiritual energy consumption. His reserves were insufficient for prolonged lightning遁 travel, making sword遁 the more practical choice.

After several days of travel, both he and Li Yuanba slowed their flight. They were nearing the danger zone marked on the map and needed to be wary of spirit beasts.

The terrain grew increasingly familiar. He soon recognized landmarks matching those on the "Earth-Sound Annihilation Zither" map—they were close to the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's ruins. Fortunately, the ruins weren't located deep within the danger zone, which would have made exploration far riskier.

Li Shiming and Li Yuanba moved swiftly through the mountainous terrain, stopping before a dense thicket of low trees.

"There's an extremely faint formation fluctuation—a very peculiar one," Li Shiming murmured. His spiritual sense extended outward, detecting spatial distortions caused by a formation unlike any he had encountered before.

The low trees were real to the touch—branches could even be broken off. Yet within this space coexisted another realm, an esoteric formation that didn't interfere with the physical trees but existed alongside them.

This realization humbled Li Shiming. The world of cultivation held vast knowledge beyond his current understanding. Only by continually improving his strength would he gain access to such advanced secrets.

After a moment's thought, he retrieved a drone—a modified one with an attached package beneath it. He performed the entry hand seals toward the thicket, causing the trees to shimmer illusionarily and reveal a stone passageway leading inward.

The drone flew into the passage as Li Shiming donned a visor, syncing with its visual feed. The ruins were ancient, with stone surfaces bearing marks of time.

About ten meters in, the passage opened into a main hall. A set of table and chairs stood within, shimmering with spiritual light. Despite the years, it was clear they were crafted from spiritual materials—second-grade, by estimation. 

The mere fact that second-grade materials had been used for furniture spoke volumes about the extravagance of the ruins' owner. Li Shiming's heart raced at the sight.

On the table sat a Go board with two boxes of black and white stones. Their spiritual light was restrained, indicating even higher-grade materials.

"Could these be magic treasures?" Li Shiming's heartbeat quickened. He nearly rushed inside to inspect the board and pieces up close but restrained himself. If such treasures were openly displayed in the hall, what lay deeper within?

Over the past days, he had gathered some information about the Six-Fingered Sound Demon. The demon had vanished over four hundred years ago, last known as a late Golden Core cultivator with significant influence in the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon was notorious for his cruelty, delighting in massacres with his zither's deadly melodies—a true demonic cultivator. After killing a true disciple of the Netherworld Sect, he was hunted down and severely injured before disappearing entirely.

Rumors suggested that, anticipating his demise, the demon had left numerous clues during his flight, hoping someone would inherit his legacy. Such tales were common in the cultivation world—almost every missing cultivator had similar legends attached to them. Few took them seriously.

Only those who had seen the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's clues firsthand would believe in the existence of his ruins.
