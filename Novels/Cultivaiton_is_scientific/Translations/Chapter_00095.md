# Chapter 95: Reunion

Yin Shilan thoughtfully piloted her flying boat, her mind wandering back to Li Shiming whom she'd encountered that morning and the lost array design sketches. 

Naturally quiet and reserved, she preferred solitude and dedicated her days to studying arrays. Today's unusual encounter—her uncharacteristic moment of vulnerability witnessed by a stranger—had left her flustered. Using her privileges, she'd looked up Li Shiming's information and committed it to memory. 

Even after completing her tasks, as she passed near the waters where they'd met, thoughts of Li Shiming resurfaced. 

At that moment, her flying boat's detection array spotted Li Shiming riding his paper crane in the distance—a sight simultaneously relayed to Yin Shilan through her mental connection with the array.

"What a coincidence," she murmured, observing Li Shiming through the array. Her clear eyes sparkled as she recalled his kindness in sheltering her from the rain that morning. 

Having regained her composure after hours of reflection, she now recognized her earlier rudeness. Li Shiming had protected her from the downpour to preserve her meditative state, yet she'd departed without a word of thanks. The impropriety weighed on her conscience.

Had their paths not crossed again, the matter might have been forgotten. But fate had brought them together once more, compelling her to apologize for her earlier behavior.

Only when Yin Shilan's flying boat came within visible range did Li Shiming notice its approach. This wasn't due to any deficiency in his coordination with IBMz15, but rather because Yin Shilan's vessel possessed superior detection arrays that far exceeded the range of IBMz15's sensory processing through Li Shiming's five senses.

Startled at first by the approaching vessel, Li Shiming recognized it after IBMz15 magnified the image. He slowed his paper crane and hovered in place, awaiting the flying boat's approach.

"The owner must be coming to reclaim those array designs," he speculated about Yin Shilan's purpose.

As the flying boat drew alongside, Li Shiming once again beheld Yin Shilan standing on its deck. Her dazzling beauty struck him with the same intensity as before.

"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Yin," Li Shiming bowed respectfully.

"Is Fellow Daoist Li returning to Eagle Beak Island?" Yin Shilan returned the greeting with a slight curtsy.

Both froze momentarily at the question. 

Li Shiming wondered how she knew his surname and the location of his cave dwelling—they hadn't even exchanged names before she'd departed that morning.

A faint blush colored Yin Shilan's cheeks. Known among elders for her exceptional intelligence, she couldn't believe she'd made such a blunder upon first meeting.

This time, however, she resisted the urge to flee. Instead, she broke the awkward silence with an invitation: "Would Fellow Daoist Li care to board my flying boat? I'm returning to the sect and it's along the way."

"Then I gratefully accept your kind offer," Li Shiming replied, seeing this as an opportunity to return the array designs while also satisfying his curiosity about the differences between single and multi-passenger flying boats—he'd been contemplating acquiring one for himself.

After parking his paper crane on the deck and storing it away, Li Shiming followed Yin Shilan inside, where the cabin's interior left him astonished.

Not by its luxurious furnishings—though the white fur carpet emitting spiritual energy (likely made from some spirit beast's pelt) was certainly impressive underfoot, nor by the spirit stone-powered array lamp overhead (a device he'd long wanted to study but found unavailable even in Changming Island's markets). 

What truly amazed him was the spatial distortion. From outside, the cabin appeared no larger than ten square meters, yet inside it spanned a hundred.

"Please have a seat, Fellow Daoist Li," Yin Shilan gestured gracefully, using the motion of retrieving items from a nearby cabinet to hide her own confusion at having invited him aboard. No man had ever entered her flying boat before—today she'd broken multiple personal precedents.

Had she not verified Li Shiming's background and sensed his mere third-level Qi Refining cultivation, she might have suspected him of practicing some mind-influencing technique.

She prepared tea in an exquisite cup and placed it on the low table before Li Shiming. Though he cultivated spirit tea plants himself (still in recovery), he'd only tasted spirit tea once before at Guardian Gu Jia's residence in Zhongdu.

The aroma alone told him this was exceptionally precious tea—just inhaling its fragrance made his spiritual energy vortex spin faster.

The jade cup felt cool to the touch despite the hot liquid within, clearly a high-grade spiritual artifact. When he drank, the tea's energy exploded within him, circulating through his body and noticeably enhancing his constitution while pushing his cultivation to the brink of the fourth level of Qi Refining.

"What kind of supreme spirit tea is this?" Li Shiming marveled internally, its effects dwarfing Gu Jia's offering by leagues.

Meanwhile, Yin Shilan wondered at her own behavior—why had she used her treasured Glazed Yuan Gathering Cup for a stranger? Yet she felt no resistance to sharing this precious item with Li Shiming, as if it were the most natural thing.

As Li Shiming savored the tea's effects and Yin Shilan pondered her unusual actions, a comfortable silence settled between them.

"Fellow Daoist Yin, I nearly forgot to return your lost property," Li Shiming finally said, producing the array designs. He assumed the exquisite tea was her indirect way of requesting their return.

"I no longer need those—I've memorized the array," Yin Shilan replied without taking the papers. Seeing him handle her designs with respect actually improved her opinion of him—this was her proudest creation, representing years of study.

"Does Fellow Daoist Li study arrays? I'd welcome your critique of any flaws in the design," she asked, immediately regretting the question when she remembered his profile listed him as a spiritual farmer.

Quickly correcting herself, she added, "If you're interested in arrays, I have an introductory manual from outside our sect," producing a purple jade slip.

Li Shiming's heart raced. Array studies were notoriously difficult to access—the cheapest sect offering cost over a thousand merit points. He'd planned to wait years before affording such knowledge.

Though pride urged him to refuse, practicality won out. Accepting the slip, he pressed it to his forehead and was immediately inundated with an overwhelming flood of three-dimensional array patterns and complex energy node connections.

Unbeknownst to him, Yin Shilan had set this as a test. The jade slip contained a renowned array master's legacy—a gift from her father. If Li Shiming could comprehend it, they'd share a common interest. If not, she'd compensate him otherwise but likely never see him again.

After ten minutes of intense absorption aided by IBMz15, Li Shiming opened his eyes with newfound understanding. Retrieving his Spirit Turtle Shield, he examined it through fresh eyes—the natural cracks on the turtle shell forming innate array patterns.

"This land turtle shell makes decent array material, though it's a pity it was made into a defensive artifact," Yin Shilan observed, pleased to see his quick comprehension.

"Land turtle?" Li Shiming blurted out, having always assumed it came from a sea turtle.

Yin Shilan couldn't suppress a laugh at the island-dwelling cultivator's inability to distinguish turtle types. "The difference isn't substantial," she explained after hearing how he'd been misled in the purchase. "Sea turtle shields just perform slightly better in marine environments."

Dismissing the minor deception, Li Shiming began sketching the shell's patterns on paper. As they grew absorbed in the designs, neither noticed how close they'd drawn—well within the personal space that cultivators typically maintain around strangers.
