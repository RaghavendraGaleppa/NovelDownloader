# Chapter 708: Hesitation?

The strange tree had no leaves, only bare, twisted branches. At the end of these branches hung a fist-sized, peculiar fruit radiating a soft, cold light.

The fruit resembled a coiled dragon, its surface covered with fine patterns like dragon scales. Inside, it seemed as if deep moonlight was slowly flowing, emanating a profound Yin and coldness, yet also containing a vast Dao rhythm of endless vitality.

Just by looking at it from afar, Xu Yunfan felt his Shenxiao Golden Core tremble slightly, producing a strong desire and resonance.

The Taiyin Mingqiu Dao Fruit!

The goal he had been desperately seeking was right before his eyes.

He hadn't expected this Dao Fruit to be materialized so blatantly by this Qiu Dragon.

Xu Yunfan shifted his gaze to the coiling giant dragon, his expression slightly serious.

Wukong said, "You aren't thinking of plucking the Dao Fruit from this demonic dragon, are you? How is that any different from robbing a Golden Core True Lord of their Dao Fruit?!"

Xu Yunfan replied calmly.

"Indeed."

The fact that this Dao Fruit was displayed so openly, rather than being integrated into this Qiu Dragon's cave heaven, undoubtedly indicated that this giant dragon was evolved from the Taiyin Qiu Dragon Dao Fruit. It was naturally ownerless.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but look towards the Netherworld in the distance of the Blood Sea, and that majestic, vast Netherworld Palace larger than stars.

Although the Samsara Sea of Suffering had Dao Fruits, it lacked True Lords. Especially the master of this Netherworld Palace, no one had yet claimed it.

Just as Xu Yunfan was pondering, a terrifying aura, far more vicious than the sword intent of the Tongxuan True Lord, the诡异 of the White-Haired True Lord, and the Heavenly Punishment lightning of the Sea of Suffering, slowly awakened from the depths of that massive Bone Island.

The calm Blood Sea around the Bone Island began to boil violently, forming a bottomless, massive vortex.

In the center of the vortex, two crimson lights, like blood moons, suddenly lit up in the deep darkness.

A will full of brutality and destruction instantly locked onto the living being who had intruded into this territory.

The Qiu Dragon of the Sea of Suffering.

A terrifying existence coexisting with the Taiyin Mingqiu Dao Fruit.

Awakened now by the interplay of three auras.

Ahead was the peerless fierce beast guarding the Dao Fruit; behind was the Tongxuan True Lord with boiling killing intent; and further away, the White-Haired True Lord, watching like a tiger, with诡异 methods.

The clone, Wukong, seemed to have fallen into an unprecedented deadly trap.

Tongxuan True Lord laughed long and loud. "Xu Yunfan, it seems you cannot escape."

The White-Haired True Lord didn't hide his greed in the slightest. "Your Dao Fruit is very suitable for me."

After realizing they were after the same target, these two became particularly tacitly understood.

Wukong—or rather, Xu Yunfan controlling Wukong—had a calm expression. Hearing their words, he showed no worry, instead revealing a hint of a smile.

Simultaneously, at the peak of Shenxiao Mountain.

The main body of Xu Yunfan, seated cross-legged on a cloud platform, suddenly twitched his brow.

A vast, powerful divine sense, like an invisible net, silently enveloped the entire Shenxiao Mountain.

This divine sense had no offensive intent, yet it made Xu Yunfan's heart tighten slightly. It was the current leader of the Primordial Origin Sect, the Pudu True Lord.

"Xu Shidi..."

Pudu True Lord's calm, ancient voice sounded directly by Xu Yunfan's ear.

"I didn't expect to have misjudged. Even I can't tell true from false in that clone; it's truly novel. Is the Sea of Suffering fun?

Your move has truly stirred the whole situation. The Tongxuan of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and some other hidden figures can't resist entering the fray.

It seems the fish you're fishing are even bigger than imagined. However, be careful not to catch the fish, but instead get dragged into the Sea of Suffering, doomed for eternity."

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled. He knew Pudu True Lord had been watching all along and was finally speaking now.

He forcefully suppressed the mental fluctuations brought about by the fierce battle in the Sea of Suffering and the awakening of the Qiu Dragon, stabilizing his divine sense to respond.

"Thank you for your concern, Pudu Shixiong. Fishing naturally carries risks, but if the bait is fragrant enough, there will always be a harvest. I wonder if Shixiong's message now is to advise me to call it off, or is there another meaning?"

While he was sparring with Pudu True Lord, he devoted most of his attention to the Sea of Suffering.

On Chenghua Mountain, the Eight Trigrams Dao Platform flowed ceaselessly. Pudu True Lord sat in the center.

The clear radiance and the flickering trigrams on his gray-white Dao robe reflected a dazzling purple-gold trajectory deep within the Sea of Suffering.

He raised his eyes to look in the direction of Shenxiao Peak, his words filled with compassion.

"Shidi, it has been less than a hundred years since you attained the Golden Core. To forcefully enter the Sea of Suffering to seek the Taiyin Dao Fruit is too fast."

Xu Yunfan's clone sat cross-legged atop Shenxiao Peak. Thunder patterns flickered faintly within his sleeves.

"What does Shixiong mean?"

"Hesitation is best."

Pudu True Lord said slowly, "The Tongxuan of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect has already cut his own cultivation to enter the Sea of Suffering. The Bodhisattva Pure Land has also made its move.

If you succeed, the True Lords of the three sects will surely join forces to attack the Primordial Origin Sect. Even I won't be able to protect you then."

The divine sense transmission echoed in the void. Xu Yunfan lowered his head to hide the cold light in his eyes.

Pudu's mention of the three sects acting naturally included the Primordial Origin Sect itself.

The position of mid-stage Golden Core in the Primordial Origin Sect only allows for one supreme master.

How could this True Lord, who had governed the sect for ten thousand years, tolerate a later comer sharing power?

After pondering for a long time, Xu Yunfan finally suppressed the agitation in his heart.

"Shidi will heed Shixiong's teachings."

Pudu True Lord's compassionate voice rang out again.

"Your attainment of the Golden Core with a single lifetime is due to the favor of the sect's fortune. However, the path of the Dao is like climbing a ladder; greed for speed leads to easy breakage."

"The White-Haired True Lord is a traitor from ten thousand years ago. Tongxuan has burned his Sword Soul to fight to the death. Moreover, the Qiu Dragon of the Sea of Suffering lies in ambush. This situation is a dead end with no escape!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly looked up. "What if I am not alone in this game?"

A flash of brilliance passed through Pudu's eyes.

"The art of wielding treasures through a clone is indeed exquisite."

"However, the Sea of Suffering isolates all laws. Even the power of a spiritual treasure is less than thirty percent of the main body's."

He had long seen through the reality of the Wukong clone, but he didn't know that the Star Spirit Banner could borrow the power of the main body's Dao Fruit, nor did he know that Xu Yunfan possessed the Attribute Panel, allowing him to output at full power.

Naturally, Xu Yunfan wouldn't reveal these things.

Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, Pudu True Lord's voice turned cold and heavy.

"Qingyuan was once as arrogant as you, but now he has met his end, his body dead and his Dao vanished."

"The Primordial Origin Sect cannot afford the loss of a second True Lord!"

"Shixiong's painstaking efforts, Yunfan will remember them."

Xu Yunfan bowed slightly.

Before Pudu True Lord dissipated into a gentle breeze, he left behind one last remark.

"There's no need to go to the Netherworld to obtain the Taiyin Dao Fruit. There are such fruits in this world as well. When the time is ripe, Shixiong will get it for you."

"..."

"Hesitation? By the time I return with the Taiyin Dao Fruit, it will be time for this Chenghua Mountain to change masters!"

His heart turned cold. He naturally understood that Pudu True Lord was telling him that there only needs to be one True Lord at the mid-stage of the Golden Core in the Primordial Origin Sect. If there were to be another, would he still be able to remain the leader?

Xu Yunfan rubbed his brow. If only there weren't so many despicable people in this world, things would be so much cleaner.

He only wanted to seek the path of longevity, to see what the pinnacle of the path to immortality looks like, and to prove the Dao of the Nascent Soul. Why must so many people jump out to shout and kill at every step forward?

But how could this make Xu Yunfan retreat? After all, Pudu True Lord didn't know that Xu Yunfan could transfer spiritual power, outputting at his full power. He merely thought a clone had been sent.
