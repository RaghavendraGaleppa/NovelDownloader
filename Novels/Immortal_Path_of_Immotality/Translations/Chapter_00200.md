**Chapter 198: Ambush at the Heavenly Pit**  

Over the next half-month, undercurrents surged within Moonview Immortal City.  

The Lin Clan Trading House faced targeted attacks from unknown forces, suffering suppression across every aspect of their operations—distribution, processing, inspections, regulation, and sales.  

Large quantities of their spiritual seafood products piled up in warehouses, unsold. All partner merchants canceled their orders. The trading house's staff were repeatedly warned or even detained by the city's law enforcement cultivators. Their business license was temporarily revoked, with demands for rectification before they could resume operations.  

Lin Shan finally witnessed the influence of the Dai Clan, a prominent cultivation family in Moonview City. As mining magnates, their reach extended into every corner, capable of obstructing him even across industries.  

Moreover, as the hidden mastermind behind the trading house, his own residence had been uncovered. The Dai Clan made no effort to conceal their surveillance—multiple groups monitored him day and night.  

The rule prohibiting open conflict within Moonview City remained intact, and the Dai Clan's Golden Core elder had no intention of breaking it. Unlike the previous incident where the Li Clan's patriarch was ambushed, this was a personal matter. Lin Shan bore the brunt alone, but he knew solutions would emerge.  

According to the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, an inside source among the city's administrators revealed that in another half-month, they would be forcibly expelled by the city's Internal Affairs Bureau. Once outside the city, a deadly ambush awaited them.  

Lin Shan recognized the dire situation. The Dai Clan's Golden Core elder was methodically setting the stage. If he followed their script, he would be trapped in a passive position.  

As long as they stayed within the city, their lives were safe under its no-conflict rule. But once outside, the Dai Clan would strike without restraint. With their extensive network across the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world and a Golden Core elder leading the hunt, escape would be impossible.  

They would kill him, seize the trading house's deed and tokens, then return to the city and swallow his assets whole.  

"What do we do now? Staying is waiting for death. Do we abandon everything and flee, swallowing our losses?"  

Lin Shan paced the courtyard, discussing with the Black Skeleton Demon Lord. The Lin Clan Trading House represented an investment of over 200,000 spirit stones—losing it would be a bitter pill to swallow.  

Moreover, he still held the "supply channels" for spiritual seafood that the Dai Clan coveted. As long as they remained in his hands, the Dai Clan's Golden Core elder would never relent, scouring every corner of the Lu Kingdom to find him. There would be no peace unless they left the kingdom entirely, beyond the Dai Clan's reach.  

But if they fled now, it wouldn't be difficult for Lin Shan. With 74 units of Ancient Charm, he could enhance a "Wind Escape Talisman" into a minor divine ability talisman, ensuring escape if not victory.  

With this safety net, he wasn't overly panicked.  

However, he had originally planned to save the Ancient Charm for his breakthrough to the Golden Core realm. After all, cultivation was the foundation of everything. External aids were only for emergencies.  

He had only been in the Lu Kingdom for a little over a decade, comfortably cultivating in peace. His original plan was to reach the peak of late Foundation Establishment before venturing out.  

But upon reflection, breaking through now wouldn't significantly boost his combat power. The difference between late Foundation Establishment and its peak was negligible in terms of battle prowess.  

Yet, the Lin Clan Trading House was a massive asset...  

Lin Shan's "wealth over life" instincts surfaced. Over the past half-month, he had pondered solutions, but the Dai Clan's deep roots as a mining giant made them an immovable force.  

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, whose true form was a Nascent Soul-level entity, had long restored this avatar to late Foundation Establishment. It showed no fear and instead posed a question:  

"Brother, do you remember what I told you when we passed through the Silver River Market in Huainan, back in the Great Song Dynasty?"  

Lin Shan was momentarily caught off guard.  

"What are you referring to...?"  

"My stay in this realm has a time limit. If I don't restore my cultivation to the Golden Core realm within thirty years to extend my stay, my true form in the Hell World will forcibly recall me."  

"Ah! I almost forgot!"  

Lin Shan slapped his forehead. After the Yellow Immortal Master gave him the contract golden scroll and he re-signed the pact with the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, he had relaxed, thinking it couldn't betray him before reaching Nascent Soul.  

Now, counting the years since their passage through the Silver River Market, nearly twenty-seven years had passed!  

If the Black Skeleton Demon Lord didn't break through to Golden Core within three years, Lin Shan would lose a powerful ally.  

And because the demon lord coveted Lin Shan's innate spiritual treasure, it wasn't eager to leave either. Thus, both harbored ulterior motives, neither willing to part ways yet.  

"You're already at late Foundation Establishment, and you have the Demon Taro Fruit. The only thing missing is..."  

"A corpse of a Golden Core cultivator, deceased for no more than three months!"  

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord eagerly finished the sentence. But Lin Shan immediately realized—  

No!  

At this critical juncture, just as the demon lord was nearing recall, a Golden Core cultivator suddenly targeted them. Was this mere coincidence?  

Seeing the conversation progressing, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord rubbed its skeletal hands and unveiled its plan:  

"I think we shouldn't rush to flee. Instead, we can set a trap and strike first—eliminate the Dai Clan's Golden Core elder."  

"I fucking knew it!"  

Lin Shan slammed the stone table and pointed accusingly at the demon lord.  

"You deliberately exposed our wealth to lure them, didn't you? You wanted the Dai Clan's Golden Core elder to see us as fat sheep, baiting him into attacking so you could achieve your goal!"  

Though he had been secluded in cultivation, piecing together the clues, he quickly deduced the truth.  

The Lin Clan Trading House had grown, but attracting the attention of major cultivation factions would take decades more—only after monopolizing Moonview City's market and expanding to other cities would they qualify.  

Yet, after just over a decade in the city, they had barely made a mark in the spiritual seafood trade. How could they draw the Dai Clan's attention?  

And a mining giant, no less!  

Why would a mining-focused clan care about a rising seafood business? Unless...  

This Dai Clan Golden Core elder had been "selected" after years of research by the skeleton demon.  

No wonder Lin Shan, who had kept a low profile for over a decade, was suddenly targeted. There was a traitor in his midst!  

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord scratched the back of its skull awkwardly.  

"Brother, I've been in this realm for twenty-seven years. With less than three years left, restoring my Golden Core cultivation is urgent. I had no choice."  

It added, fearing Lin Shan would question its motives:  

"This Dai Clan elder is a recent breakthrough, lacking deep roots or resources within his clan. He urgently needs to acquire cultivation assets to expand his influence.  

"When he was assigned to Moonview City, he learned of our trading house and saw its potential to fund his ambitions. He wanted to buy us out, but I refused. That's why he resorted to force."  

It concluded, "If I restore my Golden Core cultivation, not only can I stay, but you'll also gain a powerful ally, making your travels safer."  

Lin Shan scoffed but didn't press further. The feud was already set. The Dai Clan elder had taken the bait, proving his greed.  

But the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's unilateral actions infuriated Lin Shan. Though bound by the contract not to harm him, its willingness to provoke a Golden Core cultivator suggested confidence—or desperation.  

After this crisis, Lin Shan resolved to sever ties once he reached Golden Core. The demon lord would become a tool, sent to gather Ancient Charm elsewhere.  

This ticking time bomb couldn't stay. Trust was a luxury—he only trusted himself.  

But for now, he had to deal with the Dai Clan elder.  

Golden Core cultivators' spiritual sense and attack range exceeded a mile, five times that of Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

If your spiritual sense barely reached a hundred meters, your opponent could already strike from five hundred meters away—leaving no time to react or counter.  

A direct confrontation meant certain death.  

But Lin Shan knew the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had a plan. Otherwise, it wouldn't risk its avatar and true form under the contract's backlash.  

After pacing the courtyard, Lin Shan asked, "How confident are you?"  

The demon lord assured him, "Don't worry. Over the years, I've gathered materials and enough Illusion Spirit Wood to set up a grand illusion array, weakening him by thirty percent."  

"Only thirty?"  

"I also found a Heavenly Pit of Absolute Malice three thousand miles west of Moonview City. We can use the terrain to set up a lethal array, suppressing another thirty percent of his power."  

"So, with both arrays, he'll only have forty percent of his strength left..."  

Lin Shan relaxed slightly. With layered arrays and terrain advantages, he assessed his own trump cards, calculating the odds.  

"What's his exact cultivation?"  

"Early Golden Core."  

After finalizing the details, they deemed their chances favorable. That night, they stealthily left Moonview City, racing northwest.  

The next day, the Dai Clan elder learned of their escape and gave chase.  

Lin Shan spared no expense, using Wind Escape Talismans repeatedly.  

But after over a dozen uses, the talisman in his hand suddenly grew scorching hot.  

He stopped immediately—one more use, and it would combust.  

Its lifespan was nearly spent.  

He sighed. The Wind Escape Talisman had served him well in Foundation Establishment, but against Golden Core opponents, it was inadequate.  

Unless enhanced into a minor divine ability talisman, it was no longer worth the Ancient Charm.  

Prioritizing his Golden Core breakthrough was wiser.  

They reached the Heavenly Pit of Absolute Malice in a night, thanks to the talismans.  

The Dai Clan elder, traveling at five hundred miles per hour, would arrive in three hours.  

Time was tight.  

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord busily prepared the arrays while Lin Shan contributed the Void Star Disk.  

The hundred-mile-wide Heavenly Pit was shrouded in gloom, with dark mist spewing from countless holes in the ground.  

The Void Star Disk could survey and manipulate ley lines, aiding array formation. Its spirit, Little Xin, emerged to assist, elevating the setup to grandmaster level.  

Two hours later, the arrays were ready:  

**[Illusion Spirit Maze Array]**: A labyrinth of illusionary forests, disorienting and trapping intruders.  

**[Five Ghosts Malice Array]**: Summoning five near-Golden Core ghost generals from the pit's malice. Though rebellious, the Void Star Disk suppressed them, ensuring obedience and replenishing their power.  

Each array could suppress thirty percent of the enemy's strength.  

With preparations complete, they awaited the Dai Clan elder.
