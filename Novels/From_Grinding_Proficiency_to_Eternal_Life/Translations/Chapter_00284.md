# Chapter 284: Dao Sect's Chief Disciple, Chu Cangming

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists in salute and said loudly, "Greetings, Senior Brother Chu! I have long heard of the 'Blue Sky Sword Soul,' and seeing you today, your presence is indeed extraordinary!"

Chu Cangming's expression was indifferent, like a stagnant ancient well without ripples.

As the mountain wind swept past, several strands of hair at his temples actually emitted a metallic cold light.

In a flash, his gaze, sharp as a sword's edge, swept over the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane behind Xu Yunfan.

Under the牵引 of the aura, the dark patterns on the cane's body actually lit up three profound patterns on their own, causing the surrounding fallen leaves to spin without wind.

"Does Junior Brother Xu wish to go to the Langhuan Book Tower?"

His voice was like jade falling into a cold pool; every syllable carried the unique "Marrow Fire Tremor" of the Marrow Transformation Realm.

Before the words had fully faded, the external manifestation of the Marrow Sea's vigorous energy caused the phenomenon of "Gold Sound and Jade Vibration," outlining subtle ripple trajectories in the air. It even caused the dust in the gaps of the bluestone slabs within three zhang to suddenly suspend.

Xu Yunfan's expression did not change in the slightest; his eyes even held a hint of eagerness.

He had heard of Chu Cangming's name many times: the Chief True Disciple of the Dao Sect, slaying demons and monsters, breaking through bandits, saving hundreds of cities...

The various positive titles were truly countless.

He remained polite and said, "That's right. I am currently lacking a cane technique and wanted to go to the Langhuan Book Tower to take a look."

Chu Cangming pondered for a moment, his sleeve lightly brushing aside the gradually rising clouds and mist. "There are elders guarding the Langhuan Book Tower. Without a True Disciple Token, you cannot take a single step..."

He looked Xu Yunfan up and down, noticing that there was no True Disciple Token hanging at his waist.

"You haven't obtained a True Disciple Token yet. I'll take you there."

Before the words finished, he had already stepped into the air. His blue robe surged like waves in a sea of clouds, clearly the movement technique "Stepping on the Dipper" from the *Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock*.

Xu Yunfan's gaze sharpened. The records regarding "Stepping on the Dipper" from the *Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock* immediately surfaced in his mind. Having obtained the first few volumes of the *Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock*, Xu Yunfan naturally recognized the technique's methods.

This lightness technique is based on the Big Dipper. Every step taken secretly aligns with the changes in the stellar positions of the Celestial Pivot, Celestial Rotation, and others. Practitioners must reach the Muscle Refining Realm to practice it. The Yongquan acupoint at the soles of the feet erupts with spiral energy, bursting from the arch of the foot to condense a "Qi Mass."

Currently, the phenomenon of surging clouds and waves caused by Chu Cangming's blue robe is actually the "Locking Pulse Gale" formed by the external manifestation of the Marrow Sea's vigorous energy. If an ordinary martial artist were swept by this gale, their meridians would immediately stagnate, having the effect of slowing the enemy's attack, much like a debuff.

Xu Yunfan noticed that with every step the other took, three strands of golden light erupted from the heel. This is precisely what the technique's essentials describe: "Three steps one lock, seven steps one gale." Legend has it that upon reaching perfection, one can tread forty-nine steps in the air without falling, with every seven steps adding a layer of strength.

Xu Yunfan was just about to decline, intending to say he had the Profound Command, when he saw Chu Cangming execute this movement technique without a word and turn to rush into the sea of clouds. He had no choice but to close his mouth and follow closely behind.

Halfway there, Chu Cangming suddenly spoke. "Three days ago, I was at Yanmen Pass and slew seventeen of the Great乾's True Blood nobles."

His voice was cold like a quenched sword edge, making one's skin involuntarily break out in goosebumps.

"I only returned to the mountain to learn that the Master has taken in a new disciple."

He did not stop his steps, but the Cold Dragon Sword at his waist, still sheathed, emitted a clear and melodious hum. "So... I came specifically to see. The Master hasn't taken a True Disciple in decades; to take one in silently now naturally makes me very curious."

As the final syllable fell, Chu Cangming suddenly turned around. The pressure of a Marrow Transformation Realm peak expert surged like a tide. The scales on Xu Yunfan's Dragon Scale Armor instantly emerged with the patterns of the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength, and the bluestone slab beneath his feet cracked with a "click," spreading spiderweb-like fissures.

"However..."

Chu Cangming's slender fingers casually rested on the sword hilt. "It seems..."

His gaze carried a hint of scrutiny, his expression showing obvious doubt.

"...there is nothing particularly special about you."

Xu Yunfan laughed silently. Did he need to say what made him special?

He raised his eyes and looked around. As the thick clouds and mist dispersed, he found the two of them standing on a cloud bridge between two steep peaks.

Twelve chains as thick as arms spanned the void, emitting a dim blue cold light in the slanting sun.

Heavy iron birch planks were laid between the chains. Although they had weathered a hundred years of wind and frost, they had not decayed in the slightest. Now, they rhythmically rose and fell with the mountain wind, making a grating "creaking" sound.

Below the bridge was a ten-thousand-zhang abyss. The surging sea of clouds was torn into floc by the gale. On the occasional exposed cliff faces, one could see the grooves left by the sword tests of Dao Sect experts from past generations.

The iron birch planks, torn by the gale, emitted a piercing "creaking" sound. The entire plank tilted thirty degrees suddenly around the central rivet, revealing the surging sea of clouds below.

The scales of Xu Yunfan's Dragon Scale Armor reacted, glowing with red light. He secretly channeled strength into his soles to stabilize his figure.

Chu Cangming's blue robe fluttered loudly, but he stood as if walking on level ground at the edge of the swaying plank. The fierce wind blew his clothes and sleeves, causing them to fly.

"Cross this bridge, and we will arrive at the Langhuan Book Tower," he said, his gaze sweeping over the scabbard at Xu Yunfan's waist. "Does Junior Brother Xu also understand the sword?"

"Actually, not really."

Xu Yunfan patted the long sword at his waist. This was something he had obtained from Su Zhenhe of the Xuanzhen Gate in the Small World Secret Realm. It is extremely sharp but very brittle; it can be easily snapped with just a little extra force. It is a typical representative of a sword that takes a devious path.

"Then, the long sword at Junior Brother Xu's waist is..."

Xu Yunfan grinned. "I got it from an enemy. I just thought it was pretty good, so I wore it. It's just a matter of tying something to my waist anyway."

"..."

Chu Cangming was slightly silent for a moment, seemingly not expecting Xu Yunfan to answer so directly. It was a good while before he asked again, "I wonder what kind of weapon Junior Brother Xu is skilled in? Or are you good at bare-handed combat? Or perhaps the divine weapon long cane on your back?"

After slightly awkwardly asking this opening question, Chu Cangming was just about to press Xu Yunfan on whether he was proficient in cane techniques when he heard Xu Yunfan's voice.

Xu Yunfan's five fingers loosely gripped the air, making a motion as if swinging a hammer. "Actually, what I'm more skilled in is the hammer."

"Hammer?" The other party was clearly stunned.

"Hammer!"

His arm muscles suddenly tensed. The gaps between the scales of his Dragon Scale Armor erupted with red light. Accompanied by the movement of his blood and qi, the spreading high temperature distorted the air slightly. His hands traced the trajectory of the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique in the air.

The movement seemed simple, but it secretly contained the force-generating techniques of the *Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique*. Even the surrounding air was pressed into visible ripples.

"The heavy cane is good..."

Xu Yunfan turned his hand and lightly tapped the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane on his back. Three of the nine profound patterns on the cane's body lit up in response.

"...if it weren't for the fact that the divine weapon has its own spirit, and I can easily挥洒 vigorous auras just by using it lightly, I would rather use the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer from the Tiangong Cave."

This subtle action exposed the martial artist's instinctive memory of his weapon. Just like the slightly curved knuckles he had now, it was still the muscle habit developed from holding the hammer.

Then, Xu Yunfan said with some regret, "It's a pity that as my martial arts realm increases, hammer techniques have become pitifully scarce."

It wasn't just pitifully scarce. The further one went, because of the prominence of vigorous energy, especially after marrow transformation and organ training, with marrow force derived and vigorous energy churning and solidifying, and one step further to organ training becoming a gale, a long sword or a long blade in hand, when挥洒 casually, could also unleash power far surpassing that of heavy weapons.
