# Chapter 396: The Sinister Fish Wharf  

The Sinister Fish Wharf was not located outside the city but rather to its west, where the largest local river cut through the urban sprawl. Numerous cargo ships docked here, lining the bustling waterfront.  

On either side of the wharf, countless seafood markets bustled with trade, flanked by rows of shops—most of which were seafood restaurants.  

"Is the Heaven-Earth Map here?" Ao muttered.
