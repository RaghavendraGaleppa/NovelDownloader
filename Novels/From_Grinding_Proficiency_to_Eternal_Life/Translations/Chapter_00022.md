# Chapter 22: The Enemy Arrives

Fang Mushan stared intently at the burly man standing before him, who stood over 1.8 meters tall with muscles coiled like knots. A hint of envy flickered across his face.

To undergo such a transformation in such a short time, there could be only one explanation: the man possessed True Blood.

"Who would have thought that someone with True Blood would actually be a servant of the Jiang family? This is truly the joke of the century."

Fang Mushan slowly sat down, watching Xu Yunfan, who was admiring his own body.

Xu Yunfan replied, "Is it possible that I simply have exceptional talent, which is why my cultivation speed is so fast?"

From the corner, Li Haomiao let out a cold laugh.

"If you didn't have True Blood, you would have been beaten to death by Jiang Yu and his gang inside the cave."

Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched slightly. Regarding True Blood, he truly didn't know it offered such a massive boost in martial arts practice. While it provided a cover for his system, it also piqued his curiosity.

If a wisp of True Blood allowed him to master a martial art in just one month, what kind of cultivation speed would those with nearly pure True Blood possess?

"Is True Blood really that strong? To master a martial art to perfection in such a short time?"

His expression was incredibly complex. In Yujing, people praised his extraordinary talent and strength capable of lifting tripods, but compared to a True Blood possessor, it was like the difference between clouds and mud.

An average martial artist would need at least ten to twenty years of bitter practice to master an external training technique, even if the technique wasn't too complex.

Although Xu Yunfan was about to enter the Great Perfection of External Training, tempering the body is not something that happens overnight. Even if he reached Great Perfection, causing a qualitative transformation in his body, it still required time.

But Xu Yunfan was different. When he entered the cave, his build was relatively thin, but by the time he came out, he had transformed into a man over 1.8 meters tall.

Looking at his mass of solid muscle, he didn't look like someone who had suffered in Ningguta at all.

Watching this, Li Haomiao shook his head. "True Blood defies logic. Fortunately, he only has a wisp of it. If he had pure blood, in one month... he might have been able to cultivate Qi."

Fang Mushan asked, "How do you know?"

Li Haomiao glanced at him, then slowly closed his eyes. After a long while, as if remembering something, he said, "My surname is Li."

Fang Mushan didn't pay much mind at first, but then his expression tightened, and he was about to ask for more details when a crisp *snap* of a tree branch rang out from outside the cave.

*Snap!*

Fang Mushan shot to his feet, his expression grave.

"The alarm has been triggered."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and slowly straightened his body.

Animals wouldn't step on branches so easily. Such a noise most likely meant a person.

The art of hunting involved setting up warning devices with extreme precision.

"Damn it!"

Official Xu looked at the broken branch under his foot, his face dark as he spat on the ground.

He hadn't expected the enemy to set up such a clever trap. He turned to look at Yang Gan, feeling very displeased by the other man's look, which seemed to call him an idiot.

"Official Yang, do we still need to investigate this cave?"

Yang Gan let out a cold snort and was about to speak when his pupils suddenly contracted.

In an instant, a thick, large hand burst out from the earth like a steel pincer, firmly grabbing Official Xu's ankle.

Below the cave, under the surprised gazes of Fang Mushan and Li Haomiao, Xu Yunfan's face showed a slightly embarrassed expression.

"I dug the ground above to be thinner on purpose. I thought that if a prey stepped on it and was heavy enough, it might fall right in, giving us something to eat."

Anyone who could step into such a trap without noticing must be quite weak.

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan sank his hips, his bare toes digging into the dirt as his heels stomped down.

A tremendous force surged up from the ground like a tidal wave, flowing from his thighs and waist straight to his arms.

The muscles on his exposed arm bulged high, and thick blue veins popped out like small snakes.

Under the surge of blood and energy, his skin faintly shimmered with a bronze-like luster.

*Bang!*

Official Xu had just lowered his head when he felt the ground beneath his feet give way into a large hole. He was pulled down by an irresistible, mighty force, unable to react in the slightest.

*Thud!*

Official Xu crashed heavily into the bottom of the cave. He felt his chest tighten, and a mouthful of blood spurted out with a *pu* sound.

He widened his eyes, enduring the intense pain as he tried to draw the long sword at his waist. Simultaneously, his right leg shot up like lightning, striking towards Xu Yunfan's waist and ribs from an extremely tricky angle, attempting to force him back.

If Xu Yunfan stepped back, this mustached Official Xu would immediately seize the chance to escape his desperate situation.

Should he grab the incoming leg or step forward to block with his knee?

Xu Yunfan's mind raced, concluding that neither option was feasible. Once he engaged, it would give the other a chance to counterattack.

This Official Xu's adaptability was truly ruthless!

Xu Yunfan steadied his heart. He should be able to take it.

The Copper Body Art had the effect of tempering the body and possessed the characteristics of Hardened Body training.

He ignored the attack, allowing the other's right leg to strike his waist and ribs heavily.

*Clang!*

A dull sound, like the collision of copper and iron, rang out.

Official Xu's face instantly turned deathly pale. His shin bone ached terribly, and he cried out involuntarily.

"Hardened Body?!"

Before he could finish, a large hand, like a dark cloud covering the sun, reached out and covered his entire face, completely blocking his vision.

Xu Yunfan's five fingers clamped down with force. The muscles on his forearm bulged high, and blue veins popped out one by one, as if they were about to burst through his skin.

*Crack, crack!*

Under the stunned, petrified gazes of Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan, Official Xu's head was actually crushed into a pulp by Xu Yunfan, silencing him completely.

Xu Yunfan stood up straight and looked through the hole at Yang Gan, who was standing above on the edge.

He could clearly see the disbelief and shock in Yang Gan's eyes.

This youth... he knew him. He had been standing silently in the corner of the mine that day, but now he stood tall and proud, pulling a First-Rank perfected martial artist, Lieutenant Xu Yun, into the cave and killing him in the blink of an eye.

"Hardened Body technique?"

Yang Gan spoke coldly. He truly hadn't expected the person he had viewed as a mere lackey to now stand before him as a First-Rank perfected Hardened Body practitioner.

With Xu Yun's death, the remaining twenty or so soldiers were instantly enraged, drawing their weapons and preparing to charge.

At this moment, Fang Mushan had already leaped out of the cave. Charging into the formation alone with incredible speed, he hooked his body in close. With a single lift of his arm, one soldier was sent flying high into the air.

His strength was truly terrifying; with a shake of his arms, he could easily topple a fierce horse.

The soldiers, drawn over by the commotion and charging forward, were actually不堪一击 (unable to withstand a single blow) before Fang Mushan.

Fang Mushan's movements were swift and fierce. Closing in, he snatched a spear from a soldier's hand as easily as taking something from a bag.

In an instant, the aura around him changed drastically, like a dormant beast finally baring its fangs, its sharp edge fully revealed.
