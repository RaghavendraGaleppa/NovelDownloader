# Chapter 377: The Mirage God's Pearl, Sharing the Moonlight (1/2)

The setting winter sun was about to sink into the Clear River, its light flickering on the verge of extinction. The entire Clear River County was bathed in a touching rosy twilight.

In the evening glow, the Li Manor seemed to have taken on a fresh new look. The family was gathered for dinner.

Li Dalong, who had just returned from the Ying family's old residence, recounted the day's investigation with lingering fear.

"That disaster beast was truly terrifying. Preliminary judgment suggests it was at least a sixth-rank disaster beast. When we arrived, its body was covered in sword wounds; it must have died just last night."

"Sixth-rank? Good thing it's dead... But who killed it?"

In a small county town like Clear River County, Li Dalong, as the County Lieutenant, was equivalent to a police station chief. Even he was only at the Internal Qi Realm. A disaster beast of that level, equivalent to a human Internal Scene Realm cultivator, would have caused unimaginable consequences if it had gone on a rampage.

"I find it strange as well."

Li Dalong shook his head, painting a vivid picture with his words.

"There were no signs of a struggle at the scene, yet the disaster beast's body was covered in sharp sword wounds, as elusive as a corner of a hanging antelope, leaving no trace to follow. Son, do you have any ideas?"

Old Li had to admit that his son had become far more authoritative in martial arts than he was.

"Ahem..."

Li墨 glanced at the Ice Cube, whose delicate cheeks were lightly moving as she ate, and cleared his throat.

"It was probably some peerless master who dislikes getting involved in worldly troubles. After taking action, they left without a trace, hiding their fame and name."

"The sword masters in Clear River County... I don't think any of them are capable of such a feat."

"Who says there aren't?"

Li Mo was the first to object.

Just then, Ying Bing picked up a piece of sweet and sour pork ribs and placed them in his bowl.

"Who?"

"Precisely, it was your son, me! I was just one step away from becoming the Hero of the Hengyun Sword, just one step short."

Li Jianxian's thumb hooked and pointed back at himself.

"Tsk..."

His parents both rolled their eyes, their expressions full of doubt.

"....."

The Heavenly Derivation Sect!

I wouldn't be satisfied even if I killed you a thousand times!

Little Li Tyrant thought to himself that it was a good thing he wasn't the type of dragon protagonist from a story. Otherwise, with such a huge grudge, wouldn't he have to wipe out the entire family?

Back to business.

Li Mo put down his chopsticks and said seriously, "Dad, Mom, I need to go out for a bit soon."

"The New Year is just around the corner, where are you going?"

"To Ziyang Prefecture. I haven't returned to the sect since coming back from the Southern Frontier. It's only right to go and report my safety to my masters and pay them a visit."

"Oh, you've grown up."

See? Little Li actually doesn't like lying to his parents.

But if he told the truth—that he wasn't just going to pull off a scam, but was targeting the notoriously fearsome Demon Cult—how could he say that?

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly as she glanced at him.

......

After dinner, Li Mo returned to his room. He remembered he still had an investment feedback to claim, so he summoned the system first.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing' and helping her dispel her nightmare.】
【You have one pending investment feedback to claim.】

"Bless me, Ice Cube."

Little Li's expression was solemn. Before opening the feedback, he indulged in a rare moment of superstitious ritual.

Well, this is what you call "temporarily hugging the Ice Cube's feet."

The things Ying Bing gave back were, of course, excellent, but they weren't necessarily what he needed for an emergency...

【Investment Feedback: Mirage God's Pearl】
【Mirage God's Pearl】: "This pearl can simulate all kinds of strange phenomena, even cultivation realms, allowing the host to be cool and flashy in 365 degrees, all-around and without blind spots.
Your imagination determines how powerful you appear. Of course, this is limited to appearance.
It is recommended to have some experience in showing off before using it, otherwise you risk failing to look cool and instead getting beaten up..."

"....."

Li Mo summarized the item's description.

In short, this thing just adds special effects for him?

In his palm, a thumb-sized round pearl appeared. Though small, it seemed to contain a heavy twilight, with a divine aura rippling within.

"So I can change my cultivation realm at will?"

Li Mo focused his mind, and a wisp of his aura suddenly surged.

Internal Scene!

External Scene!

Dharma Body!

Palm Xuan!

It was only when it reached the Palm Xuan Realm that the aura's climb came to a halt. After all, the strongest person Li Mo had ever seen was the monk Huai Kong.

---

He had never even seen the Tongtian Realm above that, so he couldn't add any special effects for it.

"This is amazing... this feeling... so powerful."

Li Mo clenched his fist, then shook his head.

No matter what special effects were added, it was ultimately fake. His actual power level hadn't changed compared to before. It was fine to fool others, but he shouldn't fool himself...

But this also showed how miraculous the item was.

Unless they fought, it would be impossible for others to see through it. It was perfectly suited for his purpose.

*Slam—*

The door was suddenly pushed open.

"Huh?"

Li Mo looked up and saw Ying Bing standing at the door, bathed in the twilight, holding her sword. Her eyes were clear and solemn.

However, upon realizing the Palm Xuan aura was coming from Li Mo, the solemnity in her eyes turned to confusion.

"Ice Cube?"

"What are you doing?"

"Oh, I just temporarily hugged your leg, and the effect was outstanding."

"?"

Li Mo retracted the aura of the Palm Xuan Realm and explained the situation to her while holding the Mirage God's Pearl in his palm.

"Simulating auras and phenomena..."

Ying Bing walked into the room, glanced at Li Dalong and his wife not far away, and closed the door.

"You're not planning to use this to deceive the Demonic Cultists again, are you?"

"!!"

Looking at Ying Bing's calm face, Li Mo leaned back slightly, his heart skipping a beat.

He hadn't said a word about it.

But it seemed she just knew what he was thinking.

"Ice Cube, do you have some kind of superpower, like mind reading?"

"Heart-Penetrating Mind? There is such a martial art in Buddhism, but I haven't practiced it."

"Then how did you know I'm not going back to the Qingyuan Sect, but to Ziyang Prefecture..."

"Because you didn't ask me to go with you."

Ying Bing's eyes, like ice mirrors, made him feel guilty.

"......"

Li Mo pouted, helplessly saying, "I wasn't trying to hide it from you on purpose. It's just that the people from the Demonic Cult are mainly trying to probe me this time. It's enough for me to go alone."

Ying Bing said softly, "I can help you."

"But if one more person goes, there's one more risk. The person coming this time is different from the Beast Hall Master from last time."

As Li Mo spoke, seeing her bite her lower lip, he quickly said seriously, "Don't call me 'stinky little brother,' and 'little brother' is not allowed either."

He was afraid he wouldn't be able to handle it.

Ying Bing stared at him for a moment, thinking, before finally speaking, "Then I won't follow. Release your soul will."

"Right now? Dual cultivation?"

"No. I have gained a new understanding of the Lunar Divine Will, and combined with 'Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh,' I've created a martial art somewhat similar to the 'Heart-Penetrating Mind.'"

"When did you create it?" A small question mark appeared over Li Mo's head.

Even with his comprehension of martial arts, it wasn't that easy to create new martial arts, unless it was hammer techniques.

"Just now."

"?????"

Soon, Ying Bing taught him the technique.

It might really have been created on the spot, because it seemed tailor-made for the two of them.

The prerequisite for its use was that both of them possessed the Lunar Divine Will.

Once activated, it was like opening an all-around video call. The two could use the Lunar power as a medium, ignoring spatial distance to connect their soul wills.

They could even see what he saw and hear what he heard.

Of course, there were limitations: it could only be used at night when the moon is out.

"Ice Cube, have you named this martial art?"

Li Mo looked at the moon climbing the night sky and asked subconsciously.

"No."

"Then what about calling it 'Sharing the Moonlight'?"

Li Mo felt his confidence grow as he let out a breath of turbid air and laughed.

Ying Bing's eyes rippled slightly, and she nodded gently.

She also quietly looked at the moon. Tonight's moonlight would probably be beautiful.

She wondered if, many years ago, her parents had also stood side by side like this, watching the same full moon rise?

......

PS: The little failure of an author once had an inspiration about adding special effects to himself, but unfortunately, it died before it was born. Haha, I guess this satisfies a small regret of mine.
