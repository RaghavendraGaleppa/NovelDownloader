# Chapter 5: The Alchemy Furnace  

"If only I had a flying artifact," Zhang Yan sighed as he trudged toward the market.  

The journey was long, and he couldn't help but envy the disciples who soared past on their spirit boats and flying swords. After navigating muddy paths and streams, he finally arrived at the sect's marketplace—a vast square filled with stalls run by fellow disciples.  

Unlike formal shops, this was a place for informal trades among sect members. Most items exchanged here were either second-hand or miscellaneous, as valuable resources were typically acquired using contribution points from the sect's official channels.  

Zhang Yan eagerly wandered through the bustling square, his eyes scanning for magical artifacts. However, he quickly noticed that few stalls sold such items. After several rounds, he only found one selling new artifacts—none of which matched his needs. What he truly sought were artifacts similar to the jade slip he had acquired before, ones that could enhance his cultivation.  

"If only I could find a place with plenty of second-hand artifacts," he muttered in frustration.  

Then, his gaze locked onto a particular stall.  

The stall owner was a dark-faced man with a sparse selection of items. Among them, a cracked and nearly ruined alchemy furnace caught Zhang Yan's attention.  

**[Name]**: Wood Essence Alchemy Furnace  
**[Quality]**: Green  
**[Effects]**: Alchemy Experience +30%, Minor Mastery in Alchemy, Major Mastery in Fire Control  

Zhang Yan's breath hitched.  

*30% alchemy experience boost? And "Minor Mastery in Alchemy"?!*  

This was an incredible find!  

With this furnace, he could instantly become a Minor Master in alchemy—one of the most revered professions in the cultivation world. Alchemists were rare, as the path required both innate talent and vast resources. Yet, here was a chance to bypass all that struggle!  

Suppressing his excitement, Zhang Yan approached the stall with feigned nonchalance.  

"Senior Brother, how much for this alchemy furnace?" he asked, pointing at the damaged furnace.  

"Wood Essence Alchemy Furnace, mid-grade artifact—110 spirit stones," the man replied flatly before closing his eyes again.  

"110? That's too expensive!" Zhang Yan scoffed. "This thing is practically falling apart. Who knows if it even works anymore? Lower the price, and I might take it off your hands."  

The man opened his eyes and studied Zhang Yan before relenting. "Fine. 100 spirit stones."  

Zhang Yan shook his head. "I'll give you 50. Take it or leave it."  

The man's face darkened further. "A mid-grade artifact for 50? That doesn't even cover the material costs!"  

"But it's damaged beyond repair," Zhang Yan argued. "Even if it works, it might break after one or two uses. And if you're thinking of selling the materials, refining them would cost extra. 50 is a fair price—you're still making a profit."  

The man's expression twisted in frustration before he finally exhaled sharply. "Fine. 50 it is."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother. But I don't have enough spirit stones—can I pay in contribution points?"  

The man's mood instantly improved. "Contribution points? Even better!"  

Contribution points were the sect's internal currency, exchangeable for spirit stones at a 1:1 ratio—though converting spirit stones back into points was far more difficult.  

"50 spirit stones… I'll take 45 contribution points," the man offered.  

"Deal!" Zhang Yan tapped his jade token against the man's, finalizing the transaction.  

With the furnace now his, Zhang Yan examined it closely. Despite its cracks, it was well-crafted and surprisingly heavy. The damage didn't matter—what he cared about were its effects.  

*Alchemy experience. Minor Mastery in Alchemy. Major Mastery in Fire Control.*  

This was a treasure beyond measure.  

Both parties walked away satisfied—but Zhang Yan knew he had gotten the better end of the deal.  

From this day forward, he, Zhang Yan, was an alchemist!  

Instead of returning to the Spirit Herb Garden, he decided to visit the Enlightenment Peak.  

The Qingheng Sect's Enlightenment Peak was where elders gave lectures on cultivation. Basic lessons were free, and disciples could choose to delve deeper afterward. As a new outer disciple, Zhang Yan had access to two free spells—a rare opportunity he wasn't about to waste.  

When he arrived at the peak, he was stunned.  

The place was packed.  

Thousands of disciples crowded the area, their eyes fixed on the grand hall at the center—the Enlightenment Hall. Above it, a massive projection displayed shifting information.  

Zhang Yan took a deep breath.  

*Time to make the most of this.*
