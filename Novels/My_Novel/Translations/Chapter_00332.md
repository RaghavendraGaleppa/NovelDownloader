Chapter 332: Tens of Thousands of Corpse Soldiers, Wen Tian's Trump Card, Chunxia and Li Xian Discovered by a Disciple

Li Xian silently counted the time. The bell rang every nineteen breaths, and with each chime, the evolution of martial arts and the circulation of internal energy were nullified. Once the sound faded, everything returned to normal. Li Xian had always been cautious and did not dare to ignore this anomaly. He held his ground for the moment and gathered Zhao Chunxia, Yi Qianqian, Peng Sanluo, He Lijun, Yang Piaoxue, and the other elders for a discussion.

As newly promoted elders, they lacked deep experience. Though they were composed and had some knowledge, they could not figure out the internal reason. They sat opposite Li Xian to discuss the matter. He Lijun said, "Could it be the miraculous effect of a rare treasure? I recall from classical records that there are strange bells that can shake the four regions when they ring. Perhaps it is something like an ancient bell?"

Yang Piaoxue said, "Perhaps the bell sound is secondary, and it is the unique geomancy of this place that affects us subconsciously?"

Zhao Chunxia said, "It shouldn't be. I suspect it is a natural sound. Just like the 'Ethereal Melody' in our bodies, it possesses wondrous effects. Natural terrain can also produce ethereal and strange melodies."

Various opinions were voiced. Li Xian pondered deeply. He recalled his past encounter at Tiger Weeping Ridge, where the sound of tiger beasts weeping echoed between the cliffs. It made one hear it with sorrow, heartbroken to the point of wanting to commit suicide on the spot to escape the world's suffering. The strange sounds of nature... it was reasonable to say they possessed many wondrous effects. What Senior Chunxia said was the most likely.

They then discussed a solution. At the moment the bell rang, they would try to activate the "Ethereal Melody" to resist it. The Five Great Sword Sects had complete inheritances, with many "Ethereal Melodies" possessing different wondrous effects. There was the "Soft Sword Ethereal Melody," which used bone vibration to produce a melody, transmitted through the wrist bones into the sword, making the sword body as soft as a ribbon, allowing for surprise attacks during sword exchanges.

There was the "Sword Dragon Ethereal Melody," which started flat but ended with a sword strike like a dragon's roar. It made the sword edge extremely sharp, allowing an ordinary sword to cut through iron like mud. There was also the "Summoning Sword Ethereal Melody." When a long sword fell elsewhere and was out of reach, one could play this melody to resonate with the sword body, making it fly back. However, this "Summoning Sword Ethereal Melody" required a mantra to be spoken aloud, and the prelude was long, requiring a long buildup. Different rhythms and cadences would summon different swords.

Li Xian listened to the "clanging" sword sounds and the oscillations of various Ethereal Melodies. The women tried to use the melodies to resist. Some melodies blended with martial arts moves, requiring specific postures to play smoothly.

Li Xian observed carefully, secretly absorbing the essence of the various sword techniques. He knew that martial arts could not be passed to outsiders, so he did not ask, only secretly watched. If he saw a clue, he memorized it and made it his own. If he could not see a clue, he would just memorize the superficial appearance and ponder it later.

He had a nature that loved learning. He knew that the Dao of martial arts was rare, resources were hard to find, and martial arts were difficult to obtain. Whenever there was an opportunity, he would grasp it tightly. Watching and listening from the side expanded his horizons and knowledge... all became bricks for the high tower of martial arts. It was also a rare fortuitous encounter.

However, despite the women's various attempts, when the bell rang, they all returned to a state of being stuck. After exhausting their efforts and gaining nothing, they all rested and gave up. Li Xian secretly played the "Body Guarding Melody" and the "Yang Playing Ethereal Melody," but they were also useless.

He kept guessing: "If it is a natural melody, even if we cannot completely block it, it should reduce its effect somewhat. Why is it completely useless? It seems this bell sound has a mysterious origin, beyond our comprehension. For now, we can only move forward."

Li Xian said, "Sisters and elder sisters, this sound is strange and hard to cancel out. We can only adapt to its rhythm. Execute martial arts moves according to the rhythm of the bell. We will adapt for a moment, then set off forward!"

The women all nodded in agreement. They practiced their sword techniques. When the bell rang, they naturally retracted their moves and retreated to defend. When the bell stopped, they immediately launched killing attacks... In this way, they would not be caught off guard by the bell sound. They advanced and retreated in order, attacking and defending freely.

Li Xian held the Ghost Python Spear and also followed the principle of advance, retreat, attack, and defense. Believing he had adapted to the bell, he led the group forward. In the distance, there was an ancient hall, its body black and towering. The bell sound came from within the hall.

There was still some distance to go. The group was fully guarded, vigilantly observing their surroundings. After walking about two li, they saw a lake in the middle of the land. The women were overjoyed and looked at Li Xian with pleading eyes, wanting to enter the lake for a refreshing wash.

Li Xian remembered the "Heart's Blood." Knowing that they were deep in a cave and a lake suddenly appearing was strange, he ordered everyone to go around the lake and not touch or approach it. The women had passed through many dangers: the Prisoner Girl Gorge, the Marsh Road, the Ten Thousand Lizard Road, the Reflection Cliff... They were exhausted and the journey was perilous. Their clothes had no time to be changed, and the sweat in their boots dried and then wet again. It was hard to finally see abundant water, the lake water clear and crystal clear. But they dared not disobey Li Xian's command and had to step past it.

Once they had all passed the lake, a sharp-eyed woman gasped in surprise, seeing several skeletons floating in the lake. It turned out... this lake was another strange scenery of the "Nine Apertures Dragon Heart Point," the "Heart Lake," possessing hidden dangers. Li Xian's cautious arrangement had avoided this disaster.

The women felt even more convinced.

Walking another li, the women looked into the distance and saw the black hall one after another. Their hearts were uneasy, fearing the dangers in the hall. But there was no way to retreat, so they could only move forward. Next, they saw a single-plank narrow bridge, about ten zhang long. The bottom was deep and hard to see, making it terrifying to look at.

Li Xian walked across first. The women lined up and crossed. Fortunately, it was smooth and safe, crossing this obstacle without incident. After crossing the long single-plank bridge, there were gradually signs of human activity.

Footprints appeared on the ground. A brief deduction suggested they belonged to heavily armored soldiers. Li Xian thought to himself: "Deep in this cave, I don't know where we are. That black hall should be the center of the tomb. I feel that as we get closer to the black hall, the bell becomes more urgent. The interval between bell rings is now less than nineteen breaths. If there are strong enemies hiding, it is best to proactively eliminate them and seize the initiative."

He discussed with the elders, guessing that the Feilong City garrison might be nearby. The elders were full of hatred, and the disciples were burning with anger... They all agreed to attack proactively and kill the enemy for revenge. So they followed the tracks and indeed found a military camp in a very hidden place.

In a hidden pit, the soldiers had set up camp, hiding very well. The leading officer was strong and capable, arranging the camp in an orderly manner. The camp had many soldiers, on duty day and night without interruption, very stubborn.

But the enemy was in the light while we were in the dark, so there was no need to worry about having no plan. Li Xian used his keen eyesight to observe the number of people, the distribution of soldiers, and the shift changes. Seeing that the camp had about three hundred people, all well-trained and mastering several formations.

If they fought head-on, it would inevitably allow the enemy to fully display their advantages. Li Xian immediately arranged a plan, dispersing the six squads to the east, west, south, and north, holding poisoned arrows and bows in readiness. Li Xian, Mu Hongchou, Lin Aoshan, and others would first sneak into the enemy camp to cause chaos, then pretend to flee. At that time, the ambush disciples would suddenly shoot arrows, catching the enemy off guard.

Following the plan, the soldiers were caught off guard and indeed fell into chaos. Before they could form their formations, their leader was killed. Li Xian took advantage of the chaos to thrust his spear, killing several key officers and displaying his might. When the soldiers reacted and gradually formed their battle formation, Li Xian fled to another place, making them chase after him in a hurry. The women's arrows were coated with snake venom and were fully utilized, killing the soldiers one by one, eliminating their advantages and maximizing their own strengths. They vented their anger to their heart's content.

A military camp outpost was destroyed, with corpses scattered everywhere. Li Xian ordered the disciples to throw the bodies into a deep pit to erase their traces. Then he spat out white mist to eliminate the bloodstains and the smell of blood on the ground.

In this way, the soldiers disappeared without a trace, leaving no clues. Li Xian's actions were watertight, allowing the women to secretly learn from him, and they gained a lot.

The camp had abundant supplies, including vegetables, meat, rice, grains, vinegar, and salt, enough to eat for several days. Li Xian observed everything and thought to himself: "They have stored so much, is there some major action coming? Or is the treatment so good that they have a big banquet every day? Well, if I were to be kept in the dark, stationed here, I would certainly not accept it. Well... speculating about this is useless."

He used the pots to start a fire and let the women cook meat and steam rice. Finally, they had a sumptuous meal and ate their fill. That night, they slept on the enemy's beds, feeling refreshed and very comfortable.

Li Xian pondered: "Since we are here and have seen the camp, there must be a path to other places. I'm afraid we might encounter other garrisons and have a head-on collision. By my estimation, we can reach the black hall in another day." Having clarified the priority, he wanted to rest early.

In the middle of the night, Zhao Chunxia suddenly came to visit, looking serious. "Li Xian, I've discovered something! I... I'd like you to help me think it over." Li Xian put on his shoes and socks and said, "Please go ahead."

Zhao Chunxia said, "To be honest, I am much older than you, yet I have been taken care of by you. Just serving you tea and washing your feet is far from enough to repay you. Now my injuries have recovered slightly, but the effect of the bell makes us no different from clay statues."

Li Xian smiled and said, "I heard Elder Yang say that Senior Chunxia has excellent calligraphy. If I have time in the future, you can teach me calligraphy to repay me." Zhao Chunxia said, "That would be great. If you are interested, I can teach you anytime."

Zhao Chunxia said solemnly:

"Let's get down to business. I was captured for a longer time and had my blood drawn three times, all stored in jade bottles. The other female elders had their blood drawn once. Just now, while looting supplies, I smelled a faint scent of blood here. I suspect that when my blood was drawn in the past, it was secretly transported through this place."

Li Xian asked, "What is the use of their blood?" Zhao Chunxia said, "I am also curious, so... I want to follow the blood trail with you to explore the mystery inside. The disciples rarely have a peaceful sleep, let them rest for now."

Li Xian故意 (purposely) smiled and said, "Senior Chunxia thinks about them resting, but doesn't think about letting me rest?" Zhao Chunxia said apologetically, "I'm really sorry, but thinking it over and over, only you can help. Following the blood trail, we don't know what the situation ahead is. Going there with a large crowd is inevitably improper. Although you are young, you handle the world with experience. You are broad-minded and easy-going. I think you... you will help me."

"I just need to trouble you. I... I have nothing to compensate you for now. Once we get out, I will find a way to repay your kindness."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Who said there is no way to compensate?" Zhao Chunxia asked, "Oh?" Li Xian said flirtatiously, "I've been having many nightmares lately and can't sleep well. Thinking about it, it's because I don't have a suitable pillow. If Senior Chunxia agrees to lend me her knees as a pillow, I will sleep sweetly and naturally be energetic. Then, no matter how difficult the matter is, I will help you."

Zhao Chunxia let out an "Ah" in surprise. She knew that Li Xian was occasionally flirtatious and unrestrained. She thought that men and women should not be too close, and such a posture was improper. But asking her heart, she had long wished for it. She said shyly, "You are related to the safety of many sisters and disciples. If your spirit is unwell, the consequences are serious. It wouldn't be impossible for me to lull you to sleep."

Li Xian was startled and thought, "Oops, the joke went too far." He said seriously, "Senior Chunxia, I hope you won't mind. I said it casually to pass the time. Let's follow the blood trail and explore, and return quickly."

Zhao Chunxia watched him leave the tent, the shy look instantly vanishing, and a smile appeared on her face. She thought, "This guy is very carefree. He stirs people's hearts with his words. But if it comes to the real thing, he gets scared first. He thinks I'm a little girl, and with a few flirtatious words, I would really be shy?"

She hurriedly followed, her skirt bringing up a wave of fragrance. She diligently practiced the Health Cultivation Art · Spring Viewing Treasure Canon. Her body was like a vibrant spring, full of life, and all things revived. Her injuries recovered very quickly. The injuries on her back and ankles were completely healed.

Yue Shan Sword Sect had a martial art called "Wind Smelling Nose," which had a keen sense of smell and was excellent for tracking. Zhao Chunxia saw that the women were sleeping soundly, the enemies had been executed, and there were women patrolling the watchtowers. The arrangements were thorough and proper, so there should be no great danger.

Li Xian left a note to inform them of his whereabouts. He and Zhao Chunxia walked to a secret tent, which was now empty. The women's blood had already been transported away. Zhao Chunxia held a horsetail whisk and waved it to the side, then circled it. She lightly sniffed the scent, closed her eyes to sense, and said, "It is indeed here, my judgment is correct."

Li Xian cupped his hands and said, "Senior Chunxia's abilities are gradually showing!" Zhao Chunxia said, "This is nothing. Those bandits collected the blood and transported it here. But it was taken away several days ago, and there is still a slight scent of blood remaining along the way. Let's follow and see."

Her abilities had now recovered by thirty percent. Li Xian thought to himself: "Since Senior Chunxia has this ability, why did she need my help? She could find it herself. I really have a laborious fate."

They walked west a few steps. They saw a strangely hidden path, blocked by rubble. Zhao Chunxia waited for a few breaths until the bell rang. Then she waved her horsetail whisk, and the rubble moved neatly several feet, clearing a path. The rubble was loose, with ash sprinkled on top. If someone moved or shifted it, it would be immediately detected. Zhao Chunxia's wave of the whisk moved the rubble and ash horizontally several feet, but the overall structure remained unchanged.

Li Xian secretly admired her. The two entered the strangely hidden path and followed the trail. They sensed that the path spiraled downward, as if entering an abyss. The deeper they went, a gust of Yin wind blew in their faces.

Zhao Chunxia said, "The Yin energy is so strong." She stopped and did not go further. Going deeper, the Yin energy would attack the body, making it very difficult. She cultivated the "Spring Viewing Treasure Canon," and her injuries healed quickly. The tracking and whisk abilities she had just shown were already profound. But she had no way to deal with Yin energy. Li Xian, with his Pure Yang body, had Yang energy like a furnace of fire, and was not affected here.

Moreover, the means of martial artists varied. A problem that one finds unsolvable, another might solve with a raised hand. A dangerous place that one fears to enter, another might move freely in and out. Each has their own specialty.

Li Xian said, "Senior Chunxia, come to my side." Zhao Chunxia asked in surprise, "You have a way to deal with it?" Li Xian flipped his hand and drew his sword, his sword stance elegant. Zhao Chunxia suddenly thought: "That's right... back in the Prisoner Girl Gorge, I asked him what he looked like. He gave me a simple drawing, holding a spear and a sword in the picture. I have seen his archery and spear skills, so his swordsmanship should be no different." Her eyes shone, and strange waves rippled.

But see the long sword slash, a scorching heat wave. The Yin wind in front was blocked. Zhao Chunxia's expression eased greatly, and she said, "Your swordsmanship is extraordinary, it actually touches upon the principles of Yin and Yang."

Li Xian asked, "Touching upon the principles of Yin and Yang, is that very powerful?" Zhao Chunxia said, "It depends on the specific martial art. The principle of Yin and Yang is relatively rare. If it can form a school, the ability is very powerful."

Li Xian thought: "Madam really kept secrets from me, not passing on the essentials of the Dao of martial arts completely to me. That's fine, how dare I ask others to be selfless and good to me?"

The two went deeper. The Yin energy became stronger. Li Xian danced his sword with one hand, executing "Yang Extreme Sword Radiance," drawing a circle of light in front of him. He always dispersed the Yin energy, so walking was no obstacle.

Several gusts of Yin wind blew past. Li Xian said jokingly, "Senior Chunxia, there is no one else here. I am a Pure Yang body. If you don't mind, it's fine to get closer to me."

Zhao Chunxia said seriously, "Men and women should not be too close. Since our first meeting, you have always been a bit flirtatious. If you are mistaken for a playboy, that would be terrible."

Li Xian thought to himself: "You got it right, I am indeed half a playboy." He said, "Senior Chunxia, you misunderstood. I said get closer, I didn't mean to take advantage of you. It's just that my body is like a furnace, and Yin energy dares not approach."

Zhao Chunxia suddenly smiled and said, "Oh?" She stepped forward and hugged him sideways, being intimate without distance. She asked, "Do you mean getting close like this?"

Li Xian was startled, suddenly smelled a fragrant breeze, and felt a delicate body hugging him. The two were tightly pressed together. Li Xian could feel Zhao Chunxia's heartbeat, breathing, and the起伏 of her chest. Zhao Chunxia felt like she was hugging a hot furnace, with intense Yang energy. She had never had such an experience in her life, and had never hugged a man before. Her heart was wandering and her spirit was soaring.

Although Li Xian considered himself carefree, having experienced the affairs of the One Union Manor and the Flower Cage Gate... his innate nature, combined with his later experiences, made him naturally flirtatious in speech. But he was not a lustful person. When he said "get closer" earlier, he meant "holding hands," not embracing. Holding hands also had no ambiguity. He didn't expect Zhao Chunxia to be like this...

Li Xian said strangely, "Senior Chunxia... this is a bit..." Zhao Chunxia asked, "What, you told me to get close, and now you dislike me?"

Li Xian said, "I wouldn't dare." He walked forward silently. He had learned from the "Immortal Visiting Inn" incident about Zhao Chunxia's experience and guessed that she was a female knight who adhered to the righteous path. But it was not the case. When she was quiet, she was extremely quiet; when she was moved, she was extremely restless.

Zhao Chunxia adhered to the righteous path, even to the point of being pedantic. But she knew that besides good and evil in the world, there were other things. When it did not violate her nature, she also had hidden thoughts. In the past, when she learned that the Luo family of Embroidered City had the "Yellow Nine Ginseng," she sent her two disciples to help.

Her original intention was to eliminate demons and kill evil, but at the same time, she also implied that if the luck was sufficient and the timing and conditions were right, she could take the "Yellow Nine Ginseng" for herself and did not need to return it to the Luo family. The Black-faced Bat King had been evil for many years, and eliminating him was for the good. The Luo family's loss of the "Yellow Nine Ginseng" was a family matter. The ginseng treasure was naturally formed, wandering and passing through many hands. Those with sufficient luck take it. The Luo family dominated a region, with evil deeds and good deeds... it was hard to judge good and evil, but it was inevitable that they oppressed the people. If they obtained the Yellow Nine Ginseng, returning it would naturally be righteous and trustworthy. If not returned, it could also be considered venting anger for the people.

Under her righteous style, she actually had a deep mind.

Zhao Chunxia, reminded by "there is no one else here," took the opportunity to hug him. She thought: "This guy still thinks I'm pedantic. How many years of rice have I eaten compared to him? Do you really think I'm easy to flirt with? I usually just pretend when others are around." Seeing that Li Xian was very restrained, she found it funny, felt a bit proud, and at the same time felt warm and酥软 (limp), feeling attached. She pretended to be serious and said, "Li Xian, little brother, thank you for helping me block the Yin energy!"

Li Xian thought, I don't lose anything anyway, why be timid? So he wrapped his arms around Zhao Chunxia, sheathed his green sword, and leaped forward quickly. Zhao Chunxia's heart was stirred, and the feeling was unforgettable. She couldn't help but hug him tighter.

Soon they reached the bottom. Li Xian went further, turned a small corner, and suddenly saw countless figures in front. Li Xian stared vigilantly, then observed carefully, and breathed a slight sigh of relief. The countless figures in front were not from living people.

Zhao Chunxia said in a low voice, "So many corpse soldiers!" The corpse soldiers wore heavy armor, were tall and strong, and their bodies were stiff. They had been silent for a long time. Li Xian realized: "That He Wentian, as the lord of a city, dared to have the intention of becoming a king in troubled times. I had long guessed he had other support. Now it seems, his greatest support is here."

Li Xian walked through the corpse soldiers, counting them carefully. There were probably tens of thousands. And they were strong and tall. If they went to the battlefield to fight, they would be unstoppable. The ground veins were dark red, and when stepped on, they felt fleshy.

Zhao Chunxia lowered her head and said, "It's wall-grown flesh. This Nine Apertures Dragon Heart Point is not simple. Nurturing corpse soldiers here is the best. No wonder there are gusts of Yin wind here. If not for your Pure Yang body, it would be really difficult to set foot here."

Suddenly, there was a "dong" sound. The bell from the black hall rang. Then the flesh writhed, and a red vein spread from afar. Looking closely, the vein was like a blood vessel in the body. Blood was transported from afar, looking like red light spreading. The blood reached the feet of the corpse soldiers. The corpse soldiers stood barefoot, in contact with the blood, nourished by it. The corpse soldiers' bodies trembled, and their armor made a "clanging" strange sound.

It turned out that the strange scenery of wall-grown flesh had become even more mysterious. Blood vessels had grown inside, resembling real flesh and blood. Feilong City had the Sacred Prayer Mountain with a "Maiden Temple," which only allowed women to enter. Offerings did not require incense, only women's blood. Every time there was a temple fair, the attending women would donate blood, which was stored in abundance.

Corpse soldiers feed on Yin blood and grow. Being nurtured here for a long time shows that He Wentian had planned for a long time. Li Xian figured out the details and concluded that the blood of Zhao Chunxia, Tang Mengluo... and other sword sect elders and disciples was definitely used here.

So he searched in detail. He saw the corpse soldiers arranged in formations of "squads" and "sections"... The front rows were the generals of each army. Those corpse soldiers had bare silver arms, long hair flying, broad chests and backs... about ten feet tall, like terrifying little giants.

Their bodies were painted with blood patterns, which came from the women of the sword sects. It turned out that Yin blood also had differences. The blood of ordinary women nurtured ordinary corpse soldiers. The blood of those from sword sects or the martial world who possessed martial arts cultivation and had absorbed the essence of heaven and earth was used to nurture the尊者 (venerables) and kings among the corpse soldiers.

Zhao Chunxia angrily said, "That He Wentian... he captured us to draw blood, truly killing three birds with one stone. He fooled the Five Great Sword Sects around. He also used our blood to nurture corpse soldiers, enhancing their abilities. Afterwards, he would destroy the Flower Gate Gate and greatly boost his reputation. If the Jieyou Tower had not collapsed, who could easily detect such a conspiracy?"

"We... we would probably have been imprisoned in the stone cave, spending the rest of our lives in hatred. Allowing him to draw blood and use us, helping the tyrant against our will."

Li Xian said, "It seems heaven does not want him to succeed. Now that Senior Chunxia has been saved and has discovered his great secret, you will surely be able to expose his face and be the savior."

Zhao Chunxia's pretty face turned red: "You speak strangely. What savior or not? Even if he has tens of thousands of corpse soldiers, he only has the initial posture of competing for hegemony. I expose his villainous heart, not to serve the court. The trend of chaos cannot be reversed. The court's corruption and evil deeds also exist. Good and evil are hard to speak of, how can there be talk of saving the world?"

Li Xian smiled and said, "This person is adept at manipulating people's hearts, insidious and cunning. He now has only tens of thousands of corpse soldiers. But if he uses this trump card to manage and expand properly, and then occupies the advantages of timing, geography, and human harmony, I'm afraid it will be very difficult to deal with."

Zhao Chunxia asked, "You are young. If you expose He Wentian, you can definitely become famous. It seems you have no interest in this?" Li Xian said, "Whether it's a bad name or a good name, I really don't care much."

Zhao Chunxia said, "Your temperament is very carefree, and you are quite smart. If only my two disciples had half of your ability..." She suddenly sensed a strange sound and coldly shouted, "Who is sneaking around, eavesdropping here? Come out quickly!"

There was no movement. Zhao Chunxia held her horsetail whisk and waved it to one side. A row of corpse soldiers fell over. Her ability was already quite strong at this moment. A figure quickly scrambled out, saying hurriedly, "Master, d-don't use a killing move... it's me!"

Zhao Chunxia exclaimed, "Xiao Long?"

Wang Long's eyes来回 (to and fro) observed the two of them. Seeing them hugging each other tightly, men and women being very close, he was dumbfounded, his expression extremely disbelieving.
