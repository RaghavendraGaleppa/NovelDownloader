# Chapter 244: Taking Stock  

The attacks on Li Shiming's main body and his clone Li Yuanba occurred almost simultaneously. By the time Li Yuanba had finished his battle and found a place to rest and tally his gains, Li Shiming was also settling down elsewhere to assess his own spoils.  

Li Shiming's greatest reward this time was undoubtedly the flying sword artifact. If Elder Zhao hadn't intervened, he might not have obtained such a treasure.  

Elder Zhao was a sword cultivator. Although Li Shiming didn't specialize in sword cultivation, he possessed sword intent and often relied on sword techniques in battle, displaying a level of sword intent far surpassing that of ordinary sword cultivators. Additionally, Elder Zhao and Elder Su belonged to the same faction within the sect.  

Thus, Elder Zhao seized the flying sword artifact from Hang Jian and gifted it to Li Shiming—an act of mentorship and high expectations.  

Elder Zhao recognized Li Shiming's inevitable rise to the Golden Core realm, a belief shared by many who knew of Li Shiming's potential.  

The Shushan Sect would undoubtedly push Li Shiming, with his latent alchemy mastery, toward the Golden Core realm. Of course, this also depended on Li Shiming's luck—whether he could break through the formidable barrier to Golden Core despite having ample resources.  

Li Shiming silently noted Elder Zhao's kindness, knowing he would have to repay it in the future.  

He retrieved Ji Hongbo's storage bracelet and probed it with his spiritual sense.  

Ji Hongbo was a true disciple of the Shushan Sect. Since he wasn't dead, the storage bracelet still had restrictions. But even if Ji Hongbo had retained his original strength as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the restrictions on his bracelet would have been no match for Li Shiming's spiritual sense.  

The bracelet contained many items, but few caught Li Shiming's attention.  

Artifacts, technique jade slips—he could easily obtain such things if he wanted.  

There were about five million spirit stones, some stored in Northern Shu Trading House tokens and the rest in physical form.  

The spiritual wine and food were of exceptionally high quality, and a box of spiritual tea even reached the third-grade—the most pleasant surprise in the bracelet.  

Just as Li Shiming was about to withdraw his spiritual sense, he paused.  

In the area storing elixirs, his spiritual sense wrapped around a jade vial and retrieved it.  

Had it not been for the vial's peculiarity, he might have overlooked it entirely.  

This was a Shushan Sect-customized elixir vial, but it differed from the standard ones.  

What struck Li Shiming as unusual was that such vials rarely appeared in the hands of Foundation Establishment cultivators—they were typically reserved for Golden Core elders to store important elixirs.  

The vial's crafting process was intricate, requiring significant effort from a high-level artificer.  

He opened the vial, and an intoxicating medicinal fragrance wafted out.  

His expression shifted slightly, and he immediately resealed the vial.  

"Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill!" he murmured in surprise.  

Having inherited the *Shushan Alchemy Compendium*, Li Shiming was well-versed in the Shushan Sect's elixirs.  

The Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill was a third-grade elixir, but its value far surpassed that of ordinary third-grade pills.  

Much like the difference between standard first-grade cultivation-assisting pills and Foundation Establishment Pills, the gap in value was astronomical.  

The Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill was used by Golden Core cultivators to break through bottlenecks, allowing them to glimpse the next realm's insights in advance and increase their chances of success.  

While the pill also had some effect on Foundation Establishment cultivators advancing to Golden Core, it wasn't listed among standard breakthrough resources.  

This was because the Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill was made from several third-grade spiritual herbs—precious even among Golden Core cultivators. How could it be wasted on Foundation Establishment disciples?  

For most sects, the choice between nurturing a new Golden Core cultivator and elevating an existing one would always favor the latter.  

The former had a low success rate—even with breakthrough resources, a Foundation Establishment cultivator's chances of advancing only increased by 30-40%. In contrast, the Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill's effects on Golden Core cultivators were tangible.  

Even if a Golden Core cultivator failed to break through, the insights gained wouldn't disappear. The accumulated comprehension would eventually aid in future breakthroughs.  

For Li Shiming, the Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill boosted his chances of reaching Golden Core by over 20%. Combined with breakthrough resources, his preserved Primordial Yang body, and his flawless Dao physique, he estimated his success rate now exceeded 60%.  

But he was also aware of his weakness—the "Five Elements Absorption Array" he had devised within his spiritual lake introduced significant uncertainty into his breakthrough.  

At this point, he wasn't lacking in breakthrough resources. Whether from the Shushan Sect or his clone Li Yuanba, he could obtain what he needed.  

Moreover, as an alchemist, by the time he reached late Foundation Establishment, he was confident he could refine third-grade elixirs himself, allowing him to use the most effective breakthrough resources.  

What he lacked were two third-grade Five Elements materials—water and wood attributes. Only with these could he elevate the Five Elements Absorption Array to third-grade, giving him a chance to break through to Golden Core.  

"There's no rush," Li Shiming thought calmly. Given his status, he could request these materials from either of his masters if needed.  

Of course, this was his last resort. While the materials might not be overly precious to his masters, asking for them outright would be presumptuous.  

Elder Su and Elder Ma weren't his exclusive mentors—if every disciple made such requests, Elder Ma, with his abundant resources, might manage, but Elder Su would be severely strained.  

Worse, Li Shiming was only Elder Ma's nominal disciple, making such a request even more inappropriate.  

Li Shiming smiled as he examined the Sky Fragrance Enlightenment Pill. Had he known about it earlier, he might have killed Ji Hongbo outright.  

"Overthinking it," he chuckled to himself. "Would Elder Ji really send a Golden Core cultivator after me over one pill?"  

Dismissing these thoughts, he closed his eyes and connected to IBMz15. The supercomputer fed him its recent analyses and research on formations, including processes and results.  

Above his head, a starry sea of formations materialized, with a nebula-like cluster already forming and beginning to interlink.  

"Just a bit more," he murmured, sensing the formation sea. "Once I return, I'll have petitioners pay with formation knowledge instead of resources."  

He had assumed reaching Formation Mastery would be straightforward. But even after absorbing the formation knowledge from both the Shushan Sect and the Senluo Sect (via Li Yuanba), he remained a hair's breadth away from true mastery, stuck at the bottleneck.  

Had he a formation master as a mentor, they would have told him how arduous the path to mastery was.  

Every formation master had to synthesize knowledge from countless sources and dedicate centuries of study before achieving enlightenment.  

For someone like Li Shiming, who had only studied formations for a few years, aspiring to mastery was exceedingly rare in cultivation history.  

That said, in practical application, his skills were already on par with a formation master's.  

His biggest limitation was his cultivation realm. If he were at Golden Core, he could work with third-grade materials to create formation flags capable of withstanding Golden Core attacks.  

But as things stood, even pooling resources from both his main body and clone—both of whom held respectable positions in their respective sects—he still couldn't gather all five third-grade Five Elements materials, let alone spare any for formation flags.  

"Once my alchemy reaches master level, I'll start learning artificing," Li Shiming planned.  

By Golden Core, artificing became essential for most cultivators. At that stage, Golden Core flames could refine third-grade materials, providing the foundation for artificing.  

Though Golden Core flames were too violent for alchemy, they were perfect for artificing.  

Golden Core cultivators obtained third-grade materials through great effort—either by serving their sects for years to exchange contribution points, venturing into dangerous territories, or relying on sheer luck.  

However they acquired these materials, Golden Core cultivators treasured them deeply. Entrusting such materials to others for refining was always a risk.  

Moreover, many Golden Core cultivators' lifebound artifacts required crafting according to their inheritance manuals, which contained sensitive cultivation secrets. Outsourcing the work risked leaking these secrets, creating vulnerabilities.  

By Golden Core, inheritance techniques became paramount, involving deeply personal cultivation methods. The slightest leak could be exploited by enemies.  

Thus, even if Golden Core cultivators didn't specialize in artificing, they needed to master enough to craft their own artifacts.  

---  

Meanwhile, in the Ten Thousand Mountains, Li Yuanba examined twelve needle-shaped artifacts, increasingly amazed by Yu Piao's extravagance.  

The needles were made from third-grade metal. Though Li Yuanba had little expertise in artificing—especially regarding third-grade materials—he couldn't identify the specific metal used.  

Despite the small quantity, this metal could have been forged into a small artifact by a skilled artificer.  

Unbeknownst to Li Yuanba, Yu Piao had obtained these needles through sheer luck.  

Originally, they were meant to be a set of twelve needle artifacts crafted by a Golden Core cultivator who had ambitiously attempted to forge them from scarce third-grade metal.  

But the cultivator overestimated his artificing skills. His half-baked attempt resulted in a failed artifact set, which he sold off in frustration to a more skilled artificer.  

That artificer, after much effort, also failed—downgrading the artifact set into spirit tools.  

For Golden Core cultivators, spirit tools were trash—especially ones made from third-grade metal. Using such items would invite ridicule.  

But for Foundation Establishment cultivators, they were priceless treasures.  

The twelve needles were top-tier spirit tools, thanks to their material and the fact that two Golden Core cultivators—one a skilled artificer—had worked on them.  

Had the first artificer not dug such a deep pit, the second might have salvaged them.  

The needles' grade was comparable to Li Yuanba's third-grade sword foundation—both were spirit tools made from third-grade materials.  

But there were key differences. The sword foundation was a transitional item, capable of evolving into an artifact once Li Yuanba reached Golden Core.  

The needles, however, would remain spirit tools forever.  

Li Yuanba didn't bother refining them. Though he didn't fully subscribe to the pure sword cultivator's "one sword only" philosophy, the needles were useless to him—they wouldn't enhance his combat power.  

At range, he had the Swift Wind Golden Light Sword; up close, his third-grade sword foundation sufficed. For a sword cultivator to use needles would be laughable.  

But the needles might benefit Li Shiming, offering another formation-deployment method to complement the Nine Palaces Sword Formation.  

Li Yuanba stored the needles and began sorting through the other storage pouches and bracelets, separating useful items from the rest.  

He couldn't help but sigh at the vast disparity between the Senluo Sect's true disciples and the Shushan Sect's.  

In truth, he was mistaken. Had Lin Ping, Du Ke, and Yu Piao enjoyed strong backing in the Senluo Sect, they wouldn't have needed to steal his breakthrough resources.  

These three were marginal figures among the Senluo Sect's true disciples, taken in by weaker Golden Core elders who lacked influence.  

Struggling elders could hardly provide much support, especially when it came to critical resources—those naturally went to disciples of more powerful elders.  

Li Yuanba, in contrast, was a privileged true disciple. Ancestor Lu had casually gifted him a set of breakthrough resources, and Sword Elder's influence in the sect ensured his status.  

Ji Hongbo, on the other hand, was the son of one of the Shushan Sect's most powerful Golden Core elders. The two were incomparable.
