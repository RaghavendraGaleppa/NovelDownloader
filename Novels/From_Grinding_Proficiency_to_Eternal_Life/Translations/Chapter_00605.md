# Chapter 605: First This, Then That!

If they missed this storm, how could the other Golden Core True Lords sit idly by and watch a new True Lord rise?

They would surely do everything in their power to obstruct him during his ritual, which would be a truly inescapable dead end.

Even with the Attribute Panel at his side and the Soul Exchange Technique that would allow him to transfer his consciousness to his clone, Han Shi, everything would have to start over from scratch.

Unless absolutely necessary, Xu Yunfan would not choose this path.

With this in mind, Xu Yunfan no longer had any hesitation. He said with firm conviction, "Thank you, True Lord, for your great favor, and thank you, Senior Brother, for your guidance! Xu Yunfan will surely do his utmost to investigate the situation of this world for the Primordial Origin Sect!"

This task was not only a crucial step in acquiring resources but also an opportunity to demonstrate his value and loyalty to Qingyuan True Lord.

After all, this world had been specifically given to him by Qingyuan True Lord precisely because he had been instrumental in breaching the Heavenly Court's world.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's decisiveness, Lu Chuan revealed a hint of satisfaction on his face.

While Qingyuan True Lord had no shortage of fierce demons with formidable combat prowess, those who understood the situation, knew their limits, and possessed genuine talent in formations and artifact refining were indeed rare.

Xu Yunfan's performance undoubtedly increased his weight in the True Lord's mind.

Needless to say, the True Lord was watching from above.

"However," Lu Chuan's tone suddenly shifted, his smile remaining gentle, "before officially investigating the world, there is one lingering worry that must be resolved first."

Xu Yunfan's eyes sharpened. "Oh? Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."

"Although intercepting the coordinates has not yet alarmed the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect for the time being, that female sword cultivator is not without connections," Lu Chuan explained. "Those of her bloodline within the Sword Sect have already sensed the severance of her unusual aura. That person is her uncle, the elder of the Ye family on the Tianji Peak of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, Ye Yuan."

Ye Yuan.

Xu Yunfan understood immediately.

He was somewhat familiar with the name, as his clone, Han Shi, was in the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, giving him a general understanding of the sect's family factions.

To become an elder of a peak in the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, his status was no less than that of a Peak Master in the Primordial Origin Sect. He was undoubtedly a Great True Person at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm, and specializing in the Dao of the Sword, his lethal capabilities were far from what an ordinary Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment could compare to.

"Ye Yuan is不惜代价 (bùxī dàijià - sparing no cost) to trace and track her using the Tianji Pulling the Thread Sword Art," Lu Chuan said in a grave tone. "To prevent him from finding any clues and interfering with our subsequent plan to investigate the world, and more importantly, to avoid exposing the coordinates of the new world to the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect's view, we must eradicate him completely before he can truly lock onto his target!"

He looked at Xu Yunfan with a burning gaze.

"This matter requires a swift victory, laying out a heavenly net without allowing for any mistakes. Xu Shidi, your mastery of formations is profound, especially in trapping and killing, and you can instantly connect with the earth's veins to deploy a deadly array. For this ambush, your methods are key to sealing off this person's escape route. I'm afraid it will be a辛苦 (xīnkǔ - arduous) task for you."

Ambushing a sword cultivator at the peak of Foundation Establishment.

Even though Xu Yunfan already possessed the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, had perfected the Divine Thunder Scripture, and held trump cards like the fake Golden Core position and his mastery of formations, hearing these words still made his nerves tense.

Sword cultivators from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect were known to be the first in killing intent among their peers.

If a single piece of information were to leak, and if the heavenly secrets were not concealed, it might引来 (yǐnlái - attract) a True Lord from the Sword Sect to descend with a sword intent from afar and slay them. Their entire team would likely be buried here.

It was no wonder they had been waiting for him.

Only Xu Yunfan could deploy formations to conceal heavenly secrets and use secret techniques of causality, amplified by the formation array, to disrupt causality, temporarily turning an area into chaos.

Naturally, he had no intention of shying away from this.

To be honest, even if the opponent were to slaughter them like melons and vegetables, Xu Yunfan was confident he could escape.

After all, his primary role was to set up the formation for containment. If the situation turned unfavorable, he would leave first.

"Rest assured, Senior Brother. I will handle the sealing and suppression, leaving him no chance for survival."

This was precisely the reason Qingyuan True Lord had sent him to participate in such a core task—to utilize his value in formations.

If he were to shirk even this responsibility, his bold declarations in the Qingyuan Hall earlier would become a joke.

Lu Chuan nodded with satisfaction. "Good! I have already arranged for several other True Persons to join us. Among them is the one responsible for concealing that female sword cultivator's aura..."

He paused, his tone carrying a subtle hint of a reminder. "That is True Person Zhang Qiaoluo. She has been using a secret treasure to conceal your aura for a full three years.

Now that you have emerged from seclusion today, she has wasted three years of her time, and her temper is难免 (nánmiǎn - inevitably) a bit irritable. You should pay a little attention when you meet her."

Xu Yunfan's heart was as clear as ice.

The Primordial Origin Sect is a place of cold relationships. To cover for someone for three years for no reason, not only did it consume her spiritual energy and mental energy, but she also had to bear the risk of being injured by Ye Yuan's sword intent or even implicated.

It was perfectly normal for this Senior Sister Leng to have怨气 (yuànqì - resentment).

"Yunfan understands. Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother," Xu Yunfan郑重 (zhèngzhòng - solemnly) agreed.

"There is no time to lose. At the chen hour (7-9 a.m.) three days from now, we will meet three thousand miles outside the Cold Crow Pass, at the 'Chaos Wind Gorge.' Ye Xuan is held there."

Xu Yunfan naturally understood that such underhanded deeds could not be carried out within the Primordial Origin Sect's territory, or even in the Eastern Continent. The best location was at the border of the three major sects.

It would be even more deranged to choose a location within the Bodhisattva Pure Land.

Three days passed in a flash.

The Cold Crow Pass, a major fortress of the Primordial Origin Sect on the Eastern Wasteland's border, was filled with mixed spiritual energy, the smell of blood, and the noise of various marketplaces.

Xu Yunfan concealed his presence, retracting his aura to its limit. Like a silent bolt of lightning, he passed through the clouds and mist from the Divine Thunder Peak, quietly flying over the Cold Crow Pass, and headed straight for the more remote Chaos Wind Gorge.

The Chaos Wind Gorge lived up to its name. Its sides were towering cliffs of reddish-brown stone, jagged and steep.

Inside the gorge, the fierce gale howled like ghosts and demons, a constant, piercing shriek that never ceased, making it the perfect natural cover and ambush ground.

Xu Yunfan landed quietly before the appointed time, his spiritual sense spreading out like ripples.

There were already four people here.

The first was Lu Chuan.

He wore a blue robe, his aura as steady as a sea, and the majestic Dao aura of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator was still令人 (lìng rén -令人) daunting.

Standing beside Lu Chuan was a woman.

She wore a dark palace gown, her features cold and clear, like the frost of a new moon, with a vermilion mole between her eyebrows that was piercingly red.

An invisible, intangible aura surrounded her, yet it made one's soul feel a deep, cold pain, as if she herself were a black hole that devoured living souls.

She was none other than a Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment, Zhang Qiaoluo.

The moment Xu Yunfan landed, her eyes, as cold as an abyss of ice, swept over him. She said nothing, but the invisible scrutiny and displeasure were almost overflowing.

Even with Xu Yunfan's firm Dao heart, he felt a chill run through him.

There was no need to say more; this woman was definitely the one who had covered for him for three years.

"Shidi Xu has arrived," Lu Chuan spoke at the right moment, his tone calm as he introduced Xu Yunfan. "This is Senior Sister Zhang Qiaoluo. The reason we could temporarily conceal the matter of Ye Yuan from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect's investigation is entirely due to Senior Sister Leng's use of the 'Mysterious牝 Transforming幽 Slaughter Soul True Scripture' secret art to sever the bloodline connection. Her toil and merit are great."

Xu Yunfan understood immediately and stepped forward at once, bowing deeply.

"Xu Yunfan greets Senior Sister Zhang. I have troubled Senior Sister to painstakingly conceal the causality for the sect's grand plan for three whole years. This junior brother has just emerged from seclusion and am late to offer my thanks in person. It is a great lapse in etiquette. I beg for your forgiveness, Senior Sister!"
