# Chapter 68 - The Trash Bin of a Foundation Establishment Cultivator  

The next day, Lin Shan arrived at the street vendor area. With both commissions now completed, it was time to focus on his own needs.  

The shops in the commercial district were far too expensive, so he hoped to find some hidden gems or decent bargains among the street stalls.  

The vendors here were mostly rogue cultivators—those who couldn't afford shop rentals or lacked the skills to establish themselves in proper businesses. They set up stalls to scrape together spirit stones for survival, catering primarily to fellow rogue cultivators.  

Young masters from cultivation families rarely shopped here, preferring the security and reliability of established stores.  

The rogue cultivators' stalls were transient, with no reputation to uphold. While their prices were lower than shops, many items were secondhand and came with no guarantees.  

Tales abounded of misfortunes: someone bought a Blazing Talisman only to have it explode before they could use it; another purchased a magical artifact that flew away the next day; yet another consumed a pill that left them vomiting and nearly qi deviating.  

But Lin Shan wasn’t worried. With his enhancement panel, he could identify the true nature of any item. Hunting for bargains was one thing—trying to scam him? Impossible!  

Strolling through the vendor area, he passed rows of stalls where sellers loudly hawked their wares—techniques, artifacts, pills, spirit herbs, spirit wood, puppets, talismans, spirit beasts, and more.  

Some cultivators had even resorted to running underground brothels, unable to compete with the entertainment district’s "Spring Swallow Pavilion." Whether these were traps or not remained to be seen.  

A few vendors aggressively pulled customers in, their enthusiasm bordering on harassment.  

Lin Shan found himself dragged to a stall by a young girl. The stall owner, an elderly man at late Qi Refining stage, beckoned his granddaughter behind him and gestured to a pile of talismans.  

"Friend, take a look. All low-grade talismans—one spirit stone per stack, ten sheets each."  

Lin Shan sighed, eyeing the girl who had stubbornly clung to his sleeve. Fighting or scolding her wasn’t an option in the market. Wasn’t there any regulation against such tactics?  

He examined the talismans—Golden Light, Earth Spike, Vine Binding, Healing—all low-grade spells of the metal, earth, and wood elements.  

"Did you make these yourself?" Lin Shan asked, surprised.  

The old man nodded. "Indeed. I possess spiritual roots in metal, earth, and wood, so I’ve dabbled in techniques of all three."  

Lin Shan was impressed. Mastering three different elemental techniques must have taken decades of painstaking effort to reach late Qi Refining stage.  

---  

Two days earlier, at the mountaintop pavilion, Lin Shan had learned about cultivation aptitudes from Gongsun Yu and other young masters from cultivation families. It had been his first glimpse into the vast world of immortal cultivation.  

Most cultivators possessed multiple spiritual roots, but aptitude wasn’t determined by quantity or elemental type.  

The recognized hierarchy of talent was divided into four tiers:  

A, B, C, D.  

These grades solely reflected cultivation speed.  

Elements like metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, and ice merely dictated affinities and strengths. Rare elements like thunder or ice might be prized, but aptitude varied individually.  

For example, someone with metal, earth, and thunder roots might have two "D"-grade affinities but one "A"-grade, in which case they’d focus on cultivating the "A"-grade element.  

Lin Shan only knew he had a wind spiritual root. Testing for others or determining their grades required specialized artifacts only major sects possessed. Rogue cultivators had to figure it out themselves.  

Single-element cultivation offered focused progress for faster breakthroughs. Multi-element cultivation provided versatility for diverse combat scenarios.  

Legendary combined techniques like "Wind-Fire Wheels" required dual wind-fire roots, while "Polar Icefall" was exclusive to ice-water dual roots. Even rarer was the fabled "Magnetic Thunder Escape," requiring thunder-earth roots.  

The world was vast and full of wonders, with countless fusion techniques—even the mythical "Primordial Magnetic Divine Light," said to unify all five elements!  

Yet, aside from a handful of prodigies, most cultivators specialized in one element.  

Mastering multiple techniques consumed precious time better spent advancing to Foundation Establishment or Golden Core realms—where longevity and immortality lay.  

This old stall owner likely diversified out of necessity, crafting talismans to make ends meet.  

Lin Shan shook his head. "Low-grade talismans aren’t useful to me. If you had mid-grade ones, I might consider it."  

The old man sighed. "If I could craft mid-grade talismans, I’d have been hired by the North City’s Hundred Treasures Pavilion or Talisman Tower. Mid-grade talismans require Qi Refining beast hides for paper, late-stage wolf-hair brushes, and late-stage beast blood for ink..."  

---  

The old man rambled on about his struggles, lamenting his inability to break into mid-grade talisman crafting.  

Lin Shan, growing impatient, hastily picked out a stack of Healing Talismans—perhaps they’d come in handy someday.  

Just as he was about to pay, a middle-aged vendor nearby interjected:  

"Healing Talismans—fifteen sheets per stack, one spirit stone."  

Without hesitation, Lin Shan turned away.  

He moved to the neighboring stall, where the selection was far more diverse.  

The girl who had dragged him over pouted, pointing accusingly at the middle-aged vendor. "I brought him here! You always steal our customers!"  

The man remained unfazed. "Shopping means comparing goods. My prices are lower, my variety is better, and my quality surpasses your grandfather’s. What can you two even compete with?"  

The old man stayed silent, but his granddaughter stomped her foot. "All because you’re from a cultivation family with a Foundation Establishment uncle..."  

Lin Shan’s eyes widened. This stall was a treasure trove.  

Hungry Ghost Talismans, Summoning Talismans, Sealing Talismans, Invisibility Talismans, Bloodburn Talismans, Windriding Talismans, Soulhook Talismans, Ghostbanish Talismans, Spirit Light Talismans, Mind-Concentration Talismans...  

All low-grade, but the variety was staggering. More importantly, his enhancement panel confirmed none were defective.  

The middle-aged vendor grinned. "These were all crafted by my uncle, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. They’re just his practice pieces—drawn on low-grade paper and tossed aside. I collected them from his trash bin. A steal at these prices!"  

Lin Shan was intrigued. Even if they were low-grade, talismans from a Foundation Establishment expert were bound to be exceptional.  

The vendor continued, lowering his voice conspiratorially. "He considers these trash, but for Qi Refining cultivators like us, they’re treasures. Once they’re gone, they’re gone!"  

Lin Shan nodded. These talismans were niche but effective. If they’d been made with higher-grade materials, they’d undoubtedly be mid or high-grade.  

He picked up a Mind-Concentration Talisman. The enhancement panel displayed:  

**[Mind-Concentration Talisman]**  
Grade: Low  
Effect: Stabilizes spiritual awareness, sharpens focus, and slightly shields against soul-disrupting attacks.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

"This talisman has dual uses," the vendor explained eagerly. "It aids in breaking through bottlenecks by steadying the mind. In battle, it offers minor protection against soul-targeting artifacts or techniques—invaluable!"  

Lin Shan mused that with this talisman, Princess Guo’s Soulstartle Bell wouldn’t have completely immobilized him back in the woods.  

"I’ll take it. How much?" Lin Shan waved a hand, assuming a low-grade talisman couldn’t be too costly.  

"Five spirit stones per sheet."  

...  

The two men locked eyes in silence.  

After a long pause, Lin Shan broke first, adopting a friendly tone. "Let’s be friends. I’m not just buying one—this could be the start of a lasting business relationship!"  

The vendor sighed. "I’m not the family heir, so competition is fierce. Sneaking these from my uncle’s trash bin is risky—plenty of others are eyeing it too..."  

Their gazes remained locked, each recognizing a kindred spirit in bargaining.
