# Chapter 26: News of the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique

Hearing this, Chu Ning didn't immediately agree or refuse. Instead, he wore a puzzled expression and asked:

"Senior Brother, can you teach me the method of making talisman paper? I heard before that this technique can only be taught by the sect."

"Of course it's taught by the sect," Zhuang Yunde immediately said with a serious expression. "How could I privately teach sect techniques?"

Just as Chu Ning was feeling confused, Zhuang Yunde's face broke into a smile again.

"However, as the duty disciple in charge of the Ding District of the Spiritual Plant Garden, I have the qualification to make periodic recommendations. I can suggest to Steward He and the Hundred Arts Hall that a particular laborer disciple be taught a certain skill."

"As long as the recommendation is successful, the disciple can use the spiritual plants they grow to learn paper-making. If they succeed in learning it, they can even apply to the sect to take on talisman paper-making tasks."

After saying this, Zhuang Yunde looked at Chu Ning with an appreciative expression.

"And aside from the quality of the Ink Spirit Bamboo, the key techniques in making ordinary talisman paper are the Purification Technique to remove impurities from the pulp and the Object Control Technique. Observing Junior Brother Chu's talent in wood-element spells, I believe you have great potential to master talisman paper-making."

Hearing this, Chu Ning finally understood what was going on—Senior Brother Zhuang wanted to make a behind-the-scenes deal with him.

Zhuang Yunde's words made it clear that the recommendation qualification was in his hands—he could recommend Chu Ning or someone else. After all, learning a skill from the Hundred Arts Hall wasn't limited to paper-making; it could be other things as well.

Therefore, Zhuang Yunde would first choose those he believed could master the skill, as that was the only way he could benefit from it. Clearly, before this, Chu Ning was just one of his potential candidates. But after seeing the quality of the Ink Spirit Bamboo Chu Ning cultivated, his ranking had risen to the top.

As for whether this opportunity would go to Chu Ning, it clearly depended on whether Chu Ning would agree to give him that ten percent share.

Chu Ning hadn't expected to encounter such under-the-table dealings even in the world of immortal cultivation. And all of this was clearly within the sect's rules. Perhaps the sect was aware of such practices and tacitly allowed them.

However, upon further thought, Chu Ning realized this was actually a win-win situation. While Zhuang Yunde would profit from it, if Chu Ning could learn the talisman paper-making technique, the benefits to himself would be far greater. After all, he also had the Talisman Source Spiritual Body as his innate talent. If he had an advantage and higher success rate in talisman-making, there was no reason he wouldn't have similar advantages in the more basic paper-making technique.

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately put on a grateful expression and said:

"In that case, I must thank Senior Brother for your kindness."

Hearing this, Zhuang Yunde's smile widened. "Junior Brother, what are you saying? This is mutually beneficial. After I return, I'll immediately make the recommendation to the hall."

"Since recommendations need to be made in advance—sometimes Steward He will also come to inspect the quality of your spiritual plants—it will take a few months."

Chu Ning nodded in understanding.

The two then walked toward Chu Ning's courtyard, chatting and laughing along the way.

At this point, Chu Ning remembered something he had wanted to inquire about the past couple of days, and his heart stirred.

In terms of cultivation level and status, Zhuang Yunde might not compare to Shi Yao from the Transmission Hall, but in terms of knowledge and experience, he might not be inferior. Moreover, from the way he spoke, he seemed much more likely to have useful information.

Thus, Chu Ning deliberately steered the conversation: "Senior Brother Zhuang, a few days ago, I went to the market with some fellow disciples and was truly amazed. The market was filled with all kinds of rare treasures, spiritual plants, and magical tools—many of which I had never even heard of. I wonder if there's any place in the sect where we can learn more about such things."

"There is!" Zhuang Yunde nodded. "The sect's Transmission Hall has a library. The inner section mainly contains cultivation techniques and spells, while the outer section contains miscellaneous records and strange tales."

Just as Chu Ning was about to ask more, Zhuang Yunde's next words poured cold water on his hopes. "The outer section isn't strictly managed—any outer sect disciple can go there to read."

"Outer sect disciples..." Chu Ning sighed softly upon hearing this. It seemed he was out of luck.

But then Zhuang Yunde added, "Junior Brother, what kind of books were you hoping to read? I could borrow them for you."

Chu Ning's eyes lit up. What he most wanted to know about were the Seven Star Spirit Fruit and the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique. However, it would seem more natural for someone with mere curiosity to ask about only one topic.

After quickly weighing his options, Chu Ning made a decision and said, "I mainly wanted to learn more about different types of spiritual plants, since I'm now part of the Spiritual Plant Hall. I've read some basic ones in the Transmission Hall before, but those were quite ordinary."

"It seems Junior Brother is interested in rarer spiritual plants and herbs," Zhuang Yunde said with a smile, readily agreeing. "I'll look for some. If I find something suitable, I'll borrow it for you."

Chu Ning thanked him profusely again. After chatting for a while longer, they soon arrived outside the courtyard.

After a brief internal struggle, Chu Ning decided to press further: "Senior Brother, there's one more thing I'm curious about. I've heard that some cultivators achieve the Dao through body refinement, reaching extremely profound levels of cultivation, but nowadays, they seem rare."

"Body refiners?" Zhuang Yunde shook his head with a smile. "They are indeed rare now. It's said that in ancient times, everyone was an ordinary mortal. After spiritual energy emerged between heaven and earth, some exceptionally talented individuals achieved Qi absorption through body refinement, becoming cultivators."

"Thus, many people followed suit, refining their bodies through various methods. Some became cultivators, but there was never a complete cultivation method. Even those who succeeded could only let spiritual energy circulate randomly in their bodies after refinement, forming a path of mana circulation that suited them."

"Later, as more and more people entered the path of cultivation through body refinement, an exceptionally talented individual created the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique. For a time, it spread across the world, and body refinement reached its peak."

"The Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique?" Chu Ning couldn't believe he had actually heard the name from Zhuang Yunde and couldn't help murmuring it aloud.

Zhuang Yunde nodded. "The Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique is hailed as the greatest body refinement method of all time, with exceptional refining effects. But later, more and more people created different cultivation techniques based on mana circulation paths—what we now know as Qi absorption techniques."

"These techniques allowed faster Qi absorption and entry into the Qi Refining stage, so body refiners gradually dwindled. Over time, body refinement methods were slowly lost. The most widely spread Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique did survive, and many versions still circulate today. But very few people practice it, as most places only have fragments of the text."

Zhuang Yunde paused before adding, "It's said that breaking through bottlenecks in body refinement is extremely difficult and requires the aid of heavenly treasures. The difficulty far exceeds that of ordinary cultivation techniques by several times. Nowadays, even if there are still some body refiners, they don't practice these ancient refinement techniques."

"Instead, they rely on external forces, with higher-level sect elders using their mana to assist in tempering their bodies. Their strength does surpass that of ordinary cultivators."

At this point, Zhuang Yunde's expression turned serious. "If Junior Brother ever encounters such cultivators in the future, you must be cautious."

"Thank you for the warning, Senior Brother." After responding, Chu Ning casually offered a flattering remark. "Senior Brother's knowledge is truly vast, to know even such things."

Zhuang Yunde smiled again. "Some of it I heard from my teachers, and some I read in miscellaneous records. To be honest, Junior Brother, I've always been fond of learning about these odd bits of knowledge, which is why my own cultivation progress has been slow."

"Oh, right." Zhuang Yunde seemed to remember something. "The information about body refinement came from an ancient text in the sect. I wasn't particularly interested in it, so I didn't memorize much. If Junior Brother is curious, I can bring it for you to read."

"Then I must thank Senior Brother again." Chu Ning was overjoyed and expressed his gratitude once more. "After hearing Senior Brother's explanation, I feel it's important to learn more about this, so I'll know what to do if I ever encounter such cultivators."

Perhaps sensing Chu Ning's genuine interest in these strange tales, Zhuang Yunde felt they were kindred spirits and chatted a while longer before leaving.

The next day, when Zhuang Yunde came to the Ding District on business, he faithfully brought two jade slips. The contents recorded on them were precisely the two books Chu Ning had wanted to read.
