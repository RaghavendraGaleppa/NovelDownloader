# Chapter 168: You Have Entered the Gate, Reaching Minor Success

Zhan Yan tossed a manual from his chest, the very one containing the annotations for the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method.

"I only taught you the basics these past few days; I didn't expect your progress to be so rapid... Once you enter the gate and continuously condense the Crimson Serpent Mountain-Sustaining Force, combining it with the hammer technique, every inch of your flesh will be able to store power, and your hammer intent will be able to penetrate through thirty layers of armor."

"I'm feeling a bit unwell, so I'm going to rest first. You keep practicing."

Without waiting for Xu Yunfan to speak, Zhan Yan turned and quickly left.

Xu Yunfan could only call out, "Master, take it slow!"

Only after Zhan Yan's figure had completely disappeared from sight did Xu Yunfan shift his gaze to the densely packed annotations on the diagram.

He rubbed the armor-piercing hammer Zhan Yan had specifically forged for him; the patterns carved on the handle were all guides for the force application of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method.

To an outsider, they were merely decorative, but to someone who had learned the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method, they were undoubtedly an auxiliary tool that greatly increased efficiency.

The next instant, hammer shadows cascaded like a waterfall.

Every strike Xu Yunfan made carried a strange resonance frequency. The wind and thunder sounds generated by swinging the hammer gradually shifted from piercing shrieks to deep, dull rumbles.

Night was approaching. When the final hammer fell, a large stone in front of the mountain hollow dropped with a heavy thud. The hammerhead sank deep into the stone without causing any ripples, as if a steel needle had pierced into a block of tofu.

All the force was twisted into a single strand, with not a single bit leaking out.

**[You have successfully executed the first move of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method, Starfalling天河 (Starfalling River of Heaven). Your Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer has entered the Gate.]**

**[Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method, 0/500 (Entry Level)]**
**[Special Effects: Mountain Soul Forging Body, Boulder Grinding Body, Serpent Qi in Hundred Bones,卸力三甲 (Three Layers of Armor Force Dissipation), Thousand-Jun崩岳段 (Mountain Crumbling Phase One), Hammer Method入微 (Subtle/Perfect Control)]**

In an instant, a large mass of warm currents surged within his body, flowing through his four limbs and eight meridians, beginning to rapidly strengthen his physique.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a muffled groan. He stepped back, the surging strength unable to be contained, pouring out with every step he took, causing the ground of this mountain hollow to tremble slightly.

His skin suddenly turned a rust-colored grayish-blue, and his muscles bulged frantically as if being hammered repeatedly by an invisible heavy hammer.

The golden luster floating amidst his originally tangled muscle fibers became increasingly dense. The scale-like membranes on his ribs opened and closed with his breath, emitting the sound of metal grinding. His plate-like ribs continuously expanded outward and contracted as his body stretched.

Deep within his bones, a nine-link chain of dragon roars erupted. His spine arched up section by section like a crimson serpent rolling through waves. If one could look beneath his skin, they would see the airflow pouring into the spinal dragon, with every gap between the vertebrae exuding a strange bronze-colored marrow that permeated his flesh and blood.

His pores all over his body spewed out scorching mercury-like mist. The wisps of internal energy cultivated from the Pure Yang One Qi Technique began to rapidly revive within his flesh and blood. Strengthened by the large streams of heat generated within his body, they began to merge into his blood energy.

As the internal energy merged into his body's blood energy, Xu Yunfan's body shook violently. The steaming blood energy actually condensed into the shadow of a crimson serpent above his head. Faintly, one could even hear the growls of an angry serpent coming from the rubbing of bones, tendons, and skin inside his body.

The beating of his heart was like the rolling of war drums; every contraction shattered the rock layer beneath his feet.

Strange patterns appeared faintly where bones and tendons intertwined. The vibration frequency of the Nine-Stacking Force, which resonated with these patterns, made his muscles tremble rapidly, causing a layer of faintly visible airflow to swirl around his surface.

The Qi Armor spontaneously generated by the cultivation of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique!

If an ordinary weapon were to touch his skin, it might be ground into iron filings by the high-frequency Qi Armor.

The rapid changes within his body gave Xu Yunfan an overwhelming urge to vent. He opened his mouth wide, a high-swelling blood lump protruding from his throat, and let out a roar that was almost visible to the naked eye.

The vegetation within a radius of ten zhang was flattened in an instant.

**[Your Pure Yang One Qi Technique has reached Minor Success.]**

**[Pure Yang One Qi Technique, 0/500 (Minor Success)]**
**[Special Effects: Pure Yang Purple Qi Phase One, Qi Armor Phase One, Endurance Phase One, Recovery Phase Two]**

After adapting to the changes in his body and the cultivation memories injected into his mind, Xu Yunfan was surprised to discover that his Pure Yang One Qi Technique had actually been brought to Minor Success by the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method.

The strands of Pure Yang Qi hidden deep within his flesh and blood had been strengthened significantly by the large amount of warm current generated by the Attribute Panel, and moreover...

Xu Yunfan immediately sat down cross-legged and began practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, actually forming a small cycle within his flesh and blood.

When Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and focused, he felt fine sand-like warmth flowing through his flesh and blood. The newly born Pure Yang internal energy no longer lay dormant deep within his flesh but instead slowly seeped along the texture of his muscles, outlining intermittent golden lines between his arms and back. Occasionally, when a current brushed past his bones, it would emit a dull sound similar to heavy hammering on iron.

The warm current injected by the Attribute Panel had not dissipated; it was currently roaming beneath his skin, carrying the Pure Yang Qi. When he tried to breathe and meditate, he found that the internal energy was spontaneously circulating within the muscle groups of his chest and abdomen.

Xu Yunfan could hold back no longer and opened his eyes with joy.

His state of mind fluctuated accordingly, and the Pure Yang internal energy that was slowly flowing through his flesh and blood once again sank deep into his flesh, becoming still.

This... this is Internal Energy!

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but tremble with excitement, jumping up and down in place for a good while.

Although this world had Blood Qi Martial Dao, which allowed one to break through human limits and far exceed what人力 (human strength) could achieve, and even at the Ninth Realm, one could still condense True Qi amidst an extremely powerful physique...

That was the Ninth Realm!

Although he had借着 (relied on) the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method to break through the Pure Yang One Qi Technique to Minor Success, and the Outer Three Unions followed suit to Minor Success...

The Hundred-Reforging Steel Body and the Crimson Serpent Mountain-Sustaining Force could be practiced, but it was still somewhat laborious to utilize the techniques of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method.

To be more relaxed, his flesh and blood needed to transform, and his force needed to penetrate deep into the muscle-refining realm to achieve that.

However...

Although his Blood Qi had not yet reached the Muscle-Refining Realm where force penetrates to the hair tips, under the consecutive improvements of both techniques, his physique had already far exceeded that of an ordinary Great Martial Master at the Outer Three Unions Minor Success level.

Just what level had his strength reached?

He lightly tapped his foot. A force sprang from the spinal dragon, instantly transmitting down to the soles of his feet.

*Boom!*

The ground beneath his foot silently cracked into a spiderweb pattern, spreading out in all directions until it reached the edge of the mountain hollow.

With such strength, he was confident he could resolve Su Zhenhe within ten moves.

After returning to his courtyard in the Heavenly Craft City, washing up, and lying on the bed, Xu Yunfan suddenly felt waves of exhaustion.

It seemed that his nerves had been stretched too tight due to a series of events over this period. If not for the support of the Calmness Mantra, he wouldn't have been able to hold on for so long.

Calculating the days, Xu Yunfan had relied on practicing the Calmness Mantra every night to boost his spirits; he hadn't truly slept for nearly half a month.

Today was a good day; he had to relax one way or another.

Xu Yunfan placed the Steel Mechanism Box by his side and tightened the Extreme Dao Remnant wrapped around his body like a vest.

This Extreme Dao Remnant not only had an extremely tough skin but could even withstand the divine weapon, the Gilded Cudgel. Aside from training, he had almost never taken it off.
