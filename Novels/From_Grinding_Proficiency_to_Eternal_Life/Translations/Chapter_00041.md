# Chapter 41: Sudden Change

Xu Yunfan’s cold expression softened slightly.

He pondered for a moment.

"You really want this house?"

Hearing Xu Yunfan relent, Qin Bo hurriedly said, "Yes, this is my ancestral home. Yesterday, I was a bit too anxious. My junior sister has a hot temper and only heard half the story. Knowing that my house had a new owner, she said we should scare you a bit first, thinking that would naturally make it easier to buy the house back."

He gave a bitter smile and clasped his hands. "I hope you can forgive me, Brother Xu. We were indeed in the wrong. Once Senior Sister Fei recovers from her injuries, I will bring her over to apologize to you."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. He turned and walked away as he spoke. "Since this is your ancestral home, and since you are willing to reason, I naturally won't make things difficult for you. Come in and talk."

"Thank you."

Qin Bo took a deep breath and slowly followed Xu Yunfan into the house.

The moment he stepped inside, his gaze instinctively darted toward the corner.

In an instant, his pupils constricted violently.

He saw that a blue brick below the courtyard wall was already shattered. That was exactly where he had buried something of utmost importance!

In a flash, shock and anger, like a surging tide, completely submerged his mind.

His treasure had been dug up!

He jerked his head up, his eyes quickly filling with bloodshot veins, and stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan’s back as he led the way.

Xu Yunfan, however, remained oblivious and said casually, "I only bought this house from the broker a few days ago. I’ve only done a basic cleaning inside; the furniture is mostly untouched. I won't make things difficult for you. The silver notes I got from your junior sister before were only a thousand taels, plus my..."

*Clang!*

A crisp sound, like the collision of copper and iron, suddenly echoed through the originally quiet small courtyard.

Xu Yunfan, feeling a slight stinging pain at his waist, spun around sharply. He saw Qin Bo holding a dagger and stabbing viciously toward his kidney.

The dagger pierced through his tough, ox-hide-like skin, the tip sinking in half a fraction.

After all, Qin Bo was a martial artist. The strike was incredibly heavy, breaking the skin at his waist. However, the dagger was instantly stopped by Xu Yunfan’s subconscious muscle reaction. His muscles contracted like an iron hoop, clamping down tight, preventing it from advancing any further.

"You... what are you doing?"

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, his voice deep and steady, without a trace of fluctuation.

Qin Bo, however, was filled with bitterness and disbelief, muttering, "Hardened Body?!"

He felt like the sky was collapsing. The person he had randomly encountered was actually a rare Hardened Body martial artist.

The anger in Xu Yunfan’s heart now rose like a lit gunpowder barrel.

Fortunately, he had cultivated the Copper Body Art. If it had been someone else, this strike would have completely taken away their combat ability, plunging them into the danger of death.

Having a kidney pierced, under the terrible hygiene conditions of the ancient era, was almost considered a fatal injury. Who knew if there was a doctor capable of treating it? Most likely, one could only wait for death.

He was truly shocked and furious. The blood energy in his body surged like a thunderclap on flat ground.

His heart rate instantly reached nearly three hundred beats per minute. A large amount of blood, accompanied by rapidly rising hormones throughout his body, rushed swiftly to every part of him.

The muscles on his body instantly tightened and bulged, swelling up like air had been pumped into them. Blue veins popped out on his skin surface, twisting like gnarled old tree roots, appearing particularly ferocious under the sunlight.

Even a faint copper luster could be seen on his skin. As he moved his arms, the copper luster on his body flashed continuously under the sunlight.

Xu Yunfan’s large hand shot out like lightning, grabbing Qin Bo’s shoulder as he tried to retreat.

The immense force caused his fingers to sink deep into the muscles of Qin Bo’s shoulder and neck, firmly holding him in place, not allowing him to step back an inch.

The pain caused Qin Bo’s ferocity to be completely ignited.

He knew that without a sharp weapon, ordinary mortal weapons could not harm Xu Yunfan in the slightest. He made a decisive move and let go of the dagger.

Qin Bo’s blood energy surged, and the muscles on his arms bulged high, as if they were about to burst through the束缚 of his skin.

His palms, filled with blood energy, swelled to a size larger than usual.

Without the slightest hesitation, Qin Bo let out a "Heng Ha" sound and slapped fiercely toward Xu Yunfan’s temple.

The palm wind whistled past, carrying a chilling aura. The immense force even created a "wuwu" sound in the air.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged, as if he didn't see Qin Bo’s attack at all. He simply lowered his head and charged forward, quickly closing in on Qin Bo.

*Thud!*

Xu Yunfan’s head was shaken violently by Qin Bo’s palm, his eyeballs trembling uncontrollably up and down.

He hit him!

Qin Bo was ecstatic inside. He knew that before reaching the perfection stage of Hardened Body, there were always weak points. Areas like the groin, throat, and temples were almost impossible to train with energy and were as vulnerable as an ordinary person’s.

The joy hadn't stayed in his heart for half a second when Qin Bo felt his waist and side suddenly clamped tight by an iron hoop.

In the next instant, he felt his entire body instantly lifted into the air, then plummeted straight down like a meteor.

*Bang!*

The powerful impact almost displaced his internal organs. The凝聚的 blood energy was also shaken into turmoil. His eyes jumped uncontrollably, and a mouthful of blood spurted straight out.

Seeing Qin Bo, who was lying on the ground, trying to struggle to his feet, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate. He bent down, quickly wrapped his arms around Qin Bo’s waist, planted his feet firmly, and exerted force from his waist and abdomen, letting out a low grunt.

The muscles on his arms bulged high, blue veins popping out one by one, surfacing on his skin.

Then, a powerful force rose from the ground. As his muscles layered and transmitted the force, it was like holding a thousand-pound weight, suddenly exploding.

Xu Yunfan lifted Qin Bo into the air again, then spun around and slammed him heavily into the ground.

*Thud!*

A muffled巨响 accompanied by the sound of bone cracking rang out. Qin Bo didn't even groan before passing out completely.

Xu Yunfan slowly let go, his expression somewhat blank.

He was a bit puzzled. Why were these martial artists so crazy one after another?

They hadn't even said two sentences, and they were already pulling knives and stabbing from behind.

What is wrong with them?!

Xu Yunfan exhaled, moved his body, and slowly suppressed the surging blood energy in his body. He rolled up his sleeves, put his hands on his hips, and shook his somewhat dizzy head.

Although Qin Bo’s palm hadn't caused him any real damage, it had made his head feel a bit muddled.

In close combat, with his cultivation in the Red Copper Body and Wind-Piercing Hammer, he could naturally avoid it easily.

One word: Iron Head.

If you want to fight a Hardened Body martial artist in close combat, as long as you don't hit the vital points, in the same realm, as long as the other party doesn't have secret martial methods or sharp weapons, you can walk all over them.

He slowly walked around the courtyard and finally recalled that when he turned around, Qin Bo had glanced behind the courtyard wall, and then his emotions had instantly become abnormal.

His heart moved, and he walked toward the courtyard wall.
