# Chapter 115: Ranked Eleventh

Not long after, Zhang Jing's figure gracefully descended from the Celestial Ascent Stairs, his brow slightly furrowed.

This attempt at challenging the Celestial Ascent Stairs left him with only one impression—extreme difficulty!

This wasn't just about the formidable strength of the guardian spirits guarding the stairs, making them hard to overcome. More importantly, the power gap between adjacent guardian spirits had widened to an enormous degree, completely different from before.

Even with Zhang Jing's current strength, he could only reach the fourth step of the Celestial Ascent Stairs. To advance further, his Lunar Serpent Dao Intent would need to reach at least fifty percent comprehension—anything less would be impossible.

Returning to reality, Zhang Jing connected with the Dao Mark in his palm and looked at the Spiritual Essence Ranking, scanning from top to bottom. His gaze immediately landed on his own name.

[Eleventh: Zhang Jing (Qi Refinement Tenth Layer · Seventy-Six Steps · Dragon Lake Academy)]

There was no helping it. Among a long list of Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators, Zhang Jing, still at Qi Refinement tenth layer, stood out conspicuously.

Seeing this, even though he had anticipated it, Zhang Jing couldn't help but be slightly stunned.

Eleventh place already?

This time, the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven had welcomed over six hundred Foundation Establishment inner disciples from the three great academies, along with dozens of Qi Refinement tenth-layer outer disciples. Among so many people, he, Zhang Jing, had forcefully climbed to eleventh place with his Qi Refinement tenth-layer cultivation!

Meanwhile, in the Third Void Heaven, another pair of eyes was fixed on the Spiritual Essence Ranking—specifically, on Zhang Jing's name.

"Eleventh place?" A voice filled with shock rang out, cutting through the howling winds. Shen Qingqing covered her mouth with her hand, her eyes reflecting disbelief.

The image of Zhang Jing surfaced in her mind—a quiet-looking youth, though occasionally ruthless in his actions. She understood, of course; at that time, rankings were at stake, so holding back was out of the question.

But now, she simply couldn't reconcile the memory of that serene youth with the Zhang Jing who had overshadowed countless inner disciples and claimed the eleventh spot on the Spiritual Essence Ranking.

No—to put it more accurately, across all three great academies, only ten senior brothers could surpass him. And the most shocking part? He, like her, was only at Qi Refinement tenth layer!

This stark contrast made Shen Qingqing feel as if she were dreaming.

Just how profound must his Dao Intent comprehension be to rank eleventh on the Spiritual Essence Ranking? And what kind of monstrous talent would be required to achieve such a level of understanding?

Shen Qingqing didn't dare—nor did she want—to ponder these questions. Her sole goal now was to grasp a sliver of Dao Intent. And with nearly three and a half months remaining before the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven closed, she was confident she could achieve it.

Just then, a lively voice called from behind her. "Qingqing, what are you looking at?"

"Senior Sister Nian, how did your meditation go?" Shen Qingqing turned to the newcomer and asked curiously.

Opposite her, Qin Nian placed her hands behind her back, lifted her chin, and nodded emphatically. "I succeeded! I've finally grasped a trace of Dao Intent!" she exclaimed excitedly.

"Ah! Congratulations, Senior Sister!" Shen Qingqing was genuinely happy for her.

"By the way, what were you looking at earlier?" Qin Nian asked, brimming with enthusiasm.

In response, Shen Qingqing's expression turned enigmatic. Without explaining, she simply pointed to the Dao Mark in her palm and said, "Senior Sister, take a look at the Spiritual Essence Ranking—from the top down."

"Spiritual Essence Ranking?" Qin Nian's delicate face showed confusion, unsure why she was being asked to check it.

Ten breaths later, a sharp cry pierced the air. "Ah! What the—how did that monster Zhang Jing climb to eleventh place?!"

In the Ninth Void Heaven, Zhang Jing landed lightly on the ground. Just as he was about to move forward, a voice called out from ahead with certainty. "Junior Brother Zhang Jing?"

Zhang Jing stopped and looked up in puzzlement. Through the thick mist, a blurred figure gradually emerged, growing clearer as it approached. The figure's robes shimmered with purple hues.

Purple robes—an inner disciple senior brother? Zhang Jing relaxed slightly. He already knew who this was. When he had checked the Spiritual Essence Ranking earlier, he'd noticed only one Dragon Lake Academy senior brother in the Ninth Void Heaven—Huang Jingtong, if he recalled correctly. He just didn't know which pavilion the man belonged to.

As the figure drew near, Zhang Jing greeted respectfully but without subservience. "Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother Huang!"

Huang Jingtong laughed heartily. "No need for formalities, Junior Brother Zhang! I'm the chief disciple of the Inspection Pavilion, and you're the future chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion. We're equals."

"Since it's your first time here, let me show you around the Ninth Void Heaven. But there's no rush—we still have over three months here," he added warmly.

"Thank you, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied with genuine gratitude.

Then, as if realizing something, he asked, "Senior Brother, is it difficult to enter the Tenth Void Heaven?"

Huang Jingtong turned back with a wry smile. "Junior Brother, do you know who's currently in the Tenth Void Heaven?"

Without waiting for an answer, he continued, "One is the chief disciple of the Spirit Dao Pavilion—you probably know him. The other two are senior brothers from the Divine Thunder Academy and the Profound Radiance Academy. All of them are ranked on the True Spirit Ranking."

"Now you understand what I mean," he finished.

Zhang Jing fell silent.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

Deep within a sea of mist, a piercing shriek tore through the thick fog for dozens of miles, revealing Zhang Jing's figure hidden within.

He looked up calmly at a three-legged azure luan bird flapping its bloodstained wings desperately as it fled into the distance, its aura already on the verge of collapse.

"Trying to escape? But where can you run?" Zhang Jing extended a finger.

A faint, almost imperceptible streak of dark light shot through the mist, instantly catching up to the luan bird. With a final mournful cry, the massive creature plummeted from the sky.

"Another fifty thousand. This should be enough to push my Dao Intent to perfection," Zhang Jing mused inwardly.

Connecting with the Dao Mark in his palm, he checked his accumulated spiritual essence.

[Spiritual Essence: 12,073,200]

In just half a month, Zhang Jing had harvested over ten million spiritual essence in the Ninth Void Heaven. The greatest contributor to this feat was undoubtedly the dense mist shrouding the realm. His modified miniature Dark Flood Dragon technique was already exceptionally stealthy, and combined with the obscuring mist, his efficiency in hunting spirit beasts had reached terrifying levels.

Raising his head, Zhang Jing's gaze seemed to pierce through the void, locking onto the Tenth Void Heaven above.

"With perfected Dao Intent, I should be able to ascend now, right?"
