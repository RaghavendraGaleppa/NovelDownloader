# Chapter 104: Preparing to Depart

Another three or four days passed.

By the azure lakeside.

Zhang Jing slowly rose to his feet and left the spot where he had sat for over twenty days, his eyes no longer holding any trace of longing or hope.

The unwillingness in his heart gradually dissipated.

During these past few days.

The stubborn Zhang Jing had repeatedly tried to re-enter that previous state and reconnect with the Aurora Magnetic Sea.

Yet—

Repeated failures forced him to accept reality:

He simply had no affinity with the Aurora Magnetic Sea before him. Some things couldn't be forced.

"At least there's still the jade talisman," Zhang Jing muttered with a self-deprecating yet relieved smile. "There will be opportunities to cultivate it in the future."

After all.

His current cultivation level being insufficient didn't mean it would always remain so.

Half a day later.

Inside the stone house.

Qiu Xiuming stared at Zhang Jing with excitement, tightly gripping his sleeve as if afraid he might vanish the moment he let go.

"Junior Brother, are you still going to stare at that damned lake?" he asked nervously.

Hearing this.

A strange expression flashed across Zhang Jing's face.

Damned lake?

Senior Brother Qiu really dared to say that!

But since he hadn't noticed anything unusual about the Aurora Magnetic Sea, it meant they simply had no connection.

There was no need to explain further.

Zhang Jing didn't argue.

He smiled and replied, "Senior Brother, that place holds no more meaning for me. I won't be going back."

Opposite him.

Qiu Xiuming sighed in relief, murmuring:

"Good, that's good. You nearly scared me to death."

Then.

He fell into brief contemplation, his eyes flickering as if making a decision.

Soon after.

Qiu Xiuming suddenly looked up at Zhang Jing and spoke seriously:

"Junior Brother, now that you've comprehended Dao Intent, there are some things I can tell you. I didn't mention them earlier because I didn't want to affect your cultivation. This applies not just to you but to all Qi Refinement realm juniors."

"Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."

"Do you know why the Dragon Lake, Divine Thunder, and Mystic Light Dao Academies have opened the Myriad Gods Miniature Heaven at this time?"

At these words.

Zhang Jing first nodded, then shook his head.

He only knew this was arranged for the inner court disciples, but the deeper reasons remained a mystery.

"It's because in three years, disciples listed on the True Spirit Ranking will ascend to the Upper Realm. The three great Dao Academies opened the Myriad Gods Miniature Heaven to give inner court disciples like me—who can't make it onto the True Spirit Ranking—a sliver of hope."

"Dao Intent... to transform the Dao Foundation?"

Zhang Jing seemed to grasp something and asked directly.

Qiu Xiuming nodded earnestly.

"Junior Brother, now that you've comprehended Dao Intent, you can begin preparing to establish a superior Dao Foundation after leaving the Myriad Gods Miniature Heaven. When the Upper Realm opens again in 183 years, you'll almost certainly make it onto the True Spirit Ranking and ascend."

"So you just need to maintain your focus and cultivate step by step."

"Senior Brother, what exactly is the True Spirit Ranking?"

Hearing this familiar term again, Zhang Jing's confusion deepened.

Every mention of Senior Brother You inevitably involved his position on the True Spirit Ranking. Yet no one could clearly explain what it actually was.

"Junior Brother, it's a ranking truly meant for prodigies. It's hard to explain briefly now—you'll understand once you officially enter the inner court."

Qiu Xiuming smiled faintly but didn't elaborate.

"Understood. Thank you, Senior Brother."

Time flowed quietly.

Qiu Xiuming had long since departed.

Yet.

Zhang Jing's eyes still held a trace of contemplation.

Another 183 years?

That seemed ample enough.

As for Senior Brother Qiu's mention of inner court disciples on the True Spirit Ranking ascending in three years, Zhang Jing had no particular thoughts.

Just seeing that only two senior brothers from Dragon Lake Dao Academy had made the ranking showed how difficult it was.

Moreover, both were at late-stage Foundation Establishment.

This suggested the ranking either had cultivation restrictions or was tied to strength!

Zhang Jing leaned toward the latter.

Which was good news for him.

Regardless, he likely wouldn't catch this three-year opportunity.

After all, Zhang Jing still had some way to go before Foundation Establishment.

How could he possibly make the True Spirit Ranking now?

Shaking his head, he dismissed the thought.

Why overcomplicate things?

For now, his only task was to hunt as many demon spirits as possible, accumulate spiritual essence, and deepen his comprehension of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent—striving to perfect it before the Myriad Gods Miniature Heaven closed.

When fully immersed in a task, one often loses track of time.

Zhang Jing was no exception.

Watching the demon spirit corpse before him slowly dissipate.

He suddenly realized something, his expression turning dazed.

Ten days had passed.

In his sea of consciousness.

The previously dim Dao-guiding spiritual light now shone brilliantly.

Connecting with the Dao pattern in his palm.

[Spiritual Essence: 738,500]

"Though the Aurora Magnetic Sea incident caused a shortfall from my original expectations, this will have to suffice."

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

With a flash, he vanished from the spot.

Inside the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault.

"Zhang Jing, here to comprehend the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent again?"

Infant Master tilted its head, asking softly while never pausing its fiddling with the 'transforming blocks.'

"How long have you been trying to restore those blocks, Infant Master?" Zhang Jing nodded, then asked curiously.

Ever since gifting the toy.

Every time he entered the vault, he'd find Infant Master obsessively working on it, as if determined to solve it no matter what.

"Oh, this?"

Infant Master extended a hand.

Zhang Jing was puzzled.

Then he watched as countless crystalline white fingers began sprouting from the outstretched palm, densely covering the arm in a grotesque display.

Even worse—all the fingers curled beckoningly at him.

"See? Been this many days," Infant Master whispered.

Calculating the time.

Zhang Jing's face twitched with amusement.

So this creature had been at it nonstop since receiving the cube? Was a Rubik's Cube really that captivating?

But perhaps this was good.

Infant Master's obsession made his next request easier.

With this thought.

Zhang Jing studied Infant Master, pondering briefly before asking directly:

"Infant Master, I have a question I'd like to ask you."

"Just say it, Zhang Jing."

Infant Master remained focused on the cube, its tiny form flitting about busily.

"Aurora Magnetic Sea."

Zhang Jing said no more.

Just softly mentioned the name of that mysterious inheritance.

He trusted Infant Master would understand.

Sure enough.

The moment the words left his mouth.

Infant Master's floating figure froze mid-air.

Then it fixed Zhang Jing with an incredulous stare.

"You saw the Aurora Magnetic Sea?!"

Zhang Jing nodded slowly.

Silence filled the chamber.
