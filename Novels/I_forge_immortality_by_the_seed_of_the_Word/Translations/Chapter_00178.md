# Chapter 175: Landing on the Island and Its Obstacles

The azure sky turned gloomy in an instant as the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc broke through. Even those on the ground could feel the overwhelming oppressive aura.

Woo-woo—

Faint, mournful howls of the wind quietly arose. In the blink of an eye, they had already filled the entire sky.

On the ground, Zhang Jing's gaze remained fixed on the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc in the sky. His deep eyes reflected a scene akin to doomsday—sinister black Xun winds blotted out the sky, filling nearly his entire field of vision. The heavens seemed to have transformed into a vast ocean of swirling dark winds, surging with towering waves that crashed relentlessly against that faint golden speck.

Even the massive Crimson-eyed Golden Roc appeared as nothing more than an insignificant speck of dust before this tempestuous sea of wind.

The sound of sharp inhales suddenly echoed around him. Zhang Jing instinctively glanced at his surroundings. Most of the cultivators nearby wore expressions of deep shock. Clearly, while they might have anticipated obstacles on the way to Renjie Island, this overwhelming expanse of violent black wind covering the sky was far beyond their expectations.

After what felt like an eternity, a joyful cry rang out. In an instant, all the strange phenomena in the sky vanished without a trace, returning to the previous state of calm and sunshine—as if everything that had just occurred had been an illusion.

Now, the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc was merely a thousand zhang away from Renjie Island. At its speed, it could reach the island in the blink of an eye. Perhaps excited at being the first to arrive, the creature didn't immediately land but instead soared triumphantly through the sky. From below, despite having endured wind, sand, fire, and lightning, its golden feathers remained as radiant as ever, showcasing its terrifying defensive capabilities.

The crowd on the ground erupted in excitement. Seeing the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc succeed on its first attempt, everyone's faces lit up with exhilaration. Some were already eager to try their luck.

But just then, a rational voice cut through the excitement: "Brothers, calm down. Have you forgotten what level of strength that Crimson-eyed Golden Roc possesses? If it can do it, does that mean we can too?"

The words doused the enthusiasm of many like a bucket of cold water, snapping them back to reality.

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing's eyes flickered thoughtfully. Currently, it seemed that to reach Renjie Island, one had to traverse three thousand zhang of black Xun winds, two thousand zhang of Yin fire, two thousand zhang of crimson lightning, and another two thousand zhang of yellow sand. These obstacles alone weren't particularly difficult. But... was it really that simple? He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

After all, every cultivator here had fought their way through a selection of 38 million Foundation Establishment cultivators. Though they hesitated now, it wouldn't be long before they realized that, even if it meant severe injuries, at least twenty to thirty percent of them could force their way through the four layers of obstacles and reach Renjie Island.

As for whether they had the resolve—Zhang Jing had no doubts. The rewards for reaching Renjie Island were the Proud Sun Seal and a hundred million units of fortune. Wasn't that temptation great enough? So why had the秘境的灵 given them ten days? At first glance, the time limit seemed utterly meaningless.

A moment later, as if struck by sudden realization, Zhang Jing looked sharply at the sky. His gaze fell on the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc, still circling within the thousand-zhang space beneath Renjie Island, showing no intention of landing. His expression shifted to one of understanding—there was something strange about this final stretch.

Watching the roc's behavior, Zhang Jing frowned slightly. What could be causing it to act as though it was completely lost? Was there something inherently wrong with that space, or was there something inside affecting its mind? If it was merely a mental influence, Zhang Jing could handle it—his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud's Crimson Divine Light would suffice. But if the space itself was the problem... that would be troublesome.

Time passed. Three days went by in the blink of an eye. Among the gathered cultivators, a significant number could no longer restrain themselves and attempted to breach the layers of obstacles in the sky to reach Renjie Island. Strange phenomena in the heavens never ceased.

Yet, unfortunately, out of the thousands who tried, not a single one succeeded in reaching the island. Most returned with injuries, some light, some severe, resigning themselves to being eliminated from the秘境的 in seven days.

Of course, another crucial reason no one had succeeded was that nearly all the strongest cultivators were still observing. To this day, the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc remained trapped in the thousand-zhang space beneath Renjie Island, darting around like a headless fly. A few other unlucky souls had also become similarly lost in that space.

Faced with such bizarre circumstances, no one dared act rashly. Though the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc had been decisively defeated by Qu Junhou, one of the Ten Elite Foundation Establishment cultivators of the human race, that didn't mean it was weak. On the contrary, its strength was undeniable. If even the roc could be trapped, who were they to think they'd fare any better?

As the ten-day deadline drew closer, getting lost in that space would almost certainly mean elimination. No one was willing to take that risk.

In a quiet corner, Qu Junhou glanced at the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc before turning to Zhang Jing, who sat cross-legged in meditation. "Brother Zhang, what do you think is so strange about that thousand-zhang space beneath Renjie Island? How could it trap even the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc?" His voice carried a trace of impatience.

After three days without a single successful landing, Qu Junhou was growing restless.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sweeping over Renjie Island in the distant sky. "It's highly likely that something within that space is influencing—or even controlling—the minds of those who enter, causing them to lose their way."

Qu Junhou's eyes lit up. "Are you certain? If that's truly the case, then I have nothing to worry about."

Zhang Jing chuckled. "Brother Qu, you jest. If I were completely certain, would I still be sitting here?"

As they spoke, a crisp chime of bells rang out. A streak of cold moonlight suddenly appeared, shooting toward the sky. In mere moments, it had traversed the layers of wind, lightning, and fire, arriving beside the Crimson-eyed Golden Roc. As the moonlight dissipated, a woman of indistinct features but imposing aura materialized.

With a graceful motion, she reached out and grasped one of the roc's golden feathers. Then, as if encountering no resistance whatsoever, both she and the roc ascended effortlessly—reaching Renjie Island in an instant.

Watching this, Zhang Jing slowly withdrew his gaze and smiled. "Well, Brother Qu, now we can be certain."
