# Chapter 13: Arrowtooth Demon

With the Lingxiao Sword and Water-Traversing Boat in hand, Yang Ji finally felt a glimmer of confidence to venture into the vast ocean alone.

After completing his transaction, he left the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.

Next, he purchased some dried food and purified water within the city, enough to sustain him for over three months at sea.

With everything prepared, Yang Ji did not depart from the port. Jin Dafu's words had made him wary: sailing alone might attract the attention of malicious individuals who would follow him.

With this thought, he left Nanfeng City and came to a deserted beach.

He checked the sky: [Clear skies, no heavy rain for three days].
He checked the sea surface: [Calm waters, no strong winds or waves for three days].

The timing was right, so Yang Ji no longer hesitated. He flipped his hand, producing the Water-Traversing Boat.

As soon as spirit energy was infused,
*Buzz!*

Accompanied by a flash of spiritual light, the Water-Traversing Boat rapidly expanded to the size of two people, resting flat on the sand like a beached shark.

He immediately swept his robes, leapt, and settled firmly into a cross-legged position inside the boat.

*Boom!*

With a faint rumble, the two curved cabin doors swiftly closed.

Yang Ji made a single-handed incantation, and the Water-Traversing Boat instantly transformed into an arrow shot from a bowstring, plunging into the water. With a soft *pop*, it vanished amidst the churning spray.

At the bottom of the ocean.

Here were emerald green seaweeds, glowing jellyfish, colorful corals, and countless fish schools—

A vibrant and kaleidoscopic world. The underwater realm presented a different landscape and a distinct aura of life compared to the land.

The Water-Traversing Boat moved slowly forward, like an observer outside an aquarium.

It seemed to drift aimlessly, but in fact, Yang Ji was constantly monitoring the information prompts around him from within.

[One li ahead, a massive Crimsonwood Fish is slowly swimming.]
[Beneath the seabed, a black crab the size of a millstone is hidden in the mud, currently napping.]
[A two-meter diameter water pillar is rolling towards you ahead; the force it contains is enough to overturn the Water-Traversing Boat.]
[The Water-Traversing Boat sped past, interrupting the mating of two Red-tailed Shrimp. They glared angrily.]
[Hidden within the reefs ahead is a school of Silver Shuttle Fish. They are trembling as the massive Water-Traversing Boat passes by.]

As his gaze swept across, various information prompts appeared continuously in Yang Ji's vision, like strings of code.

He traveled a hundred li, finding no demon beasts, no spiritual fish, no ore, only some common seafood that would thrill ordinary fishermen.

Indeed, though the ocean was vast, rich in resources, and abundant in produce, demon beasts were still hard to find.

After all, cultivators with spirit roots were not common on the mainland, so how could the corresponding demon beasts be found everywhere in the ocean?

However, Yang Ji patiently continued his search.

After another five hundred li, night had fallen, and Yang Ji had only managed to pick up two sunken stones.

At this moment, the underwater world was illuminated by various bioluminescent glows.

Glowing jellyfish, eerie blue seaweeds, and colorful spiritual fish collectively lit up this dreamy underwater painting.

As he proceeded, large stretches of reefs appeared ahead, like miniature mountains, visible everywhere.

They were riddled with holes, and deep, secluded caves, from which various sea creatures poked their heads out.

Suddenly, a piece of information flashed, and Yang Ji's body tensed, instantly becoming alert.

[In the reef ahead, a Level 4 Arrowtooth Demon, which emerges during the day and rests at night, is sleeping within its cave.]

A sharp gleam flashed in Yang Ji's eyes. He put away the Water-Traversing Boat and dove down.

Just as he settled into position, preparing to unleash sword qi into the cave, a piece of information flashed rapidly: [The human scent mixed in the seawater has awakened the Arrowtooth Demon. It detected a powerful killing intent. It is startled, enraged, and panicked, and it is beginning to break out with all its might.]

*So sensitive?*

Before he could marvel at the Arrowtooth Demon's keen alertness, Yang Ji heard a *whoosh* as something broke through the water.

He saw water churning at the cave entrance, and a muddy yellow demon beast, shaped like a sea snake, burst out.

Though this Arrowtooth Demon was only calf-thick, its mouth ripped open, instantly stretching all the way to its abdomen.

From its oral cavity to its abdominal cavity, it was densely packed with three-inch sharp fangs, gleaming with a chilling light.

In the center was a spear-like tongue, vibrating wildly like a motor, emitting terrifying sonic waves that caused the seawater before Yang Ji to rapidly tremble, as if boiling.

Its eyes were filled with fierce malice. It spewed a mouthful of turbid,腥-smelling gas from its maw and savagely bit towards Yang Ji.

"Good timing!"

Yang Ji's body surged with battle intent. He activated the Lingxiao Sword and, through the water, unleashed three streams of sword qi.

Following the current, the sword qi surged like a rainbow.

In the water, the Water-Following Sword Qi was as fast as lightning, like a boat sailing with the current.

*Rip!*

The seawater tore apart as the sword qi swiftly struck the Arrowtooth Demon, instantly creating three streaks of blood.

*Hiss, hiss, hiss!*

The Arrowtooth Demon's spear-like tongue vibrated, and its snake-like body quickly twisted in pain. Its biting lunge also halted.

Pain rolled in its eyes. It closed its mouth, twisted its body, and transformed into a water arrow, escaping at extreme speed.

*Splash!* A trail of water spray was left behind as it instantly darted a li away.

"This fellow is fast!"

Yang Ji exclaimed bitterly. Seeing it escape so far, he could only glare with reluctance.

But just then, a piece of information appeared: [The Arrowtooth Demon is severely wounded. Its super-极限 speed has accelerated its life force depletion, and its speed is slowing.]

*Hmm?*

Yang Ji didn't hesitate. He flipped his hand, retrieved the Water-Traversing Boat, activated its formation, and swiftly gave chase.

After a stick of incense's time, he found the dying Arrowtooth Demon inside a reef cave.

Yang Ji's hand rose and fell with his sword, securing a complete demon beast.

This brought him some joy; he finally had a harvest from his trip.

He then set off again.

However, two hours later, he had not found another demon beast, nor even a single sunken stone.

Yang Ji held a map of the Thousand Isles Sea in his hand, his gaze fixed on a red dot.

It was an uninhabited small island, only two hundred li from his current sea area.

He hoped to reach it to find a place to rest and also to search for demon beasts.

Through his previous conversation with Chen De and others, Yang Ji learned that some amphibious demon beasts would appear on islands at night. He wanted to try his luck.

The Water-Traversing Boat continued in a straight line, but found nothing of value.

After traveling two hundred li, he had arrived at the uninhabited island called Desolate Sky Island.

It was late night, and moonlight streamed down, presenting the half-hidden, as if draped in a white veil, Desolate Sky Island before his eyes.

The island was lush with dense, verdant forests, teeming with life. Coconut trees, palm trees, olive trees, and more, thick and tall, cast shadows that covered the sky.

The surrounding beaches were also rendered gleaming white under the moonlight.

With its beaches, coconuts, and shade from palm trees, this place would surely be a holiday paradise if it were on Blue Star.

Yang Ji gazed at the island, steering the Water-Traversing Boat out of the water and onto the beach.

Just then,
*Splash!*

Not far away, another sound of something breaking the water surface appeared.

Yang Ji subconsciously looked over, and both parties froze for a moment: [Level 5 Demon Beast, Overlord Crab. Its two giant pincers are like heavenly shears. Its entire body is covered in a hard shell, with no weak points.]

*Level 5 Demon Beast?*
*Overlord Crab? No weak points?*

He had been observing the island earlier and hadn't noticed the information prompts nearby, leading to this momentary stunned stare.

*Whoosh!*

Without time for further thought, a sound of rushing wind filled the air, and Yang Ji had already drawn his sword and charged out.

Joy surged in his heart; how could he let such a valuable prize escape?

He immediately executed the Current-Following Sword from the Water-Following Sword Art.

Spirit energy surged wildly into the Lingxiao Sword like a torrent, and the sword tip instantly shot out a ten-foot-long sword gleam, incredibly sharp.

*Swish!*

With a single strike that rent the air, Yang Ji's afterimage had just appeared when his flying sword already struck the Overlord Crab's lower jaw.

But!

*Chiiiiiiii~* A flurry of sparks erupted wildly, yet the flying sword couldn't advance an inch.

"Hmm?" Yang Ji was slightly surprised that his attack yielded no results.

The Overlord Crab recovered from its stupor: [Extremely enraged], [Heart and liver trembling], [Retreat], [Flee for life].

However, seeing that Yang Ji's sword could not pierce it, the display above the Overlord Crab's head changed again: [Relief], [Thankfully], [Scared me to death], [Scorn], [Smugness], [Eat him], [Increase cultivation].

*Whoosh!*

The Overlord Crab waved its large pincer, forcing Yang Ji to retreat.

"This fellow has incredibly strong defenses! My full-force sword strike only left a white mark on its hard shell?"

Yang Ji frowned, muttering under his breath, lamenting Jin Dafu's ominous words. His Lingxiao Sword couldn't even pierce a demon beast of roughly the same level as himself.

As he retreated, he finally got a clear look at the creature's full appearance.

This fellow was truly domineering; it was as large as a water buffalo, clad in a bronze-like shell covered in strange patterns. It had eight thick legs on each side, and its two massive pincers resembled deep-sea mouths, with sharp, formidable teeth.

Its millstone-like eyes were wide open, and it occasionally let out a *hiss, hiss, hiss* of intimidation from its mouth, from which saliva was slowly beginning to drip.

"This guy actually wants to eat me?" Yang Ji raised an eyebrow.
