## Chapter 77: Opening Day

On a normal day, there wouldn't be many people visiting Yanji Market when it was closed, but the atmosphere would liven up on opening day. Although it was still early, people had started to trickle in, creating a buzz in the market. Some cultivators and mortals strolled down the street, pointing and discussing the various shops.

"Qingxi Sect's shop is open," someone said.

"Yes, I heard they're replacing their disciples, so they were closed for two market days. They're finally open today," another person replied.

"The people over there must be Qingxi Sect's disciples. They're from one of the seven major sects in Qingxia Mountain Range. It would be great to become a disciple there," someone else commented.

Gu Xiaoqing, Luo Yiping, Shen Zhengquan, and Lu Miaoying couldn't help but feel proud when they heard these comments. Being part of Qingxi Sect, one of the seven major sects, was a prestigious status. Although they were only outer sect disciples, it was still considered superior to being from a general cultivating family or a rogue cultivator.

As people continued to discuss, they noticed the closed shops of Lingfu Pavilion and Lingzhi House. "Hey, why are those two shops still closed?" someone asked.

"Maybe they haven't arranged for staff yet," someone replied.

A young man, about seventeen or eighteen years old, asked curiously, "Could it be that Qingxi Sect is no longer doing business in these areas?"

A tall, middle-aged man shook his head. "No, Qingxi Sect's Lingzhi techniques are quite good. It's just that their Lingfu business can't compete with Fengxia Valley."

Another, stout middle-aged man chimed in, "That's understandable. Fengxia Valley has many disciples skilled in making talismans, and even in a small market like Yanji, they have second-tier talisman masters."

The young man asked, "Talisman masters?"

The middle-aged man explained, "In the cultivating world, those who can create low-grade, inferior talismans are called first-tier talisman masters. Those who can create low-grade, medium talismans are second-tier talisman masters."

The young man asked again, "Can't Qingxi Sect produce second-tier talisman masters?"

Just as the stout man was about to respond, the taller man pulled him back, saying, "Let's go, no need to gossip."

As they walked away, they noticed a young man watching them from a nearby shop. The stout man stopped talking, and they left.

Luo Yiping, who had been enjoying the admiration of others, looked somewhat displeased. "What's Chu Ning doing? Is this what he calls being diligent? The market is about to get busy, and he's nowhere to be found."

Shen Zhengquan frowned but didn't say anything. Lu Miaoying didn't argue with Luo Yiping, as it was not her habit. Gu Xiaoqing seemed about to say something but saw the closed doors of the two shops Chu Ning was responsible for and remained silent.

As the day went on, more people arrived at the market. The fact that Qingxi Sect was replacing the staff in their shops was a significant event, especially for the cultivating families affiliated with Qingxi Sect. Many of these families relied on the sect's outer sect disciples to maintain their connections.

As people gathered, some went to visit other shops, while others discussed Chu Ning's closed shops. "I need to find out if they're really not open. I have some seeds I want to sell to the sect's people," someone said.

"If Qingxi Sect doesn't have talisman masters, we'll have to go to Fengxia Valley's Talisman Pavilion," another person complained.

Chu Ning finally appeared on the street, standing at the back of the crowd. He heard the conversations but didn't respond. "Excuse me, friends, please make way," he said.

However, the crowd didn't budge. Chu Ning had to tap a young man's shoulder. "Friend, please let me through."

The young man turned around, saw Chu Ning's plain clothes, and sneered. "You? You're going to open the shop? You're a fourth-stage Qi Refiner, an outer sect disciple of Qingxi Sect? I can say I'm an inner sect disciple too."

Chu Ning was taken aback but then showed his sect's token. An elderly man spotted it and exclaimed, "Qingxi Sect's token!"

The crowd immediately parted, and Chu Ning opened the two shops. He put up signs: "Acquiring high-quality Lingmi and various spiritual plants. Prices negotiable. Please visit Qingxi Lingfu Pavilion." and "High-quality Yan Huo Fu, Xuan Bing Fu, Chang Qing Fu, Hui Chun Fu: 2 lower-grade spiritual stones each. High-quality Tu Jia Fu, Mu Dun Fu: 3 lower-grade spiritual stones each."

After hanging the signs, Chu Ning sat down in the Lingfu Pavilion shop, arranging some talismans on the shelf. The crowd was shocked.

"Is he in charge of both shops?" someone asked.

"Is he just hanging signs for someone else? He's so young to be managing two shops," another person wondered.

The scene was filled with surprise and curiosity as people tried to understand what was happening.
