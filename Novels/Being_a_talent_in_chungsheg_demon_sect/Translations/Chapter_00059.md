**Chapter 59: An Unexpected Challenge**

Standing before the secret realm, Lü Yang meticulously observed this "Dao Master's creation" while contemplating how to configure the realm to best serve his interests.

‘First, I definitely won't step into the limelight.’

‘I just need to scatter the seeds and wait for them to blossom and bear fruit. If there's no mastermind from the beginning, no one will ever investigate!’

‘Secondly, I don't need a peaceful world.’

‘After all, heroes emerge in troubled times, and one can fish in troubled waters during chaos. Even if a hero does appear and uncovers the truth, they won't be able to stir up big waves.’

‘Because I can simply pit heroes against heroes, and great men against great men!’

Thus, a vast number of settings were input into the secret realm.

The next second, the entire secret realm burst into light, rotating in circles. Within it, Lü Yang seemed to see countless scenes of the mortal world constantly changing.

Seeing this, Luo Wuya proactively said, "Junior Brother wishes to enter the secret realm for cultivation. I shall not disturb you. I wish Junior Brother success."

"Thank you for your auspicious words, Senior Brother." Lü Yang returned the bow. "Junior Brother Lü Yang will forever remember Senior Brother's guidance. Should I achieve success in the future, if you have any requests, please do not hesitate to speak."

Luo Wuya smiled in satisfaction upon hearing this: "Junior Brother is capable of great things!"

The next moment, the light from the secret realm enveloped Lü Yang.

"Quite realistic."

Inside the secret realm, Lü Yang stood atop a mountain peak, curiosity in his eyes. He felt that the surrounding flowers, plants, and trees, everything, seemed incredibly real.

"...But there are still flaws; it's not perfect."

A halo appeared behind Lü Yang's head, and the Grand Clarity Imperial Edict Precious Talisman began to operate, performing divination and deduction. Immediately, he saw through the illusion, discovering flaws that differed significantly from a truly real world.

These flaws were minute, existing only in the microscopic domain. Only with his divination abilities could Lü Yang perceive them. Ordinary cultivators, from a macroscopic perspective, would not be able to see any flaws. As for the "talents" (人材) who had lived in the secret realm since childhood, it would be even more impossible for them to notice anything amiss.

"Rather than a world, it's more like a gigantic stage setting."

The flowers, birds, fish, and insects—everything was real.

However, the "world" itself, which comprised all this, was a complete fabrication, no different in nature from a pigsty in an ordinary rural household.

"So this is the Holy Sect's talent cultivation base," Lü Yang muttered, shaking his head. He ceased his musings and began preparing for his grand "Dao dissemination" endeavor, the most crucial part of which was creating a cultivation system.

‘With the Dao Enlightenment Jade Slip, no wonder Luo Wuya said the Sage Thief Art was very suitable for me.’

Because the Dao Enlightenment Jade Slip, a divine artifact for deduction, could help him create a cultivation system with fewer flaws, making it harder for the local inhabitants of the secret realm to detect anything wrong.

‘The cultivation system cannot be too complex.’

‘After all, with my current abilities, the more complex it is, the less it can withstand scrutiny. So simplicity is best; it needs to be understandable even to a fool, something anyone can cultivate.’

‘But it also cannot be too weak. If the strongest practitioner of this system only reaches the First Layer of Qi Condensation, while it wouldn't pose a threat to me, the fortune that the Sage Thief Art could steal would be pitifully small, which would be detrimental to my own cultivation. So, I should be bold and significantly raise the maximum combat power of the system.’

As he thought this, Lü Yang suddenly understood.

‘Senior Brother Luo mentioned earlier that the True Disciple who was killed by the people within the secret realm probably also wanted to maximize his benefits, but ended up unexpectedly failing.’

‘No, I must set up a safeguard.’

Lü Yang pondered continuously, finally forming a framework. With the help of the Dao Enlightenment Jade Slip, a large number of details were filled in, eventually forming a complete system.

A moment later, Lü Yang made his decision.

Since the Sage Thief Art was ultimately a body cultivation technique, the cultivation system he created should naturally also focus on body tempering. This would make cultivation more efficient.

Regarding physical bodies, the most advanced knowledge Lü Yang possessed came from Yun Miaozhen: the *Grand One Essence Jade Effulgence*.

Therefore, he decided to use this divine ability as his foundation.

With this thought, Lü Yang immediately began to activate the divine ability.

Heart Fire, Lung Metal, Spleen Earth, Liver Wood, Kidney Water...
Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, tendons, bones, flesh, blood, will...

Lü Yang quieted his mind, gathering all the effulgence condensed from his five organs and various parts of his body, guiding it to his Heavenly Gate at the crown of his head, where it burst forth!

A resplendent light enveloped Lü Yang, dispelling all "imperfections" and making his physique as clear as jade.

This was the *Grand One Essence Jade Effulgence*.

At the same time, Lü Yang used the Dao Enlightenment Jade Slip to record all the transformations of the divine ability. Using this as a basis, he quickly compiled a complete system.

"This method shall be called the Martial Dao!"

"Martial Dao practitioners primarily focus on blood vitality. It involves controlling the Five Elements within the body, opening the nine heavenly orifices, and breaking through the Profound Pass of Creation! A perfected Martial Artist... should be comparable to a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator!"

"However, while the Martial Dao greatly strengthens divine power, it cannot allow one to fly..."

This was the safeguard Lü Yang set: Martial Artists cannot fly!

This way, even in the worst-case scenario, if he were to be backlashed by the people within the secret realm, he could simply fly away. Even if he couldn't win, he could at least escape.

He didn't know how much time had passed before Lü Yang awoke from his meditation.

In his hand, there was now a book recording the "Martial Dao".

The next second, with a thought from Lü Yang, the book suddenly burst into golden light, splitting into four in mid-air, then dispersing towards the horizons.

"The pieces have been laid. Let's see what changes the future will bring."

Lü Yang smiled faintly, then turned and returned to the temporary cave dwelling he had opened, resuming his closed-door cultivation. In his cultivation, he still had many unfinished matters.

For instance, he had now cultivated the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, the Profound Yin Form-Seizing Grand Law, and the Grand Clarity Imperial Edict Precious Talisman – all three divine abilities that constitute the *Grand Yin Form-Shedding Corpse Release True Method* were complete, just like Yun Miaozhen's back then. However, he still had no clue how to integrate them.

This wasn't because he didn't know the method.

In fact, the final step of the *Grand Yin Form-Shedding Corpse Release True Method* was incredibly simple; the key was in one sentence:

"One must die and pass through the Grand Yin, temporarily transcending the three barriers. The Grand Unity guards the corpse, three souls fortify the bones, seven spirits serve the flesh, and the nascent spirit records the qi. Only then can the form be restored, achieving rebirth and ascension."

In short, it required "dying once."

To die and then transform — although failure meant true death, success would allow one to shed into an immortal embryo, possessing part of the mighty power of a Foundation Establishment True Person.

This step wasn't difficult for normal cultivators; it simply depended on whether the cultivator dared to gamble on that probability between life and death, and whether they had the luck to succeed.

However, for Lü Yang, this was an insurmountable chasm.

"Because if I die once, I immediately restart!"

Everything would revert to its original state after restarting. What was there to talk about dying and then transforming?

Thinking of this, Lü Yang couldn't help but feel a wry amusement.

All this time, the Hundred Lives Scroll had been his greatest reliance. No matter what danger he encountered, he had the confidence to face it, knowing he could always start over.

Yet, he never expected that the Hundred Lives Scroll would become an obstacle to his further advancement!
