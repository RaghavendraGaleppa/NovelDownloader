# Chapter 64: A Full Sense of Ritual

Two years later, Qin Ming was astonished to encounter the long-armed man here. Too many questions filled his heart; he wanted to understand what had happened back then.

Cui Hong merely glanced at him before rejoining the fierce battle, not daring to let the old elephant notice his anomaly, fearing something might go wrong. This group of mysterious and troublesome anomalous beings had already inexplicably abducted Cui Chongyi. If Cui Chonghe were also captured, he would truly go mad.

In that brief moment, Qin Ming saw a series of emotions flash across his face: surprise, joy, guilt, and more. Why such an expression? Doubt arose in his heart. At the last moment, the long-armed man's expression was incredibly complex, seemingly conflicted. This was not how one should look upon reunion.

Qin Ming watched as his heart, which had been burning with excitement at seeing his savior, gradually calmed.

The path ahead was blocked, and the merchant caravan could no longer proceed. People grew panicked, for a struggle of that magnitude was truly awe-inspiring. When the old elephant roared, the mountains seemed to tremble in response. Its trumpeting was incredibly loud, causing everyone's ears to ring, and they clutched their ears in pain.

To the right of this rugged path lay an boundless desert, dark as an abyss, while to the left were continuous, perilous, and steep mountains. The old elephant's body was as white as jade, radiating Heavenly Light. Whether it was the saber-like flashes from its trunk or the ivory blades attached to its forelimbs, all possessed astonishing destructive power. When they struck the mountain wall to the left of the path, massive boulders continuously collapsed. People suspected that the majestic mountain itself could be carved through by it.

Cui Hong practiced the renowned Heaven-Penetrating Art. His arms seemed to possess the strength of ten thousand jin, and as Heavenly Light erupted, it was as if he could tear open the night sky. He fiercely clashed with the old elephant, showing no signs of falling behind. The human expert and the high-grade anomalous being clashed, their Heavenly Light surging. Thousands of jin of rocks continuously rolled down from the mountain, engulfing the path ahead.

The merchant Xu Sheng secretly lamented his bad luck. How did he encounter such a situation? He led his people to retreat again and again, fearing being dragged into the conflict of the powerful, which could lead to the complete annihilation of his entire team.

"How terrifying!" someone whispered in amazement, while more people were filled with dread. The clash of the two masters actually collapsed a cliff. Amidst rumbling sounds, massive amounts of rocks poured down like a flood, causing towering dust clouds, a truly horrifying sight. Everyone watched with trepidation, their faces pale.

Xu Sheng felt a headache as big as a bushel. Why weren't the two powerhouses leaving yet? They were now in the middle section of the rugged path. They should have left this border region of the desert before nightfall, but now their path was blocked, and any further delay might make it too late. If they turned back and walked the original path, time would clearly be insufficient.

People were startled to discover that the Heavenly Light emitted by the two masters could clearly illuminate the steep mountain walls, but the desert on the right remained profoundly dark. Even when the Heavenly Light shone, it couldn't create a single ripple there.

"Old elephant, I won't argue with you any further. How about we stop here?" Cui Hong spoke.

"Alright, you may leave then," the old elephant nodded. Despite its massive body, its movements were incredibly agile, as if drifting. It instantly leaped onto a mountain peak and turned to depart.

Cui Hong's face darkened as he said, "Since we've stopped, can you release the people?"

"The interrogation isn't finished yet," the old elephant stated.

Cui Hong said gravely, "You should know where we come from."

"Hmm, Cui. Your Millennium Family is indeed formidable, deterring all beings and renowned across the vast lands under the night sky. But we're not bad either. We reside on a famous mountain, barely getting by, and are even called one of your blessed lands," the old elephant responded calmly.

Cui Hong's expression was extremely serious. "Let's talk. There must be a misunderstanding in this matter. We just arrived here; it's impossible for us to have offended you." He feared something might happen to Cui Chongyi and wanted to clarify things as quickly as possible. At the same time, he wished to lure the old elephant away from this place so he could quietly return to meet Cui Chonghe later.

Xu Sheng saw the two powerful experts finally disappear after confronting each other on the cliff for a moment. He immediately shouted, "Run! No, run forward with me!" Time was running out. He led his people to run, not wanting to still be in the border region of this desert when deep night arrived.

Fortunately, everyone was a newcomer. Otherwise, with the collapsed cliff blocking the path ahead, ordinary people would take a very long time to climb over it. They ran frantically the entire way, panting exhaustively.

Suddenly, a thick fog arose ahead. Even though the rugged mountain path was right underfoot, it quickly became invisible. A moment later, even Xu Sheng stopped. The dense fog made him hesitate to take quick steps. If they took the wrong path and entered the desert, the consequences would be unpredictable.

"Brother Xu, what should we do?" someone asked nervously.

Xu Sheng said gravely, "Don't be afraid. We haven't shown any disrespect to the desert throughout this journey; we've been very respectful when mentioning it. Now, whatever you do, don't panic. Those behind, grab the clothes of the person in front, and don't let go even if it kills you! I'll lead the way!" Many wanted to grab his clothes, feeling safer closer to him, but he immediately reprimanded them, "Don't push! If anyone falls into the desert, I won't come looking for you."

In truth, Xu Sheng was also feeling uncertain. The old merchant had told him that one couldn't be considered a true master until they'd experienced over a dozen life-or-death night journeys. Surely, he wasn't about to encounter one now, was he?

Qin Ming remained silent, gripping Xu Sheng's clothes tightly. He had reacted quickly just now, being the first to rush forward. At times like this, staying close to an experienced merchant was naturally the most reliable choice. He feared that someone in the middle might mess up at a crucial moment, failing to hold onto the person ahead, and thus completely lose contact with the guide.

Xu Sheng took out a torch, preparing to light it to illuminate the way. However, he tried several times and failed. Half the team carried lighting implements and tried to ignite them. Soon, someone let out an unnatural tremble in their voice: "Brother Xu, it seems... something is blowing cold air, extinguishing my fire again and again."

"Stop talking!" Xu Sheng stopped the person from speaking, because he also felt a chill blowing on his neck, making his hair stand on end. The fog was abnormally thick now. They couldn't see the mountain to their left, nor the path underfoot. There was only endless darkness; their eyes seemed useless.

Qin Ming stayed silent. The atmosphere was too oppressive and strange. A thick fog had inexplicably risen, obscuring everything. His senses couldn't even extend outwards.

"Brother Xu, no need to light torches anymore! There's a team ahead, they've already lit theirs. Although they're a bit far and hazy, if we follow them, we should be able to get out," someone exclaimed with surprise.

"Huh, there really is a team deep within the fog, shadowy figures. The person leading is holding a torch, illuminating the path ahead." Others also noticed, and their faces showed joy.

Qin Ming could clearly feel Xu Sheng's body stiffen, then tense completely, as if goosebumps had risen all over him.

"Don't look at that torch, don't stare at that team!" Xu Sheng's voice was low as he quickly warned and reminded everyone, "Before we approached the desert, in that small supply town, I specifically inquired. Besides us, no other team set out today."

"Hiss!"

"My Mountain God!"

Everyone gasped in a mouthful of night fog, completely stunned. What kind of team was ahead?

"Damn it! Don't shove me so suddenly! You almost squeezed my soul out of my body!"

Qin Ming's eyes were deep as he saw the heavily shadowed team deep within the night fog. There were indeed many people, their hazy torches illuminating the path, seemingly guiding them, pointing the way. But it was very quiet there, not a single sound.

Including Qin Ming, everyone quickly lowered their heads after a few glances, no longer looking, all obeying Xu Sheng's warning.

"What exactly... is that?" In such a situation, the more nervous some people felt, the more they couldn't help but want to say something.

"According to the old merchant's saying, never mind, I won't say it. It'll scare you to death." Xu Sheng swallowed his words halfway through.

If it weren't for the wrong time and place, several of the stronger newcomers in the team would have wanted to punch him. Wasn't saying half a sentence like that even more terrifying than saying nothing at all?

"Brother Xu, why don't you just say it? You brought it up, then stopped, making us even more panicked!"

"The old merchant's saying, if I told it, would truly scare some of the more timid among you to death. So, let's use the Mystic Sect's explanation instead: it's likely some kind of ritual related to deities currently underway, and we absolutely must not join in. Because neither you nor I are qualified to approach it. If we gaze at that torch for too long and join that team, we will inevitably become a side dish on someone else's table, to be eaten bloody."

Everyone fell silent. Qin Ming also remained silent. On this land shrouded by night, it was truly difficult and dangerous for even ordinary newcomers to travel afar. He hadn't even fully left this remote area yet, and he was already encountering such things. What would he encounter if he ventured into the depths of the vast lands?

"Is there... another explanation?" Some people, the more afraid they were, the more they wanted to get to the bottom of it, driven by curiosity within their fear, wanting to know the truth.

Xu Sheng said, "There's also an ancient explanation: an unfathomable existence in the desert has been offended. This thick fog is its wrath, and that torch is its burning rage. Do you wish to be a moth drawn to a flame?"

Suddenly, he completely stopped, no longer tentatively stepping forward, because he realized he was about to get lost. Besides looking up at the torch, he could no longer discern which side was the desert and which was adjacent to the majestic mountains.

Qin Ming also realized something was wrong, because the left should have been the mountain and the right the desert, but his left foot was now stepping into sand. Xu Sheng had also suddenly stopped because he encountered this problem. He slowly pulled his left foot out of the sand, not daring to move forward.

"Don't push!" Those behind couldn't stop themselves.

"Don't bump into me! Oh, it's a young lady. It's not easy traveling outside. It's alright, you don't need to panic." Although everyone was extremely nervous in the darkness, they secretly despised this fellow.

"I say, young lady, don't be afraid. Why are you clinging to me? Alright, then I'll carry you forward. Put your arms around my neck."

However, the man's voice quickly trembled, saying, "Young lady, why are your fingernails so long? They're chillingly cold. Please don't fumble around on my neck, alright... alright?"

The people who had just been despising the man now had their hairs standing on end. Listening to his words, they truly couldn't stay calm.

"Young lady, say something! Don't touch my neck anymore. It seems... it's bleeding, and it hurts a bit," the man's voice was hoarse.

A youth behind him spoke, his face devoid of color, "Brother, you... you shouldn't speak anymore, I..."

The man asked with a trembling voice, "Little brother, are you... grabbing the young lady's clothes? Can you give me a hand and pull her off me?"

"I feel... like I'm grabbing very long hair..." The youth's voice trembled violently.

The man's voice was somewhat weak, "Someone help me, breathing... is so difficult. My neck is bleeding, and it hurts quite a bit. I can't pry the young lady's hand open; her fingernails are too long."

Everyone fell silent, all gripping their weapons tightly.
