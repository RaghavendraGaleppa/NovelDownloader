# Chapter 30: Who Said He Was No Good?

"Senior Brother Zhuang!" Chu Ning cupped his hands in greeting.

Zhuang Yunde's round face wore the same cheerful smile as always.

"Junior Brother Chu, I trust the spirit rice harvest went well? I'm here on behalf of the sect to collect the required portion."

Chu Ning nodded. "It went quite well. The rice is inside—please follow me."

As Zhuang Yunde entered the house, he grabbed a handful of spirit rice to examine it before nodding approvingly. "Excellent quality, junior brother. According to sect rules, disciples must contribute half of the average yield from their spiritual crops. The standard yield for spirit rice is 700 catties of unhusked grain per mu, with a milling rate of seventy percent—that's 490 catties of rice per mu. For five mu, that would be 2,450 catties total, so your contribution would be 1,225 catties."

Here, Zhuang Yunde smiled meaningfully. "But since your rice is of superior quality, the sect allows for some reduction. Let's make it 1,100 catties."

Chu Ning immediately expressed his gratitude. Given that spirit rice typically sold for about one low-grade spirit stone per 50 catties, this reduction saved him two and a half stones.

Of course, Chu Ning didn't mention that due to his frequent use of the Verdant Wood Spring Technique, his actual yield was 800 catties per mu with a seventy-five percent milling rate—leaving him with about 3,000 catties stored away.

After measuring out the 1,100 catties, Zhuang Yunde produced a leather pouch from his waist. With a tap, the rice vanished inside.

Noticing Chu Ning's curious glance, Zhuang Yunde explained, "This is a storage pouch. Mine is specially issued by the sect with extra capacity. A basic one costs about twenty spirit stones. With your excellent harvests of both spirit rice and ink bamboo, you could certainly afford one."

Though tempted, Chu Ning shook his head. "Too expensive for me right now." This wasn't false modesty—after contributing his share, he had 1,900 catties remaining, worth thirty-eight stones. Spending twenty on a storage pouch seemed extravagant when he hadn't even tried cultivating with spirit stones yet. The potential income from ink bamboo papermaking might change that calculation later.

Remembering the ink bamboo, Chu Ning quickly filled another sack with about fifty catties of rice and discreetly offered it to Zhuang Yunde as he prepared to leave. "Senior Brother, I appreciate all your help. Please accept this small token of gratitude."

"You're too kind, Junior Brother Chu!" Zhuang Yunde protested mildly but accepted the gift smoothly, storing it in a smaller pouch with practiced ease. "I'll return soon for the ink bamboo harvest."

After seeing Zhuang Yunde out, Chu Ning reflected on how the cultivation world involved not just martial prowess but also social graces. While the senior brother had his price, he delivered value in return. This exchange would likely ensure favorable treatment during the ink bamboo collection. Moreover, Chu Ning had further plans regarding their original agreement about the apprenticeship recommendation.

Elsewhere, Zhuang Yunde continued his collection rounds, soon arriving at Yuan Guang's residence.

After completing the standard rice collection, Yuan Guang cleared his throat. "Senior Brother Zhuang, I've heard the sect periodically recommends outer disciples for specialized training. Is this true?"

Zhuang Yunde turned with an amused smile. "Interested in nominating yourself?"

Yuan Guang rubbed his hands nervously but answered quickly, "I was hoping for your recommendation."

"Too late," Zhuang Yunde replied. "That spot already went to Chu Ning."

"Chu Ning?!" Yuan Guang blurted out. "What... what's he being recommended for?"

"Ink bamboo papermaking, naturally. His crop is perfect for it."

"But his ink bamboo quality is terrible!" Yuan Guang protested. "How could he qualify?"

Zhuang Yunde gave Yuan Guang a strange look. "Who told you his bamboo was poor?" Suddenly recalling the initial field assignments, realization dawned. *This Junior Brother Chu is remarkably humble—never boasting all this time.*

With newfound amusement, Zhuang Yunde continued, "Junior Brother Chu has mastered the Verdant Wood Spring Technique beautifully. His ink bamboo is top quality."

Yuan Guang's face cycled through shock, embarrassment, and dismay as the implications sank in. Memories of their recent encounter—of proudly showcasing his purple taro while Chu Ning listened quietly—made his cheeks burn. If even Zhuang Yunde acknowledged Chu Ning's skill, then his own cultivation and farming abilities must be inferior. The thought of other disciples learning the truth, especially after inviting them to witness his taro harvest, filled him with shame.

Under Zhuang Yunde's knowing gaze, Yuan Guang wished he could vanish. He didn't even notice when the senior brother left.

Two days later, when Chu Ning accidentally crossed paths with Yuan Guang, the latter hurried away with a complicated expression, leaving Chu Ning puzzled but unconcerned. His focus remained on nurturing the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and preparing for the imminent ink bamboo harvest.

After finishing the rice harvest, Chu Ning stopped visiting the medium-grade fields. His days alternated between cultivating the spirit fruit in his courtyard, practicing the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, and using the Verdant Wood Spring Technique among the ink bamboo to enhance his Verdant Wood Everlasting Technique.

Ten days later, harvest time arrived. Though processing individual bamboo stalks took slightly longer than rice, the smaller quantity meant completion within days. Eager to begin, Chu Ning didn't wait for Zhuang Yunde's official collection before starting his papermaking experiments.
