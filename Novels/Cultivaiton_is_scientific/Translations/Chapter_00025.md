# Chapter 25: Transaction  

"Fellow Daoist, please wait!"  

Li Shiming was boarding the official ship at a leisurely pace when he suddenly heard a voice behind him.  

If this weren't an official dock swarming with soldiers, he might have reflexively pulled out a white phosphorus bomb from his machine room space and hurled it behind him. Hearing that eerily familiar phrase in a cultivation world sent chills down his spine.  

He turned to see who had spoken.  

The speaker was a round-faced man in his thirties, dressed in a blue robe.  

Li Shiming's gaze swept over the man's waist and immediately understood why he had been addressed as "Fellow Daoist"—there was a storage pouch hanging there.  

This round-faced man was actually a cultivator. In Li Shiming's imagination, cultivators wouldn't deign to travel on ordinary ships.  

Shouldn't cultivators be able to fly through the skies or move with lightning speed? Why would they bother with the sluggish pace of an official vessel?  

"What can I do for you?" Li Shiming asked, deliberately avoiding the term "Fellow Daoist." Siqin, Moyan, and his four bodyguards were nearby, and such a title would sound bizarre to them.  

"My apologies for not introducing myself earlier. I'm Fan Yiyang. Since we're sharing this ship by fate, I thought I'd greet you," the round-faced man replied with a smile, though his eyes held a trace of puzzlement.  

Fan Yiyang was indeed perplexed. Li Shiming was clearly wearing a low-grade defensive robe, a low-grade sword artifact at his waist, and what appeared to be a storage pouch bulging slightly at his lower back.  

Wasn't this outfit practically announcing his identity as a cultivator?  

Moreover, Li Shiming's spiritual energy fluctuations were completely unconcealed.  

Why was he acting as though he wanted to hide his status as a cultivator? Fan Yiyang couldn't make sense of it.  

"Li Shiming greets Brother Fan. Since fate has brought us together, why not share a cup of tea?" Li Shiming replied courteously, offering his name.  

This was his first interaction with another cultivator since achieving Qi Refinement, and he was eager to exchange knowledge with Fan Yiyang.  

"Haha, I won't refuse your hospitality!" Fan Yiyang laughed, pleased with the invitation.  

The two boarded the ship and made their way to the third deck. Half of this level served as Li Shiming's quarters for the next ten days, while the other half belonged to Fan Yiyang.  

This arrangement alone spoke volumes about Fan Yiyang's status.  

Once seated, Li Shiming dismissed Siqin and Moyan. He retrieved tea leaves from his storage pouch and brewed them with rainwater purified by his "Spring Breeze and Rain Technique."  

Fan Yiyang watched silently, though his expression betrayed his delight.  

Li Shiming placed a cup before Fan Yiyang and gestured for him to drink.  

---  

"This tea is truly exceptional for the mortal realm," Fan Yiyang remarked after a sip, savoring the flavor.  

Having spent considerable time in the secular world, Fan Yiyang had long exhausted his supply of spirit food and had been subsisting on fasting pills.  

While fasting pills staved off hunger, they were somewhat costly for early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

This tea, though far from being spirit tea, carried a faint spiritual aura—a rare treat in the mortal world, especially when brewed with spiritually infused water.  

"Brother Li, forgive my boldness, but I detect the scent of spirit rice on you. Would you be willing to sell me some?" Fan Yiyang asked directly, without pretense.  

Li Shiming froze momentarily, then sniffed himself but detected nothing unusual.  

"I've cultivated a scent-based technique, so my senses are quite sharp. Rest assured, I'll pay fair market price—no disadvantage to you," Fan Yiyang explained with a smile.  

"I do have spirit rice. How much do you need?" Li Shiming replied, keeping his expression neutral while mentally preparing a white phosphorus bomb in his machine room space, ready to strike if necessary.  

His previous encounters with cultivators had been far from pleasant—most treated mortals with disdain, and conflicts between cultivators often ended in bloodshed.  

This had left him deeply wary of the cultivation world.  

"Do you have a hundred catties?" Fan Yiyang's eyes lit up eagerly.  

His reason for approaching Li Shiming was precisely this scent of spirit rice.  

Robbery wasn't his intention—his own strength played a role in that decision.  

From Li Shiming's spiritual fluctuations, Fan Yiyang deduced he was at the second level of Qi Refinement—the same as himself.  

Moreover, Li Shiming possessed both defensive and offensive artifacts, and his youth suggested he had influential backing. Fan Yiyang had no desire to risk his life over a bit of spirit rice.  

"I can spare that. But I have a request in return—tell me about the cultivation world," Li Shiming agreed after brief consideration.  

"Haha, perfect! This voyage would have been dull otherwise. Consider it done!" Fan Yiyang laughed heartily.  

Li Shiming channeled spiritual energy into his storage pouch, which contained only spirit rice, a small amount of spiritual water, and tea leaves.  

He had long abandoned mortal food, consuming only spirit rice and water to avoid contaminating his body.  

A sack of rice materialized on the table. Fortunately, they were alone on the third deck—such an abrupt appearance would have shocked any mortal observer.  

Fan Yiyang didn't even need to inspect it; the spiritual energy radiating from the sack confirmed its high quality.  

"Brother Li, I won't stand on ceremony. I've been without proper food for too long," Fan Yiyang said gratefully as he stowed the rice away.  

With a wave of his hand, a hundred glowing stones appeared on the table, followed by a manual.  

"I didn't expect your spirit rice to be of such fine quality. One spirit stone per catty is a steal for me, so I'll throw in this *Art of Concealment* as a bonus," he offered with a smile.  

The choice of the concealment technique wasn't random.  

Li Shiming's unrestrained spiritual fluctuations made it obvious he hadn't learned to mask them.  

While the *Art of Concealment* wasn't a rare technique—most sect disciples mastered it—Fan Yiyang's copy wasn't from any sect but an accidental acquisition. A small favor now could prove useful later.  

"Your generosity is commendable," Li Shiming replied, suppressing his excitement.  

He recognized the glowing stones—they were identical to the depleted ones in his spirit-gathering array.  

So these were spirit stones, the currency of the cultivation world.  

The concealment technique was an unexpected boon. No wonder Fan Yiyang showed no trace of spiritual energy—he had mastered this very art.
