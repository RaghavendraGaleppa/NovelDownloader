# Chapter 182: You Smell So Good

Falling no more than fifteen zhang, the armor-piercing锥 once again drilled into the bluish-black shale, bringing his figure to a complete halt.

*Crack!*

The tiger-tail iron chain swept away a large chunk of the rock wall above.

Xu Yunfan tightened his waist and abdomen, stomped his foot, and swung through the air to evade the fatal blow. The thunder-patterned steel chain scraped a spiral groove into the rock wall as it tugged.

Suddenly, his gaze sharpened. Five zhang below, a half-rotten wooden plank path stretched across the void. Between the broken mortise and tenon joints, a rusted pickaxe was stuck.

This place was a sheer cliff, yet there were traces of human activity. Judging by the marks, it was likely built specifically to harvest the lingzhi mushrooms and medicinal herbs growing on the vertical face.

The spine of the腐尸虎妖 suddenly produced a sound like a bowstring vibrating. Its rotting body clung to the rock and shot up like a gecko climbing a wall.

Xu Yun果断 leaped, landing lightly on a section of the rotten wooden path. His footwork was so light that he didn't even crack the decaying wood beneath him.

It seemed that reaching perfection in "Flying Leg" provided an immense boost to his lightness skill. Even with him and his weapons weighing nearly seven hundred catties combined, he was as light as a drifting catkin.

Just as he thought this, the tendons in Xu Yunfan's ankles suddenly contracted like springs. As he exerted force through his soles, fine cracks suddenly burst forth from within the rotten wood!

As the seven-hundred-cattie weight pressed down, the hollowed-out holes inside the elm board collapsed with a rumble.

"Damn..."

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. He twisted his waist and hips into a reverse arch in mid-air. The chain rings of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer clattered taut.

The hammer's barbed head dug deep into the rock layer above, turning him instantly into a swinging weight on an iron chain.

*Crack!*

The crisp sound of the bronze cage in his other hand knocking against the rock wall echoed. Xu Yunfan's waist and abdomen exerted force like a coiling python, wrapping the hammer chain around his left arm two more times.

Amidst the discomfort of the steel rings digging into his flesh, he caught sight of a half-broken bronze coffin chain hanging seven zhang away and immediately gathered strength to swing.

His body划出 a dangerous arc. The coffin chain caught the weight, and in that instant, Xu Yunfan's right hand, shaped like an eagle's claw, plunged into a rock fissure.

When his fingers exerted force against the rock, a sound like metal clashing rang out. The hard rock fissure was scraped by his fingers, producing a shower of sparks. With a burst of strength, he successfully converted his downward momentum into a horizontal shift.

However, just as he stabilized his figure, a foul, putrid wind descended from above.

The demon tiger roared, its bloody maw wide open, exposing sharp tiger fangs.

Just as the tiger demon's rotting claws were three feet from his face, Xu Yunfan suddenly let go and dropped into the abyss.

The beast couldn't stop its momentum in time and crashed into the hanging coffin, shattering it. Amidst the flying bronze fragments, the barbed head of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was firmly hooked onto an old pine stump five zhang below.

Xu Yunfan's back slammed heavily into the gnarled tree roots, sending wood chips flying everywhere, but he was unharmed. He flipped over and climbed up as if nothing had happened.

He looked up to see the tiger demon tearing apart the tree crown. Dozens of broken iron chains were hanging down like a spider web. He recognized them. Back on a cliff in Qingzhou, the Hu family's ginseng harvesting team had built similar things—they were secret paths leading to underground rivers.

This place must have a rock fissure leading underground.

Xu Yunfan's eyes kept twitching. The special effect of "Dragon Seeking and Vein Distinguishing" caused the light and shadow on the rock wall within his field of vision to suddenly decompose into seven layers of brightness and darkness.

Three zhang to the southeast, there was an irregular shadow. Several rock mice, startled by the commotion from the demon tiger above, darted out from behind the stone ridges. The phosphorescent powder on their fur left intermittent trails.

"Right there!"

His orbicularis oculi muscle twitched violently. The light spots lingering on his retina outlined the direction of the fissure.

The rock fissure wasn't vertically split but slanted into the mountain's belly along the sedimentary lines of the mica schist. The widest part was no more than two palms wide.

The sound of the腐尸虎妖's tail chain breaking the air reached his back.

Xu Yunfan spun and kicked off the wall, his body twisting hard in mid-air to form a forty-five-degree angle.

As the bronze cage in his other hand scraped past the edge of the fissure and squeezed in, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer dragged out sparks and a trail of rubble, forcibly pulling him in. He twisted his direction hard and slid into the earth's veins.

*Sizzle!*

The tiger demon's sharp claws scraped three feet of sparks at the mouth of the fissure.

It dug its front claws into the crack, and foul saliva rained down.

Xu Yunfan's collarbone was wedged between the narrow rock layers. He suddenly bent his finger and flicked the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. A force surged from the hammerhead, swinging it up to smash heavily against the rock ceiling pressing against his scalp.

*Boom!*

Instantly, the entire fissure shattered, dropping a large amount of rubble. A huge stone collapsed, blocking the tiger demon's probing claw.

The tiger demon's roar shook down rustling stones.

Xu Yunfan seized the opportunity to shrink his bones and drop his shoulders. The iron nails on his boots scraped against the sharp rock walls as he plummeted.

As he descended, the fissure suddenly narrowed into a knife-back shape. Xu Yunfan didn't panic in the slightest. He suddenly inhaled and sucked in his chest. The bronze cage scraped against the rock wall with a grating, nerve-wracking sound. He forcibly curled his body into a ball amidst the falling momentum, rolling and sliding through the mossy stone crevice like an eel.

The sound of a mountain collapse-like scratching came from above.

The rubble刨下的 from the tiger demon's sharp claws piled up into a waterfall above his head, but it was stuck in the fissure's rock layers and could advance no further.

Sliding past the stone crevice, his vision suddenly widened. Before him lay a rugged yet spacious cave.

Xu Yunfan反手 inserted the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer's handle into the rock base. Using it as a pivot, he swung toward the water vapor in the darkness. The roar of the underground river thirty zhang deep was forming a natural resonance chamber along the calcite ore vein.

The tiger demon's roar could still be faintly heard in his ears, accompanied by a faint vibration from the mountain body.

However, Xu Yunfan was certain that the tiger demon couldn't get in.

If it weren't for the fact that the "Lamp Holder" of Beimang Mountain was still around, and who knows how many people were in this mountain peak, he would have really liked to drop his guard and fight this demon beast head-on.

He gently landed by the underground river. Relying on the faint lava-like luster diffused from the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, stimulated by his blood energy, Xu Yunfan's eyesight allowed him to see the entire environment clearly.

It was dark, but safe.

Only then did Xu Yunfan place his attention on the ginseng baby inside the bronze cage he was holding in his left hand.

He placed the bronze cage on a nearby stone and knelt on one knee half a zhang in front of it, sticking the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer beside him. The treasure artifact still emitted a lingering lava-like halo.

The ginseng baby curled up at the bottom of the cage was no more than three chi tall. Its entire body was covered in blue and purple bruises, clearly caused by Xu Yunfan's frantic leaping earlier, which made it tumble violently inside the cage and collide with the bronze spikes set within.

Upon closer inspection, Xu Yunfan noticed that this ginseng baby had a粉雕玉琢 appearance. Under its white, tender skin, faint golden patterns like ginseng roots were visible. Bright red ginseng seeds twined amidst its black hair, flickering with its breath. Each seed looked like amber soaked in beeswax. Its little face was extremely adorable.

If not for the ginseng roots extending from its limbs, anyone who didn't know better would think it was a pocket-sized doll from somewhere.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously leaned closer. As his nostrils flared, a strange fragrance钻入 them, making him unable to help but feel a surge of energy.

Until it suddenly flipped over, revealing a mouthful of serrated teeth, and bared them at Xu Yunfan's approaching face, letting out a hissing sound like an agitated stray cat.
