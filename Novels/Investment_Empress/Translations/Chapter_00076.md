## Chapter 76: Li Mo vs. Wang Hao

On the mountain path not far from the Council Hall on Qingyuan Main Peak.

"Young Master, Sect Master Shangguan has summoned us for a meeting," the Helmsman said softly, bowing his head.

"The Qingyuan Sect... truly, things have changed, and people are no longer the same," the Blood-robed Young Master of the Crimson Whale Gang sighed, gazing down at the vast and misty Qingyuan mountain range, as if struck by a sudden realization.

"In what way does Young Master speak?" the Helmsman asked, slightly puzzled. The Gang Leader had only instructed him to show utmost respect to this mysterious young master, without revealing much else. He naturally assumed the young man was either a scion from a prominent aristocratic family in the Eastern Barrens or the son of a powerful figure from another prefecture. From the Young Master's words, it seemed he had visited the Qingyuan Sect before?

"In every way," the Blood-robed Young Master replied, walking ahead with his hands clasped behind his back. He seemed to be in a good mood today, willing to elaborate. "What do you think of the current Crimson Whale Gang?"

"Our Crimson Whale Gang has numerous disciples, our eyes and ears are spread throughout Ziyang Prefecture, and wherever the Crimson Whale Flag goes, it commands the jianghu. Naturally, we are flourishing," the Helmsman said, a hint of pride in his voice.

"Heh..." The Blood-robed Young Master neither confirmed nor denied, then casually asked, "How does it compare to the current Qingyuan Sect?"

"Not far off," the Helmsman, a man of straightforward character, replied. In terms of jianghu influence, the Qingyuan Sect couldn't even catch up to the Crimson Whale Gang. It was only after witnessing the abundance of talent at today's Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meet that he gave such an "not far off" assessment; otherwise, he would have deemed them evenly matched.

"What if I told you that, in the past, any single peak of the Qingyuan Sect could have crushed the Crimson Whale Gang with a snap of a finger?"

"This..." The Helmsman was greatly startled. He had heard of the Qingyuan Sect's past glory, but not to such an extent.

Without waiting for his reply, the Blood-robed Young Master gestured with a casual sweep of his hand. "Look at these nine peaks of Qingyuan."

"Weapon forging, alchemy, beast taming, scripture compilation, discipline, commerce, cultivation — every aspect is fully equipped."

"Tell me, which other sect under heaven is so comprehensively capable?"

The Helmsman pondered thoughtfully. All sects under heaven had their specializations. Those skilled in alchemy were known for alchemy, and those in artifact refining made their name through it; each had their unique expertise. A sect like Qingyuan, which delved into all these paths, was indeed rare. Was the Blood-robed Young Master talking about the secret to Qingyuan Sect's enduring prosperity? Yet, it didn't quite seem so.

"You honor us with your presence. Please forgive our failure to greet you sooner," a giant man, like an iron pagoda, stood ahead, cupping his hands in greeting. It was Fútú. Beside him stood the Ziyang Prefecture Lord and Elder Yin Huaxuan of the Treasured Beast Peak.

"To have several esteemed individuals greet us is an honor for my Crimson Whale Gang; how could there be any talk of neglect?" The Crimson Whale Gang's Helmsman returned the bow. He was somewhat flattered, but seeing the Ziyang Prefecture Lord present, he understood.

The group walked together towards the Council Hall. Upon entering, they saw people from various major and minor sects already present. Shangguan Wencang sat high on the main seat, still dressed like an old farmer. He was currently puffing on his dry pipe, his gaze sweeping over everyone through the smoke, emanating an air of profound majesty.

Once everyone had arrived, he slowly began, "Everyone should be familiar with the Misty Rain Pavilion's Boundless Trial."

"Not long ago, a disciple from our sect, while on duty down the mountain, seized a Hall Swallow." As he spoke, an iron swallow figurine clattered onto the long table with a crisp sound. Many in the hall furrowed their brows.

Each Boundless Trial inevitably caused trouble. Although it was an event for the Misty Rain Pavilion to select and train assassins, it always led to considerable chaos. There were never few who wished to fish in troubled waters.

"This is a matter I reported," the Prefecture Lord said loudly, rising to his feet. "The Prefecture City is the throat of the prefecture; it cannot fall into chaos. Therefore, I implore all of you to lend a hand."

Everyone nodded, willing to help, then turned their gaze to the main seat. Shangguan Wencang tapped his pipe, then slowly stated, "My Qingyuan Sect will send several True Disciples and one Elder to assist."

"This... isn't that too few people?" "Which disciples and which elder does Sect Master Shangguan intend to send?"

The middle-aged scholar from Burning Jade Forest spoke. Shangguan Wencang glanced at him. "As for disciples, we'll choose the top few from the Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meet. As for an Elder..." "Shang Wu just volunteered to take up the task."

*Hiss...* A chorus of sharp intakes of breath echoed through the hall. The Ziyang Prefecture Lord's expression stiffened. Shang Wu was far more terrifying than the Boundless Trial itself.

In the afternoon, the Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meet continued as scheduled.

Earlier, Li Mo had encountered Wang Hao in the mess hall. The specific details were somewhat cliché, so to summarize: "Have you ever seen a 'black hand'?" "Don't let me run into you on the arena stage, or I'll snatch your Scarlet Heaven Sword away!" That was essentially the gist of it.

Li Mo noticed that Wang Hao seemed quite keen on getting the Scarlet Heaven Sword, but the man himself didn't appear to be particularly skilled in swordsmanship?

And guess what happened. During the afternoon's draw, the very first pair to be called were these two.

"Inner Sect Disciple Wang Hao, versus True Disciple Li Mo of Qunyu Peak!" Qian Bufan announced, holding two waist tokens, his voice exceptionally loud.

Wang Hao was considered one of the top eight disciples closest to the high standards of past Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meets, and his cultivation realm could be said to be among the highest in this martial meet. Most Spirit Contemplation Realm disciples had long since exceeded the age limit. Not to mention Spirit Contemplation, even Profound Core Realm cultivators were extremely rare in the martial meet.

"Heh heh..." Wang Hao landed heavily on the arena stage, his Inner Breath Jade Liquid Realm aura fully displayed, his arrogance surging. He stared at Li Mo with cold eyes, his fists clenching with an audible *crunch*.

Across from him, Li Mo also stepped onto the stage. The atmosphere in the entire arena grew somewhat fervent. Seeing Wang Hao's demeanor, it was as if he wanted to devour Li Mo alive. "This time, there's no way he can rely on connections, right?" The True Disciple Li, whose opponents had conceded three times in a row, surely had to make a move this round.

Moreover, to outsiders, Wang Hao was in the Inner Breath Jade Liquid Realm, while Li Mo was only in the Qi-Blood Realm. The difference in realms was quite significant.

On the high platform, the elders lowered their gazes, pondering slightly. They didn't doubt Li Mo's combat prowess, but Wang Hao was a full realm higher than Li Mo. It felt a bit like a stronger bullying a weaker opponent.

"This won't be an easy fight." "If Ying Bing activates her astonishing bloodline, she might be able to fight at Qi-Blood Completion against an Inner Breath Jade Liquid practitioner." As the elders discussed, Shang Wu's gaze fell upon Li Mo. She hadn't paid much attention to her disciple's progress for a long time. Yet, she harbored a strange, inexplicable confidence, a feeling that came from nowhere, as if... her precious disciple had a significant advantage?

"Junior Brother Li is awesome! Go, Junior Brother Li!" Xiao Qin shouted loudly.

Beside him, Lin Jiang and Murong Xiao felt a bit embarrassed; Xiao Qin's shout had instantly made the three of them the target of all attention. Xiao Qin even turned back to ask, "Why aren't you guys shouting?"

"Brother Li will definitely win, so... we probably don't need to cheer him on, right?" Lin Jiang whispered.

"This draws too much attention," Murong Xiao wished he could find a crack in the ground to hide in.

"But if we don't shout, how will everyone know we didn't rig the match?" Xiao Qin's single sentence woke them from their stupor.

The two leaned back slightly, a sudden flash of realization striking their hearts. And so, "Brother Li is mighty!" "Brother Li will surely win!" When all three shouted together, it didn't seem quite so embarrassing.
