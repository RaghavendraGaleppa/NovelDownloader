Chapter 12: The Youth Tournament!

"It's a very rare skill, not something that can be achieved through mere effort," Tian Ling explained.

Zhou Tian smiled faintly. What kind of place was this? This was the imperial capital, the heart of the Tianqin Empire. Countless people scrambled to get here; what kind of genius wouldn't be found here?

Turning back to the arena, the person engulfed by lightning gripped a lightning dragon with his fist. The lightning dragon let out an earth-shattering roar, rushing straight towards the other person. Boom!

The lightning divine dragon collided with the Primordial Divine Mountain. Dazzling blue lightning dispersed, and the earthy yellow Primordial Divine Mountain was covered in cracks. The person beneath the Primordial Divine Mountain changed expression. He swelled with energy, and streaks of runes emanated. Earthy yellow runic chains coiled around his entire body, forming a large yellow bell that enveloped him completely. This was his Earth Store Divine Ability, possessing astonishing defensive power. The Primordial Divine Mountain shattered, but the lightning dragon's momentum didn't diminish. Lightning filled the void, and the arena trembled...

Just as the lightning dragon was about to strike the yellow great bell, a "dong dong" knock on the door interrupted them.

Hearing the knock, Zhou Tian was momentarily startled. Why would someone be knocking? But in a moment, he realized. It must be the people from Heaven Room No. 1, who had learned that Heaven Room No. 2 also had occupants, coming over to say hello. He had originally planned to go over and greet them later, but he didn't expect them to come first.

He rose from the sofa, gesturing for Ziyuan to open the door. Tian Ling also stood up, standing by his side.

The door opened. Standing outside was a young man dressed in splendid golden robes. A golden crown held his hair. He was roughly the same height as Zhou Tian, with sword-like eyebrows and star-like eyes; his gaze was brilliant, as if containing the sun, moon, and stars. His demeanor was exceptional. Behind him followed a stern-faced attendant.

After seeing Zhou Tian standing in the hall, the young man smiled and walked in, saying, "My subordinates reported that someone has arrived in Room No. 2. I was curious which esteemed Prince had the leisure to visit, and it turns out to be the Qin King's Heir!"

Zhou Tian also smiled and replied, "Third Prince, you jest. How could I have any leisure? I can't cultivate and have nothing to do all day. It just so happens that Ling'er came to the imperial capital, so I brought her to sightsee." He subtly upgraded the address to 'Ling'er'. This young man was precisely the current Qin Emperor's third son, Zhou Xunchuan. By age, Zhou Tian would have to call him an elder cousin.

Zhou Xunchuan smiled, showing no reaction to Zhou Tian's words. What if he couldn't cultivate? In this world, it wasn't just strength that could earn respect or fear; status could too. Zhou Xunchuan turned his gaze to Tian Ling by Zhou Tian's side. Tian Ling curtsied lightly, saying softly, "Greetings, Third Prince!"

Zhou Xunchuan nodded, saying, "This must be Miss Tian Ling. Zhou Tian truly has good fortune. Soon enough, she'll be addressed as the Heir Consort, won't she?" Zhou Xunchuan was a legitimate prince and very well-informed. Although the official imperial decree hadn't been issued yet, the news of Zhou Tian's granted marriage was no longer a secret among the imperial family's younger generation. Meanwhile, Ziyuan, who was standing with her head lowered, subtly shifted her gaze.

"Third Brother, your purpose for coming here today is for that eighty-win streak level battle, right?" Zhou Tian saw Tian Ling's flustered expression, not knowing how to reply, and changed the topic. Compared to someone like Zhou Xunchuan, who had been raised in the imperial family, Tian Ling was still too naive.

"Brother Tian, you're quite protective of her," Zhou Xunchuan said meaningfully. He clearly saw Zhou Tian's intention but didn't dwell on it, continuing, "That was just a formal greeting. Now that we're chatting privately, there's no need to be so formal with our addresses. You're right. I came today precisely for that battle. Imperial brothers, Father, and Uncles are only interested in the ninety-win streak level battles. I can't compete with them for those, so I can only come to observe the eighty-win streak level ones."

Zhou Xunchuan let out a bitter laugh and sat down on the sofa with Zhou Tian. The attendant stood behind him. Ziyuan, with keen awareness, had already closed the projection array and stood to the side. It was unknown who won or lost that battle, and by now, no one was paying attention to it anymore.

"I've been following one of the participants for a long time; I feel he has quite a bit of potential. If he wins today's battle, I intend to recruit him into my command."

Zhou Tian smiled. "Then I wish Third Brother's hopes come true!"

Zhou Xunchuan sighed and said, "It's not that simple. At this level of win streaks, every person has gone through trials of mountains of corpses and seas of blood. I'm not even sure he can win." He shifted the topic and said to him, "Enough about me, Brother Tian. Have you seen any promising prospects? The Youth Tournament is coming up soon. You could have someone participate to boost your prestige."

Zhou Tian waved his hand, saying, "No, thanks, Third Brother. I'm not interested in these things. But what exactly is this 'Youth Tournament' you're talking about?" He heard an unfamiliar term and found no relevant records in the original body's scattered memories.

"You don't know?" Zhou Xunchuan asked in surprise, as if not knowing about this matter was incredibly unbelievable. Even Tian Ling, standing nearby, looked at him with a strange expression.

"No," Zhou Tian honestly shook his head.

"Perhaps you haven't paid attention to these matters before. Why don't you let your future Heir Consort explain it to you?" Zhou Xunchuan didn't dwell on it too much; he knew Zhou Tian couldn't cultivate and might not pay much attention to such things, so he teased him.

Zhou Tian turned to look at Tian Ling. Tian Ling was a little embarrassed at this moment, perhaps due to Zhou Xunchuan's words. But seeing Zhou Tian look at her, she still organized her thoughts and carefully explained, "The Youth Tournament is an official competition hosted by the Empire. It has been passed down for many years, held every four years, and is open to all races between the ages of 16 and 22. Due to its long history and widespread fame, even young people from other great continents attend. In each session, some will rise to fame, while those who only have a false reputation will reveal their true colors. It is a rare and grand event!"

"Yes, exactly," Zhou Xunchuan nodded and said. "However, in recent years, its nature has changed somewhat. Every year, top talents from other continents come to flaunt their power, which means we imperial family members might also have to participate. My two imperial brothers are also rushing back, and your two elder brothers should already be on their way," Zhou Xunchuan said.

"Oh, wasn't it said to be for ages 16 to 22? Shouldn't my elder brothers have passed that age already?" Zhou Tian was startled. When his two elder brothers were dominating, he was still too young to remember. No matter how he looked at it, this Youth Tournament seemed to have nothing to do with them.

"The tournament has a special reserved segment. At that time, top talents from other continents will come to provoke, and most of them are from the same era as the imperial brothers, so they are being brought back to hold the fort."
