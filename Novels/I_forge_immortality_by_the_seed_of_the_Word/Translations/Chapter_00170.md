# Chapter 167: The Boiling Land

The thunderous sounds of collapse and destruction echoed endlessly. 

Terrifying cracks spread inward from all directions, gradually devouring the massive arena. What was particularly strange was that the collapsing edges seemed governed by some special rule—any cultivator who fell into those areas would find all their flying and movement techniques rendered useless, doomed to plummet downward until eliminated.

On the ground, tens of thousands of radiant beams crisscrossed, dyeing entire mountain ranges and valleys in dazzling colors. From above, one could see these seemingly chaotic lights all converging toward a single destination—the very center of the arena.

Yet at this moment, a figure wreathed in brilliant golden light walked forward at a leisurely pace, covering dozens of feet with each step as if teleporting.

"Tsk, why rush inside so frantically? We'll all get there eventually," Zhang Jing muttered to himself, shaking his head.

The central area of the arena now could hardly be called a slaughterhouse, but it wasn't far off. Going there now would mean facing wave after wave of desperate attacks from those still without Cloudpride Tokens—nothing but unnecessary trouble with no real benefit. After all, one token was enough. 

As for collecting more...

Zhang Jing recalled the guardian spirit of the secret realm he'd seen earlier. Would it allow such a thing? Could extra tokens even be taken out? He had his doubts.

As he pondered, Zhang Jing glanced back. The arena's boundaries continued shrinking inward.

"About five hundred li per day," he estimated. "Meaning on the final day, everyone will be forced into an area perhaps only a hundred li across—maybe even smaller. Those who got lucky with tokens but lack real strength will be eliminated then."

A faint smile flickered across his eyes. The rules of this first trial were now crystal clear. Through this, Zhang Jing felt he'd glimpsed something of the secret realm guardian's—or rather, the Cloudpride Secret Realm's—nature.

"So I was wrong from the start," he realized. 

There was no room for luck in the Cloudpride Secret Realm. The only thing participants could rely on was strength—nothing else.

This was undoubtedly the best news for him.

Time passed steadily. 

Five days remained until the first trial's conclusion. The arena had shrunk to less than a quarter of its original size, and the number of cultivators had similarly dwindled. A frenzied atmosphere permeated the battleground, with violent surges of chaotic mana erupting incessantly.

Save for a very few exceptions, most Cloudpride Tokens had changed hands multiple times.

At the foot of a mountain near the periphery—

*Snap!*

The Radiant Treasure River shimmered with five-colored light as Zhang Jing wielded it like a whip. Its tip spanned hundreds of feet in an instant, striking like a vicious serpent to intercept a fleeing female cultivator. 

A flash of white light—her figure vanished.

"Tch, what a bother."

He'd lost count of how many he'd eliminated like this. Zhang Jing had no desire to fight, but these people clung to him like flies—persistent, annoying. And as time passed, they grew increasingly desperate. The dazzling golden glow surrounding him made him an irresistible target.

Just as he prepared to continue—

His footsteps halted. 

Zhang Jing turned toward his right front. A dozen breaths later, a golden-cloaked man looking rather worse for wear burst into view. Spotting Zhang Jing's radiant aura, the man's eyes flickered with hesitation before hardening with resolve.

Taking a deep breath, the man abruptly changed direction and rushed toward Zhang Jing while shouting:

"Fellow Daoist! They're after your Cloudpride Token—run!"

The pursuing crowd of several dozen froze momentarily upon noticing Zhang Jing's golden glow. Then, a portion immediately redirected their malice toward him.

Watching this unfold, Zhang Jing narrowed his eyes.

"How about joining us, Fellow Daoist?" a black-robed middle-aged man suggested with a pleased smile. "By our rules, you'd surrender your token now. When this round ends, we'll redistribute them fairly—guaranteeing everyone advances."

Beside him, a gaunt man with cold eyes added: "The arena's in chaos now. Besides the central zone, nowhere is safe. Carrying a token alone is too dangerous." 

Pausing to let this sink in, the gaunt man continued: "Your best option is joining us! Together we'll find more tokens—you'll get yours eventually. Of course..."

His voice turned icy. "If you refuse, just leave the token behind. We're only looking out for your safety."

With a wave of his hand, twenty cultivators stepped forward in unison, their combined pressure rolling toward Zhang Jing like tidal waves.

Zhang Jing's calm gaze swept over them before settling on the black-robed leader.

"You're saying the central area is peaceful now?" he asked curiously.

"Indeed," the leader replied confidently. "The past two days saw terrifying talents gathering there. No one dares cause trouble."

"I see."

Understanding dawned in Zhang Jing's mind. The initial chaos at the center must have settled—perfect for some peace and quiet.

A bright smile blossomed across his face. "Thank you for the information," he said sincerely, his grateful eyes sweeping over the group.

The black-robed man suddenly felt an indescribable dread. 

Looking up in horror, his pupils reflected an enormous five-colored palm descending slowly. The rotating interplay of Five Elements Dao Intent radiated terrifying power.

His confident expression shattered into despair.

"My twenty million destiny points!" he wailed inwardly before vanishing in white light—along with his entire group.

Only a few floating tokens remained.

"Not bad," Zhang Jing mused, surveying the massive palm imprint. "Great for clearing crowds."

Meanwhile, the golden-cloaked man had circled back in his panic. Seeing Zhang Jing unharmed and the enormous palm imprint, realization struck. 

With pursuers still closing in, he made a desperate gamble—charging toward Zhang Jing while calling out:

"Fellow Daoist, why don't we—"

His words cut off as another five-colored palm blotted out the sky. 

The man's expression froze. 

In his peripheral vision, even his relentless pursuers were engulfed by the same attack. His last thought before darkness took him was awe at this display of power—was this the caliber of elites groomed by major factions?

"Annoying," Zhang Jing's voice floated through the void.

Staring at the twelve tokens before him, Zhang Jing sighed. 

At first, he couldn't obtain a single one. Now they practically threw themselves at him despite his indifference. Shaking his head, he collected the tokens and shot toward the central zone like a rainbow.

Days later, Zhang Jing arrived at three towering mountains arranged in a triangular formation, their peaks sheared flat. 

Nearly a hundred figures sat cross-legged atop them, each exuding formidable auras. The constant battles seen elsewhere were conspicuously absent here—an oasis of tranquility.

"We're here," Zhang Jing murmured, eyes glinting.
