# Chapter 434: Another Parting

Inside the Heavenly Work Cave, the underground fire breathed in and out of the black iron furnace, casting the entire cavern in flickering light and shadow.

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped into the forging room, the scarlet fire marrow in the pit suddenly surged, pouring into the casting furnace. The sound of clanging and tinkling rang out incessantly.

Zhan Yan, who was forging iron, didn't even turn his head. The heavy hammer in his hand, carrying the momentum of wind and thunder, slammed down onto the anvil. The splattering sparks, however, suddenly froze three feet away from Xu Yunfan, as if held by an invisible hand, before the tiny flames dissipated into nothingness in mid-air.

"Master!"

Xu Yunfan's voice rang out softly.

This was the true master who had guided him onto the path of martial arts, and Xu Yunfan held him in the utmost respect.

Xu Yunfan gazed at the mottled stone walls of the Heavenly Work Cave, his heart filled with emotion.

If he had missed the Heavenly Work Cave back then and hadn't been seen by Zhan Yan, he might still be wandering the martial world.

Although, with his aptitude, reaching the peak of the martial path was only a matter of time, how much more blood he would have to spill and how many more swords he would have to break along that path was something he couldn't even calculate.

He might even have missed the arrival of the Primordial Origin Sect disciples, completely losing the chance to go to the outside world, and ultimately could only waste his life within the Divine Martial World.

A cause and its effect—who can say for certain?

The flame in Zhan Yan's single eye flickered. The hammerhead trembled slightly in mid-air as he turned to look at the familiar face. He put down the forging hammer and wiped the leather apron on his body with his rough hands. He wanted to rush forward but subconsciously paused his steps.

A smile couldn't help but appear on his face as he suppressed the excitement in his heart.

"You little brat, you finally know to come back?"

The old blacksmith's voice was as coarse as sandpaper grinding on iron, but it couldn't hide the slight tremble at the end. "Has the immortal nectar from the upper world not softened your bones?"

"I haven't even gotten to drink any immortal nectar yet," Xu Yunfan replied with a smile.

When he had gone to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, he had no idea when he would be able to return. Perhaps when he did return, a hundred or ten years would have passed. By then, times would have changed, and all his old friends would be gone. What would there be to reminisce about?

Looking at the knuckles gripping the hammer, those joints that could once crush black iron with bare hands were now swollen like tree knots, with blue-purple veins bulging like earthworms under the wrinkled skin.

Zhan Yan had spent his life forging iron, and now his body was steeped in the aura of metal and fire.

Xu Yunfan suddenly knelt on one knee.

"Your disciple has come to pick you up, Master. I have kept you waiting for a long time."

Zhan Yan pulled Xu Yunfan up at once.

"Alright, what's with this girlish hesitation? I'm not dead yet."

Zhan Yan patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder. "In that damned world, you've borne too much pressure, haven't you?"

Xu Yunfan's heart warmed. Even with his temperament—a man who could kill without blinking, a figure who could be called a demon—his nose couldn't help but feel a little sour.

"Master, I..."

"Enough!"

Zhan Yan picked up a pair of tongs, clamped the red-hot sword blank in the furnace, and was very satisfied with it; it was heated to the perfect temperature.

"Don't say anything sickeningly sweet. Come help me finish forging this sword."

His single eye glanced sideways, the firelight flowing through his wrinkles. "After all this time, you haven't forgotten how to hold a hammer, have you?"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but laugh upon hearing this. He casually tore off his cloud-patterned brocade robe, revealing a torso as if cast from fine iron. Three years of foundation building in the Taihua World had long since tempered his mortal body into jade-like bones.

As his mana flowed, the Black Tortoise Dao Marks flickered with his breathing. Every inch of his muscle shone with a spiritual light like starlight.

*Clang!*

The moment the hammer entered his hand, the aged patina of the hammer handle perfectly fit the memory of his palm.

The arc of Xu Yunfan's swing was flawless, but the sparks that flew from the sword blank were no longer ordinary iron sparks; they were green rays carrying the True Martial Evil Qi.

The fire pit suddenly boiled. The Black Tortoise shadow condensed from the fire marrow actively coiled around the hammerhead, branding a turtle shell pattern onto the sword blank.

"You little brat..."

Zhan Yan's single eye widened in shock, and charcoal dust fell from his eyebrows.

He saw every cluster of sparks freeze in the air to form miniature constellations, and the sound of the hammering subtly resonated with the rhythm of the True Martial Seven Mansions.

What was even more terrifying was that the ordinary iron sword blank was now greedily devouring Xu Yunfan's overflowing mana. Drops of liquid gold, like the essence blood of a Black Tortoise, seeped out from the cracks on its surface.

Forging a weapon with a Foundation Establishment cultivator—even though Xu Yunfan currently knew nothing about artifact refining, because his own cultivation realm was at Foundation Establishment, his Heavenly Work Forging Technique naturally rose to the occasion.

As the shadows of the hammer flew, each of Xu Yunfan's strikes landed precisely on the three-tenths and seven-hundredths mark of the sword blank. The True Martial Evil Qi seeped into the iron blank through the hammerhead. He even extracted wisps of the Northern Pole Demon-Sweeping Qi and the Subduing Demon Earthly Evil Qi to pour into it, actually etching the star patterns of the Big Dipper's seven mansions onto the surface of the ordinary iron.

When the ninth cluster of fire marrow from the pit wrapped around the hammerhead, the entire sword suddenly let out a clear dragon's cry.

*Clang!*

The final hammer fell, and the sword blank radiated a piercing green light throughout.

All the iron tools in the cave trembled simultaneously. The seven ancient swords hanging on the wall unsheathed themselves by three inches, their tips pointing towards the forging platform like subjects paying homage to a king.

The tongs in Zhan Yan's hand fell with a *clang*.

The newly formed eight-sided Han sword floated in mid-air. The light flowing on its blade was no longer metallic luster, but something in between solid and void, like starlight. Seven star acupoints on the blade's spine lit up in sequence. With each acupoint that lit up, the sword's edge gained a sharpness capable of severing heaven and earth, and the sword itself gained a bit more spirituality.

"E-eighth rank divine weapon?"

The blacksmith's voice trembled.

The reflection of the sword in his single eye grew brighter and brighter, until it was so piercing he had to raise his hand to shield himself. This sword was breathing the spiritual qi of heaven and earth on its own!

Given time, it might not be impossible for it to become the legendary ninth-rank ultimate divine weapon that can generate spirituality on its own and transform into a weapon spirit.

Xu Yunfan ran two fingers along the blade's edge. The True Martial Evil Qi and the star patterns blended perfectly. "Your disciple only used a few wisps of the aura leaking from the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil."

The sword tip lightly flicked, and a three-zhang distant testing stone silently split in two, its cross-section as smooth as a mirror.

What was even more terrifying was that the residual green light in the fissure continued to erode the stone, turning the entire testing stone into dust in the blink of an eye.

Zhan Yan's calloused fingers hovered three inches above the blade's edge, never daring to truly touch it.

He had been forging for sixty years, handling no less than ten thousand weapons. His proudest work had only just managed to touch the threshold of the seventh rank.

Now, this eighth-rank divine weapon that breathed starlight was casually forged by his disciple with just a few hammer strikes. The phenomenon it triggered upon completion was even more shocking than the time he witnessed the Divine Martial Sword's birth back then.

The flame in the old blacksmith's single eye gradually dimmed, but the corners of his mouth pulled into a relieved smile.

He was finally certain that the少年 (shàonián - youth/young man) who once sweated in front of the forging platform, swinging his hammer like a raging fire, had long since broken free from the shackles of this world.

Like a dragon trapped in the sea, it could no longer be contained in a shallow beach.

"Master, would you like to try it?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly flipped the sword hilt.

The moment Zhan Yan took the sword, his entire right arm was instantly covered in frost.

What came from the hilt was not the chill of metal, but the pulse of some living creature. However, a single wisp of aura from Xu Yunfan's body was enough to suppress this sword's spirituality, making it as obedient as a dog.

Zhan Yan instinctively swung the sword in a slanting cut. The blade's edge dragged a seven-foot-long green tail of flame, splitting the fire pit right in two.
