# Chapter 309: A Hall Apart, the Generous Madam, and the Clash of Light and Shadow

The hall was dimly lit, and the crowd had quieted down. Li Xian, capable of seeing in the dark, observed his surroundings and felt a vague sense of unease, though he couldn't pinpoint why. He thought to himself, "No matter what, I need to figure out an exit strategy first."

He quietly retreated to the hall's entrance and tried to push the doors open, but they wouldn't budge. The doors were the thickness of three inches were made of strange, dark stone and wood, concealing hidden mechanisms and latches. Once closed, they required a special method to open. There was only one side hall entrance leading outward, and no other exits.

Li Xian remained on high alert. In this enclosed space, if a sudden change were to occur, it would be difficult to guard against. He suddenly noticed a few people subtly moving toward the door. Their movements were light, possessing the skill of light footwork, yet they were dressed in ordinary clothes, like commoners from the marketplace.

Li Xian secretly thought, "There must be something fishy... What do these people, disguised as commoners, mean by this? Could it be... that like me, they are also seeking an escape route, constantly on guard? It's best not to run into them. I'll watch and wait." He stepped in the Seven Star Step and once again blended into the crowd.

Gu Nianjun, Zhou Shijie, Li Xiaofan, Yang Wentian... and many other prodigies stood at the front. Zhou Shijie waved his fan leisurely and said, "This Madam Wang is putting on quite a show. I wonder what the significance is of offering incense in the main hall."

Wang Dezhong said, "I arrived a bit earlier, so I'm more familiar with the rules here. The main hall is a place of purity, prohibition, and reverence; it is rarely open on ordinary days. To offer incense in the main hall, one must satisfy a certain condition."

The prodigies were all curious and asked, "What condition?"

Wang Dezhong said, "One must scatter wealth!" Yang Wentian asked, "How much wealth?"

Wang Dezhong extended a single finger. Zhou Shijie said, "A thousand taels?" Though it felt like a lot, he wasn't particularly moved.

Wang Dezhong said, "Ten thousand taels!" Zhou Shijie said, "Ten thousand taels is indeed a considerable amount, and it's only for burning incense and worshipping the Buddha. Such extravagance is truly startling."

Everyone nodded in deep agreement. Wang Dezhong shook his head with a wry smile. "Brother Zhou, you're thinking too simply. That ten thousand taels is in gold, not silver!"

A clamor arose from the crowd. Yue Kai said, "Ten thousand taels of gold is a hundred thousand taels of silver. That's a truly huge sum of money. Is this Madam Wang so rich she doesn't know what to do with it?"

Gu Nianjun was also shocked. "If that money were used to purchase rare treasures or refine pills... the cost would be enormous, but it would still be acceptable, not so strange. To spend it on burning incense and worshipping the Buddha is... rather peculiar."

"This Madam Wang... I really want to see what she looks like."

Li Xian, with his keen hearing, secretly muttered, "This temple really makes a fortune. A single drop of oil from it would be enough for me to start a cauldron and cook. This Madam Wang seems to be a generous person who doesn't care about gains and losses. In that case, it's not surprising that she's willing to give away the Chaohuang Dew."

Wang Dezhong continued, "I'm afraid that's not all. That's just the entrance fee. Upon entering the hall, she scatters ten thousand gold, and then she must burn incense and pray. It's said that the incense used by this Madam Wang is even more... astonishing to hear!"

Zhou Shijie urged, "Brother Wang, tell us quickly."

Mu Hongchou said, "I've actually heard something about this. This Madam Wang's incense is specially crafted. Legend has it that it is made from the fat of a deep-sea golden whale, cooked and refined into a scent called 'Golden Rain and Jade Dew Incense.' Its value... is likely far higher than ten thousand taels of gold. I heard my master estimate it... requires thirty thousand taels of gold!"

All the prodigies were terrified. "Oh my, what kind of person is this Madam Wang? Such extravagance makes my heart ache just hearing about it." "Thirty thousand taels of gold... that's three hundred thousand taels of silver. Enough to forge how many cauldrons and support how many people."

The commoners nearby clicked their tongues. "Oh my, how many steamed buns could that buy? You could eat meat every day from now on!" "Not just that, you could even marry a dozen wives."

Amidst the exclamations and discussions, the woman had already approached. Her figure was graceful, she wore a yellow dress, her face was delicate, and her head was adorned with gold and silver, exuding a noble and wealthy aura.

Li Xian immediately looked over and thought, "So this is Madam Wang? I see her face is kind and gentle, she doesn't look like an evil person? The Chaohuang Dew is in her hand. Maybe I can really try?"

Seeing her kind face, her wealth not showing arrogance, her benevolent brows and intelligent eyes, she was approachable at a glance. His thoughts immediately became active.

Madam Wang bowed to the abbot and said, "Thank you for your hard work, Abbot." The abbot smiled and said, "Madam Wang has a heart for the world, praying for the heavens and earth, and for the ten thousand people. Such merit will be remembered by future generations. My little effort is nothing to speak of."

Madam Wang smiled slightly and said, "Then let us begin." She flicked her sleeve. Two maids brought over a box, opened the latch, and the "Golden Rain and Jade Dew Incense" was revealed.

This incense was twelve feet and three inches long, entirely golden and crystal clear, flawless and translucent. Its carved patterns were exquisite beyond compare, adorned with pearls and jade.

Wang Dezhong said, "It is rumored that a single deep-sea golden whale is only enough to produce three sticks of Golden Rain and Jade Dew Incense. The pearls and jade inlaid in the incense, having been熏陶 by the incense smoke, as if bathed in the grace of heaven and earth, display a spiritual quality. When the incense is burned out, the pearls and jade on the incense stick will appear as good as new, and are also fine ornaments. With the scent of the golden whale, this Madam Wang has held several temple ceremonies. When the incense burns out, the remaining pearls and jade are always given to others to form good karma. She is truly an incredibly generous and wonderful person."

Zhou Shijie couldn't help but feel yearning and admiration upon hearing this. Another figure quietly took root in his heart. It was said that one could be versed in both literary and military arts, and have three hearts and two intentions... it all fit together quite well.

Madam Wang held the Golden Rain and Jade Dew Incense and offered it forward. The incense was lit and inserted into a special censer. The smoke and mist curled upwards, with threads of gold mixed in the white mist, drifting towards the sky. The hall's ceiling was fourteen zhang high, with small holes at the top that allowed the smoke to pass through.

A bronze mirror was also set at the top of the hall. This mirror was called the "Spirit Manifesting Mirror," a rare and precious treasure with a high price. This mirror refracted light, possessing the wonderful effect of turning decay into magic, and magic into even greater magic.

The smoke and mist drifted to the top of the hall, illuminated by the "Spirit Manifesting Mirror," and as if possessing a divine power, floated out through the holes at the top, merging into the clouds high in the sky.

Suddenly, a "rumbling" sound was heard, and a colorful thunderclap struck outside the temple, followed by the descent of golden jade dew. The commoners bathed in the jade dew, feeling no cold, as if they were bathed in sweet dew, feeling an indescribable sense of pleasure.

Minor illnesses were cured, major illnesses were half-healed, strange illnesses were strengthened, and the healthy became stronger. This "Golden Rain and Jade Dew Incense" touched the clouds and brought rain, touched the mist and brought thunder, sprinkling golden rain upon the heavens and earth, blessing the ten thousand people, and was indeed extraordinarily effective.

Although the prodigies and commoners in the hall could not bathe in the golden rain, smelling the incense smoke also produced a similar wonderful effect. Suddenly, a prodigy, his understanding greatly inspired, began to dance with his sword on the spot to comprehend the Dao, with strange phenomena appearing around him.

The other prodigies all benefited from it. Some sat on the ground to comprehend the martial path, some practiced their techniques to gain further insights. All were immersed in the wonderful charm. Li Xian also had a realization and thought, "If I take this opportunity to comprehend, I am sure to gain something. But it would inevitably expose my position. Since I have already hidden myself here, there is no need to reveal myself. Otherwise, if Gu Nianjun notices me, she will surely find a way to prevent my younger brother from seeing me. This woman seems easy-going and approachable, but in reality, she is very proud. However, she is sincere towards my younger brother." So he followed the crowd, only exclaiming in admiration.

Madam Wang observed the crowd and smiled. "There are really quite a few young heroes today. A glance shows that they are all delightful." The abbot stroked his beard and smiled. "Indeed, just now the talents of the heroes were displayed, and incense was offered to the heavens and earth. It is also quite pleasing to this old man's eyes."

Although the Golden Rain and Jade Dew Incense was "twelve feet" long, it only took half an hour to burn. Several waves of golden rain fell from the sky, and strange phenomena appeared, then gradually ceased. The incense stick burned out, leaving only three pearls and four pieces of jade.

Madam Wang gave them to the young heroes on the spot. Zhou Shijie, Wang Dezhong, Yang Wentian... all received one. She smiled and said, "You young people have a heroic bearing, which is truly rare. I have a treasure called the Chaohuang Dew in my residence. If you are interested, hunt down a snowy mountain spirit fox, and I will give it to you."

Zhou Shijie hurriedly said, "Madam Wang... I have just arrived and am unaware of this matter. Could you please elaborate?"

Wang Dezhong said, "No need for the Madam to waste her breath, I will tell you." He then immediately recounted the matter of the Madam Wang's "Chaohuang Dew." Only then did Zhou Shijie learn of this, and his heart began to pound with excitement.

Mu Hongchou said, "Madam Wang... if a woman were to hunt the snowy mountain spirit fox, what would happen?" Madam Wang smiled. "If there is indeed a woman who is not outdone by men, I would naturally be willing to present the Chaohuang Dew."

Gu Nianjun said, "But that is too difficult. To hunt the snowy mountain spirit fox purely with archery skills, there are few in the world who possess such skill. It is said that the city lord of Feilong City, Lord He, has a robe of snow fox fur, which was made from a snowy mountain spirit fox. He hunted it by chance when he was forty-seven, and it was not purely with archery skills."

Lord He is fond of scholarly pursuits and often visits the "Green Bamboo Residence," where Gu Nianjun spoke with him. Lord He was quite proud of the matter of the "snowy mountain spirit fox" and often mentioned it. As the days grew colder, the snow fox fur robe became useful again. He wore it, looking very noble. This left a deep impression on Gu Nianjun.

Madam Wang smiled. "Young heroes should have the spirit to break conventions and surpass limits. Otherwise, how can they be worthy of my human yellow essence treasure, and how can they be worthy of knowing me, Madam Wang?"

Upon hearing this, the hearts of the prodigies stirred. They had gotten to know each other, their spirits were high, and after being stimulated by this, they felt even more excited. They were willing to try even if there were a thousand difficulties and ten thousand hardships.

Madam Wang's attitude was gentle, and the crowd's courage grew a little. Yue Kai said, "Madam Wang, I venture to ask, of the three conditions you set, two are related to appearance. Could it be... could it be that you have the intention of selecting a husband?"

Madam Wang said, "That is not necessarily. I have a special fondness for men with excellent archery skills. If one were to move my heart and be chosen as my husband, it is not impossible. This young lady is also a woman, what do you think?"

Gu Nianjun said seriously, "Archery best reflects one's spirit. Madam Wang has a discerning eye. Those who can train their archery to the extreme are indeed quite charming!"

Zhou Shijie's face darkened slightly, thinking of his defeat at the Tower Banquet. He had been thoroughly defeated in archery and secretly felt unconvinced. "That kid's archery is not bad, but he had the advantage of time and terrain. If we really talk about the quality of archery, he might not be better than me. I have been practicing archery in recent years, and I might have surpassed him by now. Still... why compare myself to him, a country bumpkin."

Mu Hongchou nodded in deep agreement. "My senior sister also said that to judge a man, you need to see him shoot an arrow. It's not about the precision of the arrow, but the charm of the arrow."

Li Xian, listening from a distance, secretly thought, "This point is a bit similar to my wife's. But that's normal."

Madam Wang smiled. "Alright, let us part ways for today." She led her maids away. Zhou Shijie watched from afar, unable to come back to his senses for a long time. Only when her figure had completely disappeared did he return with a sense of loss.

This trip was a great success, and he was satisfied and proud. The prodigies' excitement had not yet subsided, and they gathered to talk. The hall doors opened with a bang. It was already evening, the afterglow of the setting sun shone upon them. Looking out at the city scenery in the distance, it was beautiful and magnificent. The wind was high and the air was crisp, bringing infinite pleasure.

The temple fair was drawing to a close. Zhou Shijie took the opportunity to win people over, inviting the young heroes to a banquet at a restaurant. The prodigies all agreed, and in high spirits, they went down the mountain. One prodigy suggested a competition of light footwork, which caused a burst of laughter. To avoid hurting feelings, they set the rule as "whoever is fastest pays for the banquet."

The prodigies neither wanted to be inferior to others nor wanted to be faster than others. Their speed was neither fast nor slow, but strange scenes emerged one after another, their figures ethereal and handsome. They all went down the mountain path, and in a flash, they were gone.

Zhou Shijie said, "Nianjun, you come too." Gu Nianjun said, "Alright, you all go ahead. I will accompany Xiaofan down the mountain." She thought to herself, "The one who helped Xiaofan is among the accompanying prodigies. That prodigy is quite unconventional. If there is a chance, I should get to know him." Her pretty face flushed slightly.

Zhou Shijie, wanting both to accompany her and to be the center of attention among his peers, went ahead first, using his light footwork to catch up. Gu Nianjun and Li Xiaofan walked down the mountain, chatting and laughing along the way, their atmosphere relaxed and comfortable.

Gu Nianjun said, "Xiaofan, what do you think of today's events?" Li Xiaofan said, "What do you mean, Sister Gu?"

Gu Nianjun said, "The matter of offering incense. That Yue Kai is narrow-minded and not a worthy friend to make. Are you angry with him, Xiaofan?"

Li Xiaofan said, "Why should I be angry? I didn't even put him in my heart." Gu Nianjun said, "He secretly made you fall." Li Xiaofan smiled. "Sister Gu, I've fallen and tumbled countless times since I was a child. What's one more fall?"

Gu Nianjun smiled. "That's true. Xiaofan has a childlike heart and is never moved by external things. Speaking of which, today's events, in the final analysis, are partly due to my negligence. I only thought about letting you make good friends, but I ignored the gaps between you. Forcing it like this is not a good thing."

Li Xiaofan said, "What Sister Gu said is actually correct. Since I am on a study tour, I should experience more things. Whether making friends or making enemies, it's better than just passing by like a horse galloping past a flower."

Gu Nianjun smiled. "At this rate, in a few years, Xiaofan, your knowledge will surpass mine." She thought to herself, "Xiaofan is worthy of being able to recite the 'Red Heart Sutra' by heart. I have had famous masters teaching me since I was a child, but I still couldn't fully read the Red Heart Sutra. Every time I read half a volume, I would feel dizzy and my eyes would blur. Xiaofan can recite it backwards, which shows that his red heart is firm and not comparable to ordinary people."

"In this world... I'm afraid only his older brother can influence him. Other matters, other people... just like today, have no effect on him at all."

Gu Nianjun said, "Although Yue Kai's temperament is narrow, among the prodigies, there are indeed a few worth getting to know. The situation was special at the time. Even if you were bullied by Yue Kai, I couldn't have taught him a severe lesson. But that person's intervention helped me vent my anger."

Li Xiaofan said, "Who could it be?" Gu Nianjun smiled. "I don't know yet. If I find out his identity, I will invite him for a detailed talk."

Li Xiaofan's eyes curved into a smile, and he teased, "Sister Gu, have you fallen in love?" Gu Nianjun said, "I haven't even seen his face, how could I have feelings? I just think his style of doing things is quite unconventional and rare."

The two quickened their pace down the mountain.

Li Xian followed the commoners down the mountain, feeling carefree and content. He had no interest in showing off his power, making friends, or building connections. He secretly paid attention to Li Xiaofan and Gu Nianjun. Seeing the two walking together, he muttered:

"Gu Nianjun may have many flaws, and I may find her displeasing, but she has at least one good point."

He followed them down the mountain. When they were a few miles away from the Green Bamboo Residence, Gu Nianjun said, "Zhou Shijie and the others are organizing a heroes' banquet. Are you going, Xiaofan?"

Li Xiaofan shook his head. "I've wasted a whole day today. I should go back to the residence and read." Gu Nianjun knew that Li Xiaofan and the other prodigies had a gap between them, so she said no more. She instructed Li Xiaofan to return to the residence, while she would attend the banquet.

Li Xiaofan walked with his hands in his sleeves, his head down. Suddenly, he felt a pat on his shoulder. He turned back and was overjoyed to see. "Brother!"

Li Xian made a "shush" gesture. "It's not suitable to make a fuss." Li Xiaofan lowered his voice. "Brother, was that Yue Kai..."

Li Xian smiled. "You're getting smarter. Come on, they have their grand banquet, and we brothers have our own little banquet."

Li Xian found a small shop by the street and ordered some plain porridge, rice water, pickles, and braised tofu... Li Xiaofan sighed with emotion. "That one stick of incense was a hundred or several hundred taels. This whole table of side dishes costs only twenty-something wen."

Li Xian said, "Yes." He took the opportunity to ask about Li Xiaofan's recent situation.

Li Xiaofan said, "I followed my master on a study tour and left the Qiongfu Prefecture directly. Over the years, I've been wandering around, living a life like a beggar. Sometimes I didn't know if I'd be hungry or full. But overall, the gains have been substantial."

"And my fortune is stable. My master said he has already registered me for the 'prefectural exam.' If I can pass, I can take a step further and gain a thread of fortune."

Li Xian pondered for a moment. "You're on the right path. As your older brother, I naturally support you." Li Xiaofan said, "Let's not talk about that for now. Brother, take this."

He took a cloth bag from his chest. Li Xian was very surprised and opened the bag. Inside were several letters, with elegant handwriting.

Li Xiaofan said, "During my study tour, I helped you find several potential sisters-in-law. They are all outstanding in character and family background. Brother, if you have time, or if you pass by their areas, you can use these letters to meet them. A man should have ambitions far and wide. Our Li family should spread its branches and leaves, preferably all over the place."

Li Xian was both amused and exasperated, thinking, "Your brother's love debts are a tangled mess, and you're still adding to the trouble." He said, "There's no rush for this."

Li Xiaofan said, "Actually... Sister Gu is the most suitable. It's a pity there's no fate between you."

Li Xian said seriously, "Xiaofan, you have sworn not to marry and have a lifelong ambition to fulfill. As your older brother, I naturally support you. To be honest, although I am your older brother, I have been unable to help you in the slightest."

He suddenly thought: "Xiaofan travels everywhere, and it's inevitable that he will travel by boat. I have the 'Kannie Meridian Hand' manual, which I can give him to practice. It might be of some small use. I have already memorized the contents of that book, and I only lack the final comprehension."

He continued, "Xiaofan, I have a book here. Take a look at it."

Li Xiaofan took the "Kannie Meridian Hand," looked it over, and exclaimed in surprise. "The Left Hand Sutra? Brother... how did you get this?"

Li Xian said, "The Left Hand Sutra?" Li Xiaofan said, "This item's original name is 'Left Hand Squeezing River True Sutra,' written by Zhang Zhisong. This is a person of unparalleled elegance, and even my master holds him in the highest esteem."

"Later, due to various changes, the Left Hand Squeezing River True Sutra was lost, leaving only many copied and mixed versions. This Kannie Meridian Hand... judging by its handwriting, is one of the copied versions."

Li Xian said, "So that's how it is. That old blind man lied to me, saying it was something Zhang Zhisong wrote in his early years. I actually believed him."

Li Xiaofan skimmed through it and said again, "It might not be false. Zhang Zhisong wrote a great deal in his life. The Left Hand Sutra is his masterpiece. This Kannie Meridian Hand could indeed be an early work, or even a precursor to the Left Hand Sutra."

Li Xian smiled. "As long as it can help you." Li Xiaofan was very moved. The sincerity between the two brothers needed no empty words. He put it away in his chest.

Li Xian was in high spirits and ordered a jar of fine wine. He drank several cups with Li Xiaofan, and they didn't separate until midnight.

Back at the inn. Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the other three came over to ask. Li Xian gave them a perfunctory answer, and they all believed him, returning to their rooms to rest.

Li Xian took out the "Peach Blossom Bow." The bow was crimson, and the golden string was dazzling. Under the moonlight, it looked divinely martial and extraordinary. The Peach Blossom Tree Spirit was made into a "spear," but because the material was too light, it had many shortcomings. However, it was made into a "bow and arrow," it was very tough and quite suitable.

"That Madam Wang doesn't seem like an evil person. Starting tomorrow, I can try hunting in the snowy mountains. If I can hunt a snowy mountain spirit fox, this trip will be a success. I'm afraid the competition will be fierce. I saw those prodigies also want to go into the mountains to hunt foxes."

"Hmph, if we meet, then we'll have a contest."

Li Xian pulled the bowstring back into a full moon shape. There was no arrow on the string, but his fighting spirit was like an arrow. On the eaves of tall buildings and pavilions, many birds and beasts were standing. They were swept by an invisible sharp intent, their eyes rolled back, their legs kicked, and they fluttered down.

On the other side.

After Madam Wang finished burning the incense and making her offerings, she retreated to the side hall, then went further inside, passed through a flower-lined corridor, and saw an open-air terrace. She heard the melodious sound of a zither, and behind a curtain, a woman was playing the zither with her fair hands.

Her jade-like fingers plucked lightly, producing a wonderful sound that was very pleasant to the ear.

Madam Wang said respectfully, "Madam, I have done as you instructed."

A voice came from behind the curtain. "Was there anything unusual?"

Madam Wang said, "If there is anything unusual, it's that there are more young heroes today than usual."

The zither music behind the curtain gradually stopped. The woman lifted the curtain, revealing her appearance. Her hair was like clouds, adorned with a phoenix hairpin, her face was flawless, and her white dress was like gauze. It was none other than Madam Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang pointed to a meditation mat nearby and said, "Please sit." Madam Wang sat down as instructed.

Wen Caishang asked, "After the hall doors were closed, did you pay special attention to the people by the door?"

Madam Wang said, "I have entrusted my trusted aides to hide in the crowd and secretly guard the door. I saw no suspicious people."

Wen Caishang felt a bit disappointed.

The truth was...

The "Madam Wang" of Feilong City was actually a scheme laid out by Wen Caishang. This "Chaohuang Dew" was originally a treasure of Feilong City's Lord He. Wen Caishang found a way to obtain it, and used it as bait to lure Li Xian.

She was certain that Li Xian already possessed the "Golden Scales" and "Yellow Nine Ginseng," and was only missing the "Chaohuang Dew" for the recipe "Golden Light." If she released the news of the "Chaohuang Dew," Li Xian would definitely be tempted.

She then set three conditions, waiting for him to take the bait. Wen Caishang also knew that Li Xian was as cunning as a fox, suspicious and alert, and would not easily fall into a trap. That is why she created the image of "Madam Wang," amiable and approachable, generous and wealthy, to try to dispel his suspicions.

However, the one who appeared was actually one of Lord He's wives, whose real name was Duan Ni.

Wen Caishang further predicted: "If this boy really wants to get the Chaohuang Dew from me, he will definitely investigate my information beforehand. If he has a chance to get close to me from the side, he will never let it go. I need to give him a chance to get close, and... I must not reveal my true appearance. If he really sees through the clues and flees far away, I will have failed in my plan."

"Even though I am confident, when facing this little bastard, I must not be careless."

That is why she often organized temple fairs and went to Feilong Temple to worship. She also predicted that Li Xian would definitely hide among the ordinary people. This boy is as cunning as a fox. Therefore, she had Duan Ni send trusted aides to hide in the crowd and secretly observe suspicious individuals.

If anyone's behavior was strange and did not seem like someone who came to offer incense and worship the Buddha, they would be secretly guarded and observed. If he managed to avoid all the dangerous situations, and then entered the main hall, the doors would be closed.

Li Xian's cautious nature would make him plan an escape route so he could escape at any time. He would definitely hide near the door. That's why she had Duan Ni's trusted aides guard the door and observe suspicious people. If luck was good, they could capture him on the spot, saving a lot of trouble.

At that time, Wen Caishang would make Li Xian taste the滋味 of betrayal and get what she wanted.

Duan Ni said uneasily, "Madam Wang, who exactly are you looking for? What does he look like? Could it be that even someone like you can't find someone?"

Wen Caishang shook her head with a sigh, her gaze full of grievance. "This boy is too cunning, how could he be easily found? I'm afraid he may not even be in Feilong City now. We need to wait a bit longer."

Duan Ni said with a strange expression, "But this kind of scattering wealth... tens of thousands of taels of gold at a time... tens of thousands of taels... it's a bit..."

Wen Caishang said softly, "You're wrong. This money is not coming from me."

Duan Ni asked, "Then who..."

Wen Caishang said, "Naturally, it will be counted to that little thief. The more I spend today, the more he will have to pay back." Duan Ni said, "What if he can't pay it back?"

Wen Caishang smiled. "It would be strange if he could pay it back. A poor little thief, what kind of wealth does he have? If he can't pay it back, he can just pay it back slowly. I have my own ways of collecting the debt."

Duan Ni felt a slight chill and had heard a bit about her methods. She thought, "This Madam Wang is not as charitable as the rumors say, but the wealth she scatters is only more, not less. This debt calculation is more than enough to buy a life. How can that boy repay it?"

The maid Xiaotuan said, "Madam, the sedan chair is ready. Please get in. The temple fair is over, we should return."

Wen Caishang said gently, "Madam Duan, this matter is not over yet. Please come back to my residence with me."

Duan Ni could not refuse and said, "Alright, I will follow the Madam's arrangement." She knew deeply that this woman not only had considerable wealth, but her methods and abilities were also not shallow. Although she spent a lot of money, she did not neglect other matters. She had already purchased many properties in Feilong City, and her business was on the right track, bringing in a fortune every day.

She heard that there were also preparations for certain things outside the city. She could handle everything, advancing on all fronts. She was truly a rare figure, and her name was not well-known. Her abilities were unfathomable. Lord He had once said that she should not be offended.

The two got into the sedan chair, and four porters carried it down the mountain. The cold wind blew along the way.

Xiaotuan followed outside the sedan chair, skipping along. Passing by the five censers outside the hall, the strange incense was burning vigorously, and strange scenes appeared one after another, extremely gorgeous. This strange incense in the full censer would take several days to burn out, during which the strange fragrance would linger, and the strange scenes would not cease.

Xiaotuan looked on with curiosity. Suddenly, among the several feet tall strange incense, a half-burned three-inch common incense was very conspicuous.

The truth was... the golden rain bath had extinguished Li Xian's common incense. The other strange incenses were made of special materials and were not easily extinguished once lit.

Xiaotuan knew that Wen Caishang was trying to find someone. Seeing this unusual thing, she shouted, "Madam, look here."

Wen Caishang was practicing the Silkworm Clothes and Jade Flaw Skill internally. Hearing the commotion, she lifted the curtain and looked intently. Seeing the three-inch common incense was so abrupt, she was slightly stunned, then her face broke into a smile, her eyes curved, and her interest was greatly piqued. She already knew who had done it. It turned out Li Xian had already been here. She was both annoyed and delighted, and cursed:

"Good little bastard... he really dared to come!"

Xiaotuan asked, "Madam, is it really him?"

Wen Caishang said, "This thief is of lowly status but proud, his style of action is often unconventional and unexpected, daring to the extreme yet meticulous. If it weren't for him, who would specifically insert a common incense stick here."

"This shows... he hid very well, entered the temple fair, and I didn't detect him. But it also shows that he doesn't know my true identity."

Xiaotuan asked, "Then what should we do?"

Wen Caishang bit her red lips, her eyes shining. She thought of past events: the combined dance of the Yin-Yang Sword Art, surviving danger at Tiger Cry Ridge, indulging freely along the river... These feelings were unforgettable, and every time she recalled them, she felt infinite joy. Sometimes angry, sometimes happy.

Then she thought again: "You received my favor, and I even helped you build the foundation of your martial path. Now your abilities are growing, and you can slip away from under my nose without a trace. Good, good... you're using that alertness of yours against me!"

"How can I, Wen Caishang, allow you to treat me like this? Even if you are to my liking, don't blame me for being ruthless!"

She said coldly, "I am in the light, he is in the dark. Let's see if he is as cunning as a fox, or if I am more scheming."

Suddenly feeling extremely annoyed and irritable, she waved her palm through the air.

The common incense shattered into thirty-seven pieces. Wen Caishang snorted coldly and said in a cold voice, "Return to the residence."

Xiaotuan and Duan Ni both felt their hair stand on end. They had thought that since Madam Wen had gone to such great lengths to find her lover, and had found a clue, she should be tender and joyful.

But at this moment, her tone was full of cold fury, chilling to the bone. It was absolutely not what one would expect when searching for a lover. Her hatred and anger were not fake.

Thinking again of this person's unpredictable temper, her difficult-to-fathom thoughts. If she got angry, she would take lives and sever limbs with extreme ruthlessness. Now that she was so angry, if she really got what she wanted, that person's end would be hard to imagine.

Xiaotuan secretly thought: "It's over, it's over... Madam is no kind person. Being skinned and having her tendons pulled out is probably unavoidable."

(P.S.: Happy National Day. Nearly eight thousand words. At the beginning of the month, I'm asking for monthly tickets.)
