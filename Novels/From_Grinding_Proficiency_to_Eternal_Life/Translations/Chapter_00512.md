# Chapter 512: Buddha and Demon

His right hand slowly rose, five fingers long and slender, knuckles distinct, the movement as gentle as brushing away a wisp of dust.

Yet with his motion, the space within the Zhenyuan Monastery courtyard instantly solidified.

The air grew as thick as mercury, and the immense pressure forced Wuneng and Wujing, who had just been trying to stand, back down onto the ground, making even breathing a struggle.

Sanzang felt his spiritual power instantly and completely sealed within his body, as if he were a mortal trapped in a mire, utterly unable to move. He even tried to use his body to enlighten, but before the True Lord of Universal Salvation, it was like a gentle breeze blowing against a mountain.

He was only at the Arhat level, and facing a True Lord of Bodhisattva attainment, he was clearly out of his depth.

The raised hand of the True Lord of Universal Salvation now appeared to everyone as if it had transformed into a sky-covering, earth-shrouding divine palm.

Ignoring distance, ignoring spatial barriers, carrying an awe-inspiring, irresistible, and unfathomable majestic power, it descended upon the four masters and disciples.

Especially upon Wukong, it pressed down from above.

The lines on the palm were clearly visible, each one seeming like the condensation of heavenly and earthly laws.

This single grasp aimed to crush and flatten them like insects!

At the moment he perceived the sky-covering giant palm descending through Wukong's perspective, Xu Yunfan, who was billions of miles away, was struck with terror, a chill instantly crawling up his spine.

He saw that with merely a raised hand and a grasp from the True Lord of Universal Salvation, the entire space of the Zhenyuan Monastery courtyard seemed to be completely frozen.

The Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiendish Qi that had been surging violently within his body just moments ago were now as stagnant as lead and mercury.

Wuneng and Wujing lay瘫软 on the ground, unable to move.

Even Sanzang's spiritual power was tightly sealed, as if he were a mortal.

That seemingly casually raised palm, in Xu Yunfan's spiritual perception, had long since transformed into an invisible canopy covering the entire universe. The lines and crevices of the palm were like star rivers crisscrossing, flowing with the stern light of laws.

"The might of a True Lord... the true peak power of the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm!"

Xu Yunfan was inwardly shaken beyond measure.

He finally experienced firsthand the terror of the beings at the very top of this world.

Although Dao Lords exist, their forms are elusive and hard to find, mostly hiding in heavens beyond the heavens or walking with incarnations.

Only "True Lords" who have proven the Great Dao of the Golden Core are the truly invincible existences who, beneath the heavens and earth of this realm, genuinely command all directions and guard a region.

Their power can shatter all laws, their momentum can suppress heaven and earth, and with a single thought, all things are born and die by their will.

The seemingly effortless grasp of the True Lord of Universal Salvation actually condensed the supreme majesty of the Golden Core Dao Fruit, possessing a brilliant divine might. It was far beyond what these cultivators still struggling in the Foundation Establishment realm could imagine, and even less something Wukong's savage strength could contend with.

However, at this very moment, a gentle yet incredibly tough golden Buddha light, like a ribbon falling from beyond the heavens, suddenly interposed itself beneath the True Lord's giant palm.

"Immeasurable Life Buddha, True Lord, please calm your anger. Show mercy!"

The space rippled slightly, and a figure manifested from the golden Buddha light.

The newcomer was the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva of the Bodhisattva Pure Land. Her face was dignified and compassionate, her appearance solemn and majestic. She wore a simple white robe and held a jade vase in which a willow branch was verdant and dripping with dew.

A gentle yet vast Buddhist will power emanated from her, forming a faint halo that barely managed to halt the descent of the sky-covering giant palm.

But upon closer inspection, the ground beneath the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva's feet had silently sunk by half an inch.

"Calm my anger? Show mercy?"

The True Lord of Universal Salvation withdrew his hand, clasped his hands behind his back, and swept a cold gaze over the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva. He then glanced at the sunken ground at her feet, a mocking curve appearing at the corner of his mouth.

"Wonderful Truth, you've arrived quickly. However, your disciple destroyed my foundational treasure tree and injured my garden-guarding Taoist boy. For you to speak of calming anger seems a bit too light, doesn't it?"

The Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva pressed her palms together and bowed slightly, her posture extremely deferential, her voice still calm.

"I understand what the True Lord has said.

This matter is indeed the fault of my undisciplined disciple, Wukong. His heart demon arose suddenly, he could not subdue his mind-monkey, and he committed a lawless evil deed.

As his master, I failed in my discipline and cannot shirk my responsibility. I offer my apologies to the True Lord here."

She paused, seemingly choosing her words. "This monkey is a born stone monkey, nurtured by a先天 Dao embryo. Though he has taken refuge with my Buddha, his demonic nature is not yet extinguished. This time, he was stirred by the evil qi of your treasure tree and further provoked by the boy's words. In a moment of demonic obstruction, he committed a great wrong... but considering his role as a guardian on the eastward journey and the heavy responsibility he bears, I wonder if the True Lord..."

As she spoke, Wonderful Truth's peripheral vision glanced at Wukong and the others below, who looked as if they had survived a calamity, and she couldn't help but curse inwardly.

If this matter is not handled well today, it might very well ignite a great war between the Bodhisattva Pure Land and the Primordial Origin Sect.

"Oh? Demonic nature not yet extinguished? Provoked by words?"

The True Lord of Universal Salvation directly interrupted the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva's words, his voice suddenly rising, carrying an undisguised mockery, his gaze like a sharp sword piercing towards Wukong.

"Wonderful Truth, don't you find it laughable to say such evasive words yourself? It is clearly your Bodhisattva Pure Land that纵容ed a demon to commit violence, relying on strength to bully the weak.

Within my Zhenyuan Monastery, stealing first, destroying the treasure second, and beating the Taoist boy! Such actions are no different from those demons and devils that plague the Eastern Wasteland! How dare this beast speak of universal salvation? What a huge joke!"

Each of his questions was like a giant hammer blow, causing the Buddha light around the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva to tremble slightly.

But the tone in his voice was something everyone could detect—an indescribable joy.

By intervening like this, the Primordial Origin Sect finally had an excuse to get involved. Even if the World Honored One Tathagata descended personally, he would have nothing to say.

If he really wanted to act unreasonably, the Dao Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect would certainly teach this newcomer a lesson.

"As for the guardian on the eastward journey?"

The True Lord of Universal Salvation snorted coldly, the cold light in his eyes becoming even more chilling.

"Isn't that even more deserving of death! To bring such a fierce and stubborn demon monkey into the Eastern Wasteland and still dare to falsely claim the establishment of a Buddhist kingdom.

I say it is simply letting a demon run rampant, leaving endless poison behind. If we do not execute him on the spot today and extract his soul to refine his spirit, how can the face of my Primordial Origin Sect be preserved? How should the fellow cultivators of the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm view this matter!"

The True Lord of Universal Salvation spoke with righteous indignation, his aura vast and mighty, like a brilliant divine might.

What made Wonderful Truth even more unable to maintain her composure was that he, the True Lord of Universal Salvation, was the one from the Demonic Path, yet he acted as if he were a good person. It was truly despicable.

He made their Bodhisattva Pure Land seem like a heretical sect.

The Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva, stimulated by this aggressive questioning and the blatant threat of "extracting the soul and refining the spirit," furrowed her brows tightly. The compassion in her heart could not suppress a flicker of anger. Her voice remained calm, but it carried a hint of solemnity.

"True Lord, I do not wish to shirk responsibility. My undisciplined disciple committed a great wrong, I admit it! My Bodhisattva Pure Land admits it. We are willing to do everything we can to compensate the True Lord for his losses, to show our sincere apology. We are willing to..."

"Compensate?"

The True Lord of Universal Salvation suddenly laughed, his smile carrying an extremely dangerous playfulness. He looked the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva up and down, his gaze lingering for a moment on the jade vase and willow branch in her hand, the mockery at the corner of his mouth almost becoming tangible.

"Very well, since the Wonderful Truth Bodhisattva is so sincere, then this True Lord must ask..."

His voice suddenly sank, his pace slowed, but each word was like an ice bead falling on a jade plate, clearly echoing in the ears of every person whose spirit was trembling.
