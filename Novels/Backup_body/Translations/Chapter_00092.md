# Chapter 92: The Chosen Daoist Heir and the Descent of the Southern Divine Mother  

**Lin Yuan Wan Clan, Rear Courtyard**  

A massive iron cage stood in the center of the courtyard, covered in intricate runes and formations. Inside, a magnificent bird with emerald horns and golden feathers lay sprawled out, three jars of wine placed beside it. Dozens of female spirit birds surrounded it, doting on the creature with great care.  

"Lord Bird, the clan leader has ordered your release. Please come to the front hall for tea, and you may leave shortly after," a middle-aged man hurried over, smiling respectfully.  

"I'm not leaving!" The bird rolled its eyes and lazily opened its beak as one of the female birds placed a worm into its mouth.  

"Lord Bird, you are a divine creature. Mingling with these common birds is beneath your dignity," the man said with a pained expression.  

"What nonsense! You couldn't catch me, so you lured me here with these females. Now you dare say such things?" The bird—Hanging Wall Bird—sneered. "You brought me here, but did you ever think about how you'd take me back? I'm staying! I’ll be the sacrificial offering!"  

The man grew even more distressed. "If you wait any longer, when the Divine Mother descends, even if you want to leave, it’ll be too late."  

"The Southern Divine Mother? She dares eat me?" Hanging Wall Bird scoffed. "I told you before—I hail from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect! My grandfather is a true divine avian, an immortal! Even the Southern Divine Mother wouldn’t dare offend him! You didn’t believe me, so I’ll wait and see if she dares lay a claw on me!"  

The man hesitated, then said, "But your grandfather doesn’t look like an immortal avian. He at least has a human form..."  

Hanging Wall Bird stiffened as if struck by lightning. "What?"  

The man replied, "There’s a man outside named Li Zhengjing. He claims to be your master."  

"What? Master is here?" Hanging Wall Bird immediately shooed away the female birds, frantically preening its feathers. "Why didn’t you say so earlier? If he sees me like this, he’ll think I’ve lost all dignity! I’m a refined divine avian, a scholar of great learning—I must maintain my cultured demeanor. Quick, bring me a book!"

**Wan Clan Ancestral Hall**  

Li Zhengjing sat in the guest seat as the Wan Clan leader respectfully served tea and pastries. He handed a pastry to the little dragon girl beside him.  

She had a scarf wrapped around her head, and her tail was hidden under her skirt, making her look like an exquisitely carved human child. She blinked at the pastry but didn’t move.  

"It’s sweet. You’ll like it," Li Zhengjing said warmly. "Do you have this in your homeland? What are your hometown specialties? Whenever I think of my hometown’s delicacies, I get emotional—sometimes even tear up..."  

The little dragon girl’s eyes filled with sympathy. She reached out with her tiny hand and patted his head, her delicate face full of pity.  

"Why do you look at me like I’m an idiot?" Li Zhengjing scowled and set the pastry down.  

The little girl glanced at him, then quietly picked up the pastry and took a small bite. Her eyes suddenly brightened, and she smiled like a crescent moon.  

Silence filled the hall.  

Li Zhengjing and the little girl chatted as if no one else was present, completely ignoring the Wan Clan leader and three Qi Condensation elders. The four exchanged glances, their expressions darkening.  

But Li Zhengjing didn’t care. Since polite negotiations had failed and only drawn swords, he saw no reason to show them respect.  

"Master!"  

A voice called out. Li Zhengjing looked up to see a middle-aged man carrying a tray. On it sat Hanging Wall Bird, engrossed in a book.  

"Master, the Wan Clan has an extensive library. They invited me to read, and you know how much I love books—I couldn’t refuse. I’ve been so absorbed I forgot to eat or sleep."  

"Drink some tea," Li Zhengjing said dryly, tossing a cup over. "Sober up."  

Hanging Wall Bird stiffened, then awkwardly took a sip.  

Li Zhengjing stood, summoning the bird with a flick of his Qi, placing it on his shoulder. He turned to the little dragon girl. "Let’s go."  

The girl glanced at Hanging Wall Bird’s green horns, then smirked disdainfully.  

"What’s with this brat’s attitude?" Hanging Wall Bird bristled.  

"She’s part of our family now," Li Zhengjing said flatly.  

"Ah! Master’s kidnapped another little girl?" Hanging Wall Bird’s anger vanished as it grinned. "I’m Bai Guabi, Master’s right-hand man and the second-most learned in our crew. Call me Brother Guabi—"  

"Shut up."  

Li Zhengjing smacked it aside, then took the little girl’s hand and strode out, ignoring the Wan Clan members.  

But then a voice called out:  

"You can’t leave!"  

Li Zhengjing turned slowly, eyeing the young man who had appeared.  

This man was at the peak of Qi Condensation, his aura nearly as strong as Lu Huaiyuan’s.  

His cultivation was unmistakably from an orthodox immortal sect.  

"The Wan Clan couldn’t produce someone like this," Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice whispered in his ear. "His demeanor, foundation, and techniques all point to him being a top-tier true disciple of the Luofu Immortal Sect—likely a candidate for Daoist Heir. My earlier guess was right: the Wan Clan does have someone from Luofu."  

"You’re the Wan Clan’s true disciple in Luofu Immortal Sect?" Li Zhengjing asked calmly, gripping his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber. "Why can’t we leave?"  

The young man replied coldly, "The sacrificial list has been submitted. If the Southern Divine Mother arrives and finds the offering missing, her wrath will annihilate the Wan Clan."  

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless. "And?"  

"Either leave the bird, or all of you stay."  

"And if I refuse?"  

Li Zhengjing’s voice was icy. "If the Divine Mother’s anger is too much for the Wan Clan, do you think they can handle mine?" He raised his saber. "I fought my way out of the Feather Transformation Sect’s spirit mine. Do you think I can’t cut through a mere Wan Clan, a branch of Luofu?"  

"Your reputation has spread far in recent days, Li Zhengjing," the young man said coldly. "You’re already a traitor to the Feather Transformation Sect. Do you really want to provoke a human immortal of Luofu?"  

"So the Wan Clan can only rely on Luofu’s name to throw its weight around?" Li Zhengjing laughed. "But even Luofu is on shaky ground now, isn’t it?"  

The young man’s expression darkened.  

The Wan Clan leader and elders exchanged shocked glances.  

"Logically, such secrets should only be known to high-ranking figures for now. The Wan Clan’s status remains intact, but the truth won’t stay hidden forever. Once it spreads, the Wan Clan won’t last."  

Li Zhengjing smirked. "From what I’ve heard, the Luofu Sect suffered a great upheaval. The sect leader perished, and over half their human immortals died in battle. The Wan Clan’s ancestor, the Sixth Peak’s guardian elder, also fell, didn’t he? You’re threatening me with a dead immortal?"  

The atmosphere turned frigid.  

The Wan Clan leader roared, "Our ancestor is a transcendent human immortal with a lifespan of a thousand years! How dare you slander him?"  

Li Zhengjing ignored him, focusing on the young man.  

After a long silence, the man sighed.  

"The sect’s upper echelons have suffered heavy losses. Internal strife is rampant."  

"External forces eye Luofu’s millennia of accumulated resources and influence, eager to carve up our territory."  

"Among them, sects like the Profound Origin Sword Sect—with their recent surge of human immortals—seek to replace Luofu entirely."  

"Even the Great Zhou Dynasty is preparing to seize parts of our domain."  

He sighed again. "The Wan Clan has relied on Luofu’s name and their ancestor’s prestige to dominate this region for over two centuries. But their descendants grew arrogant, offending many and monopolizing resources. If the ancestor’s death and Luofu’s decline become public, the consequences will be dire."  

Li Zhengjing nodded. "So that’s why the Southern Divine Mother is coming?"  

"The Wan Clan has no choice but to seek her protection," the young man admitted. "For example, the Violet Origin Dao Sect three hundred miles away has tolerated the Wan Clan out of fear for our ancestor. But once the truth is out, they’ll seize the chance to attack, annexing the Wan Clan to expand their influence."  

"I see. The Wan Clan’s situation is tough."  

Li Zhengjing smiled. "But what does that have to do with me?"  

He looked at the young man and the Wan Clan elders. "You took my bird as a sacrifice. I didn’t cause trouble—that’s already generous. Now you want to stop me? Then the Violet Origin Dao Sect won’t even get the chance to act!"  

With that, he stepped forward, his Qi erupting. The ground cracked beneath him as his saber pointed at the young man.  

But then, the golden page in his mind flickered, absorbing his Qi and displaying new text:  

**Name:** Gu Changzhou  
**Age:** 37  
**Cultivation:** Peak Qi Condensation, Great Perfection of the Heavenly Cycle  
**Status:** Third True Disciple of Luofu Immortal Sect, candidate for Daoist Heir  
**Fate:** …Insufficient spiritual energy!  

Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow.  

This man wasn’t from the Wan Clan?  

A Daoist Heir candidate?  

This Gu Changzhou, hiding in the Wan Clan, was a dragon lurking in a pond?  

But even so, Li Zhengjing could easily defeat him. Why did the golden page still show "insufficient spiritual energy"?  

Was there some great secret about him that Li Zhengjing’s current Qi couldn’t reveal?  

"The bird is on the sacrificial list. It stays!"  

Gu Changzhou’s expression hardened. He held something behind his back, his aura surging.  

His eyes were cold—he was confident, unafraid of the man who had once defeated Lu Huaiyuan.  

The little dragon girl blinked, curiously eyeing the object behind his back.  

Just as tensions peaked, a Buddhist chant broke the silence.  

"Amitabha! Both of you, hold!"  

Golden light shimmered as a young monk entered the hall, smiling at Li Zhengjing. "Brother Zhengjing, it’s only been a month, yet your fame has spread across the land. Your strength now surpasses even mine."  

"Vajra Buddha Child, long time no see."  

Li Zhengjing smiled.  

A month ago, during the hunt for the Venomous King Xin Xuan, Li Zhengjing had been at the Internal Qi stage while the monk was already at the peak of Qi Condensation.  

Now, Li Zhengjing stood as his equal.  

"Brother Gu, lower your aura."  

The Vajra Buddha Child turned to Gu Changzhou. "I owe both of you favors. Grant me this face—sit down and talk peacefully."  

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "We talked. He insists on sacrificing my bird. If he won’t budge, I’ll just sacrifice him and the Wan Clan to the heavens instead."  

Gu Changzhou said coldly, "The Wan Clan is full of mortals who don’t understand the stakes. The Southern Divine Mother’s true form is the Heavenly Lord Tianjun—a wrathful deity. If the offering is lacking, she’ll unleash divine punishment. With the Wan ancestor gone, she won’t hold back."  

He added grimly, "The Wan ancestor taught me. I won’t let the clan fall to the Divine Mother. The bird stays."  

The Vajra Buddha Child clasped his hands. "If the offering is insufficient, I’ll bear the Divine Mother’s wrath."  

"Little monk, you can’t bear it!"  

An old woman’s voice suddenly echoed.  

The clouds above darkened as divine light descended.  

The Southern Divine Mother had arrived!
