## Chapter 5: An Indwelling Malignancy

This speed was too slow. After all, Chen Fei's current age was already considerable, and the older he got, the harder it would be for his cultivation to advance. More importantly, after Chen Fei killed Qi Chun, the black line on his wrist had become noticeably thicker.

[Status: Indwelling Malignancy]

The status panel had displayed this new change a day ago, and the most intuitive effect on Chen Fei was a noticeable acceleration in the depletion of his stamina.
After breaking through to the Skin Refining realm, Chen Fei's physical strength and senses had greatly improved compared to before. However, with this 'Indwelling Malignancy', Chen Fei found his stamina to be comparable to, or even worse than, that of an ordinary person.
In this situation, Chen Fei dared not be careless. He immediately began subtly questioning some physicians at the medical hall and eventually got an answer.
This was a mark left by a grotesque entity. Either the grotesque entity was destroyed, and the mark would naturally dissipate, or one's own cultivation had to be strong enough to directly grind away the mark.
If neither of those worked, one could also take elixirs that strengthened qi and blood to resist this yin-aligned power.
Chen Fei naturally didn't dare to seek out the grotesque entity now, and he couldn't afford elixirs. All that remained was to improve his cultivation. Furthermore, Chen Fei didn't dare let the medical hall know he had been marked; who knew if they would find it troublesome and simply abandon him.
“It’s time to find Pu Liao.”
That evening, Chen Fei arrived at Pu Liao's door and knocked gently.
“Who is it?” Pu Liao’s hoarse voice came from within.

The door opened a crack, revealing Pu Liao's indifferent face. Chen Fei, seemingly ignoring Pu Liao's expression, spoke calmly.
Chen Fei had understood today that Pu Liao simply wanted money. But Chen Fei had only been a guard for three days; where would he get any money? Even a guard's monthly salary was only five taels of silver. How could Pu Liao care for five taels of silver? Since that was the case, Chen Fei might as well state things clearly.
“You want to practice on your own? Hahaha!” Pu Liao burst into loud laughter, his eyes full of mockery. Breaking through to the Skin Refining realm in over four months—this talent was almost bottom-tier among martial artists. And yet he still dared to dream of relying on his own talent to cultivate higher-level martial arts? It was simply a fool's errand, utterly ignorant of his own limitations.
“Fine, I have some cultivation manuals here. Return them to me by noon tomorrow. If you can't learn anything by then, don't say I, Pu Liao, bullied you!”
Pu Liao went back into the room, retrieved two secret manuals, and threw them into Chen Fei's hands. He sneered and slammed the door shut.
Some onlookers in the distance watched Chen Fei's retreating back and shook their heads slightly. A newly arrived guard, daring to clash with an old guard like Pu Liao.

Back in his room, Chen Fei didn't waste any time. He took out the manuals Pu Liao had given him. One of them was the Whirlwind Breathing Technique. He had already achieved Grand Perfection in his own foundational breathing method. Following a hunch, Chen Fei concentrated, and to his surprise, his panel showed:

[Whirlwind Breathing Technique (Proficient 107/1000)]

“It really works!” Chen Fei's eyes lit up with joy. He had just followed a feeling, and unexpectedly, a skill that had reached Grand Perfection could indeed merge with other skills.
Thinking about it, it made sense. After all, Grand Perfection in a skill meant you had thoroughly mastered everything about it, knowing it inside and out. It was natural then to be able to integrate it into other skills. This meant that even if Chen Fei's cultivation improved in the future, some skills that couldn't keep up wouldn't be wasted. They could be combined with new techniques to form more powerful skills.
Mountain Extremity Fist was also merged with Clear Wind Sword. During this fusion, Chen Fei intentionally preserved more of the essence of Clear Wind Sword, only integrating some of the force application methods from Mountain Extremity Fist.
