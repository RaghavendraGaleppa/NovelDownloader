# Chapter 176: Sudden Changes in the Wind and Rain

Within the middle layer of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.

On a massive viewing platform.

As time passed.

The murmurs of discussion that had begun as scattered whispers gradually swelled into a roaring clamor.

Three full days had elapsed.

Yet not a single person had managed to ascend to the Island of Heroes and pass the second trial.

This bizarre situation.

Had surpassed the imagination of the many cultivators on the viewing platform.

"Where are the Ten Elite Talents of Foundation Establishment? Why hasn't a single one of them attempted it? As the ten most recognized supreme geniuses of our human race in the Foundation Establishment realm, they should charge forward fearlessly like the Golden-Winged Roc did at the beginning!"

"By charging forward fearlessly, do you mean darting around randomly within the thousand-zhang space beneath the Island of Heroes?"

Someone mocked with a sneer.

At this moment.

Among the crowd.

A man and woman sat side by side, their gazes fixed on the same location.

Yet their expressions were completely different.

The man stared intently at Qu Junhou.

His eyes brimmed with admiration and anticipation.

While the woman's dark, lively eyes reflected the figure of Zhang Jing beside him, an unconscious trace of unease flickering in her gaze.

......

Elsewhere in the secret realm.

Within a vast and boundless space, over ten thousand people sat sparsely scattered.

Not a single person spoke.

The atmosphere was eerily silent.

Though their auras varied, without exception, every one of them exuded fluctuations of the Taiyi Infinite Dao Sect's inherited techniques.

In an inconspicuous corner.

You Yuanming stared blankly at the terrifying scene displayed before him.

As if struck by a thought.

He stiffly turned his head to glance at his senior brother.

A tempest of shock surged in his heart.

You Yuanming remembered.

Before coming here, his senior brother had mentioned participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm a hundred years later, aiming to secure a spot within the top ten thousand.

But now...

His gaze involuntarily swept across the secret realm again.

Whether it was the black gale winds, the yin flames, the crimson thunder, or the yellow sand—for his current self, any of these meant certain death upon contact.

Not to mention the uppermost layer.

There was an even more sinister and mysterious area.

Even that terrifying Golden-Winged Roc from the Myriad Races of the Heavens faction had become trapped within it.

And this... was the trial one had to face and overcome to secure a spot within the top ten thousand!

"Can my strength truly reach such heights in a hundred years?"

You Yuanming felt somewhat uncertain.

At this thought.

His gaze shifted to Zhang Jing, who sat quietly in a corner of the secret realm.

A flash of awe and envy instantly flickered in his eyes.

The goal that seemed insurmountable to him probably didn't even qualify as a challenge in Zhang Jing's eyes.

After all, the golden-robed figure beside Zhang Jing.

Was someone he recognized well.

Qu Junhou, one of the Ten Elite Talents of Human Foundation Establishment, renowned for his overwhelming victory over the Golden-Winged Roc on the Immortal Dueling Platform.

His strength was terrifyingly formidable.

Yet this former junior brother of his, Zhang Jing, seemed to be on friendly terms with him.

As a former prodigy from the lower realm, You Yuanming understood all too well what this implied.

It meant their strengths were on the same level.

Even if there was a gap, it couldn't be significant.

"The level of the Ten Elite Talents of Human Foundation Establishment! That guy Zhang Jing's talent... is monstrous even among the countless geniuses and freaks of the upper realm."

He couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

Beside him.

His senior brother seemed to notice You Yuanming's emotional shift.

After a moment of thought.

He heard his senior brother comfort him with a smile:

"Junior Brother You, don't worry. This time, it's likely the fault of the secret realm's spirit. It set the difficulty of the second trial too high."

"The third trial might not even gather ten thousand—"

Yet before he could finish.

His voice abruptly cut off.

You Yuanming turned to his senior brother in confusion.

Only to find the latter's gaze suddenly vacant, his face filled with shock.

What was this?

He instinctively followed his senior brother's line of sight.

And was immediately stunned.

A streak of cold moonlight was rising from the ground at incredible speed, effortlessly piercing through the layers of black gale winds, flaming thunder, yellow sand, and other obstacles as if they were nothing.

Then.

The moonlight transformed into a woman, who casually grabbed the Golden-Winged Roc and effortlessly ascended to the Island of Heroes, which no one had yet set foot on.

The entire process was smooth and effortless.

Taking no more than twenty breaths.

The sheer terror of the strength displayed was utterly mind-boggling!

The Golden-Winged Roc, which had previously seemed overwhelmingly powerful, appeared like a firefly next to the moon in comparison—utterly incomparable.

Behind them.

A series of gasps shattered the silence.

"Who is that woman?"

"She's never shown her strength before, yet her first move is earth-shattering. Saving the Golden-Winged Roc... she's almost certainly a being from the Myriad Races of the Heavens faction."

"We're doomed!"

"Before, creatures like the Golden-Winged Roc, the Water-Avoiding Deer, and the Mountain-Carrying Demon Ram were terrifying, but our human race had the Ten Elite Talents to match them."

"But this mysterious woman..."

"Alas~"

The crowd wore expressions of gloom.

It seemed that in their eyes.

The moment the mysterious woman revealed her strength.

The outcome of who would claim the top spot in the Foundation Establishment realm of this Proud Cloud Secret Realm had already been decided.

......

Meanwhile.

Inside the secret realm.

Chaos erupted.

The countless cultivators on the ground stared dumbfounded at the spot where the woman and the Golden-Winged Roc had vanished onto the Island of Heroes, their faces filled with disbelief.

Was that woman really still in the Foundation Establishment realm?

Not only had she effortlessly traversed the layers of obstacles below, but she hadn't been affected in the slightest by the thousand-zhang sinister zone beneath the Island of Heroes.

And on top of that.

She had casually hauled the Golden-Winged Roc up to the Island of Heroes!

How was this possible?!

Time passed slowly.

Thousands of complex gazes remained fixed on the spot where the woman and the Golden-Winged Roc had disappeared, unwilling to look away.

On the ground.

Qu Junhou gradually regained his senses.

A trace of shock flashed in his eyes.

"When did such a being appear in the Myriad Races of the Heavens faction?" he murmured in a daze.

Though it had only been a fleeting glimpse.

For some reason.

The moment he saw the mysterious woman, Qu Junhou had inexplicably felt that he might not be her match.

The next instant.

As if suddenly realizing something.

He hurriedly turned to look at Zhang Jing beside him.

"Brother Zhang, you said earlier that you're certain now. Could it be—"

Meeting his expectant gaze.

Zhang Jing nodded affirmatively.

Upon receiving this confirmation.

Qu Junhou subconsciously glanced again at where the woman had disappeared, a flicker of joy flashing in his eyes.

"Though I don't know how Brother Zhang made his judgment, I trust he must be right. At the very least... following that woman's path can't be wrong."

He thought to himself.

Just then.

Thousands of figures exuding powerful auras quietly rose from their spots, transforming into streaks of light that shot toward the sky.

Clearly.

These people shared the same idea as Qu Junhou.

Meanwhile.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept over the streaks of light racing upward.

Then he shook his head.

He knew exactly what they were thinking.

But...

The thousand-zhang zone beneath the Island of Heroes tested one's mental fortitude. Following someone else's path was utterly meaningless.

At this thought.

The figure of the unfamiliar woman reappeared in Zhang Jing's mind.

He couldn't help but fall into deep contemplation.

Which race of the Myriad Races of the Heavens faction did she belong to, for her strength to surpass beings like the Golden-Winged Roc by such a margin?

Could she be of royal blood?!

His eyes gleamed faintly.

At first glance.

Zhang Jing had sensed.

That without resorting to his imitation Primordial Immortal Light of the Primal Beginning and relying solely on his fused Dao Intentions, it would be difficult to defeat her.

"The Myriad Races of the Heavens truly hide dragons and crouching tigers. But... the stronger, the better!"

A hint of anticipation unconsciously flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

The Proud Cloud Secret Realm was a grand stage.

The stronger his opponents were.

The more they would highlight the terrifying might of his imitation Primordial Immortal Light of the Primal Beginning!

Only then would this inheritance sell well within the Dao Sect in the future.

......

"Brother Zhang, shall we go up now?"

Qu Junhou's voice suddenly sounded by his ear.

Hearing this.

Zhang Jing stood up directly and said with a smile:

"Naturally! There's no point in delaying further."

As soon as the words left his mouth.

Two streaks of light shot into the sky.

......

In another corner of the crowd.

Ji Jiulin, one of the 'Ten Elite Talents of Human Foundation Establishment,' stood quietly behind a man clad in a dark golden robe embroidered with nine dragons.

Before long.

The man withdrew his gaze from the Island of Heroes, a bright gleam suddenly bursting forth in his eyes.

His blazing fighting spirit grew even more intense.

"The Jade Moon Rabbit Clan is indeed extraordinary!"

Then.

He turned to look at Ji Jiulin behind him, his eyes flashing as he teased:

"Imperial Brother, how does the title of one of the Ten Elite Talents of Human Foundation Establishment suit you? Are you comfortable with it?"

Hearing this.

Ji Jiulin's face flushed with embarrassment as he awkwardly laughed:

"It's just nonsense spread by ignorant cultivators. Your Highness, please don't mock me further. How could this humble brother possibly deserve such a title?"

In truth.

Ji Jiulin utterly despised the so-called title of one of the Ten Elite Talents of Human Foundation Establishment, even feeling ashamed to acknowledge it.

For one thing.

Just the man before him.

His strength far surpassed anything Ji Jiulin could hope to match.

Yet the other disdained to reveal it.

And as for others of similar caliber.

Ji Jiulin knew without thinking that there had to be more within the Proud Cloud Secret Realm!

Take for example—

The figure of that young man who had effortlessly suppressed the Ancestral Demon Sect's Wang Wunian flashed through his mind.

Despite his overwhelming strength.

The young man was virtually unknown.

Whereas Wang Wunian, whom he had easily crushed, had somehow been labeled as one of the 'Ten Elite Talents of Human Foundation Establishment,' just like himself.

Wasn't that laughable?

As he pondered.

"Imperial Brother, it's about time. We should ascend to the island."

A calm voice reached Ji Jiulin's ears.

"As you command, Your Highness!"

He replied respectfully.

......

Similar conversations unfolded simultaneously in various corners of the crowd.

Thousands of streaks of light instantly filled the sky.

Boom—

Gale winds, yin flames, crimson thunder, yellow sand!

All manner of strange phenomena abruptly manifested.

For a time.

The sky became more bustling than ever before.

And all of this.

Was undoubtedly due to that mysterious woman who had acted first.

Witnessing this scene.

Most of those still on the ground wore expressions of bewilderment.

As if they hadn't fully processed what was happening.
