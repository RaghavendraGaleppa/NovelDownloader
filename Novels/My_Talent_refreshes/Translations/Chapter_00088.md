# Chapter 88: Ling Xiaobai

The small white demonic beast had its head slightly tilted, displaying a look of human-like bewilderment. Chu Ning recalled the voice that had just appeared in his mind, which sounded somewhat like a message conveyed by Sound Transmission Art. Immediately, his heart stirred, and he used Sound Transmission Art to ask the white demonic beast, "Can you understand me?"
Unfortunately, the white little beast showed no reaction. Chu Ning was utterly baffled, thinking the earlier voice must have been an illusion.
The white little beast kept frantically waving its hooves, looking very anxious. Chu Ning replayed the voice in his mind, blinked, and spoke to the white little beast again. This time, however, he didn't use the Sound Transmission Art, but rather Divine Sense Transmission.
"Can you understand me?"
This time, the white little beast finally stopped its other movements and let out a soft "Ying!"
Chu Ning was greatly astonished. He used Divine Sense Transmission again, asking, "You want me to release you?"
As soon as he spoke, the white little beast continuously nodded, emitting "ying ying" sounds from its mouth. Then, as if it had suddenly remembered something, it looked at Chu Ning.
"Release me!"
The next moment, this voice rang in Chu Ning's ears once more.
Chu Ning was now certain that this white little beast truly could communicate through Divine Sense. This left him incredibly surprised. Even with his limited understanding of spiritual beasts and demonic beasts, he could tell this white little beast was no ordinary creature. After all, from Chu Ning's Divine Sense perception, this white little beast was merely a first-tier intermediate demonic beast. Under normal circumstances, a demonic beast of this level would absolutely not possess such high intelligence.
Chu Ning now felt it would be a shame to directly kill such a spiritual little beast. But this little beast was incredibly fast and seemed to possess some sort of innate ability. Even a single Beast-Trapping Talisman couldn't hold it, and he had no idea how it managed to bypass the protective restriction and appear in his spiritual field. If he released it directly, it would probably just run away.
Chu Ning used his Divine Sense to communicate with the white little beast again. "You want me to release you, but what if you escape?"
The white little beast shook its head repeatedly, continuing to wave its hooves, looking very anxious.
"Release me!"
At the same time, Chu Ning heard that voice again. Chu Ning finally realized that while this white little beast could communicate through Divine Sense, it seemed to have just learned, only able to understand his words but not capable of forming more complex vocalizations.

After a moment's thought, Chu Ning could only communicate with the white little beast through Divine Sense: "I can release you, but you mustn't run around. Otherwise, I'll trap you again, and..." As he spoke, several more Beast-Trapping Talismans and Geng Metal Sword Talismans appeared in Chu Ning's hand.
The white little beast saw the talismans in Chu Ning's hand, and a hint of fear flickered in its eyes. Immediately after, as if it had thought of something, it closed its eyes. Chu Ning then saw a faint white halo appear on the white little beast's forehead. At the same time, the white little beast's weak voice resonated in his ear. "Blood!"
Chu Ning paused slightly, now understanding the white little beast's intention. It wanted him to drip blood into that white halo. As a transmigrator, Chu Ning roughly understood the creature's purpose in asking him to do this: it was likely similar to establishing a contract. However, Chu Ning still hesitated. He didn't know much about spiritual beasts and demonic beasts, and he wasn't sure if signing such a contract would have any adverse effects on himself. After all, he knew that signing contracts with some high-level spiritual or demonic beasts required certain conditions, and if the spiritual beast died after a cultivator formed a contract with it, the cultivator would also suffer some harm. And this little beast was clearly not an ordinary creature.
After some consideration, Chu Ning shook his head, not daring to act rashly. But then, thinking of how intelligent this beast was, he immediately used his Divine Sense to communicate with it: "Forget it, no need to sign a contract. I trust you."
The white little beast opened its eyes, which now showed a human-like expression of pleasant surprise. The white halo on its forehead vanished.
"Ying!"
Immediately, the little beast let out a cheerful sound. Chu Ning smiled faintly upon hearing it.
Following the instructions for the Beast-Trapping Talisman, he formed an incantation, pointing his spiritual energy towards the white little beast. Instantly, the restraints that had confined the white little beast disappeared.
After some thought, Chu Ning took out a Spring Return Talisman. The white little beast's eyes flickered, appearing somewhat fearful. Chu Ning communicated with it through Divine Sense: "Don't be afraid, this is a spell to help you heal."
Upon hearing this, the white little beast raised its head, looked at Chu Ning, and then nodded, as if saying, "I trust you too." Chu Ning smiled again, activating the Spring Return Talisman. A healing spell landed on the white little beast. The wounds on its body disappeared, and it happily spun around in place.

"Ying!" It cheerfully chirped at Chu Ning again.
"This little beast is quite interesting," Chu Ning mused, feeling a surge of emotion. After entering the Qingxi Sect, Chu Ning had always been cautious and his nerves were taut. Now, after this exchange with the little beast, he felt vaguely lighter and more cheerful. However, upon seeing the pitted and uneven state of his spiritual field beside him, he couldn't help but glare at the little beast. "Look at the mess you've made, you've ruined my spiritual field."
Upon hearing this, the white little beast immediately flopped onto the ground, looking as if it admitted its mistake and was ready to accept punishment. Chu Ning shook his head, not saying anything more. Thankfully, these plants had only been recently sown, and a beast tide had erupted shortly after, so Chu Ning hadn't come to tend to them. Thus, these two types of spiritual plants hadn't grown very well these past few days. As long as he took the seeds, accelerated their growth, replanted them, and then applied the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art, the impact shouldn't be significant.
Thinking this, Chu Ning started from a corner of the spiritual field, first taking out Golden Essence Fruit seeds and beginning to accelerate their growth for replanting. Seeing Chu Ning cast his spells, the white little beast followed a few yards away. At this point, Chu Ning couldn't fully trust the little beast, so he kept his Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield gripped in his hand. His growth acceleration art was instant-cast anyway, so he didn't need to form complex hand seals. However, the white little beast showed no other unusual movements. After following for a while, it seemed to get bored and found a spot to lie down and sleep. Knowing it had been discovered by Chu Ning, the little beast didn't choose to burrow into the earth. Chu Ning saw the little beast's behavior and didn't bother it.
He replanted spiritual plants one patch at a time. After the Golden Essence Fruit seeds were successfully accelerated and planted, Chu Ning then took the Purple Crystal Bamboo rice and began to accelerate its growth for replanting. After all the empty spots were filled, Chu Ning didn't leave immediately. He casually took some food from his storage bag, ate it, then meditated for a while to restore his spiritual energy, and then began to cast the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art. During this process, Chu Ning paid attention to the white little beast several times. This little creature was sleeping soundly, making no movements. Chu Ning began to slowly relax at this point; at least for now, the little beast truly showed no other malicious intent.
By the time Chu Ning was nearing the end of casting the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art, the white little beast finally woke up. It followed to a spot several yards away from Chu Ning, wagging its tail. When it saw Chu Ning performing the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art, it actually let out a few "ying ying" chirps towards him. Although these sounds weren't a Divine Sense communication, Chu Ning could faintly sense the meaning of those two chirps.

Chu Ning turned his head, a wry smile on his face. "My spellcasting isn't bad, but I don't need a little guy like you to praise me."
He cast the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art a few more times, ensuring every spot was fully covered, before finally stopping and preparing to leave the spiritual field. However, looking at the white little beast now, Chu Ning found himself in a dilemma. He didn't know whether to take the little beast back to the market city or how else to handle it. Simply letting it go was certainly out of the question; after witnessing its extraordinary nature, how could Chu Ning allow such a treasure to just leave? Allowing the little beast to stay here didn't seem good either; who knew, perhaps the next day he'd return to find his spiritual field in the same state again. It seemed he would have to take it back to the market city, and if the opportunity arose, try to figure out exactly what kind of spiritual beast it was.
So, Chu Ning used Divine Sense to transmit to the little beast: "I'm heading back. You should come with me." Chu Ning had initially thought the little beast would resist, requiring some coercion or enticement. Who knew, upon hearing his words, the little beast actually nodded repeatedly, as if saying, "Alright, I'll follow you." Chu Ning was overjoyed to see it so compliant.
He led the white little beast out. As they exited the spiritual field's restriction, Chu Ning suddenly remembered something. He asked the white little beast curiously, "My spiritual field clearly has a protective restriction. How did you get in?"
The white little beast blinked its eyes and turned around. Then, right before Chu Ning's eyes, it directly burrowed through the protective restriction without any hindrance. Chu Ning was stunned by this sight. He checked the protective restriction and found that there was no damage whatsoever. Then he used his token to open the protective restriction and walked into the spiritual field, only to find the white little beast standing inside, looking at him adorably.
"Can you go out directly?"
As soon as Chu Ning finished his Divine Sense transmission, the next moment, the white little beast darted straight out of the protective restriction. When Chu Ning came out again, the little beast was wagging its tail.
"What kind of spiritual beast are you exactly? And how did you get here?" After witnessing it several times, Chu Ning increasingly realized the extraordinary nature of this beast. After all, he had never heard of any demonic beast possessing such abilities. The white little beast gave no response to Chu Ning's words. It was unclear if it didn't know its own origins or simply didn't know how to express itself to Chu Ning. Seeing this, Chu Ning could only wave his hand, signaling it to follow him back.
The man and beast headed towards the market city. Chu Ning used his Wind Manipulation Art, but the white little beast's speed was not inferior in the slightest, which greatly astonished Chu Ning.

At this point, Chu Ning also understood that if the creature truly wanted to escape, he probably wouldn't be able to stop it. After all, he couldn't hold a Beast-Trapping Talisman in his hand all day long. What surprised him even more was that the little beast showed no intention of leaving. Instead, as time passed, it drew closer and closer to him. By the time Chu Ning returned to his shop in the market city, the little beast was walking right beside him.
Chu Ning opened the shop door, and the white little beast followed him inside. Its eyes darted around curiously. Immediately, it let out two "ying ying" chirps towards the courtyard at the back. Chu Ning paused slightly, then led the white little beast towards the backyard. He saw the white little beast run towards one of the spiritual plants. Chu Ning was briefly surprised; this spiritual plant was called a Magnolia Fruit, which he had acquired two days prior from a rogue cultivator. This fruit was also an excellent medicinal ingredient for refining elixirs, its value roughly comparable to Golden Essence Fruit. After selling him the Magnolia Fruit, the rogue cultivator had also given him the Magnolia Fruit tree. Chu Ning guessed the rogue cultivator might have dug it up somewhere, and he had planted it directly in his backyard upon receiving it. Among all the plants in the backyard, this Magnolia Fruit was considered the highest-grade spiritual plant, even higher quality than the Green Spirit Fruits Chu Ning had planted himself.
Connecting this to how the little beast had specifically entered his spiritual field among all the others in that area, Chu Ning wondered, "Could it be that this spiritual beast can discern the grade of spiritual plants, or does it have a special sensitivity to spiritual energy?" Thinking this, Chu Ning tentatively communicated with it using Divine Sense. "Can you sense the grade of spiritual plants and the concentration of spiritual energy?"
The white little beast immediately lifted its head, looking somewhat smug. Seeing this, Chu Ning directly took out a Magnolia Fruit from his storage bag – one of those he had previously acquired. "Then, do you eat this?"
"Ying ying!" The white little beast instantly chirped, looking quite pleased. Chu Ning then took out a Magnolia Fruit and tossed it to the creature. The white little beast swallowed it in one gulp, then blinked at Chu Ning. Immediately after, it came up to Chu Ning and rubbed its head against him. Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. He cautiously squatted down and extended his hand, gently stroking its white fur. The white little beast didn't resist; instead, it continued to rub its head against Chu Ning's palm.
As Chu Ning gently stroked the white little beast's head, he transmitted with his Divine Sense: "You're all white and so small, I'll call you 'Little White'. And I'll give you a surname; since you're so spiritual and a spiritual beast, let's make your surname 'Ling'. So, Ling Xiaobai."

"Ying!!" The white little beast chirped, seemingly agreeing with the name Chu Ning had given it. Seeing this, Chu Ning smiled knowingly and stood up, ready to leave. However, after a moment's thought, he squatted down again and transmitted to Ling Xiaobai with his Divine Sense: "Xiaobai, if you want to eat something, you need to tell me first. You can't just eat the things I've planted."
"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai clearly understood, letting out a soft chirp in response. Chu Ning paused, then added another sentence to it. "And you can't just eat things other people have planted either."
Ling Xiaobai chirped again in agreement, and only then did Chu Ning finally relax. Within this market city, he wasn't the only one who cultivated plants. He himself only planted some spiritual plants, but when it came to valuable items, the things Gu Xiaoqing cultivated for alchemy might even be better than his own. Chu Ning certainly didn't want to cause any major trouble because of this little creature.
