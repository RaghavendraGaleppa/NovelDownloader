# Chapter 303: She Understands Military Formations? How Much Power Can He Contain?

Snow was falling.

Locals often said that the Southern Frontier had no spring or autumn, only winter and summer, but this year was particularly unusual. Early winter snow fell softly and early, wrapping the vast Qingmu City in a silver garment.

A troop of riders stopped in front of the 'Jia Wei' Tavern, their fierce steeds breathing white mist from their nostrils.

They were all martial warriors, yet after a night of heavy drinking, they seemed even more spirited in the early morning.

"Brother Li!" Zhong Zhenyue shouted.

"Coming!"

Li Mo had just finished condensing the last of the True Spirits. The Seventy-Two Transformations were now only one step away from completion:

Wuzhiqi.

This True Spirit was even more fierce and untamed than the Yazhi. It was likely the most difficult of all True Spirits to merge into a Divine Ability, yet it was also the one chosen by the Jade Phoenix God.

"I'm heading to the Qingmu Great Camp," Li Mo called out as he changed into his winter clothes.

Since early morning, Ying Bing had been standing by the window, dressed in a white fox-fur coat and a feather-woven long skirt. Her ice-mirror-like eyes gazed southward.

The snow outside the window seemed to gain a touch of stillness and beauty because of her.

Hearing Li Mo's voice, she finally snapped back to reality.

"I'm going too."

"Huh? Would it be inappropriate for a woman to go to the camp..."

"I've already informed Zhong Ling."

Li Mo thought she was probably just curious, so he went downstairs with her.

Then he discovered a problem.

They weren't taking a carriage today, but there was only one extra foal, and Li Mo had never ridden a horse before.

"Brother Li, you don't know how to ride?" Zhong Zhenyue asked.

"Does riding a person count?"

"???"

Young Master Li began to miss Brother Donglai a little.

*Whoosh—*

The young girl beside him gracefully mounted the saddle. Her jade-like left hand gripped the reins, while her other hand reached out toward Li Mo. Snowflakes could be seen landing on her slightly flushed palm.

"Get on."

Young Master Li felt he needed to find a book on riding techniques when he had time.

He'd be willing to spend Martial Dao insights on it, even if it cost him!

Not long after.

The group galloped to the Qingmu Great Camp. The bloodlust rising straight to the heavens from within the camp made the air feel several degrees warmer.

It was still the training ground from yesterday. The ground had been re-packed, but it was much livelier now, with the heads of the various camps' ten-man units present.

On the command platform sat a row of Qingmu City generals. Qu Sheng sat in the chief seat, the steam rising from the tea bowl in his hand.

"Official Wu, I have cultivated a hundred schools of martial arts, but I have never heard of a martial art in this world that allows one to transform into a disaster beast?" Qu Sheng asked with a frown.

"I certainly haven't heard of it."

"Even with Inner and Outer Scenery, it should be impossible. Yet, this young man is definitely not at the Sixth Realm of the Law Body," another blue-robed general added with curiosity.

"We shall see soon enough."

Under Qu Sheng's gaze, a group of riders approached. Guided by the guards, they ascended the command platform.

Li Mo stood on the platform, looking down at the spears like a forest and the spirit like a dragon. A sense of heroic passion arose within him, and his blood boiled even more intensely in the winter air.

*What a scene it would be if a battle started now?*

They say that men find heroic passion on the battlefield, building merit and establishing a career.

Seeing this scene, Young Master Li was genuinely fired up.

Turning around, he saw the various expressions in the eyes of the generals.

Qu Sheng stood up with a smile, his voice clear and bright:

"Li Shaoxia, all the squad leaders and ten-man unit leaders of the entire army are here. I've already boasted about you, and there are no jokes in the military."

His voice could be heard throughout the entire Qingmu Great Camp.

Li Mo was already prepared and nodded.

"Naturally. Which type of disaster beast does the army need experience dealing with?"

The generals discussed for a moment and reached a consensus shortly after.

"The Qiongqi Clan."

"No problem."

"Will I be commanding again?" Zhong Ling asked.

Qu Sheng tossed the command flag from his waist to her and laughed.

"In the army, aside from me, I'm afraid no one's mastery of military formations surpasses yours."

"That's because the Commander taught me well."

Zhong Ling puffed out her chest slightly, her heroic and valiant bearing unable to hide her pride.

She selected over a hundred squad leaders and ten-man unit leaders whose cultivation was at the Internal Qi Realm. Under her command, the military formation moved as fluidly as her own arm in the training ground, filled with killing intent.

These hundred men, under her command, actually gave off the feeling of a thousand soldiers and ten thousand horses.

Ying Bing's deep, clear eyes reflected the military might, a thoughtful look on her face.

At this moment, Zhong Zhenyue, acting as the vanguard's focal point, merged into the military formation. With his addition, the formation became even more grand and imposing, sharp and unstoppable.

"When Young Master Zhong's cultivation is higher in the future, combined with Zhong Ling's military formation, our Southern Frontier will have another ten-thousand-man enemy."

"But yesterday, this Lone Wolf Swordsman, Li Shaoxia, broke the formation alone with a single hammer."

---

"Hm?"

"Li Shaoxia's martial arts should be reliable. After all, he is ranked eleventh on the Hidden Dragon List; he wouldn't boast without reason."

Everyone's eyes were fixed on the field. An ancient, fierce aura was awakening from Li Mo's body. The generals all sat up straight.

The next moment.

A tiger's roar was heard. Li Mo's figure twisted, transforming into a fierce tiger the size of a calf, its fur as stiff as steel needles, and its back sprouting twin wings like heavenly blades.

Exclamations of shock erupted one after another in the training ground.

Such a grand transformation—if they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, who could believe it?

This no longer seemed like a martial art!

The Qiongqi's aura, which seemed to devour people and freeze their hearts, was so tangible it made one's heart clench!

Qu Sheng pondered for a moment and asked:

"Gentlemen, who do you think will win?"

"A pure-blooded Qiongqi of the seventh rank couldn't withstand this formation, right?"

"It's hard to say. Just by looking at the aura, the two sides are evenly matched."

"Hiss... Young Master Zhong,借助 the military formation, is only equal in momentum?"

The generals discussed amongst themselves, but all felt the situation was unclear.

Qu Sheng was about to speak.

"Li Mo will win." A clear, crisp young girl's voice cut through the early snow and reached everyone's ears.

A silence fell over the command platform.

Many generals looked toward the side, where Ying Bing, as white as porcelain holding snow, was brewing tea with her delicate hands. Although they were puzzled in their hearts for a moment, none of them had the urge to go up and ask her.

"Why does she think so?"

"I saw her feeding Li Shaoxia yesterday. What do you think it's for?"

"Oh—~~~~"

Listening to the generals' discussions and sudden realizations, Qu Sheng narrowed his eyes.

He felt that this Cold Immortal Maiden didn't just say that because she hoped Li Mo would win.

Because he felt the same way.

Even Ying Bing had noticed the signs much earlier than he had.

Could it be...

She understood military formations?

In the blink of an eye.

The two sides in the field clashed.

Zhong Zhenyue was at the forefront. He felt he was even stronger than yesterday, his Golden Spear and Iron Horse Body pushed to its limit.

However, this feeling only lasted through the first collision.

"ROAR—"

The Qiongqi, Little Li, let out a tiger's roar.

It was the Qiongqi's bloodline power!

He immediately felt his body grow several times heavier, and all sorts of irritating, distracting thoughts flooded his mind. It felt as if someone was pulling on him, making it impossible to exert his strength.

He wasn't the only one.

The entire military formation was affected by the tiger's roar.

"This is only because my cultivation is too low. If it were a sixth-rank or even fifth-rank Qiongqi, it might have made you all kill each other."

"When fighting the Qiongqi Clan, remember to guard your mind!" Li Mo reminded as he charged forward.

This was only the first bloodline power he had used.

At this point, anyone who wasn't a fool could see that the outcome of the battle was clear.

Li Mo even had the spare capacity to offer reminders while fighting.

He was completely playing a teaching game.

"We can't win."

Zhong Zhenyue sat down on the ground as if he had exhausted all his strength, and the military formation was officially broken.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in the Qingmu City garrison.】
【You have an investment reward to claim.】

The Qiongqi, Little Li, transformed back. For the time being, he didn't claim the reward. Instead, he looked at Zhong Zhenyue with a smile.

"Young Master Zhong, there's no need to be so self-deprecating. A real Qiongqi's physique isn't as strong as mine. Even with its powerful bloodline, it would have been trapped and killed by the military formation just now."

"....."

The soldiers looked at each other.

Who taught you to comfort people like that?
What do you mean, a disaster beast's physique isn't as strong as yours?

Zhong Zhenyue took a deep breath, his eyes burning with intensity.

"Brother Li, didn't we discuss yesterday how much military formation power you can contain?"

"Why don't we... try it now?"
