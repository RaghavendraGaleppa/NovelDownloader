The State of Lu, Jixia Academy.

Jixia Academy stood amidst the Great Marsh.

Across the vast marshlands, hundreds of islands scattered like stars surrounding the academy.

Dou Changsheng did not immediately set foot on the islands. Instead, he settled in a village at the edge of the marsh. The place had a well-established industry chain, with countless people preparing to visit Jixia Academy.
