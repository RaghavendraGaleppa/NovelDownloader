# Chapter 62: Hand Seal, Thunder Dragon, and Artifact Forging

After hearing Han Yue's choice, Li Changle nodded in approval.

He continued to explain to Han Yue:

"To comprehend an innate divine ability at the Body Entry Stage is a rare talent indeed!"

"However, even so, you must not focus too much on cultivating divine abilities and neglect your core cultivation."

"We cultivators must always prioritize the pursuit of immortality above all else!"

"Remember, whether it's divine abilities or magical artifacts, they are merely tools to safeguard our path of cultivation."

"As you progress further in your cultivation, you'll realize that all other dependencies will fade under the erosion of time—except for your own cultivation base."

"Only one's personal cultivation serves as the foundation for everything!"

Han Yue nodded in agreement, deeply resonating with Li Changle's teachings.

Li Changle then said:

"The time to forge your artifact hasn't arrived yet. Wait a few more days. Once I finish my business, your artifact should be ready, and we'll return directly to the sect."

"Although this golden eagle isn't particularly powerful, its flying speed is quite impressive. At full speed, we can return to the sect in just a few days."

Han Yue had no objections to Li Changle's arrangements.

The two continued riding the golden eagle, flying southwest.

With each flap of its wings, the giant eagle stirred massive gusts of wind. Its aura as a third-tier demonic beast cleared the path, startling countless birds and beasts along the way.

Meanwhile, Tu Sheng's battle with the giant turtle was nearing its end.

Their chase had lasted an entire month, spanning thousands of kilometers.

The giant turtle displayed astonishing vitality, enduring countless slashes from the [Abyssal Heavy Sword]!

Though its shell was shattered and its flesh mangled, it stubbornly clung to life.

Truly worthy of being a Holy Son under the Great Sage [Mystic Glass Turtle], its defensive and survival capabilities were remarkable.

Yet even the strongest life force has its limits.

The giant turtle could no longer maintain its [Return to Origin Shield] divine ability!

Now it lay on the ground, awaiting the final flicker of its life.

The [Turtle Spirit Armor], a life-preserving treasure bestowed by the [Mystic Glass Turtle], had already been used.

The ultra-resistant shield conjured by the [Turtle Spirit Armor] had withstood thirteen days of relentless assault!

This fourth-tier longevity treasure also facilitated the most extreme and earth-shattering strike of Tu Sheng's cultivation career!

Though the shield created by the [Turtle Spirit Armor] possessed incredible defensive power, it came with the limitation of immobility.

It remained stationary, enduring Tu Sheng's endless barrage of attacks for thirteen straight days!

This allowed Tu Sheng's [Abyssal Heavy Sword] to accumulate terrifying momentum!

The final strike that shattered the [Turtle Spirit Armor] approached the power of the fourth-tier!

Had it not encountered Tu Sheng, the [Turtle Spirit Armor] would have been indestructible to any third-tier cultivator!

Conversely, without the [Turtle Spirit Armor], Tu Sheng could never have delivered such a strike!

Executing this strike advanced Tu Sheng's cultivation, bringing him one step closer to the fourth-tier longevity realm!

Finally, after one last [Borrowed Momentum], Tu Sheng beheaded the giant turtle, conclusively ending the battle!

Tu Sheng had successfully defeated a Holy Son of the demon race of equal standing.

Moreover, through his own capabilities, he had exhausted his opponent's longevity treasure, leaving no avenue for escape.

Tu Sheng's aura surged with triumph!

The thirteen-day continuous [Borrowed Momentum] strike had granted him new insights into this divine ability.

The retaliatory mission for the destruction of the Flesh Division had exceeded expectations—this single Holy Son Mystic Turtle was worth ten, even a hundred ordinary third-tier demonic beasts.

After collecting the giant turtle's corpse, Tu Sheng immediately mounted his sword light and returned to the Flesh Division headquarters.

Upon returning, he sought out Yang Fan to inquire about Han Yue.

Tu Sheng had noticed Han Yue following on his sword light the entire way.

Han Yue's sword light technique had caught Tu Sheng's attention, sparking his interest in taking him as a disciple.

However, Han Yue had completely vanished from the Flesh Division, and Yang Fan couldn't provide any information about his whereabouts.

Little did they know, Han Yue had already been intercepted by a master and was now thousands of miles away, riding a giant eagle!

Li Changle had traveled far southwest, claiming he needed to retrieve something, though he didn't specify what.

As time passed, Han Yue noticed the golden eagle approaching a small thundercloud!

This thundercloud was peculiar—it contained immense thunder power yet remained restrained, merely moving swiftly across the sky.

The golden eagle closely followed the thundercloud's movements.

Han Yue observed that whenever meteorological changes occurred in the sky, heralding thunderstorms, the thundercloud would rush over and absorb all the thunder power, showing no signs of stopping.

At this moment, Li Changle, who had been meditating on the eagle's back, opened his eyes!

In the next instant, a massive lightning bolt shot up from the ground!

The golden eagle let out a pained cry as its feathers scattered.

Li Changle instantly flew beneath the thundercloud!

Then, with a wave of his hand, a colossal purple-gold hand seal shot forth to capture the thundercloud!

This was the Divine Thunder Sect's secret technique: [Primordial Divine Thunder Great Hand Seal].

One of the most representative divine abilities of the Divine Thunder Palace, widely practiced and beloved by many.

When executed, it manifested an extraordinarily agile hand of magical power, capable of pursuit, capture, transportation, and defense—highly sought after by cultivators!

Li Changle had honed this technique for years, and its activation now unleashed tremendous pressure!

With a single strike from the great hand seal, the thundercloud instantly dispersed, revealing its contents—a sinuous, coiling thunder dragon that shifted like flowing clouds!

This was Han Yue's first glimpse of the mythical creature deeply rooted in his cultural psyche, stirring profound emotions within him.

The thunder dragon stretched and coiled, its body composed of lightning, shimmering in silver and purple—a breathtaking sight!

Strangely, upon seeing Li Changle, the thunder dragon immediately bared its fangs and emitted fierce roars.

But Li Changle responded with another Primordial Divine Thunder Great Hand Seal.

The hand seal clenched into a fist and struck the dragon's head with a thunderous boom!

Yet the thunder dragon neither dodged nor resisted, remaining motionless as its roars ceased.

Li Changle then tossed two objects into the sky.

Han Yue focused his gaze—they were the [Geng Metal Sword Embryo] and metal ingot he had previously given Li Changle!

As the two materials soared into the air, the thunder dragon opened its maw and unleashed two massive bolts of thunderous energy, shattering them!

The energy was ferocious—far surpassing Han Yue's full-powered [Thoughtless Slash] in his perception.

The two extremely hard metal materials instantly vaporized under the energy, losing their forms.

Only two searing-hot clouds of primal metal energy remained suspended in the air.

Li Changle then threw the [Mao Hour Gold] and [Yin Hour Silver] Han Yue had provided, merging them with the two clouds of primal metal energy!

The thunder dragon then erupted with even greater power, condensing bolt after bolt of lightning to bombard the third-tier treasures in midair!

Li Changle was actually using the thunder dragon to forge artifacts!
