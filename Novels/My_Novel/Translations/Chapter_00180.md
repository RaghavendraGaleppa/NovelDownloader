# Chapter 180: The Great Completion of Gang Thunder, A Love-Hate Relationship

The Qi Lake underwent a qualitative transformation, surging like waves.

The thirty-two-zhang-long lake body saw rosy clouds rising, its waters boiling with vitality. A wondrous scene emerged, as if bathed in the scorching sun or the silvery light of the moon.

Li Xian executed his palm technique, the "Azure Veil Palm," its force surging through his palm. Water vapor swirled in the air, refusing to dissipate, gathering into a vortex of mist.

Qi originates from martial arts, and martial arts are drawn from the heavens and earth. Therefore, with the qualitative transformation of the Qi Lake, the internal Qi could linger in the world for longer, producing more profound and marvelous changes.

His progress in the martial path was gratifying.

"I wonder, compared to the prodigies of the Prefecture City, am I stronger or weaker now?"

Li Xian unleashed several palms in a row, the sound echoing around him. He couldn't help but ask himself this question, but he soon came to terms with it. If he is strong, he will become stronger; if he is weak, he will catch up. Let prodigies rise one after another, he would maintain his own composed demeanor.

He practiced until midnight.

After washing up, he returned to his room to rest. The side room was small, but the furnishings and furniture were complete.

The Madam was in seclusion, unable to move. With no one to oversee him, Li Xian's mood was naturally relaxed. He sat in a bamboo chair, gently rocking it. He enjoyed the breeze and focused on reading various books on different paths.

When he felt sleepy, he would close his eyes and sleep.

In the tower, Madam Wen had donned the Silkworm Garment, practicing a strange art, her cultivation slowly advancing. Looking down from the tower, she could see Li Xian practicing his swordplay, elegant and unrestrained.

"The martial path is vast. The concept of innate talent is difficult to generalize. However, Li Xian's 'Azure Veil Palm' and 'Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword' have both made remarkable progress. He is quite intelligent, and by nature diligent, rarely lazy."

Madam Wen, with nothing else to do, watched with great interest. Only when Li Xian entered his room to rest and disappeared from her view did she calm her mind and focus on her internal cultivation.

"The 'Silkworm Garment Jade Polishing Art' will, without mishap, break through in the recent days. Once I step into the sixth layer, my strength will indeed be greater. But I will inevitably be trapped deeper in the cocoon..."

"Such a marvelous art, it truly makes me love and hate it at the same time."

Thinking of this, a slight blush colored her face.

The next day.

Before dawn, Li Xian had already ridden back to Qingning County. Along the way, the shadows of people were sparse, with only a few bun shops open. Passing by one such shop, a fresh batch of meat buns had just come out of the steamer.

Li Xian bought a few taels' worth and returned to the Martial Commandant's Hall.

Before he even entered, the sounds of "Huh," "Ha," and "Ho" could be heard, mixed with Luo Xia's scolding. Li Xian found it amusing inwardly: "Luo Xia isn't bad-looking, but her temper is truly fierce. As the Martial Commandant, I'm quite不合格, being away so often. It must be hard on her."

He tied his horse's reins and walked into the hall. The various officers heard the commotion and immediately looked over. Seeing it was the Martial Commandant, they greeted him before returning to their martial practice. However, a moment later, they felt something was off and turned back to look again, one after another.

But they couldn't figure out what it was, nor could they say what had changed. They all thought to themselves:

"We haven't seen him for a few days. The Martial Commandant's face clearly hasn't changed, but how is it... that he seems to have changed immensely, becoming even more handsome? His aura also seems more extraordinary."

Luo Xia shouted, "Anyone who looks around randomly will get a taste of my iron whip. You all continue training. What are you无关人等 (unrelated people) looking at?"

The officers didn't dare to speak. The only one who would refer to the Martial Commandant as "unrelated people" was the Deputy Martial Commandant. Luo Xia was capable and efficient, tall and slender. She crossed her arms and walked over, saying in surprise, "After not seeing you for over ten days, did you steal some immortal pills?"

"Something like that," Li Xian laughed.

Luo Xia teased, "If you have such good stuff, why didn't you bring some for me to try?"

The two chatted for a while and found a stone pavilion to sit in. Along the way, Luo Xia would shout a few commands,监督 the officers to practice their martial arts seriously.

"By the way..." Luo Xia said, "About that Prodigy Tower Banquet, are you going or not?"

"You know about that too?" Li Xian asked, "I didn't tell anyone."

Luo Xia's gaze had already shifted elsewhere, shouting at the officers to keep their formations neat. Her style was strong and decisive, and she had organized the officers into an orderly group, their numbers now expanded to fifty.

After a long while, Luo Xia replied, "Why would I need you to tell me? The whole of Qingning County knows."

"You've been gone for over ten days, you don't know the changes in the county. The matter of the Prodigy Tower Banquet has spread to all the counties. Rumors are flying everywhere, saying you're afraid to attend the banquet and only know how to bully the weak. If you were to face a true expert, you'd probably wet your pants and run away."

"The rumors are utterly disgusting. Someone is clearly deliberately instigating this, using gossip to provoke you into attending the banquet so they can make a move on you. Without a doubt, it must be the Cao family's doing."

"Will you take the bait?"

Li Xian said, "What reputation is more important than my own life? I won't be provoked."

"That's good," Luo Xia said, slightly relieved.

Li Xian continued, "But I really do have to go to this Tower Banquet."

"And you said you wouldn't be provoked?" Luo Xia said, exasperated.

Li Xian said, "The Madam is going, what can I do?"

Luo Xia patted Li Xian's shoulder, encouraging him, "You're quite lucky with the ladies, enjoy it." As she was speaking, she suddenly saw an officer whose movements were sloppy and highly irregular. She strode over, kicked him to the ground, and gave him a loud scolding. The officer quickly scrambled to his feet and corrected his posture.

The two chatted for a quarter of an hour. After Li Xian learned about the recent situation in the city and saw how busy Luo Xia was, he didn't want to disturb her further. He returned to the inner courtyard to prepare for the day's training.

After eating the meat buns, he immediately practiced two sets of "Four Directions Fist" and "Breeze Legs" to loosen his joints and muscles, regulate his blood and Qi, and lift his spirits. Then, he got to the main business. His chest drummed with thunder, and his fingers shot out like lightning.

He focused on diligent practice, supplemented by the Thunderclap Ore. With the combination of the two, his Gang Thunder Finger progressed very quickly.

After several hours of such arduous practice, he had advanced from [Proficient] to [Minor Accomplishment].

[Gang Thunder Finger]
[Proficiency: 15/3000 Minor Accomplishment]

The Gang Thunder Finger has four lethal techniques: Shocking Thunder, Resounding Thunder, Frightening Thunder, and Gang Thunder. The moves are simple, aiming to kill the enemy with a single finger. Li Xian first practiced "Shocking Thunder," and with the minor accomplishment of the martial art, he could now execute it at will.

He had also dabbled in the other three techniques: Resounding Thunder, Frightening Thunder, and Gang Thunder. Each has its own unique marvel, all based on the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound."

"The Prodigy Tower Banquet is approaching. I need to strive to bring the Gang Thunder Finger to Great Completion. Though it won't be as powerful as the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword, it is more than enough to serve as a hidden trump card. Moreover, after a martial art reaches Great Completion, one can achieve mastery and fluency, with moves that change unpredictably."

"When facing an enemy, applying the four lethal techniques of the Gang Thunder Finger flexibly into other moves would also be incredibly powerful."

Li Xian possessed many fortuitous encounters: the Iron Copper Body, the Eighty-One Bone and Sinew Forging, the Spine like a Divine Mountain, the Gang Thunder Finger—all these martial arts could enhance his physical strength.

Combined with his innate strong bones and sinews, the power of his dual pupils, and his perfect physique... Li Xian's experience was still shallow; he did not know the true weight of these things.

Time passed.

Li Xian advanced diligently every day, accumulating 600 proficiency points daily, supplemented by the Thunderclap Stones. By the seventh day of the tenth month, he had already stepped into the Great Completion realm of the Gang Thunder Finger.

[Gang Thunder Finger]
[Proficiency: 15/10000 Great Completion]

He had gained the [Hear the Thunder] trait, allowing him to hear the rolling thunder and know where it will strike.

After that, the Gang Thunder Finger continued to be cultivated, advancing in tandem with the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword. The sword art progressed very quickly, with medicinal baths and dual cultivation becoming more frequent, as he was living in the Madam's side room, just a few steps away from her.

Li Xian often inquired about the essence of the sword art. The Madam practiced the Yin Sword, so logically, she would find it difficult to offer guidance. However, the Madam's martial path was profound, and she could draw inferences from other cases. The suggestions she gave were often extremely useful.

For all these reasons.

The first layer had already been perfected, and he had stepped into the [Great Completion] of the second layer, catching a glimpse of the initial scenery of the martial path.

He saw the immortal couple of Yin and Yang, enjoying their union and sleeping together, dancing their swords freely in the heavens and earth, a truly exhilarating sight. Li Xian gained some enlightenment from this initial scenery, his mind stirred. The next day, during his dual cultivation with the Madam, the scene unconsciously came to his mind.

The Madam, drawn by the artistic conception, was overjoyed, as if in a dream, her spirit moved. She was truly a rare genius. Seizing the inspiration, her sword hummed. At the transition between day and night, at the dividing line of Yin and Yang, she used her sword to gather the Yin and Yang essence, cleansing the bodies of the two.

They benefited immensely.

The power of Yin and Yang in the heavens and earth was far beyond what a medicinal bath could compare to. It could slow the wear of time, preserve one's appearance and beauty, and add an immortal aura.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, since you have the Silkworm Garment Jade Polishing Art, why do you still value this sword art so much?"

"High-level martial arts are inherently difficult to find. This sword art, when dual cultivated, has power that surpasses even high-level sword arts," Madam Wen said. "The truly rare aspect of this sword art is that it touches upon the principles of Yin and Yang. It is a great opportunity. Your cultivation is shallow, so you naturally don't understand."

Madam Wen saw that Li Xian had already achieved Great Completion in the second layer and could now practice the third. Although the third layer's sword moves were powerful, they were rather explicit. During dual cultivation, it required deep affection and endless pleasure. When passion is at its peak and the sword is at its fiercest, it would require... There were also the Seven-Day and Hundred-Day barriers.

Though all this was bound to happen sooner or later, Madam Wen wanted to wait a little longer.

She instructed Li Xian to continue refining the sword art and not to neglect it.

A few days later, the manor once again raised the cauldron to boil the refined food. Madam Wen said, "The path of consuming essence cannot be rushed. It will happen naturally when the time is right."

She instructed Li Xian to consume two grams every two days, maintaining this pace.

[Consuming Essence]
[Proficiency: 48/100]

In the blink of an eye, it was the twelfth day of the tenth month, the eve of their departure for the Prefecture City.

Qingning County.

Considering the long journey, the round trip to the Prefecture City would take more than ten days. On the night before their departure, Li Xian held a grand banquet, inviting the officers of the Martial Commandant's Hall to drink and eat heartily together at a tavern.

He spent his money generously.

On the tables were mountain delicacies and sea treasures, over a dozen delicious dishes. The fragrance wafted everywhere, making everyone's mouths water.

"Martial Commandant, may you win the championship in one fell swoop!" an officer said, raising his wine cup.

"What's so great about the Prefecture City? Let them see the might of our Martial Commandant!"

Everyone conversed to their hearts' content.

Luo Xia was in high spirits. She asked the waiter for strong liquor and even wanted to compete with Li Xian in drinking. She lost repeatedly, and after a few bouts, she was soon drunk on the ground, unconscious.

At the banquet, everyone was completely uninhibited. They ate, drank, and spoke as they pleased.

The group drank heroically, feasting on the delicacies on the table with great joy. After a few rounds of drinks, Li Xian was slightly tipsy. Looking at his brothers who had fought through life and death with him and were loyal to the core, he suddenly thought: "In my current situation, I've carved out my own small world in Qingning County. But..."

He looked out the window at the bright moon, the vaster sky, the scattered stars, and the infinite wonders, and thought again: "I'll be able to see Xiao Fan soon. The Prefecture City... an even vaster world?"

"This journey, though I have the Madam for company, I must still be careful. The Prefecture City is the Cao family's territory. Overt spears are easy to dodge, but hidden arrows are hard to guard against."

His mind was a flurry of thoughts.

Excitement, worry... all sorts of feelings welled up. He suddenly felt a bit stifled and decided to wander around, returning to his old residence to take a look.

Though Luo Xia had taken the position of Deputy Martial Commandant, she still lived in the old residence. She would occasionally go back to see Liu and Wang, the old couple.

The old residence was clean and tidy, and the thatched roof had been newly renovated.

The next day.

At the gate of the One Harmony Manor.

The Madam's long hair was tied up, with three silver hairpins slanted in it, pearls hanging from their ends. Her appearance was beautiful and adorned, with earrings and necklaces complementing her perfectly.

Li Xian supported her with his hand. A horse stool had already been placed, and he had lifted the carriage curtain beforehand, his actions thorough and complete. Madam Wen nodded slightly, the jade beads lightly clinking as she sat inside the carriage. Her voice came out: "Let us depart."

Holding the reins, Li Xian gave a loud shout. The steed "White Cloud," its hooves carrying the wind, sped along the official road toward the Prefecture City.
