**Chapter 193: Metamorphosis! Immortal Seed!**  

"The reward for the hundredth place is zero?"  

As the voice of the secret realm's spirit faded, Zhang Jing's gaze froze momentarily.  

Since joining the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, this was the first time he had heard of a reward being zero.  

Wait—  

A sudden realization struck him.  

There were only a hundred participants in the final ranking battle. This meant that even if the man named Qi Yunteng forfeited all ninety-nine matches, his rank would remain unchanged.  

From this perspective, it made some sense.  

Moreover...  

Zhang Jing subconsciously did the math.  

Just by reaching the final round—excluding the various Proud Cloud Marks or True Intentions—the accumulated fortune rewards from the previous rounds alone were astronomical.  

Twenty million from the first round, one hundred million from the second, and nine hundred million from the third.  

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly.  

"Without calculating, I wouldn’t have known... I currently have one billion and twenty million units of fortune in hand?!"  

He was inwardly stunned.  

If he remembered correctly, the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability inheritance he had previously considered cost only nine hundred and ninety million units of fortune.  

In other words, even without the reward for ranking first this time, Zhang Jing already had enough fortune to purchase the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability inheritance upon his return.  

At this thought, he couldn’t help but feel another surge of gratitude toward Senior Brother Xuan Yuan, who had informed him about the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.  

This trip had been immensely profitable.  

Meanwhile, the grand voice of the secret realm's spirit continued.  

"Seventy-first place, Li Ying!"  

"Ranking reward—one billion one hundred seventy-one million units of fortune!"  

...  

Time passed slowly.  

"Forty-third place, Duan Lingshan!"  

"Ranking reward—two billion three hundred million units of fortune!"  

As the voice faded, Zhang Jing saw a woman on a nearby platform jump excitedly.  

A faint smile flickered in his eyes.  

He remembered this woman well—she had been his first opponent in this round and was one of the few participants who didn’t belong to the seven immortal orthodoxies of the human race.  

Shifting his gaze away, Zhang Jing pondered further.  

By now, he had begun to discern a pattern in the secret realm's fortune distribution.  

Broadly speaking, there was a massive gap between the rewards for the top hundred and those below—a difference exceeding tenfold.  

Similar gaps existed between the top ten thousand and the initial hundred thousand participants in the first round.  

However, within the top hundred, the distribution wasn’t as skewed as Zhang Jing had initially speculated. The difference in rewards between adjacent ranks was minimal.  

"It seems the secret realm's spirit favors an equitable distribution of fortune," Zhang Jing mused silently, his expression unreadable.  

He had already estimated his reward for ranking first.  

Combined with his existing fortune, the total far exceeded the "one-thousandth of the total fortune rewards" that Senior Brother Xuan Yuan had mentioned.  

Zhang Jing didn’t know why this discrepancy existed, nor did he care to investigate.  

More fortune was always welcome.  

...  

"Twenty-seventh place, Liu Weng!"  

"Ranking reward—two billion nine hundred forty-nine million units of fortune!"  

Boom—  

The spectator stands erupted in uproar once more.  

Countless envious and jealous eyes fixated on the Foundation Establishment cultivators within the secret realm—whether on the platforms or the Hero Island below.  

Many were red-eyed, panting heavily, their faces twisted with longing.  

When had fortune rewards ever been measured in billions?!  

Some of these spectators had agonized over spending a few hundred units of fortune just to enter the secret realm as observers.  

Yet here were their peers, receiving rewards in the billions or even tens of billions.  

The disparity was staggering.  

"Tens of billions of fortune... heavens! That’s enough resources to cultivate to immortality. If only I could get a fraction of that," someone lamented.  

But they were immediately rebuked.  

"Why would they share with you?"  

"Exactly! Don’t forget, these hundred participants survived brutal elimination rounds from over thirty-eight million Foundation Establishment experts."  

"They’ve earned these rewards fair and square."  

"No wonder the secret realm’s spirit named this place Hero Island," another sighed, admiration and envy lacing their voice.  

"Those who remain here till the end are true heroes."  

...  

**Mid-Level Space**  

You Yuanming’s expression had shifted from initial shock to numb disbelief.  

"The first place in the Foundation Establishment realm is actually Zhang Jing? He’s only been cultivating in the upper realm for thirty-odd years!"  

The thought alone sent shivers down his spine.  

Coupled with the tens of billions of fortune Zhang Jing had just acquired—and an innate divine ability—You Yuanming could foresee the gap between himself and his former junior brother widening rapidly until Zhang Jing’s back vanished beyond the horizon.  

He exhaled softly.  

"How could such a monstrous genius emerge from a mortal family? Could it be, as the Pavilion Master speculated, that he’s the reincarnation of an upper-realm powerhouse?"  

The question gnawed at him.  

Just then, his senior brother turned to him curiously.  

"By the way, junior brother, we’ve been in Proud Cloud Immortal City for over three months. Why haven’t you visited that acquaintance from the lower realm?"  

After a pause, he added,  

"Don’t mind me. If you want to meet them, go ahead. The Great Boundless Dao of Taiyi is vast. If you miss this chance, reuniting later will be far harder."  

You Yuanming’s expression turned peculiar.  

After a moment’s hesitation, he decided honesty was best.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, forgive me for borrowing your reputation. Perhaps this will smooth my path forward," he thought apologetically.  

Before ascending to the Taiyi Dao Sect, he had believed his Golden Nature Dao Foundation would make him a standout genius even in the upper realm.  

But reality had humbled him.  

Golden Nature Dao Foundation cultivators were indeed geniuses—just far more numerous than he’d imagined.  

It was merely a foundation, a starting point.  

The road ahead in the Foundation Establishment realm was long.  

Compared to the hundred in the secret realm—or even the ten thousand from earlier—he was insignificant. Any one of them could crush him like an ant.  

Such was the gap.  

Snapping back to the present, You Yuanming wore a proud smile as he addressed his senior brother.  

"I won’t hide this from you, senior brother. The acquaintance I mentioned is Zhang Jing. We hail from the same Dao Academy in the lower realm."  

His senior brother’s eyes glazed over.  

After a long pause, he pointed shakily at the projection of the secret realm.  

"Wait... you mean the current rank one in the secret realm?"  

You Yuanming nodded.  

"You two came from the same lower-realm Dao Academy?"  

Another nod.  

His senior brother’s breath hitched.  

"Then that means... he’s only been cultivating in our Taiyi Great Boundless Dao Sect for about thirty years?"  

"Correct. And he’s still young—not even sixty years old yet," You Yuanming added bluntly.  

His senior brother’s face went slack.  

"Not even sixty?!" he gasped. "How could such a monster emerge from our Lower Realm’s Nine Domains lineage?!"  

...  

**On the Platform**  

Zhang Jing stood motionless, the secret realm’s spirit’s announcements echoing in his ears.  

As time passed, the voice grew increasingly impassioned.  

"Second place, Chang Jin!"  

"Ranking reward—three billion nine hundred fifty-nine million units of fortune!"  

The moment the words fell, every gaze—including those of the Ten Thousand Races faction—shifted between the golden sun in the sky and Zhang Jing on the platform.  

Envy burned in their eyes.  

Zhang Jing remained unfazed, calmly watching the secret realm’s spirit above.  

Then—  

"First place, Zhang Jing!"  

"Ranking reward—four billion units of fortune!"  

"And an additional reward: the innate divine ability, Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud."  

The secret realm’s spirit looked at Zhang Jing approvingly.  

"Congratulations, Zhang Jing. This first place is well-deserved. Among all Foundation Establishment rank ones in history, you rank within the top ten."  

"Thank you," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.  

The spirit continued,  

"The remaining four hundred billion units of fortune have been condensed into Proud Sun Fragmentary Marks, Proud Sun Decrees, Proud Sun True Intentions, and the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud divine ability."  

But no one was listening.  

All eyes were fixed on the golden sun descending from the heavens.  

Soon, Zhang Jing was enveloped in radiant golden light.  

"It’s here," he thought, his eyes gleaming.  

Within his sea of consciousness, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Law Seed—long prepared—began to tremble faintly.  

Five-colored spiritual light flickered incessantly.  

A warm sensation blossomed at his brow.  

Golden radiance flooded his sea of consciousness as a golden sun slowly descended, as if to merge with it.  

But then—  

Hum!  

The five-colored Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Law Seed flashed abruptly, darting toward the golden sun.  

Without hesitation, it collided head-on.  

Boom—  

Turbulent waves surged in his sea of consciousness.  

Yet in the next instant, a mysterious glow emanated from the jade talisman in his Niwan Palace.  

An ineffable, profound aura spread, instantly calming the storm.  

The five-colored light and golden radiance intertwined as the Law Seed and the golden sun began to merge.  

Ethereal immortal light gradually coalesced.  

Time seemed to stretch.  

The golden sun vanished without a trace.  

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Law Seed—no, it was now the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed—returned to the jade talisman’s side.  

Zhang Jing’s consciousness shifted inward.  

And then—  

He froze.  

The transformed Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, now an Immortal Seed after merging with the Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud divine ability, was utterly unrecognizable.  

Mysterious Dao patterns wove together into a six-layered cloud resembling an immortal terrace.  

Six-colored immortal light swirled atop it, accompanied by the faint echoes of profound Dao truths.  

At its center hovered a faint, indifferent divine eye, capable of piercing the Nine Netherworlds and the Myriad Heavens with a single glance—or unleashing annihilating rays.  

A flood of information surged into Zhang Jing’s mind.  

After a long while, awe dawned in his heart.  

"Five peerlessly mighty immortal lights—Gathering Origin, Crimson Divinity, Dao Guidance, Primal Origin, and Chaos Genesis—along with the Mind’s Golden Sun and the Heaven-Piercing Immortal Eye... Is this the terror of an Immortal Seed?"  

Returning to reality, he glanced at the jade talisman.  

The original entry—**[Supreme-Grade Law Seed: Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud]**—had vanished without a trace.
