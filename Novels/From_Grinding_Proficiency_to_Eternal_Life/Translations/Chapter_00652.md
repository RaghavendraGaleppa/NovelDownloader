# Chapter 652: The Ultimate Golden Nature of Ninety-Night Strands

Under the Golden Core realm, it unleashed a terrifying power that defied reason.

This move not only temporarily relieved Xu Yunfan from being the center of a focused assault, but it was also like throwing a bucket of cold water into a boiling pot of oil.

The battlefield, already bloodthirsty and agitated by the successive provocations of Xu Yunfan and Qingyuan Zhenjun, fell into a momentary lull before descending into utter madness once more.

Everyone abandoned defense, knowing only how to attack relentlessly.

The three Main Gods, their wills distorted, instantly viewed each other's erratic actions as the most fatal betrayal and the fiercest attack. They completely lost their lock on Xu Yunfan, issuing endless orders for slaughter through their supreme authority.

Sensing the drastic shift in their Main Gods' wills and the undisguised killing commands, the gods under their command had no time to discern the truth. Bound by the supreme authority, the gods of the three pantheons had no way to resist. Even the Thunder God's Core within Xu Yunfan's body kept fluctuating violently.

He raised his eyebrows slightly. With a sweep of his Divine Celestial Thunder Power, the Thunder God's Core completely suppressed the influence relying on the authority of the Nature System Main God.

Even though the Heavenly Dao of this world was on guard, it was still silently affected by Qingyuan Zhenjun's use of the "Nether Erosion Talisman." If Xu Yunfan hadn't cultivated the same method to perfection, he would have been affected without realizing it.

This was truly the art of manipulating karma, killing people without a trace.

At this point, the great混战 (great battle) between the pantheons, without any reservations, erupted fully.

The light of divine power explosions rose one after another, like countless suns rising and dying out over the Aeterra Continent.

The entire continent let out a groan under the unbearable burden. The earth cracked, the sky shattered, and the laws of nature became chaotic.

This chaotic battlefield instantly turned into an even more efficient meat grinder for gods.

The number of fallen gods continued to rise.

A chill rose in Xu Yunfan's heart.

Qingyuan Zhenjun's actions were certainly not to help him. He was nakedly turning the entire Aeterra battlefield into a larger, more efficient furnace for refining gods.

The behavior Xu Yunfan had painstakingly incited the divine war and secretly harvested was now being accelerated by this Golden Core Zhenjun using his Golden Core realm's secret arts. This accelerated the process of the world's Heavenly Dao origin manifesting its collapse due to the massive death of gods.

This Zhenjun of the Primordial Origin Sect wanted the entire origin of Aeterra.

What a huge appetite.

Xu Yunfan exhaled, calming his somewhat chaotic aura.

He glanced at the three Main Gods not far away, who were attacking each other under the influence of Qingyuan Zhenjun, and couldn't help but shake his head internally.

Just as Qingyuan Zhenjun had said, they possessed authority but did not understand the true essence of the Great Dao. Even fighting on their home turf with the help of the Heavenly Dao, they ended up like this.

"This is a good opportunity," Xu Yunfan thought, his mind racing.

He naturally had to seize the time when Qingyuan Zhenjun was temporarily willing to let things be, and quickly snatch the last four strands of Golden Nature to complete his goal of ninety-nine strands.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept across the battlefield.

A high-ranking god of the Darkness System, Malduc, the Nightmare of Eternal Night, who was trying to blend into the shadows and escape the chaos.

Not affected?

Malduc transformed into a deep, writhing shadow, silently trying to escape into the void.

Xu Yunfan moved with the thunder, the Star Spirit Banner operating at full power. The trajectories of the celestial stars suddenly contracted, and eighty-one brilliant starlight phantoms condensed in an instant into a star-piercing giant sword that spanned the heavens. Ignoring the distance of space, it斩落 (slashed down) with the power to cleave the void.

He secretly used the Nether Erosion Talisman, causing the target's body to suddenly freeze and his expression to become dazed.

By the time Malduc reacted and let out a horrified shriek, his divine body had already been pinned to the shattered earth by the giant star sword, his shadow realm crumbling inch by inch.

Immediately after, the Erosion Talisman and the Purple Gold Divine Thunder followed like maggots in the bone,钻入 (burrowing into) the core of his shadow.

With a slight flick of his finger, it was collected.

The ninety-sixth strand of Golden Nature was in hand.

High above in the heavens, watching Xu Yunfan's skillful operation, Qingyuan Zhenjun's eyes flashed with brilliance, and a sense of unease rose in his heart.

Damn, he can play it like this?

The three Main Gods beside him also completely awakened from the influence of the secret art at this moment, roaring as they attacked Qingyuan Zhenjun.

In an instant, the sky and earth lost their color, and all things fell silent.

Qingyuan Zhenjun glanced at them. Although his expression was slightly serious, he didn't pay too much attention to it. For now, capturing Xu Yunfan came first.

He no longer just watched from the sidelines and took a step forward.

The clear qi beneath his feet condensed into a solid jade staircase. He seemed to be strolling leisurely, yet he instantly跨越了 (crossed) the distance of space.

A large hand, entwined with the clear qi of an immortal palace, as if containing the universe,抓去 (grabbed) towards the Star Spirit Banner hovering above Xu Yunfan's head with a terrifying power that could suppress all laws.

This grab contained the suppressing might of a Golden Core's Heavenly Cave. The space around Xu Yunfan instantly solidified like crystal, his mana slowed, and the dark light of the Star Spirit Banner dimmed and stagnated.

At the moment of life and death, Xu Yunfan held nothing back.

The ninety-six strands of Golden Nature within his Dantian roared and swam frantically.

"Second Sword... Calamity Annihilation!!"

A roar that shook the soul erupted from his heart.

The second Golden Core Sword Intent bestowed by the Pure Yang Ancestor, Lu Chunyang—the terrifying sword light containing the true meaning of the annihilation of all things—exploded forth.

This scene made Qingyuan Zhenjun's heart tremble. The power of the "Second Sword: Calamity Annihilation" had almost caused his Dao Fruit to fall before, so he naturally had a psychological shadow.

Sizzle!

It was like a red-hot烙铁 (branding iron) cutting into ten-thousand-year-old ice.

The sword light containing the true meaning of Pure Yang destruction actually cut a thin but crucial gap in the space frozen by the power of the Golden Core's Heavenly Cave.

The Star Spirit Banner's dark light暴涨 (exploded), enveloping Xu Yunfan like a slippery loach,险之又险 (extremely narrowly) slipping out from under the large, sky-covering clear qi hand.

But that was it.

This sword intent was completely inferior to the Golden Core Sword Intent Xu Yunfan had used before.

"You... you can actually still use the Pure Yang Sword Intent?!"

Qingyuan Zhenjun grabbed nothing but air, and for the first time, an undisguised gloom appeared on his face. He looked at the trace of golden sword intent left on his fingertips, and the killing intent in his eyes became tangible.

This truly made his heart skip a beat.

Xu Yunfan, who had fled a thousand miles away, heard this. Seeing that the attack of the three Main Gods had already reached Qingyuan Zhenjun, he smiled slightly.

"Lu Chunyang of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect is my Pure Yang Ancestor."

With these words, Qingyuan Zhenjun naturally knew that Lu Chunyang, like Xu Yunfan, had come from the Divine Martial World.

He snorted coldly but had to deal with the attack of the three Main Gods.

Using the breathing room he had bought with the gap, Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense surged wildly.

The Nether Erosion Talisman was operated to an unprecedented extreme, no longer seeking to capture and refine, but only for the most violent destruction and plunder.

He transformed into the most terrifying ghost on the battlefield. Under the cover of the crumbling Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array, every flicker of his figure was accompanied by the piercing scream of a Mid-Rank God and the explosion of their God Core.

Ninety-seventh strand!

A Mid-Rank God of the Darkness System, the "Corrosive Poison Vine," was entangled by the Erosion Talisman at its core, instantly withering and collapsing!

Ninety-eighth strand!

A Mid-Rank God of the Light System, the "Holy Shield Guard," was pierced through the God Core by a Purple Gold Thunder Spear, his holy light armor as flimsy as paper!

Ninety-ninth strand!!!

A Mid-Rank God of the Nature System, the "Thorny Earth," who attempted to self-destruct, was forcibly suppressed by the Star Dou Array, and his God Core was forcefully抽出 (pulled out) and crushed!

Six strands of Immortal Golden Nature, despite significant waste, finally reached the level of ninety-nine strands.
