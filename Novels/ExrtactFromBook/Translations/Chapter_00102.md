# Chapter 100: What It Means to Be a True Disciple  

Qiqi transformed into countless raindrops that scattered across the earth, charging toward the surrounding Gold-Devouring Bees.  

Seeing that the battle had begun, Wubing no longer held back and issued the command for all the bees to attack!  

In the distance, where thousands of bees had gathered, an immense surge of spiritual power erupted!  

The sight of thousands of Gold-Devouring Bees unleashing their Golden Wind simultaneously was nothing short of spectacular!  

Metallic spiritual energy swept through the sky, leaving no gaps untouched.  

Every single raindrop was dispersed by the Golden Wind.  

Under the relentless assault of the swarm, the tiny ladybugs were reduced to dust, vanishing without a trace in the wind.  

With no targets left, the bees gradually ceased their attacks.  

Before them lay nothing—Qiqi had disappeared without a trace!  

Just as Wubing and the swarm were left bewildered, Qiqi’s elusive voice suddenly echoed through the wind:  

"Your bee formation is indeed impressive, but it seems you know little of my Five Bamboo Sect."  

"We cultivators of the Five Bamboo Sect excel in manipulating insects and serpents. While this bee formation might be formidable to others, it’s hardly enough to challenge us."  

"In fact, I should thank you for gathering all the Gold-Devouring Bees within thousands of miles here. You’ve saved me a great deal of effort!"  

"Had I done this myself, just the cost of using Tracking Bugs would’ve been unbearable!"  

Her voice carried a lighthearted tone, drifting unpredictably through the air.  

Wubing and the bee kings searched frantically for the source of the voice when, suddenly, a light rain began to fall from the sky.  

Golden Blade Gorge was a place where rain rarely fell—this sudden downpour was anything but natural!  

The raindrops quickly soaked every giant bee in the swarm.  

Every bee touched by the rain, regardless of rank, became encased in a transparent film.  

Upon closer inspection, the film was composed of countless minuscule ladybugs!  

These bugs were incredibly tiny, infused with an unusual spiritual energy that allowed them to penetrate the bees’ armored shells and burrow deep into their bodies!  

The giant bees struggled to resist the invading ladybugs but found themselves utterly powerless.  

The ladybugs’ spiritual energy was of an exceptionally high grade, with unparalleled penetrating power. In no time, they had infiltrated the bees’ bodies.  

First-tier bees began plummeting from the sky like raindrops!  

Only the second-tier bee kings managed to hold on, barely resisting the ladybugs’ assault.  

The once-swarming sky was now littered with fallen bees, leaving only twenty-two bee kings hovering in the air.  

Then, the raindrops in the sky converged upon these remaining bee kings!  

In an instant, the water film encasing them expanded into massive liquid spheres!  

The spheres then transformed into enormous, millstone-sized ladybugs that began voraciously devouring the bee kings’ bodies!  

Their mandibles sliced through the bee kings’ armor like scythes, feasting on their flesh and blood.  

Soon, even the bee kings perished.  

A single rain had claimed the lives of thousands of demonic beasts!  

Silence fell over the battlefield—no wind, no rain, only the grotesque sound of ladybugs feasting on the corpses of the fallen bees.  

Qiqi, the fourth true disciple of the Five Bamboo Sect, was a prodigy.  

She possessed two supreme water-controlling divine abilities: River-Splitting and Rain-Transformation.  

With such talents, she should have been a perfect candidate for cultivating the True Water Arts. Yet, she had instead joined the Five Bamboo Sect and mastered its foundational scripture, *The Noon-Midnight Dragon-Subduing Pestilence Sutra*.  

Moreover, she had forged her own path by refining a unique third-tier Gu: the Raindrop Gu. Merging with this Gu, she could transform into a rain of insects, all under the control of her divine abilities!  

Qiqi’s combat system was flawlessly constructed, allowing her to achieve effortless victories in battle, often catching her enemies completely off guard.  

In the Bamboo Continent, both humans and demons knew of the Five Bamboo Sect’s three female true disciples—a cicada, a raindrop, and a crabapple blossom—who dominated the region.  

This time was no exception. Wubing had painstakingly gathered these Gold-Devouring Bees over thousands of miles, only for them to be wiped out in a single rain by a true disciple of the Five Bamboo Sect!  

The fat bear had long since vanished from the scene.  

Shortly after the rain began, Wubing sensed through the Pure Yang Heart Curse that its countless linked objects had abruptly severed their connection.  

Realizing something was terribly wrong, it immediately turned and fled toward Iron-Eater City.  

This female cultivator was terrifying!  

Even now, Wubing couldn’t believe that its mighty swarm of Gold-Devouring Bees had been so effortlessly crushed by a true disciple of a major sect.  

Regret overwhelmed Wubing. Why had it ever thought to provoke such a monstrous opponent?  

The thought of losing its twenty-three hives—each capable of producing invaluable resources—filled it with despair. Tears streamed down its face as it fled through Golden Blade Gorge.  

The fat bear ran and wept, completely unaware that a glistening liquid was gathering on its back.  

Unbeknownst to Wubing, the distance it thought was safe still fell within Qiqi’s perception range.  

She had already secretly planted a portion of her spiritual energy on the bear’s body.  

There was no escape.  

As Wubing ran for its life, Qiqi’s voice suddenly echoed in its ears:  

"You’re from the Iron-Eater Clan, aren’t you?"  

"These bees were under your control? And that strange curse—was that your divine ability? It’s quite impressive! Care to teach it to me?"  

Wubing stumbled in fright.  

This time, it was truly terrified.  

This female cultivator from the Five Bamboo Sect was the most horrifying being it had ever encountered!  

Every fiber of its being screamed in alarm, sensing imminent death.  

Wubing roared madly, desperately channeling its spiritual energy.  

But as the weakest in combat, it stood no chance against the encroaching Raindrop Gu that slowly enveloped its body.  

Just then, a streak of golden light flashed across the sky as a figure suddenly appeared in the air.  

A massive bolt of lightning descended upon the panda, striking it down in an instant, leaving its body charred and twitching on the ground.  

Fortunately, the Raindrop Gu’s energy was also obliterated by the thunder.  

Han had arrived just in time!  

Landing before the convulsing, foaming bear, Han shoved a large clump of Sweet Dew into its mouth and patted its tear-streaked face reassuringly.  

Then, he soared into the air above the battlefield, now littered with bee corpses.  

Beneath him, countless ladybugs feasted on the remains, emitting a grotesque cacophony of chewing sounds that sent shivers down the spine.  

A delicate young woman in ornate robes and a jeweled crown strolled gracefully among the carnage.  

She looked up at Han, her expression still tinged with resentment and displeasure.  

"So, the mastermind finally shows himself," Qiqi said coolly.  

"Might I ask your name, fellow Daoist? Do you have anything to say for yourself?"  

By now, Han had fully recovered from his previous Thunder Summoning and was in peak condition.  

Through the Heart Demon Curse, he had gained a profound understanding of what it truly meant to be a true disciple of a major sect.  

This seemingly frail young woman, Qiqi, had displayed strength far beyond his expectations.  

And that only fueled his battle lust even further!
