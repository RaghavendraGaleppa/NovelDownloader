# Chapter 279: All Karma, Our Fortunes and Misfortunes Are Intertwined (1/2)

At the heart of the Divine Jade, there was no sun or moon, only the radiant glow of the Jade Phoenix God.

If any demon race were here, just by sensing the aura within, their bloodline would become purer. This was the seed of hope the woman had left for the myriad races of future generations. As long as the Jade Phoenix God existed, the clans that had vanished were not truly extinct.

It was the hope left by the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix for all races.

"Perhaps... I am not meant to be its master?"

Ying Bing lowered her head slightly, her jade-like face reflecting the magnificent light. Her eyelashes trembled slightly as she avoided looking at the Jade Phoenix God.

"Huh? Who else is qualified besides you? I'll go kill them."

Li Mo widened his eyes.

Who had such audacity? To be qualified to compete with Ice Cube for something and ruin his investment plan.

Then.

He met the girl's lifted, clear, and deep eyes.

"Me?"

Li Mo pointed at his own nose, momentarily stunned.

To be honest.

Other than having considerable wealth, a hammer talent unparalleled in the world, culinary skills that master various cuisines, and being somewhat handsome... what else was he?

The Jade Phoenix God wasn't just a divine artifact; it carried the weight of destiny. He felt he couldn't bear it.

Ice Cube was different. She had a Red Destiny, was the Phoenix Empress, and was so dazzlingly talented she could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with heaven-defying monsters.

"Mm."

Ying Bing stared intently at him, her eyes reflecting the boy's astonished expression.

She remembered that day under the Marriage Tree, when they were chatting casually. Li Mo was preoccupied with sending a letter to Fu Yingzi, worried about not finding the girl's father.

He talked about his journey's sights and experiences: the corrupt officials who inverted right and wrong, the border guards skilled at changing faces, the mother and daughter relying on each other, the food eaten by ordinary people in the southern frontier.

He never once cared about the Divine Jade from beyond the heavens.

"...Ice Cube."

"Hm?"

"Actually, is there a possibility that it doesn't matter who keeps the Divine Jade?"

Li Mo said seriously.

"..."

Hearing this, Ying Bing's jade-like face froze for a moment, her mind going blank for an instant.

She bit her lip lightly, lost in thought.

Hmm.

Little Li's thinking was that since they could connect their spirits through dual cultivation and share their minds, they could both look into the true spirits of the myriad races within the Jade Phoenix God together. There was no need to distinguish so clearly whose it was...

Why wasn't Ice Cube saying anything?

"Okay."

"Haha, that's more like it..."

"All karma, our fortunes and misfortunes are intertwined."

Ice Cube suddenly said, with great solemnity.

Like the day she said she wanted to come to the southern frontier to pick up stars.

Li Mo examined her flawless jade face but couldn't see what she had been thinking just now. However, the gentle light in her eyes carried a firm resolve, as if it wouldn't waver even after countless ages.

It's so hot.

Does the Jade Phoenix God also function as a little sun?

Little Li suddenly felt a bit unable to meet her gaze. He cleared his throat and said:

"Then let's put the Jade Phoenix God away quickly."

"Mm, let go of your spirit, it'll be faster that way."

The mysterious feather pattern between Ying Bing's brows glowed slightly, and the aura of her will and soul filled the entire space. The little figure in Li Mo's Dantian did the same, but the one with an even greater reaction was the Stone Monkey Divine Mark.

The Stone Monkey Divine Mark contained many divine abilities and seemed to have formed some kind of connection with the Jade Phoenix God.

It was related to the Seventy-Two Transformations.

The true spirits he had collected along the way seemed to come alive one by one, swimming within his Dantian. The memories within their true spirits surfaced in his heart.

Suddenly.

One of his old friends was guided out by the Jade Phoenix God.

The Rift Sea Dragon Whale.

The semi-transparent dragon whale, the power of its bloodline connected like stars within it, revealed its origin without reservation.

It let out an ancient cry, as if from the depths of the sea.

Then it charged into the Stone Monkey Divine Mark, becoming one of the Seventy-Two Transformations.

"It seems the Seventy-Tee Transformations will be perfected soon."

Li Mo felt a sense of swelling in his will and soul, a satisfied smile in his heart.

He decided to take a break and also try out this newly acquired Rift Sea Dragon Whale Transformation.

So Li Mo took out a drop of Rift Sea Dragon Whale essence blood and swallowed it.

Seventy-Two Transformations! Activate!!

---

He felt an additional primordial force within his body, almost equivalent to the first time he used the power of the world.

To put it simply, he felt like he had gained a lot of muscle.

Li Mo looked at himself and found that he had suddenly become much more burly. If his previous figure was like a leopard, now he was as strong as a bear.

Some black patterns also appeared on his arms, within which power surged.

He looked in the mirror.

"Wow, I look so fierce now."

"My temperament is quite suitable for using a hammer... Huh? Why am I thinking about this?"

Dragon Whale Li Mo touched the horns on his head, finding that his head seemed to have gotten heavier, and his thoughts were a bit sluggish.

The Dragon Whale Transformation shouldn't be used too much.

Using this thing too much might not be good for the brain...

Oh right.

Where's Ice Cube?

Li Mo turned his head to look.

The Jade Phoenix God ultimately had to be kept with her for safekeeping. Her gains from it must be quite good.

Little Li initially wanted to see Ice Cube's progress, but as soon as his gaze shifted over, he forgot his original intention.

As is well known, the feathers of avian races become clothes after they transform.

The girl's dress had turned into a gradient blue and metallic color, the same luster as the ends of her hair, and her figure had also become a bit more slender.

Her profile was still captivatingly fair, but her eyes were like emerald waves, with a stunning and enchanting ripple in them.

She used to be cold and distant, but now she was breathtakingly stunning.

It was as if she had instantly transformed from a cold, aloof girl into a stunning, cool beauty.

Mmm.

The feeling of meeting her gaze before was one of indifference, as if she might give you a sword at any moment.

Now it feels like being looked down upon as trash?

"...Can you stop looking at me first?"

"Huh?"

"I feel like I'm being cursed at with your eyes."

Li Mo's mind was already empty, and now it was almost completely stalled.

Ying Bing raised her delicate eyebrow and tilted her head.

Cursed at with eyes?

Do King Peacocks have such an ability?

"But you've been looking at me."

"My eyes have a mind of their own, you know that. And besides..."

Li Mo found the Dragon Whale Transformation quite inconvenient. He had just wanted to change back but found it wasn't working so well.

He really hadn't expected it to be because of his lack of concentration.

"Hmph."

Ying Bing's expressionless jade face suddenly curled into a smile.

She narrowed her eyes and stepped on the top of his foot with her bare foot, grinding it back and forth.

After doing this, she herself was a bit stunned.

This didn't seem like something she would do...

"And now?"

"Ouch..."

Drip—

A drop of crimson red fell onto her warm, jade-like foot, like a shattered red crystal.

To put it this way.

The speculation of the demons outside was, to some extent, correct.

If this isn't called drawing blood, then what is?

...

"Why hasn't the winner been decided after so long?"

"Could they have both been badly injured? That won't do."

"I think we really need to go in and check. What if something happens?"

"Master Huai Kong? Master Huai Kong?"

The great demon kings and powerful demons were very anxious.

If they were indeed both badly injured, it wasn't something any demon wanted to see.

"Go where?" Master Huai Kong's eyes were confused.

The troublesome thing was.

The Master had a bad memory.
