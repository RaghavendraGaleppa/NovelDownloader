# Chapter 82: The Herb Garden (Third Update Seeking Monthly Tickets)

It took Zhou Qing nearly ten days to complete the setup of the Spirit Gathering Array. For this, he even placed the Red Python's inner core at the array's focal point. 

The inner core had the effect of gathering spiritual energy and absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Placing it at the array's focal point could enhance the Spirit Gathering Array's effectiveness. In fact, Qing Lingzi had mentioned that using spirit stones to activate the array would yield the best results. Spiritual energy was a combination of spiritual qi and various other energies from heaven and earth.

Spirit stones contained large amounts of spiritual energy and could be used to activate formations, enhance their power, assist in daily cultivation, and more—they had a wide range of uses.

However, spirit stones were extremely precious. Qing Lingzi himself had only obtained five incredibly valuable low-grade spirit stones from an ancient cave dwelling.

Moreover, spirit stones had different attributes. Using a spirit stone that matched one's cultivation technique would yield better results in cultivation.

From Qing Lingzi's tone, it was clear he deeply missed spirit stones, as if they were some kind of rare delicacy.

However, Zhou Qing felt Qing Lingzi was exaggerating. If spirit stones were truly that powerful, how could Qing Lingzi have only reached the fourth level of Qi Refinement?

But people are like this—things they enjoyed in their youth leave lasting impressions, hard to forget, and often embellished by memory.

Without an inner core or spirit stone at the focal point, the Spirit Gathering Array's effectiveness would be greatly diminished, but it would still be more powerful than ordinary feng shui arrays. Living in such an environment for a long time would naturally promote good health and reduce the likelihood of illness.

Zhou Qing suspected that some of this world's feng shui arrays might actually be simplified versions of the Spirit Gathering Array. He had read some feng shui books and noticed similarities in principles, though the Spirit Gathering Array was far more profound.

Using an inner core in the array was still not as effective as using a spirit stone, but it had its benefits—it could refine the inner core to some extent by gathering spiritual energy, purging it of baleful and demonic qi.

Such an inner core would be of better quality for alchemy and slightly increase the success rate of pill refinement.

However, Qing Lingzi did not have any pill recipes that used inner cores. He did have recipes for Qi Condensation Pills and Marrow Cleansing Pills, but his alchemy skills were mediocre.

Once, he had spent a great deal of effort attempting to refine a batch of Marrow Cleansing Pills, only to fail, which left him deeply upset for a long time.

In truth, the jade Zhou Qing obtained was more like Qing Lingzi's diary.

The recording method was primarily based on spiritual sense, allowing it to contain vast amounts of information.

Zhou Qing inspected the Spirit Gathering Array once more before channeling his True Qi into it. Cultivators referred to True Qi as "magic power," but Qing Lingzi mentioned that after Zhou Qing's body reached the Xiantian realm, his magic power underwent subtle changes, so True Qi and magic power were still slightly different.

These changes were clearly for the better.

Overall, Zhou Qing's True Qi was more robust and durable than the magic power Qing Lingzi initially cultivated using Qi Condensation Pills and Marrow Cleansing Pills.

Before long, Zhou Qing sat down exhausted against the great mulberry tree. Activating the Spirit Gathering Array had completely drained his True Qi.

However, his body's Qi and blood soon replenished the expended energy through the process of refining essence into qi. This, in turn, caused a slight depletion in his spiritual sense.

The Evergreen Immortality Technique also mentioned that True Qi was closely related to Qi, blood, and spirit. This was why the incomplete Evergreen Immortality Technique could be divided into the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon and the Taiyue True Form Talisman Canon, two major martial cultivation techniques focused on Qi and blood.

But True Qi was primarily rooted in the "qi" among the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit—the "qi" refined from essence.

As the Spirit Gathering Array slowly activated, Zhou Qing released his spiritual sense to carefully observe the changes in the surrounding spiritual energy. The array mainly encompassed the courtyard, including the trunk of the great mulberry tree.

After several hours, Zhou Qing sensed that the surrounding spiritual energy had stopped increasing, reaching a threshold. He continued observing for a day and found that the increase in spiritual energy was unstable, fluctuating over time. The spiritual energy also felt different during different periods—sometimes lively, sometimes dormant, sometimes turbulent—sensations he had never experienced before.

Overall, the spiritual energy around midnight was the most beneficial for his cultivation.

He later replaced the inner core with the demon crane's and reactivated the array, finding that the spiritual energy became slightly more turbulent, but this was manageable with a few recitations of the Heart-Cleansing Mantra.

"It seems there's no significant difference in quality between the blood python's and demon crane's inner cores when used in the Spirit Gathering Array. Or perhaps this is simply how inner cores function in the array?"

However, the disparity in strength among demon beasts of the same level was more about their innate talents.

The demon crane's talent was clearly far superior to the blood python's.

Now, the spiritual energy in the courtyard was about three times denser than before. But since the original spiritual energy in the courtyard had been extremely sparse, the improvement was still limited.

"Since I don't have any pill recipes for the inner cores, and the demon crane's inner core is just sitting idle, I might as well set up another Spirit Gathering Array at Qingfu Temple. As for the turbulent spiritual energy caused by the demon crane's inner core, the Heart-Cleansing Mantra can mitigate it."

Zhou Qing now noticed that Qingfu Temple also had traces of spiritual energy, though far weaker than in his courtyard.

Clearly, there was an indescribable change occurring in the world.

But this change would undoubtedly take a long time—likely on the scale of centuries.

After completing the Spirit Gathering Array, Zhou Qing transplanted the Vermilion Fruit back to his courtyard. Zhishan and the others could return as well, but Fushan seemed reluctant to leave the cave.

It took Zhishan considerable effort to persuade him to leave.

Zhou Qing understood why—Qing Lingzi's cave also had a Spirit Gathering Array, though it lacked spirit stones or inner cores to activate it.

After transplanting the Vermilion Fruit back to the courtyard, Zhou Qing noticed its ripening process had accelerated significantly.

He had previously observed the Vermilion Fruit while staying in Qing Lingzi's cave. After transplantation, the fruit tree showed no signs of distress; instead, it thrived.

Zhou Qing then planted other rare herbs in the courtyard, and they too grew noticeably better.

Later, when he set up a Spirit Gathering Array at Qingfu Temple, the effect was far less pronounced.

Zhou Qing suspected this was related to the great mulberry tree.

After setting up the array, he often sensed a soothing emotion emanating from the tree, as if it had grown closer to him. Moreover, absorbing the tree's yin energy now yielded slightly better cultivation results than before.

Overall, Zhou Qing was quite satisfied with the Spirit Gathering Array's effects.

He thus transformed the courtyard into a herb garden, building living quarters and an alchemy room comparable to Qingfu Temple's beside it.

The Zhou residence was divided into outer and inner quarters. The inner quarters housed the herb garden, while the outer quarters were for receiving guests.

In truth, visitors were rare. Zhou Qing had instructed that if anyone from Zhou Village or his old acquaintances from the slums sought help, Hu the Butcher could handle it as he saw fit—as long as it didn't violate moral principles.

The Vermilion Fruit was expected to ripen by the end of the year.

Zhou Qing planned to refine it into pills and began making preparations, such as gathering pill recipes.

...

"Senior Brother, I've awakened you this time to discuss the Qi Condensation Pill."

Zhou Qing first roused Fusong, then together they awakened Fushan. This time, he wanted to discuss the Qi Condensation Pill with Fushan.

The pill required an eight-leaf ginseng, which Zhou Qing certainly didn't have. But modifying recipes was common. Zhou Qing had a spiritually potent snow ginseng from the Shang family's storeroom and a thousand-year-old fleeceflower root.

The fleeceflower root had side effects but could still be used in alchemy.

Zhou Qing and Fushan quickly exchanged ideas through spiritual sense, deliberating and refining the Qi Condensation Pill recipe.

Both were masters of medicine, and Fushan's alchemy skills were also profound. Zhou Qing's alchemy skills were at the beginner level (entry-level), making him a master in the eyes of ordinary people but merely a novice on the path of immortality.

Fushan became so engrossed in the discussion that he risked extending his清醒时间，他疯病的根源实际上是炼神不足，需要通过发疯的状态来减少精神损耗。

在福山和周清的讨论下，他们决定用雪参代替八品叶人参的效果，并做了许多删减。凝气丹的配方大幅简化，效果也会降低很多，但应该能够炼制出来。

新的删减配方还需要用普通的珍贵药材替代，进行药性试验探索，但大体思路已经被福山和周清确定下来。

周清花了一个多月时间，终于将减配的凝气废丹炼制出来。

虽然是废丹，但对气血武修颇有效果，只是对先天高手无用，只能当作辟谷丹服用，或者补充气血损耗。

"凝气不行，凝血足够。"周清干脆将凝气废丹改名为凝血丹，先给元明月、林小姐、胡屠户她们服用。等以后这些珍贵药材收集得足够多，再给清福宫的弟子们。

至于知善，周清打算等凝气丹的减配版——也就是次品凝气丹炼制成功后，让他试试效果，看能否增加知善的积累，让他有望达到福松突破先天前的层次。

知善为人忠厚老实，周清还是希望他能突破先天的。但他的资质确实比福松差很多，年纪又大了，突破先天的希望其实同样渺茫。

但他长期和福山、福松在一起，这本身就是一种机缘。因为无形中，知善的体质受到福山、福松练功时雷音的影响，潜移默化地得到了改善。这是一个长期的过程，而且是无意中获得的
