# Chapter 282: Minor Success in Marrow Cleansing

The young Taoist suddenly began to cough. It turned out he was choked by the vapor rising from the medicinal barrel—the Xuanwu Marrow Cleansing Soup. Floating within the soup were fragments of turtle shells, each radiating the imposing aura of a formidable beast.

Demon and monster flesh and blood!

All of them were precious treasures!

Xu Yunfan finally understood why so many people yearned to join the six great sects, even willing to become outer disciples.

Just look at this—if these things were exchanged at the Tiangong Cave, they would likely be used up in just one or two sessions, bankrupting anyone.

Qing Song covered his mouth and nose with his sleeve, afraid that his coughing was unseemly. He smiled and said, "Brother Xu, please don't mind. As the second-ranked direct disciple under the sect master, this is all we could hastily prepare for now. In a few days, there will be more tonics specifically tailored to the martial arts you practice."

Xu Yunfan could no longer move away. After Qing Song delivered the medicine chest and barrel into the courtyard, two women in green gauze gracefully emerged from the corridor.

The woman on the left was tall and slender, her skin as fair as snow. Her almond-shaped eyes held a hint of spring, and her lips were as red as cinnabar. Beneath her misty light robe, her slender waist was faintly visible, no thicker than a handful. Her steps were as delicate as a willow swaying in the wind, yet concealed within was the circulation of formidable strength—clearly a martial artist.

Her martial realm was not shallow; at the very least, she had achieved great success in muscle and tendon refinement. It was just unclear what kind of martial art she practiced, as it didn't allow her physique to reveal any visible muscles.

The woman on the right had a voluptuous figure, with cloud-like hair adorned with a slanted hairpin. Her phoenix eyes shimmered with a smile, and beneath her light gauze, her ample bosom was half-concealed. Golden bells on her wrists chimed with every movement, accentuating her jade-white arms as smooth as lotus roots, and her fingertips as lustrous as carved jade.

Both women possessed beauty that could topple cities, yet their temperaments were distinct—one cool and aloof, the other charming and enchanting. Standing on either side, they complemented each other like cold plum blossoms against peonies.

"Who are these..."

"These two senior sisters have come specifically to assist Brother Xu with the supplementary medicine," Qing Song explained.

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly and was about to decline when Qing Song smiled and said, "Brother Xu, please don't refuse. These two, Qingluan and Chishao, specialize in medicinal baths for direct disciples and are well-versed in meridians and acupoints. Without their help, the Xuanwu Marrow Cleansing Soup would likely waste over half of its potency."

He then blinked. "Rest assured, Brother, their 'Nine Revolutions Palpating Hand' can ensure that most of the medicinal power is perfectly absorbed into your body."

The disciple recently accepted by the sect master had directly entered the second rank, only half a step behind the top-ranked direct disciple.

But in terms of true importance, there was no doubt that the young and exceptionally powerful Xu Yunfan was more significant.

Qing Song had never seen Bi Yuan act so humble and respectful to a talent, even allowing one person to have two masters.

This was something unprecedented in the Dao Sect.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the turtle shell fragments in the medicinal soup, which were pulsing with blood energy. He knew this item was potent and finally nodded in silent agreement.

The two women stepped forward gracefully. With a slight lift of their fair hands, their sleeves exuded a faint fragrance. One took a jade ladle to stir the medicinal soup, while the other spoke softly, "Brother Xu, please remove your outer robe. Once you enter the barrel, you must guide the medicinal power through your limbs and bones using your Qi..."

Before she could finish, Xu Yunfan's expression turned slightly unnatural, but he saw that Qing Song had already tactfully retreated outside the courtyard, closing the vermilion-painted gate behind him.

Three hours later, steam enveloped Xu Yunfan's entire body. The Xuanwu Marrow Cleansing Soup had changed from crimson to clear, and the turtle shell fragments at the bottom had all turned into grayish-white powder.

His eyes snapped open, golden light flashing like lightning within them. His spine crackled segment by segment like a dragon's roar. From all his pores, a faint golden blood energy mixed with dark purple impurities erupted—this was the sign that the "Muscle and Marrow Refining Scripture" had reached minor success.

He glanced at the dozens of notification messages appearing on his attribute panel. Just this session of Xuanwu Marrow Cleansing Soup had granted him over a hundred points of proficiency in the Muscle and Marrow Refining Scripture within these three hours.

'Your pores dilated, absorbing the blood energy and medicinal power from the Xuanwu Marrow Cleansing Soup. Under the operation of the Muscle and Marrow Refining Scripture, your proficiency has greatly increased.'

'...'

The proficiency prompts flooded the screen. In just three hours, the Muscle and Marrow Refining Scripture had entered the minor success realm.

Jade-like patterns faintly appeared beneath his skin, and his bones emitted sounds like striking metal and jade when they collided.

All the accumulated flaws from previously practicing the "Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique" were completely repaired. His muscle fibers twisted and reorganized like ropes forged from refined steel; with just a slight clench of his fist, cracks spread across the medicinal barrel.

In his marrow sea, mercury-like golden marrow surged ceaselessly. The originally scattered Red Serpent Mountain-Splitting Force had spontaneously condensed into nine spiral Qi currents, cycling along the spine's great dragon to every part of his body, forming a grand circulation.

With a slight exertion of force, three inches of solid red light burst from his fingertips. Wherever the Qi current passed, even the air was scorched with traces.

This was the unique "external manifestation of force" at the Marrow Cleansing realm. If he advanced further, condensing the Qi to its extreme and forming a Qi Shield, even a thread of it could easily pierce through metal and stone.

Most astonishing was the location of the spine's great dragon. The originally obscure nodes where force flowed were blasted open by the violent medicinal power, and golden marrow like molten rock poured into his entire skeleton.

This was also the sign that the Muscle and Marrow Refining Scripture had reached minor success: the golden marrow derived from the spine's great dragon began to seep into the entire skeleton. In the following time, he only needed to slowly temper himself, and step by step, he could transform his entire body's marrow force. By then, his strength would rise to another level.

Xu Yunfan stepped up from the fragments scattered on the ground, leaving inch-deep footprints on the bluestone slabs with each step.

Qingluan and Chishao watched Xu Yunfan's completely naked body with dazzling eyes, staring intently without any intention of looking away.

Xu Yunfan instantly noticed. He had intended to test his strength, but his movements paused slightly. With a single hand gesture, the Dragon Scale Armor not far away flew toward him like countless leaves clinging to his body.

Those dark golden scale leaves trembled and hummed like living creatures, each gleaming with a metallic cold light and edges as sharp as blades. They spun in the air, clashing with crisp sounds of metal striking metal, and in the blink of an eye, they gathered from a scattered state into a streamlined armor outline.

The scales first covered his arms, layering like snake scales, with the elbow joints automatically forming gill-like retractable structures. Then they spread along his shoulders and neck to his torso. The core plates on his chest and abdomen faintly revealed the blood patterns of the Red Serpent Mountain-Splitting Force, resonating with the golden marrow mercury in Xu Yunfan's body after marrow cleansing.

The scales below his waist poured down like a waterfall. When the last scale clasped his throat, the entire armor suddenly contracted, outlining Xu Yunfan's muscle lines sharply and distinctly.

Faint red light seeped from the gaps between the scales. At this moment, this Dragon Scale Armor was no longer just a defensive tool; it was more like a second layer of bones and muscles growing from his skin. Even when breathing, one could see the scales slightly undulating like a dragon's belly.

After fastening the steel case containing the Ginseng Spirit and strapping the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel to his back, Xu Yunfan cupped his fists and said, "Thank you for your assistance, Senior Sisters. If you hadn't helped me circulate my blood and guided me on how to take the medicine, I would have wasted much of the medicinal power."

Qingluan and Chishao covered their mouths and giggled. Chishao said, "Brother Xu has quite the capital..."

She then added with a seductive gaze, "Brother, our sisters are well-versed in the Daoist bedroom arts. If you're interested in studying them, we can lend you a hand."

Hearing this, Qingluan's neck unconsciously turned a shade of tender pink.
