# Chapter 356: An Old Friend Arrives

Xu Yunfan frowned and reversed his palm, his palm acting like a gaping maw of a Taotie to drag the fleeing True Qi back into his body. A series of violent light marks immediately swam beneath his skin.

"He's quite greedy..."

He couldn't help but twitch his mouth.

His internal organs felt as if they had been stuffed into a thousand-jun heavy furnace. The Penglai Weak Water True Qi and the Buddhist Pure Fire were clashing within his flesh and blood, shaking his ribs until they trembled slightly.

Those foreign True Qi essences that had not been completely refined were using his body as a battlefield to attack each other, causing even the Ten Extremities Martial Dao Mixed Origin True Seed to temporarily stagnate its operation.

But even so, the Ten Extremities True Qi still acted like the sea accepting all rivers. With every major cycle, it assimilated a layer of the foreign True Qi within his body. At the same time, he spat out useless turbid qi, leaving only pure and refined True Qi to be incorporated into the Ten Extremities True Qi circulation system.

The system notifications on his vision were refreshing at a screen-filling speed, indicating that the total amount of his Ten Extremities True Qi was continuously increasing.

*‘You continuously refine foreign True Qi, assimilating it into your own use with the momentum of the sea accepting all rivers. The total amount of your Ten Extremities True Qi has increased.’*

*‘You...’*

Xu Yunfan suddenly raised his head, his gaze shooting like a sharp arrow toward the depths of the Great Zhou Imperial Court.

The vermilion palace walls glowed with a blood-like light under the setting sun. There, a more magnificent Xuanhuang Qi was surging, like a dragon bound by chains silently roaring at him.

Tomorrow, tomorrow he would enter the Great Zhou Imperial Court for the final martial arts examination. According to past conventions, the Empress Dowager would personally test the recruits.

At that time...

Although he really wanted to charge in right now to take a look, the foreign True Qi in his body needed to be refined in time. In the Luotian Dajiao ceremony set by the Dao Sect, the necessary steps had to be taken one by one to completely drain the Xuanhuang Qi of the Great Zhou Dragon Vein.

Xu Yunfan was about to turn and leave when he suddenly heard a tearing sound piercing through the twilight.

His brows raised slightly, but his feet did not move an inch. He allowed the figure to land three zhang away on the bluestone slabs, carried by a gust of wind. As the shattered stones flew, the visitor's black Daoist robe fluttered loudly. A bronze Daoist tally hanging at his waist glowed with a copper luster under the setting sun.

It was Li Haomiao. At this moment, his expression was extremely complex as he looked at Xu Yunfan before him.

Looking back to the past, the other party was merely a servant in a mine. Now, just a few years later, he had become a peerless expert who could slaughter ninth-realm experts as easily as killing chickens.

"Why didn't you leave the city with Master Bi to avoid danger?"

Xu Yunfan's fingertips rubbed the handle of the撼岳镇海锤 (Mountain Shaking Sea Suppressing Hammer) at his waist, a bit surprised.

He looked at this close friend who was supposed to have retreated with the Dao Sect. Li Haomiao's usually gentle and jade-like face was now pale as paper, and a difficult-to-describe complex emotion churned in the depths of his eyes.

Li Haomiao did not answer immediately. His gaze swept over the arena. The chest of the Dragon Tiger Sect's elder was caved in like rotten wood, the head of the Celestial Dipper Sword Master from the Sword Sect was shattered like a rotten melon, and there were even several dried corpses maintaining a curled-up posture, their dried eye sockets freezing the despair of having their souls snatched away.

These ninth-realm Grand Masters who could shake the Six Realms with a single stomp on any normal day were now scattered about like insects casually crushed by a child.

"So many of these ninth-realm experts have died. If this gets out..." Li Haomiao's Adam's apple bobbed, his voice hoarse as if he weren't a living person.

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised and retorted, "The sects of the world are like bone-deep maggots, parasites poisoning the common people. Isn't it satisfying that they die? You used to hate these sects so much that you wanted to eat their flesh and drink their blood. Why are you sighing now that I've killed them?"

"... Without experts to suppress the various Dao Prefectures, the Great乾 Iron Cavalry of Yanbei Dao will take the opportunity to raid south. The demonic cultivators of the Xuanming Wasteland will swarm out, and even the Three Immortal Islands overseas will..." He suddenly clenched his fists, his face turning a bit pale. Meeting Xu Yunfan's deep gaze, he spoke up: "Yunfan, from beginning to end, the Great Zhou has had the intention of 'felling mountains and destroying temples,' but do you know why the Six Great Sects have always stood firm? It is precisely because these ninth-realm Qi Refining Grand Masters exist; they are the mainstay for resisting external enemies."

The night wind swept over the two of them, carrying the smell of blood, as if an invisible barrier had risen between them.

It was no wonder Li Haomiao would run back. He didn't care how many of these experts died, nor did he care if the dying, unkillable Empress Dowager deep in the Great Zhou Imperial Court was beaten to death. Once the Great Zhou collapsed, the entire world would be plunged into war in an instant.

At that time, the dead would not just be the thirty-six million common people.

Xu Yunfan suddenly let out a light laugh. The light snakes swimming beneath his skin suddenly shot up, grinding the last wisp of the Maitreya Temple's Pure Fire True Qi into dust and refining it.

"Haomiao..."

He tightened the Empty Sky Piercing Cloud Bow on his shoulder and slowly said, "You risked being intercepted and killed by the Empress Dowager's secret guards to return. Are you worried about those imperial clans imprisoned in the Cold Palace? Or..." Xu Yunfan stepped closer, his voice slightly mocking, his hand resting on Li Haomiao's shoulder, "Are you afraid that when I storm the imperial city tomorrow, I'll casually execute your usurping aunt?"

"It's the people of the entire city!"

Li Haomiao slapped away Xu Yunfan's hand on his shoulder.

Three hundred steps away, in the ruins of a half-collapsed teahouse, a woman with disheveled hair was kneeling on the bluestone slabs.

She was holding a little girl in a apricot-red jacket in her arms. The child's braids were still in the cute double buns style, but her neck was twisted unnaturally.

The woman's dried tear tracks had plowed two white lines through her dust-covered face, and a whimper like a young beast came from her throat.

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment before explaining, "It was the Maitreya Temple's three monks—Kunnan, Kuer, and Kujie—who activated their Vajra True Qi and attacked me. They went all out when they struck. I did my best to block it."

Li Haomiao's face was filled with sorrow.

"The shockwaves from a battle between ninth-realm experts can shatter a normal person's heart meridians from a hundred zhang away! A few months ago, when Dugu Jiu dueled the Empress Dowager above Yujing City, the scattered sword qi directly shaved off half of the commoner district..."

Xu Yunfan remained silent. He had fought nine ninth-realm Qi Refining Grand Masters alone. How could he have had time to worry about the surrounding environment?

"Tomorrow, I will go straight to the core of the imperial city and face that old witch."

Xu Yunfan's fingertips lightly tapped the handle of the Mountain Shaking Sea Suppressing Hammer. The power of the earth's veins resonated with the Ten Extremities True Qi in his body, as if echoing the gradually perfecting Ten Extremities True Qi within him.

Those foreign True Qi essences that were swimming beneath his skin and flesh were now exceptionally docile, taming the Dragon Tiger Gang Qi, Sword Spirit Sharpness, Buddhist Pure Fire, and other foreign True Qi into clear and pure True Qi, extracting the foreign impurities.

He naturally would not easily give up on the final ritual of the Luotian Dajiao.

Li Haomiao naturally understood as well. This was the most critical moment for the Dao Sect, and also the final step for Xu Yunfan to see if he could succeed in supporting it.

He wasn't being overly sentimental; it was just that the journey here had been too tragic, too tragic.

Xu Yunfan suddenly raised his finger and pointed to the northwest. In the twilight, the iron-colored outline of the encampments of the Xuanjia Army could be vaguely seen: "Thirty miles outside Yujing City, three hundred thousand Xuanjia Army troops are holding their ground. The Empress Dowager has issued twelve Tiger Tally orders in a row. This must be your secret mediation at work."
