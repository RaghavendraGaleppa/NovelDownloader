# Chapter 181: The Embryonic Sword Cultivator

Lin Shan took out the elder token given to him by the Nightingale's Grand Elder during his time at the Nightingale headquarters in the Marquis Bowang's residence in Bianliang, the capital of the Great Song Dynasty.

Sword Saint Ma took it and rubbed it thoughtfully for a long time before sighing deeply, as if lost in distant memories, momentarily silent.

Yin Wuming and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord stood nearby, bewildered, sensing something amiss. What kind of bewitching words had this kid fed Sword Saint Ma? And what was so special about that sword manual that it could excite the Sword Saint to such an extent?

"Unexpectedly, today brings double joy—not only obtaining the Evil-Slaying Sword Manual but also meeting a fellow from the same organization," Sword Saint Ma sighed with emotion, his eyes flickering with nostalgia.

He then began chatting with Lin Shan: "Where in the Southern Border are you from?"

Lin Shan: "This junior is from Qinghe County."

Sword Saint Ma: "What a coincidence! I'm from Zangke County, right next door."

Lin Shan: "This junior also joined the Nightingale branch in Zangke County."

Sword Saint Ma: "What a coincidence! I later became the branch leader of Guangnan County, also next door."

Lin Shan: "This Evil-Slaying Sword Manual was found in Zangke County."

Sword Saint Ma sighed regretfully: "What a pity! I wasted ten years searching in vain in Guangnan County, deceived by rumors!"

Lin Shan: "Later, I went to the Nightingale headquarters in Bianliang and became a guest elder by chance."

Sword Saint Ma nodded repeatedly: "I also went to the capital to report and was promoted from branch leader to innate elder."

Suddenly, both fell silent, exchanged glances, and then burst into laughter simultaneously.

"HAHAHA!!!"

The abrupt laughter startled the Black Skeleton Demon Lord and Yin Wuming, who wondered what was wrong with these two and why they were so excitable.

After this exchange, Lin Shan and Sword Saint Ma had no further doubts—such eccentric habits were unmistakably characteristic of Nightingale members.

Once identities were confirmed, the two felt a mutual admiration. Lin Shan promptly took out various ceremonial items from his storage space, presented a formal request, served tea, and performed the rites to become a disciple.

Sword Saint Ma helped him up with both hands, repeatedly saying, "Good, good, good," while warmly offering advice.

"Since you are now my personal disciple, remember this: if you ever encounter an insurmountable enemy while traveling the martial world, you may invoke the name of Sword Saint Ma Yuanjue—it might save your life. Do not forget!"

Lin Shan solemnly nodded, as if engraving these words in his heart.

"Master, rest assured. In the future, wherever I go in the cultivation world, I will surely spread the fame of Sword Saint Ma, ensuring our Sword Saint lineage becomes renowned throughout the land!"

---

Sword Saint Ma nodded repeatedly, feeling he had made the right choice in accepting this disciple. With such ambition, coupled with his talent and comprehension, he might one day catch up to his own level.

Of course, had he known Lin Shan was a troublemaker who stirred chaos wherever he went, he might have refused outright.

But for now, Sword Saint Ma was thoroughly satisfied.

As master and disciple chatted amiably, Yin Wuming and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord felt their hearts grow cold. The former feared for his life, while the latter lamented missing another chance at the innate spiritual treasure.

The other demonic cultivators, seeing someone become a personal disciple and losing hope of escape, grew disheartened and began contemplating other ways to break free.

Meanwhile, the righteous cultivators watching the spectacle were surprised. They hadn't expected Yin Wuming of the Blood River Hall to be passed over, with Lin Shan emerging as the dark horse. They whispered among themselves, discussing the turn of events.

They were at ease, knowing that as long as they didn't provoke the three personalities within the red-robed youth, they could safely wait for reinforcements.

Lin Shan and Sword Saint Ma continued discussing the customs and culture of the Southern Border, fellow countrymen with endless topics to share.

However, when the topic turned to the *Evil-Slaying Sword Manual*, Lin Shan grew concerned—would his new master really castrate himself?

Sword Saint Ma laughed heartily, explaining he was merely curious and intended to learn from it, having no interest in becoming effeminate.

Lin Shan sighed in relief.

But then Sword Saint Ma added that, to his knowledge, the *Evil-Slaying Sword Manual* was merely an abridged version of the *Sunflower Manual*. If he were to practice anything, it would be the complete version.

This shocked Lin Shan!

Did the *Sunflower Manual* truly exist? If the *Evil-Slaying Sword Manual* was already an innate martial art, wouldn't the *Sunflower Manual* be a cultivation sword technique?

Though its level remained unclear—was it a spell or a divine ability?

Sword Saint Ma's gaze grew distant, vowing to scour the ends of the earth to find the complete *Sunflower Manual*, his determination unshakable.

Lin Shan, however, felt a pang of discomfort—why was his master so fixated on something that required self-castration?

---

Dawn broke, painting the horizon with pale light.

The red-robed youth shuddered as Sword Saint Ma receded, and the Martial Instructor took over.

"Heroes emerge with the winds of change; once entering the martial world, time flies—"

The booming voice startled everyone, reminding them of yesterday's fear of forced training. They quickly formed two lines without prompting, assuming stances and beginning their drills.

The Martial Instructor's words died in his throat.

Noticing Lin Shan beside him, he assigned him to lead the group, teaching the essence and techniques of the fist forms.

Envy burned in the others' hearts. Not only had this kid become Sword Saint Ma's personal disciple, but he was also the Martial Instructor's favorite. With two of the three personalities favoring him, who could compete?

But Yin Wuming hadn't given up. As a demonic prodigy, his will was unyielding. Though rejected by Sword Saint Ma, he refused to despair.

With his talent, perhaps he could find another path—winning the Martial Instructor's favor today might yet save him.

Alas, his chance never came.

At that moment, another group of cultivators arrived—this time intentionally.

A vast divine sense swept over everyone in the forest, raising goosebumps as the surrounding spiritual energy seemed to boil. A thunderous voice echoed:

"I am the Zenith Heaven True Lord, head of the Heavenly Silkworm Peak of the Beast Taming Valley. Who dares detain our outer sect elder?"

At this, all looked up.

The righteous cultivators rejoiced. They hadn't expected a Beast Taming Valley Nascent Soul grandmaster to arrive so swiftly. Elder Pei had only been captured yesterday morning, yet help had come today.

Lin Shan, who had been elated last night at the prospect of escaping once Sword Saint Ma subdued the other two personalities, was stunned by the righteous faction's rapid response.

No wonder Elder Pei had been so confident in shielding him from troubles—he had a Nascent Soul expert backing him.

In fact, Zenith Heaven True Lord was Elder Pei's ancestral master. Being nearby, he had rushed over upon hearing the news.

The demonic cultivators paled, turning to the Martial Instructor, wondering if he could withstand a Nascent Soul cultivator.

The Martial Instructor remained calm, his aura swelling to oppose the pressure from above.

Zenith Heaven True Lord had already spotted the group, including Elder Pei and the red-robed youth.

"Lei Yinzi, disregarding the righteous alliance's unity, you dare detain our disciples, disrupting the eastern coastal blockade and allowing demonic remnants to escape! Today, I shall take you captive and let the Purple Mansion Sect's old fogies explain themselves!"

The Purple Mansion Sect elders hadn't publicized Lei Yinzi's possession, leaving even the Beast Taming Valley's Nascent Soul expert in the dark.

A sleeve expanded to envelop the entire group. With their cultivation sealed, they could only watch helplessly.

"As the family-appointed instructor, how can I allow you to harm our juniors?"

The Martial Instructor intercepted the "Sleeve Cosmos" technique and soared into the sky, clashing with Zenith Heaven True Lord.

The battle raged fiercely, stirring the spiritual sea and summoning swarms of insects. Fist shadows crisscrossed the sky, the shockwaves bending the forest below.

Insect corpses rained down, but Zenith Heaven True Lord paid them no heed.

After fifteen minutes, the battle ended with Zenith Heaven True Lord retreating, injured.

The Martial Instructor descended, robes tattered, vomiting blood. The battle had been a draw, exhausting him into slumber.

Scholar Cen took over.

"Hard work is the path to the mountain of knowledge; diligence the boat to the sea of learning."

The crowd, recalling yesterday's torment, immediately sat cross-legged, feigning attentiveness.

Yin Wuming, desperate after seeing the Nascent Soul expert's arrival, tried to ingratiate himself with Scholar Cen. Though he had abandoned scholarly pursuits in his youth, his upbringing in the literary Lu Kingdom allowed him to quote classics, earning Scholar Cen's approval.

Just as Yin Wuming thought he might secure survival, another group of righteous cultivators arrived at noon.

"I am Flowing Cloud True Lord, head of Mangdang Mountain of the Dry Cloud Pavilion. Which fellow Daoist obstructs our righteous alliance's disciples?"

Another Nascent Soul expert!

The righteous cultivators cheered, while the demonic ones anxiously watched Scholar Cen.

Without a word, Scholar Cen rose to protect his "students."

Another battle ensued, ending fifteen minutes later with Flowing Cloud True Lord retreating, injured. Scholar Cen returned, coughing blood, forcing Sword Saint Ma to reemerge.

"Heaven births none like Ma Yuanjue; the path of swords remains dark for eternity!"

No one bothered to flatter him now—they knew his disciple slot was taken.

Yin Wuming despaired. He had tried everything, but the righteous reinforcements kept coming.

Sword Saint Ma sat quietly, seizing the moment to suppress the other personalities and free himself.

---

At midnight, three streaks of fire approached, followed by numerous beams of light.

This time, three Nascent Soul elders arrived—the same Purple Mansion Sect trio who had fought the Guardian Dharma King days earlier.

The righteous cultivators cheered—victory was assured!

The demonic ones hung their heads, resigned to fate.

Sword Saint Ma opened his eyes and sighed, murmuring to himself.

"Stubborn fools... even now, you won't let me leave, insisting on protecting family juniors and students. Very well, since I promised..."

Drawing a crimson sword, his gaze turned steely. Sword intent coalesced around him, metallic clangs resonating as if a dragon stirred within.

The Purple Mansion elders attacked in unison, unleashing a celestial river meant to purge all evil.

Under the cold moonlight, Sword Saint Ma recalled his past—singing and swordplay in the Southern Marsh, sailing through Wu Gorge, galloping on western trails, braving northern blizzards.

"Who first saw the moon by the river? When did the moon first shine upon man?"

A deep sword hum grew louder, echoing through the forest like a war anthem.

At that moment, his slender figure seemed to tower, embodying the unyielding spirit of a swordsman.

A hero upholds justice, defends the weak, and roams the world with sword in hand.

A razor-sharp sword intent erupted, drawing upon the world's spiritual currents, its will erupting like a volcano.

When a martial hero wields immortal power, what brilliance might emerge from the fusion of "immortal" and "hero," "strength" and "will"?

As the heavenly river descended, he merged with his sword, charging upward like a moth to flame. A deafening explosion followed, a red-blue shockwave rippling across the sky.

For an instant, the brilliance was blinding.

The onlookers stared, inexplicably sorrowful, only to realize their sealed cultivation had been restored the moment the sword light had soared.
