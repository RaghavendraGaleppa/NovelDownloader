# Chapter 41: Immortal Master Nan  

After roughly a quarter of an hour, Protector Jiang returned, drenched in blood, announcing that the path ahead had been cleared.  

Lin Shan stood up, his spiritual energy nearly fully recovered, and followed Protector Jiang into the depths of the dense forest.  

The red-clad warriors of the Bladesworn Sect waiting ahead had suffered over half their casualties. Fortunately, Protector Jiang had joined the battle later, or else Young Sect Master Ren Wukuang might never have had another chance to be as reckless as his name suggested.  

The group advanced several more miles, encountering numerous skirmishes along the way. Battlefields appeared every few hundred steps, indicating that either the various sects and factions had scattered or had left behind forces to stall each other while their leaders and elites pushed toward the island’s center. The latter seemed more likely.  

At one point, they even stumbled upon two separate clashes where teams of assassins from the Nightingale Organization were locked in fierce combat with river pirates. The Nightingale Organization had branches throughout the Great Song Dynasty, so encountering them here was no surprise. As professional assassins, ambushes and counter-ambushes were routine.  

Without hesitation, Protector Jiang took command of the Nightingale operatives, flashing his Protector’s token and displaying his Xiantian-level strength. The assassins naturally fell in line.  

Upon questioning, they learned these assassins were from the Nightingale’s Jiangling County branch, led by a Xiantian expert who had already infiltrated further ahead to vie for the Innate Vermilion Fruit in the final melee.  

Hearing that experts from all factions had already gathered at the island’s center, Lin Shan and Protector Jiang wasted no time and rushed deeper into the island at full speed.  

As for the Bladesworn Sect’s red-clad warriors? They were unceremoniously abandoned. With a hundred professional black-clad assassins now under his command, Protector Jiang had little use for the battered remnants of the sect. His own organization’s men were far more reliable.  

Left behind, Ren Wukuang and his subordinates huddled together like frightened chicks, trembling in place.  

---  

After a frantic dash, the dense forest abruptly opened up. Pushing through the undergrowth, the group beheld a chilling sight.  

Ahead lay a frosty pool spanning a hundred meters, with a small island at its center. A lone plant swayed gently on the island, unmistakably the home of the Innate Vermilion Fruit.  

Yet, bizarrely, not a single person attempted to cross the pool to claim it.  

Around the pool, nearly a thousand warriors clashed in chaotic combat. The battlefield was a riot of colors—red, white, black, blue, purple—dazzling Lin Shan and his companions. Almost half of Jingxiang’s major martial factions had gathered here, with more streaming in from the forest behind them.  

The cacophony of battle—shouts, screams, and the clashing of steel—filled the air, making Lin Shan’s head spin.  

The largest battle raged directly ahead.  

In the center of the clearing stood a middle-aged man and a young girl, seemingly siblings. Surrounding them were over twenty Xiantian experts, directing waves of fighters to attack the pair while they themselves struck opportunistically, retreating swiftly after each failed attempt, as though fearing dire consequences if they lingered too long.  

Judging by their attire and cultivation, these were either sect leaders, elders, or patriarchs of prominent families. A few even unleashed sword beams and palm strikes that extended over a foot in length—signs of Xiantian Great Perfection, the pinnacle of mortal martial prowess.  

These were figures on par with the Nightingale’s Grand Elders, legendary beings rarely seen in the martial world. Yet here they were, several of them at once.  

The siblings they besieged were even more astonishing.  

The elder brother, clad in a yellow robe, wielded a golden spear with overwhelming ferocity. Every strike left his opponents dead or grievously wounded, and the ground around him was littered with corpses.  

The younger sister, dressed in a light blue dress, appeared delicate and refined. Most striking was her ability to conjure fireballs with a flick of her wrist. Anyone struck by them was instantly incinerated, their bodies melting away with terrifying ease.  

"Cultivators!"  

Lin Shan and Protector Jiang exchanged grim looks. While Protector Jiang was awed by the girl’s fireballs, Lin Shan—now possessing divine sense—could freely perceive the fluctuations of spiritual energy.  

If his senses weren’t mistaken, the golden spear in the yellow-robed man’s hands was forged from condensed metal-elemental energy. Moreover, the man’s spiritual power was slightly stronger than his own.  

"Mid-stage Qi Refining, metal-attribute cultivator," Lin Shan concluded instantly.  

As for the girl, she was a fire-attribute cultivator at the early stage of Qi Refining, roughly on par with him.  

No wonder over twenty Xiantian experts had joined forces to besiege the siblings. They feared that infighting would leave them unable to resist the two cultivators, hence their united front to eliminate them first.  

---  

"Immortal Master Nan!" bellowed a middle-aged man in a constable’s uniform and black gauze hat. "As a guest elder of the Chu Prince’s estate, we hesitate to press you further. Withdraw now, leave the island, and we will not pursue you!"  

A Nightingale lieutenant whispered to Lin Shan and Protector Jiang, "That’s Zhang Yi, Chief Constable of Jingxiang’s nine counties—a Xiantian Great Perfection expert."  

From the battlefield’s center, the yellow-robed man scoffed while swinging his spear, "Constable Zhang, I’ll call you that when I’m in a good mood. When I’m not, what are you to me?"  

"This Vermilion Fruit is mine! Anyone who dares take it will die!"  

His words fell on deaf ears. Men would die for wealth, as birds would for food. The Innate Vermilion Fruit emerged only once a century, and its appearance always heralded bloodshed.  

These warriors had spent their lives striving for supremacy, defying fate itself. Having reached the Xiantian realm, they knew all too well that advancing beyond Great Perfection was nearly impossible. Thus, they pinned their hopes on rare spiritual treasures—even if it meant facing immortal masters.  

After all, several among them were Xiantian Great Perfection experts, their strength comparable to the third layer of Qi Refining. Well-versed in the ways of the world, they knew cultivators were not invincible. United, they could hold their own against early or mid-stage Qi Refining adepts.  

"Immortal Master Nan!" An elderly man with white hair and beard spoke up, his palm strikes vast and profound, forcing the blue-robed girl to frantically block with her fireballs. She seemed exhausted, her face pale. "Last year at the Chu Prince’s estate, I had the honor of meeting you and your sister. This fruit is our only hope to transcend the Xiantian realm. It holds little value to cultivators like you—why must you insist?"  

The Nightingale lieutenant identified him as the ancestral elder of the Hong Clan, a century-old family from Lingling County. A Xiantian Great Perfection expert who had vanished from the world forty years prior after achieving fame.  

Lin Shan and Protector Jiang nodded, keeping their assassins hidden in the forest, observing covertly. They were well-versed in the art of discretion.  

As the battle raged, the Xiantian experts continued their attempts at persuasion, valuing their lives too much to fight to the death if words could suffice.  

Finally, the yellow-robed Immortal Master Nan lost his patience and roared:  

"What do you mortals know? The Innate Vermilion Fruit is a key ingredient for refining Qi Refining pills! For you to consume it would be a waste of heaven’s gifts!"  

Instead of dissuading them, his words only fueled the martial artists’ frenzy.  

If even cultivators coveted the fruit, how much more valuable must it be to them?
