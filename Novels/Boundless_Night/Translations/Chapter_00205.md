**Chapter 205: Refining Demon Seeds into Resources**

The silver-haired demon youth, who had been extremely arrogant and cold-eyed not long ago, now had his body split into two halves, falling to either side, even though he had managed to flee.

“Ah…” His divine soul let out a painful shriek. His severed mouth even gaped slightly, but no sound escaped.

Not long ago, he had bisected Su Junlin with his gleaming long saber. He never imagined that it would now be his turn to experience such agony and despair.

His blood-soaked silver hair was matted. His two halves of a body, each with a half-face and a single eye, were filled with terror. He gasped a few times before perishing.

“Serves him right!” From behind, Gan Jincheng shouted excitedly.

His eyes were slightly red-rimmed. He and Su Junlin were friends, yet he could only watch helplessly as the latter died, completely powerless to stop it.

After Qin Ming’s strike, it didn't just slay the physical body; the saber light, like a scorching sun, also severed the divine soul. The silver-haired youth had no chance of survival.

“So fast… he just cut him down…” Xiao Yaqin felt as if in a dream. Their five teams had confronted four demon youths here, resulting in deaths and injuries, and eventually, they were completely routed.

That battle earlier was exceptionally brutal. She still felt lingering fear.

She finally understood why Xin Youdao had so earnestly recommended this person to join their team. Such skill was more than enough to protect them.

On the opposite side, the atmosphere was completely different.

The three demon youths, all tall in stature, now wore incredibly grim expressions. Their companion had been cleanly and decisively cleaved apart by someone.

“Fourth Brother!” they roared.

The shocking bloodstains on the ground made their faces turn icy cold, revealing murderous intent. Not long ago, they had been slaughtering the teams like cattle and sheep, but in the blink of an eye, their own brother had perished.

“You will all be buried with him!”

The black-haired youth leading them, his eyes so frigid they seemed to turn to ice, stared at the slender figure ahead as if looking at a dead man.

The village was not small. Its streets were paved with bluestone, and on either side stood rows of grey-tiled, brick houses. However, there were no residents here; these were not houses from the real world.

“Brother, why did you steal my kill!” Little Wu complained slightly. He had already spoken up, saying he wanted to attack, but Brother Ming had just charged out directly.

Behind them, Xiao Yaqin, Gan Jincheng, and the others didn’t know what to say. When they had encountered this group of demons, it was so difficult and dangerous, yet these two were competing for a kill?

On the demon side, the three youths no longer uttered threats but responded with actions. With clanging sounds, their armor rattled like dragon scales.

The black-haired youth stepped forward, intending to act personally. He was nearly two meters tall, and his steps made the ground crack. Demonic energy permeated the air, exuding immense pressure.

To his left and right, the golden-haired youth and the grey-haired youth also advanced. The three pressed forward together, murderous intent permeating the air, like three towering demon mountains blocking the way.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! Behind them, the demons standing on the rooftops leaped down. Some had blood-stained shoulders, even pierced by arrows, but none had died.

These demons were all in the Second Realm, elite by all standards. Now, they remained silent, wanting only to slay the people opposite them, having realized that the youth with the five-colored saber was quite dangerous.

“Kill!” The black-haired youth leading them roared, and a group of demons charged forward. They were physically robust, possessing terrifying strength. Some wielded long spears, others held massive axes, and some carried spiked maces, all of them fierce.

“Come on!” Little Wu bellowed, charging forward bare-handed.

Qin Ming, too, was like an arrow released from a bowstring. Five-colored light mist flowed around his body as he instantly stomped the ground, charging forward like a bolt of lightning, unleashing his full power.

“Let’s go together and kill them!” Xin Youdao followed closely.

Liu Hanya, Jiang Ruoli, Xiao Yaqin, and Gan Jincheng did not hesitate, all following suit. Since they had the courage to stay, they wanted to help, having long anticipated a bloody battle.

The black-haired youth gestured, instructing the two demon youths beside him to block Little Wu and Qin Ming respectively, while he himself charged towards their earlier opponents, intending to swiftly kill them all to avoid being disturbed.

At the same time, the demons behind him were roaring, closing in.

Qin Ming realized something was wrong. Gan Jincheng and the others behind him were already injured. If they were to face the black-haired youth now, it would be difficult to escape death.

With a clang, he severed his opponent’s heavy long spear. Five-colored light blossomed as he continuously swung his saber, forcing the opponent back while intercepting the black-haired youth.

“Roar, die!” A wolf-headed demon, possessing a human body, stood over three meters tall and was exceptionally strong. Earlier, he had been pierced by Qin Ming’s iron arrow. Now, he swung a heavy, massive club to smash down.

Water mist swirled, and wind and thunder roared. Qin Ming shot lightning towards the black-haired youth’s back. At the same time, his five-colored saber, wreathed in electric light, met the wolf-headed demon.

To the opponent’s horror, he severed the incredibly heavy iron club with a single strike. The lightning then spread, making the wolf demon’s fur stand on end as he shrieked.

However, being a Second Realm demon, he was tough and resilient. He endured the attack without falling, and the golden-haired youth beside him thrust his long spear forward in support.

With a whoosh, the black-haired youth backhanded, shattering the lightning. In an instant, he spun around and swung his spiked mace at Qin Ming.

In the shortest span of time, the demons and Qin Ming’s group moved like lightning, rapidly clashing and colliding. Sounds of weapons shattering, crackling thunder, blazing flames, and a faint blue glow filled the air as both sides exerted their utmost to slay their enemies.

Gan Jincheng groaned, and Xiao Yaqin’s half-body was stained with blood. In the brief clash, although they hadn't encountered the three most powerful demon youths, they were already injured on top of injuries, swaying precariously.

Little Wu erupted, forcing his opponent back to provide aid. The fatigued Xin Youdao also gasped for breath and retreated, helping his own side.

Qin Ming blocked the powerful enemies, preventing them from passing. He used his five-colored saber to withstand the spiked mace, while simultaneously clenching his left fist and smashing it towards the wolf-headed demon who charged at him again.

Clouds and mist swirled, and five-colored smoke mist rose. This time, his fist light was exceptionally dazzling. A bolt of lightning shot out, piercing through the three-meter-tall wolf-headed demon’s protective demonic aura, blasting through his body.

The wolf-headed demon was ferocious, covered in blood. He threw down his shattered, broken club and extended his sharp claws towards the youth.

However, after his fan-sized giant claw came into contact with Qin Ming’s fist, it shattered inch by inch. Then, under the invasion of the scorching-sun-like Heaven Light Energy, his arm exploded, followed by half of his body.

He let out a miserable shriek. Half of his body shattered, and he collapsed directly, completely perishing.

Earth energy steamed beneath Qin Ming’s feet, making him seem to float. He rose from the ground and, with a whoosh, leaped out of the encirclement, temporarily retreating.

At this point, the two camps separated once more.

Among the three demon youths, the grey-haired youth’s shoulder was gushing blood, nearly torn open by Little Wu’s rainbow light.

Additionally, Wu Yaozu (Little Wu) also killed a demon while providing aid.

Currently, although Gan Jincheng and Xiao Yaqin were injured again, their injuries were not severe. On the demon side, however, two corpses remained.

Qin Ming sheathed his saber and stood, saying, “They’re quite strong!”

This was his true thought and feeling. After all, having comprehended the New Silk Calligraphy, his Heaven Light Energy had become even more formidable, and his strength had noticeably improved.

Under these circumstances, with him exerting his full power to slay demons, his opponents were actually able to clash head-on with him multiple times. This was certainly no small matter.

However, when his words reached the ears of others, they certainly 'tasted' different.

Was he praising them? Gan Jincheng was skeptical.

Jiang Ruoli’s beautiful eyes glowed with divine light as she looked at his back. She felt that this enigmatic youth truly seemed to be sighing in admiration, but why was it so full of mockery?

Xin Youdao knew very well that Qin Ming’s cultivation had advanced again. He was even more terrifying than when he fought Ling Yu. The five-colored saber, which once wavered like smoke, had become increasingly solid.

On the demon side, besides the three youths, there was also a bull demon and an eagle demon. Only these five members remained, but they were all established in the Second Realm and still very strong.

Their eyes were all malicious. This time, they had suffered heavy losses, with companions dying consecutively. The two newly arrived youths were each more troublesome than the last.

Little Wu spoke: “Is this chaotic melee interesting? Let the injured withdraw, and let’s fight amongst ourselves. After all, it will eventually be a decisive battle between us anyway!”

Then, he stared at the opposing side and said, “Grey-fur, do you dare to continue battling me?”

The grey-haired youth’s shoulder was bleeding profusely. He directly drank a can of golden blood, and the wound on his shoulder healed at a visible speed. His physical condition also became unprecedentedly good.

Then, he looked at the black-haired youth and said, “Big Brother, something is off today. I’ll have a true battle with him first to gauge how strong they really are. You can decide based on the situation.”

Then, the grey-haired youth’s voice turned icy cold as he looked at Little Wu, saying, “Baldy, no matter what, you definitely won’t be able to leave this secret realm unless a senior figure comes to guide you out. Otherwise, you’ll undoubtedly die!”

Little Wu was instantly dumbfounded. He touched his head, then became furious. It was just short hair, yet he was slandered like this?

In an instant, he and the grey-haired youth began to battle fiercely.

The grey-haired youth was fierce, wielding a massive axe with astonishing power. The axe light flashed, exploding like thunder. As a descendant of a high-level aberrant and a demon who had entered the Second Realm over two years ago, his cultivation was very profound.

However, rainbow light surged like electricity between Little Wu’s hands. He could directly clash with the giant axe and even deflect its force, fully capable of contending against a formidable Second Realm demon.

“A famous demon on the plateau, but nothing special,” Little Wu said. A moment later, his rainbow light boiled. With every palm strike, a runic rainbow light shot out.

The giant axe was actually pierced through, then shattered. The grey-haired youth staggered back.

The black-haired youth did not hesitate, crushing a blood crystal in his hand. Instantly, a dazzling crimson glow shot up into the high sky, lingering for a long time.

At the same time, he charged towards Little Wu, and the golden-haired youth beside him followed, bringing his long spear to bear.

Earth energy flowed beneath Qin Ming’s feet. As if stepping on an earthy-yellow divine bridge, he shot forward with a whoosh, moving at extreme speed to intercept the two.

In an instant, Little Wu and Qin Ming confronted the three demon youths.

“Are you calling for reinforcements?” Little Wu felt a bad premonition.

Qin Ming, even more silent, launched a fierce, full-power assault.

“Big Brother, you ultimately bowed to those few,” the grey-haired youth sighed, seemingly regretting for him.

The black-haired youth said, “No regrets. My competitiveness was never that great to begin with. My hope of becoming a Demon Seed was slim. I am not as good as them. If something happens to us today, I hope they avenge us!”

Behind them, Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, and the others’ expressions changed. Were there still other demon teams nearby?

The golden-haired youth also expressed regret, saying, “It’s a pity, Big Brother ate the ‘leftover provisions’ in the village. Your bloodline only mutated slightly. If you had fully succeeded, you would have had a certain chance to compete for the top spot and ultimately become a Demon Seed.”

Gan Jincheng and Xiao Yaqin’s faces turned pale. They realized how serious the situation was. Several special demon teams were lingering here, competing for the Demon Seed position!

Clearly, the other teams were even more terrifying. If they were to encounter them, it would be unimaginable.

The black-haired youth said, “Do you understand? That’s right, I deliberately said it for you all to hear. After all, those people are also my opponents. If you meet them, whether you live or die, the outcome will be good for me.”

As for now, he was still very strong, just feeling that something was amiss and had preemptively acknowledged the competition in this area.

“Come on, it’s not certain who will die here yet!” he shouted.

At this moment, Qin Ming and Little Wu both fell silent. Facing powerful enemies in the Second Realm, they both raised their strength.

For a moment, a rainbow light, like a sharp sword unsheathed, continuously slashed forward.

“Ah…” The grey-clothed youth, already severely wounded, shrieked. A large chunk of flesh was severed from his right arm, almost exposing the bone.

At the same time, Qin Ming was like a five-colored divine wheel soaring across the sky. His fist light was extremely dazzling, and his five-colored saber was even more soul-stirring, single-handedly blocking the other two.

“Go help Third Brother!” the black-haired youth shouted, engaging Qin Ming with his spiked mace, and sending the golden-haired youth to help on the other side.

In an instant, chaos erupted again. Five figures flew about, clashing with lightning speed.

Xin Youdao watched with rapt attention. He was deeply moved, realizing this was a true confrontation between masters. He had to enter the Second Realm as quickly as possible.

Liu Hanya, Gan Jincheng, and the others were all profoundly shaken. Four demons had torn through several of their teams, yet now, two youths were holding off three powerful demons. This comparison stirred immense waves in their hearts.

Qin Ming found that the black-haired youth was indeed extremely strong, truly deserving to be one of those with a chance to become a Demon Seed. He continuously counter-attacked Qin Ming, his spiked mace emanating dense black light as it swept over repeatedly.

Qin Ming didn’t know how many Outer Saints he had slain, but the demon youth before him was a tough bone, an extremely formidable character.

However, while dealing with this person, he also firmly held back the golden-haired youth.

“Ah…” On the other side, Little Wu’s opponent shrieked again, as an arm was severed and fell to the ground by a rainbow light, gushing blood.

The black-haired youth’s spiked mace was like a black sun exploding, aiming to blast Qin Ming away to personally rush over and provide aid.

At the same time, the golden-haired demon with the spear beside him roared, trying his utmost to break free from Qin Ming’s attack range and rush to that side.

“You’re not getting away!”

Qin Ming’s scorching-sun-like fist light carried a viscous force, seizing the two opponents’ weapons and pulling them towards himself.

With a puff, Little Wu succeeded. The rainbow light, like a divine sword, shot out, severing his dismembered opponent diagonally at the shoulder.

At the same time, Qin Ming’s Heaven Light Energy no longer focused on entanglement. He released his two opponents and unleashed his full power to slay them.

As Little Wu approached, Qin Ming’s fist light shattered the golden-haired youth’s long spear, and his five-colored saber pierced into the youth’s chest.

On the other side, the black-haired youth was both shocked and enraged. He had been briefly held back by Little Wu, and now another one of his companions was about to perish.

He roared, charging over.

Qin Ming didn't deliver a finishing blow to the already wounded demon, but instead met the black-haired youth head-on.

Little Wu arrived in an instant, colliding with the golden-haired youth. The wound on the latter’s chest was already transparent from front to back, his heart pierced by the five-colored saber. As soon as he exerted force, blood began to gush from his chest.

Puff! He was beheaded by Little Wu, perishing completely.

The black-haired youth roared.

He wished he could immediately slay Qin Ming, but he had already determined that he couldn’t defeat this human youth. He had exerted his utmost, yet still found himself at a disadvantage.

Qin Ming remained expressionless. There were multiple bloody corpses of human youths on the ground. Their factions were different. Even if the opponent was unwilling, it was useless. At this moment, only death awaited them!

The black-haired youth shouted at the nearby bull demon and eagle demon, “Hurry and go!”

“Where are you going?!” Little Wu charged over.

Qin Ming continuously swung his saber, and his fist light, like lightning, streaked across the sky without pause.

He and the black-haired youth clashed nearly a hundred times in the shortest amount of time. Even the spiked mace was shattered by him.

Moreover, his fist light repeatedly dispersed the opponent’s demonic energy, severely wounding his physical body.

With another punch, Qin Ming sent the black-haired youth flying. His chest had caved in, multiple bones were broken, and he fell to the ground.

Not far away, the eagle demon had already spread its wings, soaring into the high sky.

Qin Ming temporarily abandoned the black-haired youth, bending his bow and firing arrows. Amidst a series of thuds, his arrows never missed. Even if they were just iron arrows, with enough power, they could still pierce through an opponent.

Then, he even threw a long spear. With a puff, he pinned the eagle demon to death in mid-air.

In the distance, Little Wu also slew the bull demon.

An unexpected event occurred. The black-haired youth silently transformed, becoming a fierce beast covered in black fur, with a tiger’s head, a bird’s body, dragon claws, and bat wings.

He soared into the sky like a black bolt of lightning.

After death, high-level aberrants could still maintain human form. Now, the black-haired youth proactively manifested his true body, intending to escape.

Qin Ming picked up the long spears from the ground and continuously hurled them. Two clearly struck him, causing his body to shake violently and almost lose balance, plummeting a short distance.

But he stabilized himself and ascended again.

“He’s actually escaping!” Little Wu was annoyed, feeling that they had made a mistake and should have joined forces to kill the black-haired youth earlier.

Behind them, Jiang Ruoli, Liu Hanya, and the others’ expressions also changed. The strongest demon youth was about to escape; this was truly terrible.

Qin Ming took out his silver greatbow, drew an jade-iron arrow, aimed at the night sky, and continuously drew his bow.

Dazzling beams of light, like comets, pierced through the night sky, shooting from the ground towards high altitude.

These jade-iron arrows could carry Qin Ming’s Heaven Light upwards!

With a puff, blood splattered in the night sky. The black-haired youth grunted. Even though he evaded at extreme speed, he was still struck by an arrow.

And even as he used demonic energy to block the arrow feathers embedded in his flesh, they still left horrific wounds on his body. That Heaven Light seemed to tear him apart.

Puff! Puff! Qin Ming continued to draw his bow. After five arrows, the black fierce beast in the night sky plummeted, continuously shedding blood.

“Ah…” He roared, extremely unwilling. He couldn’t even escape this? He originally had an eighty percent chance of escaping, yet he was severely wounded and shot down.

He transformed back into human form. His body was no longer as large, retaining only his black bat wings.

At the same time, he took out a jar of golden medicinal liquid, poured it into his mouth. Instantly, his aura surged, and the wounds on his body began to disappear.

He flapped his wings again, intending to escape into the sky.

Qin Ming didn't even use his bow and arrows this time because, just as the opponent was plummeting at high speed, he had already reached the rooftop. The opponent was now only about a dozen meters above the ground.

Now, after the black-haired youth stabilized his body and just flapped his wings, intending to escape, he found that the human youth was rapidly running across the rooftops, then leaped high into the sky, arriving close by.

With a whoosh, the five-colored divine wheel outside Qin Ming’s body vanished. All of his five-colored Heaven Light Energy merged with the long saber in his hand, striking towards mid-air.

Despite the black-haired youth’s demonic energy boiling within him, he still couldn’t block it. He was already injured, and the golden liquid couldn’t instantly heal his internal organs, which had been previously damaged by the fist light.

Now, he was desperate. He roared, blocking with his wings and dragon claws.

With a puff, blood splattered. The black-clothed youth was bisected by the five-colored saber. His wings shattered, and blood rained down the sky. His body broke into two halves, plummeting towards the ground.

Qin Ming drifted down. Earth energy seemed to surface on the ground, allowing him to move as if riding the qi, silently landing.

“To think, I’ve fallen to such a state. But if you kill me, you won’t live either,” the black-haired youth gasped, extremely unwilling. He couldn’t believe he would die so miserably at the hands of a human youth.

Earth qi boiled beneath Qin Ming’s feet. Amidst clanging sounds, he retrieved the jade-iron arrows.

Evidently, the black-haired youth wouldn’t survive. After being bisected at the waist, his life force was rapidly draining.

Qin Ming’s fist glowed, dazzling like a scorching sun. He was concerned about any lingering demonic divine soul and prepared to use his special Heaven Light Energy to eliminate future troubles permanently.

“Heh, fine. I am indeed dying, but you should wait for death too,” the black-haired youth said, despairing. At his last moment, he gasped, “The fragmented ‘gift’ is yours. Haha, just wait for the others to come knocking.”

Within his body, a black light was surging. As his life force weakened, he could no longer suppress it.

With a boom, Qin Ming punched out. The black-haired youth exploded, perishing completely.

However, that black light flew out and did not dissipate, charging towards Qin Ming.

“Hm?” He cleaved it with his five-colored saber, splitting it open.

However, it quickly re-formed and continued to fly forward.

Qin Ming dodged at extreme speed, but it followed him like a shadow. Even when he blasted it apart with his scorching-sun-like Heaven Light Energy, it eventually reassembled, persistently clinging to him, and finally plunged into his flesh.

“What’s going on?” Little Wu was anxious but helpless. He had just tried to draw the black light away with his rainbow light but couldn’t.

Xin Youdao’s expression was solemn. He said, “I never imagined the competition for Demon Seeds among the demons would be so complex. There’s a rumor that demons with the potential to become Demon Seeds receive certain ‘gifts’ in advance, like that thing just now. Whoever kills such a person, that gift will transfer to them.”

Naturally, those who ultimately become Demon Seeds will receive numerous ‘gifts.’

Liu Hanya said, “Some say that these gifts are actually fragments of essence left behind by previously deceased Demon Seeds, also called fragmented Demon Seeds.”

Being in the Kunling territory and a senior from the previous batch, she naturally knew something about this plateau and had heard about certain situations.

Liu Hanya informed them: “Within the same territory, others who possess fragmented Demon Seeds will develop a sensation and be able to find this place!”

This was absolutely terrible news. Not long ago, the black-haired youth had already activated a soaring crimson glow, calling for aid from other competitors.

Coupled with the aura sensing of the fragmented Demon Seed, powerful enemies would inevitably be drawn here.

“Can you conceal it?” Xin Youdao asked.

Those competitors, like the black-haired youth just now, would normally try their best to suppress the Demon Seed’s aura to prevent others from sensing it and attracting competitors to hunt them down.

“Not for now!” Qin Ming frowned. He tried to extract and refine it with his Heaven Light Energy, feeling that it could be worn away, but it would take an extremely long time.

During this process, it was actually eroding his flesh and blood!

Those called Demon Seeds on the demon path were equivalent to Near-Immortal Seeds on the immortal path, all extremely formidable figures.

“We need to leave here quickly!” Jiang Ruoli said. More powerful demon teams might appear soon.

The human elders on their side were pioneering the plateau, recently occupying some territory. They hadn't noticed that several demon youth teams, competing for the Demon Seed position, remained in the secret realm and had already gone into hibernation.

Gan Jincheng, Xiao Yaqin, and the others quickly scavenged the healing medicines from their deceased companions on the ground, then continuously poured them into their mouths.

In the village, there were so-called glowing granaries, but they had all been eaten by the black-haired youth. It was likely that these were the opportunities of this place, which had a certain chance to mutate a demon’s bloodline.

It was impossible for the strange grains there to reappear in the short term; it would take several years of accumulation for them to be born again.

Within the dense forest, the group moved swiftly. Qin Ming’s body suddenly cracked open without warning, bleeding profusely.

“Is this the Demon Seed acting up?!” Little Wu worried.

Qin Ming frowned. He was extracting the demon. His own unparalleled Heaven Light Energy was indeed able to refine this Demon Seed, but the progress was slow, requiring time and endurance, and in this process, his flesh and blood were being torn apart.

“You all should leave. Don’t follow me. Other Demon Seeds might come knocking soon!” Qin Ming said to Xin Youdao and the others.

Xin Youdao shook his head, saying, “Our injuries have mostly recovered now. No matter what, we can still be of some help!”

“Exactly. If we were to abandon you directly, what kind of people would we be? You came to save us; how could we just leave?” Jiang Ruoli also spoke.

The others also chimed in, saying they would help him resist the other demons.

At such a critical juncture not long ago, these people had the chance to escape, yet they ultimately turned back. They were truly honorable, showing a youthful spirit of hot blood and courage.

At this moment, Qin Ming’s body continuously ruptured, his flesh and blood a blur, appearing quite horrifying and shocking.

“Brother!” Little Wu clenched his fists, unable to help.

Demons could attack at any time, and Qin Ming was experiencing such a critical situation. The atmosphere was somewhat heavy.

“Hm?!”

Just as Qin Ming was extracting the demon and his body’s flesh and blood were shattering, a miraculous art suddenly stirred, astonishing him greatly. It was actually the 《Dragon Serpent Scripture》. It was extremely active at this moment.

Then, after carefully sensing it, he smiled and said, “This isn’t bad. Let those Demon Seeds come as they please!”

At this moment, as he refined the Demon Seed with his Heaven Light Energy, his flesh and blood ruptured. This somewhat resembled the scenes described in the Dragon Serpent Scripture: for an ordinary snake to transform into a dragon, it must undergo tribulations, its flesh and blood shattering, paving the path with its life, only then having hope to cross the heavenly chasm and elevate its life essence.

Qin Ming discovered that it wasn’t that he needed to shatter himself to complete this transformation. Instead, when the Demon Seed was being refined by him, the Dragon Serpent Art itself stirred, seeking to absorb it and transform it into a cultivation resource.

“From snake to dragon.” He mused, the Dragon Serpent Scripture might have originated from demons, but humans could also cultivate it. Therefore, after this Demon Seed was crushed and refined by him, it could also be utilized.

As time passed, he found that his Dragon Serpent Energy was growing stronger!

“This is remarkable!” Qin Ming was surprised. In the past, all his various energy arts required absorbing Heaven Light to rapidly grow stronger.

But now, it was highly possible that he could cultivate the 《Dragon Serpent Scripture》 to great mastery without needing to absorb Heaven Light!

He even wondered if his ninth rebirth could rely on his own transformation? Could he just cross that barrier and complete the most crucial nirvana?
