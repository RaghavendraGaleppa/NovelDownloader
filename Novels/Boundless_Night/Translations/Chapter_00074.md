# Chapter 74: Comparable to Legends

"After this rebirth is completely finished, will I be able to recall everything?" Qin Ming had long had some suspicions about his past. But some things were still shrouded in mist, waiting to be dispelled.

He was once Cui Chonghe, the true direct descendant. Why did he leave the Cui family? After being severely injured, why was he thrown onto Black and White Mountain to recover? What truly silenced him was that his relatives wanted to keep him confined to the remote lands, preventing him from returning to the world with daylight, and not wanting him to approach his former circles. Although he was now Qin Ming, no longer Cui Chonghe, he still wanted to know the full story.

Qin Ming sat in quiet meditation, his heart as calm as still water. After a simple wash, he lay on his bed, no longer resisting sleepiness, letting himself drift into dreamland.

A silver light emerged, like a layer of silver paste applied to his body. Then, golden needles threaded through, crisscrossing and interweaving upon him, as if he were once again donning the Golden-Threaded Jade Garment. Especially among his hair, tiny golden needles stitched densely, as if continuously mending, causing Qin Ming's entire head to emit a golden glow. Qin Ming, deep in slumber, slightly furrowed his brow, seemingly sensing something. A faint sound came from his skull, accompanied by throbbing pain, which then turned into intense heat. He briefly awoke, realizing what was happening. As there was no danger, he emptied his mind again, sinking back into deep sleep.

Three spots on Qin Ming's skull glowed most intensely with golden light; these were the places once shattered by the feather-robed youth. Dense golden needles appeared, piercing through his scalp, entering the bone, and then delving even deeper. The silver paste, like medicine, was applied to the surface, as if to smooth out the lingering traces of old wounds. Golden needles mended, silver light baptized, eradicating all old ailments. Although Qin Ming was not fully conscious, in the depths of his subconscious, he perceived the crucial role of the "Golden-Threaded Jade Garment," which involved recovery, and even the true meaning of resurrection. Perhaps, this was the true essence of the body's rebirth process. With no danger approaching, he remained in slumber.

In the latter half of the night, Qin Ming entered a semi-conscious state. He saw the silk scroll again, seeing his younger self, waiting for that rough hand to turn the page. The Fourth New Birth was related to perception. Besides the enhancement of his five senses, his innate intuition would become exceptionally keen, potentially saving his life at crucial moments. And since this rebirth specifically involved head consciousness, the three areas of Qin Ming's skull that had once been shattered glowed intensely all night. Golden needles mended, silver paste covered, and then large amounts of spiritual substances derived from the Thunder-Fire Heavenly Light continuously poured into them. The rough hand finally moved, turning the silk scroll to the fourth page. In addition to continuing the previous discourse, completely explaining the cultivation of the five senses and intuitive consciousness, it also revealed the method for the Fifth New Birth.

In the early morning, Scarlet Cloud City gradually brightened. Within the city, there was already a clear distinction between day and night. Some sophisticated large cities would even gradually adjust the brightness of their 'fire springs,' for example, making them strongest at noon. In even more magnificent giant cities, people would even create scenes of glowing sunset clouds filling the sky in the evenings. Naturally, the wilderness remained shrouded in night. Even in the capital of a kingdom, or the imperial city of a vast empire, looking out from its city walls, one would still see nothing but darkness.

Qin Ming pushed open the window. The sky, gradually brightening with the rising fiery glow, was completely different from the dim nightscape he had seen on Black and White Mountain. He didn't find it as novel as Wu Zheng, because he had experienced all this before. As his fragmented memories rapidly reassembled, past scenes were gradually becoming clear. Qin Ming took a deep breath; it was clear his heart was not at peace. He gripped his Mutton-fat Jade Iron Saber tightly and went into the courtyard, unleashing a series of wind and thunder sounds with his slashes! The combat techniques from the three secret manuals — saber, spear, and hammer — were blended together by him. All weapons were extensions and expansions of his arm.

"Brother Qin's killing intent is a bit strong," Wu Zheng muttered in the inn. As fragmented scenes rapidly reassembled and various images flooded his mind, Qin Ming's heart felt disquieted, making it hard for him to remain unaffected. These were segments of his past, one after another. A person without a past was surely incomplete; he had to accept all his memories.

"Brother Qin, I brought you breakfast. Are you alright?" Wu Zheng appeared, seeing Qin Ming swinging his saber in the courtyard. The saber in his hand sometimes flashed like lightning, sometimes vibrated to create dozens of blade shadows, sometimes thrust forward like a long spear, and sometimes struck like a heavy hammer, producing booming sounds.

"I'm fine. I'm undergoing rebirth, and I had a sudden urge. It feels uncomfortable if I don't properly stretch my muscles and bones. If only there was a multi-mutated beast right in front of me now." Qin Ming felt that if he were to encounter the five-times mutated Old Golden Rooster from Golden Rooster Ridge now, he could pierce it to death with a spear or blast it apart with a hammer!

Not long after, Xu Sheng arrived at the inn, wanting to check on Qin Ming's condition after the heavenly light anointing. "How do I feel like your body's vitality is even more vigorous than mine? What state are you actually in?" Xu Sheng was surprised and uncertain, believing this was no illusion.

"My body's rebirth is almost complete, and my perception is still improving. I'm currently in a full recovery state, without concealment, so my aura appears quite strong." Xu Sheng was stunned upon hearing this. Were the things he usually saw not representations of Qin Ming's true strength? Wu Zheng's eyes showed a strange look.

Xu Sheng said, "Don't conceal it anymore. Come on, let's go test your physical strength after your Fourth New Birth. As for the realm of perception, it's too profound; we're not extraordinary individuals, so there's no way to test it for now."

"I don't want more people to know," Qin Ming stated. His current situation was delicate, his future unpredictable. If certain matters were to spread to Clear River City, Thousand Star City, and other places before he was strong enough, the consequences would be hard to foresee. He hadn't intended to hide it from Xu Sheng; the other party already knew about his entry into the Thunder-Fire Refining Palace, so concealing it further was meaningless.

"It's fine, let's go to my friend's place. She has all sorts of equipment there to test physical attributes." Xu Sheng was very curious about what level Qin Ming had reached after his Fourth New Birth.

Qin Ming realized that Xu Sheng's friend, Zhou Lin, was the same person he had gone into the mountains with last time to pick snow lotus, only to have them snatched away. She was very down-to-earth, cursing colorfully all the way back to the city. Zhou Lin's establishment, which taught people how to embark on the path of rebirth, had excellent business, with most of its students being teenagers. In this city where land was as precious as gold, the training hall occupied a considerable area.

A moment later, Xu Sheng was utterly petrified, unable to believe what he was seeing. Qin Ming, after his Fourth New Birth, could lift a cauldron weighing 4,500 jin. Wu Zheng was dumbfounded; such divine strength left him in awe.

"Brother Qin, is this really your Fourth New Birth? Are you sure it's not the sixth... or seventh?" Wu Zheng was startled.

Xu Sheng muttered to himself, "There really are people like this! The records in ancient books weren't deceiving later generations or exaggerating; I've seen it in reality."

"What do those records say?" Wu Zheng asked.

Xu Sheng replied, "One book mentions that in ancient times, a young prodigy, upon his first new birth, possessed nearly a thousand jin of strength in his arms. His innate talent was terrifyingly high."

Wu Zheng became somewhat excited, saying, "Legends have come to life! Someone by my side can actually rival a young prodigy recorded in books!" Soon, he corrected himself: "No, wait, I calculated it. When Brother Qin had his first new birth, his arm strength should have exceeded 1,100 jin."

Xu Sheng was completely numb, finding it incredible. "Brother Qin, when you had your first new birth, did you really... have such great strength?" Wu Zheng's voice trembled slightly.

"Although I haven't thoroughly tested it, it should have exceeded a thousand jin," Qin Ming replied.

Xu Sheng sighed, "Little Qin's arms definitely had over 1,100 jin of strength back then. Such an endowment is like a living legend to other newly born individuals." He then asked, "Early spring is here. Those ancient Daoist lineages, mysterious grand organizations, and prestigious academies from the 'Radiant Lands' will all begin recruiting disciples. Little Qin, have you decided where you want to go?"

"It's too early to discuss those things. I don't know much about them anyway. There's still time; I just need to make a choice before mid-summer." Qin Ming's thoughts were currently chaotic, as all the fragmented scenes had surfaced, most having been reassembled, with the rest still in progress.

"What are you three doing? You've moved my hall's lapis lazuli stele. Did you three work together?" Zhou Lin appeared, a suspicious look on her face. Xu Sheng laughed heartily, offering no reply.

On the way back, Qin Ming went to an old-established bookstore and bought a stack of "Night Reports," a compilation from the past three years. The official gazettes were government-issued and inaccessible to ordinary people. Night Reports, run by private individuals, were more popularized.

"The content here is very general, doesn't involve sensitive information, and many major events are just briefly mentioned," Xu Sheng said.

Qin Ming said, "It's fine. I just want to get a general idea of the major events from the past two or three years." Back at the inn, he didn't go out again, secluding himself in his room. While waiting for the rebirth to fully conclude, he read through the Night Reports, mainly selecting major events and news related to the Cui family.

"Dynasties flow like water, but aristocratic families are forged in iron," Qin Ming sighed. Some ancient aristocratic families had existed for two to three millennia. The Night Reports had all mentioned that it was difficult to shake a thousand-year-old aristocratic family. Despite enduring various wars and upheavals caused by strange beings, they had suffered heavy blows but never truly fallen.

"Two years ago..." Qin Ming quickly searched for the information he needed, verifying it against the increasingly clear memories in his mind. The Cui family had experienced a significant upheaval two years ago, but the Night Reports did not delve deep into the internal causes, only mentioning that two behemoths had briefly clashed before retreating. From two years ago until now, Qin Ming roughly browsed through various major events.

He put down the thick stack of Night Reports, gazing at the hazy images before his eyes: giant cities wreathed in evening glow, and spiritual mountains steaming with ethereal mist. All were gradually becoming clear. Figures came and went, and many acquaintances were recalled one by one: his parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, and many clan members all appeared. Then, the feather-robed youth, Li Qingyue, and his old acquaintances and friends—various figures were all walking towards him. Qin Ming watched calmly, as if observing scenes of someone else's tragedies and comedies.
