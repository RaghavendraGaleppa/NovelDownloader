# Chapter 172: The Skin Suit

Watching Xu Yunfan’s departing figure disappear beyond the great gate, Zhan Yan, who had been standing ramrod straight, suddenly slumped. He immediately broke into a sprint, rushing toward the Mechanism Hall through another side. In less than the time it took to brew a pot of tea, he burst into the hall.

Inside the Mechanism Hall, steam billowed like a sea of clouds, obscuring the entire area so that figures could not be seen clearly. In Mo Han’s palm, a black steel golden ball emitting the sound of continuously clicking gears and mechanisms shot out three feet of green flame, casting his deeply lined face in flickering light and shadow.

His mechanical prosthetic fingers suddenly clamped onto the球’s threads. With a sharp *clack* of a spring mechanism, the chest of the mechanical beast burst open. The meshing sound of three thousand six hundred gears shook the floor tiles, making them hum.

"Two years ago, when I asked for the Skyfall Cold Iron, Old Brother Zhan didn't even utter a single soft word."

Mo Han stuffed the metal ball into the beast’s cavity. As the armor plates closed layer by layer, a string of sparks flew. The two crystal eyes of this tiger-shaped mechanical beast actually lit up with a glow. Originally stiff, its body began to slowly move as steam sprayed from the gaps in its bones.

Seeing this, Mo Han couldn't help but reveal a hint of a smile. He turned his head to look at Zhan Yan standing behind him.

"Now you're willing to bend your waist for a mere youth?"

Zhan Yan’s knuckles turned white from gripping.

The observation mirror seven steps away reflected his taut spine—a spine that hadn't bent even when the Divine Weapon Ridge was smashed thirty years ago.

His Adam's apple rolled three times before he finally spoke in a hoarse voice: "The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer consumed three catties of the Mo Sect's secret silver. This time... I still have to trouble Hall Master Mo."

"You, your entire life, have never been inferior to others, nor begged others!"

Mo Han’s face was full of mockery. "Back when Sect Master Hong invited you into the Skyforge Cave to establish the Casting Hall repeatedly, you looked down on us completely."

Seeing Old Man Zhan’s embarrassment naturally delighted Mo Han immensely.

His Mechanism Hall was a money pit. The Casting Hall could easily earn over a million taels by selling just one treasure artifact, plus various materials, making it extremely popular.

Over the years, their Mechanism Hall had been criticized quite a bit, with people saying that the Casting Hall's money was being poured into the bottomless pit of the Mechanism Hall. If the Skyforge Fortress hadn't appeared, clearing the Mechanism Hall's name and showing where the money had actually gone, they wouldn't have had the confidence to stand tall.

Seeing Zhan Yan’s face turn pale and then green, Mo Han didn't dare to push him too far. If he really forced Zhan Yan to suddenly drop to his knees without caring about his dignity, the joke would be too big.

Xu Yunfan’s talent was astonishing, especially his forging skills, which were a natural gift. Zhan Yan regarded him as his successor, so this matter naturally had to be taken seriously.

"Wait here. I seem to recall seeing something similar in an ancient record back in the day."

Leaving that sentence, Mo Han turned and walked to a study filled with scattered ancient scrolls, starting to rummage through boxes and cabinets, leaving the somewhat dazed Zhan Yan behind.

About half an hour later, Mo Han pulled out a roll of yellowed rhinoceros hide paper from a corner. He shook off the dust on it and muttered, "Good thing I didn't use it to wipe my backside back then. These are all useless now."

As he spoke, he shouted loudly outward, "Shisan, come tidy up the study for me!"

Outside the door, Mo Shisan: "......"

The two found a deserted place, and Mo Han spread the ancient scroll open on the table.

"The purpose of the Extreme Dao's Entrustment was originally to resist the extinction of the world's spiritual energy, hoping to preserve its own will until the day it could revive. It can be considered a fierce object that steals the creations of heaven and earth. Back then, the Lord of the Sword Casting Valley was devoured by the sword spirit; his entire body's essence blood transformed into three thousand sword beams shooting out from his body!"

"If it weren't for that mess caused by the Great Zhou Empress Dowager, and if the world's spiritual energy were scattered a bit, there wouldn't be any problems. But the bad part is that now, the world's spiritual energy has reappeared with the appearance of being about to disperse, just like two thousand years ago. This has stimulated these objects of Extreme Dao's Entrustment."

Mo Han couldn't help but grin. "The world thinks it's a great opportunity, but it might just be a great danger."

Hearing this, Zhan Yan hurriedly asked, "Is there a solution?"

"Don't be anxious, don't be anxious."

Mo Han’s bony finger slid across the page, pondering carefully for a long time. Finally, his finger stopped at a line of tadpole-like ancient seal script: "We need to find a person who is on the verge of death to serve as the cauldron. When their soul is about to scatter but hasn't yet, the Three Jiaos and Xuan Passages are easiest to connect."

Zhan Yan’s pupils contracted sharply.

"You mean, find someone who has just died as a cauldron, and transfer that Extreme Dao's Entrustment onto the other party?"

Mo Han lowered his head and continued to ponder the wording, then shook his head. "The conditions are too harsh, it's very difficult. The materials needed are still unavailable, it's almost impossible."

Zhan Yan’s heart went cold. "No other way?"

"He has to rely on himself. If he can break through, naturally the world will be vast, and the fish will leap through the dragon gate."

Zhan Yan remained silent for a long time, still unwilling to accept it.

Mo Han sighed inwardly and comforted, "Your disciple's talent is unparalleled. Those objects of Extreme Dao's Entrustment have been around for an unknown amount of time; their divinity has likely been damaged by ninety-nine percent. Otherwise, how could your disciple have stood before you safe and sound?"

Hearing this, Zhan Yan’s tense expression finally eased a lot, and he nodded slightly. "Thank you for the information."

Inside the Casting Hall, in the small courtyard where Xu Yunfan lived.

Xu Yunfan laid the skin suit flat on the table, gazing at it quietly.

Recalling the face of the woman in his dream, it faintly overlapped with the woman in the Source Ancient Jade Wall that was dug out from the Ninggu Tower mine.

It's her!

Xu Yunfan’s emotions churned. When he obtained this relic from Ninggu Tower, he had hardly examined it closely because it was extremely tough and could dissipate force, and under the condition of being impervious to blades and spears with excellent flexibility, he used it as a rope or tied it around his body as a vest. Because of this, it saved his life when he encountered the Gilded Whip earlier.

Now, looking closely, he was startled to realize that this form's entire body flowed with a soft glow like moonlight, condensing into skin.

Hair fell like clouds hanging from the sky; each strand shimmered with the dark cyan color of a newborn raven's feather. The last three inches of the tips gradually turned transparent, as if melting into the sky-silkworm silk in the air. This was where he had tied knots when he used it as a vest.

When his fingertips touched his forehead, he unexpectedly discovered a warmth rising along his finger pad.

It wasn't the soft elasticity of living flesh, but more like stroking a whole piece of sheep-fat jade that had been baked by the earth's core fire for a thousand years. There was a warmth that透着难以言说的绵密 (carried an indescribable density).

Upon closer inspection, a faint glow flowed beneath the skin, much like the flowing clouds sweeping over the Kunlun peaks in late spring, blooming with a faint golden crimson against the porcelain-white base.

Xu Yunfan’s gaze sharpened. It seemed... it was different from before. Previously, it felt slightly cool to the touch, and only when worn on his body, radiated by his body temperature, would it warm up. Now, however, it was naturally warm.

At the position of the skin suit's facial features, the lips maintained an arc as if about to speak. The lip lines were so fine they seemed drawn by morning dew.

The most peculiar thing was the light blue veins on the side of the neck; even now they remained lifelike. They didn't look like the flow of mortal blood vessels, but rather like the natural patterns left by a cedar branch on glass.

As he stroked down along the spine, the sensation gradually changed.

The skin at the waist hollows shimmered with a nacreous luster. When his fingertips rubbed it finely, it brought a sense of delicate smoothness.

The entire skin suit showed not a trace of decay; even the nails were like freshly peeled pink shells, with a layer of iridescence floating on the surface.

Ice-like skin turns into rainbow halos, snow-white cheeks透出 rosy light.

*(I can't go on, I'm exhausted. I'll continue writing ten thousand words tomorrow. Thank you, everyone!)*
