# Chapter 35: An Embrace in the Abyss

"They jumped down the ten-thousand-zhang abyss..."
"They didn't hesitate even a little..."

Yin Huacheng's mind went blank, his pupils constricting to needlepoints.
He had witnessed many people's ugly contortions before death.
But he had never seen anyone rush headlong to their demise without the slightest hesitation.
He didn't even know how deep the Azure Abyss was, and a powerful pressure still lingered within it. Once one fell, their Qi and Blood, internal energy, form and intent, and even their inner and outer worlds would be suppressed.
Even a Sect Master whose strength reached the Outer Scenery realm probably wouldn't dare descend without ample preparation.
Two Qi and Blood realm cultivators – a definite death sentence.

"Lunatics!"
"You two are crazier than I am!"
Yin Huacheng slammed his fist onto the ground, a deep regret swelling in his heart.
The reason he had dodged that sword earlier was precisely because he feared injury!
If he were injured, he might reveal his true identity.
But that was still better than trying to steal a chicken and losing a handful of rice, as was happening now!
This meant he had not only failed to obtain top-grade cultivation materials but had also committed the grave crime of attempting to murder true disciples!

"The elders will be here soon."
Yin Huacheng forcibly suppressed the turbulent emotions within him.
He quickly shed his black robes and threw them into the Azure Abyss along with his iron mask, then changed into a true disciple's attire.
After completing all this, he prepared to send a message to the elders.
However, before he could act,
Boom—
A fiery meteor crashed barely three *zhang* away from the cliff, its impact raising dust and rocks, creating the illusion that the entire Moon-Gazing Cliff had trembled thrice.
As the dust settled,
A woman in fiery red palace robes stood, her sleeves fluttering, her dark hair dancing, tracing the shape of the wind.
"Where are my disciples?"
Her voice, now devoid of drunkenness, sounded somewhat unfamiliar.

"Gulp—"
Yin Huacheng's throat felt parched from the scorching heat. The elaborate explanation he had prepared was stuck, not a single word escaping his lips.
"Disciple... Disciple just arrived as well."
"Shang Wu, calm down and speak properly."
Other elders also landed on the peak.
"Let's first figure out what happened."
Yin Huaxuan cast a deep glance at his son.
Feeling a little more confident, Yin Huacheng then spoke:
"Moon-Gazing Cliff is the area under this disciple's charge. Upon hearing the signal arrow, I immediately rushed here."
"But by the time I arrived, Moon-Gazing Cliff was already empty."
As his words fell,
Everyone's expressions instantly turned extremely grim.
There was only one path up Moon-Gazing Cliff.
They hadn't seen Li Mo and Ying Bing on their way up, nor were they on the cliff top, which could only mean...
Everyone's gaze turned towards the Azure Abyss, their hearts sinking to the bottom.

"This longsword belongs to Ying Bing."
"She must have encountered an enemy she couldn't handle, hence her desperate strike."
Xue Jing's face was pale as he stepped forward, holding a longsword.
The sword was encased in frost, still radiating a chilling aura.
"Those two youngsters are no ordinary Qi and Blood realm cultivators. Together, even if they can't defeat an Internal Energy realm expert, they could at least hold out until we arrived."
"The one who attacked them... was a God-Gazing realm cultivator?"
No sooner had Qian Bufan spoken than silence fell.
No one had imagined that the true target of the Demonic Cult fiend behind Wang Hu was actually the two true disciples.

Bang—
Suddenly, Yin Huacheng coughed up blood and flew backward.
Just as he was about to crash into a tree, an unseen force dissipated his momentum, causing him to spin several times before he stumbled and regained his footing.
Yin Huaxuan supported his son, frowning.
"Shang Wu, no one wanted this to happen."
"There are casualties every year during trials. Supervising such a vast area, it's inevitable that one might be stretched thin. Are you suggesting everyone should blame the deacons?"
A flash of crimson flickered in Shang Wu's narrowed eyes.
She didn't make another move, merely stating coldly:
"Don't let me ever find out that you have any connection to this matter."
Yin Huacheng looked as if he was facing a formidable enemy, his face instantly turning deathly pale.
"Shang Wu!"
Yin Huaxuan roared in anger, "I understand your feelings, but don't accuse others groundlessly!"
Shang Wu ignored his fury.

"Alright, now is not the time for internal strife."
Qian Bufan asked, "Yin Hua, do you have any news from the birds you control?"
"Moon-Gazing Cliff is close to the Azure Abyss, so flying creatures cannot approach."
"I will search the surrounding area, and if I find any suspicious individuals, I will notify you all immediately."
Yin Huaxuan nodded.
Xue Jing let out a heavy sigh: "Searching for the demonic fiend is secondary; the most urgent task is to ascertain Li Mo and Ying Bing's life or death!"
"If they are still alive, how can we rescue them?"
Silence.
Upon hearing this, the elders all fell into contemplation.
They knew nothing about the situation beneath the Azure Abyss.
There were almost no records about this place within the sect.
Many powerful cultivators of the Azure Abyss Sect had suspected the existence of a rare treasure below, which was why the Abyss had an everlasting pressure.
Many had attempted to explore it, but they either vanished without a trace or retreated halfway.
Jumping down from here, it was truly likely that they would be neither seen alive nor found dead...

Suddenly.
Ding-a-ling—
Something rang twice?
A strange light flashed in Shang Wu's almond-shaped eyes, and she quickly raised her wrist.
It was the Heart-Link Bell!
Li Mo was still alive!
"Quick, stop her!"
"Junior Martial Niece Shang Wu, don't be so quick to jump down!"
"The person is still alive; let's discuss a method, we can definitely rescue them."
Shang Wu was about to impulsively jump down to save them.
The elders quickly tried to stop her.
The scene became chaotic for a moment.
Only Yin Huacheng and Yin Huaxuan, father and son, simultaneously revealed a hint of astonishment on their faces.
Just as Yin Huacheng was about to say something, his father's grim gaze stopped him.
"Get back to Treasure Beast Peak!"
"...Yes."

......

"Master should know I'm still alive now."
Li Mo tightly clutched the Heart-Link Bell, thinking to himself.
After falling for so long amidst the clouds and mist, one seemed to lose the concept of time and space.
What was certain was that they had fallen very deep.
The oppressive force also grew heavier and heavier. Li Mo could barely perceive anything around him, as if everything had vanished with the howling cold wind.
Only the icy touch of the small hand in his palm gave him a sliver of real sensation.
Li Mo vaguely glanced at the owner of the small hand.
Her narrowed eyes still held the same cold, pristine clarity that had never changed.
He wondered if it was confidence,
Or simply a complete lack of fear of death.

"From such a height, if she weren't the Daughter of Destiny, she'd surely be dead, right?"
"Probably not even a speck of dust would remain..."
"It's so high; even if there were some protective mechanism below, she might still be knocked unconscious or injured from the fall."
That unknown inheritance ground would surely be impossible to explore without Ying Bing.
If it were so easily found, it wouldn't still exist to this day.
So...
The Ice Lump couldn't be hurt.
Thinking this, Li Mo, as if by some impulse, pulled her closer.
Soft jade entered his embrace.
A gentle yet strong heartbeat transmitted from her soft body.
Ying Bing: "?"
She didn't struggle, merely watched in confusion as the young man slowly shifted his back downwards.
Was he trying to be a human cushion for her?
Even with a heart as still as water, she couldn't help but feel a touch of absurd amusement, wanting to laugh and cry at the same time.
From such a height, if they really hit the ground directly, what good would a cushion do?
She had never been so close to a member of the opposite sex before.
In her previous life, no man dared to approach within three meters of her.
Ying Bing lightly bit her lip.
If she moved, it might change their trajectory...
In the end, she didn't push the young man away.
