# Chapter 123: So Many High-Tier Magical Artifacts I Can't Use Them All

Only after all of them were killed did Chu Ning slightly relax.
However, his gaze towards Xu Runsheng was a bit complex.
He saw Xu Runsheng's entire body rapidly shriveling.
Strangely, a fork was stuck in Xu Runsheng's throat, yet not much blood flowed out.
"This Blood Fiend Pill must consume a massive amount of vital blood. Last time, Duan Yanwu's fireballs burned too quickly, so I didn't notice."
As Chu Ning muttered to himself, Tan Zhang and Lin Lan in the distance had already walked over.
Judging by Tan Zhang's pale face, he clearly didn't have an easy time receiving Xu Runsheng's last strike.
As for Lin Lan, her pretty face was also a bit pale at the moment.
But it seemed more like she was frightened rather than injured.
It was probably because during the fight, Xu Runsheng, seeing her low cultivation, didn't make her his primary target.
Moreover, she was from the Talisman Pavilion and had received rewards from the Hundred Treasures Pavilion last time, so she might have some life-saving methods.
"Many thanks, Senior Brother Li...!"
Tan Zhang came before Chu Ning, originally intending to casually call Chu Ning, a sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator, Junior Brother.
But remembering that all six of those people were killed by Chu Ning, he couldn't bring himself to say "Junior Brother."
"If it weren't for your reminder just now, and then your later intervention, Junior Sister Lin and I probably would have..."
"Senior Brother Tan, you're too polite. Just call me Junior Brother," Chu Ning said, shaking his head slightly.
"It was just good luck that I arrived here and they mistook me for an accomplice. If Senior Brother Tan had arrived any later, my identity would probably have been exposed.
How could I have had the chance to kill these cultivators from the Yin Demon Sect?"
Chu Ning spoke half-truths, but it had to be said that Tan Zhang's appearance indeed gave him an opportunity.
If Xu Runsheng and Yu Jiehui had been on guard against him when they first appeared,
and if he couldn't kill them directly in a fight, he would have found it quite troublesome facing them after they consumed the Blood Fiend Pills.
Just now, after consecutively ambushing and killing several people, and with Tan Zhang providing a slight distraction, Chu Ning was able to succeed.
Tan Zhang nodded slightly, then looked at Chu Ning with surprise.
"Senior Brother Li's combat methods and experience are truly extensive. You have so many magical artifacts and talismans on you, and your talismans..."
Hearing Tan Zhang about to bring up the details of the battle, Chu Ning quickly waved his hand.
"I just accumulated some spirit stones when I was in the Outer Affairs Hall before, and then bought a few more life-saving items.
The next part will be more troublesome. Since the Yin Demon Sect arranged for people to infiltrate, there definitely won't be just these few."
Hearing Chu Ning's words, Tan Zhang's attention was indeed drawn away.
He immediately said, "Exactly. We must quickly warn our other senior and junior brothers about the Yin Demon Sect disciples' infiltration, lest others fall into their trap."
Chu Ning heard this, but shook his head.
What Tan Zhang said was simply not practical.
Because now, no one knew how to identify who was from the Yin Demon Sect. If it weren't for seeing Lu Yunfang earlier today, Chu Ning wouldn't have thought of this.
What's more, everyone was dispersed now, making it impossible to notify them.
Chu Ning casually voiced his concerns, and Tan Zhang's expression immediately turned serious, mixed with a hint of distress.
Chu Ning, however, didn't dwell on that problem and began to pick up the storage bags and magical artifacts from the bodies.
As Chu Ning collected these items, Tan Zhang and Lin Lan watched from the side.
Neither of them found anything amiss; after all, Chu Ning had killed these people.
Without Chu Ning's intervention, both of them would surely have been doomed.
After Chu Ning finished collecting items from each body and then burned them clean with fireballs, Tan Zhang stepped forward and said,
"Junior Brother Chu, let's go together from now on. It'll be good to have company."
Hearing Tan Zhang's words, Lin Lan also looked at Chu Ning with expectation.
Just now, because they were fighting Xu Runsheng, they hadn't clearly seen how Chu Ning killed those people.
However, Chu Ning's ability to kill so many people and the strength he displayed undoubtedly brought them a great sense of security.
Chu Ning heard this, but shook his head.
"Let's go our separate ways. I'm used to being alone and don't like traveling with others."
He was currently using a shape-shifting spell, but he couldn't use it constantly. When he reached the array formation site, Chu Ning would eventually have to appear in his original form.
Moreover, Chu Ning had many secrets. If he stayed with them for too long, he would naturally be easily exposed.
In that case, being with Tan Zhang and the others would be inconvenient.
In fact, Chu Ning had already exposed many of his methods during the recent engagement.
Fortunately, when Chu Ning first used the Divine Wood Longbow, Tan Zhang and the others were still fighting Xu Runsheng and didn't notice.
And when several people later fought together, Chu Ning mostly used talismans, which wouldn't expose his identity.
The Earth Spirit Bracelet was not used.
However, Tan Zhang and the others might have seen the Blazing Flame Bracelet and the Tian Gang Fist, but these were life-saving methods that Chu Ning would not easily display.
When it truly came to using those, whether his identity was exposed would not matter as much.
Chu Ning spoke to the two and then left on his own.
Tan Zhang was not willing to give up and chased a few steps, saying,
"Let's still go together. With the three of us, if we encounter any danger, we can support each other."
Chu Ning now simply said with a somewhat cold expression,
"No need. I don't want to be a burden to you."
As he spoke, Chu Ning's gaze swept over Lin Lan.
The round-faced female disciple from the Talisman Pavilion immediately looked incredibly awkward.
Tan Zhang also hadn't expected Chu Ning to say such hurtful words.
Immediately, the warmth on his face dissipated.
Chu Ning didn't wait for them to say anything and simply left on the wind.
He didn't even follow the indicated direction but specifically turned a slight corner.
Only after Chu Ning's figure disappeared did Tan Zhang helplessly shake his head and say to Lin Lan,
"Let's go too. Be careful on the way, and let's see if we can find any other senior or junior brothers to join us later."
As he spoke, the two took out their direction-guiding needles, glanced at them, and continued forward.
At this moment, Chu Ning, at the other end, changed his appearance immediately after walking for a while.
He walked about fifty to sixty li further, then turned back and headed towards the direction indicated by the guiding needle.
At the same time, he released Ling Xiaobai again.
However, the little fellow was quite conspicuous, so Chu Ning didn't let it stand on his shoulder.
Instead, he let it shrink and burrow into his sleeve.
After walking for a while, he found a relatively hidden spot in the forest. Chu Ning sent Ling Xiaobai a little further away to stand guard.
He then swallowed a Rejuvenation Pill and began to circulate the Verdant Wood Longevity Art to recuperate.
After this battle with the Yin Demon Sect cultivators, Chu Ning had consumed a certain amount of magic power.
Realizing that this so-called mission wouldn't be too simple, Chu Ning naturally wanted to maintain relatively abundant magic power at all times.
A quarter of an hour later, his magic power was fully restored.
Chu Ning didn't rush to leave now but took out the storage bags and various magical artifacts he had obtained from the several cultivators.
Chu Ning only glanced at the storage bags of the cultivators below the seventh Qi Refining level and then set them aside.
These few had died too quickly and hadn't taken out any treasures.
After looking through them, Chu Ning also found that they indeed didn't have anything good.
The magical artifacts in their storage bags were only the intermediate-tier magical artifacts issued by the sect when entering this mission area.
In addition, there were some talismans, as well as some pills and spirit stones.
Chu Ning also generally looked at the pills. What surprised Chu Ning slightly was that none of these people had Blood Fiend Pills on them.
Many of the pills inside were just commonly used pills within the Green Stream Sect.
For example, Lu Yunfang's Spirit Gathering Pills, and the Spirit Essence Pills in the storage bags of the two seventh-level Qi Refining disciples.
"It seems that the Blood Fiend Pill might also be a valuable item within the Yin Demon Sect, not something everyone can use."
As Chu Ning thought this, he opened the storage bag of the eighth-level Qi Refining disciple from the Transmission Hall whom he had killed.
This person also died very quickly. When he had just reacted to defend, Chu Ning had unleashed a handful of talismans, with two low-grade intermediate talismans mixed in.
So he was killed directly with just one strike.
In this person's storage bag, Chu Ning found a bottle containing Blood Fiend Pills, with three pills inside.
In addition, there were some pills, spirit stones, and a decent high-tier magical artifact.
"For infiltrating disciples above the eighth Qi Refining level, the Yin Demon Sect seems to place relatively more importance on them, as they all have Blood Fiend Pills and high-tier magical artifacts."
Chu Ning now made a rough deduction in his mind, and his brows subtly furrowed.
If that were the case, it would indeed be a bit troublesome.
The Blood Fiend Pill's enhancement ability was too strong. That eighth-level Qi Refining cultivator, Yu Jiehui, had already vaguely shown the strength of a perfected Qi Refining cultivator.
As for Xu Runsheng, Chu Ning suspected he had already displayed Foundation Establishment stage strength.
If he and Tan Zhang hadn't each used a mid-grade intermediate talisman to shatter a good portion of Xu Runsheng's blood fiend aura first,
he would have had to expend much more effort to kill the opponent later.
What if, later, there were even more ninth-level Qi Refining Yin Demon Sect disciples, or even perfected Qi Refining cultivators who consumed Blood Fiend Pills?
Thinking of this, Chu Ning's heart trembled. He really had to guard against such a possibility.
While thinking, Chu Ning's actions of taking things out of the storage bag did not stop.
Then, a jade slip caught Chu Ning's attention.
As he took out the jade slip, he subconsciously began to examine its contents.
Then, Chu Ning's mouth slightly opened in surprise.
Recorded within this jade slip was a Yellow-tier high-grade earth-attribute cultivation method called "Kun Yuan Art."
It not only contained cultivation content up to the perfected Qi Refining realm but even included Foundation Establishment cultivation methods.
Considering this person's identity as a disciple of the Transmission Hall, although he had the opportunity to access such cultivation methods, it was surely impossible for him to bring out a cultivation method jade slip.
Naturally, there was only one possibility: this cultivation method was secretly copied by this person.
"As expected, different identities have different resources."
Chu Ning sighed to himself, but he wasn't overly excited about obtaining such a cultivation method jade slip.
He couldn't use an earth-attribute cultivation method right now.
Because his spiritual root aptitude itself wasn't good, even if he did have an earth spiritual root, if he didn't cultivate a cultivation method that matched his system's refreshable talent, Chu Ning's progress simply couldn't be too fast.
In fact, Chu Ning had always had a vague feeling.
That is, when his Verdant Wood Longevity Art cultivation reached perfection, the refreshed talent spirit body would very likely relate to his next stage of cultivation.
However, Chu Ning wasn't sure what exactly it would be.
"This person clearly cultivated a wood-attribute cultivation method, yet for some reason, the copied cultivation method is earth-attribute."
Chu Ning pursed his lips.
If the jade slip contained a copied wood-attribute cultivation method, that would undoubtedly be a huge gain for Chu Ning.
Even though he couldn't use it now, Chu Ning knew it was undoubtedly a good item, so he carefully stored it in his storage bag.
As for the high-tier magical artifact, Chu Ning glanced at it; it was a halberd-shaped artifact.
And it was a water-attribute artifact.
This somewhat surprised Chu Ning; it was the first time he had obtained a water-attribute offensive magical artifact.
After putting away this artifact, Chu Ning picked up the saber that Yu Jiehui, the disciple from the Law Enforcement Hall he had killed, had used.
In Chu Ning's impression, before this person used the Blood Fiend Pill, the attacks launched by this saber seemed to be wood-attribute.
Indeed, when he picked up the long saber and examined it, he found that it was not made of metal.
Instead, it was made from frost spirit bamboo, similar to the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield Chu Ning had used before, and also plated with a layer of silver crystal on the surface.
However, judging from this artifact's high-tier grade, it was clear that the quality of both the frost spirit bamboo and the silver crystal was higher than that of the previous Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield.
Chu Ning also felt a very rich wood-attribute aura within it, similar to the earth spirit crystal.
Chu Ning speculated that wood spirit crystals might have been added during its refinement.
"This magical artifact is quite practical for me."
Chu Ning looked at the artifact engraved with "Silver Frost Saber," a smile appearing on his face.
Besides using the attacks inherent to the artifact itself, what if he used this saber with the Azure Wood Sword Art?
It seemed a bit mismatched, but as long as it could kill enemies, it didn't matter if it matched or not.
Putting away the long saber, Chu Ning looked at Yu Jiehui's other magical artifact, the dark shield that had left a deep impression on him.
Although this dark shield couldn't protect the entire body, its frontal defensive power still greatly interested Chu Ning.
At that time, he had used several methods, but all were blocked by this shield.
"So heavy!"
Taking the shield into his hand, Chu Ning's first feeling was that this thing was extremely thick and extremely heavy.
This shield was actually more than a foot thick, and even heavier than the Black Fiend Ironwood he had held before.
The difference was that this thing was made of metal.
What slightly surprised Chu Ning was that this magical artifact didn't have any very powerful magic formations; only a simple defensive formation was carved on it.
"So this thing's strong defense is because it's thick and heavy, plus its material is hard."
Thinking this, Chu Ning casually picked it up and swung it.
His body refinement had now reached the "Indestructible Bones" stage, so his strength was naturally extraordinary. Even though the shield was not light, he could easily lift it.
"Bang!"
With a sound, a seemingly incredibly hard stone next to Chu Ning was smashed into pieces.
It was Chu Ning's recent swing that accidentally hit the stone.
Watching this scene, Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly.
If he had the Blazing Flame Bracelet and Tian Gang Fist on his right hand, and the Earth Spirit Bracelet and this shield on his left hand, it seemed pretty good.
Nothing else to say, with his current body refinement strength, a single smash with this shield...
What's more, this shield could also defend.
"Seems interesting," Chu Ning murmured to himself, putting the shield away.
He was accumulating more and more magical artifacts; he already had quite a few high-tier ones.
And it wasn't over yet; the short cone Xu Runsheng used to attack him should also be a high-tier magical artifact.
Although it was ultimately blocked by a mid-grade intermediate talisman.
But that was a mid-grade intermediate talisman worth several hundred spirit stones, capable of even blocking the magical attacks of Foundation Establishment cultivators to some extent.
Not everyone could have such talismans on them.
Thinking this, Chu Ning picked up the short cone again.
Upon inspection, it was indeed a high-tier magical artifact, and a metal-attribute offensive artifact.
When Chu Ning injected magic power, the artifact could emit golden magical light, indeed appearing quite powerful.
After examining these magical artifacts, Chu Ning looked at the two's storage bags.
Like the others, they contained some pills and talismans.
Especially Xu Runsheng's storage bag, which had quite a few talismans, including several low-grade intermediate talismans and even two mid-grade intermediate talismans.
Clearly, he hadn't had time to use them.
"Sure enough, talisman crafting is how you earn spirit stones."
Chu Ning mumbled after looking at Xu Runsheng's belongings.
He then looked at the jade bottles containing Blood Fiend Pills from both of them; each only had two pills left.
"Judging by this quantity, these infiltrating disciples above the eighth Qi Refining level should each have three Blood Fiend Pills."
As Chu Ning thought this, he took out the two Blood Fiend Pills he had previously obtained from Duan Yanwu.
He then poured out pills from both types of bottles for comparison, carefully sensing them.
He indeed found that the pills obtained from Xu Runsheng and Yu Jiehui had a more intense blood fiend aura.
Even he, someone not very knowledgeable about pills, could sense it.
"So, the Blood Fiend Pills brought by those who entered the Spirit Domain this time are of higher quality, no wonder they could provide such a large boost."
As Chu Ning thought this, a hint of doubt appeared on his face.
Previously, these Yin Demon Sect disciples, after entering, had always hidden, trying to reach the array formation site.
But this time, they started gathering early, and seemed not to be very afraid of exposing their identities.
Earlier, Xu Runsheng had immediately harbored murderous intent after a slight probe by Tan Zhang.
"Could it be that the Yin Demon Sect has uncovered some secret and now has another plan?"
Although Chu Ning had obtained some information from Duan Yanwu's group before, it was incomplete.
He only knew that the Green Stream Sect arranged so many people to obtain the so-called "spirit seed."
The last time he came, he had tried to learn more about this, but unfortunately, in a place like Yanji Market, the information he could gather was very limited.
Even now, he didn't know what this spirit seed was.
So he was even less clear about whether the Yin Demon Sect had any other plans.
"Forget it, let's take it one step at a time."
Chu Ning categorized and put all the items into his storage bag, then stood up.
After an intense battle, although he had consumed some things, he had gained even more.
Now, he had so many high-tier magical artifacts that he couldn't even use them all.
He also had more life-saving items, naturally giving him more confidence.
Calling Ling Xiaobai back, and having it burrow into his sleeve, Chu Ning continued to walk forward along the direction indicated by the guiding needle.
Along the way, Chu Ning largely followed the direction indicated by the guiding needle.
But occasionally, he would take a detour, which was, of course, because of the little fellow Ling Xiaobai.
This little fellow's perception of spiritual energy was truly keen; as long as there was a slightly richer spiritual energy area nearby, it could immediately detect it.
After entering the area closer to the core, spirit herbs and spiritual plants clearly became more abundant.
For five or six consecutive days, Chu Ning was able to collect some spirit herbs and spirit fruits almost every day under Ling Xiaobai's guidance.
Some of them were quite old; Chu Ning even luckily obtained two spirit herbs that were several hundred years old, which surprised him.
The Green Stream Sect had arranged so many people to enter this Spirit Domain over the past few decades, yet he didn't expect so many spirit herbs to still remain.
However, after thinking about it, he felt it was normal.
After all, most of the people who entered this Spirit Domain should still be advancing according to the guiding needle's direction.
They explored the surrounding areas less, so naturally, many places remained undiscovered.
Of course, the journey wasn't entirely peaceful; Chu Ning encountered spirit beasts a few times along the way.
Among them, there were also first-tier high-grade spirit beasts.
Fortunately, he didn't encounter a group of spirit beasts like before. With his current methods, dealing with these first-tier high-grade spirit beasts didn't require much effort.
What Chu Ning found somewhat strange was that the spiritual energy here was extremely rich, but the elder Mu had said there were no higher-grade spirit beasts in this Spirit Domain.
This actually left Chu Ning a bit puzzled.
Logically, with such rich spiritual energy, second-tier spirit beasts could completely be born here.
While traveling, Chu Ning even cultivated here, and it could even catch up to the effect of cultivating with the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art.
If what Elder Mu said was true, there might be some secrets Chu Ning was unaware of.
This day, Chu Ning was walking on the road, and his puppet bird was circling in the air, scouting the surroundings.
But after only a short while, Chu Ning stopped, then turned and walked in another direction.
This was not the first time he had done this in recent days. Whenever he discovered other cultivators, Chu Ning would often choose to turn and bypass them.
After all, for him, he had no intention of killing people for treasures.
Similarly, he had no intention of traveling with others.
He didn't even bother to distinguish whether those people were just Green Stream Sect disciples or Yin Demon Sect infiltrators.
Rather than that, it was better not to meet them.
After detouring for more than ten li, just as Chu Ning was about to turn back towards the guiding direction.
"Ying!"
Ling Xiaobai in his sleeve suddenly chirped, then poked its small head out of the cuff and chirped towards a certain direction.
"Xiaobai, found something good again?"
Seeing Ling Xiaobai's appearance, Chu Ning asked with a smile.
When Ling Xiaobai nodded, Chu Ning followed the direction Ling Xiaobai indicated.
