# Chapter 61: This Child Must Not Be Allowed to Live!

Upon learning the sorrowful news, Yun Zhiqiu dared not delay and hurried to a quiet room deep within the ancestral residence.

Inside the quiet room, smoke swirled, and a candle lamp flickered, its light seemingly bright at first glance, yet the oil in the lamp was already running low.

The next second, a soft cough echoed from within the mist.

"Zhiqiu, come closer."

As the voice faded, the smoke dispersed, revealing an elderly man seated upright in a chair. He wore luxurious robes, his face was aged, yet his back remained remarkably straight.

Yun Zhiqiu immediately bowed low. "Greetings, Old Ancestor."

"Rise," the Yun Family Old Ancestor said with a faint smile. "There's no need to worry. This is my second reincarnation; I have experience, so I don't foresee any problems."

"It's just a pity that after my reincarnation, it will take at least twenty years before I can hope to return. During that time, there will be no one guarding the family."

"...Zhiqiu deserves death for this sin!"

Yun Zhiqiu grew increasingly despondent. He understood the Old Ancestor's unspoken meaning: Yun Miaozhen, the most outstanding clan member in nearly a century, a true Foundation Establishment seed! Such a proud daughter of heaven had, due to his momentary negligence, died at the hands of a demonic cultivator.

Because of this incident, his prestige within the clan plummeted, and the Yun family, lacking a Foundation Establishment seed, subtly lost much of its influence. For years, Yun Zhiqiu had made countless trips to the Righteous-Demonic Battlefield, hoping to avenge Lü Yang, the demonic cultivator who killed Yun Miaozhen, but he found nothing. After carefully inquiring, he learned that the old scoundrel had actually stayed in the Sacred Sect for sixty whole years! Yun Zhiqiu was so enraged he couldn't help but curse out loud.

"You don't need to blame yourself too much."

The Yun Family Old Ancestor's expression was calm. "Sixty years ago, Skeleton Mountain was a demonic cultivator's scheme, obscuring the heavenly secrets. Ultimately, it was I who failed to foresee it in advance."

"Otherwise, I would never have allowed you and Miaozhen to go to Skeleton Mountain."

"In any case, Miaozhen is dead. Our Yun family must now find another path... So, not long ago, I already accepted the mission entrusted by the Sect Master."

"What!?"

Yun Zhiqiu was shocked to hear this. "The Sect Master's mission? Could it be that he wants to use your reincarnated body, Old Ancestor, to intercept and kill a demonic sect's Foundation Establishment seed?"

Such incidents were not uncommon on the Righteous-Demonic Battlefield.

The Yun Family Old Ancestor nodded upon hearing this. "If I can slay a demonic sect's Foundation Establishment seed, there will undoubtedly be great merit, which can also serve as nourishment for my future cultivation."

"But the Old Ancestor has already reincarnated once..."

For a Foundation Establishment True Person, the first reincarnation would invariably be a chosen one in a million, someone whose karmic fortune no one could shake, and who had the greatest hope of re-ascending to the Foundation Establishment realm. However, a second reincarnation was different. Especially in the past three hundred years, the Yun Family Old Ancestor's cultivation had not significantly improved; he remained in the early Foundation Establishment stage, which added many variables to his reincarnation.

"In life, one must always take a gamble."

The Yun Family Old Ancestor smiled faintly. "The Sect Master recently deduced the cause and effect and discovered that the demonic sect's 'Dharma Refining Secret Realm' has undergone a change, perhaps offering an opportune moment."

"The demonic sect's 'Dharma Refining Secret Realm' prevents hundreds of millions of souls from entering reincarnation. The Sect Master has long been displeased by this. This time, he will not only help me reincarnate and be reborn within it, but will also personally obscure the heavenly secrets for me, ensuring no one can perceive it, and allowing me to awaken my consciousness and memories upon birth, free from the mystery of the womb."

"Thus, I will be able to seize the opportunity to break open the secret realm and allow those living souls to return to reincarnation."

At this point, the Yun Family Old Ancestor also showed a look of anticipation. "If this venture succeeds, it will be a great meritorious deed, and it will also help me regain my Foundation Establishment cultivation..."

"Such a thing exists? This is truly fortunate for our Yun family!"

After listening, Yun Zhiqiu's face finally showed excitement. The most dangerous part of Foundation Establishment reincarnation was the first few years spent in the 'mystery of the womb' stage. However, with the Sect Master's aid, their Old Ancestor would be able to break through the mystery of the womb immediately upon reincarnation! This subtly increased the Old Ancestor's chances of returning to Foundation Establishment significantly. Once the Old Ancestor succeeded, the Yun family could continue its glory for another three hundred years!

Afterward, the Yun Family Old Ancestor meticulously gave further instructions, including how to fake his continued existence after his reincarnation to buy time for his return. This continued until the lamp flame beside them grew dimmer and dimmer, about to extinguish completely, at which point the Yun Family Old Ancestor, still seemingly with much left to say, waved his hand:

"All is ready. You may go now."

Yun Zhiqiu immediately bowed again, respectfully saying, "I wish the Old Ancestor a successful reincarnation and swift return!"

Yun Zhiqiu waited for a moment, but heard no response from the Yun Family Old Ancestor. When he looked up again, the lamp was extinguished, and the Yun Family Old Ancestor had long since lost all signs of life.

It was deep winter, and the world was cloaked in white.

Decades ago, the great chaos across the land had been suppressed because of the emergence of the Heavenly Books, one volume of which was acquired by the Hao Ran Academy, which championed imperial power.

Afterward, the tyrannical emperor of Great Zhou died violently, and a new monarch ascended the throne. Ironically, because too many people had died during the chaos, the population pressure disappeared once peace was restored, resulting in an era of prosperity. The new monarch was thus hailed as the 'Restoration Lord' of Great Zhou.

This could be seen from Tianjing City, the capital of Great Zhou: lost items were not picked up from the roads, and doors were left unlocked at night. Even in the evenings, it was a scene of singing, dancing, and peace.

And in the depths of a mansion in the northeast corner of Tianjing City.

In front of the birthing room, a dignified and solemn man paced anxiously back and forth until a loud cry suddenly echoed from within the room.

"Master! It's born! It's born!"

The next second, the birthing room door opened, and a maid hurried out, announcing loudly, "Congratulations, Master! Your wife has given birth to a boy!"

Upon hearing this, the man burst into laughter, looking up at the sky. "Heaven does not forsake my Wei family! A male heir has finally arrived! Excellent! Everyone receives a reward today!"

The man's name was Wei Tieyi. Twenty years ago, he rose from obscurity, shining brilliantly in the Great Zhou's campaigns to suppress rebellions, achieving glorious military exploits. He was conferred the title of "Marquis of Dingbei" and held considerable renown throughout Tianjing City, considered one of the martial nobles. Now that the Wei family had a new male heir, a grand celebration was naturally in order.

However, at the same time, inside the birthing room.

Although the newborn baby was still crying loudly, no one could detect that a vast soul was currently residing within this frail body.

"It worked..."

The Yun Family Old Ancestor's reincarnation was successful. His original consciousness and memories awakened instantly, yet he did not control the body's instincts. Instead, he sat within his Sea of Consciousness, silently beginning to deduce.

"Great Zhou, Heavenly Books... Heh, so that's it, it's the Sage's Plunder."

In an instant, the Yun Family Old Ancestor had discerned part of the truth. After all, as a Foundation Establishment True Person of the Sword Pavilion, he was no stranger to the various cultivation methods of the Sacred Sect. The Sage's Plunder was an astonishing masterpiece among them, so he naturally wouldn't fail to recognize it.

This was the advantage of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's reincarnation. Even if his cultivation was absent after reincarnation, his powerful soul allowed him to easily deduce cause and effect and manipulate karmic fortune, akin to a dimensionality reduction strike against Qi Condensation cultivators.

However, the Yun Family Old Ancestor soon frowned.

Because when he tried to deduce who was cultivating the Sage's Plunder, there was an emptiness, as if the karmic net had been severed around that person.

"Interesting, a heavenly secret-obscuring spiritual treasure?"

The next second, the Yun Family Old Ancestor's brow relaxed. He had known that after this reincarnation, divination would be extremely important, so he had attached great importance to it. Therefore, he had also brought a heavenly secret spiritual treasure.

"With the 'Sky-Gauging Instrument' bestowed by the Sect Master, no heavenly secret spiritual treasure is useless..."

With a thought, a spherical magical artifact appeared in the Yun Family Old Ancestor's palm. Using it for divination, he instantly broke through the obscured karmic connections.

The next second, the Yun Family Old Ancestor was stunned.

But soon, he couldn't help but laugh uproariously. "Every cause has its effect, every cause has its effect! So that's it, karma truly is an inescapable retribution!"

"Lü Yang...!"

Muttering the name of the one who had killed Yun Miaozhen, the one he had placed high hopes on, yet who had remained at large for sixty years, the Yun Family Old Ancestor's killing intent surged. Especially after activating the 'Sky-Gauging Instrument' and discerning much information about Lü Yang.

"Grand Yin Transformation Corpse Dissolution True Method, Sage's Plunder, Third-Rank True Qi, Heaven's Secrets Thieving Secret Art... If all are achieved, this child has a forty percent chance of breaking through to Foundation Establishment!"

Thinking of this, a cold glint suddenly flashed in the Yun Family Old Ancestor's eyes.

This child must not be allowed to live!
