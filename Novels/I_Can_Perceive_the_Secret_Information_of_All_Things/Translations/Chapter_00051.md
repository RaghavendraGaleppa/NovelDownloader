# Chapter 51: Not Everyone Can Enjoy Such a Night  

One quiet night at Yuanshen Temple, in Xiao Ji's room at the backyard.  

Xiao Ji examined a massive bear gallbladder before storing it away in his pendant. He then counted his spirit stones—three hundred and twenty-six in total, not a single one missing. Finally, he toyed with three zither strings, sensing the profound spiritual fluctuations within them. Though he could comprehend their changes, controlling them was beyond his current abilities—they existed on a level far above him.  

"If I were to refine a Foundation Establishment Pill myself, it's not impossible, but it would take far too much time," Xiao Ji mused, recalling the pill's intricate refinement process.  

Currently, the only material he had was the gallbladder of a first-grade, ninth to twelfth-tier bear demon. The other required ingredients were not only missing but also completely elusive.  

The carnivorous mountain flower spirit, for instance, could only be found in specific regions where it grew. According to records in the Yangliu Town government's archives, this plant existed in the demon lands to the west. While it could occasionally be found within human territories, its growth locations were unpredictable—encountering it in the mountains was purely a matter of luck.  

Then there were the even rarer items: an Earth-grade pill furnace, spirit snake blood, and soul-condensing dew. These were nearly impossible to obtain.  

Oh, and let's not forget the wood demon—specifically needed as fuel for the refining fire.  

Thinking about all this, Xiao Ji felt a headache coming on.  

It was too time-consuming. Just gathering the materials alone would be a monumental task. Xiao Ji decided to abandon the idea of refining the Foundation Establishment Pill himself. "Maybe I should just go to Taigu City and buy one outright… or, perhaps, steal one?"  

Buying was simple in theory, but in reality, it required spirit stones.  

Stealing was also straightforward, but it wasn't that easy either. It required the right timing, location, and opportunity—not to mention a justifiable reason.  

Though he didn’t yet know the price of a Foundation Establishment Pill in Taigu City, judging by the fact that the materials alone cost three hundred low-grade yellow spirit stones, it certainly wouldn’t be cheap.  

No wonder people often said that many cultivation geniuses were surpassed by mediocrities simply because they were poor.  

It seemed this was indeed the case.  

Even if one possessed extraordinary talent, without sufficient financial backing, they would have to rely solely on their own efforts to gather materials for advancement. Meanwhile, those with lesser aptitude could simply buy a Foundation Establishment Pill when they reached the breakthrough point, saving themselves a great deal of time.  

"Unfair," Xiao Ji thought to himself.  

But then he realized that complaining about fairness was hypocritical—his very existence was the greatest unfairness to other cultivators.  

Having resolved to go to Taigu City for the pill, Xiao Ji set aside these frustrating thoughts and wandered around Yuanshen Temple to inspect the premises.

Xiao Ji stepped out of his room and headed to the front courtyard. As he passed by the clothesline, he frowned and called out toward Ying Xiao’s room, "Ying Xiao, no more hanging your undergarments outside! There are two men in this temple, you know."  

Ying Xiao hurried out, draped in her outer robe, and collected the small garments she had washed that day, taking them back inside without a word. She couldn’t be bothered to argue—it was the middle of the night, and she was in the middle of writing her diary, her inspiration flowing freely.  

**[Brother Xiao Ji seems very interested in my undergarments…]**  

Xiao Ji: "…"  

Where was the justice in this?  

Arriving at the front courtyard, Xiao Ji closed and locked the main gate. He glanced at the base of the wall separating the temple from their neighbor, Swiftwind Escort Agency, and found no signs of anyone climbing over. This confirmed that the agency’s chief must have held a meeting forbidding his men from scaling Yuanshen Temple’s walls.  

Some things just required communication.  

After tidying up the main hall, Liu Haizhu approached, wrapped in a cotton Daoist robe. "Good disciple, your master is hungry."  

"Then I’ll make you some noodles," Xiao Ji said, feeling like having a bowl himself.  

"I want meat," Liu Haizhu insisted, clearly craving something heartier.  

"Didn’t you have braised pork bones for dinner?" Xiao Ji recalled his master devouring them eagerly earlier that evening.  

"That was dinner. Isn’t it time for a midnight snack now?" Liu Haizhu lit three sticks of incense and offered them to the temple’s founder. "Besides, who said meals have to be limited to three a day? Even the renowned Dr. Dong in town says elderly folks like me should eat more frequently."  

Xiao Ji relit the lanterns with a firestarter. "He said ‘small, frequent meals.’ You can’t just omit words."  

"Don’t nitpick," Liu Haizhu grumbled. "I remember we bought fresh meat today. Slice it thin, add some greens, tofu, and bean curd sheets—let’s have hot pot. Last time was delicious."  

Xiao Ji wasn’t keen on the hassle so late at night, but if his master wanted it, he’d oblige.  

"Master, chat with the founder for a bit while I prepare the ingredients and firewood," Xiao Ji said, heading to the kitchen in the backyard.  

"Bring the girl along too," Liu Haizhu called after him. "I just remembered a story I want to tell her."  

"Alright," Xiao Ji replied.  

If his master was in the mood for storytelling, he wouldn’t spoil the old man’s fun.  

In Xiao Ji’s eyes, the Third Princess of the Great Li Dynasty was no longer just a future goldmine—she was also a levee against the flood of his master’s tales. Ever since Ying Xiao’s arrival, Liu Haizhu had rarely subjected him to his stories.  

At first, Xiao Ji had actually felt a little lost.  

Ying Xiao joined them in the main hall, sitting by the brazier as the old Daoist recounted a tale from six thousand years ago about moving mountains.  

---  

After cleaning the wooden table in the main hall, Xiao Ji brought out the copper hot pot, firewood, meat, and vegetables. He added the broth base, brought it to a boil, then tossed in potato slices and bean curd sheets before layering in the meat.  

Once the pot was bubbling, he announced, "It’s ready."  

Ying Xiao helped Liu Haizhu to the table. The old man picked up his chopsticks, took two slices of meat, chewed thoughtfully, and delivered his verdict: "Not as good as dragon meat."  

An ordinary night, an ordinary meal.  

Xiao Ji busied himself slicing meat and adding vegetables.  

Liu Haizhu spun his tales, his myths and legends sometimes jumbling timelines—the great demon antagonist started as a roc but later transformed into an earth-burrowing dragon.  

Ying Xiao diligently took notes, afraid of forgetting the most exciting parts…  

After the midnight feast, Liu Haizhu, full and satisfied, performed a set of digestion exercises in the main hall before retiring to his room.  

Ying Xiao returned to her own quarters, eager to continue writing.  

Xiao Ji cleaned up, then opened the main hall doors to air out the lingering scent of hot pot.  

He looked up at the dim night sky.  

**[Great Li Dynasty, spring. The last snow of Longxiang County…]**  

"The last snow lingers longer than before," Xiao Ji sighed.  

Returning to his room, he lay down on his bed.  

An hour later…  

"Someone’s climbing the wall again. I’ll have to have a serious talk with Swiftwind Escort Agency… I need to catch them in the act and drag them before their chief."  

As he lay in bed, scanning the temple with his senses, Xiao Ji suddenly detected another intruder scaling the wall.  

But soon, he noticed something unusual in the information he perceived.  

The situation wasn’t what he’d expected—and something seemed off about the large incense burner in the front courtyard.  

"I misjudged the escort agency," he muttered, getting up and heading to the front courtyard.  

The snow had been falling for some time. The moon was long obscured, leaving the world silent save for the wind.  

A thin layer of snow covered the ground.  

On a night like this, some enjoyed hot pot, while others curled up in warm beds.  

But not everyone could savor such a night.  

Just half an hour earlier…  

Outside Yangliu Town, two figures stood beneath the moonlight—one with a blade, the other with a sword.
