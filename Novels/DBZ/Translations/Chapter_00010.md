# Chapter 10: Qi Refining Third Layer  

Ten days had passed since Wei Qian's last transaction with Bai Fugui.  

Wei Qian compressed all his time outside of work, squeezing out every possible moment for cultivation.  

"The bottleneck I feel when circulating my qi is becoming more and more apparent," Wei Qian murmured as he slowly opened his eyes late at night.  

Without hesitation, he retrieved the vial of Huangya Pills and poured out three pills in one go.  

He decisively swallowed one pill and began refining its medicinal energy.  

"Come on, let's break through to the third layer of Qi Refining in one go!" Wei Qian steeled his resolve.  

As the first pill's energy was nearly refined, he tossed another into his mouth, followed by the third shortly after.  

A tremendous surge of medicinal energy erupted in his abdomen, seeping into every limb and bone.  

Wei Qian frantically circulated the *Hunyuan Gong*, the cultivation technique he practiced, known for its balanced and steady nature.  

At this moment, the technique was pushed to its limits. Every wisp of qi in his dantian was forcibly extracted, suppressing and refining the foreign medicinal energy.  

Wei Qian felt like a boiling teapot—the violent medicinal energy akin to scalding steam, yet the qi surging from his dantian acted as an unyielding lid, pressing down on the rising energy.  

One incense stick's worth of time passed, then two...  

By the time all the medicinal energy had been refined, a vast current of qi roared through his meridians before surging back into his dantian.  

"Now, break through!" Wei Qian bit the tip of his tongue for focus.  

His mind concentrated infinitely, and the mighty tide of qi effortlessly shattered the bottleneck.  

**Qi Refining—Third Layer, achieved!**  

Wei Qian exhaled deeply, only now realizing his back was drenched in cold sweat.  

"I was too tense. The breakthrough actually went very smoothly."  

In hindsight, Wei Qian realized he hadn't needed to be so nervous or push himself so hard.  

But he didn’t regret his earlier caution.  

After all, if he hadn’t prepared thoroughly and failed at the last moment, the loss would have been immense.  

"Now that I’ve broken through to the third layer, the first toxicity enhancement of the *Soul-Severing Nail* is also complete." Wei Qian glanced at the nail artifact still soaking in poison.  

With these two advantages, he felt considerably more at ease.  

Coincidentally, today was also the day he had agreed to meet Bai Fugui, who would be delivering the two high-grade first-tier *Water Barrier Talismans*.  

A high-grade *Water Barrier Talisman* could withstand attacks from a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.  

---

**"Now, I have both offense and defense covered. Even with my third-layer cultivation, I won’t be completely defenseless against a late-stage Qi Refining opponent."**  

"Of course, the best outcome would be if all my preparations—just like those for breaking through to the third layer—turn out to be unnecessary."  

No incidents would be the greatest blessing.  

Wei Qian didn’t share the mindset of *"I’ve prepared everything, now I just need something to happen to test my skills."*  

As time passed, three days before departure, Old Man Li suddenly spoke up while inspecting the spirit fields:  

"So, you’re going to that so-called auction?"  

Wei Qian was taken aback—how did Old Man Li know?  

Then he inwardly scolded himself for forgetting. Hadn’t Elder Li Wanqing explicitly mentioned he would inform Old Man Li?  

"Yes," he replied with a nod. "I didn’t want to go, but Elder Wanqing insisted."  

Old Man Li kept his eyes on the fields as he spoke, "Elder Wanqing mentioned it to me. Can’t be helped—Gu Chen is his only son, and the boy has decent talent. It’s no surprise the elder dotes on him."  

"But the clan will definitely assign a senior to lead the group. You’re just there to assist." Old Man Li finished inspecting the spirit rice and turned around with a chuckle.  

As he walked away, his voice drifted back faintly:  

"Youngsters should use their heads more. Don’t rush to the front."  

"It’s rare to meet a junior I get along with. If you come back safely, at least there’ll be someone to listen to this old man’s ramblings."  

Wei Qian understood the implication immediately.  

This was an enticement—if he returned safely, Old Man Li might pass on his spirit farming techniques!  

"Of course! If I don’t come back, who’ll buy you wine?" Wei Qian laughed in response.  

Old Man Li hummed a tune, swinging his gourd as his figure gradually disappeared into the distance.  

After packing up, Wei Qian first descended the mountain to meet Bai Fugui and collect the two *Water Barrier Talismans*. Only then did he return to Li Wanqing’s cave abode.  

This time, he happened to run into Li Wanqing himself.  

"Oh? You’ve broken through to the third layer." Li Wanqing’s tone held little doubt, only mild surprise.  

The steadiness of Wei Qian’s qi indicated the breakthrough had occurred days ago, not just now.  

Wei Qian replied modestly, "All thanks to the Huangya Pills you provided."  

"Pills are external aids. If one’s foundation is weak, the stronger the external aid, the greater the harm." Li Wanqing responded coolly.  

He then recounted an anecdote:  

Once, a rogue cultivator stumbled upon an ancient cave and found a vial of qi-enhancing pills. After consuming them, his body couldn’t withstand the overwhelming energy and exploded into a mist of blood.  

Later arrivals, unaware of the truth, assumed the pills were poisonous and avoided the area in fear.  

It wasn’t until a Foundation Establishment expert identified the pills that the truth came out—they were meant for Golden Core cultivators. For a mere Qi Refining cultivator to take them? Exploding was inevitable.  

Though Li Wanqing’s expression remained unchanged, inwardly, he was quite pleased with Wei Qian’s rapid progress.  

*"Li Wanlong really isn’t fit to be clan head. He lacks my eye for talent."*  

*"Pity my branch doesn’t have a suitable daughter. A marriage alliance would’ve tied him closer to the Li Clan."*  

Wei Qian, of course, had no idea what Li Wanqing was thinking. As they neared his quarters, he cupped his hands in farewell.  

With three days left before the auction, Wei Qian didn’t waste a single moment, diligently circulating his qi and meditating.  

Even the slightest improvement was worthwhile.  

His greatest hope, however, still lay with the poison-tempered nail artifact.  

On the dawn of departure, Wei Qian withdrew his consciousness from his spiritual sea and immediately retrieved the jar.  

Channeling his qi, the refined nail artifact floated out from the poison-filled container.  

After the tempering, the nail appeared unchanged—except for a fleeting azure glint when it caught the light, sending a chill down one’s spine.  

"Three uses… I hope I won’t need even one." Wei Qian stored the artifact, roused Li Guchen, and the two left the cave together.
