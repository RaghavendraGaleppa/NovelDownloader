# Chapter 2: The Path of Heart Refinement  

For three years, Lin Xuan had suffered from damaged meridians. Each recovery period consumed a great deal of time, and as an ordinary person without a spiritual root, no matter how hard he struggled, he could barely keep up with his fellow disciples. He simply couldn't afford any more delays.  

Carefully controlling the flow of his spiritual energy, Lin Xuan had, through repeated attempts, gained a clear understanding of his meridians' endurance.  

An hour later, the circulation was complete, and the spiritual energy returned from his meridians to his dantian.  

Using his inner vision technique to inspect himself, a shadow of frustration flickered in Lin Xuan's eyes. Despite his relentless efforts, his cultivation had shown no improvement. Logically, completing a major cycle should have resulted in at least a slight increase in spiritual energy.  

It seemed the only option left was the Path of Heart Refinement. Lin Xuan gritted his teeth.  

The Path of Heart Refinement was a unique location within the Piaoyun Valley, discovered three thousand years ago by the sect's founding ancestor. After investigation, it was confirmed to be an ancient relic left behind by cultivators of old.  

It was a peculiar place—once inside, one would be enveloped in illusions. One moment, it felt like traversing a mountain of knives and a sea of flames; the next, it was as if one had fallen into the eighteen layers of hell. Though these illusions caused no real harm, the suffering they inflicted was unbearable. Yet, the benefits were equally evident.  

Despite its terrors, the Path of Heart Refinement was rich in spiritual energy. Cultivating there yielded twice the results with half the effort.  

Moreover, the path was freely accessible to all disciples of the sect. Unfortunately, aside from Foundation Establishment experts, low-level disciples at the Qi Refinement stage dared not attempt it. With their unstable Dao hearts and weak cultivation, they simply couldn't withstand the illusions' onslaught.  

But Lin Xuan had no other choice. He could either remain stuck at his bottleneck or seek a breakthrough on the Path of Heart Refinement. He chose the latter.  

Pushing open the heavy stone door, Lin Xuan stepped out of his training chamber. The sky was already dark, the stars blinking weakly overhead. Yet, he had no intention of resting—his destination was the Path of Heart Refinement.  

At the back of Piaoyun Valley, a slanted passage cut deep into the cliff face, its bottom unseen. This was the Path of Heart Refinement. Standing at the entrance, Lin Xuan took a deep breath and stepped inside.  

For the first hundred meters, there were no illusions, and the density of spiritual energy was no different from the outside world. Still, Lin Xuan remained vigilant. Though this was his first time here, he had heard countless tales of the path's horrors.  

After a few more steps, the surroundings abruptly changed. The concentration of spiritual energy surged—this place was indeed ideal for cultivation.  

Lin Xuan's expression grew solemn. After carefully surveying his surroundings, he cautiously sat down cross-legged.  

**Boom!**  

Flames erupted from the ground, rising several feet high. The temperature around him soared.  

A terrifying scene unfolded, but Lin Xuan merely furrowed his brows, unshaken. He ignored it completely, focusing solely on absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy. Everything on the Path of Heart Refinement was an illusion—there was no need to pay it any mind.  

Yet, though he knew it was false, the sensations felt all too real. Soon, the flames raised the temperature to unbearable levels. Large beads of sweat dripped from Lin Xuan's face.  

Hearing about it was nothing compared to experiencing it firsthand. Previously, Lin Xuan had only listened to Foundation Establishment experts discuss the Path of Heart Refinement, but the reality was far more terrifying than the rumors.  

Before long, the flames licked at his body. At the first layer of Qi Refinement, he couldn't yet conjure a protective barrier. All he could do was grit his teeth and endure.  

Enduring the agony of being burned alive while simultaneously concentrating to absorb spiritual energy was a torment beyond imagination. Yet, through sheer willpower, Lin Xuan persevered.  

The flames scorched his skin, his teeth grinding audibly. The pain eventually dulled into numbness. However, the spiritual energy here was indeed abundant—his absorption rate was several times faster than outside.  

Though an illusion, the experience was akin to true purgatory, tempering Lin Xuan's resolve.  

Absorbing spiritual energy was only the first step. Next, he had to refine it using the sect's secret techniques, a process fraught with losses. Typically, absorbing a hundred units of spiritual energy would only yield a strand as fine as a hair.  

The refined energy then circulated through his meridians before finally settling in his dantian.  

Even for someone with unyielding willpower, completing this process amid flames was near impossible. After five minutes, Lin Xuan reached his limit. He stood and sprinted out at full speed. The moment he left the spiritual energy-rich zone, the fiery illusion vanished.  

"Just as the legends say," Lin Xuan murmured, inspecting his body. There wasn't a single burn, yet the memory of the searing pain remained vivid.  

Though agonizing, it was worth it. The spiritual energy here was not only dense but also exceptionally pure. Cultivating in this environment yielded exponentially better results, greatly increasing his chances of breaking through his bottleneck.  

After resting briefly, Lin Xuan stepped forward again. The flames reappeared, and he endured the burning pain as he resumed absorbing spiritual energy.  

Each time his endurance reached its limit, he would retreat to rest before re-entering the fiery illusion once his strength returned.  

And so, through relentless repetition, Lin Xuan persevered on the Path of Heart Refinement, cultivating with unwavering determination.  

---  

Days passed, and his spiritual energy finally showed signs of growth. Though the gains were meager compared to his efforts, they far surpassed what he could achieve outside.  

At this rate, as long as he persisted, he should be able to reach the second layer of Qi Refinement.  

Calculating his progress, Lin Xuan stood up. He had spent four days on the Path of Heart Refinement—it was time to leave. Not only had his body reached its limit from days of relentless cultivation amid flames, but today was also when the sect's instructors imparted cultivation techniques.  

According to Piaoyun Valley's rules, every four days, a Foundation Establishment expert would guide Qi Refinement disciples. Receiving such guidance could save one from countless detours in cultivation. Naturally, Lin Xuan wouldn't miss this opportunity.  

As he exited the passage, he encountered a Foundation Establishment cultivator—unlike when he had arrived.  

"Elder!"  

"You…" The man studied Lin Xuan, his face filled with astonishment. "You were on the Path of Heart Refinement?"  

"Yes, Elder."  

After they parted, the Foundation Establishment cultivator remained stunned. Though the illusions caused no real harm, the sensations were indistinguishable from reality. For a first-layer Qi Refinement disciple to endure it… this young man's willpower was truly remarkable.  

Cultivation required not only spiritual roots but also an unyielding heart. This disciple named Lin Xuan was certainly someone to watch.
