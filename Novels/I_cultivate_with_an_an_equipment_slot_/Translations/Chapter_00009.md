# Chapter 9: Magical Artifact

"Minor Achievement in Wood Element Technique?"

Upon hearing this, Mu Sen's face froze in surprise.

The surrounding crowd erupted in murmurs.

"How is this possible?"

"It's only been seven days!"

"He's already reached minor achievement in Wood Element Technique? How talented must this guy be?"

The way everyone looked at Zhang Yan changed instantly—filled with envy, astonishment, and curiosity.

Yet, no one doubted the claim.

The reason was simple.

Techniques like this weren't complicated. A quick demonstration would reveal the truth. How could anyone fake it? Unless Zhang Yan wanted to ruin his reputation.

"Show me," Mu Sen said solemnly, his gaze fixed on Zhang Yan.

"Of course!" Zhang Yan replied. "May I borrow a seed?"

He spoke somewhat sheepishly—he was too poor to afford seeds suitable for spellcasting.

"Here." With a flick of his hand, Mu Sen tossed a seed toward Zhang Yan. "This is a semi-spiritual herb. Use Wood Element Technique to accelerate its growth."

"Understood."

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yan channeled his spiritual energy and cast the Wood Element Technique.

The moment he began, Mu Sen knew Zhang Yan had truly reached minor achievement. His movements were far too smooth—nothing like someone who had only practiced for a week. Instead, it seemed as though he had trained for years.

As a verdant glow emanated from Zhang Yan's palm, Mu Sen's eyes brightened. The young man had indeed mastered the technique.

Witnessing the emerald light in Zhang Yan's hand, the onlookers were stunned. Though they had expected it, seeing the proof firsthand left them speechless.

"Excellent, truly excellent!" Mu Sen's eyes widened, his smile uncontrollable. "The rest of you, continue practicing. You—come with me."

He dismissed the others with a wave and beckoned Zhang Yan to follow.

As the two departed, envy filled the eyes of those left behind. It was obvious—Mu Sen had taken a liking to Zhang Yan's talent. For an outer sect Qi Refining disciple to catch the attention of a Foundation Establishment expert? That was a shortcut to greatness.

The thought only deepened their jealousy.

Inside a private chamber, Mu Sen regarded Zhang Yan with a warm expression.

"Your talent in wood-element spells is remarkable."

"Just luck," Zhang Yan replied modestly.

"Don't be so humble. Talent is a blessing. Since you're an outer disciple, what's your spiritual root?"

"Metal, Wood, and Water—three-element roots. My Wood affinity is the strongest, nearing mid-grade," Zhang Yan answered truthfully.

"Lower-grade roots… That's still a bit weak." Mu Sen sighed, but quickly continued, "I intend to recommend you to my master, but your spiritual roots are a limitation. If you can achieve major mastery in Wood Element Technique within three years, I'll take you to meet him and arrange your entry into Wood Spirit Peak."

"Wood Spirit Peak!" Zhang Yan's heart raced.

The Qing Heng Sect divided its disciples into outer, inner, and true disciples. The inner sect was further split into Five Peaks and Thirteen Mountains. Among them, the Five Peaks were overseen by Core Formation elders.

More importantly, joining one would automatically elevate Zhang Yan to inner sect status—a massive leap in benefits.

Normally, entering the inner sect required excelling in the sect's grand competition or mastering a valuable skill. To the sect, only those who could contribute were valued.

Strong combatants could become inner disciples. Those with specialized skills—capable of generating resources—were even more prized. In some ways, skilled artisans were more valuable than fighters.

After all, while martial prowess protected the sect, resources sustained it every single day.

Beyond mines and natural deposits, the sect relied on experts in alchemy, artifact forging, talismans, and formations. Spirit farmers were equally indispensable.

A skilled spirit farmer could ensure bountiful harvests of spiritual rice, accelerate herb growth, and even cultivate rare medicinal plants. The Wood Spirit Peak specialized in precisely this.

Its current master had once nurtured a fourth-grade spiritual herb—rumored to be usable in Nascent Soul-level pills. Though such details were beyond Zhang Yan's reach, joining Wood Spirit Peak would be an incredible opportunity.

As for the three-year deadline? He wasn't worried. Did they think his cheat was for nothing?

"Well? Would you be willing to join Wood Spirit Peak?" Mu Sen asked with a smile.

"Absolutely! Thank you, Elder Mu!" Zhang Yan bowed deeply.

"Don't call me 'Elder.' If you join, I'll be your senior brother. With your talent, major mastery in three years is more than possible. You might as well call me 'Brother Mu' now." Mu Sen was clearly impressed. Given Zhang Yan's progress, success was almost guaranteed—if not certain.

"Then... thank you, Brother Mu." Zhang Yan didn't hesitate to climb the social ladder. A Foundation Establishment expert as a senior brother? That was worth clinging to.

"Now, Junior Brother Zhang, about your reward—aside from Spirit Devouring Flowers and seeds, what else would you like? Pills, talismans, artifacts? Name it." Mu Sen was in high spirits.

"Rewards..." Zhang Yan pondered. "I'd like a magical artifact. A used one would suffice."

"Oh?" Mu Sen's admiration grew. He had offered a new artifact, yet Zhang Yan asked for secondhand. Such restraint and lack of greed spoke volumes about his character.
