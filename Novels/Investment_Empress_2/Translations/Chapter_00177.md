Chapter 177: Xiao Li the Swordsman Astounds the Crowd!

“Uh...”

The burly man lowered his halberd and scratched his head.

“You said there’s a ten thousand gold taels reward for beating you. Is that true?”

“Naturally.”

Li Mo nodded and smiled modestly. “You don’t need to worry about that. Ten thousand gold taels isn’t hard for me to come up with.”

“Alright, that reward is mine!”

The burly man was ecstatic.

He too had just stepped into the first level of the Divine Perception Realm. As a disciple of the Gangdou Sect, he practiced the slow-progress Body Tempering Method, possessing a formidable physical body and a reputation for being exceptionally tough.

“I’ll see what kind of moves he has first.”

Down below, Wu Chushu watched the youth draw his sword with a smile, his expression serious.

He originally didn’t pay much attention to disciples from sects of the Prefecture level, like the Clear Abyss Sect.

However, there was a ‘jewel’ who had appeared before him.

This forced him to take it seriously and observe Li Mo’s style.

This arena was finally getting on the right track.

The martial artists and onlookers below also turned their attention to the stage.

“In the comic book, whenever Jiang Chen is in danger, Liu Wuyan comes to save him.”

“This kid looks pretty good, but how much skill does he actually have?”

“Not a big problem. Brother Li is still holding a sword.”

“What’s the problem with a swordsman holding a sword?”

“Brother, you really haven’t been to the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, have you?”

After the two on the stage exchanged salutes,

Li Mo slowly drew the Chixiao Sword. The small figure in his Dantian glowed brightly, and the divine patterns lit up.

He only activated his own soul intent, without using any other means.

A faint halo of clarity swirled around him.

With a flick of the Chixiao Sword, it was as if a drunkard was holding a branch, stabbing out without any technique. This made many people frown.

For someone with such good looks, his swordsmanship was simply an eyesore.

If he weren’t using a Profound Weapon, it would hardly be called swordsmanship.

Of course, this was only the thought of a portion of the people.

This was Hengyun Sword City, a former holy land of the sword path.

There were plenty of people with keen eyes.

“If I were facing this sword...” Wu Chushu sensed something amiss and began to put himself in the situation.

“It actually carries a hint of the charm from when I observed the Reflection Pearl.”

Huang Donglai, with his ordinary appearance, touched the pearl in his chest, his eyes filled with suspicion.

Zhong Zhenyue, and the elder on the stage, also narrowed their eyes.

However.

Their feelings were not as direct as the burly man’s.

He was currently feeling completely bewildered.

Because that seemingly flawed and unremarkable sword strike was accurate only in that it pointed directly at his opening.

He himself hadn’t even realized before that his starting stance had such a flaw.

What was even more bizarre was that changing his move was useless.

As soon as his technique changed, the sword would follow and point at his new opening.

“Huff... Forget it!”

The burly man decided to stop hesitating. If there’s an opening, so be it!

He would use power to break through technique!

He twisted his halberd, gathering his energy, and thrust forward with a fierce killing intent.

This was one of the advanced martial arts from the Gangdou Sect, a move he practiced a thousand times a day.

It was as fast as thunder, with few variations, but it was concentrated enough.

This was something he learned from Tie Qi.

After Brother Tie Qi returned from the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, he not only recovered from his physical injuries but also elevated his martial arts prowess. He said it was because he had witnessed an incredibly formidable hammer technique, which gave him an epiphany.

This insight was also passed down to him.

Everyone couldn’t help but exclaim at how fierce the halberd technique was.

“It has a bit of the momentum of Ding Lei Ji, and it also incorporates the weapon techniques of the Gangdou Sect. Not bad.”

The youth’s voice made him a bit dazed.

The swordsmanship was even more incomprehensible.

The Chixiao Sword was like an antelope hanging its horns, leaving no trace to follow. With an extremely bizarre angle, it tapped on the weak point of the halberd.

Instantly, the heavy and swift momentum came to a halt.

It was like a long-accumulated dark cloud; thunder had struck, but in the end, no rain fell.

According to the agreement to stop after a touch, this was basically the end. Li Mo did not press the attack.

“You have seven openings.”

“Again!”

After catching his breath, the burly man’s expression turned serious, and he swung his weapon to meet the attack again.

He also held back his strength, focusing on the martial arts.

“Your halberd technique is fierce but not heavy.”

“The real Ding Lei Ji, though it appears swift, is still a path of weight and slowness.”

...

With a sword in hand, the youth was casual and carefree.

While striking out, he pointed out the other’s flaws.

It was still an unstructured sword style, yet he managed to pull it off with an elegant and transcendent air.

The crowd below was stunned.

This was no duel; it was clearly a lesson.

Just moments ago, they had thought the youth’s swordsmanship was crude because it didn’t have any earth-shattering movements. It followed the path of returning to simplicity. Their vision was limited, so they couldn’t understand the profound mystery within.

After all, the burly man’s level was considered mid-tier even at this summit.

Yet in front of Li Mo, he had no power to fight back head-on.

“Brother Li... is really... really amazing.”

Jiang Chulong hugged her peach blossom branch, her little heart beating fast.

The essence of this swordsmanship resonated with her as well, making her feel a sense of kinship.

It seemed to have a similar effect to when her teacher instructed her on the Wild Grass Sword Manual...

“Tai Yin...”

Ying Bing looked at the youth’s sword-wielding figure, a little lost in thought.

She had known this sword style for a long time.

What made her distracted was that familiar aura.

Why would his soul intent contain the divine essence of Tai Yin?

She knew him very well from their time together. Besides the divine intent he observed, what else could it be?

Could it be that the System judged her combat power to be below Li Mo’s because of the divine intent?

But that makes it even stranger!

How could Li Mo observe Tai Yin?!

...

On the high platform.

“The Sword-Playing Art of Tianshan Sword Manor?”

“No, I have experienced the Sword-Playing Art, and it is definitely not like this.”

“He is walking the path of technique approaching the Dao?”

“This...”

The white-haired, grey-bearded sword city elders did not slam the table this time, even though they had already replaced the new one.

Besides their astonishment, they felt more complex emotions.

It was the path of exhausting the principles of the sword path.

Which of the elders present was not a sword prodigy in their youth? Which of them was not a brilliant genius who suppressed all others with their sword?

However, this path, the more talented one is, the more despair one feels.

The more one knows, the more one realizes one’s own ignorance.

Although the Immortal path is ethereal, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands did exist in the past.

But the path of technique approaching the Dao has never been fully walked.

“By the way.”

“Hmm?”

“What is going on with the Clear Abyss Sect? Did their ancestral grave emit auspicious smoke?”

...

The sparring on the stage, or rather the lesson, was now nearing its end.

The burly man withdrew his halberd and bowed solemnly.

“Thank you for your guidance. I have benefited greatly!”

“It was a随手之劳 (shǒu zhī láo - a随手之劳 means a task that is easily done, a small favor). I didn’t lose anything either.”

Li Mo cupped his sword in a modest salute.

While guiding the other, he had also incorporated the other’s style into his own, transforming it into something of his own through the Nine Swords of Dugu.

Hmm... this step also cost him martial arts insight.

When accumulation reaches a certain level, it is time to make further progress!

Who benefited more, it’s really hard to say.

“Take it.”

Li Mo took out a gold bill as promised.

“No, no, I have received the benefit of your teaching, how can I...”

“A promise is a promise. This bit of money is nothing.”

“This...”

The burly man looked at the youth’s smile and his demeanor, then recalled his senior brother’s description of a certain person.

Handsome and elegant, treating money like dirt, helping others without holding back...

“Could you be from the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm...”

“Shh, I am a swordsman now.”

“Big Brother, please accept a bow from me!”

...

Not far away.

Wu Chushu wiped the sweat from his forehead.

He then looked at Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu.
