# Chapter 186: Trial of the Heart

"Follow me, both of you!" After waiting for about an hour, a Foundation Establishment cultivator emerged, glanced at the two of them, and said sternly.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator didn't use any spells or magical tools, simply walking ahead, forcing Li Yuanba and the young man to follow on foot.

"Before formal entry into the sect, you are forbidden from using any spells or magical tools within the mountain gates, from leaving designated areas, or from engaging in conflicts. Violators will be executed!" the Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Netherworld Sect said indifferently.

The journey lasted about two hours before they arrived at a simple dwelling at the foot of the mountain, not even reaching the twelve peaks.

"This is where you'll stay. Sect entry procedures will be conducted in ten days." After delivering this instruction, the Netherworld Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivator left.

Li Yuanba approached the dwelling—a large room spanning about 300 square meters, seemingly spacious. However, it was already occupied by numerous cultivators. Counting himself, there were thirty-eight in total. Most were Foundation Establishment cultivators, including the young man from earlier, with only a few Qi Refining cultivators among them.

Li Yuanba realized that the Netherworld Tokens might not be as rare as he thought, given that every cultivator present possessed one.

"Hey, fresh meat!" a sharp-faced Foundation Establishment cultivator remarked with a laugh.

Ignoring him, Li Yuanba found a spot to sit. The room lacked any furniture, but cultivators' robust physiques and ability to substitute sleep with meditation made the conditions bearable.

His bronze mask and sharp aura deterred the sharp-faced cultivator from further comments, who then turned his attention to the one-armed youth.

Losing a limb wasn't a severe injury for cultivators—it could be regenerated with a pill of equivalent grade. However, such pills were valuable, and the newly grown limb would take considerable time to match the original's functionality, significantly delaying cultivation progress. Missing a limb also impaired the efficiency of primary cultivation techniques, as they required spiritual energy to circulate throughout the body, and the absence of a limb created a deficiency.

"You must've had a rough time being hunted. I have a Second-Grade Limb Regeneration Pill. Just transfer your first 500 contribution points to me after joining the sect," the sharp-faced cultivator offered the youth with a smile.

Li Yuanba now understood the man's motive—exploiting new disciples' benefits.

"No need," the youth replied coldly, casting another resentful glance at Li Yuanba. Unlike Li Yuanba, who was left alone, he had been targeted, yet he blamed others rather than reflecting on himself.

Failing to make a deal, the sharp-faced cultivator retreated to his spot.

Over the next ten days, more cultivators arrived, swelling their numbers to forty-eight.

At noon on the tenth day, an oppressive aura enveloped the room as a golden-robed Core Formation cultivator appeared outside.

The forty-eight cultivators hurried out and bowed.

"You hold Netherworld Tokens. Regardless of your past identities, passing the Trial of the Heart will make you disciples of the Netherworld Sect," the Core Formation cultivator stated without introducing himself, accustomed to the varied motives of token holders.

At the mention of the trial, hesitation flickered in some eyes, but retreat was no longer an option—this was the Netherworld Sect, one of the most notorious demonic sects in the Northern Shu Continent.

With a wave of his hand, the Core Formation cultivator summoned a medium-sized flying vessel. Forbidden from using spells or tools, the cultivators boarded by leaping aboard.

The vessel swiftly transported them to a palace inscribed with "Heavenly Demon Hall."

"Enter," the Core Formation cultivator commanded.

Inside, the hall was lined with hundreds of stone steles, eerie and unsettling. Glancing upward, Li Yuanba saw shadowy figures drifting among clouds, occasionally revealing faces with nothing but pitch-black eyes that chilled the soul. He averted his gaze just in time, but others weren't as quick.

"That's the Heavenly Demon Portrait. Keep staring if you want to die," the Core Formation cultivator warned, his voice snapping entranced cultivators back to reality—except for three who collapsed lifeless.

"Stand before a stele," he ordered.

Each cultivator took position before a stele carved with an eyeless, faceless humanoid figure exuding dread.

"Trial of Sincerity," the Core Formation cultivator announced.

Light shimmered on the steles, animating the faceless figures. Li Yuanba reflected on his reasons for joining—seeking resources and knowledge, with no ill will toward the sect. His stele's glow faded peacefully, but screams erupted as others had their souls dragged into their steles.

"Trial of Resolve," the Core Formation cultivator continued, now slightly pleased.

Li Yuanba found himself in an illusionary palace surrounded by luxury and power. Yet, his dual consciousness with Li Shiming allowed him to perceive it as mere theater, easily breaking free. More cultivators succumbed, their souls claimed.

"Swear the Heavenly Demon Oath," the Core Formation cultivator commanded. "Join the Netherworld Sect, never betray it. Let the Heavenly Demon witness this vow!"

Upon swearing, Li Yuanba felt his soul marked by an otherworldly presence—betrayal would summon retribution unless he could defy the Heavenly Demon's grasp.

Only six survivors remained, including the one-armed youth and a Qi Refining cultivator—proof the trial tested spirit over strength.

"Well done. I am Elder Lü of the Outer Sect. You six are now disciples," Elder Lü said warmly, contrasting the hall littered with corpses.

As they flew to the sect proper, Elder Lü warned, "Disclose the trial's details, and you'll face the consequences of betrayal."

Li Yuanba marveled at the sect's ruthless efficiency in filtering out spies and the weak.

At the Outer Sect's main peak, Elder Lü processed them one by one. When Li Yuanba's turn came, Elder Lü asked, "State your expertise for assignment."

"I excel only in combat. I am a sword cultivator," Li Yuanba replied.

After a probing scan—which Li Yuanba permitted—Elder Lü was astonished. "Metal-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root, formidable body refinement, sword intent mastery... Were it not for your passing the trial, I'd suspect you were planted by another major sect."

Heavenly Spiritual Roots were rare treasures, fiercely contested even within the sect's own ranks due to their value in crafting powerful undead. Few survived to join openly.

Li Yuanba's cultivation path—tailored as if by a major sect—only deepened Elder Lü's intrigue. Here was a prodigy, forged through trials, now bound to the Netherworld Sect's dark embrace.
