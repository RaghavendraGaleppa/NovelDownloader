# Chapter 90: A Dragon Maiden Hidden Within the Cave Heaven! The Ancient Moon's Unwilling Heart at Death's Door!

The Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven had been severely damaged in the battle three days prior. 

The accumulated golden pool of magma, which should have restored the cave heaven through spiritual energy reflux, had been exhausted—first by the Debt Collector to replenish his mana, and finally by Li Zhengjing to demonstrate his fate-altering technique. 

For this cave heaven to recover its former vitality would take at least another hundred years. 

The previous battle had turned the world upside down. Amid the ruined earth, the Five Elements Creation Tree discovered a person embedded within the stone.

Guided by the tree, Li Zhengjing gripped the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, swallowed the remnant jade, and consumed several spirit stones.

"Just ahead!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing took a deep breath and stepped forward. 

After slaying the Debt Collector, the cave heaven lay in ruins. No one had come to investigate, and even he himself had only thought of leaving as soon as possible. 

Had it not been for the Five Elements Creation Tree, no one would have discovered the bizarre secret hidden beneath the earth. 

Was this left behind by the Debt Collector? Or was it originally part of the cave heaven?

Over a hundred mana dragons coiled around him as he refined the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, peering ahead.

Embedded in the rock wall was a broken, round stone. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a fragment of Celestial Domain Divine Stone!

"It's because it was a Celestial Domain Divine Stone that I struck it. Who knew there'd be someone inside?" 

The Five Elements Creation Tree explained, "I hit it from the left. Master, take a look from that side."

Li Zhengjing moved to the left and saw that the stone had indeed been cracked open, revealing half of a delicate, youthful face. 

It appeared to be a girl, about four or five years old, with skin as smooth as jade and delicate features, giving her an innocent appearance.

"Master, she's asleep again. Don't wake her, or there'll be trouble."

"Not a monkey!"

Disappointed, Li Zhengjing stepped closer for a better look.

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice chimed in, "She has a flesh-and-blood body, not formed from the Celestial Domain Divine Stone. The stone seems to have been protecting her."

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Who is she? To use a Celestial Domain Divine Stone to protect her—that's no small feat."

Since the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven had been under the Debt Collector's control, this girl's origins must be extraordinary!

Focusing his mind on the golden page, he examined her details:

**Name:** New Star  
**Age:** None  
**Cultivation:** None  
**Identity:** None  
**Fate:** ...Insufficient spiritual energy!

"What?"

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted. "This girl's cultivation surpasses mine? And... why isn't there any indication of how many spirit stones are needed this time?"

Just then, as if sensing a stranger's presence, the girl in the stone opened her eyes—clear and bright, with distinct black and white pupils.

"..."

The atmosphere froze for a moment.

Then, tears welled up in the girl's eyes as she let out a wail.

**Boom!**

Li Zhengjing's vision blurred, as if his soul had been scattered by the Debt Collector's artifact once more!

"Don't cry!"

Yuan Zhengfeng, being a Human Immortal, remained clear-headed and quickly shouted through Li Zhengjing's body, "We're good people!"

The booming voice jolted Li Zhengjing back to his senses. He stumbled back, his heart still pounding.

Though the girl's cry wasn't as terrifying as the Debt Collector's artifact, it still left him deeply shaken.

The girl's gaze then settled on Li Zhengjing. 

Her eyes blinked, and a single tear rolled down her cheek.

**Ding!**

The tear crystallized into a pearl-like droplet, shimmering and translucent.

"Ha yi li xi!" she suddenly spoke, her voice crisp.

"What the—?"

Li Zhengjing was baffled.

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches excitedly. "She stopped crying, Master! She stopped crying when she saw you! That sounded like ancient language. Does she want to adopt you as her godfather?"

Li Zhengjing was stunned.

"Don't listen to its nonsense!" Yuan Zhengfeng interjected. "This girl's cultivation is extremely high—she's already formed a Yin Spirit. Though the language is archaic, you can sense her intent through her aura!"

Focusing, Li Zhengjing attuned himself to her energy and understood her words.

"Your aura is so evil!"

"Nonsense! I'm a proper disciple of an immortal sect, renowned for my virtuous and benevolent character!" Li Zhengjing retorted angrily.

"Now you're a proper immortal sect traitor," Yuan Zhengfeng corrected dryly, unable to let the inaccuracy slide.

"Are you here to kill me?" The girl's tears dried, replaced by defiance.

"Why would I kill you?" Li Zhengjing sighed. "Who are you? Why were you inside the Celestial Domain Divine Stone? What's your connection to the Debt Collector?"

"I don't know," the girl replied softly. "My homeland lost hope. My people built a ship, but a storm capsized it, and I fell..."

"Then my father jumped after me. He protected me until we landed. He was so happy—he said this was the only pure land, yet also the most sinful."

"Later, he hid me in our clan's divine stone. He said he would seek the source of evil, cleanse this land of sin, and make it truly pure."

Her words were tinged with confusion, as if her youth left many things unclear.

Li Zhengjing and Yuan Zhengfeng fell silent. 

Her story was cryptic but hinted at profound secrets—though she herself seemed unaware of them.

Further questioning revealed she knew little else—not her homeland's location, her father's whereabouts, or how long she had slept.

"She's a bit slow," the Five Elements Creation Tree remarked. "Even my second son is smarter than her."

"Ying..." The Wave-Severing Gu let out a soft cry in agreement.

"We're not getting anything useful," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "What do we do with her?"

"She's so young, yet her cultivation is extraordinary. Her origins are mysterious, and her father's fate is unknown. Taking her with us might bring trouble." Li Zhengjing hesitated.

"True. She doesn't seem helpful. Despite her power, she's just a child—useless in a fight. Best leave her here."

"Let's go."

As Li Zhengjing turned to leave, the round stone shattered.

The little girl tumbled out and clung to his leg.

"A li o a li!"

"What's she saying?" The Five Elements Creation Tree was baffled. "Eldest Son, explain to your father."

"Partners!" Yuan Zhengfeng translated. "She wants to come with us."

"Why?"

Li Zhengjing looked down at the girl and noticed something odd—tiny deer-like antlers on her head. 

Peering further, he spotted a fish-like tail peeking from under her skirt.

A dragon maiden?

So the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven truly once housed a fallen dragon?

"Take me with you!" The dragon girl blinked, speaking in archaic tones.

"You called me evil," Li Zhengjing said. "Go if you want, but don't follow me."

"Your aura is evil, but you're not the source. If I stay with you, I'll find it."

"What is the source of evil?"

"I don't know."

"..."

Li Zhengjing sighed. "I can barely protect myself, let alone take you in. Besides—"

Just then, the Five Elements Creation Tree gasped. 

"Master, look! Her tears—they contain spiritual energy! Aren't these just like spirit stones?"

"..."

Li Zhengjing inhaled sharply. "Leaving a little girl alone underground... I couldn't bear it."

The tree waved its branches. "Exactly! Our master is kind and virtuous. He cherishes all life—trees, insects, even that bird that kept asking for death. He never once thought of roasting it for supper! Such boundless compassion!"

Yuan Zhengfeng remained silent, offering no comment.

Li Zhengjing pocketed the crystallized tear, satisfied. 

He already nurtured the Five Elements Creation Tree for its spiritual energy and future medicinal fruits, occasionally steeping its roots for tea to aid cultivation. 

The Wave-Severing Gu's venom also brimmed with spiritual energy, akin to spirit stones. 

As a righteous man with a heart full of love, what harm was there in adopting a dragon girl?

He slung the Wutong Wooden Case onto his back, stuffing the tree inside. But when he tried to tuck the girl in, she shook her head vehemently.

"Fine, walk on your own."

Ignoring her, he returned to the surface, surveying the ruined cave heaven. 

"Such devastation. But in a hundred years, it'll recover."

Any faction would covet such a cave heaven. Once controlled by the Debt Collector, it now belonged to Li Zhengjing.

"Master, now that you've left the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, you'll need a foundation—whether to establish your own sect or expand your lineage," the tree said. "This place shouldn't be given away."

"But I don't know enough formations to seal it properly."

Li Zhengjing pondered, then said, "Then I'll leave a marker, so future visitors know this is my territory."

He carved words into a rock but paused mid-way when Yuan Zhengfeng spoke.

"Outside the cave heaven—familiar aura. Someone from the Ancient Moon Peak."

"What?"

Li Zhengjing's gaze sharpened. He swallowed the remnant jade and gripped his saber. "Tree, finish the engraving."

With that, he shot into the sky on streams of mana, heading south.

The cave heaven's exit lay in the void ahead. Stepping through, he returned to the mortal realm.

Glancing back, he marveled at the cave heaven—nestled within the cliffs, a world unto itself. 

But there was no time to admire it. Following the aura, he sped onward.

Within moments, he spotted a figure—a middle-aged man missing an arm, a gaping wound in his abdomen, stumbling toward him.

"The Chief of the Enforcement Hall!"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was heavy. 

Back when he served in the Enforcement Hall, this Chief had supported his impartial judgments. 

Years later, the Chief remained at the Qi Refinement realm, never breaking through to Human Immortal. 

Now, with such injuries, death was near.

Li Zhengjing descended, landing ten paces away, frowning.

"Li Zhengjing, I was sent by the Peak Master to find you."

The Enforcement Chief, pale-faced, collapsed upon seeing him. "The Peak Master has been expelled from the sect. The entire world hunts him now. Yesterday, Elder Chen Zhu of the Inner Sect broke through to Human Immortal and has been named the new Ancient Moon Peak Master!"

"Chen Zhu?"

Li Zhengjing fell silent. Yuan Zhengfeng said nothing.

Who would have thought the once-mighty Ancient Moon Peak Master would meet such an end? That Chen Zhu, long suppressed by him, would so easily take his place?

"We were preparing to clear your name, but with the Peak Master's fall and Chen Zhu's ascension, even if exonerated, you can't return to Ancient Moon Peak."

"..."

Both Li Zhengjing and Yuan Zhengfeng had deep grudges with the Chen Clan. Even without the Ling Mine accusations, staying on Ancient Moon Peak was untenable.

"The Peak Master faced the Debt Collector expecting to die. He prepared for Chen Zhu's succession, even lending him the Main Peak's Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed to break through to Human Immortal."

The Enforcement Chief sighed. "Using your hand to cripple the Chen Clan's pillars ensured Chen Zhu wouldn't favor his kin once in power. Over time, the Chen Clan would just be ordinary members of Ancient Moon Peak..."

His voice grew weaker, his gaze distant.

"Who did this?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked suddenly.

"I knew too much. I'd threatened Chen Zhu. With his new position, silencing me was inevitable. The Peak Master had arranged an escape for me, but I refused, believing he'd return alive... Now I'm dying."

The Chief pulled out a bronze mirror. "The Peak Master is fading. His lifespan won't last a hundred days..."

Li Zhengjing took the mirror. A light flickered, revealing a gaunt, aged face.

The Ancient Moon Peak Master was no longer the immortal sage of old—now a withered candle on the verge of extinguishing.

"Pathetic, isn't it?"

The Peak Master's voice was laced with self-mockery.

"..."

Li Zhengjing stayed silent.

The Peak Master sighed. "Countless schemes, meticulous planning—this final battle nearly wiped us out. We barely won thanks to you. Yet the Debt Collector was just a pawn, and we mere pieces on a board. Our opponent never even showed himself. How laughable."

Li Zhengjing paused. "The three of you returned to the sect with the Debt Collector's artifact and the bodies of Elder Gu and the former Sect Master. Yet only you remain... He never appeared?"

The Peak Master sighed. "He's even more unfathomable than the Debt Collector. To this day, I don't know who he is... and now, I won't live to find out."

"Can't the Debt Collector's artifact preserve your soul?"

The Peak Master shook his head. "I thought the Debt Collector was the mastermind behind it all. But he was just a disposable pawn. Now that I'm exposed, I've become one too."

His clouded eyes dimmed further. "Before slaying the Debt Collector, I was ready to die. If I failed, so be it. If I succeeded, I'd stand above the heavens... Yet now, victory has only hastened my end."

"I've never been righteous. I've schemed, killed, and colluded with the Debt Collector. I shielded the Venomous King Xin Xuan, sacrificing tens of thousands in Four-Leaf City without remorse."

"But now, at death's door, I can't accept it."

"Such a formidable foe, hidden in the shadows—I, who prided myself on my intellect, was played like a fool."

"Had I known of him, I would've moved cautiously, biding my time for a future reckoning."

"But it's too late. The Debt Collector's artifact only binds me to him—it won't save me."

After a long pause, the Peak Master said gravely, "You're different. He won't move against you yet. You have time to grow. You're young, untested—but that's your advantage. You can still become stronger."

Li Zhengjing said quietly, "He won't let me grow enough to threaten him. Elder Yuan Zhengfeng's fate is proof."

"There's a way to buy you more time," the Peak Master said. "I'm unwilling to die like this, so I place my hopes in you."

His aged eyes gleamed with complex emotions. "I have less than a hundred days. In that time, I'll use a secret art to regain my prime... and seek him out. I'll die by his hand."

Li Zhengjing stayed silent. Yuan Zhengfeng said nothing. The Enforcement Chief's eyes brimmed with sorrow.

The once-proud Ancient Moon Peak Master, who dared to scheme against the legendary Debt Collector, now sought only death.

His past grandeur made his current desolation all the more poignant.

The Peak Master continued, "He lurks in the shadows. But I've grasped a clue. When I die, I'll drag him into the light."

"I can't kill him, but I can make you see him clearly."

"I'll stake my life to expose his weaknesses. Know your enemy to defeat him."

"You're exceptional. In less than a year, you've achieved so much. Given time, you can rival him."

"On the Sky Soaring Ship, you once said, 'The setting sun is beautiful, yet dusk is near.' But even dusk can briefly prolong the day."

The Peak Master chuckled bitterly. "Keep the mirror. In a hundred days, I'll arrange everything. Before I die, it will warn you. Then, take what I leave you."

"Also, the Soul-Severing Whip was taken. If you see it again, beware its wielder."

Lastly, he murmured, "Bury my old friend before you."

Li Zhengjing looked up. The Enforcement Chief had already passed.

Sighing, Li Zhengjing pocketed the mirror. "Understood."

The light in the mirror faded.

Li Zhengjing carried the Chief's body to a scenic spot, buried him, and carved a tombstone with his saber.

**Here Lies the Chief of the Ancient Moon Peak Enforcement Hall.**

Once finished, the Five Elements Creation Tree arrived with the dragon girl.

"Master, the engraving is done. Anyone who stumbles into the cave heaven will know it's yours."

"Good."

Li Zhengjing shouldered the Wutong Wooden Case. "Time to find Hanging Wall."

The tree paused, its branches freezing as if studying the tombstone.

"What's wrong?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"Nothing. Just... I've seen him a few times. Never thought he'd die here."

"Let's go. Find Hanging Wall."

With the dragon girl in tow, the group headed southwest.

Hanging Wall had been waiting six hundred li southwest of the cave heaven.

But half a day after Li Zhengjing left, two Qi Refinement elders arrived.

"Days ago, the energy fluctuations here were intense. There must be treasure!"

"Search quickly. Our sect is closest. Delay, and others may come."

"Brother, look at that rock face—it seems unusual."

"Is that a cave heaven?"

"All cave heavens in Central Continent belong to sects, temples, the imperial court, or mighty experts. We must be cautious..."

"Brother, look at this stele..."

"It seems this cave heaven once had an owner but is now abandoned. Let's pay respects."

The two bowed to the stele, which read:

**Li Zhengjing's Cave Heaven**  
*(Erected by Grandson A-Shu)*

"Li Zhengjing? Never heard of such a senior."

"Regardless, showing respect is proper. If our sect claims this cave heaven, we inherit his legacy."

They kowtowed thrice, then rose, eyes alight with greed.

Though ruined, the cave heaven would recover—a priceless asset for their sect.

Then a voice spoke behind them.

"This cave heaven isn't for minor sects. Leave."

Startled, they turned—only to be flung out of the cave heaven.

"Set foot within thirty li again, and you die."

Terrified, the duo fled.

Inside, the one who expelled them was a stern-faced middle-aged man.

"Divine Emissary!"

The man bowed toward the cave heaven's depths. "I drove away the intruders. I was overjoyed about securing our clan's refuge and let them slip in. Forgive me."

"No matter. It's natural to rejoice over our survival."

From the shadows emerged a slender youth—the counterfeit medicine peddler.

Had Li Zhengjing been present, he'd have recognized him instantly.

"Divine Emissary, you said a falling star would destroy our homeland in a month. Finding this refuge is a relief. I couldn't contain my joy."

The man kowtowed. Though the youth was weak, he dared not slight him—for this was the only envoy to the Eastern Peak Divine Monarch.

"Go. Bring your clan here. This shall be your home."

"I'll fetch the divine idol first, to sanctify the cave heaven."

"Your dedication is noted."

The peddler waved him off, then muttered, "Senior Brother Li, I didn't misplace my faith in you. Selling you goods at a loss paid off. Your battle cleared this cave heaven for my followers, solving my urgent need."

He eyed the stele, its words grating. With a punch, he shattered it—then winced, clutching his swollen hand.

"Who erects a stele like they're already dead? If you really die, I won't bother with one!"

Grumbling, he folded a paper crane and breathed into it.

The crane fluttered away.

"Consider this cave heaven rented. The message in this crane covers the fee. You're not losing out."

Clutching his aching hand, he scowled. "Erecting your own tombstone... how tasteless."
