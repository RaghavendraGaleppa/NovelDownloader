# Chapter 63: Third Layer

In the study, Li Shiming took out a low-grade longsword magical artifact that he had obtained from Shi Ximing's storage bag. 

This low-grade longsword was currently the only magical artifact he could openly display. The Hao family cultivators had provided him with several magical artifacts, but those all bore the Hao family's insignia. At least within the Central Capital region, he wouldn't risk exposing these artifacts.

Recalling the contents of the 'Dragon Painting and Eye-Dotting Technique' in his mind, Li Shiming noted that as an official inheritance, it came with detailed explanations that spared him from having to figure everything out himself.

His fingers shimmered with spiritual energy as he flicked them against the sword's spine. The low-grade longsword trembled slightly, revealing faint glimpses of the hidden runic array patterns within.

"Dragon Painting!" Li Shiming chanted softly. His fingers traced along the emerging runic patterns, infusing them with spiritual energy that made the previously faint designs grow clearer.

Following the technique's mantra, Li Shiming circulated his spiritual energy while focusing intently on the runic patterns. Though he had no prior knowledge of runic arrays, under the influence of the technique, a bright spot appeared among the patterns.

"Eye-Dotting!" He pressed his finger against the bright spot, imprinting it with a fragment of his consciousness.

Gradually, the runic patterns dissipated, leaving the sword seemingly unchanged. Yet Li Shiming could sense a faint connection between himself and the weapon. 

Though the bond was weak—this being his first attempt—he knew repeated applications of the technique would strengthen his connection with the sword.

"Flaming Sword, you're mine now," he murmured, having learned the artifact's name through their newly formed link.

Holding the Flaming Sword now felt entirely different. Previously, when he'd used it to kill a martial expert, he'd relied solely on a cultivator's reflexes, wielding it no differently than a mortal would. Now, he could feel the sword's true nature.

Channeling spiritual energy into the blade, flames of spiritual power erupted along its length—a basic function of the Flaming Sword. The intensity of these flames depended on the amount of spiritual energy he provided, though as a low-grade artifact, it had an upper limit to its power.

However, at the second layer of Qi Refining, even pouring all his spiritual energy into the sword couldn't unleash its full potential.

With a sweep of his left hand across his storage pouch, a 'Primary Object Control Talisman' appeared. Activating it, a spiritual hand formed and grasped the Flaming Sword. 

Though his control technique remained at its previous level, the spiritual hand could now suspend the sword mid-air thanks to their connection, which seemed to reduce the weapon's effective weight. 

Yet when he attempted to maneuver the sword, a wave of exhaustion washed over him, and the blade clattered to the ground. Clearly, freely controlling the Flaming Sword would require a deeper connection.

The attempt had also drained most of his spiritual energy, teaching him not to overreach his current capabilities. 

He abandoned thoughts of attempting the technique on the high-grade wooden sword artifact—at least until his cultivation advanced further.

"I wonder when I'll get my hands on a jade slip to study," Li Shiming mused, thinking of the cultivation world's equivalent to USB drives—except these could directly transmit information to the brain. Studying one might allow him to develop new storage methods for his IBMz15.

After casting 'Gentle Breeze and Nourishing Rain Technique' twice that day, his spiritual energy dropped to dangerously low levels—barely enough to activate talismans. Only the knowledge that the corpse-refining cultivator had been eliminated, making the city temporarily safe, allowed him to risk using the technique.

Come nightfall, he returned to his bedroom and moved the bed aside, revealing a hidden entrance. After descending, he repositioned the bed to conceal the passage.

The underground chamber wasn't part of the original courtyard—Li Shiming had excavated it himself. The earth helped mask the spiritual fluctuations from his Spirit Gathering Plate.

Retrieving the plate from his dimensional pocket, he waited for the chamber's spiritual energy concentration to increase. As he watched, he reflected on his good fortune.

During his time in the Central Capital, he'd heard other cultivators speak of Spirit Gathering Plates with undisguised envy—these were treasures normally only wealthy sect disciples at late Qi Refining stages could afford. He still didn't know how Junior Sister Zheng from the Tianhai Sect had obtained one at the mid-Qi Refining stage.

This realization also made him suspect his spiritual roots and talents might not be as exceptional as he'd thought. Having such a treasure at the early Qi Refining stage naturally accelerated his progress, making him even more cautious about exposing it.

When the chamber's energy concentration reached optimal levels, Li Shiming sat above the Spirit Gathering Plate and activated the 'Five Elements Absorption Technique'. His depleted spiritual vortex hungrily drew in the gathered energy.

Perhaps due to studying the 'Dragon Painting and Eye-Dotting Technique', today's cultivation brought deeper insights into spiritual energy. As he circulated his technique, he could clearly perceive certain energy pathways within the vortex.

"This energy flow would be more efficient if adjusted like this," he realized, and astonishingly, the strand of energy responded to his thoughts, altering its path accordingly.

"Indeed, that's better," he mused, instinctively optimizing more energy pathways. Though he only adjusted ten out of countless strands, the effects were noticeable—the vortex's rotation speed increased, enhancing his energy absorption rate.

Unbeknownst to him, the spiritual energy within the vortex surpassed a critical threshold. With a quiet expansion, the vortex grew larger—Li Shiming had broken through to the third layer of Qi Refining, reaching the final stage of the early Qi Refining phase.
