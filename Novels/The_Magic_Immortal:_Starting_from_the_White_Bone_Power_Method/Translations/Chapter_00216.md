**Chapter 216: The Sanctum Must Be Secure**  

Wang Chan gazed at the scenery outside, lost in thought.  

Finding a suitable sanctum for cultivation within Black Dragon City was no trivial matter. As Yu Baishuang had previously warned, though the city was a renowned haven for cultivators, it was also teeming with all manner of unscrupulous individuals—heretics, bandits, demons, and monsters lurked in the shadows. Many lesser sanctums were dens of corruption, chaotic and dangerous.  

Though he feared no one, Wang Chan had no desire to waste time embroiled in pointless battles. His sole focus was cultivation.

Elsewhere, a white-haired middle-aged man recoiled as a powerful spray was suddenly directed into his eyes.  

"You claim you wouldn’t dare? You, Bai Yuxian, who dared to betray your own sect—what *wouldn’t* you do?" Lou Shenghao roared, spinning around with a furious flick of his sleeve.  

"Good, very good. Thank you, Brother Long. Thank you..." After days of struggling on the brink of death, Lan Mao felt an overwhelming sense of relief.  

Meanwhile, several young masters descended the stairs, whispering among themselves with peculiar expressions.  

Arthur hadn’t expected the shield before him to be so resilient. Despite his strength, it had taken considerable effort to break through. With a cold snort, blue light flickered around him as a torrent of energy surged forth, slamming into the trembling barrier.  

"Is it really that serious?" Though Long Wa was undeniably powerful, Tia believed she understood his character well—he wouldn’t resort to such extremes.  

Holding a high-powered flashlight, I examined the stone door closely. Beside it, an eerie oil lamp fashioned in the shape of a human figure hung from the wall.  

At that moment, Qian Ye felt an indomitable spirit rise within him, as though facing down an army alone. Zi Yan, watching his seemingly unremarkable figure, felt an inexplicable flutter in her chest. Behind him, she sensed a rare steadiness.  

The two figures before them wore the distinct insignia of the Cloud Heaven Sect, their blue robes smudged with dirt as if they had been crawling through mud.  

"What *is* this golden dragon? Even the Threefold Sealing Array can't suppress it completely!" Mu Feng paled, glancing up at the radiant moon above. With a flick of his sleeve, a streak of black light darted toward it.  

The rule was simple: when leaping from the cliff, one had to utter the spatial password. Without it, even a hundred jumps would never grant entry to this hidden realm.

Yun Qianyue, who had crashed into a rockery and tumbled to the ground, scrambled backward in a daze. But before she could retreat far, an overwhelming force seized her, pulling her into an inescapable vortex.  

Amidst the snow-laden branches, sparse white plum blossoms stood out against the cold, while beneath the tree lay a corpse half-buried in frost.  

Su Meimei had only glimpsed Xu Siyuan from a distance earlier, but now, seeing him up close, his grace and bearing surpassed even her imagination.  

At this thought, a faint smile curled at Chu Xiangsi's lips, her mood evidently improved.  

In my mind, the shadow of Ming Si flickered, and my legs suddenly felt too heavy to move.  

Linglong sneered, stepping forward to seize Han Anqi by the collar and slam her against the wall.  

The villagers drew nearer, their stiff expressions and vacant eyes mirroring those of the residents of Yangqu Village.  

Though Lin Kun was hardly a virtuous man, Old Maid Gui couldn’t help but feel a grudging gratitude toward him in this matter.  

By now, Chu Xiangsi had fully regained her senses, her icy glare fixed on Nangong Zhuohua as she struggled violently.  

Delhi paled in comparison to the vibrant cities of Rajasthan. Though it bore the remnants of eight dynasties, few of its ruins were truly awe-inspiring. Of course, with only three days to spare, Xue Luo and Liu Jingshu couldn’t expect to see much.  

"If Oppa Jungkook hates me, my days will be miserable from now on," Lee Hyori muttered, crouching to scrub her shoes with sudden intensity.  

An invisible force enveloped the Fifth Prince, whisking him a hundred miles away to observe the battle from a safe distance.  

Zhang Tao’s first-generation device could run numerous games, had an impressive camera, and the touchscreen was far sturdier than rumors suggested. Naturally, the others wanted one for themselves—they had the money, after all.  

"Fine, fine. Just my luck. I’ll take my grandson and head back," Aunt Li grumbled, though her grandson’s whining left her little choice.  

Amid the excitement of the Wolf Domain’s members, their leader remained composed. With a wave, he delegated the cleanup to them, offering only a few instructions before ordering them to contact the Black Marsh Elder to finalize the exchange.

"Very well, I have another question. Do you know of the enmity between the Black Tortoise Clan and the Roc Clan?" Xu Xian asked.  

The best time to hunt vampires was during the day—sunlight was their greatest weakness. Even firelight could deter them.  

"And the other ship? How did the Minsk aircraft carrier end up in China?" Pani pressed.  

His original intent had been to target Jun Jianxing alone. He never imagined events would spiral to this extent.  

"Dragon my foot! Don’t sully such a sacred creature by associating it with your pathetic bow. You’re trash, and so is everything you wear!" Wushuang Jianhun bellowed.  

Before long, Wei Yi arrived at the Cangming Clan’s territory, which spanned a mere hundred miles. For him, locating a major clan within that radius was effortless.  

His sudden appearance drew many stares, though his altered appearance left most unable to recognize him.  

The Three Elders of the Sacred Soul were all ninth-tier quasi-saints—any one of them stood at the pinnacle of power in the Sacred Soul Domain.  

The Threefold Corpse-Sealing Array far surpassed the Threefold Ancestor-Sealing Array; the two weren’t even comparable.  

Eight battles in the group cycle, all victories—his place in the final Dragon’s Ascent was secured.  

Zheng Yi had initially tolerated his antics, but the man’s wretched demeanor was becoming unbearable. If left unchecked, he’d soon be floating away on his own delusions.  

He and his wife had never provoked the Tang Deguang family, yet they seemed determined to drive them to ruin.  

"Everyone, Nie Tian has fused with the Void Heart. In these three days, his strength may advance further. Even against a legendary Divine Realm expert, he stands a chance," Tian Gong remarked with a smile.  

Yue Xin was confident. She also knew Yu Ming wasn’t the type to be swayed by empty words. Seeing no need to press further, she let the matter rest.
