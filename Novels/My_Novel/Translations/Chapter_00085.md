# Chapter 85: Shooting the Mountain Bandits and Provoking the Mountain Wind

Immediately, more than a dozen men emerged from the sides of the mountain path. Each carried a large blade on his shoulder, his face full of viciousness, grinning from ear to ear.

The leader was a short, square-faced man from the Mountain Wind Stronghold, known by the nickname "Square Waist." Because of his short stature, he would cut people in half at the waist during fights, hence the name.

"Stop, stop, stop!"
"I said stop! Are you deaf?!"

Square Waist shouted a few times, his expression turning fierce as he infused his voice with Qi.

Uncle Fu and the others felt their eardrums tremble and saw stars before their eyes; they had no choice but to stop.

"Which village are you from? Pretty well-off, huh?" Square Waist's eyes were like green beans, but having practiced martial arts, they shone with a piercing light. Combined with the long stay in the bandit den, he exuded a seven-tenths killing aura that chilled people to the bone.

"Big Brother, we're from Black River Village. We're from Black River Village."

Uncle Fu stepped forward to negotiate.

"Black River Village?"

Square Waist thought for a moment. "Oh... I remember now..." As he finished speaking, he swung his great blade and sliced off half of Uncle Fu's ear.

He put on a stern look and said, "Good, good! You said you had no money!"

"Last time, the Fourth Master brought people to your village to teach you farming and mediate village disputes. Several girls in your village lusted after the Master's good looks and insisted on following him up to the stronghold."

"You tell me, we sent people and exerted effort, yet we didn't even get any辛苦钱 (hard-earned money), nor did we see any thanks from you. Now you have money to go to the town market?"

"It seems you lied to us."

As Square Waist spoke, it drew loud laughter from the bandits, which was quite amusing.

However, among the village men, several had red eyes. Among the women abducted to the mountain in the past were their own sisters.

After Square Waist finished speaking, he kicked Uncle Fu to the ground.

"Uncle Fu!"

The crowd cried out in shock. They had come equipped with firewood knives and clubs, but they dared not swing them.

Fortunately, the ground was covered with snow, which cushioned the fall. Uncle Fu groaned in pain but could still move.

"Big Brother, please... please let us explain."
"We sold the old ox to... to get these few grains."

Uncle Fu struggled to stand up, cupped his fists, and said with a forced smile.

"Big Brother, this half of the grain is all for you, as a tribute."
"Please have mercy and leave us a path. This half of the grain, leave it for us to barely survive the winter."
"You see, we must stay alive to be able to supply you regularly, right?"

Square Waist nodded. "That makes sense. I see you're a sensible old fellow. Alright then, bring me sixty percent of the grain."

Uncle Fu felt a pang in his heart but was truly helpless. There were ten bags of coarse yellow millet in total; he painfully handed six bags to the Mountain Wind Stronghold.

At least there were still four bags.

"Give me one more bag."

Square Waist laughed.

"This... this..." Uncle Fu was in a great dilemma, but he could only endure it and had someone hand over another bag.

"You old thing, so pathetic. To live to this extent, you have no regrets."
"No wonder you've lived so long; you must have some tricks up your sleeve."

The bandits chattered and laughed happily. Suddenly, Square Waist drew his blade. With two swishes, he sliced open the remaining three bags of grain.

Yellow millet scattered all over the ground, mixing with the snow.

"Go pick it up."
"You'd better be quick; it's almost dark."

Square Waist said proudly.

"Damn you!"

A young man couldn't hold back his anger. He raised his club and charged at Square Waist.

"Don't!" Uncle Fu's face changed, and he hurried to stop him. But it was too late; the man had already swung his club, hitting Square Waist on the shoulder.

Square Waist felt the pain. He raised his shoulder, and the club shattered inch by inch. He grinned ferociously, "Good kid, you've got guts, daring to strike me." He grabbed the man.

The man roared, "Without food, we're dead anyway. I'd die content if I can land a hit on you!"

"You might be content," Square Waist looked at the others. "But what about them? Besides, your hit didn't hurt me at all."
"Heh heh, when my great blade cuts you later, that will hurt..."

Suddenly, a strange sound was heard.

The word "hurt" had just left his mouth when an arrow shot out, pinning Square Waist to the ground.

Being hit by a club didn't hurt, but this powerful flying arrow... it truly pierced the flesh and bone.

It hurt terribly!

His proud expression twisted instantly.

But this arrow was infused with powerful Qi. It pierced through his shoulder and into the ground. He howled in agony but couldn't get up.

Li Xian shot another arrow.

One, two, three...

Those ordinary bandits were all pierced through the throat, dying instantly.

One bandit reacted quickly, drawing his knife to block. Li Xian suddenly dropped from above, kicking him in the lower back. With a "bang," the bandit was kicked瘫痪 (paralyzed), falling to the ground, his limbs twitching and trembling.

"Watch out for the blade!"

A bandit immediately slashed. Li Xian struck first, punching him in the face.

Once Li Xian appeared, his moves were extremely ruthless.

He solved several men in a row, his divine might descending like a god, stunning everyone. He saw a bandit looking stunned, only three steps away. He immediately strode forward and punched the bandit in the chest. The internal force penetrated,爆ing his heart.

He then turned around and threw his saber, killing another bandit with a single slash.

In the blink of an eye, seven or eight bandits were dead.

The remaining three bandits had lost all fighting spirit and were desperately fleeing. Li Xian nocked another arrow...

*Whoosh—*

The arrow traced a perfect arc.

One bandit fell.

[You have killed a bandit, proficiency +4]

Li Xian's expression was cold. He released his finger.

[You have killed a bandit, proficiency +4]

The last bandit had run quite far, with green plants blocking the view.

Li Xian aimed his bow upward, infused with Qi, and shot. The arrow traced a higher, longer arc, indescribably beautiful.

The final arrow struck down.

[You have killed a bandit, proficiency +4]

In the changing winds and clouds, not a single one was left.

"Does it hurt?"

Li Xian walked over to Square Waist and stepped on the arrow wound.

"Hurt your ass!"
"You dare touch me? I'll wipe you out!"

Square Waist said viciously.

Li Xian took out another arrow and viciously stabbed it into his left shoulder, blood gushing out. "Does it hurt now?"

Square Waist gritted his teeth and refused to speak. Li Xian sneered, "You do have some backbone."
"Pity you won't live long."

Li Xian wasted no more words. He nocked an arrow and slowly drew the bowstring. During this process, Square Waist's expression showed visible fear. He was about to beg for mercy...

An arrow shot out,钉ing (nailing) his head to the ground.

"No..."

He died with his eyes wide open.

"Big Brother... this..."

Uncle Fu and the others had no joy in their expressions.

"Bury these bodies."
"Pretend this never happened."

Li Xian said calmly, "By the way, remember to search the bodies."

"Hurry up!" Uncle Fu came to his senses and urged everyone to dig a pit and bury the bodies.

Everyone was a farmer. Working together, they quickly dug a large pit, threw all the corpses into it, and covered them up.

They found a total of seven taels of silver, along with some iron knives and iron spears.

Li Xian gave three taels to Uncle Fu and said, "If this gets exposed, Black River Village will surely be raided. But if we don't fight back, we'll either starve or freeze to death."
"You don't need to panic. Just follow my orders, and we can handle whatever comes."
"At least... things won't get any worse."

Li Xian's calm demeanor infected everyone.

The farmers' eyes gradually became firm. Since there was no way to retreat, they could only rely on the guardian, Mr. Li.

"Guarding Black River Village, we can't avoid the Mountain Wind Stronghold forever."

Li Xian thought to himself that with just him alone, it would be difficult to defend the village alone. It would be better to arm the villagers again to increase their strength.

He told them to bring those knives, clubs, axes, hammers, and other weapons back to the village and bury them in another large pit.

They might be able to retrieve them for use later.
