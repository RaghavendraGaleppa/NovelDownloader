# Chapter 75: One More Cleaning Technique Customer

"Brother Gu, please sit here!"

After a brief moment of hesitation, Wu Jinfei gave up his seat to Gu Mo. The spot Wu Jinfei had been sitting in was previously occupied by Yao Shifeng.

He had assumed that after Yao Shifeng left, he would be the most successful member of their small group, so he had naturally taken that seat.

It wasn't until Hu Hai and Chu Feifei arrived that Wu Jinfei learned about Gu Mo becoming an outer sect disciple. Wu Jinfei was an ordinary miscellaneous disciple in the Artifact Peak who didn't pay much attention to sect news—after all, such matters seemed irrelevant to someone of his status.

Thus, Wu Jinfei had remained unaware of Gu Mo's promotion.

But now that he knew, Wu Jinfei still didn't give up on currying favor. Though it might be a bit late, it was better than doing nothing.

"No need, I'll sit here."

Gu Mo waved his hand and took his usual seat, then turned to Hu Hai. "Hu Hai, has the result come out?"

"Yes."

Hu Hai nodded.

After the Dan Poison incident, Hu Hai had survived thanks to Gu Mo's timely intervention. While Gu Mo had cleansed the poison from Hu Hai's bones, muscles, and flesh, he couldn't do anything about the tainted spiritual energy. As a result, Hu Hai's body now circulated spiritual energy infused with Dan Poison.

If Hu Hai chose to disperse the contaminated energy, he might have had a chance to start over. But in the end, he decided to keep it, preserving his Qi Refinement third-layer cultivation.

The trade-off was that he could no longer progress further. However, for a miscellaneous disciple with inferior spiritual roots, Qi Refinement third-layer was already close to the limit.

Had Hu Hai chosen to start anew, he might not have even reached Qi Refinement third-layer again.

Moreover, this Dan Poison-infused spiritual energy was formidable in its own right. A single strike could contaminate an enemy, drastically weakening them in moments. When directed at magical artifacts, it could disrupt a cultivator's control over them. Without exaggeration, Hu Hai's combat prowess had significantly increased.

But the downside was that this tainted energy barred him from practicing any of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation. If he tried to refine pills with it, the result would invariably be useless dregs.

Unable to continue his duties as a miscellaneous disciple, Hu Hai no longer had a place in the sect. Of course, the sect had no intention of expelling him—after all, he hadn't done anything wrong. In fact, he had contributed greatly to the Pill Peak's research.

Since staying in the sect no longer made sense, the sect decided to assign Hu Hai to an external post. The Qinglu Sect had many external enterprises that required guardians.

Hu Hai's poisonous abilities made him particularly suited for combat.

However, once he left, it would be difficult for him to return. Thus, this gathering marked their final farewell.

"That's fine, but be careful out there—it's dangerous." Gu Mo nodded after hearing Hu Hai's decision. It was common for miscellaneous disciples nearing the end of their lifespans to be assigned outside. Depending on their contributions, the sect would assign them to relatively peaceful locations to live out their remaining years.

Hu Hai was still young and now wielded formidable poison techniques, so his destination was unlikely to be tranquil.

With parting imminent, Hu Hai broke his usual silence and spoke at length. Finally, he glanced at Yao Shifeng's empty seat. He had notified their former leader, but it seemed Yao Shifeng had no intention of joining them.

"Well then, until we meet again!"

Hu Hai rose and bowed slightly to the group before leaving the private room. He would depart directly for his new assignment.

"Ah..."

Watching Hu Hai leave, Gu Mo sighed inwardly. Their original group of five had already lost Yao Shifeng to complete estrangement, and now Hu Hai was gone as well.

"Brother Gu!"

After Hu Hai left, Wu Jinfei approached Gu Mo, intending to flatter him. But when he noticed Chu Feifei also moving toward them, he hesitated and ultimately decided to leave. Lingering would have been impolite.

"Gu Mo! Is it too late to congratulate you on becoming an outer sect disciple now?"

Chu Feifei greeted him with a smile. Unlike Wu Jinfei, she still treated Gu Mo with the same ease as before. She was confident in her own ability to become an outer sect disciple, and since she believed she could keep up with Gu Mo, she saw no reason to treat him differently.

"If you'd waited any longer, we could have congratulated each other on our promotions," Gu Mo teased.

Chu Feifei rolled her eyes at him, opening her mouth to speak but hesitating at the last moment.

"What's wrong?"

Seeing her hesitation, Gu Mo pressed. In their small group, Chu Feifei was now the only one he truly trusted.

"Gu Mo... I want to try the perfected-level Cleaning Technique." Chu Feifei finally voiced the thought that had been on her mind ever since learning Gu Mo had mastered it.

Her unique constitution had a deep connection to the Cleaning Technique. If a perfected-level Cleaning Technique were used to cleanse her, would it trigger a change in her physique?

Her confidence in keeping up with Gu Mo stemmed from this special constitution. If the perfected-level technique could awaken its potential, she might not just match him—she might even surpass him.

"Do you know the cost of having someone else perform a perfected-level Cleaning Technique on you?" Gu Mo was taken aback by her request and countered with a question of his own.

"Don't worry, I can handle the pain!"

Recalling Hu Hai's agonized expression when Gu Mo had used the technique on him, Chu Feifei clenched her teeth.

Gu Mo immediately realized she had no idea what the true cost was. Of course—how would a miscellaneous disciple like her know the details of a perfected-level technique?

He explained the actual price to her, and in the next moment, Chu Feifei's face flushed bright red.

"So... do you still want me to perform it?" Seeing her rare expression, Gu Mo couldn't resist teasing her.

"Yes!"

To his surprise, Chu Feifei's resolve only hardened.

Exploring the secrets of her constitution required the perfected-level Cleaning Technique—it was undoubtedly a key factor. But Chu Feifei knew mastering it herself was nearly impossible.

Her only option was to have someone else perform it. And if she had to choose between a stranger and Gu Mo, she trusted him far more. Even if he learned the secrets of her body, she believed he wouldn't take advantage of her.

That was the trust they had built over the years.

"Alright then."

Since Chu Feifei was willing to let him uncover her secrets, Gu Mo had no reason to refuse. Truthfully, he was curious to see how much the perfected-level technique could awaken her special constitution.

But he couldn't have suggested it himself. Now that she had brought it up, he was eager to find out.

Gu Mo took Chu Feifei on his flying sword to his spirit herb field cottage. Awakening her constitution wasn't something they could do in a public place like the market, and her own quarters weren't suitable either.

His cottage, protected by formations and guarded by Peashooters and Potato Mines, was impervious even to Foundation Establishment cultivators. There was no safer place.
