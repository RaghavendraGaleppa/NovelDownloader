# Chapter 36: Ferrying the Yin Spirits, The Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix Inheritance Ground

After不知過了多久 (an unknown amount of time), the intense sensation of weightlessness finally vanished, yet they still had no solid ground beneath their feet; they had not landed on the earth.

Li Mo finally regained consciousness.

He suddenly realized that behind him were clouds and mist radiating seven-colored light. It was precisely because of this strange radiance that they had suffered no harm whatsoever. And all this brilliance was flowing out from the cracks of a stone door not far away.

"Thank you. You can let go now."

A cold voice sounded by his ear.

"Uh..."

Li Mo was momentarily dazed.

That peerlessly beautiful face was incredibly close to his; he could even feel her warm breath. Because he was holding her so tightly, he could even feel the Ice Cube's heartbeat through their clothes.

It is well known that when a person falls into water or from a high altitude, they subconsciously grasp at anything they can hold.

Young Master Li felt a bit awkward for a moment. It seemed he had worried unnecessarily and done something superfluous.

Li Mo coughed lightly, let go of her and stood up, pretending to look around. "Where is this? I've never heard that there is such a place beneath the Qingyuan Cliff."

"You asked me to come to Wangyue Cliff, just to bring me here?"

"Mm." Ying Bing nodded, offering no further explanation.

"How did you know about this place?" Li Mo asked casually. When people are awkward, they tend to talk more nonsense.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and said indifferently, "I have been here in a dream."

If one considers the events of her previous life as a dream, this statement isn't exactly wrong. After her rebirth, many things have changed. Fortunately, the call of this place to her has never disappeared. Even if others had a hundred lives and jumped off Wangyue Cliff, they could not have arrived at this inheritance ground located within the Qingyuan. Even if they did, they could not enter the interior of the inheritance smoothly; they would only be trapped to death on the light bridge.

"Let's go."

Ying Bing subconsciously reached for her waist, but grasped empty air.

"Use mine."

As the words fell, a very ordinary-looking blue steel sword appeared in her hand, with a few rice-grain-sized nicks on it.

It seems that his arrival at Wangyue Cliff wasn't as effortless as he claimed?

Suppressing her thoughts, Ying Bing nodded slightly and moved forward with the sword. Li Mo followed by her side, vigilant of their surroundings.

Since this is an inheritance ground, there might... be some kind of test?

The thought had just crossed his mind when—

*Woo—*

A piercing wind blew past, causing a chill to rise from the depths of their souls.

"Come down... keep me company..."

"Why are you still alive!"

"Fortune... peerless fortune... take me in with you..."

Layer upon layer of murmurs drifted over with the wind.

"Be careful."

"Don't stray too far from me," Ying Bing's clear voice rang out.

"What are these?" Li Mo looked around, using the light from the bridge.

He found that dark clouds were surging, and occasionally, ferocious and pained faces flashed by.

If it were the past, Ying Bing would definitely be too lazy to explain. But today, she actually clarified for him: "When martial artists reach the Observation of the Divine Realm, they can observe mountains, rivers, the sun, the moon, strange flowers, various beasts, and even heavenly wonders to temper their spirit. When Observation of the Divine is perfected, the spirit can even leave the body to control objects."

"If a martial artist above the Observation of the Divine Realm dies with an obsession, a remnant of their spirit will not perish and will transform into Yin Spirits."

"Yin Spirits cannot see the sunlight, which is why there are so many of them here."

Young Master Li understood immediately.

One could imagine that many people have harbored the thought of exploring the Qingyuan and put it into practice. Among them, there were no shortage of strong experts. Obviously, they all failed. A wisp of their obsession remained here forever, guarding the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix Inheritance they could no longer enter.

"Yin Spirits..."

The cold wind, carrying the Yin Spirits, attacked from all sides. The Ying Bing by his side suddenly made her move.

*Clang—*

This was the first time Li Mo saw Ying Bing strike seriously.

The sword light暴涨 (exploded), blooming with over a hundred sword flowers. Every single sword Qi flower精准 (precisely) hit a Yin Spirit, slamming it back.

Perfected Realm "Seeking Flowers Swordplay"!

---

However.

This attack, which would be enough to make a Inner Qi Realm expert retreat, did not cause much damage after hitting the Yin Spirits. It merely knocked them back into the mist, and they would卷土重来 (return) before long.

"Hurry up, Yin Spirits do not fear blades..."

Ying Bing hadn't finished speaking when a warm and auspicious aura suddenly came from behind.

In Li Mo's chest, the brocade bag lit up with the shape of a feather.

The Fire Sparrow Feather.

Pure Yang and supremely upright, it is the bane of evil and Yin filth.

Li Mo threw a light punch.

A thin layer of Fire Sparrow Yang Qi actually附着 (clung) to his fist.

"Hehehe..."

The Yin Spirit opposite him clearly did not possess complete consciousness. It simply couldn't realize the severity of the situation.

*Sizzle!*

It was like snow meeting boiling oil.

The Yin Spirit's thick, ink-black figure began to消融瓦解 (melt away) almost instantly. It instinctively wanted to retreat but was directly punched through by Li Mo.

*Puff—*

The Yin Spirit dissipated.

"There is a trace of Phoenix clan aura in that brocade bag. It should be left by some bird containing the bloodline of a true Phoenix?" Ying Bing's tense body relaxed slightly.

In that case, she wouldn't have to worry about protecting him.

However...

Why did Li Mo just stand there, motionless?

Young Master Li was a bit stunned.

Because just now, the system actually sent a prompt.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing and helping 'Xia Rong' eliminate their obsession and find peace.】

【Investment Feedback: One year of Martial Dao comprehension.】

Li Mo: "!"

Killing Yin Spirits actually counts as investment feedback? No wonder they say ferrying souls is a merit.

Thus, Li Mo looked at the shadows rolling in the mist, his eyes filled with some eagerness.

Even a mosquito's leg is meat. The reward should be taken if it can be.

Li Mo was about to continue when he noticed the Ice Cube frowning slightly and looking at him.

"Cough."

"Many of these Yin Spirits were seniors of the Qingyuan Sect. Since it is a small effort, let us help them find peace."

Young Master Li said seriously.

Ying Bing pursed her lips, a hint of clarity flashing in her eyes. In the end, she didn't urge him on, waiting quietly by the side. When Yin Spirits came for her, she would even顺便 (take the opportunity to) drive them toward Li Mo.

*Thrilling.*

Li Mo shouted inwardly with enjoyment.

Men and women working together, the work is not tiring.

In less than two incense sticks of time, the Yin Spirits were basically cleared out, and even the air seemed less chilling.

In exchange was a series of investment feedbacks. Roughly calculated, the Martial Dao comprehension amounted to eighty-six years. Added to the original amount, it almost reached two hundred years. There were also various miscellaneous items: broken weapons, pills with different effects, gold and silver treasures, and even a few property deeds—unclear if they are still valid today.

"Thank you," Li Mo said with a genuine smile, cupping his fist toward Ying Bing.

"Mm." Ying Bing sheathed her sword, a莫名 (strange) feeling rising in her heart. She sometimes couldn't understand why Li Mo did things that offered no benefit and wasted time. But the feeling after doing it... didn't seem to be讨厌 (dislikable)?

Shaking her head, she took a few steps forward and finally stood before the inheritance ground's entrance, the moss-covered stone door.

Her fair hand pressed against the stone door.

*Hum—*

A strange vibration came. Dust fell in簌簌 (rustling) layers, and the stone door slowly opened.

A peach-colored brilliance flowed out, filling the surrounding space.

The light suddenly became bright. Li Mo subconsciously raised his hand to shield his eyes, looking through the cracks of his fingers into the doorway.
