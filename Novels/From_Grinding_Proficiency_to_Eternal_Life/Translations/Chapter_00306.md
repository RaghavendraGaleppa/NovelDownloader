# Chapter 306: Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas, Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds

Immediately following was a long sword as clear as ice crystal. Its blade was as thin as a cicada's wing, yet it exuded a bone-piercing chill, freezing the surrounding malevolent energy into frost.

There was also a long saber as red as blood. Its blade was broad and thick, its edge glowing with a dark golden sharpness. The back of the blade was carved with ancient flame runes, and the hilt was wrapped in the sinews of a scarlet dragon. Gripping it felt like holding a raging fire. Within the saber's body, it seemed as if magma was flowing, and every tremor would cause the surrounding malevolent energy to ignite.

What Xu Yunfan paid the most attention to, however, was a pair of giant hammers as black as ink. The hammerheads were carved with patterns of mountains and sea waves, while the handles were wrapped in flood dragon sinews.

And then there was that longbow.

This longbow was entirely black, its body carved as if from ink jade, upon which was inscribed the four characters "Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds." Its bowstring, however, glowed with a dark golden light, as if forged from the sinews of some ancient ferocious beast. Both ends of the bow arm were carved with ferocious beast heads, resembling neither dragon nor serpent, with bared fangs that seemed capable of devouring all life. Twisting strands of malevolent energy coiled around the bow's body, and faintly visible blood-colored runes flowed as if breathing.

Xu Yunfan's gaze burned with intensity as he weighed his options in his heart: "If I choose 'Nine Heavens Thunder Punishment,' it could work with my Pure Yang True Qi to summon lightning and break through enemies. 'Xuanming Cold Soul' could suppress fire-attribute techniques, but it conflicts with my Pure Yang cultivation. 'Blazing Swallowing the Heavens' has an astonishingly fierce aura, but it requires a fire-attribute technique to activate. 'Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas,' on the other hand, fits perfectly with my Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method..."

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan shook his head and couldn't help but laugh at himself. Here he was, making a selection as if it were a given, forgetting that it was still uncertain whether these divine weapons would even acknowledge him.

But whether they acknowledged him or not was the divine weapons' business.

Xu Yunfan stared at the Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow, his heart trembling slightly as he thought to himself, "This bow's malevolent energy is incredibly heavy. If I can control it properly, it might become a sharp tool..."

Just as he reached out to take it, the bow's body violently trembled, and malevolent energy surged as if in resistance.

Xu Yunfan let out a cold snort and circulated the *Pure Yang One Qi Technique*. Pure Yang True Qi, like a raging fire, wrapped around his palm as he forcibly gripped the bow's body.

In an instant, the malevolent energy and Pure Yang Qi violently collided, causing the abyss floor to shake as if a ferocious beast were roaring. The longbow trembled incessantly but could not break free from Xu Yunfan's hand.

In the end, the malevolent energy gradually subsided. The Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow slowly收敛ed its edge and fell silent. However, due to its resistance, the divine weapon concealed its own brilliance.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan didn't pay it any mind. Most of these divine weapons were bullies who feared the strong. Once he properly disciplined it, it would naturally submit obediently, just like the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip.

The seven-rank divine weapon before him, the Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow, was entirely carved like ink jade. Its bowstring glowed with a dark golden light, and its bow arms were carved with ferocious beast heads at both ends, which exhaled malevolent energy and faintly possessed the power to rend the void. But because it was resisting Xu Yunfan, it had now concealed its own brilliance, making it look somewhat ugly...

According to Du Gu Jiu, the weapons at the bottom of the Endless Abyss all had the potential to advance to eighth-rank divine weapons. If one could fully tame them, they would surely become a great killing tool.

"It's strange..." Xu Yunfan thought to himself. "My master, Bi Yuan, once said that subduing the divine weapons at the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss was extremely difficult. Why is it going so smoothly today?"

He didn't know that his descent into the abyss, which seemed effortless, was in fact due to a combination of unique advantages. The Sect Master Bi Yuan had personally protected him, using Pure Yang True Qi to disperse the malevolent energy. Furthermore, he wore the Dragon Scale Armor and had the Extreme Path's remains to protect his body. More crucially, before leaving, Du Gu Jiu had secretly used his sword intent to disperse the erosion of the malevolent energy.

If an ordinary disciple had rashly charged in, it would have been difficult to even speak of subduing a divine weapon. The sheer torrent of malevolent energy alone would have been enough to drive them insane and make every step impossible.

Xu Yunfan slung the Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow onto his back. His gaze swept over the remaining divine weapons, and a plan had already formed in his mind...

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and reached out to grab the pair of hammers.

The moment his hands grasped the Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers, the hammer bodies violently trembled. Dark golden mountain patterns appeared on their ink-black surfaces. A vast power of the earth's veins surged through his palms into his body, causing his figure to tremble slightly.

However, in the blink of an eye, the pressure, as if a mountain were toppling, was like a gentle breeze brushing his face under Xu Yunfan's incredibly formidable physique, having no effect whatsoever.

The pair of hammers seemed to have a spirit. They hummed incessantly in his hands, neither resisting nor completely submitting, as if they were judging whether he was qualified to hold them.

"Hmph, and you're being picky?"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grin. The Pure Yang True Qi in his body surged, and at the same time, he circulated the explosive force of the *Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method*. The muscles in his arms bulged, and his vital energy and blood, like dragons, continuously poured into the Suppressing Seas and Shaking Mountains Hammers.

The trembling of the hammer bodies gradually weakened and eventually returned to calm. However, the power of the earth's veins did not fully收敛, but instead resonated faintly with his true qi, as if to say, "I acknowledge you for now, but whether you can truly wield us depends on your skill."

It had the feel of a blind date from his previous life—the kind where women in their thirties looked at him with a hint of disdain, but unable to find anyone better, could only reluctantly settle.

"Damn it..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but curse in his heart. Although this pair of divine weapons had reluctantly acknowledged him as their master, to unleash their full power, he would likely need to hone them in actual combat in the future.

He weighed the hammers in his hands, feeling the immense power contained within, and thought to himself, "The Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow is for ranged attacks, the Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers are unmatched in close combat, and再加上 the now fully acknowledged Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip... This trip to the Sword Burial Abyss has yielded far more than expected."

He truly hadn't expected that there would be a pair of hammers at the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss. Having grown accustomed to using hammers, he naturally had a special fondness for this type of weapon. There was no need for excessive calculation; one only needed to swing them continuously, using overwhelming force to crush all techniques.

Just as he was about to leave, the malevolent energy at the bottom of the abyss suddenly surged. The sound of clanking chains came from the distance, as if something had been disturbed.

It was about time. The malevolent energy in the Sword Burial Abyss was endless, gushing forth from the depths of the earth. To stay here for a long time would make it very difficult to get out later.

As for that Du Gu Jiu, that old fellow was no ordinary person, and was outside the scope of consideration.

He no longer hesitated. With the Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow on his back and the Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers in hand, he leaped onto the bronze plank road.

Behind him, the malevolent energy at the bottom of the abyss closed in like a tide.

As soon as he landed, he was met with Bi Yuan's deep, probing gaze.

He grinned and raised the dark, heavy Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers in his hand. The mountain patterns on the hammer bodies glowed with a dark golden luster under the sun, with the power of the earth's veins flowing faintly within.

He then shook the Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow slanted across his back. The bowstring hummed, seeming unwilling, yet helplessly fell silent.

Beside them, the Head of the Punishment Hall, Cui Yu, narrowed his eyes and couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

"The Shaking Mountains and Suppressing Seas Hammers... These hammers were left behind three hundred years ago by the 'Mountain Suppressing Honored One.' A single hammer can shake a mountain, and when both are used together, the earth trembles and the mountains shake! Legend has it that these hammers are extremely difficult to acknowledge a master; only one with strength that can pierce through a thousand jun and a will as firm as iron can control them."

His gaze then swept over the longbow, and he frowned slightly. "As for this Rending the Sky and Piercing the Clouds bow... why is its malevolent energy restrained and its bowstring dim? This bow was once the personal weapon of the 'Arrow God' Luo Jiuxiao. An arrow released could rend the long sky and pierce through mountains and seas. How could it end up in such a state?"

Bi Yuan's eyes flickered. Suppressing the comfort in his heart, he said slowly, "Yunfan, this bow... it doesn't seem to fully acknowledge you?"
