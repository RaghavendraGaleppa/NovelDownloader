# Chapter 118: The Phenomenon of Immortal Bloodline! Ghost Valley Captured Again!

Commander Zhou, born into the imperial family, had learned supreme-level techniques and Daoist arts. With guidance from Human Immortals and deities, his cultivation was no less than that of elite disciples from immortal sects!

He prided himself on being nearly invincible among those at the True Qi realm. In his view, only a handful in the world could match him—figures like Lu Huaiyuan of the Ascension Immortal Sect, the current Dao Child of the Luofu Immortal Sect, or the Buddha Child of the Diamond Temple.

After the Young Master of Kunlun achieved Human Immortality, Commander Zhou believed that no True Qi realm cultivator below the Human Immortal level could surpass him. He almost considered himself the undisputed number one in the world, unrivaled in the mortal realm!

Proud and arrogant by nature, he had already felt humiliated bowing to Li Zhengjing, whom he once looked down upon. Now, even the two beasts under Li Zhengjing’s command dared to insult him!

"A scholar would rather die than suffer humiliation!"

Commander Zhou drew his blade and shouted, "Beasts dare to insult me?"

He had already been contemplating whether to silence them permanently, but he knew the strange bird controlled the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, making victory uncertain. More importantly, if he killed them—sent by Li Zhengjing—it would mean outright enmity with Li Zhengjing. Yet, faced with such humiliation, he no longer feared death!

"Old Tree, he called us beasts!" Hanging Wall Bird was furious.

"I’m a tree. He was clearly only insulting you," the Five Elements Creation Tree replied.

"But he also insulted your second child!" Hanging Wall Bird added.

"Outrageous!" The Five Elements Creation Tree roared in anger.

"Flip! Flip!" The Wave-Severing Gu waved its tentacles, making sounds.

Boom!!!

The commotion of the battle immediately alerted the elite soldiers of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the peak True Qi elder, and the Blood Sword Artist who could seal throats with sword qi.

When they rushed over, they saw a charred figure lying on the ground, smoke rising from his body, with flames spreading across the surrounding vegetation.

"Save him!"

The group hurried to assist, only to realize the person in armor was none other than Commander Zhou, who had claimed to be invincible.

Not only was his body severely burned, but his mouth was also sealed shut by a tree branch.

"This branch has grown into his skull, connecting to the meridians of his eyes, ears, and mouth. If we pull it out, he’ll be blind, deaf, and mute..."

"He’s also poisoned!"

"This is a deadly toxin!"

"Quick, get the antidote pills! Dissolve them with True Qi and force them into his body!"

Chaos ensued. Meanwhile, in another direction, the Five Elements Creation Tree sprinted away on hundreds of root-like legs, while Hanging Wall Bird berated the Wave-Severing Gu.

"How could the mighty Divine King Gu have only one drop of poison left?"

"You couldn’t even kill a heavily injured man—how can we rely on you to end the Debt Collector’s life?"

"What? You were still half-asleep this morning when the master snatched you away and drained all your poison?"

Hanging Wall Bird’s expression turned complicated. "Old Tree, do you think our master has some... peculiar preferences? Why does he always like torturing himself with Gu insects?"

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots. "Back when I served my seventh master, there was someone like that too. He loved showing off in public, acting mighty and treating mortals like ants. But every time he went to a brothel, the women there would whip him and drip wax on him... At first, I thought those women were unfathomably powerful. Later, I realized any brothel woman could whip him, and he’d enjoy it..."

Hanging Wall Bird pondered. "That doesn’t seem quite the same as our master, does it? But then again, maybe it’s not that different?"

The Five Elements Creation Tree replied, "Of course not. My second child isn’t a brothel woman... Oh, quick, cover its tentacles! It’s too young to hear this..."

Inside the stone mansion, Li Zhengjing stared solemnly at several vials of blood before him.

These were drawn earlier from members of the Gao clan—ten vials from each. Afterward, he had them rest to recover before returning in the evening for another round.

"What did Ghost Valley Lingguan say?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked.

"There are many ways to test blood," Li Zhengjing replied. "Given our current environment, we lack proper tools, and this is our first attempt—so Ghost Valley chose the simplest method."

"The simplest?" Yuan Zhengfeng sounded surprised.

"The simplest is also the easiest to fail," Li Zhengjing said. "But these individuals are all strong cultivators with ample blood qi, so failure isn’t a concern."

"Do you need my help?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked.

"No. Your Human Immortal-level mana would instantly destroy the mystical properties in the blood. Blood testing requires precision—like threading a needle. The finer, the better..."

Carefully, Li Zhengjing extended a wisp of True Qi from his fingertip. He opened a vial and let the True Qi seep into the blood.

Boom!

The vial exploded, splattering blood all over him.

"Your True Qi doesn’t seem very 'fine,'" Yuan Zhengfeng remarked dryly.

"With my current cultivation and the Ascension Dragon Celestial Immortal Technique, I should be able to control it with extreme precision," Li Zhengjing muttered. "How did it fail?"

"Your True Qi has been transformed into sword qi due to the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi technique—it’s incredibly sharp," Yuan Zhengfeng analyzed with his Human Immortal insight. "In terms of offensive power, it might even rival Human Immortal-level mana."

"What should we do then?"

Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples.

Just then, Hanging Wall Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree returned—one flying into the courtyard, the other scaling the wall.

"Master, we followed that guy and intercepted a message from the capital," Hanging Wall Bird announced.

"The ancestral bloodline of the Lingyuan Gao clan might not be the issue, but starting from Gao Xuan’s generation and above, the maternal lineage seems to have something extraordinary," the Five Elements Creation Tree added, waving its roots.

"I initially thought Gao Xuan was consuming his clan’s blood to gather their lineage and enhance his own—a common demonic sect practice where one slaughters their own kin to empower themselves," Yuan Zhengfeng mused. "But now, it seems the reason isn’t demonic arts. Instead, the bloodline of recent generations has unique properties?"

"So, in one generation, a woman with extraordinary blood married into the Gao clan, spreading her lineage and altering the Gao bloodline?" Li Zhengjing pondered. Then he asked, "What about Commander Zhou?"

"We taught him a small lesson," Hanging Wall Bird said, emphasizing, "He’ll live."

"Tell Shi Yuan to find a way to obtain the Gao clan’s genealogy," Li Zhengjing ordered. "If he can’t, have him send someone to where we killed the Giant Rage Evil Monk and find the fake medicine peddler. That guy knows a lot."

"Got it!" Hanging Wall Bird replied, then added, "But the message also said Gao Xuan has entered the southeastern region and has already defeated two of the imperial guardian deities."

"That powerful?" Yuan Zhengfeng sounded surprised.

"No matter."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page’s fortune-telling and felt reassured. He beckoned the Five Elements Creation Tree to extend a root.

Now at the Yin-Yang Perfection stage, the tree was comparable to a great demon. It extended a root into the blood vial.

In an instant, the tree stiffened, let out a loud "Ah!", and collapsed onto the ground.

"What happened?"

Li Zhengjing rushed over and saw the tree’s root still submerged in the vial. The blood was rapidly being absorbed. Though unconscious, the tree’s aura hadn’t weakened—if anything, it seemed slightly stronger.

The Wave-Severing Gu, thinking the tree was dead, wailed like a cicada.

"Little friend Zhengjing, try pouring another vial?" Yuan Zhengfeng suggested.

"Alright."

Seeing no harm, Li Zhengjing poured another vial. The tree appeared even greener and more vibrant than before.

He stroked his chin. "The Five Elements Creation Tree isn’t supposed to feed on blood, right? The Gao clan’s blood seems like a potent tonic..."

With only one vial left, he hesitated. Hanging Wall Bird flew over, and Li Zhengjing considered testing it on the bird.

He poured the blood over the bird’s head.

"Ah?!"

Hanging Wall Bird shuddered. "Master, what’s this? Marinating me for roasting?"

"No..."

Li Zhengjing said, "Take these vials back to the Gao clansmen and fill them up. Also, tell them about Gao Xuan entering the southeastern region. If they don’t want to be drained dry by him, they’ll cooperate."

After Hanging Wall Bird left, Li Zhengjing took out the Three Realms Conch and recounted the blood-testing process.

The conch glowed briefly, and when Li Zhengjing channeled True Qi into it, Ghost Valley Lingguan’s voice emerged.

"It seems the Gao clan’s bloodline is indeed extraordinary. Pity I’ve already set sail—otherwise, I’d study it in detail."

"The Five Elements Creation Tree constantly gathers spiritual energy. It doesn’t need blood nourishment. I suspect the blood’s properties accelerated its absorption, making its growth visible."

"But the blood is too little—like a flame that burns out quickly. Pour more vials. As a Yin-Yang-perfected divine tree, it might glean some insights."

"Another testing method is to have the White Hanging Wall drink some and observe how its bloodline reacts."

"After all, the White Phoenix is a divine bird. Comparing the clash of bloodlines could yield answers."

As Ghost Valley’s voice faded, Hanging Wall Bird returned.

The moment it landed, it noticed Li Zhengjing’s odd stare.

"Little Hanging Wall, you’ve worked hard—traveling far, spying on Commander Zhou, delivering messages, and fetching blood. I forgot to ask if you’re thirsty..."

Li Zhengjing coughed. "Would you like a vial?"

"..."

Hanging Wall Bird’s feathers puffed up. "Master, I’m no savage! I’m a literate bird—I only eat cooked meat and freshly-pilled elixirs!"

Eventually, it relented but insisted on roasting the blood first.

Though Li Zhengjing suspected the Phoenix Flame would evaporate the blood’s vitality, he agreed.

The divine bird’s innate ability—Phoenix Flame—ignited, heating the vial. The blood boiled, then burst!

Blood splattered, evaporating into smoke under the flames. Yet, within the smoke, a phantom figure emerged!

A colossal White Phoenix roared within the flames!

And in the blood mist—a human figure!

Seated upon a lofty throne, the figure gazed down with overwhelming majesty, as if the heavens themselves would collapse under its gaze!

"Look with your eyes!" Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly groaned. "Its gaze carries divine might—it strikes directly at the soul!"

"What?"

Li Zhengjing, about to probe with his senses, quickly withdrew and looked with his naked eyes. The blood mist had already dissipated, but he caught a glimpse—a tall, crowned figure in robes, its outline blurred yet radiating undeniable authority.

"Hanging Wall! Again!"

Li Zhengjing turned, only to see the bird lying unconscious beside the Five Elements Creation Tree.

"Using its innate ability to burn the blood was even more direct than my soul perception," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "It’s knocked out. Thankfully, the blood’s potency is diluted after so many generations. It’ll wake up after resting."

"After so many generations, diluted to this extent, and it still has such power?" Li Zhengjing inhaled sharply. "The progenitor of this bloodline—could it be a true immortal?"

Stunned, he relayed everything to Ghost Valley Lingguan via the conch.

Ghost Valley’s voice soon replied.

"The White Phoenix’s divine bloodline indeed triggered the Gao blood’s latent power—a clash of lineages!"

"As you described, for a progenitor’s blood to remain so potent after generations is unheard of!"

"Throughout history, no legendary figure—not even those said to have ascended to immortality—left behind descendants with such power."

"The Gao clan might truly be descendants of an immortal!"

"This explains how Gao Xuan emerged from the Heavenly Star Cave. He’s likely gathering the blood to restore true immortal lineage..."

"Also—what?!"

Ghost Valley’s voice suddenly turned alarmed.

Li Zhengjing tensed.

Yuan Zhengfeng whispered, "He’s in trouble?"

Li Zhengjing anxiously called into the conch, but there was no response.

After a long pause, Ghost Valley’s voice returned—hoarse and strained.

"I’m fine..."

Before he could finish, another voice boomed from the conch.

"Old Ghost, come with me!" The voice was cold and imperious. "How many times have you fled? If not for your unparalleled medical skills, I’d have reduced you to ashes long ago! This is the last time—I’m personally escorting you back to the Golden Ship of Salvation..."

"Little friend Zhengjing, don’t worry. This is my dear friend, the Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation Heavenly Lord," Ghost Valley said, his tone complex. "I’ll return with him for now. Our journey to the East Sea is postponed... I’ll find you later."

"Li Zhengjing, I remember you. Visit the Golden Ship sometime," the Heavenly Lord’s voice dripped with killing intent. "Bring the Three Realms Conch."

"..."

Li Zhengjing silently put away the conch. "Ghost Valley said he’s fine. He’ll return later..."

Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "He’s escaped so many times without being killed. They must truly value him. We’ll have to wait for his next escape."

"Ah!!!"

Suddenly, the Five Elements Creation Tree shot upright, waving its roots. "Audacious fool! How dare you slay the emperor?!"
