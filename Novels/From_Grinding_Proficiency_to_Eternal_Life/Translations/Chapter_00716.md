# Chapter 716: Han Shi's Realization

"Sure enough, there are still flaws..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes were focused as he recorded the various problems with this newly refined Profound Mirror, feeling a bit overwhelmed for a moment.

The path of artifact refinement was inherently complex, involving the comprehension and verification of the Heavenly Dao, then applying it to the Way of Artifacts. Many array patterns embedded within the treasure needed to be tested one by one to ensure stability and the ability to unleash power amplified by ten or a hundred times.

Inside the passage to the Underworld, until the cracks were about to spread to the core and Han Shi's physical body was on the verge of shattering, Xu Yunfan finally made his move again.

Divine霄 Power was channeled through the void, and Purple Gold Thunder Authority reappeared, once again pulling Han Shi back from the brink of collapse, just barely saving him.

Han Shi fell to the ground, appearing even more wretched than last time, with some wounds on his body caused by the chaotic currents within the passage.

He looked at the ancient mirror fragments in his hand, which had shattered again, leaving only the frame. He couldn't even muster an angry expression, just staring blankly, his eyelids drooping, not saying a word.

However, Xu Yunfan could clearly feel the anger continuously accumulating in Han Shi's heart.

The clone Han Shi was formed from the accumulation of his negative emotions; even Wukong was the same.

It was just that Wukong, influenced by the Pure Land of Bodhisattva, had studied the scriptures for many years and was converted by the Bodhisattva, reducing the demonic nature in his heart. Otherwise, he should have been even more fierce than Han Shi.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't pay attention to Han Shi. He methodically collected the fragments, continued his analysis and deduction, and then made targeted improvements. The data from failure was also precious.

Time passed in cycles of repeated failures.

Although aided by the Attribute Panel and possessing mastery-level skill in artifact refinement, developing and innovating a new treasure required honest and thorough debugging.

Even so, with the information prompts from the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan's progress was like riding a rocket compared to other artifact-refining grandmasters.

In the following time, Xu Yunfan consumed heavenly and earthly spiritual materials to continuously refine new Inverse Fate Profound Mirrors, then shoved them at Han Shi to enter the Underworld.

On the third entry, mirror cracks appeared at the junction of the mirror frame's Samsara Stone Dao patterns. The new mirror supported him to a deeper point than the previous point of collapse before disintegrating. Xu Yunfan recalled Han Shi before his sword body could be deeply eroded by the death energy.

On the fourth entry, the energy coupling issue on the back of the mirror, formed from North冥玄晶, was significantly improved. However, the scale patterns on the mirror surface saw a sharp drop in effectiveness when resisting a special type of soul-corroding Yin wind, almost instantly shattering. Han Shi's soul suffered a heavy injury, and Xu Yunfan barely protected its core with the power of the Star Spirit Banner, pulling him back. Han Shi had to rest for a full month.

The fifth, sixth time...

Han Shi was completely numb.

He was like a walking corpse, utterly unable to resist, just continuously accumulating his Anger-Killing Sword Intent, hoping that one day he could strike down Xu Yunfan with a single sword.

When Xu Yunfan handed him the sixth improved Inverse Fate Profound Mirror, he didn't even make any extra movements, just mechanically took it, turned around, and walked towards the Underworld Gate.

All the light had faded from his eyes.

Whether the Inverse Fate Profound Mirror shattered or survived, whether he lived or died, it all seemed to have nothing to do with him anymore.

He was just a tool executing instructions after being input.

Xu Yunfan naturally didn't care. This Han Shi was very cunning. He looked numb on the surface, but inside, he was cursing incessantly without a moment's stop.

His spiritual sense was tightly locked onto Han Shi through the Attribute Panel.

This time, his eyes flickered with unprecedented solemnity and expectation.

Every previous failure was a stepping stone to success. The deduction data regarding Samsara of Life and Death and the Inversion of Yin and Yang on the panel had accumulated into a thick stack, and his Daoist attainment value had also quietly increased quite a bit from touching the limits of the Great Dao laws like this.

When entering the Underworld passage for the sixth time:

The violence remained, but the coldness was even more intense.

Han Shi numbly injected his spiritual power.

The new version of the Inverse Fate Profound Mirror hummed, the patterns on the back lighting up in sequence, the seven North冥玄晶 emitting a stable and coordinated reversal force.

The虬龙 scale patterns on the mirror surface no longer just glowed, but seemed to come alive. With the subtle opening and closing of the scales, they skillfully guided and dispersed the impacting spatial-temporal chaotic currents.

The layer of illusion simulating the True Spirit's Return to Emptiness achieved a startling degree of harmony with the violent fluctuations of the surrounding Underworld laws, almost merging into one.

No cracks appeared.

The barrier was as solid as a rock.

The violent chaotic currents and bone-corroding death energy struck the barrier like waves crashing against a reef. Although fierce, they couldn't shake its foundation.

Han Shi only felt an unprecedented stability. The terrifying pressure from the outside was perfectly isolated and dissolved by that seemingly thin layer of light screen.

A ripple of shock appeared in his numb eyes for the first time. He subconsciously lowered his head to look at the dark, ancient mirror in his hand.

It was emitting a gentle yet tenacious clear light, faithfully performing its duty.

Inside the Divine霄 Palace, Xu Yunfan closely watched the constantly refreshing data prompts on the Attribute Panel within his field of vision.

The data flow on the Attribute Panel was unprecedentedly stable.

'Inverse Fate Profound Mirror Structural Integrity: 99.9%'
'Simulated Law Fluctuation Compatibility: 99.5%'
'...'

Success.

Xu Yunfan's calm and unperturbed state of mind, at this moment, was like a lake surface with a stone dropped into it, rippling with a clear wave of joy.

Through Han Shi's perspective, he saw Han Shi located within the Underworld passage, steadily penetrating the final and most dangerous core chaotic current layer. The marker point landed firmly within the blood-red region representing the Underworld.

"Life and Death Samsara, Yin and Yang Inversion. This technique is truly infinitely profound!" Xu Yunfan silently recited in his heart. Within his field of vision, the progress bar for his comprehension of the Dao of Yin and Yang, and Life and Death on the Attribute Panel, clearly leaped forward a small segment, and his Daoist attainment value also jumped and increased slightly once again.

All things in heaven and earth: solitary yang does not give birth, solitary yin does not grow.

This was not merely the success of a treasure, but also an advancement in his understanding of the Great Dao laws.

His eyes flickered with delight, and he felt even more desire to explore and seek guidance from that White-Haired True Lord who was deeply versed in this Dao.

If there was an opportunity, he definitely had to have Han Shi exchange a few moves with that White-Haired True Lord.

That Dao of Life and Death Samsara would be of great benefit to his practice of the Small and Great Heavenly Circulations.

Now that Han Shi's physical body had successfully entered the Underworld, it meant that through the strong control link of the Cloud Script Incarnation Technique, he could, at a critical moment, use this innate sword body as a vessel to project Divine霄 Power far beyond the Foundation Establishment level through the void, briefly unleashing combat power not inferior to the Golden Core stage.

This undoubtedly greatly increased his trump cards in the game within the Underworld and his confidence in facing the White-Haired True Lord.

And on Han Shi's side:

When the suffocating tearing force of the passage suddenly vanished, Han Shi found himself standing firmly on the ground.

Beneath his feet were dark red, cold reefs like congealed blood. The air was filled with a thick, indelible stench of blood and a cold, lifeless chill that penetrated to the bone.

Before him lay an endless, churning ocean of blood.

The Samsara Bitter Sea.

Blood waves crashed against the reefs, emitting a dull, moaning roar. Within the spray, countless twisted, pained faces seemed to flash by.

The gray, hazy sky hung low, without sun, moon, or stars, only eternal oppression.
