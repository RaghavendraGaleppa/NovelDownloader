# Chapter 676: There's No Need for Morality When Dealing with the Demonic Path

Xu Yunfan's lips curled into a faint, almost imperceptible smile.

It seemed everything was proceeding according to his wishes. Dongming Zhenjun indeed did not wish for Pudu Zhenjun to discover her plans, preferring to seize a great realm for herself.

"A person's greed knows no bounds..."

Even Xu Yunfan would not dare to entertain such thoughts, yet Dongming Zhenjun acted on them.

Xu Yunfan had to admit, he was inferior in this regard.

To be fair, if not for his cultivation of the "Lin" character art, which allowed him to control his state of mind, and the guidance of Sect Master Zhang Ziyang by his side, he might have ended up just like Dongming Zhenjun.

The Aetila Realm—a great realm ruled by deities with a unique Heavenly Dao origin—was a place he had personally experienced. Although the three main deities possessed authority but lacked the true essence of the Great Dao, relying on the加持 of the local Heavenly Dao, their combined power was no weaker than a mid-stage Golden Core Zhenjun, even if individually they were merely on par with the Golden Core realm.

Dongming Zhenjun was strong, with mysterious and诡秘 Dao Arts, but fighting across realms, her power was greatly suppressed, losing the advantages of heaven, earth, and manpower.

"A dragon, however strong, cannot suppress a local snake... Dongming Zhenjun is going there; she's bound to suffer at the hands of those three main deities."

Xu Yunfan was certain of this in his heart.

He wasn't worried about Dongming's safety. With her methods, self-preservation was not an issue, but想要想搅动风云大肆收割, it wouldn't be easy.

He was happy to see this happen.

Only when Dongming hit a wall in the Aetila Realm would she place greater importance on her cooperation with him, her guide.

After all, only the two of them knew that Zhenjun Qingyuan had also been killed. When she returned in a sorry state, it would be the perfect opportunity for the two parties to transact again, obtaining the subsequent Golden Core cultivation methods, and even more secrets regarding the origin of the Aetila Realm.

Xu Yunfan slowly closed his eyes, his Divine Sense sinking once more into the Golden Core within his Dantian and the embryonic form of his Small World.

The priority was to comprehend the mysteries of the Golden Core. Although the Attribute Panel assisted him, granting him the ability to "prove once and for all," some progress still required him to verify step by step.

Time flowed like water, passing in the blink of an eye.

Seasons alternated, and thirty years flashed by.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged atop the Divine Thunder Mountain Peak. Purple-gold lightning cascaded down like a waterfall, the Dao Rhyme of his surroundings blending with the mountain's origin.

Thirty years of seclusion had completely stabilized the Divine Thunder Golden Core. Within the embryonic Small World, lightning was born and extinguished. With the assistance of the Attribute Panel, he faintly touched upon the mystery of "uplifting without falling."

However, without a similar Dao Fruit to connect with, it was merely a castle in the air, a reflection in the mirror.

His mind moved, and his Divine Sense swept through his Dantian. The surface of the purple-gold Golden Core was coiled by ninety-nine lightning dragons, while the inner walls of the Small World were as solid as a stellar core. The cycle of destruction and generation in the Dao laws was gradually forming a system.

On the Attribute Panel, the stability of [Divine Thunder Golden Core (Early Stage)] was already fixed at 100%, and a new line had quietly appeared below.

[Uplifting the Small World: 37%]

"Nourish the Core to transform the World, devour Dao Fruits... The Chiyang Dao Fruit is ultimately unavoidable."

Xu Yunfan sighed in his heart. In this world's cultivation system, the Dao Fruit is of utmost importance. For Golden Core cultivators, from initially obtaining and驾驭 the fruit position to later seizing and devouring others, there is an extremely long path to walk.

According to Dongming Zhenjun, devouring other Dao Fruits requires extreme caution. If one carelessly refines a Dao Fruit with incompatible attributes, one's cultivation will be stuck for life.

Xu Yunfan naturally did not wish for this.

His gaze was calm, his aura carrying a hidden thunder that did not strike.

He opened his palm, a wisp of purple-gold lightning flickered. Within the交织 of the lightning net, chaotic qi was annihilated and born again. His control over the Divine Thunder Dao laws had reached a level of subtlety and precision.

However, the shackles of "solitary yang does not grow" followed him like a shadow. The evolution of his Small World was always missing that final step.

This matter needed to be put on the agenda.

***

In the depths of the Chiyang Peak of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

Blazing flames illuminated the cavern like a furnace, with molten rock flowing down the cavern walls.

Li Guang Ranyan Chiyang Zhenjun stood with his hands behind his back. His crimson Dao Robe fluttered without wind, and the heat waves emanating from him distorted the space.

Opposite him, Tianji Xuan Shu Jianpo Tongxuan Zhenjun was surrounded by an invisible Sword Soul. His aura was as cold as ancient ice, standing in opposition to the scorching heat.

"Thirty years! A full thirty years! That Xu Yunfan has been hiding in the Yuanshi Sect's Divine Thunder Mountain, not even showing a single hair!"

Tongxuan Zhenjun's voice carried impatience, the Sword Soul beside him humming.

"If we wait here idly, are we going to wait until his Golden Core is perfected and his Small World hangs high?"

"What nonsense are you talking? Without other Dao Fruits, how can he perfect his Golden Core or hang his Small World? He'll be stuck at the early Golden Core stage for life."

Chiyang Zhenjun's lips curled into a scorching smile, the depths of his pupils seeming to flow with magma.

"What's the hurry? He just entered the Golden Core stage; his foundation isn't solid yet. Even if the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit is strong, he still needs external objects to solidify his Small World. Moreover, to refine his lifebound treasure and advance to a Spirit Treasure, he must take the Chaos Birth and Destruction Mystic Light from the Boundary Sea to temper his foundation. This is a necessary step."

Seeing the impatience still on Tongxuan Zhenjun's face, as if he didn't want to wait any longer, Chiyang Zhenjun pondered for a moment.

He flipped his palm, and a crimson crystal appeared, a dark light flickering within like a star.

"Within the Yuan Demon Sect, I have long had hidden agents planted. This Burning Heart Mirror is connected to Xu Yunfan's soul. Once there is a large-scale boundary-breaking fluctuation at Divine Thunder Mountain, it will immediately alert us. As long as Xu Yunfan dares to go to the Boundary Sea, he will be walking into a trap."

Tongxuan Zhenjun's sword-like brows raised slightly, a trace of surprise flashing across his stern face.

"They all say Chiyang Shidi is as fierce as fire, with a sword that never returns, but I didn't expect you to have such a means of laying out plans over a thousand miles."

"Dealing with demon spawn, why talk of光明正大?"

Chiyang Zhenjun sneered, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

"Members of the Demon Sect are cunning as foxes; one must use诡计 to counter诡计.

Once this Venerable seizes his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit and熔炼 into myself, Li Fire giving birth to Divine Thunder, breaking through to the mid-stage will be just around the corner!

By then, the things I promised you will naturally be fulfilled."

Tongxuan Zhenjun fell silent for a moment, the Sword Soul around him returning to stillness.

"I hope Shidi remembers his promise. My Xuan Shu Sword Soul wishes to break its shackles and requires the pure yang fire of your Chiyang Dao Fruit to perform the technique of merging yin and yang Sword Souls."

Tianji Xuan Shu Tongxuan Zhenjun practiced a yin-attributed Dao Fruit, so he naturally needed an extreme yang Dao Fruit for yin-yang balance.

"Rest assured!"

Chiyang Zhenjun waved his large hand, and the fire waves inside the cave surged to the sky.

"We each take what we need, and together we shall climb the Great Dao!"

***

Yuanshi Sect, Xuansha Mountain.

Nine Nether Evil Mist churned, the entire mountain peak shrouded in a阴冷 and decayed aura.

Inside the Bone Jade Hall at the summit, Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun leaned against the玄煞 Throne. Her originally倒众生 face was now pale as paper, her charming eyes dim and lifeless. Her noble Xuansha Dao Robe was torn in many places, stained with mottled golden divine blood and墨绿色 natural divine power residue.

Her aura fluctuated unsteadily, sometimes as晦涩 as an abyss, sometimes as虚浮 as a candle in the wind.

"Shidi Xu, please come up the mountain for a talk!"

A Divine Sense carrying exhaustion and anxiety pierced through space, arriving directly at Divine Thunder Mountain.

Atop Divine Thunder Mountain, Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes, a flash of purple-gold lightning passing through them.

She's back?

He sensed Dongming Zhenjun's will, which no longer held the majesty of the past but instead revealed weakness and urgency, and a knowing smile curled at the corners of his mouth.

"Thirty years. It seems this Zhenjun has taken quite a fall in the Aetila Realm."

His figure transformed into a purple-gold lightning bolt that tore through the void, arriving at the territory of Xuansha Mountain in an instant.

The Nine Nether Xuansha that shrouded the mountain peak, which洞察ed all thoughts, now seemed much滞涩.

As soon as he stepped into the Bone Jade Hall, a thick scent of blood and the burnt smell of divine power erosion rushed towards him.

Dongming Zhenjun sat with difficulty. When she saw Xu Yunfan's figure, a complex emotion flashed in her eyes, quickly replaced by deeper anxiety.
