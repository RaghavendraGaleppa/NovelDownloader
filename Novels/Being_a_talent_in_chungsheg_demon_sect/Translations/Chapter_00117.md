# Chapter 117: Captive

Guangming had some experience when it came to preserving his own life.

As early as when Guanghui and Lu Yang met, and Lu Yang, instead of avoiding the confrontation, faced it head-on, Guangming keenly sensed that something was amiss.

However, the "Heart Knot Life Talisman" could only be used once within a short period. Furthermore, with Guanghui, a fellow disciple who knew him inside and out, it was impossible for him to use the "Heart Knot Life Talisman" to escape in the middle of battle.

So, when Guanghui summoned all the Buddhist cultivators to manifest the "Dragon-Elephant Vast Power Vajra," Guangming chose not to participate. Instead, under the cover of the Buddha light, he decisively burrowed into the ground and fled, using Guanghui and the others as human shields, just as he had before. Undeniably, this tactic was very effective. He was almost able to escape with his life again.

However, this time, his attempt to flee was keenly observed by someone who had been watching the entire battle but couldn't find an opportunity to intervene and showcase himself: Qin Tianhe!

As a True Disciple of the Sacred Sect, Qin Tianhe also cultivated powerful Great Divine Abilities, and coupled with the wondrous artifact "Void-Piercing Sky-遁烏梭 Shuttle," his strength was actually not weak. After all, he had previously managed to force a path to survival even when besieged by over a dozen Buddhist cultivators including Guangming. It was only in comparison to Lu Yang that he seemed weak, and Qin Tianhe himself understood this. Hence, he was extremely proactive, eager to prove his worth and cling to this powerful ally.

Therefore, Guangming hadn't gotten far before Qin Tianhe caught up to him and dragged him back.

At this point, Guangming was helpless. To save his life, he could only shout for mercy: "Don't kill me! I can also contribute to the Demonic Path and the Sacred Sect!"

"You want to surrender?" Lu Yang raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise in his expression. "With True Monarchs overseeing the battle, you actually dare to surrender?"

This Path Seizing War was personally supervised by three True Monarchs. Although they wouldn't interfere directly, how could anything happening here be hidden from them? In such a situation, who would dare to surrender? In the Sacred Sect, if you dared to surrender and survived, your physical body would be used by a True Monarch to light a sky lantern. If you died, your soul would be used to light a soul lamp. Reincarnation would be out of the question!

"Senior, you misunderstand. We in the Pure Land have our own rules; it cannot be generalized." Guangming lowered his voice, speaking cautiously. "For us, surrendering is not a big deal. As long as we survive, we won't be blamed."

"Oh?" Lu Yang's eyebrows twitched slightly, then he smiled meaningfully. "Then if I ask you to go back as an undercover agent and deal with the remaining Buddhist cultivators of the Pure Land for me, would you still be willing?"

"Uh, this..." Guangming's expression froze upon hearing this, then he opened his mouth and spoke even softer: "...It's really hard to explain things within the Pure Land. How about the Daoist Court instead?"

Lu Yang was even more astonished, bursting into laughter. "That works too!"

As soon as these words were out, Guangming immediately relaxed and hurriedly said, "Actually, this humble monk has long been annoyed by those people in the Daoist Court. I am willing to contribute to Senior!"

Meanwhile, outside the battle realm.

The three True Monarchs exchanged glances. Qingcheng Feixue True Monarch, who had previously remained silent, finally spoke, a pleasant laugh like silver bells escaping her lips.

"The Pure Land Buddhist Sect truly lives up to its reputation!"

"...Demon, don't try to sow discord!" Feeling the menacing gaze of the Daoist Court True Monarch beside him, the Pure Land True Monarch could only maintain a stern expression, secretly transmitting a message: "Fellow Daoist, don't overthink it. It's merely a feigned compliance, a temporary expedient! Moreover, Guangming is just a pawn; the real leader is Guanghai. He is Volong's disciple, and he prioritizes the big picture; he wouldn't act rashly."

"Hmph, hard to say!" Facing the Pure Land True Monarch's explanation, the Daoist Court True Monarch remained noncommittal, clearly not entirely believing the Pure Land True Monarch's words.

The Pure Land's origins were not clean, after all. It was said that the Supreme World-Honored One who founded the Pure Land was a shameless character back in the day, who only ascended to the position of Dao Lord by playing both sides. The actions of that World-Honored One were indistinguishable from those of the current Sacred Sect! Even their original name wasn't "Deep Joy Pure Land" but "Pure Land Heretical Sect"! It was only after that World-Honored One founded the Deep Joy Nirvana Dao that he chose to whitewash his past and subsequently prospered. As such, for the sake of the venerable, no one dared to speak ill of it.

Thinking of this, a shadow fell over the Daoist Court True Monarch's heart, but at the same time, immense curiosity arose about the suddenly appearing Lu Yang.

What was this person's origin? He was tempted to perform a divination, but with Qingcheng Feixue True Monarch right there, such an attempt would only be obstructed, rendering it meaningless. So, he had no choice but to give up.

In the end, Lu Yang spared Guangming's life. From him, and from the other Buddhist cultivators captured into the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, Lu Yang learned of an unfavorable situation: they had been surrounded. The Pure Land's Eight Buddhist Legions and a Daoist Court's Guardian Army, totaling over a thousand Qi Refining cultivators, had already gathered, forming an encirclement and setting up defenses along the way. All of the Sacred Sect's participating disciples had fallen into this encirclement, and their living space was constantly being squeezed.

"Formations..." As a seventh-rank formation master, Lu Yang was keenly aware of the power of formations. He wasn't afraid of sheer numbers, but many formations could be troublesome. Especially since there were clearly cultivators with high statuses within both the Daoist Court and the Pure Land. Although they couldn't be higher than him, as the saying goes, "many ants can kill an elephant." If supported by a large number of formations, it would still be quite tricky for him. Moreover, these two factions likely had stronger trump cards hidden.

So, in the end, he accepted Guangming's voluntary surrender. After planting a monitoring restriction in his sea of consciousness, he spared his life. Of course, Lu Yang had considered directly transforming him into a Banner Spirit with the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner. However, unless it was someone like Chen Xin'an or Su Nü, whose original bodies still existed in the current world and whose karma could be applied, the Qi mechanisms of most ordinary Banner Spirits differed significantly from those of cultivators, making it difficult to escape the detection of a discerning individual.

"...Still, I need to be cautious." At this moment, Lu Yang had reined in his surging ambition. Even when bullying the weak in a "novice village," he wanted to ensure absolute foolproofness, lest he stumble in a simple task. "If I were in Skeleton Mountain, with the leyline's support, no matter how many came, they would all die. But away from Skeleton Mountain, relying on just Su Nü is a bit strenuous. Although if I went all out, adding Ancestor Tingyou, I would still have a definite victory, but that would inevitably result in casualties..."

This was the problem. Lu Yang wanted to kill ten thousand enemies but not lose eight thousand of his own, especially after discovering how useful Ancestor Tingyou was as a technical talent. He would feel distressed if even one of them died.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang silently turned his head to look at Qin Tianhe beside him. Although it was commonly said that war always came with sacrifices, since he didn't want to make sacrifices, he could only find a way to sacrifice others.

"Tianhe, how many people did the Sacred Sect send this time?"

Looking at Lu Yang's amiable smile, Qin Tianhe felt not the slightest warmth; instead, he shivered intensely, feeling completely cold. Something was wrong! However, under Lu Yang's gaze, Qin Tianhe then thought, *So what if something's wrong? As long as it doesn't harm Tianhe himself, what do the lives of others matter to him?*

"Including me, seven True Disciples participated in the battle. In addition, eleven Qi Refining Grand Completion disciples who haven't cultivated Great Divine Abilities came. The remaining hundred-plus are all late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, and they also possess one or two powerful divine abilities. I just don't know how many are left now." Qin Tianhe recounted in detail, as if listing family treasures. "The Path Seizing War has been going on for a while. I guess they should have gathered together. If we head deeper into the encirclement, we can definitely find them."

"I see." Lu Yang nodded upon hearing this, his smile growing even brighter.

Over a hundred late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, eleven Qi Refining Grand Completion cultivators, and seven True Disciples. This number was actually not inferior to the Daoist Court and Pure Land, perhaps even superior. From this, it was clear that although the Sacred Sect had fewer disciples than the Daoist Court and Pure Land, the quality of the disciples who could stand out in the Sacred Sect was beyond doubt. These were all talents!

Afterward, Lu Yang followed Qin Tianhe's suggestion, letting him maneuver the "Void-Piercing Sky-遁烏梭 Shuttle" to travel around. Before long, a formation came into view. As Qin Tianhe said, the Sacred Sect disciples, though wicked, were definitely not weak. Even when caught off guard by the combined assault of the Daoist Court and Pure Land, they still managed to organize themselves.
