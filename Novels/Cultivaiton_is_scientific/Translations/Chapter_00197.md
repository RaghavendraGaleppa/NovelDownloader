# Chapter 197: Reunion  

Liang Yexuan felt extremely awkward. Had she known it would be like this, she wouldn't have followed along.  

Standing beside Yin Shilan as a peerless beauty, she found the male cultivator's gaze fixed solely on Yin Shilan, completely oblivious to her presence.  

Li Shimin landed on the deck, locking eyes with Yin Shilan. In that moment, everything else faded away, leaving only the two of them in the world.  

"Lan'er!" he called softly.  

Yin Shilan abandoned all restraint and threw herself into his arms, holding him tightly.  

Sunlight bathed them, casting a faint glow around their figures.  

The radiance was so dazzling that Liang Yexuan, standing nearby, felt it piercing her eyes. She coughed loudly to remind them of her presence.  

The sound snapped the two out of their reverie. Yin Shilan, her face flushed like peach blossoms, lowered her head in embarrassment.  

"Lan'er, and this fellow Daoist, let's rest in the palace!" Li Shimin said with a smile, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Yin Shilan.  

"I'm Liang Yexuan, Yin Shilan's senior sister!" Liang Yexuan emphasized her identity, making it clear she wasn't just any fellow Daoist.  

"Ah, Senior Sister Liang!" Li Shimin, recognizing her temperament, bowed with a smile.  

Pleased by the respectful address, Liang Yexuan nodded in satisfaction before descending into the palace with Yin Shilan.  

In the palace courtyard, Chu Gang had long since disappeared. As a mere late-stage Qi Refining cultivator stationed there, he had nothing suitable to offer two True Disciples. It was better to stay out of sight.  

Besides, he had witnessed the scene in the sky earlier. Staying would only make him an unwelcome third wheel.  

Li Shimin brought out spirit tea—the same batch from years ago. After long cultivation, its quality had improved significantly, especially after being roasted in his Machine Room Space, bringing out its finest flavors.  

Of course, for Foundation Establishment cultivators, first-grade spirit tea was little more than a refreshing drink.  

Yin Shilan took a small sip, her eyes lighting up with delight. She recognized it as the same tea served during her first visit to Li Shimin's cave dwelling.  

Their eyes met, and understanding passed between them, bringing smiles to their faces.  

Liang Yexuan, sipping the tea, found it unremarkable. She couldn't fathom why the two had such a reaction to it.  

Li Shimin glanced at her helplessly, feeling her presence was entirely superfluous.  

Unfortunately, Liang Yexuan remained blissfully unaware, leisurely drinking her tea while perking up her ears, eager to catch their conversation.  

"Shimin, when did you reach Foundation Establishment?" Yin Shilan asked. Though she had read his jade slip, his account had been brief, omitting hardships and focusing only on the positive. She wanted to know everything about him.  

---  

"After arriving at the Hundred Thousand Mountains, I realized my Qi Refining cultivation was insufficient. I found an upper-grade spiritual vein and stayed to cultivate for a while. Unexpectedly, I broke through to Foundation Establishment!" Li Shimin replied casually.  

"You're so lucky to find an upper-grade spiritual vein!" Liang Yexuan interjected.  

Li Shimin smiled but said nothing. Clearly, Liang Yexuan was a sheltered flower, unaware of how rare such a find was among rogue cultivators.  

"But how did you cross the North Sea at Qi Refining stage?" Yin Shilan frowned, spotting the inconsistency.  

"After you left Tianhai Sect, I began crafting a one-time-use flying artifact to cross the North Sea. On the day Mingxin Sect attacked, I took the risk and used it to escape from my cave dwelling, crossing to North Shu Continent," Li Shimin explained casually.  

His words weren't entirely false—the rocket, in a way, was a disposable flying artifact. The only difference was that while most relied on spiritual energy, his used liquid hydrogen as fuel, protected by spiritual energy.  

"Are there powerful sea beasts in the North Sea? Did you encounter any?" Liang Yexuan chimed in again.  

She had read sect records describing the North Sea.  

The ocean was a forbidden zone for cultivators, fraught with danger—even for Golden Core cultivators, though the risks were relatively lower.  

Li Shimin recalled the illusory giant he had encountered. The terror of that moment still lingered, causing his expression to darken slightly.  

Yin Shilan sensed his unease and gently took his hand.  

The warmth in his palm dispelled the gloom in his heart.  

"One day, I'll slay it," he vowed silently.  

"Yes," he replied simply.  

Liang Yexuan sensed the shift in mood and wisely refrained from further questions.  

She was deeply curious about Li Shimin. A Qi Refining cultivator crossing the perilous North Sea with a self-made disposable artifact? It was hard to believe. Yet, Yin Shilan's unwavering trust in him was evident.  

"In your jade slip, you mentioned reconsidering joining Illusionary Spirit Sect. Why?" Yin Shilan asked.  

Li Shimin glanced at Liang Yexuan, hesitating.  

"Don't worry about Senior Sister Liang. She knows North Shu's sects better than I do. Share your thoughts—she might have useful insights," Yin Shilan said, blinking at him.  

---  

"Indeed! When it comes to knowledge of North Shu's sects, no one in our sect knows more than I do!" Liang Yexuan declared proudly.  

She was privy to countless rumors, even gossip about her sect's Golden Core elders.  

"I currently have two options. First, Master Luo's recommendation to join Illusionary Spirit Sect as an outer disciple. Second, an opportunity I encountered in North Shu to join Mount Shu Sect as an inner disciple. Senior Sister Liang, could you compare the pros and cons?" Li Shimin bowed respectfully.  

Liang Yexuan stood and paced thoughtfully, putting on an air of contemplation.  

"Li Shimin, what's your spiritual root aptitude?" she asked seriously, knowing this affected her friend's beloved's future.  

"Triple Spiritual Roots," he answered truthfully.  

"Illusionary Spirit Sect—your starting point would be low as an outer disciple. But with Shilan and me around, no one would dare bully you. However, with triple roots, advancing to inner disciple would be difficult. Worse, if your relationship with Shilan becomes known, you'll face endless trouble, especially on missions," Liang Yexuan analyzed slowly.  

Li Shimin nodded. He didn't want to rely on Yin Shilan's connections. With ample spirit stones, advanced formation mastery, and decent combat strength, he could stand on his own.  

Liang Yexuan's concerns were valid. A beauty like Yin Shilan, once publicly attached, would make her partner a target—both overtly and covertly.  

At Tianhai Sect, Elder Yin's protection had deterred such threats. But at Illusionary Spirit Sect, Master Luo's indifference meant Li Shimin would only receive outer disciple status, despite being an advanced formation master and Yin Shilan's beloved.  

"Li Shimin, what techniques are you proficient in?" Liang Yexuan asked, pleased he was listening attentively.  

"Thunder techniques and flying swords," he replied after a moment's thought.  

"Illusionary Spirit Sect excels in illusionary arts. While we have a wide collection of techniques, the complete legacies mostly revolve around illusions." Here, she paused, covering her mouth as if she'd said too much.  

Though seemingly simple, this touched on sect secrets.  

Complete legacies weren't just any acquired techniques. Those lacked the generations of insights left by cultivators who had mastered them to the Nascent Soul stage—critical for breakthroughs.  

Most major sects' Nascent Souls never mastered non-core techniques, as key parts were often orally transmitted or omitted. Thus, complete legacies were a sect's most treasured assets.  

"Senior Sister Liang, could you tell me about Mount Shu Sect?" Li Shimin pretended not to notice her slip.  

"Mount Shu Sect has Nascent Soul ancestors specializing in both sword and spell techniques, meaning they possess complete legacies for both. Also, as allies of Illusionary Spirit Sect, joining them wouldn't hinder your meetings with Shilan," Liang Yexuan explained.  

This was privileged information—ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn't know about Mount Shu's Nascent Souls. She had overheard it from her father, a Golden Core elder, during private conversations.  

"So, you're saying Mount Shu Sect is the better choice?" Li Shimin asked.  

"If you can enter as an inner disciple, absolutely. Inner disciples enjoy vastly superior resources and easier access to Golden Core elders."  

She hesitated, glancing at Yin Shilan before adding, "Your aptitude is poor. Inner disciple status is rare—even in Illusionary Spirit Sect, it'd be nearly impossible."  

Li Shimin wasn't concerned. His cultivation speed might be slow, but the 'Five Elements Qi Absorption Array' ensured steady progress. Once his spiritual lake was full, he could advance to mid-Foundation Establishment—a feat others couldn't match without extensive resource expenditure.  

"Lan'er, what do you think?" Li Shimin asked softly.  

"Shimin, prioritize your cultivation," Yin Shilan replied gently.  

As cultivators, they understood the balance between fleeting reunions and lasting companionship. With nearly two centuries at Foundation Establishment and five hundred at Golden Core, they could afford patience.  

Elder Yin had already warned Li Shimin—they must wait until Golden Core to truly be together.  

Liang Yexuan, feeling ignored, decided to assert her seniority.  

"Li Shimin, as a new Foundation Establishment cultivator, you must lack combat experience. Let me guide you and assess your skills!" she declared, interrupting their moment.  

"Is this necessary?" Li Shimin asked, perplexed.  

"Since Senior Sister is interested, humor her," Yin Shilan said, knowing Liang Yexuan wouldn't relent otherwise.  

They moved to a remote area outside the city, with Yin Shilan as referee.  

"Li Shimin, you attack first!" Liang Yexuan said magnanimously.  

As a True Disciple of Illusionary Spirit Sect, though newly advanced, she was confident.  

"Then I won't hold back," Li Shimin replied solemnly.  

With a flick of his finger, a sword light shot toward her. He didn't use the Nine Palaces Sword Formation, only a single central sword.  

Liang Yexuan waved a handkerchief embroidered with phoenixes. The phoenixes came to life, flying off the fabric to intercept the sword light.  

Startled by the eerie spiritual artifact, Li Shimin channeled sword intent from his Sword Bone, doubling its potency.  

The sword light slashed through one phoenix, eliciting a shrill cry as its form flickered, nearly dissipating.  

"Sword intent! My Phoenix Handkerchief!" Liang Yexuan cried out, hastily retracting the artifact to inspect the damage.  

The Phoenix Handkerchief was designed for Illusionary Spirit Sect techniques. Against ordinary cultivators, its twin phoenixes were formidable—but not against a sword intent wielder.
