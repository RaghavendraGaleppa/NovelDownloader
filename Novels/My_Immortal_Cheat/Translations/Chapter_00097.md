Chapter 97: An Old Friend I Haven't Seen in Eight Years Has Returned!

In a flash, Zhou Tian's figure flickered, appearing outside the cage, then returning inside.

He waited for a long time, but no one or energy construct came to check.

"That's it?"

Zhou Tian muttered to himself. The tribunal's security was too lax. He had expected guards every three steps, sentries every five.

Appearing outside the cage again, Zhou Tian walked towards Zhang Yi's cage.

Boom!

A cage erupted in white flames. A human-like creature with a single black horn violently slammed against the metal bars of the cage. Its purple tail, covered in sharp spikes, thumped against the floor. Blisters appeared on its skin, bursting open to spill blood that instantly evaporated, only for dark energy to surge through its flesh, instantly repairing the wounds, only for them to rupture again in a continuous cycle.

It was evident that these white flames not only burned the physical body but also inflicted damage upon the soul. Even so, the creature's inky black eyes were fixed on Zhou Tian, its mouth agaped without teeth, emitting wisps of black smoke that dispersed in the flames, as if trying to say something.

Zhou Tian glanced at the creature and then looked away. He didn't need to think to know what it was wondering: wasn't it just curious why he could get out?

Boom!

Boom!

As he walked, creatures periodically appeared in the cages on either side. Some, their minds in turmoil, violently crashed against the bars, igniting bursts of holy flames. Others, clear-minded, stood quietly behind the bars, watching Zhou Tian, their eyes flickering with myriad thoughts.

Zhou Tian ignored them all and proceeded towards Zhang Yi's location from his memory. As he drew closer to Zhang Yi's cage, one bald-headed figure after another emerged, their eyes wide with shock as they looked at Zhou Tian. They had tried the seals on these cages themselves and found them utterly unbreakable. How could Zhou Tian have broken free?

Zhou Tian glanced at the bald-headed men and raised an eyebrow. *How could you possibly comprehend my realm?*

Zhang Yi also stepped forward, his eyes filled with astonishment. Zhou Tian smiled, his figure blurring, and appeared beside Zhang Yi.

"Zhou Tian, you..."

Zhang Yi was even more surprised, but before he could finish speaking, Zhou Tian interrupted him.

"Don't ask. Just know it's from hard work."

Zhang Yi gave a helpless smile. "Alright." Since Zhou Tian didn't want to elaborate, he wouldn't press further.

"Given that your divine ability can break through the seals of these cages, logically there shouldn't be anything they can use to trap you. So why did you allow the Holy God Cult to capture you?" Zhang Yi asked, a new question forming in his mind.

"Why?" Zhou Tian cast a sideways glance at Zhang Yi. "Wasn't it to save you? I thought only those bald guys were captured, but then I saw your name on the list of detainees, so I came."

"Uh..." Zhang Yi was stunned, unsure what to say. In his opinion, Zhou Tian had gambled with his life. One wrong move and he would have been stuck here. Any words of thanks felt hollow.

"Alright, no need for such mushy talk. Just lick me more after we get out." Zhou Tian waved his hand. He couldn't stand sentimental words either. For two grown men, everything was best left unsaid.

*Lick me?* Zhang Yi's expression turned strange. He considered that perhaps dying here would be a better option.

"What did you mean just now? Is this tribunal really that powerful?" Zhou Tian changed the subject, asking, "What did you mean by 'if you can break through the seals here, there's basically nothing the Holy God Cult can use to trap me?' Is this place really that incredible? There isn't even a single guard."

"This tribunal is not simple," Zhang Yi shook his head and continued, "This tribunal was not built by the current Holy God Cult, but rather is an ancient relic. In ancient times, the Divine Realm was filled with many gods, and the Holy God Cult, as one of the most powerful religions of that era, had no shortage of enemies. Thus, they established these tribunals to imprison and interrogate their foes."

"The Holy God Cult of that era was incomparable to the current one. They were incredibly powerful themselves, and their enemies were equally formidable. These cages were designed to imprison enemies of the Great Emperor level. As for these bars..." Zhang Yi pointed at the bars of the cage and explained, "The material is Heterocrystal Black Iron, which is what we call Black-Patterned Dragon Steel. Not only is it incredibly sturdy, but it also has a magic-suppressing effect. Combined with the seals carved upon it, it's enough to prevent anyone inside the cage from using even a trace of their magical power. What's even stranger is that once you touch the holy flames on the cage, they will burn you, but your own magical power will also be unsealed, automatically healing your wounds, preventing you from even seeking death."

"Because there were many evil gods in ancient times, with an abundance of strange and詭異 methods, including many blasphemous arts. Even without using magical power, merely relying on speech, or gaze, or even certain body movements, was enough to control a person's mind."

"Therefore, when it was designed, even the movements and facial expressions of those in the cages could be sealed. But with the passage of time, it has been left unmaintained, and many of its functions have failed. Now, it can only seal sound. That's why there's only an ancient energy construct left here to guard it."

"After all, it's not like the glorious era of ancient times. The Holy God Cult now is just a few 'big cats and kittens'. They don't have that many highly cultivated individuals to guard this place. And as for ordinary guards who succumb to mental confusion and kill each other, there aren't just one or two cases. Over time, the Holy God Cult stopped sending people to guard it, because no one could escape anyway."

"Oh, really? Even a few 'big cats and kittens' managed to catch you." Zhou Tian chuckled.

"That was an accident," Zhang Yi said awkwardly.

"What exactly happened back then? Logically, they shouldn't have given up on you," Zhou Tian asked. This was a question that had always puzzled him. Zhang Yi was not some expendable character.

"When the ancient ship exploded, coupled with the divine spear's power, the released energy was enormous. However, that divine spear had been greatly weakened, and with the best efforts of the two seniors protecting us, many present also had life-saving trump cards. Very few died directly; most were rogue cultivators without backing, but they all suffered injuries to varying degrees," Zhang Yi said, frowning, his eyes flickering as he recalled the situation.

"But before we even landed, people from the Holy God Cult emerged, along with many others trying to fish in troubled waters. Although the two seniors were severely wounded, they were Heavenly Kings after all, and they were confident in dealing with a chaotic army that didn't even have a Great Emperor. However, the Pope of the Holy God Cult directly summoned two illusory Holy Emissaries, just like Gabriel in the Void Storm, both with six pairs of wings, their strength comparable to a Half-step Heavenly King."

"The two seniors couldn't fight them, so they could only retreat with us. The senior from the Instrument Nation and the senior from the Dao Alliance sacrificed themselves. The Fool has a close relationship with us, and the Treasure Gathering Pavilion also cooperates with us, so we could only treat those monks as弃子 (sacrificed pawns)."

Zhang Yi slowly recounted the scene to Zhou Tian, who wasn't overly surprised; he could guess most of it.

"What about you, then? How were you caught?"

"Uh..." Zhang Yi's eyes drifted, and he said awkwardly, "My luck was a bit bad. I fell directly into the enemy's camp, and there was no way to save me."
