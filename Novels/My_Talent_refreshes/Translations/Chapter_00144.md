# Chapter 144: Hidden Spirit Vein

Chu Ning lifted the talisman ring in his hand, depleting all the true talisman spells within. He then casually patted his storage pouch and took out five Blazing Fire Talismans. After the fifteen-minute cooldown of the true talisman spells in the ring passed, he integrated all five Blazing Fire Talismans into it.

At this moment, Chu Ning saw a crimson talisman pattern appear in the center of the talisman ring in his palm.

"Talisman Seed!" Chu Ning immediately muttered softly.

After his last major breakthrough, Chu Ning had uncovered the hidden talent of his True Talisman Spirit Body. After a true talisman spell was used a hundred times, it could condense into a talisman seed, allowing him to cast the spell without the aid of a talisman ring. Chu Ning had previously integrated and used many Blazing Fire Talismans. After condensing another 5 just now, he had reached the hundred-use threshold. Chu Ning could now sense that even if the few true talisman spells in his ring were depleted, he could still easily cast this spell.

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately raised his hand, and five forearm-sized pillars of fire shot out, instantly depleting the true talisman spells in his ring. Then, his eyes gleaming, he looked at the talisman pattern in his palm.

"The second talent of the Noon Fire Spirit Body is to double the attack power of fire-attribute offensive spells. I just don't know if this effect also applies to the spell transformed from the Blazing Fire Talisman's talisman seed."

As he thought this, spiritual energy surged around Chu Ning, flowing into the talisman seed in his palm. Once a true talisman spell condensed into a talisman seed, it became no different from a spell he cultivated himself. Naturally, it was no longer like a talisman; it required his own spiritual energy to cast.

The next moment, Chu Ning raised his hand. Instantly, a blazing flame, thick as a bowl, shot out from Chu Ning's hand and directly struck the wall made of spirit stone. Immediately, sparks flew everywhere within the stone chamber.

"It actually works!" Chu Ning's eyes lit up. Whether from the thickness of the flame or the fluctuations of spiritual energy, he could clearly feel the difference in this flame compared to before. In terms of the power of a single flame, it had indeed doubled.

"I've already mastered a fire-attribute spell. Let's just call it the Blazing Flame Art!" Chu Ning smiled faintly. Then, a jade slip appeared in his hand—it was precisely the Blazing Flame Incantation. "This cultivation method is said to be incredibly difficult to master. I'm going to give it a try."

Muttering to himself, Chu Ning carefully sensed the spell incantation within the jade slip. After a long while, Chu Ning looked up, a thoughtful expression in his eyes. "The initial cultivation of this Blazing Flame Incantation doesn't involve directly conjuring demonic beasts. Instead, it starts with very basic Fireball Arts to improve one's fire manipulation abilities."

Chu Ning felt a slight surprise, but his hands were already in motion. Raising both hands, a fireball appeared in each. Chu Ning didn't cast them out but slowly brought the two fireballs closer. "Boom!" The moment the two fireballs touched, they immediately exploded. Chu Ning instantly cast a defensive spell to protect himself from being burned. He then shook his head, conjured two more fireballs, and attempted to merge them. This time, less than a tenth of the two fireballs merged before they exploded again.

Chu Ning wasn't discouraged and tried again. Time and time again, Chu Ning forgot about food and sleep, until he had tried hundreds of times. The two fireballs in Chu Ning's left and right hands finally merged without exploding. Surprisingly, the two fireballs, once merged, did not grow larger. The fireball remained the same size as before.

"If this single fireball is cast, its power will be more than double that of the previous ones! And with the bonus from my Noon Fire Spirit Body's spells, if used in a fight, it could probably cause someone a huge loss. However, according to this Blazing Flame Incantation, it's not just about merging two fireballs. It requires a full 10!" Chu Ning's eyes flickered, illuminated by the flames.

But he also knew that achieving this wouldn't be easy. The current fireball merging process was still very slow, completely unfeasible in combat. To truly achieve merged fireball attacks in combat, the merging must be completed instantly at the moment of casting in the same hand. Such a difficulty was more than 10 times higher than the previous merging. To achieve this, there was no other way but extensive practice. Thus, Chu Ning began repeating the fireball merging technique.

A day later, Chu Ning exited the stone chamber. His mind was still replaying the process of his Blazing Flame Incantation cultivation. "With my Noon Fire Spirit Body's talent, the speed of merging these two fireballs only improved slightly after a day. To truly achieve instant merging, it would probably be extremely difficult to complete without ten days to half a month of cultivation. And this is just the most basic part. No wonder they say this Blazing Flame Incantation is extremely difficult to cultivate."

Chu Ning muttered to himself, now having a clear direction for his next cultivation focus. First, he would achieve instant casting of the Fireball Art, and then perfect the merging of two fireballs. After that, he would increase the number of fireballs.

During this time, Chu Ning didn't plan to just stay and cultivate. There were also rogue cultivator transactions here; the talismans in his possession could still be sold. This would also be his means of earning spirit stones in the Thousand Lakes and Islands. He knew his own situation; while having the Tiger Wood Spirit Body and Noon Fire Spirit Body indeed accelerated his cultivation speed, maintaining his current cultivation speed was inseparable from various resources. To maintain this cultivation speed in the future, these resources naturally had to keep up. Spirit stones were absolutely indispensable.

Chu Ning did not plan to sell certain specific talismans learned from the Azure Stream Sect here. After all, they were too sensitive; Chu Ning was worried that some clues might leak out. However, common talismans like low-grade elementary Blazing Fire Talismans, Profound Ice Talismans, and Spring Recovery Talismans were fine. As for higher-grade ones, he had other preparations. These past few days, by analyzing talisman origins, he had mastered not only the methods for crafting Sword Sealing Talismans and Profound Water Spirit Talismans, but also several other types of talismans. Displaying low-grade intermediate talismans might be a bit too showy, but elementary-grade mid-tier and high-tier talismans were perfectly suitable for sale. Establishing a reputation as a talisman master among rogue cultivators now would also be somewhat helpful for his plan to join an island recruitment drive ten days later.

Chu Ning arrived at the rogue cultivator trading area. He casually found an empty spot, set up a table, and then took out all the various talismans he had. At the same time, he set up a sign next to it, listing the prices of various talismans. He had already inquired in the market of Thousand Illusions Island beforehand. He learned that throughout the Thousand Lakes and Islands, the level of talisman crafting was not very high, with very few intermediate-grade talismans. As for elementary-grade talismans, they were available, but their prices were about twenty percent higher than what Chu Ning had seen in Yanji Market. Most other magic tools and pills were also priced similarly. This was probably the disadvantage of not having a large sect: it was quite difficult to cultivate a large number of talents in cultivation arts like alchemy, talisman crafting, artifact forging, and formations without systematic training and inheritance. Formations were an exception due to the Cen family's presence. It was said that the Cen family's ancestor had once obtained an ancient formation inheritance, and the family indeed possessed great talent in understanding formations.

After Chu Ning displayed his talismans, it wasn't long before people came forward to inquire about buying them. Although Chu Ning's talisman crafting methods were obtained by analyzing talisman origins, the quality of the talismans he produced was equal to or even higher than those he had learned from spirit talisman techniques previously. Furthermore, his prices were not higher. Almost everyone who came to look ended up purchasing.

"It seems there won't be few people using talismans in the Thousand Island Competition twenty days from now." Chu Ning thought, but he wasn't afraid. When it came to using talismans, who could have more advantage than him? Even if others had them, no one would be willing to use them as lavishly as he did.

Over the next ten days, Chu Ning spent two to three hours daily selling talismans at the rogue cultivator area. The rest of the time, he stayed in the stone chamber at the inn to cultivate, and time passed quite quickly.

This day, Chu Ning left the inn but did not head towards the talisman selling area. Instead, he went directly to a large plaza on the southern side of Thousand Illusions Island. This would be the venue for the Thousand Island Competition ten days later. At the same time, various islands in need of recruits would also conduct their recruitment drives here in advance.

During this period, Chu Ning had already read through all the information on the jade slip provided by Chen Wangdao. Although this place was known as the Thousand Lakes and Islands, there were only about four to five hundred islands genuinely inhabited and cultivated by cultivators. The remaining islands either lacked spirit veins, or were occupied by demonic beasts and unsuitable for cultivators to reside on. Among these islands, not only did their sizes vary, but their spiritual energy concentrations also differed greatly.

Chu Ning had already identified a few targets previously. Upon entering the plaza, he sought them out by name.

"Our Hanshui Island has already filled its quota."

"Foundation Establishment Eighth Layer. If fellow Daoist had contacted us earlier, we might have considered it. But now, our Maple Ridge Island has already filled its quota."

"Full..."

After visiting several islands consecutively, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly. These islands were indeed recruiting, but many had already invited people known to their resident cultivators. Someone like Chu Ning, who had no one to recommend him, couldn't find a suitable place to join for a while.

After Chu Ning circled around again, his eyes couldn't help but flicker. Several of the islands he had initially considered were no longer recruiting. Even some of the top-ranked large islands that he hadn't particularly wanted to associate with were no longer recruiting at this moment. Only some of the smaller islands with first-tier spirit veins even proactively approached Chu Ning when they saw him. If a Foundation Establishment Eighth Layer cultivator like Chu Ning joined them, they would naturally be extremely welcoming. However, those small islands with first-tier spirit veins truly couldn't meet Chu Ning's cultivation requirements.

"Fellow Daoist, please!" Just as Chu Ning was hesitating, a voice rang out. Chu Ning turned his head to look and saw a yellow-robed cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Eighth Layer standing not far from him.

The cultivator, around fifty years old, saw Chu Ning look over and immediately cupped his hands, saying: "I am Tian Xiangfei. Is fellow Daoist also looking for an island to settle on? I wonder if you would be interested in chatting with me and a few other fellow Daoists."

Chu Ning glanced at the other party, shook his head, and said: "I don't know fellow Daoist, I'm not interested."

Tian Xiangfei heard this, saw Chu Ning about to leave, and immediately smiled faintly: "Fellow Daoist, please wait. I've noticed you've been wandering here for a while but haven't found a suitable island to join. I and a few other fellow Daoists are in a similar situation. We intend to form a team to directly contend for island qualifications, and we'd like to invite fellow Daoist to join."

Chu Ning, who had been about to leave, looked at the other party with a slight surprise upon hearing this. "Form a team to contend for island qualifications?"

Chu Ning pondered for a moment and understood the meaning of these words. Chen Wangdao had indeed told him before that the Thousand Island Competition was not just about various islands competing to win management rights over better islands. At the same time, if a cultivator believed themselves to be stronger than the island masters, they could also issue a challenge. As long as they won, they could correspondingly obtain the qualification of an island master. As for the original island master, whether they stayed or sought another island, that would be decided by the new island master.

However, this method had one rule: the number of challengers could only be half the number of cultivators participating in the competition from the original island. Therefore, relatively few people chose this method. After all, the island masters had operated these islands for many years, and there were many late-Foundation Establishment cultivators on their islands. For a newly formed team, it was not an easy feat to successfully challenge with only half the number of late-Foundation Establishment cultivators. In addition, to use this method, a large sum of spirit stones had to be paid to the Thousand Island Alliance. If the challenge failed, these spirit stones would belong to the challenged party.

Chu Ning quickly ran this matter through his mind and shook his head, saying: "Sorry, I'm not interested." Chu Ning truly had no interest in suddenly teaming up with strangers to contend for islands. If it were just challenges between islands, swapping islands would indeed create grudges. But after all, such situations were common in every Thousand Island Competition, and everyone was accustomed to it. However, directly seizing an island from someone else was different; that kind of enmity would run deep. The masters of these various islands had managed them for many years and had accumulated connections. Openly making such deep enemies did not align with Chu Ning's original intention of stable development.

Seeing that Chu Ning didn't agree, the middle-aged cultivator gave him a deep look and then left. Chu Ning, meanwhile, continued to stroll around. After all, there were hundreds of islands with spiritual energy here, and he wanted to see if there were any suitable ones.

After walking a few more steps, another person appeared before Chu Ning—a middle-aged cultivator who looked to be in his forties. "Fellow Daoist, I am Jiang Hongguang, Island Master of Flying Rainbow Island. May I ask if fellow Daoist is looking for an island to join?"

Flying Rainbow Island? Hearing the person claim to be the island master, information about this island immediately flashed through Chu Ning's mind. This island was considered mid-to-low-tier among the Thousand Lakes and Islands, possessing a single first-tier spirit vein of medium quality. However, this spirit vein was truly too small, so despite the island's considerable size, it was not well-known throughout the Thousand Lakes and Islands.

"I am indeed looking for an island to join, but the quality and size of your Flying Rainbow Island's spirit vein are not ideal for me."

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Jiang Hongguang didn't get annoyed. After a brief look, he suddenly transmitted a message: "Fellow Daoist, could we speak in private for a moment?" Meeting Chu Ning's puzzled gaze, the man continued to transmit: "Our island has recently discovered a new spirit vein. If there are no surprises, it should be a second-tier spirit vein."

Chu Ning, who had originally shown no interest, revealed a hint of surprise in his eyes upon hearing this. He continued to look at Jiang Hongguang. After the latter nodded again at this moment, Chu Ning also transmitted: "Fellow Daoist Jiang, let's find a place to discuss this in detail."

Hearing this, Jiang Hongguang's face immediately lit up with joy. He pointed a finger and then led Chu Ning to the side. Within this plaza, every island had a high platform. Smaller islands had platforms about one *zhang* (3.3 meters) in area, while larger islands had several *zhang*. Each island's spot was surrounded by a restrictive formation, which had both sound-insulating and a certain defensive effect. This somewhat surprised Chu Ning.

Entering the Flying Rainbow Island platform, Chu Ning saw two people seated inside, both of whom were women. Jiang Hongguang pointed to a beautiful middle-aged woman of similar age next to him and the younger woman, saying: "This is my Dao companion Yu Yuanxiu, and my younger sister Jiang Lan. May I ask fellow Daoist's name?"

Chu Ning cupped his hands towards the three, "I am Chu Ning. Just now, fellow Daoist mentioned..."

"Fellow Daoist, please wait!" Jiang Hongguang interrupted Chu Ning, then casually took out a talisman. Seeing that the other party had taken out a sound-insulating talisman, Chu Ning said nothing. Jiang Hongguang activated the talisman, and instantly, a light barrier enveloped the four of them.

Only then did Jiang Hongguang speak: "My apologies, Fellow Daoist Chu, I am accustomed to being cautious."

Chu Ning smiled and did not reply. Jiang Hongguang then continued: "Fellow Daoist Chu, from what you just said, you must have had some prior understanding of our Flying Rainbow Island. Indeed, Flying Rainbow Island only has one small first-tier spirit vein, which is why only the three of us in our family managed this island previously. But recently, we unexpectedly discovered a second-tier spirit vein within."

As Jiang Hongguang spoke, he kept a close eye on Chu Ning's expression. Seeing that Chu Ning didn't reveal too much emotion, he continued: "Although this spirit vein is not large either, it is a second-tier spirit vein after all. Supporting one or two more people in cultivation should be completely fine. At the same time, we are concerned that if other islands learn of this, they might proactively challenge us to a competition. So, we wanted to recruit another fellow Daoist to co-manage this island."

Chu Ning roughly understood the other party's intentions at this moment, and his heart stirred. He also understood why they had approached him. Among the three, Jiang Hongguang and his wife were both at the Foundation Establishment Eighth Layer, while Jiang Lan was at the Foundation Establishment Seventh Layer. His "Foundation Establishment Eighth Layer" cultivation, in their eyes, was a powerful supplement that wouldn't pose too much of a threat to them. And for Chu Ning, if the other party's words were true, it would indeed be a good choice. Having a second-tier spirit vein, and the relationships among the island's residents also not being complicated.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning spoke: "May I ask if Fellow Daoist Jiang can take me to the island to have a look? If it is truly as fellow Daoist says, I am willing to join."

"Of course, I can take fellow Daoist there now." Saying this, Jiang Hongguang dispersed the sound-insulating barrier, and then the group of four headed directly to the teleportation array on Thousand Illusions Island. The fact that every island had a teleportation array indeed made Chu Ning feel greatly convenient.

As soon as he entered Flying Rainbow Island, Chu Ning slightly sensed his surroundings, and then his brow subtly lifted. The spiritual energy here was much weaker than on Thousand Illusions Island, clearly resembling that of a first-tier spirit vein. However, since the other party claimed there was a second-tier spirit vein, Chu Ning wouldn't jump to conclusions.

"Fellow Daoist, please follow me," Jiang Hongguang said, flying ahead on his spiritual energy. Then, upon arriving at a desolate mountain on the island, he suddenly stopped. "Fellow Daoist Chu, that spirit vein is within this mountain. The spiritual energy of this vein condenses without dispersing, so it cannot be sensed from outside." As he spoke, Jiang Hongguang took out a formation flag. "To prevent anyone from accidentally trespassing, I specifically bought and set up a simple formation here."

As he spoke, Jiang Hongguang took out the formation flag and waved it. The formation's mist dispersed, and the four followed him into the heart of the mountain. Chu Ning immediately sensed a spiritual energy density completely different from the outside.

"Oh, I really didn't expect there to be a hidden spirit vein here." Chu Ning was quite surprised at this moment. A 'hidden spirit vein' refers to those spirit veins where spiritual energy condenses without dispersing due to special reasons. And now, there was one right before Chu Ning.

Chu Ning then patted his hand, releasing Little White from his spirit beast pouch. The little fellow was best at this kind of thing.

"Ying!" Under the curious gazes of the three, Little White's small head peeked out, looked around, and then sent a spiritual message to Chu Ning.

And after hearing what the little fellow said, Chu Ning directly addressed Jiang Hongguang: "Fellow Daoist Jiang, I'm joining."
