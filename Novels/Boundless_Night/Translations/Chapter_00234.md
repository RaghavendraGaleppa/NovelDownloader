# Chapter 234: Surprising Harvest

"During the last assessment at the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, held in the world's border regions, several exotic-blooded demons were slain. It's suspected he was involved in all of them. This performance vastly exceeds expectations!"

The Cui family recently investigated, and some showed grave expressions.

One must know, Cui Chongxuan has been practicing the *Six Imperial Heart Sutra* for several years and is already an extraordinary person. Even he could only flee when facing those ancient demons.

"At that time, he had only been on the New Life Path for a few months. How could he possibly suppress Chongxuan, who practices the Six Imperial Force?"

Unless Qin Ming has mastered legendary force techniques, but he has no access to forces like the Tathagata Force or Jade Clarity Force.

The only thing he's thoroughly studied and practiced since childhood is the Silk Scroll, which is precisely the result of collaborative research by multiple patriarchs.

"How is that possible? Without guidance, no one can master the Silk Scroll!"

"Nothing is set in stone. What if his talent is simply that terrifying?"

Members of the Cui family argued.

Then they recalled that Qin Ming learned everything quickly since childhood.

If he hadn't been misled onto a path destined for failure, becoming obsessed with the Silk Scroll, his other achievements would have been truly astonishing.

Looking back now, could it be that their interference actually created a monster?

"I hope we're wrong."

"We truly shouldn't have let him practice the Silk Scroll technique back then!"

Clearly, some had regrets.

In an antique study, a ruddy-faced, silver-haired old man sighed softly, "Such a good child, and you pushed him away."

He set down his teacup, tapped the table lightly, and said, "If there are doubts, then kill him as soon as possible."

"Someone is protecting him," a middle-aged woman stated.

The old man's expression was calm. "If he's ordinary, keeping him at Black and White Mountain suffices. But if he shows extraordinary talent and is already an adversary, what's the point of keeping him alive?"

Someone nodded. If not for Old Cui Seven's obstruction, Qin Ming would have died years ago, and none of this would be happening.

The silver-haired old man took a sip of tea. "He's just a household servant's child. Killing him is as easy as flicking a finger. Sooner is better than later."

"For something as significant as Kunling, who wouldn't want the Auspicious Blood? If he is truly extraordinary, he should appear and contend for it."

In the night, many exotic birds, such as lightning sparrows and thunder falcons, known for their extreme speed, darted through the dark clouds, relaying important messages.

In the Kunling territory, everyone from aristocratic families to academy disciples, major sects of various paths, and a large number of rogue cultivators had rushed here.

Outside the Third Absolute Land, shouts of battle erupted everywhere, and the plateau under the night sky had become a chaotic mess.

"Old geezers of the Third Realm, have some shame! Do you really feel accomplished harvesting little demons of the First Realm?" A vajra parrot soared across the sky, shouting loudly.

A group of experts were furious, looking up in unison. Had this bird eaten the guts of a bear and a leopard? They prepared to shoot it down.

The parrot, radiating vajra force, was dazzling in the night sky. It hastily shouted, "Everyone, these are the words of a patriarch! I'm just speaking for him. He said that if you snatch kills like this, you won't get any merit, your achievements will be deducted, and you won't get any Auspicious Blood!"

Let alone a patriarch's messenger, even a chicken at a patriarch's doorstep would have to be called a phoenix. Who would dare strike it? They all reined in their killing intent.

On the plateau, the banners of millennia-old aristocratic families fluttered, experts from beyond the mortal realm streaked across the sky with spiritual light, elite members of secret sects moved freely, and a vast number of rogue cultivators fought fiercely, their spirits high.

All factions vied with each other, the entire plateau dyed red with blood, all scrambling for battle merits.

"Everyone, only beheadings recorded by memory crystals count. Don't even think of secretly piling up spoils of war for one person to exchange for Auspicious Blood," someone loudly reminded.

People everywhere fought like mad.

In truth, the demons were also counterattacking, fearless and ferocious, putting considerable pressure on all sides, resulting in many casualties on the battlefield.

But people from all paths remained full of confidence. After all, the patriarchs had already dealt with the most powerful demon ancestors, such as the Auspicious Beasts. Could the remaining ones truly overturn the heavens?

Those major organizations, as well as the rogue cultivators, all held a psychological advantage, knowing their side would ultimately win.

Consequently, many forces fought with exhilaration, blood dyeing the plateau red.

"Nostalgia… I recall those glorious years. During the last Great Reclamation, we expanded our territory, expelled the encroaching Dark Race, and carved through tens of thousands of miles. It was truly exhilarating!"

On the edge of the plateau stood several extremely elderly figures, all with expressions of reminiscence.

At that time, various families competed, scrambling for merit deep within the Night Mist World. Some formidable individuals dared to penetrate deep behind enemy lines with just a small team, charging recklessly.

Many great families fought their way out like this, seizing vast territories, achieving great merits, and receiving generous rewards.

Every Great Expansion saw the emergence of new major powers, and even future prodigies rising to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the patriarchs.

Now, many people, witnessing the great battle on the plateau, anticipated another Great Reclamation.

Some elders hoped for their families to soar, while some powerful individuals harbored grand ambitions, wishing to find fortune deep within the Night Mist and become patriarch-level figures.

It can be said that the current Night Mist World, from top to bottom, yearned for a Great Expansion, and was close to forming a unified force.

Thus, the current scene, though merely a prelude, had already excited many.

After the vajra parrot's shouts shamed the old timers, the battlefield became clearly stratified. Everyone sought suitable opponents, leaving many opportunities for the younger generation.

Qin Ming and Little Wu also entered the battlefield. Since the older generation stopped snatching kills from demons, their harvests began to surge.

At this moment, the two had separated, like two flood dragons parting the sea, cleaving through wind and waves, forging ahead, slaying demons one after another.

Far behind them, a golden sheep, sturdier than an ox or horse, pulled an iron-plated chariot, responsible for collecting their spoils of war.

This was Jin Xiang, a graduate of the Mountain River Academy, who usually earned a living by pulling carts in Kunling City, merely to temper his heart in the mortal world.

Today, it was hired by Qin Ming and Little Wu at a high price to haul demon heads, occasionally assisting them with memory crystal recordings.

In the night sky, some elders stood on the backs of various high-grade exotic birds, overlooking the blood-stained plateau.

A man who appeared to be forty or fifty years old smiled, "Your New Life Path isn't performing well. You're always just tagging along. I don't think you'll get much Auspicious Blood this time."

"Not necessarily!" Yu Gensheng spoke.

He and Zhao Ziyuan were both here. Although they were strong individuals of the same rank, others were vibrant and skilled in preserving their youth, while the two of them were excessively aged.

This was the true state of those who walked the New Life Path to the end; they had truly endured through years, significantly older than others of the same rank, not peers.

"Is that so? Aside from the Tathagata, Six Imperial, and Heaven-Sustaining Dao traditions, I believe the New Life Path is effectively broken. None of Kunling's academies have a top-tier new-born practitioner."

"We can't control other places, but we can discuss the Kunling academies. Instead of wasting Auspicious Blood on a hopeless path, why not concentrate it and cultivate a few more incredibly talented prodigies?"

Clearly, some were dissatisfied with the performance of the New Life Path.

Though reserved, Qin Ming was not entirely low-key. He didn't use a five-colored halo to protect himself, but his various trump cards emerged frequently, slaying his way through.

"A crisis has appeared fifteen miles ahead; some Second Realm experts have perished there," an exotic bird reported in the night sky.

This battlefield had many spirit birds serving as messengers, continuously relaying information.

Upon receiving the message, Qin Ming immediately accelerated. The vegetation in the surroundings shook violently as a surge of Yi Wood essence qi lifted him forward, allowing him to traverse great distances with each bound.

Along the way, any demon blocking his path was swiftly slain by him.

Under the night sky, the plateau was filled with shouts of battle, shadows flickering as demons and humans ceaselessly clashed, staining some of the vegetation red.

"A subterranean palace, actually?" Qin Ming was surprised.

A nest of demons resided here. A mighty giant demon once appeared among their ancestors, but they had long since declined. Now, only one old demon barely reached the Third Realm, but it was also decrepit, its body decaying, with severely insufficient vitality.

Even so, it remained terrifying, having killed several people who rashly intruded.

"The old demon is finished! Let's team up and kill him!" Some youths shouted, their blood boiling, believing they could slay a great demon of the Third Realm.

Qin Ming also thought they were right; the old demon was almost rotten and couldn't hold on much longer.

He even felt that he alone would be enough.

Soon, a bloody battle erupted here. The youths occasionally shed blood, some even falling, unable to breach the defenses, causing a wave of panic.

Qin Ming stepped forward, acting amidst the crowd, a single saber strike nearly severing the old demon's shoulder, leaving its entire arm dangling and blood gushing.

"In my life, I've eaten quite a few people. Even if I die now, it won't be a loss." The old demon grinned hideously, its white hair disheveled, green eyes glowing, as it lunged forward.

Pffft!

It failed to wound Qin Ming. Instead, it was struck by another saber, its other arm nearly severed.

"Good! Let's kill him together!" The other youths shouted excitedly.

Amidst the crowd, Qin Ming struck again. The old demon, at the end of its strength, couldn't hold on at all. Its head flew off, severed by the gleaming saber light.

Someone shouted excitedly, "The old demon is dead, completely dealt with! This is a cave abode that once produced a giant demon; everyone search carefully, there might be rare treasures!"

Someone said, "Brother, your contribution is the greatest. The old demon's head is yours."

In truth, they hadn't perceived the true strength of this newcomer, assuming he was merely fresh reinforcements and that the old demon was already failing, which allowed him to slay it.

Qin Ming naturally intended to take the head.

However, someone blocked him, saying, "Many experts from my Li family are here and contributed greatly. You shouldn't be the one to claim its head."

Someone came to claim merit.

Many people's expressions changed. Could it be the Li family among the quasi-millennia-old aristocratic families?

"There are only four of you, and you merely participated in the siege. You haven't made any special contributions, have you?" Qin Ming asked, as he took the old demon's head.

"Who said there are only four of us? Many others are responsible for blockading the vital passages and exits of the subterranean palace," another five people walked over.

Qin Ming sneered, ignoring them. Anyone with eyes could see they were trying to snatch credit. They had been wary of the Third Realm old demon earlier and dared not approach, but now they were acting aggressively.

"Put down the old demon's head!" someone from the Li family demanded.

"I have memory crystals here. Don't make trouble for yourselves," Qin Ming said coldly.

At the same time, a saber light flared, imbued with dazzling colors. The Heavenly Light force caused piercing pain in the eyes of those it shone upon, their spiritual consciousness feeling as if it would ignite.

They were horrified and quickly retreated, daring not to block him.

Qin Ming ignored them, his figure moving like a phantom, searching through the massive subterranean palace.

The palace was vast, carved out from natural grottoes, with many stone chambers.

However, too many people had entered. After dealing with this nest of demons, everyone was scavenging, so there might not be many good things left to find.

Furthermore, this demon family had indeed long declined, with little left to begin with.

Qin Ming and a group of people rushed into the clan's treasury, only to find it empty, pitifully barren.

"Hmm?" Among a pile of rusty weapons, he picked up a black stone.

It was as large as a washbasin, completely scorched black, as if struck by lightning.

During his ninth rebirth, Qin Ming's eyes had mutated, becoming even superior to spirit pupils. At this moment, his eyes burned hot as he carefully gazed at the object before him.

Instantly, he felt a piercing pain in his eyes.

Inside the black stone, he saw a dazzling ball of fiery light.

"Essence of Starlight?!" Qin Ming was shocked.

If it were in the past, he certainly wouldn't have recognized it.

He had seen it when immersed in ancient immortal daoist sites, and only at one place had he seen such a thing—just a small cluster, yet it was already priceless.

And some essences of starlight were variations of Sun Fire Essences.

Qin Ming had devised several modes for his Outer Saint Path, one of which was "a single thought of day, a single thought of night," which precisely required a ball of Sun Fire Essence.

However, finding such a thing in this Night Mist-shrouded world was utterly unrealistic, as even the sun had vanished.

But now, he found himself very close to one of his conceptualizations, having discovered the most crucial "anomalous substance."

"This nest of demons' ancestors were indeed wealthy and influential back then; they were very strong!" Qin Ming lamented, then found a secluded spot and placed the black stone into his tattered cloth space.

At this moment, his heart swelled with delight, and an undeniable smile spread across his face.

"It was worth it!" Qin Ming felt this was truly a delightful surprise.

Even if he didn't get the Auspicious Beast Blood, it didn't matter. In his eyes, this scorched black stone was a priceless divine artifact.

Someone was guarding the exit of the subterranean palace, blocking Qin Ming's path.

There were over a dozen people in total. The leader seemed to have just arrived from afar, wearing a bronze mask, with a robust physique, holding a bronze staff.

"Stop!" someone from the Li family shouted.

Qin Ming directly swung his saber, formed by Heavenly Light force, slashing forward.

The tall man in the mask made a move and actually blocked the light saber in Qin Ming's hand.

Both were surprised, not expecting the other to be so strong.

In an instant, the two continuously launched attacks, clashing repeatedly, swift as lightning, leaving numerous afterimages in the area as they fiercely contended.

Only when the tall figure in the mask was sent flying backward, spitting large mouthfuls of blood, did Qin Ming stride away, vanishing into the night.

The Li family members were utterly dumbfounded. They knew their kinsman's true abilities; how could he have been defeated?

Li Qingxu stood up, deeply wounded in his heart. A mere new-born practitioner had defeated him!

In recent days, he had suffered nearly ten consecutive defeats!

He accepted his consecutive defeats in the immortal daoist sites; after all, those were ruthless individuals, all ancient prodigies. But to be struck and made to vomit blood by a random new-born practitioner here today, it left him utterly stunned.

"Qingxu, don't worry about it. After all, you're temporarily using a rare treasure to transform your spiritual consciousness into Heavenly Light force, changing your form and mental energy field. This isn't your true strength, just an accident," someone consoled him.

"It's fine. A few more defeats won't hurt," Li Qingxu said, sitting on the ground, his eyes very deep.

The Li family members regretted it. They shouldn't have been greedy, shouldn't have engaged in a spat, which resulted in their clan's immortal seed experiencing another defeat.

They were well aware of what Li Qingxu had been going through recently.

If his Dao Heart were damaged, none of them could bear the consequences.

Qin Ming felt that this plateau was a treasure trove and had to be thoroughly searched.

Following this, his performance became even more striking, astounding the battlefield.

"Among the new-born practitioners, several are quite suspicious and remarkably powerful. We don't know if he's among them," someone from the Cui family said, closely monitoring the battlefield and responsible for gathering information.

"If it's truly him, then let's help him gain fame. He's far too low-key. I don't think we even need to act; many people will become interested in him, such as Cao Qianqiu."
