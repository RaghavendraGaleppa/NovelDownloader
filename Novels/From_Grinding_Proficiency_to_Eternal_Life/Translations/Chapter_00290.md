# Chapter 290: Factional Strife

His gaze shifted to the gray-robed elder with cloudy eyes. "Senior Brother Cui, Yunfan recently comprehended the *Slaying Mountain Sword* in the Langhuan Library Tower. It would be good to take advantage of today's performance review to go to the Sword Burial Abyss..."

Before he could finish, the red-faced old man on the right let out a cold snort, and the wooden sword at his waist hummed without wind.

Xu Yunfan immediately felt a sharp sword intent sweep over his entire body, as if it wanted to peel open his very marrow to inspect it. His muscles instinctively tensed, and the *Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Technique* operated to its limit, quickly concealing his aura.

"The Qi is condensed but not released; he is indeed a good seedling, but the internal force is far too mixed... What exactly has he been practicing?"

Cui Yu's figure swayed, crossing between Xu Yunfan and the red-faced old man like a ghost, muttering unconsciously.

His wide gray robe moved without wind, and the aura around him dissipated silently, making his silhouette faintly glow, completely blocking the blade-like gaze of the Dragon and Tiger Peak Leader, Li Zhi.

Li Zhi frowned, letting out a cold breath from his nose.

The wooden sword at his waist "clanged" and trembled half an inch, but he ultimately made no further move. Even a Ninth Realm Grandmaster had to give the Head of the Enforcement Hall face, let alone considering the other party's strength was not weak.

Xu Yunfan watched this unfold, his heart stirring slightly. It seemed that the Dao Sect was not a monolithic block; this situation alone spoke volumes.

It seemed that many people within the Dao Sect were dissatisfied with Bi Yuan taking him as a disciple.

"Little fellow, do you mind if this old man lends a hand?"

The candlelight in the hall flickered, casting Cui Yu's gaunt face into deeper shadows.

When he grinned, his jade-colored teeth appeared particularly eerie amidst the interplay of light and shadow.

The other party's bones, and even his teeth, had been trained to the point of looking like jade.

Although Xu Yunfan's face remained calm, a taut string tightened in his heart. The factions within the Dao Sect were complex, and the attitude of the Head of the Enforcement Hall before him might determine his future situation.

He glanced at Bi Yuan sitting on the high seat. Seeing his master lightly tapping the jade table with his fingertips and giving an imperceptible nod, his heart settled slightly. The visitor, Cui Yu, was a member of the Sect Leader's faction.

He immediately cupped his hands and said, "Please guide me, Head Cui."

"Nephew is quite sharp."

Cui Yu let out a low laugh, and his withered branch-like hand had already landed on Xu Yunfan's wrist pulse.

In an instant, a Yin-cold yet majestic and upright true Qi drilled into his tendons like a venomous snake, but upon touching the flesh, it suddenly turned into a spring breeze and fine rain, carefully inspecting every inch of bone and muscle.

It should be a Dao Sect true art of the Taiyin attribute...

Xu Yunfan subconsciously operated the *Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Technique* internally, concealing all mixed auras. However, Cui Yu's cultivation far exceeded his imagination. The wisps of true Qi, like peeling silk and cocooning, layer by layer broke through his disguise!

"This *Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Technique*, I created it..."

Cui Yu grinned, then his laughter suddenly stopped, his expression filled with disbelief.

Under his perception, the Triple Burner Sword Force within Xu Yunfan's body was like a dormant dragon, revealing its edge in the Triple Burner meridians, while the Nine Luminaries Blood Qi surged through his flesh and blood.

Deeper still, the phenomenon of jade bones singing and ringing, refined by the *Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique*, was revealed under the牵引 of his aura...

Cui Yu's pupils contracted, and a storm of shock surged in his heart.

This child had just entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm, yet he had integrated the top martial arts of the various sects in the Great Zhou. Moreover, they ran smoothly and bizarrely without interfering with each other, yet they blended together, faintly showing the embryonic form of "All Laws Return to the Stream"!

He suppressed his shock strongly, not revealing a fraction on his face, only giving Xu Yunfan a deep look, as if trying to pierce through his soul.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but return a smile.

But what he got in return was Cui Yu's gaze looking at a monster.

So many martial arts gathered in one body, the blood qi having been refined several times yet still having no problems. If it were someone else...

After a long while, Cui Yu withdrew his hand and turned to nod solemnly to Bi Yuan. "The foundation is solid, blessed by luck, he indeed has the qualification to enter the Sword Burial Abyss."

Before his voice fell, the red-faced old man Li Zhi on the right suddenly sneered. "The Sword Burial Abyss is a holy land for martial dissolution. How can it allow outsiders to desecrate it?"

The wooden sword at his waist hummed, and the sword intent was like frost.

Cui Yu's gray robe billowed, his figure crossing in front of Xu Yunfan like a ghost, his cloudy eyes suddenly bursting with light. "Junior Brother Li, do you dare question the Sect Leader's decree?"

His aura was like an abyss, actually cutting off the sharp sword intent.

He then sneered. "Now Xu Yunfan is the true transmission second seat of the Sect Leader. Whether he has the turn or not is not decided by your Dragon Tiger Peak."

The air in the hall stagnated.

Bi Yuan, however, seemed oblivious. He lightly swept his horsetail whisk and said gently to Xu Yunfan, "Since that is the case, tomorrow at Chen time, let Cangming take you to the Sword Burial Abyss."

His tone was flat, but it was a final decision.

Xu Yunfan bowed to accept. He caught a glimpse of Li Zhi's livid face from the corner of his eye and realized that the waters of the Dao Sect were likely deeper than he had imagined...

Just as he was about to turn and leave, Li Zhi suddenly spoke.

"Wait."

Before Li Zhi's voice fell, the candlelight in the hall suddenly dimmed, as if even the air was being cut apart by the sharpness in his words.

He raised his neck slightly, his gaze like a poisoned short dagger piercing straight into Bi Yuan. "The Sword Burial Abyss is a forbidden zone designated by the Founding Ancestor. According to sect rules, those entering the abyss need the joint recognition of nearly half of the thirty-six peak leaders. This child has just entered the Dao Sect; what virtue and ability does he have to make an exception?"

Bi Yuan's horsetail whisk hung suspended in mid-air, and a faint light seemed to flow in his eyes, appearing extremely divine.

He stared at Li Zhi for a long time, then suddenly laughed softly. "Is Junior Brother Li trying to bring out the *Xuantian Ancestral Precepts* to suppress me?"

His voice was still gentle, but it made the bronze lanterns hanging from the roof tremble without wind.

The gray-robed elder Cui Yu quietly stepped forward, his withered hand already resting on Xu Yunfan's shoulder, a Yin-soft force protecting him. This Head of the Enforcement Hall had clearly sensed the undercurrent of conflict.

Xu Yunfan naturally saw it clearly. Li Zhi and Bi Yuan clearly had a long-standing grudge; otherwise, they would not have torn face like this.

"I wouldn't dare."

Li Zhi sneered, a jade slip sliding out from his sleeve. "I am just reminding the Sect Leader that when Chu Cangming entered the abyss three years ago, he solidly obtained the jade signatures of nineteen peak leaders."

He deliberately emphasized the word "solidly," his gaze sweeping over the few silent elders in the corner of the hall.

From the moment Xu Yunfan entered the hall, these few silent elders had not said a word, looking like old gods.

Xu Yunfan immediately understood.

This was clearly using the old rules of the sect to prevent him from entering the Sword Burial Abyss. After all, his foundation had likely been seen through by these people.

Reaching the Marrow Cleansing Realm in two years—if Xu Yunfan were an opponent of Bi Yuan, he would likely lose sleep and appetite. A genius capable of breaking the common sense of the martial path, standing on the opposing faction—who could rest easy?

However, the Dao Sect ultimately emphasized "fellow disciple friendship." On the surface, arguments were one thing, and tearing face was another. They could not truly act personally in secret, or the rules would truly be broken.

Thus, Li Zhi and the others brought out the ancestral precepts, using the reason of "requiring the recognition of half of the thirty-six peak leaders" to force him to either reveal his trump cards in public or retreat in difficulty.

This was truly a brilliant scheme that kills without blood!

*Crack!*

Bi Yuan's knuckles rapped the jade table, the sound like the clash of metal and iron.

He suddenly stood up, the patterns of the Big Dipper on his Daoist robe lighting up one by one. "Since Junior Brother Li wants to discuss rules... then let us set up a stage for martial performance. According to the ancestral rules, as long as Xu Yunfan, who is under thirty years of age, obtains the recognition of the Dao Sons of the various peaks, it will suffice."
