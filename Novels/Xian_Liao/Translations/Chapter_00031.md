# Chapter 31: Tiger and Crane (Part 2)

After an indeterminate amount of time, Zhou Qing opened his eyes, his body exuding a heavy yet light aura, carrying an unapproachable sharpness.

But his entire body was drenched, sweat pouring out like a spring. Zhou Qing first drank several large bowls of cold boiled water to rehydrate, then consumed a considerable amount of honey to restore his energy. Afterward, he went to the courtyard, fetched a basin of clean water, and looked at his reflection.

His face was paler than usual, but it was better than the state after his soul had left his body. His current physical foundation was no longer that of a frail youth in any aspect.

Focusing on the "Health Master" panel:

Five Animal Frolics (Basic Proficiency): Tiger (Proficient), Deer (Proficient), Bear (Basic), Bird (Basic), Monkey (Basic).

Martial Skills: Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist (Beginner); Finger Flick Divine Skill (Beyond Limits); Breeze Talisman Code (Skilled).

Special Skills: Rejuvenation Talisman Code (Beginner).

Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary).

Literary Courage (Elementary).

Remaining Lifespan (40 years).

Although Zhou Qing was disappointed to see his lifespan reduced by six years, it was within expectations. Earlier, comprehending the Rejuvenation Talisman Code had already consumed one year of his lifespan. Now, merging the Tiger and Crane techniques naturally consumed more, which made sense.

Moreover, the reduction in his remaining lifespan was essentially due to depleted vitality, which he could eventually recover through cultivation—a fact already proven.

The evaluation feedback for the Crane Technique had disappeared, but that didn't mean the technique itself was gone. After all, the Crane Technique was fundamentally part of the Rejuvenation Talisman Code, and its progress would still be reflected in the latter's evaluation.

"Black Tiger Digs the Heart" had vanished, replaced by a new martial skill—Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

He had heard of this name in his previous life, but the two were clearly different.

The naming by the Health Master was primarily based on his own memories and knowledge, resulting in an easily understandable name.

For example, his Finger Flick Divine Skill was certainly not the same as the East Heretic Huang Yaoshi's. The "Beyond Limits" designation for the Finger Flick Divine Skill didn't refer to its power but rather to the fact that the skill had transcended its original martial level after incorporating the Crane Force.

However, the Crane Force's effect on the Finger Flick Divine Skill was more of an enhancement, unlike the fusion of the Tiger and Crane techniques. This fusion perfectly combined the strengths of both, utilizing Zhou Qing's understanding of the two cultivation methods and related knowledge to achieve an elevated deduction.

It also absorbed the martial skill "Black Tiger Digs the Heart," giving birth to a new skill—Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

The newly created Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist was still only at the beginner level.

After replenishing his fluids and consuming honey, the energy expended during the fusion quickly recovered.

Zhou Qing was eager to test the power of this new martial skill.

Mao Ri was the sole spectator, with the great mulberry tree serving as the backdrop.

In the courtyard, Zhou Qing began practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

His right fist struck out, immediately producing a faint tiger's roar in the air, causing the atmosphere in the courtyard to grow heavy.

His left fist followed, producing a faint crane's cry—light and swift, with a barely perceptible ferocity.

"Tiger's Roar, Crane's Cry."

Zhou Qing retracted his fists and pondered. Clearly, the Tiger-Crane Dual Form had fully utilized the distinct advantages of each hand. His right hand was stronger, while his left was more agile and swift.

In truth, based on the characteristics of his hands, his left was more suited for swordplay, leveraging the lightness and speed of a crane, while his right was better for saber techniques, delivering powerful, crushing blows like a tiger descending a mountain.

Practicing fist techniques was for strengthening the body and mastering force application.

For actual killing, weapons were still necessary.

However, wielding a saber would be too conspicuous, so he decided to acquire a sword first.

A scholar wearing a sword was a perfectly natural thing.

Though the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist was a fist technique, it was ultimately a method of force application. Using it with a sword wouldn't be as seamless as with meticulously refined sword techniques, but wielding a weapon would inherently enhance combat effectiveness.

As for sword and saber techniques, he could collect those later.

Once he passed the provincial examination and elevated his status, acquiring such things would become much easier.

After practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist for a while, his energy depleted rapidly.

Zhou Qing's stomach growled.

Too lazy to cook, he simply washed up, changed clothes, and went out to eat. The specific power of the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist could be tested further upon his return.

After eating, he planned to visit a weapon shop to buy a sword.

If Old Hu the blacksmith were still in Hu Village, Zhou Qing could have asked him to forge one. However, Old Hu had closed his village smithy, and according to the village elders, he had gone deep into the mountains to gather herbs, with no telling when he'd return.

Zhou Qing chose a reputable restaurant and ordered meat dishes with staple foods.

Given his current appetite, consuming too much staple food wouldn't suffice for his martial training. But eating meat at every meal also meant significant daily expenses.

At its peak, Qingfu Temple had supported hundreds of Taoist priests. Even if only a third practiced martial arts, the thought was staggering.

Had Qingfu Temple not fallen into internal strife, it would undoubtedly have been the dominant force in Jiangzhou, ruling over both the underworld and the righteous path.

No bandit would have dared provoke them, and the wolves, tigers, and leopards in the mountains would have suffered.

Zhou Qing visited three restaurants before he was full.

This was also why he didn't want to draw too much attention.

---

At home, he didn't have to worry about appearances. The kitchenware at home couldn't compare to that of restaurants. In this era, with fewer condiments available, each restaurant had its own specialties.

In terms of flavor, they couldn't match the variety of later times, but they had their own unique qualities.

Moreover, cooking delicious meals alone at home required time—something Zhou Qing currently lacked the leisure for.

After eating his fill, he headed straight to a weapon shop.

This was a shop frequented by scholars in the city, specializing in swords and bows. It was called "Moye Pavilion," named after a quote from Xunzi: "With the mold rightly set, the metal and tin fine, the craftsmanship skillful, and the fire well-tempered, the mold is broken, and Moye is born."

Of course, Moye Pavilion didn't forge bronze swords but iron ones.

Zhou Qing wore the standard attire of a state academy scholar—a Confucian headscarf and robe—making his identity immediately recognizable.

"Esteemed scholar, are you here to buy a sword?" A neat and efficient shop assistant approached.

Zhou Qing showed his scholar's identification plaque, which bore his name and physical description.

After verifying his identity, the assistant introduced the various swords available.

Scholars wearing swords had been a tradition for thousands of years.

Zhou Qing didn't choose any of the ornate swords but selected a simple, slightly rusted iron sword.

Seeing his choice, the assistant smiled awkwardly. "Scholar Zhou, this sword isn't quite suitable for you."

"Why not?" Zhou Qing asked curiously.

The assistant explained, "This sword was sold to us by a down-and-out craftsman who claimed his ancestors were Mohists. As you know, Confucianism and Mohism have never gotten along. If you unknowingly bought this and later discovered its origin, you might complain to our master, and I'd be in trouble."

Mohism had long been in decline and was historically hostile to Confucianism. A conservative scholar using a Mohist's sword would undoubtedly feel uncomfortable.

Zhou Qing said, "I don't see any special markings on it, and it resonates with me. Sell it to me. I won't cause trouble over this."

"If Scholar Zhou insists, then it's yours." The assistant knew this sword wasn't eye-catching, with its rust and lack of appeal, making it hard to sell. Since Zhou Qing understood the situation and still wanted it, the assistant was happy to close the deal.

---

With his newly purchased sword, Zhou Qing visited grain and meat shops to order supplies to be delivered to the Lin family's old residence.

This outing had been costly.

Though he had income from the Five-Spice Pills, he had already incurred many favors from the Lin family.

If he failed the provincial examination next year, he'd have to wait another two years.

Given Miss Lin's character, even if Zhou Qing didn't pass next year, she likely wouldn't say much.

Investing in a scholar was like any business—no guarantees of success.

But for Zhou Qing, passing the provincial examination was essential to relieve the pressure from the Zhang family and accept the Lin family's favors with a clear conscience.

Only then could their partnership truly stabilize.

Potential wasn't the same as actual strength and status.

Back in his courtyard, he hung up the iron sword.

Zhou Qing consumed Vitality Powder to convert it into Crane Force, then began practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

Currently, the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist was only at the beginner level, and its difficulty was significantly higher than the Tiger and Crane techniques. He wondered if he could reach proficiency before next year's provincial examination.

Though classified as a martial skill, practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist also incorporated the effects of the Tiger and Crane techniques.

Notably, the mysterious heat generated by practicing the Tiger technique could now accumulate and settle in his dantian alongside the Crane Force—an unexpected boon.

This heat could alleviate fatigue, strengthen his constitution, enhance vitality, and even aid in healing, preventing hidden injuries from martial training.

Each of the Five Animal Frolics had different emphases.

The Tiger technique significantly strengthened the back and waist, while the Deer technique focused on improving liver function.

Thus, the proficient-level Tiger technique had enhanced Zhou Qing's strength, and the Deer technique had granted him remarkable endurance—both of which greatly benefited his martial skills.

Additionally, the Crane technique's effect on vitality seemed superior to the Tiger and Deer techniques so far.

Moreover, Zhou Qing also practiced the Breeze Talisman Code, which enhanced his self-created "Tiger Pounce" and "Deer Run" techniques. Though not displayed by the Health Master, they still had practical effects.

The Tiger Pounce was suited for short bursts of speed, while the Deer Run aided in stealth.

Combined with the Beyond Limits Finger Flick Divine Skill...

As he pondered, Zhou Qing continued practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

A fist carrying a faint tiger's roar struck a wooden stake, snapping its top. A follow-up punch with a soft crane's cry swiftly struck the broken piece mid-air.

Assessing his current overall strength, Zhou Qing believed he could now defeat the hostile monk who had once infiltrated his courtyard in a direct confrontation.

But he still lacked real combat experience.

Wooden stakes were lifeless, and the monk had been killed by a surprise attack.

"Regardless, while things are calm, I'll focus on improving the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist and practice swordplay."

The beginner-level Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist didn't satisfy Zhou Qing.

The more challenging it was to master, the greater the rewards would be.

For now, he set aside plans to further practice the Bear technique.

In the following days, aside from reviewing and analyzing examination essays from memory, Zhou Qing devoted most of his training time to the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

Under the great mulberry tree, Zhou Qing's clear recitations of texts prepared him for the exams.

Studying invigorated his mind, which in turn improved his martial practice.

Practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist enhanced his vitality, offsetting the depletion caused by mental exertion.

This created a virtuous cycle.

Zhou Qing set his goals and persevered in training and studying, steadily advancing.

During breaks, he also practiced left-handed swordplay with the iron sword, combining it with the Breeze Talisman Code and Crane Force. Though not systematic, it was still formidable—especially the left-handed sword's deceptive, concealed, and vicious strikes, which would be highly effective as a surprise attack.

In a direct exchange, its effectiveness would be mediocre.

But the sword was meant as a trump card—a means of killing or self-defense, not for martial displays.

Ideally, he'd never have to use it.

But whether he used it or not, having it was essential.

Deep down, he hoped no one would force him to draw it.

Yet in a world where the strong preyed on the weak, such hopes were hard to fulfill.

Time flew by.

Another month passed, and it was now Mid-Autumn Festival.

Zhou Qing used a mulberry branch—accidentally broken during his Finger Flick Divine Skill practice—as a makeshift sword, with Mao Ri as his sparring partner. After consuming many medicinal residues, Mao Ri's feathers had grown even more vibrant and golden, making its noble appearance even more pronounced.

Its agility had also improved significantly.

In the courtyard, catching Mao Ri was no easy task for Zhou Qing—perfect for sword practice.

During this time, the great mulberry tree had also been nourished with medicinal residues. Zhou Qing could sense its yin energy growing stronger, along with a deeper affinity toward him.

Was feeding it increasing its goodwill?

Moreover, despite it being autumn, the great mulberry tree showed no signs of withering. Any fallen leaves were due to human activity, not natural causes.

"Knock, knock, knock!" A knocking sound came from the gate.

Zhou Qing casually tossed the branch aside.

Mao Ri, finally freed from the Tiger King's torment, fled joyfully. Over these days, it had keenly sensed the Tiger King's growing prowess, as if it had grown wings—clearly a sign of deepening cultivation.

"A great demon that has taken human form is truly unfathomable. Could the Tiger King achieve enlightenment and ascend?" Such thoughts sprouted in Mao Ri's mind.

Having spent so much time with Zhou Qing and frequently hearing his recitations, its intelligence had gradually awakened.

The same was true for the great mulberry tree.

Zhou Qing had a vague sense of this, and since it wasn't harmful, he let it be.

He opened the gate to find Miss Lin dressed in male attire, accompanied by her maid Chunxiang and two guards—Zhang San and Li Si—who had accompanied them up the mountain before. Both were loyal family retainers of the Lin household, skilled in martial arts.

"Master Lin, what brings you here?" Zhou Qing was slightly surprised.

"Today is Mid-Autumn Festival, and Scholar Zhou has just turned fifteen. I brought some modest gifts, lest you forget in your diligent studies."

Zhou Qing invited them to sit at the stone table in the courtyard.

Chunxiang placed a gift box on the table, with a congratulatory note that read:

"On this auspicious day, I wish you smooth sailing and all things favorable."

It meant that today was a fortunate day, coinciding with his birthday, and she wished him success and prosperity in all endeavors.
