# Chapter 90: First Encounter with Cui Chonghe

Under the night sky, Qin Ming stood on the back of the Crimson Eagle. Hearing Cui Chongyi’s shouts, he turned to see him running wildly through the town, chasing after them. At the same time, Qin Ming also spotted Cui Hong, stopped amidst the torchlight at the town's entrance.

He gently patted the Crimson Eagle, signaling it to descend slightly and wait at the other end of Silvervine Town.

"Cousin, I swear on my life, I have absolutely no ill intentions! Why don't you trust me anymore? We used to have such a good relationship!" Cui Chongyi cried out, his voice tinged with a hint of a sob. Finally, he saw the Crimson Eagle circling outside the town, not flying away, and quickly rushed closer.

"Come up!" Qin Ming said, allowing him to leap onto the Crimson Eagle's back. The strong wind howled as the Crimson Eagle carried the two of them far away, soaring towards a region of towering mountain shadows.

Cui Chongyi knew that Qin Ming indeed didn't trust Cui Hong much, fearing he might suddenly attack.

"Chonghe, sigh, Qin Ming, I just can't get used to calling you that." Under the night sky, on a mountaintop, Cui Chongyi looked at his cousin ahead, feeling conflicted.

Qin Ming recalled the past. When he was in the Cui family, the younger generation who didn't know the truth had good relationships with him, especially Cui Chongyi, who was closest to him. Now, as if waking from a dream, he thought back carefully. Those years, the older direct-line cousins treated him with indifference, likely because they already knew the truth.

"Sigh, I've also learned some things. The family was indeed too much back then, actually letting you go with a group of elders who were destined to die, to face a large number of elite experts from the Li family." Cui Chongyi brought this up, looking indignant. How could he not know now that the family intended for Qin Ming to die in that chaos, to put an end to everything? If not for Cui Qi's return, who, after learning the truth, turned against the clan, Cui Hong and that woman would never have gone to rescue Qin Ming later. Everything would have been left without a trace.

"Let's not talk about the past," Qin Ming said. He stood on the mountaintop, gazing into the distance. The night wind swept past, causing his green robes to flap loudly.

Cui Chongyi's voice was low. "Chong... Qin Ming, I know that many brothers and sisters in the family will likely turn their backs on you in the future. But for me, no matter how things develop from now on, you will always be my brother. That will never change. If you ever need anything, just say the word, and I'll immediately come to your aid!"

"There's no need for that," Qin Ming shook his head, knowing that this cousin was a truly good person and not wanting him to fall into an inexplicable whirlpool in the future. Qin Ming wasn't afraid of being targeted by others; he only worried that some might try to play on family ties later. Now, hearing the attitude of most people, he actually let out a sigh of relief. From now on, no one could stop him from reclaiming his silk scroll.

Cui Chongyi sighed softly. He could understand Qin Ming's feelings and didn't know what else to say, but he didn't want to leave just yet. "Cousin, your performance tonight truly astonished me. Uncle Hong told me you only recently embarked on the New Life Path, yet you possess such powerful strength now." He spoke from the heart, truly shocked. He continued, "I knew it! Once you could walk this path, you would definitely be incredibly formidable. Back then, you learned everything quickly at home; you picked up musical instruments and chess casually and surpassed the rest of us."

"None of that matters anymore. I haven't touched them in over two years; my hands are rusty, and I've almost forgotten everything," Qin Ming said. Cui Chongyi knew he was implying something, not wanting to talk about those people and events from the past.

"It's better for you to focus on the cultivation path. As long as you don't get distracted, there's nothing you set your mind to that you can't accomplish. It's just that silk scroll, sigh, you were too obsessed with it back then. That thing really shouldn't be cultivated. If you had turned back earlier, you would surely have reached the Outer Saint Realm by now."

Qin Ming glanced at him, but ultimately said nothing. Some people only wanted him to cultivate the silk scroll, deliberately guiding him. Back then, he was just a child; how could he see clearly? He was far from being their match. Normally, this New Life method should be impassable. Fortunately, he truly managed to cultivate the silk scroll!

Qin Ming asked, "Can you do me a favor?"

Cui Chongyi quickly nodded. "Tell me!"

Qin Ming spoke earnestly, "Can you try to retrieve the silk scroll for me? It's the last thing my grandfather left me."

"Seventh Uncle mentioned this. Reportedly, the Old Ancestor took the silk scroll to comprehend it," Cui Chongyi said, his voice lowering towards the end.

Hearing this, Qin Ming couldn't help but want to curse. It would be even harder to get it back now! Seeing his expression turn very grim, Cui Chongyi quickly added, "Wait until Seventh Uncle comes out of seclusion; let him help you demand it back. It shouldn't be a big problem."

"I hope so." Since experiencing certain events, Qin Ming would no longer place all his hope on others.

"Cousin, this area you live in is truly remote. I've completely lost contact with the outside world recently, so I don't know about recent events. Where have you been? Also, how did you become so strong? You haven't undergone more than five rebirths, have you? That's not good; there should be a buffer period within a year..." Cui Chongyi was clearly trying to make conversation, mentioning that he had been abducted by a white owl and even taught a lesson by a hateful purple lightning beast, and had to help an elephant with missing teeth wash its dentures, which made him so angry he couldn't sleep for two days!

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming couldn't help but look at him. How did his encounters seem somewhat related to himself?

"Cousin, that person... is also on Black-White Mountain," Cui Chongyi said in a low voice, with an awkward expression. "It's Cui Chonghe from the Outer Reaches."

A ripple went through Qin Ming's heart, but it quickly settled. He said, "The Great Black-White Medicine harmonizes Yin and Yang, so it must be very important to people from the Outer Reaches."

"He's trying to acquire it for a fellow disciple; he doesn't need it himself anymore," Cui Chongyi informed him, then said very seriously, "Although the clan values him immensely, in my heart, you are far closer than him. To me, he is just a symbol of dazzling brilliance." He then whispered, "Most of our old acquaintances who entered the Outer Reaches back then have also arrived."

After Li Qingyue obtained the Yin-Yang Great Medicine on Black-White Mountain, other famous disciples from the Outer Reaches heard about it and feared falling behind.

Cui Chongyi murmured, "Recently, the atmosphere among the various factions in the Outer Reaches has been very tense. The most outstanding new disciples are actively preparing for battle, because a legendary item has appeared, one that is most suitable for younger individuals, and it can help them approach immortality in the future. Some of our old friends will likely participate as well." This wasn't the first time Qin Ming had heard this; he felt these matters were somewhat distant from him.

Cui Chongyi said, "Wang Caiwei, Zheng Maoze, and others are nearby, all accompanied by experts. You must be careful of Li Qingxu when traveling here. Although he appears ethereal in his feathered robes, he is very dangerous..."

"Understood!" Qin Ming nodded. Afterwards, he prepared to leave.

"The Golden Bandits have gone mad now; I need to go to other places to check," Qin Ming said, and the Crimson Eagle parted the night mist, carrying him far away.

Cui Chongyi stood on a main road, watching the figure in the night sky disappear. He was somewhat lost in thought, his emotions very complex. "My cousin now, after leaving the Cui family, is constantly active in remote areas, preventing the Golden Bandits from wreaking havoc and causing large-scale bloodshed."

Cui Chongyi was deeply moved, a mix of emotions swirling in his heart. His cousin was younger than him but was working so hard and traveling, while he himself was training under the protection of his clan. "On Black-White Mountain, Cui Chonghe, Zheng Maoze, Wang Caiwei, and others are accompanied by experts from the Outer Reaches, obtaining the Yin-Yang Great Medicine. People's destinies are different, with vast disparities. I hope my cousin will have a smooth journey from now on."

Cui Chongyi wondered what he would be like if he had gone through those experiences. He would likely have been completely dejected. Emotionally, he felt closer to Qin Ming, but he knew that some within the clan were indeed using his cousin, and to this day still lacked goodwill, and they were all his elders. This made him only able to let out a heavy sigh.

Subsequently, Cui Chongyi felt a bit worried. Although he had reminded his cousin and told him that some old acquaintances were in this area, he was still afraid that Qin Ming might encounter certain people and get into trouble.

"The experts guarding Emei Town repelled two Golden Bandits, but failed to kill them. The two fierce bandits have disappeared into the mountains," the Sparrow reported the latest news.

Qin Ming frowned. Multiple Golden Bandits appearing in this remote area seemed off. Could more fierce bandits be using this path to cross? His heart tensed. Could it be that a group of Golden Bandits wanted to enter Black-White Mountain? He thought of some experts from the Outer Reaches accompanying core disciples there. Could there be some transaction or connection between the two sides? The young man capable of mistification whom he had killed earlier with the Sheep-Fat Jade Iron Blade was related to the Golden Bandits, having once entered the mountain accompanied by a great bandit from Golden Rooster Ridge.

This was not a major event he could interfere with. Qin Ming came to Silvervine Town and wrote a letter, asking the people here to send it to Crimson Glow City via a bird of prey.

The Sparrow informed him, "The two Golden Bandits who escaped from Emei Town are rushing through the mountains, a few miles from Double Tree Village. I estimate they probably won't enter the village, but will eventually go into Black-White Mountain."

"Let's go, intercept them!" Qin Ming leaped onto the Crimson Eagle's back again. Those Golden Bandits were vicious, their hands stained with the blood of innocent people. Although they were all white-haired, that just meant bad people grew old.

In the dense forest, two Golden Bandits suddenly stopped, seeing a blood-red raptor circling down, a young man leaping down with a heavy hammer. A violent sound of wind and thunder erupted in the forest, and many trees instantly disintegrated. Qin Ming attacked without saying a word. Every Golden Bandit was a target to be killed; there would be no wronged souls. The two fierce bandits roared, their Heavenly Light Energy erupting fully, wanting to fight Qin Ming to the death, but they were no match and were successively smashed apart by the heavy hammer.

"Someone is fighting in the mountains."

Disciples from the Outer Reaches appeared nearby, both men and women, each accompanied by experts.

"The dead ones aren't strong; they weren't even qualified to be selected as Golden Armored Guards," a young man said, his fingertips glowing as he used a secret technique to sense and conclude. They looked at the raptor flying away into the night sky, not paying much attention. Only Wang Caiwei cast a deep glance at the night sky. In that fleeting glimpse, she felt the tall figure on the Crimson Eagle's back looked somewhat familiar.

Qin Ming did not plan to randomly intervene anymore; he had done most of what he needed to do.

"Truth and falsehood, it's hard to tell. They say the Golden Bandits are massacring villages and towns to attract attention, creating an opportunity for their distant leader to break through. But if their leader is also taking this path, then things will become incredibly dangerous. I hope I'm wrong."

The Crimson Eagle broke through the night mist, descending onto the slope outside Double Tree Village. Qin Ming guarded this place, hoping that true experts from Crimson Glow City would arrive.

"Hmm?" His eyesight was exceptionally sharp. He saw some people appear near Double Tree Village. Under the illumination of the fire spring at the village entrance, the leading young man's body glowed, seemingly possessing the aura of an immortal, accompanied by wisps of white mist and flowing specks of light rain, immensely extraordinary and detached from the mundane world. The young man was observing the black and white twin trees at the village entrance, seemingly sensing something, and turned to look towards the slope. Qin Ming realized that this person's perception was extremely keen.

Immediately, he knew who this was. That face was somewhat similar to Father Cui's. Coupled with his immortal-like feathered robes, being a disciple from the Outer Reaches, and his entire being accompanied by immortal light rain, as if he transcended the mortal world—all these pointed to one person. It had to be Cui Chonghe! Qin Ming had not expected to meet him under such circumstances.
