# Chapter 24: Self-Detonation!

Liu Xin was once just an ordinary disciple, commonplace within the Initial Saint Sect. His daily life was a grueling routine of completing tasks, cultivating, and repaying loans.

Until one fortuitous encounter completely changed his destiny.

It began with a bounty mission issued by a true disciple. He wanted to explore an ancient cultivator's cave dwelling and happened to be in need of a few expendable pathfinders.

Unaware of the full story, Liu Xin was drawn by the mission's rewards and joined the exploration team. By the time he realized he was merely cannon fodder, it was too late. He was forced by the true disciple to enter the cave, only to discover that all the restrictions within the dwelling were surprisingly ineffective against him.

He proceeded unimpeded and acquired the serendipitous opportunity.

It was a golden casket, containing the "Innate Dao Scripture" and the "Myriad Spirit Banner of Primordial Innate Qi". Beside it lay a letter left by the cave's former master.

In the letter, the cave's master referred to himself as the "Innate True Man".

The Daoist scripture and artifact in the casket were left for a fated individual. He had calculated that this fated person would be a True Disciple of the Saint Sect, and their name would contain the character "Xin".

However, he was displeased.

The Innate True Man vehemently cursed the Initial Saint Sect's shamelessness in the letter, for falsely claiming a fated connection and forcibly binding his legacy's karma to a Saint Sect true disciple.

Thus, he intentionally muddled the karma and bestowed the legacy upon Liu Xin.

Furthermore, the letter stated that Liu Xin would face a great calamity of life and death after obtaining the artifact, and so it also left him with a means to overcome the predicament within the cave.

In the original karma, the "fake Xin" was not the "true Xin", which is why Liu Xin was meant to be someone else's cannon fodder, a boy delivering treasures to another. However, under the Innate True Man's deliberate arrangement, Liu Xin instead gained the serendipitous opportunity, even usurping the true disciple's place and killing him.

It was a thrilling and heart-pounding night.

By sunrise, only Liu Xin emerged from the Innate True Man's cave, completely transformed. The Saint Sect true disciple had, from that point on, gone missing.

However, Liu Xin had not completely killed his opponent.

Instead, with the help of the Innate True Man's lingering arrangements, he refined that Saint Sect true disciple alive, turning him into the strongest banner spirit in his possession.

As the banner unfurled, a figure in a fluttering black robe emerged. He did not immediately look at Lu Yang but instead gazed around with a nostalgic expression.

"The strong prey on the weak, disciples kill each other... the Saint Sect is indeed still the familiar Saint Sect I remember."

"Senior Brother, are you well?" Liu Xin cupped his hands.

"Incompetent fool, have you encountered another formidable enemy you can't handle?" The black-robed figure sneered dismissively. "Giving you the Innate Dao Scripture was truly a waste."

"I can't compare to Senior Brother," Liu Xin replied.

Liu Xin showed no anger, remaining respectful and polite: "This person is a sword cultivator, and has also cultivated the Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light. Junior Brother is indeed not his match."

"Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light?" The black-robed figure was momentarily startled by the name, his expression growing a bit more serious. He then shook his head. "To be able to master that divine ability, he is indeed a person of note. Unfortunately, he pursued the wrong path, engaging in futile efforts. As per our agreement, this is already the third time I've taken action."

"Senior Brother is wise to see this," Liu Xin acknowledged.

Liu Xin nodded: "After this matter is resolved, I will release Senior Brother to reincarnation. With Senior Brother's merits and foundation, I believe you will certainly re-enter the Dao path in your next life."

"Good," the black-robed figure assented.

Only then did the black-robed figure turn and look at Lu Yang.

Witnessing this scene, Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye showed no particular reaction. Instead, Immortal Maiden Qingchen's eyes widened, staring intently at the black-robed figure.

She was no longer a newly initiated disciple.

At first, she merely found the black-robed figure somewhat familiar. However, when he truly unleashed his aura, she was suddenly startled and recognized him.

"It's Chen Xinan, Senior Brother Chen!?"

The son of the Peak Master of Mending Heaven Peak, one of the four inner peaks! The true disciple who went missing!

When Chen Xinan disappeared back then, the Mending Heaven Peak Master was furious. He personally attempted to deduce the karma but found nothing, which caused a huge stir.

She never imagined he would be in Senior Brother Liu's possession?

In an instant, Immortal Maiden Qingchen's expression changed slightly. As if she had realized something, she instinctively took a few steps back, attempting to distance herself from Liu Xin.

*Puchi!*

The blade entered and exited. Immortal Maiden Qingchen's pretty face was blank, her eyes listlessly staring at the hand plunged into her lower abdomen. Then, her head tilted, and she lost all vital signs.

She was dead again.

"What a pity. Since you saw, I cannot let you live."

Upon Immortal Maiden Qingchen's death, the surrounding array immediately trembled. However, as Liu Xin activated the Myriad Spirit Banner, Immortal Maiden Qingchen's corpse instantly fell into the banner.

In less than a moment, a perfectly intact Immortal Maiden Qingchen walked out of the banner, having surprisingly become a banner spirit.

Although becoming a banner spirit brought many more restrictions than during her life, she could still control the array, and quickly stabilized the trembling formation.

At the same time, the black-robed true disciple, Chen Xinan, also arrived before Lu Yang.

"Hmm?"

Looking at Chen Xinan, Lu Yang's gaze immediately narrowed. The opponent's cultivation was not high, only at the seventh layer of Qi Refining like his own, but the feeling he exuded was different.

Chen Xinan also glanced at Lu Yang, shaking his head: "The Great Yin-Yang Music Ode is a Yin-Yang harmonizing cultivation method. However, your true qi is impure and chaotic; it's clear you didn't obtain it through arduous cultivation. The fifth-grade Yin-Yang Dragon-Tiger Qi, when applied to you, is at most sixth-grade."

This critique made alarm bells ring loudly in Lu Yang's mind.

"May I ask who you are?"

"My name is Chen Xinan. I am currently not in control of my actions, but if you can escape and bring word of me back to Mending Heaven Peak, my father will surely reward you handsomely."

Before he finished speaking, Chen Xinan made his move!

He raised a hand and pressed down. His aura instantly melded with the heavens and earth, and surging true qi roared forth, actually drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy of heaven and earth to resonate with it!

At this moment, Lu Yang's pupils abruptly contracted.

Not because of the strength Chen Xinan displayed, but because as Chen Xinan acted, Lu Yang clearly felt the incompleteness and flaws in his own true qi.

In an instant, Lu Yang understood.

"My Dragon-Tiger Intercourse Great Yin-Yang Music Ode is not the limit. Mending Heaven Peak has even higher-grade cultivation methods! This person must be a true disciple of Mending Heaven Peak!"

Lu Yang's conjecture was quite correct.

As the son of the Mending Heaven Peak Master, Chen Xinan cultivated a method called the "Mending Heaven True Scripture", which was an upgraded version of the Dragon-Tiger Intercourse Great Yin-Yang Music Ode.

Ordinary dual cultivation involves cultivating with a person, emphasizing the harmony of Yin and Yang.

However, the dual cultivation of the "Mending Heaven True Scripture" involves cultivating with heaven and earth, emphasizing intercourse with the Qian and Kun. The Mending Heaven True Qi refined through this method is even ranked third-grade.

Therefore, when Chen Xinan struck with a palm, even without using any divine abilities, the profound foundation of his third-grade true qi was enough to make it difficult for Lu Yang to parry.

Seeing this, Liu Xin immediately revealed a confident smile.

After all, no one knew Chen Xinan's strength better than he did. In his opinion, even if Lu Yang were ten times more formidable, he still wouldn't be Chen Xinan's opponent.

"He'll win!"

Liu Xin made his judgment decisively, yet he didn't notice Xiao Shiye, who was observing him from a distance with a grim expression, seemingly contemplating something.

With Xiao Shiye's intelligence, he naturally could see that the situation was unfavorable to him.

"Originally, I didn't want to use it, but you forced my hand..."

Xiao Shiye clearly knew that his own strength was the weakest, relying entirely on his array of artifacts to hold his ground. But now, it seemed, artifacts alone wouldn't be enough.

At this thought, Xiao Shiye immediately took a deep breath, then opened his storage bag. In an instant, a magnificent spiritual radiance surged forth from the bag's opening, drawing Liu Xin's attention. Even Chen Xinan and Lu Yang, who were still fiercely battling, stopped their movements and cast their gaze over.

Immediately after, a small pagoda flew out from Xiao Shiye's storage bag.

The small pagoda appeared to be cast from gold, divided into nine layers. At its apex, a spiritual light manifested, resembling a human figure, with eyebrows brimming with vivacity.

"This is... a Spirit Treasure!?"

The moment they saw this, before the less experienced Lu Yang could even speak, Liu Xin and Chen Xinan both exclaimed in unison, expressions of horror appearing on their faces.

When cultivators refine artifacts, if the artifact produces radiance, it is a Dharma Artifact. If the artifact develops spiritual wisdom, then it is a Spirit Treasure!

Dharma Artifacts are divided into low, mid, and high grades, possessing infinite wondrous uses. However, no matter how powerful a Dharma Artifact, it requires a master to wield it to unleash its full power.

But Spirit Treasures are different.

Spirit Treasures possess their own consciousness; they can exert their power even without a wielder. More importantly, Spirit Treasures can cultivate on their own, continuously growing stronger!

The next second, Xiao Shiye formed a hand seal, and the Spirit Treasure pagoda immediately began to swell...

"Bastard!"

Chen Xinan was the first to curse, completely losing his earlier composure. He had realized that Xiao Shiye actually intended to make that Spirit Treasure self-detonate!

On the other side, Liu Xin nearly spat blood.

Such a treasure, capable of seizing the fortune of heaven and earth, could usually only be possessed by Foundation Establishment True Men. For you, Xiao Shiye, to possess one is one thing, but to actually take it out and make it self-detonate?

It was simply a waste of heavenly resources!

Even more preposterous was that the Spirit Treasure pagoda showed no intention of resisting at all; instead, it actively cooperated, swelling so rapidly that there was no time to stop it...

"Boom!"

The next second, an explosive blaze engulfed everything.
