# Chapter 114: Forty Percent Dao Insight

The night was at its darkest.

Inside the cave.

A flash of spiritual light illuminated the dim cavern for an instant before vanishing again.

Though complete darkness should have reigned.

To Zhang Jing's eyes, it might as well have been broad daylight.

Still, he waved his hand lightly.

The Five Treasures Spiritual River flashed briefly as a spell leaped from its waters, rising slowly to the cave ceiling where it blossomed into bright illumination.

The sudden light.

Instantly revealed Zhang Jing's pale complexion.

This session of comprehending the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Insight had lasted over four hours.

During this time, maintaining full activation of the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed had nearly drained his mental and spiritual energy completely.

At this thought.

Zhang Jing willed the jade talisman to appear.

[Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Insight (426/1000)]

Seeing the comprehension progress now at 426, a faint smile touched the corners of his eyes.

With three and a half months remaining.

By any calculation, time was more than sufficient.

Zhang Jing closed his eyes in relief and began meditating.

His breathing gradually settled.

The extreme pallor of his face slowly began to fade.

The next day.

With only partial recovery of his mental and spiritual energy, Zhang Jing rose early, pushed open his door, and headed straight for the caves where Senior Brother Liu and Senior Brother Yang resided.

Before long.

In a spacious cavern.

"What? You're leaving?" Liu Lizhi and Yang Bai stared at Zhang Jing in unison, expressions of disbelief coloring their faces.

Within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

Farewells were typically only given when one planned to ascend to another Void Heaven level.

After all, to cultivators like them, a single Void Heaven layer wasn't particularly vast—traveling from one end to the other took at most seven or eight hours.

That Zhang Jing came to bid farewell.

Clearly meant he intended to proceed to the Ninth Void Heaven.

But—

He'd only spent a month and a half in the Eighth Void Heaven. Could he really be ready so soon?

"Indeed, I plan to enter the Ninth Void Heaven soon, which is why I've come to bid farewell to both senior brothers today. I also wish to express my gratitude for your guidance and care these past six weeks."

Zhang Jing said gratefully.

Opposite him.

Liu Lizhi and Yang Bai exchanged glances, momentarily speechless.

After a long pause.

"Junior Brother, are you truly confident?"

Liu Lizhi asked, his voice dry with disbelief.

He still found it hard to accept.

Zhang Jing's strength upon first entering the Eighth Void Heaven was something he knew well.

In his initial estimation, even with Zhang Jing's terrifying talent, he should have needed at least three to four months in the Eighth Void Heaven.

After all, Zhang Jing had spent a full two months in the Seventh.

Yet now—

A mere month and a half!

How was he getting faster?

Especially when Liu Lizhi considered his own eight-month stay in the Eighth Void Heaven compared to Zhang Jing's six weeks—he could only shake his head repeatedly.

Facing them.

Zhang Jing smiled and nodded.

"Ah—"

Seeing this, Liu Lizhi exhaled slowly and said:

"If you're confident, then this senior brother won't say more. Take care, Junior Brother!"

"Take care, Junior Brother!"

Yang Bai echoed.

Then, as if suddenly remembering something, an intrigued expression crossed his face.

"Heh, I wonder how the Pavilion Master and Senior Brother You will react after the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven concludes. Tsk! Surely they can't still want Junior Brother Zhang Jing to pursue the Array Talisman path?"

"Even if they wished it, I doubt the Academy Head would allow it."

Three days later.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes from his stone slab meditation, a flash of five-colored spiritual light bursting forth.

The pitch-black cave instantly brightened.

Now, with his mental and spiritual energy fully restored.

And forty percent of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Insight firmly under his control.

He rose slowly.

His vast spiritual sense swept through the cave one final time to ensure nothing was left behind before he pushed open the door and stepped outside.

Looking upward.

Without hesitation.

Zhang Jing transformed into a streak of dark light, shooting straight toward the Stairway to Heaven.

Fifth Step!

Sixth Step!

Ninth Step!

"Too weak. Far too weak!"

Zhang Jing's heart swelled with exhilaration.

The guardian spirits that had once seemed overwhelmingly powerful.

Now couldn't withstand even a single breath against him.

Even the strongest Ninth Step guardian spirit had barely emerged from its shadowy state—before it could even glimpse Zhang Jing's form—when a dark serpent the length of a chopstick pierced straight through its chest.

The motion was utterly smooth, as if meeting no resistance whatsoever.

Immediately after.

Lunar energy erupted violently, freezing the last vestiges of the spirit's vitality.

All the while, Zhang Jing stood calmly at the center of the Ninth Step, watching dispassionately, his heart undisturbed.

Wasn't this exactly how it should be when one comprehended forty percent of a Dao Insight?

The Dao pattern in his palm flashed.

+400,000 Spiritual Essence!

A glimmer of satisfaction appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes before he transformed back into a streak of light and soared upward.

Below.

An inconspicuous wisp of dark energy suddenly flew from the guardian spirit's corpse, hastily chasing after Zhang Jing to settle around his wrist as an unremarkable black bracelet.

Ninth Void Heaven.

Swirling mists enveloped the sky, so dense they blotted out the heavens, creating an ethereal fairyland illusion.

Deep within the thick fog, the nine-tiered Stairway to Heaven loomed faintly visible, stretching endlessly toward the celestial heights.

Perhaps due to the overwhelming mist, an eerie silence pervaded the entire Ninth Void Heaven.

Then—

The silence shattered!

A dark rift suddenly appeared at the Stairway, causing the surrounding mists to form terrifying currents that spanned the sky as they were devoured by the abyssal tear.

And within these misty torrents.

A streak of dark light surged against the flow.

In an instant, it landed on the first step of the Stairway, materializing into a young figure.

"The Ninth Void Heaven."

Zhang Jing surveyed his surroundings impassively.

He noted.

The number of shadowy figures along the Stairway had drastically diminished.

Unlike before, where they had crowded densely along the expansive steps in layer upon layer.

Just as Zhang Jing was observing.

Crack!

One of the shadows began to stir, its dark hue rapidly fading.

At the sound.

Zhang Jing turned, his gaze sharpening.

The creature resembled an ox but lacked horns, its body covered in thick cyan scales. Most strikingly, it had only a single leg.

At first glance.

Zhang Jing thought it bore remarkable resemblance to the legendary Kui bull from his previous life's myths.

Though its power was worlds apart.

Still—

"Coincidence? Or something more? No matter—I'll likely find out after ascending to the upper realm."

A contemplative expression crossed Zhang Jing's face.

Then.

With a thought.

The black bracelet around his wrist detached again, transforming into a miniature dark serpent that shot toward the creature.

Thud!

A soft sound echoed as a tiny black hole appeared in the Kui-like guardian spirit's forehead.

The Dao pattern in his palm flashed.

+500,000 Spiritual Essence!

"Slaying a guardian spirit yields half a million... meaning ordinary spirit beasts here should provide about fifty thousand each. Even just ten a day would mean five hundred thousand essence."

Zhang Jing quickly ran the calculations.

"To fully comprehend the Dao Insight, I still need just over ten million spiritual essence—about twenty days' work."

At this realization.

Zhang Jing exhaled softly, his resolve firm.

Then he transformed back into a streak of light and continued his ascent.
