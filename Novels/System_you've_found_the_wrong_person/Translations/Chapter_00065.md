# Chapter 65: One Man Against a Nation—Only Gongshu Remains  

Beneath the vast sky, a fierce wind howled, and the sound of weeping shook the heavens.  

Tears streamed from Jin Wuming's eyes, rolling down his cheeks in a pitiful display. Yet, despite his disheveled appearance, his movements grew increasingly ferocious. The air trembled, distorted, and wailed helplessly under the overwhelming force and speed of his strikes.  

A crimson aura of blood energy continuously surged around Jin Wuming, coiling around him like a demonic tempest, accentuating his indomitable presence.  

Leng Wuye's expression darkened, his eyes a mix of shock and fury.  

This "Heavenly Weeping Hand" Jin Wuming was far stronger than his ranking on the Human Ranking List suggested—he was easily capable of breaking into the top ten. Even if he might not succeed, his strength was undoubtedly close to that level.  

Had this been the only issue, Leng Wuye could have suppressed it. But Dou Changsheng's strength was also beyond expectations. When he had left the capital, he hadn't even condensed the Five Qi. Yet, under the moonlight, he had slain Jin Sanming with a single sword strike, instantly completing the Five Qi Convergence.  

That alone was already astonishingly fast. But now, two of his Three Flowers had already bloomed. Had Leng Wuye arrived just a few days later, Dou Changsheng would likely have achieved the Three Flowers Gathering and Five Qi Convergence.  

With Sun Duxiu's zither music amplifying his power, Dou Changsheng now wielded strength comparable to the Xiantian Profound Realm. His supreme technique, the Thirteen Swords of Gengjin, had caused Leng Wuye considerable trouble. Each sword strike carried immense force, as if his innate true essence was limitless, and the sheer momentum of his attacks had become a major hindrance.  

Jin Wuming and Dou Changsheng fighting side by side had actually managed to hold Leng Wuye to a standstill.  

For a Pure Yang Grandmaster, this was an immense humiliation.  

Once news of this battle spread, Leng Wuye would undoubtedly be branded the weakest Pure Yang Grandmaster in history. The world wouldn't care about his condition, nor would they acknowledge Jin Wuming and Dou Changsheng's extraordinary strength. All they would remember was that a Pure Yang Grandmaster had failed to defeat two mere Xiantian martial artists.  

Leng Wuye's attacks grew fiercer by the moment.  

His iron fists darkened, as if ink spilled from them, tainting the very fabric of the world. The black energy spread like a stain upon a pristine painting.  

Jin Wuming's expression twisted between laughter and tears, an eerie sight. His voice turned sharp and hoarse, as if another person spoke through him.  

"Leng Wuye, your mind is in chaos," he sneered. "Not only have your mechanical arts been broken, but your spirit has been shattered as well. This impatience and rage—you're nothing but an empty shell now."  

"I need a worthy achievement to break into the top ten of the Human Ranking List."  

"And here you are, delivered to me by the heavens themselves."  

"To refuse such a gift would invite calamity!"  

The wind howled, lifting Jin Wuming into the air. A series of metallic glints appeared at his waist—thumb-sized iron fragments that hovered before him. With a sweep of his hand, the fragments assembled into a slender, elegant dagger.  

The blade gleamed under the sunlight, its edge flickering with a cold light. A gem embedded in the hilt pulsed with crimson veins that spread across the weapon, transforming it into a blood-red saber.  

Jin Wuming's tongue, long and scarlet, slowly licked the back of the blade.  

"Compared to using my hands," he murmured, "I prefer the blade."  

With a single slash, his aura transformed.  

The eerie presence vanished, replaced by an overwhelming majesty.  

The strike summoned a surging sea of blood. The saber danced like a dragon, its vibrations conjuring a crimson tide that blotted out the sky. The towering waves crashed down with earth-shattering force, as if intent on crushing all in their path.  

Leng Wuye's right arm swelled grotesquely, expanding to a monstrous size before he unleashed a devastating punch. The sheer visual impact was terrifying, the pressure alone flattening everything in its vicinity.  

A scorching heat radiated from the strike, making Dou Changsheng feel as though he stood within a furnace.  

With Jin Wuming's explosive assault, Leng Wuye finally revealed a fraction of his true power as a Pure Yang Grandmaster. His Mechanical Sage Fist reached new heights of destructive potential. The two combatants had escalated to their ultimate techniques, locked in a deadly exchange.  

Jin Wuming saw an opportunity—to slay a Pure Yang Grandmaster and claim the fame that came with it. He unleashed his hidden trump card without hesitation.  

The Blood Saber was a treasure artifact, its radiance dazzling, its power unmatched. It elevated Jin Wuming's combat prowess to unprecedented levels.  

At this critical moment, Dou Changsheng could not afford to hold back.  

The Hero's Sword trembled violently in his grip, as if awakening.  

A surge of spiritual intent gathered within the blade. In the next instant, the sword shot from Dou Changsheng's hand.  

Sword Flight.  

Not the art of sword control—not a combat technique.  

But Dou Changsheng had tested this before. Sword Flight was, in essence, a rudimentary form of sword control.  

As long as he remained atop the Hero's Sword, it wasn't true sword control.  

Every change in direction was merely an adjustment—so long as his mind remained flexible, solutions would always outnumber obstacles.  

The Thirteen Swords of Gengjin was a supreme technique, but Dou Changsheng had yet to master it fully. Thus, Sword Flight had become his strongest method of attack.  

Though lacking in versatility, its straightforward, unstoppable thrust was unmatched.  

The Hero's Sword streaked through the air like a comet piercing the moon, a white rainbow splitting the sun.  

The moment it left his hand, it was already at Leng Wuye's chest.  

The sword's tip gleamed with a deadly light before plunging into Leng Wuye's torso. At the same time, Leng Wuye's colossal iron fist collided head-on with Jin Wuming's Blood Saber.  

With Leng Wuye's attention fully occupied, Dou Changsheng's lightning-fast sneak attack succeeded—the Hero's Sword impaled Leng Wuye's chest.  

A deafening explosion erupted as the two forces clashed. The shockwave obliterated everything in its path, evaporating rocks and soil, stripping the earth bare.  

Yet, despite being pierced through the heart, Leng Wuye did not fall.  

He remained standing, towering over the battlefield, his expression devoid of emotion. The gaping hole in his chest revealed no organs—only emptiness.  

Then, a thunderous crack echoed through the sky.  

The wooden bird hovering above shattered.  

A towering figure emerged from within, pushing aside the debris.  

His right arm was massive, his stature imposing, his face expressionless as he stepped forward.  

This was but the first.  

One after another, identical figures emerged—five in total, standing in a row, their hollow gazes fixed upon Dou Changsheng and Jin Wuming.  

The first Leng Wuye, his chest hollowed out, collapsed—only to be caught by one of the giant arms of his duplicates.  

The five Leng Wuyes stared unblinkingly at their foes.  

"I invited you as guests with good intentions," they spoke in unison. "Yet you repay my kindness with insolence."  

"You shattered my puppet, destroyed my mechanisms."  

"A year ago, anyone who learned this secret would not have been allowed to live."  

"But now, my Colossus Soldiers are complete. These are but trivial matters."  

"I welcome the heroes of the world to witness them."  

"Step onto the island."  

Dou Changsheng sighed.  

"One man against a nation—only Gongshu remains."  

He had never understood this saying before.  

Now, he finally did.  

The entire Mechanical Gate—it seemed there was only Gongshu.  

No outsiders at all.
