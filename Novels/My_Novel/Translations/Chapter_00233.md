Chapter 233: A Troubled Heart, The Siege Of The Mountain

Starry lights shone bright, conspiring to outshine the moon.
The night breeze blew gently.

Li Xian practiced diligently as instructed, using the stars as his guide. The "Seven Star Step" involved celestial principles, but it had been simplified and stripped down to be easy and concise.

If it were not so, Li Xian would have to sit upright and study the principles of astronomy and the stars for three months before practicing the martial art. He would have to compose a star chart first, then apply it to his footwork.

When executed, the steps were incredibly fast, like scattered stars appearing in the east and west, seemingly omnipresent. Naturally, Li Xian's "Seven Star Step" did not possess such profound mystery.

However, it perfectly suited his current needs: lightening his body, increasing his speed, and making his movements agile. It was like a specific remedy that took effect immediately.

[Seven Star Step]
[Proficiency: 15/600 (Entry Level)]
[Description: It encompasses the changes of the celestial sphere and glimpses the vastness of the stars. This martial art traces its origins to an extremely prestigious source. However, after being repeatedly stripped down, it is now merely a movement technique and lightness skill that contains the principles of the stars.]
[Practicing lightness skill according to the star chart, Proficiency +1]

Li Xian had just started learning the lightness skill and immediately felt its wonder. His body felt light as a feather; with a single leap, he had the posture of a swooping wild goose.

The Seven Star Step aimed to transform internal Qi into seven clusters of energy, storing them separately in the Huangting, Niwan, Mingmen, Tanzhong, Jiaji, Weilu, and Baihui acupoints, corresponding to the Seven Stars in the sky.

The Qi remained condensed and did not disperse, making the body as light as a goose. The whole body was wrapped in a light force, and following the footwork of the star chart, the speed was astonishing. Furthermore, when leaping into the air, one could break through the seven acupoints—Huangting, Niwan, Mingmen, Tanzhong, Jiaji, Weilu, and Baihui—suddenly stepping on air to ascend even higher.

The lightness skills of the martial world generally adhere to three standards: evasion, speed, and ascent. Of course, superior lightness skills possess greater capabilities. The Seven Star Step could be considered outstanding in "evasion" and "speed," but it was particularly exceptional in "ascent."

Stepping seven times in mid-air was incredibly powerful. Li Xian practiced obsessively, completely immersed in it. He then thought, "Martial lightness skills must ultimately be combined with actual scenarios. The Seven Star Step's consecutive steps in the air are more for show than practical use."

"And... if I were to fall from a high place and use the Seven Star Steps, it would only slow the descent."

[Proficiency: 169/600 (Entry Level)]

Li Xian was full of energy and had just acquired a lightness skill. He treated it like a treasure, exploring its secrets. In the blink of an eye, dawn broke and the stars vanished.

"Without the stars, I can't follow the star chart. But since I've reached the entry level, I can still accumulate progress by practicing step by step. However, I've practiced all night, so I should take a break."

Last night, Wen Caishang watched the moon and stars, observing the wicked servant practicing lightness skills. She felt an inexplicable sense of peace and gradually fell asleep. Seeing her sleeping peacefully, with her willow-like brows slightly furrowed, vaguely showing a hint of her former demeanor, Li Xian decided not to disturb her.

He left the cave to find a stream to wash up. The cold water on his face sent a shiver down his spine.

"Hiding here is only a temporary measure. The Sword Rain Pavilion, the Yellow Sand Sect, and the others will surely make a move. I cannot sit and wait for death; I must find a way to break out."

Li Xian pondered for a moment, then returned to the cave to get his sword. He moved large stones to block the cave entrance, sprinkled mud, sand, and grass over them, and then scattered repellent powder.

"While the Madam hasn't woken up, I will act alone. I must get into the city quickly and obtain a map. Once I understand the terrain, I can make a plan."

Li Xian left lightly. His Qi Lake was full, reaching fifty-two feet. The internal Qi was condensed into clusters in the seven acupoints: Huangting, Tanzhong, etc. He then utilized the essence of the Breeze Leg and the Vast Leg. In a single step, he shot forward two zhang, climbing trees and slopes in an instant.

He quickly exited the forest.

To avoid accidents, Li Xian picked wild fruits to fill his stomach. He replenished his internal Qi before entering the town.

Li Xian有意 to avoid attention, keeping his head slightly lowered. Seeing that the town was not large, he felt a bit down. Although the county administration had maps, the area was remote and sparsely populated, so few paid attention to maps. Maps that hadn't been updated for years or even a decade were the norm, usually rough sketches of mountain terrain.

After walking about seven or eight li, he saw a bookstore named "Good Scholar Bookstore." Li Xian asked, "Proprietor, do you have any good books to recommend?"

The proprietor was a young man who said, "Good books, yes, yes. This book on worldly scriptures and doctrines contains immense knowledge. knowledge. If you master it, it will be of great benefit to your future path."

Li Xian beat around the bush, casually picking a few miscellaneous books. Midway, he asked casually, "Do you have a map here?"

"What do you want a map for?" the proprietor asked with a smile. In this chaotic Great Wu Dynasty, maps could be trivial or critical. Trivial, they were just paper and ink; critical, they were secrets.

Great clans and local powers personally drew maps, surveying geomancy, and never sold them externally. Firstly, to exploit natural resources—minerals, firewood, fishing, herbs—which were vital for development. Secondly, to understand the terrain for unexpected needs. Moreover, tomb raiding and selecting ancestral mausoleums were closely related to geography.

However, ordinary people rarely bought maps.

Li Xian said, "Just curious."
The proprietor said, "We do. Two taels of silver. You must pay to get it."

Li Xian paid for the map along with the miscellaneous books, spending three taels of silver. After getting the map, he turned a corner and hid in a dark alley to check it. He was greatly disappointed. The map only depicted the surrounding towns, mountains, and forests...

It was nothing special, covering only a radius of a few dozen li. Li Xian cursed, "I didn't have much silver to begin with; this was a waste." He felt a pang of heartache.

He couldn't help but sigh, "The days of spending money like water are gone forever. They say a thousand-foot tower can be built in a day; the ancients really knew what they were talking about."

Walking down the street, he was at a loss. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted several young men. They wore coarse cloth casual clothes, but they walked with a steady gait, their brows furrowed, and they wore long swords at their waists.

Li Xian pondered, "These young men conceal martial arts within them; they are definitely not ordinary people. Appearing here, they must have a purpose. I suspect they are from the Sword Rain Pavilion. But... they are quite clever to be wearing plain clothes. If I hadn't looked closely, I really wouldn't have noticed. I'll follow them and see if I can find any clues."

He secretly followed them, lightening his steps. The group remained unaware, entering an inn to rest. Li Xian followed, and to blend in, he used his last silver to order half a roast chicken and a few side dishes...

He heard the group talking:

"The Sword Alliance's hunt has really been full of twists and turns. I heard that they had already caught that villainous woman. Hey! But her little toy boy was cunning and treacherous; he used some tricks and rescued her again."

"If it weren't for that, we would have returned to the sect long ago. Why would we have to dress like this, in plain clothes and simple attire, hiding in the surrounding towns?"

Li Xian understood: "It seems they don't know my whereabouts. Knowing that Wen Caishang's internal Qi is completely empty, they changed their strategy, scattering disciples to expand the search area."

He listened quietly.

The group said, "The scale of this operation is truly不小. The Sword Alliance consists of five sects. Originally, this area was patrolled by the Sword Rain Pavilion, the Yellow Sand Sect, and the Taixin Sect. Now, forces like the Shiluo Village and the Wujido Sect are also surrounding it."

"Yes, I reckon the Sword Alliance's hunt is about to end. Let them hide for another three or five days; what good will it do?"

"Alright, the food is here. Eat up, eat up. After eating and drinking our fill, we still have to go to 'Lotus Village' outside the city to check."

As they spoke, they took out a map.

Li Xian's brow furrowed and then relaxed. The waiter brought the food to the table. Li Xian had no appetite, so he asked for oil paper and wrapped up the half roast chicken, crispy beans, braised meat, and other dishes, hiding them in his chest.

He left the shop first and waited for the time it takes to eat a meal. The Sword Rain Pavilion disciples, full and satisfied, walked out of the inn with bulging stomachs, arms around each other's shoulders.

Li Xian followed quietly. Passing through a crowded area, he quickened his steps and reached out to steal. His movements were light, like reaching into clouds to catch mist. The "Cloud-Catching Hand," which he had mastered to perfection, came in handy.

He took the map without a sound. Then, he casually picked two money pouches.

Li Xian slowed his pace and blended into the crowd. Then, he quietly turned into an alley and hurried out of the city. After this commotion, it was already noon.

There was no one around.

Li Xian opened the money pouches and couldn't help but spit, "You're disciples of a major sect, how can you be so poor!" The two pouches contained a few hundred copper coins and a few碎银 (broken silver pieces). Together, they were worth no more than two or three taels of silver.

Li Xian did not know.

The Sword Rain Pavilion had been in decline for over a decade, all thanks to Wen Caishang. The Sword Rain Pavilion's businesses were two: sword forging and medicinal herbs.

Wen Caishang had killed their swordsmiths and burned their medicinal herb mountains. She ruined their structure, disrupted their plans, and damaged their vitality. The sect's days were tight, so its disciples naturally had to tighten their belts.

The stolen "map" was large, detailing the surrounding mountain terrain and river systems in great detail. Li Xian was delighted and thought to himself, "This must have been bought in a large city!"

The map indicated that they were located in the southwest of "Flower Water Prefecture." The mountain where Li Xian and Wen Caishang were hiding was called "Chaos Fragrance Mountain." A scholar who once held the breath of luck passed through this mountain and found a lover. In his excitement, he named the mountain and wrote a poem. "Chaos Fragrance Mountain" meant: a fragrant heart (fang xin) begins to be troubled (chaos).

However, on the southeast side of the mountain, there grew countless exotic flowers. "Chaos Fragrance Mountain" also carried the meaning of "chaotic flowers in profusion."

"What is this?"

Li Xian looked closely and suddenly frowned. He saw that besides the mountain trends, the map also marked "red dots." Next to the red dots were written times like "Mao hour, third quarter"..."Hai hour, second quarter"...

"This is a search map. There is a very clever person in the Sword Rain Pavilion. He arranged for people to patrol everywhere, stipulating specific times. In this way, he can maximize the use of his manpower and maintain order and stability..."

"According to the map, all the villages around Chaos Fragrance Mountain have been patrolled today. Tomorrow, they will besiege Chaos Fragrance Mountain... They are厉害 (厉害 -厉害 means厉害, but here it's used as an adjective, so "impressive" or "formidable" fits, but the tone is negative, so "They are formidable" or "They are very smart") enough. They actually anticipated that the Madam and I would hide in the forest."

"And... this map is only from the Sword Rain Pavilion. The Yellow Sand Sect and the Taixin Sect must have their own arrangements, making the encirclement even tighter! The situation is very bad!"

Li Xian rolled up the map and钻入 (钻入 -钻入 means "drilled into," but "entered" or "plunged into" is better for narrative flow) the forest thicket. He ran back to the deep cave. When he moved the cover, he saw Wen Caishang with red-rimmed eyes, looking pitifully delicate.

It turned out that...

Not long after Li Xian left, Wen Caishang woke up. Their relationship had gradually changed; it was no longer a master-servant dependency... Wen Caishang was physically weak, her body unable to move, but her desires surged.

Although she guessed that Li Xian had likely gone to the city to get a map, she couldn't help but have a纷纭 (纷纭 -纷纭 means "diverse and numerous," here meaning "wild") train of thought, thinking of this and that. She thought of things she had never considered in her entire life.

Wen Caishang was extremely powerful, but she had been powerful too early. With her strength as her backing, she always showed her cold, ruthless, and vicious side. The weak looked down on her, and the strong feared her. Only at this moment was she different from all the past.

Wen Caishang said coldly, "Good, I thought you had run away again!"

Li Xian smiled and said, "Madam is wise and mighty, how could you not guess that I went to get a map?"

"Looking like this, how am I wise and mighty? I can't even move right now," Wen Caishang said. "When I woke up and didn't see you, I thought you had tricked me into learning lightness skill just to run for your life alone."

Her expression was strange, and she said as if possessed, "I almost hated you again."

Li Xian was moved. Seeing Wen Caishang's genuine emotion, he gently picked her up and said, "Then you guessed wrong."

Wen Caishang spat, "Wicked servant." She wasn't angry or hateful anymore. Suddenly, she felt a daze: *Wen Caishang, Wen Caishang, are you really such an easily coaxed woman? This wicked servant left without a word, and when he comes back, you're not angry?*

*That's right... I can't move now, so I'm just pretending not to be angry. I'll settle the score later, and I'll settle it hard.*
