# Chapter 66: Settling Karmic Debts and Bathing in Beast Blood

In Pang Long’s courtyard, Li Xian had barely stepped through the gate when he saw Pang Long hunched over his desk, writing. For a moment, Li Xian thought his eyes were playing tricks on him. He rubbed them and looked again, only to find the scene unchanged.

"Commander Pang, what brings you such elegance today?" Li Xian joked.

Pang Long snapped out of his focus. Seeing Li Xian, he let out a hearty laugh and beckoned him over. "Li Xian, come quickly and take a look at this notice. How is it written?"

The notice was written with bold, straightforward strokes. The brushwork was rough, lacking in finesse or charm, purely direct and unadorned. The writing mirrored the man himself—it suited Pang Long perfectly.

Li Xian gave it a once-over and was secretly startled. The handwriting was ordinary, yet it contained hints of martial arts mastery. The strokes seemed to blend several different martial techniques. Pang Long was clearly showing off on purpose.

After reading the content, Li Xian asked curiously, "Are we recruiting new guards?"

"Indeed," Pang Long sighed, picking up the notice to admire it in the light. He grew more pleased the longer he looked. "Lately, we've suffered quite a few casualties among the guards. We have no choice but to recruit more."

"This afternoon, we'll post the notice at the vegetable market in Qingning County. I expect quite a few candidates."

The notice was simple and clear: recruiting fifteen guards. Applicants needed a martial arts foundation, be under twenty years of age, and would receive a monthly salary of one hundred and fifty coins. After a year of perfect attendance, they would be granted a basic martial art.

Li Xian said, "There will definitely be no shortage of applicants. With these conditions, even disciples from martial arts schools would be tempted."

"Of course," Pang Long said proudly. "To have the honor of serving the Madam is their fortune."

"Commander Pang, now that I've been promoted from Class C to Class B, I should be able to claim another martial art, right?" Li Xian got straight to the point. He knew Pang Long was a straightforward man; there was no need to beat around the bush.

"Didn't you just receive the Azure Silk Palm?" Pang Long frowned. "On the path of martial arts, the biggest taboo is greed. For an ordinary guard, mastering one martial art a year is already considered a lot. You've only been here for a couple of months, and you've already learned the Four Directions Fist, the Breeze Chasing Kick, and the Azure Silk Palm... You need to properly consolidate your foundation and digest these three arts first."

"You make a valid point," Li Xian smiled. "I was just thinking, it's a waste not to claim it if I'm eligible. I can claim it now, but I don't have to practice it immediately. It's always better to have an extra martial art in your arsenal."

"That's also a reasonable way to look at it," Pang Long nodded. "Follow me."

Pang Long led the way to a separate room with a heavy wooden door that required an iron key to open. Basic martial arts were under Pang Long's management. Although they were basic, they were quite valuable outside. In the Great Wu Empire, martial arts were precious.

"Go ahead and pick one," Pang Long said, standing outside the door.

The room contained a wide variety of basic martial arts, covering fists, kicks, palms, sabers, spears, staves, and swords.

"I currently have a martial art for my fists, kicks, and palms," Li Xian thought to himself as he walked through the room, his eyes scanning the shelves. "The one I should pick now should preferably be... a weapon art."

The differences between these basic martial arts were minimal. There were fist arts like Four Directions Fist, Central Upright Fist, Straight Courage Fist, and Three Talents Fist. There were leg arts like Breeze Chasing Kick and Crescent Moon Arc Kick. The key was not to pick a specific technique, but a category or direction.

"I'll choose a saber art!" Li Xian made his decision.

There was a row of saber arts, all basic saber techniques that were largely similar.

"The Great Luo Saber... I'll take you."

Li Xian picked up a saber manual. A quick glance showed him that the saber style involved wide, sweeping movements with a powerful aura. He was very satisfied and tucked it away.

In the days that followed, life returned to normal. Li Xian was now a Class B guard, and his patrol duties didn't consume much of his energy. He spent two hours on patrol each day, and the rest of his time was dedicated to martial arts training. He was immersed in the Dao of martial arts and felt that time flew by.

**[Breeze Chasing Kick]**
**[Proficiency: 152/5000 (Great Mastery)]**
**[Description: After enduring the hardship of leg training, you have finally achieved Great Mastery. You have caught a glimpse of the initial scenery of the Dao of martial arts, gaining a deeper understanding of the Breeze Chasing Kick.]**

**[Azure Silk Palm]**
**[Proficiency: 69/2000 (Proficiency)]**
**[Description: Your palm qi flows with ease, its force entangling like a chain. Heaven rewards the diligent. Through relentless, bitter training, you have glimpsed the gateway to the art and have悟ed the trait "Subtle Qi Control" from the Azure Silk Palm.]**

Three days passed, and Li Xian's progress was immense.

When the Breeze Chasing Kick reached Great Mastery, the initial scenery of the Dao of martial arts appeared before his eyes. It was a middle-aged man practicing leg techniques in the mountains. Every kick he threw seemed both slow and fast, heavy and light, making it difficult to fathom. This middle-aged man was likely the martial arts master who created the Breeze Chasing Kick.

Li Xian observed intently, contemplating the true essence of the Dao of martial arts, and benefited greatly.

"I've finally broken past the three hundred mark!"

Every evening, Li Xian would use his condensed qi threads to circulate through his acupoints, sensing his own progress. The qi in his Dantian was accumulating more and more. The qi threads could now travel further, allowing him to break through over three hundred acupoints in a single breath.

"Speaking of which, the Azure Silk Palm truly lives up to its name as a Tier 2 martial art. It's truly formidable. This is only at the Proficiency level, yet the required proficiency is already so high."

Li Xian raised his hand. As he circulated the Azure Silk Palm force, his palm turned a jade-green color, and sixteen strands of internal qi intertwined.

These sixteen strands of internal qi could take a sinister path, invading a person's flesh and knotting there, causing unbearable agony. They could also take a righteous path, where the internal qi, like a river current, would surge forward in wave after wave.

"Jiang Yun may have cultivated this art to Great Mastery, but her memory is flawed, so her palm technique is incomplete and likely has flaws."

"Perhaps... I can now try to settle that karmic debt."

Li Xian was eager to give it a try.

It was now dusk, the hour of Xu (7-9 PM), and most guards were off duty at this time. Li Xian went straight to find Zhao Han and the others.

"Ah!"
"Li... Li Ye... Wh... What brings you here?"

Zhao Han, Zhuo Yilie, and Wang Chun were flustered by Li Xian's sudden visit. The bluish-purple palm prints on their faces had not faded, but they had grown used to them, as if they had fully accepted their fate.

"I'm here to fulfill my promise," Li Xian said calmly.

"Promise?" Zhao Han's feelings were complicated upon seeing Li Xian again.

Li Xian said, "I once said that begging others is not as good as relying on oneself. There was no need to bow and scrape to beg from Jiang Yun. I would help you dissolve the palm prints on your faces myself. I have now learned the Azure Silk Palm. Although I haven't mastered it, I can give it a try."

After explaining his purpose, Li Xian placed his hand on Zhao Han's face.

The principle behind the bluish-purple palm prints left by the Azure Silk Palm wasn't difficult to understand. The Azure Silk Palm has one joint in its finger, and each joint can release a different type of internal qi. Fifteen joints mean fifteen types of internal qi. Adding the one from the palm itself, there are sixteen types in total. The moment the palm strikes, these sixteen qi streams surge out like sixteen threads that entangle with each other, turning into an impossible knot that wreaks havoc within the flesh. The more one tries to dissolve it, the more entangled it becomes.

Li Xian simply used sixteen of his own qi streams cancel them out.

As he circulated his qi, the palm print visibly faded, gradually returning to the original skin color.

Wang Chun, Zhuo Yilie, and the others were ecstatic. The discrimination, insults, and humiliation of this period had finally come to an end.

Li Xian proceeded to dissolve the palm prints for the three of them one by one.

The promise was fulfilled, and the karmic debt was settled.

"Farewell," Li Xian said with a carefree air as he left, not even glancing back at the three men.

"This..."

Overwhelmed with joy, a pang of bitterness welled up in their hearts. Perhaps if they had trusted Li Xian enough back then, the four of them could have been good friends. The current Li Xian was no longer the youngest "fourth brother." He was the glorious Class B guard, Li Ye.

"Li Ye is truly a rare person."
"He's already a Class B guard, yet he still remembers that small promise."
"Alas, it's our misfortune. We aren't worthy of being his friends."

Li Xian was inherently a man of deep feeling who disliked being in debt. He wouldn't say he would repay a kindness tenfold, but he would never repay it with less, and he would repay it whenever he could.

"Li Xian!"

A sudden voice called out to him from behind.

Pang Long strode over, his eyes gleaming. His words were brief: "Bathing in beast blood—there's a spot for you. Come with me quickly!"
