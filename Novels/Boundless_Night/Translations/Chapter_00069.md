# Chapter 69: Immense Anticipation

"I am no longer Cui Chonghe. All that is in the past!"

Qin Ming withdrew his thoughts from the shattered scenes of the past, his eyes gleaming brightly with a fiery, glowing brilliance, his entire being exuding a vibrant energy.

He was now Qin Ming, and there was no going back. What needed to be severed was severed, what needed to be abandoned was abandoned. He didn't need to expect all old acquaintances to recognize him upon meeting again. In the past, it was the terrifying foundation of a thousand-year-old aristocratic family that illuminated Cui Chonghe. Now, he had to rely on himself, advancing step by step. Only then would the heights he reached truly represent the brilliance flowing within him.

"It makes sense that this place was chosen to build a city." Qin Ming noticed that the snow in the forest only reached his knees; it was "mild." It was important to remember that heavy blizzards in the Black and White Mountains in the past two years often reached waist-high. Behind Scarletglow City stood magnificent mountains. Within those undulating ranges were many dangerous mutated creatures, which also meant no shortage of spiritual substances. In front of the city was a vast plain with fields of fire-cultivated crops. Outside the city, a large river flowed into the distance. After thawing in early spring, there would be many large ships coming and going, providing strong transportation capacity. The city walls, built of green stone, were tall, thick, and imposing. The magnificent gate tower stood at the front, with armored soldiers holding long halberds, their weapons glinting coldly. Many people entered and exited the city gate, creating a bustling scene.

Qin Ming wasn't subjected to much scrutiny upon entering the city. The place was very open, with many people from north and south doing business. The streets were paved with green flagstones, completely free of snow, and very clean. As soon as he entered Scarletglow City, various sounds filled his ears. It was much livelier than Silver Vine Town; this area was bustling with people, shoulders brushing against each other. Qin Ming walked along the bustling main street, gazing at the dazzling array of goods in the shops lining both sides of the road. Sometimes, he would pause.

"Child, do you want to become a renowned expert in the Evernight World when you grow up? Hmm, that goal might be a bit too distant. Do you want to join a sect? Do you want to become a member of a mystic cult? Do you want to be chosen by someone from beyond the mundane world? Do you want to get into the higher academies in those giant cities? Golden paths stretch out before you, but you need to start preparing now. Come, quickly, into the shop! Let your mother buy you a secret manual!"

Not just a group of children and teenagers, even Qin Ming was somewhat moved, wanting to enter the old shop filled with books and take a look. He was immediately drawn to a book titled "Great Sun Contemplation Method." The title itself sounded impressive.

"Excuse me, esteemed customer, but this is a rare secret manual, more precious than even advanced Qi techniques. It also means it's incredibly difficult to practice. The prerequisite for learning it is to master the 'Spark Spreading Prairie Meditation Art.' Please come this way; you need to start from the introductory chapters of 'Spark Spreading Prairie'..."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming quickly waved his hand, and soon after, turned and left. These were all printed copies, smelling of ink, all being the lowest-level nascent methods. It was impossible for them to be ancient texts containing the accumulated wisdom of predecessors. He felt he hadn't found the right place. Perhaps there were old, established bookstores that sold rare editions. However, this wasn't what he needed most urgently. What he desired most was spiritual substances. He was eager to undergo his fourth rebirth immediately to recover his memories and fully understand his past.

Qin Ming discovered that there indeed were merchants selling spiritual substances. There was a magnificent five-story building situated in a bustling, prime location where every inch of land was precious. However, he went in and quickly came out again, because merely inquiring about the spiritual substances that could help someone undergo their first rebirth would cost him most of his accumulated Day Gold. As for spiritual substances for a fourth rebirth, that was out of the question. Moreover, from what the old merchant implied, high-level spiritual substances were often out of stock, unobtainable even with Day Gold.

Qin Ming moved around Scarletglow City, gradually learning about everything there. The city had a Tier 4 Fire Spring, whose fiery red glowing liquid never dried up even in winter, gushing out and flowing into various districts of the city. Additionally, there were several Tier 1 and Tier 2 associated Fire Springs scattered throughout the city, increasing the overall brightness of the city. Qin Ming specifically sought out crowded places, actively joining in the excitement. To deeply understand a city, going to such places was always a good idea.

"Young master, take care, come earlier next time."
"Young master, please come upstairs quickly."
...

Qin Ming suddenly stopped. What kind of place was this? On this street, most of the people seen were men, while from the pavilions, the gentle sounds of string and wind instruments drifted.

"Brother Qin, I never expected to run into you here!" someone shouted loudly.

Instantly, many people on the street looked over. This was the first time Qin Ming felt so embarrassed, wanting to cover his face and flee. He knew where this was; it must be Old Man Wu's haunt for squandering money! Moreover, he heard the voice of Old Man Wu's grandson, Wu Zheng, who actually called out to him in public.

"Brother Qin, meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land is truly a great fortune! It's good that you're alright; you've finally arrived safely in Scarletglow City." The seventeen-year-old Wu Zheng rushed over with a face full of smiles, looking very enthusiastic.

"What could happen to me? The person that day was an old acquaintance of mine," Qin Ming replied, while also showing an odd expression. He felt that family talents truly could be inherited. He didn't know if Wu Zheng could reproduce the "Twin Masters of Spear and Arrow" talent, but in terms of swagger, he was probably no weaker than his grandfather, Old Wu. He had only just arrived in Scarletglow City and was already familiar with this street.

"Aren't you here to broaden your horizons? Money should be spent wisely; diligently improving your strength is the absolute truth," Qin Ming advised.

Wu Zheng shook his head and said, "Brother Qin, what are you thinking? I'm just here to listen to zither music, nothing to do with romance." Seeing Qin Ming's strange, clearly disbelieving gaze, he immediately grew anxious and said, "I'm really not lying to you! Many experts who go out of the city to hunt mutated creatures come here afterwards to drink and listen to music. They talk about various terrifying mutated creatures in the mountains and also discuss how to hunt and acquire spiritual substances. I came here to listen for valuable information!"

"What you say is true?" Qin Ming's spirits lifted.

Wu Zheng said, "If you don't believe me, you can ask Brother Xu later. Oh, that's Xu Sheng, the traveling merchant who brought us to Scarletglow City. He's changed professions and decided to become a free spiritual hunter. This time on the road, he was scared half to death by that female mutated creature in the team."

Qin Ming had previously been subtly advising Wu Zheng not to linger in such places, but within moments, he found himself following Wu Zheng up to Drunken Glow Pavilion.

This was indeed a place just for drinking and listening to zither music. Fragrant mist curled gently, and behind the pearl curtains, a beautiful woman was playing the zither, its notes tinkling softly. In the spacious hall, there were many tables, all filled with reborn individuals. People drank and chatted animatedly. It was unclear when exactly this place had become their hub for exchanging information, which left the owner of Drunken Glow Pavilion quite helpless, but as long as business was good, it was fine. Qin Ming and Wu Zheng found a table and sat down, immediately hearing various discussions.

"Have you heard? A six-times mutated mountain monster appeared in Qixia Mountain. We don't know what its true form is, but its strength far exceeds others of its level. It's likely a spiritual creature. Does anyone want to team up to hunt it?"

"You must have a death wish! Spiritual creatures are usually one level stronger than their actual mutation count. It's almost comparable to a seven-times mutated creature!"
...

Qin Ming listened intently, feeling that his trip hadn't been in vain. The people here exchanged information, allowing him to quickly understand the situation in the mountains.

"Little Brother Qin, it's good that you're alright! So, last time when I led the team, not a single person died, and everyone safely arrived in Scarletglow City, haha!" Xu Sheng arrived, looking very enthusiastic upon seeing Qin Ming.

"Brother Xu, your injury..." Qin Ming looked at his neck, where he had been scratched. Ten-odd days had passed, and it had already healed.

Xu Sheng took a sip of wine and said, "Don't even mention it. A descendant of a high-level mutated creature came out for experience; they're allowed into the city by Scarletglow City's high command. But they're pitifully timid. At the slightest rustle, they'd cling to someone and pinch hard. And to top it off, she'd already undergone rebirth multiple times, so I couldn't resist. I was choked unconscious once. I'm not being a traveling merchant anymore; I'm changing professions!"

Qin Ming clinked glasses with him and said, "Changing professions is good. Otherwise, often traveling at night, something might happen one day."

Xu Sheng nodded and said, "That's right. Let me tell you, some old traveling merchants might not be the same people they once were. Who knows how many years ago they were replaced by some unknown creatures. There are many legends in our profession. I've wanted to give it up for a long time!"

Wu Zheng also raised his glass and said, "Let's toast to Brother Xu's successful career change! From now on, your little brother will hang out with you in Scarletglow City. You're a great master; you must guide me more!"

At this moment, a nearby table was discussing the topic of "Thunderflame Alchemy Hall" very enthusiastically, and then many others joined in. Qin Ming's spirits lifted significantly. These people seemed to be mentioning a rare spiritual substance.

"In another half a month, the ice and snow will melt. Then, the spring thunder will roar, and all things will revive. I wonder what the Thunderflame Alchemy Hall on Mount Scarletglow will be like this year, and how many people will dare to brave death and go there to draw lightning into their bodies."

"Every year, some people die. The lucky ones are very few!"
...

Qin Ming was very interested and immediately asked Xu Sheng, who was beside him, as he was a local. "Brother Xu, what's the situation with the Thunderflame Alchemy Hall?"

Xu Sheng, in his early thirties, was a steady person. He immediately advised against it, saying, "Little Qin, are you interested? Although that place holds opportunities, it's too dangerous. Every year, some reborn individuals die there. I advise you to calm down." He explained that very few people could truly seize opportunities there; it was entirely dependent on luck. It would be good if one person appeared every few years.

Qin Ming nodded and said, "I just heard about it for the first time today, and I'm very curious, so I wanted to understand the situation. If it's truly that dangerous, I definitely won't actively approach it."

"Brother Xu, quickly tell us about it," Wu Zheng also urged.

"Then I'll explain it in detail. The Thunderflame Alchemy Hall is located on Mount Scarletglow outside the city. It's said to have at least a thousand years of history. It's a special hall, with roof tiles primarily refined from copper matrix, and also mixed with some rare metals..." During thunderstorms, a strange phenomenon would appear on that copper hall: rolling lightning fireballs and intertwining arcs, exceptionally brilliant. "When lightning strikes, it brings down a portion of heavenly light. Spring thunder is especially unique, containing the essence of all things beginning to emerge. When lightning and heavenly light intertwine, they can nurture a special spiritual substance. Therefore, every year when spring thunder roars, many reborn individuals rush to the Thunderflame Alchemy Hall, attempting to receive the mixture of lightning and heavenly light, hoping to break through, undergo a fierce transformation, and achieve rebirth."

Qin Ming listened entranced, his interest growing stronger and stronger.

Xu Sheng warned, "After being obstructed by the copper hall, the lightning isn't that fierce; it's infinitely weakened. But the most terrifying thing is the heavenly light. How many people can be enveloped by heavenly light from beyond the world and not die? This is even more intense than what falls on spiritual mountains. You absolutely must not try it!"

Qin Ming felt that he absolutely had to go to this place. His biggest concern was the lightning, that kind of natural power was something he couldn't even contemplate at his current stage; if he dared to touch it, he would surely be struck into charcoal. But with the Thunderflame Alchemy Hall "purifying" the lightning, what did he have to fear? He could withstand the baptism of heavenly light. Even if it was significantly stronger than the heavenly light contained within the special nodes of the Black and White Mountains, he estimated it wouldn't be a big problem. Others went there to survive by luck, but he could truly go to Mount Scarletglow and, with his strength, win a fierce transformation and achieve rebirth!

"Counting the days, it's not many until the first heavenly thunder of early spring falls. After a short rest, the time will be upon us." Qin Ming was filled with immense anticipation.
