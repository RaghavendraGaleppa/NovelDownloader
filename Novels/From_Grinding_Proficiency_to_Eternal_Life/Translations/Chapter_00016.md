# Chapter 16: Entering the Mountains

Without the slightest hesitation at the foot of the mountain, Fang Mushan charged forward with great strides, launching a swift collision attack toward the overseer.

He used his shoulder as an axis, sank his waist and hips, his body stretching like a drawn great bow. He shot forward like an arrow, his speed so fierce that even amidst his large, rapid strides, there was a faint "whooshing" sound of splitting wind.

Fang Mushan instantly crashed into the chest of the overseer, who was caught completely off guard and only had time to show a terrified expression.

*Crack-crack-crunch!*

A series of crisp, teeth-grating sounds of shattering bones rang out abruptly. The overseer, as if made of paper, was sent flying far away. He fell to the ground without a sound, his life or death unknown.

Some mine slaves who had taken the opportunity to flee nearby were also震惊 (shocked) by the sight. It was hard to believe that such a seemingly thin and dry body could send a two-hundred-jin overseer flying.

"That seems to be Fang Wen's son."

"The son of the Grand General Who Assists the Country, Fang Wen, Fang Mushan. I've heard of him. At only sixteen, he can lift a thousand jin, his divine strength is unparalleled."

Someone nearby sighed, then carried a hint of joy.

"Following him, we might be able to escape!"

"Such great strength. Just at the minor success of tendon training, yet able to爆发 (explode) such power. Truly, a tiger father has no dog of a son."

Li Haomiao sighed with emotion.

Xu Yunfan pursed his lips at this moment.

Down in the mine cave, without a specific reference for strength, despite his Copper Body Art having reached minor success and his Flying Leg Technique having entered the入门 (initial) stage, he had only beaten up Cui Ye and the other weaklings.

Now, comparing himself to Fang Mushan...

He felt a bit of a testing urge.

It seemed, he could dodge, and it should be quite easy.

Fang Mushan also seemed to have long sensed someone following behind. He turned his head and glanced at Xu Yunfan and the others, a hint of provocation in his eyes as he raised his chin.

The meaning was very clear: if you have the guts, follow me.

Watching the figure charging wildly into the mountains, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate in the slightest. Immediately, he strode out with great steps,疾驰 (rushing) to follow closely.

The group, one in front and the others behind, quickly脱离 (separated) from the battlefield. The sounds of battle gradually grew distant until they were inaudible. Soon, only a small handful of people with decent skills were barely able to keep up.

Xu Yunfan looked back. By now, they were already far from the mining area. Even Lian Yuanzhang leading the black-clad death warriors was very strong, almost suppressing the overseers and beating them down.

Unfortunately, Zhang Shuyang could be so steady; he must have had a backup plan.

Seeing this, Li Haomiao said leisurely, "Thinking about how things are going at Ningguta?"

"I really want to see who wins and who loses."

Xu Yunfan's gaze was fixed on the rugged path ahead. His feet landed precisely, his movements agile, not daring to be the slightest bit careless. Running at high speed required concentration.

Experts of the external three unions of sinew, bone, and skin, with a casual lift of their hands and movement of their feet, could easily tear through the air. Every action carried the momentum of wind and thunder. Especially when Zhang Shuyang and Lian Yuanzhang exchanged blows with weapons, swinging their weapons brought about terrifying "whooshing" sounds of empty space,令人震撼 (shocking).

Human power could actually reach such a level.

"Since that vicious woman has a plan, she definitely wouldn't just have Zhang Shuyang come alone. I'm afraid there are archers lying in ambush all around, and at least a few experts of the same level providing support. Perhaps, a master of the flesh-refining realm might come as well.

If it only relies on Lian Yuanzhang's wave, he will likely die under a rain of arrows. Even if he can block the arrow rain, an external three unions martial teacher who hasn't trained out劲力 (force) has limited endurance for physical strength and will probably die from exhaustion."

Li Haomiao analyzed: "With that vicious woman's malicious nature, it is absolutely possible for her to send a grand expert. Lian Yuanzhang will likely fall here."

The flesh-refining realm is after the external three unions of sinew, bone, and skin. It is from the external to the internal, rubbing out force from within the flesh and blood. Only with force can one be called a true great martial artist.

This is the mark of the supernatural.

"However..." Li Haomiao's words turned: "There are too many forces behind the mine slaves of Ningguta. No one knows if some old monster might suddenly appear. At that time, it would be a good show. It's a pity that both you and I are old and weak, unable to stay steady."

Xu Yunfan: "Who are you calling old and weak? Don't include me in your own crippled state."

He paused, then pursued the question: "For whom is that Grand General Lian attacking Ningguta?"

Li Haomiao was silent for a moment, then said slowly: "It should be for me."

"You're not going to recognize him?"

"In that kind of situation, standing with him, I would die even faster."

Li Haomiao spoke coldly, and Xu Yunfan felt a sense of sorrow hearing it.

Although these days of getting along with Li Haomiao, the other's nature isn't necessarily purely good, he does have a benevolent heart.

But for Xu Yunfan, this kind of benevolence was truly a bit hard to accept.

Lian Yuanzhang fighting and risking his life for him like this, yet being coldly abandoned.

"You think I'm heartless?"

Li Haomiao naturally knew what Xu Yunfan was thinking. Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, as if thinking of something, the corner of his mouth twitched, and he didn't speak again.

After resting for a while, Fang Mushan patted the dirt from his butt and got up to continue forward.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan didn't dawdle either, got up and followed closely.

Fang Mushan's steps were extremely fast; a single stride covered the distance of four or five of an ordinary person's. Although the mountain ridge path was rugged, he walked as if on flat ground, his speed not diminishing in the slightest.

The four or five people with decent skills beside him looked at each other, and finally someone spoke.

"The eight hundred li of barren plains and icy wilderness; the further in we go, the colder the weather. We are all dressed thinly. If we go on for a long time, even if we aren't caught by the mine supervision府 (government), we'll likely freeze to death in this wilderness."

Someone else shook their head: "Going to Ningguta is also death. In the eight hundred li of barren plains, there is always a chance to survive. If we stay here..."

He looked at the footprints they had made coming here, all muddy, the traces extremely obvious. If the mine supervision government recovers its breath, there is a high probability they can follow the traces to pursue them.

The few of them no longer hesitated,紧跟着 (closely following) the backs of Xu Yunfan and Fang Mushan to chase after them.

In this kind of place, sticking together always increases the survival rate much more than being alone.

Until the morning light was faint, the rising sun appeared, even dyeing the white snow on the mountain ridges with a layer of golden brilliance.

In a leeward mountain valley, Fang Mushan stopped his steps, found a leeward spot to sit down, and turned to look at Xu Yunfan who was carrying Li Haomiao. He raised his chin.

"The sky is vast, the earth is great. Why do you keep following me?"

At this moment, only Xu Yunfan was closely following Fang Mushan; the others had long fallen behind completely, their whereabouts unknown.

Xu Yunfan: "I think this direction is the most convenient route to escape the mine field."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan glanced at the Flying Leg Technique proficiency prompts flooding his vision.

'You use the force application method of the Flying Leg Technique day and night, running along the rugged mountain paths. Your steps become increasingly agile, and the proficiency of the Flying Leg Technique has significantly increased.'

'You shuttle back and forth, crossing mountains and rivers, precisely controlling your breathing rhythm. The power of kicking off the ground is stronger, and the proficiency of the Flying Leg Technique has climbed.'

'...'

There were over forty proficiency prompts for the Flying Leg Technique on his vision. Following this progress, in just three to five days, he could bring the Flying Leg Technique into the minor success stage.

The Flying Leg Technique primarily trains the sinews. If both his skin training and sinew training reach minor success, his strength should be a notch stronger than that of an ordinary minor success martial artist.

Fang Mushan's gaze passed over Xu Yunfan, looking at Li Haomiao on his back.
