# Chapter 89: Do You Know the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?  

The creditor had laid his schemes across the world!  

Powerful immortal sects, Buddhist temples, and even mighty dynasties were merely his chess pieces—tools to cultivate opportunities for him.  

He was the common enemy of all factions and powerhouses in the world!  

Such a figure, having lived for thousands of years without perishing, finally met his end three days ago in the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven!  

Yet, the news released by the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect and the Luofu Immortal Sect instantly shattered all their previous conjectures.  

"You were unconscious for three days, and after I received the news, I spent a day in deep thought."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed with a complex tone. "The powerhouses of the world once speculated that the creditor might not be a single person, but a group!"  

"Others also suspected that the creditor was a lineage, passed down from generation to generation."  

"Eventually, almost all factions agreed that over four thousand years, there had only been one creditor—his soul undying, his life eternal!"  

"But no one ever considered that the so-called creditor might be just like the immortal sects, Buddhist temples, and mighty dynasties… merely a fruit waiting to be harvested when ripe!"  

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing fell silent.  

Beside him, Yuan Zhengfeng, residing within the jade fragment, remained quiet, clearly disheartened.  

The atmosphere was thick with oppression and despair.  

How powerful was the creditor?  

In the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven, six Human Immortals had joined forces to kill him, yet he nearly slaughtered them all in return!  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master, renowned throughout the world, stood among the top powerhouses. After obtaining the *Dragon-Tiger Wind and Cloud Refinement to Sagehood Art*, his strength had risen to rival even the sect leaders of the three great immortal sects!  

Yet even the Ancient Moon Peak Master and five other Human Immortals were no match for him!  

Li Zhengjing had played a crucial role in this victory. Thanks to the golden page, he had foreseen events and drained the golden lava pool, cutting off the creditor's infinite source of mana. He also had the Five Elements Creation Tree shatter the divine statue the creditor had prepared, preventing his resurrection.  

Had it not been for the golden page's guidance, the battle's outcome would have been the deaths of all six Human Immortals in the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven.  

But even this overwhelmingly powerful creditor had been in a weakened state during the battle. How strong must he have been at his peak?  

And now, it seemed the creditor might have merely been a fruit waiting to be harvested?  

If so, what kind of existence could harvest *him*?  

"A True Immortal-level being?" Yuan Zhengfeng finally spoke, his voice bitter.  

"Remember what the Profound Instant Ghost King said?" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official interjected. "Twenty years ago, someone barged into the Netherworld and left unscathed, calling himself the Ancestor of the Human World. But the founding Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty referred to him as the creditor."  

"What does that mean?" Yuan Zhengfeng's tone grew even more complicated.  

"Perhaps Old Zhou misidentified the creditor. Or perhaps… he truly was another creditor." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official lowered his voice. "But his self-proclaimed title was 'Ancestor of the Human World.'"  

"You think the 'Ancestor of the Human World' who invaded the Netherworld isn't the creditor we killed three days ago?" Yuan Zhengfeng asked.  

"Clearly not," Li Zhengjing said slowly. "He might also be a creditor, but I believe… he is more likely the one behind the scenes, harvesting creditors like the one we killed!"  

The atmosphere grew heavy once more.  

The creditor's power was nearly unrivaled in the mortal world. In a one-on-one fight, even the sect leaders of the three great immortal sects would likely be no match for him. Thus, only a True Immortal-level being could harvest him.  

Twenty years ago, the "Ancestor of the Human World" had entered and left the Netherworld at will, exhausting the Profound Instant Ghost King. His power surpassed even that of a True God.  

"Living for four thousand years, his soul undying, his combat strength rivaling a True God—could he be a True Immortal who descended to the mortal world?"  

Yuan Zhengfeng paused before continuing, "Then who sees us as spare bodies—the creditor we killed three days ago, or… the one behind him?"  

At this moment, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice trembled slightly.  

The figure behind the scenes, who treated even the creditor as a chess piece, had left no trace of himself.  

Yet his mystery and power cast an invisible shadow of despair over them all!  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing did not respond immediately. He glanced quietly at the golden page.  

**Name:** Li Zhengjing!  
**Age:** Seventeen.  
**Cultivation:** True Qi Realm [108 Apertures].  
**Techniques:** *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Art, Feather Transformation Riding Dragon Celestial Immortal Art, Great Derivation Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, Sword Nurturing Art, Five Thunder Mountain-Splitting Saber, Clear Wind Shadow Body Technique, Burning Path to Benevolence Art, Truth-Seeing Fist.*  
**Surface Identity:** Inner disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Ancient Moon Peak.  
**True Identity:** Second son of Marquis Jian'an.  
**Hidden Identity:** Third spare body of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord.  
**Fate:** While cultivating the *Great Derivation Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi*, upon breaking through to the Human Immortal Realm, the sword qi's sharpness will erupt, tearing his body apart, riddling him with holes, and leaving his intestines ruptured and face unrecognizable!  
**Aftermath:** The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, enraged, will dismember him, grind his bones to dust, and leave no corpse intact!  

"The creditor is dead, but the Thousand Illusions remains."  

Li Zhengjing closed his eyes slightly, thinking, "I displayed such strength, assisting the Ancient Moon Peak Master and the others in killing the creditor, and was confirmed to possess the Eternal Verdant Saint Body… Yet even so, I'm still only the third spare body?"  

He clenched his fists, silently musing, "Before the Eternal Verdant Saint Body, are there even more suitable bodies for him?"  

In truth, before the Ancient Moon Peak Master and the others arrived, when he faced the creditor alone, he had already suspected that the creditor—who had taken the form of Elder Jing Xiao—was not the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord.  

Initially, he thought Elder Gu might be the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, having faked his death to assume Elder Jing Xiao's identity. But after questioning, he learned that the creditor had been Jing Xiao since seventeen years ago. At that point, he had a new suspicion.  

The golden page had shown that the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord had gone to the capital during a time when Elder Jing Xiao was still stationed at the Public Affairs Hall.  

The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord saw him as a spare body.  

As for the creditor, perhaps he merely regarded Li Zhengjing as fertile soil for cultivating opportunities—waiting until the fruit was ripe to harvest it!  

"This battle, including the Ancient Moon Peak Master, was merely a chess game. Behind it all, a more mysterious hand manipulated everything."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official sighed. "Even a figure as formidable as the creditor was merely a discarded piece. The Luofu Sect Master was killed by him, his opportunities harvested… And now, all the turmoil points directly at the Ancient Moon Peak Master!"  

"Senior, are you completely certain that the deaths of the Formation Pavilion Master, the severe injury and disappearance of the White Azure Venerable, and the Ancient Moon Peak Master becoming the new creditor—hunted by all factions—are all the work of that figure?" Li Zhengjing asked hoarsely.  

"I also considered whether the Ancient Moon Peak Master, to preserve his life and become the creditor, killed the Formation Pavilion Master and the White Azure Venerable."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official continued, "But if that were the case, logically, he would have come to silence all witnesses, burying you and me here to fully conceal himself in the shadows!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng agreed, "The Spiritual Official speaks wisely. The creditor's identity is the greatest secret in the world! If people knew the creditor could be killed, that his identity could be usurped… then the creditor would no longer be an invincible, mysterious figure. Instead, many would seek to replace him!"  

Li Zhengjing was silent for a moment before saying, "So… the Ancient Moon Peak Master, as his chess piece, has been placed in the open and discarded?"  

The room fell silent, as if everyone had tacitly accepted this.  

The battle three days ago seemed to have unfolded entirely under the manipulation of the figure behind the scenes.  

Looking back now, their life-and-death struggle seemed almost laughable.  

"The golden page shows that the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord once observed me with eight hundred years of experience. Does that mean he has only lived for eight hundred years yet possesses True Immortal-level power? Or… does this 'eight hundred years of experience' have another meaning?"  

"Twenty years ago, the one who invaded the Netherworld called himself the Ancestor of the Human World. He might have been another creditor—or the one harvesting creditors."  

Li Zhengjing's thoughts were in turmoil. "According to the golden page, the one who invaded the Netherworld twenty years ago was the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord! So, is this Thousand Illusions Divine Lord a creditor, or the one harvesting creditors?"  

He took a deep breath and finally looked up, meeting the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's gaze.  

"Senior, how old are you?"  

"Six hundred and eighty-nine." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official replied, "For a Human Immortal, I'm still relatively young…"  

"Six hundred and eighty-nine."  

Li Zhengjing repeated the number silently. The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord was about a century older, but among cultivators, they could be considered contemporaries.  

He took another deep breath and glanced at the golden page, confirming that mentioning this name wouldn't alter his fate. Then, with a solemn tone, he asked:  

"Senior, do you know of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?"  

"..."  

The atmosphere froze again. After a long pause, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official shook his head slightly, looking somewhat puzzled. "I've never heard of him."  

"What significance does this name hold?" Yuan Zhengfeng couldn't help but ask.  

"I suspect he might be the Ancestor of the Human World," Li Zhengjing said.  

"..." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official was silent for a while before replying, "Where did you hear this name? I truly have never heard of any Human Immortal using the title 'Thousand Illusions Divine Lord'..."  

"Neither have I," Yuan Zhengfeng added.  

"..." Li Zhengjing fell silent once more.  

"Perhaps I can search for this name in the records of the Salvation Golden Ship."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said, "The Salvation Golden Ship is a melting pot of cultivators from all backgrounds, including many from high-ranking factions… Moreover, the ship was founded thirteen hundred years ago. To successfully build this vessel capable of crossing realms, countless ancient texts have been collected."  

Li Zhengjing nodded slightly, then looked up. "Senior, are you returning to the Salvation Golden Ship?"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official nodded. "Just yesterday, the ship's brand activated. I must board it. Previously, I could suppress it with the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's *Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed*, but the Ancient Moon Peak Master—who welcomed me into the sect—has fallen to such a state. I fear I may be implicated as well."  

He continued, "Don't worry. Even though I caused the deaths of three helmsmen of the Salvation Golden Ship, the truth about killing the creditor will be enough to persuade the current Salvation Golden Ship's *Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation Celestial Venerable* to spare me. Because… he has long suspected that the founding *Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation Celestial Venerable* was also someone the 'creditor' planted an opportunity in..."  

Yuan Zhengfeng said, "You mean the current Salvation Golden Ship, like the three great immortal sects, is a chess piece of the creditor, cultivating opportunities for him and at risk of being harvested?"  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official didn't deny it. "The creditor's schemes span the world. The Salvation Golden Ship is no exception. But now it seems… the one who manipulated both us and the creditor is the true creditor behind the scenes!"  

He looked at Li Zhengjing apologetically. "I can't protect you now that I'm struggling to protect myself. Since you're awake, I should leave… But there are two more matters."  

"What matters?"  

"The creditor's corpse and this jade fragment."  

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official produced the jade fragment.  

It was made of the same material as the one Yuan Zhengfeng resided in—both fragments of the Netherworld Sovereign's remains.  

The one in his hand was the fragment Elder Gu had used to fake his death.  

He looked at Li Zhengjing, his gaze shifting to the jade fragment housing Yuan Zhengfeng. "Over the past two or three days, I've studied both the creditor's corpse and this jade fragment extensively. I think I've found a clue… The next time we meet, I may uncover its secrets—perhaps earth-shattering ones!"  

He put away the jade fragment. "The creditor died here, so the eyes of the one behind the scenes must also be on this place. It's not safe to stay. Leave as soon as possible."  

With that, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official spread his wings.  

After three days, the wings had grown fine feathers, no longer bare.  

He took flight, heading south, leaving behind a final message.  

"The one behind the scenes is unfathomable. You are also one of his chess pieces, destined for a difficult path."  

"With the Ancient Moon Peak Master in dire straits, you can't clear your name and must not return to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect for now. Take care."  

"Once I've settled on the Salvation Golden Ship, I'll send you a boarding token. If you ever find yourself with no way out, boarding the ship might be an option."  

With that, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official departed, leaving the shattered Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven in silence.  

Li Zhengjing slowly stood up and sighed. "I never planned to return to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect anyway."  

The waters of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect ran too deep.  

Especially now that he had confirmed the creditor and the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord were not the same person… yet both had hidden within the sect.  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master had once said he trusted only a handful of people, which was why only Elder Gu, the White Azure Venerable, and the Formation Pavilion Master—all from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect—had joined the battle against the creditor.  

So, what about the other high-ranking elders of the sect, or even the sect leader himself? Had the Ancient Moon Peak Master suspected any of them of being the "creditor"?  

Now it was clear that none of the untrusted elders had been the creditor. But if they weren't the creditor… could they have been the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master had seemingly never anticipated the existence of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord. Thus, after the creditor's death, he had let his guard down, never expecting an even more terrifying figure within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect—leading to his current fate!  

"Let's go!"  

Li Zhengjing stood up and opened the phoenix tree wooden box, eyeing the high-grade spirit stones the creditor had prepared with satisfaction.  

These spirit stones had been intended for the creditor to recover his mana after taking over the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone. There were quite a few—about a thousand!  

He stored the wooden box, then took the jade fragment housing Yuan Zhengfeng.  

Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly spoke. "Even if you leave the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, you can't escape the fate of being a spare body..."  

"I know. But I can't just sit and wait for death, can I?"  

Li Zhengjing chuckled, focusing his mind on the golden page.  

For now, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord was a mystery, his power overwhelming to the point of despair… But as long as he had this page to alter fate, there was still hope!  

He slung the wooden box over his back, picked up the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, then paused.  

"Did I forget something? Hmm… where's the little tree?"  

"The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official buried it in the soil beneath you to gather Yin-Yang and Five Elements energy, keeping your soul from scattering."  

"No wonder… I wondered why the tree was missing but you were still awake."  

Li Zhengjing quickly dug up the Five Elements Creation Tree, but it lay motionless, as if dead. He blinked. "What's wrong with it?"  

Yuan Zhengfeng explained, "On your orders, it carried the wooden box underground, destroying the creditor's backup plans. But when it returned, it was dazed and unresponsive… The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official thought it had been affected by the residual energy from the battle. It should wake up in a few days."  

"I see!"  

Li Zhengjing suddenly understood. "No need to wait days. I'll wake it up now..."  

With that, he grabbed the Five Elements Creation Tree and punched it seventeen or eighteen times.  

"Master, spare me!"  

The tree instantly came to life, its branches flailing as it screamed.  

"Good enough!"  

Li Zhengjing grinned, then took out the Wave-Severing Gu, poisoning himself once before placing the listless insect back into the wooden box.  

But just as he was about to store the Five Elements Creation Tree inside, the tree waved its branches and shouted:  

"Master, there's something strange underground!"  

"What kind of strange?"  

"I did as you ordered, destroying things underground. But then I broke a round stone, and there was a person inside! I hit him, and he started crying..."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree shuddered. "He only cried once, and I lost all strength. I was dazed and barely made it out with Little Wave-Severing's help..."  

Yuan Zhengfeng gasped. "You weren't affected by the battle's aftermath?"  

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "A person inside a stone? Was it a monkey?"  

He glanced southward. "The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official left too soon. Otherwise, he'd never have left without dissecting that stone person!"  

After checking the golden page to confirm no ill omens, he waved his hand. "Lead the way!"
