# Chapter 13: Foreign Object

After completing his cultivation session, Zhou Qing lay on his bed, carefully sensing the faint warmth within him. Today, the heat was noticeably more pronounced than usual.

The courtyard was quiet. He silently counted his heartbeats and focused on his breathing.

"My heartbeat has slowed, and my breathing has deepened."

Zhou Qing understood that the effects of advancing his Tiger Form to the proficient level were gradually manifesting. The strengthening of his heart function meant improved blood circulation, which would make him increasingly robust as he continued practicing the Tiger Form.

Both his "Black Tiger Plucks the Heart" technique and his "Flicking Finger Divine Skill" would benefit from this.

"Although my physique has improved, I'm still far from being 'healthy.'"

The essence of the Tiger Form was to enhance his constitution, and through practicing the complete Five Animal Frolics, he could gradually replenish the deficiencies in his original body.

However, Zhou Qing, being well-read, knew one thing for certain: physical constitution and health were not absolutely correlated.

Lifespan depended on many factors.

His current increase in lifespan was more of a restoration than an actual extension. Once his body's deficiencies were fully replenished, further extending his lifespan would undoubtedly become much more difficult.

But that was a concern for the future.

The benefits of an enhanced physique were obvious—it allowed for a higher quality of life.

That night, he slept soundly, free of dreams.

As Zhou Qing practiced more diligently, the lingering gloom in the courtyard gradually faded, though the increasing summer heat made the change difficult to notice.

The next morning, before dawn, Zhou Qing awoke.

He felt no fatigue, only an indescribable freshness.

After lighting the fire and preparing breakfast, the sky began to brighten. As he washed up, he caught his reflection in the wooden basin's water and noticed his complexion had improved further.

While eating, passages from the classics flowed through his mind.

"Every grain of rice, every sip of porridge—remember how hard it was to obtain. Every thread, every strand—cherish the labor behind them."

Cherish the present, cherish the life before him.

Each day would be better than the last.

Reading nourished the spirit; martial arts strengthened the body. Zhou Qing wasn't entirely sure how much benefit reading brought him, but he knew that steady accumulation would eventually yield results.

Teaching at the village school and reviewing the classics in his spare time enriched his spirit.

His increased focus during martial arts practice was likely connected to this.

Essence, energy, and spirit were the three treasures.

Martial arts cultivated essence; reading nurtured spirit. As for cultivating energy, Zhou Qing had some ideas—it lay in the Monkey Form of the Five Animal Frolics.

He was in no hurry. He would take it step by step.

After packing up, the sky was still early. Zhou Qing slung his book satchel over his shoulder and set out for a brisk walk.

The west gate had just opened, and the guards, already familiar with him, greeted him respectfully as a scholar.

Once outside the city, Zhou Qing jogged leisurely toward Hu Village. The morning air wasn't the freshest of the day, but after a good night's sleep and mental nourishment from reading, the countryside path felt invigorating.

With his spirit refreshed, he could appreciate every detail of his surroundings—the morning dew, the fragrance of grass and trees near and far.

Summer was the most vibrant season of the year, a symbol of vitality.

Zhou Qing could feel his own vitality steadily increasing.

After a night of settling, the impurities in the air had dissipated, making his breathing feel clear and unobstructed. During the day, the dust on the road would be much worse.

Near Hu Village was a nameless little lake, its waters clear and pristine. At this time of year, lush aquatic plants grew there, and egrets often played on its surface. Seeing that it was still early for class, Zhou Qing stopped by the lake to rest.

The egrets, startled by his approach, flapped their wings and flew away.

Zhou Qing chuckled and shook his head.

Setting down his book satchel, he felt lighter. In the distance, a rooster's crow echoed from Hu Village, and cooking smoke rose from the households as firewood burned, carrying the scent of rural life.

This was the idyllic side of village living.

But in reality, living here was far less convenient than in the city, especially with the summer mosquitoes.

Oddly enough, Zhou Qing's residence was almost entirely free of insects.

He warmed up with the Five Animal Frolics by the lake, then practiced the Tiger Form. As the sun rose, ripples spread across the water, fish surfaced to blow bubbles, and the fleeing egrets watched the unfamiliar human from afar, torn between fear and curiosity.

Zhou Qing immersed himself in his practice, oblivious to his surroundings.

By the time the sun was high, he finally concluded his session.

Training brought him joy.

Reluctantly, he stopped, regulated his breathing, and then shouldered his book satchel before heading to the village school to begin the day's lessons.

In the afternoon, the blacksmith Hu, whom he hadn't seen in days, paid a visit.

Hu had resigned from his position as the village's martial arts instructor, leaving the students without their usual afternoon playtime. But as summer deepened, outdoor activities were less suitable anyway.

Zhou Qing noticed that Hu's limp had improved slightly, likely due to the ancient script he had deciphered and the herbs Hu had gathered from the mountains.

Grateful, Hu had come to thank Zhou Qing, bringing with him a magnificent rooster, robust and spirited.

"Master Zhou, I heard your new residence carries some negative energy. This rooster was caught in the mountains—quite wild, but I've tamed it. Keeping it in your courtyard will ward off ordinary evil spirits. If you don't like it, you can always eat it," Hu said, showing Zhou Qing the rooster before stuffing it back into a sack.

Zhou Qing expressed his thanks and took the opportunity to make a request: he asked Hu to craft a wooden dummy wrapped in iron at vital points, along with some sandbag weights for his legs.

Hu readily agreed.

Returning home, Zhou Qing released the rooster in the courtyard. The bird was full of vitality, its gaze sharp. Since Zhou Qing also had the Solomon's Seal gifted by Miss Lin for nourishment, he decided not to eat the rooster—at least for now—as long as it didn't cause trouble.

The rooster, however, seemed restless in its new environment.

Zhou Qing pondered and decided to spare its life.

He practiced the Tiger Form, emitting a low growl, and the rooster immediately became more subdued, though not entirely cowed.

"Interesting, but not enough to impress," Zhou Qing mused.

After experiencing Zhou Qing's tiger-like aura, the rooster grew docile.

Recalling folk tales about roosters warding off evil spirits, and given Hu's advice, Zhou Qing decided keeping the bird added an extra layer of protection.

But he noticed something odd—the rooster explored every corner of the courtyard except near the large mulberry tree.

This piqued Zhou Qing's curiosity.

"I've been practicing under that tree for a while now without issue. If there's a problem, it hasn't affected me."

Still, he couldn't help but connect the eerie breeze he'd felt earlier to the tree.

But the tree stood over fifty feet tall, its trunk so thick it would take several people to encircle it. Cutting it down wasn't an option, especially since he was only renting the property. Even if he wanted to, the Lin family might not allow it.

Such an ancient mulberry tree was rare.

Butcher Hu had even claimed the tree carried auspicious energy, capable of producing noblemen and ensuring Zhou Qing's success in the imperial exams. For now, Zhou Qing chose to believe it.

After all, keeping the tree posed no harm, and he even used it as a target for his Flicking Finger Divine Skill.

Three days passed, and after the initial surge of benefits from mastering the Tiger Form, Zhou Qing noticed his progress slowing.

Of course, compared to before his breakthrough, he was still advancing faster.

But Zhou Qing wanted even greater speed.

"Martial arts are seventy percent diet, thirty percent training. Right now, though I have ample meat, it's not enough to significantly accelerate my Tiger Form progress."

"It's about time I used the Solomon's Seal Miss Lin gave me."

Zhou Qing decided to consume the Solomon's Seal to boost his physique.

Not raw, of course.

He stewed it into a nourishing meat broth. When the pot boiled, the aroma of meat and herbs filled the air.

He served himself several bowls, then gave the scraps and bones to the rooster.

The bird wasn't picky—it devoured even the bone fragments.

As Zhou Qing fed the rooster, he digested the nourishing broth.

Since his transmigration, he had lived alone.

Now, with a rooster in his home, he felt a peculiar sense of companionship.

In his previous life, the internet had alleviated loneliness. But here, in this secluded western courtyard, solitude was palpable. Without his teaching duties in Hu Village, he would have been even more isolated.

Even now, he sometimes felt lonely.

It was only human.

Zhou Qing didn't rush to seek companionship because of it. Keeping the rooster was pleasant enough.

For now, he needed to focus on strengthening himself. Relying solely on dwindling resources wasn't sustainable—he needed new income streams.

All in due time.

He had been taking the Five Fragrance Pills for several days.

Perhaps because his martial training accelerated his blood circulation, today, after practice, though he still sweated as usual, the odor was noticeably milder, carrying a faint herbal fragrance.

So far, the pills seemed harmless.

If others took them long-term, would they also develop this subtle herbal scent?

Given the era's hygiene standards, even a modestly effective product like this would have a promising market.

After all, even Miss Lin probably didn't bathe daily.

As he enjoyed the Solomon's Seal broth, Zhou Qing thought of its donor, Miss Lin.

She was a forthright woman.

Coming from a merchant family, her demeanor differed from that of typical noble ladies—though Zhou Qing had never met one to compare.

Well-fed and comfortable, the mind turns to romance.

It was natural for a man to think of women when idle.

Zhou Qing saw no issue with this. Desire wasn't inherently bad—what mattered was control, not becoming its slave.

Often, desire was a driving force.

Longevity could be considered the ultimate desire. With it came infinite possibilities to experience all the beauty life had to offer.

Now that Zhou Qing had a chance at immortality, he would seize it.

Once the broth settled, he resumed practicing the Five Animal Frolics.

This session was remarkably effective, even surpassing the initial boost from mastering the Tiger Form.

At this rate, his Five Animal Frolics might reach the beginner level within a month or two.

This highlighted another feature of the practice.

Although his Tiger Form was already proficient, the other four forms lagged behind—the Deer Form was somewhat understood, while the Monkey, Bear, and Bird Forms remained rudimentary.

The difference was minor.

Rudimentary meant grasping the basic movements.

Some understanding implied slight insights into power application, but not much.

The Tiger Form's advancement had limited impact on the overall evaluation.

The more Zhou Qing practiced, the more he realized the Five Animal Frolics were interconnected, with each form building upon the last in difficulty.

His rapid progress with the Tiger Form was partly because hands were the body's most agile parts, followed by legs.

Hence, the Deer Form came next.

The remaining three forms would naturally progress more slowly.

When Zhou Qing executed "Black Tiger Plucks the Heart," a crisp sound accompanied the motion.

His mastery of the technique's power delivery was nearing proficiency. Smooth, natural movements would allow him to perform closer to his training level in real combat.

The crisp sound resulted from seamless power flow.

As his physique improved, the technique's potency would rise.

But as a mere mortal, his current striking power was limited. A year of fist training paled against a few days with a blade.

An ordinary man with a crossbow could be deadly.

Hence, crossbows and armor were banned among civilians. Even wealthy families caught with such contraband faced severe penalties.

As a transmigrator, Zhou Qing felt an underlying unease.

He constantly sought to strengthen himself for security.

Scholarly titles offered external protection, but not everyone respected their authority.

Well-versed in history, Zhou Qing recognized that the Great Zhou Dynasty had passed its zenith.

Natural disasters aside, trade routes to Jiangzhou City grew more perilous each year.

Even Hu Village felt the tightening grip of taxes and corvée labor, with officials increasingly exploiting the rural populace.

Poverty bred banditry.

Butcher Hu had mentioned village heads who by day governed and by night led their men in robbery and arson.

Some even formed sworn brotherhoods with county militia captains, becoming so entrenched that magistrates dared not cross them, instead relying on them to maintain order.

In such times, Zhou Qing needed scholarly achievements as a shield but also a fallback. His martial training was partly for survival in turbulent times.

For three days, Zhou Qing dined on Solomon's Seal stew, savoring every bite.

The rooster, fed on herb dregs and meat scraps, grew more vibrant but also tamer toward its provider.

One morning, Zhou Qing awoke to find the rooster had brought him a dead snake.

The snake was two feet long, its scales a striking bluish-green—unusual by any measure.
