# Chapter 382: Because They Haven't Watched "Weiqi Youth" (1/2)

The moon hung high in the sky, its light and the radiance of the stars illuminating the Go board and the stone-mill-sized stones upon it.

Surrounding the board were the skeletal remains of Go masters, yet there was no eerie atmosphere; instead, it felt as imposing as mountains standing tall in deep waters.

These skeletons belonged to those who were at least at the External Scene Realm in their lifetime; otherwise, they would have long since turned to dust. Being watched by them created an invisible, solemn, and dignified atmosphere.

The scene was silent. The Demon Summoning Sect disciples all held their breath, looking at Li Mo, who stood with his hands behind his back.

Li Mo stood before the board, seemingly waiting for something. In reality, he was thinking about what special effects he should add to the game later to make it look more like a match between great powers. He was also waiting for the Ice Cube to comprehend the board.

"Can Brother Heitu break this board?"

Luo Yexian broke into a cold sweat. He had just glanced at the board below and felt as if the sky and earth were spinning and his soul was shaking, so he quickly averted his gaze.

"Let's hope so."

Tan Zhuyin did not look at the board at all. As long as one didn't play, they would be sent out after a while. The trouble was for those with high Go skills who were still not enough to break the board.

He had promised to thank the other party with the power of all living beings, but that would be after the deed was done. In any case, there was no loss.

"Weiqi Youth, determined to move forward, discussing the Way on the board, Qi flows with the heavens and earth~~"
"Experience~ Experience~"

"Who's singing? We're playing Go, don't you know to be serious?!"

Luo Yexian frowned, scanning the group of Demon Summoning Sect priests.

The Demon Cultists looked at each other, but since they were all wearing hoods and hiding their faces, it was impossible to tell who was singing.

"My apologies, this scene... I couldn't help myself..."

Li Mo coughed lightly.

He was singing in his heart, wasn't he? He accidentally sang it out loud.

"Good, very good singing! As expected of Brother Heitu, a single song captures the danger and mystery of the board!"

Luo Yexian started a round of applause.

As he applauded, the other Demon Summoning Sect disciples followed. They hadn't even started playing, yet it was as if they had already won. They had already overwhelmed the other side in terms of momentum!

Although they didn't know who that "other side" was...

Tan Zhuyin: "....."

Li Mo: "......"

Old Luo, this guy, is just too eager to make progress. Why join the Demon Summoning Sect? He should have gone to the imperial examinations and become an official.

"Ice Cube, are you ready?"

"Mm, go ahead."

Receiving the Ice Cube's affirmative response, Li Mo stepped onto the stone platform in front of the giant board, looking down.

He naturally had a calm and composed expression, after all, he didn't understand Go at all. The strong skeletons watched him, and Li Mo also exuded powerful confidence.

After all!

Standing behind him now was the Empress Ice Cube!

He grasped the Mirage God Pearl!

*Step—*

A footstep sounded. On the opposite stone platform, an old man walked up the steps, carrying an immortal, Daoist aura.

"Could this be... a Go Spirit?"

Luo Yexian muttered.

Tan Zhuyin frowned solemnly: "The records in the sect never mentioned the existence of a Go Spirit here..."

Looking at the unfamiliar 'Go Spirit old man,' the two exchanged a glance and thought the same thing.

Could it be that the Go Spirit has always been there, but no one's Go skills were high enough to attract the board's attention? Only when Heitu Xianjun arrived did the Go Spirit have to appear?

Hmm, it's normal for it to be unfamiliar.

After all, they haven't watched "Weiqi Youth"...

If there really were a Go Spirit, it would be baffled. It hadn't even made its entrance yet! Who is that old man?!

"Please."

The old man cupped his hands in a salute and took the black stones.

"Please."

Li Mo nodded lightly and took the white stones.

White versus Black, with a ten-point disadvantage.

Qinghe County.

Ying Bing, through the Divine Intent of the Great Yin, had a clear view of the board.

---

In front of her was a Go board, its situation identical to the one a thousand miles away.

"Li Mo, just place the stones as I say, and don't make any mistakes."

This board was filled with interconnected traps. Those with decent Go skills would usually think that to turn the situation around, they need to save the white stones in the lower left.

But the more you try to save them, the more you get dragged into the quagmire, leading to a total loss. This ten-point gap needs to be recovered from the battle in the center of the board...

"Column 9, Row 13, Jump."

Li Mo spoke at the same time.

*Clack—*

A point of starlight suddenly shone onto the board, making that grid glow white, and a pillar of light shot up into the sky!

It almost blinded the Demon Cultists.

The white-robed old man said nothing and placed a stone in response. A black streak of light also shot up into the sky!

Well, actually, the stones on the board were moving on their own.

"The stones in the lower left can be used as a decoy."
"What we need to do is to connect the center when the opponent takes the bait."
"Column 10, Row 3."

A clear and calm voice gave the answer to breaking the board, a move that no Go player would ever make. This move abandoned the stones in the lower left, which seemed to have a chance for survival!

*Creak, creak—*

The skeletons sitting around the giant board slowly stood up, and a hint of emotional fluctuation could be felt from them.

"What do these skeletons mean?"
"They seem to be... confused?"

Tan Zhuyin didn't dare to focus his mind on the board, so he could only judge the situation by the expressions of the Go masters' remains.

"In other words, they can't understand Brother Heitu's move?"

Luo Yexian didn't know what to say.

If the Go masters couldn't understand it, then obviously in their view, it wasn't a good move. But from another angle, if they could understand it, they wouldn't have died here...

So, was it a good move or not?

*Clack—*
*Clack—*

Starlight fell one by one, illuminating the board and projecting onto the night sky.

The Ice Cube was seriously playing the game, so naturally, Little Li wasn't idle either!

*Whoosh—*

Clouds and mist churned. A pure white fish-dragon broke through the mist, as if formed from the clearest vital energy between heaven and earth, spiraling in the air.

Opposite it was a black fish-dragon, churning with turbid energy, charging straight towards the heavens. The two entangled and fought, sometimes separating, sometimes intertwining, sometimes dancing harmoniously, and sometimes fighting endlessly.

The Dance of the Black and White Fish-Dragons!

"There's no sign of an External Scene manifestation."

Tan Zhuyin muttered to himself. This was something a Dharma King had told him.

This meant that the dance and battle of the black and white fish-dragons in the sky was not some kind of domain or an External Scene manifestation!

"Could it be that the game on the board has already caused a reaction from the heavens?"

"Unheard of, simply unheard of!"
"I heard that the former Sword God of Tianshan Sword Manor, when he danced his sword without using a trace of Yuan Qi, could clear the clouds and rain, filling the world with pure energy, reaching the level where technique approaches the Dao."
"Could it be that if one's Go skills transcend the mundane and enter the sage realm, it can be like this too?"
"Yes, the elder from the Hall of Yin and Yang didn't cause a heavenly response, so it's no wonder he couldn't break the board in the end."

Listening to the discussions among the sect members, Luo Yexian smiled slightly.

It seemed that the difference between that elder and Brother Heitu was not just a little bit.

"Watching cartoons wasn't in vain."

The Immortal Li, holding the Mirage God Pearl, couldn't help but sigh. When he was a child, his family wouldn't let him watch cartoons, saying it was a waste of time and would ruin his ambition. Look how useful it is now!

"Ice Cube, how much longer until you win?"

Li Mo wanted to make a big move at the end.

The Divine Intent of the Great Yin was silent for a moment before the Ice Cube's voice came through:

"At this speed of placing stones, about a quarter of an hour."
