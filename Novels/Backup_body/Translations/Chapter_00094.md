# Chapter 94: The Divine Mother's Slip of Tongue! The Imperial Preceptor Silences the Witness!

The heavens trembled with divine might as flames soared and sword intent swept across the sky. A golden dragon materialized, its power overwhelming.

Fearing the collateral damage from the battle, the Buddhist disciple from the Vajra Temple dared not delay. Using his kasaya as a flying vessel, he circled the area, burying all his Buddhist treasures in the ground. Within moments, a three-hundred-mile radius was enveloped in a barrier of Buddhist light, shielding the populace.

Only then did the Vajra Temple disciple breathe a sigh of relief and ascend to join the battle. Though considered part of the younger generation, he had lingered at this cultivation stage for years, just half a step away from achieving a golden body. Renowned as the most promising candidate to attain Arhat status in the world, armed with numerous Buddhist treasures, he faced the battle without fear. Yet his eyes betrayed astonishment—he had not expected the rare treasure in Gu Changzhou’s possession to be the Dragon Pillar, unique to the Great Zhou imperial family.

But now was not the time for questions. Riding his kasaya, he soared into the clouds to join the fray.

"Even the Buddhist disciple wishes to fight?" The Divine Mother of the Southern Region grew even more enraged. With a sweep of her hand, countless divine lights suppressed the surroundings. Gripping a spear, she lashed out at the Vajra Temple disciple.

"Since the Divine Mother refuses to show mercy and seeks to unleash divine punishment upon these lands, this humble monk has no choice but to join forces with them to repel you!" The disciple clasped his hands together, and his prayer beads flew out, interconnecting with radiant light to form a net that descended upon her.

Meanwhile, Gu Changzhou retreated a few steps, his face pale as he channeled his qi to command the golden dragon, which coiled and roared, charging straight at the Divine Mother.

With their assistance, Li Zhengjing found the battle easier. His mana transformed into sword energy that filled the sky, while his blade slashed through thunderbolts. The Divine Fire Sword in his left arm lay in wait, ready to strike a decisive blow when the opportunity arose.

"Good! Good! Good!" The Divine Mother’s fury knew no bounds.

Once known as the Heavenly Sovereign King, she had been among the upper echelons of human immortals in her lifetime. After death, she had taken possession of a divine body, becoming the Divine Mother of the Southern Region. Though her power was lesser than in life, eight hundred years of absorbing mortal worship had inflated her arrogance, making her look down upon all living beings.

Now, three juniors were suppressing her, igniting her wrath. Gu Changzhou’s use of the Dragon Pillar—exclusive to the Great Zhou imperial family—convinced her that this was a plot by the imperial court. They had lured her to Lin Yuan Prefecture, where she lacked worship, weakening her power to set a trap.

Recalling her past achievements and now facing betrayal by the Great Zhou, her hatred surged to its peak.

"You think the lack of temples in Lin Yuan Prefecture can weaken me?" With a thought, golden light converged from hundreds of miles away—the power of mortal worship, carrying their desires and thoughts. In an instant, a golden radiance enveloped her divine form.

Her Divine Golden Body grew even stronger. Divine light erupted, repelling the golden dragon and forcing the Vajra Temple disciple back. She turned her full might upon Li Zhengjing, the strongest of the three.

"I’ll annihilate you first, you insolent fool!"

In a flash, she was upon him. Li Zhengjing raised his blade, unleashing the Divine Fire Sword from his left arm.

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice echoed in his ear, "Eight hundred years of worship have not only prolonged her divine soul’s lifespan but also strengthened her Divine Golden Body. Do not face her head-on—retreat and wait for the others to regroup!"

But Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden book’s fortune-telling page, which remained calm. He charged forward without hesitation.

Just then, a radiant wheel appeared before the Divine Mother, freezing the world in place. Li Zhengjing’s blade slowed to a crawl. The Vajra Temple disciple struggled to lift his demon-subduing pestle, his movements a hundred times slower. Gu Changzhou, his qi disrupted, could no longer control the Dragon Pillar, causing the golden dragon to flicker.

"With my Heavenly Sovereign Wheel, refined into the Divine Worship Golden Wheel, how could you juniors possibly resist?" The Divine Mother reached out, gathering wind and clouds to seize Li Zhengjing.

But in that instant, her movements also slowed to a standstill.

All eyes turned to the little girl beside her—a child no older than five, with delicate features and tiny deer antlers on her head. She reached out with tiny hands and plucked the Divine Worship Golden Wheel from the air.

The onlookers held their breath in disbelief.

The dragon girl cradled the wheel like a pancake and took a bite. Her eyes curved into crescents as she smiled and took another bite.

**Boom!**

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing struck the stunned Divine Mother, blasting her back with the Divine Fire Sword, followed by five thunderous slashes. A hundred Great Void Sword Qi pierced her divine form, riddling it with holes.

Gu Changzhou, a true disciple of the Luofu Immortal Sect, reacted swiftly. He summoned the golden dragon to coil around the Divine Mother, trapping her. The Vajra Temple disciple gathered his scattered prayer beads and treasures, encasing both the dragon and the Divine Mother within a barrier.

Li Zhengjing panted, feeling his mana drain. Before Yuan Zhengfeng could protest, he swallowed a dozen spirit stones, silencing him. Then he turned to the dragon girl, torn between shock and irritation.

"Why do you put everything in your mouth? Who knows if this thing is clean? Next time, wash it or roast it first, or you’ll get sick!" He marched forward, only for Yuan Zhengfeng to chime in.

"Not enough spirit energy. Eat a few more stones, Zhengjing."

"..."

Li Zhengjing demonstrated, washing and roasting a spirit stone before swallowing it.

The dragon girl muttered in an ancient tongue, but her meaning was clear. "You just swallowed yours raw."

"That’s different!"

"How?" She hugged the golden wheel and took another bite. "Tastes good."

"You mean it’s delicious?" Li Zhengjing’s interest was piqued. If she could eat it, so could he. The wheel was likely condensed from worship energy, rich in divine power and spirit energy—pure once refined by the golden book. 

"Mine!" She turned away, clutching the wheel.

"Stingy!" Li Zhengjing huffed and turned to the trapped Divine Mother.

The Vajra Temple disciple and Gu Changzhou exchanged bewildered glances at the little girl but said nothing. Li Zhengjing didn’t explain—he himself didn’t know how she had effortlessly taken the Divine Worship Golden Wheel. But given her extraordinary origins, he wasn’t overly surprised.

"If not for her..." The Buddhist disciple glanced at the girl. "The Divine Mother’s power was immense. Even with your human immortal strength, Brother Gu’s treasure, and my Buddhist artifacts, we’d have been hard-pressed to defeat her."

"Regardless, I admit defeat today." Within the barrier, the golden dragon coiled around the Divine Mother, whose Divine Golden Body crumbled, revealing the Celestial Stone beneath.

"I thought the three of you alone couldn’t defeat me. But I never imagined the Great Zhou court had such a figure who could easily counter my Divine Worship Golden Wheel. Since when did they have such power?"

Her voice was laced with bitterness. The three men exchanged glances, their attention shifting to the golden dragon.

"The Dragon Pillar is unique to the Great Zhou imperial family." The Buddhist disciple eyed Gu Changzhou. "The Divine Mother seems convinced this was the court’s doing. Care to explain?"

Li Zhengjing remained calm but scrutinized Gu Changzhou. Even the Buddhist disciple, who had ties to him, now suspected the imperial court’s involvement. After all, the Dragon Pillar and its activation method were royal secrets.

"Were Brother Buddhist Disciple and I just pawns in this game?" Li Zhengjing asked coolly.

Gu Changzhou stared at the golden pillar in his hand, about to speak, when the Divine Mother interjected.

"My defeat is certain today, but one thing puzzles me." Her voice was heavy. "For over a thousand years, I’ve roamed the world. From aiding the founding emperor to establishing the Great Zhou, my contributions were undeniable. I died protecting him, forced to become the Divine Mother of the Southern Region. For eight hundred years, I’ve guarded this land faithfully, never neglecting my duties!"

Her voice trembled with indignation. "All these years, I’ve kept every secret, never uttering a word. Now, with only a century left to live, why won’t the court let me die in peace?"

Silence fell. Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. *Secrets? Does she think the imperial court is silencing her?*

The Buddhist disciple whispered, "The Heavenly Sovereign King’s death was suspicious. He was only five hundred—in his prime—when he died."

"A year before his death, the capital was shaken by a great upheaval," Gu Changzhou added quietly. "The western palace collapsed, killing countless. The founding emperor issued a penitent decree and died a hundred years later on the same day, grief-stricken."

"Tens of thousands perished in that upheaval, including nobles and founding heroes," the Buddhist disciple said. "More importantly, since then, no Great Zhou emperor has achieved human immortality."

"The emperor’s limited lifespan ensures the throne changes hands every century—a boon for sects and temples," Gu Changzhou mused. "But the Divine Mother claimed she died protecting the founding emperor. Does she believe she’s being silenced for that?"

"Seems there’s more to this," Li Zhengjing said, rubbing his chin. "Now that she’s trapped, how do we get her to talk?"

He thought of the Hanging Bird, which had effortlessly extracted secrets from the Netherworld Ghost King. But when he checked the phoenix wood box, he found the bird despondent over its grandfather’s peril.

Sighing, Li Zhengjing turned as the Buddhist disciple stepped forward.

"Monks do not lie." He spoke calmly. "Ask yourself—have you truly never revealed a single word?"

The Divine Mother paused. "For eight hundred years, I’ve kept silent. If the court seeks to silence me now, is it because I witnessed the crown prince raising venomous insects to poison himself?"

The air grew heavier. The three men exchanged shocked glances.

"Or because the mortal worship muddled my mind, and I drunkenly exposed the current emperor’s slaughter of refugees from the Northern Region to prolong his life?"

"Or because the founding emperor seduced the previous dynasty’s goddess to steal divine artifacts, sparking his rebellion when exposed?"

"Or because, after rallying under the banner of restoring the previous dynasty for the people, he ordered me to exterminate all royal descendants?"

"These are ancient matters. Even if I’ve occasionally misspoken lately under the influence of mortal thoughts, do I deserve death?"

"I have only a century left. Why can’t I die in peace?"

Her voice trembled with resentment.

A heavy silence followed before they realized something and turned to the dragon girl. She innocently nibbled the Divine Worship Golden Wheel like a pancake. With each bite, the Divine Mother’s mind grew more disordered, spilling secrets.

"Good girl! Keep eating!" Li Zhengjing encouraged her before turning to the trapped Divine Mother.

Her consciousness unraveled further. "I know what the court fears most—the founding emperor’s order eight hundred years ago to massacre the western city’s populace to build the Blood God Formation and repel a great enemy."

"But I’ve never spoken of this before."

"Also, I—"

Her voice cut off abruptly. The worship energy around her surged violently, divine power leaking from the Celestial Stone’s orifices.

"Damn it!" The Buddhist disciple rushed to seal the leaks.

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice rang in Li Zhengjing’s ear. "She’s truly being silenced—this is the imperial court’s doing!"

Li Zhengjing activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique to suppress the divine power, but within moments, the Divine Mother’s energy was entirely drained. Within the barrier, only an empty shell remained.

The Divine Mother of the Southern Region—no, the Heavenly Sovereign King—was no more.

"What happened?" Gu Changzhou asked, bewildered.

The Buddhist disciple’s expression was grave. "She mentioned the massacre eight hundred years ago. She must have sworn a heavenly oath never to speak of it. The girl eating her Divine Worship Golden Wheel disrupted her mind, making her blurt it out."

"This wasn’t an oath backlash," Li Zhengjing said. "Your temples also gather worship energy. You’d know better."

"This was the court’s worship energy," the disciple explained. "As a state-recognized deity, she absorbed the people’s offerings. During festivals, the court and people’s prayers generate vast worship energy tied to the nation’s fortune—state deities like her are entitled to it."

"But accepting the court’s worship means being bound by it," Gu Changzhou added. "When she revealed the secret, the oath activated. The court silenced her."

"Likely the Imperial Preceptor’s doing," the Buddhist disciple said. "He holds the authority to command the worship energy and control the state’s deities."

Silence fell once more. The Divine Mother’s final words implicated the founding emperor in a horrific crime—sacrificing tens of thousands to repel a great enemy.

"The founding emperor’s power rivaled the three great immortal sects’ leaders. After establishing the dynasty, he commanded the nation’s fortune, subduing all sects. Even the three great immortal sects submitted, allowing local officials—though chosen by the sects—to be appointed by the court."

"With such power and human immortals at his command, why resort to a demonic formation to fend off an enemy?"

"Who could that enemy be?"

The answer hung in the air.

Days ago, the Luofu Immortal Sect had been devastated—its leader slain, half its elders dead.

Eight hundred years ago, the capital’s upheaval.

Only one being in the world could single-handedly crush an immortal sect and shake an empire.

"The Debt Collector."

Gu Changzhou clenched his fists, staring at the Dragon Pillar.

The Buddhist disciple broke the silence. "Brother Gu, care to explain this imperial treasure?"
