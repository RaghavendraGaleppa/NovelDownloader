# Chapter 68: The Hero

Miss Lin and Butcher Hu arrived at Zhou Qing's courtyard to find the corpse of the Southern Commander of the Martial Virtue Bureau, along with six of his embroidered-uniform guards bound and broken—limbs twisted, jaws dislocated...

The Jiangzhou garrison commander stood silently to the side, his hands trembling slightly.

He truly had no choice earlier. Now, recalling the events, he was terrified to his core.

Killing Gu Fan, the Southern Commander of the Martial Virtue Bureau, wasn't just a career-ending move—it was a crime punishable by execution and the extermination of one's entire clan. This was tantamount to rebellion!

Under Zhou Qing's explanation, Miss Lin gradually pieced together the sequence of events. Her mind was in turmoil, and she couldn't help but ask, "Isn't this too rash?"

The scene before her was too shocking, her emotions too unsettled to articulate properly.

Zhou Qing remained calm and composed, as if unfazed by the enormity of his actions. "The affairs of this world are like tangled hemp—how can one ever sort them out? I've decided not to bother. A swift cut is best."

With his hands clasped behind his back, he paced the courtyard before instructing Miss Lin, "Gather the prominent figures of the city. Tell them I have a major business proposal."

"What if they refuse to come?"

"Then they need never come again."

"Understood. I'll arrange it immediately."

Zhou Qing then directed Butcher Hu to assist her and had the Black Tiger Gang monitor the movements of each household.

After they left, the garrison commander, persuaded by Zhou Qing, wrote and signed a confession before handing it over. He sighed deeply. "Brother Zhou, you've truly ruined me."

Zhou Qing patted his shoulder. "Commander, a man in your position must be decisive. Now, I have another task for you: impose a city-wide curfew and surround the magistrate's office. Remember, I'm cleaning up your mess."

He waved the confession and gestured at Gu Fan's corpse—undeniable proof of the garrison commander's deed.

The commander shook his head and sighed again. "I'll see to it."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Commander, beneath the lion ornament in your bedroom, I left something for you. You might find it... enlightening."

The garrison commander's scalp prickled. From Zhou Qing's earlier actions, he knew that if Zhou Qing said it was there, it was there. The issue wasn't the ornament itself, but the fact that Zhou Qing could enter his bedroom undetected and leave a message. A chill ran down his spine, extinguishing any lingering resistance.

For now, obedience was his only option.

Of the eight prominent families in the city, four arrived—including the Lin family. These four controlled half the city's livelihoods, and combined with the Black Tiger Gang's grain trade, they effectively dictated Jiangzhou's fate.

The four families present had deep business ties with the Lins and knew Zhou Qing stood behind them. Yet, the sight in the courtyard left them stunned.

They recognized the embroidered-uniform guards of the Martial Virtue Bureau. The deceased Commander Gu Fan had recently extorted them. The man had been insatiably greedy, with rumored connections to a retired grand secretary. For an imperial enforcer to collude with a former high official was brazen indeed.

And now, this imperial enforcer lay dead in this humble courtyard.

The atmosphere grew heavy with tension.

"I've summoned you today for one reason," Zhou Qing began calmly. "Several intruders broke into my home. As my friends, I trust you'll assist in dealing with them. Who will step forward first?"

He pointed to the helpless guards, their weapons laid out before the family heads.

The patriarch of the Lu family, who controlled the city's brothels and gambling dens, spoke gravely, "Scholar Zhou, other matters we can discuss, but this is too dangerous. I won't play this treasonous game. Farewell."

The Lu family maintained many enforcers, including martial artists. He had brought the largest retinue. Glancing at the other patriarchs, he signaled his stance—they were on their own.

Before he could turn, Zhou Qing moved like lightning—twisting the Lu patriarch's limbs and dislocating his jaw. The Lu family guards rushed forward but were swiftly incapacitated. The remaining patriarchs paled at Zhou Qing's terrifying prowess.

"My request is simple. Those who find it difficult need only lose their limbs. What say you?"

Under the gaze of Zhou Qing's ghostly martial might and the archers lining the courtyard walls—trained secretly by the Lin family—their resistance crumbled. They took up weapons and executed the guards, then, under Zhou Qing's persuasion, signed confessions.

Zhou Qing smiled serenely. "I've no interest in the Lu family's assets. Divide them amongst yourselves."

Bound to Zhou Qing's cause, the three patriarchs found some solace in this concession.

Zhou Qing planned to address the Golden Light Temple after the spring thunder, once Fu Song and Zhang Jingxiu achieved their breakthroughs. To his surprise, Abbot Zhiwen braved the city's lockdown to visit him alone.

From the rumors, Zhiwen had deduced Zhou Qing's role in recent events and his terrifying martial prowess—near-legendary, if not already at the transcendent Xiantian realm.

Meeting Zhou Qing only confirmed this. The young man's aura, his unhurried heartbeat, and his effortless composure were unlike anything Zhiwen had seen. That such a figure had remained obscure for years, known only for his "Treatise on Plagues," spoke volumes of his patience and cunning.

"So the famed Scholar Zhou is an unshackled sage," Zhiwen praised. "I regret not meeting you sooner."

Zhou Qing chuckled. "By Buddhist standards, my crimes condemn me to hell. How can I be 'unshackled'?"

Zhiwen thought, *A demon like you would unsettle hell itself.*

The abbot cited Buddhist lore about Devadatta, the Buddha's wicked cousin who was nonetheless prophesied to become a Buddha. "The Buddha saw through illusions. Your decisive action mirrors enlightenment. For one of your stature, even hell is paradise."

Amused by the twisted logic, Zhou Qing cut to the chase: "Spare me the flattery. To avoid my wrath, the Golden Light Temple will surrender half its assets, disband its warrior monks, and provide copies of its martial manuals."

Zhiwen bargained. The manuals could be given—Zhou Qing would obtain them eventually anyway. By sharing them, he might even guide Zhou Qing toward Buddhist teachings, benefiting the temple immensely.

In the end, Zhou Qing accepted half the temple's wealth. The warrior monks would not be disbanded but sent to Changzhou with the remaining assets as severance. Only the elderly, infirm, and novices remained under Zhiwen.

Zhou Qing had considered crushing the temple outright but preferred this bloodless resolution. Disarming the Golden Light Temple was essential—it was a lurking threat too close to ignore. Yet he distrusted their allegiance.

For Zhiwen, preserving the temple's physical structure was paramount. Its destruction would shatter morale beyond repair. He believed Zhou Qing was a rising hero who might one day accept their loyalty, offering the temple a foothold in both Jiangzhou and Changzhou.

In turbulent times, wealth invited disaster. Only a true hero could wield it safely.

Zhou Qing watched the mulberry tree in his courtyard, now lush from absorbing fresh corpses. Its leaves rustled like a spectral opera. Without him present, the tree might turn vicious—only his rooster, Mao Ri, dared remain nearby, though never too close.

The tree's efficiency in disposing of bodies spared Zhou Qing any ghostly reprisals. Yet he refrained from overfeeding it, wary of nurturing a monstrous entity.

He pondered the Golden Light Temple's martial arts—their efficacy against supernatural foes and their potential to augment his cultivation. In these chaotic times, true reliance lay not in influence, but in personal strength.

Transcending to the Xiantian realm was just the beginning. Mastery required both power and wisdom to sustain it. His "mad" senior brother's single-minded focus, though born of insanity, likely accelerated his progress.

Half a month later, Jiangzhou stabilized. The magistrate remained a figurehead, his seal the only tool of authority. As the adage went: *Control the emperor to command the nobles.* From empires to counties, the structure was much the same.

---

"Hexagram Nine, repeated frost heralds solid ice."

The magistrate divined his own fate: *The power of life and death slips from my grasp; like frost hardening to ice, this cannot last.* Despondent, he saw no way out.

The wind rose, cold and unkind.

"Chaos begets heroes," he murmured bitterly.

If only *he* were the hero.

Zhou Qing accepted these changes with equanimity. As a cultivator—nearly an immortal by mortal standards—he could expect two centuries of life. By any measure, this was the path of transcendence.
