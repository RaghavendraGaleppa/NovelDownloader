# Chapter 3: Selling Talismans  

Lu Xun didn’t rush to continue drawing talismans. Instead, he left the market and headed to his field. He loosened the soil of his one-acre spirit field, sowed spirit rice seeds, and cast the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique.  

Green Lake Spirit Rice yielded two harvests a year, so timing the sowing was crucial and couldn’t be delayed.  

After finishing his farm work, Lu Xun stood at the edge of the field and surveyed his surroundings. The area was an open expanse filled with spirit fields, where numerous spirit farmers bent over their labor.  

These days marked the ripening period for spirit rice, making the vicinity unusually lively.  

The industries around Green Lake Market were quite prosperous.  

Thanks to the spiritual energy emanating from the second-grade spirit vein at the market’s center, the land stretching seven or eight miles east had been transformed into spirit fields. To the west lay the boundless Green Lake, teeming with abundant resources.  

The farming, aquaculture, and fishing industries that thrived in this environment provided livelihoods for the market’s thousand or so cultivators.  

The area was peaceful, with no rogue cultivators causing trouble—not because the locals were inherently virtuous, but because of the formidable deterrence of the Mo Family’s power.  

Two years ago, after the Mo Family’s patriarch personally executed the notorious Green-Robed Trio, the region entered an era of tranquility. Cultivators who once reveled in murder and arson had since laid low, pretending to be law-abiding citizens.  

For Lu Xun, this was a golden opportunity to develop his skills undisturbed.  

Upon returning from the fields, Lu Xun resumed his talisman-making. Over the next eight days, he dedicated himself entirely to the craft, only taking one day off to tend to his spirit field.  

Soon, the eighty blank talisman papers he had purchased from Old Xu were all used up, leaving him with four Concealment Talismans.  

"If my calculations are correct, my success rate is only five percent. Does that experience value represent the success rate?" Lu Xun mused.  

If so, once he raised his talisman-making experience to forty or fifty, wouldn’t he be able to produce several talismans a day?  

A first-grade low-tier talisman typically sold for one spirit stone. That meant he could earn in two or three days what would otherwise take half a year of farming!  

"Good heavens, that’s terrifying!" Lu Xun couldn’t help but marvel.  

His heart burned with excitement, and he was tempted to immediately draw another hundred or so talismans.  

"Patience, patience. Let’s sell these four first. One step at a time!"  

Suppressing his enthusiasm, Lu Xun tucked the four Concealment Talismans into his robe and headed for the market’s trading district.  

Green Lake Market was located at the westernmost edge of the Wei Kingdom, built beside Green Lake. Beyond it stretched the endless Demon Beast Mountain Range.  

---  

The central area of the market housed the Mo Family’s estate, where the spiritual energy was most concentrated—enough to sustain Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

The further one ventured from the center, the thinner the spiritual energy became, and the lower the average cultivation level of the inhabitants.  

However, for most non-Mo Family cultivators, the true heart of the market was the trading district.  

As Lu Xun approached with his four Concealment Talismans, grand and ornate buildings gradually came into view, bustling with activity.  

Divine Talisman Hall, Hundred Herb Pavilion, Thousand Mechanism Palace—these were the most reputable major shops. Surrounding them were smaller stores and various street stalls.  

Upon entering this area, Lu Xun immediately noticed that the spiritual energy here was several times denser than in Red Maple Alley.  

Too bad cultivation wasn’t allowed here, or he’d be meditating in this spot every day to soak up the energy!  

Finding an unoccupied space at the edge of the trading district, Lu Xun set up a wooden sign that read:  

"Concealment Talismans for Sale!"  

Sitting down, he glanced around.  

At the neighboring stall, a rough-faced middle-aged man sat cross-legged on a mat, a large vat of slowly swimming spirit fish in front of him.  

Opposite him was a woman in a red dress with fair skin and an alluring figure—a beauty, were it not for the long, centipede-like scar marring her face.  

Her stall displayed various demon beast materials and meat, all rich in spiritual energy and highly nourishing for cultivators.  

Lu Xun sighed inwardly and averted his gaze.  

He swore to himself that once he had money, he’d indulge in lavish feasts every day.  

Time passed slowly. After waiting for most of the day, no one stopped at his stall.  

"Business is tough," Lu Xun lamented.  

Just then, a conversation caught his attention from the neighboring stall.  

"Brother Gao, selling fish again?"  

"Haha, Little Hu, want one? Just one spirit stone—delicious and great for cultivation!"  

"No thanks, I just went to Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion yesterday. My pockets are empty now!"  

"Selling fish and surnamed Gao? Now that’s a dangerous man!"  

As Lu Xun turned to look, the red-dressed woman suddenly stood up from her stall and walked over.  

"Concealment Talismans? There aren’t many talisman masters in this market, and I know most of them. You must be new, right?"  

Her slightly hoarse voice reached Lu Xun’s ears.  

"Might I ask the fairy’s name?"  

Sensing the powerful aura emanating from her, Lu Xun tensed slightly and cupped his hands respectfully.  

"I’m Yin Yu."  

The red-dressed woman crossed her arms and gave Lu Xun a once-over.  

Hearing the name and seeing the red dress, Lu Xun immediately recognized her.  

"So it’s the renowned ‘Red Leaf Rain’! My apologies for not recognizing you sooner!"  

Yin Yu, at the seventh layer of Qi Refining, was a prominent figure among the adventurer cultivators of Green Lake Market.  

Adventurer cultivators were those who hunted demon beasts, explored ancient ruins, and sought out various opportunities—living a high-risk, high-reward lifestyle.  

Yin Yu was one of the best among them.  

"Just a modest reputation, courtesy of my peers. No need for formalities. Are you a new talisman master? May I see one of your Concealment Talismans?"  

Lu Xun retrieved one and handed it over, saying,  

"I’ve been studying talisman-making for a while now. I wouldn’t call myself a beginner."  

"Whether you’re a beginner isn’t for you to decide—it’s up to the community’s recognition. As a new face, few will buy from you. Most prefer established shops or familiar sellers."  

As she spoke, Yin Yu examined the talisman carefully.  

As someone who frequently ventured into danger and combat, she was a primary consumer of such talismans and had a keen eye for quality.  

After a moment, she nodded approvingly.  

"This talisman looks decent, but as a newcomer, building a stable clientele won’t be easy."  

"Does the fairy have any advice?"  

"I have plenty of connections and can refer customers to you. But..."  

She trailed off, but Lu Xun understood the implication.  

"Of course! Any talismans you purchase from me will come at a discount," Lu Xun said decisively.  

Yin Yu chuckled. "That’s what I wanted to hear. How many do you have?"  

"Four." Lu Xun produced all four Concealment Talismans.  

Yin Yu nodded. "Good. Just four spirit stones—I’ll take them all."  

"Tsk, ‘just’ four? Must be nice being at the late Qi Refining stage," Lu Xun grumbled inwardly.  

They exchanged goods and payment. Curious, Lu Xun asked,  

"Why would someone like you want to partner with a newcomer like me?"  

"Because you’re young and handsome—just my type. How’s that for a reason?" Yin Yu teased with a smirk.  

Lu Xun choked back a laugh. "Well, I’m honored."  

"Tsk, not even a hint of shyness. But I wasn’t entirely joking. For someone your age to produce talismans of this quality, your talent must be exceptional." Yin Yu gave him a meaningful look.  

That was likely her real reason for approaching him.  

Most talisman masters only reached this level of skill in their forties or later.  

Take Old Xu—he was over eighty and only now matched Lu Xun’s ability, yet he was still considered talented in the craft.  

Talisman-making was a difficult path, far from easy.  

Those with the aptitude for it were rarer than those with cultivation potential. Among Green Lake Market’s thousand cultivators, only a few dozen were true talisman masters.  

Most, like Old Xu, spent decades toiling away, burning through tens of thousands of blank talisman papers to barely scrape together five or six points of experience.  

High-tier talisman masters either came from families with generations of accumulated knowledge or possessed extraordinary natural talent.  

Given Lu Xun’s youth and skill, Yin Yu naturally assumed he had remarkable talent—hence her interest in forming a connection and even investing in him.  

After selling the four talismans to Yin Yu, Lu Xun pocketed four spirit stones.  

But the stones barely had time to warm his hands before he spent them again.  

After a brief exchange with Yin Yu, he excused himself and headed to another corner of the trading district, where he exchanged the four stones for one hundred and sixty blank talisman papers.  

Twenty days later, all the papers were used up, yielding eight new talismans.  

After selling them to Yin Yu, he purchased three hundred and twenty papers, which he exhausted in forty days, earning sixteen spirit stones.  

The cycle repeated.  

Lu Xun threw himself into talisman-making, ignoring everything else except for occasional trips to tend his spirit field.  

Half a year after copying Old Xu’s experience, his savings had grown to thirty-eight spirit stones.  

Every talisman he made was bought by Yin Yu or cultivators she referred.  

---  

Outside the market, by his spirit field:  

"Little Lu, why is your yield still eight hundred jin? No improvement at all?"  

"Manager Mo, what can I do? I’m still a beginner. Getting eight hundred jin is already a blessing."  

"Fine, I won’t pry into how much you’re hiding. As long as I get my share, that’s enough."  

"Six hundred jin to the family, and one hundred for me. Any objections?" Mo the Fat crossed his arms, speaking with an air of authority.  

"Like I’d dare object even if I wanted to," Lu Xun cursed inwardly.  

Outwardly, he nodded. "Of course, no problem."  

"Good, you know the rules. If you want to sell the remaining hundred jin, I’ll give you three spirit stones."  

"Manager Mo is too kind. Let’s do as you say."
