# Chapter 40: The Transaction

The formation in the pavilion suddenly opened. Han Zhen, full of vigor, pushed open the door, only to be met by Han Li's startled gaze.

Han Li certainly hadn't expected him to return from the Immortal Ascension Assembly in less than two days.

He was lounging in a chair, a book in his hand already turned to the last few pages. Han Zhen could see "Qingxi Records" written on the cover.

Seeing this book indicated that some events that were supposed to happen had not changed.

Han Li still managed to buy a fragment of a magical artifact that could conceal spiritual energy and grant invisibility, as well as a flight talisman, from a rogue cultivator's stall.

As for this "Qingxi Records," it was given to Han Li by a low-level Qi Condensation rogue cultivator as a gift after Han Li helped him out of a difficult situation. The book contained miscellaneous essays and anecdotes about the cultivation world of Yue State.

The book recorded details about the Immortal Ascension Token, with clear and straightforward explanations of its value and origin.

"The token is recognized, not the person," meaning it conferred the same qualifications as a victor of the Immortal Ascension Assembly.

Not only did it grant entry qualifications, but it also bestowed a Foundation Establishment Pill.

Without needing any explanation from him, Han Li should understand the importance of the Immortal Ascension Token.

Han Li closed the book, sat up straight, and looked at the complacent Han Zhen.

He had some conjectures in his heart but wasn't certain, so he frowned and asked, "Brother Zhen, what good fortune did you encounter that you didn't even participate in the Immortal Ascension Assembly?"

Because Han Zhen had only been gone for a little over a day, let alone the Immortal Ascension Assembly not even having started yet, this amount of time wasn't even enough for a round trip from Sky Mist Platform.

"Am I that obvious?" Han Zhen asked, completely unaware.

Han Li stretched out his hand, and the Ice Freezing Art generated a mirror. In the mirror, Han Zhen's face bore an unconcealable smile.

Han Zhen pouted. It seemed his bad habit of showing off in front of Han Li hadn't changed.

Whether it was cultivating true qi during martial arts practice, or Evergreen Cultivation Art, spells, or talisman arts...

"Yes, there are two good things!" Han Zhen sat down, his expression turning serious.

Han Li knew that something very important was about to be said.

"The first thing is, because of my outstanding cultivation talent, I was directly admitted to one of the Seven Great Sects without needing to go through the Immortal Ascension Assembly."

Han Zhen selectively recounted what happened during the Immortal Ascension Assembly registration, omitting details about spiritual roots.

After listening, the envy in Han Li's eyes was unconcealable.

But then, the second piece of good news from Han Zhen made Han Li unable to maintain his composure any longer.

"The second thing is this!" Han Zhen said, placing a black triangular token on the table.

"An Immortal Ascension Token!" Han Li rarely lost his calm demeanor.

He immediately opened the book in his hand, then hastily compared it to the illustrations, searching for one with a similar pattern.

"Yellow Maple Valley, this Immortal Ascension Token was issued by Yellow Maple Valley!" Han Li felt his mouth go dry as he stared at the token.

Of course, he also wanted to enter one of the Seven Great Sects; this was almost the only way for rogue cultivators in Yue State to obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill.

And the value of this Immortal Ascension Token needed no words; Brother Zhen had simply placed it right before his eyes.

"Yes, I didn't tell you before because I might have needed it myself, and I didn't want to get your hopes up for nothing."

Han Li nodded, understanding Han Zhen's feelings. After all, hadn't he also not intended to tell anyone about his ability to ripen spiritual herbs?

But judging by Brother Zhen's tone now, it seemed he was going to gift this incredibly precious Immortal Ascension Token to him.

Han Li nervously swallowed. He thought about how Brother Zhen had previously given him spirit stones, and even hadn't hidden the secret of his extraordinary talent in talisman arts from him.

Knowing that he was just a penniless rogue cultivator, yet he had taken out something as precious as an Immortal Ascension Token, which could clearly be sold for a large amount of spirit stones.

The guilt in Han Li's heart magnified countless times, making it difficult for him to reach out for this opportunity that was practically within his grasp.

Han Zhen observed the rapid changes in Han Li's expression. He estimated that Han Li was experiencing the greatest test since the Dr. Mo's body-snatching incident.

Han Li gritted his teeth, taking a long breath as if having made a tremendous decision.

He reached into his robe, then pulled out two brocade boxes from his storage pouch. These were the most precious items he possessed.

"I can't convince myself to simply accept Brother Zhen's gift. Actually, I also have a little secret of my own."

In front of Han Zhen, Han Li opened the two small wooden boxes, revealing spiritual herbs that looked as if they had just been unearthed.

"These are?" Han Zhen had previously received a Millennium Yellow Essence Ganoderma, so he naturally recognized what they were, but he still pretended not to know their value and asked.

"Two millennium spiritual herbs!"

Han Zhen looked up, his gaze towards Han Li filled with surprise.

Han Zhen had initially thought of taking the Heaven-Controlling Bottle for himself.

Faced with such a heaven-defying treasure, Han Zhen naturally couldn't suppress the greed in his heart.

When Han Li first handed the small green bottle he had just picked up to Han Zhen, asking for help to figure out how to open it, Han Zhen immediately wanted to claim the Heaven-Controlling Bottle as his own.

Fortunately, Han Zhen quickly sobered up. When the risks brought by the Heaven-Controlling Bottle outweighed the benefits, Han Zhen naturally weighed the gains and losses carefully.

Isn't there a saying: "A double-pupiled individual is born destined for invincibility; why would they need to borrow another's bones!"

Thus, Han Zhen dispelled the idea of taking the Heaven-Controlling Bottle for himself.

And after Han Li discovered the miraculous uses of the Heaven-Controlling Bottle, it became even more impossible for him to share this secret.

However, Han Zhen was not without a chance to benefit from the Heaven-Controlling Bottle, for example, by appropriately sharing a few secrets without completely revealing everything.

Han Zhen picked up one of the Millennium Yellow Essence Ganoderma, intently examining the color and texture of the herb, then brought it to his nose, pretending to sniff it professionally.

Then he looked at Han Li and said with certainty, "Indeed, these are millennium spiritual herbs, and they've only been unearthed recently, so their medicinal properties are almost perfectly preserved. These two plants are worth far more than this Immortal Ascension Token."

As expected, Han Li's face paled, regretting his carelessness, but at the same time, he was glad that he had exposed his ignorance prematurely to Brother Zhen.

"Are millennium spiritual herbs that valuable?"

But for Han Li, even ten millennium spiritual herbs couldn't compare to this Immortal Ascension Token.

Unfortunately, this was already the most valuable thing he could offer.

"In the future, if you need spiritual talismans, you can come to me for a trade. If you have more millennium spiritual herbs, that would be even better," Han Zhen probed after completing the transaction.

"I only found these two millennium spiritual herbs by accident. Without another stroke of luck, it might be hard to see them again in the future," Han Li shook his head and said with a wry smile.

"I understand, I understand. It's like drawing talismans; once I succeed, every subsequent success is also just an accident," Han Zhen stood up and patted Han Li's shoulder, placing the Immortal Ascension Token in his palm.

"The senior from Spirit Beast Mountain is still waiting for me. Take care."

Han Li's tense heart finally relaxed. He knew what to do.

Half a day later, the giant bird that had caused a commotion earlier reappeared above Southern Heaven Valley.

From a pavilion outside the building, Han Li watched Han Zhen's departing back, his mind filled with a myriad of thoughts.

Without this Immortal Ascension Token, he might have wasted many more years.

He had neither Brother Zhen's talent for direct admission nor the strength to win the Immortal Ascension Assembly.

"When I'm no longer lacking pills, I'll properly repay him."

The large bird flew towards the outside of the valley. Just as it was about to reach the valley entrance, Han Zhen spotted a group of familiar faces.

Among the cultivators leaving in groups of three or five, Daoist Qingwen happened to be one of them.

Han Zhen's gaze deepened. He hadn't forgotten what he had said before.
