# Chapter 321: Is This the Reason?!

He clenched his fist tightly, the玄铁 (Mysterious Iron) gauntlet emitting a creaking sound as if it could not bear the strain.

In the distance, disciples of the Dao Sect sensed something and looked up, but they only saw the dust rising as the校尉 (Company Commander) turned away.

"Retreat."

The word was squeezed out from between the校尉's teeth. When his iron boots stepped over the shattered tiles, his steps were as heavy as if he were walking toward the execution ground.

When Xu Yunfan dragged the dying brocade-clad youth, whom he had taken from the Dao Sect disciples, into the Dao Sect's驻地 (garrison), a winding trail of blood was left on the bluestone floor tiles.

Two guarding disciples were just about to salute when they saw the unsubsided赤芒 (crimson light) in his eyes. The slightly quieted vital energy and blood formed distorted heat waves around his body, and they immediately held their tongues and quickly retreated.

"Fetch three buckets of well water."

He kicked open the wooden door of the side hall. The dragon scale armor on his wrist, due to the rough movement, struck the door frame and produced sparks.

"Ice-cold, and remember to add some coarse salt."

When the piercing well water was splashed onto the youth's face, the纨绔 (playboy)—who claimed to be the Third Young Master of the Prince Mu's Manor—let out a pig-slaughtering wail.

"How dare you?! Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am?!!"

Xu Yunfan grabbed the back of his neck and slammed him onto the elm wood table. The violent impact made the youth let out another piercing scream.

"Can we talk properly now?"

A wisp of pure yang true energy, transformed into a赤焰 (crimson flame), ignited at Xu Yunfan's fingertip. It slowly drew a circle three inches in front of the youth's eyes.

The firelight illuminated the碧磷锁链 (Verdant Phosphorus Chain) on the other's wrist. That section of the organ, glowing with a strange green light, contracted along with the owner's trembling, like a startled venomous snake.

The youth's screaming stopped abruptly from the fright. He stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan standing before him.

The Third Young Master of Prince Mu's Manor, Zhao Yu, suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood foam: "Base slave! My father has three thousand..."

*Crack.*

The table suddenly sank half an inch.

Xu Yunfan's撼岳镇海锤 (Mountain-Shaking Sea-Suppressing Hammer) had somehow already been pressed onto the youth's left ankle. The heavy hammer hadn't even truly fallen; its sheer killing intent had already crushed the sandalwood floorboards.

The firelight made the strange green glow of the Verdant Phosphorus Chain appear even more uncanny. The organ-like object writhed and contracted on Zhao Yu's wrist, secreting a foul, sticky liquid. Xu Yunfan's pupils reflected the green light, and the dragon scale armor on his right arm opened and closed with his breath, making a scraping sound like metal.

"Three thousand what?"

He suddenly leaned down. The true energy pulsed slightly, and the killing intent of the Mountain-Shaking Sea-Suppressing Hammer condensed into a tangible black mist, climbing up the youth's ankle.

The sandalwood floorboards cracked and broke apart in a creaking noise. The moment the splinters pierced Zhao Yu's calf, they were actually devoured by the Verdant Phosphorus Chain.

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and couldn't help but add a bit more force. The Verdant Phosphorus Chain, which grew from flesh and blood, kept squirming, making a sound like tearing silk.

"Ah!!!"

Zhao Yu's scream had just left his throat when Xu Yunfan's left palm clamped down on his天灵盖 (Baihui acupoint on the head). The劲力 (force) generated by the Ten Extremes Martial Way, mixed with pure yang true energy, poured in. The alternating cold and hot pain made the youth's eyes bulge out, and his veins burst into spider-web-like blood patterns at his temples.

The hammer handle suddenly rotated ninety degrees.

The Earth Vein Power brought back from the abyss burst out from the hammer head. The bones in Zhao Yu's left leg made a popping sound like frying beans. The Verdant Phosphorus Chain writhed frantically but could not repair the粉碎性骨折 (comminuted fracture).

Xu Yunfan's five fingers suddenly tightened. A sound like the clashing of gold and iron exploded between his knuckles. The Verdant Phosphorus Chain in his palm let out a death-seeking shriek.

The strange organ twisted frantically, wanting to climb up the hammer handle to counterattack, but the moment it touched his skin, it was steamed into foul black smoke by the pure yang true energy.

*Rip!*

The sticky sound of flesh tearing was particularly clear in the quiet room. The spinal segment connected to the root of the chain was torn off brutally. Black blood, like toxic sludge, splattered onto the sandalwood floor, corroding it into honeycomb-like holes.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, looking at the still-twitching organ in his hand. This Verdant Phosphorus Chain was struggling and writhing like a living creature. The broken end extended countless fleshy buds, trying to regenerate, but they were burned and sizzled by the killing intent left on the hammer head.

"Interesting. It looks like this demon recovers its power very strongly."

He sneered, withdrew the Mountain-Shaking Sea-Suppressing Hammer, and took out the赤火吞龙锏 (Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel). With a light tap, the red patterns on the cudgel body suddenly lit up, and the chain immediately stiffened like a venomous snake clamped by a branding iron.

He tossed it onto the table. The moment it hit, the green flame flared up violently. The sandalwood table actually surfaced with hundreds of twisted human faces in the flames, letting out faint screams like threads.

Xu Yunfan frowned deeply. This was the first time he had seen such a yin-evil thing.

If the spiritual energy of heaven and earth hadn't been stirred up by the Earth Vein, these things would have had no chance of appearing in the world.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips traced the protruding bone spurs on the surface of the chain. The touch was cool and slippery, like snake scales.

This was no ordinary evil object; it was extremely peculiar. The texture was filled with spiritual energy of heaven and earth, but it had been polluted into a dark green color by some strange secret technique.

What was most terrifying were the tiny eyeballs embedded between the links. They opened, closed, and turned along with the flow of spiritual energy, as if recording everything they saw.

Zhao Yu's breakdown came faster than expected.

While researching the flesh-and-blood chain, Xu Yunfan's five fingers clamped down on his wrist bone like an iron pincer.

Before the youth could react, he heard the sound of his own bones popping like frying beans.

Xu Yunfan's force poured out slightly, grinding the joints of his entire right arm into powder inch by inch.

"Ah!!"

The scream had just left his throat when Xu Yunfan slapped it back into his chest.

Zhao Yu convulsed and fell backward. His crotch was already soaked with incontinence, and the foul liquid dripped down the golden threads of his brocade robe.

"I'll talk, I'll talk!!!"

The brocade-clad youth's expression twisted, and he completely broke down.

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan finally loosened his grip slightly.

At this moment, snot and tears were streaming down Zhao Yu's face as he looked up.

"Whatever you want to ask, I'll say it."

Xu Yunfan snapped back to reality and was momentarily speechless. He felt a bit apologetic: "I made you suffer unnecessarily. When I brought you in, I only wanted to torture you and forgot to ask questions."

Zhao Yu almost choked hearing this. How could he not understand that Xu Yunfan clearly wanted to torture him, which was why he acted this way.

"The first question. Why did you scheme against me?"

Zhao Yu's throat rolled. The blood foam overflowing from his mouth mixed with the bitter, foul taste of bile.

His severed right arm was like a beheaded venomous snake, twitching from time to time.

"Schemed against you?"

He let out a hoarse laugh, the sound squeezing out like from a broken bellows. "Xu Yunfan... you, a base seed born of a domestic slave, by what right?"

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes. The red patterns on the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel glowed slightly.

Zhao Yu suddenly began to cough violently, as if his lungs were stuffed with broken glass.

He struggled to lift his head, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins. "The Jiang Mansion raised you for over a dozen years, and you were just a bitter laborer digging mines! But me? I am the Third Young Master of the Prince's Mansion!"

He slammed the ground hard, his knuckles cracking the bronze floor tiles. "Father doesn't even look me in the eye... yet you! You actually became a true disciple of the Dao Sect, even the Imperial City Division has to salute you! Even Father said he has to be courteous to you, I won't accept it!!"

Hearing these words, Xu Yunfan didn't get angry at all; he was just slightly surprised.

Is the reason this simple?
