# Chapter 72: Dao Talisman Mountain  

The confrontation between the two alliances made distinguishing friend from foe necessary, but this presented a headache for Lin Xuan. With the identity-recognition spell embedded in his body, even a simple Spirit Eye technique could easily reveal his affiliation. This completely ruined his plan to disguise himself as a rogue cultivator by not wearing the Piaoyun Valley attire.  

The risks of gathering herbs at the Xiyue Stream would now increase dramatically.  

Not only would he have to face the fangs of demonic beasts, but he would also be hunted by the Fire Spirit Sect and its allies. Just imagining it—the stream was only a few dozen miles from the Fire Spirit Sect’s headquarters—made his head throb.  

With his current cultivation level and the spiritual artifacts at his disposal, Lin Xuan was confident that even if he were surrounded by elite disciples at the Qi Refining stage, he could escape unscathed. But if he encountered a Foundation Establishment expert…  

Having been in Piaoyun Valley for four years, Lin Xuan had rarely interacted with Foundation Establishment cultivators, but he had witnessed their power firsthand on a few occasions. The sheer might and dominance they displayed…  

Although he had now reached the seventh layer of cultivation—just a step away from the next realm—the gap was like an insurmountable chasm. If he encountered a Foundation Establishment expert, he might not even have a chance to flee.  

Lin Xuan was resolute, but he was not immune to the fear of death. Yet, no matter what, he would not abandon his path to immortality.  

After much deliberation, Lin Xuan decided to take the risk and leave the valley to gather herbs at Xiyue Stream. Of course, he wouldn’t go unprepared.  

First, he planned to visit Dao Talisman Mountain.  

This conflict in the cultivation world wasn’t limited to just Piaoyun Valley and the Fire Spirit Sect—other sects in Yanzhou were also involved, forming alliances with one side or the other.  

For centuries, Dao Talisman Mountain and Piaoyun Valley had maintained a close relationship, supporting each other. Naturally, they were now allies.  

As the name suggested, Dao Talisman Mountain specialized in talisman-making.  

While talismans couldn’t compare to spiritual artifacts, they could be activated instantly without consuming spiritual energy. Lin Xuan had personally experienced their benefits during his battles with Yan Tianheng and Ye Tian.  

If he could acquire more talismans, his chances of success would increase.  

As for what he could trade for them—pills were too conspicuous. Fortunately, Lin Xuan was no longer the same as before. He had accumulated a fair number of spirit stones, the standard currency in the cultivation world.  

After packing his belongings—storing all his treasures in the storage bracelet—he used the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to assume a new appearance and left Piaoyun Valley.  

---  

Unlike his previous trip to the Lingyun Sect, Lin Xuan had now mastered basic spirit control. He directly summoned his spiritual artifact, transforming into a streak of blue light that shot toward the horizon.  

The wind howled in his ears, and white clouds drifted before his eyes. The sensation of soaring above the world, gazing down upon the mountains below, filled Lin Xuan with exhilaration. All thoughts of danger and hardship vanished from his mind. No matter what, he would obtain the spiritual herbs and achieve Foundation Establishment.  

His current speed wasn’t quite "a thousand miles in an instant," but it was still impressive. Dao Talisman Mountain was over five hundred miles from Piaoyun Valley, yet he arrived by noon.  

Lin Xuan descended but didn’t immediately approach the mountain. Instead, he rested until the six-hour cooldown of the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art ended, allowing him to change his appearance once more before making his visit.  

However, he didn’t change out of his Piaoyun Valley robes. Since no one here knew him, and the two sects were allies, wearing the uniform would make things easier.  

"Who goes there?"  

Not long after he began walking with the Wind Riding Technique, a cold voice rang out. Two young cultivators in their twenties appeared several feet ahead.  

Lin Xuan tensed, realizing he had inadvertently triggered Dao Talisman Mountain’s warning formation. If he answered incorrectly, he might find himself trapped in an offensive array.  

Major sects were always surrounded by layers of formations, which fell into two categories: warning formations to alert them of visitors, and offensive-defensive arrays.  

The power of these formations was immense. Even a Foundation Establishment expert could be captured or killed if trapped. There were even rumors that two hundred years ago, Piaoyun Valley’s "Infinite Star Formation" had slain a Core Formation master.  

Of course, that was Piaoyun Valley or Dao Talisman Mountain—top-tier sects in Yanzhou. Smaller sects or clans didn’t have such formidable formations, but they were still not to be underestimated.  

Though the two cultivators blocking his path weren’t particularly strong, Lin Xuan didn’t dare to be careless. He cupped his hands and said, "Greetings, fellow Daoists. I am Ye Tian of Piaoyun Valley, here to pay a visit."  

"Piaoyun Valley?"  

Their expressions softened slightly, though they remained wary. The one on the left pressed a finger to his forehead, summoning a green light that formed a third eye between his brows.  

Lin Xuan wasn’t offended by this action and simply stood there with a smile.  

The green light flickered a few times before stabilizing into the shape of an eye—this was the Spirit Eye technique of the cultivation world, used to see through disguises and assess cultivation levels. Now, it also served to identify allies or enemies based on the implanted spell.  

The cultivator focused on Lin Xuan, and after a moment, his expression first relaxed before turning to astonishment. The visitor was actually a peak Qi Refining expert!  

Lin Xuan hadn’t concealed his cultivation level. The reason was simple—cultivators were a pragmatic bunch. If you were strong, they would respect and flatter you. If you were weak, you’d be lucky to avoid mockery, let alone receive help.  

Since he was disguised as Ye Tian, no matter how ostentatious he acted, it wouldn’t be traced back to him. With that in mind, Lin Xuan decided to be bold.  

Seeing a genuine Piaoyun Valley disciple—and an elite at the seventh layer at that—the two junior cultivators immediately put on ingratiating smiles.  

"Ah, Senior Brother from Piaoyun Valley! Our apologies for the rudeness. What brings you here? Is there anything we can assist you with?"
