# Chapter 25: The Eldest Branch's Second Steward

The maid Qingmei said displeasedly, "Who is it? Even the report is muddled!"

"It's the Second Steward!"

"I heard that, I'm asking you, *who* is here?"

Qiaoshe replied, "It is... Second Steward Yang Can has arrived. The Clan Master personally appointed him as the Second Steward of the Eldest Branch, and Steward Deng is accompanying him."

The courtyard maids and matrons immediately caused an uproar, whispering and buzzing amongst themselves.

The Clan Master sent a Second Steward?

Then wasn't this "Second Steward" Qingmei... just a self-proclaimed title?

Qingmei was instantly embarrassed. How could the Clan Master send a Second Steward?

I just established my authority; if I lose my prestige now, how can I intimidate these "old retainers of the Yu family" in the rear court in the future?

Little Qingmei's mind turned, and she let out a soft "Oh," saying calmly, "So the Deputy Second Steward appointed by the Clan Master has already arrived. Qiaoshe, you really lack observation skills. Since Steward Deng personally delivered the person, how could you make him wait?"

"Without Sister Qingmei's orders, this servant wouldn't dare make the decision," Qiaoshe replied with a touch of sarcasm.

Qingmei glared with her beautiful eyes. "Hurry up and invite Steward Deng and the Deputy Second Steward in. I will report to the Young Mistress."

"Understood, Second Steward!" Qiaoshe, eager to watch the drama, quickly turned and ran off in a hurry.

In the flower hall, the beauty lay reclining on the Xiangfei couch, Suo Chanzhi was deep in thought.

She had officially moved into Phoenix Mountain Manor as the wife of the eldest son of the Yu family.

Managing the internal affairs of the eldest branch wasn't actually that difficult.

Because Yu Chengye's internal assets weren't that substantial. Externally, there was an orchard on Phoenix Mountain, a poultry and vegetable estate, plus two industrial workshop production lines: the salt pools in Lingzhou and the iron smelting in Heishui.

Currently, these were only nominally under her control. The specific management of these industries fell to the Chief Steward of the eldest branch, Li Youcai, and several external stewards.

Li Youcai was a man of the old eldest branch and was not under her control.

However, Suo Chanzhi wasn't in a rush. Her priority was to control the rear court.

If she couldn't conceive, any plans she made now would be in vain.

So, she only needed to forge the rear court into a solid block of iron.

That way, once she became pregnant, she could ensure that when the child was born nine months later, it would definitely be a boy, no matter what.

She had already handed the task of disciplining the old maids and matrons of the rear court to the girl Qingmei. She was now only worried about whether she could actually conceive.

Yang Can, oh Yang Can... I let you bully me for so long, don't you dare let me down.

Suo Chanzhi had just thought of this when she heard Little Qingmei's urgent call.

"Young Mistress, Young Mistress, Yang Can, Yang Can he..."

Qingmei rushed into the room, panting as she called out.

Suo Chanzhi shot up from the Xiangfei couch. "Yang Can? What about him?"

"Huh?"

Qingmei didn't expect the Young Mistress to react so strongly. She was stunned for a moment before saying, "He... he's here."

"He's here?"

Suo Chanzhi widened her eyes in surprise. "How did he come here? Wait, how could he... come to the rear court?"

Qingmei remembered her "Second Steward" title that hadn't even warmed her hands yet and said anxiously, "The Clan Master appointed him as the Second Steward of the Eldest Branch! Steward Deng brought him here."

"What?"

Suo Chanzhi's face lit up with joy, and she said excitedly, "Quick, quick, have him... have Steward Deng and the others come in."

Little Qingmei pouted. Look at how cheap my young mistress is acting! So love can be transferred, huh?

" Deng Xun (Yang Can) greets the Young Mistress."

Steward Deng brought Yang Can into the flower hall and bowed to the already seated Suo Chanzhi.

Suo Chanzhi glanced at Yang Can. Yang Can wore a blue round-collared robe with a waist sash and a black turban. He seemed... even more handsome.

Suo Chanzhi's eyes couldn't help but ripple with emotion, shimmering with light.

After Yang Can finished his greeting, he looked at Suo Chanzhi.

Suo Chanzhi wore a plain-colored casual dress. Her face was as moist as water and as radiant as jade. From her very bones, she exuded a fresh, youthful charm of a young wife, even more enchanting.

Steward Deng bowed to Suo Chanzhi and said, "The Young Master has unfortunately passed away, and now the Young Mistress is solely in charge of the Eldest Branch. Everyone in the Yu family is watching. The Clan Master is worried that if the Young Mistress makes any oversight or mistake, it might give others a handle to use. Therefore, he has assigned Yang Can to the Eldest Branch as Second Steward to share the Young Mistress's burdens."

"Good!"

Suo Chanzhi blurted out, then immediately received a warning look from Yang Can. Her heart gave a jolt.

*No, how can I show that I'm delighted about this?*

Suo Chanzhi immediately sneered, "Very good! Doesn't the Clan Master know that this Yang Can holds a great prejudice against the Suo family?"

Steward Deng smiled. "Young Mistress, please don't be angry. Yang Can was originally the Young Master's advisor. He is loyal to the Young Master and is very familiar with the affairs of the Eldest Branch. Having him serve as the Steward of the Eldest Branch can better assist the Young Mistress."

Steward Deng paused and continued, "As for Yang Can's past reckless words, having him assist the Young Mistress now would make those previous statements collapse on their own. This also demonstrates the Young Mistress's broad-mindedness."

"Hmph, I am a petty woman with a narrow mind; I have no need for broad-mindedness."

Steward Deng still wore a smile, but his tone加重了几分 (heavier): "Young Mistress, this is the Master's intention."

Suo Chanzhi flicked her sleeve slightly and said calmly, "Originally, since the Clan Master has made such an arrangement, it is not easy for this daughter-in-law to refute. However, I have just arranged for Qingmei to be the Second Steward of the Eldest Branch. Now, to gain a reputation for going back on my word, how can I manage the Eldest Branch in the future?"

Little Qingmei was overjoyed upon hearing this. *So the young mistress loves me the most after all.*

Steward Deng remained impassive and said淡淡地 (calmly), "The Second Master has handed over all six estates and three pastures. According to the Master's intention, he wants to transfer all these industries to the Eldest Branch for management. Sending over such a young and capable person as Yang Can is also because he is worried that the Eldest Branch might not be able to take care of everything properly if it suddenly takes over so many industries. If the Young Mistress insists on not allowing Yang Can to serve in the Eldest Branch, then... this old servant will simply report the facts to the Master."

"Wait a minute!"

Hearing that Yu Xinglong wanted to transfer all six estates and three pastures to the Eldest Branch for management, Suo Chanzhi immediately stopped Steward Deng.

"Ahem! I have thought it over carefully. After all, Qingmei is still young and may not have the ability to manage the industries under the Eldest Branch. How about this: Yang Can will serve as the Second Steward of the Eldest Branch, and Qingmei... can be the Deputy Second Steward of the Eldest Branch."

Qingmei pouted. But in front of outsiders, she didn't dare violate the hierarchy and didn't say anything.

Upon hearing this, Steward Deng's lips couldn't help but twitch a few times.

The stewards of the Eldest Branch are already divided into first, second, and third ranks, and now they are adding deputies? Deputy Second Steward? What a bizarre title.

Steward Deng smiled and said, "Yes, the Young Mistress's arrangement is to better manage the Eldest Branch's industries. The Master will surely have no objections. This old servant will report to the Master upon returning."

Steward Deng finished speaking, took a step back, and clasped his hands with a smile. "Now that the Second Steward of the Eldest Branch has been delivered, this old servant will take his leave."

"Please walk slowly, Steward Deng. Qingmei, see Steward Deng out for me."

Steward Deng repeatedly said he wouldn't dare, but was still sent out by Qingmei.

The room was left with only Yang Can and Suo Chanzhi. Suo Chanzhi slowly stood up, her plain-colored skirt flowing down like water.

"I didn't expect your unorthodox method to actually work. Yu Xinglong really valued you."

Yang Can shook his head. "Not necessarily. I think the Yu Clan Master has just made a casual move."

"A casual move? What do you mean?"

"If you cannot conceive, or if you don't give birth to a boy, the industries the Yu Clan Master has allocated to the Eldest Branch can be taken back at any time. I, this Second Steward, can naturally become a figurehead at any moment."

Suo Chanzhi glanced sideways at Yang Can. "You knew this, so why did you come?"

Yang Can sighed. "Although we don't have the title of husband and wife, we have the reality of it. How could I bear to abandon you?"

Haha...

Suo Chanzhi treated his words as nonsense. *You wouldn't bear it? Who was it that used his wife so ruthlessly, without a bit of tenderness? Pah, beast!*

Suo Chanzhi thought again of the embarrassing time when Yang Can had disguised himself as a pastry chef. She hardened her beautiful face and let out a cold snort.

"Don't talk so nicely. Your usefulness may not be that great. Don't forget, there is still a Chief Steward above you."

"I know, Li Youcai, the Chief Steward. I had a few dealings with him when I was an advisor." Yang Can thought for a moment and said, "This man values the iron smelting in Heishui and the salt mines in Ling Pool the most. He isn't too concerned with the affairs inside the Eldest Branch. We don't need to worry too much."

Yang Can paused and then asked, "You... how much longer until you can be sure if you're pregnant?"

Hearing this, Suo Chanzhi's expression softened. She subconsciously touched her lower abdomen and replied in a low voice, "I asked several matrons. They said that even if we find a skilled physician to take my pulse, we still need another six or seven days."

Yang Can nodded. Thinking that in just a week, he would know if he had offspring in this world, his heart couldn't help but beat a little faster.

At this time, Little Qingmei returned after seeing off Steward Deng. As soon as she entered the flower hall, she said angrily, "That old thing Yu Xinglong sent Yang Can, who holds a great prejudice against us, over here. What does he mean by this?"

Suo Chanzhi shook her head. "To control many with one is to balance and restrain. Anyone would do the same. It's not unreasonable."

Yang Can looked at Qingmei. Qingmei glared and said, "What are you looking at? I'm not afraid of you even if you stare. Let's get this straight: you are the Deputy Second Steward, and I am the Chief Second Steward."

Yang Can said, "Alright, you're second, I'm third, okay?"

Qingmei was stunned. She didn't expect him to be so agreeable and felt a bit embarrassed. "That's not necessary. How about... inside the rear court, I'm the chief and you're the deputy; outside the rear court, you're the chief and I'm the deputy."

Suo Chanzhi nodded. "That's fine. It's reasonable for the two of you to compete with each other, so others won't be suspicious."

Qingmei clenched her fists and said, "So I can still compete with him? That's great. Surnamed Yang, then let's each rely on our own abilities!"

Yang Can shook his head slightly, too lazy to argue with a little girl. Unless... it was just a verbal argument. Yang Can glanced at that red, pouting little mouth.

Suo Chanzhi said, "Alright, since the Clan Master has sent him to the Eldest Branch, Qingmei, take him to see Chief Steward Li and make the introduction!"
