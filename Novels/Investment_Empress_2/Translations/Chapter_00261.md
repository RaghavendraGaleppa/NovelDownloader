# Chapter 261: Summoning Wind and Rain, the Name of the Sky Flood Resounds Through the Southern Frontier!

"My name is Wu Mo, and I am a flood dragon from the Eastern Wasteland."

Xiao Li Mingjiao stood on the stage, introducing himself.

As everyone knew, he was the Best Actor from the first Golden Statue Awards of the Qingyuan Sect.

He caressed the clam pearl he had just purchased at a high price and spoke with genuine emotion:

"Since I was young, I have been a flood dragon, growing up in a strange human territory. My father was severely injured when I was very young, and my mother also weakened her body giving birth to me..."

"But upon hearing that our Mingjiao clan was in need, I traveled thousands of miles to come to the Southern Frontier."

"This is all because I have a dream!"

After his exclamation, some demons were already gasping in surprise.

Traveling thousands of miles to the Southern Frontier?

Just for a dream?

Needless to ask, this dream must be to revitalize the Water Clan!

All the demons present were deeply moved.

Facing a flood dragon with such a tragic background, who hadn't even seen his own clansmen since childhood, yet still overcame all difficulties to come and contribute his strength, who wouldn't be deeply shaken?

"Rare, truly rare. Our Water Clan needs a sincere Sky Flood Dragon like this!"

Wu Qing seemed to think of something, wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, and took the lead to stand up and applaud.

Thus, applause erupted from the judges' panel.

If the judges were applauding, could the other Water Clans just sit idly by?

So, just from the self-introduction alone, Xiao Li Mingjiao won a full house of applause, making it seem as if he had already won the competition.

"He hasn't even started displaying his bloodline power yet!"

The Young Clan Leader of Xiangliu slapped the table, and the table collapsed under his immense power.

What's the use of talking pretty?

If his bloodline power turns out to be weak later, wouldn't he just be a laughingstock?

The Water Clans at the same table looked bewildered.

Wait, bro.

It's one thing that you eat faster than anyone else, no one can compete with that.

But why are you flipping the table after you're already full?

"Your conviction is commendable! However, competing for the Divine Jade of the Heavens is extremely dangerous. Conviction alone is not enough. Let everyone see your bloodline power."

Wu Qing and the many elders of the Mingjiao clan were now looking forward to this Wu Mo.

If such a sincere clansman has excellent bloodline power, then with a little cultivation in the future, he could shoulder a great responsibility!

"Naturally."

Li Mo nodded in agreement with a calm demeanor. He transformed into his demon form, instantly turning into a Mingjiao several zhang long.

His entire body's scales were the color of dark clouds, and his majestic dragon head showed the purity of his bloodline!

Immediately, exclamations of surprise rang out among the demons.

This Wu Mo's bloodline is actually so pure?

The two heads of the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader frowned simultaneously, as if this was outside his expectations.

But he quickly recovered his composure.

Even a pure-blooded Mingjiao is not as powerful as the Xiangliu clan.

How could he possibly defeat the Green Luan Goddess?

"Brother Li seems to have never practiced controlling water vapor..."

Mu Fengxiao was a bit nervous.

He knew that Brother Li was not a true demon, relying on a transformation technique.

What if he accidentally reveals his true form?

There are no lack of Fifth Rank great demons, and even Fourth Rank demon kings present. If his human identity is discovered, the consequences would be severe.

But Xiao Li never planned to do it himself.

Summon Wind and Rain Talisman, activate!

*Rumble—*

The sound of thunder echoed. The dark clouds that were already gathering in the sky suddenly turned even darker, as if brewing an imminent storm.

"Achoo!"

Li Mo sneezed.

A gale suddenly rose, and electric snakes broke through the layers of clouds, tearing the first opening for the coming rain.

*Pitter-patter—*

As the first drop of rain fell, it was like a river bursting its banks. The world was quickly flooded with dense water droplets, a vast expanse of white.

The rain poured down, leaving countless demons drenched and bewildered.

"Is this the wind and rain he summoned?"

"This is a Mingjiao? I'd believe you if you said this was a Dragon!"

"He never received any inheritance from his clan, how could he achieve such a level?"

"Without any guidance, he must have put in a lot of sweat and effort to get to this point."

---

"Our Mingjiao clan is finally about to produce a true Sky Flood Dragon!"

"Is Wu Mo still unmarried? I wonder if he likes shrimp-headed girls..."

The Water Clans watching by the lake, including the members of the Mingjiao clan, were all in an uproar.

They were already calculating how to ask Xiao Li to breed with the women of their clan.

Such a powerful bloodline, if inherited by his offspring, would definitely be extraordinary.

What was even more terrifying was that he could not only summon the wind and rain, but also make them stop!

The two heads of the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader looked at each other in dismay, feeling an uncontrollable sense of panic in their hearts.

No.

A Mingjiao with a stronger bloodline could never surpass the Xiangliu clan.

And this Wu Mo was so young.

Bloodline strength does not equal actual strength...

"Wu Mo, we, the judges, unanimously give you a perfect score for your performance!"

The fish in the lake quickly arranged themselves into the number 'ten'.

"Thank you for your cultivation, elders."

Li Mo cupped his paws together, showing a very humble demeanor. Truly a cultured flood dragon, knowledgeable and reasonable.

Wu Qing and Mu Fengxiao exchanged a glance and asked him to come find them alone after the auditions.

Xiao Li happily agreed.

Then came the long audition process again.

It wasn't until nightfall that the twelve outstanding Water Clans began their actual combat.

This combat was not meant to determine rankings.

It was just to let the judges see each contestant's performance in battle.

Guess what happened?

The Xiangliu Young Clan Leader and Xiao Li Mingjiao actually had a chance to fight.

Stepping onto the擂台 (arena), the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader said:

"I see you are young, so I won't use my bloodline power to bully you. How about we compete in physical strength?"

A wave of boos immediately came from the audience.

Besides bloodline power, demons also have incredibly powerful physical bodies.

But clearly, Wu Mo's bloodline is his reliance. You actually want to compete in physical strength?

What's the difference between this and an adult asking a child to compete in strength?

Have you no shame?

Li Mo secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

His control over water vapor was even weaker than that of an ordinary Mingjiao. The wind and rain he had just shown were impressive, but they had nothing to do with him.

He was trying to find a way to avoid that aspect.

He didn't expect the two-headed Xiangliu Young Master to bring it up himself.

It seems having more heads doesn't equal higher intelligence...

"Sure."

"Hehehe... I'll let you make the first move. Let me see what you mean by 'slight出手' (slight move)."

The Xiangliu Young Clan Leader laughed happily.

"You said it yourself."

Li Mo also smiled happily.

The taste of the Nine-Dragon Strength Pill... is really good.

...

A few days later.

The news that a Sky Flood Dragon had appeared in the Mingjiao clan of the Black Water Marsh spread like the wind to the major demon clans of the Southern Frontier.

Recently, it has just passed the sixtieth year cycle, the time when the Divine Jade of the Heavens is about to reappear. The most concerned issue for the various clans of the Southern Frontier is which family the Divine Jade will ultimately fall into. This is a major event concerning every clan.

The more outstanding a clan's genius is, the greater the probability of obtaining the Divine Jade.

Moreover.

This Sky Flood Dragon of the Mingjiao clan, just like the Green Luan Goddess, made the Xiangliu Young Clan Leader lose another head.

And it was beaten to pieces.

The news sprouted wings and quickly reached the ears of the great clans.

The Qiongqi clan, the Great Peng clan, the Golden Fur Howler clan, the Luwu clan, and also...

The Green Luan clan.

...

PS: I'll just skip the more cliché plot points. I find writing this kind of battle uninteresting, and it would be boring for you to read as well. There's no need to pad it out.

Is this a super chat? (Searching my pockets), did you esteemed viewers specifically bring it for this little author?
