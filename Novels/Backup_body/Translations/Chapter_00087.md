# Chapter 87: The Indestructible Spirit, The Limitless Magic!

Within the Falling Dragon Cave Heaven, celestial phenomena shifted violently as the earth trembled.

Thunderstorms, torrential rains, gales, flames, formations, and sword lights raged unchecked, nearly tearing heaven and earth asunder.

In such a dire situation, none below the Human Immortal realm dared intervene—even those at the True Qi stage couldn’t withstand the slightest ripple of the battle’s aftershocks.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing had no time to think. He retrieved the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber from the Phoenix Wooden Box.

Then he took out the bronze mirror that had saved his life several times and began cutting it open along its edges.

This bronze mirror, bestowed by Elder Gu, was of an exceptionally high grade, nearly indestructible. Even the full-force strike of the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation before his death couldn’t pierce it.

Yet, the mirror’s edges seemed to have been deliberately weakened, as if waiting for him to split it open.

Li Zhengjing took a deep breath, pried open the bronze mirror, and split it into two halves.

Inside lay an object—a fragmented jade piece identical to the one Yuan Zhengfeng had used to house his soul!

A fragment of the Underworld’s Netherworld Lord’s divine jade body!

"Hurry!" Yuan Zhengfeng urged.

Li Zhengjing pried open Elder Gu’s mouth and stuffed the jade fragment inside.

Knowing what to do, he channeled True Qi from his hand’s acupoints, circulating it through Elder Gu’s body along the pathways of the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique, gradually drawing out the Human Immortal’s magic power and returning it to its original owner.

Elder Gu, though dead, now had his magic power restored, reviving him.

"This is Elder Gu Xuan, the Supreme Elder of our Feather Transformation Immortal Sect," Yuan Zhengfeng explained. "He obtained a jade fragment in his early years. His feigned death was the same as mine—he poured all his magic power, containing his soul, into the fragment, leaving his body empty, making it appear as if he had perished."

"But he hasn’t perished," Li Zhengjing said, watching Elder Gu gradually revive.

"After I abandoned my fleshly body, it took over a decade to decay into bones," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "But Elder Gu and the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief had planned this long ago. They set up formations beneath his coffin and altered the burial soil to preserve his body. As long as his magic power returned, he could revive!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing’s expression was complicated. He had thought this person was the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, who had faked his death and assumed the identity of Elder Jing Xiao.

But Elder Jing Xiao’s body had been taken over seventeen years ago.

Thus, Elder Gu wasn’t the Debt Collector. From the start, Li Zhengjing had been wrong!

This was a hidden Human Immortal, a powerful ally prepared by the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief for this very moment!

In an instant, Elder Gu opened his eyes, his gaze blazing as he looked toward the sky.

"Thank you, young friend!"

Elder Gu stood up, observing the chaotic heavens, and sighed. "After my slumber, the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief has grown tremendously, nearly matching the prowess of the previous Sect Master!"

The previous Sect Master of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect had merged two supreme techniques to cultivate the Dragon-Tiger Storm Refining Supreme Technique. Though he hadn’t perfected it, his power was enough to dominate the world.

Had he not perished due to the Debt Collector, the previous Sect Master might have become the next Celestial Azure Dao Lord, leading the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect to the pinnacle of the Daoist sects!

Over the years, the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief had feigned submission to the Debt Collector, partly because he lacked the confidence to kill him and partly to obtain the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique from the Debt Collector, allowing him to deduce the complete Dragon-Tiger Storm Refining Supreme Technique.

Now that he had found the Debt Collector’s weakness and obtained the complete technique from Li Zhengjing, he had no more reservations in this final battle!

"The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief has grown stronger, but the Debt Collector is clearly even more formidable," Elder Gu sighed. He stretched his limbs, ensuring his magic power flowed unimpeded, then exhaled deeply. "I’m off!"

In a flash, he transformed into a streak of light, soaring into the sky to join the battle!

Five Human Immortals united to besiege the Debt Collector!

"Young friend Zhengjing, let’s go too!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page’s fortune-telling.

**Fortune:** Swallow the jade fragment, absorb Yuan Zhengfeng’s magic power, and join the battle, forming a siege of six Human Immortals against the Debt Collector!

Since Yuan Zhengfeng is only at the early Human Immortal stage, his magic power is the weakest. Moreover, you are not a Human Immortal and cannot fully unleash the power of his magic, making you the weakest among the six.

The Debt Collector, enraged by the siege—a situation you caused—will target you first in the battle, crushing and killing you on the spot, your blood staining the sky!

"Wait a moment longer!"

Li Zhengjing immediately slung the Phoenix Wooden Box on his back and leaped back into the golden pool of magma.

"Young friend Zhengjing, our allies are fighting a great enemy! How can you hesitate?" Yuan Zhengfeng urged frantically. "And this concerns the Debt Collector—killing him means saving your own life! Hurry up!"

"Too weak to even be a chicken—going up there is suicide!" Li Zhengjing retorted. "Let me absorb this golden magma first to bolster my strength!"

"Don’t you feel anything seeing such a fierce battle ahead?" Yuan Zhengfeng wished he could seize Li Zhengjing’s body and charge into the fight himself.

"..."

Li Zhengjing ignored him, submerging himself in the golden magma to absorb its spiritual energy, circulating the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique and the Feather Transformation Dragon-Riding Celestial Technique.

But then, he noticed something strange.

The golden magma was rapidly receding!

"What’s happening?"

"This is the spiritual energy of the cave heaven, concentrated here as a spiritual vein," Yuan Zhengfeng explained. "Now that the cave heaven is on the verge of collapse, the spiritual energy is draining away to restore it, so the golden pool is shrinking... but the speed is unusually fast!"

"Get out!" Li Zhengjing quickly retrieved the Five Elements Creation Tree from the Phoenix Wooden Box and placed it in the golden magma. "Don’t waste it—absorb it quickly... Wait, where’s the freeloader?"

"Its grandfather thought it was too weak and would just die here, so it was left outside," the Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "Honestly, I’m weak too and wanted to stay outside. But without me, Big Brother would be useless, unable to guide you in reviving Elder Gu. So I was dragged along... Big Brother doomed me. If we all die here, only Birdie will be left to collect our corpses."

"..."

Li Zhengjing ignored the tree, frantically absorbing the golden magma. In moments, he had opened over a hundred acupoints!

True Qi surged outward, his acupoints fully connected.

He had now reached the mid-level of the True Qi stage!

But given how quickly the golden magma was vanishing, he wouldn’t have enough time to reach the peak True Qi stage before it was gone.

He took a deep breath, gripping the jade fragment, and thought, *If I join the battle to kill the Debt Collector, what will happen?*

He looked at the golden page again.

The fortune remained unchanged—he would still be the weakest Human Immortal, killed in anger by the Debt Collector.

But beneath the fortune, a method to alter fate appeared.

Then, to his shock, Li Zhengjing felt himself suddenly plummet downward!

In that instant, the entire golden magma pool had been completely drained, revealing the full method to change his fate!

With the magma gone, he landed at the bottom of the valley, looking around to see thirty-six hollow passages leading to every corner of the Falling Dragon Cave Heaven.

"The golden magma’s spiritual energy is exhausted!" Yuan Zhengfeng shouted. "Young friend Zhengjing, let’s go!"

"The time isn’t right yet!"

Li Zhengjing checked the method to alter fate, then handed the Phoenix Wooden Box to the Five Elements Creation Tree. "Take this and go through that passage. Smash everything you see along the way—make sure to destroy it all!"

"Huh?" The tree was stunned for a moment before understanding. "Even if we die, we won’t let him have anything nice—destroy all his treasures, right?"

"..." Li Zhengjing’s eye twitched. "Something like that."

"What are you doing?" Yuan Zhengfeng was frantic. "If we join the fight now and kill the Debt Collector, all his treasures will be ours! Even if we die, it’ll be a worthy death. Why care about what happens after?"

"This is the key to victory!"

Li Zhengjing swallowed the jade fragment and began circulating the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique.

Since returning from Fengdu Mountain, though only a few days had passed, Li Zhengjing had grown from the ninth-inch Internal Qi stage to the thirteenth-inch, breaking through to the True Qi stage and opening over a hundred acupoints. His cultivation had increased nearly tenfold, his body had grown stronger, and the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure granted him boundless vitality.

Thus, this time, Yuan Zhengfeng’s Human Immortal magic power flowed through him without causing severe strain or damage.

"Young friend Zhengjing, relax. I’ll take over and join the fight."

"Listen to me and stay quiet!"

Li Zhengjing used the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique to guide the Human Immortal magic power with his True Qi. With every movement, his power was unfathomable.

Through the Feather Transformation Dragon-Riding Celestial Technique, he could barely control the Human Immortal magic power!

He glanced at the golden page’s method to alter fate and thought, *This time, I’ll fight the Debt Collector myself!*

---

Above the sky, the battle raged. The Debt Collector, alone, faced five Human Immortals.

The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief, Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official, Elder Gu, the Formation Pavilion’s Master, and the White Azure Venerable all unleashed their full power, their divine abilities shaking heaven and earth.

Yet the Debt Collector remained composed, countering their attacks effortlessly, holding his ground against five Human Immortals without faltering.

"How can he be this strong?"

The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief’s expression darkened.

He was among the world’s mightiest, having once fought three enemies alone at Fengdu Mountain and emerged unscathed, his fame spreading far and wide.

After returning, he obtained the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique and cultivated the Dragon-Tiger Storm Refining Supreme Technique, advancing his power further!

At this moment, he believed he had reached the pinnacle of mortal cultivation, the highest level possible!

One more step, and he might ascend to immortality, rivaling the Celestial Azure Dao Lord!

Yet even with such power, the Debt Collector suppressed him effortlessly.

Five Human Immortals combined couldn’t overpower this "weakened" Debt Collector!

Worse, the five Human Immortals were exhausting their magic power rapidly with their relentless attacks.

But the Debt Collector showed no signs of fatigue—his magic power was limitless, inexhaustible!

"Four thousand years of longevity prove his soul is indestructible, his spirit undying. As long as spiritual energy exists, his magic power will never deplete!"

The White Azure Venerable flapped its wings, unleashing a sea of flames.

"This cave heaven is rich in spiritual energy, concentrated into the golden magma. His magic power will never run out."

Elder Gu shouted, forming hand seals and pressing forward.

But the Debt Collector stepped forward, his left hand flicking out, transforming into countless streams of light that shattered Elder Gu’s seals.

"Senior Brother Gu, I long suspected you were a hidden Human Immortal. When you suddenly 'died,' I personally handled your funeral and confirmed your body held no magic power—you were truly dead."

The Debt Collector’s gaze was cold as he advanced. "I never imagined you’d use the Underworld Lord’s jade fragment to feign death and revive. Today, I’ll make sure you die for good!"

The other four Human Immortals rushed to intervene, but the Debt Collector grabbed Elder Gu with his right hand, using him as a shield.

For a brief moment, the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief, the Formation Pavilion’s Master, the White Azure Venerable, and Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official hesitated.

In that instant, the Debt Collector’s left hand struck, the streams of light piercing Elder Gu’s body.

Elder Gu’s pupils contracted—he couldn’t dodge in time.

Though his body was that of a Human Immortal, the blow tore through his waist, sending him crashing to the ground.

But the Debt Collector’s aura only grew stronger as he turned to face the remaining four.

"Ancient Moon, is this your grand ambush?"

The Formation Pavilion’s Master roared, "Didn’t you say he’s at his weakest in millennia? How is he this strong? Even the Celestial Azure Dao Lord might not have been this formidable!"

Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official flapped his wings, soaring higher, his heart shaken. *The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief miscalculated. He overestimated himself and underestimated the Debt Collector!*

The White Azure Venerable spat a pillar of fire, shaping it into a sword that shot forward.

The Debt Collector dodged calmly, then engaged the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief.

"My magic power never wanes, while yours depletes. With Senior Brother Gu gone, only four of you remain. Today..."

The Debt Collector smiled faintly. "I shall slay five Human Immortals in one fell swoop!"

The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief raised his palm, summoning a storm that formed the shapes of a dragon and tiger, roaring as they charged!

He clashed head-on with the Debt Collector, but his heart grew heavier.

In the past, he had sensed the Debt Collector’s power was on par with his own, making him seem unfathomable.

Even the Law Enforcement Hall’s Chief, at the True Qi stage, believed himself equal to the Debt Collector.

Now, the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief realized the Debt Collector was stronger than him, no longer shrouded in mystery. Thus, he had gathered multiple Human Immortals for this siege.

After returning from the underworld and obtaining the Dragon-Tiger Storm Refining Supreme Technique from Li Zhengjing, his power had grown further, increasing his confidence in killing the Debt Collector.

But he hadn’t expected the Debt Collector to be this powerful!

"In the end, I acted too hastily, underestimating the golden magma in this cave heaven, which grants the Debt Collector infinite magic power!"

The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief regretted his impulsiveness. *If we can’t destroy his body, how can we annihilate his indestructible soul?*

With a furious roar, he burned his life force, his hair turning gray in an instant as his power surged!

The Dao-Burning Benevolence Technique!

"You’d sacrifice your life for this?"

The Debt Collector raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "Even if you burn your vitality, what can you achieve?"

"The setting sun is infinitely beautiful, though dusk is near."

The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief murmured, "Let the twilight shine brightly, illuminating the world a little longer..."

His gaze was resolute—he would not retreat!

With no way out, the others fought desperately. The Formation Pavilion’s Master gritted his teeth, weaving formations in the air to suppress the battlefield.

The White Azure Venerable and Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official spat flames from opposite sides, no longer caring if they hit the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief—Elder Gu’s fate was a stark warning.

The battle raged on, but the Debt Collector showed no signs of weakening. Of the five Human Immortals, one had fallen, and the remaining four were exhausting their magic power.

"Li Zhengjing! Yuan Zhengfeng! Why aren’t you joining?"

The Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief bellowed, "If we lose, your fate will be no better!"

"Yuan Zhengfeng?"

The Debt Collector seemed momentarily surprised but didn’t stop his attacks. "Even if Yuan Zhengfeng lives, what of it? As for Li Zhengjing—a mere True Qi cultivator—are you sending him to his death?"

Earlier, the Debt Collector had held his own against five. Now, he dominated the battle!

His aura surged as he prepared to annihilate the four remaining Human Immortals.

But then, a streak of light shot up from below, forcing the Debt Collector to retreat.

Elder Gu, having taken three Life-Death Pills, mustered his last strength to unleash a devastating attack!

"Li Zhengjing! Yuan Zhengfeng! Join the fight now!" the Ancient Moon Peak’s Chief shouted. "His magic power is endless—we must strike together with overwhelming force to suppress him!"

"With just you?"

The Debt Collector pressed forward, suppressing the four Human Immortals, about to deliver a fatal blow to Elder Gu.

But suddenly, he grunted, his expression shifting as he retreated dozens of miles.

The four Human Immortals exchanged glances, stunned—for in that instant, the Debt Collector’s magic power had weakened!

The battlefield fell silent.

The Debt Collector’s gaze darkened as he looked toward the golden magma pool.

The four Human Immortals followed his gaze.

The golden magma, the accumulated spiritual energy of the Falling Dragon Cave Heaven for centuries, was completely drained, leaving only an empty valley!

"How... did he do that?"

The golden magma’s spiritual energy was vast—even the Debt Collector’s relentless attacks had consumed less than a third of it.

Yet Li Zhengjing had emptied it entirely?

Not even a Human Immortal could achieve such a feat!

But he had done it.

Now... the Debt Collector’s magic power was no longer infinite!

The battlefield froze.

In the empty valley, Li Zhengjing sat cross-legged, his magic power swirling with unparalleled sharpness.

He was using Yuan Zhengfeng’s magic power to forge the Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi!

But he knew his body couldn’t withstand the sword qi’s edge—even the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure couldn’t protect him.

So he didn’t refine the magic power inside his body into sword qi.

Instead, he channeled the magic power through his hundred acupoints, forging a hundred sword lights outside his body!

Once prepared, he stood, his gaze locking onto the Debt Collector as he soared into the sky.

"Let’s fight!"
