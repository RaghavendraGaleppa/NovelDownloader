# Chapter 44: Prearranged Selections

After waiting in line for a while, it was finally Qin Chong's turn.

The attendant disciple handed Qin Chong the Minor Teleportation Talisman, then picked up the map jade slip—but didn't immediately pass it over, instead waiting for Qin Chong to produce the spirit stones.

When Qin Chong took out three hundred spirit stones, the attendant said, "Fellow Daoist, we actually have two types of jade slips here. The standard version only contains a simple map, while the deluxe edition not only has precise mapping but also records information about spirit herbs, ores, and even marks the locations of powerful demonic beasts and dangerous areas."

Before he could finish speaking, Qin Chong's brow had already furrowed into a dark line. A torrent of curses ran through his mind—the Azure Dragon Valley's money-grubbing was truly shameless. Yet, he had no choice but to play along.

"Might I ask, fellow Daoist, how much does the deluxe edition cost?"

"Only five hundred spirit stones—an extremely reasonable price."

Without another word, Qin Chong silently took out another two hundred spirit stones and handed them over. Then he turned toward the secret realm's entrance, consoling himself inwardly: *The wind blows away the eggshell, wealth departs but peace remains.*

Before he had taken more than a few steps, he heard an unusual commotion behind him. Glancing back, he saw another cultivator in a different line who, lacking sufficient spirit stones, had resorted to offering a low-grade magical artifact to make up the difference. Not far away, someone else was bartering with materials to cover the cost.

Qin Chong couldn't help but think bitterly, *At least they didn’t charge for the Minor Teleportation Talisman—otherwise, there’d be an uproar.*

Looking ahead, the cultivators heading toward the secret realm's entrance no longer carried their earlier excitement. It seemed the Azure Dragon Valley’s blatant profiteering had dampened their spirits.

"Junior Qin, hold a moment."

Just as Qin Chong was about to move on, a voice called out to him—it was Meng Fei.

Suppressing a sigh, Qin Chong hurried over. "Greetings, Senior Meng."

Though seemingly a simple change in address, the nuance was significant. Among unfamiliar cultivators, higher-ranked individuals typically addressed their juniors as "Fellow Daoist"—a neutral and polite term. But "Junior" implied familiarity and goodwill, suggesting the senior viewed the younger cultivator favorably.

Meng Fei’s use of "Junior" indicated he considered Qin Chong an acquaintance.

"You must perform well in this secret realm trial. If you can secure a place in the inner sect, that previous matter won’t be an issue. Otherwise, even if I intervene, there may still be complications."

"Rest assured, Senior Meng. This junior will spare no effort to enter the inner sect."

"Excellent. Then I wish you good fortune."

"Many thanks, Senior. This junior takes his leave."

With that, Qin Chong turned and continued toward the secret realm entrance, though his mind was now clouded with questions. *What was Meng Fei really implying? Was he genuinely urging me to strive for the inner sect, or was this a veiled attempt to extort me? Or… has he placed a bet on my performance?*

Those few cryptic sentences left him utterly bewildered.

Beneath the massive glowing barrier was a semicircular passage about ten zhang wide. As Qin Chong stepped inside, he could faintly sense the oppressive aura radiating from the surrounding formations. Yet the pressure remained within tolerable limits for Qi Condensation cultivators—clearly, the Azure Dragon Valley’s elders had carefully calibrated it. Otherwise, the sheer force of the formation would have instantly crushed cultivators of this level.

Once inside the secret realm, Qin Chong pushed these thoughts aside—only to be startled anew by the scene before him.

Most of the cultivators who had entered earlier hadn’t dispersed. Instead, they had clustered near the entrance in small groups, deep in discussion. Those from the same families naturally gathered together to plan their next moves, while independent cultivators busily recruited teammates.

Within moments of Qin Chong’s arrival, several groups approached him with offers to join. He declined each one, watching as they moved on to recruit others. Then his eyes brightened with recognition—a familiar figure was walking ahead alone, also turning down invitations.

Once they had both moved beyond the crowd, Qin Chong quickened his pace to catch up.

"Old Zhao, planning to go solo, huh?"

The man—Zhao Yin—had sensed Qin Chong’s presence earlier but hadn’t acknowledged him. Now he smirked. "Heh. You little fox, you made it in too."

"How’d you even get here? I thought the age limit was sixty."

Zhao Yin puffed up proudly, utterly unbothered by the jab. "This old man is only fifty-seven. What’s the issue?"

"Fifty-seven? Could’ve fooled me—I’d have guessed over sixty."

"And you—your cultivation’s improved. Reached the sixth layer of Qi Condensation in just a few years."

"Nowhere near your level. You’re already at the ninth layer."

Zhao Yin sighed. "What’s the use of the ninth layer? If I don’t break through to Foundation Establishment, this is as far as I’ll go."

"So this is your last gamble? The top ten get Foundation Establishment Pills, right?"

Zhao Yin rolled his eyes. "Top ten? You’re dreaming. Word is those spots are prearranged. This old man will be content just securing an entry qualification—I’ll figure out how to get a Foundation Establishment Pill after joining."

"Prearranged? That’s dirty. Where’d you hear that?"

The revelation unsettled Qin Chong. He had been aiming for the top ten, but now he’d have to reconsider.

Zhao Yin chuckled. "You’re still too green. Every elder in the Azure Dragon Valley has family connections—you think they’d let such opportunities slip to outsiders?"

"The Azure Dragon Valley really is ruthless."

"Kid, you lack experience. Even without prearranged slots, those young masters from major families have more resources and intel than you. How could you compete?"

"Enough of that. Let’s team up—I’m aiming for the top fifty."

"Team up? No. This old man works alone."

"Old Zhao, are you looking down on me because my cultivation’s lower? Have you forgotten how I saved you last time?"

Qin Chong wasn’t ready to reveal his true strength, so he played the guilt card.

"You brat, always holding that over me. Can’t you come up with something new?"

"Doesn’t matter. You’re stuck with me, willing or not."

"You—!" Zhao Yin sputtered, exasperated by Qin Chong’s shamelessness.

"Relax, Old Zhao. You won’t regret partnering with me. And you know I’d never abandon you in danger."

Zhao Yin shot him a look that clearly said *Yeah, right.* But with Qin Chong clinging like a burr, he had no choice but to relent.
