# Chapter 5: The Demonic Cultivator  

This was a matter of life and death.  

In the Cloudmist Kingdom and throughout the Thirteen Kingdoms Alliance, the majority of the territory was under the control of orthodox sects. While heterodox and miscellaneous sects held some influence, demonic cultivators here were nothing more than rats scurrying in the streets—hated and hunted by all.  

Any demonic cultivator who dared to show their face would undoubtedly be exterminated in the name of righteousness.  

Just as Wang Chan was about to open his mouth to plead his innocence, the beauty mark-adorned woman stared coldly into his eyes and demanded, "Name? Where are you from? Where are you going?"  

*From whence I came, to where I shall go.*  

Wang Chan very much wanted to reply like this, but he knew such an answer would earn him a beating. So he answered honestly:  

"Wang Chan, a wandering cultivator from the wilderness. I came from Lotus Mountain and am heading to Little Tea Mountain to practice medicine."  

At the mention of Wang Chan's name, the woman's eyes flickered slightly before she asked, "You cultivate at Lotus Mountain?"  

"Indeed."  

"Is Fellow Daoist Tie Zhan from Cave Residence No. 70 still living there?"  

"You must be mistaken. Fellow Daoist Tie resides in Cave No. 97," Wang Chan replied calmly. "Cave No. 70 belongs to Fellow Daoist Chen."  

"Oh? You know Fellow Daoist Chen?" The woman raised an eyebrow, her fingers hidden in her sleeves twitching slightly.  

"We exchanged greetings just half an hour ago," Wang Chan answered without a change in expression.  

The woman fell silent for a few breaths before nodding. "You may go."  

Relieved, Wang Chan nearly bolted on the spot.  

But he forced himself to remain composed. First, he cupped his hands in a respectful gesture, then turned unhurriedly and walked away with measured steps.  

As they watched Wang Chan disappear beyond the mountain, the square-faced man couldn't help but speak up, "Boss..."  

The woman said firmly, "If he met Fellow Daoist Chen half an hour ago and is still standing here unharmed, then he obviously isn't the demonic cultivator Li Yuan."  

"But what if he's lying—" The square-faced man was about to argue when another female guard cut in, "Don't forget, the boss's companion is the Autumn Wind Cicada."  

The square-faced man immediately shut his mouth.  

Heterodox cultivators' companions were bizarre and varied, each with unique abilities. He suddenly remembered that the boss's Autumn Wind Cicada excelled at *scent detection*—it must have picked up Fellow Daoist Chen's aura on that man.  

Recalling Fellow Daoist Chen's methods... the square-faced man instinctively shrank his neck.  

---  

Little Tea Mountain was blanketed with camellias—red, white, yellow, blue... everything but green.  

Wang Chan hurried along the mountain path until he reached Cave Residence No. 38. The courtyard gate was closed, and there was no movement inside.  

*Has Madam Cheng not woken up yet? The sun's already scorching enough to roast one's backside...*  

Before him, a simple protective formation cast a pinkish glow over the courtyard. Through the shoulder-high fence, he could see butterflies flitting wildly among the flowers and plants, which reminded him of Madam Cheng's alluring demeanor from two days prior.  

Standing at her doorstep now, how was he any different from those lustful butterflies?  

With this thought, he raised his hand to knock but froze mid-motion.  

An internal battle raged in his mind.  

*Should I go in or not?*  

*Play hard to get or outright refuse?*  

His thoughts grew increasingly absurd until he pinched his own thigh hard, gritting his teeth as he scolded himself:  

*Wang Chan, you're no longer the aimless wandering cultivator you once were! Don't wallow in self-indulgence! Remember—women hinder cultivation! Especially one you've only met twice. What if she's entangled in some major trouble?*  

*Focus on cultivation. Once you grow stronger, won't immortal maidens, enchantresses, and ghostly beauties be yours for the picking?*  

*So even if you're burning with desire later, you must hold the line—at most, feast your eyes, but no touching! Remember this!*  

After a long moment, Wang Chan took a deep breath and resolutely knocked on the door.  

*Bang!*  

*Bang! Bang!*  

"Is Fellow Daoist Cheng home?" he called out.  

No response.  

He repeated the process.  

Still no answer.  

"Stop knocking. Fellow Daoist Cheng left at noon yesterday and hasn't returned yet," came a voice from the neighboring Cave No. 39. A stout, dark-skinned female cultivator stood at her gate like a door god.  

Wang Chan turned toward the voice, about to respond, when he heard an anxious voice from inside her courtyard:  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Cheng hasn't returned? Could something have happened to her...?"  

"You rotten old man! Last month, when I was out searching for Moonlight Grass for three days and nights, you didn't show an ounce of concern when I got back—"  

"Ah—"  

Listening to the bickering couple next door, Wang Chan first chuckled, then laughed at himself. All that internal drama, and she wasn't even home.  

After a moment's thought, he took out a blank talisman paper, wrote a brief message, and slipped it through the door crack before leaving.  

Since Madam Cheng was well enough to go out, any further treatment was probably unnecessary. At least he'd made the trip—he hadn't broken his promise.  

He could always make up for it with a health regimen later.  

With his afternoon suddenly free, Wang Chan considered heading straight to the Black River Market to set up his medical stall. But the journey was long, and if he ended up delayed by patients, he might have to travel at night—far too dangerous.  

He decided to return home instead and set out early the next morning.  

For some reason, the same path always felt shorter on the way back.  

Before long, Wang Chan reached the spot where the beauty-marked guard had stopped him earlier. A turn along the mountain path led to a small valley with a clear spirit spring—perfect for fetching some water.  

But as he rounded the bend into the valley, his eyes widened.  

At the center of the valley, a ten-foot-wide phantom peach blossom spun rapidly, radiating an eerie, sinister aura. Strangely, despite the violent spiritual energy it contained, not a single ripple of disturbance could be sensed.  

And within that phantom blossom—  

A woman of above-average beauty, her face now as radiant as a blooming peach blossom, was engaged in... *activities* unsuitable for young audiences.  

Four words flashed through Wang Chan's mind: *Old Tree Coiling Roots!*  

That woman was none other than Madam Cheng.  

At this moment, she wore no covering.  

Familiar sights flickered in and out of view.  

But what was even more bizarre—  

Beneath the phantom blossom lay a ghostly figure with a green face and fangs, writhing on the ground in agony.  

Dark energy swirled around it, stirring gusts of yin wind, yet the phantom blossom seemed to suppress it completely—not a single breeze escaped.  

Upon closer inspection, the ghostly figure concealed a man in green robes. In terms of appearance, he was only slightly less handsome than Wang Chan himself. Were it not for his gloomy demeanor, his aura might have even resembled Wang Chan's by two or three parts.  

But in terms of cultivation—this man far surpassed him, boasting over sixty strands of spiritual power!  

*Could this be... the demonic cultivator Li Yuan?!*  

Yet the very demonic cultivator the beauty-marked guard was hunting now appeared to be suffering under Madam Cheng's torment.  

*Holy shit! Madam Cheng is a demonic cultivator too!*
