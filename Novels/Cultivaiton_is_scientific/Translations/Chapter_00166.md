# Chapter 166: False Nascent Soul

Elder Ren's arrival had been sudden, and his departure just as abrupt. After that, there was no further news.

Li Shiming's communication token couldn't reach Ren Fei'er either. He felt a pang of regret at not being able to bid her farewell.

He was bound for Northern Shu, and given the distance between there and here, it was unlikely they would ever meet again.

Six months passed without any word from the Northern Sea Trading Company. However, Li Shiming successfully broke through to the ninth level of Qi Refining.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Sea Sect was no longer peaceful. After all this time, many factions within the sect had learned of the impending invasion by Northern Shu cultivators.

If not for the presence of several Golden Core elders maintaining order, the sect would have collapsed long before the Northern Sea cultivators arrived.

Li Shiming witnessed firsthand how a cultivation sect operated under such circumstances. Contrary to his expectations of a united defense to protect their home, the sect's first choice when facing an overwhelmingly powerful enemy was to flee—even though they had occupied their current territory for ten thousand years.

Almost no faction considered defecting to the Northern Shu cultivators. This was due to certain unspoken rules of the cultivation world.

Cultivation sects wouldn't accept disciples of unknown background or those with existing grudges. Even if secular territories of the seven sects were occupied, they would only consider recruiting disciples from those areas after several generations had passed.

For a sect, the concept of time differed vastly from that of mortals. 

A mortal's lifespan typically spanned mere decades, while a Golden Core cultivator could live up to five hundred years. To them, thirty years in the mortal world constituted a generation. Four generations amounted to only a hundred and twenty years—enough time to erase all traces of the seven sects from secular memory, leaving only the imprint of the Clear Heart Sect.

Beyond the Seven Stars Islands in the outer sea, ten massive flying boats now faced the islands, accompanied by eighteen Golden Core cultivators.

The Golden Core elders of the seven sects on the islands remained silent. Although their combined numbers exceeded those of the Clear Heart Sect of Northern Shu, they were well aware of the disparity in combat power between their forces.

A seemingly ordinary but exceptionally fast flying boat approached from behind the ten massive vessels.

The cultivators aboard the giant flying boats erupted in cheers, shouting "Ancestor" in unison.

Elder Yin examined the scanning information from the Big Dipper Formation and realized the seven sects had already lost—completely and utterly.

Though no battle had been fought, the seven sects had forfeited their ten-thousand-year foundation.

The spiritual energy fluctuations detected by the Big Dipper Formation exceeded its maximum design capacity.

When the formation was created, no one had anticipated needing to account for a Nascent Soul cultivator.

A False Nascent Soul might not be a true Nascent Soul, but it still qualified as Nascent Soul-level combat power. In Northern Shu, this was considered top-tier strength. In the Heavenly Sea Islands region ruled by the seven sects, such power was simply invincible.

The flying boat halted five miles from the Seven Stars Islands. A massive, illusory figure of an elderly man appeared.

"You have six hours to leave," the towering figure declared, its voice resonating across heaven and earth. "After six hours, any cultivator remaining within the seven sects' territories will be exterminated!"

The colossal figure raised its hand and lightly pressed down toward the Seven Stars Islands.

The Big Dipper Formation—reputed to withstand a full-force strike from a late-stage Golden Core cultivator—was forcibly breached by this casual gesture.

Fortunately, the giant figure showed no intent to harm anyone. Once the formation was broken, it withdrew its hand.

"Nascent Soul Dharma Idol!" Elder Yin gasped softly, feeling his Golden Core grow sluggish within him.

The other Golden Core elders shared his reaction. The legendary Nascent Soul-stage divine ability—the Nascent Soul Dharma Idol—possessed world-shattering power.

Though descriptions of Nascent Soul cultivators existed in many records, facing the oppressive aura of one firsthand, along with the overwhelming sense of battling heaven and earth itself, extinguished any last shred of hope in the Golden Core elders' hearts.

Without further discussion, all cultivators on the Seven Stars Islands flew toward the rear, each returning to their respective sects.

No additional conversation was needed. This had been discussed beforehand. After experiencing the terror of a Nascent Soul Dharma Idol firsthand, even the most stubborn holdouts abandoned their resistance.

Ancestor Zang retracted his Nascent Soul Dharma Idol, watching the seven sects' cultivators depart with utter indifference, as though swatting away a swarm of insects.

But inwardly, he knew better. Despite his outward calm, he had sustained significant injuries during his confrontation with the Netherworld Sect.

He had no intention of fighting the seven sects to the death. The cultivators transferred from the Clear Heart Sect were carefully selected elites, and he didn't want to risk further losses among them.

By not exerting himself fully, he could continue protecting the Clear Heart Sect for some time. If he went all out, his already limited lifespan would shorten even further.

Outsiders might view Ancestor Zang as being close to a true Nascent Soul, but he knew the truth. While his combat power had reached Nascent Soul level, his physical body remained little different from a Golden Core peak cultivator's.

Consequently, his lifespan matched that of a Golden Core peak cultivator, with no hope of further advancement.

This was the price of forcibly attaining False Nascent Soul status through special secret techniques—sacrificing all future potential for present power.

No one in the Clear Heart Sect dared oppose Ancestor Zang's decisions. He was the sect's pillar.

Li Shiming was engrossed in research when he noticed multiple alerts appearing on the program-controlled switchboard of his "Thousand-Mile Vision II" system.

Though he appeared detached from sect affairs, few knew he remained well-informed about many matters.

After the incident where the Holy Ice Sect conspired with internal factions to target him, he had used the rollout of "Thousand-Mile Vision" and its successor to monitor all communications through the system.

Normally, he ignored routine messages, focusing only on those triggering specific keywords that warranted his attention.

Approaching the switchboard to investigate the alerts, his expression immediately changed.

The messages all concerned evacuation—the entire Heavenly Sea Sect was pulling out, with all cultivators receiving notifications.

Yet he hadn't received any message, as if he alone had been forgotten.

Checking his identity jade tablet, he quickly identified the problem: it couldn't connect to the sect's grand formation—an unprecedented occurrence.

As a formation master, his identity jade tablet held special privileges granting greater access than ordinary disciples'. Only a Golden Core elder could block his connection.

"Did a Golden Core elder target me?" he wondered before dismissing the thought. 

Any Golden Core elder would consider his status as both a sect disciple and formation master, not to mention Elder Yin's influence. If they wanted to deal with him, they wouldn't resort to such methods—a casual slap would suffice.

"If not an elder, then who? Which faction?" His mind raced until a possibility emerged.

Regarding sect formation permissions, the highest authority didn't lie with Golden Core elders but with the two remaining senior formation masters.

Master Song's image surfaced in Li Shiming's mind—the man had occasionally revealed subtle hostility. This explained the jade tablet's blockage.

He didn't understand Master Song's motives, but the consequence was clear: this move placed him in mortal danger.

Initially, he hadn't paid much attention to the switchboard alerts, typically reviewing them during downtime. Given his status in the sect, major events usually prompted official notifications.

This delay cost him the chance to evacuate with the sect immediately.

By the time Ancestor Zang issued his ultimatum and elders like Yin returned to the sect, considerable time had passed.

Evacuating an entire sect, even with preparations, required more than a few hours.

When Elder Yin and the other Golden Core elders led the evacuation, they only then noticed Li Shiming's absence.

Attempting to contact him via identity jade tablet, Elder Yin found it impossible—likely because Li Shiming had traveled beyond the thousand-mile sect range.

It never occurred to him that the jade tablet might have been disabled.

Though evacuating, the sect hadn't vanished entirely—the grand formation remained partially active.

Shaking his head, Elder Yin decided to contact Li Shiming later. Outside sect territory, the clever youth should remain safe.

The evacuation couldn't wait—moving so many cultivators required time.

Ancestor Zang's deadline was carefully calculated to prevent the sects from dismantling too many facilities before leaving.

"Move out!" Elder Yin commanded reluctantly, casting a final glance at the sect's nine peaks.

Over five thousand cultivators rose into the air—some aboard massive flying boats, others on smaller vessels or using various flight methods. The Heavenly Sea Sect abandoned no one.

At least while sect resources lasted, mass defections wouldn't occur.

It was a spectacular sight: five thousand cultivators departing en masse, aided by Golden Core elders to accelerate their flight.

When Li Shiming finally took to the skies and looked toward the nine peaks, they stood empty—even the perpetually active grand formation had been deactivated upon departure.

His gaze shifted toward distant giant flying boats approaching the sect's location.

He doubted his sword escape technique could ensure safe passage now, especially with a Golden Core enemy among the Northern Shu forces.

Nor did he wish to rejoin the evacuation. Even if he caught up, not knowing whether Master Song or other high-ranking figures opposed him made rejoining dangerous.

With the sect's protection gone, his enemy—Elder Baili of the Holy Ice Sect—would surely seize the opportunity to strike.

He chuckled wryly. For a mere ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator to have Golden Core-level enemies on both sides was... impressive.

"Good thing I prepared a backup plan," Li Shiming murmured in relief.

Indeed, he hadn't pinned all his hopes on the sect or the Northern Sea Trading Company for his journey to Northern Shu.

Returning to Eagle Beak Island, he first collected everything portable from the underground facility into his spatial ring—fortunately spacious enough for all his equipment.

These devices represented years of work, restoring much of his previous life's technological capabilities.

Only through the Heavenly Sea Sect's resources and massive material acquisitions via "Thousand-Mile Vision" had this been possible.

Outside the sect, obtaining such quantities would prove difficult.

Though he possessed millions of spirit stones, without sect protection, attempting large purchases would draw dangerous attention from major powers.

A mere ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator couldn't withstand such scrutiny.

He harvested as many spirit fish from the spring as possible—this might be his last chance.

Preparations complete, he returned to the surface to finalize his plans.

Meanwhile, Ancestor Zang led the Clear Heart Sect toward the Heavenly Sea Sect first.

Its central location among the seven sects made it ideal as a base for coordinating takeover of the others.

Any issues could be addressed promptly from this strategic position.

During their standoff at the Seven Stars Islands, the Clear Heart Sect had gathered considerable intelligence on the seven sects.

As the giant flying boat advanced slowly, Ancestor Zang monitored the time. He would honor the agreement by waiting until the deadline expired before entering the nine peaks.

En route, they ignored smaller islands—unnecessary targets with the main sect evacuated. Mortals remaining there still constituted resources.

Any lingering cultivators would be dealt with after securing the nine peaks.

Thus, Eagle Beak Island—despite its activated mountain-protection formation and proximity to the route—attracted little attention.

The Clear Heart Sect possessed maps of the Heavenly Sea Sect's spiritual vein distribution. Only islands with abundant spiritual energy warranted notice.

Eagle Beak Island's inferior spiritual vein meant future inspections would involve only Qi Refining cultivators—unworthy of deploying Foundation Establishment experts.

This bought Li Shiming precious time to execute his plan and secure favorable conditions for departure.
