## The Twelve Hammers of Calming the Wind and Waves, Ying Bing's Terrifying Progress

"Last time, the Six-Pattern Cleansing Heart Pill I invested in for Brother Murong was roughly equivalent in value to a high-grade martial art. But this time, the reward is the Ancient Bronze Celestial Tome Seal. Is a permanent solution better than solving an immediate crisis?" Li Mo pondered, rubbing the small bronze seal in his palm.

He began searching on the fifth floor again. High-grade martial arts were already scarce here, and hammer techniques were even rarer. But half an hour later, he actually found something.

"The Twelve Hammers of Calming the Wind and Waves." Li Mo brushed off the thick dust from the manual, revealing its name.

It was a high-grade martial art, specifically a short-handled hammer technique. It consisted of twelve forms, and upon achieving grand completion, a single strike could shake the earth and mountains. "Hmm... If I reach the perfected realm and my cultivation is sufficient, could it match the power of Master's single punch?" Li Mo glanced at the missing chunk of Divine Weapon Peak, pondering inwardly.

He continued flipping through. Then he discovered... "This martial art is only two-thirds complete?" The technique abruptly ended at the eighth form. Little Li fell into deep thought. A moment later, he still picked up the manual and headed downstairs. Mainly, he had no other options at the moment. He could only take it back first and then figure something out later.

Upon reaching the first floor, it was still the same inner sect deacon. "Junior Brother Li, have you made your choice?"

"Yes, please trouble Senior Brother to record it for me." Li Mo handed over the manual.

"Uh... hmm?" The inner sect deacon took the manual, and just as he picked up his brush to record it, he paused, seeing the name of the martial art: "Junior Brother Li, this is a hammer technique." He carefully glanced at the longsword on Little Li's waist.

It was well-known throughout the sect that this true disciple, Li, had obtained the Chixiao Sword, a blade as famous as the Skyfrost Sword, from the Divine Blade Cave. Therefore, many, including the deacon, believed that even if he wasn't as terrifying as Junior Sister Ying Bing, he was definitely a 'sword dao prodigy' by their common understanding. After all, Ying Bing was too frightening; with a mere wave of her hand, famous swords would appear in the air, queuing up to acknowledge her as their master – this was already beyond the scope of their comprehension. In contrast, Junior Brother Li, who passed the Chixiao Sword's trial through his swordsmanship prowess, was the image of a genius they envisioned. A sword dao genius choosing a hammer technique?

"I didn't choose wrong," Li Mo shook his head. "The stones of another mountain can be used to polish one's own jade. I already have swordsmanship; by studying other martial arts, I might gain new insights."

The stones of another mountain can polish one's own jade? This 'polishing' seemed a bit too far-fetched... "Although this martial art is incomplete, it still consumes one opportunity. Junior Brother Li, please think it over carefully," the inner sect deacon reminded him again.

"Yes, I've already considered it."

"Alright then. Please return the martial art within one month, Junior Brother Li, and strictly avoid spreading it to outsiders." Seeing that he had no intention of changing his mind, the inner sect deacon said no more.

Meanwhile, at the Sword Dao Arena on Clear Abyss Main Peak. Ying Bing, holding a sword, stepped over the threshold. Her plain-colored dress was as cool and unadorned as the longsword cradled in her arms. As soon as she entered the Sword Dao Arena, several gazes, as if looking at a precious treasure, fell upon her.

"After more than four hundred years, the Skyfrost Sword has found its master once again. It truly complements her," Qian Bufan marveled, clicking his tongue.

Xue Jing, looking travel-worn as if he had just returned from outside the mountains, had an unshakeable smile on his face: "The last time a Profound Weapon acknowledged a master in the sect was fifty years ago. This time, two Profound Weapons have acknowledged masters simultaneously, and what's more, they are both swords—Skyfrost and Chixiao. Rare, truly rare indeed."

"Alright, Cold Crane, don't look so glum. Profound Weapons are stored in the Divine Blade Cave for people to use, aren't they? Besides, a treasured sword finds its hero; they've both met worthy masters." Elder Cold Crane had remained silent since entering the Sword Dao Arena. Everyone had assumed he looked conflicted because he was reluctant to part with the Profound Weapons.

"You've all said your praises. This old man isn't eloquent and is too lazy to add any more pretty words," Cold Crane grumbled, shooting Xue Jing an annoyed look. *The very 'Divine Weapons' that gave Divine Weapon Peak its name have been taken away!*

"Alright, let us old fellows feast our eyes as well," Shangguan Wencang said softly. "Just what kind of astonishing talent can make Profound Weapons flock to them?"

"Good." Ying Bing nodded. A burst of sword light suddenly illuminated the entire hall. A breeze, originating from an unknown place, scattered the pear blossoms surrounding the Sword Dao Arena. Everyone instinctively squinted their eyes. For as the sword danced, individual petals, without any discernible wind, began to move on their own. Sometimes they dispersed, other times they gathered.
