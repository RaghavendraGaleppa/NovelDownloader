#66, Farewell

Before Li Zhiming, a refined and elegant woman, Jiang Yun, bowed deeply. Her slender wrists were adorned with a red thread, and she held a letter sealed with hot wax, which she handed to Li Zhiming.

Jiang Yun, now nineteen years old, had blossomed into a breathtaking beauty. As a result, she had become a stunning sight within the Medicine Valley. The mostly male disciples of the Seven Mystic Gate sect would often crane their necks, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. In the past year, the valley had been abuzz with excitement, and Jiang Yun had eventually taken to wearing a veil to conceal her face.

Some overzealous disciples had even gone so far as to feign illness, just to catch a glimpse of her. However, their enthusiasm was short-lived, as Meng Weizhi, the sect's leader, had personally intervened, putting an end to their antics.

Li Zhiming's expression changed as he accepted the letter, carefully examining the wax seal and holding it up to the sunlight to verify its authenticity. Satisfied, he opened the letter and quickly scanned its contents.

"Where is Han Li?" Li Zhiming asked.

"Practicing martial arts on the mountain," came the response.

"Tell him to come down," Li Zhiming instructed.

As Li Zhiming waited, the bright sunlight seemed to fade, and he retreated to his study, hands clasped behind his back. He sat down at his desk, where the warm sunlight cast a golden glow on the old, red wood.

The letter from Lan Zhou was unusual, and its contents were straightforward. An agent embedded in Lan Zhou had reported that someone was spreading rumors that Mo Dafu, Li Zhiming's master, had passed away. Furthermore, a supposed disciple of Mo Dafu had appeared, claiming to be his true heir and bearing a letter supposedly written by Mo Dafu himself. This individual was now demanding to marry a daughter of the Mo family.

Li Zhiming's eyes narrowed as he pondered the implications. The fact that the letter had been sent to him suggested that his master's wife was under significant pressure and was struggling to cope.

It seemed that Han Li would have to be the one to make a trip to Lan Zhou.

Li Zhiming sighed, his thoughts consumed by the weight of the task ahead. He had been keeping Han Li by his side, intending to allow the young man to mature before sending him out into the world. However, it seemed that time was running out.

Han Li was only fourteen years old.

As Li Zhiming paced around his study, his concerns deepened. He considered requesting Meng Weizhi to send some experienced individuals to accompany Han Li on his journey, given the complexity of the situation in Lan Zhou.

However, he also knew that Han Li was no ordinary person. With his unique destiny and innate abilities, he might just be able to navigate the challenges ahead.

Li Zhiming's thoughts were filled with a mix of emotions as he contemplated the impending departure of his young friend. He was not only concerned about Han Li's ability to handle the situation but also about the fact that he would be left alone in the valley once again.

Moreover, Li Zhiming was aware that Han Li's destiny was not something he could easily replicate. The young man's innate talent and abilities made him a rare individual, and Li Zhiming couldn't help but feel a sense of despair at the thought of not being able to follow in his footsteps.

As Li Zhiming stood lost in thought, a voice behind him broke the silence. "You called for me?"

Li Zhiming turned to see Han Li, dressed in indigo clothing, his hair tied back. He looked more mature, but his overall appearance remained unchanged.

"Han Li, something has happened back at our sect," Li Zhiming said, his voice low, as he handed Han Li the letter.

Han Li's expression turned serious as he read the letter. When he finished, he looked up at Li Zhiming. "What do you mean?"

"You need to go back to Lan Zhou," Li Zhiming explained, outlining the situation and the potential consequences of not taking action. "If you return as Mo Dafu's disciple, it will give us some leverage to deal with the impostor and potentially stabilize the situation."

Han Li nodded, his expression thoughtful, and then asked, "And what about you?"

Li Zhiming's eyes remained fixed on Han Li, his thoughts consumed by the uncertainty of the future and the weight of the task ahead.
