# Chapter 181: Contending the Dao

Qin Ming stood at the entrance, overwhelmed by a sense of grandeur. It was hard to believe; at the end of the main hall, a glowing path actually led into the night sky.

A woman in white, her dark hair swaying with the night breeze, walked out from within a bright moon. She was ethereal and indistinct, as if descending from the nine heavens.

*Such a person can exist?* Qin Ming didn't believe it.

Because Granny Wu Yaozu had told him that the most powerful old seniors who took the "Rainbow Transformation" route in the Fourth Desolate Land had never returned after flying to the moon.

How could this woman reside on the moon?

Moreover, she descended with such ease, treading a small path as if strolling in a leisurely garden, bathed in moonlight!

"Illusions of the mirror and moon, Hmph!" Qin Ming imitated Lu Zizai from their first meeting, his tongue spitting lightning with crackling sounds, electric light interweaving. His body also unleashed supreme Yang energy.

However, nothing happened. On the small path at the end of the main hall, the woman remained shrouded in brilliant light, approaching unhurriedly.

The main hall was silent.

From a distance, the woman in white was ethereal and transcendent, truly possessing peerless grace.

As she drew closer, her figure appeared tall, and the curves beneath her white robes were faintly visible. Her hair exuded a faint luster; everything seemed perfect.

Yet, her face was inexplicably... unseen. Her dark hair obscured it, and as she approached, it not only ruined her earlier otherworldly beauty but also created an eerie sensation.

This easily brought to mind a white-clad female ghost emerging from the night mist.

Qin Ming’s expression grew solemn.

He stepped into the grand hall, then nearly stumbled to the ground, suppressed by a force as heavy as a mountain, almost unable to bear it.

The source of the pressure was the glowing wall in the hall, where scriptures were carved!

One of the patriarchs of the Silk Scripture Art, the old man who had once visited this place, had left behind sutras where every character was like a shining mountain, oppressing one to the point of breathlessness.

Even a body as radiant as Qin Ming's, like a scorching sun, showed signs of collapse.

Yet, he struggled to look up, staring at that wall, wanting to engrave every word into his mind. Even though his body could no longer endure, he continued to gaze.

"That old scoundrel, defacing this place with his scrawls," the woman in white murmured, gently waving her hand. A great white mist permeated the area, obscuring the wall until nothing could be seen.

The pressure on Qin Ming vanished, but he felt no joy. He spoke, "Senior, I wish to read the words on that wall."

"You came for this scripture," the woman in white said.

"Yes!" Qin Ming nodded. In front of a being of such a level, honesty was probably the best policy.

"If you wish to gain something here, that’s fine, but it depends on your limit, what level you can reach," the woman in white said, her voice soft and her temper seemingly good, emitting no uncomfortable pressure.

However, Qin Ming's heart tightened. If she were truly so amiable, so many people wouldn’t have entered and never returned.

"In the past, a hundred schools contended, dozens, even hundreds, of paths advanced concurrently. However, many were mere empty talk. How many remain today?" The woman in white's voice remained gentle.

She paused slightly, then said, "I no longer enjoy theorizing about the Dao. I prefer to see actual 'Dao Contention.' That is why this temple now has many failures."

A chill ran down Qin Ming's spine. If she personally entered the fray, how could he "contend"? He hadn't realized the danger was so high!

"Among the Newborns who came here, who is the strongest?" the woman in white asked.

A phantom figure suddenly appeared, bowing and replying, "The old man who inscribed words and left scriptures on the wall."

The woman in white stood at the end of the hall and said, "He doesn't count. The person didn't remain, and the consciousness didn't fully form, so he cannot be pulled out for a fight."

She then turned to look at a spider web in the hall and said, "Little Spider, you have listened to others discuss the Dao here for hundreds of years. Your cultivation is not shallow. Go and spar with him."

Next, she looked at the base of a wall, where there was a deep footprint in the ground, containing a puddle of pulpy substance.

She pointed a finger, and a pure white light flew out, instantly pulling a black spider from the footprint.

Qin Ming was horrified. The spider's true form was suspected to be as large as a mountain, yet it had been so easily crushed to death in the past?

"Little Spider walks the Divine Path," the confused black spider replied. It was merely a wisp of obsession, having died many years ago.

"I haven't restricted what kind of path you walk, as long as you are in the First Realm," the woman in white said.

Then, the black spider grew against the wind until it was the size of a millstone, radiating a lustrous dark gold and overflowing with divine wisdom, as if draped in a sacred armor.

Qin Ming’s expression was solemn. This was the test of the Divine Temple's main hall, an unprecedentedly dangerous place. Few past sages who came here ever left alive.

He took it extremely seriously, elevating his Heavenly Radiance Energy to its limit, almost burning, like a true sun rising and illuminating the place.

He naturally had to go all out!

In front, where the black spider was, a thick mist permeated, with wisps of silver threads interweaving. These were not tangible spider webs, but its divine wisdom expanding.

In an instant, Qin Ming felt his head slightly dizzy. *Had the attack already begun? It targeted the spiritual domain!*

However, this was only temporary discomfort. In a flash, flames erupted from his body, and the opponent's spiritual threads, like tangible objects, were actually ignited.

Qin Ming highly respected his opponent. In this place, he dared not hold back even a shred of his power. This time, his Heavenly Radiance Energy, now fully integrated and unified, erupted completely.

"Boom!"

Like a mountain collapsing and a tsunami raging, he was like a Golden Crow streaking across the sky, illuminating the entire hall. Without the restraints of a physical body, he was faster in this state, and his Heavenly Radiance could even take on forms.

In Qin Ming's hand, a golden Overlord's Spear appeared.

The large black spider was shocked. Its layers of spiritual ripples were directly incinerated by the golden light radiating from Qin Ming's body, utterly unable to block it.

Its divine wisdom immediately formed a spider web, covering forward.

Alas, it was still useless. The network in the divine path domain was scorched by the blazing sun that streaked across, quickly shattering, collapsing, and turning completely into ashes.

Qin Ming gripped the Overlord's Spear with both hands and chopped down.

The large black spider had nowhere to evade, nowhere to hide, because this was an unprecedented Heavenly Radiance Energy, capable of soul travel, as fast as the light of consciousness.

It could only endure it, its eight spider legs dancing, each clutching a Vajra Scepter, a treasure vase, a lightning hammer, etc., all smashing forward together.

In an instant, thunder and fire surged, lightning flashed and thunder roared, and divine wisdom splattered.

In a blink of an eye, the large spider became a pulpy mass again, returning to that footprint.

Because Qin Ming had swiftly split it in two with his Overlord's Spear.

The woman in white nodded and said, "Hmm, not bad. Little Spider is merely the 'threshold' of this place. Only by passing it do you qualify to spar with others and test your own limits."

Qin Ming remained silent. He felt that this woman, despite her ethereal and transcendent appearance and gentle words, seemed quite deceptive. How many opponents did she intend to arrange for him?

He couldn't help but ask, "Senior, how many people do I need to spar with?"

He was frank, directly stating the purpose of his visit to the Divine Temple: first, to find the lost scriptures of his lineage, and second, to seek a five-colored bottle.

The woman in white said, "If you perform exceptionally, one battle will suffice. But if you're just so-so, you'll have to fight a few more."

With a wave of her hand, she summoned a young man from the dried bloodstains on the ground. He was quite handsome, and the moment he appeared, pure Yang consciousness spiritual light flowed within him.

Qin Ming revealed a look of astonishment. The very first realm already had pure Yang consciousness spiritual light? This was too outrageous!

He immediately spoke, "I don't think anyone among the strongest orthodoxies in the Outer Realm could display such a feat in the First Realm."

"Haven't you heard of the Pure Yang Body?" the woman smiled.

Qin Ming said, "A Pure Yang Body merely facilitates cultivation, allowing a small amount of pure Yang consciousness spiritual light to emerge prematurely. If one truly achieves complete pure Yang transformation, they are already an esteemed senior."

He looked at the young man, his expression grave. This should be an old senior.

"I am not from this path. Hmm, is that so?" the woman asked the young man.

"Yes! You personally killed me back then," the young man replied.

Qin Ming felt that this Divine Temple master was indeed very deceptive.

If that was the case, could he even leave alive?

However, he still chose to believe Granny Wu Yaozu.

The woman in white said calmly, "That's because you were dross. Everything you learned was too stale, utterly useless for pioneering new paths. It's better to conserve resources and make way for the youth."

With a wave of her hand, the young man reverted to a puddle of dried blood on the ground.

She looked at Qin Ming and said, "Your Heavenly Radiance Energy, when separated from your body, can already initially take on forms, akin to external sacred techniques. This is a bit beyond the scope. How about this: I'll bring your physical body over, and I'll personally create a human form to battle your true body using the techniques of your path."

Qin Ming suspected she was about to enter the fray herself!

The main Divine Temple, dark and massive like a mountain within the night mist, was truly magnificent.

The beings in the peculiar town couldn't see through the thick fog, only vaguely discerning a light gradually brightening there, with misty light swirling, creating a somewhat wondrous sight.

Just then, people were astonished to discover that a physical body, wrapped in misty light, streaked across the sky from a dilapidated courtyard at the other end of the town, entering the Divine Temple.

Many extended their consciousness spiritual light and divine wisdom, wanting to see the true appearance of that body. However, they were repelled by the misty light, each grunting in pain as if their sea of consciousness had been struck by a hammer, agonizingly so.

"I told you, he's not someone from the Newborn path. See? He ultimately used his consciousness spiritual light to move his true body over to participate in the battle."

Some firmly believed that he was a powerful figure from the Outer Realm!

Someone retorted, "Wrong, that's clearly a technique of our Esoteric Sect for guiding physical bodies."

"Perhaps you are all wrong. He has already been utterly defeated and is about to be completely obliterated. It's the Divine Temple Master who locked his true body over there." Others held this view, believing that Li Wanqiu would not emerge.

Inside the Divine Temple's main hall, Qin Ming returned to his physical body, feeling better than ever before. Earlier, when he used Heavenly Radiance, it flowed smoothly but felt like rootless duckweed.

Now, with his feet on the ground, he felt as if he had merged with the entire world, conforming to the pulsations of heaven and earth, imbued with a sense of Dao following nature.

"Hmm, it seems you are indeed extraordinary," the woman in white praised sincerely for the first time, then added, "You possess a fraction of my demeanor from back then."

Qin Ming suspected, *Is this truly an old senior? Her mindset just doesn't seem like it!*

"How many times have you been reborn, anomalous one?" the woman in white asked, shaping a body from thin air, with flecks of white light passing into it.

"Seven times reborn," Qin Ming truthfully stated.

"Alright, she is also in the state of seven rebirths," the woman in white said with a smile, beckoning.

Not far away, a figure approached, with a head full of white hair, a thin, withered body, and a slight hunchback. It was an old hag.

When Qin Ming saw her, his whole demeanor changed. *It's that old woman from the Cui family. She didn't get shattered to pieces?*

The woman in white said, "Hmm, she's a dead person. I patched up her remains, and she still retains some obsessions. Alright, you two spar."

The old hag's eyes were initially dull, but as her obsession grew stronger, she actually recognized Qin Ming and immediately began gnashing her teeth.

Then, she understood her situation and state. Many insights and profound methods, which she never had on the Newborn path before, appeared in her mind.

"Hmph, Divine Temple, though I've never heard of it, I can feel all sorts of obsessions and resentments here. None of them can leave, and you'll stay here too, becoming a dead person, never returning to the outside world!" The old hag, appearing deranged, charged forward.

Qin Ming activated the *River Labyrinth Sutra*, and water mist immediately permeated the area. Then he unleashed his Thunderfire Energy. With a thunderous boom, a bolt of lightning struck, making the old hag's white hair stand on end.

It had to be said, the woman in white was incredibly mysterious. She temporarily raised the old hag's innate potential to a terrifying degree. Although her physical body was blackened, it wasn't pierced through.

However, Qin Ming had gained confidence. He was verifying if this old scoundrel was truly in the Newborn realm, and now he was reassured!

He held a suppressed rage in his heart. To actually see this dead old hag again, now he could finally vent his anger and sever a knot in his heart.

Ever since he embarked on the Newborn path, he had never been so wretched, having been blasted apart by a spiritual field and Heavenly Radiance Energy, experiencing a death tribulation!

The woman in white was lost in thought. The battle before her was a bit bloody, and it didn't last very long.

Qin Ming came with a life-or-death resolve, his fighting spirit bursting. Heavenly Radiance boiled within his flesh and blood. He had never fought any opponent with such "earnestness."

At this moment, he unleashed one powerful move after another, one trump card after another, his fists landing squarely with blood, his kicks precise and accompanied by the sound of bones cracking.

The old hag was like a broken sack, sent flying everywhere, losing limbs, and in a blink, she was no longer recognizable as a human.

"How is this possible?!" She felt that her current achievements were immeasurably stronger than when she was a young girl, that she had truly reached the highest hall of the Newborn realm, enough to look down upon the world and amaze the night mist world.

Yet, she was being clutched by the wrist by Qin Ming, treated like a scarecrow, used as a sledgehammer, slammed all over the ground. The ground, protected by runic restrictions, was exceptionally hard.

Finally, her arm was torn off, her body smashed like broken porcelain, all her bones shattered.

"Beast!" She was furious to the extreme, deeply humiliated. What was her status, her position, to be tormented like this, to be smashed to pieces?

With a bang, her chin shattered, and all her old yellow teeth flew out.

Qin Ming looked on with disgust. At the last moment, he raised his right foot, his entire sole glowing, incredibly brilliant. He stomped down violently with a bang, crushing her to oblivion. There was no longer such a person.

"You're cheating!" The woman in white was somewhat disbelieving. That was a combat tool she had personally crafted, how could it be defeated so quickly and so tragically?

Qin Ming was frank and open, facing her and signaling that she could investigate.

"My own hands are itching!" The woman in white walked over, her lotus steps graceful, runes appearing beneath her feet, her entire being enveloped in moonlight, sacred and transcendental.

The only discordant detail was her dark hair obscuring her face, detracting from her peerless grace.

"Alright, as long as it's within the First Realm, I'm happy to comply!" Qin Ming said, his heart quite excited. He truly wanted to gauge the strength of the Divine Temple's master at the same level.
