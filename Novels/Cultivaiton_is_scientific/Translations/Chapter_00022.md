# Chapter 22: Contamination

The next morning, Li Shiming sighed helplessly as he felt the spiritual energy vortex in his chest. He had deliberately refrained from practicing the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" the previous day, wanting to see if his depleted spiritual power would recover naturally.

After a full night, there was no sign of recovery in his spiritual energy reserves. Moreover, he discovered something even more troubling.

When he had the Spirit Gathering Plate, daily practice of the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" had masked this issue. But now, with the plate unusable and two days without cultivation, he could clearly feel his body becoming contaminated without spiritual energy nourishment.

The source of this contamination? His daily food.

It wasn't that the food was poisonous, but rather that mundane food lacking spiritual energy was essentially impure waste for a body accustomed to spiritual nourishment. While the contamination wasn't severe yet, prolonged exposure combined with his inability to cultivate would not just stall his progress—it might even cause regression.

He wasn't completely without spiritual energy. His server room space contained abundant spiritual power. But this was finite—a non-renewable resource he had intended to save for emergencies. Now, it seemed he'd have to use it to address his immediate needs.

First, he needed to solve the food problem. Without spiritual food, even using the server room's energy reserves would only delay the inevitable.

Both "Basic Spiritual Farming" and Shi Ximing's cultivation notes contained methods for growing spiritual rice. But even the most skilled housewife couldn't cook without rice—he needed spiritual fields to grow it.

The methods for creating spiritual fields existed, but the required materials were things he'd never even heard of, let alone seen or purchased. Even if they were available, as a mere second-level Qi Refining cultivator without any real means of self-defense, attempting to trade his magical tools or books for such materials would likely get him devoured whole by other cultivators.

The traditional spiritual field approach was impossible. Then he remembered advanced planting techniques from his previous life.

Though spiritual rice required special cultivation methods, he did possess some spiritual farming techniques—the "Spring Breeze Transforms Rain" art could promote the rice's growth. With nothing urgent at hand, he focused his consciousness into the IBM z15 mainframe server, searching its vast database for relevant agricultural information.

Li Shiming had completely forgotten—today was the autumn examination results day. Among all candidates, he was probably the only one completely indifferent to the outcome.

"Young master, congratulations! You've passed with second highest honors!" cried the servant Mo Yan outside the study.

Normally, official messengers would deliver such news, but since Li Shiming resided in the government office's rear garden, Mo Yan had fetched the announcement himself.

"Siqin, give Mo Yan two taels of silver. All servants shall receive rewards," Li Shiming said distractedly, his train of thought interrupted.

"Young master, you're a provincial graduate!" Siqin exclaimed, far less composed than her master, hopping excitedly.

"I know. Tell Mo Yan to quiet down and take his reward elsewhere," Li Shiming waved dismissively, calming the excited maid.

Though she didn't understand her master's indifference, Siqin's joy was undiminished as she skipped out of the study.

Li Shiming refocused on the IBM z15's database. His previous homeland had been world-leading in rice cultivation techniques, producing legendary figures like the great druid Yuan who elevated rice yields to unprecedented heights.

But time and resources were limited. Developing superior rice strains wasn't immediately feasible. His priority was cultivating spiritual rice first—other improvements could follow.

After extensive research, he identified hydroponics as the most viable solution. Hydroponic rice cultivation was already a relatively mature technology.

He ultimately chose plant factory-style rice cultivation for its space efficiency. The server room's usable space was only about 70 square meters after accounting for existing equipment—far too small for traditional rice farming.

But with vertical farming in a plant factory environment, the 4-meter-high space could accommodate four growing layers above a seedling level. To maximize space, Li Shiming dismantled the ceiling panels originally housing central air conditioning and LED lights.

Without external connections, the air conditioning was useless, leaving only vents that served no purpose. The numerous LED lights, however, were perfect for plant photosynthesis. With readymade electricity, they could illuminate multiple growing layers—saving him from the time-consuming process of manufacturing lights from scratch.

Over the following days, between obligatory visits to his examination supervisor, Li Shiming remained mostly sequestered in his study. He spent hundreds of taels acquiring materials.

Inside his server room, a five-tiered wooden frame now stood, holding glass trays of varied colors—each a priceless treasure in this era, though their impurities didn't affect functionality. He'd made them from sand, lacking pure silica for clear glass. The ample gold and silver from his storage pouch made cost irrelevant anyway.
