# Chapter 71: Discarded Immortal Cultivator?

In the square, a Xiangzhu personally escorted two young disciples, who strolled about with an air of nonchalance, as if they were out for a leisurely walk. The Xiangzhu stood by, smiling obsequiously. Anyone could tell the identity of the person they were accompanying just by glancing at the cloud-smoke robes they wore, which were of the same level as those worn by elders.

The onlookers felt a mix of admiration, incredulity, and envy towards this young man, who had risen to prominence from the Seven Mystic Gate (七玄门) at such a young age. They couldn't help but feel that this peer of theirs would become a great figure, one that they would brag about to their grandchildren in their old age.

The young man was known as the contemporary "Little Divine Physician" of the Seven Mystic Gate. To ensure their own safety, they had to show respect to him. Having a Xiangzhu escort him wasn't excessive at all.

"Hey, Little Four, Little Four!" A burly man, significantly larger and taller than those around him, with a face that resembled a wrinkled Pekingese dog, jumped up and down, calling out to Li Zhi Ming.

A stern-looking Xiangzhu was about to scold the man but stopped when he saw Li Zhi Ming approaching.

"Big Bull," Li Zhi Ming said, patting the man's shoulder before delivering a gentle punch to his stomach. "What have you been eating to grow so strong?"

The man grinned, scratching his head. "You've asked that many times, Little Four. I don't know. I just wrote to my mother saying that if I were to go back to farming now, I'd have the strength to till at least five acres of land!"

Li Zhi Ming chuckled, amused by the man's simplicity. As a Wu warrior in the Seven Mystic Gate, he earned a substantial amount of silver each year, and soon he would be receiving the same amount as other Wu warriors. The man, on the other hand, was still thinking about farming, which paid much less.

"Grow up, you're going to be an adult soon," Li Zhi Ming advised, his voice a little softer. "When you're out on missions, don't be so reckless. Try to avoid being at the forefront; it's better to hang back when you can."

The man nodded, still grinning.

As Li Zhi Ming walked away, a Xiangzhu approached and kicked the man in the buttocks. "What were you babbling about just now? Use your brain!"

Meanwhile, Li Zhi Ming caught sight of Meng Wei Zhi, who was about to exit the hall, accompanied by several others. One of them was a refined-looking man in white robes, holding a fan, while another was a short, ugly man with a lump on his face and a gold lock around his neck. Li Zhi Ming's gaze swept over them, and his eyes narrowed as he sensed something.

Name: ???, Destiny: Light Green [Discarded Immortal Cultivator]

Mixed Qi Cultivation, Qi Refining 4th Layer - Guard too high, cannot be copied.

- Guard too high, other information cannot be probed.

Li Zhi Ming was taken aback.

Meng Wei Zhi introduced the men to Li Zhi Ming, "Li Xiaoyi, this is Hai Sha Bang's leader, Su Zong Guang; and this is Mr. Ye, also known as 'Golden Light Reverend,' a high-ranking Daoist."

Li Zhi Ming exchanged greetings with Su Zong Guang, who looked him up and down before responding with a courteous bow.

Meng Wei Zhi explained that the Seven Mystic Gate and Hai Sha Bang had a history of friction, but they were now discussing a potential alliance and boundary demarcation. Su Zong Guang had come to observe their capping ceremony and engage in some martial exchange.

Li Zhi Ming was wary; why had Su Zong Guang brought a cultivator with him, passing him off as a Daoist expert? Meng Wei Zhi wasn't foolish; he must have his reasons for trusting this person.

As Meng Wei Zhi was busy, Li Zhi Ming decided to let the matter rest for now. He would discuss it with him privately later.

Meng Wei Zhi invited Su Zong Guang to the square to witness the capping ceremony, and Su agreed, seemingly unfazed by the presence of the Seven Mystic Gate's members. He was accompanied by several burly warriors and the ugly, short man, who wore an arrogant expression.
