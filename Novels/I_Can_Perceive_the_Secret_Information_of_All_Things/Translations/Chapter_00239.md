# Chapter 239: Raising the Rod  

The dragonfish swam desperately, its large eyes wide with panic.  

Ice spikes chased relentlessly behind it.  

The hunchbacked angler had no choice but to swing his rod again, expending a great deal of spiritual energy to entangle the spikes, flinging them into the sky before shattering them.  

He knew the problem stemmed from the eerie pipa music in the air, yet no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't pinpoint its source.  

He was the fisherman, but now, it seemed, he had become the fish.  

The taste of this role reversal was unbearable.
