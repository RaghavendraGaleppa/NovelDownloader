Chapter 50: "Seven Determinations to Uphold the Universe," a Profound Art Reaches the Realm of Perfection! Bingtuozi's Request

"Let's try using the Heavenly Scripture Seal first."

Li Mo retrieved the Heavenly Scripture Seal and stamped it on the scripture.

There was no reaction.

The small characters on the seal did not flow into the scripture as expected.

Clearly, the Heavenly Scripture Seal was unable to perfect the incomplete martial art.

"Should I try learning the first eight stances first?"

Li Mo felt a pang of frustration.

If he had a choice, he wouldn't want to learn from an incomplete scripture.

If there were no other options, he would have to wait until he went down the mountain to complete his sect's tasks and then visit the merchant guild to see if he could purchase a suitable martial art. If not, he could offer a hefty sum for the merchant guild to help him find one.

For Li Mo, problems that could be solved with money were not considered problems at the moment.

Half an hour later.

He had already memorized the general outline of "The Twelve Hammers of Settling the Wind Wave."

Although he was reluctant to admit it.

He seemed to learn hammer techniques much faster than sword techniques.

"The incomplete scripture... should be able to be infused with martial dao comprehension."

Li Mo tried it out tentatively.

[One year's worth of comprehension infused successfully.]

[In the first year, due to your exceptional talent in hammer techniques, even though the martial art you obtained was incomplete, you still persisted in practicing it. You mastered the basics in one month, became proficient in three months, and achieved a preliminary level of proficiency in six months.]

[Exactly one year later, you had a stroke of genius and broke through to a high level of proficiency.]

Li Mo was taken aback.

"Is this really me? One year to reach a high level of proficiency in an incomplete martial art?"

It felt unfamiliar, too unfamiliar.

The good news was that he had finally discovered his talent beyond his good looks.

The bad news was that this talent...

"Interest and talent are indeed two different things."

"Why did it have to be a hammer?"

Li Mo's feelings were complex.

Could it be that he would be able to comprehend the hammer technique to the realm of perfection using the incomplete scripture?

[Five years' worth of martial dao comprehension infused successfully.]

[In the first year, you practiced "The Twelve Hammers of Settling the Wind Wave" to perfection, but due to the lack of subsequent chapters, you hit a bottleneck and were stuck at the perfect level, unable to make further progress.]

[In the second year, you began to ponder and think deeply, trying to understand the true meaning of this hammer technique and attempting to find the missing parts.]

[In the third year, the originally blocked path was actually found to have some direction, and you created the ninth and tenth stances by feeling your way through.]

[In the fourth year, this hammer technique had become a nearly complete puzzle in your mind. You effortlessly created the eleventh and twelfth stances, successfully completing the "The Twelve Hammers of Settling the Wind Wave." Compared to the original version, it was subtly better.]

[In the fifth year, your "The Twelve Hammers of Settling the Wind Wave" reached the realm of perfection.]

Li Mo held his forehead, questioning his life.

Firstly, because countless comprehensions of hammer techniques were emerging in his mind.

Secondly, his talent in this area seemed to be even better than he had imagined!

Five years!

An incomplete martial art!

He had actually managed to complete it and practice it to the realm of perfection!

Compared to learning sword techniques at a slow pace, it was like riding a rocket.

"Is it because my foundation in hammer techniques is good?"

"Or is it because I became the master of the Pan-Jie Star Hammer, and my talent in this area was enhanced?"

The divine weapon seemed to be more than just powerful.

Sensing the Pan-Jie Star Hammer in the world seed, Li Mo didn't delve deeper for now.

He couldn't even take out the divine weapon to use it, so thinking too much about it was pointless.

"Let's complete 'The Twelve Hammers of Settling the Wind Wave' first."

Li Mo walked to a relatively flat blue stone.

He unfolded the paper on it and began to write.

In a short while, the complete superior martial art was brought to life on the paper.

Taking out the ancient bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal, he stamped it on the paper. The characters, as small as tadpoles, immediately flowed in and arranged themselves.

Finally, even the name of the martial art changed:

"Seven Determinations to Uphold the Universe"

A brand new, supreme martial art was born.

"Seven Determinations to Uphold the Universe" could be said to be a super upgraded version of "The Thirteen Hammers of Settling the Wind Wave." The former, without changing the essence of the latter, took the concept of "slowness" to the extreme.

It emphasized using slowness to counter speed and lightness to overcome heaviness.

When practiced to the realm of perfection, it could unleash unimaginable, terrifying power with a seemingly light and casual strike.

It was capable of splitting mountains, cracking seas, and severing rivers.

No further explanation was needed.

Martial dao comprehension, activated!
