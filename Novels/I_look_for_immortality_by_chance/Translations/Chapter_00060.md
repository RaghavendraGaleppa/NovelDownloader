# Chapter 60: Spirit Crane Island, Waterfall  

Before this, Gu Yuan had never imagined that the Radiant Heaven Eyes technique would require so many spirit stones.  

After all, the Minor Giant Spirit Wood had only cost around four hundred spirit stones.  

But sometimes, cultivation is just this peculiar.  

Top-tier spells aren't necessarily the most expensive, but the most expensive spells are invariably top-tier.  

The Radiant Heaven Eyes might not be more profound than the Seed Body Seal, but requiring such vast resources undoubtedly marked it as an advanced technique.  

Since it was an advanced technique, it was certainly worth cultivating.  

Moreover, with this technique, the methods from the "Bandit Cultivator's Treasure"—no, the "Cultivator's Treasure"—could all be employed without fear of being ambushed again.  

Thus, Gu Yuan had spent the past days figuring out how to gather the necessary funds.  

He had already found a lead, as he still possessed an extremely valuable treasure—the Stone Flask.  

Over the course of a year, the Stone Flask had accumulated twelve drops of stone liquid. Gu Yuan hadn't wasted a single drop, meticulously examining each opportunity they revealed.  

He had also distributed his attention evenly, checking "Mentorship," "Cultivation," "Seals," and "Spirit Stones" multiple times.  

Unfortunately, the gains had been modest.  

After all, the Azure Peak Dao Academy was only so large. If there had been any opportunities, Gu Yuan would have discovered them earlier.  

A year was hardly enough time for new opportunities to emerge.  

Still, it wasn't a complete loss. Last month, when he checked the "Spirit Stone Wealth" category, Gu Yuan noticed an opportunity glowing with a green light tinged with a strand of silver.  

"A spirit stone opportunity with a silver glow must be worth nearly a thousand spirit stones. If I can obtain it, cultivating the Radiant Heaven Eyes will be more than sufficient, and I’ll even have extra for a windfall."  

With this thought, Gu Yuan wasted no time. After freshening up, donning his cloud boots, and securing his hair with a jade hairpin, he left the Qian Yuan Cave, mounted his jade shuttle, and flew toward the location indicated by the opportunity.

### Spirit Crane Island  

This island was one of several under the jurisdiction of the Spirit Beast Hall of the Azure Peak Dao Academy. It was vast in size and home to many spirit beasts, the most numerous being the "Azure Cloud Spirit Cranes," a mid-grade spirit beast.  

Spirit beasts, like demonic beasts, were generally classified into three grades: upper, middle, and lower.  

Lower-grade demonic beasts typically didn’t exceed the fifth layer of Qi Refining in strength. Mid-grade beasts usually capped at the seventh layer, while upper-grade beasts could rival the ninth layer.  

The combat power and intelligence of demonic beasts varied greatly, making their grading somewhat arbitrary compared to the detailed classifications of human cultivators.  

Beasts above the upper grade were generally referred to as "Earth Demons," possessing strength comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators along with mysterious and peculiar abilities.  

Above Earth Demons were "Great Demons," capable of contending with Golden Core cultivators—truly formidable beings.  

Beyond that, they could be called "Demon Kings," equivalent to Dao Embryo cultivators, elusive and rarely seen.  

Though the Azure Cloud Spirit Cranes were only mid-grade, their appearance was exquisite—snow-white bodies, ink-dotted wings, an ethereal aura, and remarkable intelligence. Their speed was exceptional, rivaling even upper-grade spirit beasts, making them excellent mounts.  

The Azure Peak Dao Academy bred them in large numbers, hence the island’s name.  

Like Silverfish Island, Spirit Crane Island was protected by formations, barring entry to anyone not affiliated with the Spirit Beast Hall.  

But such restrictions were no obstacle for Gu Yuan. He followed the same method as before, accepting a mission from the Fate Hall to collect spider silk, which granted him easy access to the island.  

"Senior Brother Gu, I truly appreciate your help!"  

"Rainbow Cloud Spiders are naturally aggressive, and lately, they’ve been even more ferocious due to egg-laying. Without at least the seventh layer of Qi Refining, it’s impossible to enter their nests to collect silk."  

"Just the other day, a senior brother passing by their nest was bitten. Please be careful!"  

A young woman in a colorful dress, with a delicate and charming face, guided Gu Yuan while anxiously reminding him.  

Though the island was dominated by Azure Cloud Spirit Cranes, it also housed many other spirit beasts, mostly those that produced valuable materials or had strategic uses.  

With so many disciples in the academy, maintaining a steady supply of spiritual materials was essential.  

The Rainbow Cloud Spider was one such mid-grade spirit beast, producing "Rainbow Cloud Silk," a crucial material for crafting Daoist robes.  

"Thank you for the warning, Junior Sister. I’ll be cautious."  

Gu Yuan smiled in response.  

The two then flew over the forest on their magical tools, eventually stopping before a white cavern.  

The cave was deep and dark, its end unseen, exuding only a fierce aura.  

"Senior Brother… this is the Rainbow Cloud Spider’s nest. Please be careful!"  

The young woman handed Gu Yuan a jade bottle inscribed with bird-like seal scripts, her voice trembling slightly.  

At only the fifth layer of Qi Refining, she dared not approach.  

"Don’t worry. Wait here for my return."  

Gu Yuan took the bottle with a calm smile and strode confidently into the cave.  

The girl remained outside, nervously watching the entrance.  

"Hiss—!"  

Before long, violent hissing echoed from the cave, making her shudder.  

But the noise ended as quickly as it began.  

Just as she grew worried, Gu Yuan emerged, holding the jade bottle with an air of ease.  

"Junior Sister, mission accomplished."  

He tossed her the bottle with a faint smile.  

"Wow! It really is Rainbow Cloud Silk! Senior Brother, you’re amazing!"  

The girl opened the bottle and gasped at the sight of the cloud-like silk inside.  

Rainbow Cloud Spiders in their egg-laying phase were notoriously aggressive, and even seventh-layer Qi Refining cultivators struggled to subdue them.  

Previously, one such cultivator had taken an entire incense stick’s worth of time to collect silk. Yet Gu Yuan had done it in mere moments.  

The stark difference made the girl’s eyes sparkle with admiration.  

"Each batch of silk earns five spirit stones!"  

"With Senior Brother’s strength, earning twenty stones a day would be effortless!"  

Her expression brimmed with envy before she sighed.  

"Too bad the spiders don’t produce silk endlessly. Otherwise, Senior Brother could earn a hundred stones daily!"  

Gu Yuan chuckled and shook his head.  

Working for wages? Never in this lifetime.  

The Cultivator’s Treasure made it clear—diligence alone wouldn’t lead to greatness.  

Even if he didn’t become a bandit cultivator, he needed to find other revenue streams—either taking missions outside the Fate Hall or mastering a lucrative skill.  

Spending days collecting silk was no long-term solution.  

"Junior Sister, if you have other tasks, don’t let me keep you. These spiders are no trouble for me. I’ll report back once I’m done."  

Gu Yuan’s true goal wasn’t silk collection.  

Having someone else around was inconvenient.  

"Then I’ll leave it to you, Senior Brother! I still need to cut grass for the Azure Cloud Spirit Cranes. A good haul earns three stones!"  

The girl was happy to oblige.  

A cultivator’s time was precious, especially for those of humble origins. Without needing to accompany Gu Yuan, she could focus on her own tasks.  

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, she departed.  

Amidst the vast forest and caves, Gu Yuan was now alone.  

He visited two more caves to collect silk before ensuring no one was around and turning eastward.  

The eastern woods grew denser, the trees ancient and towering.  

As the terrain sloped downward, he entered a valley where the trees grew even thicker, their canopies blocking out the sunlight.  

"Screech—!"  

The cries of monkeys echoed through the valley.  

Gu Yuan pressed on.  

"Rumble—!"  

Suddenly, the roar of rushing water filled the air.  

Gu Yuan looked up to see a waterfall cascading down, its spray shimmering like countless droplets.  

His brow furrowed.  

The stone liquid had indicated the opportunity lay ahead.  

But the waterfall blocked the path—where was the opportunity?  

"Unless…"  

Gu Yuan gazed thoughtfully at the thundering falls.
