# Chapter 79: Close Friend

Even if Qin Ming was mature, he was still a youth. He didn't hide his feelings, and his "Why?" revealed his indignation.

Meng Xinghai smiled, saying, "Only by holding the 'rules' can one reason, right?"

At this moment, Qin Ming held the mutton-fat jade iron blade. He wasn't truly unable to restrain himself; he simply intended to show a bit of youthful spirit in front of an elder.

"I took the fall for him, and in the end, he was still dissatisfied. Where can I go to reason with that?" Qin Ming said. These experiences indeed easily angered people.

"It seems that although you've lived in the Cui family for over ten years, you've never truly considered yourself a young master of a prominent family," Meng Xinghai remarked.

Qin Ming paused, then understood his meaning.

"Is it simply because the Cui family's young master is noble and out of reach?" he asked calmly.

"Indeed," Meng Xinghai chuckled. "For you, if you put yourself in his shoes and understood his state of mind, you might be even more enraged."

Qin Ming felt it was better to ignore Cui Chonghe and not ponder why he got angry. Because, in Cui Chonghe's eyes, his status was so low it could be disregarded, yet he had traveled with Cui Chonghe's fiancée, which was a severe overstep.

Meng Xinghai said, "You might think you helped him avert disaster, but from the perspective of the legitimate son of a millennium-old aristocratic family, it's impossible for him to care about your feelings."

Qin Ming scoffed at himself, "It seems I'm just an ordinary person. Living in the Cui family for years, I never cultivated that noble air, nor did I immediately adopt that mindset."

But the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. His so-called maturity beyond his years and composure were useless now; he could barely suppress the fire in his heart. Evidently, in Cui Chonghe's eyes, he was merely a servant who could be used as a scapegoat, a retainer raised by the Cui family who could be discarded at any time. How could such a person walk side-by-side with the Wang family's legitimate daughter?

Qin Ming thought about his experiences in the Cui family; the hierarchy was indeed strict. So, he helped someone avert disaster, and in the end, he "offended" them?

"To be fair, Cui Chonghe truly possesses near-immortal potential. That old senior hadn't taken a disciple in over a hundred years, yet he made an exception for Cui Chonghe, taking him in when he was only three or four years old," Meng Xinghai said. In truth, he was also trying to enlighten Qin Ming, to not be overly impulsive, as the circumstances and disparities between the two sides were vast.

Qin Ming nodded, then suddenly realized that Cui Chonghe's senior brothers and sisters were all over a hundred years old? If they were all still alive, that would be quite terrifying. At this moment, he yearned intensely to become stronger, wanting to venture into the deep mountains and vast marshes to search for spiritual substances. Moreover, he hoped for another spring thunder. Although there was a saying that it was safest to enter the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall only when the first spring thunder stirred each year, and the spiritual substances produced were most abundant then, he still wanted to try again at other times.

"The Li, Wang, and Cui families are like three unshakeable mountains, and I'm just a very ordinary youth. I don't want to get caught up in it," Qin Ming sighed.

He learned from Meng Xinghai that when the Wang family discovered they had been deceived, they were furious. The Cui family had originally intended to quickly eliminate the fake Cui Chonghe to quell the commotion.

"Cui Hao is a sentimental person. He said he viewed you as a close nephew and couldn't kill you, almost falling out with some people in the Cui family."

It was precisely because Cui Hao stepped forward, and because the matter had slightly escalated and word had gotten out, that the Cui family found it difficult to act ruthlessly again, fearing they would gain a reputation for being harsh and ungrateful.

"So, without my knowing, I've lingered near the gates of hell multiple times." For Qin Ming, the millennium-old aristocratic families were simply too vast; he even considered fleeing to a distant land.

Meng Xinghai seemed to read his thoughts and said, "For now, stay in Crimson Cloud City. After early spring arrives, those ancient orthodoxies and special academies will begin to select disciples one after another. You can research them carefully; some organizations are quite resistant to aristocratic families." As he himself was a child of an aristocratic family, it was awkward for him to say more on this topic.

Qin Ming was absentminded. The Night Mist World was vast and boundless, yet also fraught with danger. Where would be suitable for him?

Meng Xinghai said, "Don't worry, the token I gave you is still very useful. Within Crimson Cloud City, you won't need to worry about your safety for the time being."

Qin Ming examined it carefully. It was a black jade token, with the character 'Meng' on one side and 'Xun' on the other.

"Thank you, Uncle Meng!" He immediately stood up to express his gratitude.

This token was brought out from the Meng family and was extraordinary. The character 'Xun' (patrol) was carved onto it by Meng Xinghai at the last moment to grant him authority, allowing him to patrol the city and the mountains. With this token, Qin Ming was effectively temporarily under protection.

Meng Xinghai said, "I've told you all this and quite a few pieces of information, primarily because Qingyue asked me to look after you. Some people don't care who Cui Chonghe is; they only know that an old friend once used this name. At the same time, I must warn you, many more people care deeply about the identity of Cui Chonghe. Be extremely cautious when you encounter old acquaintances in the future."

Qin Ming nodded solemnly, saying, "If Qingyue ever encounters trouble in the future, even if she's thousands of miles away, I'll rush to her aid the moment I hear about it!" If not for Li Qingyue, would Meng Xinghai even know who Qin Ming was? Even if he had heard of him, there would be no reason for such solicitude. In the past, when Qin Ming lived in Clear River City under the identity of Cui Chonghe, he had many friends, but now, those who could still be called close friends should be few.

Meng Xinghai said, "Qingyue said that the closer true friends get to you, the more trouble they might bring you."

"I understand!" Qin Ming nodded. The Cui family, to quell the Wang family's fury, had at one point wanted him to completely disappear to settle the commotion. If he were to re-enter that circle and associate with familiar people, something would surely go wrong.

A sense of indignation welled up in Qin Ming's chest, but circumstances were stronger than individual will. Others had already drawn lines for him, forbidding him from stepping into certain areas and from interacting with people of that stratum.

"With my talent, I should be able to rise quickly. When I'm strong enough to retrieve the silk scrolls from the Cui family, once I re-enter that circle, Cui Chonghe, Li Qingxu, and even some people from the Wang family might target me. The path ahead is full of challenges; I need to grow quickly." These were the thoughts in Qin Ming's mind. The path ahead was not peaceful, even arduous, but it also filled him with fighting spirit, sparks flickering in his eyes. If he didn't even have confidence in himself, he might as well return directly to Black and White Mountain and voluntarily live in seclusion in that remote area!

"Hmm, the reason I'm telling you all this isn't entirely because of Qingyue. I also have high hopes for you. I noticed you entered the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall last time," Meng Xinghai stated directly.

Such frankness startled Qin Ming. This matter wasn't concealed at all?

Meng Xinghai chuckled, "Don't worry, only I in the entire Crimson Cloud City noticed that something was off with you and that you left there alive."

"That's good!" Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief.

"Besides you, that Qian Cheng also survived, but he mysteriously disappeared the next day." Qin Ming knew who he was talking about—that seemingly dull youth was actually not foolish.

"I'm not joking with you. Recently, you should thoroughly research those ancient orthodoxies and special higher academies. Some places make it difficult even for the hands of aristocratic families to reach too far."

As Qin Ming rose to take his leave, Meng Xinghai mentioned these things again.

"Thank you, Uncle Meng!"

Qin Ming left the City Lord's Mansion and returned to the inn, idly turning the black jade token in his hands. He was somewhat lost in thought. If he were to enter the mountains, he would also be a member of the patrol team, and of a relatively high rank. He felt a pang of emotion, as the first time he had ever killed anyone was against Fu Entao, Feng Yi'an, and other members of the patrol team.

In a private room on a nearby restaurant, several people closed the windows. Not long ago, they had watched Qin Ming enter the inn.

"Daring to meddle in our Xinyi Hall's affairs, it seems he indeed has some connections with the City Lord's Mansion. Don't touch him now."

"It's not just 'don't act rashly.' Look, someone gave us this scroll, asking us to keep a close eye on him. This young man might have a significant background."

"When encountering someone unfathomable, it's best to get less involved. We can watch him, but if a client demands action, we'll have to politely refuse."

"Currently, the other party doesn't intend for us to act, and from the looks of it, he's a guest from afar."

...

Over the next two days, Qin Ming and Wu Zheng together researched organizations and orthodoxies that had selected disciples in Crimson Cloud City over the years. He suspected that Meng Xinghai was referring to those special higher academies, as they surprisingly required unified examinations open to everyone, meaning even children of aristocratic families couldn't directly enter. Unless one truly possessed exceptional talent and genuine battle achievements capable of dominating an area, everyone, regardless of background, had to undergo unified tests and trials.

Afterward, Qin Ming began to meticulously study the map of the mountain range outside Crimson Cloud City, intending to search for spiritual substances. He had been provoked by the three great mountains — the Cui, Wang, and Li families — and yearned to rise immediately.

The next day, he went to an old-fashioned weapons shop and bought a black-gold hammer. It still had a long handle but was much heavier than the one he used before.

"Brother Qin, it seems you really wasted fifteen day-gold coins at my home. You haven't grasped anything about being skilled in both spear and arrow, and now you're switching to a hammer?" Wu Zheng felt regretful; there was no one he could spar with. Unlike Old Wu, he wasn't so conservative and really wanted Qin Ming to guide him.

Qin Ming laughed, "I actually know a thing or two about spear techniques too; you can ask me directly if you have any questions. I'm practicing with a hammer now to deal with thick-skinned, robust giant beasts. Ordinary weapons are too light, too gentle; they can't effectively strike such behemoths."

He was preparing to enter the mountains. With his current strength approaching five thousand *jin*, he wouldn't feel any pressure even if he had to contend head-on with someone who had undergone six or seven rebirths. This time, if anyone dared to intercept him again, he would definitely let them know what it meant to have "ten thousand peach blossoms bloom with a single hammer strike!"

...

Xu Sheng, unseen for three days, arrived. His face was pale, and he was surprisingly injured.

"Brother Xu, what happened to you?" Qin Ming and Wu Zheng both asked him with concern what had happened.

Xu Sheng sighed, "Sigh, Zhou Lin and I went to help a friend. We were ambushed in the mountain forest. I suddenly feel that the profession of spiritual hunter is even harder to manage; it's better to be an itinerant merchant."

"It's good that you returned alive and unharmed. By the way, how is Sister Fangfang?" Qin Ming asked.

"Who is Sister Fangfang?" Xu Sheng asked, puzzled.

"That... Sister Zhou Lin."

Xu Sheng laughed, saying, "Haha, she's fine. She dodged faster than me."

"Were you intercepted again?" Qin Ming asked.

Xu Sheng sighed, "Not yet. We had just entered the habitat of the spiritual creature and hadn't even found its nest when we were ambushed."

"How about we go take another look?" Qin Ming was tempted.

Xu Sheng was about to say something when he suddenly realized that the other party was already stronger than him! He was a master of five rebirths, capable of lifting only over three thousand *jin*, far less than Qin Ming's current strength.

"Alright, let's go again!"

Soon, Sister Fangfang, Zhou Lin, also received the news and followed Xu Sheng and Qin Ming back into the mountains.
