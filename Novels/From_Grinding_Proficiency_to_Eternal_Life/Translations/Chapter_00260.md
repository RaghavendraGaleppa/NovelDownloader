# Chapter 260: Ancient Cultivator?!

Ever since encountering him, Su Zhenhe had spent the vast majority of his time with his right hand pressing down on the sword hilt beneath his robe. The deep-seated malice hidden within him...

This sword...

*Hum!*

A crisp sound, like falling jade beads, quietly emerged.

The moment the blade left its sheath, a cold gleam flashed like a sudden lightning strike. The clear, icy light of the sword illuminated the surroundings, revealing the gaps in the earth.

The instant Xu Yunfan’s knuckles touched the hilt, he felt a sharp pain in his palm. This three-foot green edge had not yet drawn blood, yet the sharpness radiating from its edge was already capable of cutting through his skin.

As the sword spine completely left the python leather sheath, a dragon-like tremor erupted from the bronze mouth of the scabbard, causing the岩 sword sound to hum incessantly.

“Good sword!”

Even with Xu Yunfan’s current attainments in forging weapons, he still felt a sense of astonishment.

The body of this sword seemed to be condensed from ice crystals. Through its transparency, one could see dark silver cloud patterns roaming across the blade. As the long sword slid out, the extremely delicate patterns made it feel as if the cloud patterns on the sword body were flowing like water waves.

Three inches beyond the sword锋, floating dust silently split in half, as if an invisible blade hung before the physical one.

Treasure Artifact!

If not for the fact that weapons do not possess their own sentience, it could fully be called a Divine Weapon.

“Such a pity…”

Xu Yunfan glanced at a drop of blood oozing from his fingertips. This sword walked a treacherous path, pursuing sharpness to the extreme. It was something his Vajra-like physique could not withstand.

This also resulted in the long sword having insufficient hardness. With just a flick of the sword spine, this sword would shatter completely like glass.

This sword was forged for a single fatal strike.

Xu Yunfan observed it for a long time. He pulled the scabbard from Su Zhenhe’s body and tied it to his waist, sheathing the sword.

This sword might be able to play an unexpected role. If Su Zhenhe had struck first just now…

Xu Yunfan lowered his head to look at the Dragon Scale Armor on his body. If not for this armor, Su Zhenhe would have probably swung his sword long ago.

Suppressing the thoughts in his mind, Xu Yunfan turned his gaze back to the man atop the Blood Offering Jade Platform.

Through the test just now, he had already seen the intensity of the Blood Offering Jade’s absorption of blood Qi.

It could not go beyond the Refining Flesh Realm; anything further would be unsustainable. The fact that this realm only allowed Outer Three Harmony martial artists to enter was definitely related to this.

He pressed his knuckles against the Kui pattern protrusion on his Dragon Scale Armor. The chilling sensation suppressed his surging thoughts completely.

As he turned, the crimson mist rising from the Blood Offering Jade Platform happened to pass over the third ring of coiled dragon pillars. The figure in the cyan robe was now suspended in the center of the mist, the clear radiance flowing between his sleeves blending with the blood light into a诡异紫.

Below the nine-fold jade steps, Zhou Tianyan’s wide-open throat had shrunk into a withered well-like hole.

The Xuan Turtle Treasure Armor he had prided himself on in life was now writhing like a living creature. The golden silk armor leaves were deeply embedded in his gray-green skin and flesh. The blood light wandering through his meridians was converging along the patterns of the steps into the high platform.

Seven Nine Luminants Sect disciples maintained their struggling postures. Their skin, clinging to the wrinkles of their bones, was condensed with ice-crystal-like blood sand. Flickering blue phosphorescent fires floated in their sunken eye sockets, as if their souls had been forcibly extracted by some ancient curse.

Silence lasted for a long time. Xu Yunfan pulled out the Ginseng Baby and took a deep breath of its essence. The originally quite scorching ginseng essence, now under his Wash Marrow Realm, flowed like strands of warm current through his four limbs and hundred bones.

He raised his hand and lightly touched with his fingertips. A suction force suddenly rose from the Blood Offering Jade, making his body tense slightly. It was a long while before the light in his eyes relaxed slightly.

Fortunately, it was about the same as he had imagined. His劲力 had now transformed into blood entering the marrow, his blood Qi as solid as a fortress. The Blood Offering Jade had no way to suck it out.

He looked up at the young man sitting atop the high platform. Just as he felt a slight hesitation in his heart, the Extreme Dao Remnant suddenly writhed. At this moment, he could sense that the Extreme Dao Remnant was conveying a sense of urging.

This is…

After a long silence, Xu Yunfan lowered his eyes to gaze at the point where his fingertips met the Blood Offering Jade. Dark red patterns crawled like living snakes along his fingernails.

The suction force was clearly gnawing at his bone seams, but it was shattered by the roaring marrow tide within his body. The unique Golden Marrow Qi of the Wash Marrow Realm circulated around him. Every drop of essence blood was like molten rock wrapped around a star. The Blood Offering Jade’s greedy sucking sound eventually turned into an unwilling whimper.

The nine steps wound beneath his feet like dragon bones, each step forged from Blood Offering Jade.

He grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, intending to throw it with the force of a thunderfire坠地, when a clear voice from the woman in white suddenly surfaced in his mind.

“Walk up. If you are awakened, once this moment passes, this realm will be a cage. If you do not seize this chance to jump out, the path of immortality will be severed, and there will be no possibility of longevity. I can protect your safety. I swear by my soul.”

Hearing the woman’s voice appear in the real world for the first time, Xu Yunfan’s expression was momentarily stunned.

Standing still and pondering for a long time, Xu Yunfan’s heart settled. As he stepped onto the first step, the sole of his boot collided with the jade, producing a sound of metal and metal. The originally calm Blood Offering Jade suddenly burst with blood light, and the suction force doubled instantly.

His expression remained unchanged. The Kui pattern protrusions on his Dragon Scale Armor burst with赤芒, forcibly severing this suction force.

Xu Yunfan took one step after another, walking steadily and firmly.

The final step was suffused with a glass-like luster. The moment Xu Yunfan lifted his foot, the floor tiles of the entire White Jade Palace lit up simultaneously with star patterns.

The dragon scales on the back of his neck suddenly stood on end. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace leaped into his palm on its own. The mace body trembled spontaneously, erupting with a deafening roar.

When the sole of his boot finally touched the edge of the high platform, a sound like porcelain shattering came from deep within the Blood Offering Jade, as if a restriction sleeping for a thousand years had been forcefully shattered.

The face of the seated young man finally became clearly distinguishable.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted slightly. This person’s appearance was perfect to the point of not seeming like a mortal body.

When he leaned in for a closer look, he found that there were no pores on the other’s face at all. The skin texture was like top-quality mutton fat jade polished by skilled artisans for a thousand years, not even the slightest fine hair existed.

The fingers resting on the young man’s knees suddenly trembled. Flowing beneath his fingernails was liquid starlight.

Just as Xu Yunfan was investigating closely, he suddenly heard a nondescript voice.

“Have you seen the clue?”

The cold, crisp sound of metal striking metal suddenly exploded, startling the dragon scale armor leaves on the back of Xu Yunfan’s neck into standing straight up.

He abruptly raised his eyes, crashing directly into two deep green pools. The young man sitting on the Blood Offering Jade Platform had opened his eyes at some unknown time. The clear brilliance in his eyes was like moonlight falling into a cold pool, every ripple carrying a strange light trace.

*Hum!*

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace erupted with an unprecedented sharp cry. The weapon has a spirit. Xu Yunfan could clearly feel the fear and trembling being conveyed by the weapon spirit on the mace handle!

Xu Yunfan retreated seven steps in a row. The friction between his Hundred-Forged Steel Body and the ground splashed molten gold sparks, showing just how terrifying the pressure contained in that gaze was.

The clear radiance around the young man now seemed to turn into liquid clouds and mist, winding down along the infant palm prints on the surface of the Blood Offering Jade. Three hundred and sixty phantom shadows of stars emerged from the void.

*Crack!*

The young man’s jade-like fingertips trembled slightly. Xu Yunfan was startled to find that the劲力 in his body was uncontrollably surging toward the token at his waist—the “Primordial” token obtained from the枯骨 of the Xuan Zhen Sect.

“This is my token. It has come to me just right.”

Looking at the armor on Xu Yunfan’s body, a trace of surprise appeared on his expression.

“I didn’t expect such changes to happen here. Two thousand years of blood food offerings have finally nurtured some ways and means. If I had given you all some more time, I’m afraid even I wouldn’t have been qualified to come.”

The young man’s lips curled into a smile like ice cracks, but his voice sounded like the overlapping wails of countless vengeful souls in a bronze cauldron.

“The fortune of this Wash Marrow Realm of yours, young friend, is actually more to this Venerable’s taste than the Innate Primordial Qi of those nine fools.”

As he spoke, the young man lightly formed a hand seal with his fingers.

The moment the young man formed the seal, three hundred and sixty strange patterns on the surface of the Blood Offering Jade Platform simultaneously burst with青光.

Xu Yunfan only felt the bones and muscles throughout his body explode with the crisp sound of gold and jade striking each other.

The powerful physique brought by the Wash Marrow Realm was actually frozen solid by the young man’s single hand seal.
