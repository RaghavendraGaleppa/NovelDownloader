# Chapter 1: The Champion of the Spirit Testing Ceremony, Hundredfold Critical Strike  

The scorching sun blazed overhead like fire.  

In Hongfeng Valley, at Baishi Town, the annual Spirit Testing Ceremony arrived as scheduled.  

A sea of ordinary people gathered around the edges of the massive central square, their eyes fixed on the center, not daring to breathe too loudly.  

For there, an immortal master from the valley was conducting spirit tests for the town's youths of age.  

"Qi Chuan, lower eighth-grade spiritual root."  

At the center of the square, seeing that the results for this batch of youths were complete, the immortal master spoke indifferently, his voice echoing in all directions.  

Hearing this, the crowd stirred slightly, murmurs of surprise spreading.  

They all knew that possessing a spiritual root meant one could cultivate immortality.  

From this moment on, the youth named Qi Chuan would shed his mortal identity and ascend to the lofty status of an immortal master.  

They, too, had once had their chance—everyone participated in the Spirit Testing Ceremony at the age of ten. Unfortunately, not everyone was blessed with a spiritual root.  

Destined to remain in Baishi Town for life, they could only hope their descendants might one day produce someone with a spiritual root.  

"I... I actually have a spiritual root!"  

Meanwhile, within the spirit-testing formation at the center of the square, bathed in faint light, a clear-eyed youth opened his eyes and muttered to himself, disbelief and joy flashing in his gaze.  

The youth was Qi Chuan, not originally from this world but from a blue planet, where he had been a web novelist who worked late into the night until one day, he died from exhaustion. Ten years ago, he transmigrated into this world, born into the mortal branch of the Qi Clan, an immortal cultivation family in Hongfeng Valley.  

Ever since learning this was a world of immortal cultivation, Qi Chuan had yearned for the path of immortality and eternal life.  

But the odds of possessing a spiritual root were abysmally low—one in ten thousand for ordinary mortals.  

Though he belonged to the Qi Clan and carried the bloodline of cultivators, raising his chances to roughly one in a hundred, hope was still slim.  

For ten years since his transmigration, Qi Chuan had lived with uncertainty—did he have a spiritual root or not?  

If not, he would remain a mortal for life.  

Of course, even as a mortal, under the protection of the Qi Clan's cultivators, he could live safely, marry, have children, and eventually die of old age.  

But that was not what Qi Chuan desired.  

Fortunately, perhaps as a transmigrator, fate had granted him a sliver of fortune—at least he wasn’t left without a spiritual root.  

"But a lower eighth-grade spiritual root... that’s too low!"  

From what Qi Chuan knew, spiritual roots were divided into nine grades: upper (first to third grade), middle (fourth to sixth grade), and lower (seventh to ninth grade).  

An eighth-grade spiritual root wasn’t the worst, but it was close.  

This didn’t quite match his identity as a transmigrator.  

Shouldn’t a transmigrator awaken a first-grade spiritual root, shock the entire crowd, claim the championship of the Spirit Testing Ceremony, and then tread a smooth path straight to the pinnacle of the Dao?  

Maybe the testing formation was faulty...  

"Whatever, eighth-grade is still eighth-grade. At least I can cultivate immortality. With a bit—no, a lot—of luck, picking up opportunities here and there, eternal life isn’t impossible."  

Qi Chuan shook off his musings and accepted reality.  

But just then, a line of text slowly appeared before his eyes:  

**[Hundredfold Critical Strike loading: 0%]**  

"What’s this...?"  

Qi Chuan froze.  

A moment later, the number ticked up.  

**[Hundredfold Critical Strike loading: 1%]**  

"Oh, a golden finger!"  

After a pause, Qi Chuan realized what it was and smiled faintly.  

As everyone knew, transmigrators were supposed to have golden fingers—unless they were particularly unlucky.  

A lower eighth-grade spiritual root might not match his transmigrator status, but with this golden finger, everything balanced out.  

With this, eternal life was within reach!  

"Though it seems this golden finger needs some time to load. 'Hundredfold Critical Strike'... I wonder what kind of ability it’ll be?"  

Qi Chuan was curious.  

He hoped it would be a good one—preferably something that let him laze around without having to fight for his life. After all, the dangers of the cultivation world were legendary.  

The loading progress ticked up intermittently, advancing quickly. It would probably finish within half a day, and then he’d know its effects.  

With that in mind, Qi Chuan relaxed.  

He turned his attention back to the spirit-testing formation.  

The formation wasn’t large—the actual testing area could only accommodate a few people at a time.  

Beside Qi Chuan stood two other youths, both around ten years old, their faces filled with disappointment.  

Faint light still lingered around Qi Chuan, gradually fading, while the other two showed no reaction at all. Did they lack spiritual roots?  

"Qi Chuan, remain. The other two, leave."  

Sure enough, the Qi Clan’s immortal master, clad in Daoist robes with his hands behind his back, spoke coldly from nearby, sealing their fates.  

The two didn’t dare disobey. They bowed respectfully and left, dejected.  

Qi Chuan stepped out of the formation and stood to the side.  

He wasn’t the first to be tested. Another youth with a dark complexion was already waiting there.  

"Hello, fellow clansman. You have a spiritual root too, right?"  

Qi Chuan cupped his hands and asked curiously.  

"Elder Brother Qi Chuan, I am Qi Li, with only a lower ninth-grade spiritual root—far inferior to your eighth-grade. As fellow Qi Clan disciples, I hope you’ll look out for me in the future."  

Qi Li returned the greeting solemnly, addressing Qi Chuan as "elder brother" with a hint of envy in his eyes.  

"Ah... I’m Qi Chuan. Of course, we’ll look out for each other."  

Qi Chuan hesitated. Was there really much difference between eighth and ninth grade? Besides, they were both ten—who was to say who was older?  

The two fell into awkward silence, standing stiffly.  

The spirit-testing formation continued operating, testing three youths at a time. The immortal master’s voice rang out occasionally.  

"No spiritual roots. All dismissed."  

"All dismissed."  

"All dismissed."  

"Lower ninth-grade spiritual root. Remain."  

...  

"Elder Brothers, I am Qi Huo, lower ninth-grade spiritual root. As fellow Qi Clan disciples, I hope for your guidance in the future."  

Soon, another youth in black robes emerged from the formation and bowed to Qi Chuan and Qi Li.  

"Qi Li, lower ninth-grade. We’ll look out for each other," Qi Li replied with a nod.  

"Of course. I’m only lower eighth-grade, but eighth or ninth, it’s all the same. We’ll help each other," Qi Chuan also returned the courtesy.  

"Elder Brother has an eighth-grade spiritual root?!"  

Qi Huo’s eyes widened in surprise before he nodded and took his place beside them.  

Now, Qi Li and Qi Huo stood to Qi Chuan’s left and right, creating an unintentional impression that they were deferring to him.  

Qi Chuan glanced at them sidelong and felt uneasy.  

In the perilous world of cultivation, standing out was never wise. As the ancients said, "The tallest tree catches the wind."  

Frowning, he subtly retreated two steps, positioning himself behind the other two.  

Given Baishi Town’s size, there were at most a hundred or two ten-year-olds tested each year. With three tested at a time, the process concluded swiftly.  

Four more youths—boys and girls—emerged from the formation, all with lower ninth-grade spiritual roots.  

After brief introductions, they took their places, subtly forming a circle around Qi Chuan alongside Qi Li and Qi Huo.  

"What is this, the Seven Stars Formation?!"  

Qi Chuan, now encircled with no room to retreat, felt utterly speechless.  

He had thought his lower eighth-grade spiritual root was mediocre at best—surely, among so many test-takers, someone with a better root would overshadow him.  

Yet unexpectedly, he had ended up in first place!  

"Congratulations, Elder Brother Qi Chuan, for claiming the championship of the Spirit Testing Ceremony! When you rise to greatness, do not forget us!" Qi Li exclaimed earnestly, as if speaking from the heart.  

"Congratulations, Elder Brother Qi Chuan, for claiming the championship of the Spirit Testing Ceremony! When you rise to greatness, do not forget us!"  

Not to be outdone, Qi Huo quickly echoed the sentiment.  

The other four exchanged glances before joining in with their own congratulations.  

Qi Chuan fell silent, unsure how to respond.  

Were these people out of their minds?  

He scanned the crowd, desperately hoping another candidate would emerge—even a lower seventh-grade spiritual root would do, just to steal his thunder.  

But the testing was over. No more candidates remained.  

"Ah... I suppose I’m just too outstanding."  

With a sigh, Qi Chuan resigned himself to the situation.  

Nearby, the immortal master had already retrieved the formation and now observed the seven youths before him. His expression was unreadable—perhaps pleased, perhaps disappointed.  

On one hand, this year’s testing in Baishi Town had produced seven cultivators, a decent ratio compared to previous years.  

On the other hand, all were lower ninth-grade, with only one lower eighth-grade.  

True, those from influential families often had their spiritual roots tested privately at an earlier age, and those who showed exceptional promise in childhood were prioritized.  

But this batch was still disappointingly weak—not a single lower seventh-grade among them.  

These youths would likely struggle to even reach the middle stages of Qi Refinement.
