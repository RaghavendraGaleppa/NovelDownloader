# Chapter 596: The先天生灵Is Truly Extraordinary

The figure attempting to tear everything apart gradually became stiff.

Its soaring, defiant will, under the endless washing of the Zhoutian Stellar Force, the continuous erosion of the Eight Treasures' radiance, and the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi's refinement that targeted its very essence, was like stubborn iron repeatedly hammered by a heavy mallet. Its internal structure finally began to loosen, change, and then gradually submit.

One day, two days...

Until the fifth day.

When the demon ape's evil soul tried to凝聚 its power to strike again, the entire Star Spirit Banner space shook violently.

The Zhoutian stellar shadows lurking throughout the banner bloomed with light simultaneously, and all the scattered starlight was instantly sucked away as if by a giant, invisible mouth.

The momentum of the golden evil soul's charge visibly slowed, and the edges of its golden flame, ignited by pure, unyielding will, were stained with an indelible layer of cold stardust.

Ten days later, the demon ape's movements grew even more stiff, like a marionette. Every struggle was accompanied by a harsh friction of energy, as if the endless Eight Scenery Cloud Qi continued to pour into the Star Spirit Banner, causing the banner's surface to shine with starlight.

Looking at the demon ape inside the banner, constantly cursing and filled with pain, Xu Yunfan's expression was calm. He simply treated the Star Spirit Banner as a furnace for refining artifacts, continuously refining the demon ape.

He was not the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, and the Star Spirit Banner was not that alchemical furnace.

Xu Yunfan naturally would not let the demon ape he had obtained escape.

Twenty days later...

The Star Spirit Banner shook violently within.

The world inside the banner was no longer a chaotic tumult, but a terrifying, heavy suction.

The Zhoutian stellar shadows lurking throughout the banner, regardless of their size, erupted with unparalleled, intense brilliance at the same moment.

All the scattered, jumping energy that had dissipated from the冲击 was instantly swallowed by this irresistible force, like a hundred rivers returning to the sea.

One corner of the stellar river formed by the stellar souls of Yang Jian, Nezha, and Grand Unity Immortal became clear and transparent in an instant. The 365 stars, previously disturbed by the demon ape's charge, now subtly replaced chaos with order.

And the constantly, frantically struggling demon ape's soul, after this moment of extreme stillness, suddenly froze.

The last struggling ember of its flame, as if doused by merciless ice water, was completely extinguished, leaving only a lonely golden soul suspended in the void.

Sun Wukong's golden light dimmed a bit. Although it still carried a molten-gold texture, the inner, sky-piercing ferocity and unyielding spirit had been brutally broken and crushed under the day-and-night grinding of starlight and Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, like iron under a heavy hammer.

A visible dejection spread, replacing the once indomitable spirit.

The violent trembling of the Star Spirit Banner finally completely subsided.

Born with the world's spiritual fortune, the先天生灵 (先天生灵) are truly difficult to refine.

Xu Yunfan let out a long breath of turbid air. The seven-colored treasure lotus that had been hovering above his Dantian transformed into eight gentle, flowing lights, scattering and returning to sink back into his Dantian Qi Sea, turning into the purest Eight Scenery Cloud Qi.

The vast Eight Scenery Cloud Qi surging around his body gradually retracted, revealing his handsome but pale face.

Continuously and intensely activating the cloud qi to draw the Grand Unity Divine Thunder Talisman to suppress this world-shattering evil soul, even with a foundation as solid as his, his Dantian felt a hint of depletion and emptiness.

Even the vast spiritual power, aided by his attribute panel, felt as if it were about to dry up at this moment.

"It's finally done."

Xu Yunfan's gaze fell upon the Star Spirit Banner in his hand, which had become docile and heavy.

With a slight thought, a wisp of his divine sense entered the banner's space.

The scene had already stabilized. The Zhoutian stellar constellations were once again arranged, following profound trajectories as they slowly revolved. Occasionally, meteor-like lights shot through them—this was the manifestation of the Zhoutian Stellar Great Array cycle he had specifically arranged within the Star Spirit Banner.

Unfortunately, the array was still incomplete, as the full manual was still within the Primordial Sect.

After returning this time, with the contribution points he earned for being the vanguard, he should be able to exchange for it.

Inside the banner, Yang Jian, Nezha, and Grand Unity Immortal's souls were already linked by the stars, guarding their respective corners. Their auras rose and fell steadily, still carrying a hint of lingering fear and exhaustion from being previously impacted by the evil might, but they had stabilized.

Only at the core, a single golden light floated alone under a corner of the starry sky.

After being completely refined into a banner spirit, this demon ape was no longer in a roaring, battle-ready posture. Instead, it was crouching, hugging its knees, with its head, also a dark golden color, buried deep in its arms.

It had entered a state of depression.

It had managed to break out of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's alchemical furnace back in the day, yet now it had been turned into a banner spirit by a single Ten Thousand Soul Banner. This was truly unacceptable for the ape.

Its once divinely radiant eyes, which could see through everything, were now half-closed, leaving only two silent slits.

The ultimate defiance, a gift bestowed by the heavens of this world and unique to a先天圣灵, had its bones shattered, leaving only an empty silence, silently venting its unparalleled frustration and hatred.

It hated it!

But after being refined into a banner spirit ape, the Banner's didactic nature had naturally cleansed it.

A will that admitted defeat and submitted, acknowledging Xu Yunfan's control, transmitted from the ball of light, extremely weak yet incredibly clear.

Xu Yunfan didn't even need to deliberately sense it to be absolutely certain.

This monkey now acknowledged him as its master.

"Heh..."

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth couldn't help but curl up in a Nike-like smile.

His divine sense swept over the golden shadow huddled in a ball without any intention of comforting or persuading it. The more you comfort this kind of monkey, the more arrogant it becomes. It's better to let time smooth things over.

He then withdrew his divine sense without hesitation.

Once inside this world of the banner, one's life and freedom were no longer one's own to decide.

It struggled and it failed. The current sullenness is just the useless posture of a loser, not worth a laugh.

As for erasing its consciousness...

This kind of异种, favored by the world's creation, if its supreme natural endowments were to be erased and turned into a mindless combat puppet, that would be a true pity for Xu Yunfan.

He still hoped to refine this Star Spirit Banner into a spiritual treasure.

The Star Spirit Banner flashed and was put away deep into his sleeve.

Xu Yunfan raised his head to look at this once solemn and divine core of the heavens, which was now a scene of a sinking apocalypse.

The vast and boundless cloud palaces were now collapsing in large patches, continuously falling.

The jade steps and bridges that once flowed with auspicious light and rosy clouds were broken like枯骨, scattered among the shattered immortal gold and jade tiles.

Deep within the broken sea of clouds, the rules of space itself seemed to be cracking, with huge fissures spanning the sky like incurable wounds.

And within this realm filled with the cries of the fallen, several massive figures, like greedy vultures or feasting taoties, engaged in the most thorough plunder and division.

The most eye-catching was naturally the true lord of universal salvation, seated atop the firmament and manifesting his dharma form.

His spiritual power was blazing, and the flowing light, thicker than mercury, surged wantonly.

The light transformed into countless wriggling threads, deeply piercing the thickest earth of the heavenly core's heartland to absorb the realm's foundational qi.
