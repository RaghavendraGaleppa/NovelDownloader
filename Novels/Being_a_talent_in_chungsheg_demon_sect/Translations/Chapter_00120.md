# The Ferocious True Disciples

In the Star Realm Heaven, on a desolate wilderness.

An earthy-yellow light surged, and the formerly flat ground suddenly rippled like waves. Then, a vessel slowly emerged.

Deep within the vessel, Guanghai stood with his hands behind his back, meditating and adjusting his breath.

At the same time, Guangming quickly walked over, taking out a scroll: “Senior Brother, the disciples below have already forged twelve formation diagrams.”

“How is it only twelve?”

Guanghai took the scroll, frowning. “This concerns the encirclement and suppression of demonic cultivators and the promotion of the righteous path. Didn’t we previously set the rule to forge thirty-six formation diagrams?”

Guangming replied with a helpless, bitter smile: “Of the thirty-six formation diagrams, the original plan was for ten of them to be forged by the disciples of the Dragon Division. As you know, Senior Brother, combined with your request to act earlier, time was limited. Twelve formation diagrams are already the limit.”

“Are you implying it’s my fault?” Guanghai narrowed his eyes.

“How could it be!”

Guangming immediately straightened his expression. “I meant that the other disciples were truly too indolent. I, your junior brother, will go urge them immediately and strive to forge a few more!”

Guanghai nodded, satisfied.

According to the plan previously discussed with the Dao Court, they should have proceeded cautiously, using a vast number of formations to trap and suffocate the Saint Sect in this area.

However, the situation had changed. Since someone among the Saint Sect disciples had cultivated the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*, Guanghai no longer intended to follow the original plan. What if that demonic cultivator who practiced the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* was killed by the Dao Court? He immediately ordered the Pure Land disciples to act ahead of schedule.

In his view, they already had victory firmly in hand.

Because Guangming had not revealed Lü Yang’s strength, although Guanghai was alarmed and enraged by the complete annihilation of the Dragon Division, he did not find it unbelievable.

After all, that was the Initial Saint Sect.

And based on Guanghai’s judgment, even if the Initial Saint Sect could annihilate the Dragon Division, they must have suffered significant losses themselves. How could they possibly contend against the combined might of the Eightfold Buddhist Host?

Furthermore, under the joint scheme of the Dao Court and the Pure Land, the Saint Sect had lost nearly a third of its disciples almost immediately upon entering the realm heaven. Two of their seven true disciples had died, one of whom Guanghai had personally slain. Although they were indeed somewhat formidable, they weren’t as powerful as rumored.

Thinking of this, Guanghai grew even more confident:

“They say the Saint Sect is ruthless, but I think they’re nothing special. Once I seize the initiative this time and achieve great merit, I can also make a grand impression before the Bodhisattva…”

Just then, Guanghai’s spiritual sense suddenly jolted.

The next second, a loud bang erupted from the land-traversing vessel beneath Guanghai’s feet, suddenly halting its movement as if it had run aground. The treasured light around it violently shook!

“…What’s happening?”

Guanghai immediately communicated with the artifact spirit of the land-traversing vessel. He then heard a pained cry for help: “Someone… something is attacking me!”

“What?”

Guanghai was momentarily stunned. Then, as if sensing something, he looked up. Almost simultaneously, all the Pure Land Buddhist cultivators within the land-traversing vessel also looked towards the sky above. They saw a streak of spiritual light pierce the void and surge forth—a black shuttle—which then burst open above their heads!

The next second, a host of Saint Sect disciples poured out!

Five true disciples, seven peak Qi Condensation cultivators, and dozens of late Qi Condensation cultivators, all with malevolent grins and a soaring killing aura, instantly enveloped a large portion of the sky!

Only at this moment did Guanghai react.

But even having reacted, he remained utterly incredulous. The demonic cultivators were actively attacking? They weren’t planning to hold their ground; instead, they were striking first!?

“Everyone, get out of the way!”

The first to attack was the Flood Dragon Daoist. He split his lips into a wide grin and directly tore off his daoist robe. His seemingly normal flesh and blood instantly expanded explosively!

In a flash, his left hand grew densely packed scales, his five fingers fused together, transforming into two soaring dragon horns, and his palm split open, revealing sharp, stark white teeth, actually forming a ferocious dragon head… His other organs also transformed.

His intestines burst from his belly, turning into a dragon tail.

His remaining limbs and fifth appendage became dragon claws, and his head retracted, embedding itself like an inverse scale behind the dragon head. With each breath, monstrous blood energy surged forth.

He had truly transformed into a dragon!

Or rather, something that looked very much like a dragon, yet both the piled-up mass of flesh and the vast but chaotic blood energy were filled with intense诡谲 (诡谲 - grotesque/eerie strangeness).

“Hahahahaha!”

The next second, the evil flood dragon rode a blood cloud and slammed directly into the land-traversing vessel. The dragon head let out a long roar, and the heavens and earth were instantly filled with a single, ferocious bellow.

Boom!

In an instant, the land-traversing vessel suffered a heavy blow, its treasured light almost shattering. The lower-cultivation Buddhist cultivators within the vessel clutched their ears in pain.

At the same time, the other four true disciples followed closely.

“Holy Monks, do I look beautiful?”

Bifeiyuan descended into the land-traversing vessel and, without a word, tore off her outer robes. The thin veil fell, and a body of pristine white immediately entered everyone’s vision.

All the Buddhist cultivators who witnessed this sight instantly felt dazed and disoriented, finding it difficult to uphold their precepts. Their vital essence was instantly drained clean, followed by their blood energy, and finally, even their souls were drawn out.

*Thump! Thump! Thump!*

In an instant, more than ten Buddhist cultivators collapsed to the ground, their faces still wearing blissful expressions.

Additionally, dozens of other Buddhist cultivators, though they managed to close their eyes in time, found it difficult to dispel their inner demons. They could only retreat while silently chanting scriptures to suppress their carnal desires.

*Pfft!*

The next second, Xu Xin’s figure subtly emerged, stabbing one of the Buddhist cultivators who was suppressing his inner demons in the back before eerily vanishing.

Every time he reappeared, he took another Buddhist cultivator’s life.

Chongming, however, was the complete opposite. He disdained hiding his form, transforming into a streak of sword light and charging into the crowd, where he rampaged indiscriminately.

“Kill all these baldies!”

At the same time, the remaining Saint Sect disciples also descended from the sky, directly charging into the land-traversing vessel to engage in one-on-one combat with the Buddhist cultivators.

“Holy Monks, why won’t you look at me?”

Bifeiyuan moved with lightning speed, creating a storm of blood while continuously uttering soft whispers: “Since you preach universal salvation, why not save me?”

“What talk of royal power and riches, what fear of precepts and rules…”

“Holy Monks, I’m here to help you cultivate…”

Just then, Guanghai, located in the deepest part of the land-traversing vessel, finally made his move.

“Fiends!!!”

His mouth uttered boundless Buddhist chants, his sermon was like thunder: “Should I achieve Buddhahood, if any celestial or human in my realm holds onto thoughts of carnal desire, then I shall not attain Supreme Enlightenment!”

Where the thunderous voice passed, the Buddhist cultivators did not cling to ego; thus, there was no self. Without self, there was no greed, hatred, or delusion, nor was there birth or death. The myriad desires aroused by Bifeiyuan instantly dissipated. Even when they looked at Bifeiyuan’s bare form again, their eyes were incomparably clear, showing not a trace of wavering.

Seeing this, Bifeiyuan’s pretty face instantly darkened:

“Hmph, that’s why I hate baldies…”

Without Bifeiyuan’s interference, the Buddhist cultivators, having recovered, quickly reformed their formation. Streaks of Buddhist light soared into the sky, manifesting into formidable Vajra Dharma Bodies.

“Amitabha…”

Inside the land-traversing vessel, Guanghai’s expression was grim: “With the Dragon Division gone, the Eightfold Buddhist Host is incomplete. Otherwise, these demonic cultivators would have come today and never returned!”

The Eightfold Buddhist Host, with hundreds of Qi Condensation Buddhist cultivators working together, could construct eight Vajra Dharma Bodies.

And if these eight Vajra Dharma Bodies were to merge again, they could borrow an Arhat status comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Pure Land, which was the Pure Land’s ultimate trump card.

But now, due to the complete annihilation of the Dragon Division, this trump card was largely rendered useless.

Although he still had a way to remedy it, the cost was too great, and he was unwilling to use it unless absolutely necessary. Fortunately, the situation was still within his control.

“Seven Vajra Dharma Bodies are enough, though.”

Guanghai sneered coldly: “While this surprise attack and breakout is ingenious, it is ultimately futile. Today, all of you shall be buried here…”

However, just then, Guanghai’s eye twitched.

He was currently in the deepest part of the land-traversing vessel, protected by multiple layers of formations, yet he felt a sharp, sword-like gaze fall upon him.

“…Not good!”

The moment he sensed the gaze, Guanghai immediately wanted to recall the Eightfold Buddhist Host to protect himself.

However, it was too late!

Outside the land-traversing vessel, high in the sky.

Lü Yang trod the void, his eyes indifferent, silently calculating with his hands. The moment Guanghai detected his gaze, he sharply curled his lips:

“Found you.”

The next second, he plunged downwards!

Almost simultaneously, Guanghai felt an immense magical power smash through multiple layers of defenses, like mountains collapsing and heaven and earth overturning, pressing directly before him!
