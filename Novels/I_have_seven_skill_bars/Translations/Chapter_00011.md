# Chapter 11: Bee Cultivator

“Valley Flowers are very basic medicinal ingredients, used in conjunction with Spirit Rice to refine Bigu Pills. When the sect refines certain items, the spiritual energy is extracted from the Spirit Rice. The remaining residue, combined with Valley Flowers, can then be used to refine Bigu Pills.”

Along the way, Li Yizhen explained the purpose of Valley Flowers to Ding Rui: “Actually, under normal circumstances, Valley Flowers aren't that prone to large aphid infestations. It's quite difficult for aphids to survive in them, and their growth rate is slower. We cultivators in the Spirit Fields generally don't need to bother with them; some losses are perfectly acceptable. But these past few days, after hearing that you, Senior Brother, can exterminate large aphids, we've decided that every so often, when the large aphids in the flowers become numerous, we'd like you to deal with them for us all at once. This way, when the Valley Flowers mature, our harvest will increase significantly, and we'll also receive more rewards. Of course, the price will still be 50 grains per stalk, Senior Brother Ding, rest assured.”

“I see…” Ding Rui mumbled perfunctorily, but his mind was on Bigu Pills.

Before he became a cultivator, this was what he ate.

Bigu Pills were the most common food for sect cultivators, especially those in the Spirit Fields. Spirit Rice was mainly used for extracting spiritual energy; it wasn't filling enough to eat directly. Thus, Bigu Pills were naturally very important. Bigu Pills contained no spiritual energy; they purely served to fill one's stomach. Therefore, they didn't need to be purchased; the sect distributed them freely and in ample supply.

Ding Rui, however, was thinking.

Could he refine Bigu Pills?

After all, he had a skill panel!

Even if Bigu Pills weren't valuable, weren't there other elixirs?

Ding Rui could tell these girls were indeed a bit anxious. Without further ado, he lifted his foot and walked in.

“Please lead the way.”

A large group of people began the pest extermination.

Exterminating pests in Valley Flowers was largely no different from doing so in Spirit Rice, except that the Golden Ray Spear felt a bit clunkier. Ding Rui quickly wiped out the insects thoroughly and moved on to the next plant.

The female cultivators waiting behind immediately rushed to the first plant. One of them, a cultivator of the "Golden Ray Technique," began channeling her true essence to inspect it. A moment later, she opened her eyes, her face beaming with joy: “They're really gone!”

The other female cultivators instantly became overjoyed, and their expressions towards Ding Rui changed drastically. Hearing about an impossible event happening was still different from witnessing one firsthand.

“I didn't quite believe it before, but I can't believe it's actually true.”

“Yeah, and he's so fast. I'm not even that quick at killing aphids.”

“Senior Brother Ding is a genius cultivating the 'Golden Ray Technique.' How can you compare?”

“It's still Zhenzhen's credit. If Brother Zhenzhen hadn't passed on the news, we might not have known about this.”

However, what filled him even more was shock.

This was a bee!

And it was a bee that could talk!

What was going on?

Ding Rui squinted, about to take a closer look, when Li Yizhen beside him had already begun to introduce it: “This is our Spirit Field's Bee Cultivator, named Mi. We call her Sister Mi. With Sister Mi's help, our Valley Flowers in the Spirit Fields will be much safer, undisturbed by anything other than aphids, and she can also produce incredibly delicious honey.”

As she spoke of honey, Li Yizhen involuntarily swallowed. It was clear it was indeed very delicious.

But Ding Rui noticed a detail.

Li Yizhen referred to it as “it,” not “them”!

“Don't bees live in colonies?” Ding Rui wondered, full of doubt, and couldn't help but ask, “Is there only one Bee Cultivator in the Spirit Fields?”

“Of course!” Li Yizhen nodded.
