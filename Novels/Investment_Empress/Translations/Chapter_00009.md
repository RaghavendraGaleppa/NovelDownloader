# Chapter 9: Li Mo: "I'm Afraid I'm a Fake Disciple," and Co-habitation with the Ice Block

"Ah? You two youngsters, aren't you a couple?"

Old Qian was stunned. He had heard they were childhood sweethearts, entered the Qingyuan Sect together, and were both True Disciples. Ying Bing had even specifically told Li Mo to move in with her today; they were already cohabiting. In this day and age, who among ordinary acquaintances would share a room?

"Uh..." Li Mo hadn't spoken yet when Ying Bing's voice already rang out beside him:

"No." Her tone was casual, yet listening to it made one feel a chill.

"You've misunderstood," Li Mo quickly waved his hands.

Then both of them fell silent. The atmosphere in the hall became somewhat awkward for a moment.

"I'm getting on in years, I tend to gossip, please forgive me." Qian Bufan chuckled, smacked his lips, and even looked a little disappointed.

Li Mo let out a bitter laugh, withdrawing his gaze from Ying Bing. Was the Ice Block beautiful? Describing her as a beauty that could topple cities and states would be no exaggeration. But... she was too cold. Cold in both personality and physically. Thinking of this, Li Mo couldn't help but sigh. For this cold childhood sweetheart, pity was a more fitting emotion than admiration. In his memories, she wasn't like this initially; it was after a change in her family that she became this way. In her shoes, Li Mo admitted he couldn't be optimistic and gentle either.

Across from him, Ying Bing shook her head almost imperceptibly. Heaven and Earth are ruthless, the martial path is long. In her previous life, countless extraordinary individuals had pursued her. But if she hadn't severed her seven emotions and six desires, fully concentrating on swimming upstream in the long river of martial arts, she wouldn't have reached the pinnacle. In this life, she similarly maintained an unwavering heart dedicated to the Dao.

Qiushui Pavilion was located not far from Qunyu Peak. Nestled by mountains and water, its scenery was beautiful. The pavilion stood three stories high, complete with an attached courtyard, through which a clear spring flowed. It was rustic and elegant, yet lost none of its natural beauty, standing out among the other pavilions.

At this moment, the main gate of Qiushui Pavilion was opened. The two walked in, one after the other, the young man laden with bags and bundles.

"This residence is well-built," Li Mo said, very satisfied with the new living environment and feeling a touch of emotion. Before, Ying Bing had stayed at the Li Estate, living under someone else's roof. Now, it was the other way around. He turned his head, only to see Ying Bing staring at the courtyard, lost in thought.

"It seems no one has lived here for a long time; let's clean it up first," Li Mo said, looking around. He walked around everywhere but couldn't find any cleaning tools.

Ying Bing suddenly said, "The broom is under the stone stool by the flower pond."

Li Mo bent down and indeed found a broom.

"Go boil some hot water," Ying Bing said naturally, tying up her dark hair with a ribbon. As if she had lived there for a long time, she seamlessly took on the role of the mistress of Qiushui Pavilion. She wasn't doing it on purpose, but in her every movement while sweeping, there was an air of composure, as if she had long been in a high position.

"Well, I've become the diligent little maid," Li Mo pouted, then saluted: "Obeying orders from above." Although he knew the Ice Block had always been like this, why did he still feel a bit unwilling? Hmm, as a male with strong self-esteem, this was quite normal.

Steaming hot water was ready and poured by Li Mo into a large mahogany tub.

[Congratulations, Host, you have successfully invested in a tub of bathwater, helping the investment target clean their body.]
[Investment Feedback received: One gold bar.]

The gold bars given by the system were always substantial. Li Mo was silent for a moment, then shouted into the courtyard: "One tub of bathwater isn't enough, is it? I'll boil some more for you!"

***

Night fell.

The next day, Li Mo woke up as usual, glanced at the frozen-solid next-door room, and slipped into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. His widespread investments recently had provided him with many strange feedbacks, including a good amount of food that could be eaten simply by heating it up.

When the sun had fully risen, Li Mo came out with soybean milk and steamed buns; the Ice Block was already sitting there. Her lips were still bloodless, and her face was as white as snow. "Beautiful and freezing" was the most apt description for her.

Not long after breakfast, a vigorous shout came from outside: "Is Martial Niece Ying Bing here!"

The door opened. An old man sat on an ancient, grand carriage. The four eaves of the carriage were carved with the Four Symbols, exquisitely crafted yet appearing naturally simple.

"I am the Sect Master's carriage driver," the old man said with a beaming smile, "By the Sect Master's order, I am here to guide Martial Niece up the mountain. In the future, I will also be the one to pick you up. There are many buildings on Qingyuan Peak, so I worry you might not find your way."

"Hmph, the Sect Master's carriage," Li Mo thought, "no wonder it looked so imposing. See, *this* is the treatment a True Disciple gets. He'd probably have to walk up the mountain."

"Thank you," Ying Bing nodded, and after getting into the carriage, she lifted the curtain and said: "Li Mo, before you go to Qunyu Peak, you can prepare a few pots of good wine."

With that said, the carriage sped away, leaving a trail of dust.
