# Chapter 25: Puppet Guardians and the Divine Flame Giant's Dao Rhyme

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

In the small courtyard.

Zhang Jing repeatedly inspected the flying sword and Water Cloud Shield in his hands to ensure they wouldn't fail him during today's trial. Then he checked the spell fish swimming in his Five Elements Spiritual River.

Only after confirming all preparations were complete did he take a deep breath, push open the door, and head toward the Inheritance Pavilion.

The roads were unusually quiet today. Along the way, Zhang Jing encountered many fellow disciples, all walking in silence with solemn expressions.

Before long, his footsteps echoed as he arrived at the plaza before the Inheritance Pavilion.

With a quick glance, he estimated over three hundred new disciples had joined the Dragon Lake Dao Academy this time—talents selected from millions of eligible youths across Nanli Kingdom's thirteen provinces.

Beyond the crowd, ten square stone platforms rose in the plaza's center—each about ten zhang long and wide, standing over a zhang tall. Arranged in a circular formation, their surfaces shimmered with indestructible blue light. Further out stood over a dozen towering stone pillars and numerous smaller platforms with neatly arranged meditation cushions.

Many senior brothers and sisters in green robes already occupied these cushions, watching the newcomers with curious or expectant gazes. Zhang Jing guessed they represented various outer court mission teams.

As the sun rose, beams of light suddenly shot from the Inheritance Pavilion, landing on the giant stone pillars and filling the area with overwhelming spiritual pressure. The previously bustling plaza fell silent instantly.

"Junior brothers and sisters," announced Senior Brother Liu in purple robes, appearing at the plaza's center. "I declare the ranking assessment officially begun. First, the rules for the qualification trial."

All eyes turned toward him.

"The rules are simple. There are ten demonstration platforms. No restrictions on spells or magic tools. Survive thirty breaths against the platform's guardian puppet, and you pass. Fail, and you're eliminated."

With a wave of his sleeve, ten streaks of light flew out, transforming into black-iron humanoid puppets that landed on the platforms, exuding icy auras.

"In sixty breaths, I'll call names for platform assignments," Senior Brother Liu concluded, closing his eyes.

The crowd surged toward the platforms like a tidal wave. As Zhang Jing moved, he felt someone tug his sleeve—Ji Bochang.

"Brother Ji?"

"Shall we go together, Brother Zhang?"

"Excellent."

When time came, Senior Brother Liu opened his eyes, holding a jade slip.

"Li Cheng, first platform. Wu Wenxuan, second platform..."

Names rang out continuously. Those called wore bitter expressions as they trudged onto their assigned platforms.

Zhang Jing watched as a young man slowly ascended one platform. The puppet opposite him suddenly raised its head, glowing with activated spell patterns. In a blur, it appeared before the youth and struck with a fist that tore the air with a piercing shriek.

Boom!

The young man flew backward before he could react, crashing down with a caved-in chest. Gasps erupted around Zhang Jing.

A purple-robed figure rose from a stone pillar, sending a white light that healed the youth's injuries at terrifying speed—true flesh-from-bones regeneration.

Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed. These puppets were formidable—most probably wouldn't clear this round.

"Those puppets are forged from Cold Yin Iron, indestructible with inscribed restrictions," Ji Bochang whispered. "Their weakest combat power matches third-level Qi Refining cultivators. But the inner court seniors must have limited them, or that strike would've shattered that man."

"Your senior sister told you this?" Zhang Jing asked.

"Naturally," Ji Bochang nodded. "You can buy this information at the Thousand Methods Pavilion—cheapest costs sixty merit points."

Time flew, nearing noon. Thanks to the puppets' brutal efficiency, the first round approached its end. Yet the atmosphere grew increasingly heated as several B-grade talents took the stage, displaying abilities far beyond their C and D-grade peers.

Some wielded formidable magic tools, others unleashed powerful spells—not only enduring the puppets' attacks but occasionally counterattacking, drawing gasps from the crowd.

A disheveled Ji Bochang returned to Zhang Jing's side. "Brother Zhang, be careful. These puppets are ridiculously tough—hard to damage, yet their attacks are overwhelming."

"Thank you for the warning," Zhang Jing replied calmly.

"Zhang Jing, ninth platform," Senior Brother Liu announced.

"My turn." Zhang Jing smiled and strode forward under everyone's gaze.

The crowd watched this unfamiliar figure ascend the platform, recognizing another B-grade talent. All eyes fixed on the stage.

Zhang Jing took deep breaths, blocking out all noise as his focus locked onto the puppet.

One step forward—triggering the mechanism.

The puppet's head snapped up, hollow eyes fixing on Zhang Jing as intricate spell patterns lit up across its body, unleashing a wave of violent spiritual energy.

In the next instant, the puppet crossed its fists and leaped high, descending like a sledgehammer wreathed in killing intent—fast as black lightning!

The wind from its movement stung Zhang Jing's face like needles. Without any spells, the puppet's indestructible body combined with extreme speed made this strike more terrifying than most magic.

Perfect!

Zhang Jing's hand flashed to his storage pouch. The Water Cloud Shield materialized instantly between him and the puppet. As he channeled spiritual energy, the shield's black glow intensified.

Boom!

The collision reverberated across the plaza, drawing widespread attention. The shield's light flickered precariously but held.

Seeing its attack blocked, the puppet's eyes flashed. It gripped the shield and pivoted its entire body, using it as leverage to whip toward Zhang Jing behind it.

An even stronger spiritual wave erupted from the puppet.

This move surprised Zhang Jing, but he remained calm. With a zing, his flying sword shot out, its blade wreathed in condensed black energy that met the puppet's strike.

Clang! Metal clashed as Zhang Jing blocked again, forcing the puppet to retreat.

Now it was Zhang Jing's turn to attack.

Two exchanges had revealed the puppet's strength—second-level Qi Refining, likely matching his own cultivation. Perfect for practice!

His虚幻心眼 (Illusory Mind's Eye) opened. The flying sword blazed, becoming a streak of light that tore through air to slash at the puppet.

Boom! The heavy strike sent the puppet staggering. Ignoring the sword, it charged again—only to be smashed in the face by the Water Cloud Shield.

Under Zhang Jing's control, the two tools alternated between aggressive assaults and steady defenses. Insights into tool manipulation flooded him, making his control increasingly fluid.

The coordinated offense and defense wove an impenetrable net around the puppet.

At the twenty-seventh breath, Zhang Jing finally hammered the puppet off the platform.

Silence.

"Zhang Jing, passed," Senior Brother Liu announced, breaking the stillness.

Zhang Jing retrieved his tools and descended calmly.

On the tenth platform nearby, Wu Mingyuan desperately blocked the puppet's storm-like attacks, his first-level Qi Refining energy nearly exhausted.

"Five breaths... four... three..." he counted, vision darkening.

"Wu Mingyuan, passed," came the verdict like heavenly music. The puppet deactivated as Wu Mingyuan collapsed, gasping for air.

His gaze fell on Zhang Jing's retreating figure and the defeated puppet, feeling sudden relief: Thank goodness I apologized back then, or else...

On an outer platform:

"Junior brother, is that the Zhang Jing who rejected your invitation?"

"Indeed, senior brother."

"B-grade talent, calm in battle, excellent tactical choices—a fine seedling. After rankings, invite him again for our Hundred Rivers team."

"But senior brother, he already refused—"

"Then improve the offer! Refusals just mean we didn't meet his expectations."

"Reduce the merit point commission?"

"That rule stays. Find other incentives."

"Brother Zhang... you've reached second-level Qi Refining?!" Ji Bochang stared in shock.

"Just luck," Zhang Jing modestly replied.

Ji Bochang's expression turned complicated. In less than a month, he'd watched Zhang Jing progress from trailing behind to surpassing him—it felt unreal.

For a moment, he wondered if Zhang Jing might rival the two A-grade monsters.

"Chen Xiandao, first platform!" Senior Brother Liu's voice drew all attention, including Zhang Jing's, toward the central platform.

Outer platform observers perked up at the name.

On the stage stood a brawny, bald youth whose spiritual energy radiated like a volcano ready to erupt—one of the two A-grade prodigies.

Zhang Jing finally saw this legendary figure who'd trained exclusively on the top-ranked Panlong Team's island.

The puppet blurred forward.

Chen Xiandao straightened, suddenly exuding an aura like a giant propping up the heavens as fiery red patterns covered his body.

One punch met the puppet's attack head-on.

Boom! The puppet went flying.

"Chen Xiandao, passed."

"Did you see that?!" Ji Bochang exclaimed, face distorted by shock.

"I saw," Zhang Jing replied, eyes alight with excitement.

Through his Mind's Eye, he'd glimpsed it—a wisp of profound Dao Rhyme around Chen Xiandao's fist, revealing a vision of a colossal deity wreathed in crimson flames.

Now he was certain: top-grade cultivation methods were connected to Dao Rhyme!
