# Chapter 30: The Mountain Collision Scripture  

"Spirit Armament—isn't this just armed spirit energy?"  

Jiang Li once again channeled his spiritual energy to cover his right hand. This time, the surface of his palm quickly darkened, hardening at a speed far surpassing before. His hardened hand gripped the blade of a sword, producing a metallic clang. As he gradually increased the pressure, the well-crafted sword bent under his grasp.  

With these two effects combined, his defenses were becoming increasingly formidable.  

Perhaps he could consider developing toward the path of a body cultivator.  

Having made up his mind, Jiang Li threw himself back into his busy routine.  

Daily cultivation, practicing techniques, attending lectures at the Transmission Hall, exploring the outer sect's burial grounds, and now adding alchemy studies to the mix—perhaps even incorporating body cultivation training...  

Jiang Li barely had a moment to rest, his days packed with relentless activity.  

---  

A month and a half later, at the cliffs on the outskirts of the outer sect.  

**Boom!—Boom!—Boom!**  

Every few breaths, a deep, resonant impact echoed from the cliffside.  

The rocky surface cracked under the repeated collisions, fine fissures spreading until the outermost layer of stone could no longer endure the strain, crumbling away in a cascade.  

The figure beneath the cliff was buried beneath the falling debris, but soon, the rubble trembled as a young man with skin blackened and gleaming burst free from the pile.  

It was none other than Jiang Li.  

In the world of cultivation, the mainstream view frowned upon dual cultivation paths.  

The path of immortality was long and boundless, with no known limits—no one had ever reached its peak. How could one afford to split their focus or waste time?  

Most cultivators disapproved of practicing multiple techniques simultaneously.  

If it were a soul-refining technique that could accelerate cultivation, then of course, the more the better. But such techniques were exceedingly rare—barely a handful existed in the entire cultivation world.  

As for body cultivation techniques? They were notorious for being weak in the early stages and slow to progress later on—utterly impractical.  

Typically, only those with innate talent for body cultivation or access to specialized Buddhist methods—like those of the "Compassionate Ferry Temple"—would delve into it.  

Most cultivators only turned to it when they hit a bottleneck, using it to shore up weaknesses and bolster their strength.  

But after careful consideration, Jiang Li decided to pursue a body cultivation technique alongside his primary cultivation of the *Ghost Wood Scripture*.  

---  

The reason was simple: his status panel granted him numerous body-enhancing buffs, all percentage-based. For him, the benefits of body cultivation far outweighed those for others.  

Those permanent buffs were essentially innate talents.  

Not only did he possess a natural aptitude for body cultivation, but he could also further enhance his physical gifts. Under such circumstances, *not* cultivating his body would be a waste.  

Thus, Jiang Li sought the help of Senior Sister Xiao Si, an inner sect disciple, to escort him into the inner sect's Scripture Pavilion to select a suitable body cultivation technique.  

It should be noted that while outer sect disciples in the Hidden Scripture Valley had access to the Scripture Pavilion, entering the inner sect was no simple matter.  

Normally, they needed approval from either the Transmission Hall Elder or the Outer Sect Affairs Elder.  

But if Jiang Li had told them he wanted to pursue body cultivation—risking biting off more than he could chew—he’d have been lucky to escape without a scolding.  

So he turned to the approachable Senior Sister Xiao Si, who helped him bypass the guarding disciples and reach the Scripture Pavilion.  

After careful deliberation, he settled on an ancient body cultivation manual—*The Mountain Collision Scripture*—though it was only a fragment, containing techniques up to the Foundation Establishment stage.  

Body cultivation techniques were far easier to switch between than qi cultivation methods, so Jiang Li didn’t hesitate much.  

He paid a staggering **230 spirit stones**—more than half of his hard-earned earnings from three months of trial alchemy—to obtain it.  

The remaining portion had already been handed over to Yan Hong to procure supplies, leaving Jiang Li utterly penniless once again.  

He stepped back, putting distance between himself and the cliff face, then crossed his arms over his chest, muscles bulging. With a running start, he drove his shoulder into the rock with tremendous force.  

**Boom!**  

Another deafening impact, and the cliffside cracked further.  

*The Mountain Collision Scripture* was said to have been inspired by an ancient beast known as the "Mountain-Shattering Ape." At its peak, practitioners could supposedly collide with and shatter entire mountains.  

But at Jiang Li’s current level, it merely increased his strength and toughened his physique.  

After several more collisions, he concluded today’s training, dispersing his spirit energy and allowing his darkened skin to return to normal.  

"Junior Brother, you’ve trained for two hours today. Since it’s less than three, we’ll charge you for three. That’ll be **one spirit stone**."  

Jiang Li was speechless. All he’d done was ram into a cliff a few times, and they were charging him a spirit stone? They might as well rob him outright.  

But since other areas of the outer sect forbade irreversible damage, he had no choice but to pay for the privilege.  

After handing over the spirit stone, he left the training area.  

---  

"Have you heard? One of this year’s new disciples has already reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement!"  

"Really? They’ve only been here for half a year!"  

"Yes, just broke through a couple of days ago. Even the Transmission Hall Elder praised them."  

"That kind of talent… it’s almost on par with the inner sect geniuses."  

"No kidding. The elder said that while they might not make it this year, they could very well enter the inner sect through next year’s outer sect competition."  

"Tch… Meanwhile, we’ve been stuck in the early stage of Qi Refinement for over two years. We’ll probably never leave the outer sect..."  

As Jiang Li walked through the bustling outer sect market, he overheard many such conversations.  

Among his peers, there was likely only one person who could achieve such rapid progress.  

He found Yan Hong’s stall and confirmed it—**Yu Banxia** had broken through to mid-stage Qi Refinement two days prior.  

Now, he was stabilizing his cultivation and adapting to his newfound strength. In a few more days, he’d likely reach out to them.
