# Chapter 17: When Others Fear, I Buy More

Zhao Xuhe knew perfectly well that the Substitute Yin Puppet had by now become a complete bubble, ready to burst and completely collapse at any moment. But he believed that with his keen perception, he could definitely exit the market in time.

So when Lu Yang contacted him, saying he had already exited and wanted to repay the 2000 contribution points he had borrowed, Zhao Xuhe still felt sorry for him.

"Hasty, Junior Brother, you're too hasty!"

"Don't you see the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet is still rising? This is before the war has even started; when the war truly begins, that's when demand will truly outstrip supply! While it hasn't risen too much yet, I suggest you buy it back quickly."

Facing Zhao Xuhe's strong persuasion, Lu Yang remained rational. Although he was also envious of the soaring Substitute Yin Puppets and even regretted selling them so early, he understood Zhao Xuhe's reasons for trying to persuade him now.

Caring for him? Don't be foolish, he just wanted to pull people into the market! After all, the more people who entered, the more opportunities he would have to cash out and exit.

"Hold it, I'm not in a hurry."

"In this life, I'll first observe the situation, confirm the peak price, and then repeat the operation in my next life. That's when I'll have the best chance to make a huge profit. With the [Book of Hundred Lives], I will only profit and never lose!"

Thinking of this, Lu Yang's mood instantly became much more balanced. He settled the loan with Zhao Xuhe directly, then immediately went into secluded cultivation, no longer bothering with the outside world.

***

Just as Lu Yang entered secluded cultivation, the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet continued to soar. This was because the Prime Saint Sect had truly made moves to prepare for war! Large numbers of disciples received transfer orders, leaving the sect one after another, their destinations unknown. In such circumstances, it was naturally impossible for the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet to fall in the slightest.

No matter how expensive, those who were about to go to the war between the righteous and demonic factions could only grit their teeth and buy them. After all, money could be earned again, but a life was only one.

In this situation, more and more people chose to enter the market. Most of them were not even ordinary disciples, but true scions of influential families. Compared to ordinary disciples, these family scions came from prestigious clans, their elders at least Foundation Establishment True Persons. The contribution points they could use were undoubtedly much higher than those of ordinary disciples. Therefore, after they entered the market, the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet, which had shown signs of slowing down, took off again.

Three thousand, four thousand, five thousand...

Evidently, this price was no longer on the same level as the actual value of the Substitute Yin Puppet. Some people even began to exit the market out of fear. In this situation, the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet naturally began to fall. Similar panic gradually spread, yet more people, especially those who had experienced the first dip, remained full of confidence.

"Don't panic, this is just a technical adjustment!"

"Selling off? It's still too early!"

This time, Zhao Xuhe felt he had learned his lesson. Previously, he had exited the market too early, and as a result, not only did he not profit from his second entry, but he also suffered a small loss. How could he possibly suffer the same loss twice?

"The war between the righteous and demonic factions hasn't even started yet, and the supply of Substitute Yin Puppets on the market is still plentiful, so at first glance, the price seems to have peaked. But once the fighting begins, Substitute Yin Puppets will inevitably be consumed in large quantities, and with no other equivalent substitutes, everyone will still have to come back and buy them!"

"At that time, the price will surely see a third surge! What's a mere five thousand contribution points? Seven thousand, or even ten thousand, is possible! It will be priced but unavailable, and since lives are at stake, everyone will have to sell their assets to buy them!"

Zhao Xuhe felt his analysis was flawless. "So, while those fools are selling out of fear... I'm going to buy more!"

Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe not only invested all his savings but even took out a large loan, relying on the reputation of the Three Rivers Guild. He went all-in.

Zhao Xuhe was naturally not the only "smart" one; others also made the same judgment as him and began to massively sweep up goods in the market, seizing the opportunity. Affected by this, the price, which had just fallen, began to rebound. Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe, who had originally felt a bit unsure, instantly felt as if he had swallowed a calming pill, believing his decision to go all-in was truly wise.

Then, early the next morning, a voice directly from Saint Fire Cliff instantly spread throughout the Prime Saint Sect.

"Recently, the True Monarch of our sect personally made arrangements, openly mobilizing disciples to feign readiness for war, while secretly dispatching people to raid the Jiangnan Ten Thousand Graves."

"Therefore, it is with great pleasure that we announce to all disciples: As of yesterday, the Jiangnan Ten Thousand Graves has been personally recaptured by the True Monarch, and the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion has contacted the True Monarch, expressing their willingness to negotiate peace with our Saint Sect."

It exploded.

Literally. The moment the news spread, an explosion sound came from a certain cave dwelling; it seemed someone had gone berserk and self-destructed. Immediately after, complete silence fell. The vast Prime Saint Sect, which had been full of vitality and bustling activity yesterday, was now left with only a terrifying, suffocating silence.

Because everyone understood: the recapture of the Jiangnan Ten Thousand Graves meant that the supply of Substitute Yin Puppets was no longer scarce; the Jade Axis Sword Pavilion initiating peace talks meant that the war between the righteous and demonic factions was indefinitely postponed. More importantly, this news was issued via disciple tokens, equivalent to an official announcement. Therefore, it couldn't be false.

The bubble named Substitute Yin Puppet burst at this moment, resulting in its price plummeting like a freefall from its peak of seven thousand. Five thousand, three thousand, one thousand, two hundred. The price that had taken over a month to rise now plummeted back to its original price within a mere quarter of an hour, and it was still falling! Everyone wanted to sell, but no one was willing to buy. Especially those who had hoarded large quantities of Substitute Yin Puppets could now only watch helplessly as the price crashed through the floor, watching their wealth continuously evaporate.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

That night, almost every so often, a deafening explosion would echo within the Prime Saint Sect. Who knew how many people had their Dao hearts shattered because of this?

***

Inside the cave dwelling, Zhao Xuhe had long since fainted. When he opened his eyes, his expression was still somewhat bewildered, as if in a dream: "How terrifying, I actually dreamed the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet fell, ha ha ha..."

Then he glanced at the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet again.

100 contribution points per puppet.

"...I must have misread it."

After a moment of silence, Zhao Xuhe closed his disciple token, took a deep breath, then, with trembling hands, opened it again to check the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet.

50 contribution points per puppet.

"Pfft!!!"

Zhao Xuhe immediately spat out a mouthful of old blood, his face instantly turning a liver-like purple, and his Qi flow plummeted to rock bottom, just like the price of the Substitute Yin Puppet.

"I hate...!"

Zhao Xuhe had no time for further thought. He desperately suppressed the rampaging thoughts in his mind, regulated his breathing, circulated his True Qi, and narrowly avoided truly going berserk.

Just then, a voice suddenly came from outside the cave dwelling.

"Senior Brother Zhao, Lu Yang is here to visit."

"Lu Yang?"

Zhao Xuhe was stunned for a long moment before remembering his junior brother. Then, recalling that the other party had exited early and paid off his loan, while he himself had now lost everything...

"Pfft!"

Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, Zhao Xuhe tremblingly walked out the door, only to see Lu Yang standing refreshed at the entrance, enthusiastically waving at him: "Senior Brother, how much money did you make today?"

*Bang!*

With an explosive sound, Zhao Xuhe gritted his teeth tightly, his True Qi running rampant throughout his body, causing cracks in his skin and flesh, from which threads of blood seeped out.

Lu Yang immediately looked horrified: "Senior Brother!? Are you alright?"

"...I'm fine." Zhao Xuhe forced out a strained smile: "Oh, by the way, Junior Brother Lu, I recently discovered an ancient cultivator's cave dwelling. It seems to have many good things inside."

As his words fell, a glint of fierce light immediately appeared in Zhao Xuhe's eyes, and he squeezed out a voice through gritted teeth: "I wonder if Junior Brother would be interested?"
