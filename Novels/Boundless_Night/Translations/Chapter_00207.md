## Chapter 207: Dragon Battles in the Wild

Qin Ming's heart stirred immensely. He wanted to visit that mysterious place and see what it truly was like.

In the forest under "Dusk," branches and leaves seemed to be stained with a faint golden hue. Distant glowing paths wove through the woods, overlapping with the real world like shadows, yet seemingly never merging.

Currently, he had no choice but to fight.

The silver-robed youth, with his black hair unbound, wielded a pitch-black Heaven-Measuring Ruler. With every swing, demonic energy mingled with Heavenly Light Energy, surging forth like a streak of lightning. Around him, any large trees or vines obstructing his path shattered instantly!

The Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade in Qin Ming's hand glowed with intense Heavenly Light. In an instant, it clashed dozens of times with the Heaven-Measuring Ruler, and Qin Ming felt his arm actually going numb. This was a rare occurrence. His heart sank; he had encountered an extremely dangerous opponent.

Crack! Their left hands, one a fist and the other a palm, clashed amidst crackling electricity, radiating outwards from their center. Not only did some vegetation explode, but the ground also turned scorched black.

Qin Ming faced a crisis, encountering such a formidable opponent right from the start, with other dangerous demons lurking nearby. He immediately struck decisively.

The Dragon-headed Youth was extremely aggressive. His right hand splayed open, resembling a dragon's claw, and struck with extreme speed.

Sparks flew from the Jade-Iron Blade in Qin Ming's hand. After exchanging a blow with the silver-robed youth, he leaped over a dozen meters high like a divine rainbow, landing on a large tree. He evaded the pincer attack from the silver-robed youth and the Dragon-headed Youth, but another assailant arrived in mid-air: the Peacock Demoness, swift as a divine rainbow, was there in an instant.

She appeared soft and slender, yet her punches were incredibly fierce. Behind her, a colossal peacock seemed to resonate with her. The two exchanged a powerful punch on the tree. The entire ancient tree exploded, sending splinters of branches and leaves flying everywhere.

As the two figures collided, the silver-robed youth had already shot into the sky, his Heaven-Measuring Ruler in his right hand unleashing terrifying dark light, like thunder and lightning piercing the heavens. At the same time, the Dragon-headed Youth surged up, fingers splayed, attacking once more.

The Jade-Iron Blade in Qin Ming's hand clashed with the silver-robed youth's Heaven-Measuring Ruler, producing deafening metallic screeches. In mid-air, it was as if two meteors had collided, sending Heavenly Light Energy scattering. Simultaneously, his fist collided with the Dragon-headed Youth's dragon claw, creating a deafening roar, as if a bolt of lightning had erupted between them. Nearby, scattered leaves flew about, then exploded into dust.

At the same time, the seemingly delicate Peacock Demoness appeared behind Qin Ming, swinging a fierce punch towards his back, as if she intended to pierce straight through him. Qin Ming kicked his left leg back, using the force of the punch to accelerate away in mid-air, tearing through the trees, and landing on an old tree twenty meters away.

However, he had no time to pause. The maiden with two pairs of pristine white wings was actually a mutated Crane Demon, who flapped her wings and ascended. She charged forward at extreme speed, arriving before him despite starting later. Her five fingers clenched, her fist-print resembling a crane's beak, shooting out dazzling beams of light. Heavenly Light Energy merged with fiendish aura, making its power exceptionally formidable.

From behind, the Peacock Demoness, also capable of flying, rapidly closed in, swinging her gleaming white fist towards the back of Qin Ming's head. The silver-robed youth and the Dragon-headed Youth also arrived, both unleashing their full power. The four demons attacked from different directions, converging in mid-air, all targeting Qin Ming.

The entire forest seemed to tremble violently. The area was ablaze with dazzling light, and amidst the flying figures, towering ancient trees disintegrated, like snowflakes swirling across the sky. Qin Ming fell to the ground, a trace of blood appearing at the corner of his mouth.

The silver-robed youth was strong enough to contend with him; he was a terrifying foe. The other young demons were also exceptionally powerful, making the current encirclement extremely perilous for Qin Ming. At this moment, the essence of the fragmented demon seed within him began to boil, craving this battle. His Dragon-Snake Energy also became active, seemingly wanting to undergo transformation through bloodshed.

The white-haired youth, whose left ear had been half torn away by a jade-iron arrow, was an Ox Demon of immense strength. Maintaining his human form, he appeared abruptly as if teleporting, his hands wreathed in fire as he struck. He struck the side of the Jade-Iron Blade with his bare hands, knocking it slightly aside, then closed in and exchanged punches with Qin Ming. Then, the white-haired youth suddenly lowered his head and charged forward. The two ox horns amidst his white hair, sharp as curved blades and inscribed with runes, thrust towards his opponent.

Qin Ming shifted his body, quickly widening the distance. His Jade-Iron Blade swept out, unleashing a vast expanse of white light as it slashed towards the ox demon's head. The two ox horns, swirling with fiendish aura and boiling with demonic energy, condensed into two curved blades, parrying the Jade-Iron Blade. However, the white-haired youth grunted, being knocked back several steps by the blow.

At the same time, the others surged from different directions like thunderbolts, converging towards the center. Qin Ming leaped up again, evading their combined assault.

The Golden Elephant Demon, which had been quiet for a long time, suddenly erupted. Its trunk suddenly swelled, rushing forth like a golden rope, instantly coiling around Qin Ming in mid-air and binding his arms, preventing him from swinging his blade. The Elephant-headed Youth's attack was successful; he locked down his opponent and directly seized him. The other powerful demons, knowing of his unique technique, instinctively closed in once he succeeded, intent on taking their opponent's life.

However, a shocking change occurred. Qin Ming's body glowed, and his Golden Silkworm Energy erupted. His skin became covered in countless dense golden threads that pierced through the elephant's trunk, leaving it bloody. The Elephant Demon roared in pain. Its golden trunk, riddled with holes, instantly loosened its grip. The moment Qin Ming broke free, he swung his Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade with full force. With a "poof," blood splattered, and the rope-like elephant trunk fell severed to the ground.

"Ah..." The Elephant-headed Youth shrieked. Whenever he had ambushed enemies in the past, he usually subdued them instantly. Today, however, was so gruesome; he had suffered a tremendous loss. Tears streamed down his face. Under the intense pain, he reverted to his true form, becoming a golden giant elephant the size of a small mountain.

The Dragon-headed Demon, Peacock Demon, and others seeing this, instantly erupted, jointly assaulting their opponent. With such a behemoth before him, Qin Ming naturally had to utilize it. He stuck close to the Elephant Demon, circling around it to evade the encirclement.

The Elephant Demon was enraged. Golden runes covered its body, as if about to ignite. Two golden tusks detached from its body and thrust towards Qin Ming. Qin Ming swung his blade, and with clanging sounds, he carved many nicks into the golden tusks. Simultaneously, he used his Adhesive Force to seize and hold onto the two tusks.

The Elephant Demon roared, its massive golden body glowing. It activated its bloodline power, summoning its tusks back. Qin Ming's left hand, stuck to the tusks, flew along with them. The Elephant Demon's pupils contracted as it saw the dazzling blade light slashing towards it. It ceased summoning its tusks. Although its body was massive, it moved with nimble steps, swiftly dodging. It surprisingly moved as if dancing, more agile and flexible than many smaller creatures. It evaded the blade light, and any large trees blocking its way were shattered by its impact.

However, Qin Ming had locked onto it, determined to use it to establish his might. His body was as fast as lightning, rapidly closing the distance. The other demons were extremely formidable and naturally tried to block and pursue the human youth. However, such a massive Elephant Demon was truly the best shield for Qin Ming.

Using his Adhesive Force, he made contact with the golden giant elephant, climbed onto its body, and immediately stabbed with his blade. With a "poof," the blade, imbued with Thunder-Fire Energy and a dragon's roar, spurted blood as it pierced into the elephant's massive head, creating a bloody hole. The Elephant Demon bellowed, shaking its head frantically. Golden runes all over its body blazed like flames, trying to shake off the human youth. However, Qin Ming's Adhesive Force proved greatly effective. No matter how it shook its head, wagged its tail, or even flipped its body, he did not leave the elephant's body.

The others naturally reacted. The silver-robed youth charged onto the elephant's body, his pitch-black Heaven-Measuring Ruler streaking like a black lightning bolt. The Peacock Demoness also attacked, her fierce fist striking down. The four-winged maiden, transformed from the Crane Demon, swooped down from mid-air and pounced. The Dragon-headed Youth and the white-haired Ox Demon also arrived, hunting their opponent.

Qin Ming moved like a streak of light, gliding over the mountain-like golden giant elephant. He reached its neck, using its massive body to flexibly evade the demons' encirclement. During this process, his entire body radiated five-colored light. A five-colored blade condensed and merged with his Mutton-fat Jade-Iron Blade. He stabbed into the giant elephant's neck, then moved at extreme speed, circling its neck.

"Ah... Big Brother, save me!" The Elephant Demon cried out in terror. No matter how it struggled, it couldn't shake off this human youth. Its golden runes couldn't budge him; he was like a plaster, stuck firmly to its body, and now he was going to decapitate it. Blood spurted out like a fountain, staining the ground red and forming small streams. It must be said that its massive size and thick neck had their advantages. Even with Heavenly Light Energy spreading, its neck was not completely severed.

The other demons' expressions changed. They had surrounded this person, yet he still managed to severely injure the Elephant Demon. The silver-robed youth, Dragon-headed Youth, Crane Demoness, and others attacked with full force. However, Qin Ming used his Adhesive Force to move around the massive golden elephant with extreme speed, sometimes on its belly, sometimes on its back. The Peacock Demoness's fist even landed on the Elephant Demon's back.

"Sister Kong!" the Elephant Demon Youth cried out. He was already heavily wounded and now taking more hits; he felt he couldn't hold on much longer. It wanted to transform into its human form, but the opponent wouldn't leave its body. If it shrunk, it might instantly be cut in half or decapitated.

"Ah..." The Elephant Demon shrieked. At this moment, Qin Ming went all out. His entire body radiated five-colored light, piercing through its neck. His body even submerged within, rapidly circling once. The golden giant elephant went berserk, running and crashing around, felling swathes of trees. The entire forest trembled violently.

Suddenly, its body halted. Blood surged out, and its massive elephant head fell to the ground. Then, it crashed down. A demon of extraordinary bloodline and at the Second Realm had died just like that!

In the distance, Jiang Ruoli, Gan Jincheng, Liu Hanhya, and others watched clearly, utterly stunned. Under the encirclement of an even stronger demon squad, he had actually powerfully slain a "renowned demon."

"I will kill you!" The silver-robed youth's voice was bone-chillingly cold. So many of them had attacked, yet their opponent had counter-killed one of their sworn brothers. This was a type of humiliation for him.

At this moment, the white-haired Ox Demon, Dragon-headed Youth, and others also had icy expressions, closing in step by step, surrounding the area.

In the distance, Little Wu couldn't hold back. He strode over, wanting to lend a hand. Suddenly, the silver-robed youth stopped, his expression stiffening, as he gazed towards the edge of the forest. Qin Ming also sensed it immediately, as the fragmented demon seed within him stirred, creating a strong sensation: another powerful expert, also containing a fragmented demon seed, was approaching from afar. Moreover, the "gift" he had received seemed even more powerful!

"Originally there were five fragmented demon seeds, and someone has already successfully devoured others, and they are approaching here!" The silver-robed youth's face was grim as he informed his sworn brothers and sisters.

Qin Ming's heart also sank. Just this current group was already extremely difficult for him to handle, and he might not even be their match. If someone with "two demon seeds" or even "three demon seeds" arrived, he would surely die.

"Xiao Wu, take them and leave quickly, avoid that direction!" Qin Ming transmitted, informing him that a more formidable demon had appeared in the distance.

"Brother, I'll help you! We brothers will team up and fear no one!" Little Wu said.

Qin Ming shook his head, saying, "No, you must leave quickly. I can fight or retreat, I can leave this place at any time. If the situation isn't right, I won't fight them to the death!"

Little Wu didn't want to separate from him, saying, "We can escape together, and we'll have each other's backs!"

Qin Ming urged, "No need, split up. You retreat first, I'll escape in a bit too. Otherwise, among these demons around me, there's a flying bird demon. They might deliberately fly in front of us, making us cover their retreat as cannon fodder." At the same time, he reminded Little Wu to look for those mysterious landscapes. They might be able to step onto special paths leading to a mysterious realm, which could hold immense benefits. He told Wu Yaozu about the visions he saw when the demon seed resonated not long ago. He felt that Little Wu was the sole heir of the Fourth Forbidden Land and had a unique cultivation method; he should also be a "seed" in some way.

Ultimately, under Qin Ming's strict urging, Little Wu didn't dawdle and quickly led his people away.

"What? An even stronger demon has appeared, possibly wielding two or even three fragmented demon seeds?" Xin Youdao's scalp tingled upon hearing this. Gan Jincheng, Xiao Yaqin, and others turned even paler. Such Second Realm demons were absolutely terrifying; they couldn't contend with them. This time, they didn't hesitate, as they truly couldn't help, and quickly departed.

***

Clearly, the silver-robed youth also harbored misgivings and was secretly conversing with several powerful demons.

Qin Ming spoke: "Everyone, why don't we join forces? Let's first kill that Two-Demon Seed demon in the distance, and then settle our grievances, what do you say?"

Opposite him, the young demons' gazes were icy. This human youth had just killed one of their sworn brothers; how dare he talk about joining forces?

"Fine!" The silver-robed youth finally nodded coldly.

"Big Brother!" The white-haired Ox Demon protested.

The silver-robed youth said, "Let's first get through this immediate crisis. I didn't expect someone to have already swallowed other demon seeds; this is very troublesome!"

The other three powerful demons remained silent, tacitly agreeing.

"Alright!" The white-haired Ox Demon nodded reluctantly.

The silver-robed youth said, "Let's first discuss how to jointly fight this fiend. He should be an insect demon; his cultivation was already higher than mine, and now that he's swallowed new fragmented demon seeds... he's somewhat unsolvable." His brow was deeply furrowed. He beckoned to Qin Ming, asking him if he had any solutions.

"Insect demon, what is its true form, and what are its special characteristics?" Qin Ming asked.

"His true form is..." Suddenly, the silver-robed youth glowed brilliantly, and silver ripples expanded outwards with an unstoppable momentum. The ground collapsed, nearby vegetation pulverized, and large rocks turned to dust. He was completely engulfed in silver light, his aura skyrocketing as he powerfully attacked, launching a sneak assault, aiming to instantly kill Qin Ming.

At this moment, Qin Ming's pupils contracted. This guy truly harbored ill intentions, and he was even more powerful than Qin Ming had anticipated. His entire body burst forth with Heavenly Light Energy, and dazzling divine rings reappeared one after another, overlapping around his body, combining to form a protective divine light. Qin Ming's various unique techniques, along with his different Heavenly Light Energies, merged and unified, making him appear as if standing within a celestial sun, blindingly bright.

Recently, he had been experimenting with using a single unique technique, hoping to manifest this strongest state of Heavenly Light Energy, but he felt he could only get close, never quite reaching its full power. However, this unified Heavenly Light consumed a significant amount of energy.

Boom!

The two, one wielding the Heaven-Measuring Ruler and the other the snow-white Jade-Iron Blade, clashed head-on. Both used their fists and feet, unleashing their strongest power towards their opponent. In the continuous exchange of blows, Qin Ming had blood at the corner of his mouth. He was shaken, his blood and Qi churning, and his internal organs ached intensely.

"Big Brother... he has completely activated the fragmented demon seed and used some kind of forbidden technique!" The Ox Demon gasped.

"Surround him, don't let him escape!" the silver-robed youth commanded. Rather than allying with this youth, it was better to devour him immediately and become a powerful expert wielding two fragmented demon seeds himself, thus being able to contend with the opponent in the distance. At this moment, the silver fragmented demon seed within him temporarily decomposed, transforming into streams of light that surged through his limbs and bones.

A complete demon seed was originally colorless. It was torn into five fragments and bestowed upon five exceptionally powerful young demons. After refining them, they merged with their own bodies, naturally understanding how to wield their power. Qin Ming, however, merely treated it as cultivation resources, not seeking to fuse with it.

Now, with the silver-robed youth activating the demon seed, his strength increased significantly. Even with Qin Ming displaying his strongest form, using his unified Heavenly Light Energy, he was at a disadvantage. This was all because his cultivation realm wasn't high enough.

The silver-robed youth, at the Second Realm, even had his eyes turn silver-white. Every punch he threw caused the void to explode, nearby vegetation to rupture. The Heaven-Measuring Ruler in his hand flew like a black flood dragon wreathed in lightning, shattering everything. Qin Ming was shaken, spitting large mouthfuls of blood. It had been a long time since he faced such difficulty. Especially as the nearby young demons surrounded him.

He moved like lightning, fighting with all his might. Seizing the opportune moment, he suddenly activated a special light within his body—an ability born during his sixth rebirth, equivalent to a full-power strike after his Heavenly Light Energy boiled. At this moment, it burst out of Qin Ming's body, carrying the pristine white sword-shaped pendant hanging around his neck.

It must be said that the silver-robed youth was truly exceptionally powerful; at that critical life-or-death moment, he actually managed to dodge. However, his left ear was pierced by the small sword forged from exotic gold, and then shattered by the terrifying Heavenly Light, permanently losing an ear.

"Ah!" Behind him, a sharp, urgent, and incredibly brief shriek of agony sounded. The silver-robed youth, who had been enraged, resentful, and utterly humiliated, felt his body turn cold. He knew he had dodged, but the Peacock Demoness had been struck. This was an angle Qin Ming had deliberately chosen; the most ideal outcome was to hit two at once!

A bloody hole appeared between the Peacock Demoness's eyebrows. Her eyes dulled, and she fell straight down. The small sword forged from exotic gold specialized in breaking through various Heavenly Light Energies, spiritual consciousnesses, and was truly indestructible. With a whoosh, Qin Ming retrieved the small sword using the residual power of that special light.

All of the silver-robed youth's negative emotions erupted, his killing intent soaring to the heavens. Qin Ming exchanged blows with him, but he was indeed at a disadvantage, wounded by this Second Realm demon. During the exchange, his left hand was bloody, and his right hand, holding the blade, was also mangled by the vast demonic power, almost losing its grip on the Jade-Iron Blade.

"Sister Kong!" The other demons also cried out, frantically swarming to attack.

"Heh heh... ha ha..." The silver-robed youth's power was actually still rising, but his laughter was somewhat eerie, and a phantom image actually appeared within the silver light he radiated.

"Big Brother, wake up! Don't let the fragmented demon seed backlash!" the Dragon-headed Youth roared.

This was the side effect of fully activating the fragmented demon seed: power surged, but these broken seeds were remnants left after other true demon seeds died, retaining some chaotic emotions, which could easily affect one's mind. Qin Ming secretly rejoiced, fortunate that he merely treated it as cultivation resources, refining its essence and discarding the dross, rather than merging with it. Otherwise, there would certainly be hidden dangers.

During the fierce exchange, Qin Ming activated the second light within his body. Swathes of golden light interwoven, appearing like a shattered great sun. This was an ability that emerged during Qin Ming's seventh rebirth, related to spiritual consciousness, and it propelled the small sword forged from exotic gold to fly out. He did not attempt to strike down the silver-robed youth. At this moment, he targeted the Dragon-headed Youth who was attacking him with dragon claws.

Despite knowing Qin Ming possessed such a special method and having been on guard, at the critical moment, the Dragon-headed Youth was still severely wounded. His protective light barrier failed to block it. The exotic gold small sword pierced into his head. Although it didn't penetrate fully, it made his vision go black, his expression stiffen, and all his reactions became two beats slower.

Qin Ming followed up, a single slash of his blade. The Dragon-headed Youth's head flew off.

Boom! At the same time, he was struck by a punch from the crazed silver-robed youth, sending him flying horizontally. Qin Ming landed, his body staggered, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

At this moment, the white-haired Ox Demon and the Crane Demoness were both terrified. Their comrades were dying tragically one after another, which truly made their hearts tremble.

The silver-robed youth's eyes were frantic; he looked very abnormal. The phantom image within him was almost projecting outside his body, and he was actually roaring up at the sky. And at this moment, the silver-robed youth also shouted up at the sky, echoing that phantom image.

"Big Brother, wake up! Don't let the fragmented demon seed influence you!" the Ox Demon shouted.

Qin Ming glanced into the distance, sensing that another powerful demon was approaching at its own steady pace.

"What's wrong with me?" The silver-robed youth vigorously shook his head. He had regained some clarity. He had wanted to quickly devour the fragmented demon seed before him, yet he himself had unexpectedly run into problems.

Qin Ming went all out, fiercely attacking him. His unified Heavenly Light Energy erupted through the Jade-Iron Blade. The silver-robed youth had just regained consciousness, but his eyes again turned frantic due to the stimulation. He knew this wasn't right and tried his best to control himself, but his efforts were in vain. As the two exchanged blows, his power was stronger, but the emotions within the demon seed interfered, making his movements disjointed.

Qin Ming, using the principles from the silk scroll to control various techniques, made his Heavenly Light Energy increasingly resplendent. He attempted to manifest various wondrous phenomena in this state. For a moment, within the overlapping divine rings around his body, five-colored light appeared, Purple Mansion Thunder-Fire emerged, and even Heavenly Thunder summoning Earth Fire. Then, a dragon's roar resonated, and dragon shadows flickered within his flesh and blood. The Dragon-Snake Energy had not yet fully integrated with his other techniques, only manifesting as wondrous phenomena within his flesh and blood.

"Indeed, Heavenly Light Energy needs to be honed in great battles!" Qin Ming discovered that after various unusual phenomena emerged within his divine rings, his own strength had increased. Now, as he clashed with the silver-robed youth again, he no longer coughed up large mouthfuls of blood with every hit.

"Big Brother!" The Ox Demon and Crane Demoness were worried. As they surrounded him to attack, their faces were filled with apprehension. Qin Ming used the last light within his body, an ability born during his eighth rebirth, related to spiritual wisdom. Unfortunately, the exotic gold small sword failed to pierce the Crane Demoness; her speed was incredibly fast, and the small sword merely grazed her scalp, severing some strands of her hair.

However, Qin Ming had already predicted which direction she would dodge. He preemptively leaped up with his Jade-Iron Blade and slashed. At this moment, although the silver-robed youth possessed fierce power, his eyes were frenzied, and he paid no heed to rescuing her.

With a "poof," the Crane Demoness was decapitated. Her head flew off amidst the brilliant Heavenly Light.

"Ah..." The Ox Demon collapsed. So many "renowned demons" had teamed up, yet they were systematically slaughtered one by one, and Big Brother's mental state was also problematic. It was a complete and utter defeat; it shouldn't have been like this. He fled, having no desire to continue fighting. Seeing this, the several demon servants behind him also turned and ran.

Only Qin Ming and the crazed silver-robed youth remained on the scene, continuing their exchange of blows. During the fierce struggle, the silver-robed youth withdrew from his forbidden technique state. Immediately, his aura plummeted, leaving him in a weaker condition than his normal state.

"Alas, to think I've suffered such a complete defeat! Detestable, disgraceful!" he sighed. Although he didn't simply give up, with his strength now diminished, he couldn't block Qin Ming's unified Heavenly Light Energy, which was like a blazing sun.

Finally, Qin Ming cleaved him down with a single stroke of his blade!

The silver-robed youth's body, split in two, fell into a pool of blood. A white light burst out and flew rapidly towards Qin Ming. Qin Ming took out the tattered cloth woven from exotic gold, activating his Heavenly Light Energy. The great sun depicted on it instantly emitted light, enveloping the fragmented demon seed. After that, he took the Heaven-Measuring Ruler, turned around, and swiftly fled into the distance.

"Hmm, it's useful, I can refine demons!" Qin Ming was surprised. He noticed that the connection between himself and the powerful expert with a fragmented demon seed in the distance had weakened. Subsequently, he did his best to shatter the remaining small amount of fragmented demon seed within his body, briefly expelling it. Before it could return to his flesh, he also wrapped it in the tattered cloth and began refining it. Only when he could no longer sense the demon seed fluctuations from afar did he feel relieved.

Qin Ming sped away, continuously "refining demons" along the way. By the end, he had absorbed both fragmented demon seeds into his body and furiously activated them, yet still sensed no powerful expert in the distance. However, he saw vague glowing paths.

"Now is not the time to embark on that path. I must first achieve a breakthrough," Qin Ming murmured to himself, spitting out a mouthful of bloody foam. In this confrontation, he was covered in blood and not lightly wounded. Particularly, the two demon seeds within him began to become active, once again inflicting severe burden and damage upon his flesh and blood.

Qin Ming sat cross-legged in the dense forest, pulverizing the demon seeds, absorbing their essence as cultivation resources. Finally, his flesh and blood shattered, like a snake shedding its skin, transforming into dragon scales. The Dragon-Snake Scripture began to operate frantically. The two demon seeds were continuously crushed by him, their essences extracted. As drowsiness overcame Qin Ming, he entered a mountain cave and underwent transformation in a state between sleep and wakefulness.

In his dream, he seemed to relive the battle with the silver-robed youth and others, but his body appeared to transform into a dragon. A snake transforming into a dragon would not be peaceful! His experiences today were quite consistent with the records in the Dragon-Snake Scripture: flesh and blood shattering, growing dragon horns, developing dragon claws... Subsequently, he truly "battled like a dragon in the wild," fighting fiercely against a very powerful demon squad.

Currently, the two demon seeds had turned into nutrients, supporting his further transformation, thereby transforming into a dragon. Qin Ming's flesh and blood shattered multiple times, forming scabs on his skin with scale-like patterns, truly resembling dragon scales. His "Dragon-Snake Scripture" accelerated its operation, pushing his Dragon-Snake Energy towards Great Accomplishment.

A new aura spread, growing increasingly dense. He was moving towards the threshold of his ninth rebirth. As time passed, dragon roars continuously echoed within him. His Dragon-Snake Energy reached the limit he could currently achieve. His external body was covered with a layer of "dragon scales," and internally, it was a much more powerful newly-formed physique!

Above Kunling City, Sun Taichu's Pure Yang spiritual consciousness transformed into a human figure, standing on a dark cloud. He said, "The higher-ups of the Secret Sect are willing to cooperate in hunting the Auspicious Beast, but they don't want to break through the Forbidden Land?"

"Yes!" someone replied.

Sun Taichu's expression was more solemn than ever. He said, "An extraordinary figure has emerged within the Secret Sect, shaking heaven and earth, with ambitions set on all the Forbidden Lands in the Kunling Territory!"
