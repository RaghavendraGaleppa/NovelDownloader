# Chapter 358: Nightfall Approaches

Perhaps this could alleviate his rapidly depleting lifespan.

The night clouds suddenly scattered, and moonlight cascaded down like a waterfall.

Xu Yunfan finally turned around, the Ten Extremities True Qi flowing like a river of stars in his pupils. "Senior, your Ten Extremities Martial Path is to劈开 the Heavenly Gate with a sword, but what I desire..."

He opened his palm, where a wisp of Maitreya Purifying Fire and Nine曜 Vital Energy mingled. "...is to forge all laws into fuel."

Meeting Du Gujiu's uncontrollable gaze of greed, Xu Yunfan's lips curled into a smile. "Since the Ten Extremities Martial Path was inherited from you, Senior, it is only right that it nourishes you in return."

Before his words had fully faded, the fervor in Du Gujiu's eyes rapidly receded, the heat instantly freezing into ice. His withered fingers subconsciously moved toward the sword hilt, but he forcefully restrained himself. After a long while, a cold sneer squeezed out from his throat. "Brat, you certainly know how to bargain. You should know that the last person who spoke to me like this has been dead for nearly three hundred years. Go on, what do you want this old bag of bones to do?"

If he hadn't been wary of Xu Yunfan's current strength, and if the other party wasn't wearing dragon scale armor while carrying three divine weapons, and if the sheer volume of his Ten Extremities True Qi didn't make his heart pound with alarm, how could Du Gujiu have discussed things so amicably with Xu Yunfan?

"Senior, you have keen insight!"

Xu Yunfan's sleeves fluttered as he spoke without hesitation. "The Heavenly Demon is about to arrive, yet the various Dao Prefectures are still fighting over the remnants of the dragon veins. My Dao Sect intends to use Yujing as a cauldron to forge a Land Immortal Realm, but the current Empress wants to blood sacrifice three thousand miles of mountains and rivers to preserve the Zhou clan's fortune and extend her own lifespan..."

He took a step forward, his eyes gleaming, his expression unreadable.

"Why don't you, Senior, take up the sword and cut a path to the heavens for this mortal world... This is a great deed that benefits the nation and its people. If it succeeds, your name will be remembered for eternity."

Du Gujiu's white hair stirred without wind, and the three-foot green blade at his waist emitted a low hum.

Du Gujiu understood the subtext perfectly. This brat wanted to use his power to flatten the Six Paths and Seventy-Nine Prefectures, filling the millennium-long accumulations of all sects into his own Ten Extremities Martial Path to elevate and refine it.

Thinking of those Nine-Stage Grandmasters who had been sucked into dried corpses, the old monster let out a laugh like a screech owl. "What a vicious scheme to borrow a knife to kill! Aren't you afraid I'll kill you first and swallow your Xuanhuang Qi?"

"If you wanted it, Senior, why wait until today? Besides, this is a great merit. The heavens, earth, and living people will build temples for you."

A vein throbbed on Du Gujiu's forehead. "What I want is to be eternal myself, not to live in the memories of others. Do you think I want to be like the Bright Lord of the Incense Sect? He was once an extremely powerful figure, but now he is neither alive nor dead, unable to live or die. He can only manifest in the dreams of ordinary people. How pathetic."

Seeing that Xu Yunfan was about to speak again.

"Enough!"

The old monster flicked his sleeve.

He stared at Xu Yunfan, his expression still carrying a faint smile, but the Ten Extremities True Qi around him began to slowly swirl, finally suppressing his killing intent.

He paced back and forth before finally speaking.

"During the final trial in the main hall tomorrow, I can hold that madwoman back for half an incense's time. With such a fine opportunity, I'm sure you can succeed with a mere stretch of your hand..."

Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed. He thought to himself that his past experience as a wage slave hadn't been in vain. First, propose an impossible goal to make the other party decisively refuse, then let the other party offer a condition that is almost their bottom line.

He stood here, not concealing his aura, specifically to lure the fish over.

During the day, he had single-handedly fought nine Qi-refining experts, which naturally shocked this old monster. Furthermore, his technique of absorbing true qi would definitely make this old monster, whose lifespan was running out, unable to sit still.

"Then I will entrust this matter to you, Senior."

Sky Sword Du Gujiu, a single promise is worth a thousand gold. This was a reputation established three hundred years ago.

The Dao Sect has its own records.

As Xu Yunfan clapped his hands and laughed, a dull bell sound suddenly came from the direction of Yujing City.

His laughter abruptly stopped. Seeing Du Gujiu's slightly darkened expression, he turned his head to look in the direction of the sound.

"The Imperial Observatory's Warning Bell."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered.

The two of them looked toward the Imperial City at the same time. Above the Vermilion Bird Gate, the Nine曜 Sect's "Great Sun Meteor Core" was suspended. Below it, three thousand Imperial Guards were arranged in the "Sky-Scorching Soul-Destroying Formation."

Large amounts of spiritual energy from heaven and earth were being pushed up from the ground veins, using the great array laid out in Yujing City as a foundation, activating the formation.

What was even more shocking was that the State-Suppressing Seal hanging high on the Xuanwu Gate suddenly burst forth with a piercing black light. The surface of the seal twisted like water, actually condensing to reveal the majestic face of the Empress.

Those cold phoenix eyes were locked tightly onto the two men on the Ask Heaven Pavilion. Deep within her pupils, an undisguised killing intent churned. Her voice, like the decree of heaven, boomed like thunder.

"At the hour of Chen tomorrow, I shall personally grace the Martial Stage!"

The sound wave, carrying the pressure of the dragon vein, swept across Yujing City, causing even the bluestone slabs of the Vermilion Bird Street to tremble.

Yet Xu Yunfan remained unmoved, a cold smile playing on his lips.

His mastery-level mining technique gave him a keen sense for locating dragon veins and discerning脉络. At this moment, he clearly detected a slight, stagnant gap within the spiritual energy flowing as the Imperial Guards formed their array.

"It's just a battle formation technique from two thousand years ago..."

Xu Yunfan shook his head slightly. "Although the spiritual energy of heaven and earth is recovering from the ground veins, being forced into action like this, its operation is ultimately unsmooth... It would only take an instant to shatter this paper-thin formation!"

"It seems that woman is about to fight with her life on the line."

Du Gujiu suddenly pulled out a moldy religious certificate and threw it to Xu Yunfan. The three words "Li Chunyang" on it were soaked in blood stains. "Three hundred years ago, when I charged into the Imperial Mausoleum, I found half of a Heavenly Demon's corpse enshrined in the Zhou clan's Ancestral Temple. If you see the Empress's pupils turn purple tomorrow, immediately use your Ten Extremities True Qi to shatter her Tanzhong acupoint. There should be a Purple Gold Great Pill refined from the Heavenly Demon's body inside!"

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted upon hearing this.

"The Great Zhou Imperial Court once killed a Heavenly Demon?"

Du Gujiu nodded slightly, a trace of reminiscence flashing through his turbid eyes. "When the Great Zhou was founded, the Grand Emperor Li Qian, at the Land Immortal Realm, captured an otherworldly Heavenly Demon with his own hands."

He rubbed the mottled scabbard of his long sword with his skeletal fingers, sneering. "It's a pity. No matter how heaven-defying your cultivation, you can't ultimately fight the erosion of time."

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled upon hearing this.

No wonder Bi Yuan dared to risk the world's condemnation and drain the dragon vein!

So many brilliant and talented figures in this world ultimately become just a few lines of faint ink in the annals of history.

He was just about to inquire further about the secrets of the Heavenly Demon when the bluestone tiles beneath his feet suddenly trembled violently.

"Heh... interesting."

Du Gujiu cracked his dry lips, revealing his stark white teeth.

The three-foot green blade at his waist sensed his killing intent, and dark red bloodstains actually seeped out from the cloud patterns on the scabbard. "The frustration I've suffered at your little place, I might as well vent on those bald donkeys."

Before his words had faded, the old man's hunched figure had already surged with a torrential sword intent.

The chanting of the monks from Maitreya Temple could be faintly heard in the distance. He pressed his palm on his sword and sneered. "At the third watch of the丑 hour, I shall send them to the Western Paradise early!"

As the eastern sky was just beginning to show a hint of fish-belly white, Xu Yunfan squinted. At the end of the Vermilion Bird Street, he could see the Imperial Guard's Corrosion Soul Crossbows glowing with a dim blue light.

But Du Gujiu's figure had already turned into a sword rainbow that tore through the morning mist.

Maitreya Temple, to spread Buddhism eastward, had truly brought out its entire foundation.
