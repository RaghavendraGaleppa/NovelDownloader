# Chapter 158: Void Treasure Ship  

The white-haired natural immortal's figure abruptly vanished, leaving the room in silence.  

Zhang Jing wasn't in a hurry. He stood quietly, his gaze involuntarily sweeping across the surroundings. As his focus sharpened, he noticed the walls around him gradually dissolving, replaced by an unfurling scroll of immense proportions—stretching endlessly in length and width—before his eyes.  

The scroll meticulously recorded information about countless secret realms within the Radiant Immortal World, vast and intricate beyond measure.  

A flicker of surprise crossed Zhang Jing's eyes.  

"Could all the secret realms of the Radiant Immortal World be documented here?" he wondered silently.  

His attention was soon captivated by the myriad realms listed before him. Names of secret realms—some bizarre, others perilous, and still others majestic—flashed past his vision, each unveiling a world of wonder and mystery.  

Before long, Zhang Jing spotted several familiar names.  

...  

**[Immortal Lake Secret Realm]**  
Description: A lake formed by the manifestation of Dao principles, nurturing innate spirits embodying various laws and giving rise to exotic spiritual roots and immortal plants, as well as treasures of the Dao...  
Cultivation Requirement: Golden Core Realm and above  
Danger Level: Medium  

...  

**[Longevity Secret Realm]**  
Description: A bizarre world with peculiar rules where the Dao of Longevity is intensely manifested, condensing into various treasures and eerie creatures related to lifespan.  
Cultivation Requirement: Dharma Form Realm and above  
Danger Level: Extreme (Highly Dangerous)  

...  

**[River of Time Secret Realm]**  
Description: A manifestation of the River of Time, brimming with boundless opportunities.  
Cultivation Requirement: Golden Core Realm and above  
Danger Level: Medium-High  

...  

"River of Time Secret Realm!"  

Zhang Jing slowly withdrew his gaze, a trace of longing flashing in his eyes. If he recalled correctly, the Time River Golden Sand he used to accumulate skill experience—and the even more precious Time River Golden Crystals—originated from this realm.  

"Once I return from the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, I must hasten my breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm," Zhang Jing mused.  

It wasn't just because of the River of Time Secret Realm. Among the tens of thousands of realms he had glimpsed, very few were accessible to Foundation Establishment cultivators. Most required at least Golden Core Realm, with some even demanding Dharma Form Realm.  

Of course, Zhang Jing had also noticed a few realms with no cultivation restrictions. One such realm was the Primordial Dao Demonstration Secret Realm.  

However, while this realm had no cultivation requirement, entering it once required a staggering **90 million** units of fortune—an unimaginably high threshold.  

After learning about this realm, Zhang Jing finally understood the origins of the bizarre Dao Intentions and peculiar inheritances he had encountered in the Dao Repository Secret Realm. Naturally, the Primordial Dao Demonstration Secret Realm was promptly added to his list of must-visit realms.  

The mysterious jade talisman's ability to fuse Dao Intentions and Seeds, combined with the Primordial Dao Demonstration Secret Realm, might allow him to continuously create numerous inheritances—powerful and reliable ones at that.  

As long as he was careful not to appear too outrageous, Zhang Jing believed his future fortune would be secured.  

While deep in thought—  

"Esteemed guest, here is your ticket. Please keep it safe."  

The white-haired natural immortal suddenly reappeared before Zhang Jing, respectfully presenting a golden-jade Void Treasure Ship ticket.  

"Thank you," Zhang Jing said with a smile as he accepted the ticket.  

"You flatter me, esteemed guest. This is merely my duty," the immortal replied humbly.  

Then, the white-haired immortal looked up curiously and asked, "Might I inquire if your journey to the Cave of True Splendor Heaven is for the legendary Proud Cloud Secret Realm?"  

"You know about that?" Zhang Jing asked, surprised.  

"I dare not deceive you, esteemed guest. Recently, many Dao Sect disciples have purchased tickets to the Cave of True Splendor Heaven from me—all for the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. The numbers are significantly higher than before," the immortal explained with a smile.  

"So that's the case," Zhang Jing mused.  

He looked at the immortal and asked, "You're saying... the number of Dao Sect disciples participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm this time is much higher than usual?"  

The immortal nodded, his voice tinged with curiosity. "Indeed! This anomaly has puzzled me greatly. Could there be some unforeseen change this time?"  

Hearing this, a faint, knowing smile crept onto Zhang Jing's face.  

He wasn't concerned about any changes. As long as the fundamental rules of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm remained unchanged, the more participants there were, the more beneficial it would be for him.  

...  

Time passed slowly.  

Zhang Jing remained in the same place where he had purchased the ticket. The white-haired immortal had vanished, leaving him alone as he meticulously examined the information about the secret realms displayed before him.  

While waiting for the Void Treasure Ship to arrive, he decided to make the most of his time by learning more about these realms.  

Suddenly—  

Zhang Jing's expression shifted.  

The ticket in his hand abruptly radiated brilliant light and emitted intense fluctuations.  

"It's here!"  

His gaze sharpened.  

The ticket, crafted from an unusual material that was neither metal nor jade, was now enveloped in layers of immortal light. A peculiar Dao character, resembling a swimming fish, danced within, exuding a rich aura of the void.  

Without hesitation, Zhang Jing channeled his mana into the ticket.  

In an instant, the Dao character flew out and hovered before him, transforming into a three-zhang-tall gate shrouded in dark, misty light.  

Beyond the gate, a bustling and lively scene faintly appeared.  

Seeing this, a trace of amusement flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes.  

"Tsk, the white-haired immortal wasn't exaggerating. There really are a lot of Dao Sect disciples heading to the Proud Cloud Secret Realm this time."  

...  

Meanwhile, at the Vermilion Brilliance Grand Heaven Grotto-Heaven—  

Outside Zhang Jing's immortal island, a golden-robed Daoist descended in a flash of light.  

It was none other than Senior Brother Xuan Yuan, who had previously informed Zhang Jing about the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.  

With a smile, he called out, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing, if you're not busy, how about I take you to observe the Proud Cloud Secret Realm?"  

His voice echoed across the island.  

Yet, there was no response.  

"Strange. My divine sense transmission went unanswered, and now even my physical call receives no reply. Has Junior Brother Zhang Jing gone to the Radiant Immortal World?" Xuan Yuan wondered.  

Just then, a white streak of light rose from the island, materializing into a massive white deer.  

"Esteemed immortal, my master is currently away on business and is not on the island," Lu Thirty-Eight said with a simple, honest smile.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing is gone? And at this time?"  

Xuan Yuan's heart sank.  

The smile on his face faded as a grim suspicion took hold.  

"Did Junior Brother Zhang Jing mention when he would return?" he pressed, unwilling to accept the possibility.  

"Esteemed immortal, he did not," Lu Thirty-Eight replied, shaking his head.  

At this, Xuan Yuan froze.  

He was now almost certain that his junior brother had indeed gone to the Cave of True Splendor Heaven.  

After standing silently for a long moment, Xuan Yuan sighed inwardly.  

"I hope you're only going to observe, Junior Brother, and not actually participate in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm."  

With another heavy sigh, he turned to Lu Thirty-Eight.  

"Understood. You may return now."  

Without waiting for a reply, he transformed back into a streak of light and vanished.  

...  

Elsewhere—  

Amidst the bustling crowd, Zhang Jing, clad in plain gray robes, blended in seamlessly.  

He occasionally turned, his gaze piercing through the throng to survey his surroundings.  

After a moment, awe flashed in his eyes.  

He was currently standing on the foredeck of the Void Treasure Ship.  

Before him stretched the boundless void, while behind him loomed a towering ship structure resembling a majestic mountain range, thousands of zhang tall and dominating his entire field of vision.  

The entire Void Treasure Ship was encased in an almost imperceptible layer of spiritual light.  

"Just how big is this thing?"  

Zhang Jing first glanced at the colossal ship structure, then surveyed the vast deck spanning thousands of zhang.  

Awe filled his heart.  

"If an ordinary Void Treasure Ship is already this magnificent, how terrifying must the Dao Sect's legendary War Treasure Ships be?"  

At this thought, a glimmer of yearning flickered in his eyes.  

It was said that each War Treasure Ship was an independent minor world, establishing its own rules within its sphere of influence—a true weapon of conquest.  

He wondered what level of cultivation he would need to reach before he could even glimpse one, let alone own one.  

...  

Time flowed steadily.  

At a certain moment—  

The Void Treasure Ship beneath his feet trembled slightly.  

A hundred-zhang-tall phantom of a dragon-headed humanoid figure suddenly appeared above the crowd.  

The clamor instantly ceased.  

"Time's up! I am Qing Ya Zi, a Harmony Dao Realm cultivator of the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect. I will be overseeing this voyage of the Void Treasure Ship. We are expected to arrive at the Proud Cloud Immortal City in the Cave of True Splendor Heaven in three months. I hope you will all wait patiently and refrain from causing trouble."  

"Each ticket corresponds to a cabin. Communicate with your ticket via divine sense to locate your assigned cabin."  

"Aside from others' cabins, you are free to explore the rest of the ship. If any issues arise, you may seek me out on the top deck. Understood?"  

The dragon-headed Qing Ya Zi's phantom emphasized.  

"We understand. Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother," the crowd on the foredeck, including Zhang Jing, chorused in response.  

"Excellent!"  

With that, the hundred-zhang phantom gradually dissipated.  

On the deck, Zhang Jing's eyes flickered with surprise.  

He had initially assumed this Void Treasure Ship belonged to the Supreme Oneness Infinite Dao Sect. Now, it seemed it was operated by the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect.  

"Could it be that the Void Treasure Ships facilitating travel between the various human celestial realms are all managed by the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect?" Zhang Jing speculated.  

Just how many Void Treasure Ships must that entail? And how much fortune did they amass daily?  

Truly worthy of the name "Myriad Treasures."
