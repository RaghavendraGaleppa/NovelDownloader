**Chapter 114: Talent and Effort**

"One got away."

On the scorched earth, deep pits marred the landscape, as if it had just been plowed. Each pit contained a mangled corpse.

Of the seventeen Buddhist cultivators, one escaped. The remaining sixteen were all obliterated by Lü Yang's Nine Heavens Capital Registry Secret Demonic Yin Thunder, and the Buddhist radiance, which should have countered the yin evil, had no effect whatsoever.

However, this was normal. So-called restraint was always relative. For example, fire and water countered each other; normally, water extinguished fire. But if a blaze engulfed a thousand li, what good would a single cup of water do? The disparity between Lü Yang and these Buddhist cultivators was even greater than that.

In this regard, Guangming, who escaped, had a very clear understanding.

At this moment, in a mountain forest several thousand li away from Lü Yang, was the gathering point for the Buddhist cultivators. Guanghai, the leader of the Pure Land faction this time, was here.

"Hmm?"

Suddenly, Guanghai, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, opened them. A visible golden Buddhist radiance abruptly rippled around him.

The next second, Guangming stumbled out from within the Buddhist radiance. The moment he landed, he looked around in terror. Only after confirming that the terrifying figure was nowhere in sight did he let out a heartfelt sigh of relief.

"I escaped! I escaped!"

It was not in vain that he had deliberately gathered all the Buddhist cultivators, using them as meat shields. He had pretended to prepare a grand technique, but in reality, he had activated the "Concentric Knot Life Talisman" to flee.

The Concentric Knot Life Talisman, an Attainment Treasure held by Pure Land Buddhist cultivators, allowed a marked cultivator to be teleported to the talisman owner's side. This effect could also be reversed. Guangming had activated it using a secret technique, instantly teleporting himself to Guanghai's side.

"What happened?"

Looking at the disheveled Guangming, Guanghai frowned. "Did you encounter a powerful enemy? How many were there? Where are your companions who were with you?"

Guangming was momentarily stunned. At this moment, his mind raced. Tell the truth? Are you kidding? Should he tell his senior brother that he had deserted during battle? That would be certain death! After all, to account for the fallen Buddhist cultivators, Guangming believed his senior brother would not hesitate to use his head as a sacrifice.

Guangming's eyes darted around, and the next second, a look of sorrow appeared on his face. He said with a choked voice, "Many! Too many to count! Those demonic cultivators seemed to have prepared a trump card. I fought to the death, killing a few before barely escaping with my life. The others were all slaughtered by the demonic cultivators…"

"What?"

Before Guangming had finished speaking, Guanghai's expression turned serious. He suddenly felt as if they were facing a formidable foe. Had the demonic cultivators from the Prime Saint Demonic Sect already gathered?

"We must find a way to eliminate them."

Guanghai took this extremely seriously and immediately called over another Buddhist cultivator in a kasaya. "Guanghui, take the Dragon Deva Division to eradicate that group of demonic cultivators." The Buddhist cultivators of the Profound Joy Pure Land were divided into Eight Divisions of Buddhist Deities, among which the Dragon Deva Division ranked second, considered Guanghai's most elite unit.

Then he looked at Guangming again. "Junior Brother Guangming, you lead the way."

"Ah? Me?" Guangming froze, his mouth twitching slightly, filled with reluctance. However, under Guanghai's gaze, he could only grit his teeth and nod with a forced smile.

*It'll be fine, this time it should be alright, right?*

Looking at the imposing, hundred-strong Dragon Deva Division of Buddhist cultivators, Guangming felt a little more composed. After all, there was only one enemy. The weakest cultivators in the Dragon Deva Division were at mid-stage Qi Condensation, and Guanghui, who led them, had cultivated three Great Incantations. At critical moments, he could summon the other cultivators to perform a secret technique, conjuring a Dragon-Elephant Vast Power Vajra, an entity of incredibly high status, almost equivalent to a Protector Vajra, second only to a Foundation Establishment True Person.

With such power, how could they lose? No matter how formidable that great demonic cultivator was, he was still only at Qi Condensation. If a hundred Buddhist cultivators swarmed him, he couldn't possibly kill them all before his spiritual energy ran out!

Meanwhile, back on the scorched battlefield.

"True Lord above… a Foundation Establishment True Person can actually enter a secret realm?"

Looking at Lü Yang's back, Qin Tianhe was utterly bewildered. Evidently, the misunderstanding from his previous encounter with Lü Yang had not been resolved; it had only deepened. But this was not surprising, given how overwhelmingly Lü Yang had just fought. To Qin Tianhe, it was no different from facing a Foundation Establishment True Person.

However, the next second, Qin Tianhe became excited again. Although he didn't know how Lü Yang, as a "Foundation Establishment True Person," had entered the secret realm, it was enough to know that Lü Yang was a True Person from their Saint Sect.

This battle was secure now!

At the same time, Lü Yang paid no attention to Qin Tianhe's misunderstanding. His attention was entirely focused on the Buddhist cultivator corpses spread across the ground before him.

"Perhaps I can make use of them..."

With this thought, Lü Yang immediately performed a hand seal and unfurled the Myriad Souls Banner. In an instant, dense white mist began to drift out from the surrounding corpses. Immediately after, these Buddhist cultivators' bodies disintegrated into pure Qi, their souls floating out and being drawn one by one into the Myriad Souls Banner. Once their true spirits entered the banner, the white mist began to reassemble, manifesting the sixteen Buddhist cultivators anew. They all bowed in unison to Lü Yang.

"Greetings, Master!"

Lü Yang nodded in satisfaction. Looking at the still largely empty Myriad Souls Banner, his heart burned with anticipation. This Path Contention War might also be a great opportunity! An opportunity to perfectly refine the Myriad Souls Banner! After all, this Path Contention War gathered so many cultivators from Jiangdong, Jiangxi, the Daoist Court, and the Pure Land. These lively, hopping figures scattered across the mountains and plains were all potential 'talents'!

"Interesting..."

Just then, Patriarch Tingyou's figure appeared behind Lü Yang, observing the Buddhist banner spirits with keen interest. Then he suddenly spoke, "I once referenced Jiangdong's Dao of Heavenly Hunt when I created Yama's Hall. Now it seems Jiangxi also has something valuable. If you can collect more of these Buddhist cultivators, perhaps I can refine and improve Yama's Hall, elevating its power to the next level."

"Oh?"

Patriarch Tingyou's suggestion immediately made Lü Yang's eyes light up, as he suddenly recalled the Dragon Subduing Temple that Dragon Subduing Arhat had used against him in his previous life. The Dragon Subduing Temple was, in essence, Dragon Subduing Arhat's Dao Foundation. However, Buddhist cultivators established their foundation not in the Foundation Establishment realm, but within the Profound Joy Pure Land opened by the Venerable of Jiangxi. Their Dao Foundation was their own temple. The more prosperous the incense offerings and the more Buddhist disciples gathered in a temple, the stronger its master became.

If Patriarch Tingyou could adapt this concept into Yama's Hall, then with the sheer number of banner spirits in the Myriad Souls Banner, it would be enough to make his strength take another leap! Without a word, Lü Yang immediately cupped his hands. "Then I'll trouble Ancestor with this!"

Patriarch Tingyou sighed. "Strengthening Yama's Hall also strengthens the foundation of my Witch-Ghost Dao. This is all I can do now." He added, "After this, try not to disturb me. I need to go into seclusion for a while." He paused, then lamented, "It's a pity I collected so few Buddhist banner spirits this time, only a dozen or so. Otherwise, my rate of comprehension would be even faster..."

As his voice faded, Patriarch Tingyou led the Buddhist cultivators into the grotto-heaven within the Myriad Souls Banner, clearly intending to thoroughly research Buddhist cultivation methods.

Seeing this, Lü Yang finally understood the correct way to use Patriarch Tingyou. Sending him out to fight others? That's thinking too small, far too small! He was truly a technical talent! His effectiveness far surpassed the Enlightenment Dao Jade Slips of his past lives; anything requiring enlightenment could practically be delegated to him!

From this, it was clear that as long as the exceptionally talented Patriarch Tingyou desperately exerted himself, Lü Yang would undoubtedly go even further in this life! By then, he might even be able to tell others, "My Lü Yang's current cultivation realm is entirely due to my extraordinary talent and unceasing effort!"
