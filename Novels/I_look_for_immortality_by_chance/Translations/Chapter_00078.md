# Chapter 78: Madness!

But Yun Hanxiu seemed to have forgotten one thing.

The control of the situation had never been in her hands.

"Whoosh!"

While she was still hesitating in her heart, Gu Yuan had already activated the Cloud-Concealing Mist Seal. A thick fog that blotted out the sky and torrential rain suddenly descended.

Back on the Dragon Tooth Treasure Boat, Gu Yuan had already known that Yun Hanxiu had ulterior motives and was no ordinary person. 

But he never expected her to be a cold-faced, maddened rogue cultivator at heart.

What distinguishes rogue cultivators isn't their methods, but their state of mind. 

A rogue cultivator's heart is wild—they are never truly at peace. They revel in bloodshed, in combat, in dancing on the knife's edge, in violently seizing everything they desire.

Among rogue cultivators, there are two main factions.

The first is the Sunlight Sect—these are also lunatics, but they adhere to a final shred of morality. They don't plunder indiscriminately but instead "rob the robbers," killing evildoers to seize resources.

The second is the Primordial Demon Sect—these cultivators have no concept of morality. If they see something they want on you, they will take it by force.

The Primordial Demon Sect is the main reason the term "rogue cultivator" has such a foul reputation.

But the Sunlight Sect is no saintly group either—they act ruthlessly, killing without hesitation, half-mad and half-deranged, sometimes even more terrifying.

Thus, Gu Yuan had no qualms about striking first.

No matter which faction she belonged to, rogue cultivators were never good news.

As for Gu Yuan himself, he had always adhered to the maxim from the Rogue Cultivator's Code:

"Balance light and shadow—that is the true path!"

He had the methods of a rogue cultivator, but not the heart of one.

These thoughts flashed through Gu Yuan's mind like lightning, yet his hands never paused in their movements.

"Clang!"

With a wave of his hand, hundreds of peach blossom sword energies surged forth, riding the mist and rain as they all converged on Yun Hanxiu.

Not stopping there, with a thought, the Purple Lightning Chisel and the Three Decays Mirror also erupted with brilliance, joining the assault.

The most formidable combatants in the world were usually found among rogue cultivators or the peerless geniuses of top-tier sects.

The reason the term "rogue cultivator" struck fear into hearts wasn't just because of their infamous reputation for murder and plunder—it was also because their methods were truly lethal!

Thus, facing Yun Hanxiu, who was a full realm above him, Gu Yuan held nothing back.

Amidst the storm of techniques, the Secret Origin Decree Arrow in his palm also began to glow.

Meanwhile, at the center of the onslaught, Yun Hanxiu felt a chill in her heart, as if the karmic retribution for all her past plundering had descended upon her at once.

Her senses were obscured, her seals suppressed, thunder roared, sword energies clashed, and the mirror's radiance filled the sky... Beyond the impenetrable mist, an aura that made her heart race was gathering.

Every one of Gu Yuan's techniques was formidable on its own—how much more so when unleashed simultaneously?

"Gu Yuan, don't pretend you're not a rogue cultivator!" 

"You're not from the Five Great Clans, nor are you a direct descendant of the Seven Veins! If you weren't a rogue cultivator, how could you have so many techniques?!"

Faced with the overwhelming assault, Yun Hanxiu clenched her teeth and shouted in fury.

But her hands never stopped moving. With a thought, she activated the most radiant seal in her dantian.

"Boom!"

In an instant, violent flames erupted from Yun Hanxiu's body. At the same time, she opened her mouth and exhaled a powerful gust of wind.

The wind fanned the flames, and the flames fed the wind—in moments, a blazing inferno engulfed the surrounding area, scorching and wild.

Even the Cloud-Concealing Mist Seal seemed to be suppressed in turn.

The mist and rain were evaporated and dispersed by the sea of fire.

Yet the purple lightning, the vibrant peach blossoms, and the silver mirror light continued their relentless advance toward Yun Hanxiu.

Yun Hanxiu's expression changed drastically. She had never imagined that activating two of her most powerful seals would only counter one of Gu Yuan's techniques.

The Cloud-Concealing Mist Seal was indeed an advanced technique, but since when had it become so overwhelmingly powerful?

But she had no time to dwell on it. With a wave of her hand, three defensive artifacts rose into the air, positioning themselves before her. At the same time, she swiftly activated her protective seals, summoning ethereal blue lotuses around her.

"Crack!"

"Clang!"

Yet in the void, three golden rings, like bloodthirsty sharks, homed in on her artifacts. Her three defensive treasures were instantly immobilized, their spiritual essence drained.

At the same time, the purple lightning shattered the blue lotuses before her.

"Go!"

In desperation, she flung out a silver beetle, placing it between herself and the oncoming attack.

The silver beetle, of unknown origin, had a carapace that shimmered with a strange radiance, as if it possessed a natural barrier that neutralized the lightning.

But the peach blossom sword seals arrived in an instant, spinning lightly as they reduced the beetle to dust.

"Clang!"

Yun Hanxiu's face twisted in horror. She activated seal after seal, but none could withstand the sword energies.

---

Her hidden techniques, each capable of killing a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, had already been dismantled by Gu Yuan earlier. The three artifacts hidden at the cave entrance and the three she had just deployed were all rendered useless. Now, she truly had few options left.

One by one, her seals were sliced apart by the sword energies, while in the distance, an aura that chilled her to the bone continued to gather.

The shadow of death loomed over her like an incoming tide.

Yet in this moment of crisis, an unnatural excitement surged in Yun Hanxiu's heart. Her gaze toward Gu Yuan was tinged with madness.

This was a true rogue cultivator!

This was the kind of rogue cultivator she aspired to be!

Wielding countless techniques, ruthless and unstoppable!

"Shh—"

Threads of sword energy pierced through Yun Hanxiu's final defenses, leaving bloody gashes on her jade-like skin.

Blood flowed freely, her flesh stung with pain—yet Yun Hanxiu only grew more exhilarated. She couldn't help but lick her lips, her excitement mounting.

But the fear of death was relentless. Forcing down her manic thrill, she pulled out a black jade slip and shouted at Gu Yuan:

"You can't kill me!"

"I possess a body-refining seal that can alter one's spiritual roots!"

Yet instead of pausing, the peach blossom sword energies accelerated further.

In the distance, the dazzling arrow light rumbled like a volcano, ready to erupt.

Seeing this, Yun Hanxiu felt both terror and exhilaration. Staring at Gu Yuan's cold expression, her madness resurfaced.

Once the intent to kill arises, only blood can quell it—unswayed by greed or words!

This young man before her was undoubtedly a true rogue cultivator!

Trembling inwardly, Yun Hanxiu acted swiftly, tearing apart a golden talisman.

An aura surpassing the Qi Refining realm emerged in the void. Yun Hanxiu looked at Gu Yuan with a strange expression.

"Gu Yuan, Gu Yuan... I'll remember you. I will surpass you—I will trample you beneath my feet!"

With these words and a deranged smile, her body was enveloped in golden light, transforming into a phantom that gradually dissipated within the cave.

"Boom!"

But at that moment, a blinding golden radiance erupted from Gu Yuan's hand, piercing through the void and striking Yun Hanxiu.

"Bang!"

Yun Hanxiu's figure solidified once more.

Then the sword light and arrow struck her in unison.
