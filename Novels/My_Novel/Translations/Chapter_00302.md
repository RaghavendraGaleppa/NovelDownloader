Chapter 302: Journey to Feilong City, Winds and Clouds Gather; Huang Lu as Bait? The Madam's Lure?

Mid-October arrived in the blink of an eye. Li Xian had subdued the Ghost Python Spear, taking his strength a step further. The Wicked Phantom Spear, the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidities and Gathering Yang Meridians, and the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape all progressed steadily.

The "Essence of Heaven and Earth" within his body had been completely digested. To refine the cauldron, he needed to host a "Cauldron-Rising Banquet," purchase "Dew," buy "Yin Bamboo Charcoal," hire manpower... all of which would cost thousands of taels of silver. Although Li Xian had over a thousand taels stored, it was still difficult to refine the cauldron alone.

He had to put this thought aside for now.

Recently... various elders had rented the Water Stone Treasure Cauldron to boil the flesh of rare treasures. After the dew was boiled by fire, it hung between Mount Wanglong, creating a misty, ethereal scene, truly like immortal clouds descending to the world.

In the boat lanes between the various towns, several decorated boats were docked. For a long time, they had only entered but not left. The Flower Cage Gate was stirring with undercurrents, preparing for a major event.

In the midst of peace and stability, November arrived.

The season for the "Tail-Extending Shrimp" of Dongran Lake had already passed. The shrimp beasts had dived to the bottom of the lake, and cold waves rippled across its surface. The people of Peach Blossom Town gradually added more padded jackets to their attire.

In a deep alley of Peach Blossom Town.

Li Xian ordered a jar of Peach Blossom Immortal Wine, two Flower Drunken Eggs, along with several side dishes and a bowl of plain congee. Whenever he was tired from martial arts practice, he would wander the streets and alleys. Occasionally, when a craving struck, he would simply find a wine shop and order some food to enjoy.

The weather at this time was cool and refreshing, with a gentle, non-bothersome breeze.

The sweet aroma of wine, the fresh fragrance of eggs... a bite of a Drunken Egg, a sip of fine wine, then a drink of congee to cleanse the palate, and a taste of side dishes to add color and flavor. The days were leisurely and comfortable. Looking into the distance, the mountain peaks were handsome and elegant, the lake waves were calm and distant, and occasionally a soft, gentle breeze swept through the streets and alleys, bringing a faint floral scent to the nose.

It was truly like a paradise.

He felt a sudden realization: "All things in the world have two sides, or even more. The Lishan Sword Sect is a famous orthodox sect, and its elders are known as gentlemen. Yet, there is such a hypocrite as Sheng Yunfei. Although the Flower Cage Gate is despicable and shameless, at its Water坛 base, the people live and work in peace and happiness, just like a paradise. The happiness and peace here are truly rare to find elsewhere."

"I, who long for freedom and ease, have instead become a great flower thief."

Feeling a slight intoxication, he gave a self-mocking, light laugh.

He savored the Peach Blossom Immortal Wine; its taste was truly unique.

Seeing the shopkeeper bustling about, sending wine and dishes, always having money coming in—though mostly in broken silver and scattered copper—one penny of diligence brings one penny of gain. He couldn't help but think:

"I have a bee farm and an orchard... but for the bee beasts to gather flowers and make honey, it takes time and effort. For the orchard to mature and bear fruit, it also takes time and effort. Although these two businesses have many benefits, they are ultimately 'at the mercy of the weather,' not something I can decide. Enjoying the fruits of others' labor isn't bad, but... if I could have a method, relying on my own abilities, to truly earn money and have some control over it, that would be much better."

"Moreover, Sister Liuli once mentioned to me that when she was in the Nangong family, she took over a Miao Pearl Workshop at the age of twelve. Over the years of managing it, the scale was quite considerable. Her daily food, clothing, and expenses were all earned by herself. Many family members even owed her money. If I could set up some businesses and entrust them to Sister Liuli to manage..."

Nangong Liuli was confined to the residence, inevitably bored and listless. Contacting the outside world in this way would be beneficial. He sipped his Peach Blossom Immortal Wine, thinking that with his current abilities, perhaps he could open another "winery"?

If he used "honey" and "flowers" to brew fine wine, he could earn money much faster. Li Xian's "Ingestion" skill was perfected, he had grasped the "Appraisal" trait, and his "Culinary" skill was also perfected. Every time he drank a fine wine, he would mentally appraise its brewing method and fire control.

He appraised the various brewing methods in the street wine shops. By identifying the diverse methods, he could learn from them, gather the strengths of many, and attempt to brew fine wine himself. His mind was active, and after returning home, he discussed it with Nangong Liuli.

Upon hearing that he wanted to run a winery, Nangong Liuli's interest was suddenly piqued. She was quite interested in business之道. Having been influenced by it since childhood, she was quite knowledgeable about its intricacies. She might be able to help.

That night, the two had a long, intimate talk. Li Xian took paper and pen and, based on his own understanding, wrote down the wine-making process. Nangong Liuli then planned how to manage the winery, how to recruit workers...

This winery was a whim, but upon detailed discussion, it seemed highly promising. From that day on, in his spare time from martial arts practice, Li Xian began to try his hand at wine-making. Relying on the Five Elements layout in the courtyard, it took him just over ten days to forcefully ferment several jars of fine wine.

The two drank the fine wine together.

They both found it delicious, sweet, and quite distinctive. Li Xian then used several hundred taels to set up a small winery. He decided to make a small trial run and entrust it to Nangong Liuli to manage. Although Nangong Liuli had difficulty going out, she could manage the winery properly through letters. She also practiced martial arts in her daily life, but not as diligently as Li Xian. Passing her leisure time this way was quite good.

Everything was going well.

[Wicked Phantom Spear]
[Proficiency: 2689/35000 Perfection]

[Five Organs Avoiding Turbidities and Gathering Yang Meridians · Five Organs Chapter]
[Proficiency: 1210/24000 Great Perfection]

[Minor Five Elements Strange Escape]
[Proficiency: 65/100]

Living in such peace and stability, Li Xian had the bee farm and orchard as a foundation, and now the winery as an attempt. His livelihood and martial arts path were progressing steadily and expanding step by step. With fame on the outside and a beautiful companion on the inside.

Li Xian's "Art of the Golden Light" recipe was still missing one ingredient: "Morning Yellow Dew." Now that the situation was stable, he tried to inquire about clues to the Morning Yellow Dew. However, his information channels were blocked, and he had few trusted informants. Moreover, it was difficult to enter and exit the Water坛, so he had no clues for a long time.

Among the island's inhabitants, only Yan Hao was most trusted by him. The two were like teacher and friend. Yan Hao belonged to the "obsessed" type, loving only the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape, even neglecting his martial arts practice. He had no thoughts about "Human Yellow" rare treasures.

Yet, he held a high position in the Water坛, with relatively wide access to information.

Li Xian asked him to keep an eye out. Yan Hao didn't think much of it and agreed. He told Li Xian that if he got any clues, he would notify him.

Time passed until mid-to-late November.

One day.

Li Xian went to seek Yan Hao's advice on the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape. Through a discussion, his understanding of the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape deepened, and he felt greatly benefited. It was late into the night when Li Xian was preparing to return home, but Yan Hao said, "Wu Cuo, don't be in a hurry. Why don't you stay for some tea first?"

He waved his sleeve. The furniture in the house slowly moved, clearing a viewing terrace. Yan Hao sat on a cushion and filled two teacups.

Li Xian sat down and asked, "Deputy Envoy Yan, are you in such a refined mood today?"

Yan Hao smiled and said, "Not exactly refined. But the matter you asked me to look into, I've found some clues."

Li Xian asked, "Oh?"

Yan Hao said, "The Morning Yellow Dew is a Human Yellow rare treasure, extremely rare. But recently, there have been three places where its traces have appeared. You came today, and I was originally going to tell you. But we got so engrossed in our conversation that I only just remembered."

Li Xian thought: "This Deputy Envoy Yan is truly an obsessed person. To befriend such a person is truly a good thing. Among the many elders in the Water坛, even Chief Envoy Shi has several beautiful companions. Only Yan Hao devotes his heart to studying the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape. He stays in the Flower Cage Gate as a deputy envoy of the Water坛 because the unique terrain here allows his Minor Five Elements Strange Escape to display its full power."

Yan Hao said, "The first place is Luoxia Slope."

"Luoxia Slope is located in Yunan Dao, Muyue Prefecture, and Chaosheng Terrace. Its terrain is unique and gifted by nature. Every few years, Morning Yellow Dew descends from the heavens. At that time, it inevitably causes disputes. In recent years, as the world approaches chaos, the people's livelihoods have withered and become miserable. However, the more chaotic the times, the more heroes rise and stars shine. The Morning Yellow Dew... this year, there is an eighty percent chance it will appear in Luoxia Slope."

Li Xian's heart stirred, and he inquired for specific details.

Yan Hao said, "We are located in Huaiyin Prefecture, which is extremely far from Muyue Prefecture. Moreover, to seize the Morning Yellow Dew, one must compete with the local prodigies and heroes. The local clans, such as the Wang and Li clans, have considerable strength."

He smiled and said, "If you rush there now, you probably won't get the Morning Yellow Dew. But there might still be some yellow flower dishes left." (Note: A play on words, "yellow flower dishes" sounds similar to "Morning Yellow Dew" but means something else.)

Li Xian smiled and said, "Deputy Envoy Yan, you really know how to joke. It seems I have no fate with the Morning Yellow Dew at this place."

Seeing Li Xian's relaxed and carefree attitude, without a trace of regret, Yan Hao couldn't help but feel a secret admiration. He continued, "The second place for the Morning Yellow Dew... is even farther, and it's uncertain whether it's true or false. Recently, there have been rumors that on the Snow Palace in the Northern Heavenly Domain, an endless yellow glow appeared. It might be a sign of the Morning Yellow Dew descending."

Li Xian thought: "The Southern Heavenly Domain, Yunan Dao, is already infinitely vast. The Northern Heavenly Domain is far away; whether I can even get there is questionable." He held even less hope and asked, "And the third place?"

At this moment, the tea in the cup was finished.

Yan Hao poured half a cup of hot tea again, took a light sip, and said leisurely, "This third place嘛, it's within Feilong City in Huaiyin Prefecture."

Yan Hao said, "I don't know if this is true or not. Recently, news has emerged that a Human Yellow rare treasure, the Morning Yellow Dew, has appeared in Feilong City. But the price is very high, likely requiring over a hundred thousand taels, or even several hundred thousand taels."

"Human Yellow rare treasures are inherently rare and hard to come by. This matter depends greatly on fate. Someone might want to spend a thousand or ten thousand taels but cannot even touch it. Someone else, without spending a penny, might have it fall right into their lap. If there is truly a fate, naturally... after several twists and turns, it will eventually be yours."

Li Xian sighed, "That may be so..." His gaze drifted into the distance. He gently savored the tea's fragrance. He thought that he already had the "bee farm" and "orchard" businesses, earning over a thousand taels a month, and over ten thousand a year. At this rate of accumulation, it would take ten or dozens of years... to barely be able to afford it.

"Human Yellow rare treasures contain the Way of Art, and their value should be just so. I previously stumbled upon 'Golden Scales' and then obtained 'Yellow Nine Ginseng.' Both were brought by opportunity. Now that I truly need to spend money to buy one, I realize how precious these treasures are."

He silently calculated a sum.

Li Xian said, "Thank you, Deputy Envoy Yan. I, Wu Cuo, will take my leave for now."

Yan Hao smiled meaningfully, "Do you have any ideas?" Li Xian said, "Wu Cuo is short on funds and wouldn't dare to covet it for now. I'd better be honest and stable, improve my martial arts, and manage my businesses. If I encounter another Human Yellow rare treasure in the future when I have more money, then I can think about it."

Yan Hao said, "Brother Wu Cuo, don't be impatient. The Morning Yellow Dew at Luoxia Slope and in the Northern Heavenly Domain is beyond your reach. But the one in Feilong City might not be无缘 with you."

Li Xian asked, "Please be explicit, Deputy Envoy Yan."

Yan Hao smiled, "I heard that the sale of this rare treasure cannot be entirely with silver. There are other ways to obtain the Morning Yellow Dew. I heard... if you can satisfy a few conditions, you might even get the Morning Yellow Dew without spending money. This Human Yellow rare treasure is causing quite a stir in Feilong City. Many people are rushing to Feilong City, hoping to obtain the rare treasure."

Li Xian thought: "If that's the case, it wouldn't hurt to go and take a look." But then he thought: "Any Human Yellow rare treasure is secretly consumed. Why is this Morning Yellow Dew known to everyone?"

Yan Hao continued, "Furthermore, Feilong City is truly a muddy pool right now, very lively... Recently, the Water坛 and Earth坛 have been discussing a major matter, which is also related to Feilong City."

Li Xian asked, "Is it also because of the Morning Yellow Dew?"

Yan Hao said, "No. The matters my Flower Cage Gate discusses are always related to 'women.' Rare treasures are good, but they are not as good as having a beautiful companion by your side. Feilong City shows signs of chaos. My Flower Cage Gate has always been involved in 'flirting and causing trouble' and 'fearing the world isn't chaotic enough,' so we want to take this opportunity to try and fish in troubled waters."

"Thus... if you are clever enough, you can also try to fish in troubled waters. You might just be able to get that Morning Yellow Dew? You might have a fate with that Morning Yellow Dew."

Li Xian suddenly understood: "So the major matter the Water坛 and Earth坛 have been discussing recently is related to Feilong City. It seems Feilong City is extremely unstable. If I rashly go there, there will definitely be danger. But... I just heard. Morning Yellow Dew is extremely rare. Either it's at Luoxia Slope, controlled by aristocratic families. How could a lone warrior like me win it? Or it appears in the Northern Heavenly Domain... and if it weren't for the chaos, how could I, with my financial resources, ever hope to touch it?"

Li Xian said, "Thank you for your guidance, Deputy Envoy Yan."

Yan Hao waved his hand with a smile, "It's not guidance. This news has already spread outside; I didn't expend any effort. If you truly want to go to Feilong City, just inform Chief Envoy Shi."

"Coincidentally, in the past few days, Ye Cheng, Han Zisha, Tang Feng, Meng Han, An Weicheng, the Earth坛's Tang Wenshu, Li Jiu... and others, have all been rushing to Feilong City one after another, preparing for a major event. You can go along and help out. And... it might just be your opportunity to become famous in the world."

Li Xian's face twitched. He thought that if he became famous as a "great flower thief," how could he ever wash away the notoriety. He was carefree and open-minded by nature and didn't care much about others cursing him, but he still hoped for a better reputation. He then thought: "Given the current situation, if I go with them, I can't possibly not contribute. However, rare treasures are hard to come by; it would be a pity to miss out. Even if there's a slim hope, I can try a little. I'll go and see the situation first, and if there's any issue, I'll adapt accordingly."

He immediately agreed to go together.

It was now dark, and street lamps were lit. Li Xian and Yan Hao chatted for a while longer before Li Xian got up to leave. Walking along the street, observing the lively scene, he thought about his upcoming departure from the island, and his feelings were surprisingly complex.

"This island helped me escape a dangerous situation. I used this place to advance my martial arts, enrich my knowledge, and even obtained the Ghost Python Spear, the Wicked Phantom Spear technique, the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape, and many treasures and skills. It can truly be considered a half-blessed land."

Returning to the Green Ox Residence. Li Xian couldn't bear to hide it and told Nangong Liuli about the "Feilong City" matter.

Nangong Liuli felt extremely reluctant to part, and she naturally didn't want to be separated from Li Xian. However, it concerned Li Xian's future and the advancement of his martial arts. Even if she was reluctant, she had no choice but to agree. But after Li Xian left the island, she would be alone in her empty chamber, inevitably feeling lonely and worried.

She imagined that the days ahead would be difficult to endure.

Li Xian began to prepare for his departure.

He arranged the affairs of the bee farm and orchard properly. He told Fu Dachun, the manager of the bee farm, that if there were any important matters, he should go to the Green Ox Residence and follow Nangong Liuli's arrangements.

The Five Elements layout in the Green Ox Residence was profound. Nangong Liuli held the Five Elements flags, skillfully using the strange escapes, formations, and layouts in the courtyard, with many wondrous and effective uses. It could transmit sound, conceal, confuse enemies, control fire, prevent water, and avoid poison. Deep within the residence, she only needed to call out softly, and she could use the layout to send her voice to the outer courtyard.

When Fu Dachun, the winery manager, and the orchard manager came to report on business details, this layout would be of great use. Nangong Liuli could manage the island's businesses without ever leaving her home.

With her in charge, the winery, bee farm, and orchard were sure to flourish. For the "Feilong City" trip, the many elders of the Flower Cage Gate were leaving their cages one after another, so there were fewer experts on the island. Nangong Liuli was the daughter of a powerful family, and her strength was not weak to begin with. Moreover, the Five Elements layout in the courtyard, with its complex illusion and phantom formations, was enough to protect herself.

Thus.

Li Xian had no worries left behind.

The day of departure was approaching. The two were inseparable, expressing their feelings to the fullest, regardless of day or night. In the blink of an eye, three days later, Li Xian would board Elder Tang Feng's decorated boat at the chen hour (7-9 am) to leave the island and head for Feilong City.

Although Nangong Liuli had known this day would come, when it truly arrived, she found it hard to part, and her eyes inevitably turned red as she sobbed softly. It was still early, and she was boiling lotus seed plain congee to wait. The weather was getting colder, and the morning chill was at its thickest. A bowl of lotus congee warmed his hands and feet.

The two lingered for a moment. As the sky gradually brightened, Li Xian saw that the time was near and smiled, "Sister Liuli, I'm going now. Is there any treasure you want? I'll buy it back for you."

Nangong Liuli smiled, "No need, go ahead."

After Li Xian took a few steps, she suddenly felt endless sorrow. Before they had even parted, her heart was already wracked with pain: "That Feilong City is by no means a good place. I had heard rumors when I was still in my family, but I regret not paying attention at the time. Wu Cuo, my dear brother, your departure truly worries me so." She couldn't help but catch up and gently hug him from behind, saying, "Good brother, you must be careful. It's cold outside, don't catch a chill. If you encounter anything, don't try to be brave, try to stay in the back. You... you should think of your sister in everything."

"Your relationship with them isn't bad. But your natures are ultimately different. You may not be a gentleman or a good man, but you are not a heinous villain either. Don't trust them too much. You..."

Nangong Liuli's eyes shimmered with tears, "You... must be well."

Li Xian's heart tightened, and he nodded heavily.

Tang Feng's decorated boat was "thirteen zhang" long and "four zhang" high. Its appearance was plain, and its form was like an ordinary merchant ship. Dozens of Flower Cage Gate disciples lined up to board the boat in an orderly manner.

Tang Feng stood on the deck, wearing a light gray cloth robe, the lake wind making his clothes snap and flutter. Seeing Li Xian's figure, he laughed, "Brother Hua!"

Li Xian stepped on the Seven Star Step, his Qi condensing into a ball, gathering light momentum, and leaped up. His figure gracefully floated out several zhang, continuously stepping in the air in mid-air, dodging and weaving, and landed steadily on the deck.

Tang Feng laughed, "Excellent lightness skill!" Li Xian said, "I'm showing off."

A middle-aged man said, "You must be Brother Hua Wu Cuo, I've long admired your great name. It's just as the rumors say, elegant and extraordinary."

Li Xian said, "You flatter me." He looked at the speaker, who was neatly dressed, with a square face and narrow eyes, and some red pimples on his cheeks.

This person's name was Kong Yu. He was one of Tang Feng's trusted aides for over a decade and was also an Ink-Stamp Disciple. Kong Yu said, "Brother Hua, a pleasure!" He extended his hand.

Li Xian smiled, "A pleasure." He shook hands. He immediately felt an extremely strong force coming from the other's palm, fierce and powerful, faintly hidden with hostility.

It turned out that Li Xian's popularity was at its peak. He had been promoted to "Ink-Stamp Disciple" just months after joining the sect. Rumor had it he was already a "preparatory elder," just lacking one or two qualifications. Within a year or two at most, he would be called "Elder Hua."

Ink-Stamp Disciples were the core of the sect, deeply connected to it. Their lifelong pursuit was to be promoted to elder. This Kong Yu had been scheming for over a decade, exhausting himself to serve the sect, yet he couldn't compare to Li Xian's few moments of glory. How could his heart be balanced? He felt extremely resentful, so he used this opportunity to test him.

Li Xian's expression remained normal. He thought that since he was taking a boat off the island, he needed to consider Tang Feng's face, and he wasn't in a hurry to get revenge. He applied a little force to his hand as a warning. If Kong Yu didn't know what was good for him, then he wouldn't need to save face.

Kong Yu raised his eyebrows slightly, not realizing that Li Xian was showing tolerance and restraint. He secretly thought: "He really does have some ability, but just this much, he's probably no match for me. Although this kid is famous and highly regarded by Chief Envoy Shi, and has his merits, his hand-to-hand skills will suffer against me."

He increased the force in his hand. His internal Qi surged towards his palm, executing the martial art 'Iron Bone Hand'. Dark light burst from his knuckles and finger gaps, his proficiency quite profound. But it was still ineffective. Kong Yu was startled, and just as he was in doubt, he suddenly felt an irresistible counterforce surge back.

His expression changed instantly, his composure lost, and he hesitated to speak. At this moment, he felt he was in a dilemma. He wanted to beg for mercy but couldn't bring himself to lose face. So he gritted his teeth and held on, cold sweat streaming down his forehead, his body trembling slightly.

Tang Feng watched this scene from the side and said nothing. Martial arts inevitably involve disputes; the strong act arrogantly, and the weak suffer.

A moment later, Kong Yu spoke, "Bro-Brother Hua... I admit defeat, please... please let go quickly."

Li Xian glanced sideways at him, secretly weighing: "This person seems easygoing on the surface but harbors malicious intentions. If this were elsewhere, I'd definitely make him pay. But this is Tang Feng's decorated boat, after all. I have to give him some face." So he let go.

Tang Feng said, "Wu Cuo, come, let me introduce you to a few people."

Tang Feng had been an "Elder of the Flower Cage Gate" for decades.

He had cultivated many trusted aides. This trip to Feilong City was fraught with hidden dragons and crouching tigers, already a deep pool, and recently the trend was becoming more and more turbulent. How could Tang Feng dare to be careless? So he brought many strong trusted aides. There were the 'Three Ink-Stamps': Kong Yu, He Wangfu, and Wei Ze. All had cultivation near or at the second stage of martial arts.

But due to their humble origins, they had few resources. Their martial arts realm was inevitably achieved through "enduring" and "grinding," so their strength was slightly weaker. However, the three were proficient in formations. If they led a formation, their capabilities were not shallow.

There were also "Five Elements Shield Flower Formation," "Separating Flowers and Shifting Shadows Formation," "Lingering and Returning Formation"... and many other disciples whose martial arts skills were average, barely reaching the Food Essence Realm, but who trained together diligently and focused on forming formations.

In total, there were "twenty-four" people. Their weapons and armor were very unique, specially forged according to the needs of the formations. Every time Tang Feng refined a cauldron, these people would definitely get a share of the soup. And every few months, he would need to refine a cauldron specifically for them to share the fine meat.

Building this lineup required considerable effort.

Li Xian pondered: "Tang Feng's strength was already not bad, and he has Kong Yu, He Wangfu, and Wei Ze to support him. Additionally, twenty-four trusted aides who meticulously practice formations and follow his commands."

"But it's a bit neglectful of his own strength. What if this large group of trusted aides' formation falls into chaos?"

About half an hour later, all the Flower Cage Gate disciples had boarded the boat. The ferry envoy, Jin Shichang, boarded to guide them.

Tang Feng saw that everything was ready and felt a surge of heroic spirit. He gave a loud shout and waved his large hand. The disciples raised the sails and weighed anchor... all very busy. A dozen disciples went to the bottom of the decorated boat and worked together to turn the oars. They chanted "Hey," "Ha," "Hey," "Ha" in unison.

With everyone's combined effort, the decorated boat sailed towards the depths of the lake.

Li Xian stood high up, the lake wind blowing.

This trip out of the lake would surely be extraordinary.

(P.S.: Madam Wen is truly making a comeback this time.)
