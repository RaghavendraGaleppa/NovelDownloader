# Chapter 26: First Steps with Spiritual Artifacts

Lin Xian had only recently achieved the fourth layer of cultivation, granting him the ability to wield spiritual artifacts. Yet long before this breakthrough—back when he first acquired the belongings of Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan—he had already begun researching these mystical tools. Aware that asking others might arouse suspicion, Lin Xian discreetly consulted numerous texts instead.

Though the second and third floors of the library were off-limits to low-level disciples, the first floor still contained many books detailing common knowledge about the immortal realm, even if most were considered useless trash by cultivators.

He learned that while higher-grade spiritual artifacts possessed greater power, they also demanded more skill and spiritual energy to control. With this in mind, Lin Xian decided to begin practicing with the mid-grade Soulgold Rope. Ideally, beginners should start with low-grade artifacts, but lacking any in his possession, he had no choice but to settle for this intermediate option.

Mastering artifact control first required learning the Object Manipulation Technique—a fundamental spell in cultivation. Lin Xian had studied it even before obtaining the Blue Star Sea, though his feeble spiritual energy at the time made progress painfully slow. Now, with his vastly improved cultivation, what was once difficult became effortless.

After thorough preparation, Lin Xian retrieved the Soulgold Rope from his storage bracelet. At first glance, it appeared as nothing more than an ordinary golden cord. As he channeled spiritual energy into it, the rope erupted with dazzling light, expanding to several zhang in length the moment it caught the wind. Though he'd witnessed Zhou Yan wield spiritual artifacts before, experiencing their power firsthand left him awestruck.

Yet energy infusion was merely the first step. Next came projecting his spiritual sense to attach to the artifact, enabling remote control—the core principle of Object Manipulation and the reason why fourth-layer cultivation was required. Without sufficient spiritual sense strength, developed only by reaching this stage, controlling artifacts was impossible.

With a deep breath, Lin Xian solemnly tossed the rope into the air while concentrating his spiritual sense upon it. The artifact, which should have fallen immediately, instead wobbled unsteadily upward—like a drunken man stumbling through the air, yet undeniably under his command.

A flicker of joy crossed Lin Xian's face, but his focus remained unshaken as he continued practicing.

Half an hour later, the rope reverted to its original form as Lin Xian collapsed onto his bed, utterly drained. The extravagant energy consumption explained spiritual artifacts' tremendous power—while fourth-layer cultivators could theoretically control them, true mastery required fifth or sixth-layer reserves.

Surprisingly, his first attempt succeeded where most failed even with simpler low-grade artifacts. This wasn't due to innate talent—Lin Xian remained an ordinary man without spiritual roots. His success stemmed from spiritual sense honed beyond his peers' through relentless effort.

While others performed three major energy cycles daily, Lin Xian pushed through nine, strengthening both his energy channels and spiritual sense. Moreover, purifying pills—especially mid-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills—demanded precise spiritual sense control over internal energy points, further tempering his mental faculties.

Though exhausted, Lin Xian's mind remained active. Analyzing his experience, he recognized both the arduous path ahead and the artifacts' irresistible allure. Yet he also identified his critical weakness: his fourth-layer cultivation, while respectable among new disciples, provided barely thirty minutes of artifact control before complete energy depletion—a fatal limitation in prolonged combat.

Despite his rapid progress enabled by the Blue Star Sea, Lin Xian remained clear-headed about his shortcomings. In the brutal world of cultivation, survival required constant self-assessment and improvement.

The obvious solution—advancing his cultivation—would take months to reach the fifth layer. With danger potentially lurking even within sect grounds, Lin Xian preferred preparing for contingencies. His conclusion was clear: it was time to learn supplementary spells.
