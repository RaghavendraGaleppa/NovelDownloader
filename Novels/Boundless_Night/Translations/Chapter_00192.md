# Chapter 192: Two Outcomes

In front of the two houses, the view was wide open. In the sapphire-blue lake, schools of colorful Dragon Carp swam gracefully.

"Please!" the white-robed youth said, his dark hair fluttering in the wind, his eyes deep. With his left hand clasped behind his back, he remained composed and confident.

The lush green grass where Wu Yaozu stood suddenly exploded with a *bang*. He surged forward, the power in his legs immense.

In an instant, the two crashed into each other. There was no finesse involved; they immediately sought a head-on collision.

Wu Yaozu was highly displeased. These people were too 'double-standard'; how had he become a lunatic? If that was the case, he'd show them what a lunatic looked like.

The white-robed youth, confident in his status, naturally met the challenge head-on when he saw his opponent's aggression. There was no reason for him to avoid anyone directly; it was always his opponents who evaded him.

With a *boom*, the area seemed to explode with thunderous roars. The grass beneath their feet was like a meteorite impact site, not only torn apart but also scorched black.

"How is this possible?!" The dozen or so young men and women were stunned.

Because the white-robed youth's wide sleeves were shredded, and he was continuously retreating, his expression extremely solemn. Had he truly met a formidable opponent?

Wu Yaozu was also retreating, but a confident smile adorned his face.

In the eyes of the group of youths, the two newcomers were mere nobodies, completely insignificant. How could they compare to the white-robed youth?

"This... is evenly matched!" The senior student leading the way was bewildered. He hadn't brought two greenhorns, but two fierce dragons crossing the river?

One must know, the one who fought was merely the younger brother; the elder brother had yet to enter the fray!

Qin Ming nodded inwardly, unconcerned.

"Come on!" The white-robed youth attacked again.

He used the 'Path of the Newcomer' as a supplementary path, primarily cultivating the 'Divine Path of the Esoteric Sect'. As he raised his hand, an extremely dazzling light emanated from his palm, and a bolt of lightning streaked across the void.

He was actually a born ability user, one who controlled lightning! No wonder he was so confident!

There was a saying that when the power of lightning accumulated to its extreme, it could 'punish' opponents from all paths, truly a domineering and unparalleled ability.

After an initial hard clash using his 'Path of the Newcomer' techniques, the white-robed youth unleashed his 'ultimate move' on his second strike. This showed his regard for Wu Yaozu and his desire for a quick victory.

His companions showed joy. Since he had unleashed such power, it was likely settled; this peculiar youth could be defeated quickly.

Wu Yaozu's pupils contracted, but he showed no panic. A special, brilliantly radiant rainbow light flew out from within him, transforming into an arch bridge that drew the lightning towards it!

However, the lightning didn't land on the bridge. Instead, just as it was about to make contact, it changed direction and plunged into the nearby lake.

With a *boom*, the lake surface exploded, and mist billowed. Some brightly colored Dragon Carp floated belly-up, thoroughly cooked.

"The Transformation of Yin and Yang?!" The white-robed youth was greatly astonished, his expression becoming solemn. The bridge formed by the rainbow light had initially mimicked his lightning.

Then, it advanced further, manifesting the changes of Yin and Yang.

Wu Yaozu said nothing. The rainbow light transformed into an arch bridge, drawing a large amount of water mist from the lake, which billowed around him, ready to meet the enemy.

Qin Ming praised inwardly. Little Wu's internal rainbow light was indeed extraordinary, having just manifested Yin-Yang lightning!

Born ability users were extremely rare. Whenever they appeared, they would be highly valued and diligently cultivated by all factions.

The white-robed youth was now glowing all over, intertwined with lightning. The turf beneath his feet gave off a burnt smell, already completely blackened.

In his hand appeared an irregularly shaped long spear condensed from electric light. He charged towards Little Wu, crackling and popping, carrying terrifying lightning radiance, thrusting it towards his opponent's chest.

In this area, a large amount of water mist surged, as if a river was flowing from the blue lake ahead. Wu Yaozu was using his divine rainbow to form a bridge, connecting with the waters, to engulf the lightning spear.

In an instant, a massive explosion occurred here.

Water mist boiled, and lightning flashed, one after another. Golden arch bridges spanned the sky, seemingly able to connect with all things and dismantle divine arts and spells.

Two figures moved rapidly within the lightning and divine rainbows, constantly colliding, their explosive roars deafening.

The lake in front of the houses was continuously struck, creating huge waves.

On either side of the houses, green bamboo dotted the landscape, and golden vine trees swayed with shimmering light, a truly beautiful scene. But now, some trees were constantly shattering.

This beautiful scenery was being ravaged as the two fought with true ferocity, intensely.

Nearby, the dozen or so young men and women were all stunned.

What was happening? These were just two nobodies, never heard of before, never seen before. How could they be so outrageous?!

The younger brother among them could actually contend with someone revered like a moon among stars!

The senior student leading the way was so shocked his scalp tingled. He felt that something big was going to happen today. If the white-robed youth were to lose here, tonight would be... unmanageable.

The dozen or so young men and women were all extremely nervous, immensely anxious. Nothing could go wrong here.

The two in the arena seemed to be constantly teleporting, like two phantoms darting through the night mist, moving at extreme speed. Both were enveloped in lightning and rainbow light, both dazzling and emitting an extremely dangerous aura.

Between them, thunderclouds erupted and divine rainbows bloomed intermittently. Many intense collisions occurred, and the intertwined light could easily tear apart others of the same realm.

Qin Ming nodded inwardly. This white-robed youth was indeed very strong!

*Dong!*

Parts of the white-robed youth's clothes were torn. A small bell appeared in his hand, gleaming silvery-white, reflecting electric light. He lifted it and struck towards his opponent.

Qin Ming's brow furrowed slightly, because it wasn't condensed from electric light; it was a physical object, a wondrous treasure, capable of amplifying the power of lightning.

However, Wu Yaozu didn't need him to worry.

At this moment, Little Wu advanced instead of retreating, showing no intention of dodging. He charged straight ahead, fearless, intending to shake that silver bell.

At the last moment, people discovered that he had taken out a brass pestle, more than half a foot long, from his robe and smashed it upwards with force.

*Rumble!*

Electric sparks flew in all directions, accompanied by the crisp sound of metal clashing.

All the lightning was dispersed by the brass pestle; it too was a wondrous treasure, exceedingly powerful.

With a soft *crack*, a fissure appeared on the silver bell held by the white-robed youth.

At the same time, he was struck by the rainbow light emanating from Wu Yaozu's body. He was sent flying, blood spilling from his mouth and nose, and he crashed onto the scorched grass by the lakeside.

"Brother, are you alright?" Little Wu asked, not pursuing.

The scene fell silent. The dozen or so young men and women were all dumbfounded, never expecting the white-robed youth, who in their eyes was like a bright moon in the sky, to be injured by a mere nobody.

Soon, the yellow-clad maiden ran over, shouting, "How are you?"

The others also snapped out of their daze and rushed over.

The white-robed youth swiftly flipped over and stood up, shaking his head. "I'm fine, the injury isn't that severe."

His expression was complex, a mixture of shock, helplessness, and a touch of bitterness. He was lauded as a heaven-defying prodigy, yet today he had inexplicably lost to an unknown youth.

This left his chest heavy; his path had been too smooth, and he had never tasted such defeat before.

"Who are you? With such skill, you can't be nobodies!" the yellow-clad maiden asked loudly.

Now, no one would consider these two nobodies.

"I am Wu Yaozu, also known as Little Zu by some," Little Wu said.

Then, he pointed at Qin Ming and said, "This is my elder brother, Shen Wubing. One day, we two brothers will make a name for ourselves throughout the Night Mist World."

Those present exchanged glances; they truly hadn't heard of these two.

But that night, they firmly etched these two into their memories.

"I've lost. This residence is yours now. Please wait a moment, I'll go pack!" The white-robed youth was quite straightforward, turning and walking into the room.

"We..." The others clenched their fists, extremely unwilling, but then released their grip.

Otherwise, what could they do? Their strongest member wasn't even a match.

The yellow-clad maiden, with a dark expression, went to her house to pack her belongings. She was fuming but helpless.

"This... something big has happened!" The senior student leading the way was completely dumbfounded. Tonight was supposed to be a highly anticipated, peak confrontation. Could it still proceed smoothly now?

"Can you fight tonight?" At this moment, the yellow-clad maiden was somewhat anxious.

"It's fine, my injury isn't severe. After taking the spiritual medicine, I can recover immediately." The white-robed youth took out a transparent crystal containing a golden liquid that emitted a soft glow.

A moment later, his entire body glowed, golden mists flowing around him. His complexion rapidly became rosy, and his body was filled with vigorous vitality. He had returned to his peak state.

Qin Ming had long known that Little Wu would win.

Because he clearly understood that Wu Yaozu had held back, not revealing his strongest form.

Most importantly, he felt that Little Wu's cultivation realm was rather peculiar, with some underlying issues.

The white-robed youth, the yellow-clad maiden, and their group departed.

"This whole situation..." Qin Ming and Little Wu exchanged glances, because ever since their clash, they had already guessed the white-robed youth's identity.

"How about we beat up the other one too? That would be fair," Little Wu suggested.

Nearby, the senior student who had led them stared at the two from a distance with a monster-seeing gaze. Finally, he steeled himself and walked over.

"Sirs, the grass, green bamboo, and golden vine trees have been severely damaged. According to the academy's regulations, as one of the involved parties, you must not only compensate half the 'Day Gold' but also pay a fine."

Instantly, their eyes widened. Hearing the astonishing amount of 'Day Gold,' they felt as if they were already bankrupt before even paying their tuition fees.

***

That evening, the highly anticipated battle of the heaven-defying prodigies commenced as scheduled.

Kunling had over a dozen top-tier Daoist grounds and academies. Large groups of disciples surged towards the Mountain River Academy, and the battle arena was already packed to capacity.

Many streaks of conscious spiritual light intertwined in the night sky, watching the battle from above.

Kunling City was abuzz with discussions everywhere, many people awaiting the outcome of this battle.

Even the Nightly News had sent reporters to follow up on the coverage.

At the Mountain River Academy's duel grounds, every seat was taken, and even some elders appeared in the VIP section.

A large number of people without tickets listened for the results outside.

From time to time, thunderous cheers, like a mountain collapsing or a tsunami roaring, erupted from the venue. Clearly, the duel was exceedingly spectacular.

"Heaven-defying talents, both are very strong, indeed the cream of the crop this generation!"

"Both cultivate dual paths, there's a lot to watch..."

Someone was commenting.

*Boom!*

A tremendous roar, as if it would pierce the clouds, signaled the end of the great battle.

"There's a result! Xin Youdao narrowly lost!"

"Alas, what a pity. Our Mountain River Academy's strongest freshman of this generation ultimately couldn't defeat Ling Yu, who challenges a hundred cities with his sword."

Soon, dissenting voices seemed to erupt from the scene.

"Extra! Heaven-defying prodigy Xin Youdao was actually injured before he even entered the arena!"

However, such voices were quickly suppressed, causing no major commotion, as the relevant parties swiftly 'debunked' them.

People from various Daoist grounds and academies were all heatedly discussing, especially the freshmen of this generation, who felt incredibly excited and dazzled by the sight. Many were extremely emotional.

"Truly worthy of being a peak confrontation between heaven-defying prodigies! This ticket was worth it!"

"Ling Yu is incredibly formidable, maintaining an overwhelmingly dominant posture from start to finish. Truly worthy of being the Young Ancestor who will test his sword across the world!"

At this moment, Ling Yu looked at the yellow-clad maiden beside Xin Youdao and asked, "Are you saying Brother Xin was injured and severely wounded by someone beforehand, and you suspect I arranged it?"

"That's right, otherwise, how could it be such a coincidence!" The yellow-clad maiden retorted indignantly.

Xin Youdao waved his hand, saying, "Defeat is defeat. There are no other excuses!"

"Take me to see those two!" Ling Yu said.

"Alright, let's go!" The yellow-clad maiden ignored Xin Youdao's attempt to stop her, turned around, and led the way.
