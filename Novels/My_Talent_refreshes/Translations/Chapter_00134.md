# Chapter 134: Refining the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme, Greatly Increasing Cultivation

Given the sect's usual treatment of Qi Condensation disciples, Chu Ning's first thought was naturally to flee.

But this idea had barely surfaced before he suppressed it.

There was definitely no opportunity at this stage. Since Xin Wuyai wouldn't even let him visit Yanji Market, leaving the sect would surely not be easy.

However, if his guess was correct, then at least he would be safe before reaching Foundation Establishment.

And he was currently only at "Qi Condensation Layer Six," and could freely control his displayed cultivation realm, so he had plenty of time ahead.

Therefore, the various benefits Xin Wuyai was providing didn't seem like such a bad thing for him.

At least at this stage, he could use these resources—such as spirit stones and pills—to rapidly improve himself.

With the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme, rapidly breaking through to Qi Condensation Layer Seven after refining it should be justifiable.

Then, he wouldn't have to worry about Spirit Essence Pills.

He could also spend more time studying talisman crafting, preparing for his future escape.

And most importantly, cultivation techniques!

This was what Chu Ning most urgently needed right now, as he only possessed a cultivation technique for Qi Condensation Layer Nine.

What he needed to do now was to refine the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme and see if he could swiftly break through to Qi Condensation Layer Nine.

Then, using resources, he would quickly cultivate the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique to perfection, and see what kind of spirit physique would be refreshed.

At that point, he would choose his next cultivation technique and prepare to flee.

With this thought, Chu Ning immediately felt his thoughts gradually clear up.

His heart was no longer hanging as precariously as before, but had settled down quite a bit.

At this moment, Chu Ning slapped his spirit beast pouch, releasing Little White.

"Ying!"

Little White let out a surprised cry, still a little unsure of where it was.

Chu Ning immediately began transmitting his voice with divine sense.

"Little one, this is my cave mansion. We'll be staying here for a while, and there's a special spirit beast room for you here."

Chu Ning took Little White on a tour of the cave mansion, and the little creature immediately delighted in exploring the spirit beast room.

At this point, Chu Ning seriously transmitted his voice to Little White:

"Little White, in a while, we might have to leave here.

These days, I'll take you around. You can check out the sect-protecting grand formation and see where it's convenient to enter and exit."

Using Little White to leave the sect was the best method Chu Ning could think of.

Since he couldn't leave openly, he would have to sneak out.

Before that, he naturally had to choose the location well, waiting for the opportune moment to act.

At this point, Chu Ning finally felt truly at ease. He immediately went to the cultivation room and sat cross-legged, preparing to cultivate the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique.

Before that, Chu Ning didn't forget to check his cultivation progress.

[Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique (Yellow-grade, low-tier), Third Layer (1081/2100)]

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Bone-Strengthening (698/1500)]

[Spirit Refinement Art, Second Layer (17/2000)]

With his divine sense, Chu Ning quickly sensed the incomparably pure wisp of heavenly spiritual energy within his dantian.

"Marrow Cleansing Spiritual Root? Improving talent?"

The Aura of Spiritual Rhyme was said to be so miraculous by everyone; he now wanted to truly experience its wonders.

When he attempted to approach the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme with his cultivation power, a tiny wisp of the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme was immediately drawn out.

The next moment, the spiritual energy between heaven and earth seemed to sense it, surging wildly towards Chu Ning's body.

"The Aura of Spiritual Rhyme can actually draw in heavenly spiritual energy?"

Chu Ning quickly felt the difference, instantly feeling extremely surprised, and then swiftly calmed his mind.

The Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique circulated, and heavenly spiritual energy gathered.

Even with Chu Ning's Yin Wood Spirit Physique's astonishing absorption speed, it couldn't keep up with the speed at which the spiritual energy was gathering.

Wisp after wisp of spiritual energy not only entered Chu Ning's dantian but also cleansed his entire body.

The spiritual energy that couldn't enter Chu Ning's body gathered around him.

Soon, it enveloped Chu Ning in a white mist of spiritual energy.

Even the spiritual energy density in the entire cultivation room was continuously rising.

Little White, in the nearby spirit beast room, seemed to sense the anomaly and immediately ran into the cultivation room.

Its two small eyes swiveled continuously, a human-like look of surprise flashing through them.

Then, the little creature simply lay down in the cultivation room and actually fell asleep.

As it breathed in and out, wisps of spiritual energy from the cultivation room entered its body through its nostrils.

Two days later, Chu Ning finally emerged from his cultivation state.

"I cultivated for two continuous days, but looking at this Aura of Spiritual Rhyme, only a tiny bit has been refined.

If I want to completely refine it, it might take another twenty days."

He glanced at the changes in the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme within his dantian, and also sensed the state of the cultivation power within it.

"It seems... my cultivation power has increased quite a lot."

Chu Ning's eyes flickered, and the next moment, he quickly checked his cultivation proficiency in his mind.

He then slightly gaped.

[Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique (Yellow-grade, low-tier), Third Layer (1141/2100)]

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Bone-Strengthening (708/1500)]

[Spirit Refinement Art, Second Layer (21/2000)]

In two days, Chu Ning's Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique's Third Layer had actually increased by a full 60 proficiency points.

The Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art's Bone-Strengthening also increased by 10 proficiency points.

Even the Spirit Refinement Art gained a full 4 proficiency points.

And he had merely been cultivating the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique.

"It seems the claim that the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme can cleanse marrow and change bones isn't just talk, and it can even increase divine sense; it's truly extraordinarily miraculous."

As Chu Ning thought this, his eyes grew hotter.

"At 30 proficiency points per day, I'll reach Qi Condensation Layer Nine in just 6 more days!

And if I can truly refine it for 20 days..."

Chu Ning quickly calculated and realized that he wasn't too far from reaching the perfection of Qi Condensation.

With this thought, Chu Ning immediately made a decision.

First, he would go into seclusion for twenty days to completely refine the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme and reach Qi Condensation Layer Nine.

At the same time, he would outwardly display Qi Condensation Layer Seven, which would give him sufficient reason to go to Qianji Pavilion to claim Spirit Essence Pills.

With Spirit Essence Pills, his Yin Wood Spirit Physique, and spirit stones, he could quickly reach full proficiency in the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique's Third Layer.

By then, he could consider his next cultivation direction.

He could also look for a cultivation technique.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning stood up and went outside his cave mansion, opening the restriction for secluded cultivation.

Under normal circumstances, this would prevent anyone from disturbing him.

He then exercised a bit in the courtyard, cooked and ate some spirit rice.

Chu Ning immediately resumed his cultivation.

For the next period, Chu Ning devoted himself entirely to cultivation.

In a flash, twenty-five days passed.

[Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique (Yellow-grade, low-tier), Third Layer (1741/2100)]

[Nine Evolution Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Bone-Strengthening (818/1500)]

[Spirit Refinement Art, Second Layer (71/2000)]

During these twenty-five days, Chu Ning cultivated for two days, then slept for one night.

His actual cultivation time for the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique was about twenty days, and the proficiency for the Third Layer increased by a full 600 points.

In addition to cultivating the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique, Chu Ning occasionally adjusted by cultivating Bone-Strengthening and Spirit Refinement Art.

Bone-Strengthening increased by 110 points, and Spirit Refinement Art by 50 points.

On the 6th day, just as Chu Ning expected, when his Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique's Third Layer proficiency reached 1300, he successfully entered Qi Condensation Layer Nine.

After more than ten days of cultivation, he had completed over half of the cultivation proficiency for Qi Condensation Layer Nine.

Now, he only needed to cultivate another 359 proficiency points to complete the Third Layer of the Verdant Wood Everlasting Spring Technique.

"I've been in seclusion for a month. I'll go out for a walk first, then come back and see the cultivation effect of the Spirit Essence Pills."

Chu Ning muttered to himself, then walked out.

Based on his previous experience with Spirit Essence Pills, one pill could increase proficiency by 3 points at Qi Condensation Layer Seven, and 2 points at Qi Condensation Layer Eight.

If it only increased by 1 point at Qi Condensation Layer Nine, then he would either have to consume more or cultivate with spirit stones simultaneously.

He certainly couldn't stay in the sect for a year before leaving.

Just as he exited his cave mansion, Chu Ning saw several transmission talismans outside.

He immediately picked them up and listened.

One was from Xin Wuyai, asking Chu Ning to see him after his seclusion ended to check on Chu Ning's cultivation progress.

Two were from He Changyou and Liao Yunming respectively, both saying to inform them once he emerged from seclusion.

And another one surprised Chu Ning a little; it was from a Foundation Establishment deacon named Zhong from the Pill Refinement Hall.

The transmission was sent today, telling Chu Ning to visit the Pill Refinement Hall after emerging from seclusion, stating that Gu Xiaoging had entrusted her to deliver some items on her behalf.

After listening to the contents of all these transmission talismans, Chu Ning first replied to the two deacons, informing them of his emergence from seclusion.

Then, he went to find Xin Wuyai first.

The other party was both the Sect Master and his nominal master.

Moreover, at this stage, Chu Ning needed to appear very cooperative, preparing for his future plans.

Flying all the way to Xin Wuyai's cave mansion, Chu Ning was about to send a transmission talisman when Xin Wuyai's voice echoed in his ears.

"Come in!"

Hearing this, Chu Ning immediately entered the cave mansion.

"Disciple Chu Ning greets the Sect Master."

Chu Ning bowed slightly.

Xin Wuyai had not officially accepted him as a disciple, so Chu Ning naturally wouldn't address him as master.

Xin Wuyai was still seated in the same place where they had conversed last time.

This Sect Master seemed to particularly enjoy conversing with others from the main seat in the hall, perhaps a habit formed from long years in the Sect Master's position.

However, this time there was another person, whom Xin Wuyai introduced as He Litao.

Because the other party was at the Foundation Establishment stage, even if he was Xin Wuyai's disciple, Chu Ning still addressed him as Martial Uncle.

Xin Wuyai's gaze swept over Chu Ning, and he nodded slightly, a satisfied smile on his face.

"Qi Condensation Layer Seven already, not bad. Have you refined all the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme?"

Chu Ning answered truthfully: "It has all been refined."

Xin Wuyai nodded again.

"You just broke through to Qi Condensation Layer Six before entering the Spirit Domain. Now reaching the mid-stage of Qi Condensation Layer Seven after refining the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme is quite good.

Go to Qianji Pavilion and claim some cultivation resources, then continue cultivating."

"Yes, Sect Master. This disciple takes his leave."

Seeing that Xin Wuyai had no intention of keeping him, Chu Ning naturally had no desire to stay either, and immediately left Xin Wuyai's cave mansion.

After Chu Ning's figure disappeared, Xin Wuyai, who had been sitting in his chair, turned to He Litao, who was standing in the hall, and asked:

"Has this disciple been in his cave mansion for the past month?"

He Litao nodded, "He has, never left the cave mansion."

"What about the others?" Xin Wuyai asked again.

"They are all cultivating diligently within the sect. In another month, one person should be able to establish their Foundation."

Hearing this, a hint of a smile appeared on Xin Wuyai's face.

"Within the sect, don't worry about them, but don't let them leave the sect.

Especially this Chu Ning. The spirit seed fled, and even if it's found, acquiring it will require him, the last person to obtain the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme, to guide it.

Watch him closely!"

"Yes!"

With this reply, He Litao departed, and the hall returned to silence.

Xin Wuyai, however, remained seated in his chair, motionless, lost in thought.

Chu Ning, who had just left Xin Wuyai's cave mansion, thought for a moment and did not head straight back to his own cave mansion, but instead walked towards Qianji Pavilion.

Since the Sect Master had given his word, he naturally wouldn't waste such an opportunity.

Qianji Pavilion was similar to the Outer Sect's Hundred Treasures Pavilion, serving as a place to provide various cultivation resources for the inner sect cultivators.

Its location was quite central within the inner sect, making it easy to find.

Upon entering Qianji Pavilion, the person on duty was actually a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

The cultivator introduced himself as Ji Mengliang. His appearance was ordinary, but his face was very kind, with a smile.

At first glance, Chu Ning easily associated him with Martial Brother Zhuang Yunde.

When Chu Ning presented his jade token for identification, the cultivator immediately said:

"Oh, so it's Martial Nephew Chu.

The sect has given an order that Martial Nephew may claim any cultivation resources you desire. What would Martial Nephew like?"

"Martial Uncle Ji, this disciple wishes to claim some cultivation pills, such as Spirit Essence Pills..."

Chu Ning had just started when Ji Mengliang quickly smiled and asked:

"Martial Nephew Chu cultivates a wood-attribute technique, doesn't he? While Spirit Essence Pills are useful for cultivating disciples at the late Qi Condensation stage, when it comes to effectiveness, they are not as good as Wood Essence Pills, which are specifically for wood-attribute techniques."

"Wood Essence Pills?"

Chu Ning was slightly stunned upon hearing this. He knew very little about pills.

Previously, in Yanji Market, he had always consumed Spirit Essence Pills.

He hadn't known that there were Wood Essence Pills specifically for wood-attribute techniques.

"In terms of effect, one Wood Essence Pill for a wood-attribute cultivator is equivalent to two Spirit Essence Pills."

Hearing Ji Mengliang's words, Chu Ning naturally no longer hesitated and chose the Wood Essence Pills.

He even requested a full 60 pills at once.

Ji Mengliang, hearing the quantity Chu Ning requested, did not say or ask anything further, simply took out two bottles of pills and handed them to Chu Ning.

Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he asked Ji Mengliang:

"Martial Uncle Ji, do you have any suitable magic artifacts you could recommend for me?"

"Hehe," Ji Mengliang chuckled.

"Martial Nephew Chu, the sect's instructions were to provide you with sufficient resources for cultivation improvement.

This does not include various magic artifacts."

Chu Ning was slightly startled by these words, then quickly regained his composure and continued:

"What about talisman crafting manuals? Or spells?"

"Those are fine," Ji Mengliang said with a smile.

"Cultivating talisman crafting or spells in your leisure time is also a way to assist in cultivation improvement.

However, neither of these things are in Qianji Pavilion; they are in the Library Pavilion. Martial Nephew might want to check there."

Chu Ning nodded, then bid farewell to Ji Mengliang and left Qianji Pavilion.

After walking a distance, Chu Ning shook his head inwardly.

What Xin Wuyai said about unobstructed access and freely claiming resources sounded good, but in the end, he could only get some pills.

He had originally hoped to seize this opportunity to get top-grade magic artifacts, but that wish was now dashed.

Chu Ning did not head to the Library Pavilion at this time. Although he also wanted to acquire talisman crafting techniques and more advanced spells, for him at this stage, cultivating his technique and raising his realm was the most important.

And superficially, this also better conformed to Xin Wuyai's requirements.

He would check them out later when the opportunity arose.

Leaving the Inner Sect, Chu Ning headed towards the Outer Sect's Pill Refinement Hall.

The elder in the Pill Refinement Hall had sent a message saying that Gu Xiaoging had brought something for him.

Chu Ning pondered for a moment, thinking it was most likely Golden Orchid Fruits.

Now that he had refined the Aura of Spiritual Rhyme, he was just about to start using Golden Orchid Fruits for body tempering.

Although he still had some in his storage bag, if he were to use them long-term, he would naturally need a continuous supply.

This was Chu Ning's first time visiting the Outer Sect's Pill Refinement Hall. Entering the inner section, he saw a Qi Condensation Layer Seven disciple on duty in the hall. Chu Ning quickly walked up to him.

"Martial Brother, may I ask where Deacon Zhong is located?"

The disciple was busy fiddling with a few bottles of pills in his hand. Hearing this, he somewhat impatiently looked up and glanced at Chu Ning.

However, he quickly withdrew his gaze, then swiftly stood up and said:

"Ah, it's an Inner Sect Martial Brother. Deacon Zhong is inside the hall.

Martial Brother, please go further inside, you'll find her in Pill Refining Room B-5."

Chu Ning paid no mind to the disciple's completely changed reaction.

After thanking him, he followed the man's directions and found Pill Refining Room B-5.

Fearing that the other party might be refining pills, Chu Ning saw a transmission device on the door and sent in his purpose for coming.

In just a few breaths, the door to the refining room opened.

To Chu Ning's slight surprise, a familiar face appeared: Gu Xiaoging.

"Martial Sister Gu, you've returned to the sect?"

Chu Ning was slightly taken aback, but then he thought that made sense; she must have returned to the sect and brought the items with her.

And she had probably just returned and hadn't left yet, so his visit was perfectly timed.

"Martial Brother Chu, please come in."

Gu Xiaoging, still with her gentle nature, smiled at Chu Ning and ushered him into the pill refining room.

Inside the room, there was also a middle-aged woman dressed in a light green long gown, with elegant features and a graceful charm.

Gu Xiaoging immediately introduced the two of them.

"Master, this is Martial Brother Chu Ning. When I was in the market, he looked after me a great deal."

"Martial Brother Chu, this is my master, Zhong Ying."

Hearing Gu Xiaoging's words, Chu Ning immediately cupped his hands and bowed.

"Disciple Chu Ning greets Martial Aunt Zhong."

Zhong Ying, however, waved her hand directly.

"Martial Nephew Chu, there's no need for such courtesy. I heard from Xiaoging that you saved her when the Yin Devil Sect attacked outside last time."

This woman spoke in a very straightforward manner, a complete contrast to Gu Xiaoging's personality, which made Chu Ning slightly surprised.

Gu Xiaoging smiled faintly at Chu Ning, evidently having noticed his surprise.

However, very soon, she exclaimed directly:

"Martial Brother Chu, you've already reached Qi Condensation Layer Seven?"
