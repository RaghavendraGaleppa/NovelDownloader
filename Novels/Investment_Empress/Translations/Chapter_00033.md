## Chapter 33: Qingyuan Sect's Future May Well See the Sun and Moon Shine as One—Li Mo's Score Surpasses Ying Bing?

At the entrance to the trial grounds, a white-headed magpie perched on Yin Huaxuan's shoulder, chirping softly.

Yin Huaxuan pondered for a moment before speaking. "That Wang Hu truly practices the Hundred Beast Blood Refinement. He fully unleashed his beast lineage just now, opening all twelve meridians in an instant, and even transformed into a tiger-leopard. He was roughly equivalent to a peak ninth-grade exotic beast."

"Then isn't my disciple in great danger?" The Elder of Ruyi Peak shot to his feet. He had already wanted to intervene when he learned of Lin Jiang's encounter with Wang Hu, but several other elders had dissuaded him, fearing that his rash action would alert the larger fish behind Wang Hu.

"Elder Lu, don't worry, I haven't finished," Yin Huaxuan said, a strange expression on his face. "True Disciple Li just happened to pass by."

"Wang Hu has already been subdued by him, and is now being escorted back by nearby inner sect deacons."

Li Mo again? The elders exchanged glances.

Defeating a late ninth-grade exotic beast, and then subduing Wang Hu, who was equivalent to a peak ninth-grade exotic beast—the latter even possessing human intelligence, making him far more troublesome than a mere beast.

To be honest, even though Li Mo and Ying Bing had both reached the top of the Sky-Ascending Steps, the elders still believed Ying Bing's talent to be superior in many aspects. After all, as the Sect Master's True Disciple, Ying Bing's terrifying progress had already numbed them with shock. They hadn't expected Li Mo to truly show signs of being her equal.

Not long after, an inner sect deacon threw the unconscious Wang Hu onto the platform.

"Did Li Mo not return with them?" Xue Jing was the first to ask. He worried Li Mo might be injured and still stubbornly continuing the trial. Some injuries, if dragged on, could leave permanent ailments.

"Reporting to Elder Xue, according to True Disciple Lin, True Disciple Li was not injured." The deacon paused. "That should be true, because he subdued Wang Hu in only one move."

One move? Only then did Xue Jing truly focus on Wang Hu, lying on the ground like a dead dog. He quickly noticed that Wang Hu's entire arm was twisted and broken. This didn't look like a hard-fought, evenly matched battle at all. Instead, it looked more like...

...being casually crushed by a much stronger fierce beast.

Putting everything else aside, this fierce combat power alone was enough to put him on par with Ying Bing.

"Could it be that this小子 (kid)'s bone structure hides the bloodline of some powerful fierce beast?" Qian Bufan couldn't help but suspect that he had been mistaken when he assessed Li Mo on the Sky-Ascending Steps.

"If one person misjudges, it's unlikely we all misjudged." Han He shook his head. "He must have achieved Great Accomplishment in Body Refinement."

Entering the sect for half a month, and achieving Great Accomplishment in Body Refinement. It seemed his earlier guess was correct...

"Old man, you're muddled!" Shang Wu's almond eyes curved into crescents as she laughed.

Han He recalled their bet, and his old face instantly turned as black as the bottom of a pot. He had to admit it. Although Murong Xiao was also excellent, the gap between him and Li Mo was simply not something that could be weighed on the same scale. A match? It was unknown if Murong Xiao could even withstand one punch from the current Li Mo, even with great effort. Moreover, Li Mo would also continue to improve, and at an even faster rate.

"With these two, the Qingyuan Sect is destined to prosper!" Yin Huaxuan's eyes sparkled with intense brilliance.

The elders nodded in agreement. The first generation of founding ancestors of the Qingyuan Sect had all come from the Central Plains. At that time, though Qingyuan Sect's territory was only the single Ziyang Prefecture, it actually stood at the forefront of the entire Eastern Barrens Domain. They never imagined that in their time, two prodigies comparable to the sect's founders would emerge.

And not just one, but two! When they grew up, the Qingyuan Sect's future might well see the sun and moon shine as one!

Xue Jing chuckled, "Li Mo rescued a fellow disciple and subdued Wang Hu. Let's credit him with the score for killing a peak ninth-grade demonic beast. Does anyone object?"

No one objected. Even giving Li Mo a slightly higher score was reasonable.

Thus, the scoreboard now showed:

Ying Bing: 119 points.
Li Mo: 116 points.

Just a short while ago, Ying Bing had also killed a peak ninth-grade exotic beast. So, there was still a slim three-point difference between the two.

"Future matters can be discussed later," Xue Jing said, pulling everyone's attention back. "For now, someone is still eyeing us."

"The person behind Wang Hu never made a move in the end."

"The demonic cultivators of the Demon Summoning Sect are indeed vigilant."

"Perhaps this Wang Hu was just a casual move, an idle pawn for them?"

"Hmph, if you ask me, we should dig three feet deep. I don't believe we won't find traces of the demonic cultivators!"

"Inappropriate. That would mobilize a large force and beat the grass to scare the snake, and we might not gain much."

The elders discussed for a while, unable to agree. Finally, they decided to temporarily detain Wang Hu at Ruyi Peak for interrogation. They would await the Sect Master's emergence from seclusion to make a final decision. Since the other party hadn't even cared about Wang Hu's death, it was unlikely that this trial would see any further trouble. They prioritized the safe conclusion of the sect trial.

Just then, another deacon returned, dragging two exotic beasts. One Scorched Ring Wolf King. One Lion Bear. Both were late ninth-grade exotic beasts. He hadn't even approached, but the elders already recognized them as the handiwork of True Disciple Li.

With this added achievement, Li Mo's score climbed to 146, instantly surpassing Ying Bing and claiming the first position.

"My precious disciple is in first place?" Shang Wu snorted lightly, took the deacon's brush, swiftly updated Li Mo's score, and hung it at the very top. She crossed her arms and raised her chin. "Who dares to say this old woman doesn't know how to teach disciples now?"

The elders collectively thought, "We were muddled indeed."

***

Meanwhile, at the end of the Rocky Stream Forest.

"Senior Brother, save me!" an outer sect disciple cried out, pinned to the ground by a ferocious Lion Bear, utterly unable to resist. He could only look with pleading eyes at a figure standing on a stone pillar.

That person, though not a deacon, wore the robes of a True Disciple. The outer sect disciple never imagined that his fellow sect member, whom he had called with a signal flare, would simply watch the show with cold indifference, showing no intention of intervening.

In fact... his eyes held only mockery and apathy.

This was Yin Huacheng, who had proactively volunteered to be responsible for the Moon-Gazing Cliff area. Yin Huacheng was in an extremely foul mood. Futu had not delivered on his promise; those disciples who had left the sect hadn't returned home directly, but instead were eating and drinking at a brothel in Ziyang Prefecture. Just now, he also learned that Wang Hu was dead. This meant that he wouldn't get any cultivation materials for a while.

And the cause of both issues was the same person.

"Li Mo!" Veins throbbed on Yin Huacheng's forehead, and his eyes flickered back and forth between slit pupils and human eyes.

At this moment, a crow landed on his shoulder, letting out a few low, hoarse caws.

"Telling me not to stir up trouble?" Yin Huacheng's aura grew increasingly terrifying.

By now, the outer sect disciple had finally gone still. The Lion Bear, feasting greedily, heard the movement and quickly turned around. However, upon meeting Yin Huacheng's gaze, its originally ferocious eyes instantly filled with terror, and it crouched low.

*Pfft*—

The Lion Bear's crimson heart was torn out. Yin Huacheng devoured it in large bites.

"I had planned to raise you for a bit longer..." he muttered. "You ruined my materials, so you'll have to pay with yourself."

He changed into a black robe, and his figure vanished from the spot.
