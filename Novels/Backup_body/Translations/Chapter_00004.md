# Chapter 4: The Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique!

Night fell, the second watch of the hour.

Eight disciples from the Enforcement Hall patrolled the mountain stone steps under the moonlight.

Li Zhengjing gazed ahead with a strange expression, thinking to himself, "The guidance on the golden page told me to hang the strong liquor in this pavilion during the second watch, and coincidentally, I avoided all the patrolling Enforcement Hall disciples along the way!"

He vaguely understood that the instructions on the golden page, though brief, had already accounted for all potential accidents and dangers.

Originally, he had planned to hide and observe who might be drawn to the liquor. But now, he abandoned the idea entirely, strictly adhering to the guidance provided by the golden page.

He returned to his courtyard, took a bath, made a late-night snack, ate it, tossed the bones to the dog in the corner, and then went to bed, pondering his current situation.

According to the golden page's guidance, on the third night, he would obtain the Five Elements Creation Tree, which would completely heal the damage to his internal organs caused by practicing the flawed and incorrect version of the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique.

If this could indeed be accomplished smoothly, his most pressing concern now would be obtaining a complete and correct version of the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique.

"Both the healing of my internal injuries and obtaining the complete Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique are set to happen within three days," Li Zhengjing mused. "Does this mean that after healing my injuries and obtaining the complete technique, I can cultivate a strand of internal Qi within three days and pass the inner sect assessment?"

Cultivating internal Qi in just three days—if this were to spread, it would surely shake the entire Immortal Sect!

It was worth noting that among the current outer sect disciples of the Ancient Moon Peak, aside from the five who passed the preliminary inner sect assessment today, there were still eighteen disciples who had reached the pinnacle of external cultivation.

The earliest among them to pass the preliminary assessment had done so a year and three months ago, yet to this day, they still hadn't grasped the mysteries of the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique.

Over the past decade, the most outstanding outer sect disciple of Ancient Moon Peak was Lu Huaiyuan, now the chief true disciple of the sect.

It was said that after reaching the pinnacle of external cultivation, he cultivated "internal Qi" within ten days of receiving the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique!

"Previously, it took me nine days to fully comprehend the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique," Li Zhengjing thought. "If not for the flawed version I received, I should have cultivated a strand of internal Qi within ten days."

The night passed, and as dawn approached, the sun rose.

Li Zhengjing opened his eyes, got up, washed up, and went to the courtyard to practice his fist techniques and stretch his muscles.

He no longer cared about today's morning lessons. After all, the remaining medicinal bath materials for this month had already been withheld by Chen Youyu. They couldn't possibly penalize him by withholding next month's materials too, could they?

"If I report the flawed Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique to the Enforcement Hall, what would happen?" he wondered. "Would they punish Chen Youyu and the others and grant me a complete version?"

As he pondered, his heart stirred, and he looked again at the "Fortune" section on the golden page.

Sure enough, the content had changed once more.

**Fortune:**  
After reporting the flawed Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique and exposing his internal injuries, the high-ranking elders of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect deliberated and decided that his injuries were too severe to warrant further cultivation. Three days later, he was assigned to serve as a constable in the government office of Hundred Spirits City.

On the way, he was captured by the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, his soul extracted, and his body refined into a Blood Pill. He died without a complete corpse.

"..."

When Li Zhengjing read the first line, he thought he might survive by sheer luck. But the next line dashed his hopes—he still wouldn't escape death. He couldn't help but feel frustrated.

He exhaled and thought, "Finding the complete Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique will have to rely on myself."

With this in mind, he pushed open his courtyard gate and went to find the fake medicine peddler.

As expected, the peddler was still at the mountain gate, making his shady deals.

Li Zhengjing didn't interrupt his business. He waited until the outer sect disciple left happily before stepping forward.

"Senior Brother, what brings you here?" the peddler asked, untying a cloth bag from his waist and handing it over with a smile. "Here are today's medicine cauldrons—ten in total. I planned to deliver them to your courtyard tonight, but you couldn't wait."

Li Zhengjing took the bag, handed over a silver note, and then asked, "Do you have any liquor?"

"Liquor?" The peddler was taken aback.

"The strongest liquor possible," Li Zhengjing said. "Preferably brewed with highly toxic ingredients."

"I do have some connections, but such liquor, especially brewed with toxic ingredients, won't come cheap..." The peddler hesitated, then looked at Li Zhengjing and whispered, "A hundred taels per jar."

"Ten taels," Li Zhengjing said expressionlessly.

"Deal." The peddler agreed instantly.

"Deliver it to my courtyard before nightfall," Li Zhengjing said calmly.

"Got it. I'll have it delivered by evening," the peddler replied with a wave and left.

"I was too hasty..." Li Zhengjing felt a pang of regret. "Ten taels was too high."

In a sour mood, he carried the ten medicine cauldrons back to his courtyard and began placing low-grade spirit stones into his mouth one by one.

The "Fortune" section on the golden page changed once more.

**Second:**  
The current Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique is flawed. A complete version must be obtained within three days!

**Based on current cultivation level, environment, and circumstances, the method to alter fate is as follows:**  
Using the blank token obtained from the preliminary inner sect assessment, proceed to the second floor of the Scripture Repository.  
At the sixth bookshelf, twelfth row, count thirty-six books from the left.  
Using the Mystic Word Selection Technique of the Wuding Mountain, decipher the hidden method within to obtain the lost secret technique of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect:  
**The Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique!**  

**Mystic Word Selection Technique of Wuding Mountain as follows:**  
"..."

Li Zhengjing was already familiar with the process. He swallowed the spirit stones, revealing the Mystic Word Selection Technique of Wuding Mountain.

He pondered silently, "The Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique is one of the twelve Qi-Nurturing Internal Techniques of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Lost for sixteen years, it's actually hidden in the second-floor outer sect Scripture Repository?"

During his outer sect morning lectures, he had heard about the Qi-Nurturing Internal Techniques.

Among the twelve techniques of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique was renowned as the most domineering!

Seventeen years ago, the northern skies collapsed, and Mount Fengdu crumbled, releasing millions of demons and evil spirits that wreaked havoc upon the world.

The three great immortal sects mobilized all their forces, taking a hundred days to quell the chaos.

After the great battle, all three sects suffered heavy losses. Among them, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's elders and disciples who practiced the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique were nearly wiped out!

That same year, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect experienced internal division. The Scripture Repository caught fire, burning 1,800 texts to ashes. The original Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, personally authored by the sect's founder, along with 372 copied texts, were all destroyed.

Only two elders and seven disciples who had practiced the technique remained. Ordered to return to the sect to reconstruct the technique, they were ambushed and killed by the Wuding Mountain sect en route!

Afterward, the six peak masters of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect mobilized, annihilating the Wuding Mountain sect and erasing it from existence!

"This..." Li Zhengjing thought, "It seems the Wuding Mountain sect deliberately sought to eradicate the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's legacy of the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique?"

"And now, the technique is hidden in the outer sect Scripture Repository, decipherable only by the Wuding Mountain's Mystic Word Selection Technique."

"Did the Wuding Mountain sect try to steal the technique and sever the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's lineage, leading to their destruction?"

He rubbed his temples. These events were far removed from him. What mattered now was obtaining the complete Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique!

After gathering his thoughts, Li Zhengjing wasted no time and headed straight for the outer sect Scripture Repository.

On duty today were Steward Lin and Steward Fan.

Li Zhengjing presented the blank token from the preliminary inner sect assessment and said, "Honored Stewards, this disciple has been practicing the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique but has yet to cultivate internal Qi. Feeling inadequate in comprehension, I’ve come to study the insights of past practitioners."

The two stewards exchanged glances, then nodded. They verified his identity and recorded his visit.

"You’ve already been granted the Qi-Nurturing Internal Technique and may not proceed to the third-floor technique repository. You are permitted to browse the cultivation insights of inner sect disciples on the second floor," Steward Lin said indifferently. "Moreover, having passed the preliminary assessment, you are considered half an inner sect disciple. By outer sect rules, you may not remove texts from the repository or make copies. You may only read here."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Understood."

He took the token and ascended to the second floor, where over a dozen outer sect disciples—all at the pinnacle of external cultivation and holding assessment credentials—were studying.

Many familiar faces were buried in books, scratching their heads in frustration.

"Are you Junior Brother Li Zhengjing?"

A voice called out from behind.

Li Zhengjing turned to see a youth of about fifteen or sixteen, smiling at him.

"I’m Pei Ying. I entered the sect at twelve and am now sixteen," the youth said. "My physique only matured this year, and I reached the pinnacle of external cultivation half a year ago. Since then, I’ve been studying here daily. You’ve only been here six months, so you likely don’t know me..."

Though a year older, Li Zhengjing bowed slightly. "Greetings, Senior Brother."

Pei Ying said, "I heard you reached the pinnacle of external cultivation in just six months. In the past decade, no outer sect disciple has matched your talent! You’ll likely cultivate internal Qi before me, and I may soon call you 'Senior Brother.'"

He smiled. "If you don’t mind, why not visit my courtyard tonight for a drink?"

Li Zhengjing feigned gratitude, covering his face as if moved to tears. "Senior Brother, to be honest, in these six months, I’ve had no friends in the sect. To receive your invitation today is truly... truly..."

"Ah... The feud between Steward Chen and Elder Yuan shouldn’t have fallen on you," Pei Ying said, patting his shoulder. "Once you enter the inner sect, you’ll face no more hardships."

With that, Pei Ying waved and walked toward another bookshelf.

Li Zhengjing wiped his dry eyes, glanced around, then chuckled and brushed off his robes. He wandered the shelves, flipping through books aimlessly before finally reaching the sixth bookshelf, twelfth row. His fingers trailed over the spines as he counted to the thirty-sixth book.

A youth approached from the opposite side.

Li Zhengjing recognized him—Xie Guihai, who had spent five years as a servant before joining the outer sect. Within a year, he had reached the pinnacle of external cultivation, showing remarkable talent.

Xie Guihai’s expression was cold, offering no greeting.

Li Zhengjing ignored him too. After joining the sect, Li Zhengjing had matched Xie Guihai’s external cultivation in just three months, earning his enmity.

They passed each other without a word.

Then, a whisper reached Li Zhengjing’s ears:

"Pei Ying is Steward Chen’s brother-in-law."

Li Zhengjing froze.

Xie Guihai continued walking without pause.

Li Zhengjing muttered in awe, "An eagle preying on a chick..."

Steward Chen was over sixty, old and ugly. His sister must be similar.

"Senior Brother Pei Ying must be aiming to skip fifty years of hard work," Li Zhengjing mused. "How enviable..."

His eyes, however, remained fixed on the bookshelf as he reached for the thirty-sixth book.
