# Chapter 67: The Tragedy of Hunchback Zhang

**Jade Water Yin Body?**

Wang Chan's heart stirred slightly.

If he remembered correctly, this type of spiritual body, once awakened, would produce a strand of **[Jade Water Yin Qi]**. For cultivators practicing yin or water attribute techniques, this could assist in Foundation Establishment, increasing the success rate by half to a full ten percent.

The more willing and emotionally connected the other party was when obtaining the **[Jade Water Yin Qi]**, the better the effect would be. Forcing it like He Changkong had done would only yield at most half the benefit.

During their earlier battle, Su Jue had naturally noticed Wang Chan's yin-attribute mana. That was why she dared to bring this up.

In an instant, Wang Chan understood why Su Jue's primordial yin energy had been so pure, why her body had felt so supple, and why He Changkong had been so possessive of her.

He had already obtained a single **[Breakthrough Point]** from Mo Jingchun, which could increase his Foundation Establishment success rate by ten percent. Although he wasn't entirely sure about the exact conditions for obtaining more **[Breakthrough Points]**, he would figure it out eventually.

Now, if he could carefully cultivate this relationship and obtain a high-quality strand of **[Jade Water Yin Qi]**, that would be another ten percent. Combined with future acquisition of Foundation Establishment Pills, other opportunities, and his meticulously tempered foundation...

"Within ten years, I will come to White Mountain City to see you."

Without another word, Wang Chan lightly tapped his storage pouch and summoned the Flying Butterfly Daggers. He erased his spiritual imprint from them, placed them in a jade box, and handed it to Su Jue. "Take this set of **[Flying Butterfly Daggers]** with you to White Mountain City. Refine them for self-defense."

Opportunities to enter White Mountain City were rare, and Wang Chan had no intention of stopping her. The city was orderly and safe, unlike the dangers of the wilderness. As long as she was cautious, she would be fine.

Moreover, her mention of a ten-year timeframe seemed to be a test for him.

Wang Chan didn't comment on it.

It was a pity that entry into the city was difficult to obtain. He couldn't just cut off her opportunity. Besides, as a demonic cultivator, it would be inconvenient for him to enter. Forcing her to stay would not only diminish the quality of the **[Jade Water Yin Qi]** but was also something he disdained—unlike the likes of He Changkong.

Otherwise, keeping her by his side would have been ideal.

As for Su Jue, her eyes widened in surprise at the gift of flying daggers. Then, with a cry, she threw herself into Wang Chan's arms, weeping with joy.

It seemed her gamble had paid off.

Overcome with emotion, she wished she could melt into Wang Chan like a stream of yin water.

Wang Chan sighed inwardly. This woman, emboldened by her **[Jade Water Yin Body]**, was practically daring him to unleash his **[Dragon's Vigor and Tiger's Ferocity]**.

**Late Afternoon**

Watching the black flying vessel soar into the sky, cutting through the sunset as it disappeared into the horizon, Wang Chan stood atop the relay station's high tower. He turned to gaze at the bustling Little Black River Market and sighed softly.

This place was lively, but ultimately too small.

He hadn't been to White Mountain City yet, but having seen the scale of the black market, Little Black River was truly insignificant in comparison.

In two or three years, he would leave as well.

This time, upon returning, he planned to go into seclusion. He likely wouldn't come back here again.

Wang Chan leisurely descended the tower and strolled through the market stalls under the setting sun.

The bare-chested man who sold Black-Patterned Crowned Snakes had caught another golden variant, drawing a crowd of onlookers. Wang Chan joined the spectacle and bought a jar of golden snake blood for a single spirit coin—perfect for brewing snake-blood wine. A man in his thirties needed to start taking care of his health.

The female cultivator selling Jade Spirit Fruits was still there. Having advanced to mid-stage Qi Refinement, her fruit-gathering skills had improved. Her stall now featured two new types of high-quality spirit fruits, including one mid-grade fruit. Wang Chan bought them all—they would make excellent juice.

The old man selling spirit chickens was still around, with plenty of Willow-Leaf Chickens and Lilac Chickens in stock. Recognizing Wang Chan, he greeted him warmly. Wang Chan bought a few more chickens, wondering if Daoist Chen was still in White Mountain City. She still owed him a meal.

Finally, he arrived at the stall of the voluptuous woman selling braised green lamb. The aroma of meat filled the air before he could even speak. Her ample bosom pressed against his arm as she handed him two pounds of braised lamb—free of charge.

Over the past few months, she had given him over twenty pounds of lamb. This time, Wang Chan bought all the braised lamb she had—worth no more than five spirit coins—but tossed her a pouch containing twenty coins before walking away with a flourish.

The woman happily opened the pouch, scanned it with her spiritual sense, and gasped. She quickly tucked it into her storage pouch, pretending nothing had happened, but her eyes grew moist as she watched Wang Chan disappear into the sunset-drenched street.

For a moment, she desperately wanted to chase after him, to bravely tell the handsome Daoist Wang that she wanted to sleep with him—because she feared she might never see him again.

But she looked down at her rough hands, wiped them subconsciously with a towel, then caught a whiff of the meaty scent clinging to her clothes. Silently, she put the towel down, packed up her stall, and trudged home alone.

**End of Late Afternoon**

Wang Chan quietly left the Little Black River Market and headed toward Lotus Mountain.

This time, using the **[White Ghost Mask]** to alter his appearance, he had purchased various cultivation resources—enough supplies for several years, including Spirit Nourishing Liquid, Spirit Bones, medicinal bath ingredients, and some expensive **[Yin Mushroom Pills]**.

He already had plenty of spirit coins, and Mo Jingchun had gifted him ten thousand more on the way. He Changkong's storage pouch had also yielded a considerable haul, though it was still sealed. Cultivation resources weren't a concern.

If not for the fear of over-reliance on pills affecting his foundation, Wang Chan would have bought even more **[Yin Mushroom Pills]**.

**Three Days Later**

Wang Chan was deep in meditation when a disturbance arose in the neighboring Cave No. 68.

Luo Bing was busy in the kitchen, apparently preparing a feast.

In the living room, Hunchback Zhang was entertaining a long-faced cultivator—a Qi Refinement early-stager with about thirty strands of mana.

The two sat facing each other as Zhang poured tea for his guest.

"Brother Zhang, I owe you my life for saving me last time," the long-faced man said, raising his cup in gratitude.

"Ma Kang, let's not dwell on the past. We were like brothers when we farmed together," Zhang waved it off. "You haven't forgotten how to tend the fields, have you? I'll find you some honest work soon."

"Thank you, Brother Zhang," Ma Kang said gratefully, then hesitated. "But... I came to ask for another favor. Once I'm back on my feet, I'll repay you tenfold."

Zhang's expression darkened. "Ma Kang, you—"

"With the ten spirit coins you gave me yesterday, I thought my luck had turned. I went to the gambling den and won a hundred coins in just two hours!" Ma Kang said excitedly. "I thought I could finally repay you, but then—I don't know what came over me—I lost it all and ended up owing the den a thousand coins!"

"Ma Kang, how could you be so foolish!" Zhang slammed his cup on the table in frustration.

"The den is run by the Black Eagle Gang. They planted a mark and a restriction on me, forcing me to sign a contract. I have three days to pay, or they'll kill me," Ma Kang pleaded. "Brother Zhang, I don't want to die. For the sake of our friendship, please help me one last time. I swear I'll never gamble again—I'll farm honestly and pay you back slowly."

Zhang sighed deeply. "Ten or twenty coins, I could scrape together. But a thousand? Where would I get that kind of money?"

"So you're just going to let me die?" Ma Kang's eyes turned bloodshot.

"I'm just a spirit farmer! How am I supposed to conjure up a thousand coins?" Zhang's voice turned icy.

"You could sell your Little Earth Array—that's worth more than a thousand! You could save me and still have enough to buy farming tools," Ma Kang suggested eagerly. "Or—if that's not enough—sell your woman as a cultivation vessel. She's a fine piece, must be good in bed. She'd fetch a good price. Brothers are forever, women are replaceable. Once I'm rich, I'll get you two beauties—"

*Smack!* 

Zhang hurled his teacup at Ma Kang's face. "I was blind to think you were anything but a heartless beast! Get out! Out!"

He slapped his storage pouch, summoning a low-grade protective talisman and a short sword, pointing it at Ma Kang.

Ma Kang fled without another word.

Seeing him go, Zhang had no intention of actually killing him—he just wanted nothing more to do with the man. But the array barrier trapped Ma Kang inside the courtyard.

The commotion drew Luo Bing from the kitchen. Seeing Zhang armed and facing Ma Kang, she immediately summoned a silk handkerchief, ready to defend.

"Leave!" Zhang activated the array token, opening the gate to let Ma Kang out.

Suddenly—

Two streaks of dark golden light shot through the open gate, splitting mid-air as they arrowed toward Zhang and Luo Bing.
