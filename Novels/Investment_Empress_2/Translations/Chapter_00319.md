# Chapter 319: The Cold Ice Lump's Gift, The Assault Begins!

The barbecue version of the "Empty Fort Strategy" combined with the "King of Brawling's Secret Technique" proved incredibly effective.

The generals on the city wall, while still eating and drinking on the surface, had their hearts in their throats, sweating nervously for Li Mo.

Young Hero Li not only used the "Ginseng Chicken" tactic on the enemy commander, but he also turned his back on the enemy army.

The enemy forces, brimming with ferocity, had clearly intended to crush and capture Green Wood City in one fell swoop.

Yet, at this moment, they were completely intimidated, stopping dead in their tracks!

One man held back an army of over a hundred thousand and a thousand Disaster Beasts!

Is this the value of the Best Actor award?

"Have the military instruments been arranged?"

"We need at least half an hour more."

"But flying Disaster Beasts are hard to guard against. Even if we intercept them with all our might, the situation inside the city might be exposed."

The generals looked up.

In the distance, hundreds of colorful birds were flying straight toward Green Wood City.

These flying targets weren't particularly strong, but they flew high and fast. Even if a Internal Scene expert flew up to intercept them, they wouldn't be able to stop all of them.

"Archers and crossbowmen, prepare! Intercept as many as you can!"

Li Mo stood with his back to the enemy.

Watching the soldiers pick up their strong bows and powerful crossbows, nocking arrows and drawing bowstrings, his fists clenched silently.

Now, he couldn't move, he couldn't act.

He was the protagonist of this barbecue strategy. Before he was found out, he had to play this role perfectly.

Even Lord Zhuge Liang had to sit there playing the zither.

Now, he could only hope that the soldiers' archery skills were excellent.

Well, actually, whether they shot accurately didn't really matter. It was a covering fire anyway, a volley of arrows shot out in a large wave.

Disaster Beast scouts occasionally fell from the sky, but there were still plenty that slipped through the net.

"Damn it, there's a peak Rank 7 flying Disaster Beast among these scouts!"

It was a Great Wind Clan beast.

With a gust of wind, it deflected the arrows shot at it, and dozens of flying Disaster Beasts behind it followed it through the wind, about to rush into the city.

"It looks like we'll have to lower the city gate..."

Li Mo was thinking this to himself.

Suddenly, a multicolored light shot up from the city, pointing straight at the heavens.

The sword light was like a river across the sky, also composed of over a hundred strands of sword intent and sword energy, enveloped in a heart-piercing Yin coldness.

A graceful figure, like a fleeting swan, suddenly rode a sword, carrying the Yin coldness, piercing through the void and shuttling through the blue firmament.

*Crackle—*

Including that peak Rank 7 Disaster Beast, dozens of flying Disaster Beasts were frozen into ice sculptures, then blown into pieces of sparkling crystal by the exploding sword energy.

This move.

Li Mo was very familiar with it.

The city wall fell silent for a moment.

Ice crystals drifted down, just like the first snow yesterday. She landed on the city wall amidst the snow, her black hair dancing, her Immortal Robe fluttering, looking like a celestial being.

"It's Fairy Han!"

"She's here to help too! We're sure to win this battle!"

"Did anyone see that sword clearly? It felt faster than the blink of an eye!"

"This is the youngest member of the Top Ten on the Dragon List in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands!"

The soldiers' morale grew increasingly high.

They wouldn't forget that this woman, upon first understanding military formations, had the ability to command thousands of troops.

Little Li had to admit, that move by the Ice Lump was incredibly cool.

Even his heart raced when he saw it.

Mainly because she was now using the Cold Goose form. Her silver-white Immortal Robe, the short skirt showing off her long legs to the fullest, and her entire aura were indescribably cold and enchanting.

She was originally only half a head shorter than the over 1.8-meter-tall Li Mo, but with this aura alone, she looked taller than him now.

But for someone so cold.

Her gaze as she looked over carried a hint of gentleness.

"Why are you here?" Little Li, the military genius, snapped back to his senses.

"And why are you standing here?" Ying Bing slowly sheathed her sword, her cold eyes slightly downcast.

"For the people who died, for the citizens in the city, for the peace and joy of many?"

"All of that."

"But is it also... for me?"

Li Mo: "!"

The military genius, Little Li, trembled slightly.

Ice Lump, what are you doing?

Do you know how hard it was for me to maintain this calm and confident appearance? My heart just raced, and I almost broke character.

"Don't forget what I told you that day," Ying Bing said seriously.

Li Mo remembered.

That day, the Ice Lump had looked at him just as seriously.

She said that from now on, through all causes and effects, the two of them would share blessings and misfortunes, life and death.

"En!"

"Are you hungry?"

"Hiss, Ice Lump, if you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have remembered. I've only eaten two skewers of lamb since yesterday."

Little Li suddenly wasn't nervous anymore, even with his back to over a hundred thousand enemies.

Because the Ice Lump took a skewer of barbecue and brought it to his lips.

"Eat."

---

"Who烤ed this skewer? It's a bit burnt..."

"I did."

"That's why it's so burnt on the outside but tender on the inside, truly authentic."

It was strange.

Little Li was originally a bit nervous, but once the Ice Lump stood beside him, he suddenly felt all the pressure disappear, and he didn't even have to pretend to be relaxed anymore.

More importantly.

The Ice Lump's aura was noble and peerless, reaching three meters eight. Standing here.

As her enemy, who wouldn't be intimidated?

The barbecue version of the Empty Fort Strategy, after being amplified by the King of Brawling's Secret Technique, had received an epic-level buff!

趁着這個空檔.

"Brother Donglai, don't go just yet," Li Mo transmitted.

Huang Donglai's footsteps paused.

He knew that the next plan after the Empty Fort Strategy was about to begin.

On the city wall.

The Best Actor had welcomed his Best Actress!

"... "

The soldiers present suddenly felt a bit full and couldn't eat their skewers anymore.

If it weren't for the military orders, they would have felt they should just leave. Sitting here was inexplicably uncomfortable, like sitting on pins and needles.

"?"

Below the city wall.

The enemy army composed of Disaster Beasts and various clans, over a hundred thousand strong, was inexplicably silent at this moment.

Come on.

We're already shivering in the cold wind, which is pitiful enough.

It's already inhumane enough for you to be eating such delicious barbecue on the city wall right in front of us.

Are you afraid we're hungry, so you're feeding us dog food too?

This is truly heartwarming.

"It's her!"

Han Zhen's eyes lit up suddenly.

This girl possesses the Jade Phoenix God, the Blood Phoenix Essence, and the Radiant Phoenix Qi!

She has already obtained three of the Ancestral Spirits! And she's a Ten Extreme Body recorded in history, a Natural Phoenix Body!

"Could she be... Fairy Han, Ying Bing?" Helian Wu swallowed, shocked.

"It's a pity, a pity. If she were willing to join the sect, she could be on equal footing with me!"

Han Zhen眯着眼, sighed longly.

"Han Shi, the flying scouts were just slain by this woman. Are we going to keep wasting time here?"

The Beast Hall Master frowned.

Although they knew the Green Wood defenders' grain reserves might not be plentiful, they couldn't afford to waste time here. If the King of the South arrived, the grand trend would be lost.

"I will use a secret technique to scout the city. It will take some time."

Han Zhen made up his mind, bit the tip of his tongue, and the phantom of the Bronze Divine Tree appeared behind him.

Within it, a dim divine bird phantom was covered by a mouthful of blood, glowing with a blood-red light.

The bloodlust and killing intent of the great army would weaken the soul.

Using a secret technique by force came at a great cost.

Above the city gate.

Ying Bing said softly, "Han Zhen is using a blood witch technique."

Li Mo nodded, understanding her meaning.

"It seems this barbecue strategy is about to come to an end."

As he spoke, he looked at the soldiers who had already left the barbecue stall and were standing ready, and the cooking smoke that the north wind kept blowing south.

"We've already done everything we could..."

"Li Mo."

Ying Bing's slender, pale hands gripped Tian Frost. The battle was about to begin, but the corners of her crimson lips seemed to curve up slightly.

"That day you gave me a candy, I actually have something I want to give you too."

"What?"

"There are too many people here. I'll tell you after the battle."

Ying Bing opened the big-headed doll and put the candy in her pocket inside it.

"??!"

Li Mo realized that the Ice Lump who said this was the *bad* Ice Lump.

And it seemed the Ice Lump didn't know about something called "flags"...

Not long after.

A quarter of an hour before the hour was up.

Below, Han Zhen's face was pale, but he suddenly opened his eyes, his voice suddenly becoming a bit sharp:

"This kid is bluffing us!"

"All troops, listen to the order! Attack the city!"

...
