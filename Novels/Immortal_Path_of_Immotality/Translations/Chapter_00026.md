# Chapter 26: Presenting the Blade

Lin Shan followed Manager Jiang to the fourth floor, which was arranged as a grand hall—simple, ancient, and sparsely furnished with only a few desks scattered about.  

At the far end of the hall sat a man in black robes, cross-legged in meditation. From a distance, white mist swirled around him, his robes and hair ribbons fluttering with each breath.  

It was none other than Protector Jiang, whom Lin Shan had met before.  

"Exhaling true qi, condensing it into mist—this is the hallmark of an innate master. They say Protector Jiang is half-step innate, but from the looks of it, he’s not far from the real thing," Lin Shan marveled silently.  

Manager Jiang, seemingly accustomed to such scenes, said nothing and merely led Lin Shan to wait at the foot of the steps, not daring to disturb Protector Jiang’s cultivation.  

---  

About a quarter of an hour later, the white mist around Protector Jiang coalesced into a stream and vanished into his nostrils. He slowly opened his eyes, a flash of white light extending three inches from his pupils!  

"Light in the void! Congratulations, Protector, on your divine technique reaching perfection!"  

Manager Jiang, ever observant, seized the moment to flatter, his timing impeccable.  

"What do you want?"  

Protector Jiang’s voice was cold, his expression unreadable.  

Manager Jiang hurriedly bowed and reported, "My lord, this junior behind me admires your grace and wishes to behold your presence and receive your guidance. Seeing his youth and potential, I took the liberty of bringing him before you."  

Protector Jiang listened impassively. As a veteran of the organization, he knew men like Manager Jiang well—this old fox wouldn’t risk his displeasure without substantial benefits.  

With a cold "hmph," Protector Jiang silenced him.  

The hall fell into a heavy silence.  

After a moment, a voice echoed from the far end.  

"What do you seek from me?"  

Lin Shan knew this was his moment. Steadying himself, he clasped his fists and bowed.  

"This junior has a matter to discuss with the Protector in private. I beg your indulgence."  

Silence.  

As the tension thickened, Manager Jiang, recalling the teapot he’d just received, steeled himself and interjected.  

"Protector Jiang’s time is precious. Speak your business now and don’t waste it!"  

He shot Lin Shan a pointed look, urging him to get to the point.  

Lin Shan remained unmoved. "This matter is of great importance and holds only benefits for the Protector."  

He swallowed hard, stealing a glance at the distant figure. "I believe if this opportunity is missed, the Protector will regret it for a lifetime!"  

---  

Manager Jiang’s face paled. "Insolence!" he barked, then hastily bowed to Protector Jiang, pulling at Lin Shan to leave.  

For all his greed, the old man was reliable—taking payment meant seeing things through.  

But then, laughter rang from the other end of the hall.  

"Bold words!"  

Protector Jiang stood, eyeing Lin Shan with a faint smirk. "If I recall, you’re the one who killed Fatty Li and took his place, aren’t you?"  

"What? You killed Fatty Li?" Manager Jiang gaped at Lin Shan in disbelief.  

Having spent years in Nightingale, he knew Fatty Li well—a peak Muscle-Tempering expert who’d even exchanged for martial manuals from him. Had this kid been hiding his strength all along?  

Lin Shan seized the moment. "I haven’t yet thanked the Protector for his kindness that night. This junior is eternally grateful!"  

Manager Jiang felt like an outsider—not only did they know each other, but Lin Shan had also been favored by the Protector?  

Before he could dwell on it, Protector Jiang waved a sleeve.  

"Leave us."  

"Yes."  

Manager Jiang bowed and retreated downstairs.  

---  

"Now, speak."  

Lin Shan nodded. "Protector, behold!"  

Without further explanation, he drew a blade from his back—though it resembled a sword, only one edge was sharpened.  

The weapon gleamed coldly, etched with cryptic symbols, marking it as no ordinary armament.  

Lin Shan approached a nearby table, drew his dagger, and embedded it into the wood, leaving only an inch exposed. Then, without channeling any qi, he swung the blade.  

The dagger snapped cleanly.  

Clang—  

Protector Jiang ignored the fallen blade, his gaze fixed on Lin Shan’s weapon. "A fine blade!"  

"That night at the city gates, I saw the Protector’s peerless skill, yet lacking a divine weapon to match. This junior recalled his family heirloom—too precious to reveal with my meager strength, it has remained hidden until now."  

"I present it to the Protector today!"  

Lin Shan’s voice quivered with emotion, eyes glistening. "Having wandered rootless since youth, it was only by the Protector’s grace that I found refuge in this organization. As they say, a drop of kindness deserves a flood in return."  

"Moreover, a treasured blade suits a hero—a match made in heaven!"  

Protector Jiang watched him with a mix of amusement and exasperation. Still, one didn’t strike a smiling gift-bearer. He nodded slightly, humoring Lin Shan’s theatrics.  

"Bring it here."  

Lin Shan presented the blade respectfully.  

Protector Jiang caressed it lovingly. "What is its name?"  

"Kunwu."  

"A fine name!"  

The sudden exclamation startled Lin Shan. These Nightingale folks were all so excitable—first Scarface, now this.  

---  

After watching Protector Jiang admire the blade for another quarter-hour, lost in admiration, Lin Shan coughed lightly.  

"Hm?"  

Noticing Lin Shan still standing below, Protector Jiang chuckled awkwardly. "Truly a divine weapon, flawless."  

Then, magnanimously, he declared, "Name your reward. No need for pretense!"  

Knowing the Protector disliked roundabout talk, Lin Shan cut to the chase.  

"This junior humbly requests two innate-level cultivation manuals."  

He held his breath. Divine weapons were one thing, but innate techniques were closely guarded secrets of major sects. Would Protector Jiang abuse his power for personal gain?  

Still, Lin Shan had gambled on two points: Protector Jiang had the authority, and the manuals weren’t his personal possessions—a cost-free trade for a priceless blade.  

But if he proved stubborn...  

Before Lin Shan could overthink, Protector Jiang surprised him.  

A black object flew toward him.  

Lin Shan caught it—a black token engraved with "Jiang" on one side and "Protector" on the other.  

"Take this to Old Jiang. Tell him to give you two copied manuals in my name."  

With that, Protector Jiang dismissed him, already engrossed in caressing the Kunwu Blade as if it were a peerless beauty.  

Lin Shan was ecstatic. Who knew it’d be this easy?  

Inwardly singing Protector Jiang’s praises, he bowed deeply and hurried downstairs.  

Innate techniques—here I come!
