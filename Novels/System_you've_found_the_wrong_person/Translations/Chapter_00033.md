**Chapter 33: The Brotherhood Alliance**  

Following the example of ancient sages, they gathered at Qingyang Peak to pledge their loyalty.  

A blood oath was sworn—life and death shared as one.  

*What nonsense!*  

Dou Changsheng had only two words for this farce.  

Chen Weiquan, dressed in pristine white and as handsome as a demon, was clearly recorded in history as the man who, three years later, would ambush and kill him at Shili Slope under the orders of the Fire Cloud True Master.  

Chen Weiquan was a subordinate of Chen Qingyao, the Grand Chancellor of the Great Jin Dynasty. Dou Changsheng doubted that Chen Weiquan had no connection to Chen Qingyao three years prior.  

Though Chen Weiquan’s official reason for coming to Sanyang Mountain was to cultivate the *Seven Injuries Fist* using the Qingyang Spring, Dou Changsheng suspected his true motive was the stolen military funds.  

Chen Qingyao was the prime suspect behind the theft. Whether he was investigating the crime or covering it up, he needed agents to gather intelligence discreetly.  

Thus, this entire gathering was nothing but a ploy.  

Chen Weiquan’s impassioned speech was merely a ruse to embed himself beside Dou Changsheng, monitoring his movements and progress.  

It couldn’t be helped.  

Everyone who saw Dou Changsheng arrive at Sanyang Mountain assumed he was there for the military funds.  

A figure surfaced in Dou Changsheng’s mind—the elder who had taught him the *Three Origins Qi Method (Innate Chapter)*. Initially believed to be a high-ranking member of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan, the elder’s true allegiance was now in question. Sending Dou Changsheng to Sanyang Mountain made him seem more like an agent of the true mastermind.  

Leaving now was out of the question.  

He had taken the elder’s benefits—personal instruction from a Divine Marvel Grandmaster. Though brief, the teachings had been invaluable.  

The elder hadn’t explicitly tasked him with investigating, only to draw attention by appearing at Sanyang Mountain—a classic diversion tactic.  

Such a simple mission was easy to fulfill. Afterward, he could claim the Qingyang Spring, refine one of his Five Qi, and elevate his innate true qi.  

While Chen Weiquan harbored ill intentions, Lin Daoqi’s motives were harder to discern.  

Lin Daoqi came from a prestigious background, far surpassing Chen Weiquan.  

Though Chen Weiquan’s family currently held power, maintaining such status was no easy feat.  

The Lin Clan of the capital, however, boasted generations of Divine Marvel Grandmasters, with at least one member ranking on the Earthly Rankings every three generations.  

Unlike ordinary families, martial clans could protect their descendants for generations.  

The Lin Clan was a true aristocratic powerhouse, their stance unpredictable—and irrelevant to Dou Changsheng.  

After a brief silence, Dou Changsheng spoke solemnly:  

*"We gather at Qingyang Peak, emulating the righteous alliances of old."*  

*"To serve the court above and protect the people below—let us swear a blood oath, sharing life and death!"*  

Flowery words weren’t beyond him. After setting the tone, he paused before continuing:  

*"The military funds were stolen near Sanyang Mountain. This shall be the first major case our alliance investigates."*  

Lin Daoqi’s thick beard bristled like a porcupine’s quills as he laughed heartily. *"Well said!"*  

*"Our duty is to uphold justice and quell the chaos in the north!"*  

*"Two hundred years ago at Tiandu Mountain, eight men swore a blood oath to form the Divine Land Alliance, ensuring evildoers faced retribution and the virtuous lived in peace."*  

*"The Divine Land Alliance once commanded reverence across nations, ushering in an era of unprecedented peace—until its leader vanished and the alliance crumbled."*  

*"Today, we too are eight. Let us revive the Divine Land Alliance!"*  

*"If the heavens won’t deliver justice, the Divine Land Alliance will!"*  

*Damn it.*  

*You’re playing too big.*  

Dou Changsheng stared blankly at Lin Daoqi, stunned.  

Even Chen Weiquan was taken aback.  

The Divine Land Alliance had once arbitrated wars between nations, its authority unchallenged by sects or noble houses.  

Even now, its name struck fear into the hearts of martial clans.  

Reviving it would send shockwaves through the world.  

A previously silent youth suddenly spoke: *"The name ‘Divine Land Alliance’ carries too much weight."*  

*"Why not call it the Brotherhood Alliance?"*  

*"We gather at Qingyang out of shared ideals—loyalty and righteousness shall guide us in aiding the weak and punishing the wicked."*  

*"Wang Dingli speaks wisely,"* someone immediately agreed.  

Lin Daoqi slammed the table. *"Then Brotherhood Alliance it is!"*  

Chen Weiquan’s eyes narrowed. Ignoring Lin Daoqi, he locked gazes with Dou Changsheng.  

Both recognized the scheme—Lin Daoqi and Wang Dingli were performing a well-rehearsed act.  

Lin Daoqi knew full well the implications of invoking the Divine Land Alliance. His exaggerated proposal was merely a setup to make the Brotherhood Alliance seem more palatable.  

*This place is a den of snakes and rats.*  

Dou Changsheng felt like he’d barely sat down before being bombarded with schemes.  

Lin Daoqi’s piercing gaze swept the room. He slit his finger and smeared the blood across his lips, declaring:  

*"Today, we swear a blood oath—bound in loyalty, sharing life and death!"*  

Chen Weiquan frowned at Lin Daoqi’s coercive theatrics. Refusing now would brand one as dishonorable.  

He stood abruptly. *"A blood oath is fine."*  

*"But who shall lead this alliance?"*  

*"By strength? Reputation? Or virtue?"*  

*"In strength, the ‘Gentleman Sword’ Dou Changsheng has slain an Innate True Realm expert. In reputation, his escort of military supplies through Sword Gate Pass earned praise from Earthly Ranking grandmasters."*  

*"Lin Daoqi, your fame is confined to the capital. How can you compare to Dou Changsheng’s renown? Your duels end in draws—you’ve never slain a Five Qi Perfection expert."*  

*"Should the alliance leader be you…"*  

*"Or the Gentleman Sword?"*  

*"If you yield to him, I’ll accept it gladly."*  

*"But if you seek leadership, I, Chen Weiquan, refuse!"*  

*"Dou Changsheng came to Sanyang Mountain despite the dangers, solely to investigate the stolen funds. The rest of us merely stumbled upon this gathering."*  

*"The difference is clear."*  

*"I nominate the Gentleman Sword, Dou Changsheng, as leader of the Brotherhood Alliance!"*
