Chapter 177: The Fourth Forbidden Zone

Moonlight shimmered, and amidst the broken walls and scattered ruins, the faint chirping of insects added to the desolation and tranquility.

Qin Ming stood among the rubble, gazing at the distant mountains and forests. His initial worry transformed into a brilliant smile. His body had fully recovered, brimming with vitality, no longer resembling a "porcelain" object pieced back together.

However, only upon closer inspection did Qin Ming realize a terrifyingly serious problem had emerged in another aspect of his cultivation! All his Heavenly Radiance Energy had fragmented, each type "occupying" its own region, causing his body to appear multi-colored. In the past, he had cultivated numerous types of Heavenly Radiance Energy, all of which were ultimately unified and governed by the Silk Book Art. But now, they had all rebelled, each "claiming dominance."

Lu Zizai had warned him about this long ago, and had even given him World Fire to refine his true cultivation. Qin Ming hadn't expected this day to arrive so quickly! Normally, such a problem should only erupt much later in cultivation. In ancient times, even venerable old seniors whose cultivation rivaled creation itself had exploded in this manner!

Qin Ming's current predicament stemmed from two main reasons. First, at his relatively young age, he had forcefully cultivated five great unique arts and over thirty types of Heavenly Radiance Energy, with twenty-seven of them having reached great accomplishment. The second, and most crucial, reason was his brush with death. He had, in essence, died, and his physical body had collapsed, unable to suppress the various types of Heavenly Radiance Energy. The Silk Book scriptures had long since integrated with him, becoming his blood and instincts, allowing him to command various techniques. But with his body riddled with cracks and his internal organs shattered, how could he still command these techniques? Therefore, when the Golden Jade Weave Robe appeared to heal him and mend his dilapidated physique, the Heavenly Radiance Energy formed by each cultivation method had detached.

His current situation was extremely perilous. If he were to circulate his Heavenly Radiance Energy, even a slight mishap could cause him to explode!

"The Blazing Fire Energy is tangled around my heart, no wonder that area glows like a crimson sun." Qin Ming murmured to himself. Initially, he had thought it was merely a sign of his vigorous vitality. As he breathed, golden light pulsed in his lungs—that was the Golden Silkworm Energy surging with his respiration. Not long ago, Qin Ming had been delighted by this, but now his face was filled with solemnity. The River Luo Energy was entangled in his kidneys; if it were to suddenly erupt, the consequences would be unimaginable!

Qin Ming inspected his internal landscape. All he saw was a vibrant tapestry of colors, with various types of Heavenly Radiance Energy acting like feudal lords, each staking their claim. "You've even started a rebellion!" His liver qi flared, but his expression immediately changed, and he quickly suppressed his anger. This was because the Verdant Wood Energy was entangled in his liver. While it could nourish his body, if he were to lose his temper, the Verdant Wood Energy and Blazing Fire Energy colliding could instantly turn him into a human firecracker. He forced himself to calm down, suppressing his anger and resisting the urge to recklessly use his Heavenly Radiance Energy. He had to resolve this extremely serious problem immediately. According to the Silk Book Art, his condition seemed to have reached a "terminal" stage! Because his true cultivation had scattered! Once one reached such a state, it was extremely difficult to salvage, relying solely on one's own resilience.

Qin Ming returned to the small courtyard and sat on a large bluestone. He no longer had the luxury to ponder the kind old woman or the prematurely aged young man, Wu Yaozu. On the ruins, this sole remaining courtyard, though small and dilapidated, offered a sense of tranquility. The old hen strolled leisurely outside the courtyard gate. In the vegetable patch, a few verdant cucumbers faintly glowed, eggplants were tinged with a slight purple mist, and strawberries emitted a reddish glow... all appearing like spiritual vegetables and fruits.

Qin Ming calmed his mind, then began to circulate the Silk Book Art. He had practiced it for over a decade; it was as natural as breathing, like a golden river flowing through his flesh and blood. Regardless, he decided to first merge all the Heavenly Radiance Energy back together, and then address the "root cause" of the problem. Otherwise, having them scattered was simply too dangerous.

Suddenly, a crimson glow erupted from his heart, as if burning. That was the Blazing Fire Energy emerging.

"Return!" Qin Ming commanded coldly. Eventually, the Silk Book Art subdued it, merging it back into the whole. This allowed him to let out a long breath—he had successfully defused one major threat!

As time flowed, he successively resolved the Golden Silkworm Energy, Soft Energy, Adamant Energy, Overlord Energy, and others. His brows furrowed, and sweat beaded on his face, because these types of Heavenly Radiance Energy were even more unruly than before. Even after being merged, they still seemed to retain a "wildness." For instance, the Blazing Fire Energy had tried to break free multiple times. No wonder it was said that once true cultivation scattered, it was extremely difficult to remedy. Even with his exceptional talent, it was becoming increasingly strenuous. After spending most of the day, he had only managed to re-integrate a fraction of his Heavenly Radiance Energy.

Unbeknownst to him, the sky had turned pitch black. Qin Ming was stunned to find that the moon had vanished, and the world was ink-dark. He realized he didn't understand this place at all. When the moon was present, it seemed to be daytime; only when it disappeared did true night arrive.

As he was drenched in sweat, struggling to merge the Earth-Wood Energy—a particularly stubborn one among the five great unique arts—he suddenly heard sounds of lively activity. Qin Ming stood up. When he reached the courtyard gate, he was completely dumbfounded. What met his eyes was a brilliantly lit, bustling small town.

Was he seeing ghosts?! In the "daytime" when the moon was out, he had only seen rubble and broken walls everywhere, a scene of utter dilapidation. How could it be so lively and teeming with people now? All the houses were lit up, and people came and went on the streets. There were top-tier exotic creatures like Suanni, reclusive practitioners in feathered robes, and "Giant Spirit Gods" nearly ten meters tall. This was definitely no ordinary small town; otherwise, how could so many diverse beings be seen? An old man with golden hair rode past on a four-tusked white elephant down the brightly lit street, flashing a toothy smile at Qin Ming.

"When night falls, do humans, ghosts, and gods all emerge?" Qin Ming mused, finding this place utterly abnormal. He then saw a young man whose body emanated pure Yang consciousness aura, which was quite extraordinary. Next, he saw a moon-insect appear in the night sky, becoming a source of light illuminating the entire town. Around the street corner, a silver-haired girl approached, her divine intellect overflowing from her body, as if enveloped by layers of divine halos. She looked truly exceptional and cast a glance in his direction.

Qin Ming closed the courtyard gate. He couldn't quite figure it out. Was this ruin haunted, or had a strange town truly descended with the arrival of the night fog? He stood in the courtyard and noticed that the entire small courtyard was emitting a faint golden light, appearing quite sacred, isolating the street's clamor outside.

Qin Ming continued to use the Silk Book Art to subdue the Heavenly Radiance Energy until he was utterly exhausted. It was very late, and neither the kind old woman nor the young man Wu Yaozu had appeared.

Qin Ming decided to sort out the food himself. In the small kitchen, there were all sorts of seasonings, plenty of dried meat, and also a kind of five-colored mushroom. "That bowl of mushroom soup, though it made me hallucinate, did me no harm and tasted very fresh."

Soon after, Qin Ming ate his fill. When he emerged from the kitchen, he found that the entire world had changed again. Aside from his humble abode transforming into magnificent jade palaces, he leaned over the courtyard wall and looked out—there was no small town! What he saw was clearly a massive city, with majestic heavenly palaces, divine towers built of white jade, and golden ancient halls, all exuding a sacred aura. Moreover, faint white mist flowed through the city; it was practically a city of immortals. The streets were just as bustling with even more beings: Giant Spirit Gods dozens of meters tall walking about, six-tusked white elephants appearing, and golden-winged great roc birds soaring overhead, casting dazzling golden light. Qin Ming felt groggy. He quickly climbed down from the courtyard wall, entered the ornately carved and splendid room before him, and collapsed onto the purple-misted bed, falling asleep.

The next day, he woke up. When he pushed open the courtyard door, it was still the same scene: soft moonlight, a symphony of insects, and a desolate landscape covered in rubble.

"I must have fallen into a Forbidden Zone!" Qin Ming concluded. The various strange sights he had witnessed far exceeded his expectations. Forbidden Zones, by nature, were not understood; any oddities within them were normal!

"Merge the cultivation!"

For three consecutive days, Qin Ming was mentally and physically exhausted, repeatedly using the Silk Book Art to suppress and finally quell the rebellion, merging all his energies back into one.

At "dusk," just before the moon disappeared, the robust and strong Wu Yaozu appeared, his face filled with shock. "You didn't explode?"

Upon hearing such words, Qin Ming was completely taken aback and even forgot to ask if he was human or ghost. These words alone made him understand: this "old young man" knew his body was about to explode from cultivating the Silk Book Art, and had run away beforehand, afraid of being caught in the blast?

"How peculiar, my grandma said you were terminally ill and might not last three days, yet you're fine?" He was very surprised. This was because he noticed Qin Ming practicing his fists, his Heavenly Radiance Energy surging and illuminating the entire courtyard. Someone on the verge of exploding would never dare to use such power.

"Are you alive or dead?" Qin Ming looked at him.

"I'm alive!" The bearded Wu Yaozu became a little agitated. How could he say such a thing?

Qin Ming looked at him, genuinely feeling his robust vitality and a strong "rainbow light" within his flesh and blood. He was indeed not dead. Qin Ming then asked, "What's going on with the ruins outside? Why is it so lively at night, with all sorts of beings appearing, and seemingly all extraordinary? Do ghosts and gods wander at night?"

Wu Yaozu replied, "My grandma said those people are actually real, coming in dreams, descending upon the town with the night fog."

Qin Ming was puzzled. "Isn't the town outside just rubble? Does it restore itself at night?"

"This is a strange small town at the edge of the Fourth Forbidden Zone," the prematurely aged young man said, shaking his head at the end. "According to people outside, isn't it normal for Forbidden Zones to have all sorts of weird things? Actually... I don't understand it either!"

"The Fourth Forbidden Zone near Kunlun?" Qin Ming was startled. Weren't there only three Forbidden Zones?

Wu Yaozu nodded. "Yes, the former Fourth Forbidden Zone, but it was breached and shattered. Only a few 'remnants' of the Forbidden Zone remain, isolated from the outside world. It's probably been forgotten by now."

Qin Ming was lost in thought. The Kunlun region was truly astonishing, worthy of its legendary status; there were more than just three Forbidden Zones!

Wu Yaozu said, "It's a pity you're on the Path of Rebirth. At this stage, your consciousness can't leave your body. Otherwise, I'd take you to explore the town at night. It's very lively and interesting; you can see all kinds of creatures."

"I should be able to go in!" Qin Ming stated, eager to understand this place.

"Hmm, let's wait until tomorrow after you've met my grandma," Wu Yaozu said.

...

Wu Yaozu left and did not stay.

Afterward, Qin Ming seriously pondered and researched how to completely resolve the issues with the Silk Book Art, and began to experiment. That night, lightning flashed and thunder roared in the small courtyard, followed by strong winds.

The next day, Wu Yaozu appeared, surprised. "Your condition seems even better."

Qin Ming smiled and nodded, following him into a mountain forest. There, he saw a stone mountain, which was entirely a giant statue. His face grew solemn as he looked at Wu Yaozu. This was his grandma?! This old woman, carved from the stone mountain, was exactly how she looked when he first met her—kind and amiable.

"No need to be surprised. This is my remnant image. I died many years ago, but a wisp of pure Yang consciousness remains inextinguishable. Because I couldn't bear to leave my grandson, I linger here like a lonely ghost." The statue carved from the mountain remained still, but a voice emanated from it.

Qin Ming turned back to look at Wu Yaozu. He really was an "old young man"!

The old woman seemed to know what he was thinking and said, "Yaozu was indeed born from a stone egg sixteen years ago. His age is similar to yours." She added, "You are truly extraordinary. To practice that scripture, have your true cultivation scatter, yet not die, and even be able to reintegrate it—your talent is unparalleled, even higher than that old fellow's back then!"

"Senior, are you referring to..." Qin Ming asked.

"One of the earliest cultivators of this scripture," the huge stone statue informed him.

Qin Ming felt a surge of longing. His family's Silk Book had been taken by the Cui family, who refused to return it. If he could obtain the legacy of an ancestral figure here, that would be wonderful! In fact, the old woman's next words were even better than he expected: there really was a part of the Silk Book scriptures here, and it had been refined through cultivation.

"It's very difficult to get your hands on it, because it's inside a divine temple," the stone statue earnestly informed him.

Clearly, the old woman had a favor to ask him, but she didn't elaborate this time. She first wanted to see if he could resolve his own hidden dangers, otherwise, he might explode at any moment.

On the way back, Wu Yaozu told Qin Ming that the scripture should be in the divine temple at the end of the strange small town. At night, he took Qin Ming to stand at the courtyard gate, gazing at the far end of the town, where a cluster of ancient buildings was slowly emerging amidst dense fog.

"The old man who practiced your kind of scripture once discussed the Dao with the master of that divine temple for three days and four nights," Wu Yaozu said. "However, that area is difficult to approach and extremely dangerous."

"That divine temple doesn't also appear with the dream, does it?" Qin Ming asked.

"Yes, few people dare to enter. There are no living people inside the divine temple, and it's quite terrifying," Wu Yaozu nodded.
