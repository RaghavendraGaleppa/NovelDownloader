Chapter 346: The Theft of Heaven and the Exchange of the Sun

Li Xian suddenly saw Lin Aoshan and Han Qingxiao standing alongside He Wentian; he found it difficult to make sense of the mystery within. He had only briefly met Han Qingxiao, and during their conversation, he sensed the man's extraordinary demeanor, yet he dared not hastily judge his character.

However, Lin Aoshan was also present. Li Xian had known her for a long time and understood her nature to some extent. He fell into deep thought: "It seems there is more secrecy to He Wentian's matter. If I reveal myself now and my prediction is wrong, I will inevitably fall into a trap. I must find a way to probe the depths."

He was standing on the balcony of a pavilion. Guests hurried about inside, while many sightseers on the balcony obscured his movements. He looked around and, out of the corner of his eye, saw city patrol soldiers passing by on the street below, equipped with spears, long bows, and bronze arrows. His eyes lit up. He immediately slipped into the crowd and secretly followed the archers.

Passing through a dark alley, he suddenly lunged forward, covering the soldier's mouth and nose with one hand while striking the back of his neck with a hand blade. The soldier collapsed instantly. Li Xian dragged him into the alley and took his bow and arrows. He then climbed a nearby desolate mountain.

Flying Dragon City was vast, with many mountainous areas within its walls. Li Xian hid deep in the mountains, looking out from a high vantage point. The yamen was about three miles away, with numerous pavilions and buildings blocking the line of sight along the way.

This location offered a strategic advantage; he could attack or retreat as he pleased. Li Xian nocked an arrow. His archery was divine; the moment the arrow left the string, there was no sound of breaking wind. The arrow flew out like a phantom, swiftly crossing the air, passing through the windows of several buildings, and shooting into the yamen from an incredibly刁钻 (刁钻 means tricky/diabolical) angle.

It brushed past many people along the way, but its speed was so fast that no one noticed. Han Qingxiao, holding a long knife, suddenly knocked the flying arrow away and said solemnly to He Wentian and Lin Aoshan, "As expected, the visitor is not friendly. Be extremely careful."

The two nodded in unison. Han Qingxiao said, "Let's stand back to back, focusing on the high buildings around us. Let's see who is shooting from the shadows!"

Another "whoosh" sound was heard, and an arrow shot from the southwest direction. Han Qingxiao felt this arrow was tricky and strange. Usually, when an arrow leaves the string, its high speed creates a whistling sound; by listening to the sound, one can accurately knock it down. To shoot an arrow without sound requires an extremely high level of skill.

Han Qingxiao slashed quickly. The fine steel blade collided with the bronze arrowhead, sparking intensely. The arrow carried immense force, actually knocking him back a few steps. The three were originally standing back to back; with Han Qingxiao's steps shifting, Lin Aoshan and He Wentian's backs were naturally exposed.

Immediately, two more arrows shot towards them. Lin Aoshan and He Wentian turned their blades to block simultaneously. Although they blocked the attack, the impact numbed their wrists and made the blades ripple. All three were startled. The swords of the Patrol Sky Division were cast from fine iron, sharp and fierce, and extremely difficult to bend. Han Qingxiao frowned tightly, looking extremely grave, and returned to his original position. He said in a deep voice, "Did you see the archer's position?"

He Wentian said solemnly, "I'm afraid it's not just one person. Just now, three arrows came from different directions. At least three extremely skilled archers are surrounding us." Han Qingxiao nodded. "I think so too. It's hard to deal with. These bastards hide very well. I just scanned the area but didn't see where they are hidden. We can only react as they come. Aoshan, don't be careless, watch out for the arrows."

Lin Aoshan was tense all over. "Brother Han, are we just going to waste time with them?" Han Qingxiao frowned and said to He Wentian, "Tell me in detail about your experience. How were you tracked? This person has ill intentions. I don't know if it's an old grudge or someone from a noble family in the city."

He Wentian recounted the events of the grand meeting in full detail, but there was no clue or lead. As they talked, Han Qingxiao said in a deep voice, "They're coming again!" Several arrows shot over with tricky angles. Han Qingxiao was extremely angry. He struck several times, knocking the arrows down, but the arrows contained immense force. He was busy knocking them down, and the三人 formation was disrupted.

Suddenly, three arrows shot from the west towards Lin Aoshan. Han Qingxiao's heart tightened. After steadying his stance, he immediately moved to help Lin Aoshan block the arrows. But suddenly, the arrows trembled, the shafts snapped with a "bang," and the arrowheads turned abruptly, changing direction unexpectedly to shoot towards He Wentian.

He Wentian never expected this. He was forced into a messy footwork by the three arrowheads and suffered three superficial wounds. Fortunately, his life was not in danger. Han Qingxiao helped him up, his expression extremely grave. "This is bad. The archer is more powerful than I thought!"

Lin Aoshan picked up the broken arrow and exclaimed, "Brother, it's a Broken Feather Arrow!" Han Qingxiao said, "I've already seen it." This was a clever archery technique that allowed the arrow to turn in mid-air. Only an extremely strong archer could execute it.

Once an arrow leaves the string, it usually goes straight. To make an arrow suddenly turn, one must apply a strange force to the arrow before shooting. When the arrow cuts through the sky, this strange force causes the arrow to snap at the cost of the shaft, abruptly changing the direction of the shot.

This is the Broken Feather Arrow. Han Qingxiao also knew this technique, but he couldn't use it skillfully. Moreover, after the arrow shaft breaks, the killing power is greatly reduced. It is truly a chicken rib of a technique. He had never seen this archery method put to practical use before.

It appeared suddenly today, making it extremely difficult to handle. Han Qingxiao said, "The enemy is mysterious and strange. He hides in the dark, utilizing his advantages to the fullest. We are helpless; we need to think of a way quickly."

The three focused their guard, sweat beading on their foreheads. But the arrows didn't come for a long time. Just as their nerves were stretched tight, they heard the yamen gates being knocked. The three looked at each other and slowly walked towards the main hall.

Li Xian shouted, "Brother Han, Aoshan, it's me." Lin Aoshan was delighted and hurriedly opened the door. Seeing it was indeed Li Xian, she immediately pulled him into the yamen, hiding behind a beam. She whispered, "It's dangerous here; archers are attacking. You came just in time. Your archery is good; help us think of a way. Find where the archers are hiding, and we'll sneak up on them."

Li Xian smiled. "No need. The archer has already run away." Lin Aoshan asked curiously, "You scared him off?" Han Qingxiao and He Wentian looked at him strangely.

Li Xian said apologetically, "To be honest, the arrows just now were actually shot by me." Han Qingxiao and He Wentian frowned. Lin Aoshan asked, "Shot by you? Meaning you attacked us just now? Little Li, do you have a problem with us?"

Lin Aoshan thought for a moment and said, "Wait, that doesn't make sense. The arrows came from three directions just now. Do you have accomplices?" Li Xian laughed. "Actually, it was only one direction, but it looked like three."

It turned out that Li Xian had incorporated the principles of the "Four Directions Fist" martial art. His arrows clearly came from only one direction, but he created the illusion of being surrounded from all sides. His archery and Four Directions Fist were both at their peak, allowing for infinite application.

Han Qingxiao asked, "Brother Li, why did you shoot at us for no reason?" Li Xian said, "I apologize for that. It's just that I had a question I was curious about. I couldn't rest until I figured it out. That's why I resorted to this desperate measure. I am here now to apologize."

"I was just in the crowd and saw City Lord He Wentian. I was very curious. I wondered why He Wentian was appearing here unharmed. Why didn't the Five Mountain Sword Alliance deal with him? Why are they letting him bully others? If He Wentian harbored malicious intentions again, what would we do? I wanted to investigate."

"Seeing He Wentian come here to meet you, I knew there was a hidden story. I figured Brother Han couldn't be someone who would join forces with He Wentian. But I had concerns and didn't dare show myself directly. So I used my archery to test him. I found that this He Wentian is likely someone in disguise, but he is very skilled; I couldn't see the flaw."

"After clearing things up, I came to apologize. First, to express my apology, and second, out of genuine curiosity. I have offended you greatly; please don't blame me!"

He spoke with great sincerity. Han Qingxiao's anger subsided, and he thought to himself, "This young man plans before he acts and never puts himself in danger. His thinking is very thorough!"

Lin Aoshan said, "Sigh, there's no help for it. I'll forgive you for now!" She put her hands on her hips, dissatisfied. "You really are something. You shot several arrows just now and didn't hold back. You almost killed me."

Li Xian cupped his hands and flattered, "With the three of you being such grand figures of the Patrol Sky Division, how could I have found anything out if I didn't use all my skills? Besides, Aoshan, we are old friends. I can only wrong you to suffer a little fright." Lin Aoshan nodded. "That's true. But you got one thing wrong. The Patrol Sky Division only has me and Brother Han. This Brother Qubai Tong is from the 'Plucking Stars Division.' Also, although I forgive you, you have to treat me to a meal."

Li Xian smiled. "Naturally, naturally."

He Wentian cupped his hands. "I am Qubai Tong of the Plucking Stars Division." Li Xian said sincerely, "I have offended you, I have offended you."

Qubai Tong said, "It's fine. It's best if we were worried for nothing. This hero's archery is superb; it really opened my eyes." Li Xian asked, "May I ask the几位 to help me understand what is going on here?"

Han Qingxiao said, "I thought Brother Li would know about this." Li Xian smiled bitterly. "If I knew, why would I cause such trouble and disturb you几位? I am truly sorry."

Han Qingxiao said, "It's fine. What happened just now is in the past. Brother Li, please follow me." He led the way to the deep dungeon of the yamen. The candlelight was dim. In a cell lay a man.

He wore an iron mask, covering his entire face. His collarbones were pierced, and thirty-seven nails were driven into his body. The ends of the nails were connected to chains. This allowed him to walk and eat, but his movements were greatly restricted, making it difficult to use martial arts.

Han Qingxiao said, "This is our Patrol Sky Division's Bone-Piercing Trembling Chain method. It is specifically used to capture fierce martial artists. Even the most fierce martial artist is helpless once caught by this. This man is the real 'He Wentian'."

"The day He Wentian was defeated and captured, how to deal with him became a big problem. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance wanted to kill him. But if He Wentian dies, what will happen to Flying Dragon City? The city would fall into chaos. What about the soldiers in the city? What about the noble families? In the end, it would be the common people who suffer."

"Thinking this deeply, the Five Mountain Sword Alliance didn't dare kill He Wentian. It was truly a thorny issue, and they hesitated. Then we suggested a plan to steal the sky and change the sun. Our 'Plucking Stars Division' Brother Qubai Tong accompanied us on this trip. His mission was different; I was investigating Flying Dragon City, while he was observing the star signs here."

"The incident was sudden, so we asked him for help. Brother Qubai has a 'Mud Bone Constitution' naturally. His bone quality is like mud. Although it harms his strength, it is extremely useful for changing his appearance. Moreover, he has practiced the 'Bone Shifting Spirit Skill,' giving him excellent control over his bone quality. Any bone can be shifted to any part of his body."

"By having him touch He Wentian's bone structure once, and then moving and kneading his own bones to match He Wentian's bone structure, he could disguise himself. Aside from close acquaintances, it would be very difficult to detect the difference."

"By having him hold down Flying Dragon City, we can deliver the real He Wentian back to report. The higher-ups will send someone to take over Flying Dragon City. This avoids the chaos and safely completes the mission. Why wouldn't we do it?"

Li Xian suddenly understood. "So that's it. It is rare and admirable that you几位 think so much for the common people!"

Han Qingxiao sighed. "Unfortunately, no matter how much I think for the common people—whether it's a little, three times, or ten times—it is ultimately useless. It still depends on the decisions of the higher-ups and the lords of the Heavenly Palace. If they think only a little, the situation would be very different."

Li Xian said, "Do your best, and have no regrets." He saw that He Wentian was unconscious and asked, "When will he be sent back? Speaking of which... this man is hypocritical and cunning, but he did have real achievements. If he hadn't used insidious and vicious schemes and developed peacefully, relying on his own management and planning, and taking advantage of Flying Dragon City's unique terrain, he could have achieved a good prospect. It's a pity he was too impatient."

Han Qingxiao said, "Fate is hard to explain. If the ground veins hadn't suddenly shifted and caused the Jieyou Tower to collapse, He Wentian's plan would have succeeded. With the help of the Five Mountain Sword Sects, he would have been famous and glorious. Unfortunately, the heavens couldn't stand to see it."

Li Xian thought to himself: "Speaking of which, the culprit behind He Wentian's miserable state is the Madam." His hair sensors tingled, and his mind wavered slightly. The once-dominant Broken Sword Madam was currently struggling awkwardly in the carriage.

Lin Aoshan shouted, "What are you thinking? You have a lecherous look on your face." Li Xian was startled. His thoughts were exposed. He composed himself and asked, "Do I?"

Han Qingxiao smiled. "Brother Li is brilliant. I imagine even if you encounter difficulties, you can solve them." Li Xian asked, "By the way, Brother Qubai, what does your real face look like? Can I see it?"

Qubai Tong smiled. "I shift my bones to change my appearance. This greatly damages my vitality and fortune. I can't change my face casually." Li Xian said, "There is such a strange skill in the world; it really opens my eyes!"

Qubai Tong smiled. "Brother Li is too modest! If I could trade this face-changing skill for your divine archery, I would do it without hesitation."

Han Qingxiao said, "I heard Aoshan mention before that your archery is very strong. Seeing it today, it is indeed extraordinary!" Li Xian said sincerely, "To be honest, I took advantage by calculating the uncalculated. It's natural that I had the upper hand. Do you几位 have any food? Why don't I pay for a meal to apologize properly!"

Lin Aoshan clapped her hands in delight. "Great, great! I won't be polite with you. I'll definitely eat you out of house and home." Li Xian smiled. "Then I shall accompany you!"

Han Qingxiao and Qubai Tong both laughed heartily. With everything resolved, their mood was joyful. Qubai Tong said, "I'll wear a mask first. Let's go to the restaurant. We mustn't let people recognize us."

Han Qingxiao said, "He Wentian is here; it's not suitable to go far. There is a 'Hope Spring Tower' nearby. It's very close and can observe the surroundings of the yamen. Why don't we eat there?" Li Xian smiled. "That would be great."

Just as they were about to leave the hall, Li Xian's expression suddenly changed. He said apologetically, "几位... I suddenly have an important matter. I might not have time tonight. Why don't we treat it as noon tomorrow?"

Lin Aoshan said disappointedly, "What is so important? Is the Madam calling you?" Li Xian nodded. "It is indeed so."

Han Qingxiao said, "That Madam has a bad temper. You should go back quickly." Li Xian cupped his hands. "Goodbye! I will treat you tomorrow." Lin Aoshan mumbled, "Your Madam will call you again tomorrow. Can you even treat us?"

Li Xian patted his chest. "If she calls me tomorrow, I'll just ignore her." Lin Aoshan laughed. "Shame on you, boasting." The three watched Li Xian leave.

Lin Aoshan kicked the snow idly and sighed. "When my strength increases one day, I must find a young man like that to serve me. That Broken Sword Madam really knows how to enjoy herself. Sigh, why do all the good things happen to her?"

Han Qingxiao said, "Speaking of which, not seeing the Broken Sword Madam is a big regret of this trip." Lin Aoshan said, "You know her?"

Han Qingxiao said, "Her reputation isn't obvious, but those who know her won't easily forget. I had just joined the Patrol Sky Division back then and saw her beauty from afar. She truly lives up to the name 'Broken Sword.' Many heroes and elites were made to rise and fall by a woman. My heart was broken, and my sword was broken. I didn't expect her to be in Flying Dragon City and have such a deep connection with Brother Li."

Qubai Tong said, "What is the relationship between this Brother Li and the Broken Sword Madam?" Lin Aoshan said sullenly, "How should I know? Maybe they are lovers." Qubai Tong deliberated for a moment and said, "More likely master and disciple?"

Han Qingxiao laughed heartily. "Let's not worry about it. When we see him tomorrow, we must eat to our heart's content and make him pay dearly. This young man had doubts and tested us with arrows. We must settle this debt at the dinner table!"

Qubai Tong said, "Hahaha, in that case, I must keep my stomach empty tonight and tomorrow morning to recover the debt at noon tomorrow." Lin Aoshan raised her hand. "Recover the debt in one go!"

Li Xian returned to the inn and led out the white horse. He tied the purchased iron pot, vegetables, and desserts onto the saddle. He mounted the horse and hurried out of the city. The wind and snow howled, blowing against his face. His expression was strange, but he wasn't anxious.

Through the "Ear and Eye Sensing," he saw Wen Caishang struggling violently, falling off the bed. He thought to himself: "A dignified Madam, tied up like this. She must be cursing me to death. I really am something. I came out to buy things but got distracted by other matters."

Returning to Snow Hidden Mountain, there were no human traces around. Occasionally, wild beasts appeared, but there were no snow wolves or snow bears around the snow lake. Wen Caishang's carriage was sturdy; even if a snow bear appeared, it couldn't break the door.

Li Xian tied the white horse under a tree and infused it with two strands of heat energy. The white horse lay down in the snow to sleep, while he went deeper in. The remaining path was covered with thick rotten leaves under the snow carpet, making it very difficult for horses and beasts to walk.

Li Xian used the "Light Word Jue" characteristic and stepped on the "Seven Star Step." After walking for half an hour, through the ear and eye sensing, Wen Caishang seemed to be impatient. She was very irritable, but her hands and feet were restrained, so she could only vent her frustration in vain.

The temperature gradually warmed, and he returned to the lake side. The charcoal fire inside the carriage was dim, barely filling the darkness. The surroundings were quiet and peaceful, but being tied up here alone inevitably made her feel hopeless. Li Xian pushed open the carriage. Wen Caishang immediately glared at him,olding back tears, she cursed, "Villain!"

Li Xian carried Wen Caishang back to the bed and tucked her in thoughtfully. Wen Caishang couldn't do anything to Li Xian and felt extremely wronged. Li Xian lit the candles, and the carriage became bright again.

Although the carriage was spacious, it was a bit cramped for two people. Li Xian was tall and had difficulty stretching his limbs. However, the four walls of the carriage could be pushed open and propped flat on the ground, turning it into an open-air pavilion with a roof.

Surrounded by the serene green lake and beautiful scenery. The stove fire burned slowly, and the temperature was pleasant. It was truly a scene of enjoyment. Wen Caishang had waited for a long time and was extremely annoyed with Li Xian. But seeing him return, she couldn't help but relax her mind. Seeing him busy here and there, knowing exactly how to use the carriage's many clever mechanisms, she realized she had never used them like this.

Li Xian fetched water from the lake. He breathed a clear breath, making the lake water clean, and placed it on the charcoal fire to boil. The water gradually heated. Li Xian added seasonings, and an aroma immediately filled the air.

Flying Dragon City was a first-class town, with abundant food and a variety of dishes. Li Xian bought donkey meat, venison, civet meat, beef... in sufficient quantities, as well as many street snacks, ice-sugar gourds, snow pastry cakes, etc.

After everything was prepared, he placed two small cushions by the table. Li Xian carried Wen Caishang down from the bed and helped her remove a jade walnut from her mouth. Wen Caishang's pretty face flushed slightly. The remaining one, she could spit out herself. Seeing it stained with saliva, she thought about how she had lost composure like this. She felt extremely resentful and embarrassed. She was at a loss for a moment.

Li Xian wiped the jade walnut clean and placed it on the table. Wen Caishang's gaze drifted unconsciously to the jade walnut. The once-boring toy had witnessed her mouth's ordeal. She gradually calmed down and thought: "I, Wen Caishang, a dominant figure for many years, was actually tricked by a brat. It's one thing to fall into his trap, but to be captured alive by him. Seeing me in this state, it really damages my prestige. Hmph, how can I let you得意 (be proud)?"

She said softly, "Li Lang, you calculated deeply, but you missed one point." Li Xian frowned. "Which point?"

Wen Caishang lectured, "You used the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Swords to restrain me. That's correct. You are smart, very good at using your strengths to attack others' weaknesses. I was momentarily negligent and was subdued by you. But you ignored that I practice the 'Silk Garment Jade Shifting Art.' You used the Green Silkworm Rope to tie me, which happened to help my cultivation. My Silk Garment Jade Shifting Art is several times stronger than the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Swords. The Yin-Yang sword momentum was already dispersed."

Li Xian said in a deep voice, "Then why doesn't the Madam break free?" Wen Caishang said softly, "Naturally, it's to give you one last chance. Li Lang, if you untie me now, I still won't blame you."

"Good Li Lang, if you can't grasp this last chance. Hmph!" Wen Caishang's expression turned cold. "Then don't blame me for being rude to you!"

Li Xian asked tremblingly, "Re-really? Will the Madam really forgive me? For doing such a wrong thing to the Madam." Wen Caishang smiled. "Although I won't blame you, I still have to punish you."

Li Xian looked conflicted. "I will untie the Madam now. If the Madam wants to punish me, I... I will accept the punishment." Wen Caishang smiled. "That's a good boy."

Li Xian made a move to untie her. Suddenly, he turned and lightly tickled the soles of her feet. Wen Caishang was startled and couldn't help but let out a silver-bell-like laugh. She immediately forced her expression to be cold and scolded, "What are you doing! If you fool around like this again, I won't give you the chance."

Li Xian apologized, "Sorry, sorry, my hand trembled. I hope the Madam doesn't blame me. I'll untie you now." Wen Caishang took a deep breath. "Fine, I'll forgive you once more. Quickly untie me, and I will punish you lightly."

Li Xian said, "Of course, of course." He made a move to untie her, but turned his势头 (momentum) again, tickling her soles again. Wen Caishang couldn't stop laughing. After barely enduring it, she gritted her silver teeth and said weakly, "This time... is this also a hand tremble?!"

Li Xian nodded. "Yes, yes, it's also a hand tremble." Wen Caishang forced herself to maintain her dignity. "I will tolerate you one last time. Don't mistake my kindness!"

Li Xian patted his chest. "This time I guarantee no hand tremble. Please rest assured, Madam." His mouth was trembling with fear, but his heart was full of bad ideas. He didn't help untie her; instead, he tightened the ropes a bit. He repeatedly sent palm winds to the soles of her feet to provoke her. At first, he still concealed it, but later he simply stopped pretending.

Wen Caishang knew her plan had failed; she was just forcing herself to save face. Her soles were repeatedly attacked. She knew Li Xian was secretly being naughty. This time, she frowned tightly and refused to make a sound to laugh. But she could hold it for a moment, not two. She still laughed out loud, as if undergoing severe torture. She cried out in her heart, saying that Li Xian was cunning. Ordinary deception tricks were not only useless but also made him have bad intentions. Now, she didn't care about face and repeatedly asked him to stop.

Li Xian, full of bad ideas, said solemnly, "Madam, if you surrender, you should look like you are surrendering. You tricked me so badly. If you don't beg for mercy obediently, it's my turn to punish you." Wen Caishang bit her red lips tightly and had to shout shamefully, "Good hero, good hero, Caishang knows she was wrong. I shouldn't have lied to you. Please spare my life."
