# Chapter 21: Medicine Testing Disciple  

Jiang Li surveyed the mission board for Qi Refining beginners. Many tasks were posted long-term and could be broadly categorized into several types.  

First, **"Menial Labor"**: These were the simplest and lowest-paying tasks, usually issued directly by the sect. They included chores like cleaning, hauling supplies, and other dirty, strenuous work—tasks even ordinary healthy mortals could handle. These were reserved for disciples who hadn't even managed to draw Qi into their bodies after a year.  

Second, **"Skilled Labor"**: These tasks were typically posted by the sect's industries, such as mines, spirit farms, and herb gardens. The work involved mining, farming, or cultivating spirit fields. Unlike ordinary crops, extracting spirit ores and growing spiritual materials required disciples to at least reach the Qi Refining stage and possess certain techniques.  

Third, **"Qi-Expending Labor"**: Experienced outer sect disciples knew these tasks were actually quite challenging. For example, the job of a furnace-tending disciple required continuous output of both Wood and Fire Qi for a full two hours. Most Qi Refining disciples couldn't endure it—they'd usually end up consuming all the Qi-replenishing pills from the reward on the spot. Unless a disciple had accumulated enough experience (equivalent to at least Level 3 on the system panel), attempting such tasks risked damaging their Qi Sea and regressing their cultivation—hardly worth the effort.  

Fourth, **"Gathering Labor"**: These tasks usually involved fieldwork. The requester would specify a material and provide its likely location, and disciples would set out to collect it. This was the only type of outdoor task available to Qi Refining beginners. The unpredictable nature of these missions often led to unexpected gains, making them popular among opportunistic disciples. However, venturing beyond the sect's territory carried inherent risks. Disciples needed both self-defense skills and knowledge of spiritual materials.  

Fifth, **"Hazardous Labor"**: These tasks were controversial—infamous for quick payouts but unavoidable injuries. Luck determined how severe the damage would be. Essentially, disciples traded their health and safety for spirit stones. The **"Ghost Needle Grass Collection"** and **"Medicine Testing Disciple"** tasks fell under this category. Gathering Ghost Needle Grass wasn't too bad—just some bleeding and swollen, painful hands for a few days. But being a medicine testing disciple? That was practically gambling with your life. The sect wouldn't poison you, but newly developed pills' effects and side effects had to be tested firsthand by a brave—or foolish—disciple.  

In short, as long as you were willing to pay the price, you could handle most of these tasks.  

Jiang Li licked his lips and suddenly grinned. Some of these tasks appealed to him greatly.  

With an air of confidence, he swaggered up to the mission hall's counter.  

The attendant, Su Xuewei, saw a disciple approaching with such a self-assured smile and assumed he was either taking on some grand mission or had just completed an incredible feat. She straightened up and greeted him with a polite smile.  

"May I help you, Junior Brother? Are you here to accept, post, or submit a mission?"  

(Oh, by the way—did anyone actually believe the disciples sitting behind the counter, handling paperwork with ease while earning generous rewards, were outer sect disciples? Those in key positions with cushy jobs and fat paychecks were all **inner sect disciples**. Some were prodigies, some had risen from the outer sect, and others were simply born into privilege as elders' descendants.  

Of course, even lofty inner sect disciples weren't born at the Foundation Establishment stage. They, too, went through Qi Refining, during which they took up these "civil service" posts. Su Xuewei was one such disciple. She might be young and not particularly strong, but she could rightfully call any outer sect disciple "Junior Brother" or "Junior Sister" without issue.)  

"Elder... Sister, I'd like to accept this mission!"  

Jiang Li nearly called her "Miss" but caught himself in time, handing over a slip of paper that read: **Medicine Testing Disciple**.  

After all, while the pay was good, this job wasn't much different from being a human guinea pig for experimental drugs in his past life—hardly glamorous.  

"Mm-hmm, you're taking a gathering mission, right? Which material? Snake Demon Gallbladder?"  

Su Xuewei glanced at the slip but clearly misread it. Her big, blinking eyes waited expectantly for Jiang Li's response, leaving him awkwardly frozen.  

*Cough*. "Elder Sister, you saw the words but didn't **really** see them. Maybe take another look?"  

Su Xuewei blinked blankly before finally reading the slip properly after a two-second delay.  

"Me-di-cine Tes-ting Dis-ci-ple."  

She enunciated each syllable, drawing laughter from nearby disciples.  

They'd thought he was a champion—turns out he was just a rookie.  

"Ah! My mistake, Junior Brother. Medicine Testing Disciple it is. Hand me your outer sect disciple token, and I'll register you."  

Jiang Li wished he could stuff her mouth shut. Did she not understand why he'd handed her the slip instead of saying it out loud? And now she just—  

*Ugh*.  

Thankfully, no one he knew was around. Embracing the philosophy that *if you're not embarrassed, then others are*, Jiang Li kept a straight face as he registered and retrieved his token before calmly walking away.  

"Junior Brother, report to the Pill Innovation Hall in the Alchemy Pavilion tomorrow at Sishi (9-11 AM). Don't be late!"  

"Oh, and Junior Brother! Take care of your health!"  

She added that last part **loudly**, ensuring everyone heard.  

Now, even more people were staring—especially the ragged, hollow-eyed disciples squatting in corners, who looked at him like he was one of their own.  

Jiang Li had barely set foot in the mission hall, and he was already socially ruined.  

"Got it! Thanks for the reminder, Elder Sister!"  

He wasn't sure if she'd done it on purpose, but it left him thoroughly vexed. *Don't I have any dignity, Jiang Li?*  

Whatever. Dignity meant nothing compared to strength.  

Today, they mocked him as a disposable test subject. But once he rose to power, he'd make them regret ever looking down on him.  

*Maybe I should wear a mask next time?*  

With that thought, Jiang Li strode straight into the outer sect's mass burial ground. He needed to visit daily to mask his rapid cultivation progress.  

And before he could afford a real zombie, he planned to *borrow* a kind senior brother's body.
