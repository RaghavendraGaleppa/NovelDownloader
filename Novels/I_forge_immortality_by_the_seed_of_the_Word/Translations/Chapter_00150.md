# Chapter 147: The Sublime Scripture of Natural Mysteries

Time passed slowly.

The golden crow manifestation carrying nine suns had long since dissipated.

At this moment.

Zhang Jing's expression finally returned to normal, though a trace of lingering fear remained in his eyes.

In his field of vision.

His three senior brothers were watching him with concern.

Zhang Jing forced a smile and said gratefully:

"Thank you for your help just now, senior brothers."

"As long as you're alright, junior brother!"

Seeing Zhang Jing's expression return to normal, the three of them collectively sighed in relief and spoke in unison.

"Senior brother, was that person just now...?"

Zhang Jing looked at Xuan Yuan and asked meaningfully.

"Indeed, that person is a registered disciple belonging to the Celestial Realm faction within the grotto-heaven, and also your senior brother!"

Xuan Yuan emphasized the words "senior brother" heavily.

"Such brazen behavior—doesn't the grotto-heaven intervene? Does the master just watch?"

Zhang Jing couldn't help but show a trace of astonishment.

Previously, he only knew there was discord between the factions of the Lower Realms' Nine Domains and the Celestial Realm.

Now.

He had personally experienced it.

He realized the depth of their opposition far exceeded his previous expectations.

Judging by the situation.

The two factions were practically on the verge of direct conflict—no, they were already in conflict.

Opposite him.

"Ah—" Xuan Yuan let out a bitter laugh. "Junior brother, our master is a True Monarch, capable of roaming the boundless void with a single thought. A nap for him spans centuries—how would he pay attention to such trivial matters?"

"Moreover, although that Qing Fang from earlier appeared imposing, he was merely trying to intimidate you and probe your limits. He wouldn't dare to actually attack. Especially since you're a registered disciple of a True Monarch, unlike us who are merely registered disciples of the grotto-heaven."

"And let's be honest—we're all guilty of similar behavior."

As he spoke.

Xuan Yuan's face showed a hint of embarrassment.

Clearly, he had done similar things before.

Is that so?

Zhang Jing fell into contemplation.

It seemed he had no choice in the matter.

No matter what he did—even if he secluded himself daily and avoided worldly affairs—he would still be seen as an opponent by the Celestial Realm faction.

He would inevitably face their provocations!

"But why don't the higher-ups of the Dao Sect intervene?"

Zhang Jing wondered inwardly.

Then, in the next moment, he suddenly realized.

This state of mutual opposition and competition between the two factions might be something the Dao Sect not only tolerated but even encouraged.

The fiercer the competition.

The faster the disciples of the Dao Sect would grow.

As for whether things might go too far—

Xuan Yuan's response earlier had already provided the answer.

"Junior brother, we'll take our leave now. Take care. If you have any problems, feel free to come find us. You already know the locations of our immortal islands."

"Remember—cultivation is the foundation! The higher your cultivation, the greater your resources and privileges!"

The voices of his senior brothers rang in his ears.

"Thank you for your advice, senior brothers."

Zhang Jing said respectfully.

Before long.

Inside the simple palace.

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged.

Before him floated four treasures, each emitting a unique divine radiance.

These were the gifts his senior brothers had given him upon his entry into the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept over the Immortal-Binding Chain stained with demon blood.

Instantly, a terrifying scene of millions of demons wailing under the chain appeared before his eyes.

This immortal treasure, gifted by Senior Brother Feng Wuyu, was the most powerful treasure he had ever seen.

Yet—

A trace of gloom flashed in his eyes.

Senior Brother Feng was right—with his current cultivation, he couldn't refine it in the slightest.

Forget using it.

At present, he didn't even dare to touch the Immortal-Binding Chain.

The baleful aura coiled around it was far too intense!

As for the three treasures he had obtained today...

The nine-inch Red Thread of Fate was immediately dismissed.

His gaze went straight to the Longevity-Restoring Spring and the seed of the Three Radiance Peach Tree, his eyes brimming with anticipation.

With a flash.

Zhang Jing's figure vanished from the room.

Along with him disappeared the Longevity-Restoring Spring and the immortal root seed.

By the spirit spring.

"Master, did you summon me for something?"

Deer Thirty-Eight asked nervously.

"What have you been doing running around the immortal island these past few days?"

Zhang Jing's calm gaze fell upon the deer, causing it to shiver involuntarily.

"Um... Master, I-I was measuring the areas suitable for planting spirit herbs."

Deer Thirty-Eight stammered, then seemed to remember something. It blinked its large eyes and looked at Zhang Jing with hopeful expectation, whispering timidly:

"Master, could you... get some immortal herb seeds? My spirit herb seeds... don't seem worthy of such a good place."

"You know how to cultivate immortal herbs?"

Zhang Jing was pleasantly surprised.

"Master, ever since I came out of that painful white pool last time, I've been remembering many things, including knowledge about planting and nurturing immortal herbs."

Deer Thirty-Eight answered honestly.

Hearing this.

A light flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

This must be related to the Nine-Colored Deer bloodline that Senior Brother Feng Wuyu had mentioned.

"Thirty-Eight, do you have any knowledge about the Nine-Colored Divine Light in your memories?" Zhang Jing asked eagerly.

If it did.

He wouldn't need to spend billions of fate points to purchase it.

Moreover.

After careful consideration, Zhang Jing realized that if there were any inheritance capable of encompassing all Dao Intentions, the Nine-Colored Divine Light would undoubtedly be among them.

The Nine-Colored Deer was an innate sacred beast of the Natural Dao.

The inheritance it left behind must directly point to the Great Dao of Nature.

If he could learn it, it might allow him to evolve a Dao Seed containing the Natural Dao. No—it would likely evolve directly into an Immortal Seed.

And among Immortal Seeds, it would be exceptionally formidable.

However, the next moment.

"Master, I only have something called the Sublime Scripture of Natural Mysteries in my head. I don't know anything about the Nine-Colored Divine Light."

Deer Thirty-Eight's words were like a bucket of cold water poured over Zhang Jing's head.

Setting aside his disappointment.

"Can you recite the Sublime Scripture of Natural Mysteries for me?"

Zhang Jing asked.

Judging by its name alone, this scripture was clearly related to the Natural Dao. Though it might not compare to the Nine-Colored Divine Light, it was still an excellent choice for fusing various Dao Intentions.

Even if it didn't directly evolve into an Immortal Seed.

Fusing thirty-six perfected Dao Intentions into it would surely upgrade it to an Immortal Seed.

"Of course, Master."

Deer Thirty-Eight replied cheerfully, then closed its eyes and began recalling the contents of the Sublime Scripture of Natural Mysteries, slowly chanting it aloud.

Yet.

The deer's originally clear voice, when it reached Zhang Jing's ears, instantly turned into chaotic, sharp noise.

The dissonance gave him a splitting headache.

Helpless.

Zhang Jing had to stop it.

In the end.

After trying various methods.

Zhang Jing could only give up regretfully.

"It seems this bloodline inheritance has a secrecy mechanism. Even if Deer Thirty-Eight is willing to teach, it won't work."

A bitter smile flashed in his eyes.

In the end, there were no shortcuts to be taken!
