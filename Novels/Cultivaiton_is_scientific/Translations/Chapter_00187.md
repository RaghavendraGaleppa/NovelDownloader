# Chapter 187: Joining the Sect

"The sect won't pry into your secrets," Elder Lü said with a smile. "Sword cultivators are indeed excellent. Our sect has several sword cultivation legacies you can exchange for once you have enough contribution points. Of course, before exchanging, you should inquire and compare them with the sword cultivation technique you're currently practicing. The contribution points required for sword cultivation legacies are extremely high!"

Li Yuanba felt considerably more at ease. At least the Senluo Sect was as he had imagined—they didn't interrogate him about his past, nor did they demand he reveal secrets like his primary cultivation technique. This was the magnanimity of a major sect. He believed the Senluo Sect must possess many powerful techniques and wouldn't care much about his own.

In the future, if Li Yuanba truly integrated into the sect, he might voluntarily contribute his cultivation techniques to the sect in exchange for a large number of contribution points.

"Thank you for your guidance, Elder Lü!" Li Yuanba bowed respectfully.

"Newly joined Foundation Establishment cultivators receive five hundred contribution points. This is to give you the opportunity to switch to the sect's techniques—our sect's techniques are far superior to those of rogue cultivators. Also, here is your identity jade slip, which records your assigned location. You can go there directly. This is a robe and a top-grade offensive magical artifact. As a sword cultivator, you probably won't need it, so I'll convert it into fifty contribution points for you. And here is the token for your cave abode!" Elder Lü took out a storage bag and placed the items inside one by one, explaining each to Li Yuanba.

Li Yuanba accepted the storage bag, first changing into the black robe before bowing and stepping back. He noticed the resentful gaze of the youth again. He couldn't understand why the youth seemed to hate him even more just because he had spent a bit longer inside.

What he didn't know was that the time he had spent inside was longer than the two cultivators before him, leading the youth to believe he had likely received more resources.

He took out the cave abode token, which indicated its location. Eager to reach his new home, he ignored the youth.

The cave abode was located halfway up Chaoyun Peak. Upon arrival, he saw numerous cave abodes scattered across the mountainside. These weren't randomly developed—they followed the spiritual veins' paths. Otherwise, the cave abodes wouldn't be able to draw spiritual energy, making cultivation impossible.

Li Yuanba's cave abode was in the upper part of the mountainside, which was typically the best location among the cave abodes there. The closer to the peak, the richer the spiritual energy—even within the same grade of spiritual vein, there were subtle differences.

He used his identity jade slip to open his cave abode and inspected it. The cave abode was enormous—Foundation Establishment disciples of the North Shu's major sects were indeed treated exceptionally well. The spiritual vein here was of high grade, likely branched off from the main vein, with spiritual energy concentration nearing the peak of high-grade veins.

The cave abode was divided into a living room, cultivation chamber, training room, storage room, and study, with a spiritual spring channeled inside. He wasn't sure if every cave abode had a spiritual spring or if only a few did. If it was the latter, he owed Elder Lü a favor.

The training room spanned a hundred square meters, protected by an incredibly thick defensive array. It could easily withstand the full-force attacks of Foundation Establishment spells. While a hundred square meters wasn't particularly large, having such a space within the cave abode meant many training exercises could be conducted right there.

Li Yuanba was extremely satisfied with the cave abode—it far exceeded his expectations. He then checked his identity jade slip to see where he had been assigned.

The Outer Sect Combat Division—no surprise there. He had been assigned to a combat-focused department. Likely, the tasks he could take on in the future would all be combat-related.

From now on, he was a member of the Senluo Sect's Outer Sect Combat Division. His identity jade slip contained tasks issued by the division: three mandatory first-level tasks per year, with additional tasks taken at the cultivator's discretion. Of course, the more tasks completed, the more contribution points earned, leading to a more comfortable life within the sect.

Task grading was simple: first-level tasks involved combat with peers. For example, a task to eliminate an early Foundation Establishment cultivator was a first-level task. This grading wasn't based on the sect's standards but tailored to each disciple. Tasks like clearing out Qi Refining cultivators were rated as zero-level, with meager rewards, likely intended for Qi Refining disciples.

From the task rewards, Li Yuanba deduced the value of contribution points—roughly equivalent to a hundred spirit stones per point.

"Finally settled!" Li Yuanba sat by the spiritual energy vent in the cultivation chamber, relaxing completely.

"You're settled, but I'm still on the road!" Another voice echoed in his mind—Li Shiming's.

Li Shiming had traversed most of the Hundred Thousand Mountains in recent days. Given his speed, he shouldn't have been so slow, but the Hundred Thousand Mountains were chaotic, with ambushes and factional conflicts at every turn. To avoid trouble, he had been trying to steer clear of other cultivators.

Li Yuanba's successful entry into the Senluo Sect eased his mind—at least he now had another channel to obtain resources and knowledge from a major sect. He needed to join a major sect soon too, as only by settling down could he cultivate normally. The journey had nearly halted his progress.

Fortunately, he had broken through to Foundation Establishment before setting out, or the troubles along the way would have been far worse. He hadn't expected the Hundred Thousand Mountains of North Shu to be so complex and chaotic—any cultivator could easily get caught in conflicts.

Of course, Li Shiming hadn't been idle. IBMz15 had recorded all the jade slips from the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's study, allowing him to quickly absorb their contents. At the very least, he could now recognize many third-grade spiritual materials, unlike before when he wouldn't have known their names or properties even if he saw them.

He had also studied the basics of alchemy and artifact forging, though without a fixed cave abode, practical application was still some way off.

As he pondered, he maintained a speed that allowed him to react at any moment. Suddenly, IBMz15 alerted him to faint sounds of battle—sounds amplified and reconstructed by the AI, as his ears couldn't have detected them otherwise. IBMz15 relied on his ears for sound detection but could capture sound waves far beyond his perception range, enabling it to detect distant noises early.

"Enough already—this is the fifth time today!" Li Shiming muttered in frustration.

He descended, concealing his aura as the Nine Palaces Sword Array flew out, forming an isolation barrier around him. Within the barrier, as long as the combatants didn't deliberately scan with their spiritual senses, they wouldn't detect him.

"Senluo Sect cultivators!" Li Shiming saw the combatants—one side wore black robes with the Senluo Sect's outer sect insignia. They were two early Foundation Establishment cultivators, fighting against another early Foundation Establishment cultivator.

To Li Shiming's surprise, the lone cultivator was holding his own against two opponents without falling behind. Though the Senluo Sect cultivators were from the outer sect, their combat prowess was no joke—far superior to the rogue cultivators he had seen before. Each wielded a spiritual artifact for offense and defense, coordinating seamlessly.

Their opponent, however, attacked like a storm with a flying sword while a spiritual shield effortlessly blocked the Senluo Sect cultivators' attacks, fighting with ease.

"Xu Chuan, you dare enter our sect's territory alone? You clearly don't take the Senluo Sect seriously. You won't leave the Hundred Thousand Mountains alive!" one of the Senluo cultivators shouted, trying to unsettle Xu Chuan psychologically.

"With just you two? I could kill you if I wanted—do you really think you can stop me?" Xu Chuan retorted mid-attack.

Li Shiming found the fight intriguing. Based on Xu Chuan's current display, killing the two Senluo cultivators wouldn't be easy. Between peers, unless one had overwhelming superiority, defeating another was difficult.

What intrigued him more was Xu Chuan's identity. From the Senluo cultivators' words, Xu Chuan likely came from outside the Hundred Thousand Mountains. An idea struck him—he could check Xu Chuan's identity through Li Yuanba.

Li Yuanba retrieved his identity jade slip and accessed the Outer Sect Combat Division's task interface, searching for missions related to Xu Chuan. Sure enough, there was a second-level mission to hunt Xu Chuan down. For Li Yuanba, an early Foundation Establishment cultivator, a second-level mission implied Xu Chuan's strength was at mid-Foundation Establishment—a rating the Senluo Sect wouldn't get wrong.

Further details revealed Xu Chuan's identity: a true disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect, one of North Shu's major sects. True disciples were at least direct disciples of Core Formation elders. With such status, claiming he could kill two peers from a major sect wasn't an empty boast—though it would cost him.

The Shu Mountain Sect neighbored the Thousand Illusions Sect, and the two maintained good relations. Li Shiming's interest piqued—Xu Chuan had ventured deep into the Hundred Thousand Mountains for unknown reasons. If his mission was complete, perhaps they could leave together. The challenge was gaining Xu Chuan's trust.

As he pondered, his gaze shifted to the distance, where a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator was approaching rapidly—likely another Senluo Sect member responding to the mission. According to the task details Li Yuanba had checked, the two combatants had already updated the mission information, showcasing the advantage of a communication network spanning the human-controlled regions of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Senluo Sect cultivators never fought alone. Once information was reported, nearby sect members would converge.

Xu Chuan sensed the approaching mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator. While he could boast, actual combat relied on strength. He immediately disengaged, preparing to flee.

Just as he was about to escape, a figure suddenly lunged from the side, scattering a cloud of mist. Li Shiming was startled—he had been monitoring the battlefield yet hadn't detected this ambusher, despite being relatively close and having IBMz15's assistance.

The Senluo Sect's demonic techniques were truly insidious—this was his first real glimpse of their methods.

Xu Chuan, inexperienced in dealing with demonic cultivators, hadn't anticipated an ambush. The hidden cultivator struck at the perfect moment—just as Xu Chuan was about to flee, when his defenses were at their lowest. Escape techniques couldn't be used while activating defensive artifacts, leaving him reliant on his innate spiritual defenses.

The poison mist was tailored for Foundation Establishment cultivators, with extreme penetrative and corrosive properties against spiritual energy. By the time Xu Chuan reacted, he was already contaminated.

"Haha, looks like our combat team will make a name for itself—a Shu Mountain Sect true disciple falling to us!" the ambusher laughed.

The situation was dire for Xu Chuan. The potent poison darkened his face, and the approaching mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator spelled doom. Even against the three early-stage cultivators, he stood little chance. His trump card could take out one or two at most—killing all three was impossible. His strongest technique required preparation time, which the Senluo cultivators wouldn't grant.

"Careful—he's about to go all out!" a nearby cultivator warned.

"True disciples always have desperate measures. Let's back off and wait for the poison to take effect," the poison-user said, retreating confidently. He trusted his toxin implicitly.

Xu Chuan's heart sank. These cultivators clearly knew about true disciples' tricks. Had he known, he would have gone all out earlier to kill the two first. Being in the Hundred Thousand Mountains, he hadn't wanted to provoke the Senluo Sect excessively.

Normally, major sects avoided killing each other's true disciples across cultivation tiers, as it would trigger reciprocal retaliation, leading to mutual losses and benefiting third parties. Xu Chuan's reluctance to kill stemmed from fear of the Senluo Sect's wrath—a demonic sect might send a Core Formation elder to eliminate him on the spot.

His hesitation and playful attitude in battle had led to this predicament.

As Xu Chuan prepared to use a blood escape technique, a sword light suddenly enveloped him, carrying him away.

"Friend Xu, I'll help you escape!" Li Shiming's voice transmitted to him. Xu Chuan relaxed slightly—anything was better than falling into the Senluo Sect's hands. Besides, with his trump card, he was confident against Li Shiming one-on-one.
