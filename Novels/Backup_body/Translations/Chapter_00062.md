# Chapter 62: Admiring Scenery on the Cloud-Soaring Heavenly Ship, Li Erlang of the Jian'an Marquis Manor  

The morning sun rose gently, casting soft light across the sky.  

High above, a massive floating vessel hovered—a hundred zhang in length and thirty zhang in width, its surface covered in shimmering runes that glowed with spiritual radiance. Beneath the blue sky and white clouds, the ship appeared majestic and breathtaking, as if plucked from a painting.  

Standing atop this Cloud-Soaring Heavenly Ship, a man with his hands clasped behind his back gazed downward. His refined and youthful features, coupled with his white robes, gave him an air of transcendent grace—a true immortal’s demeanor!  

The Master of Guyue Peak!  
A living terrestrial immortal of the present age!  

"Greetings, Master!"  

The disciples bowed in unison.  

The Master of Guyue Peak swept his gaze across them, his expression serene.  

"Board the ship."  

A broad beam of light descended from the vessel. Led by Elder Chen Xuan, the disciples followed closely behind, ascending the Cloud-Soaring Heavenly Ship.  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, standing in his courtyard, looked up at the figure on the ship and thought, *So this is the Master of Guyue Peak, one of the sect leaders of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, who has dealings with the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord? If the Divine Lord is a great threat, then so is he...*  

Just as this thought crossed his mind, the Master of Guyue Peak turned his gaze downward from the sky.  

Their eyes met, sending a chill down Li Zhengjing’s spine.  

"Bring your blade and board the ship!"  

"Eh?"  

Li Zhengjing gaped, looking around in confusion before realizing the Master was indeed addressing him. His throat went dry.  

The Master of Guyue Peak turned and disappeared into the ship.  

At that moment, Elder Chen Xuan leaned over the railing and called out, "Hurry up! You're the only one left."  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing’s expression twisted in bewilderment. He glanced at the golden page’s fortune-telling before finally relaxing.  

Since the Master had spoken, refusal was not an option. With no choice, Li Zhengjing sheathed his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Blade and slung the Wutong Wooden Case onto his back. Inside the case, a still-drunk bird and tree lay unconscious. To prevent any mishaps, he locked the case before boarding the ship, though he couldn’t help feeling a mix of resignation and absurdity.  

*Just because I happened to glance at the sky, I got conscripted into this?*  

*What kind of cursed luck is this?*  

A moment later, he scoffed at himself. *For someone like me, luck is just the whim of the strong.*  

Stepping onto the deck, he marveled at its vastness. The ship’s intricate carvings and luxurious decorations made it a sight to behold—this was the legendary Cloud-Soaring Heavenly Ship of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!  

"You’re lucky," Elder Chen Xuan sneered. "The Master took a liking to you and added you to the roster last minute. Enjoy the view while you can."  

He turned away dismissively. "Since you weren’t planned for, there’s no prepared quarters for you. Find a corner to squat in."  

With that, he left, clearly intending to leave Li Zhengjing stranded on the deck.  

Watching his retreating figure, Li Zhengjing cursed inwardly. *Chen Zhu might want to bury the hatchet, but this old bastard Chen Xuan clearly hasn’t changed. The higher-ups dealt with Chen Yang but left this one alone—just to make my life difficult.*  

Suddenly, a hand clapped his shoulder from behind.  

Li Zhengjing reacted instantly, bending low and flipping the assailant over his shoulder with a twist of his wrist.  

*Boom!*  

The figure tumbled across the deck, nearly toppling over the edge if not for the railing.  

"Xie Guihai?"  

Li Zhengjing blinked in surprise. "You were chosen for this trip too? When did you break through to the Inner Qi realm?"  

Rubbing his sore back, Xie Guihai stood up. "I reached the Inner Qi realm half a month ago. Three days ago, I was notified to join this voyage and operate one of the Thirty-Six Star Wheels—the Tianying Wheel."  

He groaned. "I’ve been on this ship for three days just to learn how to control it. We rotate shifts every four hours. Someone just took over for me, and the first thing I see when I step out is you..."  

Li Zhengjing’s eyes lit up in realization. "So this ship requires thirty-six people to operate it in shifts?"  

Xie Guihai rolled his eyes. "Obviously. The Cloud-Soaring Heavenly Ship is one of the sect’s most ancient treasures. It can traverse the heavens, crossing thousands of miles in moments. Did you think it was some ordinary vessel?"  

He winced, rubbing his back. "But you—how are you so strong? I’ve only been in the Inner Qi realm for a little over ten days, barely stabilizing the first layer with a foundation of one inch and three-tenths in my dantian. That’s already considered fast progress..."  

Li Zhengjing nodded. "That *is* impressive. You’re a rare talent."  

Xie Guihai couldn’t hold back. "Just how high is your cultivation now?"  

After a pause, Li Zhengjing waved a hand. "Progress has been slow lately. Barely reached the seventh layer of Inner Qi."  

Xie Guihai fell silent. "I have things to do. Excuse me."  

Li Zhengjing grabbed his sleeve. "Wait! I don’t have a room yet. Can I bunk with you?"  

Xie Guihai shoved him off. "Don’t bother me! Get Elder Chen Xuan to arrange something for you."  

Li Zhengjing sighed. "That old bastard and I have history. He won’t lift a finger for me. Speaking of which, wasn’t he punished? Why is he still here?"  

Xie Guihai replied, "He *was* punished because of you. He’s been assigned to guard the northern Fengdu Mountain for twenty years. It’s a desolate, perilous place, crawling with evil spirits. The punishment is severe."  

Li Zhengjing mused, "So this ship is heading to Fengdu Mountain?"  

Xie Guihai nodded, then relented. "Fine. There’s an empty room next to mine. Since Elder Chen Xuan won’t arrange anything, just take it."  

Li Zhengjing grinned. "I knew you wouldn’t leave me stranded on the deck! That old bastard Chen Xuan is still sore about me killing the Venomous King Xin Xuan. He’s just—"  

"Shut up!" Xie Guihai snapped. "Everyone in the sect knows you killed Xin Xuan after he escaped a siege in Four-Leaf City. I don’t need to hear your bragging again. And for the record—I entered the sect before you. *You* should be calling *me* senior brother!"  

Li Zhengjing waved him off. "Why bother with formalities? *This* senior brother doesn’t mind..."  

A short while later, Xie Guihai locked himself in his room, vowing, *If I ever acknowledge him again, I’m a dog!*  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing settled into his new quarters, marveling at the opulence. "Even a random room is this luxurious. Truly an immortal’s vessel!"  

This unexpected boarding had its perks. While Xie Guihai and others had to take shifts operating the Thirty-Six Star Wheels, Li Zhengjing, as a last-minute addition, had no duties—just leisure.  

After resting, he awoke to dusk.  

The setting sun painted the sky in brilliant hues as the ship sailed through the clouds, the scenery below resembling a celestial paradise.  

Li Zhengjing stepped onto the deck, admiring the view as a flock of geese flew past.  

"So many birds," he remarked.  

A voice floated down from above.  

"Such plain words for such a sight. Why not compose a poem?"  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing looked up.  

On the fifth level of the ship stood the Master of Guyue Peak, his white robes fluttering as he gazed westward.  

"Greetings, Master!" Li Zhengjing bowed. "This disciple is unlearned. I have no words for such beauty."  

The Master flicked a hand, lifting Li Zhengjing effortlessly to the fifth level. "If you can’t compose one, I’ll throw you off."  

Li Zhengjing glanced down. The ship soared above the clouds, the ground invisible below. A fall from here would mean certain death.  

*Should I recite 'Rather break than bend, to keep my honor clean'?*  

"I’ve heard the second young master of Jian'an Marquis Manor is a literary prodigy, renowned across the capital. And yet, faced with this sight, all you can say is 'so many birds'?"  

The Master tilted his head slightly.  

"Li Erlang."  

*Boom!*  

The name struck Li Zhengjing like thunder, freezing him in place.
