**Chapter 131: Author's Note on Going Premium**

Tomorrow, the novel will go premium.

I guess this is my first time writing a book. The one that ended in three chapters probably doesn't count... *sweats*.

At first, a story just popped into my head, and I didn't think much about it. I just kept writing and filling in the gaps, and I've written so much. Some readers say it's a bit "watery" (padded). How should I put it? I'm a newcomer; I'm not qualified, nor would I dare to pad. I just want to write what I want to write.

Thank you everyone for your support, truly. And thanks to my editor for their care.

Normally, I have to "move bricks" (work a demanding job), so I'm quite busy. I really can't update too much, as eating is more important, after all.

I know that when it goes premium, I should update more, but a "burst update" (many chapters at once) might not be possible. I can only say I'll try to update a bit more. I hope everyone understands.

I hope everyone will continue to support me. I won't go into some commonplace issues, as they are not something I can change. I'll thank everyone in advance here and thank you for your long-term support. There are still many kind people out there.
