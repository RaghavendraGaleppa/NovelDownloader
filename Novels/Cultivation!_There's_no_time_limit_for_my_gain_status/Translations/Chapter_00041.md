# Chapter 41: The News  

"We'll talk! Ask us anything, we'll tell you everything~"  

Jiang Li was quite satisfied with the attitude of the Jinghe Twin Evils.  

Such was human nature—when you had nothing, you feared nothing, but once you gained something, you began to fear losing it.  

"Alright, let’s start with this—what’s the deal with the demonic creature emerging in the land of Yinnan Kingdom?"  

Jiang Li asked the question he most wanted answered.  

"You don’t know? Well... never mind... Actually, we don’t know the specifics either."  

"We just heard the news. A cultivator witnessed a corpse demon—a Golden Core powerhouse who once fell in this area, now transformed into a corpse demon."  

Wu Jiang was surprised by Jiang Li’s question, but with the poison afflicting his core, he no longer had the energy to dwell on trivial matters.  

"A Golden Core cultivator turned into a corpse demon?! How credible is this news?"  

"And if such a terrifying demon has emerged, why didn’t you flee? Instead, you came here to join the chaos. Don’t tell me it’s to uphold justice and slay demons."  

When Jiang Li posed these two questions, the Wu brothers grew even more frustrated.  

This guy barely knew the basics of the cultivation world—a complete novice. The infamous Jinghe Twin Evils had actually been bested by such a greenhorn. The thought alone made their heads throb.  

"The news came from the Ascension Pavilion. They have a solid reputation, and their intelligence is usually reliable."  

"They even provided evidence—seventy years ago, a Golden Core cultivator did perish here, and his body was never found."  

"As for why we came... A corpse core transformed from a Golden Core cultivator, or the treasures left behind by one—which of these wouldn’t drive us cultivators mad with greed?"  

As the old saying goes, men die for wealth as birds die for food, and cats and dogs lose their balls for a meal.  

The allure of a Golden Core cultivator’s legacy was something even high-level Golden Core experts couldn’t resist, let alone small fry like them.  

The odds were slim, but what if they were the ones to stumble upon the treasure? That was the mindset of nearly everyone who had come.  

Even Jiang Li couldn’t help but feel tempted upon hearing the news.  

"It seems this news has spread far and wide. How many cultivators have arrived so far? Where are they gathering? Which sects have come, and where are they stationed?..."  

Jiang Li fired off a barrage of questions before pulling out a panoramic map of Yinnan Kingdom, a royal treasure, and had the two mark locations as they spoke.  

Transforming into a corpse demon was no easy feat, let alone turning a Golden Core cultivator into one. That was why these cultivators were scouring graveyards and places of yin energy.  

---  

If not for the convergence of time and place, how could a perfectly intact Golden Core cultivator suddenly transform into a corpse demon?  

"Wait a minute... If that’s the case, then the most suspicious location would be..."  

Jiang Li glanced at the map. Sure enough, while the cultivators were scattered, most were distributed along the Mazu River, which ran through Yinnan Kingdom.  

"You guessed right. The most likely lair of the corpse demon is in this Mazu River."  

Wu Jiang’s eyes flickered briefly, but in the end, he didn’t hold back and told Jiang Li everything.  

He figured that since he didn’t know much anyway, sharing this information might lure Jiang Li into danger—possibly even avenging them in the process.  

"Moreover, a cultivator skilled in geomancy calculated that once a corpse falls into the Mazu River and is swept away by the current, its final resting place wouldn’t be too far—somewhere within this stretch of water."  

"Most of the cultivators are gathered there now. Sect disciples have claimed large sections of the river to search, while rogue cultivators can only scavenge in the gaps between them."  

"I’ve told you everything. Since you’re a sect disciple, you can try your luck there if you want."  

Jiang Li glanced at the map and saw the name "Hidden Scripture Valley" marked over the four largest and most favorable sections of the river.  

"Good. You’ve been honest. Honest men deserve rewards—you’re free to go now."  

Wu Jiang and Wu He’s faces lit up with joy—only to feel a sharp pain in their necks as they were both knocked unconscious.  

"I got the information out of them, but this contract is really troublesome. I can’t just kill them outright."  

"But letting them off so easily is too lenient."  

These two had tried to kill him earlier, and with his petty nature, simply letting them go would leave him feeling unsettled.  

After some thought, Jiang Li had his Black Zombie carefully drain the Jinghe Twin Evils of most of their blood before force-feeding each of them two ruined pills.  

With a total of five ruined pills ingested, the accumulated pill poison was terrifying—enough to suppress their cultivation to the absolute lowest level for nearly a century.  

The poison would even slowly corrode their spiritual roots and lifespan, causing permanent damage.  

For the next hundred years, they’d be reduced to invalids weaker than ordinary people.  

Given the short lifespans of Qi Refining cultivators, it was uncertain whether they’d even survive that long.  

Only then did Jiang Li nod in satisfaction. Checking the time, he draped himself and his zombie in black robes once more before heading toward an unnamed estate in the capital’s bustling district.  

---  

Earlier, they had deliberately mentioned "regrouping at the palace" as a diversion.  

Their actual meeting point was this unnamed estate.  

As the saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side. The current queen of Yinnan Kingdom was notoriously domineering, forbidding the king from indulging in beauties and neglecting state affairs.  

Yet the king was a lecherous man—even a harem of over a dozen concubines wasn’t enough. He secretly dug a tunnel to this estate, establishing a hidden pleasure palace outside the palace.  

This conveniently allowed Jiang Li and the others to carry out their covert operations.  

When Jiang Li returned, the other three hadn’t arrived yet. He didn’t know whether they were still gathering information or had already fallen to rogue cultivators’ ambushes.  

Inside the estate, the other four companions had already relocated and were hiding in a room, anxiously waiting.  

Jiang Li stationed his zombie in a corner as a lookout before returning to report his safe arrival.  

Soon, two hours passed, and the Black Zombie’s nose caught the faint scent of blood.  

The other three, badly injured, staggered back, supporting each other.  

They looked utterly disheveled, but with no pursuers behind them, everyone in the room breathed a sigh of relief.  

However, when the three saw Jiang Li sitting leisurely in the room, munching on fruit, their faces filled with shock.  

Like Jiang Li, they had been ambushed by rogue cultivators. If not for Yu Banxia’s family heirlooms and his timely rescue of the other two, they would have lost two members right then.  

But Jiang Li had been alone. Yet not only had he broken through the ambush unscathed, he had returned here safely—without a single injury.
