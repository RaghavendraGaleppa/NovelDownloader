# Chapter 2: Tu Mama's Scheme

Outside the bridal tent sat two women.

One was the bride's dowry attendant, Tu Mama, a withered old woman with a gaunt figure and a dry appearance.

The other was Suo Chanzhi's personal servant girl, Little Qingmei, whose face was full of youthful vitality.

The old woman and the young girl sat side by side at the tent entrance. Little Qingmei had a sword resting across her knees, while Tu Mama's hands were empty.

This bridal tent was pitched atop the highest point of the gobi plateau, overlooking the entire camp.

In the distance, a few wild camels still grazed along the horizon.

Down the slope, the bonfire cast flickering shadows across the gobi desert, resembling an ancient sheepskin painting.

Those people were拼凑棺材 (assembling a coffin) from wooden planks. The faint, clattering sounds of hammering drifted over, making the night seem even more serene.

Little Qingmei's eyes sparkled with a lively, naive charm.

She sat cross-legged on the ground, supporting herself neither with her hands nor moving her legs; she simply shuffled her bottom closer to Tu Mama. "Ahem! Mama Tu, is our young mistress really just going to... sleep with some random man like this?"

Tu Mama replied calmly, "What else should be done? Do you want your young mistress to bear the empty title of the Yu family's eldest daughter-in-law, with no way to ever rise in status?"

"Of course I don't want that, but... this sort of thing... will it work?"

"Why wouldn't it? Only you, I, and Yang Can know that the Young Master of the Yu family hasn't consummated the marriage with Miss Chanzhi. As long as you don't speak, I don't speak, and Yang Can doesn't speak, then once Miss Chanzhi becomes pregnant... that child will naturally be the eldest grandson of the Yu family's main line."

Qingmei asked worriedly, "But what if the Young Mistress gives birth to a girl?"

Tu Mama said coldly, "We don't have the luxury to worry about that now. Let's just get her pregnant first. Once she has a child, we will have ten months. Ten months is enough time to do a lot of things. If she really ends up giving birth to a girl, we'll have the chance to 'swap the dragon for the phoenix' again."

Little Qingmei frowned. "But that Yang guy is the Young Master's guest advisor. Will he agree?"

Tu Mama said disdainfully, "If he doesn't agree, he dies immediately. If he agrees, even if he doesn't believe our promises, at least before he dies, he gets to enjoy a beauty. And after he dies, his descendants have a chance to rise to prominence. Tell me, will he agree or not?"

Little Qingmei thought it over seriously, but before she could come to a conclusion, she heard the "answer."

The answer came from inside the bridal tent—it was a sharp cry.

"Ehh~~~"

It was a mix of shock and fear, like a flower-picking maiden suddenly pricked by a thorny branch, a cry of pain hidden within the exclamation.

In the distance, a few wild camels still wandered under the moonlight.

The flickering bonfire cast shadows upon the gobi.

The clattering sounds of assembling the coffin came and went faintly.

The scene was so uncanny, yet from inside the tent, moans that could no longer be suppressed began to drift out—seemingly painful, seemingly helpless, twisting and turning in a thousand ways.

An old woman and a young girl sat right outside the tent, listening quietly.

When the soft singing began, Little Qingmei's ears would unconsciously perk up.

When the "silver bottle suddenly shattered" (a metaphor for a sudden, sharp sound), Little Qingmei's body would tremble violently in fright.

Gradually, her face grew redder and hotter, hot enough to fry a pancake on.

Although she was still a young girl who had never experienced intimacy, she was Suo Chanzhi's dowry maid. Before the wedding, she had accompanied her young mistress to look at the "bottom of the chest"—the erotic图册 (illustrated books) used to educate brides of this era.

At this moment, those confusing images from the books seemed to come alive, darting around in Little Qingmei's mind, turning her thoughts into a mess.

The sounds coming from the tent seemed to be the sound effects for these moving images, perfectly matching every "action."

Little Qingmei began to fidget, as if ants were crawling all over her body.

Suddenly, she weakly scrambled to her feet, her face red as she said coyly, "Mama Tu, I... I'm going to find some water to drink."

Little Qingmei ran off with her sword, but despite her haste, she unconsciously squeezed her thighs together, walking with her toes turned inward.

Tu Mama remained seated, her wrinkled face full of disdain. *Little girl, can't even handle this? Tch!*

Tu Mama had been sold into the Suo family at the age of twelve. She had worked her way up from a menial servant to a junior maid, then to a senior maid, a mama, and finally a steward mama, a journey that took thirty-nine years.

Now over fifty, she had lived her entire life without a man, never having married.

When she was young, listening to the mamas and senior maids gossip about the fun之事 (affairs) between masters in the bedroom, she would blush. In the dead of night, she would even yearn for the things she heard.

But at some point, Tu Mama began to find the romantic affairs between men and women boring, and even felt instinctively disgusted by them.

Now, the only pursuit in her life was power.

However, within the inner chambers, her path had come to an end; there was no higher position to climb to. So, she set her sights on the position of Outer Affairs Steward.

In the households of ordinary wealthy gentry, a steward is just a manager or butler, differing only in title. But in great clans and aristocratic families, "Steward" and "Manager" are completely different positions.

There are Eight Great Clans in Longshang, each ruling over their own territory. The Outer Affairs Steward of these clans acts as the "feudal lord" who manages the territory for the clan head, overseeing all matters of the local gentry, merchants, and various industries.

Such an Outer Affairs Steward wields power and status comparable to, or even exceeding, that of a military commissioner in the Central Plains Empire. Because management in the Longshang region is rough, their authority is even greater than that of imperial ministers.

An Outer Affairs Steward is a vassal of the clan, whereas Tu Mama, even as a Steward Mama, is merely a domestic slave. One word difference, but a world apart.

What Tu Mama wanted now was to cross this class divide and become a vassal of the Suo clan of Jincheng.

Therefore, she competed for the duty of accompanying the bride as a mama to the Yu family.

"Hehe, that girl Chanzhi is really easy to fool," Tu Mama thought smugly. "I just spun a tale and scared her into submission. But I suppose it's not really a lie. After all, if this succeeds, it will indeed be of great benefit to her and her branch. It's just that the greatest benefit will go to me, Tu Mama..."

Thinking of this, Tu Mama revealed a pleasant smile.

In this world, the Central Plains is divided by the Shichuan River: the south is the Chen Empire, the north is the Mu Empire, and the two empires rule the world.

Meanwhile, the Longshang region is governed autonomously by the Eight Great Clans.

The strongest of the Eight Great Clans are the Suo, Yuan, and Murong clans, known as the Upper Three Clans.

The weaker ones are the Yuwen, Li, Dugu, Zhao, and Yu clans, known as the Lower Five Clans.

The Upper Three Clans are now restless; they all wish to unify the Eight Clans, establish a new dynasty, and stand on equal footing with the two Central Plains empires.

At this time, the Tianshui Yu Clan became exceptionally important.

Although the Tianshui Yu Clan ranked last among the Eight Clans, the territory they occupied was known as the "Granary of Longyou."

Therefore, when the Yu family proposed a marriage alliance to the Suo family, the Suo family agreed readily.

When a wealthy family marries off a daughter, the dowry inevitably includes a Steward Mama. Because the bride will eventually manage the "inner affairs" of her husband's family, having a Steward Mama to assist her allows her to master the management of servants, finances, rituals, and social affairs more quickly.

However, the true mission of the Steward Mama sent by the Suo family was to control the Yu family's main line through Suo Chanzhi, the young mistress of the main branch, and thereby control the Yu family, ultimately bringing the "Granary of Longyou" under the control of the Suo clan.

This process might take a long time, but for the grand undertaking of conquering a state, which might take generations to complete, it was not long at all.

However, Yu Chengye's death disrupted the Suo family's plans, and Tu Mama's dream of using this achievement to advance to an Outer Affairs Steward was shattered.

Fortunately, in her haste, she came up with the "life-saving" strategy of borrowing a seed, and successfully persuaded Suo Chanzhi.

Once this plan succeeds, the Suo family's scheme can continue, and she, who holds the secret of Suo Chanzhi...

Listening to the "painful" moans coming from the tent, Tu Mama's smile became even more pleasant.
