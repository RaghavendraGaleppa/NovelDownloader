# Chapter 64: The Wicked Escapee and His Dismantling

The sound of thunder echoed, possessing a natural power to intimidate these mortal "clay figures."

For a moment, birds and beasts scattered in panic, and wild deer fled in all directions.

The guards felt the thunderous sound enter their bodies through their ears, reverberating back and forth in their chests. Their hearts felt as if they were being squeezed by a giant hand.

It was like a three-year-old child encountering a ferocious tiger; upon hearing the beast's roar, the body would instinctively tremble. This was not cowardice, but a kind of "suppression."

The Immortal in the Jar had held back this move for so long because such a sound would deplete his vital qi and expose his position more quickly. However, at this moment, he had been pushed into a corner by Li Xian and had no choice but to take a desperate gamble.

"Ha!"

His momentum reached its peak, and he let out a great shout.

One of the more timid guards trembled all over, losing control of his bowels. His hands went slack, causing the iron net to loosen slightly.

"Excellent!"

Seizing the opportunity, the Immortal in the Jar broke free from the net. He gave Li Xian a ferocious grin and pounced, his hands transforming into claws, aiming to capture him.

Li Xian felt the oppressive aura. He had already known that the villain's escape was inevitable, and once free, his first priority would be to capture and kill him. Thus, he had already moved to a favorable position. Turning his body, he darted into a narrow crevice in the mountain rock.

The Immortal in the Jar was short in stature and could naturally fit into the stone crevice as well. However, Li Xian had already aimed his bow outward. In such a confined space, no one could dodge. If the Immortal in the Jar wanted to kill Li Xian, he would have to take nine arrows.

"Good kid!"

"Cunning as a fox, and still you evade death!"

The Immortal in the Jar was furious. This小子's martial arts were mediocre, yet he was so troublesome; it was truly unexpected.

"Get out here!"

The Immortal in the Jar pointed at Li Xian, glaring as he shouted.

With nine sharp arrows aimed outward, Li Xian calmly replied, "No."

"You won't come out, is that it? You won't come out?"

The Immortal in the Jar stamped his foot in frustration. Suddenly, he leaped up and grabbed another archer, lifting him like a small chick and using him as a shield in front of himself.

"This guy is actually quite clever," Li Xian thought, his brow furrowing. He relaxed his fingers, and a flying arrow shot out, passing through the crevice and hitting a bird hundreds of feet away.

"You can come in if you like."

"But no matter what shield you have in front of you, I will definitely shoot you twice in the knees," Li Xian stated calmly.

Given the Immortal in the Jar's strength, if he entered the crevice, killing Li Xian would be a sure thing. Li Xian had already made up his mind.

Hearing this, the Immortal in the Jar's steps faltered, and he indeed grew fearful. He had already experienced the kid's accuracy firsthand. Even with a living shield, it wasn't guaranteed he could block everything completely. If his legs were injured and his speed compromised, things would become extremely troublesome.

"I'm so angry, I'm so angry!"

"I'll spare your life for now, but..."

"Heh heh, you won't be so lucky next time."

The Immortal in the Jar patted the shoulder of another archer, then reached out, twisted the man's wrist, lifted, and pulled. The hand was torn right off, still attached to skin and flesh.

The archer screamed in agony. Annoyed by the noise, the Immortal in the Jar pinched the man's chin, then pulled. He ripped the jaw right off. The skin tore, revealing the flesh as blood dripped down.

He dismantled the man like a puppet, but it was far more bloody... The bones remained intact, but the flesh, skin, tendons, and blood vessels were all torn apart.

"Heh heh, fun, fun."

The Immortal in the Jar plunged his hands into the man's back and pulled down hard. With a tearing sound, the entire piece of flesh and skin was peeled off like tree bark.

"Ugh..."

The guard was no longer recognizable.

Li Xian felt a chill run down his spine. He had never witnessed such a gruesome sight before, and his stomach churned. However, he had to maintain a calm exterior, because he knew the man's true target was him. If he showed the slightest hint of fear, his own fate would be just as tragic.

The Immortal in the Jar continued to dismantle his victim—left, right, arms, shoulders, thighs... all were torn off and scattered on the ground. Yet, the guard was still breathing.

"Heh heh, the broth is best when it's fresh."

He tossed the mangled remains into the stone jar.

Just then...

"Wicked, cunning villain, where do you think you're going?!"

Li Haitang and the others arrived fashionably late.

"Goodbye, you little kids. You think you can catch me?"

"Try again in ten years!"

"Never see me again."

The Immortal in the Jar slung the stone jar over his back and used his lightness technique to depart.

"Dammit!"

Yang Huayu, furious, punched the mountain, sending shards of rock flying.

"You useless lot! You couldn't even stop that vicious criminal!"

"The plan was flawless. It's all your fault for letting that villain escape!"

Yang Huayu cursed them.

Li Xian thought to himself, "The ambush was set long ago; you were the ones who arrived too late." However, he didn't argue. Today, he had indeed broadened his horizons and understood the gap between them. In the presence of such a powerful expert, "clay figures" were no different from toys, to be toyed with at will.

"That guy's Iron Tablet Fist has grown even stronger," Li Haitang sighed. "This mission has failed. We've let a tiger escape back to the mountains. We'll have to plan all over again."

Li Xian emerged from the crevice in the rock.

He saw the ground covered in blood and filth... The horror of what had just happened was still vivid in his mind.

"I always knew the Jianghu was a dangerous place."

"But knowing it is one thing; experiencing it firsthand is another!"

Eating people? Even that seemed merciful compared to this.

***

In Qingning County.

Having failed to capture the Immortal in the Jar, the group gathered again in the city. The guards were all numb and speechless, clearly deeply shaken by the ordeal.

"Nineteen..."

Li Xian silently counted the numbers. Of the thirty who had set out, only nineteen remained. Eleven were dead.

The team led by Li Xian had only lost one man. The other teams had each lost five, exactly half their numbers.

"When that man attacked, Liu Quan organized a defense, but our formation was broken in an instant."

"He wasn't in a hurry to kill us. He said he wanted to play a game: we would pair up and play rock-paper-scissors. The winner would live, the loser would die."

"Liu Quan played against me. He lost, and then... he was dismantled like a doll, and finally thrown into the stone jar."

"It was the same... After our formation was broken, we were all toyed with cruelly. The villain only left when he got bored."

"Master Li, why did so few of your team die?"

The others spoke, their hearts still filled with terror.

Li Xian's brow furrowed. From their words, he could deduce that the heavy losses were mostly Li Haitang's fault. She had severely misjudged and underestimated the Immortal in the Jar.

In a head-on confrontation, the Immortal in the Jar might indeed be no match for her and the others. But when it came to escaping, he was clearly in his element. To put it bluntly, Li Haitang and her group did not possess the ability to capture the Immortal in the Jar. Being able to fight him was one thing; being able to kill or capture him was another.

This was why the Immortal in the Jar, during his escape, could take his time to toy with his victims. He was confident that even if Li Haitang caught up, he could escape again. And the facts proved it. The Immortal in the Jar had indeed escaped right before their eyes.

He wondered if Madam Li had seen this outcome in advance, or if she simply didn't care about the result. Perhaps this entire affair was just a favor to Li Bohou.

"Master Li?"

A few guards pressed for details.

Li Xian snapped back to reality and recounted the details of the incident: how they had trapped the villain, how they had fought him, how they had reached a stalemate, and finally how he had escaped and how Li Xian had managed to save his own life.

The sheer danger of the situation kept his listeners on the edge of their seats. They couldn't help but feel a newfound respect for him. As for Master Li's martial arts, that was secondary. It was his calm and composure in the face of a crisis that was most admirable.
