# Chapter 12: Immortal's Stay  

The scene remained undisturbed. The male cultivator was startled when he saw the deep pit.  

Judging by the pit and its surroundings, the power of this strike was astonishing—far exceeding that of an ordinary late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.  

In a flash, he appeared beside the pit. With a light pat on his storage pouch, a jade ruler materialized in his hand.  

He tapped the ruler lightly around the pit, but it showed no reaction. His brows furrowed in confusion.  

"Senior Brother Zhao, have you found anything?" the female cultivator asked.  

"Strange. There's no trace of spiritual energy left by this attack," Zhao replied uncertainly, examining the jade ruler.  

Although powerful martial artists existed in the mortal world, unless they reached the Xiantian realm, they were nothing more than trivial annoyances to cultivators.  

Even Xiantian martial artists could only pose a threat to Qi Refining cultivators through ambushes, catching them off guard.  

But once a Qi Refining cultivator was prepared and maintained distance, a Xiantian martial artist could do them no harm.  

"Could it have been a Xiantian martial artist?" the female cultivator suggested.  

"No," Zhao replied firmly. "The power of this strike is immense, but it's scattered and unfocused. Definitely not the work of a Xiantian martial artist."  

Xiantian martial artists were dangerous precisely because they could concentrate their Xiantian energy into a single point, piercing through a cultivator's defenses.  

This level of control over Xiantian energy was a hallmark of their mastery. Martial artists, after all, couldn't afford to waste their limited Xiantian energy.  

If a Xiantian martial artist had unleashed such an attack, their reserves of Xiantian energy would have to be terrifyingly vast—something Zhao had never heard of before.  

The strike's power surpassed that of late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, and its form suggested a cultivator's handiwork.  

Yet, whether it was a high-powered talisman or a formidable spell, Zhao's jade ruler should have detected residual spiritual energy, even days later.  

After meticulously recording the scene—necessary for mission documentation—Zhao turned to Magistrate Li.  

"Magistrate Li, arrange accommodations for us. We'll be staying in Nanling City for a while. Preferably near this location, as I'll need to return for further investigation."

Originally, this mission had seemed simple: deal with a rogue cultivator causing trouble in the mortal world. Such troublemakers were usually weak.  

The mortal realm lacked spiritual energy, and most cultivators avoided it unless they had pressing business.  

Zhao and his junior sister, both mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators, had taken the mission, only to find the rogue cultivator already dead.  

Now, their task had shifted to investigating the incident and identifying the killer.  

The evidence Zhao had gathered wouldn't suffice for a mission report. Even he wouldn't believe his own findings if he hadn't seen the scene firsthand.  

"My residence has two guest courtyards. If you don't mind, you may stay there," Li Wenyuan offered with a smile.  

"Good," Zhao replied bluntly, nodding.  

Once the two cultivators were escorted away, Li Wenyuan finally exhaled in relief.  

"Father, why did cultivators come? Were they sent from the capital?" Li Shiming asked curiously.  

"They carried an imperial decree, but the capital hasn't sent any official documents," Li Wenyuan replied softly.  

The Great Xia Dynasty's governance was meticulous. Normally, envoys from the capital would bring both credentials and official paperwork.  

But since the two were cultivators and their imperial decree was genuine, Li Wenyuan had no choice but to host them. He had already sent an inquiry to the capital.  

"They likely mean no harm," Li Shiming reassured him.  

Though the cultivators were haughty, they were at least polite—unlike the rogue cultivator who had massacred thirty-five people.  

Li Shiming felt a pang of frustration. The helplessness of facing such overwhelming power only deepened his desire for strength.  

---  

Zhao and his junior sister, Zheng, settled into the adjacent guest courtyards.  

"Junior Sister Zheng, the cultivator we're investigating is stronger than us. We must stick together during our stay," Zhao said gravely.  

"Understood, Senior Brother Zhao," Zheng replied with a light smile.  

Zhao produced a compass-like array disk. Channeling spiritual energy, he activated it, and a white glow spread out, covering both courtyards.  

Though not cultivation partners, cultivators maintained distance for safety, even when on good terms.  

Cultivation required deep concentration, leaving practitioners vulnerable. No cultivator would willingly expose themselves in such a state.  

Since Zhao was stronger and wealthier, he took the initiative to set up a defensive array for both courtyards.  

In her room, Zheng took out a talisman and activated it with spiritual energy. A red light settled over the doors and windows, forming a warning mechanism against intruders.  

Unlike Zhao, Zheng had fewer resources. Under his protection, she saved where she could—except in cultivation.  

Most of her wealth went toward advancing her cultivation. She retrieved a circular disk and placed four spirit stones within it.  

As she channeled spiritual energy, the disk activated, its intricate patterns glowing. Zheng sat atop it, basking in the enriched spiritual energy with satisfaction.  

Unlike peers who focused on combat prowess, she had invested in this Spirit Gathering Disk to accelerate her cultivation and stand out.  

Meanwhile, Zhao sighed as he assessed the thin spiritual energy in his room. He reluctantly took out a spirit stone.  

"Let's find the clues quickly and return. The cultivation environment here is terrible," he muttered.  

The next day, Zhao and Zheng combed through Nanling City but found no traces of cultivator activity. They decided to stay one more day before giving up.
