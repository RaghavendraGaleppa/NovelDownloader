# Chapter 44: Beneath the Waterfall

"Hahaha, who cares if it's an immortal's palace? With spiritual light soaring to the heavens, there must be a treasure appearing. I intend to go there myself," Mang Biao laughed heartily.

"Island Master, I'll go with you. As for the other brothers, they should stay here and continue building the palace. If their cultivation is too low, they won't be able to help there, and might even suffer casualties if danger arises," Tang Long mused.

"No!" Mang Biao subtly glanced at Yang Ji and transmitted his voice, "You stay. Among all the brothers, you're the most astute. You'll stay on the island and keep an eye on the Second Island Master for me."

"I want to go!" Yang Ji suddenly looked up, his eyes filled with determination.

"You want to go?" Mang Biao was startled, then chuckled, "Little brother, why don't you stay? Your cultivation is still a bit low, and the situation there hasn't been ascertained yet. If we rashly go and encounter danger, it'll be troublesome. Fortuitous encounters aren't that easy to obtain. Just rest assured and stay on the island. If I get any treasures, you'll definitely get a share."

"No, I want to go this time!" Yang Ji's gaze was firm as he stated unequivocally, his tone uncharacteristically strong.

With his unique ability that sees through everything, he wasn't afraid of known dangers. The Humanoid Weapon was too important. If the second scroll was beneath the suddenly appearing undersea waterfall, he had to try for it, no matter what.

Mang Biao had never seen Yang Ji look so serious before. His eyes flickered slightly, and inwardly he was reluctant. *If you go and something happens, what will I do? I'm still counting on you for treatment.*

He let out a dry laugh, trying to persuade him gently, "Little brother, please don't go. Don't you believe in your elder brother's strength? Whatever treasure you want, I'll bring it back for you."

"If you don't let me go, then you can forget about me ever helping you with your treatment," Yang Ji looked up, his gaze calm as he spoke.

It was this calm, indifferent look that made Mang Biao's hair stand on end.

"Go, go, go!" Mang Biao's heart jumped, and he nodded repeatedly. "But little brother must stay by my side, that way I can protect you."

"Mn." Yang Ji let out a breath and nodded. That would be for the best.

"Island Master, then what about me?" Tang Long looked at Yang Ji.

"Then you come with me too. Also, call three other Foundation Establishment brothers. We'll depart immediately." Mang Biao was swift and decisive; in truth, he was worried that others would beat them to it and take all the treasures.

Tang Long acknowledged, then immediately called three Foundation Establishment Hall Masters.

Seeing everyone assembled, Mang Biao instantly grabbed Yang Ji and shot into the sky. The group of six flew rapidly towards Wangmo Island. After flying for a day and a night, they finally saw Wangmo Island on the morning of the second day.

From afar, they could also see the magnificent sea-surface waterfall formed by the towering uplifted underground rock layers. It was hard to believe that such a spectacular sight, a waterfall cascading thousands of feet, could be seen in the deep sea.

Yang Ji and the others observed clearly from the sky. The towering cliffs on either side of the waterfall were three thousand *zhang* wide, and the abyss-like裂缝 rift was ten thousand *zhang* long. Waves of spiritual light surged from within, illuminating the entire vicinity of Wangmo Island in a pristine, sacred white. The surrounding seawater poured down along with the spiritual light, seemingly obstructed by a powerful force, churning up endless white foam.

Above the waterfall, numerous figures floated in mid-air, dense like locusts. It was estimated that almost half of the cultivators from the Demonic Scent Sea had gathered here.

"Zen Guan of Luoyun Island, Qing Yuan of Qingfeng Island, Liu Duanqing of Lihate Island—these fellows are all still here. Good thing we made it in time." Seeing this, Mang Biao patted his chest in relief, as if the treasure had been secured. At the same time, a slight doubt arose in his mind: several days had passed, so why hadn't everyone started moving yet? Were they still observing?

Seeing this, Mang Biao led Yang Ji and flew towards an old Daoist in a purple Daoist robe. The old Daoist held a whisk in one hand and stroked his white beard with the other, appearing benevolent, with a gentle smile, truly like an enlightened master.

"Old Daoist Zen Guan, what's the situation now? Why aren't any of you moving yet?" Mang Biao asked boisterously.

"Oh, if it isn't Fellow Daoist Mang." The old Daoist smiled amiably upon hearing this, pointing to the waterfall below. "Spiritual light surges to the heavens down there, accompanied by a mysterious twisting force. No one can fly down."

"Even those three over there can't fly down?" Mang Biao subtly gestured forward with his chin.

"No, they can't either!" Zen Guan shook his head.

Yang Ji followed their gaze and saw three cultivators radiating spiritual energy and immense majesty. The middle-aged cultivator on the left was burly, with half his body exposed in bulging muscles and the other half covered in battle armor, wreathed in yellow light, exuding an undeniable dominance. The old man on the right had fiery red hair and wore a red robe, his eyes like flames, his demeanor exceedingly majestic. A cluster of blazing fire constantly burned beneath his feet, like a perpetual star, continuously emitting scorching heat.

As for the old man in the middle, he appeared much more ordinary, in a simple white robe with an unremarkable appearance, yet between his brows lay a sharp, keen aura. Yang Ji merely looked for a few moments, but the oppressive aura of their superior status and absolute power made his breathing hitch. They were too strong; their mere presence was enough to send shivers down one's spine. These three were undoubtedly Nascent Soul True Monarchs.

Noticing Yang Ji's slightly reserved gaze, Mang Biao chuckled softly, "The one on the left is True Monarch Nan Kui of Nanyuan Sect, the one on the right is True Monarch Chi Huo of Changqing Sect, and the one in the middle is True Monarch Ling Gu of Canglan Sect. These three True Monarchs separately guard the three largest islands in the Demonic Scent Sea. I didn't expect all of them to come."

"Furthermore, many experts from the Seven Gangs and Eighteen Societies have also arrived. Later, when we go down, you must stick close to me." Following Mang Biao's gaze, Yang Ji also saw many powerful Golden Core Perfected Ones in the sky and nodded immediately.

"The spiritual light is fading," Yang Ji pointed at the waterfall, noticing that the stirred white foam was diminishing and the spiritual light was rapidly contracting.

"Now!" The three Nascent Soul True Monarchs suddenly shouted and immediately transformed into streaks of light, following the receding spiritual light, hoping to use it as a guide to find the treasure.

"Hahaha, let's go!" With the Nascent Soul True Monarchs leading the way, dozens of Golden Core Perfected Ones instantly transformed into streaks of light and followed.

"Fellow Daoist Mang, let's go too." Zen Guan smiled, flicked his whisk, and flew down towards the waterfall.

"Little brother Yang, let's go!" Mang Biao took Yang Ji, enveloped in a surging rush, and plunged into the waterfall.

Their speed was extremely fast. They descended five thousand *zhang* straight down the rift. Various pieces of information flashed rapidly in Yang Ji's eyes. Just as he caught sight of "partially destroyed spatial restrictions due to an earthquake," he heard a soft 'pop,' and Mang Biao had already taken him through the restrictions, breaking inside. The scene before their eyes twisted for a moment, and once it stopped spinning, everyone had arrived in an underground world.

At first glance, the sight presented was quite fantastical. One might have expected an underground world to be dark and musty, but what they saw was an expanse of light. Luminous blue grasses covered the ground, various colorful giant mushrooms were tall enough to reach three people high, and jellyfish-like, flickering unknown insects filled the long sky. All kinds of low-lying vegetation were gnarled and robust, appearing like ancient trees that had lived for tens of thousands of years.

This scene before them was as if they had arrived in a fantasy wonderland, astonishing to behold.
