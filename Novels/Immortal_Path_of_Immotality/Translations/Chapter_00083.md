# Chapter 83: Too Naive

Lin Shan looked at the red-faced monk with surprise, utterly baffled as to how this guy had managed to track him down.

It was somewhat understandable that Princess Guo and her group knew he was returning to Yichuan and had set up an ambush along the route. But this red-faced monk had no prior connection to him—how had he managed to locate Lin Shan in the vast Yan-Yun Mountain Range?

"Tsk tsk tsk, such a fine dual cultivation furnace, and you've wasted it like this! What a shame!" The red-faced monk stared at the fallen Princess of Great Yan, shaking his head in regret. He lamented Lin Shan's lack of appreciation for beauty, squandering such a fine appearance and cultivation base. If only the princess had been given to him...

"Humph! The Princess of Great Yan was a late-stage Qi Refining demonic cultivator. If you tried dual cultivation with her, you'd probably end up drained to death!" Seeing the hostility in the monk's approach, Lin Shan had no intention of being polite and sneered in response.

To his surprise, the monk seemed offended by Lin Shan's doubt in his professional skills and roared, "What do you know, brat? When it comes to dual cultivation, our Joyous Sect are the true masters. The demonic absorption techniques are nothing in our eyes!"

Hearing the name "Joyous Sect," Lin Shan seized the opportunity to ask, "Joyous Sect? What's its relation to the Joyous Sect that was exterminated centuries ago? Did you come after me because of that Joyous Buddha statue?"

"Exactly!" The red-faced monk's expression turned devout. "The Joyous Sect and the former Joyous Sect are one and the same—both were founded by devotees of the Joyous Buddha. The statue in your possession is a sacred relic of our sect."

Lin Shan pulled out the statue from his storage pouch, inspecting it again on his enhancement panel. After confirming there were no hidden divine abilities or spells—just an ordinary vessel for collecting faith—he couldn't help but scoff.

"This? A sacred relic?"

The red-faced monk's face darkened with anger at Lin Shan's dismissive tone. "You insolent brat! Hand over the relic! As long as you hold it, every follower of our sect can sense your location. You'll be plagued by endless trouble and misfortune—"

Before he could finish, the statue was tossed across the stream, landing right in his hands.

The monk stared at Lin Shan in disbelief. Had the kid just surrendered without even hearing the full threat? He examined the statue—it was indeed the real thing—and confirmed that Lin Shan no longer carried its mark.

"You... you're just giving it to me?" The monk stammered, pointing at Lin Shan as if he couldn't believe his luck.

Lin Shan wore an odd expression. "What, should I keep it for the New Year?" 

Having already absorbed the statue's ancient essence, it held no further value to him. And now that he knew it acted as a beacon for the Joyous Sect, keeping it was out of the question. Even if the monk hadn't demanded it, he would have tossed it into some remote corner.

The monk still seemed suspicious. "You spent 1,600 spirit stones on this—now you're just giving it up?"

At this, Lin Shan's face twisted in irritation. "1,625 spirit stones! If you hadn't interfered, I could've gotten it for 1,400! You cost me over 200 stones!" The thought stung—his monthly salary at the auction house was only 100 spirit stones. Two months' worth, gone in an instant.

The monk, unwilling to back down, pointed his staff at Lin Shan. "You dare complain? You and the auctioneer colluded in shady dealings! Shameless!"

The two hurled insults across the stream, their tempers flaring. 

Lin Shan, now armed with late-stage Qi Refining equipment and brimming with confidence, saw no reason to back down. The monk, equally stubborn, refused to be cowed. Their argument escalated until they finally clashed in battle.

Lin Shan wielded his mid-grade flying sword, trading ranged strikes with the monk. To his surprise, the monk's staff was also a mid-grade artifact, capable of firing crescent-shaped beams of Buddhist light. His robes, too, were no ordinary garb—they withstood several sword strikes without significant damage.

The fight was evenly matched, and both combatants grew increasingly furious. 

At one point, the monk, determined to see the battle through, pulled out a handful of spirit stones and began absorbing their energy mid-fight, signaling his intent to fight to the death.

Lin Shan, inspired, reached into his own storage pouch—only to find it empty.

He tried again, still swinging his sword. Nothing.

Reality hit him like a bucket of cold water.

Damn it! He'd forgotten—he was broke! Not a single spirit stone to his name!

Meanwhile, the monk fought with increasing ferocity. Lin Shan, having already battled Princess Guo's group and the Great Yan Princess, was now running low on stamina and spiritual energy.

"Fine, fine!" Lin Shan laughed bitterly. 

He had just broken through in cultivation, upgraded his gear, and set out with soaring confidence—only to be ambushed repeatedly the moment he left Yichuan. One wave after another, like an endless tide of nuisances.

Now, despite being evenly matched with the monk, his dwindling energy reserves put him at a disadvantage. 

As his sword beams weakened, the monk seized the opportunity to close the distance. 

Lin Shan welcomed the shift to close combat—even with low energy, his defensive artifacts could still passively protect him. Who was afraid of melee?

With his high-grade defensive mirror and mid-grade sword, Lin Shan fought recklessly, trading blow for blow.

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

The monk's staff struck Lin Shan's bronze mirror, sending sparks flying, but the battered artifact held firm, shifting effortlessly to block every attack.

"A high-grade defensive artifact!" The monk's face paled. 

He had tracked Lin Shan through the mountains with great difficulty, unaware of his earlier battles. With his staff and robes—both mid-grade—he had thought himself unrivaled among Qi Refining rogue cultivators. Yet here was Lin Shan, wielding a high-grade artifact, something even Foundation Establishment cultivators rarely possessed.

But the real shock came when Lin Shan, unburdened by defense, slashed through the monk's robes with his sword.

"Rip—"

The red robes, excellent against spells but weak against physical attacks, tore open, revealing a pair of bright red undergarments.

Both men froze and leapt apart.

Lin Shan blinked in surprise. The monk had a thing for red underwear? Was this normal for secular disciples?

The monk, mortified by the exposure of his secret preference, turned beet red. 

"You—you just wait!" he stammered, clutching his torn robes. "The mountains are high, the rivers long—we'll meet again! Next time, don't fall into my hands!"

With that, the monk fled into the forest, his red undergarments flapping as he ran.

Lin Shan didn't pursue. His energy was nearly spent, and without spirit stones to replenish it, chasing was futile. 

Still, today's battles—three victories in a row—had inflated his confidence. Among Qi Refining rogue cultivators, he was now a force to be reckoned with. 

He wondered how he'd fare against disciples from major sects.

Shaking his head, Lin Shan prepared to leave. The Yan-Yun Mountains were no place to linger without energy. 

After looting the fallen enemies' storage pouches (disappointingly empty), he remembered one last thing. Picking up the broken halves of the talisman sword, he smirked.

Did those fools really think they could escape?

Hmph. Too naive.

Had they never heard of a certain technique—one that could kill from a thousand miles away?
