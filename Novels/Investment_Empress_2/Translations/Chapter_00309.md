# Chapter 309: Ice Lump Soup

As dusk deepened, the snow-covered streets seemed like white clouds stained with crimson glow.

Ying Bing looked at Li Mo's nonchalant expression and felt an inexplicable urge to curl her fingers. However, her hand was holding candy, and it was completely enveloped by his, leaving nowhere to retreat.

Cold?

Even during the fiercest blizzard today, she hadn't truly felt the cold. Her ice-skin and jade bones, tempered by the power of the Great Yin, made a bit of wind and frost insignificant. She had long grown accustomed to it. Not knowing cold naturally meant not knowing warmth.

But now, with her left hand outside and her right hand tucked into his pocket, wrapped by his warm, large hand, the contrast between cold and warmth suddenly became clear.

"A little," she said.

"!"

To be honest, even Little Li hadn't realized what he had just done instinctively.

What a joke—could the Ice Lump possibly feel cold?

Yet the small, boneless hand in his palm did seem to have warmed up a bit. Li Mo couldn't help but observe her expression.

Ying Bing's face remained expressionless, but a faint blush had risen on her pale, moon-white cheeks. It was unclear if the twilight outside the carriage window had secretly crept in. Her clear, spirited eyes gazed out the window, bathed in the interplay of day and night, light and shadow intertwined.

"I'll definitely learn to paint well in the future!" Huzi exclaimed, rubbing his eyes as he looked at the two inside the carriage.

He used to think that candy tasted the same no matter how you ate it, so why go through the trouble of painting? But now, he desperately wanted to capture this scene with sweet sugar syrup. This was probably what Grandpa meant by...

"Sugar sweetens the mouth, but painting sweetens the heart?"

At that moment, the sound of carriage wheels and horses suddenly came from the end of the street. Carriages covered with oilcloth pressed deep ruts into the accumulated snow. The convoy was escorted by two rows of soldiers. Judging from their attire, they were clearly soldiers from the Qingmu Camp.

"Young Hero Li."

The leader was a deputy general under Qu Sheng, who had met Li Mo at the Jiawei Restaurant yesterday. He immediately sat upright on his horse and cupped his fists in greeting.

"I was on military duty today and couldn't attend the military drill to witness Young Hero Li's prowess. It is a great regret."

"What kept you so busy?" Li Mo asked casually.

He then winked at Huzi beside him. The boy reacted, his eyes widening in surprise.

"Winter is approaching. These are all the military grain and supplies we've gathered."

"No wonder there's so much."

"This isn't much. Alas, for eighty thousand soldiers and officers, plus logistics, over a hundred thousand men and horses are consuming supplies."

At this point, the deputy general furrowed his brows with worry. "I'm not even sure if these supplies will be enough to get us through the New Year."

After exchanging a few more words, the deputy general led the supply train back to camp to report. Li Mo raised an eyebrow upon seeing this.

From what the deputy general said, it seemed the Qingmu Camp was facing a shortage of military grain and pay?

But Qingmu City was the outpost of the Southern Pass and the deepest city within the Great Yu's southern frontier. Its significance was immense. Even though there hadn't been war here for many years, it shouldn't be lacking in military grain and pay.

He had seen the garrison troops in Baoping Town, which stood in stark contrast to the disciplined Southern Pass City. If there was a shortage of military pay, this kind of disorder wasn't hard to understand...

"Wait!" Li Mo called out to the deputy general after thinking it over.

He still had many supplies in his System space that he had purchased from the Yunzhou Hengtong Mercantile Group that day. Many of them hadn't been used yet. He planned to return to Ziyang Prefecture in a few days, so keeping them was pointless. He might as well leave them at the Qingmu Camp.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in the Qingmu Camp and alleviating their grain shortage.】
【You have an investment reward to claim.】

...

Night fell.

Inside the main command tent, Qu Sheng drank a bowl of medicinal soup, and some color returned to his pale face. Hearing the report from outside the tent, he took a deep breath and said with full vigor, "Enter."

The deputy general walked into the tent and was first taken aback. "Commander, is your old injury acting up again?"

"Just moved some blood and energy. It's nothing."

Qu Sheng saw the deputy general's expression and frowned. "The military grain collection... didn't go smoothly?"

The deputy general grumbled, "The supply officers who went to the various towns to requisition grain all said the local garrison commanders weren't cooperative. They only turned over a symbolic amount of grain. These ungrateful bastards!"

"It's fine if it's a little less," Qu Sheng sighed silently.

If he pushed the garrison troops too hard, they would end up squeezing the common people under their rule. The Southern Pass was no longer what it used to be, with a million-strong army and the full support of the entire Great Yu.

"We'll have to find other ways."

Rubbing his temples, Qu Sheng looked at the map in the tent, as if deep in thought. A moment later, he turned back to look at the deputy general who was still standing there.

"Is there something else?"

The deputy general nodded. "A portion of this batch of supplies was a gift from Young Hero Li..."

"The supplies he purchased before coming to the southern frontier?"

Qu Sheng was stunned, then he smiled. "It's a drop in the bucket, but it's the thought that counts."

How many supplies could one person possibly prepare for a trip to the southern frontier?

But he never could have imagined who Li Mo had purchased from—a man who was always prepared to settle down in a place for a lifetime.

"It's not a drop in the bucket. You'll understand once you see it."

"Oh?"

Qu Sheng was puzzled and took the spatial artifact from the deputy general.

"The grain and pills in here are all from Young Hero Li."

"..."

Qu Sheng's eyes widened. This amount of military grain was equivalent to one-third of what they had collected from all the towns combined.

The grain was secondary. There were also many common medicinal pills, such as Golden Sores Ointment and Qi-Replenishing Pills, all packed inside the spatial artifact he had given the deputy general.

With these supplies, they would still face a shortage, but it had undoubtedly alleviated their most urgent needs.

Qu Sheng let out a heavy breath. After a moment of excitement, his expression turned complicated.

Qingmu City was about to go to war. He still didn't know how much strength the Disaster Beasts and the Great Shang descendants had mobilized this time. He could only do everything in his power to increase their chances of victory and the hope of defending Qingmu City.

This was also why he had hesitated that day, swallowing the words he was about to say to劝 Little Marquis and Young Hero Li.

But what if they couldn't hold the city?

How could he let people like Young Hero Li die here with them?

...

Meanwhile.

In a private room at the Jiawei Restaurant, the aroma of delicious dishes wafted through the air. This was the simple daily meal for Little Li and the Ice Lump.

There was just one thing missing—a soup.

During the meal, Li Mo was preoccupied with his research. "Ice Lump, what would be the effect of adding Golden Leaf Nourishing Grass to the soup?"

"That's for pill refinement. If you put it in soup... you'd retain about fifty percent of its effect," Ying Bing replied, her snowy cheeks moving slightly.

Little Li often developed new recipes. He must be researching stewed soups this time? She was already used to it.

"That's not bad."

Li Mo placed the Golden Leaf Nourishing Grass on the table and took out a box of strange-looking small flowers. "What about if I add these Moistening Origin Rose Petals? Will their medicinal effects clash?"

"No, they complement each other to some extent," Ying Bing said.

As she spoke, Li Mo took out one type of spiritual treasure after another, filling half the table with a dazzling array.

Ying Bing raised her dark eyebrows. With so many ingredients, it would be enough for a whole barrel, let alone one pot.

"What kind of soup are you making?"

Li Mo thought for a moment and pondered, "If I had to call it something... Ice Lump Soup?"
