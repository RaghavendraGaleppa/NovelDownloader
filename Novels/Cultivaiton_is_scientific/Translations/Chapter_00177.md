# Chapter 177: Cultivation

After his doppelganger advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage, Li Shiming had a peculiar sensation. It seemed that the soul enhancement from reaching Foundation Establishment had caused some unusual changes in the consciousness he had left within the doppelganger.

That fragment of consciousness now felt completely separated from his main body, yet there remained a faint connection that allowed mutual influence between the two at any time. Through this tenuous link, the main body could control the doppelganger's actions. However, the main body could no longer fully retrieve that consciousness—it had become solidified within the doppelganger's soul, forming its intelligence.

Li Shiming was momentarily stunned. He didn't know whether this situation was normal, as his knowledge of cultivation was severely lacking. Even if he had joined a major sect, it would have been difficult to access such advanced cultivation knowledge about doppelgangers. After all, doppelgangers weren't something Qi Refinement cultivators could normally interact with, let alone have them break through to Foundation Establishment like regular cultivators.

Moreover, the "Dual Mind Technique" Li Shiming used wasn't a standard cultivation method but rather a martial arts technique. The split consciousness produced by "Mutual Combat" had been modified by him, and his prolonged separation of consciousness had made the dual-mind state a habitual practice. This time, the soul enhancement from Foundation Establishment had rendered this separated consciousness permanently irretrievable, creating a true dual-mind state.

Li Shiming could only instruct IBMz15 to record this phenomenon for future study. With his current abilities, he couldn't explain what had happened.

"Fellow Daoist, it seems we've truly become two separate people now," the main body said helplessly to the doppelganger.

"Fellow Daoist, we are two people, but I am still you, and you are still me," the doppelganger replied with a smile.

Though this was an unexpected development, its impact on him was minimal.

After the doppelganger advanced to Foundation Establishment, its body instantly transformed into a corpse-refining state. The main body then set up the "Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation" to help the corpse-refining doppelganger break through to the Iron Corpse stage.

Even before entering the ghost domain environment, the doppelganger's body began to change as soon as it transformed into the corpse-refining state. Its bronze skin turned black, sharp fangs grew in its mouth, and its eyes turned crimson.

In its human form, the doppelganger was undoubtedly one of the most handsome men in the world. But after transforming into a corpse-refining state—especially after advancing to the Iron Corpse stage—it lost all traces of its former handsomeness.

The doppelganger's black skin emitted rhythmic drum-like sounds, each pulse strengthening its muscles and bones. Li Shiming used his spiritual sense to lift the doppelganger and place it inside the ghost domain environment. Although the doppelganger had already successfully advanced to the Iron Corpse stage, abundant yin energy would still greatly benefit its further strengthening.

As soon as the Iron Corpse doppelganger entered the "Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation," the yin energy within the formation surged toward it. The drum-like sounds grew more frequent, and even the noise alone was enough to unsettle Li Shiming. This was before the doppelganger had even begun cultivating the Foundation Establishment chapter of the "Sword Demon Secret Codex." Once it did, the Iron Corpse state would likely surpass the defensive capabilities of the main body's two corpse-refining techniques.

Li Shiming also summoned the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse and placed it inside the formation. Within the ghost domain environment, the bronze corpse's skin began to vibrate, emitting dull thuds with each pulse as its skin darkened further.

Seeing that both the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse and the doppelganger were progressing normally, Li Shiming decided not to linger. He wasn't sure how long the full transformation to Iron Corpse would take, so he left to attend to other matters.

Checking the time, he saw that dawn was approaching. With a flash, he exited the cave dwelling.

First, he inspected the Wei Clan's estate. The spiritual materials in the formation seemed as though they had aged thousands of years, their spiritual essence greatly diminished. This was likely the result of forcibly draining the estate's formation using the "Five Elements Absorption Formation." He realized that before attempting his Golden Core breakthrough, he would need to set up a formation at least one major tier stronger than this one. Otherwise, the same depletion might occur.

This would require a significant investment. The materials for the current formation were already expensive second-grade resources, and he wasn't sure if he had enough spirit stones for an even stronger formation. It seemed he needed to find ways to earn more spirit stones, or he might be stuck at the Foundation Establishment stage.

He knew that without breaking through to Golden Core, his main body would only live for two hundred years. As for whether the doppelganger could survive beyond that, he didn't want to gamble on luck.

With these thoughts, he soared into the air, leaving the formation and arriving at the mountain peak.

Sitting cross-legged at the summit, he faced east and activated "Purple Qi from the East," waiting for the first rays of dawn. Now that he was at the Foundation Establishment stage, he had some ability to protect himself in this region and didn't want to miss any opportunity to absorb purple qi.

As the sun rose, he captured another wisp of purple qi. Even at Foundation Establishment, this faint energy still provided a slight all-around enhancement.

"Initiate new research: methods to capture more purple qi," Li Shiming input into IBMz15 after fully absorbing the qi.

For the rest of the day, he practiced the "Hundred Thoughts Thousand Returns Technique," attempting to split his spiritual sense into more strands. This would greatly aid his control over the Nine Palaces Sword Formation.

As for the "Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique," he tried cultivating it but found his current spiritual sense insufficient to meet its requirements.

Over the course of the day, he refined his various Foundation Establishment techniques and studied relevant knowledge. The foundations of Qi Refinement didn't equate to Foundation Establishment strength. While he had superior physique and spiritual sense compared to ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, and his spiritual energy quality matched veteran practitioners, his total spiritual energy reserves and combat techniques were far behind.

The "Sword Control Art" was outdated. To wield his flying sword more effectively, he needed to master Foundation Establishment-level sword techniques. Meanwhile, the "Vajra Protection Divine Art" and "Sword Demon Secret Codex" also required him to begin their Foundation Establishment chapters. Fortunately, both had complete manuals, so he didn't need to worry about body-refining aspects.

The various application methods in the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art" also needed to be learned and practiced. By the end of the day, he had barely managed to review all the Foundation Establishment knowledge he needed to study.

He realized that reaching Foundation Establishment hadn't made his life easier—instead, he was busier than ever.

That night, he didn't rest. He remained seated at the outlet of the upper-grade spirit vein, cultivating the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art." After reaching Foundation Establishment, cultivation no longer had time restrictions; as long as his body could endure it, he could cultivate indefinitely.

However, the main cultivation technique was only one aspect of his strength. Given his precarious situation, he needed to master Foundation Establishment combat abilities as quickly as possible.

The next morning, he sat in the same spot on the mountain peak, but this time with a two-person-tall concave mirror beside him. The mirror's position had been precisely calculated by IBMz15. As the first rays of sunlight appeared on the horizon, Li Shiming's body actively absorbed the purple qi from the light shining on him, while the concave mirror reflected additional sunlight onto his body.

This wasn't an ordinary mirror but a special one Li Shiming had crafted based on the principles of the Fresnel lens. The reflected sunlight was concentrated onto his body, allowing him to fully absorb the energy from the mirror's reflection.

A faint smile appeared on Li Shiming's face as he sensed his body absorbing another wisp of purple qi from the reflected light. This confirmed his theory. The next step was to design a large-scale concave mirror array to gather even more purple qi.

Of course, this was still in the conceptual stage. To actually build it, he would need abundant materials and a secure location where he could work undisturbed.

Ten days later, Li Shiming's intense cultivation routine continued. The doppelganger and the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Corpse finally completed their advancements.

The doppelganger's Iron Corpse form stood beside the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Iron Corpse. Both had similar fangs and crimson eyes, though the latter was three times the size of the doppelganger.

For a long time to come, both corpses would need to regularly enter the "Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation" for further strengthening. Though they had reached the Iron Corpse stage, it was divided into early, middle, and late phases. Currently, both were only at the early stage.

The doppelganger switched back to its human form. Its priorities weren't limited to corpse-refining—it also needed to master combat techniques and cultivate its main technique.

"Fellow Daoist, you should have a name. How about Li Yuanba?" the main body suggested with a smile.

The doppelganger now had a fixed consciousness, unlike before when it would become a mindless puppet upon the main body withdrawing its awareness. Aside from its peculiar Iron Corpse form, the doppelganger was indistinguishable from a genuine Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Li Yuanba greets Fellow Daoist," the doppelganger replied with a bow and a smile.

The two shared a laugh. Since this world had no knowledge of the Tang Dynasty, they were likely the only ones who understood the name's significance.

After its advancement, the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Iron Corpse also showed increased autonomy, better understanding Li Shiming's commands.

"Three Heads, Six Arms... how about I call you Nezha?" Li Shiming mused.

He gave Li Yuanba the metal-attribute flying sword spirit artifact he had obtained as a reward from his duel with the Northern Shu Mingxin Sect. From his spoils, he also selected a high-quality spirit artifact shield as a backup weapon for Li Yuanba.

The backup was necessary because Li Yuanba was preparing to cultivate the "Ten Directions Sword Art." A sword cultivator's only weapon was their sword—dividing attention to other artifacts would only dilute their focus. The supremacy of sword cultivation techniques wasn't an exaggeration. Though Li Shiming didn't want to interfere, he believed Li Yuanba should have some defensive capabilities before fully becoming a sword cultivator.

As for Nezha, he equipped it with a full-body spirit artifact armor. The "Radiant Flow Armor" could morph into any shape as long as it didn't exceed the original material limits. Thus, despite Nezha's three heads and six arms, the armor managed to cover its entire body—though the hem was noticeably shorter to accommodate the extra limbs.

Li Yuanba placed the golden jade slip containing the "Ten Directions Sword Art" against his forehead. Just as the main body had done with the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art," he accessed the full Foundation Establishment chapter after advancing.

Li Shiming sat nearby, recording the Foundation Establishment chapter of the "Ten Directions Sword Art" into IBMz15 through Li Yuanba.

"It seems I don't need to search for another sword control technique," Li Shiming remarked with a smile after reviewing the contents.

Though he couldn't cultivate the "Ten Directions Sword Art" himself, its sword control techniques were still usable. Additionally, aside from the unique spiritual energy produced by the technique, all other methods Li Yuanba learned could be employed by Li Shiming.

As a top-tier technique, the "Ten Directions Sword Art" had stringent requirements: one had to master sword intent before learning it. Li Shiming didn't understand how one could grasp sword intent at the Foundation Establishment stage. Had he not obtained the Sword Bone, he might never have even heard of it.

His perspective was limited by his environment. The seven sects of Tianhai Island had no sword cultivation heritage, so there were no methods to nurture sword intent. However, major sects had accumulated resources and knowledge for sword cultivation.

For example, sword intent could be acquired by studying sword marks left by predecessors or cultivating certain basic sword techniques. These required sect底蕴 (heritage), which was why sword cultivators were almost exclusively found in major sects.

Even if a rogue cultivator with extraordinary talent managed to develop sword intent, without proper heritage, their achievements would be fleeting.

After thoroughly studying the Foundation Establishment chapter, Li Shiming realized he had made the right choice in not having Li Yuanba use the "Five Elements Absorption Formation" to break through. Besides sword intent, the "Ten Directions Sword Art" required a metal spiritual root to cultivate metal spiritual energy.

Li Yuanba began cultivating the technique. Spiritual energy entered his body, circulated through specific meridians, and was influenced by sword intent before finally settling in his spiritual lake. The metal spiritual energy in the lake was far sharper than normal, carrying traces of sword intent. It was as though countless spiritual swords were stored within, their sharpness permeating every part of his body.

After completing a cycle, Li Yuanba slowly opened his eyes, sword light flickering within them. Though this was his first time cultivating the "Ten Directions Sword Art," he already exuded the aura of a sword cultivator—as if he himself were a sword.

The technique also had a unique method for refining spirit artifacts. The metal spiritual energy infused with sword intent invaded the metal-attribute flying sword, aggressively carving sword intent sigils into it.

The sword was named "Swift Wind Golden Light Sword." Given its quality, Li Yuanba wouldn't need to replace it until at least the Golden Core stage. Of course, the "Ten Directions Sword Art" didn't allow casual sword changes—each replacement required prolonged seclusion to reforge the bond.
