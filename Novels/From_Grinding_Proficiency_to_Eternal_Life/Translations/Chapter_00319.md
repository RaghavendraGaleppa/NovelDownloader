# Chapter 319: Mystic Heaven Treasure Catalog

She spoke coldly, her voice like a blade of ice scraping against bone. "A disciple of the Dao Sect kills someone on the street and destroys my imperial city's architecture. Bi Sheng, is this the discipline you teach?"

Bi Sheng casually dug a finger in his ear, but the Nine Layers of Innate Vital Energy flowed subtly, shielding Xu Yunfan behind him. "Girl Su, you can eat recklessly, but you can't speak recklessly."

He pointed casually at the ruins faintly visible in the dust clouds in the distance. "Those people were clearly trying to sow discord and set up a frame-up to twist the truth. This old man suspects they are remnants of the Great乾 Dynasty who slipped through the net thirty years ago."

The military advance of the Great乾 Dynasty from the Northern Border was certainly not a spur-of-the-moment action.

As early as thirty years ago, the covert agents infiltrated by Great乾 had already been laying the groundwork in the shadows—penetrating border passes, bribing court officials, and even stealing the Dragon Vein Map of Great Zhou.

Now, with the Empress withered and枯竭 due to the backlash from the blood sacrifice, the court is in turmoil and the national fortune is declining. This has provided the dormant Great乾 remnants with a perfect opportunity.

Suddenly slapping his forehead as he reached this point, he said, "Oh right, when the Great乾 Dragon Case was suppressed back then, it seems like someone from your Celestial Pivot Gate 'happened' to be in seclusion and didn't participate?"

The air instantly froze.

The mole between Su Wanqing's eyebrows turned a vivid, bloody crimson, and the blue bricks within three zhang of her feet silently turned to dust.

This was the most taboo old scar of the Celestial Pivot Gate.

Back then, three elders of the Celestial Pivot Gate were found to have colluded with Great乾 remnants and were ultimately executed by the Imperial Court. If the Celestial Pivot Gate hadn't及时 latched onto the Empress's thigh, it would have been completely wiped out thirty years ago.

"Insolence!"

She swept her sword finger, and nine transparent sword shadows formed from frosty aura appeared behind her. "Jiang Tianyang is the Third Elder of the Sword Pavilion. How dare you slander him as..."

"Hey, hey, hey, this old man didn't name any names. Girl Su, don't say that. If we really get down to it, aren't you the one with the illegitimate position?"

Bi Sheng interrupted with a grin, but then he suddenly stopped smiling, and his old eyes flashed with terrifying intensity. "But if Sword Master Su insists on being serious, why don't you hand over those few rats in the waterside pavilion first? This old man just happens to want to ask them why they were plotting against my Dao Sect disciple from the very beginning."

Su Wanqing's pupils contracted slightly.

She had long sensed that the people in the waterside pavilion had strange auras, but now she was caught in a dilemma. The capital is currently surging with undercurrents; if she backs down in front of everyone, where would the dignity of the Imperial Court be?

But the old drunkard in front of her was already at the Ninth Realm sixty years ago, and even the Empress had to call him "Daoist" back then.

If she leaves without a fight, where would her face be?

The myriad thoughts rising in her mind were instantly smoothed over.

"What a sharp-tongued old bastard."

She suddenly sneered, and the nine frost swords formed a star formation above her head. "This Seat wants to see today just how much power you have left!"

Her words had barely fallen when the nine swords launched simultaneously!

Each sword carried a bone-freezing chill, and the paths of the swords twisted the light into ice-blue vortices.

But Bi Sheng didn't even lift an eyelid. His thin fingers flipped in his sleeve, and a rust-covered iron sword slid out silently. The blade was covered in cracks, but faint dark golden patterns shone through.

Xu Yunfan, watching from the side, raised his eyebrows slightly.

This iron sword was extraordinary. With the discerning eye honed by his Heavenly Crafting Forging Technique, he instantly judged that this iron sword had fallen from the rank of an Eighth-Rank Divine Weapon.

But it was still enough to rank as a Seventh-Rank weapon.

*Clang!*

The iron sword trembled slightly, and just as the nine frost swords were about to strike, it suddenly split into nine phantom shadows.

Each sword shadow accurately blocked the edge of a frost sword, and the collision point exploded with starlight intertwined with ice and fire.

What was even more bizarre was that the rust scales fell off with the agitation of the sword qi, revealing the Daoist Zodiac Star Cloud patterns engraved on the spine of the blade.

"Girl Su, watch closely..."

Bi Sheng suddenly spun around, the iron sword drawing a perfect circular trajectory.

In an instant, the spiritual energy within a hundred zhang was forcibly extracted, transforming into three hundred and sixty golden dots suspended in the air.

These dots corresponded completely to the star layout of the frost sword formation, but their positions were inverted!

"Reverse Evolution: Constellation Shift!"

The nine frost swords suddenly went out of control, their edges turning to point directly at Su Wanqing.

Her pupils shrank abruptly, and threads of true energy burst from her fingertips, but she found that the nine frost swords formed from her energy had completely severed their connection to her. Those golden dots were frantically devouring her true energy!

"Old bastard!"

Su Wanqing let out a sharp cry, and the mole on her forehead shot out a blood light.

She clapped her palms together, and the true energy in her body boiled like molten lava, actually forming a three-zhang tall Dharma Form behind her. The Dharma Form had six arms, each holding a sword of ice essence, and it slashed down towards Bi Sheng.

Bi Sheng snorted contemptuously, and the iron sword suddenly flew from his hand and spun.

Scarlet earth fire surged from the cracks in the blade. When the long swords of the Xuanming Dharma Form cut into the earth fire, the blades were immediately covered in rust marks, and even the Dharma Form shadow began to blur!

"You people of the Celestial Pivot Gate are still using this old trick. It's been scaring people for so many years."

Although Bi Sheng continued to mock, Xu Yunfan, watching from the side, watched with shining eyes.

The embryonic form of a Martial Dao Dharma Form!

Although the *Mystic Heaven Treasure Catalog* of the Celestial Pivot Gate takes a crooked path and is denounced by orthodox Dao sects as a heterodox method, the method of condensing a Martial Dao Dharma Form hides profound secrets.

Before descending the mountain, Bi Yuan had a heartfelt talk with him, lamenting with great emotion that walking the Nine Realms of Martial Arts to the end was already the limit. To break through the shackles of the Ninth Realm, the heavens do not permit it.

The so-called Land Immortal Realm is now nothing but a reflection of the moon in a well or a flower in the water.

The Xuanming Dharma Form with six arms holding swords, formed by Su Wanqing's transformation of true energy, could not only freeze the blood and suppress true energy, but also faintly touched the realm of "communicating with the gods through martial arts."

Perhaps it was another path to break through the shackles of the Ninth Realm.

As for heterodox methods, whoever has the bigger fist is the righteous way.

At this moment, Bi Sheng pointed two fingers together, and the broken sword suddenly split into twelve sword lights, each entwined with a different attribute of earth vein qi. "Let me show you what a true..."

"Ninth Realm Sword Dao!"

As his words fell, the twelve sword lights intertwined like dragons, instantly shredding the Xuanming Dharma Form.

What a pity!

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a bit of regret. That Dharma Form was like a wax-headed spear—good for show but useless in reality.

Su Wanqing grunted and retreated violently, a trace of ice-blue blood leaking from the corner of her mouth.

She stared fixedly at the rust-covered iron sword that had returned to Bi Sheng's hand. Under Bi Sheng's true energy activation, these rust-covered marks began to seep out a faint clear halo.

"Girl Su."

Bi Sheng suddenly transmitted his voice secretly, his tone carrying a rare killing intent. "At the third watch, at the 'Gui Water Position' of the imperial city's earth veins. Bring your *Mystic Heaven Treasure Catalog*.

If you don't come... this old man will捅 the matter of the Celestial Pivot Gate secretly keeping the *Great Zhou Dragon Vein Map* right to the Empress's bedside."

The frost sword formation collapsed with a rumble.

Su Wanqing's fingers under her wide sleeves trembled slightly.

Three days ago, she had indeed found half of a dragon vein map in the sect's secret vault, but not even her direct disciples knew about this matter...

"I'll give Bi Lao face today."

She suddenly sheathed her sword and turned, her dark palace gown turning into a flowing cloud as she shot towards the imperial city. "But if the Dao Sect disciples dare to act recklessly in the Capital again..."

"I know, I know, come drink tea and apologize!"

Bi Sheng waved his hand with a grin towards the sky, but then he winked at Xu Yunfan. "Kid, tonight I'll take you to watch a great show!"

At the top of a distant pavilion, Su Wanqing's figure faltered imperceptibly.
