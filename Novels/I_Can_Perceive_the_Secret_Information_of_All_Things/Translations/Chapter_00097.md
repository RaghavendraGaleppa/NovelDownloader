# Chapter 97: The Master of Vocal Mimicry at Warm Fragrance Pavilion  

Visual effects required finding someone skilled in the art of painting, which was a challenging task. Therefore, Xiao Ji decided to tackle the issue of sound effects first and inquired with Boss Pei Yisheng about experts in vocal mimicry.  

"Ah, when it comes to vocal mimicry, Fairy Feiliu from the Luanming Pavilion is slightly better than Fairy Yougu from the Warm Fragrance Pavilion," Pei Yisheng remarked, seemingly lost in thought.  

"I'm referring to genuine vocal mimicry," Xiao Ji corrected.  

"That's exactly what I meant too," Pei Yisheng replied.
