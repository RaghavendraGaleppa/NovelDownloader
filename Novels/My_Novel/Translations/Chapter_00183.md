Chapter 183: Prodigies Clash, a Beauty Longs for Her Lord

The Qingyuan Prefecture Academy was a first-class institution. The academic atmosphere was open and free; on the roads, one could often see students debating scriptures and principles, the sound of reading aloud filling the air.

"Is there a tavern in the academy?" Li Xian asked.

"Let's go eat outside," Liu Shu hurriedly said.

"Alright," Li Xian replied. He knew the others were financially strained and prone to feelings of inferiority. There were many fellow students within the academy. If they were seen dining out, the inevitable gossip and criticism would make things uncomfortable.

The five set off together. On the way, Li Xian inquired about Li Xiaofan's daily life. Xiaofan recounted everything truthfully.

Life at the academy was peaceful, mostly consisting of reading, writing, and debating with others regarding the Dao. Liu Shu, Hong Chengbing, and Lu Xuan's eyes dimmed slightly upon hearing this. What Xiaofan described was only one side of the academy.

"Brother Xian, this noodle shop is delicious! Let's eat here!" Lu Xuan pointed to a small shop at the end of an alley.

The steam was fragrant.

Tables and chairs were set out in the alley, occupied by quite a few students. All wore coarse cloth and simple, unadorned clothing.

Li Xiaofan said, "Brother, this shop has oil-and-chili noodles. We don't have those in Qingning County. They're so fragrant!"

Lu Xuan, Hong Chengbing, and Liu Shu were roughly the same age as Li Xiaofan. Their family situations were similar. Seeing that Xiaofan's brother, though handsome, wore simple clothes and accessories, they deduced he was not from a wealthy family.

They also knew a bit about Xiaofan's background. The four of them often chatted, inevitably touching on their family situations. Lu Xuan, Hong Chengbing, and Liu Shu were in similar predicaments: poor, but with enough to eat and wear. Li Xiaofan was the most destitute.

They knew even more about Li Xiaofan's brother. To help Xiaofan study, he had sold himself into servitude. Although Xiaofan had "plucked the flower" [passed the exam], meaning his brother had likely freed himself from slavery, given such circumstances, how wealthy could the family be?

Thus, they intentionally guided the group to the noodle shop outside the academy. The owners were an elderly couple with a kind heart, selling cheap noodles. The prices in the prefecture city were high; thanks to the old couple, poor students could barely manage to eat.

Li Xian smiled. "The noodle shop is fine, but since we rarely come out, we should eat something substantial. I'll be staying in the prefecture city for a few more days, so we can come try the oil-and-chili noodles another time."

"This..." Hong Chengbing hesitated, wanting to say something but stopping.

Li Xian smiled. "Come on, we have to go to a decent tavern at least. I'll treat you all to a feast."

Hong Chengbing, Liu Shu, and Lu Xuan looked at Li Xiaofan. Xiaofan lowered his voice and whispered into Li Xian's ear, "Brother, things in the prefecture city are really expensive!"

"Don't worry, your brother has money," Li Xian said, patting Xiaofan's shoulder. Madam had given him a hundred taels. He also had over ten properties in Qingning and had brought a hundred taels with him when he left. He figured he could handle the bill for a meal.

Hong Chengbing and the others couldn't refuse further and had to follow. They walked down the street, faces slightly red, heads lowered, looking at their feet, feeling extremely awkward. They felt as though everyone was staring at them.

Li Xiaofan was distracted, thinking: *My brother hasn't seen me for a long time. This meal will surely cost him a lot of silver. I need to find a way to get some silver to help cover his travel expenses.*

Not long after, they arrived at the "Zhenxiang Building." The tavern was bustling with activity. The waiters inside were neatly dressed, without any patches. Seeing this, Hong Chengbing and the others became even more timid and didn't dare enter.

Li Xian, however, was calm and composed. He stopped a waiter and asked, "Is there a table available?"

The waiter was busy serving dishes. He quickly scanned Li Xian's clothes, then glanced at the four youths behind him, intending to shoo them away. Suddenly, he sensed Li Xian's extraordinary aura. The words caught in his throat, and he changed his tone临时. "Sir, this is the Zhenxiang Building. Are you sure you haven't gone to the wrong place?"

"We..." Liu Shu's face flushed red. He was shy and awkward, feeling like he had nowhere to hide.

Li Xian smiled. "We came specifically for the Zhenxiang Building."

The waiter said indifferently, "Very well. There are tables in the hall upstairs. You five may go up and find a seat yourselves."

The Zhenxiang Building was four stories high. In the prefecture city, this tavern wasn't considered top-tier. One could find a few similar buildings on Red Candle Street in Qingning County. Li Xian only had about two hundred taels on him, so he had to be realistic. Although to Hong Chengbing and the others, this place was already unattainable.

On the second floor, near the terrace, there was an empty table.

After sitting down, Li Xian called the waiter and ordered dishes: braised pork, spicy wet beef... all meat-heavy dishes. He estimated it would cost about thirty taels to settle the bill.

This was already very expensive.

Li Xian smiled. "This tavern is a business. We are customers. What is there to be afraid of by eating here?"

"A man may be poor in body, but not in ambition. If one's ambition is not poor, where can one not go?"

Hearing these words, the three gradually relaxed.

Just then, a voice suddenly sounded: "Not so, not so." A man in a blue robe walked over slowly, holding a folding fan and gently wafting it.

The man was dressed luxuriously. A closer look revealed he wore beast-skin boots, a jade pendant and fragrant pouch at his waist, and a hairpin inlaid with pearls and gems. His nobility was indescribable.

Liu Shu, Lu Xuan, and Hong Chengbing turned pale the moment they saw him, revealing looks of fear. Li Xiaofan also clenched his fists.

The atmosphere instantly tensed. Li Xiaofan and Liu Shu exchanged a glance and both whispered, "Damn it, why is he here of all places?"

Li Xian was sharp-witted. He smiled calmly and said, "May I ask what advice you have for me, brother?"

The blue-robed man said, "Advice is too strong a word. It should be correction." He paced back and forth, speaking slowly and deliberately. "You shouldn't call me 'brother' either. I am certainly not your brother."

Li Xian said calmly, "Please, speak your correction."

"You just said a man may be poor but not in ambition? That one can be calm and composed anywhere?" the blue-robed man said. "I say a man who is poor is short on ambition. There are places you lot simply cannot set foot in by birth."

"But there are always those who don't know the limits of heaven and earth, wanting to peep at the jade towers, shouting that poverty doesn't mean a lack of ambition, and shamelessly trying to appear refined."

"They are just clowns, hopping around and singing for hire, disgusting people."

"Wang Cheng, don't go too far!" Li Xiaofan had a good temper, but he had a grudge against Wang Cheng. He had once defeated Wang Cheng in a debate, and since then, Wang Cheng had held a grudge.

Usually, when Wang Cheng provoked him, Li Xiaofan ignored him. But today, Wang Cheng's words were directed at Li Xian, which made him furious.

Li Xian smiled. "Whether I can set foot here has nothing to do with you, right?"

"Naturally," Wang Cheng said, gently waving his fan. "But drinking in the same building as you lowers our grade. If you don't leave, then the Zhenxiang Building... I won't be coming here anymore."

He had several companions behind him. They had gathered for a party and should have gone to the private rooms on the third or fourth floor. But upon seeing Li Xiaofan, Hong Chengbing, and the others, Wang Cheng came specifically to provoke them.

The commotion here quickly attracted the manager of the Zhenxiang Building, a middle-aged man named Hu Dazhen.

Liu Shu tugged at Li Xian's sleeve. "Brother Xian, let's go. We can't win against them. They bully us out of habit. If we take a step back, they'll just ignore us."

Li Xian looked at Hu Dazhen and said淡淡, "Manager, you run a business. You decide the principles here."

Hu Dazhen looked troubled. He deliberated for a long time, deciding it was best to make peace. He said:

"Here's what we'll do, Young Master Wang. We just caught a four-tailed red fish and made a ginseng fish soup. I'll give it to you for free. Let's just let this matter rest, how about it?"

Wang Cheng said coolly, "It seems my face isn't enough to make Manager Hu drive someone away."

Hu Dazhen gave an awkward smile. He didn't like the arrogant Wang Cheng either. Wang Cheng said, "Li Xiaofan, don't you have a sliver of luck? Why don't you weigh the principle of this matter?"

In the Great Wu Empire, both civil and military matters were valued.

Martial arts can lead to longevity; civil arts can bring peace to the world.

Using civil arts to carry luck and weigh principles. If the principle is right, heavenly luck protects you; if wrong, it obstructs you. But Li Xiaofan's luck was very slight; this "scale" was too fragile to bear the weight.

"Manager Hu, since Young Master Wang isn't qualified, what about me?" A thin man walked out and said calmly. "I, Wan Run, have no appetite upon seeing them. I don't mean any disrespect. I ask Manager Hu to mediate and handle this matter for me."

Wan Run crossed his arms and raised his head, saying arrogantly, "You should have heard of my name. I, Wan Run, am not talented. I entered the Hero List not long ago, ranking sixty-seventh."

Hu Dazhen's expression changed. He weighed his interests in his heart: Although Wang Cheng was a rich young master, he had no civil luck or martial prowess. Hu Dazhen was only courteous to him because of his family background. If he really offended him, the losses wouldn't be great, and Wang Cheng couldn't do much anyway. But Wan Run was different. A martial artist who had made a name for himself carried a deterrent force. If he offended him to the core, it would be hard to resolve the situation.

He said, "Since... since that's the case, then there's nothing I can do. Young friends, sometimes affinity is hard to explain. Please..."

"Wait," Li Xian said. "Are you saying that a master of the Hero List can use his status to bully others?"

"Hmph!"

Wan Run had a violent temper. He had already revealed his identity, yet this fellow still wanted to resist. Thinking about it carefully, this was a look of looking down on him. He immediately said:

"I will bully you, what of it? I hate your talk of 'poverty without ambition' the most. Today, I won't just bully you; I'll crush your ambition."

With that, Wan Run looked around, pinched a peanut between his fingers, and shot it at Li Xian's knees. Li Xian caught it between two fingers, and with a *pop*, the peanut turned to dust.

Wan Run intended to show off his skill and might. If he won with fists and feet, it would be a victory, but not impressive. Incorporating martial arts into other things and then executing them was the way to win praise.

He looked around, searching for something usable. Suddenly, he saw a gauze curtain. He walked over in a few steps, tore it down, rolled it in his hand, and whipped it toward Li Xian.

The gauze curtain went *pop pop*, skillfully channeling internal energy through it. If it draped over someone, it would feel like taking a dozen punches in an instant.

This technique truly drew gasps of admiration from the onlookers: "This is... the Cloak Back Fist! Legend has it that those skilled in this style like to wear wide robes. The fist is hidden under the sleeve; with a flick of the sleeve, it's like a thousand heavy punches coming at you!"

"Incredible, incredible. Wan Run uses the gauze curtain instead of a sleeve. The curtain is lighter, yet he wields it with such power. He must have reached the Great Perfection stage."

Wherever the gauze brushed, chopsticks snapped and bowls shattered... Li Xiaofan cried out, "Brother, be careful!"

Li Xian sneered. He lightly tapped the scabbard, and the Great Luo Saber Art was unleashed. Wan Run said, "Heh, the gauze is soft as water, and I'm holding it. How can your saber art cut through it? Not seeing through this simple point is truly..."

With a *tear*, the gauze was already cut in half. The gauze had internal energy attached, making it as soft as water. Li Xian using only the Great Luo Saber Art would be like a wild ox in a quagmire, struggling to defend.

But Li Xian added the essence of the "Gentle Breeze Leg," and it was a completely different story. The Gentle Breeze Leg emphasized lightness and silence. It originally contradicted the open and vertical essence of the Great Luo Saber Art, but since Li Xian had brought both to their peak, they fused perfectly.

Water is soft; the gentle breeze is even softer.

Li Xian took a big step forward and applied the essence of the "Four Directions Fist." A single saber art now displayed the shadows of three peak martial arts. In an instant, saber shadows flashed incessantly, and no one on the second floor could keep their eyes open.

Wan Run was also stunned. By the time he came to his senses, he felt a tightness at his throat and was lifted up by Li Xian with one hand.

Li Xian said, "I think you've got the wrong idea."

"If the Hero List truly allows one to bully others, then I shall bully you."

Wan Run's face twitched, his reputation in tatters. He immediately vibrated his internal energy and struck back with a reverse hand. Li Xian was greatly disappointed: "Is this all the strength of a Hero List prodigy?"

He threw him straight out of the building. Wan Run gathered his energy in mid-air to slow his fall. But he felt the weight of the force, impossible to resist, and crashed heavily to the ground.

Although he had prepared his posture in mid-air and landed on his feet, his leg bones had shattered, making it hard to move. It was difficult to even run...

Li Xian, holding a teacup, walked to the terrace, looking down at Wan Run from above. He took a calm sip of tea and said, "I'll treat you to tea!"

Using the internal strength of the "Emerald Luo Palm," he gave a light shake. The teacup shattered into over a hundred fine pieces, which he shot forth using the "Ascending Cloud Hand." The fine fragments embedded themselves in Wan Run's body.

So far, all the martial arts he had used had reached the Great Perfection stage! Unfortunately, those present were not at the level to understand the severity.

Wan Run's legs were in agony, and he couldn't dodge.

In an instant, he became a man of blood. The injuries weren't fatal, but the porcelain shards carried palm energy, sticking in his flesh, making them hard to remove!

It was a grievous injury, akin to having one's tendons pulled and skin peeled. Li Xian sat back down calmly and collectedly. The surrounding spectators were all shocked.

Li Xian said, "Manager Hu, since Master Wan has lost his appetite, I have already escorted him out. Shouldn't you serve our dishes properly now?"

"Good, good..." Hu Dazhen nodded repeatedly, as if waking from a dream. After a moment, he came to his senses and asked, "May I ask... may I ask for the great hero's name?"

Li Xian smiled. "What great hero? My name is Li Xian. Hurry up with the dishes!"

Hu Dazhen immediately went to the kitchen, pondering the name "Li Xian." Suddenly, his eyes widened and he cried out, "The Evil Lieutenant... Li Xian? He is the Evil Lieutenant Li Xian?"

Thinking of Wan Run's miserable state, he muttered, "The name 'Evil Lieutenant' doesn't match his face. He has the face of a jade man but does the work of a vicious man."

Wang Cheng tried to flee in terror, but how could Li Xian let him go? He picked up a peanut and shot it at Wang Cheng's pain point, making him wail incessantly.

Li Xian suddenly paused. His methods were becoming increasingly ruthless. He sensed Madam's踪迹.

The time for a meal passed.

They ate and drank their fill.

Li Xian escorted Xiaofan back to the academy. Just as they left the tavern, Li Xiaofan shouted, "Sister Gu! Sister Gu!"

They saw a beautiful woman in a purple dress walking over with graceful steps. Her eyebrows were like a painting, her lips as red as cherries. Standing there, she was a rare sight.

She was the same age as Li Xian, so she didn't have Madam's mature, ruthless charm, or her voluptuous, alluring figure. But she was in the full bloom of youth, like the blazing sun. The pride hidden between her brows was the most vibrant Li Xian had seen among the many women he had encountered.

Li Xiaofan smiled. "Brother, this is the wife I picked for you, Gu Nianjun!"

"Seize the opportunity well. If you win her over, you can walk sideways across Yunan Dao!"
