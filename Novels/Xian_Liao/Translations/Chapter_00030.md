# Chapter 30: Tiger and Crane (Part 1)

Zhou Qing stood at the forefront of the assembled scholars, following the instructions of the ceremonial instructor beside him. He washed his hands in a bronze basin, then sprinkled water on his shoes and hat, completing the "ablution" ritual for school entry.

Next, the scholars orderly entered the Pan Pool, crossed the Bi Bridge, and arrived at the main hall of the academy, the Hall of Confucius. Led by the ceremonial instructor, the new students entered the hall.

Inside the grand hall, the statue of the Supreme Sage was flanked by senior scholars—the top-ranking scholars in front, the supplementary scholars behind. The new scholars took their places in the center, facing the statue. As the top examinee, Zhou Qing stood at the very front, flanked by the second to fifth-ranked candidates from the prefectural examination.

They then awaited the arrival of the newly appointed Prefect of Jiangzhou, Ling Chenghe, a second-tier jinshi scholar in his prime. Such officials were usually posted locally as a transitional phase before rapid promotion. Local gentry generally avoided offending such men.

Being a second-tier jinshi, Prefect Ling merely glanced at Zhou Qing, the young top examinee, without particular interest—most successful jinshi had been local prodigies themselves. The busy new prefect treated the academy's entrance ceremony as mere formality, something Zhou Qing was quite familiar with from his past life in academia. He followed the routine without incident.

Prefect Ling left early, while the scholars endured half a day of lecturing from the academy's instructors until noon. A prepared lunch was provided, which they could choose to eat or leave early.

Zhou Qing presented Wang Hai with a carefully crafted Black Chicken Pill as thanks for his earlier assistance in the alley, explaining it was a family recipe with genuine restorative properties. Wang Hai accepted graciously, knowing Zhou Qing avoided pleasure quarters, and instead proposed scholarly discussions when time permitted—though time was scarce for Wang Hai, who disliked academics and was content with his xiucai degree.

Wang Hai also conveyed a message from Examiner Lu, who had urgent business in Changzhou. He revealed next spring would see an extra imperial examination—news that would soon be public, though well-connected individuals had known for a month. This exceptional spring examination, unlike the regular autumn schedule, would be followed by a metropolitan examination the next year—an imperial favor to scholars.

The spring schedule allowed new provincial graduates more preparation time for the metropolitan exam. Examiner Lu suggested Zhou Qing attend the Changzhou provincial exam to gain experience, after which they could return to Jiangzhou together. Zhou Qing agreed readily.

Miss Lin's information proved accurate—the extra examination was indeed scheduled for spring, leaving only six months to prepare. Securing a provincial graduate status became Zhou Qing's priority, as it would establish his standing in Jiangzhou and provide security even in turbulent times. He recalled historical figure Diwu Lun, who survived the turbulent Xin Dynasty by fortifying strongholds, later achieving high office—a model of surviving chaos while attaining prominence.

Unlike his ambition for provincial graduate status, Zhou Qing harbored no desire for the jinshi degree, fearing the uncertainties of court politics during unstable times.

Under the old mulberry tree in the Lin family courtyard, Zhou Qing sat shirtless after taking his vitality powder, inserting Crane Needles into key acupoints using Crane Force to stimulate his body. Focusing his mind on the Crane Form's internal cultivation method, he visualized crane movements, feeling increasingly light-bodied—a more challenging visualization than tiger or deer forms, which were grounded creatures.

Drawing from memories of various cranes—red-crowned, gray, demoiselle, white, black-necked—Zhou Qing enriched his mental imagery over a month until his attention turned to his Health Master panel:

Five Animals Exercise (Basic):
- Tiger Form (Proficient) + Crane Form (Proficient)
- Deer Form (Proficient)
- Bear Form (Basic)
- Bird Form (Basic)
- Ape Form (Basic)

Martial Skills:
- Black Tiger Steals Heart (Proficient)
- Finger Flick Divine Skill (Transcendent)
- Breeze Talisman Canon (Familiar)

Special Skills:
- Revival Talisman Canon (Basic)
- Elementary Alchemy (Rudimentary)
- Literary Courage (Elementary)
- Remaining Lifespan: 46 years

A fleeting smile gave way to pain as Zhou Qing pressed his back against the mulberry tree, countering the fiery sensation in his organs with its cool energy—a documented side effect of Crane Form mastery that he mitigated using the tree's yin energy, as noted in Abbot Fushan's Revival Talisman Canon annotations.

Though far from mastering the complete canon, Zhou Qing now had sufficient skill to attempt healing Butcher Hu's leg injury, pending preparation of Black Jade Ointment. He postponed merging Tiger and Crane forms to focus on the treatment, estimating five days for preparation and another five to assess success.

Without time to practice on other patients, Zhou Qing proceeded with 50% confidence, relying on precise Crane Force control and left-hand dexterity. The treatment's two essentials—Crane Needles and Black Jade Ointment—were irreplaceable.

Preparing the ointment himself at Jishi Hall within five days, Zhou Qing brought it to Qingfu Temple where Butcher Hu, now Fushan's nominal disciple, awaited. Fushan had bolstered the butcher's morale by predicting future success if he survived this ordeal.

Before treatment, Butcher Hu made a request: if his legs remained crippled, he asked Zhou Qing to have the gang members who injured him handed over for retribution should Zhou become an official. Zhou Qing agreed but expressed hope for full recovery, suggesting Butcher Hu could someday lead his own gang.

During the procedure, Zhou Qing used soft gold needles energized by Crane Force to penetrate acupoints, applied the ointment, and bandaged the legs while stimulating pain-relief points. The intense focus left him sweating despite his calm exterior.

Five days later, Butcher Hu showed no signs of infection, and his improving condition suggested possible mobility within two months. Fushan praised Zhou Qing's extraordinary talent in the Revival Talisman Canon, remarking that with earlier training, he might have reached the legendary Xiantian realm.

Now focused on merging Tiger and Crane forms—a process Fushan estimated would take a decade—Zhou Qing retired to the Lin residence. With the rooster guardian on watch, he locked himself in, cleared his mind, and invoked his Health Master:

"Health Master, it's up to you now."

As his consciousness stirred, the Health Master interface blurred while knowledge of Tiger and Crane forms collided and fused in a burst of mental inspiration.
