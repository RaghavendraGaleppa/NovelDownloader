# Chapter 72: Fleeing Langya County

Zhang Jing's pitch-black pupils reflected the flames that filled the sky, along with the figures standing atop fiery clouds in midair.

At this moment.

A raging skeletal demon crow was slowly falling from the sky, a crimson fire arrow embedded in its chest.

"Fellow Daoists from the Bone Path have traveled thousands of miles to visit Nanli. Why leave in such a hurry? Shouldn't you allow us hosts to properly entertain you?" A voice dripping with killing intent rang out.

A purple-robed inner courtyard disciple stepped forward.

Dozens of rune-like Dao patterns materialized from the void, scattering and instantly imprinting upon the sky. Faint cyan and crimson spiritual light connected them, forming a cage that trapped all enemies within.

He laughed heartily.

"Haha! The Windfire Annihilation Array—enjoy, everyone!"

In an instant, the cyan-crimson cage transformed into a spiritual vortex, voraciously drawing in the spiritual energy from hundreds of miles around.

The sky darkened in response.

Within the array.

Boundless cyan winds rose, intensifying into a storm within moments.

Nameless karmic flames ignited.

In the blink of an eye, the flames rode the wind's power, while the wind fanned the flames—an endless, self-perpetuating cycle.

Violent! Destructive!

It showed no signs of stopping until the enemies were reduced to ashes.

All this happened in the span of a lightning flash.

Below.

Zhang Jing quietly withdrew his gaze, a trace of yearning flashing in his eyes.

With a flicker of movement, he vanished from the rooftop.

Inside his second-floor room, he swiftly packed all his belongings into his storage space.

Faint cries and chaotic footsteps reached his ears.

Zhang Jing knew there was no time to waste.

The priority now was to leave Langya County territory as quickly as possible.

Just then—

Crash!

The floorboards shattered as a massive deer head burst through.

"Master! Disaster! Your human kin are fighting in the sky—their auras are terrifying!" Deer Thirty-Eight trembled in fear, its entire body shaking uncontrollably.

Poor thing.

In all its years of existence, Deer Thirty-Eight had never witnessed such a horrifying scene.

Good heavens!

The sky itself seemed on the verge of collapsing from the flames.

This completely overturned its deer worldview.

Stealing a glance at Zhang Jing, the deer couldn't help but reflect:

Less than a day with this master.

Yet in this single day, it had experienced more danger and excitement than in its entire decades-long life combined!

"Will our Deer Clan lineage end with me, the thirty-eighth generation?"

Deer Thirty-Eight's mind wandered anxiously.

---

On the other side.

Zhang Jing couldn't be bothered to scold the deer for destroying the house.

Given the current situation, whether Langya County City would even exist after this battle was questionable.

With a light step—

All second-floor flooring collapsed, revealing the scene below.

Zhang Jing gracefully descended, landing squarely on Deer Thirty-Eight's back.

"Thirty-Eight, this is no place to linger. Let's go." His voice remained calm.

Precisely in such moments, composure was paramount.

"Master, which way?"

Zhang Jing pointed decisively away from the battlefield. "First get out of Langya County, then we'll circle back to the Dao Academy."

"Understood! Hold tight, Master!"

With a low bellow, spiritual light shimmered around Deer Thirty-Eight as it crashed through the wall, charging in the indicated direction.

It was putting every ounce of strength into its gallop.

Four hooves became blurs, riding surging winds that carried Zhang Jing higher.

Next instant—

Smack!

Recognizing the danger, Zhang Jing smacked the deer's antlers.

"Thirty-Eight, lower altitude! Flying high now is suicide."

The reprimand jolted Deer Thirty-Eight to awareness.

It quickly descended to ground level, sprinting into the distance.

Along the way, they passed numerous fleeing rogue cultivators and fellow Dao Academy disciples, drawing envious stares.

Zhang Jing remained vigilant on the deer's back.

His eyes tracked the terrifying magical aftershocks raining from the sky, constantly directing Deer Thirty-Eight to adjust course and avoid calamity.

Under Zhang Jing's guidance, the deer raced forward like a streak of light.

Looking back at the flickering distant sky, Zhang Jing finally exhaled in relief.

They'd made it out.

Yet the moment this thought surfaced—

A sudden premonition of danger struck.

Zhang Jing stood abruptly, staring ahead.

There lay a narrow trench carved by magical residue, emitting faint icy energy—nearly invisible in the night.

Deer Thirty-Eight, oblivious to the danger, was about to leap over it.

Danger! His Mind's Eye activated instinctively.

"Thirty-Eight, evade!"

Zhang Jing's breath caught as he shouted.

But it was too late.

---

In the crisis—

Whoosh!

The Five Elements Spiritual River materialized instantly.

Walls of icy-blue spiritual light formed desperately before Deer Thirty-Eight.

An ear-piercing grinding sound erupted.

Finally.

The massive deer halted just before the trench, unable to advance.

Wiping cold sweat, Zhang Jing's Mind's Eye had detected it—within that trench lingered a faint but complete strand of foreign Dao Rhyme, radiating deadly menace.

He couldn't risk it.

Accidentally triggering that Dao Rhyme while crossing would be disastrous.

"Master," Deer Thirty-Eight rubbed its squashed deer face, puzzled. "Why'd we stop?"

"Detour around this trench."

Zhang Jing offered no explanation, still shaken.

"Master—"

The deer's question was cut off by shrill air-rending sounds behind them.

Zhang Jing turned to see—

A streak of light approaching rapidly, accelerating as it neared.

Likely a late Qi Refinement senior brother, Zhang Jing guessed.

"Senior Broth—"

Before he could finish—

The figure soared over the trench.

A wave of decay flashed.

Their spiritual light dimmed instantly, the body crashing heavily nearby.

Within moments—

Only a withered skeleton remained, even the robes and artifacts stripped of spiritual power.

Deer Thirty-Eight glanced over, then trembled violently.

"Master... y-you were right." It stuttered.

The outside world is dangerous, Thirty-Eight. Never wander far—just eat and sleep near our cave.

Its father Deer Thirty-Seven's dying words echoed painfully.

Tears welled in its eyes.

The outside was terrifying—it wanted to go home.

Even if that place had no more spirit herbs now.

But—

A furtive look at Zhang Jing brought despair: "This deer won't be going home."

Meanwhile.

Dread still lingered on Zhang Jing's face.

---

A late Qi Refinement cultivator—gone in an instant, without even a scream.

"Is this the power of Foundation Establishment? Of complete Dao Rhyme?"

"Even dissipated remnants, even the faintest strand... still beyond Qi Refinement resistance."

Moreover, this magical residue and its Dao Rhyme might persist for decades.

Zhang Jing could imagine:

For years after this demonic turmoil, Langya County would become forbidden ground.

Countless magical scars and lingering Dao Rhymes would lurk like ravenous beasts.

Turning from the senior's remains, Zhang Jing's expression smoothed.

He left a warning marker by the trench, then urged Deer Thirty-Eight onward.

After this lesson, Zhang Jing remained hyper-vigilant.

His Mind's Eye stayed active continuously.

Only after putting a thousand miles between them and Langya County City, with no more battle reverberations detectable, did Zhang Jing allow high-altitude flight to leave Langya and Yun Province.

Three days later.

The vast Longze Lake came into view.

Zhang Jing exhaled deeply, tension finally easing.

Deer Thirty-Eight too seemed to shed its terror, reverting to its chatty self.

It glanced between Zhang Jing and its own bulk, recalling the shop incident, its deer-face twisting conflicted.

"Master, I'll stay outside your place."

"I can sleep outdoors—thick hide handles weather fine."

"But Master," it pleaded pitifully, "that life-saving talisman you promised? Please hurry."

"I hear Dao Academy has experts like stars! Without protection, some psycho might slaughter me—then you'd lose your loyal steed!"

"Any other requests?"

Zhang Jing suppressed a smile, feigning sternness.

"Also," Deer Thirty-Eight jingled a small pouch around its neck, "could you find me land? Spirit-rich preferably. I've collected seeds to grow herbs."

---

"Don't worry, you'll get it."

"Actually, Thirty-Eight."

Zhang Jing studied it. "Do you have cultivation methods?"

"Nope."

The deer's voice rumbled.

"Born knowing how to absorb heaven-earth energy and herb essence."

"Those water-walking, wind-riding skills—innate too?"

Deer Thirty-Eight nodded.

Zhang Jing felt a twinge of envy.

From observation, the deer's energy absorption efficiency ranked between mediocre and low-grade cultivation methods.

But it was innate.

Unlike humans who must struggle through trials for cultivation opportunities.

Gazing at the deer's large head, Zhang Jing felt genuine satisfaction with his new mount.

As a steed—

Docile temperament, swift stable movement, unquestioning obedience despite doubts.

Plus herbalism skills.

Aside from cowardice, stupidity, and chattiness—practically flawless.
