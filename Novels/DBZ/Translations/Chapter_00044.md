# Chapter 44: The Cruelty of Demonic Cultivators  

Two thousand days—just over five years.  

Using all that time solely to improve his cultivation would be an absolute waste. With that many days, if he focused his wishes on the Hundred Arts of Cultivation—such as the alchemy path he excelled in—he could likely accumulate enough experience to reach the upper tier of the first rank.  

But no matter how he looked at it, the ratio of two thousand to one thousand seemed unbalanced.  

Wei Qian suddenly considered another possibility: his spiritual root aptitude might already have been near the top of the lower-grade tier, just a step away from reaching the middle-grade level. The Dragon Pearl might have only helped him complete that final leap.  

Shaking his head, Wei Qian let out a long sigh.  

The Dragon Pearl was, in essence, an inanimate object without consciousness. He couldn’t summon the divine dragon to answer his questions either.  

No matter how perplexed he was, he had no choice but to set it aside for now.  

*"As long as I keep climbing the path of immortality, I’ll uncover all the secrets of the Dragon Pearl sooner or later!"*  

Shaking his head again, he dismissed those untimely thoughts.  

Breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refining today was truly cause for celebration.  

However, since he didn’t have many close friends in the Li Family, he could only celebrate alone. He descended the mountain and found a tavern in a nearby mortal town, ordering a lavish feast and enjoying a few cups of wine.  

The food at this tavern was excellent, perfectly suited to Wei Qian’s taste.  

But the so-called "fine wine" they served was far from impressive.  

After tasting the "Clear Spirit Drunk" brewed by that Master Shen, ordinary wines could no longer satisfy his palate.  

*"Perhaps I should try brewing my own wine someday. It’d be a good way to balance work and leisure."*  

*"Cultivating nonstop would just turn me into a block of stone sooner or later."*  

As he indulged in the meal, his ears twitched slightly—he caught snippets of conversation from the next table.  

After breaking through to the second level of body cultivation, his physical body had undergone comprehensive enhancements. His vision, hearing, and sense of smell far surpassed those of spell cultivators at the same level.  

Thus, even though the neighboring table spoke softly, he could still hear them clearly.  

Of course, he wasn’t the type to deliberately eavesdrop on private conversations.  

The reason he paid attention was that their discussion piqued his interest.  

This was a group of rogue cultivators who had come to Misty Ridge Mountain in hopes of joining the Li Family.  

Recently, with the news of the family gaining another Foundation Establishment expert—and rumors of a possible connection to a Wanxing Sect elder—the Li Family’s reputation had stabilized, attracting many rogue cultivators.  

But why would these cultivators, accustomed to a "free and unrestrained" lifestyle, willingly submit to the constraints of a cultivation family?  

*"Ugh, why did demonic cultivators have to resurface after a thousand years, right in our generation?"*  

*"Exactly! Before, low-level cultivators like us were relatively safe. But now, these new demonic cultivators are using everything—flesh, blood, souls—it’s terrifying!"*  

*"Absolutely. The situation in Yunzhou is getting worse by the day!"*  

Wei Qian listened for a while, absorbing their grievances.  

He had heard of the resurgence of demonic cultivators, but this was the first time he had heard outsiders describe just how severe the situation had become.  

Ever since that Golden Core demonic cultivator from the northern Liao Kingdom appeared in Zhao Country, the demonic sects—which had been extinct for a thousand years—had begun to re-emerge.  

Long-lost demonic cultivation techniques resurfaced here and there, their rapid progress attracting countless rogue cultivators with no future prospects.  

Thus, the "new demonic cultivators" were born.  

They turned the already morally questionable Zhao cultivation world into an even more chaotic mess.  

Horrifying practices like refining zombies, extracting souls to forge Ten Thousand Soul Banners, creating skeletal undead, and crafting flesh abominations became increasingly common.  

Wei Qian was certain that these techniques existed in the collections of Zhao’s major sects and families.  

But the fact that they hadn’t spread in a thousand years suggested an unspoken agreement to suppress these demonic legacies.  

In Wei Qian’s view, this was undoubtedly a wise policy.  

After all, most cultivators wouldn’t want to live in a world overrun by zombies, ghosts, skeletal undead, and flesh monsters.  

*"These techniques must have been spread by that Wandering Soul True Monarch from the Soul-Shattering Mountain!"*  

*"These demonic cultivators are absolute scum, polluting every place they go like wild animals marking their territory..."*  

Meanwhile, in the northern Liao Kingdom, atop a mountain shrouded in eerie yin energy and ghostly aura, the very True Monarch being cursed sneezed violently.  

*"Ah-choo!"*  

Rubbing his nose, the Wandering Soul True Monarch frowned.  

*"What’s going on lately? I’ve been sneezing nonstop. Could there be something wrong with my physical body?"*  

But he had already consulted fellow cultivators from the Blood Sea Sect and the Bone Path—they had confirmed his body was perfectly fine.  

*"How is Jile’s progress?"*  

*"Even though we Golden Core cultivators live for over five hundred years, we can’t afford to waste a century just searching for a secret realm!"*  

The Wandering Soul True Monarch grew increasingly impatient.  

A while ago, he had suggested returning to Zhao Country to investigate, but Jile had tactfully refused.  

Jile claimed that everything in Zhao Country was proceeding smoothly—they just needed a few more years to locate the secret realm before making their final move.  

Though doubtful, the Wandering Soul had no choice but to trust him.  

Mostly because he was already swamped with responsibilities.  

Most people believed the northernmost reach of civilization was the Liao Kingdom, but only its native cultivators knew the truth: beyond Liao lay an endless, thousand-mile glacier.  

There, inhuman creatures dwelled. Whenever the frost tides descended, they would invade Liao, pillaging and slaughtering to escape what they called the "White Calamity"—a devastating superstorm of cold.  

To maintain a sustainable cycle of exploitation, the seven demonic sects couldn’t ignore the common people entirely. They had to take some action.  

For instance, the Wandering Soul True Monarch had been assigned to patrol and protect a territory spanning a hundred thousand miles.  

As long as the death toll didn’t exceed one-third of the population, he would be considered successful.  

If he failed?  

Given his status as a Golden Core True Monarch and a potential Nascent Soul candidate of the Soul-Shattering Mountain, his punishment would be severe—he’d be forced to drink three cups of wine as penance!
