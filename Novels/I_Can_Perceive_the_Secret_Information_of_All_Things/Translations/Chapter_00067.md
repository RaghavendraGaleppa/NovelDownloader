# Chapter 67: The Bidding Master

"Seven thousand one hundred." Xiao Ji offered his third bid.

This was exactly the kind of scene the staff at Taigu City Auction House loved to witness - two wealthy bidders locking horns. They were all too familiar with how this would play out: prices would keep climbing as pride came into play. Even cultivators weren't immune to matters of face.

[Target identified: Son of Huanglong Zhenren from Huanglong Sect. Competitive and petty by nature, never accepts losses and always seeks revenge. Currently preparing for Foundation Establishment. His father provided 44,000 spirit stones for purchasing Foundation Establishment Pills. After spending 3,600 on entertainment in Taigu City with sect members, remaining funds: 40,400. Accounting for return trip expenses, available spirit stones: 40,000.]

Armed with this knowledge, Xiao Ji's strategy became clear - provoke his opponent. For someone petty who couldn't stand losing, the method was simple: always bid just slightly higher.

After several rounds:
"Thirteen thousand one hundred," Xiao Ji said calmly.

"What's your game? Always just a hundred above me?" The narrow-eyed cultivator's voice dripped with anger. "Twenty thousand!"

"Twenty thousand one hundred," came the unflappable response.

"Are you going to allow this?" The furious bidder stood, pointing at Xiao Ji while addressing the auctioneer.

The auctioneer shook his head - no rules were being broken - and struck his gavel once. "Twenty thousand one hundred, first call."

"Fine, you penniless monk," the cultivator spat, sitting back down. "Thirty thousand!"

The price had now reached the market value range for synthetic Foundation Establishment Pills. This was the moment the crowd had been waiting for - all present were now spectators to this battle of wealth.

"Thirty thousand one hundred," Xiao Ji raised his placard.

A kind-hearted cultivator nearby whispered to Xiao Ji: "Synthetic Foundation Establishment Pills are mass-produced items. Thirty thousand yellow-grade spirit stones already guarantees profit. Any higher exceeds market value."

Xiao Ji nodded in appreciation.

"Forty thousand!" The narrow-eyed bidder didn't hesitate, putting all his available funds on the line.

"Forty thousand one hundred." A faint smile touched Xiao Ji's lips as he detected satisfying information.

[The Huanglong Zhenren's son knows he can't win the pill, but his vengeful nature compels him to make you overspend for it.]

"Fifty thousand!" The bidder shouted a price beyond his means, exchanging a look with his sect members who understood his intent and stopped intervening.

"Sixty thousand." Xiao Ji escalated further.

The audience felt their attendance justified, witnessing this display of financial might. Qian Duoyu beside Xiao Ji yawned - this was his first auction, and the spectacle wasn't as exciting as he'd imagined. The bidding seemed timid to him, though he reconsidered when remembering his own annual allowance barely exceeded a hundred thousand stones.

With only two bidders remaining, the price quickly climbed to seventy-six thousand.

[The Huanglong Zhenren's son plans one final bid before withdrawing, forcing you to overpay massively.]

"One hundred thousand." Xiao Ji announced the astronomical sum as casually as discussing the weather.

"One hundred ten thousand!" The narrow-eyed cultivator made his final bid, lips curling in triumph. He reveled in making this monk waste tens of thousands of stones through mere words, congratulating himself on his improved scheming skills.

The auction hall fell silent, awaiting Xiao Ji's response.

Instead, they heard: "I withdraw."

Though everyone knew the auction would eventually end, the abrupt declaration still shocked them.

"Wait, what?" The narrow-eyed bidder blinked in confusion, the world suddenly feeling unreal, as if trapped in a nightmare. "Why stop now?"

"Because I'm tired." Xiao Ji's answer was simple, his expression unchanged throughout. In psychological warfare, Xiao Ji believed no one in this world could match him.

On stage:
"One hundred ten thousand, first call... second call... third call." The auctioneer's gavel struck thrice. "Sold! This premium sweet-flavored synthetic Foundation Establishment Pill crafted personally by Master Nameless belongs to the Huanglong Sect representative. Congratulations!"

Thunderous applause erupted as all eyes turned to the narrow-eyed cultivator.

"But I..." The bidder stammered helplessly.

The auction concluded with immediate payment required per Taigu City rules. Sturdy attendants promptly arrived to escort the honored guest to complete the transaction.

But this case proved exceptional - the winning bidder lacked sufficient funds.

After multiple confirmations, the unprecedented situation (unseen in Taigu City for millennia) left staff unprepared. They could only detain the bidder for fraud, leaving sentencing to the city authorities.

"A minor hiccup," the seasoned auctioneer announced. "We can offer this precious pill to the second-highest bidder."

Xiao Ji declined.

"Very well, we'll restart the auction." The auctioneer prepared to reoffer the pill.

The disappointed crowd resigned themselves to the situation.

Xiao Ji shook his head again, citing regulations:
"According to Taigu City Auction House Rule 978: When only two bidders remain, and one party maliciously inflates prices causing auction failure, the item shall be sold at the third-highest bid from the other party."

"My third bid was seven thousand one hundred yellow-grade spirit stones."

"Therefore, I need only pay seven thousand one hundred for that glossy black Foundation Establishment Pill."

Silence gripped the hall. Who actually memorized the entire Taigu City auction regulations? That archaic text no one read anymore? This loophole would surely be patched after today.

After extensive deliberation and archival review, Taigu City authorities had no choice but to sell the pill to Xiao Ji at the drastically reduced price.

As the crowd dispersed outside the auction house:
"Brother Xiao, I just remembered - our family pharmacy has several synthetic Foundation Establishment Pills. I'll bring you two bottles next time," Qian Duoyu offered.

"You should've mentioned that earlier," Xiao Ji sighed. "Our next meeting depends on fate. Besides, one pill suffices. Keep yours - with your talent, you'll likely need multiple attempts at Foundation Establishment."
