Chapter 107: Peerless Archery, You Are Too Late

The next day, Zheng Ziqi immediately set out for the One Union Manor, carrying heavy gold and precious treasures. He wanted to pay his respects to the Madam again and discuss the matter of the Chamber of Commerce buying lives.

His attitude was extremely humble, so he did not provoke any conflict, but his status was insufficient, and he was unable to meet the Madam.

Zheng Ziqi felt deeply defeated. Since childhood, he had been the young master of the gang, commanding the wind and rain in the Black Water Port area. Now, knowing that his brother's murderer was right inside the manor, he could not take revenge.

He was just about to return the way he came.

Who would have thought that the situation would suddenly brighten? The guard commander, Huo Hanying, secretly sent word, informing him that Li Xian was not inside the manor but had been sent early to the Black River Village. It was a remote and poor place. If he wanted revenge, he could just go there; no one would stop him.

Zheng Ziqi was overjoyed upon hearing this and immediately returned to the Black Water Gang to report the situation.

"What!"

Zheng Xuezhang slapped the table and stood up, asking, "You are saying that Li Xian is in Black River Village? I was just injured not long ago, and he has already been sent to the outskirts of Black River Village?"

"For these past few months, he has been wandering right under our noses, yet we knew nothing about it?!"

Zheng Xuezhang's voice was like a thunderclap. Although he had just recovered from a serious injury and his strength was not what it used to be, having stepped into the "Food Essence" realm, his foundation remained transformed.

At this moment, his shouting and anger made everyone present shake their legs and dare not breathe.

"Father, it... it is true. It was my foolishness that allowed him to live for several more months," Zheng Ziqi said. "If I had sent people to investigate earlier, Li Xian would certainly have become a member of the 'Human Sail' by now. The恶气 (evil breath) in the hearts of me and the brothers in the gang would have been vented long ago."

Zheng Xuezhang shook his head and said, "This is not your fault."

"I was injured, and that woman's attitude was unclear. In this sensitive time, how could you dare to investigate? If you had provoked that woman's displeasure again, your father might not have survived."

"But now it seems... that woman sending Li Xian away gives our Black Water Gang some face."

As he spoke, he stroked his beard, feeling quite pleased.

"The仇 of killing a son must be avenged!" Zheng Xuezhang said. "It is not just the仇 of killing a son. The suffering and pain of my months of recuperation must all be counted on this boy's head!"

"Father," Zheng Lüxiu stepped forward voluntarily and said, "I request permission to personally capture Li Xian. Let him be punished by the gang rules!"

The remaining sons all stepped forward one by one, saying, "We also request permission to avenge our seventh brother!"

"Good, good, good sons, all my good sons," Zheng Xuezhang was very pleased. "I am very happy to see your determination. If Caiqi had a soul in heaven, he would surely be happy."

"That Li Xian is young, but this仇 is great!"

"It is not just you who want to go, even I... must go!"

"Pass my order: the twelve flag bearers, each bringing fifty gang members, wait at the port. My Black Water Gang... will use the entire gang's strength to enter the mountains together to capture Li Xian."

"This wretch will have no way to heaven, no door to earth!"

Zheng Xuezhang's eyes flashed with light, his expression excited. He punched down, and cracks spread across the rosewood chair.

The Black Water Port was greatly active. Gang members gathered, fully equipped, just waiting for the command to enter the mountains.

The onlookers were all surprised, curious in their hearts, but dared not get close, fearing they would be caught in the killing intent.

Not long after... the twelve flag bearers, each with extraordinary martial arts, appeared one after another to lead the teams. Zheng Xuezhang's six sons, faces full of murderous aura, sat on fine horses, chests held high, imposing and extraordinary.

The elite of the Black Water Gang were all here.

Zheng Xuezhang came out last, carrying a long knife on his back, riding a brown fine water horse. Legend has it that this horse is a strange breed, with webs between its hooves, allowing it to walk on water.

"Set off, capture the thief Li, make him into a Human Sail!"

Zheng Xuezhang roared, moving to the front of the队伍 (formation). Hundreds of people, grand and mighty, entered the depths of the forest.

"Tenth Flag Bearer, you lead fifty men, go west, make a fifty-li detour, and form an encirclement."

"Fourth Flag Bearer, you lead fifty men, go east to detour and meet up with the Tenth Flag Bearer."

Zheng Xuezhang arranged orderly.

This is a very common naval warfare strategy.

The Black Water Gang has many light wooden boats. If they want to fight on the river, they send gang members on the shore, carrying boats from the left and right banks,绕到 (circling to) the back of the opponent's ships.

Then they enter the river to encircle.

Ships are clumsy in the water, unable to deal with attacks from multiple sides. They naturally lose. Even martial artists with extraordinary martial arts would find it difficult to deal with this situation.

Once trapped in the water.

The Black Water Gang does not fight you head-on, but surrounds, harasses, shoots arrows, sets fires, releases poison, using all possible means.

However, Zheng Xuezhang was eager for revenge, not knowing that the terrain in the mountains was complex. The two teams, unfamiliar with the terrain, executing the detour mission, would likely get lost.

"Press on to Black River Village!"

Zheng Xuezhang roared.

Getting closer and closer, it was now evening. Zheng Xuezhang saw nothing in his way, as hundreds of men and horses charged杀气腾腾而来.

"Father," Zheng Ziqi suddenly said, "That Black River Village is the tenant farmer of the One Union Manor's Madam, it belongs to her property."

Zheng Xuezhang nodded, "I know. That Madam spared my life, and even sent my son's murderer to this place, acting thoughtfully. I must naturally consider her face."

"The people of this Black River Village, do not kill them if you can."

"Hmph, if it were according to my past temper, this village, up and down, would all be编入 (incorporated into) Human Sails, letting them reunite on the ship."

Black River Village is located in a remote area, with mountains and forests interwoven, the terrain complex. Sometimes, walking along, a large mountain would suddenly block the path.

Some peaks have small paths that allow direct crossing, some peaks are extremely steep, with nowhere to step,只能 (can only) detour.

After walking for an hour, they still had not reached Black River Village, and the sky had turned completely dark. Zheng Xuezhang, eager for revenge, felt nothing wrong. But Zheng Ziqi secretly felt something was amiss.

"Father, should we rest here for the night? Wait for dawn to..." Zheng Ziqi asked.

"No, if we rest for the night, what if he hears the wind and runs far away?" Zheng Xuezhang's decision was made.

The large group continued to advance, coming to the foot of a mountain. On the right was a towering mountain, on the left was a stretch of forest.

Suddenly, a rumbling sound was heard from above, a huge boulder rolled diagonally down from the mountain. Zheng Xuezhang said, "Not good, quickly avoid!" He squeezed his legs, and the horse rushed to one side.

The boulder crashed onto the road, and several screams were heard as several people were crushed under the stone.

"Who!" The Black Water Gang members immediately became alert.

Just then, firelight was seen flickering on one side of the forest, as if someone was holding a torch. Zheng Xuezhang cursed, "Playing ghosts and gods, kill them!"

Several flag bearers led their respective elites, immediately chasing the firelight and rushing into the forest.

The momentum was great, but the figures gradually decreased, and soon the sound disappeared.

"Who!"

Zheng Xuezhang was furious and chased personally. However, after walking several miles, his right foot suddenly stepped into empty air, almost falling into a wooden spike pit trap. He had practiced lightness skill, stepping in the air, retracting his force and pulling back.

He thus resolved the crisis.

"Father!"

Zheng Ziqi said gravely, "There are many traps here. Several flag bearers fell into traps, seriously injured, and some died on the spot!"

"Good! Good!" Zheng Xuezhang roared, "Good Li Xian boy, he knew we would come for him, so he set up traps early!"

"Father, the road ahead is probably more dangerous. Why not plan long-term?" Zheng Ziqi already felt unstable.

Mountain forest combat is not the Black Water Gang's specialty. Moreover, just now the rolling boulder and the fire as bait were clearly not something one person could do.

That Li Xian... might not be alone.

"Plan long-term?" Zheng Xuezhang冷笑ed, "Wouldn't that just suit his intentions?"

"That Madam sent the meat to my mouth. If I still can't eat it, I would truly lose all face."

"Speed up the pace, don't let that boy run!"

The Black Water Gang did not retreat but advanced instead. Zheng Ziqi frowned, deeply surprised. Even with the仇 of killing a son, why was his father so impulsive? Could his temperament have changed after the serious injury?

How could Zheng Ziqi know.

Zheng Xuezhang was injured by the Madam, initially full of resentment. But after being tormented by the injury for several months, the more he was treated, the more he felt the Madam's power. The resentment gradually faded and disappeared.

Instead, a sense of admiration arose. When his body was in pain, he could not sleep well. Sometimes, dreaming of the Madam's appearance, unconsciously, he became infatuated.

When he recovered from his serious illness, he also learned that the Madam had sent Li Xian away. This action seemed to intentionally allow him to take revenge. The joy of this even surpassed the desire for revenge.

This action was both revenge...

Also, Zheng Xuezhang believed it was a chance to show himself to the Madam. Therefore, he made a grand display, sending out all his elite. It was as if he was showing off his military strength and spirit, like courting.

If, after all this, he still could not capture Li Xian.

Wouldn't it mean that I, Zheng Xuezhang, are a废物 (waste)?

Therefore, no matter how many traps and obstacles there were along the way, Zheng Xuezhang would definitely break through, and quickly.

Li Xian's expression was calm, his heart estimating Zheng Xuezhang's position.

"I will have a battle with this person sooner or later, I cannot avoid it."

He looked into the distance, patted the "Golden Leopard Bow" on his body, and the guard's narrow knife.

This time... facing a "Food Essence" martial artist, a grand killing. He was extremely steady, confident in his heart.

"Master Li, we are all ready."

"We have activated those机关 traps (mechanism traps), hehe, guaranteed to make them suffer enough."

"Also, we have all practiced well. Master Li, you saved our lives, this time just treat us as soldiers to command! Killing one is not a loss, killing two is a big profit."

"If we die, it's just paying back your kindness!"

Fu Bo, leaning on a crutch, gathered all the hundred or so men in the village. Holding iron nets, spears, iron shields...

The peasant entanglement formation Li Xian taught was already熟记于心 (memorized by heart).

At this moment, their momentum was fierce, seemingly not losing to the Black Water Gang.

"No need."

"You all hide in the back mountain to avoid being accidentally injured. The Black Water Gang attacks ruthlessly. You should avoid them if you can. This is my personal grudge."

Li Xian said calmly.

"Master, this..." Fu Bo frowned.

"Go."

Li Xian waved his hand.

Hearing this, the villagers had no choice but to obey and hid in the back mountain one by one. Li Xian, with one bow and one knife, climbed to a mountaintop, looking down, the view was wide.

Looking into the distance, he could vaguely see the Black Water Gang's men and horses. He took out dried tiger meat and chewed it slowly, waiting quietly.

A while later.

The sound of horseshoes gradually approached, Zheng Xuezhang had arrived. Behind him, the Black Water Gang had lost nearly forty percent of their men,狼狈不堪 (in a sorry state).

"Dog cub Li Xian, come out quickly to accept death!"

Zheng Xuezhang condensed his Qi, a roar that sounded like a thunderclap.

"Hahaha, you killed my son, I will turn you into a Human Sail!"

Zheng Xuezhang roared again.

The remaining six sons all shouted insults: "Human Sail Li Xian, why aren't you coming out quickly to kneel and thank us? We spare your life, letting you regret the rest of your days in the sail."

"Exactly, if you are thirsty, this young master can reward you with a mouthful of urine."

"I will break your hands and feet, pull out your tongue, but I won't挖 your eyes. Hehe, letting you see clearly the consequences of offending us."

The crowd was shouting.

A whistling sound of wind broke through.

The sixth son suddenly fell off his horse, his legs kicked once, his spirit dissipated and he died instantly. A arrow was stuck in his heart.

Zheng Xuezhang's heart skipped a beat. With his eyesight, he could not see where this arrow came from.

Li Xian's voice came:

"The仇 of killing a son? Is it like this?"

Another arrow came... this arrow did not kill instantly. Instead, it shot into the right arm of the fifth son, Zheng Lüxiu.

With a "bang" sound.

The immense force exploded Zheng Lüxiu's right arm. But the force was extremely skillful, the torso was not affected.

"Ah..." Zheng Lüxiu screamed. It was just him who had shouted about cutting hands and挖 tongues.

Several more arrows came, precisely hitting Zheng Lüxiu's four limbs. He fell off his horse, crying in pain, but the moment he opened his mouth, an arrow pierced through his tongue,钉 (nailing) his head to the ground.

Zheng Xuezhang's expression changed.

The sky was pitch black, although it obstructed his vision, Zheng Xuezhang was a superior figure. He should have been able to use his hearing to locate where the arrow came from.

However...

He did not detect it at all.

There were only two possibilities. First, this person's bow and arrow were strange, possessing strange effects. Second, this person's archery skill was extremely good!

"It's there!"

When Li Xian shot the fourth bow, killing half of his sons. Zheng Xuezhang, using the moonlight, finally saw Li Xian's figure.

He saw that少年 (youth) had already pulled the bow to its limit. The golden string shone, the bow was full like the moon.

Indescribably high-spirited and heroic. The arrow was on the string, and he was also on the string.

My flying arrow, how dare you evade.

This arrow was aimed straight at Zheng Xuezhang. Although the arrow had not been released, the spirit within it had already扼住 (choked) his throat and frozen his body.

Li Xian smiled confidently: "Blood Palm child, you are too late!"

The arrow had left the string!
