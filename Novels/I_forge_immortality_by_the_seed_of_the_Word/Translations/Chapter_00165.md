# Chapter 162: The Secret Realm Opens, New Opportunities

"Brother Zhang, I heard from my senior brothers in the Shangyuan Qingjing Cave Heaven that this person is a nominal disciple of the Jinting Haoyang Cave Heaven, claiming to be the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Celestial Realm lineage, no, the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Taiyi Dao Sect."

"His goal in participating in this secret realm is to be number one in Foundation Establishment," Qu Junhou transmitted to Zhang Jing, his voice laced with disdain.

Zhang Jing suddenly understood. He had been wondering who this arrogant fellow who suddenly appeared before him was. So, he was the 'strongest Foundation Establishment' of the Celestial Realm lineage.

Zhang Jing scanned him, then shook his head in disappointment. His strength was decent, but still slightly inferior to Qu Junhou. Also, he was a bit old. Wait! Could this person be relying on his age to call others 'junior brother' so brazenly? Zhang Jing wondered. After all, in terms of strength, how could this guy have the nerve? He estimated that even without using the pseudo-Innate Primordial Aura, this 'senior brother' would only last about twenty breaths against him.

Facing the two of them, Ge Qing Shen asked again, "Have you two junior brothers considered it? Don't worry, senior brother will definitely compensate for the loss of immortal crystals. Please give senior brother some face." His voice was deliberately emphasized, with a hint of impatience and anger.

At that moment, Zhang Jing moved. He slightly raised his eyelids, glanced at the other party, his disgust almost undisguised. "Not really. If Fellow Daoist Ge wants to take care of old friends, you can give up the palace you rented. It's a bit much to be generous with other people's possessions."

With that, Zhang Jing turned and left, not caring about the face of this fellow disciple. Of course, there was no need to care. This was the first time he had truly come into contact with someone from the Celestial Realm lineage. He was truly shocked. Such a self-important personality, he wondered in what environment it had grown. It was not easy to survive until now.

However, Zhang Jing knew in his heart that there shouldn't be many such people in the Celestial Realm lineage. Otherwise, within the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect, the Nine Regions lineage wouldn't have been suppressed so miserably by the Celestial Realm lineage. "Could this person be cannon fodder pushed out by the Celestial Realm lineage?" Zhang Jing frowned and guessed.

But then, as if he had figured something out, a relaxed smile appeared on his face. Was there a need to think so much? No matter who the opponent was, he would just crush them all.

At that moment, Ge Qing Shen stood there, staring blankly at the backs of the two figures moving further and further away, unable to recover for a long time. These two people... actually ignored his request. They didn't even give him, Ge Qing Shen, any face. He had already said that he could compensate them with immortal crystals, what else did they want? Ge Qing Shen was instantly furious. His blood surged, and his face turned visibly red.

"Heh, they don't understand any manners, and they don't even respect their senior brother! The Nine Regions lineage from the lower realm is indeed a bunch of mud legs, inferior humans with incomplete Dao principles in their bodies," he thought bitterly.

After taking a few deep breaths, Ge Qing Shen's face returned to normal. Then, he looked at the three people opposite him, cupped his hands, and said politely, "Ge is not strict in his discipline, and these disciples from the Nine Regions lineage are really difficult to teach, so the two incompetent junior brothers offended the three of you. I hope Fellow Daoist Shi and the others don't take it to heart."

"But don't worry, if we meet in the secret realm, Ge will definitely teach those two a good lesson."

"That, Brother Ge, those two people, you might..." The leading man among the three said with a strange expression. He really couldn't understand where Ge Qing Shen, whose strength was only slightly stronger than his, got the confidence to say he would teach those two Foundation Establishment monsters a lesson. And discipline... this guy really dared to say it. He had originally planned to remind the other party, but at that moment, the man suddenly changed his mind.

...

Time passed quickly. Half a month flew by.

Boom—

With a deafening roar, the hundred-zhang stone arch in the center of Proud Cloud Immortal City instantly solidified bit by bit. A vast, multi-layered realm, faintly visible, slowly appeared behind the stone gate. It connected to the sky and the earth, a magnificent sight.

In an area only a few miles away from the gate of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, the doors of thousands of exquisite small palaces opened almost simultaneously. Figures exuding the aura of Foundation Establishment Perfection slowly walked out from behind the doors, their eyes full of anticipation.

In front of a certain palace door. "It's finally starting." Zhang Jing exhaled lightly, his eyes suddenly becoming incomparably deep.

As soon as he spoke, he set off towards the secret realm with light steps.

At this moment, countless figures like Zhang Jing were setting off from all corners of Proud Cloud Immortal City towards the secret realm in the center.

If someone were standing directly above the immortal city that stretched for thousands of miles, they would definitely discover that every street and every corner of the vast immortal city was filled with cultivators at this moment, appearing as a dense mass.

Hundreds of millions of people turned into a mighty torrent, surging forward unstoppably. The entire immortal city instantly turned into a small boat in the flood, as if it would capsize at any moment.

...

Outer City.

In a seemingly extremely simple attic.

An old-looking man solemnly put on a brand-new magic robe. He couldn't help but look in the direction of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. A trace of determination flashed in his eyes.

Excited, the mana in his body began to boil and rage, and a powerful aura that surpassed ordinary Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivators emanated out. "My lifespan is coming to an end. Whether I live or die depends on this gamble."

"If I succeed, I will have enough luck to buy longevity elixirs, and living another life is not a luxury; if I fail, then I will die and my Dao will disappear, but I will have no regrets," the old man said to himself with a smile.

...

Inner City.

In a cave near the center.

A beautiful woman in a palace dress was resting her cheek on her hand, staring blankly at the strange scene of the crowded people outside, and couldn't help but sigh: "So many people!"

Behind the woman.

A middle-aged man explained with a smile: "Of course there are many people. You must know that every time the Proud Cloud Secret Realm opens, it will attract countless Foundation Establishment geniuses from the Seven Great Celestial Realms, as well as Golden Core and Divine Power Realm experts to participate. Just these people are estimated to be tens of millions."

"Not to mention those who have come specifically from the various Celestial Realms, as well as many cultivators from our Dongzhen Huamiao Celestial Realm who want to witness this once-in-a-century event, the number is even in the tens of millions."

With that, the man suddenly looked at the young woman in front of him and earnestly exhorted: "Xing'er, although our Dongzhen Huamiao Celestial Realm is vast and boundless, there are only nineteen major sects with Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs. If you want to choose one to join, then you must enter the top 10,000 in the Foundation Establishment realm this time, so that you can be sure."

"Oh, Xing'er knows," the young woman pouted and said coquettishly.

However, at this moment.

She had completely different thoughts in her heart. "I really don't know how strong the Foundation Establishment geniuses from the legendary Seven Top Inheritance forces are? If I defeat them, I might be qualified to join those top inheritances."

Obviously.

She was not satisfied with joining a sect with a Heavenly Immortal True Monarch, but longed to... enter the Seven Top Human Race forces.

...

In front of the ancient secret realm stone gate in the center of the square.

Zhang Jing's eyes swept across the distance.

In his sight.

The dense crowd was constantly surging towards this place, as if it was endless.

Millions, tens of millions...

Zhang Jing could no longer estimate the number of people coming. "Fortunately, I rented a palace not far from here, so I was able to arrive at the gate of the secret realm in the first batch, otherwise..."

He felt a little fortunate in his heart.

He didn't know how long had passed.

The secret realm stone gate began to tremble slightly, and a deep light flashed on it.

A wide and extremely ancient road quietly appeared behind the gate, stretching straight to the end of the line of sight.

In an instant.

Everyone, including Zhang Jing, suddenly had a piece of information in their hearts.

[The Proud Cloud Secret Realm has been opened, those who wish to participate may enter!]

He couldn't help but narrow his eyes slightly.

Then, without the slightest hesitation, Zhang Jing walked directly towards the ancient stone gate of the secret realm, his figure as fast as lightning.

Because he arrived early.

So his current location was very close to the secret realm stone gate.

In just three or five breaths.

Zhang Jing's figure passed straight through the ancient stone gate, and then disappeared.

Behind him.

The crowded crowd began to move forward little by little.

At first glance, the secret realm stone gate seemed to have transformed into a mysterious beast, devouring tens of thousands of Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators every moment.

...

In a strange space on the top floor of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.

Seven figures were sitting quietly at the moment, wearing robes of different colors, exuding a strong immortal spirit, and various Dao principles were intertwined on these figures, as if they were displaying some kind of way of heaven and earth.

Or ancient stars traverse the sky, or aurora magnetic forces tear the world, or ten thousand treasures, ten thousand laws, and ten thousand spirits compete to be immortal...

"Haha, fellow Daoists, it seems that there are many more people participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm this time than last time," one of the figures said with a smile.

"That's right, according to the information reported by Proud Cloud Immortal City, there are as many as 38 million Foundation Establishment cultivators participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm this time, and there are also 4 million Golden Core cultivators."

The figure surrounded by complex treasure light slowly responded, and then sighed: "Tsk, with so many participants, the first place in the Foundation Establishment realm and the first place in the Golden Core realm this time will earn a lot of luck. Not to mention - this is the first time the Proud Cloud Secret Realm has been completely integrated into the Xuanhuang Realm, and there must be great opportunities inside."

"Does fellow Daoist know what the opportunity is?"

"Not very clear, the spirit of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm is very vigilant, and has not revealed a single bit before."

"Haha, it seems that it is really a good thing, otherwise that guy would not make such a gesture."

"That's right!"
