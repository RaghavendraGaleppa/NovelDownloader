# Chapter 147: The Past of the Qingyuan Sect and the Hundred Birds Paying Respects to the Phoenix (1/2)

“Brother Li, if you aren't going to keep it, just give it to me. It’s a waste to throw it away.”

Mu Rongxiao quickly bent down to pick up the pictorial, dusting it clean.

He then looked up and met Li Mo’s suspicious gaze.

*Brother Mu Rong, you’re making me feel like a stranger.*

*So, you came here specifically to buy this kind of thing?*

Mu Rongxiao smiled awkwardly.

“I’ve been researching Buddhist martial arts recently.”

“And?”

Li Mo was confused.

The Golden Bell Shield is indeed a Buddhist martial art and requires practicing alongside Buddhist philosophy.

*Is that the reason you came to buy ‘Imperial Uncles’?*

Mu Rongxiao explained with a serious expression:

“The Buddhist scriptures say, ‘Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.’ As long as one’s mind is clear, looking at a beauty is the same as looking at a skeleton.”

“How can one ignore temptation without withstanding it? If I don’t enter hell, who will?”

“So, I’ve decided to challenge my weaknesses head-on!”

“......”

Li Mo fell into deep thought.

*Is that how you interpret ‘Form is emptiness’?*

*Is this how one keeps the six senses pure?*

But it made a lot of sense, and he couldn't refute it.

Unable to figure it out, Li Mo could only nod.

“Fine, remember to return it after you’re done reading.”

“Sure, take care, Brother Li.”

Mu Rongxiao happily accepted the pictorial.

He was just about to go back and challenge his weaknesses when Li Mo’s voice came from behind.

“Oh right, Brother Mu Rong, your understanding of the Buddhist path... keep it to yourself. Don't go spreading it around.”

“Huh? Why?”

“I’m afraid if it reaches the Buddhist sect, the masters will come challenge you on your weaknesses regarding the precept against killing.”

...

Main Peak, Ancestral Hall.

The Ancestral Hall was located at the center of the peak and guarded with particular strictness. Ying Bing followed several elders and traversed a very long path before finally arriving.

Along the way, Ying Bing sensed the fluctuations of spiritual sense sweeping over them several times.

The strength of the Qingyuan Sect was绝 not limited to just the visible elders.

A moment later, the group arrived before a large gate, where a drowsy old man sat.

“Senior Uncle.”

Shangguan Wencang bowed respectfully with cupped fists.

“Oh, Wencang, it’s been so long. How did you find the time to come see this old man?”

The old man woke up as if from a dream, opening his turbid old eyes.

“Senior Uncle, I am Wencang.”

Shangguan Wencang said with a wry smile.

“Oh, oh, you are Wencang... My memory is failing me.”

The old man patted the back of his head and asked:

“What brings you here...”

“To bring a true disciple, Ying Bing, to pay respects to the ancestors.”

Shangguan Wencang took out the Sect Master’s token.

“True disciple...”

The old man’s gaze passed over the several elders and landed on Ying Bing, who was standing quietly. A glimmer of light flashed through his turbid eyes.

“Good, very good...”

He praised several times in a row before taking the token and merging it with the one in his hand.

The two tokens, joined together, were inserted into the center of the gate. The heavy ancient door, painted with the pattern of a mysterious bird, finally slowly opened.

Ying Bing looked up, her eyes narrowing slightly.

In her previous life, she had never come to this place.

Before her eyes, bronze pillars supported the dome. The style resembled what she had seen in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm. Enshrined here were birds carrying a thick aura of vicissitudes.

They all stood on a section of a bronze divine tree.

Because of this, in a moment of trance, it felt as if they were still alive, their spirit vivid.

*Whoosh—*

The candles lit themselves, illuminating the divine tree.

---

“This is the Great Shang’s Dao Instrument of Destiny...”

“More accurately, a part of it.”

Shangguan Wencang clasped his hands behind his back, gazing at the bronze tree shimmering with divine radiance. He sighed softly:

“You are destined to take over my burden in the future, and there are some things that are time for you to know.”

“On this divine tree are the forms and spirits imprinted by the spiritual senses of the former Great Shang imperial clan strongmen.”

“You must be curious why this item is here.”

Shangguan Wencang’s eyes flickered.

He paused, then continued:

“The founder of our Qingyuan Sect was both a meritorious subject who aided the Great Yu Dynasty in its founding and the last of the Great Shang imperial clan.”

“After she assisted Emperor Wu in pacifying the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, she did not accept a title or reward. Instead, she returned to Ziyang Prefecture, the former capital of Great Shang, to guard the tombs of her ancestors.”

“So, beneath the Qingyuan Sect is...”

“The Imperial Mausoleum of Great Shang.”

Listening to Shangguan Wencang’s account.

Many of the nine peaks of the current Qingyuan Sect are actually inhabited by the descendants of Great Shang’s remaining officials.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, re-examining the bronze divine tree.

It was truly marvelous.

Vicissitudes, glory, decay, and exquisite craftsmanship—all were materialized in this single object.

She noticed that there was a conspicuous empty spot at the top of the divine tree.

This should be the spot guarded by the hundred birds; it shouldn't be empty.

Shangguan Wencang seemed to know her疑惑, and said:

“That was where the Founder should have left her imprint, but she later went to the Imperial City and never returned.”

“Hence, the shape of the Golden Crow remains vacant.”

“The imprints of form and spirit here are all of the Ultimate Form, obscure and profound. You have a long way to go, so observe and comprehend them carefully.”

Shangguan Wencang, in his entire life, had only comprehended one form: the Swallow Devouring the Dragon Form.

Gathering the forms of a hundred birds to assemble the Phoenix Spirit—this was the path left by the Founder.

He had once thought that achieving this within his lifetime was an impossible dream.

It was only until Ying Bing’s appearance that he saw a glimmer of hope.

After Ying Bing followed Shangguan Wencang to pay respects to the divine tree.

She finally stepped forward, walking right up to the front of the dilapidated bronze divine tree.

“Little Bing’er, this divine tree carries immense prestige. You cannot directly...”

Xue Jing had just spoken when he was stopped by Shangguan Wencang’s gaze.

“Sect Master, these imprints of form and spirit were left by the Great Shang imperial clan. Their wills still remain within them.”

Xue Jing said somewhat anxiously.

Those wills belonged to the most noble strongmen.

Every single will was domineering and extremely arrogant.

Little Bing’er had just started observing the gods; if she walked up like this, she might be injured by the wills...

“Let’s wait and see.”

Shangguan Wencang remained calm, squinting his eyes to watch.

He saw Ying Bing standing before the divine tree. Her black hair and dress swayed gently, like a snow lotus standing in the wind.

However, her cold eyes never wavered, as if the wild and ancient aura didn't exist at all.

She seemed even taller than the divine tree itself.

*Thump, thump—*

A sound like a heartbeat resonated. The dilapidated divine tree suddenly released waves of resonance.

A Green Phoenix located at the upper end actually ‘came to life’.

The Green Phoenix flapped its wings and flew down. Its trajectory across the void left behind a mysterious trail, seemingly transcending time and space.

It stood before Ying Bing and bowed in salute.

“Green Phoenix...”

Ying Bing fell into comprehension.

Based on this form and spirit, she began to carve her own spiritual sense.

Immediately after.

Various bird forms and spirits flew down from the branches of their own accord.

*Hum—*

A supreme aura flowed from around Ying Bing. She seemed like a true Phoenix receiving an audience.

In the void, it seemed as if a heavenly sound was flowing, its echoes lingering in the rafters.

Xue Jing’s eyes widened, almost thinking he was seeing a hallucination.

The other elders had similar expressions.

They were numb with shock.
