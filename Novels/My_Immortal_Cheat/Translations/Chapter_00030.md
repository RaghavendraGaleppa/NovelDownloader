**Chapter 30: [Holy Word]**

Zhou Zui shook his head desperately, squatting in the corner, unwilling to move.

Emperor Qin smiled faintly and said, "Since you're awake, we'll take our leave."

Zhou Zhan nodded beside him and said, "That's right. If anything happens, let us know promptly."

"Youngster from the Carefree family, let's go..."

Emperor Qin turned to Zhou Zui and said, "Mm-hm..."

Zhou Zui nodded frantically, not wanting to stay there a moment longer.

"Then you rest first," Zhou Yi said to Zhou Tian.

"Mm-hm." Zhou Tian also nodded frantically. Having died twice in a row this time, it seemed he had leveled up again. He couldn't wait to see what new skills he had.

The group exited Zhou Tian's room.

Emperor Qin said to Zhou Zui, "Alright, Zhou Zui, you should head back too. Don't spread what happened today..."

"Mm-hm..." Zhou Zui only wanted to go home to his mother now; it was too dangerous outside.

Emperor Qin thought for a moment, then waved his hand, sending a golden rune into Zhou Zui's forehead, saying, "Erasing memories would harm your soul. I've placed a silencing rune on you; you won't be able to speak about tonight's events..."

"Mm-hm..." Zhou Zui now only knew how to nod. The silencing rune wasn't much of an issue; being in a high position, there were many things he couldn't speak about anyway. He had a pile of such things in his mind, one more wouldn't make a difference.

Emperor Qin waved his hand, signaling he could leave. Zhou Zui bowed to everyone and scurried away in a puff of smoke.

"Zhou Zui is much more polite than Zhou Tian," Zhou Yi sighed, watching Zhou Zui's retreating back.

"Second Brother," Emperor Qin said to Zhou Yi, "I will notify those from the Outer Domain to return. The Holy Demon doesn't have much longer to live!"

"Mm." Zhou Yi nodded and said, "Should we inform the Ancestors? Tian'er, he..."

Zhou Yi's words were cut off by Zhou Zhan before he could finish. "Children and grandchildren have their own fortunes! Since Zhou Tian has already been verified by the Soul Lamp, whatever opportunities he obtains are his own business. Interfering too much will only be counterproductive!"

"Precisely so... Second Brother, don't overthink it..." Emperor Qin echoed.

"Alright." Zhou Yi nodded, saying no more. As Zhou Tian's father, his concern was natural, and he had no particular opinions about Zhou Tian's fortuitous encounters.

Inside the room, after the group left, Zhou Tian eagerly opened his Immortal System. Although he was curious why these people hadn't asked him about his ability to revive, it was better that they didn't; it saved him the trouble of explaining.

"What good people!" Zhou Tian browsed the log bar, sighing with emotion. All three deaths were due to soul attacks, clearly from the same group of people. "Truly good people," he thought. Knowing he was under heavy protection and had no chance of dying, they helped him accumulate death counts. Without them, Zhou Tian might never have activated his Immortal System.

In truth, Zhou Tian was quite miserable. Almost every moment, a large number of people protected him. A stranger had no chance of approaching him, let alone killing him. Even if he actively sought death, he wouldn't get the chance. Although his room was equipped with formations to block divine sense fluctuations, if his breathing stopped inside, a large group of people would rush into his room... It was truly a happy pain...

At the top of the character interface, his level had reached 2. The experience bar-like indicator had also changed to 0/4, meaning the death count required for leveling up had doubled.

Opening the skill interface, three more shimmering skills were unlocked below the first tier [Teleport]. Suppressing his excitement, he opened the first skill:

**[Deterrence: Ignores level to inflict a confusion state of 0-∞ duration on the chosen target, dependent on the target's fear of you. Requires direct eye contact (Daily uses: 3, related to death count)]**

This skill was quite interesting. Its activation attribute was fear. This meant if a Great Sage was very afraid of Zhou Tian, a single glance from him could terrify them into madness. But if a mortal didn't recognize him, even if he stared until his eyes popped out, they'd be fine. It was a skill with both very high and very low potential.

He opened the second skill:

**[Time Remnant: Once daily, summons your future self to assist you. Exists for one *shichen* (two hours). The summoned self does not possess system-related skills (Time interval: 300 years, related to death count)]**

It looked like a very powerful skill. If Zhou Tian could cultivate, he would have chosen this skill even if his talent was abysmal. But the crucial point was that he couldn't cultivate at all, and it didn't include system skills. Even ten thousand years later, he'd still be a mortal!

The skills that appeared this time seemed a bit ordinary. With anticipation, he opened the third skill:

**[Holy Word: Command follows word. Select a non-self target and issue a command. Success rate is random; the more complex the command, the lower the success rate. Effect depends on the target's strength (Uses: 3, related to death count)]**

"No way! A luck-based skill?" Zhou Tian's face was filled with despair. "A luckless pauper... how could *I* expect such luck?"

Just as he was about to close the skill interface, Zhou Tian suddenly noticed a faintly glowing small question mark at the very bottom.

"Annotation!" Zhou Tian's spirits immediately lifted. He opened the annotation:

**[Note: Can consume one revival count to issue a guaranteed successful command. The command cannot exceed three characters and cannot involve the target's physical existence. After use, [Holy Word] goes on a seven-day cooldown!]**

"It can be used like this too?" Zhou Tian's eyes widened. He stared at "can consume death count," reading it repeatedly. A probabilistic skill could be substituted with revival counts? Although there were many restrictions, and he couldn't issue commands like "suicide," it was still incredibly powerful.

Was there even a need to think? Compared to the other two skills, he would definitely choose this one. Revival counts were just sitting there anyway.

He put a skill point into [Holy Word]. Just like last time, the other skills moved into the lower skill bar, while [Holy Word] remained illuminated.

A wave of understanding flooded his mind. Facing a nearby table, Zhou Tian said, "Fall!"

Nothing happened. One use of [Holy Word] had already been consumed. [Holy Word] could be used not only on living beings but also on inanimate objects.

"Fall!"

Still nothing. Zhou Tian's face twitched. How was this random probability calculated? On a mere table, he had only spoken one word to increase the success rate, so why couldn't it succeed?

Just as he was about to use [Holy Word] with the revival count boost, feedback reminded him that his revival counts for today were already used up. He used his last remaining use on the table.

"Fall!"

He had given up all hope, but to Zhou Tian's dumbfounded gaze, the four-legged table, like a tortoise, flipped itself over and landed on the ground...

"This is... truly incredible..."

He picked up the table. After all that fiddling, he was tired. Lying on the bed, he thought about those "good people" who had granted him three death counts.

"Don't stop, brothers, keep it up! My death counts depend on you..."

He drifted off to sleep in a daze.

In a cultivation chamber within the Qin Royal Estate, Tian Ling closed her eyes. Her body emitted light, and runes swirled around her as spiritual energy poured into her. For some reason, her heart suddenly felt calm.
