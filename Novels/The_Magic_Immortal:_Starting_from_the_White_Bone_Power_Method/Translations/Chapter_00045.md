# Chapter 45: Soul Suppression Talisman

Half an hour later, Ning Jingming sat in the courtyard sipping tea while watching the three-tailed black cat play with the Miaokong Crane. 

Suddenly, he glanced up at the sky, wondering—after all this time, what exactly were that man and woman doing alone in the underground chamber? Were they truly passing down techniques, or had they secretly engaged in other activities behind his back?

Just as this thought crossed his mind, the creaking sound of a door echoed from inside.

Wang Chan emerged from the basement, looking refreshed and thoroughly satisfied, his face beaming with the joy of a fruitful harvest, his steps light as if floating on air.

Following closely behind him was Qu Lian, her pale face tinged with an unusual flush that lent her a peculiar beauty.

Ning Jingming glanced between Wang Chan and Qu Lian, his mind conjuring up some unspoken images as the corner of his mouth twitched slightly.

"Brother Ning, sorry to keep you waiting," Wang Chan said with a smile, stepping forward.

"Brother Wang, no need for such formalities. Congratulations on acquiring two new techniques," Ning Jingming replied with a cupped-hand salute.

"Although both Daoist Wang and Daoist Ning possess astonishing magical abilities and have resolved the issue of the Corpse Ghost Insect's larvae, this matter was ultimately my oversight. I had no idea the Corpse Ghost Insect concealed such a hidden method, causing trouble for both of you," Qu Lian interjected calmly, producing two jade boxes. 

"Inside these boxes is a mid-grade [Soul Suppression Talisman], a small token of my apology."

A mid-grade [Soul Suppression Talisman], as the name suggested, was a talisman that could be embedded within one's soul to protect it. 

If one were suddenly subjected to formless soul attacks, this talisman would activate to shield its bearer.

This item was far rarer than ordinary mid-grade talismans. In terms of value, even three fully inscribed mid-grade [Diamond Talismans] couldn't compare—it was truly priceless in the market.

The reason was simple: few cultivators specialized in soul techniques.

And among those who did, even fewer were capable of crafting mid-grade talismans.

It was unclear where Qu Lian had obtained this mid-grade Soul Suppression Talisman—or if she had crafted it herself.

Was she showcasing her value?

Tsk tsk. A mid-grade talisman master skilled in crafting Soul Suppression Talismans, and also a high-grade physician—no wonder she could afford two sets of mid-grade formations.

Wang Chan pondered this but didn't press further. He merely made a mental note to probe subtly in the future, hoping to purchase a few more of these talismans from her to keep as reserves.

Originally, Qu Lian had not only provided compensation in advance but had even gifted him [Water-Fire Escape Technique]. Any lingering dissatisfaction in Wang Chan's heart had long since dissipated.

Yet, he hadn't expected Qu Lian to be so principled, offering additional compensation afterward.

Payment was payment, friendship was friendship, and compensation was compensation—everything was clearly delineated.

Such grace and bearing—if someone claimed she was a rogue cultivator, Wang Chan wouldn't believe it even if beaten to death.

Especially recalling the experience of inheriting techniques earlier, he became even more convinced of his suspicions.

Since she was generous enough to give, Wang Chan saw no reason to refuse. There would be plenty of opportunities for future interactions.

On the other side, Ning Jingming also gave a slight cupped-hand salute before unceremoniously storing the jade box in his storage pouch.

Soon after, the three agreed to meet again in a year for the second round of Corpse Ghost Insect purification.

With that settled, Wang and Ning hastily descended the mountain.

Qu Lian saw them off at the gate.

Once the two were gone, Qu Lian reactivated the courtyard's defensive formation and returned to the underground chamber. There, she deployed another formation atop the mid-grade [Small Mountain Chain Formation].

As this new formation activated, a heart-palpitating pressure emerged. A faint crimson barrier shimmered into existence, adorned with flowing scarlet mountain silhouettes—an extraordinary sight.

After weaving a few hand seals into the crimson barrier, Qu Lian sat down cross-legged once more.

A faint smile graced her lips as she basked in her good mood.

"After searching high and low, who would have thought that rather handsome Daoist Wang would possess the Profound Yin Needle and excel in Profound Yin Seals?" an elderly woman's voice suddenly echoed in her mind.

"Indeed. That's precisely why I deliberately befriended him. The Profound Yin energy is renowned, and the artifact seals capable of harnessing it must be exceptionally advanced," Qu Lian murmured, her bright eyes glinting with anticipation. 

"With his help, not only will resolving the Corpse Ghost Insect issue be effortless, but before reaching Foundation Establishment, we might even make another trip to that place."

"Ning Jingming is of little consequence. Though his conditions were unexpected, they pose no real trouble... But as for Wang Chan, since you've already passed down [Thunder Seal Curse] and [Water-Fire Escape Technique] to him, what do you plan to do?" The old woman paused before abruptly changing the subject.

Qu Lian, seemingly fatigued, didn't answer immediately. Instead, she took a sip of spiritual liquid before responding coolly, "I can't very well violate our agreement and kill him, can I? Though it's possible... it would go against my principles."

"Ordinary technique inheritances are one thing, but those three powerful mid-grade techniques are ancestral legacies—foundations for cultivating second and third-tier spells. According to ancestral teachings, they should never be passed to outsiders."

"Ancestral teachings... The Qu family consists of only me now," Qu Lian murmured, her gaze distant.

"Ah..."

"The Corpse Ghost Insect matter can't be delayed any longer. And compared to others, he is currently the safest choice for sealing." Qu Lian's tone turned decisive. "Two mid-grade techniques are nothing. If he reaches Foundation Establishment and proves useful, why not pass him second-tier techniques as well?"

"Though that may be so," the old woman sighed, "Wang Chan is but a rogue cultivator with shallow roots and mediocre aptitude. While his artifact inheritance is decent, reaching Qi Refinement perfection won't be an issue. But achieving Foundation Establishment? Highly unlikely."

"I sense an unusual aura about him. Foundation Establishment may not be beyond his reach," Qu Lian countered with a smile. 

"If circumstances allow, let's offer him some support. Should he one day rise to prominence, we can take him in as a retainer."

"A retainer... How I long to see the Qu family restored to its former glory." The old woman sighed repeatedly. "With your foundation, talent, and these opportunities, you may yet become a Yang Spirit Great True Monarch!"

"That path is long and arduous," Qu Lian said soberly. "But I will tread each step carefully."

"The path of cultivation is indeed long and difficult. But if you find a worthy Dao companion to walk it with you—"

"Who could possibly walk this path with me?" Qu Lian fell silent for a moment before stating firmly, "The Great Dao is meant to be walked alone!"

...

...

The waxing and waning of the moon marked the passage of three months.

In a simply arranged underground chamber, a low-grade [Breath Isolation Talisman] was affixed to the door, emitting a milky white membrane that merged with the formation's barrier.

As Wang Chan exhaled, the sinister energy dispersing from him was completely concealed by this membrane.

The walls were further reinforced with low-grade Earth Prison Talismans. Though inactive, they would instantly transform into formidable defenses if the chamber came under external attack.

Four hours of cultivation passed in the blink of an eye.

Wang Chan gently stored the now-dim spiritual bone before him into his storage pouch, then stretched lazily with a contented murmur: "So satisfying..."

As was his habit, he slapped a low-grade Purification Talisman onto his forehead before turning his attention to the virtual status panel.

"Sixteen strands of magical power... Heh, the black market opens in two days. Once I exchange those spoils for spirit coins and replenish my medicinal baths—maybe even use some elixirs—cultivation will become even more comfortable..."

Wang Chan mused with anticipation as he turned his focus inward. In his dantian, sixteen thick, gray serpent-like strands of magical power coiled and played, bringing a faint smile to his lips.
