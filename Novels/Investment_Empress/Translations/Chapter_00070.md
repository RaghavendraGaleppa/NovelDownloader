# Chapter 70: An Agreement with the Ice Cube, See You in the Finals

“My precious disciple has been so tired lately, never home during the day,” Shang Wu grumbled, watching the busy figure in the kitchen. “Who knows what he’s been up to.” Her esteemed master remained completely oblivious to Little Li’s progress.

“He should be practicing his sword.” Ying Bing retracted her gaze. These past few days, she had become increasingly certain that Li Mo’s ability to ask those questions last time was no mere coincidence. Every day, Li Mo would pose new questions about the Way of the Sword, many of which were deeper extensions of previous day’s queries. What did this signify? It meant he hadn’t been slacking off. After their discussions, he diligently practiced and studied, which was why he left early and returned late each day.

“He’s that diligent?” Shang Wu blinked, a little bewildered.

“Very diligent,” Ying Bing replied. A flicker of appreciation passed through the beautiful eyes reflected in her teacup. If she were asked what she relied on to ascend to the Nine Heavens in her previous life—was it a heaven-defying physique? Peerless talent? No. For those truly qualified to reach the pinnacle of martial arts, those were merely icing on the cake. Only perseverance. This was the most precious treasure, both easiest to obtain and easiest to lose, for anyone striving against the current in the long river of martial arts.

“Oh? Then he must have made great progress recently,” Shang Wu exclaimed, her face flushed and her apricot eyes gleaming. “Then this time at the Nine Peaks Grand Competition, my Qunyu Peak will finally be able to make people sit up and take notice!” Actually, “make people sit up and take notice” wasn’t entirely accurate. Qunyu Peak hadn’t even participated for many years... Shang Wu had been coveting the rewards of the Nine Peaks Grand Competition for a long time. Based on a disciple’s ranking in the competition, the sect would bestow generous resource rewards, including but not limited to martial arts techniques, elixirs, and rare treasures.

“I wonder what kind of reward the champion of this competition will receive,” Shang Wu mused, her thoughts growing increasingly fanciful. The champion of the Grand Competition would become the contemporary Chief Disciple of Qingyuan Sect. The magnitude of the rewards would be even more exaggerated.

“Rewards…” Ying Bing refilled her tea cup, her thoughts drifting far away. She couldn’t recall the other rewards too clearly. But there was one item that the top three participants of every previous competition received: the qualification to choose a unique absolute technique. Thinking of this, Ying Bing gently stroked the Heavenly Frost Sword. The sword art of the Heavenly Frost Sword’s first owner was among the unique absolute techniques, as was that of the Scarlet Heaven Sword. Those two unique absolute sword arts complemented each other, capable of resonating and mutually verifying each other. To be precise, it was actually a single sword art: the *Sun and Moon Conjunction Sword Art*, originating from Tianshan Sword Manor. This was originally a martial art meant for two individuals to merge their spirits through swords and progress together. Throughout generations, many in Qingyuan Sect had attempted to recreate the might of the two swords combining, but all had failed. The root cause was that they were all chasing the superficial rather than the fundamental.

“Dinner’s almost ready, come give me a hand,” Chef Li’s voice called from the kitchen. Ying Bing set down Heavenly Frost and walked into the kitchen. They were having hotpot tonight, and the broth was already seasoned. Li Mo, his back to the door, was diligently slicing ingredients.

“Li Mo.”

“Hmm? Oh right, you don’t eat chili peppers lately, do you?” Li Mo was focused, not turning his head.

“No. How is your cultivation now?” Ying Bing asked.

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, then hesitantly replied, “Blood Vitality Realm, late-stage peak, grand completion?”

Ying Bing: “?” *Couldn’t you just say Blood Vitality Realm perfect completion? Where did all those suffixes come from?*

Actually, Little Li had his difficulties. Most people only had twelve meridians when they reached Blood Vitality Realm perfect completion, but he had opened thirty-five main meridians. Clearly, his situation couldn’t be compared to a normal Blood Vitality Realm perfect completion.

“Then I won’t add chili. We’ll have a clear broth hotpot tonight.” Li Mo, also curious, asked, “How is your progress?”

“I will reach the Inner Breath Realm tonight.”

“Let’s add some chili after all. It’s not hotpot without chili.” Ying Bing’s tone was calm, yet as firm as if it were a foregone conclusion, completely devoid of any consideration for failure in breaking through.

Little Li was not surprised by this answer. It was just the Ice Cube’s usual performance.

“As expected, you won’t stay in the Inner Breath Realm for long. How are your preparations for the Nine Peaks Grand Competition? I’ll put in extra garlic, I love garlic.”

“I will be the champion of the Nine Peaks Grand Competition.”

“You can make yourself a garlic dipping sauce.”

The scene was, in a word, peculiar. Earth-shattering declarations were interspersed with discussions about whether to add chili or garlic to the hotpot. Neither party found anything amiss.

“You’ve also made great progress recently,” Ying Bing said softly, enveloping the minced garlic in a small bowl with a shimmering glow.

“Compared to you, it’s nothing.” As a descendant of Yanhuang, Little Li always upheld the traditional virtue of humility.

“No need to be modest. I can sense your progress.” Ying Bing’s eyes reflected Li Mo’s busy back as she softly said, “Among our peers, apart from me, your attainments in the Way of the Sword are unmatched. You have a good chance of contending for a high ranking.”

Li Mo paused his actions, then chuckled indifferently. “Why bother contending for such things?”

“You’re not hoping to meet me in the finals, are you?” Little Li genuinely wasn’t very interested in vying for rankings. He wasn’t lacking in the sect’s rewards.

“I hope you make it into the top three.” Suddenly, a voice like jade pearls dropping rang out.

*Clang!*

Li Mo froze, then turned his head. The young girl stood at the doorway, holding the hotpot. Moonlight streamed from behind her, illuminating her icy skin and jade bones with a clear radiance. The night wind brushed past, making the clothes her mother had sewn for her ripple…

“Alright, we’ll meet in the finals,” Li Mo nodded.

“Mm.” Ying Bing lowered her gaze and nodded.

Listening to her footsteps recede, Little Li finally turned back, looking at the chipped cleaver in his hand and muttering, “It would have been quite a mood killer to ask why just now, wouldn’t it?” *Forget it.* Although he didn’t know why the Ice Cube had such expectations of him, since he’d agreed, he would do it. His attainments in the Way of the Sword truly weren’t as high as the Ice Cube imagined, but if push came to shove… he’d just pull out his hammer.

***

The pleasant dinner time at Autumn Water Pavilion concluded. Everyone retired to their rooms. Li Mo, however, slipped out in the dark. He was already exhausted today, but he intended to train extra. After all, he was getting closer and closer to the Inner Breath Realm, and he was a little excited, curious to know what kind of world awaited him there.

The night deepened. *Gurgle, gurgle—* The water in the stone pool suddenly boiled. The medicinal power of the Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk, like starlight, regularly flowed into his body with his breaths.

In his Dantian, nourished by the abundant Earth Vein essence, the last lotus seed was finally planted. All thirty-six lotus seeds within his body were perfectly round and lustrous, emitting precious light and surging with dragon-like blood vitality.

Li Mo did not stop. Utilizing the remaining Earth Vein essence, he began to attempt breaking through to the Inner Breath Realm. According to the description of the *Heart Fire Lotus Birth Technique*, success meant the lotus seeds breaking open, taking root, sprouting, and absorbing blood vitality to transform into Inner Breath.

However, Li Mo, who had never encountered a bottleneck before, frowned this time.

“I can’t transform my blood vitality into Inner Breath?”

“Has the Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Essence become useless? No… it doesn’t seem to be that…” He opened his eyes, and a scorching spark flickered in his pupils. He sensed his condition and pondered. The effect of the Earth Vein essence was still potent; that wasn’t the problem. The problem lay with him. He couldn’t condense his blood vitality into Inner Breath. The blood vitality of thirty-six main meridians was simply too vast. Perhaps the founder of the *Heart Fire Lotus Birth Technique* never imagined a freak who would condense thirty-six lotus seeds, and thus never considered such a situation.

“A high-grade cultivation method isn’t enough.”

“I still have a Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal, though.” Li Mo thought for a moment and took out a Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal he had acquired from Little Princess Jiang.
