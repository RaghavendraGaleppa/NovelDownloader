# Chapter 598: A Single Sentence, Loyalty!

It was indeed Qingyuan True Monarch.

“Xu Yunfan…”

Qingyuan True Monarch’s gaze fell upon him, making Xu Yunfan’s body involuntarily feel slightly heavier.

That gaze carried weight.

The pressure came from the status of a True Monarch’s Dao Fruit.

However, what truly put Xu Yunfan’s mind at ease was that the item hidden within the Star Spirit Banner, concealed by multiple layers of karma secret techniques, had ultimately gone undetected. It was mostly just the True Monarch’s status displaying its might.

If Qingyuan True Monarch had seen the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit Xu Yunfan possessed, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

As long as the other party didn’t take the Star Spirit Banner, there should be no trouble.

And the Star Spirit Banner counted as his lifebound magic treasure. With the dignity of a True Monarch, he naturally wouldn't care about a mere Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

These people had long since transcended vulgar tastes and naturally looked down on such things.

Excellent!

Then, a calm yet soul-shaking voice echoed directly within the hall. Qingyuan True Monarch nodded slightly toward Xu Yunfan.

“You have done well. In this campaign, you were the first to breach the core Heavenly Court of this world. The merit of guiding the way makes you the vanguard. In this expedition to conquer the realms, among the core disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, you are a model. This Seat shall record your merit as the first.”

In a few short sentences, Qingyuan True Monarch affirmed Xu Yunfan’s most critical contribution in conquering the Heavenly Realm, highlighting the weight of being the first to breach the gates.

After all, Xu Yunfan was a subordinate under his command. If one wants the horse to run, one must feed it well.

With the merit of breaching a world, one could say that Xu Yunfan could exchange for anything he wanted within the Primordial Origin Sect.

Xu Yunfan felt a flicker of joy in his heart, but his expression became even more respectful as he bowed again.

“True Monarch, you overpraise me! The breakthrough in this situation relied entirely on the Sect’s might, as well as the True Monarch’s strategies beforehand and the joint efforts of my senior brothers at my side. This disciple merely happened to be in the right place at the right time, borrowing some geographical advantage and a bit of luck to barely seize a fleeting opportunity. How could I dare claim such great merit?”

This speech was appropriate and humble, attributing the main credit to Qingyuan True Monarch and the grand strategy of the Primordial Origin Sect.

His attitude was modest, showing no desire to claim credit.

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s humble words, Qingyuan True Monarch felt even more satisfied in his heart.

Naturally, leaders hope their subordinates offer plenty of flattery.

This is called providing sufficient emotional value.

As a former corporate worker, Xu Yunfan was quite familiar with this.

Qingyuan True Monarch sat high upon the cloud platform, his face as impassive as an ancient well, showing no hint of joy or anger, but inwardly, he was naturally very satisfied with Xu Yunfan.

Those who knew how to carry a conversation like this belonged to the category of the sensible.

The disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect were far too eccentric; he didn't even know how many he had killed. Having a normal person among them now was a form of psychological comfort.

Then, Qingyuan True Monarch’s eyes brightened slightly. Xu Yunfan felt his body go slightly numb. Before he could react, he saw Qingyuan True Monarch looking at him with some surprise.

Xu Yunfan naturally realized that Qingyuan True Monarch had detected that he had already stepped into the late Foundation Establishment stage.

According to normal cultivation speed, Xu Yunfan had achieved Foundation Establishment in just one lifetime, which was truly extraordinary.

Qingyuan True Monarch fell silent for a moment.

His gaze was as deep as an abyss, sweeping over Xu Yunfan’s body with apparent calm. The thick aura of the late Foundation Establishment stage was completely visible to him.

This boy’s speed of breaking through, while not matching those peerless geniuses of ten thousand years, was already at the top among the disciples of his generation.

“Are you really not the reincarnation of another True Person from my Primordial Origin Sect?”

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan said seriously, “True Monarch, please discern the truth. I am indeed not.”

Qingyuan True Monarch looked utterly unconvinced, assuming that Xu Yunfan probably had too many enemies and thus severed his ties with his past life.

Xu Yunfan: “...”

I really am not.

Most of the True Persons of the Primordial Origin Sect have undergone five cycles of reincarnation. Many have severed their ties with their past lives, even destroying every last trace of what they used in their previous lives, precisely to prevent enemies from finding them.

After all, there was a reason why the Primordial Origin Sect was called the Primordial Demon Sect by the world.

Qingyuan True Monarch pondered slightly.

He had originally wanted Xu Yunfan to do something.

This matter involved both risk and opportunity, relating to his subsequent plans to advance to the mid Golden Core stage and the crucial matter of suspending his Cave Heaven high without letting it fall. He had intended to entrust this task to Xu Yunfan, relying on his strange luck and the courage of being the first to breach the gates.

But upon learning that Xu Yunfan and the Pure Yang True Monarch of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect came from the same sect in the Divine Martial Realm, he now felt a bit of regret.

Pure Yang True Monarch!

That was a figure even he had to treat with caution.

A thousand years ago, his brilliance shocked the world, and now his cultivation is even more unfathomable.

Although Xu Yunfan was only a junior from the same realm, and the Primordial Origin Sect has always been inclusive, not caring much if its disciples have connections with other sects—even having no shortage of undercover agents or resource exchanges.

“Who among the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect doesn’t have some secrets or background?”

But entrusting a core, confidential task requiring absolute control to someone who might have a special connection with a True Monarch of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, and who might even be viewed favorably by him, suddenly raised the risk factor significantly.

If his heart wavered slightly, or if Pure Yang True Monarch gave an order, the key chess piece he had carefully laid out could easily slip out of his control, or even become a hidden danger.

This boy’s aptitude and temperament were both top-notch, and it was rare for him to have such great fortune. It was a pity that he couldn't be used with full confidence.

He pondered for a moment before speaking slowly.

“I have a stroke of fortune to give you, allowing you to sense the Immortal Gold Nature ahead of time and refine it.”

Qingyuan True Monarch’s thoughts raced. Since that core matter needed to be thought of differently, he might as well use this fortune to bind this person firmly to him first.

His voice remained calm, but carried an undeniable tone.

“Your merit as the vanguard this time, the Sect will naturally grant a generous reward. Seeing that your cultivation has advanced and your foundation is stable, I see a bright path ahead for your Dao. I now grant you a stroke of fortune to help you perceive the mysteries of the Immortal Gold Nature ahead of time, laying the foundation for refining your own Gold Nature in the future.”

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan naturally expressed surprise. He certainly wouldn't reveal that he had already obtained a trace of Taiyin Immortal Gold Nature from the Heavenly Empress of the Heavenly Realm.

He instantly adopted the demeanor of a top actor, his eyes widening immediately, and a look of uncontrollable excitement and being overwhelmed by favor surged onto his face. Even his voice carried a perfectly appropriate tremble.

“Th... thank you for your generous reward, True Monarch! This disciple... this disciple is moved to tears!”

He hurriedly bowed, his hands trembling slightly as he cupped them in salute.

In reality, his mind was perfectly clear.

“Immortal Gold Nature? I’ve already obtained a trace of it within the Taiyin Dao Fruit! If this fortune truly allows one to refine Immortal Gold Nature, I can use it to confuse the situation, making the True Monarch believe that I am utterly dependent on and thirsty for his gift.”

His thoughts raced. The Heavenly Empress’s soul and the trace of Taiyin Immortal Gold Nature within the Star Spirit Banner were concealed by layers of secret techniques, leaving not a single gap.

With the fortune granted by Qingyuan True Monarch this time, he had a perfect explanation for the speed at which he would display his comprehension of the Gold Nature laws in the future.

The Divine霄 Dao Fruit was still far out of reach, but the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit was firmly in his pocket.

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s appearance, Qingyuan True Monarch secretly nodded. He was indeed sensible.

He changed the subject and spoke frankly.

“You have a relationship with the Pure Yang True Monarch of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, so I was a bit hesitant.”

But seeing Xu Yunfan’s excited and sincere appearance just now, Qingyuan True Monarch secretly nodded.
