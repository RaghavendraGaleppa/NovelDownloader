Chapter 294: From Poverty to Wealth, Astonishing Methods, The Shepherd Fish Book, and the Mysterious Woman!

Li Xian smiled and said, "Elder Han, you come here offering yourself and even proposing marriage. In the end, it all comes down to benefits." Han Zisha remained silent, put down her tea cup, and rolled her eyes.

Li Xian continued, "I am a newcomer with a shallow foundation. I originally didn't dare to possess such a fortune, but since Envoy Shi places high hopes on me, I have no choice but to accept it reluctantly to live up to her expectations. A few days ago, I went to inspect the site, and the honey production is abundant. Since Elder Han has come in the middle of the night, I can't let you make a trip for nothing. If Elder Han is willing, we can cooperate sincerely and seek benefits together."

Ever since inspecting the apiary, he had been thinking about how to make money. The biggest problem was the lack of 'boat transport'. It was difficult to enter and exit the Water Jar. Li Xian had no flower boat, and despite having a stockpile of Runsu Honey, he couldn't transport it out for sale. He truly needed to cooperate with an elder to borrow their flower boat for sales.

Han Zisha understood instantly. Her eyes darted around, her eyebrows curved, and she looked at him with great interest. After a while, she laughed, "Oh, oh, so you don't have a flower boat. Since you've pleaded with me, this elder will naturally agree. But you must know, water transport is quite troublesome, involving significant manpower and material resources. It's exhausting to make a trip."

"As an elder, I can't be helping a disciple for nothing, right?"

Li Xian said, "Of course. We'll split the profits seven-three. I'll take seven, you take three." Han Zisha smiled faintly, "Flower boy, you don't understand the situation. Since you have no flower boat, the apiary and the fruit orchard are just white elephants. If I don't help you transport them out, you won't get a single cent. No matter how much honey and fruit you produce, it will just rot in the ground. Considering the stakes, it should be an eighty-twenty split. I'll take eight, you take two."

She had been trying to seduce and tempt him with profit, and hadn't thought carefully about Li Xian's dilemma. But now, negotiating again, she had found Li Xian's fatal weakness, and she felt confident of victory once more. She didn't need seduction or profit; she had already got him figured.

She thought, "You cunning little brat. You don't even have a flower boat and you want to negotiate with me? Just wait and see how I'll clean you out."

Li Xian said calmly with a smile, "In that case, Elder Han, please return." Han Zisha was taken aback and said, "What do you mean?"

Li Xian said, "Naturally, we haven't reached an agreement." He sipped his tea indifferently, remaining composed throughout. Han Zisha sneered, "Flower boy, you're too young. You don't understand the situation. If you can't even agree with me, it will be even harder to agree with other elders. The apiary and the fruit orchard are yours, that's true. But the Water Jar is isolated from the world. To put it bluntly, in this cooperation, it should be you begging me."

Li Xian laughed, "Elder Han, since we've come to this, I'll be straightforward with you. If it were someone else, what you said would be true. Unfortunately, I am Huo Wucuo, so there are some exceptions."

Han Zisha frowned and pondered, "This brat is so calm. Is he confident? He says he has exceptions. Could it be his background is extraordinary. Ah, his relationship with Envoy Shi is not simple. Is it..." She felt a surge of suspicion.

Li Xian added, "I originally wanted to make a peaceful fortune with Elder Han for mutual benefit. It would also be a way to build connections. Since Elder Han thinks I'm begging you, then please return."

Han Zisha frowned tightly, truly unsure if Li Xian was bluffing or if he was confident. She thought it over again, "Let's not worry about the others. I'll still profit from this, it's just a matter of how much. I'll pretend to agree for now, then slowly observe this boy. If he's just bluffing, I'll raise the price then and take back the principal and interest with profit." She smiled sweetly and said, "Flower boy, I was just joking with you earlier. How about this, let's go with the seven-three split."

Li Xian smiled, "Good." Han Zisha got up to leave, raised her eyebrows and smiled, "Besides, if you want to come find me, you can do so anytime. Anyway, this elder is always free and very lonely. How about... come back with me now?"

She was bewitching and seductive.

Li Xian smiled and declined, seeing Han Zisha out of his residence. After the negotiation today, the stockpiled "Runsu Honey" had a channel for sale. In the following days, Li Xian and Han Zisha went to inspect the bee island several times. The Runsu Honey had been stockpiled for 'two or three' months, totaling over four thousand pounds, which could fetch nearly three thousand taels of silver.

Li Xian gave up three-tenths, leaving him with over two thousand taels. After paying labor costs and other miscellaneous expenses, he ended up with about one thousand six hundred taels. Han Zisha also had an apiary and a flower field. Every time she took the flower boat out, she would sell 'Runxin Cream', 'Brewed Flower Dried', 'Flower Oil', and other items. Helping Li Xian sell the Runsu Honey took very little effort; it was almost free money.

Don't be fooled by how extravagantly martial artists spend money. Furnishing a residence, cooking fine food, and daily consumption are all extremely luxurious, but they are actually very stingy. To be able to earn an extra thousand taels for no reason is a truly joyous event. The bandits' den next to Black River Village, relying on plundering the common people, only accumulated dozens of taels a month.

A year of frugality would only be enough to buy 'Smokeless Coal'. With a low-quality cauldron and cooking low-quality refined food, their cultivation would not progress for a long time. A wealthy manor like Wen Caishang's is truly rare. Five hundred coins can buy a life, so the value of a thousand taels can be imagined.

Han Zisha was responsible for water transport, and the round trip took ten days. She was overjoyed when making money, but when it came to paying, she became difficult. She delayed several times, but fearing Li Xian's complaint, she still followed the contract and split the money with Li Xian. In this way, Li Xian had escaped poverty and become wealthy. The first thing he did was to decorate his residence.

First, he bought grass and transplanted it into the courtyard. Then, he bought flowers and plants, and built streams and rockeries, ornamental stone pavilions, soft sitting cushions, bookshelves, and appreciation porcelain... Nan Gong Qiu Li directed the coming and going workers, making the courtyard look brand new. The originally yellow mud ground turned into a green, vibrant grassland. This kind of grass was soft in texture, durable to tread on, and felt even more comfortable and soft when lying on it.

Filling the courtyard with scenery made both the mind and spirit joyful.

More importantly, Li Xian and Nan Gong Qiu Li were gradually becoming proficient in the 'Five Elements Strange Evasion'. They had long wanted to arrange the Five Elements. But because the family was poor, the courtyard was empty, with very few Five Elements elements. 'A clever housewife cannot cook without rice'. Even Yan Hao would find it difficult to arrange the Five Elements Strange Evasion without the right environment. Now, the residence had complete scenery, beautiful and quiet. Grass, trees, stones, and water were everywhere, allowing them to use the various courtyard scenes to arrange a Five Elements maze.

The Five Elements Command Flags were put to great use, inserted among the grass and trees in the courtyard. This made the front and back of the residence have five layers of mazes, corresponding to the Five Elements respectively. In this way, although the residence was not large, it was very safe and comfortable. Living inside, with the Five Elements complete and the Feng Shui flowing, it was like a small world, naturally indescribably comfortable.

Nan Gong Qiu Li began to arrange things, gradually developing a sense of belonging. In her spare time, she would water the flowers and take care of them. Seeing life getting better day by day, she felt a great sense of satisfaction, as if she had started from scratch, following her poor husband, managing step by step, and accumulating wealth.

Nan Gong Qiu Li held the 'Gold Flag'. By waving the Gold Flag, she could manipulate the Five Elements in the courtyard, equivalent to holding the structure of the maze. If an outsider broke in, she didn't need to show herself; she could use the Five Elements Strange Evasion to trap them. Her Five Elements Strange Evasion was already considered to have achieved some success, but compared to Li Xian, it was far inferior.

Occasionally, when her playful side emerged, she would control the Five Elements in the courtyard, deliberately blocking Li Xian. But Li Xian would always solve it very quickly and would inevitably impose severe punishment. This made Nan Gong Qiu Li dream of the basement of the flower boat again, but she didn't feel afraid; instead, she became even more audacious.

It was unclear if it was because she was unconvinced or because she enjoyed it, or if she had another purpose.

Days passed like this. Li Xian's strength accumulated, gathering water drops into a lake. The 'Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian' had a proficiency of [5685/8000 Minor Success], and the 'Residual Demon Spear Technique' was [3655/15000 Great Success]. The once desolate house and ruined residence now had streams and rockeries, with a beautiful woman accompanying him.

He stably accumulated his strength.

The only drawback was that the 'Refined Food' was depleted. At this rate of earning money, it would take several months to barely start the cauldron. Li Xian wasn't in a hurry. A steady stream of income, diligently honing his martial path, could also increase his strength.

He now had more and more trump cards. The Residual Demon Spear and the Residual Sun Declining Blood Sword were both extremely powerful. Nan Gong Qiu Li strictly adhered to her family's rules; her family's martial arts were not easily passed on to outsiders. But she couldn't resist the long-term contact with Li Xian. Even an iron heart would be worn soft over time. Sometimes, when their passion was at its peak, Li Xian would ask her anything, and she would be willing to tell him. But Li Xian wasn't in a hurry to ask; he focused his heart on studying the Residual Demon Spear and honing the martial arts he had learned.

One day.

Li Xian suddenly received news.

Recently, the water bandits in the Dongran Lake had become increasingly rampant. They killed passing fishermen, causing the righteous sects around to want to enter the lake to围剿 and kill them. This affected the flower cage sect's boat transport, so they set up a bounty, calling for flower thieves to kill the evil bandits at the 'Water Gold Nest'.

Flower thieves killing water bandits is truly a rare event. Li Xian saw that the reward was generous. A water bandit's head could be exchanged for a merit coin. If he killed the leader, he could get a tael of merit silver.

He responded to the call, went to the "Flower Appreciation Tower" to get a "Water Map". Following the water map, he could quietly reach the Water Gold Nest. He prepared his bow and arrows, rented a small boat, and set off along the water map to kill.

The Water Gold Nest was located in a maze of water forests. The water bandits were of all shapes and sizes, but they all had black fluff on their faces, their eyes hidden with ferocity, and their bodies were full of fishy and rotten smells. Water bandits blocking the way and intercepting people, although hateful and despicable, happened from time to time. The Great Wu Dynasty was in decline and unable to manage the territory. It was difficult to eliminate all the mountain bandits, let alone the water bandits who ran rampant. Disciples of famous and righteous sects would often enter the Dongran Lake to kill bandits for training and to promote their reputation.

But the Water Gold Nest had been acting too aggressively recently, continuously intercepting three merchant ships, causing hundreds of people to go missing. Among these merchant ships, there were no lack of powerful martial artists. If they were to fight head-on, the Water Gold Nest would be no match at all.

The Water Gold Nest raised "Golden Beak Fish", which came in nests and liked to gnaw at the bottom of ships. They also knew how to combine the terrain and water advantages, set up traps along the way, and cast iron nets in the water. Any merchant ship passing through their area would have a leaky bottom, panic, and inevitably jump into the water to escape.

There were iron nets in the water, tangling their hands and feet. They would be caught like fish.

This method was tried and true, even second-rank martial artists were captured.

Li Xian boarded a boat and secretly approached the Water Gold Nest.

This place was actually a relatively deep part of the Dongran Lake. It was neither an island nor a swamp. Instead, countless water trees grew from the bottom of the lake, with vines and roots connecting each other, thick and sturdy, gradually forming an environment where one could stand, walk, and climb. The Water Gold Nest built wooden houses on these roots as their base.

Li Xian sneaked in, observing with his dual-pupil vision. He saw several water tree canopies hiding water bandits on lookout, extremely well-hidden. This place was easy to defend and hard to attack. If a strong enemy appeared, the water bandits would jump into the lake. The roots of the trees in the lake were tangled and chaotic. They would scurry east and escape west; who could catch them? They had fully taken advantage of the terrain.

He was eager to try and wasn't impatient. He secretly bypassed the sentries, climbed up a water tree, and used the dense canopy to hide his figure.

He found a bird's nest in the tree. A clever idea struck him. He caught a bird, pulled out a long hair, and inserted it into the bird's feathers. Then he threw it deep into the Water Gold Nest. The bird flapped its wings and flew away. As it passed over the Water Gold Nest, the hair fell, touched the roof tiles, and took root and sprouted.

At the same time, a strand of hair at the Green Ox Residence withered and curled, turning into flying ash. 'Falling Hair Taking Root' could only be maintained for three strands. Li Xian focused his energy, sensing through the hair's senses. After the hair took root, it had a sense of hearing, sight, and touch... but the vision was blurry, as if covered in a thick fog. It was hard to see the number of enemies clearly. He thought that at night, the patrollers would definitely carry torches. The firelight would be bright, and the hair's senses would be clear. Then he could know the layout of the nest and the patrol positions. With his dual-pupil vision, he could come and go freely.

He waited quietly until night.

The nest indeed lit up with firelight. Li Xian sensed through the hair. Through the firelight, he could vaguely distinguish the distribution of the nest. Combined with the 'dual-pupil'透视, before even entering the nest, he knew the inside and outside clearly.

Li Xian's eyes flashed with a sharp light. With a 'splash', he jumped into the lake. His body sank suddenly, but he could move freely by grabbing the tree roots. Li Xian sneaked to a relatively weak part of the nest, hearing movement above.

Two water bandits were standing on the roots, urinating nearby. They were full of water bandit slang. Li Xian quietly reached out, grabbed the two bandits' ankles, and dragged them into the water. This move was extremely powerful, not even splashing water!

The two bandits struggled violently. Li Xian's body trembled. The Pure Gang Qi Robe slapped the two bandits' chests, instantly crushing their lungs and killing them on the spot. Li Xian wedged the two bandits' bodies between the tree roots to prevent them from floating to the surface. Then he swam to another place.

Since he was testing his skills, he wanted to be thorough. To catch a thief, first catch the king. He needed to kill the bandit leader first. Using his vision and the 'Falling Hair Taking Root', he gradually figured out the location of the bandit leader. He sneaked over and suddenly saw a large tree cage.

It was a round cage formed by tangled tree roots. Inside, dozens of people were soaked in the water, with only their noses barely able to stick out of the water. Li Xian thought, "These people must be the ones captured by the water bandits."

He didn't rush to save them and quietly bypassed them. He saw several more tree cages in succession, holding over a hundred people in total. Men, women, old, and young were all there. The water in this area was very turbid and foul. White maggots and mosquito larvae could be seen writhing in the water. Being soaked like this, even if they didn't die, they would fall seriously ill. Li Xian exhaled a clear breath, using the Pure Gang Qi Robe to cover himself, making the clear breath circulate around his body without dissipating, blocking all the filth outside.

He had gained a lot recently, and the various wonderful uses could be combined. He was invincible and could calmly handle any dangerous situation. Someone in the tree cage saw Li Xian, but it was a fleeting glimpse, and with the foul-smelling water, it was hard to pay attention.

The merchant ship that was broken had four second-rank martial artists on board, who were captured alive by the water bandits. Their situation was miserable, their limbs tied by tree roots, soaked more than ten zhang deep in the water. These tree roots were solid and firm, and being in the water, their Qi power was obstructed. These second-rank martial artists had considerable ability, but there was nothing they could do.

Li Xian took this as a warning and thought to himself, "Even second-rank martial artists are helpless and captured by a group of water bandits. I am already a second-rank martial artist, and many special abilities have manifested around me. But I must constantly hone my martial arts and increase my methods to avoid such a fate."

Martial arts methods depend entirely on martial arts. These second-rank martial artists were entangled and captured by tree roots. If they had learned the family martial arts of the Qiong Tian Fu Embroidered City's Luo family, they could have shaken their bodies to loosen the tree roots and thus break free from the predicament.

He went deeper and saw the wreckage of a merchant ship. Li Xian looked up and observed. The tree roots were intertwined, extending from the water to the surface. He had found the bandit leader and followed him secretly. The bandit leader was tall and broad, with a full beard, very fierce. On his back, he carried a large iron pestle, the end of which was a round ball the size of a head, and the inside seemed to be hollow.

Li Xian waited for him to be alone and suddenly struck from the water. His movements were crisp and clean. With one spear thrust, he attacked. The bandit leader was greatly alarmed and was about to shout for help when he saw Li Xian's spear thrusting towards his throat. The momentum was fierce, shrouded in 'Pure Gang Qi Robe', making the Qi wave seem solid, bringing with it a 'whooshing' wind sound that actually suppressed his shout back into his throat.

It was like a strong wind hitting his face. The moment he opened his mouth, the wind rushed in through his mouth and nose; how could he speak? The bandit leader's shout turned into a roar. He stomped his foot and took out the iron pestle to block. He deliberately used the round ball to block. If the spear tip hit it, it would make a sound from the ball, sending out a strange noise.

Who knew that Li Xian's spear technique was extremely exquisite. Although his martial power was fierce, it hid even more strategy. He suddenly retracted his force, stopping just at the right point. The bandit leader raised his eyebrows, thinking, "Is he all show and no substance?" At this moment, although he could speak, he was fully focused on the fight. Speaking and shouting would be a distraction. He immediately swung the iron pestle to strike.

But he felt that Li Xian's spear tip seemed to have stickiness, attaching to his iron pestle. He couldn't pull it back or strike it out. It turned out... when Li Xian thrust the spear, the Pure Gang Qi Robe contained internal Qi and adhered to the spear body. Although he retracted the spear's force, the Pure Gang Qi Robe rushed out, tightly covering the iron pestle, as if it were bound by a rope.

Li Xian shook the spear body. The Pure Gang Qi Robe trembled, mixed with internal Qi and slapped out. The bandit leader had never seen such a method and didn't know what was happening before he was shaken back several zhang. Li Xian turned around and drew his bow, shooting a wooden arrow. With a crisp and clean movement, it pierced the bandit leader's throat.

An ordinary mortal would have died at this point. The bandit leader had the cultivation of 'Food Essence', and immediately solidified his blood and closed his pores to slow down the injury. The higher the martial realm, the greater the possibility. Nan Gong Qiu Li once said... among the Nine Types of Turbid Clothes, the Golden Lou Jade Clothes could keep a corpse from decaying, and even had the potential for a dead person to come back to life.

Li Xian's spear tip flicked water, stirring up splashes. Then he executed the Azure Luo Palm, striking the splashes. The water splashed 'clattering' down, each drop hitting the acupoints and meridians where the bandit leader needed to activate his blood and dissolve stasis. They contained extremely strong internal Qi.

The bandit leader's throat made a 'puff' sound, and he could no longer suppress the blood. Without being able to say a word, he collapsed and died. Li Xian remained vigilant, shooting several more arrows to confirm the bandit leader was completely dead, then cut off his head and stored it in a place.

His methods were crisp and clean. With this, a tael of merit silver was earned. Li Xian thought, "This opportunity is rare. I need to kill as many water bandits as possible to earn a good amount of merit money." He put away the two arrows, stepped on the Seven Star Steps, and his figure was agile and invisible. He roamed around the nest.

He first looked for isolated water bandits. Three arrows, four arrows, even five arrows shot at once, determined to kill as many as he saw at the same time. His archery had already reached its peak. Archery was different from martial arts. If you could pull the bow, you could shoot the arrow. An ordinary hunter could have a small achievement in archery. But to reach the peak of archery was even more difficult than martial arts. The later stages of archery involved spirit, will, and mind, which were truly hard to practice. It could only be relied on talent.

Li Xian brought his strengths into full play. Silently, he shot and killed three more water bandits. The water bandits in the nest, because they lived in the lake for a long time, had dark skin, wide hands, and black fluff on their faces. They were very easy to distinguish, and there was no chance of killing the wrong person. Li Xian let loose and killed the bandits to earn merit.

His wooden arrows were silent, and his vision was extremely strong. His peak archery, combined with his terrifying vision, made the many water bandits like fish on a chopping block. They were broken down one by one and shot and killed one by one, all silently, without any noise.

Li Xian was also extremely thorough in his work. He hid the killed water bandits underwater, stuffing them into the gaps between the tree roots. He didn't even leave any bloodstains. In the dark night, the number of people quietly decreased by seventy or eighty percent, and no water bandit noticed.

Until late at night. The remaining water bandits felt something was wrong, as if the night was unusually quiet. Suddenly, they felt afraid, their hearts were uneasy, and they didn't know what to do. Some with more courage left their patrol posts on their own to look for the bandit leader. But after wandering around for dozens of circles, they suddenly realized that the usually lively nest was now extremely quiet.

The familiar fellow bandits had disappeared for no reason. No matter how they shouted and called, only echoes returned. When they discovered the cause of it all, a wooden arrow shot over, and their lives ended. Li Xian, like a vengeful ghost, eliminated them from the inside out.

The Water Gold Nest had a total of 'three hundred and twenty-three' water bandits. Li Xian killed them all, not leaving a single one. This ability, even if an elder came, would be difficult, and far inferior to him. Li Xian's many unique traits were hard for others to possess. He confirmed that the cleanup was complete, then, following his memory, he took the water bandits' bodies out of the water.

He had only carried thirty-four arrows to wipe out three hundred and twenty-three water bandits. Afterward, not a single arrow was missing. He had collected so many heads that they were hard to contain. He found a boat, cut off the heads, and arranged them on the boat. It took five boats to barely fit them all.

At this time, the sky was pitch black. From sneaking into the lake to attack to completely wiping them out, it took only one hour. He knew the Dongran Lake was no joke. Traveling by boat at night, losing one's way—if the luck was not bad, one could return to the Water Jar, or, in a muddled way, leave the Dongran Lake.

If the luck was bad, it was perfectly normal to wander in the lake for a lifetime, or to be swallowed by the mysteries of the lake. So, he stayed the night at the nest. He used this spare time to search the bodies one by one for useful items. The ordinary water bandits wore simple clothes, were covered in mud, and had never left the lake. They had neither money nor treasures on them.

Li Xian looked at their clothing. The bandit leader, second-in-command, third-in-command... those with intact clothes and high status could have some good items, like gold, jade, etc. Li Xian accepted them all, thinking they could be exchanged for dozens of taels of silver. He now had to worry about 'Refined Treasures' and valued silver more and more. If he could save it, he wouldn't waste it.

Silver was like flowing water.

A treasure land or method that could generate wealth continuously was the most important thing.

The long night. Li Xian finished searching all the bodies. The night was still deep and quiet. With nothing to do, he wandered around, exploring the nest for treasures. He first went to the bandit leader's room and, after searching, indeed found something. He discovered a box of jewelry, very valuable. It turned out that among the recently hijacked merchant ships, one was a jewelry business.

That merchant ship had the most experts and put up the fiercest resistance. Unfortunately, there was no way to turn the tide. Constrained by the water terrain, they were helpless. The experts on the ship had no choice but to surrender. The rest of the crew and passengers were captured and brought here, now being soaked in the water. The jewelry and utensils on the merchant ship were not just these few boxes. When the ship sank, many beautiful jewelry and utensils sank to the bottom of the lake with it.

It was truly a pity.

Li Xian thought, "This is a windfall. Since I've seen it, I'll find a way to take it. As for the captives, their ship is destroyed, and they might need to be brought back to the Flower Cage Sect. Otherwise, staying here, they would only be trapped to death."

The bandit leader's bedroom was planted with green vines, and the decoration was quite elegant. Li Xian searched around and, when he lifted the pillow, found another incomplete book. Inside the book was a wooden flute. He flipped through the incomplete book and couldn't help but be very delighted.

This incomplete book was named "The Shepherd Fish Book". It was already damaged, and its origin was obscure. It recorded methods for raising, herding, and controlling fish. This wooden flute was the key to herding fish. The book originally recorded the methods for raising and training more than ten types of fish, but because it was incomplete, only the method for the 'Golden Beak Fish' was complete.

Maintenance and breeding, raising fish, controlling fish... many detailed points, of extraordinary value. The Golden Beak Fish was not a natural fish species and could gnaw at metal and iron. The Water Gold Nest could repeatedly restrain second-rank martial artists, and this fish played a great role.

Li Xian quickly put it away, very pleased. Afterwards, he searched the house again and found another 'Water Map', recording how to leave the lake and reach the shore. Li Xian's thoughts churned. He knew he would have to leave the Water Jar eventually. This water map might be useful, but definitely not now.

He took out the Flower Cage Sect's water map. His brow slightly furrowed. If he followed the Water Gold Nest's water map now, starting from here, he could sail away from the Dongran Lake. But if he first returned to the Water Jar, and later, when the time was ripe and he was fully prepared, wanted to travel the same path again—first from the Water Jar to the Water Gold Nest, then from the Water Gold Nest to leave the Dongran Lake—it would be extremely difficult.

Because the water map from the Water Jar to the Water Gold Nest involves the Five Elements and changes constantly. He could follow the water map to find the Water Gold Nest today. If he set out again in two days, following the original route on the water map, he wouldn't be able to reach the Water Gold Nest.

"Forget it, I'll plan slowly. If I run away like this, not to mention myself, Nan Gong Qiu Li would surely scold me to death. I can't just abandon her."

He put the water map away.

The subsequent gains had nothing special, just jewelry and the like. On the way, he also experienced the cruelty of the water bandits. These water bandits lived in the lake for a long time, eating fish. When they got tired of it, they actually thought of cooking people. Their temperaments were brutal, and they wanted to try the taste of 'second-rank martial artists'. One second-rank martial artist died so miserably and became food for the water bandits.

After everything was settled, Li Xian lay on the canopy of the water tree, practicing his five organs internally, moving the organ turbidity.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

The next day.

At dawn.

Li Xian jumped down from the canopy and transported the gold, silver, and jewels onto the small boat. Five boats were filled with the bandits' heads as merit, and two boats were filled with gold, silver, and jewels. He found wooden branches and vines to link the seven boats together, making them one. He did everything thoroughly and prepared to leave.

Li Xian thought, "I was originally concerned about the Dongran Lake's treacherous and unpredictable waters. Even if these victims were freed, they would most likely get lost in the lake and be trapped, unable to get out. Bringing them back to the Water Jar, they would at least have a place to stay. But since I've found the water map and know the route to leave the Dongran Lake, bringing them back to the Water Jar would actually harm them."

Li Xian redrew three copies of the 'Water Gold Nest' water map according to his memory and hid them in various places in the nest. When they obtained the water map, even if their ship was destroyed, they could make a boat by cutting wood and would always be able to escape.

He was thorough in his work. He didn't rescue the people immediately to avoid trouble. If misunderstandings and conflicts arose, with Li Xian's two fists and two legs, the situation would become complicated. So he waited until daytime, when it was bright, and after he sailed far away, he would find a way to rescue them.

Not meeting them would naturally avoid trouble.

There were several cannons on an abandoned merchant ship next to the water bandits' nest, with gunpowder and shells inside. Li Xian took out the gunpowder and shells and fixed them on the tree cages. Then he steered the boat and left the water bandits' nest.

When he felt the distance was far enough,

He lit the wooden arrow and shot it towards the Water Gold Nest from afar. The wooden arrow arced through the air and hit the gunpowder and shells. With a 'rumble', the tree cages were blown loose, and the trapped people inside naturally broke free. Those who were freed first emerged from the water one after another, their eyes full of fear and confusion.

After confirming there was no one around, they immediately helped the other freed people, pulling the four second-rank martial artists, who were entangled by tree roots and deeply submerged in the lake, out of the deep lake to see the sun again.

They had endured in the water for a long time, not eating for several days, and their breathing was also obstructed. But the water bandits didn't really want to drown them.

The vines of the water trees were mostly hollow. They could be used for breathing underwater. The water bandits often bit the vines to dive and catch fish. And these four people relied on this to barely survive for several days. But being soaked in the dirty water and invaded by external evil, their bodies were already swollen and blistered, smelling foul.

Everyone was now free and immediately gathered together, determined to fight the water bandits to the death and seize the boats. The four second-rank martial artists, feeling helpless and aggrieved, were determined to avenge their hatred. They振奋 their spirits, stirred their Thunder Sound, and forced the sewage out of their bodies. Their momentum was fierce, and they had recovered several tenths of their strength. But after searching, they found that the nest was empty.

Everyone thought the water bandits had all gone out to ambush and plunder passing merchant ships. They wanted to take this opportunity to board a boat and escape. But remembering their experience in the water, if they encountered the water bandits again, they would inevitably be captured by the same trick. So they proposed to ambush the nest, kill all the water bandits, and then escape.

They waited for half an hour. Who knew that there was still no sound, it was terrifyingly quiet.

It was as if haunted; the bandits had vanished into thin air. The gold, silver, jewels, and valuables were all gone. After thinking it over, their backs felt cold. Even if all the bandits left the nest, they should have left someone to guard it. There was no such strange thing in the world. They changed their minds and searched every place meticulously, finding the water map and a way to escape.

They felt this place was too strange and didn't stay long. They immediately cut wood to make boats. More than ten small boats sailed out of the Dongran Lake, and thus they escaped. Seeing the warm September sun and the lake breeze blowing, it felt like a new life.

On the other side.

Li Xian sailed back. The sun was shining brightly. Around him were stored hundreds of heads, truly shocking. After sailing several miles, the morning mist had cleared, and the view was open. He saw the high sky and the wide lake, the blue water and white clouds. He couldn't help but let out a few loud shouts to express his feelings.

The lake waves rippled. This was truly a rare beautiful scenery. The Dongran Lake had waterfalls, water forests, and many strange lake fish, some with unique toxins, or unique appearances. This place hid dangers and risks. It was said that deep in the lake bottom, there were also hidden tombs and coiled black dragons, etc.

After sailing for about half a day, the outline of the Water Jar could be seen.

It was noon, and the shore was more lively than usual. A flower boat was docked by the shore, and the Flower Cage Sect disciples on board were陆续 disembarking and gathering on the shore.

Li Xian stood at the bow of the boat. The seven boats were linked into one. On one side, heads were piled up, and on the other, gold, silver, and jewels. His long hair fluttered, and his figure was handsome. This strange scene immediately caused the disciples to exclaim and stare.

They all talked: "Oh, look quickly, there's movement over there."
"It seems to be a person. Ah, his boat is full of human heads. Oh, is he a powerful expert who found our坛口 and came here for revenge?"
"It's really possible. Quickly notify the elders. This person's bloody aura is soaring to the sky, he's definitely not a good person!"

After a lot of clamor,

The Flower Cage Sect elder 'Tang Feng' and the ferry envoy Jin Shichang ran out of the cabin, as if facing a great enemy, looking into the distance.

Tang Feng was patrolling outside the Water Jar and had just returned today. He didn't know Li Xian's name. Seeing this situation, he felt a great enemy was at hand and immediately ordered someone to bring weapons. He said, "Envoy Jin, it's a big trouble. A powerful expert is at our door today. I'll stall him here, but I'm afraid I'm no match for him. You quickly go and notify Envoy Shi, and we'll join forces to deal with this enemy!"

Jin Shichang frowned and stared intently. When he saw the face clearly, he smiled and said, "Elder Tang, how do you know this is a strong enemy, and that even you are no match for him?"

Tang Feng said solemnly, "With my eyesight and experience, I'm never wrong. This person is young in appearance, handsome and extraordinary. The style and bearing with which he steps on the boat, how could he be a weakling? And around the Water Jar, there is the Five Elements maze. How could others break in? This person must be extremely proficient in the Five Elements, showing that he is unfathomable."

Jin Shichang smiled, "I don't think so." Tang Feng frowned and said, "Envoy Jin, this is no joke. We must take it seriously. This person brought human heads here, I'm afraid he is determined to slaughter. If we don't want to become ghosts under his sword, we must not underestimate the enemy."

As they were talking, a call was suddenly heard: "Envoy Jin!"

Jin Shichang smiled, "Wucuo, what did you go do?" He glanced teasingly at Tang Feng. Li Xian said truthfully, "I took the suppression order and wiped out the water bandits at the Water Gold Nest."

Jin Shichang laughed, "So that's what it was." He said to Tang Feng, "Elder Tang, you haven't returned to the Water Jar for nearly a month, so you might not be clear about some things. This Huo Wucuo is a new talent in our sect, not a fierce person."

Tang Feng's face was awkward. He hid the weapon behind his back, his old face quite red. He said, "A new talent... a new talent is good. Our Flower Cage Sect can also have such a talent. The way you sailed the boat just now really gave this old man a big scare."

Jin Shichang didn't continue to tease him and said, "Elder Tang's cautious nature is exactly what's good. If a powerful expert could really step on a wooden boat and break into the Water Jar alone, that would be a great enemy. So Elder Tang's cautious handling was correct."

By now, the commotion had spread, and the disciples in the town had also come to see. The shore was very lively. When Li Xian's boat docked and the water bandit heads were moved out one by one, Jin Shichang and Tang Feng came to watch, counting them by the side. The more they counted, the more shocked they became. The other disciples felt it was even more incredible.

Destroying a nest is not difficult, but it's not easy either. It greatly tests ability, methods, strategy, and martial arts. In these troubled times, chaos is everywhere. Young masters and ladies of noble families roam the江湖. They may have high martial arts but still capsize in a ditch, getting captured or losing their lives, which is very common.

And to剿灭 a nest, with the bandits scattering and fleeing, it's even harder to kill them all.

Jin Shichang and Tang Feng both had broad vision and were momentarily at a loss as to how Li Xian had achieved this.

Jin Shichang asked in surprise, "Wucuo, these water bandits... were all wiped out by you alone? Really no helpers?" Li Xian smiled, "Naturally. I captured the leader first, then broke them down one by one. It wasn't very difficult."

Jin Shichang patted Li Xian's shoulder repeatedly and sighed, "What a guy. It sounds easy, but if you actually do it, even if Elder Tang made a move, he might not be able to wipe them all out."

Tang Feng said truthfully, "It's definitely impossible to wipe them all out!"

He pointed at the many corpses, his eyes showing admiration again. He said, "If I made a move, I could easily scatter the nest. But they would scatter and escape, using the water to get away. There's nothing I could do about it."

"Look at the expressions on these water bandits' faces. There are hundreds of corpses, and their expressions are relaxed and content. This shows that these hundreds of people died silently. They didn't even know they were dead when they died."

When these words came out, all the other disciples were horrified. The surroundings immediately became noisy: "Elder Tang is extremely skilled in martial arts, has read widely, and is known as the 'Martial Scholar'. Even Envoy Shi said he has a sharp eye for martial arts. If he says so, it must be true."
"Ah, this is too terrifying. Is this Huo Wucuo a ghost?"
"More than that. Senior Brother Huo was already厉害. At the martial arts conference some time ago, he also won first place."
"Winning a martial arts match only shows his martial power is strong. But wiping out water bandits requires even more ability!"

Tang Feng was extremely interested. Jin Shichang knew that Li Xian had already joined the Candle Sect and looked at him with great importance. Tang Feng added, "Water bandit nests are usually not large, and they have many visible and hidden sentries. It's not difficult for a powerful martial artist to break in forcefully. But to silently take hundreds of lives like this is extremely difficult. How did you do it?"

These words were a sincere inquiry.

Li Xian said bluntly, "I shot them with arrows." Tang Feng said, "That's even more difficult. Even if you shoot them with arrows, there should be some noise." He said, "Unless your archery is outstanding, your arrow control is extremely precise, and you have a grasp of the overall situation, you can achieve this level."

Jin Shichang heard this and said, "It seems Envoy Shi didn't misjudge you!" Tang Feng admired, "Brother Huo is a person with methods. I, Tang, admire you. I didn't expect to see such a new talent as soon as I returned to the Water Jar. I truly admire you. Let's have a drink together when you have time."

After a conversation, Jin Shichang and Tang Feng left first.

Li Xian saw the heavy heads on the ground and hired a few disciples to help carry them. His various deeds had already established prestige at the Water Jar. With a wave of his hand, several disciples came to flatter him, calling him 'Brother Huo', 'Senior Brother Huo', 'Big Brother Huo', etc. Li Xian, to avoid frightening the local residents, took a different path, bypassing the town and walking on the mountain road.

The disciples along the way heard the news and came to watch and marvel. After walking several miles, more and more people gathered, creating a 'welcoming along the way' atmosphere. The Water Jar disciples were constantly flowing. Some knew him, some didn't. The disciples were both curious and afraid, and various words of praise and flattery came 'clattering' at him.

The Flower Cage Sect disciples had ordinary strength and had always relied on others. Thus, they formed a flattering and fawning style. Li Xian's strength showed he was extraordinary, so he was naturally fawned over. No one dared to be disrespectful. Even if they were, they wouldn't dare show it in the slightest.

Along the way, they had already praised Li Xian to the heavens. Li Xian just smiled and passed it off, not caring at all. He really didn't know that it was precisely because the Flower Cage Sect disciples roamed everywhere that when they gathered in their spare time, they loved to boast and talk about everything.

The name 'Huo Wucuo' had quietly spread beyond the Water Jar. Li Xian had left his name in the Jianghu for the first time. Although it was an infamous or notorious name, it was still a mark.

Among the onlookers, a woman in a black robe gazed at Li Xian, a sharp light flashing in her eyes.
