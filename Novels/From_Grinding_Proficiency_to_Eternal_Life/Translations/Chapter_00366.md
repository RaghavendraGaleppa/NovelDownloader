# Chapter 366: The Cage of This World

As a Qi Condensation disciple like me, my lifespan is at most two hundred years. Even with some life-extending methods, it barely reaches three hundred.

Foundation Establishment True Ones are slightly better, but they too only live for five or six hundred springs…”

At this point, Youquan’s tone turned venomous. “Only those True Disciples can freely enter and exit using ‘Node Talismans,’ reaping the fortunes of this world like harvesting crops! I was…”

He suddenly fell silent.

“Continue.”

Xu Yunfan’s true energy formed a fine needle and pierced the Golden Core.

Youquan wailed and confessed, “The Patrol Envoy punished the Hundred Desires Peak, barring us from taking on Realm Task for three years! I spent ten years’ worth of contribution points just to secure a spot in the Divine Martial Realm. I intended to secretly harvest some martial artists’ vital energy to make up for my deficiencies…”

Xu Yunfan suddenly interrupted. “You said the Divine Martial Realm is a ‘spot’?”

“Y-Yes!”

Youquan’s speech quickened. “Three thousand years ago, Xuan Jade Monarch of the Primordial Origin Sect captured this realm from the Sea of Worlds and passed down the martial arts cultivation system, specifically to cultivate resources. It opens once every sixty years. One needs fifteen hundred contribution points to exchange for a通行 Talisman…”

He even sounded a bit proud when mentioning the key point. “Sir, do you know? A ninth-grade martial artist from this realm can be exchanged for three ‘Blood Marrow Pills’ in the Sect’s Merit Hall! If they break through the ninth-grade barrier and reach the so-called Land Immortal Realm…”

The Golden Core was suddenly crushed deformed by Xu Yunfan. Youquan screamed and changed his tune. “I deserve to die! But this realm is nothing more than the Sect’s pasture! Look at those Xuanhuang Qi…”

Xu Yunfan recalled the dragon脉 Qi that had infused his body and said in a deep voice, “Explain clearly.”

“Xuanhuang Qi is actually a product of the ‘Dragon Nurturing Technique’!” Youquan shouted, throwing caution to the wind. “The Primordial Origin Sect plants Dragon Vein Seeds in various realms, allowing them to devour the local luck to grow. Once mature, the disciples can harvest them… A mid-tier pasture like the Divine Martial Realm can produce at least ten ‘Xuanhuang Dao Seeds’… Huh?!”

Youquan exclaimed in shock, “Why is the small world secret realm of this realm gone?!”

Ignoring Youquan’s words, Xu Yunfan suddenly remembered the purple light in the Empress’s eyes. “What collusion does the Great Zhou Royal Family have with you?”

Youquan’s voice carried a hint of disdain. “Sir, you overestimate them. What qualifications do they have to collude with us? That girl was merely chosen by me. That’s why I coaxed her into refining my remains into a Purple-Gold Pill. So…”

He suddenly lowered his voice. “Sir, if you are willing to let me go, I can tell you the flaw of this Divine Martial Realm! Before every harvest, the Primordial Origin Sect releases ‘Impure Qi’ to pollute the martial path. That is the Heavenly Demon you have seen! This Impure Qi specifically breaks a martial artist’s true energy. After you absorb this ‘Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy’ into your body, it pollutes the purity of your true energy, allowing the Sect to harvest easily…”

At this point, Youquan’s tone shifted, carrying a complaint. “That witch, her methods are no different from our Demonic Sect disciples. She actually performed a blood sacrifice on the common people, stirring up the earth veins in advance to bring out pure Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy. Although it’s mixed, it isn’t polluted by my Primordial Origin Sect…”

Youquan suddenly shut his mouth, refusing to say more, only mumbling, “Sir, please spare me. I can tell you the Dao Foundation of this Divine Martial Realm.”

Xu Yunfan didn’t take the bait. He just chuckled lightly. “A so-called Outer Sect disciple like you—how would you know such secrets?”

The Purple-Gold Pill trembled violently; Youquan seemed to be struggling. “B-Because my master is the Enforcement Elder of the Hundred Desires Peak! He let it slip while drunk…”

Suddenly, a wisp of pink mist exploded from within the pill. Youquan’s voice became bewitching. “Sir, why don’t we make a deal?”

In the mist, the phantom of a woman’s naked body rippled like water. Youquan’s voice carried a sticky temptation. “The Hundred Desires Peak has the *True Scripture of Yin-Yang Body Refining*. It can help Sir convert your Ten Extremities true energy into true essence…”

The phantom actually grew bolder, lingering around Xu Yunfan like a woman being intimate. “With your talent, once you leave this realm, building a Dao Foundation is just a snap of the fingers…”

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan’s eyes. His sleeves didn’t even move, but pure Yang true energy, like the sun melting snow, instantly evaporated the mist, causing Youquan to let out a scream. He truly hadn’t expected Xu Yunfan to be immune to temptation methods.

“How is this possible?!”

Xu Yunfan sneered. Youquan was a disciple of a Demonic Sect, naturally treacherous and cunning by nature. The most one could trust of his words was half a portion, and that was only obtainable under torture.

This world was a cage. To find a chance for transcendence, he naturally needed to start with Youquan. Only by finding a way to leave this realm and enter the so-called Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm could there be any possibility of hope.

He reached into the mechanism box and took out an item.

It was the Primordial Origin Token obtained from Jiang Xu in the White Jade Palace within the small world’s secret realm.

Strange cloud patterns were etched on its surface, and the words “Primordial Origin” at its core emitted a faint blood-colored light.

“Do you recognize this object?”

“This… this is?!”

Youquan’s demonic energy suddenly trembled violently. A sound like porcelain cracking came from the pill. “Primordial Origin Token! How did you…” The voice cut off abruptly. Countless cracks suddenly appeared on the surface of the Purple-Gold Pill.

After three breaths of dead silence, just as the Purple-Gold Pill was about to be crushed by Xu Yunfan, Youquan finally shrieked, “Whoever holds this token… can enter the Primordial Origin Sect’s mountain gate and become a disciple of one of the Thirty-Six Peak Masters…”

After Youquan finished speaking, as if he had figured something out, the black fog suddenly became active, even carrying a hint of flattery. “Since Senior Brother has the token, we are family! Why not help Junior Brother complete this harvest? When we return to the mountain gate to report, the merit ledger will surely record Senior Brother’s top contribution!”

The demonic mist inside the pill condensed into the shape of a hand, bowing as if in salute. “The Hundred Desires Peak’s stock of thirty thousand furnaces—men and women alike—even the *Supreme Azure Dark Record* from the Scripture Pavilion, Junior Brother can help connect Senior Brother with…”

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan’s five fingers suddenly clenched. The pill let out a groan as if it couldn’t bear the pressure.

“Explain the harvesting mechanism clearly.”

Pure Yang true fire ignited at Xu Yunfan’s fingertips. “If there is a single word of falsehood… I will scatter your soul to the winds.”

“I’ll talk!”

Youquan screamed. Under the threat of death, he dared not hide anything. He could clearly sense Xu Yunfan’s undisguised killing intent; the other party truly intended to annihilate him completely.

“Every harvest season, once every sixty years, disciples holding the token can receive three ‘Xuanhuang Seeds’! After planting them in the realm, we won’t be rejected by the realm’s Heavenly Dao, allowing us to harvest the ninth-grade martial artists of this realm…”

Xu Yunfan understood, but his heart felt heavy. The realm he had traveled to was actually a Demonic Sect’s breeding ground, treated as resources to be plucked.

“What are you best at?”

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s expressionless, unjoyful, unangry face, Youquan hurriedly replied, “Dual Cultivation extraction. What I am best at is the way of Dual Cultivation extraction.”

“The way of Dual Cultivation extraction?”

Xu Yunfan suddenly activated his pure Yang true energy. The phantom screamed and vanished.

Youquan’s main body screamed in terror. “Stop! I still have value! I’ve already received news that the Primordial Origin Sect will launch the ‘Harvest’ in three days! A True Disciple at the peak of Qi Condensation will descend! I know their weak points…”

Xu Yunfan, however, tossed the Purple-Gold Pill into the air. The Ten Extremities true energy transformed into a furnace. “No need.”
