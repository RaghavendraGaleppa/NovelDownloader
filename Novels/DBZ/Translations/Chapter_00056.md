Chapter 56: First-Tier Top-Grade Golden Light Array!

"This..." Gongyang Yan stroked his beard, a hesitant expression on his face. Although Patriarch Qiao had spoken much more politely this time, it was undeniable that he was using his power to coerce others. To be precise, it definitely counted as disrupting the normal order of the auction. However, asking Gongyang Yan to step forward and expel the Qiao family was something he had to consider carefully. After all, Gongyang Yan was not a solitary individual without weaknesses.

Fortunately, he wouldn't have to dwell on this problem for long. A Bai family cultivator had already flown over on a magic tool.

"Fellow Daoist Qiao, you have repeatedly ignored warnings and disrupted the normal order of the auction," the Bai family cultivator who flew over was none other than Bai Fujie. "Now, please leave."

Qiao Gongshi hadn't expected such a situation. His Qiao family and the Bai family were both immortal cultivation families in similar circumstances. Deep down, Qiao Gongshi felt that the Qiao and Bai families were 'equal'. Therefore, regarding the auction rules and order, let alone Qiao Gongshi, all the Qiao family cultivators present paid them no mind. Qiao Gongshi had never thought the Bai family would actually expel him from the venue, especially under the watchful eyes of so many cultivators! If his Qiao family left, once this matter spread, his Qiao family would become a laughing stock, their dignity swept away.

So, instead of moving, Qiao Gongshi took a step forward with a firm stance: "Nephew, don't be foolish." Qiao Gongshi squinted, his eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation fully revealed. "Your uncle heard every one of those foolish words you just spoke clearly. Apologize, and I can pretend none of this happened."

At this moment, Patriarch Qiao still thought this was Bai Fujie's personal action. He figured that soon enough, the true person in charge of the Bai family would come to apologize with a smile.

But something incredible happened. Bai Fujie's expression remained as stern as ever: "Patriarch Qiao, you can either walk out obediently yourself, or we will drag you out!"

"How dare you speak to me like that! What audacity!" Could a fifth-level Qi Condensation cultivator really be so presumptuous? The eighth-level Qi Condensation Qiao Gongshi was instantly furious. But his anger didn't last long before it suddenly subsided. He felt three powerful auras, each stronger than his own, pressing down on him.

Three ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivators! This discovery immediately made Qiao Gongshi shut his mouth. No wonder the Bai family dared to hold an auction; they truly had something to rely on!

He returned to the private room and said to the remaining four Qiao family cultivators, "Let's go!"

"Patriarch, this—" Someone was about to speak when Qiao Gongshi cut him off. "Don't ask, just go!"

The patriarch's authority was sufficient here. With Qiao Gongshi's command, the remaining four Qiao family cultivators, no matter how reluctant, could only move their feet and walk out of the private room, heading towards the main hall's exit.

The bidders on the first floor also noticed this scene.

"Hey, isn't that Patriarch Qiao of the Qiao Immortal Clan? How did he come down from the private room?"

"Idiot, it's not that he *wanted* to come down. He was kicked out!"

"The Bai family is serious?"

Watching the Qiao family一行 be 'invited' out, most of the remaining bidders reined in their emotions. Many began to earnestly participate in the auction instead of constantly thinking about trivial matters.

Gongyang Yan's face immediately lit up when he saw this. Regardless, he didn't have to be the villain, which was for the best. He chuckled, "The Bai family truly has a backup plan for holding this auction." For the three of them, this was naturally good news.

On the floor, although Qiao Gongshi had been expelled, the bidding for the magic tool had not yet ended.

On the second floor, in the private room where the Iron Sword Sect was located, Elder Tian, who was leading the group, remained silent for a moment before stating his price again. "Four hundred and twenty spirit stones!"

In Wei Qian's private room, Tie Xiangguang said to Wei Qian, "Fellow Daoist Wei, I have four hundred spirit stones here, and a first-tier high-grade magic tool that I forged myself, which can be valued at one hundred spirit stones." He continued, "What's your price? If it's over five hundred spirit stones, I'll give up." Tie Xiangguang candidly revealed his bottom line to him. This was all due to Wei Qian's identity as an alchemist.

However, Tie Xiangguang's bid was not without his own subtle intentions. He specifically mentioned having a first-tier high-grade magic tool that he forged himself to demonstrate his value, hoping that Wei Qian, after weighing the pros and cons, would voluntarily withdraw from the competition.

"I have four hundred and fifty spirit stones and a bottle of high-quality Essence-replenishing Pills," Wei Qian's bid also included a hint of his own cleverness.

Tie Xiangguang's face showed a look of sudden realization. "So, the first auctioned item came from Fellow Daoist Wei's hands." He then declared, "This Tie's financial resources are insufficient, so I will concede this array set to Fellow Daoist Wei."

The value of an alchemist was not inferior to that of an artificer; it even faintly surpassed it.

After all, for cultivators, an excellent magic tool that could protect one's cultivation path was certainly valuable. However, when compared to one's own path of cultivation, the growth of one's cultivation base was undoubtedly more important. Therefore, it was perfectly normal for Tie Xiangguang to choose to concede.

After unifying their front, Wei Qian continued to bid. "Four hundred and fifty spirit stones!"

On the auction stage, Fairy Zilu blinked her beautiful eyes repeatedly, her tone soft and alluring: "Esteemed guest in private room number three has bid four hundred and fifty spirit stones. Is there any higher bid?"

On the second floor, from private room number one, a steady middle-aged male voice emerged: "Fairy Zilu, please wait a moment. Let this Tian gather some spirit stones." The next moment, several sound-transmitting paper cranes flew down towards the auction floor. Fairy Zilu naturally did not obstruct such an action and waited patiently.

"This Fellow Daoist Tian seems to value this array set greatly," Wei Qian was slightly surprised. He hadn't expected Elder Tian of the Iron Sword Sect to be so interested in this small array. One should know that buying this array would not be of much use for protecting the Iron Sword Sect's mountain gate.

"Fellow Daoist Wei, don't worry. Let this old man inquire about the situation," Gongyang Yan said. The next moment, he also sent out a sound-transmitting paper crane and received a reply shortly after. Upon reading the reply, Gongyang Yan wore an expression of understanding. "This Fellow Daoist Tian is so keen on this small array not for his sect, but for himself."

He then proceeded to explain the situation to the confused Wei Qian and Tie Xiangguang. "Didn't the Flowing Cloud Sect organize a law enforcement team before? This Fellow Daoist Tian also responded to the call and participated in their operations. But unexpectedly, this group of demonic cultivators, after being suppressed by the major sect, has instead shown signs of growing stronger with each battle. Just some time ago, didn't a demonic cultivator achieve Foundation Establishment?"

In just a few words, Gongyang Yan made Wei Qian understand the whole story. In the operation to suppress demonic cultivators, Elder Tian of the Iron Sword Sect had performed remarkably well. Now, seeing the rampant arrogance of the demonic path, Elder Tian, fearing that he might become a target for retaliation, began searching everywhere for various self-defense items. It could be said that the reason he came to this auction was precisely for this array set. No wonder he was willing to borrow money to continue participating in the bidding.

However, as an elder of a sect, was Elder Tian really so financially embarrassed? Did he not even have a thousand spirit stones in his storage bag?
