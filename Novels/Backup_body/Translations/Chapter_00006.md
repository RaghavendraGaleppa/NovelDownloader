# Chapter 6: I Shall Obey Heaven's Will!

In the 176th outer sect courtyard:

"Pei Ying comes from an ordinary background, but two years ago, he caught the eye of Chen Youyu's sister and married into the Chen family," the counterfeit medicine peddler said with a smile. "Actually, this isn’t much of a secret within the inner sect, but few in the outer sect know about it, and even fewer dare to gossip."

Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow. "Pei Ying is young and about to enter the inner sect. His status won’t be lower than Chen Youyu's. Why would he agree to this marriage?"

"Chen Youyu is almost in his grave and still just an outer sect steward—hardly a force to reckon with," the peddler shrugged. "But there’s a high-ranking figure in the sect from the Chen family. Once Pei Ying enters the inner sect, he’ll be considered part of the Chen clan and naturally receive preferential treatment!"

So that’s how it is. Li Zhengjing suddenly understood, and for a moment, he even felt a twinge of envy—something the usually upright young man, who had suffered suppression for half a year, rarely entertained.

"Bah! What am I thinking?" Li Zhengjing mentally chided himself before instructing the peddler to deliver the medicine cauldron early the next day. He then returned to his room to tidy up.

A short while later, another knock came at his door.

Opening it, Li Zhengjing found Pei Ying standing outside.

"Junior Brother Li must be busy with important matters and may have forgotten my invitation, so I’ve come personally to fetch you," Pei Ying said with a smile, his demeanor amiable and without a trace of displeasure.

Li Zhengjing was about to politely decline when the golden page in his mind shifted under the "Fortune" column:

**Fortune:** *Declining the invitation inadvertently thwarts the assassination plot, forcing Chen Youyu and his cohorts to act rashly tonight. They resort to using another to kill you, resulting in your body being devoured by beasts, leaving no corpse behind!*

"Damn you all! Must you be so vicious? Can’t you even leave me a whole corpse?" Li Zhengjing hesitated, then silently pondered: *What if I accept the invitation?*

**Fortune:** *Practicing the flawed and incomplete "Viscera-Nourishing Qi Internal Art" fails to cultivate inner qi and damages your foundational organs. Five days later, you fail the inner sect disciple assessment, rendering you useless to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord. You are refined into a blood pill, leaving no corpse behind!*

"So, attending the banquet poses no threat to me? I thought this was supposed to be a deadly trap? That’s it?" Confused but trusting the golden page’s guidance, Li Zhengjing agreed and followed Pei Ying.

The two exchanged pleasantries as they walked to Pei Ying’s residence, where a feast awaited them. Among the dishes was a fish—its body crimson red with a pale belly, its golden roe nearly bursting through, emitting a mouthwatering aroma.

"This fish is extraordinary. It’s called a Blood Eel, rarely seen except after heavy rains," Pei Ying explained. "This one was on the verge of becoming a spirit. If not for its pregnancy, it might’ve turned into a demon! An inner sect senior caught and killed it before it could. I paid eight hundred taels of silver to buy it from him."

Li Zhengjing sighed. "Senior Brother Pei must hail from a wealthy and prestigious family to spend so lavishly."

Pei Ying’s face flickered between green and pale, a hint of shame and anger flashing across it. But he quickly composed himself and raised his wine cup.

The two drank and finished the fish together.

As night deepened, Pei Ying’s face flushed red from the wine, and he panted heavily. "I can’t hold my liquor… I can’t hold my liquor…" he slurred.

Li Zhengjing, also sufficiently drunk, stood to take his leave, thanking Pei Ying profusely for his hospitality.

Once Li Zhengjing was gone, Pei Ying frantically reached into his robe, pulled out a prepared pill, and swallowed it. Within moments, he vomited violently into a basin, expelling all the roe he had consumed.

After catching his breath, he staggered to Chen Youyu’s residence.

Inside, Chen Youyu and several stewards, including Steward Lin, awaited.

"It’s done. Over a hundred poisoned insect eggs were mixed into the roe, and he ate every last one. By tomorrow, his guts will rot, and he’ll die in agony," Pei Ying announced triumphantly. "And since he’s been buying insects lately and was once poisoned by them before, even if the Enforcement Hall investigates, it’ll look like he poisoned himself! Gentlemen, your sleepless nights are over. After tonight, you can rest easy!"

The courtyard fell silent briefly before erupting in relieved laughter, the atmosphere joyous.

Chen Youyu, under the most pressure lately, wiped away tears of joy, overcome with emotion. "At dawn, inspect the outer sect courtyards under the pretense of checking cleanliness. Enter his courtyard and retrieve the body," he instructed, voice trembling. "I shouldn’t be present. Stewards Lin and Fan, take a few outer disciples as witnesses."

He then walked to the courtyard corner and retrieved a straw mat and a white cloth, handing them to Steward Lin. "These are for wrapping the corpse. Cover his face with the cloth and roll him in the mat. After the Enforcement Hall’s investigation, bury him under the seventeenth tree on the left path down the mountain. I’ve checked—the feng shui there is excellent. He’ll rot within two days, never to reincarnate."

The others exchanged glances. With Chen Youyu weeping as if mourning a parent, one might think the deceased was his own father.

Pei Ying sighed admiringly. "Brother-in-law, your compassion knows no bounds. Even an enemy receives such care. Your virtue is truly admirable!"

Chen Youyu grasped Pei Ying’s hand, tears streaming. "You understand me, brother-in-law. Tonight, we drink to celebrate!"

He recalled the looming threat of the "Soul-Severing Platform." Had Li Zhengjing not been eliminated, his own soul would have been destroyed. Overcome with relief, he wept anew.

The other stewards exchanged bewildered looks. Steward Lin, watching Chen Youyu’s hysterics, mused silently, *When his wife and child died three years ago, he didn’t cry this hard. Why is he more devastated by this kid’s death than by his own father’s?*

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing returned to his courtyard, dizzy and rubbing his temples. "This drunkenness feels excessive…" he muttered.

The sensation was familiar—it mirrored the poisoning he’d suffered in the capital half a year ago. The moment he saw the roe, he’d known where the trap lay.

*No wonder the golden page’s fortune didn’t change. They tried to poison me with insect eggs!* He exhaled deeply, stroking his chin. *The poison I ingested tonight contains energy equivalent to at least ten low-grade spirit stones. They’re surprisingly generous—do they always spend this much?*

Stretching, he felt increasingly alert. The golden page in his mind, having absorbed the poison, glowed brighter, its text sharper.

As night deepened, he took a jar of strong liquor and left for a pavilion halfway up the mountain path to the left of the sect’s entrance. Hanging the jar there, he unsealed it and returned home, avoiding two patrols of Enforcement Hall disciples.

Shortly after he left, a white bird darted to the pavilion like lightning. Perching atop it, the bird peered at the open jar, its beak twitching as if sniffing.

After a long silence, it spoke in human tongue: "Why is there free wine here every day? Nothing in life comes this easy."

"Birdy’s lived eight years and never believed in free lunches. There’s gotta be a scheme here!" The bird’s voice grew stern, its eyes sharpening. Then it muttered, "But this ain’t a lunch… Books say free lunches are bad, but free booze might not be, right?"

"Besides, this is the sacred sect grounds. With my status, who’d dare mess with me?" It hesitated, flipping through a book it spat out with its claws before concluding, "The sages said, ‘Heaven’s gifts, unclaimed, become misfortunes.’"

Pausing, it interpreted, "Meaning if you refuse what Heaven offers, you’ll be punished!" With that, it plunged headfirst into the jar, thinking, *I shall obey Heaven’s will!*
