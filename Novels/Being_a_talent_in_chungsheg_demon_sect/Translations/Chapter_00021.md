# Chapter 21: Unwarranted Calamity

"Junior Brother Xiao is truly a man of outstanding talent." Lu Yang laughed heartily as he patted Xiao Shiye's shoulder. "My name is Lu Yang. We should have joined the sect in the same batch, so I can't really be called your Senior Brother."

"The same batch?" Xiao Shiye looked surprised upon hearing this, then displayed a look of admiration. "In that case, Brother Lu's talent must be exceptional, or it would be difficult to reach such a cultivation level."

"I don't deserve such praise." Lu Yang waved his hand. He knew himself well; his talent was by no means good. His usual cultivation relied entirely on consuming pills, and breaking through bottlenecks depended on unorthodox cultivation methods. If he had cultivated step-by-step, he estimated he would still be stuck at the third level of Qi Refinement.

After learning that Lu Yang was his peer, Xiao Shiye was no longer as reserved as he initially was. The two quickly grew familiar. After chatting for a while, Lu Yang tentatively asked, "I've just broken through and plan to return to my immortal's cave to stabilize my cultivation. Where does Brother Xiao intend to go next?"

"To be honest, Brother Lu, I plan to visit the Pool of Merit." Xiao Shiye smiled. "I heard that the Pool of Merit is the ultimate test of luck. As it happens, I've recently had a sudden stroke of good fortune, so I want to seize this opportunity to try my luck."

"The Pool of Merit..." Lu Yang's heart stirred. A sudden impulse led him to say, "Since that's the case, why don't we go together?" He had already tried the winning numbers Xiao Shiye had chosen in his previous life, so he was curious how Xiao Shiye would choose this time, and if there was truly some manipulation involved.

Meanwhile, outside Myriad Treasures Peak, in a sea of clouds.

Over a dozen figures stood silently. The one leading them was a handsome young man in white robes, exuding an air of elegance and charisma, his body enveloped by mist.

Just then, one of the figures suddenly showed joy on his face: "Senior Brother Liu, that person surnamed Xiao has come out."

Before the words finished, the handsome young man also seemed to awaken from his meditative state. The mist dispersed, revealing a face Lu Yang would absolutely never forget. It was none other than Liu Xin!

At this moment, Liu Xin had also broken through to the late-stage Qi Refinement. Furthermore, cultivating the *Innate Dao Scripture*, he possessed a more profound Daoist and immortal aura than ordinary cultivators.

"Finally out." Liu Xin's lips curved into a smile. At first glance, his appearance showed none of the ferocity of a demonic cultivator; instead, he exuded a friendly aura, like a spring breeze. However, when he circulated his True Qi and cast his Spirit-Observing Art towards Xiao Shiye, his smile abruptly froze.

"...Late-stage Qi Refinement?" Liu Xin's brows furrowed slightly. He clearly hadn't expected Xiao Shiye to be accompanied by a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. This was a variable significant enough to make him change his plans.

Just then, a soft gasp of surprise came from beside Liu Xin. Liu Xin turned his head in response, smiling gently. "What's wrong, Qingchen? Do you happen to know that late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator?"

As soon as he spoke, the charming woman standing behind Liu Xin immediately pursed her red lips. "To tell you the truth, Senior Brother Liu, this servant truly knows that late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator." Following that, the woman spoke with a jealous and resentful tone, "That person is named Lu Yang. He's a disciple who entered the sect several months ago. During the previous Substitute Death Yin Puppet incident, he exited early and made a huge profit, at least tens of thousands of contribution points! I imagine he relied on that enormous sum to break through to late-stage Qi Refinement..."

The charming woman was none other than Fairy Qingchen, who had followed Zhao Xuhe in the previous life. However, unlike the previous life, Fairy Qingchen had fallen out with Zhao Xuhe early on in this life, and had already become Liu Xin's paramour. The reason for their fallout was simple: Zhao Xuhe had dragged her into speculating on Substitute Death Yin Puppets. When Zhao Xuhe went bankrupt, Fairy Qingchen naturally was no exception. Incidentally, Liu Xin had also speculated. And because the impact of the Substitute Death Yin Puppets was much greater in this life than in the previous one, their losses after it imploded also far exceeded those of the previous life. Not only were they on the verge of bankruptcy, but they also accrued massive external debts. Thanks to this, the two were forced to resort to robbing fellow disciples, a deed they hadn't committed in the previous life, in order to cover the losses incurred from speculating on the Substitute Death Yin Puppets.

Over time, they even formed a team. Its members were all disciples with some background and influence within the sect who had gone bankrupt due to speculating on Substitute Death Yin Puppets. As for their targets, they focused on ordinary disciples who had started with little capital, exited early, and made a fortune.

Xiao Shiye was one of their recently targeted individuals. And now, after hearing about Lu Yang from Fairy Qingchen, Liu Xin's eyes brightened even further, clearly marking Lu Yang as a target as well.

"No time to lose, act!" As Liu Xin gave the order, everyone present let out cold, sinister laughs. Then, each activating their escape light, they flew towards Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye.

Shortly after leaving Myriad Treasures Peak and traversing a distance within the sea of clouds, Lu Yang suddenly furrowed his brows. The sword pellet between his brows pulsed as if giving a warning. Looking in the direction the sword pellet warned him of, Lu Yang's frown deepened. He saw escape lights soaring from all directions, centering on him and Xiao Shiye, like a large net closing in on their position.

Not long after, a voice came from behind him. "Fellow Daoist, please stop!"

Lu Yang's face instantly darkened upon hearing this. To utter such words meant their intentions were hostile! Lu Yang didn't turn his head. Ignoring the voice behind him, he frantically urged his magical power, and with a flash of sword light enveloping Xiao Shiye, he fled rapidly towards the Pool of Merit.

However, the opponents were clearly prepared. Lu Yang had barely fled a short distance before he stopped. He looked around and saw that the surrounding sea of clouds had become thin at some point, replaced by a vast, bizarre, and fantastical mirage, which firmly trapped him and Xiao Shiye in its center!

"Such an unwarranted calamity..." Lu Yang's expression was grim. He used his Spirit-Observing Art to observe from a distance, then gritted his teeth. "One late-stage Qi Refinement, seven mid-stage Qi Refinement. At most, a thirty percent chance of victory..."

What to do?

As Lu Yang pondered countermeasures, Xiao Shiye beside him suddenly spoke. "Brother Lu, if there are no surprises, these people should be coming for me." At this point, Xiao Shiye wore a look of regret. "It was my oversight. These people are likely after the magic treasures and contribution points on me. I originally thought that after several months, they would have given up, but I didn't expect them to be so persistent. Now that it's come to this, let's split up and escape."

"Split up and escape?" Lu Yang shook his head. "They have already sealed off this entire section of the sea of clouds. It seems they used a powerful magic treasure. I'm afraid we can't escape."

"No matter, I have a way to deal with it." Xiao Shiye whispered, "I have two 'Treasure-Breaking Cones.' As long as I activate one, it can open a path to survival. I am willing to give one to Brother Lu."

"Brother Lu, you go first. I will cover your retreat." Having said that, he directly handed one of the cones to Lu Yang.

Lu Yang weighed it in his hand, circulating his magical power. He immediately understood that Xiao Shiye's words were true; this magic treasure indeed had a high chance of breaking through the surrounding mirage.

"...Are you sure you want me to go first?" Lu Yang's expression was unreadable.

"Brother Lu, the mountains are high and the road is long; we shall meet again." Xiao Shiye cupped his hands and revealed a relieved smile on his face. He then directly turned and faced the approaching enemies, clearly prepared to sacrifice himself.

Seeing this, Lu Yang fell into deep thought. He had been in secluded cultivation for three months and had never made enemies. The incoming party could not be targeting him. Moreover, compared to him, Xiao Shiye was clearly the bigger "fat sheep." So, Xiao Shiye's words were not wrong. If he abandoned Xiao Shiye, he would most likely escape.

Should he do that?

Above the sea of clouds, watching Xiao Shiye's figure, pressing onward with indomitable will as if oblivious to life and death, Lu Yang's sword pellet between his brows pulsed a warning, his expression fluctuating between clear and overcast.
