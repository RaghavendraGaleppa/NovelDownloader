# Chapter 190: True Immortal vs False Heavenly Maiden, A Sword Pierces Reality!

“Alright. Since someone has already set such a fine example, this little woman shall offer her humble performance.”

Under the gaze of the crowd, ‘Hu Mei’ lightly bowed.

She then stepped out from the crowd and walked toward the Sword Mark Strange Stone.

As she approached the stone, a sound seemed to resonate with the world itself. The melody of a zither and a flute rose, weeping and sighing with the wind.

It was like celestial music, pulling at the heartstrings of everyone present.

“Where is this sound of the flute coming from?”

“Naturally, it is because this woman is comprehending the strange stone.”

“Have you heard of the Music Demon from a thousand years ago, who ranked second on the Heavenly List? He was a powerful expert who used music as a killing technique. One song could shatter one's liver and intestines, while another could turn people into walking corpses.”

“I see. This woman specializes in the Dao of Sound.”

......

The crowd had only just recovered from the shock of seeing Jiang Chulong seemingly comprehend a divine technique. Upon hearing this pleasant and moving music, their minds instantly wavered.

“Fortunately, Young Master Li was one step ahead.”

Elder Zeng nodded slightly.

Ying Bing’s slender hand silently gripped the Frost Sword.

“It seems she couldn't hold back.”

Li Mo put away the copy he had only drawn one-tenth of and said softly.

He was about to warn the others, but he found that Huang Donglai had already frowned and retreated behind the crowd.

Zhong Zhenyue was also on high alert. Once bitten, twice shy; he smelled the scent of a wicked woman.

Needless to say, Bai Jinghong and the others were already prepared.

Li Mo: “...”

Well, it seems a warning was unnecessary.

Suddenly.

The sound of the flute grew louder. Around the waterfall, shadows of heavenly maidens seemed to appear, dancing gracefully.

This seemed to be a signal.

*Rumble—*

Around Hengyun Sword City, many powerful auras suddenly rose into the sky, revealing themselves openly.

Li Mo frowned and looked over.

He saw two figures, one male and one female.

The man was wrapped in a straw raincoat, holding a fishing rod in his hand. However, this rod had no fishing line.

His appearance caused the sky and earth of Hengyun Sword City to change color.

Dark clouds gathered, and the sun and stars hid their light. A torrential rain was coming, determined to turn this place into a vast ocean.

The curtain of rain instantly blurred everything in sight. He waved his fishing rod gently.

The raindrops, connected like strings, turned into threads. Most people caught in the rain were forced to move against their will, becoming puppets controlled by others.

The range of the rain was constantly expanding.

He was not alone.

Two others were waiting in the wings, gathering their momentum.

Li Mo’s eyes flashed with a strange light.

These three were all assassins from the Fine Rain Pavilion, at the Fifth Realm—Experts of the Outer Scene!

The Straw-Raincoat Guest, the Blood Gourd, and the Twin Lotuses!

The sudden attack of an Outer Scene expert was truly like a natural disaster. Those below the Outer Scene realm were like ants, waiting to be slaughtered.

“Outer Scene...”

Li Mo activated his Extreme Weapon Killing Body. His left hand silently gripped the Star Seed Pestle within his sleeve. His spirit sank, ready to draw upon the power of the World Seed and summon the Pangu Meteor Hammer at any moment.

He took a deep breath.

Even if he used all his methods now, he probably couldn't pose a threat to an Outer Scene expert.

The road ahead is long and arduous...

If Hengyun Sword City had been caught off guard, they might have been in serious trouble today.

Of course, that was a big "if."

“You finally decided to jump out yourself.”

*Zheng!*

A sword cry suddenly rang through the heavens.

The seven elders on the high platform had,不知何时 (who knows when), all stood up in the void.

A river of sword energy swept across the sky, flowing eastward with a momentum that swept across all directions, like a Milky Way from the ninth heaven, forcibly scattering half of the dark clouds.

It also freed everyone who had been trapped in the heavy rain and unable to break free.

The Outer Scene experts had begun to fight.

Their earth-shattering battle, however, did not seem to exert any pressure on the ordinary people. Logically, a battle between Outer Scene experts could leave a hundred miles of land scorched and rivers of blood.

But at this moment, it seemed that something had blocked the aftermath, preventing even the slightest leakage.

“Hengyun Sword City has more than just Outer Scene experts.”

Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief.

By giving that warning, he had prevented the theft of the Sword Mark. He had probably changed the fate of countless people in Hengyun Sword City.

---

He wondered how much reward he would get for this...

“Demoness, at this point, aren't you going to wake up?”

Elder Zeng clasped his hands behind his back and appeared abruptly in front of Yin Mianmian.

“Honored Elders, you knew I was coming.”

Yin Mianmian seemed surprised, but her smile remained unchanged.

This confident, alluring smile made Elder Zeng narrow his eyes.

He was about to make a move.

“Oh dear.”

Yin Mianmian suddenly let out a cry of alarm, then said with a smile, “How is it that the Sword Mark Strange Stone has vanished after my comprehension?”

“As an Outer Scene expert, you wouldn't take your anger out on this little woman, would you?”

As she spoke with a charming smile, she looked at Li Mo with a provocative, half-smiling expression.

Hmm?

Li Mo was stunned.

He focused his gaze and saw that the Sword Mark Strange Stone, which had been there just a moment ago, was now gone. The spot where the stone had been was empty.

Gone?

Yin Mianmian had already taken the stone. When did she do it?

She had been in front of everyone's eyes the whole time. Was he seeing a ghost?

Li Mo frowned and activated his Destiny Divine Eye once more.

*Crack—*

Suddenly, more than ten layers of Inner Scene auras descended. Domains collided and extinguished, stirring the void.

Yin Mianmian suddenly threw out a cloth bundle.

The bundle was caught by a... or rather, two people. They were conjoined twins, their bodies fused together, sharing one lower body but having two upper bodies.

Both of them were Outer Scene experts, and they complemented each other, making them much stronger than a typical Outer Scene expert!

The Twin Lotuses.

She had somehow separated from the main battlefield and arrived at the Sword Tower.

The bundle she caught seemed to contain the Sword Mark Strange Stone...

In an instant, the eyes of all the strong experts of Hengyun Sword City turned red. There was no time to care about Yin Mianmian; they all rushed to pursue the Twin Lotuses.

Even Elder Zeng was about to give chase.

If the Sword Mark was lost under their watch, they would become the eternal sinners of Hengyun Sword City!

“The Sword Mark!” Bai Jinghong and the other two also seemed ready to fight desperately.

“Wait!”

Suddenly, a clear and bright voice rang out: “The Sword Mark is still in its original place! Don't be fooled by the demoness's illusion!”

Still in its original place?

How could that be? They weren't blind...

Just as everyone was filled with doubt and hesitation.

“You little thief...”

Yin Mianmian gritted her silver teeth. Her figure suddenly split into a dozen or so Heavenly Maiden phantoms, sweeping toward the empty spot.

At this moment.

*That* ice lump made her move.

A light that did not belong to this world rose.

It was still the overbearing nature of the Divine霄 Heavenly Heart Sword, but the original heartless indifference toward all living things had turned into clarity and tranquility.

This sword illuminated the illusory, reaching straight for the truth.

Sword Heart Illumination!

Yin Mianmian’s pupils shrank.

Ying Bing, who executed that sword strike, her skirt fluttering, her face serene, looked like a bright moon in a lake that the wind could not ripple.

She truly looked like an immortal descending to the mortal world.

“I don't need to make a move anymore.”

Li Mo was also surprised by the power of the Sword Heart Illumination.

He silently put away the Star Seed Pestle, sighing internally.

Just look at the ice lump. Her strength and beauty have always been proportional; the stronger she gets, the more peerless and ethereal she becomes.

Why is it that he is so good with a hammer...

The true immortal naturally shattered the false heavenly maiden with a single sword, and the ten thousand alluring phantoms dissipated in an instant.

But the sword strike was not over yet.

*Crack—*

Something seemed to shatter.

It was the strange illusion that had been covering the Sword Mark Strange Stone.

Yes.

The Sword Mark Strange Stone had been in its original spot the entire time, unmoved.

It was just temporarily shrouded by the demonic illusion that Yin Mianmian had extracted.

The reason she could simulate an illusion even more bizarre than a domain, and the reason her aura was not as strong as an Eight-Aperture expert, was likely due to this.
