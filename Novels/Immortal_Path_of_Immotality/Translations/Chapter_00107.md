# Chapter 107: An Alternative Path

Upon hearing that the Left True Master, the chief proprietor, wished to see him, Lin Shan didn't dare delay and immediately followed the maid to the fifth floor.

In the incense-filled, antique reception hall, an eyebrowless old man sat reclining in a chair, idly rolling two iron balls in his hand with his eyes closed. A cup of steaming tea sat on the table beside him.

"Junior Lin Shan pays respects to Left True Master."

"Sit!"

Lin Shan took a seat as instructed. The Left True Master continued playing with the iron balls with his eyes closed but began discussing the upcoming auction.

"This year's Yichuan Auction is about to begin, and your emergence from seclusion is perfectly timed."

"In previous years, the auction was always presided over by the former chief appraiser, Elder Zhang. Now that you've taken his position, it should technically fall to you to host the auction in two days."

Lin Shan listened quietly, knowing the Left True Master wouldn't speak without purpose.

"However, your cultivation hasn't reached Foundation Establishment. You likely wouldn't be able to command the respect of the gathering or withstand the pressure from various factions. Therefore, I've assigned the hosting duties to someone else."

"What do you think?"

Though the Left True Master's tone was mild, there was no room for negotiation—he was simply stating facts.

"I defer entirely to the True Master's judgment!"

Lin Shan understood his superior's intent perfectly. He hadn't planned to host the auction anyway—his current cultivation level indeed couldn't handle the pressures. If bidding disputes arose, he'd be caught in the middle with no one showing him deference.

The Left True Master was simply prioritizing the auction's stability, which was perfectly reasonable.

Their conversation continued casually. Despite Lin Shan's low cultivation, his appraisal skills were genuine. Since joining the auction house, he hadn't made a single mistake—a true professional. The Left True Master offered some words of encouragement.

Lin Shan began to relax, thinking the meeting was merely a routine work discussion without any major issues. But another matter started stirring in his mind.

The Left True Master, a centuries-old Golden Core cultivator, immediately noticed his hesitation.

"You've reached the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refinement—it's time to prepare for Foundation Establishment, isn't it?"

"True Master's insight is impeccable!"

Lin Shan felt a flicker of excitement. If the Left True Master was willing to pull strings for him, perhaps there was hope for obtaining a Foundation Establishment Pill!

After all, he was a valued professional at the auction house. Maybe...

But before he could indulge in hopeful thoughts, reality doused him with cold water.

"This year's Foundation Establishment Pills at the auction have already been reserved by major families and sects. There likely won't be any extras. Even if I wanted to help you, I'm powerless."

Lin Shan's heart sank. The Left True Master's lack of eyebrows made his frown look bizarre, but Lin Shan was too preoccupied to notice.

This confirmation from the auction house's top authority meant there was truly no hope.

Foundation Establishment Pills were perpetually scarce, with auctions being the only potential source for rogue cultivators. If even this avenue was closed, others were certainly hopeless.

With only a year left before his agreement with the Black Lotus Sect, was his only option to attempt a forced breakthrough and leave it to fate?

Forced breakthroughs were possible, but the success rate was abysmally low—especially for first-timers attempting the "Qi and Spirit Fusion." Most would fail, adding another "Dao Scar" to their record.

Among rogue cultivators in the Foundation Establishment stage, few succeeded within three attempts. More Dao Scars made breakthroughs increasingly difficult, making forced attempts extremely risky.

As Lin Shan despaired, the Left True Master, not wanting to demoralize his subordinate, shifted the conversation.

"The Yichuan Auction holds small auctions annually and grand auctions every five years. Extra Foundation Establishment Pills for rogue cultivators only appear at grand auctions—the next one is in four years!"

"As my subordinate, I'll reserve one for you then. No need to worry."

For someone of the Left True Master's status, such a promise was ironclad. In his view, waiting four years for a guaranteed pill should be cause for celebration.

The former chief appraiser, Elder Zhang, had also relied on the Left True Master's help to obtain his Foundation Establishment Pill.

But Lin Shan wore a troubled expression.

Four years!

He'd need to wait four years!

From starting cultivation to reaching peak Qi Refinement had only taken him four years. Stagnating for another four would mean wasting precious time. By then, the three demonic sects might have already marched hundreds of thousands of troops deep into the Great Song's heartland.

With chaos looming, four years could bring earth-shaking changes. Who knew if Foundation Establishment Pills would still be available from major sects then?

And if he didn't join the Black Lotus Sect with the brothel owner before the demonic and orthodox factions clashed, entering afterward—even with a Foundation Establishment Pill—would be far more difficult.

Having a Golden Core demonic cultivator vouch for him was entirely different from going alone.

Still, Lin Shan appreciated the Left True Master's kindness. He promptly expressed his gratitude: "Many thanks for the True Master's consideration!"

The Left True Master wasn't bothered. He assumed Lin Shan, having reached peak Qi Refinement at a young age, was simply too ambitious to accept four years of stagnation.

But such was the cultivation world—the strong preyed on the weak, and resources were controlled by the powerful. Having a guaranteed opportunity in four years already placed Lin Shan above countless others, even if he didn't realize it.

Lin Shan soon took his leave, deciding not to attend the auction in two days. With the Foundation Establishment Pills already reserved and his own finances limited, attending would only torment him with what he couldn't have.

However, he'd anticipated the difficulty of obtaining a Foundation Establishment Pill through conventional means. For Qi Refinement cultivators, these life-altering pills were nearly impossible for rogue cultivators to acquire.

But was Lin Shan ordinary?

His enhancement panel had accumulated substantial ancient essence—it was time to put it to use.

...

"Two paths lie before me."

Lin Shan reviewed his long-prepared plans.

"First, the Foundation Establishment Pill recipe isn't secret—it's the five-hundred-year main ingredients that are rare. If I can find younger versions of these ingredients and enhance them to sufficient age, I could prepare to refine the pill."

"But Foundation Establishment Pills aren't ordinary. Without advanced alchemy skills, I'd need to hire an alchemist."

"Hiring one comes with risks—not only uncertain success rates but also potential embezzlement."

Lin Shan had no qualms assuming the worst in others. In the ruthless cultivation world, everyone pursued their own interests.

What alchemist wouldn't embezzle? Probably none.

A batch of Foundation Establishment Pill ingredients was worth tens of thousands of spirit stones. Depending on the alchemist's skill, one batch could yield anywhere from one to over a dozen pills.

If he was unlucky and failed to break through with one pill, he'd need another—and another.

Embezzlement was one thing, but wasting his enhanced ingredients without success would be catastrophic. All that ancient essence would be for nothing.

What if he refined the pills himself? Possible, but...

Could his alchemy skills reach that level in a year?

The enhancement panel strengthened specific spells and abilities, not broad skills like alchemy. It couldn't instantly transform a novice into a master—no such shortcuts existed.

The six arts of cultivation—alchemy, artifact forging, beast taming, formations, puppetry, and talismans—each were vast fields requiring extensive knowledge and practice. There were no simple "skill books" to master them.

Current alchemy apprentices learned through oral teachings or manuals covering basic pharmacology, material identification, heat control, and flame techniques.

Every alchemy master or grandmaster honed their craft through fragmented knowledge and years of trial and error. Success rates varied for each pill and recipe, requiring individual practice.

Thus, disciples of major sects typically waited until Foundation Establishment, with its extended lifespan, before considering mastering an art. Higher cultivation realms also provided deeper spiritual power, making learning easier.

If Lin Shan studied alchemy now, he might manage low-to-mid-tier pills. But for high-tier pills like Foundation Establishment Pills—third-grade magic pills—his chances were minuscule.

Without Foundation Establishment-level spiritual power or external divine sense for precise flame control, attempting high-tier alchemy would almost certainly waste centuries' worth of ingredients.

This path was too risky, leaving the second option: enhancing pills.

Unlike Qi Refinement bottleneck pills, Foundation Establishment Pills were prized for boosting Qi and Spirit Fusion success rates and eliminating Dao Scars.

Enhanced pills followed pharmacological rules. If a pill lacked his desired effects, enhancement could unpredictably add random functions—like opening a blind box.

Lin Shan sought only to aid "Qi and Spirit Fusion" and eliminate Dao Scars—nothing else.

But no low or mid-tier Qi Refinement pills combined both effects. No existing pill could be enhanced into a perfect Foundation Establishment Pill substitute.

Yet where one door closed, another opened. After four years with the enhancement panel, Lin Shan knew its potential extended far beyond conventional uses.

Without a suitable pill to enhance, there was another workaround.

That was...

Following the recipe and pharmacology, first create an "ultra-low-grade" Foundation Establishment Pill.
