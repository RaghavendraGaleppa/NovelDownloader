**Chapter 113: Respecting Opponents**

Forests of tassel trees stood tall, their petals pure white and flawless, hanging down like tassels, resembling clouds and snow, blooming in full glory and swaying in the wind.

Ren Yiping coughed up blood, encountering several elite disciples who had been his allies here. They looked at each other in silence, all knowing exactly what had happened – they had been driven out by the same person.

This place was already close to the exit. Their steps were heavy, and faintly, they could hear the fervent discussions from outside.

Outside the ruins of Luofu Immortal Mountain, some people wore smiles, while others remained silent, all awaiting the final outcome.

"The situation is already very clear. Now is the stage to turn advantage into victory. Ren Yiping, Luo Qingge, Jiang Shengyu…"

Hearing his name mentioned, Ren Yiping coughed up blood again. He had failed his sect's expectations. As a loser, he was destined to be scrutinized with strange gazes once he emerged. Immediately, he began spitting blood, his vision blurred, and he actually fell backward onto the ground. Several elite disciples rushed to help him up.

"Are you sure you don't need to send someone in to search for Li Qingyue? If such a heaven-blessed core disciple perishes unexpectedly, it wouldn't be good."

Someone spoke, though it was hard to tell if he genuinely wished to save her out of goodwill or maliciously wished to stir up controversy.

"If we go to save her now and are accused of breaking the rules by interfering, who will take responsibility? Besides, if someone enters and secretly attacks a disciple, wouldn't the consequences be even more severe?"

"You people, you really don't appreciate good intentions. If she dies in there, it's a loss for our Land Beyond the World. The Great Reclamation is inevitable, and peerless prodigies should shine brightly in the depths of the unknown Night Mist World…"

Some remained silent, others sneered, finding his words disingenuous. Yet, they all pondered; even some conservative ancient orthodoxies were no longer sealing their mountains, preparing for the upcoming era of great expansion.

"Oh, someone is being carried out! Could it be Li Qingyue?"

"How could it be… Ren Yiping?!"

Outside the ruins, many people were in an uproar.

Soon, the area fell silent, as the situation's development was completely different from their conjectures.

An elite disciple informed them that Li Qingyue was "clearing the field" inside the ruins!

The words "Li Qingyue" combined with "clearing the field" caused a small group of people who had earlier worn smiles and maintained a reserved demeanor to lose their composure.

"Haha…" An old man found the expressions of the crowd quite amusing and burst into laughter, regardless of others' feelings.

One of Li Qingyue's senior brothers finally spoke, "Should we go in to save her now?"

He knew deeply that his junior sister's retreat route was the Mountain River Spirit Nest. Logically, others shouldn't know about this place, but he had harbored a slight worry that some senior elders, with their deep experience, might have seen some secret scrolls. Now, he was completely relieved!

No one at the scene responded. A portion of the crowd felt a tightness in their chests, realizing they had been too premature and "raised their cups" in celebration too soon!

At this moment, a figure shrouded in immortal mist inexplicably appeared and said, "Li Qingyue is good. To be able to break out of the encirclement of five core disciples, and then return to forcefully clear the field, it would be even better if she could obtain a near-immortal object!"

Everyone's hearts trembled. This seemed to be an old senior from the Land Beyond the World, one who did not fear Li Qingxu's master.

Li Qingyue and Qin Ming neared the final battlefield. After traversing a large area of beautiful, mist-shrouded mountains, the core area revealed itself before them.

There were no plants or trees here. The ground was crystallized, faintly glowing as if coated in wax.

After careful observation, Qin Ming understood what had happened: in ancient times, endless heavenly light had descended from beyond the world, sinking the core area. That violent temperature had melted this place.

This was originally the main peak of Luofu Immortal Mountain, but now only a giant pit remained, with heavenly light flowing within it, not dissipating even after thousands of years.

The deep pit was truly enormous, like a natural chasm stretching across the land. Nearby were many broken mountains, standing at the edge of the great pit, either fractured or riddled with holes like a honeycomb, from which heavenly light also emanated.

"What a good place!" Qin Ming exclaimed.

Some disciples from the Land Beyond the World had already arrived nearby. Someone heard his words and looked sideways. The main peak of Luofu Immortal Mountain was gone, yet someone called it a good place?

Qin Ming, seeing the lingering heavenly light from beyond, felt particularly envious.

"Are you really capable?" Li Qingyue looked at him, somewhat worried. After all, that was violent heavenly light, something even she found daunting.

The consciousness spirit light cultivated by those from beyond the world, according to extremely ancient legends, was initially considered "Yin God" and was most afraid of heavenly light erosion. It required "transcending tribulation" or being baptized by "immortal fire" to become completely fearless.

Li Qingyue had ascended another small step in the Mountain River Spirit Nest this time, almost reaching a crossroads where she needed to consider whether to "transcend tribulation" or bathe in "immortal fire."

Of course, although there were legends, most people from beyond the world did not endorse the "Yin God" theory.

Because the ancient texts unearthed in the past could not actually be used for cultivation.

In those days, after humanity battled gigantic beasts and confronted mountain-sized abnormal plants to gain a foothold in the Night Mist World, they excavated some ancient texts, many of which were related to religion.

In the era with a sun, those were merely ordinary religious writings.

But after the books were unearthed, they gave many people in the Night Mist World inspiration. Although they weren't cultivation methods, they eventually led to the development of various inheritances.

The ancient legends of gods and monsters are not recognized by people today.

Currently, all paths have not reached their end and are still developing; this is also another form of "Great Reclamation."

"Everyone, the heavenly light remaining in the giant pit is still quite dense. If we force our way down, it will burn our nascent consciousness spirit light and damage our foundations. This surely isn't the intention of the seniors from the Land Beyond the World. They are testing us; they probably want us to help them clear the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, to guide the heavenly light out, hoping to rebuild this place! This requires us to work together." Someone spoke, suggesting cooperation.

Because this would be a "great project."

But most people remained silent, having their own considerations and plans.

"Don't worry, not only can I withstand it, I'm going to use this place to complete another rebirth," Qin Ming said, sounding somewhat impatient.

Li Qingyue still had misgivings and said, "Don't rush, I'll look around first."

This time, she didn't plan to reveal her true face. She could strike at any moment, making some people taste bitterness. For this, Qin Ming buried the Overlord's Spear on the path to avoid being too conspicuous and exposing his and Li Qingyue's identities.

Qin Ming, clad in golden armor, also circled the enormous heavenly pit. It was hard to imagine how intense the heavenly light from beyond must have been back then, not only obliterating the immortal mountain's main peak but also carving out such a massive "hole."

He heard some people discussing that besides Tang Xumi, Su Jingshu, Jiang Shengyu, and Luo Qingge, the core disciples who had teamed up, there were actually two others qualified to contend for the near-immortal object.

One was named Hu Tingwen, rumored earlier to be in closed-door cultivation and thus not arriving at Luofu Immortal Town. Yet, after everyone entered the ruins, he appeared at the very last moment, just in time.

The other was Sun Jingtian, who had been mingling among the elite disciples but revealed his strength, capable of fighting core disciples, when he got into a conflict with someone.

Moreover, these two had already formed an alliance.

Tang Xumi, Su Jingshu, Jiang Shengyu, and Luo Qingge's faces darkened upon learning this. After they had teamed up to deal with Li Qingyue, the four of them had already fallen out, and they hadn't expected two more lurking behind them, only to be exposed by accident.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming felt that these disciples were truly resorting to all sorts of methods for the near-immortal object.

A long time later, Li Qingyue returned. Because the pit was so vast, her expression was solemn. She secretly transmitted a message with a secret art: "I swept with my spiritual eyes and inadvertently caught a wisp of Cui Chonghe's consciousness spirit light. He still has a trump card."

Qin Ming immediately became serious. None of these disciples were easy to deal with; people thought to be out of the game were still lurking in the dark.

He thought for a moment and asked, "Should we expose him, or use him?"

Li Qingyue replied, "The people here don't know I've returned. Let's first observe Cui Chonghe's methods. He'd best eliminate some opponents. If necessary, at a crucial moment, I will intercept him."

"Can you deal with him now?" Qin Ming asked.

"No major problem. He only split off a portion of his consciousness spirit light, not all of it. Moreover, his current possession target isn't his blood-relative younger brother, Cui Chongxuan, so the compatibility definitely isn't good enough. Furthermore, I've broken through in the Mountain River Spirit Nest, so I'm not afraid of this version of him now."

Most crucially, Li Qingyue was in the dark, while Cui Chonghe had exposed himself to her.

Qin Ming said, "There's also Li Qingxu. He hasn't left since being injured; perhaps he has some hidden moves too."

...

The two separated. Qin Ming prepared to enter the heavenly pit for his sixth rebirth! Li Qingyue, on the other hand, intended to keep a low profile, not wanting to attract anyone's attention, and only make her move at the last moment.

Qin Ming saw familiar faces like Wang Caiwei, Zheng Maoze, and Chen Bingyan but didn't approach them. He found a sparsely populated area and quietly entered the scene.

At the edge of the bowl-shaped deep pit, the heavenly light was very sparse, something many newly ascended cultivators could tolerate.

Upon entering, Qin Ming found some golden-armored guards, all occupying advantageous positions, cautiously refining the sparse heavenly light.

"Who is that? He just charged straight in."

"Could it be Jiang Congyun from Pure Yang Palace? That sect's force can shatter consciousness light and even integrate a certain amount of heavenly light from beyond."

Qin Ming continued downwards, and as the heavenly light became less sparse, he felt a scorching heat.

He successively discovered masters, all sitting in quiet meditation, trying to integrate the heavenly light into their flesh and blood.

These individuals could not stay here for long and needed to quickly return to the surface after a short while.

Qin Ming spotted several people from afar, paying them extra attention.

He saw someone practicing the Five-Colored Thunderfire Art, integrating heavenly light, creating quite a commotion with accompanying thunder.

He then saw another person who resembled a blazing sun, absorbing heavenly light and merging with it.

Even more, a hazy figure let out an ape's roar, his whole body seemingly swelling, surging with the power of heavenly light, as if wanting to ignite himself. His black pupils were even scorched to emit brilliant golden light.

Qin Ming realized that if he were to obtain the near-immortal object, these people would be able to obstruct him for a period. They had strong resistance against heavenly light erosion.

"That must be the Five Elements Palace's inheritor," he thought, seeing a person sitting on a distant black-gold rock, with five-colored light flowing around them as they refined the heavenly light.

"The Jade Clarity Art inheritor has indeed arrived!" Qin Ming became serious. He saw a young man who actually directly inhaled the light mist through his nose and mouth, devouring the heavenly light.

The young man's entire body was translucent like jade, enveloped by heavenly light, yet unharmed, appearing very composed, treating the violent light mist as food.

Qin Ming also took a breath. It was somewhat scorching, with a slight stinging sensation.

He knew that these people were all potential opponents. Once the near-immortal object was touched, everyone would rush towards him to obstruct him.

"I'll just watch others pluck it," Qin Ming muttered to himself.

He wanted to silently enhance his strength here, to face those people in his strongest state.

After descending another hundred meters, his body felt like it was being scorched.

"It still can't compare to the heavenly light in the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall, and the spiritual essence is far less concentrated," Qin Ming gritted his teeth, enduring the pain, and charged straight to the bottom.

"Hiss!" He nearly cried out, and as he gasped, he choked, spitting fire from his mouth and nose. The heavenly light at the bottom was too violent, and he had to quickly retreat.

The intensity of the heavenly light here was slightly lower than in the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall, but the total amount was far greater, engulfing him to the point where he could barely endure it.

"Heavenly light is everywhere, but the density of spiritual substances is somewhat lacking. It seems I'm in for some suffering; I'll have to continuously absorb it."

Thus, Qin Ming began his difficult path of rebirth. To fully embrace the heavenly light, he took off his protective golden robes, armor, and other gear.

He entered the bottom repeatedly, absorbing the violent heavenly light and spiritual substances. To avoid startling others, he couldn't make a big commotion. He spent a full half-day doing this.

"The sixth rebirth has begun!" His body was burning hot.

He began practicing the Yin Earth Art and Yang Earth Art, evolving them into the Wuji Art. If he could fully integrate the third miraculous art, his strength would greatly increase.

"Heavenly light is everywhere here. Not just Wuji Fist, perhaps the Lihuo Scripture and Golden Silkworm Art can also undergo further transformation here!" Qin Ming continuously practiced his arts, feeling the changes within himself, eager to grow stronger. This was out of respect for his opponents.
