Chapter 430: Displaying Divine Might Before the World

The Sword Intent surged, and Zhou Xingzhenren’s Five Elements Foundation trembled violently before shattering like a bubble. The sea of fire was extinguished, the golden weapons crumbled, the giant trees withered, the water waves evaporated, and the earth and stones disintegrated!

"No! This is impossible!!"

Zhou Xingzhenren let out a desperate roar, watching helplessly as his foundation was severed by Xu Yunfan’s sword. He was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Even though suppressed by the laws of this world, allowing him to exert only fifty percent of his true power, he shouldn't have been defeated by an ordinary early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

A trace of regret rose in his heart. This time, he had been too rash and reckless. He hadn't even tested the waters properly, so why had he plunged headfirst into the Divine Martial World?

Suddenly, he came to a realization and looked up with a wild howl.

"True Lord!"

He had been set up by a True Lord. Trapped in the scheme, his mind had been clouded, and he only realized the truth now that death was upon him.

But the sword light had already arrived. The True Martial Sword pierced his glabella, and the Sword Intent exploded. The Purple Robed Elder's soul, foundation, and physical body were all obliterated by this single strike!

*Thump!*

The Purple Robed Elder's corpse fell, his Five Elements Foundation dissipated. The Dao of the Divine Martial World sensed the fall of a foreign Foundation Establishment cultivator and actually descended a wisp of pure qi, merging it into Xu Yunfan's body as a reward for his merit in slaying an outsider.

Xu Yunfan was slightly surprised by this, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of joy. If this was the case, then if he lured more Foundation Establishment cultivators into the Divine Martial World to be slaughtered, wouldn't he earn the favor of this world's Dao? Perhaps then he could even harvest a portion of the Divine Martial World's origin to forge his own Cave Heaven. If he went a step further...

Xu Yunfan's eyes shone brightly as he looked out at the entire world.

It seemed that forming a Cave Heaven wasn't so difficult after all...

He snapped back to reality instantly. Wasn't this exactly what the Divine Martial True Lord wanted when he slaughtered over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators? For this sake, he even reincarnated in the Divine Martial World to completely cleanse himself, gaining this world's mark. By slaying foreign demons, he naturally received the Dao's reward.

After a long while, he sheathed his sword and stood tall, his cold gaze fixed on the few wisps of ash left by Zhou Xingzhenren.

Let his myriad techniques roll like tides and his ten thousand divine abilities weave a net; Xu Yunfan’s True Martial Sword, operating under the divine ability of the Battle Formula, could unleash terrifying power.

Where the sword edge reached, the Celestial Thunder Demon-Suppressing Qi stirred the four wilds.

The sword light was as thick and sharp as the Black Tortoise manifesting its divine might. Every move secretly aligned with the star phenomena of the True武 Seven Mansions, forcibly cutting down Zhou Xingzhenren's Five Elements Foundation.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath and let out a cold snort.

"A mere mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to compete with me in the Divine Martial World?"

After putting on a show of dominance, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate any longer.

He put away the True Martial Sword. As he walked through the air, he deliberately slowed his pace. Instead of using a flight technique, he naturally generated a cloud under his feet bearing Black Tortoise patterns, advancing via the method of riding clouds and mist.

Having returned to his old haunts, he naturally needed to be a bit ostentatious; otherwise, who would know that he had returned with success?

Passing by the Dao Sect's mountain gate, a green streamer suddenly lit up the horizon, like a meteor streaking across the sky.

The disciples guarding the mountain hadn't even had time to react when a vast, sea-like mysterious aura swept over them.

The protective array, which had weathered a thousand years of wind and frost and had only barely recovered some of its luster with the recent emergence of spiritual energy, crumbled inch by inch under this pressure like paper. The mournful cries of the collapsing array patterns echoed through the mountains.

Xu Yunfan stood on a cloud with his hands behind his back, his gaze like a torch as he swept it over the broken formation below.

He saw that the array patterns were arranged in a chaotic mess, the spiritual energy nodes were full of errors, and they hadn't even managed to connect the most basic principles of the Five Elements generating each other.

What was even more ridiculous was that several key array eyes were actually forged from mortal iron, long since covered in rust.

"This crude array formation probably can't even block a Qi Refining initial-stage cultivator," he shook his head and sighed, a hint of melancholy in his voice. "When I left the mountain back then, this array was still mostly incomplete. It's barely operational now, although it's unsystematic and follows a rogue path. Still, it has formed a trend. Given time, it might not be impossible to nurture another protective mountain array using the earth's veins."

"My array formation!"

A mournful cry suddenly erupted, the sound waves carrying true energy ripples that bounced back and forth between the thirty-six peaks of Qingwei Mountain.

The Head of the Pill Hall, who was mixing medicinal liquids in the alchemy room, trembled, and the entire furnace of potent blood-energy pills exploded into green smoke with a *bang*. A Nine-Realm Supreme Elder in seclusion was startled by the noise, causing his sword qi to flow backward and carve a seven-zhang-deep sword mark on the stone wall.

The Black Tortoise cloud pattern under Xu Yunfan's feet suddenly stalled, and a look of surprise flashed across his face.

He swore he had only used his Foundation Establishment-level divine sense to sweep over the array eye.

It was as natural as casually glancing at a flower bud while passing by a garden.

Who could have imagined that this protective mountain array was as fragile as a paper lantern, tearing open a huge gap with just a slight touch of a breeze.

On the mountainside, Elder Shen, responsible for maintaining the array, was holding half of an array flag in a daze.

This flag, forged from thousand-year-old cold iron, had turned into brittle straw, crumbling into iron powder between his fingers.

The old man's goatee trembled violently, and he suddenly spat a mouthful of heart blood, staining the Bagua pattern on his chest red.

"My array flag that I nurtured for sixty years! This was a treasure left by our ancestors two thousand years ago, and it's gone just like that!!"

Amidst the wailing, the defensive talismans all over Qingwei Mountain exploded one after another, turning into a sky full of golden powder in the morning light, looking from a distance like a shower of golden snow.

"Who goes th—"

Bi Yuan's sonorous voice suddenly rang out across the heavens, only to cut off abruptly, as if choked by an invisible force.

The Sect Master's pupils shrank as he stared fixedly at the figure walking on the clouds.

The figure was surrounded by clear qi. With every step he took, the Dao patterns of a turtle and snake entwining naturally appeared under his feet.

The fallen leaves on the mountain path moved without wind, arranging themselves into the star chart of the True武 Seven Mansions along the path he walked.

What was even more terrifying was that when Bi Yuan tried to probe him, he felt his true qi as if it had fallen into the Northern Abyss Cold Abyss, and even his blood and qi were frozen!

"...Yunfan?"

Bi Yuan's voice carried a tremor of disbelief.

The fallen leaves on the mountain path moved without wind, seemingly drawn by the aura around Xu Yunfan, slowly rotating according to some pattern.

Beside him, a Supreme Elder with white hair and beard, holding a divine weapon, had his long eyebrows twitching incessantly.

How could he not recognize the figure in the sky? He had stepped into the Land Immortal Realm at just thirty, suppressed the world, and easily destroyed the other five major sects. Now, within the Great Zhou borders, only the Dao Sect remained.

"Master."

The moment this call rang out, Bi Yuan's black Dao robe suddenly billowed without wind, and the hems fluttered noisily.

As he turned, the fingers clenched in his sleeves couldn't help but loosen slightly.

Watching Xu Yunfan walk over on the clouds, he was both surprised and delighted.

Looking at the figure three zhang away, Xu Yunfan deliberately stirred up a phenomenon. A Black Tortoise phantom entwined with a snake wrapped around him. With every step he took, True武 cloud patterns appeared on the green stones beneath him.

What was even more startling was that Bi Yuan's realm of "Spirit Merging with the Dao," which he had painstakingly cultivated for sixty years, was like snow facing the scorching sun before this aura. The thick true qi in his body retreated uncontrollably into the depths of his flesh and blood.

"Yunfan?"

Looking at Xu Yunfan before him, Bi Yuan's voice trembled, a rare occurrence, as he called out again to confirm.
