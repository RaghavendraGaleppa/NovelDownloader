# Chapter 34: If Not Now, Then When?

The foremost principle of cultivation is that safety comes first.

Especially when it comes to matters unrelated to personal interests, one must always seek clarity.

"Those second-grade spirit herbs were discovered in a demon beast's lair, but the beast has already been slain by our clan leader. Moreover, this time, our family's Foundation Establishment elder will accompany us," Liu Yiting explained quickly, though she hadn't expected Zhang Yan to ask such a question.

"And you're a disciple of Qingheng Sect—how could anything happen to you in the Tianmu Mountains?"

The Tianmu Mountains were originally a range dominated by demon beasts. It wasn't until the founding ancestor of Qingheng Sect arrived, cleared the mountains of monsters, and established the sect that cultivation families were able to settle there.

However, the demon beasts in the Tianmu Mountains were never fully eradicated. They merely retreated to the deeper parts of the range, forced into hiding by Qingheng Sect's might. Each generation of Qingheng disciples would venture out to slay these beasts, expanding their territory.

This was precisely why Qingheng Sect remained the absolute ruler of the Tianmu Mountains—an undisputed hegemon. The presence of demon beasts as an external threat also fostered an unparalleled unity within the sect, far surpassing that of ordinary sects.

No one dared to provoke Qingheng Sect.

"Alright, let's go take a look then."

With his identity as a Qingheng disciple and the protection of the Liu family's Foundation Establishment elder, safety was assured.

With that in mind, Zhang Yan followed Liu Yiting to meet the Liu family elder.

"The clan leader is waiting for us. There's no time to waste. We appreciate your assistance, Fellow Daoist Zhang. Rest assured, once we retrieve the spirit herbs, our Liu family will reward you handsomely!" 

The Liu family elder, his face lined with wrinkles and hair white with age, spoke to Zhang Yan with utmost politeness.

"Many thanks, Elder!" Zhang Yan nodded.

The elder raised his hand, releasing a streak of green light that swirled in the air before transforming into a gourd.

"Let's go. Yiting, guide the way." The elder stepped onto the gourd and settled at the front.

The gourd wasn't large. With the elder seated, Liu Yiting and Zhang Yan had to squeeze in close together. Zhang Yan could even catch the faint fragrance from Liu Yiting, but he paid it no mind. How could a cultivator allow trivial matters like romance to hinder their path?

---

Perhaps due to urgency, the Liu family elder accelerated the flying gourd relentlessly, leaving Liu Yiting pale with fright. Instinctively, she clutched Zhang Yan's robe.

Far from panicking, Zhang Yan was almost amused. 

Though the elder seemed skilled at controlling the flying artifact, he was nowhere near as proficient as Mu Sen. Back when Mu Sen had lent him the Greenwood Boat, Zhang Yan had experienced the pinnacle of flying techniques—daring maneuvers, full-speed dashes through dense forests—all possible with the perfected-level sailing skill from the equipment.

This elder? Not even close.

Despite his internal comparisons, Zhang Yan remained silent, occasionally offering a few words of praise—always hitting the right notes to keep the elder pleased.

Two hours later, they arrived at a valley deep within the Tianmu Mountains.

"It's inside there," Liu Yiting pointed toward a mist-shrouded valley.

"Good. Let's proceed." The elder nodded, but the moment he extended his divine sense, his expression darkened. "Something's wrong—this mist blocks divine sense!"

"We're ambushed!" 

The elder wasted no time. Without another thought for the clan leader inside the valley, he turned the gourd around and fled with Zhang Yan and Liu Yiting in tow.

As they retreated, he muttered, "The demon beast must've gone the other way. Let's search elsewhere."

Liu Yiting was frozen in shock, her eyes darting around in confusion. Zhang Yan tugged her sleeve. "Don't look around."

Then, playing along with the elder, he added, "You're right, Elder. The beast must've fled west. Let's check there."

Their act was seamless.

But just as the elder turned, a surge of terrifying spiritual pressure erupted from the valley.

"So the old man noticed after all!"

A sword aura sliced through the air, felling trees in its path with a force that sent chills down their spines.

"Scatter!" 

The elder flung out a barrage of talismans—wind blades, fireballs, ice arrows—all colliding with the sword aura. Though the attacks weakened it slightly, the aura still struck the elder's protective barrier, nearly shattering it.

"Zhou family!" The elder spat the name through gritted teeth. "You dare ambush us?"

"Hah! Hypocrite! Didn't your Liu family seize our spirit mine last time? You brought this upon yourselves!"

Four figures emerged from the valley. 

The leader, a middle-aged man with a thick beard, stood atop a sword case, his flying sword hovering above him like an immortal. The three behind him were younger, all at the late Qi Refining stage, riding patched paper kites.

"Where is our clan leader?" the elder demanded, eyes burning.

"Dead. And you'll join him soon. Your Liu family will follow." 

The bearded man flicked his finger, and his sword gleamed ominously.

"Run!" the elder barked. "Get back to the family—offer the alchemy secrets to Qingheng Sect for protection!" 

With only two Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Liu family would be doomed if both perished here. Better to surrender their secrets and seek the sect's shelter than be wiped out by enemies.

"Elder, I won't leave you!" Liu Yiting sobbed.

Before she could protest further, Zhang Yan knocked her unconscious with a swift strike. 

"Take care, Elder!" 

With Liu Yiting in his arms, he shot into the distance like a comet.

If not now, then when?
