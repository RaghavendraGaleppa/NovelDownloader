# Chapter 83: Blackwater Port, Selling the Hunt

At this moment, his Qi was as dense as a lake, incredibly vast.

This level of strength was already quite impressive. This Qi flowed from within his body, warding off external evils and strengthening his spirit, bringing many benefits.

Li Xian suddenly felt an urge. He condensed his Qi and threw a punch, executing the Four Directions Fist Technique. He observed that the more Qi he channeled, the more potent the fist force became, and the greater the power.

Qi condensed at the fist's edge as he struck a tree.

His bones were tough, his sinews and skeleton robust. With this punch, the tree trunk caved in, and the bark cracked apart, revealing the heart of the tree.

Snow accumulated on the branches scattered across the ground.

"My martial arts have grown stronger."

"Let me try this move!"

Li Xian rested for a moment, then raised his Qi to execute the fist technique again. He saw his fist split into several strikes, with shadows overlapping, as if several giant hands had sprouted from thin air. It was incredibly strange.

Qi originates from martial arts.

Qi flows into martial arts.

Qi and martial arts complement each other, and wonders naturally manifest. The path of martial arts has endless variations, allowing one to devote a lifetime to it and never tire of it.

At the village entrance.

"Grandpa Li, what brings you here?"

Heavy snow had fallen in Black River Village last night.

The road was covered in deep snow. Fu Bo, old and frail, leaned on a cane and wore a thick jacket. He was directing the villagers to clear the snow and open a path.

While he was busy, he saw Li Xian walking toward him.

Fu Bo couldn't hide his surprise. He thought it had been some time since he last saw Li Xian. Seeing him now, he vaguely felt that Li Xian had grown much taller.

He had the appearance of a young man.

His skin was very fair, but not effeminate, giving him a clear and handsome look.

The farmers didn't really know what "good-looking" meant. They just felt this guard looked pleasing to the eye and instinctively wanted to look at him a few more times.

"Fu Bo, clearing the snow?" Li Xian smiled.

"Yes," Fu Bo said, pointing to the side. "There's an old ox in the village. We were sentimentally attached and wanted to let it live a little longer. But... the harvest this year is really poor, and we don't have much food left."

"We have no other choice but to take it to the city and sell it. We can buy some rice and grain to last us a bit longer."

"Hopefully, when spring comes next year, things will be better."

Fu Bo looked at the old ox in the village with heartache.

An old farmer and an old ox, they shared a deep bond.

Li Xian said, "Coincidentally, I'm going that way too."

"Oh," Fu Bo asked, "Grandpa Li, are you also going to Blackwater Port?"

"That's right," Li Xian nodded.

He had hunted "tigers," "deer," and "leopards," and the meat had already been eaten. But the fur, bones, teeth, and claws could be sold for a good price.

"That's wonderful! With Grandpa Li accompanying us, we won't be afraid of the big tigers anymore." Fu Bo was overjoyed and immensely grateful. He added:

"Grandpa Li, I've never seen such a good person as you."

"You know, after hunting the game, you even thought of sharing... sharing some with us. This... this..."

Li Xian shook his head and said, "It's nothing. I can't finish it all, so it's useless to keep it."

The empire was in turmoil, and Black River Village was especially poor. It had land but no water, and it was often harassed by the Mountain Wind Stronghold.

Every household endured hunger and cold, which was truly pitiful.

Li Xian knew he didn't have the power to save the world, but he still had a compassionate heart. After eating his fill, he generously gave the remaining food to the villagers.

A few bowls of deer soup and some game meat saved a few lives, preventing some from starving or freezing to death.

But it was still a drop in the bucket. Li Xian felt a sense of helplessness, but he had a clear conscience.

Blackwater Port was upstream on the Blackwater River and was the territory of the Blackwater Gang.

The old ox's steps were slow, leaving one footprint at a time.

The accompanying villagers couldn't bear to look at the old ox, and occasional sobs could be heard.

Oxen could plow fields and were very intelligent. People lived with them for ten or twenty years. A family would only sell their ox in utter desperation.

"Old ox, old ox."

"I'm so sorry."

Fu Bo wiped his tears.

The old ox seemed to understand and let out a "moo," with wet traces appearing at the corners of its eyes.

Li Xian packed the tiger, deer, and leopard skins into a coarse cloth sack and carried it on his back.

This trip was led by Village Head Fu Bo, with seven or eight young men following. Although they were going to the city for the market, the journey was very dull and not at all cheerful.

Li Xian didn't know where Blackwater Town was, so he followed the group, walking at a leisurely pace.

He couldn't help but think on the way:

"Blackwater Port is the territory of the Blackwater Gang. I must be extremely careful."

"But then again, they don't know my face, so it should be fine."

After walking for more than an hour.

Pedestrians grew more numerous. On a patch of yellow mud, stalls gathered, spontaneously forming a small market. There were people selling vegetables, clothes, and even selling themselves...

As they continued down the road, they came to a bluestone road, with houses and pavilions rising on all sides... Several magnificent buildings stood there, not inferior to any he had seen in his past or present lives.

"Fu Bo, I'll take my leave here."

Li Xian came to the bustling market and bid farewell with clasped fists.

Blackwater Port was built along the river and was very prosperous. Transportation, trade, and river goods were highly developed.

The Blackwater Gang controlled the river like kings, and the profits they skimmed can be imagined.

"If it weren't for this Blackwater Gang, the people living along the Blackwater River would be much better off."

"However... how could that be possible?"

"If the Blackwater Gang were destroyed, there would be a Red Water Gang or a Green Water Gang. This Blackwater River is so rich, such a huge piece of fat meat, someone will always have their eyes on it."

Li Xian tousled his hair and smeared some wall ash on his face.

He had worn plain clothes when he left, and aside from being a bit tall, he no longer attracted attention.

Turning a corner, he saw a hall with its gates wide open. Two black lions stood on either side, and the plaque read "Blackwater Gang."

Legend had it that these two black lions were originally from the riverbed. They were fished up and already had the shape of lions. Later, craftsmen carved them, making them even more lifelike and exuding an imposing aura.

"What an eye-catching stone lion!"

Li Xian nodded and secretly praised it, peering inside. A gang member guarding the door shouted, "What are you looking at? I'll gouge your eyes out if you look again!"

"Get lost."

"Alright."

Li Xian quickly left. He found it amusing. When Zheng Xuezhang came to his door to demand people, he was defeated. Now if Li Xian were to go there himself, he would probably be shouted away.

In the Great Wu Empire, the river network is dense.

The Blackwater River was extremely wide; the opposite bank was not visible. It was estimated to be several miles wide.

There were many ships on the river.

The Blackwater Gang's ships were conspicuous, being black, with large black lotuses embroidered on their sails. Ships passing by had to pay a river crossing fee, and ships coming here to do business had to pay an additional business fee.

"How overbearing, this style."

Li Xian watched for a moment when he suddenly saw a large ship.

It was magnificent, like a sea monster. His hearing was excellent, and he faintly heard cries and shouts. He looked up and saw a sail made of human bodies.

It was impossible to count how many people there were.

Their limbs had been cut off, and black rods were inserted through them, fixing them together like a string of grasshoppers.

"Big Brother, what crime did these people commit to be treated like this?"

Li Xian found a vendor at the port and asked casually.

The vendor said, "Sigh, what else could it be? They opposed the Blackwater Gang."

"There are probably a thousand or so people up there. Those who didn't pay taxes, owed rent, couldn't repay their loans, those the gang took a dislike to, those who committed crimes, and those who betrayed the gang."

"Look, at the very top, that man is Yang Cheng. He was one of the Thirteen Banner Leaders, but he betrayed the gang. See, he's been hung up there too."

Li Xian looked into the distance and recognized him in an instant.

"What a Blackwater Gang, truly savage!"
