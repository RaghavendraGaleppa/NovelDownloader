# Chapter 128: Eighteen Sword Patterns!

Di Yan Island, Stone Cavern.

On a green meditation cushion sat a handsome young Daoist, cross-legged. In his palm, a seven-story exquisitely carved jade tower flickered intermittently, enveloped by dense spiritual energy as he continuously refined it.

After a long while, the jade tower trembled slightly, as if emitting a joyful hum. Its body shone brilliantly, establishing a profound connection with the young man.

"Go!"

The young Daoist opened his eyes and uttered a soft command. The jade tower instantly expanded with the wind, growing to several zhang in size, its spiritual light shimmering as it hovered in the air.

"Roar!"

With a flick of his finger, a crimson flaming dragon phantom roared toward the jade tower. Yet, with just a slight tremor from the tower, the surrounding spiritual energy seemed to shatter, dispersing the dragon phantom into motes of light.

The young Daoist then unleashed a barrage of techniques, each met with the same fate—suppressed effortlessly by a mere flash of the jade tower's spiritual light.

A pleased expression crossed the young Daoist's face.

"As expected of a superior-grade spiritual artifact. With this treasure alone, ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators would find it difficult to contend with me..."

Today marked the seventh day since Gu Yuan's return from Jade Pot Peak.

For seven days and nights, he had tirelessly refined the Seven Phases Exquisite Tower. Crafted from Spirit-Sealing Jade, a rare material that naturally counters spiritual techniques and can only be found in third-tier or higher spiritual veins, the tower inherently resists even the refining process, requiring considerable effort.

But the effort was well worth it.

Even preliminary testing revealed the tower's formidable power—and this was merely its defensive capability. If he could capture the essence of earth spirits, its potency would increase further.

"The only drawback is the immense spiritual energy required to wield a superior-grade artifact. Even with my reserves far surpassing peers of my level, sustaining its use is taxing and cannot be maintained for long."

Feeling the rapid depletion of his dantian's energy, Gu Yuan sighed. Yet, every advantage comes with trade-offs. The tower still represented a significant boost to his strength.

"With this artifact, my confidence in conquering the Scarlet Moon Great River has grown. But the true key isn't the treasure—it's the connection with the Sage..."

Storing the tower, Gu Yuan recalled the events of seven days prior, his heart filled with reflection.

The journey to Jade Pot Peak had yielded immense rewards. Beyond acquiring the superior-grade artifact and the pinnacle sword seal, the most crucial gain was deepening his bond with the Sage.

In their previous encounters, though he had met the Sage, it was only through the fortuitous aid of the Stone Liquid. The Sage had barely acknowledged him then.

This time was different. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator leading six fellow disciples, he had finally earned the Sage's recognition and could now serve under him.

Opportunities mattered little without patronage. With a Golden Core Sage as his backing, he had finally secured a foundation, allowing him to act with confidence—a goal he had long pursued.

After all, the Azure Peak Dao Academy was no minor sect. Foundation Establishment cultivators held no absolute authority. Without strong backing, many endeavors would be fraught with hesitation and fear.

Now, at last, he had gained some assurance.

"Severed Heart Island..."

Yet this came at a price.

Gu Yuan's task was to seize Severed Heart Island during the campaign against the Scarlet Moon Great River.

Researching the archives, Gu Yuan learned of the island's origins. Severed Heart Island, located within the Scarlet Moon Great River, boasted a second-tier spiritual vein, abundant resources, and vast spiritual fields. Most importantly, it produced a peculiar herb—the Severed Heart Grass.

This herb could sever worldly attachments, purge distractions, and eliminate desires, hence its name. Though the Sage had not explicitly stated it, Gu Yuan knew this herb was the Sage's true objective.

He also understood that his knowledge of certain secrets was why he had been entrusted with this mission.

"The opportunity from the Silver Fish Island's Stone Book continues to bear fruit..."

Gu Yuan chuckled softly, his tone tinged with nostalgia.

This was the secret between him and the Sage. To maintain their bond, he needed to safeguard this secret and fulfill his mission diligently.

Yet, after the Sage's guidance, Gu Yuan realized the campaign against the Scarlet Moon Great River was far more complex than he had imagined. The task would not be easily accomplished.

He had to enhance his strength with utmost effort.

Closing his eyes to clear his mind, Gu Yuan retrieved the "Boundless Sword Seal" and began his contemplation.

---

"Boundless—without end!"

"As the heavens and earth are boundless, so too is the sword's radiance..."

"Dividing the sword's light into one strand is the mark of mediocrity. Dividing it into ten strands marks excellence. A hundred strands allow one to roam the heavens and earth. A thousand strands can topple mountains and part rivers. With boundless strands, the Dao itself becomes boundless..."

A sword is, above all, sharp.

The Boundless Sword Seal's unparalleled sharpness and ability to cut through all obstacles went without saying. But its most mystical aspect lay in its capacity to divide the sword's radiance, multiplying its power exponentially.

The more divisions, the mightier the sword technique became—a seal that could even be wielded beyond the Golden Core realm.

The secret to its cross-realm efficacy lay in its refinement method.

The seal's power did not reside in the object but in the wielder.

Those with mediocre comprehension could refine the seal with a single sword pattern. Those with extraordinary talent could refine it with ten.

The number of sword patterns determined the seal's potency.

Moreover, even after refinement, further comprehension of additional patterns could enhance the seal's power.

"Comprehension, then..."

Gu Yuan smiled faintly as his spiritual energy surged into a radiant golden seal within his dantian.

The golden seal blazed with light, elevating Gu Yuan's already exceptional comprehension to new heights.

The delicate script on the golden manual transformed before his eyes into dazzling sword patterns, each gleaming brilliantly. The profundities of the sword Dao unfolded before him as clearly as lines on his palm.

One, two, three... seven.

The sword patterns imprinted themselves onto his mind, each character a blade. A dazzling sharpness emanated from Gu Yuan's body, so intense it pained the eyes.

Eight, nine, ten...

Time flowed indistinctly as Gu Yuan's understanding of the sword patterns deepened.

Eleven, twelve... seventeen, eighteen.

"Boom!"

Countless golden lights shimmered resplendently. In Gu Yuan's eyes, streams of radiance swirled like fish, like cranes—myriad wondrous forms, each unique.

Yet, after a long while, the visions faded.

Gu Yuan's gaze returned to normal.

"Even with the golden seal, secluded cultivation can only yield eighteen sword patterns. To advance further, I must either elevate my cultivation or engage in sword duels..."

Eighteen sword patterns marked his current limit.

Surpassing this would require breakthroughs beyond his present realm.

Yet ten patterns already denoted excellence. Eighteen ensured his dominance among peers.

"Time is short. For now, I must refine the sword seal. Further patterns can be added later."

Exhaling deeply, Gu Yuan retrieved the Golden Bamboo Sword and the Gold-Star Grass.

A sword seal's power lay not only in technique but also in the weapon itself.

The finer the sword's quality, the greater its lethality—an immutable truth.

The Golden Bamboo Sword was a lower-grade spiritual artifact, capable of severing spirits and cutting metal. Yet after visiting Jade Pot Peak, Gu Yuan's standards had risen, and the sword now felt lacking.

Fortunately, the Gold-Star Grass could remedy this.

Infused with the essence of gold and the power of stars, the grass could elevate the sword's quality, potentially to mid-grade.

Unlike ordinary spiritual artifacts, a sword seal's efficacy diminished if its grade far exceeded the wielder's cultivation. A mid-grade spiritual sword was Gu Yuan's current limit.

Without his triple-cultivation foundation and exceptional spiritual reserves, even this would have been unattainable.
