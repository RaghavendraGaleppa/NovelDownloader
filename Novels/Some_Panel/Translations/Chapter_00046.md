# Chapter 46: Gui Zang Sword Art

"Li Changxiao?" Mang Biao exclaimed, "You are Li Changxiao, the most exceptionally talented genius disciple Canglan Sect has seen in a thousand years?"

"So you're my little brother's senior brother, huh?"

"Haha, one of us, one of us."

"This is truly a mix-up between our own people, causing unnecessary conflict."

Mang Biao spoke jovially to Li Changxiao, patting down his disheveled robes. He then walked over to Yang Ji, chuckling awkwardly, "Heh heh, little brother, I had no idea he was your senior brother. Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

[I never imagined you had such a background. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have dared to detain you even with a hundred guts.] Mang Biao inwardly lamented, his mind filled with [Worry] and [Unease], making him appear somewhat flustered.

Yang Ji glanced at him, then turned to Li Changxiao, cupping his hands in a bow, "So it is Senior Li Changxiao!"

"Still calling me senior? Alright, if you insist." Li Changxiao smiled faintly, the [Interested] above his head changing to [Somewhat Interesting].

Although Yang Ji had comprehended a move or two from the Sword Dao Imprint, he still didn't dare to casually form connections. After all, his innate potential was too poor, and the owner of the Sword Dao Imprint was a Nascent Soul True Monarch. Whether he would be accepted, out of face or not, was still a question.

Yang Ji was very clear-headed. Just like on Blue Star, trying to force connections would only invite scorn.

However, he was quite interested in what Li Changxiao had just said. He looked up and asked, "Senior, did you say I used the Gui Zang Sword Art just now?"

"Yes, what you used just now was precisely the Li Sword Dao within the Gui Zang Sword Art. The Li Sword Dao embodies the fire element, incredibly domineering."

"Besides that, there are also the Qian Sword Dao, Kun Sword Dao, Xun Sword Dao, Kan Sword Dao, Gen Sword Dao, Dui Sword Dao, and Zhen Sword Dao."

"The Eight Innate Swords intertwine and evolve, transforming into all phenomena of heaven and earth. All things in creation are contained within them. Even a single Sword Dao is extremely powerful; if all eight Swords are fused, it might not be invincible, but it wouldn't be far off," Li Changxiao explained.

"There are seven other Sword Daos? And eight-sword fusion, I wonder how powerful that is?" Yang Ji's eyes suddenly lit up.

[This junior brother didn't even show excitement when he heard my name, but after hearing about the eight types of Sword Dao, he's brimming with enthusiasm. He must be a very dedicated cultivator. No wonder he could comprehend a move or two from the imprint; there must be some reason for it. If it were anyone else, in front of me, they'd probably only be flattering and fawning. How could they still have the presence of mind to discuss divine abilities and spells?] Li Changxiao observed Yang Ji, secretly nodding.

Suddenly, his ear twitched, and he chuckled, "Little junior brother, I still can't achieve eight-sword fusion, but I'm extremely proficient at two-sword fusion. Watch closely!"

Just as Li Changxiao finished speaking, a Darkwater Beast radiating a powerful aura burst out from the stone forest.

The Darkwater Beast was covered in tough scales, with a tiger-like head, incredibly ferocious. It charged directly at him.

Seeing Li Changxiao remain perfectly still, his long sword unraised, Yang Ji immediately shouted a warning, "Be careful! This is a Demon Commander-level beast!"

Hearing this, Li Changxiao still didn't move an inch. Instead, a meaningful smile appeared at the corner of his lips.

Yang Ji saw [Rest assured] above his head, but when he saw the Darkwater Beast's claws about to reach his face, he couldn't help but feel a surge of anxiety for him.

Just as the Darkwater Beast's claws closed in to within three inches of Li Changxiao's head, *shhh shhh shhh shhh!* His sword didn't move, yet a flash of sword light swept across his vision.

In an instant, the Darkwater Beast was torn into four pieces, collapsing into a heap of minced flesh at Li Changxiao's feet.

"Such fast swordplay!" Mang Biao's pupils constricted violently, secretly clicking his tongue. "If I were that Darkwater Beast..." The thought made him shiver instantly. He couldn't imagine the horrific scene of himself being torn to shreds.

"A Demon Commander-level beast just died like that?" This scene greatly shocked Yang Ji. He hadn't even seen Li Changxiao draw his sword, yet the Darkwater Beast had already fallen.

If not for the wind carrying a faint biting sensation, if not for his Golden Finger reminding him [Sword qi chilling], Yang Ji would even suspect that Li Changxiao hadn't drawn his sword at all.

"Was my sword fast?" Li Changxiao turned his head to Yang Ji and said, "This sword of mine just now not only had the domineering power of the Li Sword Dao but also the speed of the Xun Sword Dao. The Xun Sword Dao is like wind; when gentle, it has the beauty of swaying flowers and brushing willows, but when it rages, it possesses immense destructive power. Paired with the fire element of the Li Sword Dao, it's like a strong wind fanning a wildfire—sweeping all before it, unstoppable."

"Little junior brother, when you arrive at the sect, Master will naturally impart the other Sword Daos to you."

"Changxiao, why are you here?" At some point, True Monarch Ling Gu had emerged from the stone forest and was walking towards them.

"Martial Uncle Ling!" Li Changxiao cupped his hands in a bow, "A disciple sent me a message saying that spiritual light was soaring to the heavens here, so I came to join the fun."

"I see." True Monarch Ling Gu nodded.

"Oh, by the way, Martial Uncle." Li Changxiao glanced at Yang Ji, then suddenly sent a sound transmission to Ling Gu. Immediately, a look of surprise appeared on Ling Gu's face. He looked Yang Ji up and down before speaking, "You mean he comprehended the Li Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Imprint?"

"Yes, Martial Uncle," Li Changxiao affirmed.

"Excellent, excellent. Besides you, he's the second person to comprehend the Li Sword Dao purely from a section of a Sword Dao Imprint. His comprehension must be astonishing. It seems you'll have another junior brother." True Monarch Ling Gu's sharp demeanor softened slightly, and he smiled kindly at Yang Ji, "What's your name?"

Facing a True Monarch directly, Yang Ji's breathing quickened by two beats. He immediately bowed, "Greetings, True Monarch. This junior is Yang Ji!"

"Yang Ji?" True Monarch Ling Gu nodded, speaking calmly, "Many demon beasts have arrived outside. You and Changxiao should stay by my side, don't wander off."

"Thank you, True Monarch!" Yang Ji bowed again.

True Monarch Ling Gu smiled and looked at him twice, then turned his gaze towards the stone forest.

"Damn, something's not right. Tang Long and the others are being held back by demon beasts." Mang Biao frowned, "I'll go in and help them."

"Wait!" Yang Ji suddenly reached out to stop him, because the information before his eyes had changed: [The number of demon beasts and humans within the formation has reached its limit; the formation automatically stops.]

Automatically stopped?

Why?

Yang Ji's eyes flickered slightly, somewhat puzzled.

However, now was not the time to delve into these matters.

With the stone array stopped, the thick stone pillars instantly became motionless.

After their initial surprise, the cultivators quickly charged out of the stone array. At the same time, the later arriving demon beasts also chased after them.

"The stone array stopped?" Mang Biao was startled, then instantly reacted, charging forward to meet Tang Long and the others.

"The stone array stopped!" True Monarch Ling Gu's gaze abruptly swept towards the three masses of black demonic qi. He exchanged a look with True Monarch Chi Huo and True Monarch Nan Kui, who were not far away. [Kill Demon King] even appeared above their heads.

Yang Ji was slightly astonished. They were actually going to kill Demon Kings?

"Demon Kings are hard to find and generally don't show themselves. I didn't expect three to appear this time. After all, they are demon beasts from the sea. Although they are Demon Kings, their strength cannot be fully exerted on land. I'll go kill them. Changxiao, look after your junior brother."

After True Monarch Ling Gu finished speaking, he, True Monarch Chi Huo, and True Monarch Nan Kui joined forces and charged out.
