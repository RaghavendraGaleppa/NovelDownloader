**Chapter 219: Exiting the Grotto-Heaven, Eastern Extremity Immortal Continent**

In the vast heavens, countless tens of thousands of feet above the ground, a bright streaking light suddenly appeared, then plummeted rapidly downwards like a shooting star. In an instant, it had already traversed thousands of feet. However, even with such incredible speed, Zhang Jing still felt extremely far from the ground.

"Although Master, as the True Monarch on duty for these several epochs, has his Daoist sanctum, the Crimson Bright Grand Luminous Grotto-Heaven, suspended high above the Azure Firmament Profound Bright Heaven, this... isn't it a bit too high?" Zhang Jing couldn't help but click his tongue in amazement. Previously, when entering and exiting the Grotto-Heaven, Senior Brother Feng Wuyu had always guided him, so he hadn't felt anything. But today, as he personally used his escape art, he finally realized just how absurdly high the Grotto-Heaven and the sky truly were. Estimated to be more than a million *li*!

His gaze involuntarily swept downwards. A boundless, vast expanse of land instantly leaped into view. Majestic mountain ranges, continuous forests and plains, vast raging rivers, clear mirror-like lakes, and even numerous nations, collectively outlined a magnificent panorama imbued with an aura of immortal vicissitude.

"This must be the Eastern Extremity Immortal Continent. Truly magnificent," Zhang Jing recalled the immense map of the Azure Firmament Profound Bright Heaven he had just seen, which marked the five continents, four seas, and two marshes, and instantly marveled in his heart.

Just then, "M-master, when can we go down? This is too... too scary." Lu Sanshiba, who was clinging tightly to Zhang Jing's leg, unconsciously glanced down after hearing Zhang Jing's exclamation, and his body instantly trembled like a sieve. He then saw Lu Sanshiba's face turn pale as he asked tremblingly.

"Why are you so afraid? You won't fall to your death." Zhang Jing was a little exasperated. He hadn't expected that Lu Sanshiba, even after his cultivation had reached the Golden Core Realm, would still be so afraid of heights. As his words fell, the speed of Zhang Jing's streaking light, plummeting downwards, increased significantly once more. Immense magical power fluctuations surged out unrestrainedly in all directions.

***

Time flowed gently by. In the blink of an eye, two full years had passed since Zhang Jing and Lu Sanshiba left the Grotto-Heaven to travel the Eastern Extremity Immortal Continent, searching for a spiritual land to establish a Daoist sanctum. In two years, the master and servant had wandered around, yet had only visited about a dozen places. Among them were nations formed by cultivators, but more were mortal kingdoms. And through the experiences of these two years, Zhang Jing had also discovered that although the Azure Firmament Profound Bright Heaven was dominated by the Boundless Grand Unity Dao Sect, and furthermore, the Daoist sanctums of numerous Dao Sect powerhouses were scattered throughout its corners, this did not mean that the Azure Firmament Profound Bright Heaven was a land of peace and tranquility. In fact, quite the opposite. Competition and conquest were the main themes of this boundless land. The Dao Sect and its many powerful cultivators did not excessively interfere. It was rather like the Grand Dao of non-action, where all beings freely contended under the frosty heavens.

***

On this day, on a certain desolate forest path, trees grew tall and dense, making the area quiet and secluded. The path, long untrodden by humans, was conspicuously overgrown with various unknown wild grasses, appearing extremely desolate and dilapidated.

Thump—thump-thump!

Accompanied by a subtle, crisp sound of footsteps, Lu Sanshiba, about thirty *zhang* tall, slowly appeared, his figure unhurried. On his back, Zhang Jing was half-sitting, half-reclining, holding a jade slip titled "Secrets of Grotto-Heaven Ascension" in his hand, his expression utterly leisurely.

Suddenly, "What a handsome divine deer! Young Master, may this humble one trouble you for a ride?" A voice, seductive to the bone, rang out. Hearing this, Lu Sanshiba suddenly halted, his eyes widening as he stared ahead, the cultivation aura that Zhang Jing had suppressed within him nearly surging forth. He truly hadn't expected this demonic creature to be so blind, seeking trouble with his master. Wasn't this like an old birthday star eating arsenic, tired of living?

On his back, Zhang Jing's gaze shifted from the jade slip in his hand, then followed the sound. In his sight, a woman with a curvaceous figure and a captivating, alluring face was leaning against an ancient tree, her eyes like autumn water as she gazed at him. Every frown and smile was soul-stirring.

"A demonic creature?" A hint of interest flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes. With a thought, above his head, a phantom six-colored auspicious cloud slowly rose, and his Penetrating Immortal Eyes instantly glowed with sharp divine light. The woman was instantly seen through completely. Not long after, "Young lady, could you first answer my next question?" Zhang Jing slightly lifted his eyelids, speaking in a gentle voice.

"If I answer, will Young Master give this humble one a ride? If so, Young Master, please speak, this humble one will certainly tell you everything she knows." Seeing Zhang Jing respond, the woman in the pink *ruqun* immediately showed delight. Zhang Jing did not answer directly, but merely asked, "Do you know of any places nearby where spiritual veins converge? Or perhaps, somewhere with a richer concentration of immortal spiritual energy?" As a demonic creature born and raised in these mountains and wilds, she would surely have some knowledge of the surrounding area, making her naturally the best possible source of information.

Hearing this, the woman in the pink *ruqun* immediately nodded like a chick pecking rice, saying excitedly: "Young Master, this humble one knows a place that perfectly fits your requirements, it's just... it's a bit remote."

"No matter, let's go take a look," Zhang Jing said in a calm tone.

"Then this humble one shall get on to guide Young Master." A sticky, sweet, and seductive voice suddenly reached his ears, followed by a faint, almost imperceptible fragrance. Zhang Jing looked down. He saw that the woman in the pink *ruqun*, at some unknown point, had already moved to his side, her fair hand like congealed fat grabbing Lu Sanshiba's white deer fur, about to climb up, looking as if she intended to burrow straight into his embrace. In her movements, large swathes of pale, soft, suggestive skin were exposed.

"Young lady, you should lead the way. My deer is too small to carry two people," Zhang Jing reminded her with a smile. His voice carried an undeniable undertone.

Two hours later, "It is indeed a spiritual land, but it's still lacking somewhat." Zhang Jing's dark pupils reflected a majestic divine mountain, three thousand *zhang* tall. Immortal aura gathered, and immortal mist permeated the air. If it were an ordinary person, just a single glance would make them exclaim: "What a blessed land for immortals!" However, upon seeing this scene, a faint hint of disappointment couldn't help but flash in Zhang Jing's eyes.

"Sanshiba, what do you think?" He asked again.

"Reporting to Master, this place is indeed lacking. There are no converging earth veins below, and the immortal aura above is not particularly strong. It wouldn't be of much benefit for cultivating immortal root spiritual plants," Lu Sanshiba answered truthfully.

"High-grade spiritual lands are hard to find, let alone top-grade ones. Senior Brother truly didn't deceive me. And he's right, the Dao Sect has existed for boundless epochs, and there are countless powerful cultivators. Even if the Azure Firmament Profound Bright Heaven is infinitely vast and expands every year, how could high-grade spiritual lands be found just by looking?"

"Never mind, let's keep searching. No rush." Zhang Jing smiled freely, his eyes showing no trace of disappointment from a fruitless endeavor.

"Yes, Master!"

Thump-thump—

Lu Sanshiba took a step, his body light as mist. In a flash, he carried Zhang Jing, traversed over the peaks of the mountains, and instantly vanished into the distance.

And in the original spot, dozens of vibrant three-tailed foxes lay motionless on the ground, and slender emerald green vines quietly grew out from their mouths and nostrils. Soon, delicate purple flowers bloomed on these vines, gently swaying in the breeze, full of life energy. Appearing tranquil and serene.

Time slowly flowed by.

"Ah!" A piercing scream suddenly shattered the tranquility. In an instant, a mysterious life aura began to surge violently. The vines that had grown from the mouths and nostrils of the fox corpses, blossoming with purple flowers, began to grow wildly, like startled fierce beasts.

Rustle!

The scalp-prickling sound of branches and vines rubbing together merged into a river of noise.

***

Another half a year flashed by. Inside a certain colossal city, on a street more than ten *zhang* wide, people bustled back and forth, presenting a lively scene. Zhang Jing, dressed in a light white robe, mingled leisurely among the crowd. As he walked forward, he curiously observed this magnificent immortal city, where mortals and cultivators lived intertwined, and whose population was rumored to be in the hundreds of millions.

"Sanyuan City, truly a good place," Zhang Jing thought to himself. Continuous voices reached his ears: some bargaining, some reminiscing, some mutually flattering...

At one moment, Zhang Jing slowly halted his steps, his peripheral vision suddenly drawn to two men leisurely drinking tea and chatting in a nearby teahouse.

"Alas, for the sake of the ownership of that Lingxu Immortal Mountain, the Yu River Sect, Sanyuan City, and the Dragon Ascent Sword Sect—these three major powers—have been endlessly warring with each other. Untold millions have died over several centuries, and even many immortals have fallen. Yet, even now, no clear outcome has been decided. When will these days ever end?"

"Exactly! My grand-uncle's youngest aunt's grand-uncle's distant cousin's eldest son died because of this, right there in front of that Lingxu Mountain. What a tragic sight it was!"

Zhang Jing withdrew his gaze, and a thoughtful expression immediately appeared in his eyes. Sanyuan City? Wasn't that the magnificent immortal city he was currently in? From the meaning of their words, the immortal Dao force controlling this immortal city seemed to be contending with two other immortal Dao forces for ownership of Lingxu Mountain?

"A spiritual land? And one that can cause three factions to entangle for hundreds of years, it must be quite good then." A hint of interest immediately arose in Zhang Jing's heart. If it were a high-grade spiritual land, that would be perfect. In that case, the location of his Daoist sanctum would finally have a place to consider.
