# Chapter 14: Pipa Fragments  

The weather was crisp and clear, the sun hanging high in the distant sky.  

During winter days without snow, such weather was quite pleasant, lifting people's spirits.  

Xiao Ji sat in his room, running his fingers over the iron pipa resting on the square table.  

When he had first obtained the single-stringed pipa, circumstances had prevented him from examining the artifact in depth, so he hadn't yet determined its true value. Now that he was safely within Yuanshen Temple, it was time to appraise the treasure.  

His initial plan had been simple—acquire a good magical artifact, sell it at a cultivator's market for a hefty sum of spirit stones, and use those stones to purchase decent cultivation techniques and artifacts.  

Though he had unexpectedly stumbled upon two treasures in Yuanshen Temple, it seemed these were the only remarkable items here.  

**[This is one of the Nine Heavenly Treasures forged jointly by the first human Sage, along with immortals, gods, Buddhas, demons, ghosts, and spirits, using his own life as the catalyst. It is the Four-Stringed Pipa.]**  

**[Unfortunately, after countless years of conflict, the Four-Stringed Pipa shattered. What you see now is but a single fragment—only the thinnest string remains a treasure, while the rest is mere mundane material.]**  

**[Currently, the remaining fragments of the Four-Stringed Pipa number nine in total: the body, the soundboard, the headstock, the bridge, the nut, the frets, the strings—divided into the wound string, the old string, and the middle string.]**  

"So, there are ten fragments in all, and I only have the thinnest string… If just this single string is already so powerful, enabling even the Five-Spiritual-Root Physician Xue to grasp cultivation, what would possessing the entire Four-Stringed Pipa do? It might elevate one to the level of a supreme expert."  

Xiao Ji was somewhat astonished. He channeled a bit more spiritual energy, probing deeper into the string to see if he could uncover any hidden techniques.  

**[The wound string of the Four-Stringed Pipa is currently on display at Ershi's shop in the Treasure Street of Taigu City. Having attracted no buyers, it has gathered layers of dust.]**  

Xiao Ji had never heard of Taigu City—it likely wasn't within the borders of the Great Li Dynasty.  

**[The old string is a treasured heirloom of the wealthy merchant Cui Dubu in Chuyun Town, Longxiang Prefecture. However, the Cui family's fortunes have been corroded by the string's backlash, and calamity looms on the horizon.]**  

**[The middle string lies in a ruined temple on a desolate mountain near Luolin Town in Longxiang Prefecture, guarded by a headless monk at the Foundation Establishment stage.]**  

All the strings seemed to be concentrated in Longxiang Prefecture, suggesting that the struggle over the Four-Stringed Pipa's strings must have once taken place there.  

Xiao Ji wanted to learn more, but no matter how hard he tried, he could only grasp vague hints rather than concrete answers.  

"Expecting to uncover the locations of all the fragments with just one string is wishful thinking. If I gather all four strings, perhaps the rest will reveal themselves."  

---  

Xiao Ji began organizing the information.  

One string was gathering dust in Taigu City, meaning no one recognized its value. If he could get there, the wound string would be his for the taking.  

The old and middle strings, however, were trickier. One was a family heirloom, while the other sounded downright dangerous—a headless Foundation Establishment monk guarding it. Was he a demonic monk or a vengeful spirit?  

Regardless, he now had a direction.  

Xiao Ji recalled the storyteller at the Yiwangxiang Teahouse. If the man's tales were true—that collecting all Nine Treasures could grant immortality and ward off heavenly tribulation—then there was no reason not to pursue them.  

The next time that storyteller, Master Wan, visited Willow Town, Xiao Ji could try to glean more from his tales.  

After some thought, he turned to more immediate matters.  

He didn't remove the string from the iron pipa, instead hiding the instrument. Stashing it in the wardrobe felt unsafe, and under the pillow was too obvious.  

In the end, he wrapped it in cloth and tucked it beneath his bed.  

"I need to reach the sixth level of Qi Refinement quickly and get a storage artifact," Xiao Ji mused, thinking of spatial treasures.  

Once the pipa was secured, he stepped out into the front courtyard.  

Liu Haizhu was regaling Zhao Jiuzhou with another tall tale—one bold enough to tell, and bold enough to believe.  

"That day, I was starving when a seventh-tier demon beast happened by. I grabbed it and roasted it on the spot—ah, the taste still lingers!" Liu Haizhu lounged on a recliner in the temple's front courtyard, basking in the weak sunlight as he swayed gently.  

"What technique did you use to defeat the seventh-tier beast?" Zhao Jiuzhou asked earnestly.  

"A simple chokehold," Liu Haizhu replied without hesitation.  

Zhao Jiuzhou let out a slow "Oh…" and finally seemed to realize that the old temple master might be spinning yarns.  

Xiao Ji understood Zhao Jiuzhou's journey—from initial belief to growing suspicion, and finally, enlightenment.  

Zhao Jiuzhou had followed Xiao Ji to Yuanshen Temple to confirm one thing: whether Xiao Ji was truly the temple's sole disciple.  

After a few days as a guest, the answer was clear.  

"Master, it's getting cold. Let's rest inside the main hall—I'll light a brazier for you." Xiao Ji helped his master up and guided him toward the temple.  

"Ah, fire reminds me of the Flame Demon Lord from eight thousand years ago. Now that's a thrilling tale!" Liu Haizhu turned back to Zhao Jiuzhou. "Young friend Liu, care to hear it?"  

*Too much, old man. If you'd just stick to stories from a few hundred years ago, they might sound believable. But eight thousand? Tens of thousands? No one's buying that.*  

"Elder Temple Master, my surname is Zhao," Zhao Jiuzhou corrected, further confirming the old man's state of mind.  

---  

After settling his master in the main hall with a book of chess strategies—finally silencing his storytelling urges—Xiao Ji led Zhao Jiuzhou back to the courtyard.  

"Don't mind my master, Brother Zhao," Xiao Ji said. "He's just… very fond of storytelling."  

After some small talk, Xiao Ji turned to more serious matters.  

As the sole survivor of the Xuantie Sect, Zhao Jiuzhou was still a proper sect cultivator. He undoubtedly knew more about cultivation than Xiao Ji, a mere Daoist from a mundane temple.  

First, he inquired about Taigu City.  

"Brother Zhao, have you heard of Taigu City?" Xiao Ji asked.  

"My master mentioned it, but I've never been—I wasn't qualified," Zhao Jiuzhou replied, clearly familiar with the name.  

"Tell me more," Xiao Ji pressed.  

"It's a city for cultivators—some call it the Dao City. Not just anyone can enter. My master said the minimum requirement is the sixth level of Qi Refinement, so everyone inside is a cultivator. Even the shopkeepers might be at the Foundation Establishment stage… though I don't know if that's true." Zhao Jiuzhou's expression was one of envy.  

"You're already at the fourth level of Qi Refinement with a single spiritual root. It won't be long before you qualify," Xiao Ji said. "But assuming I reach the sixth level, how would I get there?"  

"It's not that simple. Taigu City isn't within the Great Li Kingdom—it's on a hidden floating island. You'd need to take an airship to get there," Zhao Jiuzhou explained. "And passage isn't cheap—it costs a hefty sum of spirit stones. Might as well absorb them for cultivation instead."  

Xiao Ji had heard of airships before—from his master and other travelers. They were vessels that sailed the skies.  

But airships didn't dock just anywhere. In the Great Li Kingdom, they only landed at designated locations approved by the Zhenxie Division, hidden from ordinary eyes.  

Some powerful sects also operated their own airships and docking points.  

Boarding one required passing a cultivation test—no sneaking aboard.  

Xiao Ji resolved to reach the sixth level of Qi Refinement as soon as possible. Then he could visit Taigu City, claim the treasure before others realized its worth, and perhaps even purchase a storage artifact while he was there.  

After all, by then, he'd have use for one—no more hiding things under his bed.
