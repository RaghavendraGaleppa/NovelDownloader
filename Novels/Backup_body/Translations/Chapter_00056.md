# Chapter 56: Sect Rewards and Elder Gu's Invitation  

The Poison King Xin Xuan, who had poisoned the Crown Prince of Great Zhou's Eastern Palace, fled to Siyecheng in Xuanling Prefecture.  

During his escape, he evaded pursuit from various factions, slaughtered innocent civilians with his venomous insects, killed nearly a hundred members of opposing forces, and exterminated over a thousand elite Great Zhou soldiers.  

The incident sent shockwaves through the regions of Jingye Prefecture, Tianyuan Prefecture, Xuanling Prefecture, and surrounding areas, leaving everyone on edge.  

Now, the Poison King Xin Xuan had been executed—slain by the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect!  

This was the official account.  

However, those in higher circles received more detailed information.  

The Poison King Xin Xuan, wielding his Divine King Gu and an army of tens of thousands of insects gathered from seventeen tribes, had massacred Siyecheng to nurture his Gu. He summoned countless venomous creatures to battle against numerous powerful adversaries!  

The Young Sect Master of Kunlun, the Buddhist disciple of the Vajra Temple, the commander of Great Zhou's Imperial Guards, Lu Huaiyuan—the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Chief True Inheritor—along with elders from various peaks, inner disciples, and hundreds of Great Zhou soldiers, laid siege to the city!  

Despite this overwhelming force, Xin Xuan escaped unscathed, mocking the Central Plains as if no one could stop him!  

Yet afterward, Li Zhengjing, an inner disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Ancient Moon Peak, returned to Siyecheng with Xin Xuan's severed head!  

"With such a grand siege in Siyecheng, they still couldn't stop Xin Xuan, yet he fell to a mere inner disciple?"  

"I thought the Young Sect Master of Kunlun was the strongest below the Immortal Realm. Who knew someone could surpass him? Which branch of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is this disciple from?"  

"Li Zhengjing, an inner disciple of Ancient Moon Peak, only seventeen years old. He entered the sect with the token of the late Yuan Zhengfeng, cultivated inner energy in just half a year, advanced to inner disciple status, and now—only a month later—he has slain Xin Xuan!"  

"What? He only achieved inner energy a month ago and already killed someone like Xin Xuan?"  

"This man is a true prodigy. Rumor has it he faced suppression in the outer sect, delaying his breakthrough. Otherwise, he might have broken the sect's three-hundred-year record!"  

"It seems the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, after Lu Huaiyuan, has produced another with the 'potential to ascend to immortality.'"  

"Was his background investigated before joining the sect?"  

"According to records, he hails from a remote village. His father obtained Yuan Zhengfeng's token by chance and passed it to him. Now, he stands alone, with no family or backing."  

"Investigate further!"  

Similar discussions spread among various factions.  

Within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, every peak was abuzz.  

The mission, led by Chief True Inheritor Lu Huaiyuan, with elders and disciples from various peaks descending to Siyecheng, had failed to capture Xin Xuan.  

Only Li Zhengjing, an inner disciple of Ancient Moon Peak, had succeeded—slaying Xin Xuan at the Inner Energy Realm and earning two thousand merit points.  

When the news reached the main peak's grand hall, the Sect Master was overjoyed. He bestowed upon Li Zhengjing a "Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill" and a "Filigree Gold Token" as rewards!  

Following this, the Ancient Moon Peak's presiding elder granted him three Creation Five Mysteries Pills and a Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber!  

From this day forth, Li Zhengjing's name shook the entire sect and spread far and wide!  

---  

"I've handed Xin Xuan's head to the main peak," Lu Huaiyuan said, placing down a bundle. "This is the Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill and the Filigree Gold Token bestowed upon you by the Sect Master."  

He took the Filigree Gold Token and attached it to Li Zhengjing's inner disciple token.  

Silver tokens signified the Inner Energy Realm.  

Gold tokens signified the True Energy Realm.  

"Since you haven't reached the True Energy Realm yet, the Sect Master granted you this Filigree Gold Token to accompany your silver one—an exceptional honor."  

Lu Huaiyuan handed the gold-edged token back to Li Zhengjing. "With this, your status within the sect will be equal to a True Inheritor, on par with inner sect elders!"  

Li Zhengjing accepted the token and the pill, expressing his gratitude.  

"Don't thank me. The Sect Master granted these to you," Lu Huaiyuan said. "The Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill is invaluable—it can save your life in dire circumstances. Treasure it."  

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "I look forward to the day you truly ascend to True Inheritor status and stand as my equal, competing with me."  

"If I become the 'Chosen One' and succeed as the next Sect Master, I hope you'll be my strongest ally."  

"And if you surpass me, I will gladly acknowledge you as the 'Chosen One' and support your ascension."  

"Of course, these matters are still distant. The previous Sect Master perished less than twenty years ago, and the current one is only three hundred years old."  

"If neither of us reaches the Immortal Realm in our lifetimes, the Sect Master might outlive us both."  

Lu Huaiyuan chuckled. "Also, don't worry—I won't suppress you. You've saved me from greater humiliation. In truth, I owe you a favor."  

Li Zhengjing met his gaze and smiled. "Senior Brother Lu, your magnanimity is admirable."  

"My strength lies in my own abilities," Lu Huaiyuan replied calmly. "Your growth doesn't diminish me, nor does suppressing you make me stronger."  

"If I had to crush my peers to rise, such opportunities would be beneath me."  

He turned to leave, waving a hand. "I've reached this height through my own efforts, not by trampling others."  

Watching him depart, Li Zhengjing exhaled.  

Perhaps the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect wasn't as rotten as he'd thought.  

---  

"Finally, he's gone…" The Hanging-Wall Bird sighed, relieved to speak after holding back for so long.  

It eyed the Creation Five Mysteries Pills with curiosity. "So these are the pills made from that foolish tree's essence? They're said to aid inner energy cultivation."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree stared at the pills, recalling its bitter past, nearly shedding tears.  

Li Zhengjing picked up the pills, deep in thought.  

After the Sect Master's rewards were announced, the Ancient Moon Peak's presiding elder had bestowed these treasures.  

"Refining the Five Elements Creation Tree's essence into pills is indeed more effective than boiling it into paste. I've been wasteful before."  

Yet, he remained silent.  

At the Inner Energy Realm, these pills would greatly aid his cultivation.  

But with the Five Elements Creation Tree now lost to the sect, these pills were even more precious.  

"Does this reward hint that they know I possess the tree?"  

He frowned. "And would the Ancient Moon Peak's elder have rewarded me if the Sect Master hadn't acted first? After all, in his eyes, I'm already marked for death—why waste resources?"  

Leaving the Hanging-Wall Bird and the tree to sort through their gains—especially the dying Divine King Gu—he headed to the Merit Hall to claim his two thousand merit points and exchange for supplies.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree needed better soil and spiritual water to thrive.  

The Hanging-Wall Bird had contributed—it deserved a jug of spirit wine to enhance its vitality.  

Most importantly, the Divine King Gu required rare materials to replenish its energy and spawn eggs before death.  

The Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill could revive it, but Li Zhengjing wasn't willing to waste such a treasure. Instead, he exchanged merit points for a life-nurturing spiritual spring.  

The expenses were steep. After deducting the merits earned from killing Xin Xuan and other evil cultivators, plus the late Elder Yuan Zhengfeng's remaining merits, only seventeen hundred remained.  

As he finished, he spotted Elder Jing Xiao on duty.  

This elder had always advised him to be cautious, warning against overreaching. A kind mentor.  

Li Zhengjing waved cheerfully. "Elder Jing!"  

"..."  

The elder pretended not to see him, swiftly turning away and vanishing.  

*This brat's a monster! Every time I warn him not to court death, he returns victorious. My face stings from the slaps!*  

Li Zhengjing watched him flee, speechless.  

Just as he prepared to return home, an inner disciple approached respectfully.  

"Senior Brother Li…" The thirty-year-old disciple bowed. "Elder Gu requests your presence tonight."  

Li Zhengjing nodded calmly.  

But inwardly, his thoughts surged like stormy waves.  

*Elder Gu—the one poisoned by Xin Xuan in the capital.*  

*If my guess is right, the Thousand Illusions Godking was among that group.*  

*Is Elder Gu… the Thousand Illusions Godking?*
