# Chapter 17: Experimenting with Mid-Grade Pills  

Lin Xuan had gained a preliminary grasp of the blue light dots' application, but whether this was their full potential or merely the tip of the iceberg remained to be seen. Determined to explore further, he poured out a pill from a jade vial—not a defective one this time, but a high-quality Body Tempering Pill obtained from Zhou Yan.  

If defective pills could be purified, could a low-grade Body Tempering Pill be refined and upgraded further?  

Lin Xuan wanted to test this theory.  

In the cultivation world, every spiritual pill—including the Body Tempering Pill—was classified into four grades: low, mid, high, and supreme. The grading primarily depended on the impurities within the pill rather than the materials used. The more impurities present, the more diluted the beneficial essence, resulting in diminished effects upon consumption. Conversely, higher-grade pills contained fewer impurities and more concentrated essence, yielding significantly better results.  

Naturally, refining higher-grade pills was far more challenging.  

Generally, pills with over 70% impurities were deemed defective. Low-grade pills contained about 50% impurities, mid-grade 30%, high-grade 10%, and supreme-grade pills had negligible impurities—only 2-3%.  

For millennia, the cultivation world had sought ways to reduce impurities in pills. Countless masters and brilliant minds had toiled tirelessly, yet progress remained minimal. Today, most spiritual pills—Body Tempering Pills, Foundation Establishment Pills, Essence Nourishing Pills, Nine Revolutions Pills—were predominantly low-grade.  

Now, Lin Xuan aimed to push further. If the Star Sea could purify defective pills into low-grade ones, could it also refine low-grade pills into mid-grade?  

Theoretically, it should be possible. Sitting cross-legged, Lin Xuan held a snow-white pill in his hand and gathered the blue light dots in his dantian. After over a month of practice—especially after breaking through to the second layer of the Spirit Movement Stage—his control over the blue light dots had become fluid, no longer feeling clumsy during major circulation cycles.  

Still, he remained cautious. Today's experiment was new territory. He extended all his spiritual sense, guiding the light dots through his meridians and concentrating them onto the Body Tempering Pill in his hand.  

Reaching the second layer of the Spirit Movement Stage had enhanced all of Lin Xuan's attributes. Beyond increased spiritual power, his spiritual sense had grown substantially. Previously, he could only observe the pill's surface, but now he could penetrate its interior.  

In his mind, the pill appeared magnified, revealing intricate details. While it appeared uniformly white on the outside, Lin Xuan now saw thin black threads intertwined with the white essence—the impurities.  

His task was to expel these useless elements.  

The blue light dots passed through his skin and entered the pill. Before, Lin Xuan had been unable to observe this process directly; he could only control the speed of the light's flow. Now, with enhanced spiritual sense, he could study the purification mechanism in greater detail.  

As he regulated the light's movement, he carefully observed.  

Inside the pill, the light dots flowed freely. The white sections represented essence, while the black denoted impurities. When encountering essence, the blue light passed through unimpeded. But when meeting impurities, it pushed them outward, expending energy in the process.  

Lin Xuan watched as a black impurity shifted incrementally with each blue light dot's push, eventually being expelled from the pill. This reduced the impurity content slightly.  

So this was how purification worked. Lin Xuan nodded inwardly, gaining deeper insight into the blue light's nature.  

"If my spiritual sense can enter the pill, can I control the blue light dots inside?" A new idea struck him. Currently, the light dots moved randomly within the pill, making purification inefficient. If he could direct them, clustering them where needed, the process would become far more effective.  

Lin Xuan began experimenting.  

To control the light dots outside his body, he needed to attach his spiritual sense to them—a principle similar to object manipulation techniques. However, execution proved far more difficult.  

Unlike physical objects, the light dots lacked tangible form. Higher-level cultivators might manage this feat, but Lin Xuan was only at the second layer of the Spirit Movement Stage. Despite his enhanced spiritual sense, it still fell far short of what was required.  

After immense effort, he barely managed to make a single blue light dot tremble.  

Wisely, Lin Xuan chose to abandon the attempt. It was too demanding for now. He would revisit the idea once his cultivation advanced further.  

Redirecting his focus, he concentrated on regulating the Star Sea's flow within his body to continue purification.  

Yet this process wasn't without challenges. Unlike defective pills, low-grade pills had fewer impurities, but they were more tightly bound to the essence. Separating them required significantly more blue light energy.  

After an hour, the Star Sea in his dantian had dwindled to a third of its original size—approaching the critical threshold where no more blue light could be emitted.  

Once the light ceased flowing, the impurities that had nearly been expelled rebounded, reattaching themselves to the essence even more firmly.  

The pill, once pure white, now bore a faint black hue.  

Opening his eyes, Lin Xuan examined the ruined pill in his hand, his expression thoughtful. Though the experiment had failed, it yielded valuable insights.  

First, his spiritual sense could now penetrate the pill's interior, granting him a clearer understanding of the purification process—an invaluable advantage for mastering the blue light.  

Second, the blue light inside the pill could still be controlled, albeit not with his current strength. Once his spiritual sense grew powerful enough, directing the light's flow would drastically improve purification efficiency.  

Experience was accumulated through trial and error, but wisdom lay in reflection. Whether an experiment succeeded or failed, Lin Xuan meticulously analyzed the results.  

It was this mindset—bold yet meticulous—that had allowed him to progress from complete ignorance to gradually uncovering the blue light dots' secrets, deepening his mastery with each step.
