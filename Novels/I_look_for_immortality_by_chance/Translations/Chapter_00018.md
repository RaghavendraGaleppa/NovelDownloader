# Chapter 18: Spirit Serpent Heavenly Water and the Four Spirit Jade Pillars

After what felt like an eternity, Gu Yuan finally emerged from the vast ocean of information. The concept of immortality was too profound and mysterious. The Celestial Palace and dragons seemed impossibly distant.

"I'm just a nobody right now—no point overthinking things and wasting mental energy," Gu Yuan repeated to himself several times, consciously tempering his soaring ambitions until his mind settled back to calmness.

Youthful fantasies were inevitable. Seeing luxury cars, mansions, mystical techniques, and the promise of immortality naturally stirred dreams of attainment. But the current Gu Yuan was merely a fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator without even spiritual sense to his name. The path to immortality remained far beyond his reach.

Yet, unbeknownst to him, subtle changes had already taken root in his mindset—changes he could now perceive. His interest in the jade pillar and the spiritual water had intensified. This spiritual water might just bridge the gap between him and those so-called prodigies. Deep within, ambitions quietly grew, and Gu Yuan made no effort to suppress them.

As an otherworldly traveler with extraordinary treasures, he naturally harbored transcendent aspirations. Previously trapped in the demonic cavern with an uncertain future, he hadn't realized how vast and magnificent this world's cultivation path truly was—nor that immortality could even be pursued methodically. How could he not yearn to explore it?

However, his experiences in the demonic cavern had tempered his character. Even with thunderous ambitions raging inside, his expression remained as placid as a still lake, allowing him to think clearly.

"Time to go."

He tossed the stone manual back to its original place and boarded the book boat, heading toward another section of the library.

This section was more meticulously organized and concise. Gu Yuan quickly found what he sought: *The Compendium of Qi Refining Treasures*. The thick jade slip contained records of numerous mystical and rare treasures related to Qi Refinement. The content was vast, and it took Gu Yuan considerable time to commit it all to memory.

"Truly a supreme-grade spiritual water!" Setting down the jade slip, Gu Yuan exhaled in relief, excitement flickering in his eyes.

"Spirit Serpent Heavenly Water!"

"An elite-grade spiritual water for the Spiritual Sense breakthrough. After consumption, the awakened spiritual sense resembles a silver serpent, capable of extending six zhang (≈20 meters) and is as fierce as a flood dragon, capable of tearing apart spiritual sense of peers with unmatched dominance. Only the Flood Dragon Clan of the Four Seas produces it."

The jade slip's description matched exactly what Gu Yuan had seen. "It's real. The jade pillar truly is an extraordinary treasure!"

But curiosity gnawed at him: "What might the other two faces of the jade pillar produce?"

His search through the endless sea of scriptures continued for days. The sheer volume of texts and his limited foundational knowledge meant he took this opportunity to fill in gaps about the cultivation world's common knowledge—knowledge the Green Wood Sect could never have provided.

Cultivation, at its core, was the pursuit of knowledge. Gu Yuan absorbed it all like a sponge. Fortunately, as a cultivator, his enhanced physique and the prevalence of jade slips—which allowed rapid reading—enabled him to assimilate this vast trove of "common knowledge" in just a few days.

"Found it! The Four Spirit Jade Pillar!"

After relentless study and searching, Gu Yuan finally discovered relevant records in *The Compendium of Rare Treasures*.

"Jade from Mount Xi, known as Chi Jade, serves as the foundation. By extracting the essence blood of four spirits, inscribing Heavenly Water patterns, and gathering the world's spiritual energy, four types of spiritual water can be artificially produced."

"Chi Jade cannot be moved. Once spiritual water condensation begins, it must remain embedded in a spiritual vein to continuously gather energy. This process cannot be interrupted."

"Only after one type of spiritual water is successfully condensed and retrieved will the next begin forming. Insufficient spiritual energy leads to failure."

"This treasure is rare, with few capable of crafting it. The Celestial Mechanism Pavilion of the Southern Mountain Domain was renowned for forging such artifacts. However, centuries ago, they were embroiled in the Central Mountain Kingdom's war, leading to their destruction. The whereabouts of this treasure were lost."

"The Four Spirit Jade Pillar forged by the Celestial Mechanism Pavilion was crafted using the essence blood of the Azure Crane, Silver Flood Dragon, Three-Eyed Ape, and Kui Beast."

"The Azure Crane and Silver Flood Dragon spiritual waters break through the Spiritual Sense barrier. The Three-Eyed Ape and Kui Beast spiritual waters aid in Foundation Establishment breakthroughs, transforming spiritual sense into divine sense."

"Aside from the Azure Crane spiritual water, the other three are exceptional. Obtaining them ensures one's spiritual and divine sense prowess rivals that of elite disciples!"

The detailed description in *The Compendium of Rare Treasures* stirred Gu Yuan's excitement. "No wonder this is a near-pure silver opportunity! Truly extraordinary!"

Yet, his joy was tinged with concern. "No wonder the spiritual water's condensation slowed before I left—the spiritual energy must be insufficient!"

Previously unaware of the jade pillar's mechanics, Gu Yuan had taken the Azure Crane spiritual water, activating the Silver Flood Dragon essence blood. Now, it seemed the White Egret Island's spiritual veins couldn't keep up.

"I can't let this rare opportunity fail due to a lack of spiritual energy!"

The Spirit Serpent Heavenly Water was Gu Yuan's first step toward catching up with elite disciples—it couldn't be jeopardized. "Looks like I'll have to spend some wealth and set up a spirit stone formation."

Touching his storage pouch, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile wryly. His days of study hadn't been in vain; the texts mentioned using spirit stones to compensate for spiritual vein deficiencies. However, the cost was exorbitant—a luxury most disciples couldn't afford.

Still, Gu Yuan had some confidence. He still possessed the Azure Crane spiritual water, though his finances would undoubtedly take a hit.

Instead of rushing back to his cave abode to set up the formation, Gu Yuan continued browsing the scripture repository. This time, he focused on miscellaneous records of the Dao Academy's aristocratic families and the strictest of Qingfeng Dao Academy's laws.

After thoroughly acquainting himself with the academy's background, he borrowed a copy of *Dao Academy Laws* and returned to his abode. After confirming the jade pillar's condition and investigating the academy's market, he changed into fresh attire and flew toward an island.

Cultivation wasn't something one could achieve in isolation—especially in this world, where resources for cultivation seals were abundant and required frequent exchanges.

With thousands of disciples in Hidden Flood Dragon Courtyard alone—including outer court disciples and servants—the population swelled to tens of thousands. Adding the Seven Peaks, Thirty-Six Islands, and aristocratic families made the numbers even more staggering.

With such numbers, markets naturally thrived. For safety, disciples had spontaneously established a marketplace on a secluded island called Silver Moon Bay for daily exchanges—precisely where Gu Yuan was headed.

Today happened to be Silver Moon Bay's monthly market gathering, where many disciples emerged from seclusion to trade insights and resources.

The market was simple in setup: rows of stone tables arranged in grids. Those with goods to sell simply placed them on the tables. If tables were full, a piece of cloth on the ground sufficed as a stall.

Since the island was within the sect's territory, security wasn't a concern, and formalities were dispensed with.

Gu Yuan's goal was straightforward: to acquire a second-grade Spirit Gathering Formation Plate. With this artifact and a hundred spirit stones, he could temporarily elevate White Egret Island's cave abode to a second-grade upper-tier spiritual vein, ensuring the successful condensation of Spirit Serpent Heavenly Water.

The market bustled with activity today, resembling a mortal-world bazaar with over a hundred stalls and lively chatter. However, most were disciples below the fifth level of Qi Refinement, with only about thirty percent at or above that stage.

Gu Yuan navigated through the crowd, scanning the stalls. Perhaps due to the average cultivator's level, the goods on display weren't particularly rare—mostly Qi Gathering Pills or materials for lower-grade cultivation seals. Magical artifacts and formation plates were scarce.

After searching for a while, Gu Yuan only spotted a first-grade Spirit Gathering Formation Plate. Given that Qingfeng Dao Academy's spiritual veins were at least first-grade upper-tier, who would need such a low-grade formation plate? Shaking his head, he pressed deeper into the market.

"Hmm?"

Suddenly, a jade slip on one stall caught his attention.
