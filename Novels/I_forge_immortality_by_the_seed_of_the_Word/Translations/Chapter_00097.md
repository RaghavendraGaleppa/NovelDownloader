**Chapter 95: The Frostwind Banner**  

After leaving the Ten Thousand Treasures Vault, Zhang Jing found himself standing on a vast, snow-white plain.  

Boom—  

The roar of a great river suddenly erupted beneath his feet, drowning out the sound of wind and ice crystals pelting his body. The scenery around him shrank rapidly as the ground fell away, leaving only a monotonous expanse of white that made it nearly impossible to discern direction.  

The ceaseless blizzard had long since erased all traces of previous battles. Yet, guided by the towering ice peaks in the distance, Zhang Jing eventually found his bearings.  

A faint smile tugged at the corners of his lips.  

With the support of the perfected *Netherwyrm Devours the Void* Dao Rhyme, his strength had undergone a qualitative transformation compared to before entering the Ten Thousand Treasures Vault.  

Which meant... a certain white ape was about to have a very bad day.  

At Zhang Jing’s command, the Five Treasures Spirit River erupted with a terrifying aura, surging forward like an unstoppable tide.  

Roar!  

A furious bellow shook the entire valley. The accumulated snow and ice pillars on either side collapsed with a thunderous crash, cascading downward in a spectacular avalanche that stretched for miles.  

Yet even this deafening spectacle could not mask the earth-shaking battle unfolding within the valley.  

Boom! Boom! Boom!  

The towering white ape, standing over a dozen zhang tall, pounded its massive, grayish-brown fists against its chest like war drums. Its hulking frame cast an immense shadow over the ground.  

When enemies meet, their eyes blaze with fury.  

The ape’s blood-red eyes, each the size of a carriage wheel, locked onto Zhang Jing, who stood calmly atop the Five Treasures Spirit River. A murderous intent as violent as an erupting volcano radiated from the beast.  

Thud! Thud!  

Unable to suppress its boiling bloodlust, the ape charged forward on its thick, fur-covered legs, each stride covering seven or eight zhang. The sheer force of its movement carved deep craters into the frozen ground beneath the snow, sending spiderweb-like cracks spreading in all directions.  

In the blink of an eye, the ape closed the distance.  

Seeing that its tiny opponent showed no intention of dodging, a glint of excitement flashed in the beast’s eyes. It bared its jagged fangs and unleashed another deafening roar!  

Instantly, a howling gale materialized behind the ape, sweeping toward Zhang Jing with a shrill, ghostly wail. The unnatural wind gathered the blizzard’s fury, obscuring vision and carrying a bone-chilling cold that deepened the frostbite-inducing assault.  

Even Zhang Jing’s formidable draconic physique began to stiffen under the onslaught.  

Within the storm, the ape’s massive hand shot out, aiming to snatch Zhang Jing from midair.  

Yet, seeing the same old tactics from their last encounter, Zhang Jing merely smirked.  

Clang! Clang!  

A metallic symphony rang out as the perfected *Netherwyrm Devours the Void* Dao Rhyme surged into the Five Treasures Spirit River.  

In an instant, the river expanded violently. Dozens of magical artifacts within erupted with power, crashing toward the ape’s outstretched hands like the lashing tail of a furious netherwyrm—its aura dozens of times more ferocious than the beast’s.  

Boom!  

A thunderous collision shook the land.  

The raging blizzard froze for a split second.  

Then—  

Roar!  

The white ape let out a pained howl as it staggered backward, retreating into the cover of the storm.  

“Trying to run?” Zhang Jing’s eyes narrowed.  

The Five Treasures Spirit River beneath him churned wildly, its radiance intensifying.  

Hundreds of spells, activated by glowing Dao Seeds, merged into the surging waves. Magical artifacts interlinked, rising and falling with the current as they exuded chaotic, destructive energy.  

Splash!  

With a single sweep, the river shattered the blizzard surrounding the ape. Unstoppable, it crashed into the beast, whose massive size—once an advantage—now made escape impossible.  

A mist of eerie crimson spread across the snow.  

The Dao Mark in Zhang Jing’s palm flickered faintly.  

*Spiritual Essence +500!*  

Exhaling slowly, Zhang Jing landed beside the ape’s mangled corpse, his gaze filled with anticipation.  

The Five Treasures Spirit River gradually dissipated.  

Moments later, the ape’s colossal body shattered into motes of light, leaving behind only a small, pure-white banner.  

“So this is the reward for killing the ape?”  

Zhang Jing’s eyes gleamed with curiosity.  

The moment he picked up the banner, information flooded his mind.  

*Frostwind Banner: Low-grade Spiritual Embryo Treasure.*  

“A Spiritual Embryo Treasure?”  

His expression brightened. The ape’s ability to summon wind and frost must have originated from this treasure. Having witnessed its power firsthand, Zhang Jing could only admit—it was formidable.  

Had his Dao Rhyme not reached perfection, he would have been utterly outmatched.  

Within moments, Zhang Jing’s spiritual sense imprinted onto the unclaimed Frostwind Banner, binding it to him.  

He felt a flicker of relief.  

Thankfully, his current cultivation—at the peak of Qi Refinement’s tenth layer—had granted his spiritual sense a quasi-divine quality, allowing him to refine the treasure. Otherwise, he’d have been left staring at it helplessly.  

With a thought, the Five Treasures Spirit River reappeared beside him.  

Zhang Jing attempted to merge the Frostwind Banner into the river, but the deeper he pushed, the greater the resistance became. The artifacts within trembled violently.  

“Troublesome...” He frowned.  

Perhaps the river’s capacity was the issue. After all, this was a Spiritual Embryo Treasure.  

After repeated attempts, Zhang Jing removed nearly a fifth of the artifacts from the river before finally succeeding in embedding the Frostwind Banner.  

“It seems the Five Treasures Spirit River can only hold five treasures at most. Maybe the limit will increase after breaking through to Foundation Establishment?”  

He speculated silently.  

By then, however, the *Five Depths Water Scripture* technique might have evolved into a Dao Seed, rendering the river’s existence uncertain.  

Yet Zhang Jing wasn’t worried.  

The nature of a technique and the Dao Seed it formed were intrinsically linked.  

Meaning, the *Five Depths Water Scripture* would likely still manifest as a river.  

Before long, Zhang Jing transformed into a streak of light, soaring into the sky.  

It was time to leave the Third Celestial Layer.  

---  

**Fourth Celestial Layer**  

Beneath the Ascension Stairway, light flashed repeatedly as five figures materialized.  

“How was your Dao comprehension? Any breakthroughs in Dao Rhyme?” A portly man asked eagerly the moment he emerged from the Ten Thousand Treasures Vault.  

The others shook their heads.  

“Sigh, there wasn’t enough time,” the lone woman among them said bitterly.  

“Indeed. Such a short duration makes meaningful progress nearly impossible.”  

“Enough pessimism,” a refined man in the center interjected with a chuckle. “If at first you don’t succeed, try again. Focus on hunting spirit beasts to accumulate Spiritual Essence. Otherwise, if Junior Zhang Jing catches up and joins us here in the Fourth Celestial Layer, we Inner Court disciples will become a laughingstock.”  

“Brother Lu, must you frighten us like this?” the portly man groaned. “Unless Zhang Jing has grasped a trace of Dao Intent, there’s no way he’s reaching the Fourth Celestial Layer.”
