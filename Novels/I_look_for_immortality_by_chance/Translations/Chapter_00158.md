# Chapter 158: The Thunder Spirit Seal That Bans All Arts and Vanquishes Evil!

"Whoosh!"

The lunar essence flowed like water, continuously pouring onto the magic core, which shimmered brilliantly as it rotated endlessly. Streams of pure magical power condensed and flowed into the stone statue's dantian. However, as time passed, wisps of hidden demonic energy gradually seeped out from the core, beginning to erode the statue's body.

"Clang!"

But at that moment, as if illuminated by dazzling moonlight, a resonant sound rang out. Within the statue's dantian, a seal resembling a crescent moon quietly rose. Strands of silvery moonlight descended, carrying an ethereal energy that purified all things, continuously washing away the surging demonic energy.

Not only that, another seal in the statue's dantian—gray and seemingly cobbled together from stones—also faintly glowed, beginning to absorb the dissipating demonic energy.

The newly escaped demonic energy was effortlessly resolved in an instant under the combined efforts of the two seals.

The stone statue's body remained unharmed, sitting cross-legged as it absorbed the lunar essence, its handsome and extraordinary form untainted by even a speck of dust.

"Whoosh!"

The magic core continued to absorb the lunar essence, its power slowly growing.

The small amounts of escaping demonic energy posed no threat and were easily dealt with.

Seeing this, Gu Yuan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

"As expected, as long as the demonic energy's hidden dangers are resolved, the Six Ren Magic Core Golden Scripture can indeed be cultivated..."

The derivation continued, and as Gu Yuan watched the increasingly pure magical power within the stone statue, a faint smile appeared on his lips.

"Hiss!"

But just then, as the stone statue was on the verge of breaking through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, its magical power grew even more potent, and the demonic energy within the core became increasingly dense. Strands of black gas, like venomous snakes, hissed and slithered wildly through the statue's body.

"Clang!"

"Hiss!"

The Moonlight Heart Seal and the Evil-Absorbing Seal both radiated spiritual light, vibrating violently within the statue's body—one desperately suppressing and purifying the demonic energy, the other frantically absorbing it.

Yet, at the critical moment of breakthrough, the demonic energy was terrifyingly dense. The black gas spread as if it would surge out from the statue's orifices, and its body was inevitably eroded slightly. Fine bone spikes emerged on its skin, its hair turned silver-white, and its nails grew sharp.

Although the mutation was far milder than before, it was still a mutation.

"Bang!"

The spiritual light within the statue was completely exhausted, and with a loud crash, it shattered entirely.

Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh deeply.

He had expended considerable effort for these two techniques, yet the final result was far from satisfactory.

---

The hidden danger of mutation still hadn't been completely resolved.

"Still, my idea wasn't wrong. It's just that the power of these two seals is still somewhat lacking, unable to suppress the demonic energy during the breakthrough..."

However, it wasn't a complete loss. Now, only the final step remained—if he could eliminate the last traces of demonic energy, the hidden dangers of the magic core could be completely eradicated.

In fact, if Gu Yuan were impatient, he could refine the magic core now and cultivate while searching for new methods to expel the demonic energy. After all, these two seals were more than capable of suppressing the energy during the early stages of cultivation.

"Another month has passed, and the stone liquid has accumulated once more. I'll check it first before deciding..."

Gu Yuan wasn't in a hurry to make a decision. Instead, he flipped his hand and took out the stone bottle again.

It was time for the monthly ritual. Though he had been disappointed several times before, Gu Yuan was already accustomed to it.

Opportunities were rare—that was only natural.

What he needed to do was check every month and seize every chance.

"Boom!"

As the stone liquid entered his eyes, the world before Gu Yuan transformed once more. The heavens and earth spun, stars flowed, and the entire world turned a murky gray.

Countless white dots flickered endlessly in Gu Yuan's vision, but he paid them no mind.

His consciousness surged forth, searching the gray world for anything that could influence his fate.

"Hmm?"

At that moment, a peculiar dot appeared in his sight.

White, cyan, silver—several differently colored threads of opportunity intertwined, forming a multicolored dot that seemed to shift slightly before finally settling over a certain building.

"...Method"

"...Spirit"

"...Body"

"...Artifact"

Gu Yuan's consciousness touched it, and several pieces of information flowed into his mind, leaving him slightly stunned.

"Method, spirit, body, and artifact—what kind of opportunity is this? Could it be some hidden treasure land?"

"Right now, what I need most is a method to expel demonic energy. Could this opportunity contain that?"

Gu Yuan pondered, but his movements were swift. After quickly gathering his belongings in the cave, he summoned his escape light and sped toward the location indicated by the opportunity.

---

Baiyan City was grand and imposing, its shops exquisitely decorated—after all, appearances were crucial for business.

Yet, in a corner of the city, there stood an inconspicuous, dilapidated little shop.

By noon, the city's towering shadows engulfed the shop, making it seem as though it had merged into the darkness. Combined with the concealment array, cultivators below the Foundation Establishment stage wouldn't even notice its existence as they passed by.

At this moment, Gu Yuan arrived on his escape light, a trace of surprise flashing across his face.

"Xuanjin Hall—it's actually here..."

Having spent some time in Baiyan City, Gu Yuan was familiar with its various establishments. Places like the Thousand Methods Hall conducted business openly, welcoming all customers.

The Exquisite Pavilion, on the other hand, operated more like an intermediary, employing both fair and underhanded methods to solve problems—for the right price.

As for Xuanjin Hall, it was a place for "bounties and revenge."

The Endless Sea of Islands was rife with conflict and strife, inevitably leading to countless grudges. Those who lacked the strength to seek vengeance themselves would often hire others to do it for them. Over time, Xuanjin Hall's business flourished.

This unassuming little shop often saw powerful Foundation Establishment cultivators coming and going, their bodies reeking of blood.

Gu Yuan had visited once before when he was short on money, but at the time, none of the bounties suited him—either the targets were too far away or the missions too time-consuming—so he hadn't taken any.

Yet now, he found himself stepping inside once more.

"Pop!"

With a flick of his magical power, Gu Yuan dispelled the concealment array, stepping through the shadows into a spacious hall.

The hall was sparsely populated, but those present exuded confidence, drinking leisurely as if they had all the time in the world.

The Endless Sea of Islands was home to many rogue cultivators. While most were mediocre, some possessed extraordinary opportunities and formidable skills.

Gu Yuan's gaze swept past them briefly before settling on the jade screen at the front of the hall, which displayed a long list of bounties.

"On Ximing Island, there is a demon known as the Golden Bone Frog. Bounty: one mid-grade spiritual artifact for its slaying."

"The enchantress of Suyin Island drained my primordial yang and magical power. I deeply resent her and offer a second-grade upper-tier spirit island and a mid-grade magical artifact for her death."

"Recently, on Siming Island, bandits have been posing as regular cultivators to rob others, committing all manner of atrocities. Bounty: 3,000 spirit stones to uncover their identities."

"Oh?"

Gu Yuan paused at the third bounty.

Had killing those four groups of bandits already drawn attention? There was even a bounty now?

He chuckled wryly before his eyes finally landed on the information he sought.

"Reward: 'The Thunder Spirit Seal That Bans All Arts and Vanquishes Evil.' Seeking a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator with exceptional combat skills to assist in a secret location to find my father's whereabouts."
