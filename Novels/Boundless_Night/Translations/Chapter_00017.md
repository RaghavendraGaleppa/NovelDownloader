Chapter 17: Harvest

"Only a single rebirth..." Fu Entao was deeply struck. He had undergone a second rebirth many years ago, his foundation sufficiently deep, yet he had been defeated by a newly reborn youth. One hand gripping his long saber, he forcefully pulled out the iron spear impaling his thigh. A gush of blood followed, causing the already exhausted man to sway.

Shao Chengfeng, having lost an arm and pinned to the ground by an iron spear through his abdomen, struggled to pull out the spear. But seeing Qin Ming turn to look at him, he weakly let his sole arm drop.

"The entire mountain patrol unit... wiped out by a single person." Shao Chengfeng knew he couldn't escape death; there was no way the opponent would leave any survivors.

"He's only undergone a single rebirth, why is he so strong?" Feng Yian wiped blood foam from his mouth and murmured.

Qin Ming spoke, "Tell me something that interests me."

"In your dreams!" Fu Entao retorted defiantly. He knew there would be no good end for him, and bowing down wouldn't change anything.

On the other side, Feng Yian and Shao Chengfeng showed no intention of speaking again. In normal times, their natures were like jackals, ruthless individuals. Yet, if humble pleading could save their lives now, they wouldn't mind prostrating themselves. But it was unrealistic; both knew they couldn't escape death.

"Tell me about the Blood Bamboo Forest." Qin Ming approached Shao Chengfeng.

Shao Chengfeng said nothing, his eyes hollowly gazing at the night sky. He was already beginning to review his past, for he knew very well that this life was about to end.

"Not going to talk, huh?" Qin Ming didn't waste words. His wood-chopping knife fell, and with a *thud*, the man was decapitated. Shao Chengfeng's eyes were wide open, dying with a grievance. The opponent was decisive, beheading him without a second thought.

Qin Ming had come to deal with these mountain patrol members; he had no interest in tormenting them. Since they were tight-lipped and he couldn't get anything out of them, he simply cut them down. He wanted to see if the other two would give in and loosen their tongues in this life-or-death situation.

Fu Entao's face twitched slightly, but his eyes grew fiercer. Gripping his long saber, he slowly shifted his feet, actually preparing to attack again. A second reborn individual who had run rampant in this area for years, unafraid of death's threat. After all, he was a ruthless person who had fought his way out of the deep mountains. On the other side, Feng Yian lay sprawled on the ground, an iron spear piercing his back and pinning him. He couldn't get up, only trembling slightly.

Wind and snow raged. Fu Entao charged forward like a humanoid beast, exerting all his might, swinging out the fiercest saber light for a final struggle. After a fierce clash, he gasped heavily, utterly exhausted. He was truly at his limit after fighting until now, yet the youth remained as vibrant as a dragon and tiger, brimming with vitality.

Whump!

After another exchange of blows, Fu Entao's right arm was severed by a single strike. His long saber fell to the ground with it. His face was deathly pale as he stumbled backward. Coupled with the leg that had been pierced by a spear earlier, he lost balance from his severe injuries, dropping to one knee in the snow, heavily gasping for breath. His naturally curly long hair clung wetly to his head, and his face was etched with unwillingness and despair.

"Do you have anything to say?" Qin Ming asked.

"Grant me a quick death with my own saber." Fu Entao was covered in cold sweat, his left hand trembling as he clutched the wound where his arm had been severed. But blood had already stained half his body, and the snow beneath him was a deep crimson.

"What makes you think I'd grant such a wish?" Qin Ming said, stepping forward with his wood-chopping knife.

"You... want to humiliate me?" Fu Entao struggled, trying to get up.

"Are you worthy?" Qin Ming dashed past. His wood-chopping knife sliced across Fu Entao's neck. A head, its expression still full of unwillingness, flew into the air as the body toppled to the ground.

Feng Yian lay there, his face ashen, struggling to get up. But the iron spear embedded in him only trembled slightly, impossible to pull from the frozen earth. He felt deeply humiliated, for the opponent was already standing before him, one foot resting on his head.

"Do you wish to tell me something?" Qin Ming looked down at him.

Feng Yian clenched his fists, then weakly relaxed them. He breathed heavily, saying, "You want to find spiritual creatures? I won't tell you."

Qin Ming applied a little pressure with his foot. A faint *crack* sound came from Feng Yian's skull, indicating a partial fracture. The intense pain twisted Feng Yian's face. Qin Ming didn't hesitate. His knife fell, beheading him as well and ending the bearded man's life.

As for the Blood Bamboo Forest's location, he could simply ask Old Man Liu when he returned. In his youth, Liu had great aspirations and often ventured into the mountains with the older generation of the mountain patrol, making him very knowledgeable about the distribution of fire springs in the great mountains.

Only the sound of wind remained on the mountain, no longer the grating clashes of blades and spears. This entire mountain patrol unit was annihilated, resolved by Qin Ming alone.

He murmured, "I actually killed so many people, and I didn't hold back." Qin Ming stood silently, reflecting. Perhaps it was because he hadn't seen these people as his own kind, but rather as mountain monsters endangering the villagers.

He began clearing the battlefield. The bodies only needed to be thrown down the mountain for a "stomach burial"—the dense forest was frequented by various fierce beasts, ensuring not even bones would remain.

Frugality had become Qin Ming's habit. He searched Fu Entao, Feng Yian, and the others. Illuminated by the fire spring, some brilliant objects appeared in his hand—Night Silver. These were coins with far greater purchasing power than copper pieces, often seen in town during merchant transactions. The coins were circular with a central hole, representing the sun's absence, hence called Night Silver.

Afterward, Qin Ming discovered an even more valuable item—Day Gold. It was entirely golden and brilliant, the circular coin whole and complete, shaped like the vanished sun, embodying people's beautiful aspirations.

The mountain patrol members didn't carry much Day Gold when entering the mountains, only eleven pieces in total. But for ordinary people, this was already a significant sum. This wasn't the first time Qin Ming had "found" Day Gold. Before he contracted his strange illness, he had seen several corpses near the fallen fissure, where he not only found Day Gold but also obtained a bottle of very precious mineral essence. Day Gold circulated less frequently in Silver Vine Town, so he had never used it, as it would be too conspicuous.

As for the exquisitely crafted, delicately carved small crystal bottle, he also hadn't touched it yet, because after recovering from his illness, he had undergone rebirth on his own. Moreover, he knew little about mineral essence and needed to understand it thoroughly to avoid carelessly using it and wasting its true value. Most crucially, the current events would soon erupt, so it was best for him to keep a low profile with his status as a first reborn.

"I've only undergone a single rebirth; I don't have the strength to deal with the mountain patrol. Once this 'turmoil' ferments, if I undergo a second rebirth, then there'll be no problem."

Qin Ming continued to search for spoils of war on the mountain.

"Excellent armor, hundred-refined long sabers, all good stuff!" he secretly sighed with regret, rubbing the armor and weapons. He planned to bury them scattered throughout the forest later, digging them out when needed for exploring the Blood Bamboo Forest. He was just that unpretentious, flipping through everyone from head to toe, not even sparing the golden mastiff. He picked it up, very much wanting to slice off a large chunk of dog meat with his knife to make a dog meat hotpot in the wooden hut. He had come out in the middle of the night, waiting in the forest until the night mist dispersed, and then engaged in a fierce battle with the mountain patrol members until now. He was extremely drained, and his stomach had long been rumbling with hunger.

But he sighed and gave up, dropping the mastiff onto the snow. For caution's sake, he really couldn't stay here long; he had to quickly clear the battlefield.

Qin Ming entered a wooden hut, finding it decorated to be very livable and comfortable. The floor was covered with thick beast hide rugs, and on the dining table were silver bowls and chopsticks, and small, exquisitely beautiful knives for cutting roasted meat. From a row of wine jars, opening any one would release a rich aroma of wine. It was clear at a glance that this was far superior to the spicy old wine in Xu Yueping's house, which had long since been drunk to the bottom.

He didn't find much after searching here, but he did discover a saber manual in the wooden hut that had collapsed due to the intense battle. Its old leather pages were worn and curled at the edges. It was evident that people frequently perused and studied it. There were even dense notes and annotations, not from the same hand, bearing traces of ancient intent. As he flipped through, Qin Ming saw familiar saber forms. Fu Entao's saber technique was only a part of what was recorded in the manual. Later sections also mentioned "Heavenly Light" and deeper descriptions. He didn't turn further back, quickly closed it, and took it with him. This old leather bound book was even more valuable than the Day Gold.

After Qin Ming thoroughly searched the area, fragmented golden ripples appeared on his body. As his fists and feet struck out, the remaining wooden huts successively exploded into pieces. The wind was strong now, instantly whipping up splinters of wood, carrying them into the air and sweeping them down the mountain with the gale. The snow on the ground was also frequently swept up, mixing with the goose-feather snow falling from the sky. It would be difficult to leave any traces at the scene.

"What a shame for my wood-chopping knife," Qin Ming observed the blade. It had many nicks and chips, densely packed. Although forged from fine iron, it ultimately couldn't compare to the mountain patrol's weapons.

"It's still usable, though." He found a sharpening stone there, quickly ground down the chipped parts, and then re-edged it. The blade was now slightly narrower than before.

Qin Ming carried all the bodies down the mountain and threw them into the dense forest. He personally witnessed several fierce beasts appear and quickly drag the corpses away. As for the four people he had ambushed earlier on the road, when he went to look for them again, he found that not even bone fragments remained.

Qin Ming moved aside the heavy stones and retrieved his pack from the snow cave. He took off his torn, blood-stained outer garment and armor, changing into his clean everyday clothes. What needed to be burned was burned, what needed to be buried was buried. This included the Day Gold and the saber manual, which he left in the mountain. Soon, he disappeared into the dense forest.

Qin Ming returned discreetly, dragging a piece of game. No one knew that this mild-mannered youth, who appeared no different from usual, had just emerged from a bloody battle. He boiled a pot of water, a rare departure from using cold water, and enjoyed a comfortable hot bath. His well-proportioned and tall body gleamed with a crystalline luster, and his muscles flowed smoothly. He rinsed himself meticulously, ensuring no peculiar scent remained from the bloody battle.

Not long after, he appeared at Lu Ze's home.

"Uncle, what kind of meat is this?" Wen Rui leaned closer.

Qin Ming held up a large piece of fresh meat and smiled, "This is delicious! 'Dragon meat in the heavens, donkey meat on earth,' your uncle hunted a wild donkey today." Primarily, he had been craving dog meat hotpot and was quite disappointed he couldn't eat the golden mastiff, so he prepared to compensate himself with donkey meat hotpot.

Soon, joyful laughter filled the air.

"Uncle, the donkey meat is really delicious!"

Before the steaming copper pot, Lu Ze, still injured, spoke, "Little Qin, you've already laid down a prime gold foundation. It's time to carefully consider your second rebirth."

Qin Ming nodded, "Don't worry, Brother Lu, I know what I'm doing."

After the meal, he returned home, pondering how to subtly inquire with Old Man Liu about the Blood Bamboo Forest without leaving traces. If he could undergo a second rebirth earlier, he naturally wouldn't want to delay. He wanted to visit the mysterious Blood Bamboo Forest as soon as possible.
