# Chapter 14: Hotpot, Ying Bing's Dream

Inside the carriage.

This carriage looked unassuming on the outside, but it concealed wonders within. Setting aside other features, just the carriage frame alone was made of Golden Fragrant Wood, carved with taotie patterns, sturdy, incorruptible, and exuding a unique aroma. It was essentially the martial world's version of a Volkswagen Phaeton, and sitting inside, one couldn't even feel the slightest tremor.

“As expected of the Sect Master's personal carriage.”

“Elder, what is the cost of this carriage?” Li Mo felt slightly constrained but couldn't help but exclaim in wonder. He was like a country bumpkin entering a wealthy household, curious but afraid to touch anything.

“This old man's surname is Ba, merely a servant. Young Master can just call me Old Ba,” the old coachman said with a chuckle. “If calculated in gold, this carriage would probably cost tens of thousands of taels. It was a gift from the boss of Hesheng Trading Company.”

Li Mo: “!”

Student Li, who had thought he possessed a modest fortune, now felt the sting of poverty. Tens of thousands of taels, and in gold. Even if the entire thing were made of gold, it wouldn't cost that much.

As if seeing his confusion, Old Ba smiled and said, “This carriage is made of Cold Iron; even those in the Observation God Realm cannot damage it.”

“No wonder, I can’t afford it,” Li Mo suddenly understood, patting his deflated money pouch. His dream of traveling in a similar carriage was shattered.

At the tea table, Ying Bing sat calmly, drinking tea. Casual and natural, an outsider would assume she was the owner of this carriage. No, Li Mo even had the illusion that she was condescending to be there.

*Wasn't that ice block a punching bag in the Li Estate before...?* Li Mo couldn't help but sigh with emotion. This is what it means to possess an Emperor's Bone!

Back at Autumn Water Pavilion.

Ying Bing casually picked up a dead branch and practiced her swordsmanship. She was testing the limits of her current realm, determining the highest level she could achieve with her sword techniques.

At the kitchen door, Li Mo asked, “What do you feel like eating today?”

Qingyuan Sect naturally had a cafeteria. However, since he could get rewards from the "ice block" three times a day, student Li was happy to cook.

“Anything is fine. I have no particular cravings, so you don't need to put much thought into it,” Ying Bing replied without turning her head.

“That’s because you haven’t encountered true gourmet food,” Li Mo said with full confidence. “No exaggeration, if I cook seriously, it’ll be unique under heaven.” Among the white investment feedbacks, there were many seasonings unknown in this world. There was even a hotpot base, which he had wanted to eat for a long time.

Ying Bing remained silent. He didn't know if she heard him or not.

“She’s too focused.” Li Mo sighed inwardly. A person isn’t a machine. Neglecting one’s human needs for too long could lead to psychological problems.

“Is Senior Sister Ying Bing there?” At this moment, a shout came from outside.

Li Mo went out to find an outer sect deacon, who had brought large and small packages. They contained various kinds of exotic beast meat. After consumption, they had the wonderful effect of nourishing qi and blood, and were not commonly found outside. This was also the treatment afforded to a True Disciple of the Sect Master. The outer sect deacon introduced them, stating that these types of meat were raised on Treasured Beast Peak: Iron Bone Ox, Azure Scale Fish, and Rock Sheep.

“There's beef, lamb, and fish. If these were used for a hotpot, tsk tsk.” Li Mo's mouth watered at the thought.

Half an hour later.

A rich, spicy aroma wafted through the courtyard. Li Mo sat before the stove, blanching slices of Iron Bone Ox beef, thin as cicada wings.

“Exquisite.” When this world's exotic beast meat met hotpot base from Earth, it created an endlessly satisfying flavor.

“Quick, try some.” Li Mo blanched some fish, then placed it in Ying Bing's bowl.

The girl’s lips were stained with a layer of red oil, making them appear even more luscious and inviting.

“Is it good?”

“Passable.” Ying Bing's chopstick speed was slightly faster than before.

Li Mo saw it all and smiled, “Then eat more. Exotic beast meat is also beneficial for martial arts training. Eating and desire are human nature. One should enjoy oneself when the time is right.”

Bubbling steam rose. The girl's face became indistinct amidst the smoky steam. Her cheeks moved, but he didn't know if she heard him or not.

Third floor, inside the room.

[Congratulations Host, Investment: One portion of Exotic Beast Hotpot.]
[Received Feedback Reward: One Profound Crystal.]
[Profound Crystal]: "Contains the purest primordial energy between heaven and earth. Can be used for alchemy, weapon forging, or to power various artifacts, with endless wondrous uses."

“This hotpot meal was too worthwhile.” A milky white, rhomboid crystal appeared in Li Mo's palm, faintly glowing. The aura emanating from within was very familiar to him. Wasn't that the primordial energy that flowed into his body during his cultivation? However, the amount of primordial energy contained within this Profound Crystal was immense. He wouldn't know how long it would take him to accumulate such an amount on his own. It wasn't of much use to Li Mo himself. But this item was extremely precious; one piece was an astronomical price! The Stairway to Heaven, for instance, was activated by this very item.

“I've decided, from now on, I'll eat exotic beast meat every day!” Li Mo put away the Profound Crystal, making up his mind. “I must make sure the ice block is well-fed.”

Suddenly, he remembered something else. Didn't Senior Brother Xiao Qin have a Seven-Star Ancient Jade? Because this Seven-Star Ancient Jade required primordial energy to activate, Xiao Qin's cultivation realm had continuously dropped. Wouldn't this Profound Crystal perfectly solve his problem?

“I can’t use the Profound Crystal anyway, so I can invest it in him.” Li Mo had also summarized some investment patterns. The Fate Level was the foundation of the reward. And the more helpful the invested item was to the investment target, the better the reward would be, building upon the Fate Level. Xiao Qin had a Purple Fate Level. The feedback reward would definitely be worth far more than a single Profound Crystal.

“As for Six Harmonies Fist, I don’t need to learn it anymore,” he mused. “With twenty years of martial arts insight, I can definitely master it.” Having learned from his last experience, Li Mo didn't use up all his martial arts insights in one go.

[Five years of martial arts insight, injected successfully.]
[After one year of practice, you have fully mastered the Six Harmonies Fist, able to use it in combat, reaching the initial proficiency realm.]
[By the fourth year, the Six Harmonies Fist, through prolonged focus, has been integrated into your daily movements—walking, sitting, lying down—no longer confined to specific stances.]
[By the fifth year, your Six Harmonies Fist has reached Minor Accomplishment.]

A familiar feeling surged through him. But Minor Accomplishment wasn't enough.

[Five years of martial arts insight, injected successfully.]
[In the first year, you continuously practiced your fist techniques, vaguely perceiving a higher realm of fist arts.]
[In the third year, you had a flash of inspiration, seemingly finding the correct direction, and began to verify and refine it.]
[In the fourth year, your Six Harmonies Fist technique achieved Major Accomplishment!]
[In the fifth year, you gained new insights, but this insight wasn't entirely clear.....]

A familiar feeling surged through him. After completely inheriting the insights, Li Mo clenched his fists, feeling eager to try them out. Thus, he immediately set up his stance in the room and powerfully practiced his fist technique. Each move was powerful and dynamic, indistinguishable from techniques he had practiced himself.

Crack—

Li Mo's power originated from the ground, his entire strength converged into one, and he punched out with a boom. Intent permeates the Six Harmonies! With this punch, the sleeves of his clothes on his arm tore, turning into countless fragments.

“To have this kind of power with only one meridian opened.” Li Mo let out a long breath and went to change into new casual clothes. He currently couldn't even fully exert the power of the Six Harmonies Fist.

Cultivate! He sat cross-legged, quietly circulating the Fire Heart Lotus Birth Art.

***

With one swing of her sword, Ying Bing produced nine sword flowers. It was the Flower Seeking Sword Art. She knew it in her previous life, but today she still carefully watched Elder Han He demonstrate it seriously once. After all, this was a secret technique of the sect. If she directly said she knew it, it would be difficult to explain. Now, at most, she could achieve one sword seeking nine flowers. In her prime, she could casually unleash this sword technique to conjure a sky full of falling flower petals, all formed by sword qi. If augmented by the power of Yin, freezing a large lake would be effortless. Her current realm was still too low.

Ying Bing sheathed her sword and stood upright, ready to intensify her cultivation. Suddenly, her delicate brows furrowed slightly. The commotion next door.....

“When he cultivates, he draws in primordial energy from heaven and earth?” she wondered. “This shouldn't be a technique from the Merchant Dance School; it seems more like a special physique......” Ying Bing was slightly surprised. She knew many cultivation methods that directly borrowed the energy of heaven and earth to enhance oneself. But no matter which one, they could only be used by cultivators above the Outer View realm. Without the connection between one's inner world and the outer world, a martial artist simply couldn't directly draw from heaven and earth. That could only mean it was due to Li Mo's special physique.

“Sourceflow Martial Physique..... Evergreen Wood Physique...... Limitless Heavenly Physique......” Ying Bing fell into contemplation, recalling many prodigies she had encountered. Among them, some truly possessed enough talent to leave a lasting impression on her. Which one could Li Mo's be? Or perhaps one she had never encountered before?

After a moment, Ying Bing retracted her thoughts. She was merely curious as to why Li Mo's changes were so significant. What kind of physique it was, wasn't important. If she didn't know, it meant it wasn't strong enough, at least not strong enough to have appeared on the Heavenly Secret Pavilion's Nine Heavens Ten Earths Ranking. And if it were one of those defeated opponents from her memories, what then? In any case, it couldn't compare to the Ten Peerless Physiques.

She cultivated for two hours straight. Her body once again began to emit icy cold qi.

She had just sat on her bed when—

Knock-knock—

The door was pushed open a crack, and Li Mo, holding a copper basin, poked his head in: “Ying Bing, the exotic beast meat needs to be refrigerated. I've put it in your room!”

*Ice Block Brand Refrigerator, everyone who used it said it was good.*

Ying Bing: “?”

Ying Bing watched him place a covered basin of exotic beast meat in the corner, then leave. As he left, he even turned off her light. If it were before, she would definitely have thrown the copper basin out and warned Li Mo with a cold stare, ensuring he wouldn't dare to enter her room or place things inside without permission again. But today..... the deliciousness of the hotpot still lingered on her tongue, an endless aftertaste that wouldn't fade..... If the meat spoiled, she wouldn't be able to eat it, right?

Swish—

She pulled shut her bed curtains. The biting cold spread through the room, becoming increasingly quiet, and she gradually fell asleep.

The girl’s sleeping face was slightly creased, but not from the torment of extreme cold. She had a dream. She dreamt of scenes from when she was revered as Empress Huangtian, presiding over the Osmanthus Palace.

“Palace Master, I know that disciples of the Osmanthus Palace cannot become entangled in love, so... please, Palace Master, cripple my martial arts.”
“Master, I traveled the jianghu and met a good man......”
“Palace Master....”
“Hahahaha, Ying Bing, so you don't even know what love is? How truly pathetic you are!”

Various disordered images flashed through her mind, and her brows furrowed even deeper.
