# Chapter 19: Turning the Tables

After adapting to the changes of the fourth layer of Evergreen Arts, Han Zhen struggled to suppress the urge to continue cultivating.

Among the secret techniques Han Zhen brought from the Seven Absolute Hall, he found the Misty Smoke Steps. This movement technique emphasized seizing every opening, achieving acceleration in a short time by expending a large amount of stamina. This footwork was most marvelous when used in confined spaces, capable of turning the impossible into reality during actual combat. Han Zhen valued Misty Smoke Steps also for its versatility; it could not only be integrated into escape techniques but even Han Li continued to combine it with Nine Transformations of Swift Wind after reaching the Spirit Realm.

Half a month later, one moment Han Zhen was still in the cultivation room, and the next he appeared outside the door. With the aid of [Heaven Rewards Diligence], Han Zhen merely practiced systematically, not even needing to stimulate his potential in extreme environments, and had already cultivated the Misty Smoke Steps to perfection.

“Next up is cultivating secret techniques related to concealing my aura,” Han Zhen thought. To secretly take Zhang Tie away, the first step was to deal with the little yellow bird that had been monitoring him. If he merely wanted to kill it, no matter how astonishingly fast the little yellow bird was, it would be absolutely impossible for it to evade Han Zhen’s sneak attack using spirit energy to propel a small arrow. However, for such a spiritual bird, when Han Zhen first saw it, a special feeling involuntarily arose in his heart—as if this bird shared some ineffable fate with him.

Time flowed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, the three-month period Han Zhen had agreed upon with Mo Juren was almost up.

On this day, a major event suddenly occurred in the Seven Mysteries Sect: one of Old Man Mo’s disciples had suddenly disappeared. Only a letter was left, stating that he was going to venture into the *jianghu*, hoping Old Man Mo would not involve his family. This incident caused a huge stir throughout the Seven Mysteries Sect. One must know that as Old Man Mo’s disciple, one enjoyed treatment no worse than that of inner disciples in the Seven Mysteries Sect. Coupled with Physician Mo’s prestige, disciples and even protectors of the Seven Mysteries Sect were extremely polite to Old Man Mo’s disciples. After all, no one knew when they might need Physician Mo’s help.

The truth was, Zhang Tie had broken through to the third layer of Elephant Armor Art several days ago. However, Zhang Tie’s breakthrough occurred in a cultivation room prepared by Han Zhen. Zhang Tie’s disappearance was naturally Han Zhen’s doing. With the five senses of a Qi Condensation fourth-layer cultivator, a sophisticated aura concealment technique, and the ghostly footwork of Misty Smoke Steps, if he still couldn’t catch a bird, Han Zhen might as well bash his head against a block of tofu and die. At first, the bird struggled continuously, trying to escape Han Zhen’s grasp.

However, when Han Zhen carefully injected a wisp of spirit energy into the bird’s body, a connection was established between them. Han Zhen could instantly perceive the bird’s various emotions and quickly calmed it down. As for the tracking methods Mo Juren had placed on Zhang Tie, Han Zhen naturally severed them all, and even created the impression that Zhang Tie had escaped from Mount Caixia.

However, Physician Mo did not follow the traces Han Zhen deliberately left to pursue Zhang Tie out of the mountain. Instead, he released news of Zhang Tie’s disappearance and declared that he would hold Zhang Tie’s referrer and relatives responsible. Evidently, Mo Juren still harbored doubts, believing Zhang Tie might be hidden somewhere within Mount Caixia. Perhaps he was banking on Zhang Tie’s kind heart, attempting to threaten him with his relatives to force him to appear. Han Zhen did not inform Zhang Tie of this news; letting him know would only add to his troubles.

As for why the Elephant Armor Art had side effects unbearable for humans, Han Zhen clearly told Zhang Tie that the Elephant Armor Art was simply not a martial art prepared for living people. Instead, it was for creating refined corpses; dead people wouldn’t fear pain and could naturally ignore the side effects of the Elephant Armor Art after its completion. And inherently, Mo Juren himself had suspicions that couldn’t be washed clean; a little investigation could confirm the truth. Before finding Han Li, Physician Mo had also sought out over a hundred youths, none of whom successfully entered the path of Evergreen Arts. Among those youths, many were nominal disciples of the Seven Mysteries Sect like Han Li and Zhang Tie, and without exception, they all later disappeared for various reasons. Even if someone felt something was amiss, no one would question it or even suspect Physician Mo. Han Zhen slightly embellished this matter, making this well-intentioned lie more convincing.

Zhang Tie naturally believed Han Zhen’s words deeply. Because he had recently vaguely felt a terrifying gaze from Physician Mo’s eyes, and even Mo Juren had begun to express dissatisfaction and urge him regarding his Elephant Armor Art cultivation progress. It was as if he was being treated as an object, with Mo Juren contemplating how to use him. Thus, Zhang Tie abandoned the cultivation of Elephant Armor Art, which Han Zhen could understand. From the fourth layer onwards, not only would the cultivation speed slow down, but the pain to be endured would be incomparable to that of the first three layers combined. Cultivating to become stronger should be a joyful endeavor. If one pursues powerful strength purely, and the pain experienced far outweighs the happiness gained, it would be putting the cart before the horse.

Finally, the three-month period was up. Although he could feel his cultivation progressing every day, Han Zhen was still some distance away from breaking through to the fifth layer of Evergreen Arts. After all, Mount Caixia’s innate conditions were insufficient, with sparse spiritual energy, and Han Zhen also lacked elixirs to aid his cultivation in advancing his spirit energy.

Coming out of his seclusion chamber, Han Zhen first deliberately pretended to have just learned of Zhang Tie’s disappearance. Then, he angrily marched towards Divine Hand Valley to demand an explanation, escalating the matter all the way to Wang Juechu, the Sect Master of the Seven Mysteries Sect. This was a complex situation for the Sect Master: one concerned the future of the Seven Mysteries Sect, bearing the supreme glory of revitalizing its past might and dominating Jingzhou; the other was Wang Juechu’s life-saver, and had saved the lives of countless Seven Mysteries Sect disciples, truly an undeniable divine physician in the hearts of the Seven Mysteries Sect disciples. Wang Juechu couldn’t understand how these two could possibly come into conflict, and hastily went to intervene.

Han Zhen went outside Divine Hand Valley to confront Mo Juren, first turning the tables by claiming that the Evergreen Scroll was nothing but a sham. With his talent and aptitude, he couldn't even get started in three whole months, claiming that such a martial art could not possibly exist in the world. Mo Juren, unable to reveal the relationship between cultivators and spirit roots to these mortals, was thoroughly infuriated by Han Zhen’s unreasonable behavior. Originally, with Zhang Tie’s escape, Physician Mo had lost a prime material for a refined corpse and couldn’t spare the time to search for him, so he had been in a foul mood recently. Han Zhen’s disturbance only solidified Mo Juren’s intention to turn Han Zhen into a refined corpse after possessing Han Li.

Han Zhen then questioned whether Han Li was still in Divine Hand Valley, linking Zhang Tie’s disappearance with Mo Juren preventing him from meeting Han Li. He even suggested that Zhang Tie’s disappearance was merely Mo Juren’s self-directed play. Faced with such baseless accusations, Mo Juren, even with a thousand mouths, would find it hard to explain himself clearly. Left with no choice, he ultimately had to let Han Zhen meet Han Li.
