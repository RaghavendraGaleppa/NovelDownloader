# Chapter 217: Boundary Mountain

"Elder Lü!" As the greetings of Foundation Establishment cultivators rang out, Elder Lü, whom Li Yuanba had met upon entering the sect, descended from the sky.

"This time, you will likely face the Buddhas of the Thousand Leaves Temple. The Buddhas excel at disturbing the mind, and their Buddhist techniques have a certain restraining effect on our sect's demonic arts. However, their combat experience is far inferior to yours. You must leverage your strengths. 

The sect has doubled the rewards for this mission. If you encounter any Arhats or other righteous cultivators, report immediately!" Elder Lü said solemnly to the over two hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators.

A Buddha was equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Daoist tradition.

Hearing that the rewards had been doubled, all the demonic cultivators present were visibly excited, eager to reach the battlefield immediately. 

There, they would find the resources they coveted—even the physical bodies of the Buddhas were considered premium materials.

"True disciples board the ship first, followed by the rest!" Elder Lü announced once the demonic cultivators had settled down, summoning a large flying vessel.

Twelve cultivators stepped forward from the crowd and leaped onto the ship. Li Yuanba followed behind them, entering the vessel.

Among the twelve true disciples, some nodded in greeting, others remained expressionless, and a few eyed him with scrutiny. Li Yuanba ignored their gazes—these were demonic cultivators, after all. Who knew what schemes they harbored?

The thirteen true disciples were each assigned private quarters on the ship, a privilege reserved for their status. 

Though a private room might seem insignificant, this special treatment symbolized their standing, eliciting envy from the other inner and outer sect Foundation Establishment cultivators gathered in the common area.

Once all the cultivators had boarded, Elder Lü activated the flying vessel, soaring into the sky.

"Senior Brother, are you there?" Li Yuanba was meditating on his sword intent when a voice called from outside his door.

He paused. Among the over two hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators, he knew none—save for Elder Lü, whom he had only met briefly.

Since the visitor addressed him as "Senior Brother," it couldn't be Elder Lü.

True disciples held higher status than inner sect disciples, who in turn outranked outer sect disciples. Thus, regardless of seniority or cultivation level, inner sect disciples addressed true disciples as "Senior Brother," and outer sect disciples did the same for inner sect disciples. 

This hierarchy was dictated by sect rules, not personal relationships.

Li Yuanba opened the door to find a pale-faced cultivator with a thin mustache.

"Senior Brother, I am Wang Chengjun of the inner sect, at mid-Foundation Establishment. I wish to join your team to face the enemy together!" Wang Chengjun bowed respectfully and stated his request.

"I don’t have a team, nor do I wish to form one. Seek someone else," Li Yuanba refused without hesitation.

"Senior Brother, though you are a true disciple, the bald monks of the Thousand Leaves Temple are formidable. It’s safer to work as a team," Wang Chengjun persisted.

"Unnecessary. Do not disturb me again." This time, Li Yuanba shut the door directly in Wang Chengjun's face.

Wang Chengjun's respectful expression vanished instantly, replaced by a flash of malice and disappointment at his failed scheme.

Glancing around, he moved on to engage with other cultivators.

Soon, others came knocking with similar requests to join Li Yuanba's team. After several rejections, the visits ceased.

Li Yuanba shook his head. He had little desire to interact with these demonic cultivators. His experience with the Profound Nether Sect's demonic cultivators on Tianhai Island had taught him their infamous treachery and cunning.

Back on Tianhai Island, the seven sects had maintained relatively close ties without high-level conflicts, which had imposed some restraint on the demonic cultivators. 

But the cultivators of the Netherworld Sect were true demonic practitioners. While they might exercise caution within the sect, outside its walls, Li Yuanba had to be wary of their threats.

It was almost amusing—Li Yuanba had to guard against enemies outside the sect while also watching his back for fellow demonic cultivators who might seize an opportunity to strike.

True disciples were formidable, but as a newly promoted true disciple at only early Foundation Establishment, his status made him a prime target. 

To demonic cultivators, a true disciple's wealth was an irresistible temptation, especially one without overwhelming strength.

With Wang Chengjun, Li Yuanba had sensed malice beneath the veneer of respect. Influenced by his main body's heightened perception, his instincts had grown sharper.

Under the propulsion of a Golden Core elder, the flying vessel moved swiftly. In just over a day, they passed Boundary Mountain City and arrived at the Boundary Mountain Pass.

Standing on the deck, Li Yuanba surveyed the landscape below. His main body, Li Shiming, had once visited Boundary Mountain City. Two hundred li beyond lay the Boundary Mountain Pass, the primary route connecting the Ten Thousand Mountains to the rest of Northern Shu.

Back then, Li Shiming had been inside a cargo vehicle, unable to observe the pass properly.

As the large flying vessel landed on a mountain peak, Li Yuanba sensed intense fluctuations of a formation. A scanning pulse swept over all the cultivators, causing his identity jade slip to vibrate slightly.

This was an authentication measure. Anyone not of the Netherworld Sect would trigger the formation's attacks.

"Beyond this point is the contested zone. Intelligence indicates the Thousand Leaves Temple has dispatched at least six hundred Buddhas. If any Arhats or righteous cultivators attack you, report to the elders immediately. Here, the sect has four elders stationed, myself included," Elder Lü instructed gravely after all the Foundation Establishment cultivators disembarked.

No further explanation was needed. While Li Yuanba might lack experience in such matters, the others dispersed swiftly after Elder Lü's briefing.

Li Yuanba retrieved his identity jade slip and accessed the local map. The pass housed a Mission Hall, an Exchange Hall, and a Healing Hall.

The Mission Hall issued specific assignments—such as targeting a particular elite disciple of the Thousand Leaves Temple—with separate rewards and possible location hints. 

"Possible" because in the chaos of war, positions changed rapidly, making precise tracking impossible.

Enemy corpses had to be brought here for contribution points to be tallied.

The Exchange Hall handled loot recovery, allowing cultivators to trade contribution points for pills, artifacts, techniques, and more—converting spoils into immediate strength.

The Healing Hall, as the name suggested, treated the wounded.

Conflicts between major sects followed ancient protocols unless escalating to all-out war.

Battles began with Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, then gradually intensified—but never beyond the Golden Core stage. 

Golden Core battles already inflicted severe environmental damage, but Nascent Soul clashes were on another level. Thus, Nascent Soul combatants typically fought in the Thirty-Threefold Heavens, the only realm capable of withstanding their power.

Given Northern Shu's advanced cultivation standards, conflicts between major sects began at the Foundation Establishment level.

Both sects were furious but restrained, channeling their aggression through these traditional warfare rituals to vent hostilities without mutual annihilation.

Li Yuanba first checked the Mission Hall but found no tasks posted yet—likely because intelligence on the Thousand Leaves Temple's movements remained incomplete.

Beyond the Boundary Mountain Pass lay two hundred li of mountains and another two hundred li of hills—a buffer zone established by both the Netherworld Sect and the righteous factions to prevent direct border friction.

This four-hundred-li expanse was now the battlefield, with both sides deploying large numbers of Foundation Establishment cultivators.

The over two hundred cultivators accompanying Li Yuanba were just one contingent. The pass already housed others, with more arriving and yet to come.

Eager demonic cultivators had already summoned wraiths, iron corpses, spirit insects, and beasts, advancing into the battlefield to secure advantageous positions.

Li Yuanba, however, was in no hurry. Besides participating in the war, he had another objective—to rendezvous with his main body, Li Shiming.

This was a rare opportunity. Once deep in the battlefield, he would effectively escape the sect's surveillance.

Meanwhile, Li Shiming was en route. Now a true disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect under the guise of an alchemist, Li Shiming enjoyed even greater freedom of movement than Li Yuanba.

Li Yuanba waited until dusk before taking flight. Without augmenting his sword light with intent, his speed was modest.

Contrary to expectations, he encountered no battles even fifty li from the pass. The surroundings were eerily quiet.

Yet he could sense the unusually active spiritual energy in the air—evidence of recent combat where cultivators had mobilized vast amounts of power.

He didn't fully understand why major sects chose this form of warfare. Was it to temper disciples? Or to buy time for cooler heads to prevail, keeping conflicts manageable?

If the Netherworld Sect and the Thousand Leaves Temple had escalated straight to Golden Core battles, the devastation would have weakened both sides, leaving them vulnerable to opportunistic rivals.

As a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Yuanba wasn't privy to high-level strategies. His role was to fight, gain experience, and grow stronger.

At eighty li in, he halted, frowning.

Phantom shadows and swirling black mist surrounded him.

The air carried mind-numbing and toxic elements. A moment of carelessness could impair even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, drastically reducing their combat effectiveness.

Li Yuanba hadn't expected his first battle to be against fellow sect members rather than the Thousand Leaves Temple's Buddhas.

Demonic cultivators lived up to their reputation—profit trumped all.

Though the ambushers remained hidden, the ghostly, frigid formation bore none of the Thousand Leaves Temple's hallmarks.

"Show yourself, Wang Chengjun," Li Yuanba said coldly.

His sword intent repelled the mind-numbing and toxic particles effortlessly. As for the formation, to him, formation disks were laughably crude.

Even he carried formation flags instead of disks—a testament to their inferiority in the eyes of advanced formation masters.

"Ah, Senior Brother True Disciple! How did you stumble into our little trap?" Wang Chengjun's voice echoed mockingly from all directions.

Clearly, despite Li Yuanba's novice status and early Foundation Establishment cultivation, Wang Chengjun remained cautious, relying on the formation to weaken him for a clean kill.

Most crucially, Li Yuanba couldn't be allowed to escape alive—assaulting a true disciple was a grave offense.

Li Yuanba's aura shifted abruptly. Terrifying sword intent surged as a sword light shot forth.

A scream followed—Wang Chengjun's, laced with shock and horror.

As the sword light returned, it swept through the formation, dispelling all shadows and mist.

A glowing formation disk dimmed rapidly, its structure shattered by the sword intent.

Four figures were now exposed. Wang Chengjun stood pale, missing an arm.

At the critical moment, he had employed a life-saving secret art, sacrificing his arm as a decoy to block Li Yuanba's strike. 

For a Foundation Establishment cultivator, regrowing a limb required rare elixirs and years of recovery time—resources that would divert precious cultivation hours.

Moreover, the contribution points needed for such elixirs would take years to accumulate.

Wang Chengjun's greatest fear was Li Yuanba effortlessly dismantling the formation.

If Li Yuanba left now, he and his three accomplices would face dire consequences.

"Brothers, we have no retreat! Letting him go means death. Only by killing him do we survive!" Wang Chengjun rallied his companions.

He had chosen three mid-Foundation Establishment peers—strong enough to be useful, yet not so powerful as to eliminate him afterward.

Too weak, and they'd be useless against a true disciple. This delicate balance ensured mutual deterrence and cooperation.

"Enough talk! No holding back—this is a true disciple! Half-measures will doom us!" another mid-Foundation demonic cultivator urged.

He summoned an iron corpse and unfurled a black banner, releasing a Foundation Establishment-level ghost.

Wang Chengjun waved his hand, unleashing a swarm of spirit insects that surged toward Li Yuanba like a black tide.

The other two mid-Foundation demonic cultivators transformed—one into a three-meter-tall beast wielding a massive axe, the other fading into near-invisibility in the darkness.
