# Chapter 153: The Twilight of the Dynasty

Xu Yunfan secretly mused, "No wonder the Pure Yang One Qi Technique has progressed three-tenths faster these past few days."

Over the last few days, the progress of his Pure Yang One Qi Technique had actually increased by more than thirty percent compared to before.

On his attribute panel, the frequency of the Origin Spirit Guidance prompts had increased from once a day three days ago to three times a day.

Since three days ago, this faint glow had risen and fallen like a tide three times a day and night. The warm Qi dormant deep within his flesh and blood had become increasingly substantial, as if a flood dragon or python were roaming through his muscles and meridians.

Even now, he could clearly feel the wisps of warmth dormant within his flesh and blood. It was as if spring had returned to the earth, causing all things to revive, continuously nourishing his body.

After stepping into the Outer Three Unions Great Martial Master realm, with each day of cultivation and the rapid twisting and merging of his own strength, he could feel the three trainings of muscles, bones, and skin being fused together by the Pure Yang One Qi Technique.

Once this fusion was complete, he would naturally step into the Muscle Refining realm.

Xu Yunfan felt that this was not too far off.

For others, the integration of the three forces is a relatively long process. However, with the aid of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, the increase in proficiency shown on the attribute panel, and his own diligent cultivation efforts, he could step into Muscle Refining within half a year at most, and thus begin refining his flesh and blood.

He suddenly opened his eyes. A wisp of violet Qi, almost visible to the naked eye, swept over from where the sun rose in the east and instantly vanished into his nasal orifices.

The battle in Jade Capital City had shaken the Six Paths and Seventy-Nine Prefectures.

Last night's eagle messenger scroll mentioned that the Great Zhou Empress had used the millennium-old metropolis as a sword sheath, executing three strikes to drive back the reclusive Sword Demon, Dugu Nine.

Now, that towering, magnificent city had become broken walls and ruins. Three hundred thousand commoners had dyed the long streets in blood. Yet, this earth-shattering price only bought the talk that "the Empress's sword intent has advanced another half-inch" in the rumors of the Jianghu.

Behind this brilliance lay the collapse of the city, the displacement of the people, and the streets stained with blood.

Although the Origin Spirit of heaven and earth had recovered somewhat, it seemed to be bound by invisible shackles, stuck at a subtle node where it was about to disperse but hadn't yet. It had not returned to the state of extinction, but it was extremely thin and unsustainable.

"Similar to two thousand years ago, the state of the Origin Spirit is on the verge of dispersing. If nothing unexpected happens, the Origin Spirit of the entire world will disperse again in a few decades."

Mo Han of the Mechanism Hall used an extremely ancient armillary sphere to test for three consecutive days before finally reaching a conclusion. He released this information throughout the Heavenly Work Cave and released an extremely ancient breathing technique. With the right opportunity and aptitude, one could capture the Origin Spirit of heaven and earth to nourish the body.

Unfortunately, to this day, not a single person in the Heavenly Work Cave has been able to sense the so-called Origin Spirit Qi of heaven and earth.

On this day, Xu Yunfan completed his routine maintenance of the Heavenly Work Fortress. Seeing the prompt on his vision that the Heavenly Work Forging Technique had increased by a point, he happily washed up and returned to the Casting Hall.

As soon as he entered the Casting Hall's驻地 (stronghold), Xu Yunfan saw Zhan Yan and Mo Han discussing something with worried expressions.

When Mo Han saw Xu Yunfan approaching, he said, "Hall Master Zhan, I will be troubling you for the next part."

Zhan Yan said in a deep voice, "Leave it to me."

Mo Han gave Xu Yunfan a kind smile and was about to say something when Zhan Yan, without a trace of emotion, stepped between the two of them.

Mo Han immediately shut his mouth, let out a cold snort at Zhan Yan, flicked his sleeve, and hurried away.

"Yunfan, you're back?"

Turning around, Zhan Yan's expression softened, a hint of a smile on his face. "Wait until your Senior Brother returns, and I'll explain some things to you both together."

When Fu Jin hurried over and sat down, Zhan Yan took a letter from his怀里 (bosom).

"The Empress has suffered serious injuries and is in seclusion. Jade Capital has issued twelve edicts in a row, recalling the Tiger Vanguard and Black Armor from the Six Paths and Seventy-Two Prefectures to defend Jade Capital," Zhan Yan said with a hint of schadenfreude in his voice. "Dugu Nine shattered the Dragon Vein beneath the Imperial Palace. Now, the Dragon Qi of the Central Province is on the verge of dispersing. I'm afraid that Great Zhou Empress can no longer hold onto the Great Zhou Dynasty."

Fu Jin sneered, "Now that the Empress has failed in her attempt to rise again with the Origin Spirit, this move has consumed a hundred years of national fortune. Now, she has dragged the entire Great Zhou into fragmentation."

As he spoke, he couldn't help but stroke the Nine-Ring Mountain Shaking Hammer hanging at his waist. His rough fingers brushed over the edges, producing a clanging sound.

Xu Yunfan remained silent. Putting aside the Transcendent Martial Way, the Great Zhou was now走向末路 (heading towards its end).

If the Empress could truly be reborn with the Origin Spirit, combining her Ninth Realm cultivation with the vast military might of the Great Zhou Imperial Court, she would surely suppress all the villains and continue the Great Zhou Empire's prosperity.

Now, the historical process of his previous life was vivid before his eyes. The next step would be the rise of heroes in various prefectures, the trend of separatist regimes declaring themselves kings. The entire Great Zhou would become even more desolate, with its people suffering greatly.

Zhan Yan took a drink of cold wine and unfolded the paper he had taken from his bosom. The edges of the parchment were charred, winding like snakes. The vermilion seal of the Golden Wind and Drizzle Tower glimmered with a blood-red light under the candlelight.

"The Governor of Yangzhou has supported the Prince of Jing's heir. Three thousand scholars have jointly written the 'Ode to Purge the Emperor's Side,' claiming that the Empress raises the Incense Fire Cult to refine human pills," he said, flicking the two characters for "human pill" with his finger, a mocking expression on his face. "Coincidentally, seven days ago, the Dao Son of the Qingwei Mountain Dao Sect descended the mountain, raising the slogan of slaying the Incense Fire Cult demons."

Fu Jin suddenly crushed his wine cup. Amber-colored strong wine dripped down through his fingers, his face filled with indignation.

"That bunch of nose-cultivators (Daoists) is best at judging the situation. When the Empress secretly commanded the Incape Fire Cult to bloody-wash Yizhou in the Jiannan Dao, it was right under their noses. In the end, they played deaf and dumb. Now they put on the airs of upright gentlemen... heh..."

After discussing for a long time, Zhan Yan slowly said, "Although the Origin Spirit has not fully recovered and is in a state of near dispersal, there are still traces of it in the world. The Incape Fire Cult has slaughtered sixteen provinces, which is a great outrage that has angered heaven and earth. I'm afraid many evil things will breed from this. Those dormant demons will probably be stirred out by this mouthful of Origin Spirit."

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but confirm again, "Master, do demons truly exist in this world?"

"Very soon, perhaps we will hear news of them very soon."

Zhan Yan stood up, looking down through the window at the mountains, rivers, and seas passing by below. The sixteen pillar-like, mountain-supporting玄钢 (mystic steel) spider legs of the Heavenly Work Fortress were continuously moving forward.

A month passed in the blink of an eye. The Origin Spirit stirred up from the earth's veins had increased slightly, but it was still pitifully thin, almost negligible.

Many disciples of the Heavenly Work Cave were cultivating the breathing technique with all their might, visualizing the Origin Spirit to nourish their bodies. Unfortunately, until now, no one has borne any fruit.

Even the Sect Master, Hong Baichuan, still could not find the method.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan naturally did not say much. He just silently sat cross-legged on the雷火台 (Thunderfire Platform) on the suspended side of the Heavenly Work Fortress, waiting for the daily sunrise to swallow the violet Qi from the east, nourishing the gradually growing wisps of Qi within his blood and flesh.

In one month's time, Xu Yunfan had already increased the proficiency of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique by nearly half.

At the end of the Yin hour (3-5 AM), Xu Yunfan stood shirtless atop the highest Thunderfire Platform of the Heavenly Work Fortress.

The twenty-four sections of his spine were like a steel whip, connected through each joint. The blood Qi surging beneath his skin steamed into a faint red mist in the morning wind. This was a sign that the Pure Yang One Qi Technique was about to reach Minor Completion. As his proficiency advanced, his strength was steadily growing.
