**Chapter 32: Five-Colored Mist Illuminates All Directions**

Tonight, the mountains were shrouded in a thick darkness, as if by a colossal black curtain. Now, a five-colored mist suddenly surged from deep within the mountains, instantly tearing through the night sky, illuminating all directions. The towering peaks were bathed in radiant light, and the snow-laden branches of trees shimmered brilliantly.

This scene stunned everyone. The entire mountain range ahead was filled with rising light mist, shimmering with brilliant hues. In an era without sunlight, such splendor was mesmerizing and deeply yearned for.

Chaos erupted throughout the mountains. Experts even slightly closer to the source of the five-colored mist wished they could sprout wings of lightning and fly over immediately, eager to contend for the most mysterious treasure in the entire mountain range.

"So early? It's actually matured!"
"Ah..."

People from all factions went mad, rushing towards the source. Screams could already be heard halfway, as some began to launch sneak attacks in the dark.

Amidst the vast mountain ranges, renowned beasts roared and strange birds soared. Large numbers of other non-human creatures also began to frenzy, heading towards the same destination.

Deep in the mountains, the five-colored mist lingered, reaching deep into the dark night sky, its dazzling glow illuminating all directions.

People understood clearly that all these unusual phenomena were mere manifestations; everything was caused by the mature treasure within the special node. It was this treasure, shrouded in white mist and exuding ethereal smoke, that triggered the mysterious spectacle.

Ten-meter-tall Wei Mo stood on a broken cliff, gazing at the five-colored mists ahead. His dark red armor clanged like the scales of a flood dragon, emanating crimson light. He pushed off with his feet, and with a thunderous *boom*, he shattered the cliff, sending rocks tumbling down, causing the ground to shake with astonishing force.

He leaped down, wielding a black spear, and rushed towards the depths of the mountains.

"Brother Wei, you'd better stay," a white-robed figure appeared, none other than the City Lord of Crimson Cloud City, blocking his path.

"Ling Xu, you dare stop me?" Wei Mo, holding his black spear, traversed the mountain forest. With a single leap, he vanished from his spot, then reappeared abruptly, his spear tearing through a large section of the forest like a black lightning bolt, thrusting directly before Ling Xu.

In another part of the mountains, a three-foot-long tabby cat, with a crimson longsword strapped to its back, moved swiftly. Its movements were agile, light, and silent, avoiding numerous other creatures as it headed straight for the center of the surging five-colored mist.

"Halt!" Suddenly, a creature roared, rushing towards it like lightning. Clearly, it intended to compete with the tabby cat for that priceless mysterious treasure.

A mantis beast appeared, arriving with a gust of wind, snapping all the branches in its path. It powerfully blocked the tabby cat's way.

Its entire body was white, similar in form to a praying mantis, but it was over a person's height, covered in snow-white fur. Its mantis arms were long, resembling two large, serrated, snow-white blades, shimmering with a faint light mist.

The tabby cat didn't waste words. It drew its crimson longsword, and immediately, it shone like the evening glow, dyeing this part of the mountain forest red, its sword qi soaring into the night sky.

At the same time, blade light also sliced through the night, interweaving like lightning in the deep forest. Tall trees collapsed in swathes under the impact of invisible blade qi, some even exploding.

…

Old Weasel, usually so calm and accustomed to riding his donkey, had today abandoned his mount. He moved at extreme speed, skimming the treetops of various trees, like a streak of white lightning.

"Hm?" He suddenly stopped, standing atop a dozens-of-meter-tall larch. His "left hand" was clasped behind his back, a string of beads wrapped around his "right hand," as he gazed up at the sky.

"The rare treasure from that node is not meant for you!" A cold voice echoed from the night mist filling the sky.

"It seems besides those from Crimson Cloud City, there are other outsiders secretly watching," Old Weasel spoke, a rare amount of words compared to his usual demeanor.

"Stay!" A voice came from the black cloud mist in the night sky, clearly intending to stop the Old Weasel, whose strength was unfathomable, to buy time for others.

Old Weasel replied, "Have you considered that if you hold me back, your companions might also be intercepted? You're not the only group of hidden observers. Why not let me pass and stir the waters?"

"Impossible to let you pass. I've wanted to test your capabilities for a long time. You actually collaborated with the people of Crimson Cloud City to injure my friend, hmph!" Wings emerged from the cloud mist, and a large, scale-covered claw stretched out, grabbing towards the Old Weasel on the ground, truly like a cloud dragon extending its claw.

Old Weasel's right hand, wrapped in prayer beads, fiercely struck upwards. With a thunderous *boom*, it sounded like a bolt of lightning, and terrifying beams of light twisted like horrific flashes of electricity under the night sky, deafeningly loud.

The clouds in the sky were dispersed, revealing a colossal creature, flapping its silver wings, retreating continuously under the impact, stirring up terrifying gale-force winds.

The larch beneath Old Weasel's feet also snapped, and large swathes of other nearby trees collapsed and exploded, creating a terrifying scene. He lightly landed on a rock.

In the distance, among the mountains, it was as if a bright moon had risen from the sea. A Moonworm appeared, confronting a feather-robed woman, who stood on a large blue bird, shimmering with hazy light. Then, a battle began.

…

"I truly regret not being in my prime, standing at the peak! I would also go deep into those mountains to contend for the rare spiritual treasures nurtured by the spiritual mountains. Alas, watching helplessly, I don't even dare to approach. My heart aches!"

In the outer reaches of the mountain forest, someone was shouting, appearing distraught.

"You're currently one of the weaker newcomers in our team. Wake up. It's hard to say if you'll even exist in your prime."

Countless people in the dense forest watched with burning eyes, but after the initial impulse, they gradually halted their steps. Their strength was insufficient to venture deep into the mountains and contend for opportunities with the old monsters; that would simply be seeking death.

All teams had calmed down. There was no other way; if they acted rashly, the high-level creatures and old monsters in the mountains would swiftly and thoroughly "cool them down," making their entire bodies ice cold.

After stopping, Cao Long, wielding his longbow, began searching for that foul-mouthed Talking Finch, which had dared to refer to him as a "lump."

"A special node has been discovered here! Someone wants to hog it all!" The mutated Talking Finch chirped again, truly as if it had become sentient, knowing how to invite trouble and intending to lure other teams to attack.

*Chirp, chirp, chirp!*
Iron arrows flew out, one after another, dense and numerous, shooting towards the direction from which the Talking Finch's voice came.

"They're killing to silence witnesses! Help! There's a special node here, and a mysterious treasure has appeared!" The mutated Talking Finch fled.

"Today is not suitable for deep exploration. We should retreat," Mu Qing said. The mountains were in utter chaos now. The five-colored mist had appeared, signifying the greatest fortune, and the old monsters would go berserk. It was uncertain what would happen, and innocent people might be affected.

Cao Long and Wei Zhirou also nodded in agreement. Their three teams were more cautious, preferring to achieve nothing than to make a mistake and lose their lives.

"Alright, we'll just familiarize ourselves with the outer environment today. We won't go deeper. We'll wait until the high-level battles have completely settled."

Deep in the mountains, terrifying lights flashed one after another. Renowned birds spread their wings, tearing through the night sky, and human experts let out terrifying long howls.

The fighting deep in the mountains was extremely fierce.

Old Liu, the Dog Rider, Yang Yongqing, the Black Goat Rider, and others, acting as guides, were now free to act as they pleased, because Mu Qing, Cao Long, and their teams had retreated to the periphery, considering further action only after the battles concluded.

Qin Ming was content to stay out of trouble. He naturally wouldn't go deep. Rare treasures were indeed tempting, but one needed to be alive to obtain them.

He wandered through the mountain forest, searching for that Talking Finch. He had once promised Xiao Wenrui he'd catch one, but had never found it. Today, this mutated one seemed exceptionally intelligent.

Unfortunately, he didn't find it again. This mutated Talking Finch was too clever. After severely offending Cao Long and the others, it had completely vanished without a trace.

Qin Ming paused his steps, then headed towards the crevice that had once caused him a severe illness, to see how this special node was faring after the dramatic changes in the mountains.

"He's left Mu Qing, Cao Long, and the others. Perhaps now is the time to test his capabilities," someone informed You Liangyun, who was also in the mountain forest.

"Is that so? Good, let's follow!" You Liangyun, clad in his finest armor and wielding a chillingly sharp longsword, led his people swiftly through the forest.

…

Deep in the mountains, the struggle among experts was indeed terrifying and tragic. A massive monster was severely wounded, blood gushing from its neck like a fountain, and when its body fell, the ground trembled, crushing a large swath of trees.

Purple light surged here, like clouds filling the sky. Long halberds streaked across the air, their cold light dazzling. Strange birds emitted blinding divine radiance, traversing between heaven and earth.

The center of the battlefield was like a dense web of interwoven lightning, with experts whose origins were unknown and identities mysterious, all fighting like madmen. High-level beings had already perished.

However, some areas of the battle were somewhat "unusual."

In the mountain forest, Ling Xu, dressed in white, sat on the ground. He broke the mud seal of a wine jar, poured himself a cup, and then tossed the jar to Wei Mo. The latter caught it; for him, the entire jar was equivalent to just a single cup of wine.

The two silently drank, but the long blades and ten-meter-long battle spears in their hands remained gripped, unleashing dazzling "heavenly light" that surged into the night sky.

In another part of the mountains, the tabby cat also sat on the ground with its sword, red mist surging from its blade. The mantis beast was not far away, using its saw-like long blade forearms to hack at the night sky.

…

Qin Ming frowned. He was currently wearing beast-hide clothing, clearly looking like a local young hunter. Why was he being targeted again?

He halted his steps because there were two groups of people in the shadows, one in front and one behind, subtly blocking him.

One group was chasing him from behind, rapidly closing in.

"Qin Ming?" You Liangyun arrived, looking at the tall, slender, and handsome young man before him. His demeanor was indeed outstanding, and You Liangyun's expression was quite complex.

Because it was this very young man who would likely obstruct his path to further advancement.

"Who are you, and what do you want?" Qin Ming asked, gripping his long-handled dark-gold hammer.

You Liangyun looked at him expressionlessly, silent for a moment, then finally said, "You Liangyun of Crimson Cloud City. Someone wants me to test your capabilities. Make your move."

Qin Ming furrowed his brow. What was going on?
At the same time, he vigilantly observed the other four individuals. Their weapons were quite heavy, but not excessively so, suggesting they were likely second-stage awakened individuals.

"Come on!"

You Liangyun, grasping his incredibly valuable sharp sword, took the initiative to attack, carving a dazzling sword light in the dim mountain forest.

*Clang!*
The next moment, he felt a slight pain in his hand, a little numb, and the sword, as clear as autumn water, nearly flew out of his grasp.

Qin Ming said nothing. As a first-stage awakened individual, his opponent's strength was decent, estimated to be capable of wielding a cauldron weighing over 600 catties.

Undoubtedly, Qin Ming hadn't unleashed his full power; he was holding back, primarily keeping an eye on the other few second-stage awakened individuals.

You Liangyun attacked again, but after his long sword was parried three times in a row, his right hand trembled slightly. He sighed dejectedly and retreated.

"My strength is inferior to yours, and my speed is also lacking. I'm certainly no match for you," he said forlornly, slinging his longsword onto his back. "Someone will likely seek you out soon. I'm leaving."

"I won, and it seems to have affected you?" Qin Ming asked.

"If I'm defeated by you, I'll lose the qualification to stay by that noble person's side. You will replace me," You Liangyun replied.

"Then where will you go?" Qin Ming asked, frowning.

"What else can I do? Since I can't strive for further advancement, I can only go home and inherit my noble title," You Liangyun said, leading his people away.

Qin Ming had originally wanted to say something else, but upon hearing his last words, he swallowed everything he was about to say.

"Brother You's character is indeed up to par. It's just a pity that if you lose, you can only return to Crimson Cloud City," Qi Huai'en emerged from the forest.

You Liangyun, who was about to depart, stopped and turned around.

"That noble person also sent me to take a look. I'll test his capabilities," Qi Huai'en drew a long blade, then walked towards Qin Ming with a faint smile.

A harsh metallic screeching sound erupted. Qi Huai'en made three consecutive slashes, then withdrew his hand. He shook his head and said, "What a pity, still a bit lacking. He doesn't meet that noble person's requirements."

"Even that's not enough?" You Liangyun was surprised.

"Indeed, the noble person is looking for an alternate candidate. He's still a bit short. Let's go," Qi Huai'en left with him.

Qin Ming felt bewildered. If he hadn't been wary of others secretly observing, he would have unleashed his full power long ago. Was this Qi Huai'en really that strong? What right did he have to evaluate him like that?

Qi Huai'en, walking away with You Liangyun, pondered to himself. Although he was holding back in their exchange, he could still sense the extraordinary nature of that young man who had only awakened once. At the very least, he could wield a cauldron weighing 800 catties. He was truly formidable.

"Hm? There's fighting," You Liangyun turned his head.

Qi Huai'en said, "You two go back first. I'll go check. The mountains are chaotic now. If he dies at someone else's hands, and that noble person ends up suspecting you, that wouldn't be good."

"I'll bring people and go with you," You Liangyun said.

Qi Huai'en shook his head, "My strength far surpasses ordinary second-stage awakened individuals. You won't be able to help. If there's danger, you'd likely just sacrifice your lives for nothing. Go see that noble person. Perhaps if your character passes, she might change her mind."

"Alright," You Liangyun left with his people.

Qi Huai'en, with his well-proportioned and taller-than-average physique, moved swiftly through the mountain forest like a tiger or leopard, quickly arriving at the scene.

He was quite surprised, looking at the several people in the field. "You still haven't dealt with him?"

Qin Ming, holding his long-handled dark-gold hammer, faced another group of people who had emerged from the mountain forest. Now he confirmed there were no others lurking in the shadows.

He looked at Qi Huai'en. "You Liangyun didn't intend to kill me, but you, on the other hand, want to eliminate me?"

Around him were six people, surrounding him, their faces filled with killing intent. They had briefly clashed just moments ago.

"So what if I do?" Qi Huai'en's face was calm as he spoke indifferently.

Qin Ming hurled his hammer, instantly smashing the head of the person in front of him, then snatched the spear from the dying man's hand. With terrifying speed, he lunged forward. *Puff!* He pierced another person, blood splattering, and held the man aloft with a single arm, impaled on the spear.
