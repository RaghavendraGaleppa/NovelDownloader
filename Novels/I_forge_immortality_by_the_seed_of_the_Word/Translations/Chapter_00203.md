**Chapter 200: Deer Thirty-Eight's Human Transformation**

Within the Crimson Bright Grand Luminous Grotto-Heaven.

A bronze divine light flashed across the sky, then quietly landed on the edge of a certain immortal island above.

The immortal light gradually dissipated, revealing the figures of Zhang Jing and Feng Wuyu.

Standing in place, their gazes swept over the small peach tree in the distance, which was shrouded in three-colored spiritual light and exuded vibrant vitality.

"Tsk, a Three-Glow Peento Peach Tree. Junior Brother, what a stroke of luck. It seems your white deer has inherited quite a bit from the Nine-Colored Deer. Otherwise, with the demanding environmental requirements of such an immortal root, its growth on the immortal island would absolutely not be this good." Feng Wuyu commented with keen interest.

"I must also thank Senior Brother for bringing Thirty-Eight along back then. Otherwise, even with its Nine-Colored Deer bloodline, it would have toiled in vain in the lower realm for its entire life." Zhang Jing's words carried genuine gratitude.

If not for his senior brother's suggestion back then, he wouldn't have considered bringing Deer Thirty-Eight to the upper realm. Other reasons were secondary; primarily, he didn't have the capability himself.

"Haha, it was nothing but a minor effort." Feng Wuyu waved his hand nonchalantly.

Then, he seemed to recall something, and his expression suddenly turned serious. "Oh, right, I almost forgot to remind Junior Brother."

"Master's true body will be returning to the Dao Sect soon. Junior Brother, you should wait quietly on the Grotto-Heaven immortal island during this time and not wander too far. If anything comes up, just send me a message."

"Junior Brother understands." Zhang Jing replied respectfully.

Wait! A message? It seemed that communication methods were only used when the two parties were far apart. He couldn't help but look directly at Feng Wuyu opposite him. "Senior Brother, you've finally returned for a visit, aren't you going to stay in the Grotto-Heaven for a while longer?"

Hearing this, Feng Wuyu's expression froze, as if he hadn't expected Zhang Jing to suddenly ask such a question. He fell silent for a moment, as if organizing his thoughts.

The next moment, Feng Wuyu gently explained, "Junior Brother, it's like this. The Crimson Bright Grand Luminous Grotto-Heaven is, after all, Master's Dao abode, permeated everywhere by His Dao. You might not perceive it, but for Dao Integration Realm cultivators like myself, it's glaringly obvious."

"And due to the unique nature of the Dao Integration Realm, we rarely cultivate within Grotto-Heavens unless absolutely necessary."

"Then, Senior Brother, you—" Zhang Jing hesitated.

"Haha, Senior Brother has his own Dao abode, right on Golden Rooster Mountain's Azure Spirit Palace in the Eastern Extreme Immortal Continent of the Clear Firmament Profound Brilliance Heaven."

"Once this matter is concluded, Junior Brother can come and visit. Senior Brother can also help you select a prime spiritual land to prepare for establishing your own Dao abode." Feng Wuyu said with a light chuckle. "Anyway, the Clear Firmament Profound Brilliance Heaven has five continents, four seas, and two marshes, with a vast and boundless territory and countless places of spiritual essence. There's bound to be a place that satisfies Junior Brother."

"This is also our..."

***

Time slowly flowed by. Feng Wuyu's figure had long since disappeared. Only Zhang Jing remained. He walked slowly forward, deep in thought.

Grand Unity Ancestral Court! Acting Sect Master Ancestral Grandmaster! Duty-Bound True Monarch!

"So, after Dao Sect disciples advance to the Dao Integration Realm, they can choose a spiritual land in the Clear Firmament Profound Brilliance Heaven and establish their own Dao abode?"

"And the Dao abodes of many strong cultivators of the Dao Sect are distributed throughout the vast and boundless Clear Firmament Profound Brilliance Heaven. The various Dharma Realms and Blessed Lands came into being this way."

Zhang Jing recalled his senior brother's introduction. He suddenly understood. He had always wondered why, after entering the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect for over thirty years, he had never seen the specific location of the Dao Sect itself.

So it turned out that apart from an Ancestral Court, the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect had nothing else. Or perhaps, the entire Clear Firmament Profound Brilliance Heaven, and perhaps even the Flowing Light Immortal Realm, served as the sect's headquarters.

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered. "True Disciples inherently have the qualification to establish their own Dao abodes... Should I move out of Master's Grotto-Heaven when the time comes?" He was somewhat conflicted.

***

Lost in thought, Zhang Jing unconsciously walked to the outer perimeter of the palace.

Beside the spiritual spring not far ahead, the Three-Glow Peento Peach Tree was lush and dripping with vitality. Further away, in the Life-Return Spring, there were now five drops of Life-Return Spirit Liquid, resembling white jade pearls.

"How could I have imagined, before I left, that this trip would last five years?" A trace of melancholy flashed across Zhang Jing's face.

Wait! Where's Deer Thirty-Eight? He only then noticed that there were no signs of Deer Thirty-Eight's iconic large footprints on the surrounding ground. Not a single one!

Just as he was puzzled, a somewhat large boy with a simple face and silver-white hair and brows quietly peeked his big head out from inside the palace. His two eyes stared unblinkingly at Zhang Jing, filled with excitement. He had just stepped out with one foot, but then seemed to realize something and sheepishly pulled it back.

"Deer Thirty-Eight?" Zhang Jing called out softly, a little uncertain as he looked at the silver-haired boy.

From behind the door, upon hearing his Master's familiar voice, Deer Thirty-Eight trembled. Then, without a moment's hesitation, he scurried out on his short legs and trotted towards Zhang Jing.

"Mas... Master, you've finally returned."

Standing before Zhang Jing, Deer Thirty-Eight tilted his head up and spoke in a childish voice. His eyes were filled with intense excitement, and a trace of imperceptible apprehension.

"Your cultivation?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise. Only then did he realize that the Deer Thirty-Eight before him had astonishingly broken through to the Golden Core Realm. He figured that the ability to transform into human form was also due to this breakthrough in cultivation.

At this moment, a hint of awkwardness flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. His cultivation had actually been surpassed by his mount... Although this was his own choice. After all, if he had ignored everything else and focused solely on improving his realm, he would have broken through to the Golden Core Realm long ago. Why would he still be at Foundation Establishment now?

Of course, the spiritual spring on the immortal island certainly contributed significantly to Deer Thirty-Eight's rapid cultivation advancement to the Golden Core Realm.

Opposite him, with a *thump*, Deer Thirty-Eight suddenly knelt before Zhang Jing, hugging his leg and wailing loudly, "Master, I didn't mean to break through to the Golden Core Realm before you. It's just that... my cultivation couldn't be held back anymore. I beg Master for punishment, I'll have no complaints whatsoever."

"So, that's what you were worried about just now?"

"Am I that kind of person, Thirty-Eight?" Zhang Jing asked, a mix of amusement and exasperation on his face.

"Oh, right, Thirty-Eight, after you advanced to the Golden Core Realm, you must have awakened a bloodline divine ability, right?" He seemed to realize something and asked curiously.

As his voice fell, Zhang Jing bent down. With one hand, he easily pulled Deer Thirty-Eight, who barely reached his chest, back to his feet.

"I didn't expect Deer Thirty-Eight to be so different in human form compared to his original body." A slight smile tugged at his lips.

"Master, you're really not going to punish me? If not, how about scolding me a bit?" The helped-up Deer Thirty-Eight's eyes widened instantly upon hearing this, and he cried out in disbelief.

"Why should I punish you? Are you itching for a beating?"

"Or do you think, in your heart, that I'm such a petty person?" Zhang Jing confirmed with a nod, looking at the other's expectant gaze, and said in an exasperated tone.

"Hehe~" Deer Thirty-Eight rubbed his large head with a small hand, letting out a silly laugh, trying to muddle through.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing shook his head helplessly.

But just then, Deer Thirty-Eight, who had been feigning foolishness, suddenly remembered Zhang Jing's earlier question. Without any concealment, he replied, "Reporting to Master, when I advanced to the Golden Core Realm, I indeed awakened a bloodline divine ability called 'Natural Marvelous Birth Embryonic Realm'!"
