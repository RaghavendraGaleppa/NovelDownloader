# Chapter 331: The Gift of Growing Up (1/2)

Whoosh—

The wind suddenly seemed to pick up. The lanterns outside the tent swayed, making the light filtering through the canvas even more hazy.

"Lie down properly."

"I'm lying down."

"Will that press on your wound?"

"It doesn't hurt."

Little Li had just suffered a blow so devastating it shattered his defenses. This was evident from the way he was lying on his side, curled up like a shrimp.

What do you do when you're injured?

Of course, you drink medicine.

It was strange. The medicine didn't taste bitter anymore. Li Mo drank it all down with a straight face; he could even drink three more big bowls if offered.

It had to be said, the military physician of the Qingmu Camp was quite skilled. Although the physician came from the Central Plains, his medical skills were already superb. He had an in-depth understanding of various medicinal herbs and had even made some localized modifications to nourishing herbs. For example, the Qiong Lotus Seeds, which weren't available locally, were replaced with a type of fungus with even better medicinal properties.

What was it called... Probiotics?

Just from the name, you knew it was good for your health.

Even the "Thousand-Enemy" Little Li couldn't help but remark that with such a physician in the Qingmu Camp, there was no need to worry about the soldiers' health. He suggested the physician form a strategic partnership with Hu-zi's grandfather, so his prescriptions would be flawless...

"Gulp, gulp..."

Li Mo finished the last of his medicine and looked at the Ice Cube.

"Thank you."

"Mm, feeding you medicine is only natural, after all..."

"I'm talking about the gift."

"What gift?"

Ying Bing pursed her lips, her gaze shifting elsewhere. It was unclear what she was looking at. After setting down the porcelain bowl with her slender hand, she hid it back inside her sleeve.

The Ice Cube looked utterly confused.

"......"

Li Mo looked at her lips.

They were moist and shimmering in the flickering lamplight.

*Couldn't she just wipe them?*

He had always thought that the Ice Cube before him was like a stunningly beautiful yet aloof cat. Now, this aloof cat had just secretly eaten something delicious and was pretending nothing had happened with a completely straight face.

"Ice Cube, you're strange."

"What's strange?"

"Is there anything that looks hard but isn't like that when you eat it?"

The "gentleman" Little Li asked with a perfectly serious expression.

"I don't know."

So it turns out that even the Cold Immortal, who could strategize and wield martial arts skills that were as unpredictable as gods and ghosts, had things she didn't know.

The medicine needed to be taken three times a day.

She held the medicine jar and sat by the fire again, adding herbs to it, resting her chin on her hand as she gazed at the flickering flames.

Ying Bing remained silent.

Li Mo watched her, licking his lips which still carried a hint of sweetness.

The Ice Cube had really learned to be bad.

Just a moment ago, she had pinched her nose. If she pinched her nose, she could only breathe through her mouth, right?

And now she was even feigning ignorance.

But to be fair.

Little Li himself felt it was dreamlike. If not for the candy still in his mouth, he would have thought it was all a dream.

Recalling his time with Ying Bing in Yunzhou by the Magpie Bridge Lake, his mind had been filled with wild fantasies.

That was why, after hitting his head at the Empty Mountain Temple, he had replayed the scene in his mind and thought about how he should make a move to turn the tables.

He never expected it to happen like this.

The bad Ice Cube took advantage of his injury and helplessness, fed him candy, and still called him "stinky younger brother."

Our Little Li never loses to anyone. Next time, he'll definitely get his revenge!

"How are you feeling?"

"My body feels a bit itchy."

Li Mo moved with some difficulty, rubbing his back against the bed board. This was probably the effect of the medicine, its power spreading to his limbs.

That meant he was recovering.

*Crackle, pop—*

Another copper pot was placed over the charcoal fire, boiling water inside.

"Is it here?"

"A little higher up... *hiss*..."

"Does it hurt?"

---

"No, it's just... right here, it's really itchy."

Ahem, this wasn't just scratching an itch. Ying Bing was also using her true energy to unblock his meridians, promoting the absorption of the medicine's effects.

Time passed quietly, and soon the hot water was ready.

"We probably won't make it home for the Winter Solstice. Should we make some dumplings?"

Li Mo was just turning over.

He saw that the silk socks made of pearl-white lotus silk were folded and set aside. A delicate toe tested the water temperature on the copper basin before gently dipping in.

The small yet slender foot gently stepped on itself.

After soaking for a while, it was lifted out, adorned with glistening droplets of water.

"You know how to make dumplings too?"

Ying Bing unscrewed the "Big-Head Doll"—a storage artifact—and took out another pair of socks. Then she frowned, feeling the style wasn't quite right, and changed them for another pair.

It was all thanks to a certain "gentleman."

The Big-Head Doll was full of local Southern Frontier styles...

And they were all stacked, so you couldn't tell what they looked like until you took them out.

"The dumplings I make are delicious, just thinking about them makes my mouth water."

"Mm... what filling?"

"Lotus root... dicing would be pretty good."

Li Mo snapped back to his senses.

"Cabbage? Beef?"

Ying Bing asked casually. She remembered that for Winter Solstice in the past, her uncle and aunt would make香菇 pork and celery beef dumplings.

"Ice Cube, don't change them, these are fine."

"It's not difficult to make a few more kinds..."

Ying Bing's long legs were crossed diagonally.

"No, I'm talking about the socks."

"?"

Ying Bing closed the Big-Head Doll, gave up on wearing the socks, and silently slipped her feet into her boots.

"Let's rest here for a while. You need to rest quietly. You can't stir up your blood and qi, and it's not suitable for you to go out."

"I didn't stir up my blood and qi."

Li Mo's hands weren't even listening to him anymore because he couldn't use any strength, so he said this with great confidence.

Ying Bing's eyes were profound:

"But you have a chronic condition of high blood pressure."

"......"

Li Mo frowned. Why was this medicine so heat-inducing?

Could it be an overdose?

Ying Bing walked to the entrance of the large tent and lifted the curtain. The cold wind from outside immediately blew in, and a few mischievous snowflakes landed in her black hair.

She suddenly turned back and said softly:

"Childish."

"?"

Little Li was a bit unconvinced.

"That candy was a reward for growing up."

Hearing this, Li Mo watched her walk into the wind and snow and couldn't help but fall into deep thought, licking the corner of his mouth where the sweetness seemed to linger.

A reward for growing up?

What if he grew up a bit more?

And Ice Cube, you... do you have to be so cool? Saying that so coolly and then just leaving...

Little Li didn't know.

In an instant, Ying Bing had returned to the Jiawei Tavern. She brewed a cup of tea but held it in her palms without drinking. She stared blankly at the tea's surface, at her own lips, which were so red they seemed about to drip.

Even her fingers were curled up, and her fingertips tingled with electric shocks, making it impossible to straighten them.

At the same time, she felt a bit of relief.

Fortunately, fortunately, his injury wasn't healed yet.

She had seen it clearly in his eyes at that moment. If he had even a bit of strength, his arms would have wrapped around her waist. His strength was so great...

It was too much.

It couldn't be like this, at least not now...

[Host, you have a First Place Reward to claim!]

[Host!]

[You have a!! First Place Reward!!! to claim!]

Ying Bing was called several times before she snapped back to reality.
