# Chapter 9: The Fall of a Hero

Their eyes met for three seconds.

Lin Shan slowly drew his ring-pommeled sword. Outside, a black-clad man approached the convoy with his blade drawn. Just as he was about to reach it, he suddenly noticed someone hiding beneath the carriage.

The black-clad man halted, glancing around. Seeing no allies nearby to assist him—

"My apologies."

Without finishing his sentence, he turned and left, chasing after another target.

"?!"

Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel at the harsh reality of the martial world. Everyone only had one life, and even bandits cherished theirs dearly.

He turned to look at Master Pu, the old man hiding under the carriage, who seemed completely oblivious that a crisis had just passed. The old man was still watching Chief Escort Wang's battle.

"Why does it feel like there are hardly any of our escorts on the field?"

As Lin Shan observed, he noticed something amiss. Most of the laborers and porters on the field were ordinary people, while Chief Escort Wang had over a dozen trained escorts under his command!

At the very least, every escort was a martial artist who had reached the Huanqi stage of the Houtian realm. Veterans like Master Pu had even reached the Lianzang stage.

Though the black-clad men were all martial artists, their side had over a dozen trained fighters. With so many strong men backing them up, they should have been able to put up a fight.

"You're still too green, kid! The bandits have been lying in wait, conserving their strength. After the rain of arrows, they charged at us with full momentum. These men outside are just here to wear down that initial ferocity.

When the time is right, the escorts will strike, turning the tables so that we become the ones lying in wait. The roles of attacker and defender will reverse."

Master Pu lectured with the air of an old hand.

Lin Shan wanted to argue—weren't they toying with people's lives? But he held his tongue. These laborers and porters, who relied on the escort agency for their livelihood, spent their days feeding and tending to the horses and doing odd jobs. When danger struck, they became cannon fodder.

Alone, he could only mourn silently for them. He couldn't change their fate.

This world was one where the strong preyed on the weak. The weak had no right to survive.

The escorts considered their lives more valuable than those of the laborers. To secure victory, they'd rather others die than themselves. After all, ordinary men could always be replaced—there were plenty to go around. Every escort had clawed their way up from being an ordinary person, surviving countless life-and-death struggles.

...

When more than half of the laborers had fallen, the time was ripe. A whistling arrow shot into the sky in the distance—likely a signal among the escorts. Master Pu kicked Lin Shan out from under the carriage.

"Attack!"

Lin Shan: "???"

He didn't mind joining the fight, but was kicking him really necessary?

Lin Shan guessed the old man was worried he'd stay back out of fear, so he forced him into the fray. There was no time to dwell on it—a black-clad man with a scarred face was already walking toward him.

The man had clearly killed many; his blade was chipped, and blood dripped from its tip. His face mask was gone, revealing a scar that twisted grotesquely when he grinned.

"Gulp."

Lin Shan's throat tightened. This was his first real fight, and his nerves were frayed. His mind was a jumble—the "Gentle Breeze Swordplay" he'd practiced countless times was suddenly nowhere to be found in his memory.

The scarred man had no idea what Lin Shan was thinking. It had been a while since he'd seen such a fresh-faced youngster, and he charged forward excitedly, swinging his blade down with a fierce slash!

Lin Shan had no time to think. Instinctively, he raised his ring-pommeled sword to block.

"Clang!"

Their blades met, and Lin Shan felt his hands go numb. His wrists throbbed as if struck by a hammer—it was as though his opponent wasn't a man but a ferocious bear.

At the same time, a domineering force surged through the blade into his body, attempting to ravage his meridians and bones.

"Hidden force?"

Lin Shan was inwardly alarmed. Hidden force was a technique unique to the second stage of the Houtian realm, Lianzang. Yet the scarred man before him was clearly still in the Huanqi stage, just like him. It seemed the man was on the cusp of breaking through, having already grasped the basics of hidden force.

Fortunately, Lin Shan cultivated an innate technique. Though his Evergreen True Qi was gentle, it didn't hesitate to surround and swiftly neutralize the invading energy.

"Huh?"

The scarred man let out a surprised grunt, taken aback that Lin Shan had dispelled his hidden force. Without wasting words, he pressed forward again.

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

In an instant, they exchanged dozens of blows. Lin Shan barely held his ground. His opponent was not only strong but also lethally precise—a seasoned veteran who had spent years honing his skills in the Huanqi stage. His techniques and experience far surpassed Lin Shan's, repeatedly driving him to the brink.

Though Lin Shan had also reached the Huanqi stage, he was still a novice martial artist with no real combat experience. If not for the deep reserves of his innate technique, he would have fallen long ago against such a ruthless opponent.

The scarred man eyed Lin Shan with renewed surprise. This delicate-looking youth shouldn't have been able to hold his own, yet here he was, trading blows evenly. His True Qi seemed inexhaustible—truly extraordinary.

But how long could he last?

Seeing himself at a disadvantage, Lin Shan narrowed his eyes. He knew his combat experience was lacking, but his innate True Qi surpassed his opponent's in both quality and recovery. If he could drag this out, he might just wear the man down through sheer endurance.

The scarred man seemed to guess his plan and intensified his attacks, even resorting to reckless, life-risking strikes!

"What kind of madman is this? Going all out from the start?"

Lin Shan dodged hastily. He had no intention of trading injuries with this man. Those who lived by the blade were ruthless to others—and even more so to themselves. If he tried to match that ferocity, even if he survived by some miracle, how would he fare against the remaining enemies?

Their figures darted and weaved, their blades flashing like streaks of white light. Sparks flew when steel met steel, and the howling wind carried the sound of their relentless clash. Both were soon panting heavily, their stamina draining fast.

Seizing an opening as Lin Shan dodged, the scarred man delivered a bizarre, almost miraculous slash from an impossible angle! The chipped edge of the blade gleamed in Lin Shan's widening pupils as he barely managed to parry the strike.

"Clang!"

The scarred man was mildly disappointed his surprise attack had failed, but he remained confident. Through their exchange, he'd realized Lin Shan was a complete novice who didn't even know basic swordplay—he'd been led by the nose the entire time.

Yet the kid's technique was bafflingly resilient, like a cockroach that refused to die. It was starting to grate on his nerves, stirring an inexplicable frustration.

Meanwhile, Lin Shan was gradually adapting to the fight. His innate technique's endurance kept him standing, and he'd discovered his opponent's fatal weakness—his chipped weapon.

In their frequent clashes, Lin Shan deliberately targeted the damaged edge, feigning weakness to lull the scarred man into a false sense of dominance. He bided his time until his plan bore fruit.

"Clang—"

Another exchange sent them reeling apart.

"Clatter!"

Half a blade clattered to the ground.

Both leaped back, checking whose weapon had broken.

The scarred man stared blankly at his shattered sword. In the heat of battle, he'd forgotten his blade was already damaged. Locking blades with another martial artist had been the final straw.

His weapon was done for.

Lin Shan blinked in surprise. His spur-of-the-moment idea had actually worked! Elation surged through him.

Strike while the iron is hot!

His ring-pommeled sword suddenly felt light as a feather, and the "Gentle Breeze Swordplay" flooded back into his mind.

The scarred man, ever the veteran, tossed his broken blade aside and rolled away, searching the ground for another weapon.

Lin Shan gave him no quarter, chasing him down with relentless slashes. The tables had turned, and he reveled in the momentum. His wild, unrestrained swings became a whirlwind of steel, leaving his opponent no room to counter.

The scarred man scrambled in the dirt, covered in grime and nearly coughing up blood in frustration. Several times, he almost grabbed weapons from nearby corpses, only for Lin Shan to drive him back with a slash.

Their chase-and-dodge went on so long that Lin Shan couldn't help but admire the man's unshakable nerves. No wonder he was a bandit—even in mortal danger, he avoided every lethal strike.

Amid their fierce duel, a distant roar echoed through the battlefield.

"You've lost!"

Lin Shan glanced sideways to see Chief Escort Wang, fifty paces away, sent flying by the black-clad leader. The chief landed hard, disheveled, and struggled to his feet, using his spear for support.

His chest was drenched in blood, and crimson trickled from his lips.

His opponent, the black-clad leader, stood tall and composed, his robes only slightly torn.

Anyone could see Chief Escort Wang was done for. The tide had turned.

The escorts and bandits had been evenly matched, both sides fighting desperately while awaiting the outcome of the high-level duel. The escorts had pinned their hopes on Chief Escort Wang, a first-rate expert, to turn the tide by defeating the enemy leader.

Instead, the chief was now on the verge of collapse. Once the black-clad leader was free, none of them would survive!

For a moment, everyone on the battlefield paused to weigh their options.

Faced with certain death, no one was willing to wait around.

The seasoned escorts, well-traveled and experienced, knew exactly what to do next.

In an instant, over a dozen figures disengaged and scattered like startled birds.

Watching this, the disheveled Chief Escort Wang let out a bitter laugh.

"Fine! Brothers, go your separate ways! If any of you make it back alive, tell the boss this for me—I repay his kindness with my life!"

His booming voice echoed through the valley. With his last strength, he raised his spear and charged at his foe.

Meanwhile, in their own battle, the scarred man—who'd been struggling to survive under Lin Shan's onslaught—finally found a steel blade and sprang to his feet, looking around.

"Huh? Where'd he go?"

...

Lin Shan had already abandoned the fight the moment the others fled, wisely following the crowd into the forested hills. Hearing Chief Escort Wang's final cry, a pang of sorrow struck him. A first-rate martial hero had fallen silently in a foreign land.

Even in the prestigious Lin family of Qinghe County, first-rate experts could be counted on one hand. Losing one was a devastating blow.

"The world is a tide, and men are but drops; how few return from the rivers and lakes!"

As he lamented, he spotted a figure running even faster than him. The fleeing silhouette looked increasingly familiar the more he stared.

"Master Pu!"

The old man, focused solely on escape, glanced back and cursed under his breath. The damn kid was sharp—he'd latched onto him like a leech!

"Keep up, brat!" he snapped without stopping.

...

The valley was littered with corpses.

Chief Escort Wang knelt on the ground, his own spear impaling him through the chest. Blood dripped steadily—he had been dead for some time.

The black-clad leader sat cross-legged nearby, meditating to recover his energy.

"Elder, the battlefield has been cleared."

A black-clad subordinate approached to report, eyeing the fallen chief with awe. A first-rate expert of the martial world had died just like that, never knowing who had truly doomed him. If he had known the truth, perhaps—

"You have two hours. By then, return with these carriages to Yongchang County before sunset. No delays!"

The leader, addressed as "Elder," didn't even open his eyes, still focused on replenishing his energy.

The bandits in the valley cheered, "The Elder is wise!" After looting the corpses of valuables, they eagerly split into groups and gave chase into the mountains.

After all, murder and arson lined one's pockets. Who wouldn't want extra spoils? Two hours was more than enough.
