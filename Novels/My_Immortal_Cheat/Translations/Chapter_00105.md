**Chapter 105: Cross-Dressing Master**

"Mu Su, I can't believe you'd collude with an evil god!"

From within the ranks of the Holy Spirit Sect, a sharp cry rang out. A maiden in white robes stared wide-eyed at Mu Su.

Mu Su sidestepped a cleaving blow. Looking at the Holy Maiden he had escorted all this way, a furious urge to curse surged within him. *I told you not to bother with that dead weight, but you insisted. Now something's happened, and you're the one saying I'm in league with an evil god. Are you out of your mind?!*

The more Mu Su thought about it, the angrier he became. He'd never realized this girl could be so utterly foolish.

Zhang Yi couldn't help but chuckle, seeing the aggrieved expression on his friend's face. Rune arrays spread from beneath his feet, enveloping this small area. No matter how the Holy Spirit Sect Knights attacked, they couldn't touch him. He knew their escape today didn't depend on them, but on the outcome of the battle between the two grandmasters above. There was no need to waste so much energy clearing out these fodder troops.

"My friend, since you've boarded Zhou Tian's pirate ship, don't even think about getting off. Holding back now would be incredibly foolish."

Mu Su's movements paused slightly. He used his sword hilt to send a nearby person flying. "Zhou Tian? So that dead weight's name is Zhou Tian."

Zhang Yi rubbed his nose. Uh... it seemed Zhou Tian had really shafted him quite badly; he hadn't even told the guy his real name yet.

Perched on the roof of a house not far from the central cathedral was Zhou Tian, who had long since arrived at the battlefield, his gaze fixed intently on the direction of the fight. He had arrived in Seiler City much earlier than the Ash Cult, but had refrained from intervening in the battle.

He glanced in Zhang Yi and Mu Su's direction. Zhang Yi, a disciple of the Imperial Advisor, possessed various divine abilities, far beyond the incomplete inheritances of the Holy Spirit Sect's fodder troops. A few casual divine arts were enough for him to handle the current situation. Mu Su, on the other hand, was having a much harder time. He was mostly engaging in close-quarters combat and still holding back from lethal blows. If not for Zhang Yi's occasional support, he would have long since been finished. However, the high-end combatants had all gone to intercept the members of the Ash Cult, so for the time being, their lives weren't in immediate danger.

The battle on the Ash Cult's side, however, was far more spectacular. Crimson flames and holy light filled the sky. The Ash Cult had truly sent out all their elites for their Divine Son; all three Bishops had arrived. After all, this was a Divine Son, possibly the only one to appear in the entire God-Forsaken Land so far. But this was the Holy Spirit Sect's home turf. Even as the Ash Cult pushed forward regardless of casualties, they remained stuck. The three Bishops were being suppressed by Bor and the various Holy Knight leaders, but they were barely managing to delay them, preventing them from intervening in the battle between Anduin and the Holy Spirit Sect Pontiff. He wondered how that half a spearhead could make Anduin burst out of his clothes. He was practically like a mad bull, completely different from the person he'd seen in the cage.

However, the Holy Spirit Sect Pontiff was also quite formidable, fighting Anduin to a standstill, even subtly gaining the upper hand.

After analyzing the battle situation, Zhou Tian decided to intervene. Locking onto the Pontiff in the air, five fireballs suddenly appeared and shot towards him. The Pontiff frowned. His body blurred, dodging the fireballs. *How could anyone use such an idiotic divine ability to launch a sneak attack on him?*

Zhou Tian's figure flickered, appearing beneath Anduin, and he shouted, "Use your ultimate move directly! Retreat quickly before complications arise! I'll help you!"

Anduin nodded. Zhou Tian was exactly who he had been waiting for. He opened his mouth and spat out a ball of flame, which transformed into a fire dragon and swept forth. He then retreated backward, the Ash Spear in his hand radiating divine light. It reverted to its half-spearhead state, floating at his forehead, with streams of crimson divine light shooting into his brow. Anduin's entire body glowed brilliantly, and his physique continuously expanded. In just a moment, he had swelled to several hundred zhang. The ground beneath him all turned into lava, making him almost comparable to a true ancient demon god.

"A true god has descended!" Saman's face was flushed. Although his body already bore multiple wounds, seeing Anduin transform into a demon god was like being fully resurrected, and his combat power soared.

"Die, insects!" Anduin roared. His wings vibrated behind him, stirring up clouds of smoke and dust as flames erupted. Nearby houses were all scorched, with only the central cathedral enveloped by a thin white protective barrier, spared from the disaster.

Zhou Tian had already left the spot when Anduin retreated. The Pontiff gave Zhou Tian a deep look. He had seen images of Zhou Tian and knew this person before him was the one who had escaped from the Tribunal. But at this moment, Anduin's threat was paramount.

Endless holy light rose from his body. Behind him, a phantom image appeared above the grand cathedral, bathed in radiant light.

"Hammer of Judgment!"

The Pontiff spread his hands. Endless holy light gathered in the air, forming a colossal hammer, entirely white, its head pointing downwards. It carried a potent power of judgment as it smashed directly towards the giant that Anduin had become.

*This is exactly the ultimate move I've been waiting for!* Zhou Tian's eyes sparkled. He appeared beneath the giant white hammer. The moment the hammer touched his body, it vanished, having been sealed away by him. Anduin, who had been preparing to resist, was slightly stunned by this scene. He hadn't expected his ally to be so powerful, directly devouring the opponent's ultimate move.

However, his own movements weren't slow. Endless flames spewed forth, forming a long flaming spear as tall as himself. Since the fragmented spearhead of the Ash Spear was currently providing energy to the divine blood within Anduin's body, he couldn't use the Ash Spear at this moment. He swung the long spear. The Pontiff raised his sword to counter, but was sent flying. In this state, Anduin was even stronger than before.

Stabilizing his figure in mid-air, the Pontiff lightly wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth and sighed, "If my Lord were to know that we've been bullied to our very doorstep by an evil god, He would surely be very disappointed in us."

Hearing the Pontiff's words, Zhou Tian couldn't help but let out a snort of laughter. "You're trying to become a god yourself and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your Lord in the heavens. Do you still care if He's disappointed?"

The Holy Spirit Sect Pontiff glanced at Zhou Tian and replied quite seriously, "You wouldn't understand."

*I wouldn't understand?* Zhou Tian was speechless. A double-crosser is a double-crosser; always spouting such nonsense.

While Zhou Tian was bickering with the opponent, Anduin wasn't idle. He unleashed his destructive power without restraint, savagely thrusting his thick spear towards the Pontiff, aiming to pin him to the ground. The Pontiff's expression remained unchanged. He pulled out a feather wing shimmering with a faint white light and gripped it tightly.

Boom!

Feathers drifted down from the sky, holy light illuminated the heavens, and hymns echoed through the void. Light enveloped the Pontiff, resisting Anduin's long spear. When the light dissipated, the person within had changed. The Pontiff was gone, replaced by a holy woman with a pair of white wings on her back, clad in feathered robes. Her eyes were bright and crystalline, her black hair draped over her shoulders, appearing utterly divine.

"A cross-dressing master?" Zhou Tian's face was full of a strange expression. The Holy Spirit Sect even had such a divine ability? *Perhaps believing in the Holy Spirit Sect wouldn't be a bad...* *cough* *cough*... *Such an evil cult deserves to be eradicated!*
