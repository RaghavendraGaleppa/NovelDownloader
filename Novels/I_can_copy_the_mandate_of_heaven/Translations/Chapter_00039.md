# 39, Bestowal of Position

"Greetings, Doctor Li!"

The sound reverberated through the night, startling a flock of crows from the inky forest in the distance. The cloud cover, a canvas of black ink, was sparsely streaked with pale white, remaining motionless. The cold mountains formed a frigid backdrop, bathed in the serene glow of the moon. The address momentarily startled Li Zhiming, but he returned the bow respectfully, remaining still.

Rising to his feet, Meng Weizhi wore a warm smile. "From this day forward, Little Doctor Li will replace Doctor Mo in this valley. Everyone here must show him proper respect!"

Meng Weizhi spoke with earnestness, his sharp eyes sweeping over the crowd with a hint of intimidation. However, was it really necessary for the Sect Leader to repeat the obvious, especially considering that most of those present had just benefited from Little Doctor Li's miraculous healing? They all struggled to their feet, injuries or not, and cupped their fists in salute, responding with a resounding, "Yes!"

The sound echoed through the valley, filled with sincerity and earnestness.

"Little Doctor Li," Meng Weizhi continued, softening his tone as much as possible. He looked at Li Zhiming and Han Li, "All your necessities and provisions will be sent over. If you need anything, just send a message to 'Wind' Mountain. It doesn't matter who delivers it."

Meng Weizhi gestured towards Gao Changdong, indicating that he was from 'Wind' Mountain.

"Once they receive the message, they will take care of it." 'Wind' Mountain was the closest, making it the most convenient place to send messages.

Gao Changdong bowed, acknowledging the instructions.

"Gao Changdong, leave a few men here to be at Little Doctor Li's disposal and to protect his personal safety." Meng Weizhi's expression shifted again as he turned to Gao Changdong, his voice serious. "Increase patrols around the valley. We cannot afford any mistakes!"

"All suspicious individuals must be investigated! No unauthorized personnel are to approach this place!"

"Yes, I will personally oversee it!" Gao Changdong replied, his voice booming.

Li Zhiming listened silently, while Han Li looked at Li Zhiming with envy. It seemed his friend had become incredibly important overnight. Now he was the new doctor, the new master of the medicine valley!

What a transformation!

After giving his instructions, Meng Weizhi turned back to Li Zhiming, striving to make his tone even more gentle and approachable, and his expression earnest, treating Li Zhiming as anything but a child.

This was no easy feat, as many adults were condescending, dismissing a child's abilities based solely on age, forgetting that children grow up.

Such condescension and disrespect would be felt.

Meng Weizhi paid close attention to such details.

"Little Doctor Li, I entrust the lives of the many disciples of my Seven Mysteries Sect to you," Meng Weizhi said sincerely. As he spoke, he unexpectedly unfastened a jade pendant from his waist, an object of obvious value, and handed it to Li Zhiming.

Nearby, the division leaders, including Gao Changdong, looked at Li Zhiming with undisguised envy.

That was the Sect Leader's Seal!

Something they could never hope to obtain! Holding the Sect Leader's Seal meant free passage throughout the entire Seven Mysteries Sect. With the exception of a few extremely secret locations, one could go anywhere they pleased!

Even they didn't possess such a treasure!

"This is my Sect Leader's Seal. With this seal, you can directly enter the main peak of the Seven Mysteries Sect, including all of the Sect's halls, without obstruction."

Yet, it was all very reasonable!

The status of doctors within the Seven Mysteries Sect was such. Doctor Mo had possessed a similar item, allowing him to move freely within the Sect. No one had ever dared to object.

In fact, it was common knowledge within the Seven Mysteries Sect that doctors should enjoy special privileges.

In the Seven Mysteries Sect, anyone who dared to speak ill of Doctor Mo would immediately face the wrath of those around them!

Watching Li Zhiming receive such a jade pendant, they felt only envy, but it was justified!

Li Zhiming looked at the jade pendant, worth at least a hundred taels of silver, adorned with intricate patterns. He reached out with both hands and carefully accepted it. "Thank you, Sect Leader."

Seeing Li Zhiming accept the seal, Meng Weizhi's smile widened. As if afraid that Li Zhiming didn't fully understand its purpose, he continued to explain and reiterate.

"Little Doctor Li, you must take great care of this jade pendant!"

"With this jade pendant, you are free to roam any of the mountain peaks. If you encounter any problems, you can use this token to order division leaders and their subordinates to assist you. If you wish to travel outside, you can also use this token."

"If you encounter danger outside, you can present the Seven Mysteries Sect's Sect Leader's Seal and declare your identity!" Meng Weizhi paused, then chuckled, "As long as you don't run into the Sand Sea Gang, my Seven Mysteries Sect holds considerable sway within an eight-hundred-li radius, and even further."

"Members of the Three Religions and Nine Schools, even the unorthodox sects, must show us respect. Simply presenting this token will be enough to ensure your safe return!"

"However…" Meng Weizhi's tone became even more sincere, "If you do travel outside, please, always have at least a team of people protect you. Little Doctor Li, please don't wander off alone."

Meng Weizhi was being genuine. He wasn't trying to control Li Zhiming; he was truly afraid that the little miracle doctor might wander off and be inadvertently killed by some band of bandits.

Whose loss would that be?!

But what Meng Weizhi didn't know was that the young boy before him had not only inherited Doctor Mo's medical skills but also the forty years of hard-earned martial arts. Although he was still young and his qi and blood were weak, if he were to fight, he would be no pushover!

Unless they were a first-rate expert, no one should think they could capture him.
