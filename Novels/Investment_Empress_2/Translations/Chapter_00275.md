# Chapter 275: The Great Unity of the Demon Race? Stick to the Original Plan!

The churning waters finally settled after the water mist, blasted high into the air by a massive force, had rained down for a long time.

Li Mo put away the essence blood of the Splitting Sea Dragon Whale and was about to return to rescue Guo Jing. However, he discovered that at some point, she had already restored her human form.

Her muscular body was flushed red as she said, "Wu Mo, I knew you still had feelings in your heart..."

"Non-existent."

Ming Xiao, the Little Li, retracted his thoughts and made a gesture of refusal. "For the unity of the demon race, I simply do not wish to abandon any good demon."

"Boss Mo speaks truly!"

Wu Da Meng wanted to clap, but having transformed into his true form, his two claws couldn't meet. Now, whatever Boss Mo said, he would agree with.

Because it was only until just now that he realized just how gentle Little Li had been when beating him—it could even be described as careful...

"Boss, where are we going now?"

"Let me think."

Li Mo put away his hammer and took out a small notebook to flip through. Hmm, perhaps it wouldn't be long before the *Painting of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao* was gone, replaced by the Divine Form of the Great Dao.

Before that, he wanted to thoroughly comprehend this extreme form. Opportunities to capture all seventy-two transformations like this are rare.

He quickly planned his route.

The Sky蛟, Little Li, took Guo Jing and Wu Da Meng and began traversing the waters according to the investment route planned in his little notebook. In terms of time management, Little Li has always been skilled.

Every time, he manages to save the demons at the critical moment. Unfortunately, there are no humans here who participated in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm; otherwise, they would probably find this scene strangely familiar...

"Mo Zhi Qi? Why would a Heavenly Jade summon such a powerful true spirit?!"

"Let go of that female demon!"

Three passing demons descended from the sky. Guo Jing and Wu Da Meng protected the injured, and then, with Li Shifu's few "forty" strikes, they quickly finished the job and hurriedly rushed to the next investment location.

Only the rescued demon was left behind in a daze.

Not to mention the rescued demon, even the demons watching the sky screen and the monks of the Empty Void Temple were first stunned in shock.

After all, our peerless Sky蛟 not only acted in the水域 (Water Domain) but also ran over to the neighboring Fire Domain. Isn't he tired?

Why does he seem to have endless follow-up strength? So enduring!

Being this strong is already exaggerated, but being strong and enduring is simply terrifying!

But gradually, the shocked expressions turned to numbness, and after numbness, they fell into deep thought.

Why?

"Just what is Wu Mo doing... Why is he doing such thankless work?"

"He said he wants all demons to unite and won't abandon any demon. Is that really true?"

"Because... he is kind?"

"My Green Light Eel Clan strongly suspects that he not only has the bloodline of a true dragon but might also have some connection to my Eel Clan..."

"Nonsense, he isn't transformed from an eel."

"My Sky Dog Clan is unconvinced. The way he finds other demons so precisely clearly means he knows how to use our clan's Wind Tracking Technique!"

"Stop arguing! We must unite!"

The Demon Kings and Great Demons were all moved, an unfamiliar emotion surging within their hearts.

The monks of the Empty Void Temple looked at each other.

"Master, what are you looking at?"

Mu Rongxiao, now wearing a monk's robe, asked confusedly.

"Amitabha..."

Heng Yuan sighed and pointed at the statue of the Buddha in the main hall.

"You mean move this Bodhisattva away and let Brother Li sit there?"

Mu Rongxiao offered his understanding.

Heng Yuan: "......"

He meant that although Li Mo is not a Buddhist, he is already performing good deeds, which is also the tenet of their Empty Void Temple.

How did you interpret that as having him sit there as a Bodhisattva?

Is it because you did it yourself?

The old monk had practiced the Silent Meditation for many years, but these past few days, he had a stomach full of complaints to vent, making him feel quite uncomfortable.

"He has come into contact with the Jade Phoenix God, so it is set in stone that he will revert to a true dragon. It wouldn't be impossible for him to become the overlord of the Southern Border demons in the future."

Wu Qing's eyes shone with excitement as she pinched Mu Rongfeng.

Mu Rongfeng smiled weakly, "Yes, we don't need to rush for a second child anymore."

Half-demons are extremely difficult to conceive. How did he manage to succeed in one shot back then...

"Wu Mo is not only powerful and of noble bloodline, but just this boldness and magnanimity alone is the bearing of a true dragon!"

"If he soars through the nine heavens in the future, my Giant Whale Clan is willing to help him out."

The Giant Whale Clan is straightforward in nature, and its members all patted their chests in agreement.

The other demon clans fell silent for a moment.

Suddenly, a bird demon asked, "By the way, what is the Green Luan Goddess doing?"

"Wouldn't she have already reached the foot of the Jade Peak by now? Is she about to get the Heavenly Jade?"

Wu Mo had wasted too much time.

So,

Shang Qin Qing smiled at the monk Huai Kong, "Little monk."

"......"

Monk Huai Kong was silent for a moment, then switched the image on the sky screen.

The next second.

"Hahaha, I knew it."

Shang Qin Qing clapped her hands, jumping and bouncing, not looking like a former Third Rank Demon Saint at all.

Below the sky screen, the woman with a figure like a startled swan and a reflection in the blue mist moved through the void. Wherever she passed, countless true spirit projections shattered.

She didn't immediately go to take the Heavenly Jade after getting the correct location.

Instead, she was doing something similar.

...

In the Five Elements Realm.

"He must be doing something similar too."

Ying Bing felt the increasingly full Demon Slaying Gourd, her gaze seeming to see a very distant place. If the accumulation in the Demon Slaying Gourd were completely full, it would be enough for her to condense the Hundred Birds Phoenix God.

Of course, that is on the premise of having the Jade Phoenix God.

By then, the divine intent she observed in the Divine Observation Realm would have no more worries, and the only thing left before reaching the Inner Scene would be time.

Could she also open the System comparison again?

After collecting enough true spirits, Ying Bing stopped in contemplation, standing at the foot of the lonely peak. The divine light of the Jade Phoenix God was right above her head, but she didn't look at it.

She was still looking into the distance, as if waiting for something.

Demons arrived one after another.

Among them was the group of half-demons led by Zhiduoluo. They had clearly gone through a bitter battle and were all injured.

The moment they saw Ying Bing, their expressionless faces flashed with surprise.

They had discussed it earlier. If the True Dragon bloodline and True Phoenix bloodline were both heavily injured before meeting, they didn't necessarily have to wait for both sides to be mutually exhausted before reaping the benefits.

After all, the strength of the true spirits this time far exceeded their expectations.

But looking at the scene now, at least the Green Luan Goddess was unharmed.

It formed a stark contrast with their own wretched state.

"Hmm?"

Ying Bing's cold gaze swept over. The half-demon gods immediately felt a sword hanging over their heads and hurriedly lowered their heads.

Then they silently communicated with their eyes.

Hmm.

We still have to stick to the original plan...

Other scattered demons arrived, but seeing that the powerful half-demons, including the Green Luan Goddess, were all standing there, their hearts filled with alarm.

No one is going up?

There must be something wrong here!

And so, a strange scene appeared.

More and more demons arrived at the foot of the Jade Peak.

But not a single demon went up.

Demons also have a herd mentality...

After a full half-hour.

As if guided by a sixth sense, Ying Bing raised her head to look over. Her clear, cold eyes suddenly had the brightness of melting snow in spring.

The众妖 (crowd of demons) was stunned. They turned back to look, and then shivered, not daring to stand in the middle of the two parties.

Are you kidding me?

If these two collide, what if we get caught in the crossfire later?

......

P.S: Viewers, you saw it, how powerful Little Li is after being electrocited. Please recharge, even a little author wants to be electrocited, hehe.
