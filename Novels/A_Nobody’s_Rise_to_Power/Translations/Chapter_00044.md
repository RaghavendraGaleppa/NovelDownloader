# Chapter 44: Taking the Opportunity to Slip Away

Because she felt strangely flustered, Little Green Plum couldn't help but explain.

"Uh, actually... I'm not..."

Green Plum spoke haltingly, her intention to hold Yang Can accountable completely swept away.

"Believe me, I really didn't..."

Yang Can immediately cut her off, grabbing her small hand and urgently turning to Sang Zhi.

"Miss Sang Zhi, please explain for me. I didn't summon you to serve me in bed, did I?"

"Uh, yes, that's right. Miss Green Plum, please don't misunderstand. This was my Master's way of showing his regard for Steward Yang, but... Steward Yang didn't accept it..."

Sang Zhi, wrapped in the quilt with only her head showing, explained with an awkward laugh.

The scene was quite embarrassing.

"Yes, yes, we didn't know about you and Steward Yang. You two... well, if we had known earlier..."

Little Sandalwood also came to her senses and quickly stepped forward to back her up.

Little Green Plum's mind was thrown into a muddle again.

She stammered, "You two? No, no, no, you're overthinking it. Actually, I... I mean, he and I... we don't have any relationship."

Sang Zhi and Little Sandalwood didn't believe her for a second.

Just from the way she acted earlier, even if you said that wasn't a jealous wife catching an adulterer, we'd have to believe it.

However, it was understandable for Miss Green Plum to deny it vehemently; she was just shy.

Besides, she was a personal maid to the Young Mistress of the Suo family, and Steward Yang was on very bad terms with the Young Mistress.

If it got out that the two of them had gotten together, would she have a good life if the Young Mistress found out?

No matter what, our seduction attempt today is doomed to fail.

However, the fact that Stewardess Green Plum and Steward Yang the Second were having an affair was an important piece of intelligence.

Thinking of this, Sang Zhi hurriedly said, "Yes, yes, of course we believe you. This servant will take her leave."

Sang Zhi didn't even bother with her clothes, wrapping herself in Yang Can's quilt and running out barefoot.

"Ha, please forgive us, forgive us."

Little Sandalwood rushed to the clothes rack, scooped up Madam Sang Zhi's clothes, and hugged them to her chest.

Then, while bowing and scraping to Green Plum and apologizing, she chased after her.

When she reached the door, she considerately closed it behind her.

Green Plum's head was buzzing. "No, I really didn't... don't go!"

But Sang Zhi didn't listen, and neither did Little Sandalwood. The two of them had already fled far away, one after the other.

As soon as they left, Yang Can let go of Green Plum.

Although Green Plum was dressed in men's clothing, her秀发 was draped over her shoulders, her lips were red and her teeth were white, and her appearance was delicate and charming. Anyone could tell at a glance that she was a woman.

The woman began to unleash her feminine fury.

She put her hands on her hips and glared at Yang Can. "My reputation is ruined! It's all been ruined by you!"

Yang Can looked innocent. "Those two girls are Master Zhang's people. To avoid raising suspicion, I was just thinking about how to politely refuse them. Then you showed up. Isn't that a perfect way to stall?"

"So I'm just supposed to be the scapegoat?"

"It's not a big deal. Do you think they dare to spread it around? A reputation is given by others. If no one knows, it's not ruined."

"That makes sense!"

Green Plum thought about it, and it did seem to be the case. She immediately turned her anger into joy.

She patted her chest in relief. "I almost got ruined by you. What bad luck. I'm leaving."

"Wait, don't go." Yang Can quickly stopped her.

"You... what are you going to do now?"

Green Plum immediately hugged her shoulders and looked at Yang Can warily.

Yang Can was amused and exasperated. "If you're going to be a good person, do it to the end. If you leave now, won't Sang Zhi and Little Sandalwood get suspicious if they see you?"

"Then... what do you want?"

"Sit with me for a while. When enough time has passed, won't it look like... that?"

Little Green Plum's face turned red. She naturally knew what Yang Can meant by "that."

Suddenly, the strange sounds she had heard coming from her young mistress before echoed in her ears again.

"By... by the way, what did I come here to do?"

Green Plum stammered, then her eyes suddenly lit up.

"Oh, right! I wanted to ask you, how do you plan to go about inspecting Feng'an Manor this time?"

Yang Can smiled. "That's perfect. Let's sit down and talk slowly."

"Okay!"

Green Plum glanced warily at Yang Can and, like a yellow croaker fish, slipped past him to sit in a chair. She only sat on half of the seat, ready to spring up and run away at a moment's notice.

Everyone knew that Steward Yang didn't know martial arts.

Although Tu Mama had died at his hands, no one ever knew exactly how.

But Yang Can's appearance was very misleading. Green Plum believed he had used a scheme to kill Tu Mama, or... had someone else do it.

So until now, Green Plum remained convinced that he had no martial arts skills.

Green Plum had excellent martial arts, but when facing Yang Can, she only thought of running, completely forgetting that she knew how to fight.

In the morning, four maids in green silk dresses came forward holding gilded basins, gilded pots, gilded bowls, and gilded spittoons to serve Zhang Yunyi as he dressed and washed.

Zhang Yunyi washed his face, washed his hands, brushed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth...

During this process, the four pretty maids all knelt in service.

This was the style of a local emperor. In Feng'an Manor, Master Zhang could do whatever he wanted.

Steward Wan Tai stood to one side and respectfully reported to him:

"Master, yesterday three more families of commoners fled from the Central Plains to Longshang. One of the men was a skilled plowman. This old servant has handed him over to the tenant head as usual. The other two families were settled on the newly reclaimed wasteland in Nanling."

Zhang Yunyi rinsed his mouth with salt water, and one pretty maid immediately knelt and held the gilded spittoon high. Zhang Yunyi spat the salt water into the spittoon, took a silk towel from another maid to wipe his mouth, and said nothing.

He needed to know about these matters, but unless they were important, he didn't need to handle them personally.

Wan Tai continued, "For these three families, this old servant had them all sign contracts for twenty years. According to the old rule, for the first three years, we only collect thirty percent of the rent, increasing it year by year thereafter. Starting from the seventh year, it will be seventy percent for the Manor Lord and thirty percent for them, until the contract expires."

Zhang Yunyi listened and nodded with satisfaction.

The population in Longshang was much less than in the Central Plains. For refugees and fugitives, they were inclusive and didn't reject them.

However, the minor landlords under the great clans would, in this process, both reclaim wasteland and hide fields while also taking in hidden households.

These lands and people became their privately owned hidden lands and people, becoming their wealth.

This phenomenon was very common throughout Longshang.

Therefore, at the clan lord's level, the acreage of Feng'an Manor was one number, but the actual acreage was another. There was a large amount of hidden fields.

Wan Tai continued to report, "There's another matter. The tenant Wang Mazi from Xiwazi seized two ridges of land from the tenant Li Qi two years ago, relying on his influence. The two sides have been in dispute for a long time and it's never been settled. Over who gets to use the Manor's oxen first, they fought again yesterday, and people from both families were injured."

Zhang Yunyi sneered. "Give each family head twenty lashes and deduct three months' worth of rations. They're all idle, damn things cheaper than beasts! A good beating is what they need. What's the point of arguing right and wrong with them!"

As the Manor Lord, he actually served the function of a local official.

Thus, when commoners had disputes, they naturally needed him to judge them.

And Master Zhang was particularly efficient in judging cases, basically采取 the method of "giving each party fifty strokes of the big stick."

Simple and crude, but sometimes quite effective.

Anyway, in this Feng'an Manor, he was the law. For all disputes, his word was final.

Wan Tai hurriedly agreed, "Yes. Also..."

Seeing his hesitation, Zhang Yunyi looked at him displeased.

Wan Tai gritted his teeth and said, "Zhen... Zhen Laoshi has gone crazy and is always talking nonsense. Last night he almost broke into the fortress. Should we detain him first? Wait until Steward Yang leaves, then release him..."

"Isn't it too much trouble to keep arresting and releasing him?"

Zhang Yunyi glared at him. "Zhen Laoshi is already crazy. What's a madman still doing alive?"

"Yes!"

Zhang Yunyi snorted coldly and walked out of the bedroom. Wan Tai hurriedly followed.

Just then, Zhang Xinran walked over quickly. When he saw Zhang Yunyi, he slowed his pace and called out, "Dad!"

Young Master Zhang's voice was rather stiff.

When he was born, Master Zhang himself hadn't yet come of age and was practically a teenager himself.

After a brief curiosity about this newborn, Master Zhang didn't pay much attention to him.

Later, after he gained the appreciation of the Yu family, he became busy with his career and paid even less attention to his eldest son.

Therefore, the relationship between the two father and son was always tinged with awkwardness.

Over time, the two even developed a mutual dislike, and they simply couldn't get close.

Zhang Yunyi was taken aback when he saw his son's expression.

"What, didn't Sang Zhi succeed? Steward Yang didn't take the bait?"

Young Master Zhang said with a bitter smile, "He wanted to, but before he could even open his mouth, the pair of wild ducks were beaten apart."

Young Master Zhang told Master Zhang the news that Little Sandalwood had brought that morning.

Master Zhang said in surprise, "So he's gotten involved with the Young Mistress's personal maid!"

Young Master Zhang said helplessly, "Dad, with that Green Plum watching him, our beauty trap won't work."

Master Zhang glared at him angrily and scolded, "You fool, is your head made of locust wood? He's gotten involved with the Young Mistress's personal maid. Isn't that a handle for us? Compared to sleeping with Sang Zhi, he's probably more afraid of this matter getting out, right?"

Young Master Zhang's eyes lit up. "That's right, why didn't I think of that?"

Master Zhang was furious. "What can you think of, you good-for-nothing wastrel! Your father I built up this family with my bare hands. But you? I'm afraid even if I left it to you to maintain, you couldn't do it."

Young Master Zhang frowned, his face full of annoyance.

Zhang Yunyi got even angrier and waved his hand. "Don't bother with Yang Can's affairs, get lost!"

Young Master Zhang stiffened his neck and walked off, full of resentment.

Zhang Yunyi shook his head and gave Steward Wan Tai a bitter smile.

"Look at him. The 'moving mountain goods' matter is of great importance. How could I dare entrust it to him?"

Wan Tai smiled bitterly helplessly. "But Master, you're getting on in years. If you still have to personally handle many matters, it's really too exhausting."

Zhang Yunyi shook his head and sighed.

"It's not so bad to be exhausted, but look at his attitude? The whole family eats my food and drinks my drink. But who understands my hardship? Who can share my worries..."
