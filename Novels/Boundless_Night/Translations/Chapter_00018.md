Chapter 18: Visitors from Crimson Glow City

As Qin Ming pondered, Xu Yueping knocked on his courtyard gate, looking for him.

"Little Qin, come out quickly, something urgent has come up."

Qin Ming's heart sank. Had the destruction of the Mountain Patrol Team been exposed so quickly?

"We'll depart in an hour," Xu Yueping told him. People from Crimson Glow City had arrived and wished to meet the Awakened ones from nearby villages.

Xu Yueping lowered his voice, "They are said to be direct descendants of noble families. While they are here to help us clear the mountains, it's also to temper themselves."

Qin Ming asked, "Is it finally beginning?"

Xu Yueping spoke solemnly, "You must perform well this time. The people who've come are of no simple status. Strive to seize this opportunity to enter Crimson Glow City."

***

An hour later, Xu Yueping's home buzzed with activity.

Old Man Liu was full of vigor, carrying a thick-backed saber and clad in worn leather armor, donning a refined iron helmet – fully armed.

Qin Ming stepped forward, asking, "Elder Liu, what are you doing? Today is just a meeting; we're not going into the mountains."

Old Man Liu replied, "Just getting used to it beforehand."

Yang Yongqing also took the matter seriously, carrying two blades on his back.

"Although nothing serious should happen in the shallow night, someone still needs to guard the village. Uncle Liu, you've exhausted your vital energy and are quite old..." Xu Yueping was cut off by Old Man Liu before he could finish.

"An old steed in the stable still yearns to gallop a thousand miles, not to mention I'm full of vigor and vitality now! I alone can take on both you and Yang Yongqing!" Old Man Liu insisted on going.

Not everyone dared to take the risk, such as the village's other two Awakened ones. As for the injured Wang Qinglin, he had no choice in the matter.

The destination wasn't far, just at a crossroads seven li away.

Under the dim night sky, dense forests stretched as far as the eye could see.

Over a dozen villages had received notice. The Awakened ones, being swift, arrived one after another.

Smaller villages like Twin Tree Village only sent four people, while larger ones sent more than ten, with the total number still under a hundred.

The people from Crimson Glow City had arrived earlier, divided into three teams, almost all armored and superbly equipped. They waited quietly in front.

The Awakened ones from the various villages also quieted down, awed by the gleaming armor and sharp blades before them, and by the reverence they held for the noble elites of the brilliant city.

Each of the three teams bore unique clan emblems, with a dozen or so members per team. The three leaders standing at the very front were the most eye-catching.

One man was astonishingly three meters tall, clad in dark gold armor, his black hair reaching his shoulders. His eyes were as sharp as knife blades, exuding an incredibly strong oppressive aura.

His mount was equally striking: a fiery red giant ox, its back significantly higher than an adult man's, boasting two normal curved horns plus a third, sword-like horn pointing forward.

Upon seeing the Awakened ones from the villages arrive, the three-meter-tall man didn't act superior by remaining on his ox. He dismounted, nodded to everyone, and said, "My name is Cao Long."

He briefly introduced that many experts had come from Crimson Glow City this time, with over a dozen families helping to clear the mountains. The young people from their three families were responsible for this area.

"I am from the Wei family, my name is Wei Zhirou," said the woman among the three. She wasn't standing next to the giant Cao Long but on a green stone.

She wore a pure white fox fur coat, her dark hair fluttering in the wind. A sweet, radiant smile adorned her fair, oval face. This kind of beauty held considerable allure for the young people from the various villages.

In the eyes of these young people who had guarded the mountains and never traveled far, this noble lady from the brilliant city was like an elegant and ethereal white-clad fairy. Even many years later, they would find it hard to forget her.

Wei Zhirou stood gracefully, indeed very beautiful. She smoothed her wind-tousled hair and spoke about the mountain-clearing operation, also delivering a piece of news.

"This winter's heavy snow has blocked the roads, making it difficult to transport food from outside. However, please rest assured, Crimson Glow City has already dispatched giant beasts to pull grain carts, and it will arrive shortly."

This immediately caused a stir, and people from all villages showed expressions of joy.

However, some worried if the grain prices would be exorbitant once delivered this way.

"My name is Mu Qing," said the last of the three leaders. Their entire body was wrapped in a black cloak, even their face obscured, making them appear quite mysterious. Even after speaking, it was impossible to tell if they were male or female, as their voice was notably neutral.

Mu Qing stated directly that they were unfamiliar with the mountains and required local Awakened ones to guide them.

This was the fundamental reason why the three teams had come here to meet the Awakened ones from the various villages.

If they joined them in their operations, there would be generous rewards.

Cao Long mentioned that exceptional performance could earn relatively valuable Intent-Qi Arts, Meditation Arts, and similar rewards.

This immediately sparked heated discussion, with many eyes shining eagerly, as the "Awakening Methods" circulating in this area were generally low-grade.

"What constitutes exceptional performance?" someone couldn't help but ask.

"Providing crucial information to prevent casualties among us, hunting special anomalies, discovering locations that nurture spiritual substances..."

People realized that the rewards weren't easy to obtain. The noble elites of Crimson Glow City weren't just here to temper their nascent bodies; they also aimed to explore the more mysterious areas within the mountains.

Wei Zhirou added, "If you discover any unusual phenomena in the mountains, informing us immediately can also be considered providing crucial information."

"I know a crevice where silver threads once spread. Even if someone who fell in managed to escape, they'd hardly survive. Does that count?"

Qin Ming noticed that it was someone from the neighboring Green Mulberry Village who spoke first.

Evidently, people from nearby villages had also died there.

Old Man Liu slapped his thigh, looking at Qin Ming, indicating that someone had "cut them off" by speaking first.

Wei Zhirou nodded, "The mountain's magnetic field is chaotic. The place you mentioned should be a smaller node. If you find another similar location, I will give you a mid-grade secret manual concerning awakening."

She explained that these special nodes might persist for several years. They would search for and map them one by one, leaving a mountain terrain map for the locals to prevent anyone from accidentally entering dangerous areas in the future.

Cao Long spoke, "If you discover a place where white mist billows and five-colored mists radiate, under no circumstances should you approach it. Such areas are far more dangerous. Whoever can provide such a clue will be heavily rewarded with a high-grade Intent-Qi Art."

Many people's breathing grew heavy upon hearing this. A secret manual of that caliber was too distant and ethereal for them; who wouldn't desire it?

Some realized that the Crimson Glow City nobles tempering themselves was merely a facade; they undoubtedly had other important objectives. The unusual phenomena in the mountains involved secrets unknown to the locals.

However, the Awakened ones from the various villages remained relatively calm. Even if they understood there were hidden motives, what then? Those dangerous domains were not areas they could tread.

Furthermore, regardless of their motives, the Crimson Glow City nobles would ultimately help them clear the mountains and resist the threat of anomalies from within, which was enough.

Cao Long informed everyone that the high-ranking officials of Crimson Glow City and the mysterious beings deep within the mountain range had one final negotiation, which would take place outside the mountain recently, with results expected soon.

The Awakened ones from the various villages whispered and discussed. Although they lived in this region, they had only heard legends of a handful of high-level beings. Their deepest impression of the mountain depths was mystery, unknown, and fear; it was filled with awe-inspiring mists.

"If they negotiate outside the mountain, will we be able to see it?"

The speaker was a youth from one of the three teams, his face still somewhat immature, truly a "newborn calf unafraid of a tiger." He wanted to know what the top-tier anomalies from the mountain depths looked like.

The three teams, previously quiet, now stirred. They were all young, possessing intense curiosity and a desire for exploration.

Cao Long, significantly taller than average, with his imposing physique, exuded a powerful presence. He merely swept his gaze over them, and the people quickly fell silent.

He didn't reprimand them, instead nodding and replying, "Perhaps there will be a chance."

Immediately, the area became abuzz with excited discussion.

Qin Ming also grew restless. Aside from accidentally catching a glimpse of the "Moon Worm," he was utterly clueless about other top-tier anomalies. He also wished to take this opportunity to see their true forms.

The tall and slender Wei Zhirou stood on the green stone, her pure white fox fur coat fluttering in the wind, making her appear elegant and otherworldly. She conveyed another piece of news.

"The current situation is quite delicate. You might not know this, but the turmoil in the mountain range isn't solely due to the chaotic magnetic field. It's also because another group of high-level beings has migrated from afar, bringing their families to seize some of the resources within the mountains."

Upon hearing this, everyone's expressions changed.

Wei Zhirou continued, "Now that there's an additional group of high-level beings, under their oppression, many dangerous species are forced to expand out of the mountains, encroaching upon the living space of those outside."

Xu Yueping asked, "So, the outer areas of the mountain forest, which had just become briefly peaceful, will become very dangerous in the future?"

"It's nothing serious. Who allowed them to expand? We'll just fight them back. Our mountain-clearing operation is precisely to solve this problem." Although Mu Qing's voice was neutral, their words were exceptionally assertive.

The Awakened ones from the various villages secretly breathed a sigh of relief. The figure completely covered by the black cloak had boosted their confidence.

Mu Qing proclaimed loudly, "They've trespassed into forbidden territory and forgotten the pain of the past! We will forcefully awaken them, making them understand that the dominion of the two-legged human-beasts in this region has never waned..."

At first, people's hearts surged with emotion, and their morale soared. Even though the term "two-legged human-beasts" felt odd, it was merely a peculiar sensation within them. But when Mu Qing continued their impassioned speech and a fluffy golden tail emerged from behind the black cloak, many instantly became unsettled.

What species was that?!

"Mu Qing," Cao Long warned.

Wei Zhirou said, "Mu Qing is human."

The three teams behind them, however, were calm, seemingly already aware of Mu Qing's condition.

Qin Ming was entranced, staring intently at the front.

Old Man Liu whispered, "Perhaps they've chosen a mystical path. Whether they're still human, and what state they're currently in, is quite perplexing."

This was another different path Qin Ming had witnessed, following Cao Long's Gigantic Spirit God path.

Cao Long said, "Now, we need to select suitable companions. They will accompany us during the mountain-clearing operation, guiding us through the mountains. Rest assured, your safety is guaranteed."

He emphasized that there was no compulsion; if unwilling, they could leave now.

At the same time, Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing reiterated that the rewards during the mountain-clearing process would be extremely generous, including spiritual substances, high-grade Intent-Qi Arts, and more. They would not be stingy.

The Awakened ones present had already made their choice by not remaining in their villages, so no one left now.

Qin Ming naturally followed the crowd, not acting out of turn.

Wei Zhirou smiled at Cao Long and Mu Qing. In the eyes of the crowd, her smile was radiant and charming, possessing an otherworldly sweetness. She shook the name list in her hand at the two, indicating her desire to choose first.

"Only one person per selection. You can go first," Cao Long said, letting her choose first. Mu Qing also had no objections.

Wei Zhirou nodded with a smile, "Then I won't be polite. Our Wei family is very eager to recruit young people with golden aptitude."

"Who isn't!" Mu Qing retorted, then whispered to Cao Long, negotiating who among them would choose next.

Wei Zhirou looked at the name list, her delicate brows slightly furrowed, experiencing some difficulty in choosing. Finally, she called out two names consecutively, saying, "Who is Zhou Wubing, and who is Qin Ming?"

"You can only choose one person at a time," Mu Qing reminded her.

Wei Zhirou smiled, "I know, I just wanted to see them."

Zhou Wubing stepped forward, half a head taller than average, his body very sturdy and strong.

He wasn't originally named this. As a sickly child, his parents changed his name to Zhou Wubing, meaning "no sickness." However, it wasn't until a distant relative returned that he was finally cured and subsequently awakened during his golden age.

Qin Ming was surprised. "Sickly Lad's" demeanor had completely transformed. In the past, he was sallow and emaciated, his yellow hair like autumn weeds. Now, his black hair was thick, and his vitality was exceptionally vigorous.

Qin Ming stepped out, standing calmly, a little taller than Sickly Lad.

"Both of you possess golden aptitude; I'd like to invite both," Wei Zhirou said, smiling as she looked at them.

Sickly Lad was no longer who he used to be. Although momentarily dazzled by the radiant smile of this ethereal noblewoman, he quickly regained his composure.

Just then, a young man emerged from the woods and quickly approached Wei Zhirou, whispering to her.

Only then did people realize that the three families had sent more than just three teams of young, inexperienced individuals; there were others as well.

"Zhou Wubing was sickly in the past, yet his strength has been slowly increasing since his awakening, and he was even taught by Xu Kong?" Wei Zhirou expressed surprise. After a low-voiced conversation with the young man, she looked up, her beautiful eyes fixing on Sickly Lad. She smiled and waved him over, choosing him.
