# Chapter 141: The Jadeheart Fruit and the Extraordinary Old Man with Peerless Teleportation Skills  

Xiaolang Island.  

This was a first-grade spirit island—small in size, rugged with strange rocks, and inhabited only by a group of low-level lizard demons that had yet to refine their bones.  

But suddenly, an unremarkable old man with beady eyes and two wisps of mustache above his lips appeared on the island, hunched over. The lizard demons immediately grew wary, treating him as a formidable enemy. Yet the old man merely waved his hand, summoning a surge of water that swept them all away.  

Without pause, he made his way to the southeastern corner of the island, where a peculiar rock resembling a turtle shell stood. He began chanting an incantation.  

*"Buzz!"*  

As the old man's spell echoed, the strange rock trembled and shrank, transforming into a jade-green turtle shell that seamlessly attached itself to his back, as if it had always been part of him.  

With the disappearance of the "turtle-shell rock," a wondrous spirit tree was revealed on the island. The tree was no more than a foot tall, its jade-green trunk adorned with intricate spirit patterns. At its crown, a single green fruit exuded a faint, refreshing fragrance. However, the fruit was not yet fully ripe, still bearing a hint of immaturity.  

"Soon, soon. At most, half a day more, and the Jadeheart Fruit will ripen," the old man murmured excitedly. "With half a day, those fools in the Southern Marsh Water Realm should still be able to hold out. Once the Jadeheart Fruit matures, I can restore my foundation and leave this troubled place..."  

With that thought, he retrieved a jade vial from his sleeve and poured out a stream of spirit-infused spring water onto the tree's roots. The tree shimmered brilliantly in response.  

Satisfied, the old man smiled and prepared to chant another spell, intending to revert the turtle shell back into a rock to conceal the Jadeheart Fruit's presence.  

But at that very moment—  

A vast divine sense, taking the form of a three-eyed thunder dragon, surged from the depths of the water, scanning the entire island with lightning speed.  

The old man's expression changed. The divine sense had come too swiftly, catching him off guard. Before he could react, the thunder dragon roared and lunged toward his consciousness like a bolt of lightning.  

---  

*"Boom!"*  

A flash of dark light flickered in the old man's eyes as a phantom of a jade-green tortoise emerged from his sea of consciousness, forming an intangible barrier before him.  

The thunderous impact of the divine sense clashed against the tortoise shell, yet the shell remained unbroken, steadfastly blocking the assault.  

*"Clang!"*  

Yet another figure suddenly cleaved through the waves, arriving in an instant. Along with this figure came a radiant sword-light, sharp as bamboo, piercing straight toward the old man's forehead.  

The old man's face darkened as he chanted, and the turtle shell on his back expanded like a boulder, shielding him completely.  

The sword-light struck the shell with a metallic clang, leaving only a deep scratch.  

*"Shing!"*  

But then, the sword-light split—seventeen identical blades materialized in an instant, slashing at the shell in a relentless tide.  

*"Clang! Clang!"*  

Though the shell held firm, its spiritual light flickered and dimmed under the barrage, accumulating countless new marks.  

"Stop! Stop!" the old man shouted from within his shell, his voice strained. "I am not one of the Southern Marsh Water Realm's demons! I do not serve the Crimsonflame Ape Clan! Spare me, I beg you!"  

The attacker remained silent, only intensifying the sword-light assault.  

Worse still, the attacker's spiritual energy seemed inexhaustible—each sword strike blazed like the sun, unrelenting, as if a thousand swords were striking at once.  

"I have never consumed blood sacrifices in my life!" the old man cried, his patience wearing thin. "You, a disciple of a noble sect, why must you press so hard? I offer you a treasure in exchange for your departure—how about that?"  

The sword-light paused briefly.  

Seizing the moment, the old man quickly produced a crimson pill. "This is a Scarletblood Wolf Pill, refined from the essence of a slain wolf demon. Consuming it enhances cultivation. Take it and leave!"  

"Not enough," came the cold reply.  

"You push too far!" the old man bellowed in fury.  

The only response was the renewed onslaught of sword-light.  

The relentless barrage left the turtle shell battered and its spiritual aura severely weakened.  

"Bind!"  

Realizing negotiation was futile, the old man muttered a spell. Instantly, the river surged, its waters weaving into a translucent rope that lashed toward the attacker.  

Not stopping there, the old man shouted, "Go!"  

Giant water elephants, formed from the river's currents, charged forth with earth-shaking roars.  

"Fall!"  

From the sky, rain descended—each drop sharp as an arrow, a torrential downpour of lethal projectiles.  

Three techniques unleashed at once—water ropes, stampeding elephants, and arrow-like rain—filled the air with mist. The old man's mastery over water was extraordinary, far beyond ordinary methods.  

Yet the attacker merely summoned a seven-tiered jade pagoda, which hovered before him.  

The water-based attacks crashed against it but could not breach its defenses. With a single tremor from the pagoda, the water dispersed as if it had never existed.  

"A top-grade spirit artifact?!" The old man's face paled.  

*"Shing!"*  

At that moment, the sword-light split once more—eighteen blades now slashed at the turtle shell, which let out a mournful groan.  

Seeing this, the old man retracted the shell in haste.  

*"Clang!"*  

Eighteen sword-lights converged, their icy edges poised to strike.  

But just as they were about to land, the old man's body dissolved into water, vanishing without a trace.  

He reappeared on the opposite side of the island.  

"Hmm?"  

This teleportation technique was astonishing—instantaneous, as if bending space itself. Even eighteen sword-lights striking simultaneously had missed their mark.  

*"Shing!"*  

The attacker redirected the swords, chasing after the old man once more.  

Yet each time the swords neared, the old man dissolved into water again, moving faster than the blades could follow.  

This time, however, he did not reappear—as if he had truly teleported away.  

At that moment, the golden seal in the attacker's dantian flared brightly. Acting on instinct, the sword-light abruptly changed course, stabbing toward the Jadeheart Fruit at his feet.  

The spot where the fruit grew was empty.  

*"Swish!"*  

But just as the sword was about to strike air, a figure suddenly emerged from the still-damp spirit water at the tree's roots—materializing directly in the path of the blade.
