# Chapter 220: Worsening Injuries and Sudden Danger

The remote inn had shabby rooms. Wen Caishang knew her "bad luck" would attract trouble, but she didn't expect it to strike so quickly.

There was no mirror in the room. She ordered Li Xian to fetch a basin of clear water, pushed open the window, and placed it under the moonlight. She removed her white robe and used the water as a mirror to inspect the injury on her back.

The thunderbolt had struck suddenly, hitting her back. Her clothes were impervious to fire and water, so there were no burns. However, strands of thunderforce had seeped into her body, causing injuries that were truly severe.

Wen Caishang frowned, thinking, "The thunderforce has invaded my internal organs. The injury is serious. Even with proper rest, it will take months to recover. We are still very far from the One Union Manor. Managing this injury along the way will be difficult."

"I can only travel slowly and rest. First, I will mix some herbs to tend to the wound. Fortunately, I brought Li Xian along; I can have him handle these matters."

She examined her body; the thunderforce was rampaging within. Her internal organs and acupoints all over her body throbbed with a dull pain. Her expression remained calm as she sat cross-legged, enduring it all.

Li Xian went downstairs to eat. The innkeeper said, "Strange, so strange. How could lightning strike on such a clear day?"

The shopkeeper said, "As long as no one was hurt, that's what matters. Tomorrow, I'll call the old carpenter from the next village to repair it properly."

The shopkeeper said to Li Xian, "Sir, I apologize for disturbing your peace of mind. I will have the kitchen stir-fry a plate of soy-sauce beef for you as compensation. Please don't be angry!"

Li Xian laughed and said, "Sure!"

There were already three plates of stir-fried dishes on the table: stir-fried yellow beef, stir-fried crispy beans, and stir-fried pork intestines. He was originally going to make do with this for his meal. Now, with an extra plate of soy-sauce beef, making four dishes in total, it was a complete meal despite the humble setting. It wouldn't be right not to have a little wine.

Li Xian spent another few dozen copper coins to buy a jar of "Daughter Red," a ten-year-old vintage. The crispy beans were crunchy, the beef mellow and fragrant, and the pork intestines were starchy and filling.

A bite of side dish followed by a sip of fine wine; it was excellent. The inn was open to the north and south, with the windows wide open, letting in a cool breeze.

It was the middle of the second month. Winter had passed and spring had arrived, full of vitality. There was a patch of dark green bamboo forest nearby, rustling in the wind.

The scenery of this foreign land was exceptionally peaceful.

The night grew deep and quiet. The innkeeper's snores gradually rose, and the shopkeeper went to his room to rest. Li Xian sat alone in the hall, eating his small dishes and drinking his wine, unable to help thinking about the events that had just occurred.

"The lightning struck out of nowhere; it can't be a coincidence."

"Could the Madam be injured?"

Li Xian had a vague suspicion, but it didn't seem likely. Wen Caishang's charm remained, her white skirt fluttering, calm and noble. How could she look injured?

"Is the Madam's strength so great that she can withstand a heavenly thunder and still protect herself?" Li Xian shook his head and smiled; there was no need to think too much about it.

He felt inside his bag. Fifty taels of silver, five taels of loose silver, and several strings of copper coins. It would be enough for quite some time.

"Traveling with the Madam, I really don't need to worry about not having enough money. If I were walking the Jianghu alone, I'd have to pinch pennies and save carefully," Li Xian muttered to himself.

Having whetted his appetite, the four small dishes seemed insufficient. Li Xian waved his hand and bought two more plates.

He ate to his heart's content and went back to his room to sleep.

The next day.

Li Xian got up and knocked on Wen Caishang's door. Wen Caishang's face was pale; she had sat in meditation for half the night, stabilizing her condition. A martial artist's body is like a miniature universe; having been struck by lightning, her internal universe was in chaos, and her strength was impaired.

Wen Caishang circulated her Qi and blood, her face regaining its normal ruddy complexion. She put on her boots and pushed the door open. Li Xian said, "Madam, should we head back?"

Wen Caishang nodded and said, "Yes!"

Li Xian called the innkeeper, tipped him one tael of silver, and asked about the major cities nearby. The innkeeper, seeing that Li Xian and Wen Caishang had an extraordinary demeanor and were free with their money, treated them with respect and pointed out the route to the city.

Following the road, they arrived at the territory of "Changhong City." The city was bustling with activity. As they walked down the street, Li Xian asked, "Madam, what should we do next?"

Wen Caishang, her injury still serious, said, "You decide." She focused her mind on healing her body and stabilizing her internal universe.

Li Xian passed a bookstore and first bought a map. The shopkeeper was shrewd, dividing the maps into four grades: rough map, earth map, mountain map, and water map. A single map cost two taels of silver.

Only by combining the four maps could one see the surrounding terrain clearly. Li Xian had come from poverty and felt the silver was not well spent. But glancing at the Madam, to save trouble, he spent the money to buy them.

Combining the maps, he learned that they were in the "Flower Water Prefecture." A major prefecture within the Yu'nan Dao. It was still a very long distance from "Qiongtian Prefecture."

The territory of Great Wu was vast, with prefectures connected to one another. Sometimes the distance spanned by a single prefecture was hard to imagine. The maps were measured by human legs, step by step, drawn line by line.

Therefore, the maps were fragmented and not systematic. Li Xian knew Qiongtian Prefecture was to the south, so based on the map, he first headed south.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, should we rent a carriage?" Wen Caishang thought, "The journey is long. Rushing in a carriage or boat is useless. We should proceed slowly and observe my condition."

She said, "Why rush? We can enjoy the scenery along the way."

Li Xian thought, "The Madam has the mood for sightseeing; she must be confident. I long to roam the Jianghu; this trip is a rare opportunity." Following the map, they left the city.

They headed south, traveling more than ten miles. Wen Caishang's injury had not healed, but her condition was gradually stabilizing. She ordered Li Xian to buy a carriage and horse to travel home.

A regular horse cost more than ten taels, and with the carriage, the total came to over twenty taels. Wen Caishang frowned slightly, but seeing that the town where they bought the horse was a small county, better horses and carriages were hard to come by.

So she made do with it.

The carriage was bumpy, disturbing her light sleep. Wen Caishang thought, "Once we reach a larger city, we will change the carriage and horse. Let's make do for a few days."

Because the territory was vast, the cities were not densely packed. Traveling for several days without seeing signs of human habitation was quite normal.

That day, the spring rain poured down from the sky.

Suddenly, thunder rumbled.

Wen Caishang frowned slightly and said, "Xiao Xian, the rain is getting heavier. Let's find shelter."

Li Xian held the reins and looked around. Seeing no villages or houses, he used his Feng Shui skills to look for a cave along the road.

Dark clouds accumulated in the sky, and suddenly, with a rumble, lightning struck a tree ahead. The horse was startled, and combined with the slippery mud road, it immediately fell to the side. Wen Caishang's lightness skill was excellent; she landed steadily, her toes touching the mud, remaining composed.

The horse's knee bone was broken, and it could not get up. Li Xian sighed, "Good horse. Leaving you here would only mean being eaten by wild beasts. I will give you a painless death." He struck with a palm, helping the horse die without pain.

Wen Caishang's expression turned unsightly, her willow brows tightly furrowed. She didn't expect the bad luck to be so intense. "Was that lightning just now meant to strike me again? Hmph. If you want to stop me, I will definitely get that Earth Essence!"

Her expression turned icy.

Li Xian saw the rain was continuous and there was a banana grove nearby. He cut down banana leaves to use as a large umbrella, found a cave in the mountains, and sat waiting for the rain to stop.

The water they carried with them had run out.

Li Xian caught rainwater, boiled it over a fire, and handed it to Wen Caishang. He asked, "Madam, do you have something on your mind?"

"No," Wen Caishang replied淡淡ly. She took the kettle and took a sip of rainwater. Seeing the rain gradually stop and the thunder fade away, she felt a bit relieved.

She said, "The road outside is muddy. Let's wait a moment before moving on." She sat cross-legged to adjust her internal energy.

"Okay."

Li Xian, with nothing to do in his spare time and unwilling to waste time, practiced martial arts in the cave to accumulate proficiency. The Vast Leg Technique had long been perfected and was approaching its peak.

The wind whistled. Suddenly, he saw claw marks, sword marks, and fist marks on the stone walls of the cave. He wondered, "Was this cave manually carved out by someone? The marks don't look very old."

He was very curious. But they had reached the end of the cave, with no clues. Li Xian continued his practice when he heard a playful laugh from above: "Good lad, good lad, good skills!"

The sound echoed.

Li Xian immediately stopped his fists and legs, looking around warily. "Who? Which senior is hiding here?"

"You, this lad, are so strange, so strange," the voice said. "This is clearly my residence. Why do you say I am hiding?"

"Your little grandpa is clearly here."

Something touched Li Xian's shoulder.

The voice said again, "I'm also here," and tickled Li Xian's ear. Another sound came, "Here," patting his belly.

The speed was fast, the lightness skill strong, and the figure elusive. Li Xian knew he was no match and said frankly, "Senior is厉害; I am inferior." He stood still.

"Boring, boring!"

The voice said angrily. A figure revealed itself, actually a short person. He was only as tall as Li Xian's abdomen, with messy hair and a black face. He looked extremely angry.

Li Xian apologized, "I didn't know this was Senior's cave. If I had known, I wouldn't have disturbed you."

That person could use Bone-Contraction Technique and had an extremely eccentric temperament. He had been sleeping in a crevice in the rock. When Li Xian and Wen Caishang approached, he woke up but didn't move, observing from the side.

Wen Caishang said, "Xiao Xian, let's go!"

Li Xian cupped his hands in salute and helped the Madam leave. That person let out a sharp whistle, leaped forward, and blocked their path, saying with surprise, "Amazing, such a powerful person!"

Wen Caishang frowned. The man stared at Wen Caishang and said, "You, trade a move with me?"

Wen Caishang said, "Move." She didn't want to pay attention to him. Grabbing Li Xian's shoulder, she leaped up, using her lightness skill to fly. Stepping on leaves, she drifted several yards away, her figure ethereal and agile.

The man giggled and said, "Excellent, excellent. It's been a long time since I've seen such a powerful expert!" He put his hands on the ground and scurried forward, his speed extremely fast.

Wen Caishang frowned, thinking, "It's that martial arts maniac who challenges anyone he meets. If I weren't injured, I could easily shake him off. But this current situation is truly annoying."

It turned out this person was not unknown. His Jianghu alias was "Martial Maniac."

They each traveled several miles.

The man was struggling to keep up but managed to stay on their tail. Wen Caishang said coldly, "Martial Maniac, if you keep chasing, don't blame me for cutting you to pieces in the future!"

Upon hearing this, the man wasn't angry but delighted. He clapped his hands and cheered, "Good, good. You come cut me to pieces; I won't agree. That way, you'll be forced to fight me. Hehe, in that case, I should chase even harder."

Wen Caishang was extremely helpless. She landed in the forest and said, "Fine, I know you, Martial Maniac, love martial arts like a madman. When you see an expert, you must trade a move. Since I can't shake you off today, I'll trade a move with you. I'll come back to kill you another day."

Martial Maniac said, "Good, one move it is." He was fanatically excited. Martial Maniac immediately gathered his momentum, his Qi converging in his palms. This person's strength was formidable; his palms contained immense power.

He struck with this palm. Grass and trees flew along the path; his momentum was like a rainbow. Wen Caishang raised her Qi and gently slapped her palm forward. Their palms met, and they held against each other for a long time.

Suddenly, with a "bang," Martial Maniac flew backward more than ten yards. The moment he landed, he immediately scurried away, spitting three mouthfuls of blood.
