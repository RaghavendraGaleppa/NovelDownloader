# Chapter 514: The Battle of True Monarchs from Two Sects

The compassionate and serene expression on Miao Di Bodhisattva’s face instantly transformed into bone-chilling cold and righteous fury. Her hands formed a seal, taking on the wrathful visage of a Bright King.

She hesitated no longer. The willow branch in her hand, a vibrant emerald green, was suddenly flung upward.

A brilliant emerald light burst forth from the branch, like a dike-breaking torrent of jade. It did not blast toward Pu Du True Monarch but instead shot straight into the endless void above her head.

*Buzz! Boom! Boom! Boom!*

The void seemed to be torn open, creating three massive rifts. Accompanied by deafening禅 chants and boundless Buddhist light, three great portals of pure faith and law, constructed from sheer willpower, burst open in the heavens like a divine miracle.

From the left portal, a monk stepped into the void, barefoot and clad in simple white robes.

His face was resolute, neither joyful nor sorrowful. With every step he took, a golden lotus platform wreathed in the flames of Nihilistic Lotus Fire bloomed beneath his feet.

Wherever the lotus flames passed, the void seemed to collapse from the scorching, exuding an aura of cold, dead finality.

This was the Great Awakening Bodhisattva, guardian of the Western Subduing Hall of the Bodhi Zen Pure Land and master of the "Nihilistic Red Lotus Dao Fruit"!

From the right portal, a golden light shone with ten thousand rays as a majestic Dharma form, several zhang tall with eight arms, descended with imposing grandeur.

Each of its arms held a different Buddhist implement: a vajra, a treasure vase, a lotus flower...

A brilliant, radiant Great Sun Treasure Wheel hovered behind its head, its light capable of purifying all evil and filth in the world, radiating a vast life force and immortal brilliance.

This was Hui Ri Bodhisattva, the leader of the Eastern Wasteland's Dharma Protection Corps and master of the "Great Sun Glazed Body."

From the middle portal, the shadows of a thousand arms layered over one another, forming countless profound and complex hand seals of unfathomable power.

With the formation of each seal, the Buddhist chants in the void grew louder, as if millions of monks were chanting in unison. The sound waves transformed into tangible golden ripples, spreading out in layers, shaking the four corners and eight directions.

This was the Dharma Seal Bodhisattva, an expert in the "Thousand-Hand Dharma Seal" from the Bodhi Zen Pure Land.

With the descent of the three Bodhisattvas' Dharmakayas, the weather over the entire Eastern Wasteland changed dramatically.

The vast Buddhist might collided violently with the immortal light radiating from Pu Du True Monarch, stirring up spatial turbulence that felt as if it could destroy the world.

The entire Eastern Wasteland trembled. The great demons lurking deep within the wasteland did their utmost to conceal their auras, afraid that if they showed themselves, they would be dealt with by these three newly arrived Bodhisattvas.

"My life is over!"

In a demon cave deep within the Eastern Wasteland, a white-haired old ape fretted anxiously. He was not alone; the other two great demons also shrank back like turtles, immediately sealing off their mountain gates and caves.

"Remnant of the Primordial Demon, how dare you covet the righteous fruit of our Buddhist Path! You must be executed for your evil!"

The Great Awakening Bodhisattva's eyes were like bronze bells, and his furious shout was like a thunderclap from the ninth heaven. He pointed with two fingers, and the Nihilistic Red Lotus Fire beneath his feet, which could burn all things to nothingness, transformed into a condensed thread of golden-red flame. Exuding a finality that made even souls tremble, it shot fiercely toward the brow of Pu Du True Monarch.

"Hahaha!"

Faced with the encirclement of three Bodhisattvas of the same level, Pu Du True Monarch was not only unafraid but let out a long laugh. He couldn't help but clap his hands and sigh, "After doing so much and waiting for so long, the fish has finally taken the bait."

The Primordial Origin Sect naturally desired to start a great war between sects.

If a great war did not break out, how could the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect make progress and hone their techniques? Even his own opportunity for a breakthrough was in someone else's hands. If they didn't fight, how could he obtain what he wanted?

"Miao Di, your ability to call for backup is quite impressive. Your Bodhi Zen Pure Land has engaged in group fights many times. Unfortunately, you've forgotten whose game this is."

Amid his laughter, he gave his sleeve a mighty shake. A prepared edict, condensed from thick, undiluted Nine Netherworld Evil Qi, suddenly flew out from his sleeve and soared into the sky.

The edict writhed violently like a living creature and instantly ignited on its own in the void.

A pitch-black flame shot into the sky, radiating a mysterious波动 that connected to an infinitely distant space.

"Dongming, Qingyuan, you two True Monarchs, if not now, when?! The guests are all here; it is time to feast!"

Pu Du True Monarch's voice was like an incantation, drawing a response from the heavens.

*Boom!*

The ground veins beneath the Zhenyuan Observatory trembled violently. An infinite amount of Yin Essence and Turbid Evil Qi, as if accumulated for millions of years, gushed forth violently like volcanic magma from an eruption, carrying a bone-biting chill that could freeze souls and a corrupting evil energy that could defile all things.

From within this churning Nine Netherworld Evil Qi, a figure in a wide, dark Daoist robe took a step out.

His face was blurry, as if constantly shrouded in twisting black qi. Only his eyes were visible, like two ghostly green fires set in the darkness, coldly watching the battlefield.

This was Dongming Xuansha True Monarch, master of the "Nine Abyss玄 Evil Dao Fruit." He wore a wide, dark Daoist robe, his face indistinct and blurry, as if constantly shrouded in twisting, writhing dark black evil qi.

Only his eyes were clearly visible.

"What pure and refined Buddhist bone relics. I shall capture you all and refine you into my newly crafted Xuanming Ten Thousand Ghost Banner to serve as the main artifact spirit. Its power will surely increase immensely!"

Dongming's voice was as cold as the Nine Netherworlds of ice. She raised a finger, and the gushing Nine Netherworld Xuan Evil Qi, like an awakened ancient demonic serpent, let out a silent, piercing shriek. It intertwined to form a black evil net that blotted out the sky and sun, fiercely entangling the churning Nihilistic Golden Lotus beneath the Great Awakening Bodhisattva's feet.

Almost simultaneously with Dongming's arrival, the eastern sky was also covered by an indescribably heavy pressure.

The clear, misty immortal light was instantly replaced by a more solid and profound青玄 brilliance.

A majestic, towering mountain shadow, as if bearing the entire sky and earth, descended from the ninth heaven, carrying an supreme will to suppress the four seas and eight directions.

A figure in a青 Daoist robe, with an ancient and solemn appearance, shrouded in the Dao rhyme of "Bearing Fate, Overseeing the Firmament, Holding Dominion over Mountains and Seas," appeared atop the mountain peak of ten thousand jun.

His gaze was indifferent as he looked down upon the battlefield.

This was the other True Monarch of the Primordial Origin Sect, Qingyuan True Monarch, master of the "Qingyuan Mysterious Dao, Bearing Fate, Overseeing the Firmament Dao Fruit."

"Foreign Buddhist disciple, overstepping your bounds in the Eastern Wasteland, disrupting my Primordial Origin Sect. In the name of Bearing Fate and Overseeing the Firmament, I shall suppress you."

Qingyuan's voice seemed to fall from a celestial palace in the ninth heaven—stable, vast, and beyond doubt.

He lightly swept his sleeve, and the immortal qi of the heavens suddenly condensed, transforming into a colossal jade-colored palm that blotted out the sky and sun. The lines on the palm flowed with the profound Dao rhyme of the clear qi of heaven and earth, carrying the force to shatter all techniques as it pressed down upon the Dharma Seal Bodhisattva.

*BOOM!*

A true cataclysm of heaven and earth.

In an instant, the Nihilistic Lotus Buddhist Fire and the Nine Netherworld Xuan Evil Serpent crashed violently into each other.

The violent collision of energy, the annihilation of power, erupted in a light more dazzling than the sun, instantly tearing the thick clouds within a hundred-mile radius into nothingness.

On the other side, the thousand-armed shadows of the Dharma Seal Bodhisattva instantly solidified, forming a hundred different divine and Buddhist treasure seals.

Each seal pulled upon the power of the laws of heaven and earth, condensing into a colossal琉璃 palm, flowing with the "万" character Buddhist light, which boldly met the mountain shadow that suppressed all ages.
