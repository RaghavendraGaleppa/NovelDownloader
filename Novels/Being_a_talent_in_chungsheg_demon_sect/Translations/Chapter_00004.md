Chapter 4: Impossible to Guard Against

"Madam is formed from the Innate One Qi. Qi refinement is self-refinement, purifying oneself, and reversing to the innate state, which can cultivate the true fruit of Innate One Qi, marvelous in both form and spirit."

After a long while, Lu Yang opened his eyes, a look of delight on his face.

Compared to the *Great Yin-Yang Pleasure Rhapsody*, the *Innate Dao Scripture* truly possessed the appearance of a complete legacy.

The entire Dao Scripture, starting from a mortal, began with a set of Innate Cultivation techniques to temper the physique upon entry, even including a配套 martial art called the Grand Innate Seizing Art.

After the physique reached perfection, the cultivator would then begin "reversing to the innate," first transforming the five viscera and six bowels, then the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones, until finally completely dissolving the physical form, refining the body into a strand of Innate True Qi. From then on, one could appear and disappear unpredictably, be difficult to harm with Daoist magic, and stand invincible in battle against others.

In addition, the Dao Scripture also recorded many spells that could be used in conjunction with Innate True Qi.

Such a comprehensive range of spells, including the Sky Net Dust Mist Smoke, the One-Mind True Qi Sword, and the Spirit Breath Inhalation Art, with their diverse functions, greatly broadened Lu Yang's horizons.

However, just then, Lu Yang, who had been engrossed in the text, suddenly froze.

"...It's gone?"

Lu Yang subconsciously looked up at Liu Xin, only to realize that the *Innate Dao Scripture* in his hand was only the first half, and the content had abruptly ceased.

"Junior Brother, the Dao cannot be easily imparted."

Liu Xin chuckled softly, "The latter half of the *Innate Dao Scripture* concerns the secrets of Foundation Establishment, and it's not included in the sect's welfare benefits. You'll need to exchange it with contribution points."

Lu Yang shook his head helplessly upon hearing this. "So that's how it is. This Junior Brother was presumptuous."

"No worries, half a Dao Scripture is enough for you to cultivate, Junior Brother."

Liu Xin patted Lu Yang's shoulder kindly. "Come, I'll take you to Mending Heaven Peak to select a cave mansion. Choose a good spot; it'll be easier for us to visit each other often in the future."

Lu Yang nodded. "Thank you, Senior Brother."

Half an hour later, on Mending Heaven Peak.

At a secluded cave mansion at the foot of the mountain, Lu Yang officially settled in. The original furniture and artifacts within the cave mansion were cleared out like trash.

Watching this scene, Lu Yang's mind was filled with thoughts.

"It seems even formal disciples don't have it easy..."

Mending Heaven Peak wasn't large, and the Initial Saint Sect had so many registered disciples each year. Even with a promotion rate of one in ten thousand, it should be enough to fill Mending Heaven Peak.

But what was the reality?

As Lu Yang walked, Mending Heaven Peak was far from overcrowded; it was even somewhat empty, with many cave mansions vacant and no disciples residing in them.

Where did all those formal disciples go? Surely they couldn't afford to rent cave mansions, could they?

Lu Yang shook his head, not delving deeper. Instead, he took out a futon and sat down, then assumed the five-heart-centered posture, beginning his first cultivation session inside the cave mansion.

It was fine when he wasn't cultivating, but once he did, Lu Yang immediately felt nearly twice as much Heaven and Earth spiritual energy pouring in compared to the outer sect. It all surged into his Dantian, then circulated throughout his entire body via the meridians, finally integrating from the outside in, step by step, into his five viscera and six bowels, skin, flesh, tendons, and bones.

The efficiency was so high that Lu Yang was astonished.

In the same amount of time, using the same cultivation method, the True Qi he could refine in a day in the outer sect only took one hour to achieve in the inner sect cave mansion.

"No wonder inner sect cave mansions cost money to rent."

It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, but difficult to revert. Once one experienced the speed of cultivation inside a cave mansion, it would be hard to endure cultivating anywhere else.

The next day, Lu Yang did not go out. Instead, he stayed in his cave mansion, cultivating while reading the Innate Dao Scripture.

"Although cultivation in this world also depends on talent, there's no mention of spirit roots. Basically, anyone with a dedicated heart can embark on the path of cultivation."

That being said, cultivation did not become much easier.

Because while mortals entering the Dao of cultivation were not limited by spirit roots, the grade of True Qi refined could still determine a cultivator's highest future achievement.

This was the function of the "Dao Law" (cultivation technique).

The more advanced the cultivation technique, the higher the grade of True Qi extracted, and the greater the likelihood of reaching higher realms in the future. Conversely, the more likely one was to encounter bottlenecks.

True Qi had nine grades and thirty-six ranks. The lower the grade number, the more superior; the higher the rank, the more powerful.

Generally, True Qi below the seventh grade meant no chance of Foundation Establishment, below the third grade made Golden Core difficult to achieve, and without first-grade True Qi, forming a Nascent Soul was a near-certain death.

"Rogue cultivators truly have no path forward," Lu Yang couldn't help but sigh. Compared to large sects with complete legacies, rogue cultivators had no room to choose cultivation techniques; they practiced whatever they could get their hands on.

In such circumstances, even with high talent and comprehension, one would lose at the starting line, ultimately left with lifelong regrets.

The difficulty of immortal cultivation was evident.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang gradually frowned.

"The 'Innate True Qi' extracted by the *Innate Dao Scripture* is ranked first in the sixth grade. Cultivators have hope for Foundation Establishment, which strictly speaking, is not weak."

However, it still fell short of his expectations.

If he were just an ordinary cultivator, that would be fine.

But he now possessed a rare treasure like the [Book of Hundred Lives], which meant his future was practically guaranteed. A cultivation technique that stopped at Foundation Establishment could no longer satisfy his ambitions.

"If only I could have a supreme legacy ranked first-grade..."

Lu Yang fantasized for a moment, then sighed, "Forget it, the path must be taken one step at a time. Taking too big a step might just tear your groin."

"First, I'll cultivate the Innate Dao Scripture, become a Foundation Establishment Grand Cultivator..."

Once the Dao Foundation was established, one could live for three hundred years, almost equivalent to a human dynasty. In the cultivation world, one could be called a "Grand Cultivator."

Once he had the strength, he would seek higher legacies, and upon obtaining them, he would immediately restart his cultivation.

Repeating this cycle, his dreams would eventually come true.

As long as he had patience and didn't rush, time would always be on his side. This was the confidence the [Book of Hundred Lives] gave Lu Yang.

Ten days later, Lu Yang's cave mansion.

A white qi steamed and billowed, suddenly transforming into rolling black smoke, then into an invisible qi sword, and finally into an ethereal, immortal-like figure.

"I succeeded!"

Although the Innate Dao Scripture was profound, it was not difficult to cultivate. In just ten days, Lu Yang had successfully dissolved his form and refined his body into a strand of True Qi.

[Name: Lu Yang]
[Lifespan: 18]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining Layer 1]
[Talent: Deviant Genius (White)]
[Cultivation Techniques: Great Yin-Yang Pleasure Rhapsody (Mastered), Innate Qi Refining Body Transformation Art (Mastered)]
[Divine Abilities: None]
[Treasures: None]
[Book of Hundred Lives Pages: 99]

Looking at the updated information on the Book of Hundred Lives, Lu Yang trod on air, feeling in peak condition. Even his old ailment had healed without medicine.

"Hmm?"

Suddenly, Lu Yang, who was feeling immensely pleased with himself, frowned and abruptly stopped his movements. He then looked at the [Book of Hundred Lives] again, falling into a strange contemplation.

"...Something's wrong."

It seemed he had overlooked something.

Lu Yang subconsciously recalled his current life: he hadn't encountered any difficulties, he had smoothly become a formal disciple, he had smoothly received the Innate Dao Scripture...

The next second, Lu Yang finally realized what he had overlooked.

[After plundering your vital essence, Yu Suzen has already broken through to the Qi Refining realm. However, due to her deep-seated illness, which True Qi found difficult to dispel, she was bedridden for several months and eventually died from severe illness.]

In the previous life, why did Senior Sister Yu die?

Since she was a formal disciple, she must have also received the Innate Dao Scripture. If she had successfully cultivated it, transforming her form into Qi, how could she have died from a minor illness?

She didn't succeed in cultivating it?

"Impossible!" Lu Yang shook his head.

The Innate Dao Scripture was not difficult to cultivate. Since Yu Suzen had the ability to break through to the Qi Refining realm, even if her aptitude was poor, she couldn't possibly fail to cultivate it for several months.

"Unless, what she cultivated wasn't the Innate Dao Scripture!"

At this instant, Lu Yang felt as if he had fallen into an ice cavern.

His heart pounded clearer than ever before, his breathing became rapid, and the excited expression swiftly faded from Lu Yang's face:

"The Innate Dao Scripture... was it specifically prepared for me by Liu Xin?"

Lu Yang thought of the scene he had witnessed earlier in the Refinement Hall.

That registered disciple in the Refinement Hall had thought he had achieved great success in the Dao, but he had merely sought his own demise. Not only did he fail to break through, but he also refined himself into a magic treasure.

At that time and place, exactly like this time and place?

Just then, a familiar and warm call suddenly came from outside the cave mansion:

"Junior Brother Lu, are you there?"
