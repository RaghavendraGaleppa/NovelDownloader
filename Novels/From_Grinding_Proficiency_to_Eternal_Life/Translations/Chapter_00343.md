# Chapter 343: Nine Realm, One Against Two

"Boom!"

Xu Yunfan was sent flying backward by the punch, crashing through seven palace walls before stopping a hundred zhang away.

The ferocious force was quickly dispersed by his Dragon Scale Armor, leaving him completely unharmed. However, he was inwardly shocked: "This brute's physical body is as strong as a seventh-grade divine weapon!"

Moreover, this was the first time he had encountered someone who could compete with him in terms of raw strength.

Xu Yunfan looked down. The dragon patterns on the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace had been ground down by three inches by the fist qi.

Chu Sheng seized the advantage without mercy. He stepped on the "Nine曜 Steps," transforming into a falling meteor of fire, pursuing and attacking.

Every step left a burning golden footprint in the air. After nine steps, his speed broke through the sound barrier, and a conical shockwave cloud condensed before his fist.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained calm. He activated the Ten Extremities True Qi, which surged through his flesh and skin like a great river. A luster of jade marrow and golden bones appeared on his surface.

"Ten Extremities, Return to the Void!"

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace suddenly split into ten shadows, corresponding to the attributes of the Ten Extremities True Qi.

Chu Sheng's fist intent was dissolved layer by layer. Finally, the mace shadows merged into one and stabbed toward his throat.

Chu Sheng didn't dodge or evade, actually using his neck to硬接 the mace. Sparks flew, leaving only a white mark.

He took the opportunity to grab the shaft of the mace, roared, and swung Xu Yunfan along with the weapon, smashing him violently toward the ground.

"Bang!"

Amidst a earth-shaking roar, Xu Yunfan was embedded three zhang deep into the earth.

Chu Sheng was about to follow up with a "Great Sun Falling Star Drop" when he suddenly felt an unbearable burning pain in his palm. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace had turned red hot like a branding iron at some unknown time. Nine dragon scales at the handle of the mace, reverse scales, stood upright and pierced into the flesh of his hand.

"Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall."

Xu Yunfan's voice came from the bottom of the pit.

Chu Sheng realized with a start that his vital energy and blood were being frantically sucked away. He hurriedly activated the "Great Sun Glazed Body" to suppress it.

Taking advantage of this momentary gap, Xu Yunfan broke out of the earth. His mace technique changed abruptly, turning into a sky full of red rainbows that enveloped Chu Sheng.

The two fought fiercely for over three hundred moves. The explosions caused by the collision of Nine曜 True Qi and Ten Extremities True Qi flattened an entire district.

Just as Xu Yunfan and Chu Sheng were locked in a heated battle, a cold sword light suddenly tore through the battlefield!

The Watch Mountain Taoist had been lying in ambush for a long time. Now, seizing the moment when Xu Yunfan's mace momentum was retracting, he struck out fiercely!

The long sword at his waist left its sheath. Before the blade reached, the sword intent was already like a dragon and tiger entwined, roaring to the heavens!

"Dragon Tiger Subduing Demon Sword!"

The sword light split. The sword qi on the left was like a blue dragon extending its claw, while the right was like a white tiger pouncing. The two completely different sword intents actually merged perfectly, turning into a brilliant streak that slashed straight at Xu Yunfan's back heart!

This sword was the sect-defining ultimate technique of the Xuanzhen Sect. It required the催动 of Dragon Tiger Pill Qi. When the sword was unleashed, dragons and tigers followed, capable of cutting through evil spirits and breaking through protective qi!

Even a Nine Realm Grand Master, if unprepared, would be heavily injured by this sword!

However...

"Clang!"

Without looking back, Xu Yunfan reversed the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace and blocked horizontally. The dragon patterns on the mace body lit up suddenly, blocking accurately in the critical moment!

Sparks splashed, and the sword qi dissipated!

The Watch Mountain Taoist's pupils constricted, and he was horrified: "He can actually split his focus like this?!"

Xu Yunfan kicked Chu Sheng away and glanced sideways at the Watch Mountain Taoist. He grinned, his fighting spirit even more intense: "The Dragon Tiger Sword of the Xuanzhen Sect? Not much!"

Before the words faded, he exerted force suddenly. The mace body shook, actually knocking the Watch Mountain Taoist's long sword away forcefully!

At the same time, Ten Extremities True Qi rushed into the soles of his feet, turning into a soft force. His figure moved like a ghost, sliding three zhang sideways,恰好 avoiding Chu Sheng's轰来的 "Great Sun Red Fire Fist"!

Seeing this, Chu Sheng roared in anger. Golden flames surged all over his body. Nine sun totems flowed on his skin, and his fist momentum increased by another thirty percent!

"Xu Yunfan! Let's see how long you can keep dodging!"

His fists were like falling meteors. Every strike carried scorching true qi that could melt gold and iron, causing the air to burn and twist with explosive cracks!

Xu Yunfan didn't dodge or evade. Ten Extremities True Qi surged through his body like a wild tide, and the luster of jade marrow and golden bones on his surface became even brighter.

He held the mace with both hands, and his mace technique changed abruptly, actually dealing with two great experts simultaneously!

"Ten Extremities, Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall, Sky Net and Earth Trap!"

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace split into a hundred mace shadows. Every shadow contained Ten Extremities True Qi of different attributes: some fierce like a mountain, some soft like water, some scorching like fire, some cold as ice...

The mace shadows interwove into a net, actually blocking Chu Sheng's fist qi and the Watch Mountain Taoist's sword qi completely!

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The moment the three forces collided, the world went silent for an instant. Then...

"Boom!!!"

The explosion sounded like a divine thunder exploding in the nine heavens, shaking roof tiles off buildings within a hundred zhang!

The ground cracked inch by inch under the violent impact. Spider-web-like fissures spread frantically. Green stone tiles were flipped into the air and then pulverized into dust by the shockwave.

Century-old locust trees on both sides of the main street in the Imperial City were uprooted. Tree trunks twisted and exploded in the violent qi, wood chips pouring down like a storm!

Martial artists watching from a distance were terrified. Those with weaker cultivation had blood flowing from their ears and nose, stumbling and falling.

"Retreat! Retreat quickly!"

Someone roared hoarsely, their voice trembling with fear.

The crowd scattered like a tidal wave. Those with good lightness techniques fled over rooftops. Those who reacted slowly were overturned by the shockwave, rolling into shops on the street like tumbleweeds.

The gilded plaque of the Drunken Immortal Pavilion fell with a crash, crushing an Iron River Sect disciple and breaking his bones.

Further away, several inner disciples of the Xuanzhen Sect couldn't dodge in time. They were hit by flying stones in the back, instantly staining their robes with blood.

In a pavilion three hundred zhang away, a young man in brocade who had been watching the battle turned pale. The tea cup in his hand shattered with a "pop."

The purple-robed elder beside him rolled his sleeves, condensing a three-chi wall of qi, but was still shaken back three steps by the shockwave. The wooden boards under his feet snapped with a "crack."

"The clash of Nine Realm experts is actually this terrifying..."

The elder's beard trembled. He suddenly grabbed the young man's collar and retreated violently. "Young Master, leave quickly! Get out of the city immediately. The Jade Capital City is about to collapse!"

In the swirling dust, the place where Xu Yunfan's Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace was locked with the two enemies was vaguely visible. The ground had collapsed into a three-zhang deep giant pit.

At the bottom of the pit, magma-like red-gold true qi, frost-white sword qi, and dark-purple evil qi entangled and tore at each other, grinding everything they touched into dust!

The Watch Mountain Taoist grew more terrified as he fought. He had thought that Xu Yunfan had just broken through to the Nine Realm and lacked foundation, but now the opponent could actually fight one against two, and even seemed to have the upper hand!

"This kid... is truly a monster!"

Chu Sheng was equally shocked. He prided himself on having an invincible physical body, yet Xu Yunfan's physique was not inferior to his. Furthermore, the mystery of the Ten Extremities True Qi far surpassed the "Great Sun Glazed Body" of the Nine曜 Sect!

After three hundred moves, Xu Yunfan's attacks became even sharper, his mace technique flowing like clouds and water without any stagnation.

"Ten Extremities, Return to Origin!"

He changed techniques abruptly. The mace shadows merged into one. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace turned into a red rainbow, stabbing straight at Chu Sheng's chest!

Chu Sheng crossed his arms in a hurry to block, but was blasted back ten zhang by the mace. The golden flames on his arms dimmed, and his vital energy and blood were churned up by the impact!

Seeing this, the Watch Mountain Taoist hurriedly waved his sword to rescue him, but Xu Yunfan had anticipated this. His figure flashed, actually using the ultimate speed of the Ten Extremities Martial Way to绕 to his back!

"Senior Watch Mountain, your sword... is too slow!"
