# Chapter 211: The Immortal Welcome Banquet, an Unexpected Turn of Events

Within the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven, on a vast immortal island teeming with abundant spiritual energy.

"Junior Brother Yang, are you confident today?" A calm voice suddenly cut through the continuous, melodious immortal music drifting into their ears.

The speaker was a young man of noble bearing, dressed in a moon-white magic robe. As he spoke, his gaze slowly drifted away from the swaying immortal dancers before him and turned to the stern-faced man in black robes seated beside him. A faint smile graced his lips.

Upon hearing the question, the black-robed man withdrew his gaze and respectfully replied, "Senior Brother Jun, please rest assured. As a Golden Core Realm cultivator, even if I suppress my cultivation, I am absolutely no match for a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

"Junior Brother Yang, don't be careless. That junior brother was the top Foundation Establishment cultivator in this Proud Cloud Secret Realm, and in the final ranking battle, he successively defeated a prince from the Human Emperor Dao Court and a royal creature from the Myriad Spirits Faction of All Heavens, both at the Foundation Establishment Realm." The white-robed man paused, his smile deepening. "His strength should not be underestimated."

"Haha, Senior Brother, please set your mind at ease. If I don't win, this junior brother will commit suicide on the spot as an apology!" Hearing his senior brother's reminder, the black-robed man's face flashed with a hint of nonchalance. No matter how strong that junior brother was, he was still only at the Foundation Establishment Realm. How could he possibly pose a threat? After all, the Golden Core Realm and Foundation Establishment Realm were worlds apart. Even if he suppressed his cultivation to the Foundation Establishment Realm, the opponent would have absolutely no chance of victory. This was a terrifying, fundamental disparity!

"Haha, that's good then. But when you spar with him later, you must be careful. The Nine Breaths Stone Talisman is a treasure I retrieved from the clan's treasury; its aura-altering effect only lasts for two hours at a time. Also, you must crush him utterly! After this matter is completed, I will personally arrange for you, Junior Brother, to cultivate in the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven." The white-robed man instructed with a smile.

"Understood, thank you, Senior Brother." The black-robed man said excitedly, a glint of determination flashing in his eyes.

Seeing this, the white-robed man nodded slightly. Then, as if he thought of something, a touch of unnaturalness flickered across his face. To think that their Heaven Realm Lineage, which had always produced numerous prodigies, had now fallen to the point where a Golden Core Realm cultivator had to impersonate a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator just to be confident in suppressing that junior brother. How humiliating would that sound if it got out? But they couldn't do it any other way.

Regardless, they *must* suppress that junior brother this time, to let those from the Lower Realm Nine Regions Lineage know who truly held power within the Grotto-Heaven, and even within the Dao Sect! The top Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm? What did that even count for?

Meanwhile, not far from the white-robed man, Xuan Yuan's eyes were half-closed, as if his mind was drifting in another world. He seemed utterly unconcerned with the ongoing Immortal Welcome Banquet. Yet, beneath his wide magic robe, his index finger lightly tapping his knee seemed to reveal something. Clearly, his heart was not as calm as it appeared on the surface.

"Senior Brother, those people's objective..." A hint of worry flashed across Gu Yao's face beside him.

As his voice fell, Xuan Yuan suddenly opened his eyes. His gaze first swept over the numerous disciples of the Heaven Realm Lineage seated below, then shifted to the disciples of the Lower Realm Nine Regions Lineage, who were sharply contrasted with them on the other side. Finally, his gaze settled on an empty seat not far from him. Among the names of the Dharma Idol Realm cultivators, the name 'Zhang Jing' stood out prominently.

"An abnormality implies a demon. Senior Brother Jun's Immortal Welcome Banquet has intentions as clear as day! It's obviously aimed at Junior Brother Zhang Jing," Xuan Yuan sighed. "It's just that, even so, why would it alarm Senior Sister Kong?"

Gu Yao subconsciously glanced at the few meditation cushions on the highest platform, a hint of confusion and reverence in his voice. "Most likely for Senior Brother Feng." Xuan Yuan sneered. "Even we know that Junior Brother Zhang Jing has an excellent relationship with Senior Brother Feng. Would they not know? I imagine, if Senior Sister Kong hadn't arrived, whether they would even dare to hold this Immortal Welcome Banquet would be another question."

"Are we just going to stand by and watch these people scheme against Junior Brother like this?" Gu Yao's expression flickered with a mix of indignation and dejection.

"With Senior Sister Kong arriving, what can we do? Now we can only hope that Senior Brother Feng can offer some assistance. Besides, Junior Brother Zhang Jing is still a registered disciple of a True Monarch; they wouldn't dare to go too far, one would think." Xuan Yuan's voice was calm. However, the hand hidden in his magic robe's sleeve involuntarily clenched tightly, then slowly loosened again. A sense of powerlessness suddenly arose within him. How could he not understand the intentions of those people from the Heaven Realm Lineage? He knew, but knowing did not change the fact that as a senior brother, he could do nothing.

***

Time flowed slowly. Most of the disciples within the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven had arrived.

Suddenly, the white-robed man seated higher up rose to his feet, a faint, almost imperceptible smile gracing his lips. He announced in a clear voice, "Cough, cough, everyone, please be quiet."

"The reason for holding this Immortal Welcome Banquet today is twofold: On one hand, it is to welcome Junior Brother Zhang Jing, as well as other junior brothers and sisters who have joined the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven in the past century, becoming members of our Grotto-Heaven disciples."

"And on the other hand, it is also to seize this opportune moment for everyone to discuss the Dao together, hoping to achieve progress."

The scene instantly fell silent. Countless gazes of reverence fell upon the white-robed man. However, he seemed not to notice these gazes, simply surveying the scene below. After a moment, he looked towards the seat previously reserved for Zhang Jing. When he found it empty, a peculiar glint flashed in his eyes. Did he truly believe he could avoid this by not attending? He shook his head slightly.

Then, he turned to the burly man behind him. "Qing Fang, you personally delivered the invitation to Junior Brother Zhang Jing, right? Why has he not arrived yet?"

Upon hearing this, Qing Fang's rugged face broke into a knowing smile. He respectfully stood up, and a voice tinged with a hint of grievance instantly resonated in everyone's ears. "Reporting to Senior Brother, this junior brother indeed delivered the invitation into Junior Brother Zhang Jing's hands. As for why he has not come today, perhaps there is some special reason."

"Presumptuous!" the white-robed man's reprimand immediately followed. "So many junior brothers and sisters are present; who among us doesn't have matters to attend to? Yet, we all made time to gather here, didn't we?" He paused, as if to compose himself, then continued, "Never mind. It seems Junior Brother Zhang Jing's time is rather precious. But to act in such a manner is somewhat—"

His words were cut short. A figure with a massive head, holding an invitation high in both hands, came running in a hurried but unpanicked manner. As he ran, he kept shouting, "Coming, coming! My master is currently in secluded cultivation, so he specially sent me here. I hope you esteemed elders will not take offense."

A mere mount? How dare he?

The white-robed man's face instantly alternated between green and white. He was naturally well-informed about Junior Brother Zhang Jing's background, so with just one glance, he recognized the newcomer as the other party's mount, also from the Lower Realm Nine Regions. As Deer Thirty-Eight was about to head towards Zhang Jing's seat, the man's gaze turned cold, and a terrifyingly subtle fluctuation of spiritual power swept over.

***

The next moment, Deer Thirty-Eight's body suddenly froze, unable to move an inch. Simultaneously, a cold voice boomed across the venue. "A beast knows no etiquette, but does Junior Brother Zhang Jing not understand decorum either? Have your master come personally; I believe all the junior brothers and sisters present require an explanation from him."

With that, before the terror on Deer Thirty-Eight's face could dissipate, his frozen body was seized by an invisible hand, about to be thrown off the island.

On the other side, without much thought, the seated Xuan Yuan suddenly stood up, a golden flicker of firelight in his eyes. "Senior Brother Jun, Junior Brother Zhang Jing already stated he is in secluded cultivation. Is your action perhaps a bit too much?" He extended his hand. Deer Thirty-Eight, who had been thrown out, was pulled back, and the power that had bound his body was dispelled.

"Junior Brother Xuan, if Junior Brother Zhang Jing were truly in secluded cultivation, he should have informed me in advance, instead of dispatching a beast to humiliate everyone at the Immortal Welcome Banquet." The white-robed man sneered, "We are all Grotto-Heaven disciples! Do I still need to teach you such simple道理, you from the Lower Realm Nine Regions Lineage?"

"You—" Xuan Yuan was furious, but under the gaze of numerous junior brothers and sisters below, he didn't know how to refute. Indeed, in the face of these people's schemes, he felt that Junior Brother Zhang Jing's approach was most appropriate. He couldn't possibly step into a trap knowingly, like an idiot. But—they ultimately had no evidence for this, nor could they. This made Junior Brother Zhang Jing's actions seem somewhat in the wrong.

After much thought, Xuan Yuan couldn't find a suitable explanation. He could only swallow his frustration and say in a muffled voice, "This... this was indeed Junior Brother Zhang Jing's oversight. I will give a satisfactory answer to all the junior brothers and sisters present later."

"Ah, Junior Brother Xuan," the white-robed man persisted, "why are you so quick to take over Junior Brother Zhang Jing's matter? In my opinion, it would be better for him to come personally and explain now. Besides, we are not petty people. If Junior Brother Zhang Jing has a legitimate reason, then this matter can simply be put behind us."

Looking at Senior Brother Jun's half-smile, Xuan Yuan's expression hardened, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. His voice subtly turned icy. "Senior Brother, must you push things to the extreme today?"

"Junior Brother Xuan, why do you say such a thing?" Senior Brother Jun, dressed in white robes, feigned incomprehension. However, the smile in his eyes grew even brighter.

Just then, a voice, suppressed with anger and as clear as a spring, suddenly rang out. "Enough! You shame yourselves and don't even realize it. Return to your seats."

Hearing this, the white-robed Senior Brother Jun shivered and instinctively looked towards the platform. A female figure, bathed in boundless, bright yellow immortal light, appeared before his eyes.

The next moment, "Greetings, Senior Sister Kong!" Everyone in the hall rose and bowed towards the figure on the high platform.

"Everyone, please rise." Senior Sister Kong's spring-like voice sounded again.

Then, with a gentle flick of her slender hand, Deer Thirty-Eight slowly vanished from his spot and reappeared on Zhang Jing's seat.

Witnessing this, the white-robed Senior Brother Jun's breathing hitched. He then looked at Senior Sister Kong on the platform and said with considerable resentment, "Reporting to Senior Sister Kong, how can a mere mount sit among us?"

"You look again."

What did that mean? Ignoring Senior Sister Kong's change in attitude, Senior Brother Jun suddenly turned his head, his gaze fixed on Deer Thirty-Eight. In his sight, a Chaos Dao Seal, suffused with a hazy purple aura, slowly emerged from the center of Deer Thirty-Eight's brows. It looked utterly noble and majestic.
