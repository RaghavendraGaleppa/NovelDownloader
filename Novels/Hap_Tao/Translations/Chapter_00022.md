# Chapter 22: Blood-Nourishing Pills

This was the largest pharmacy in the western district of the outer city, staffed by three resident physicians and even more apprentices. Among martial practitioners, however, the "Benefit Origin Hall" was most famous not for its physicians' medical skills, but for its two specialty pills—the "Blood-Nourishing Pills" and the "Origin-Supplementing Pills"—from which the pharmacy derived its name.

Both pills replenished qi and blood, with the former costing one tael of silver per pill and the latter ten taels. For ordinary citizens of Fangsuo City, whose monthly income averaged only two or three taels, these were far beyond their means. In his nearly three years of martial training, Qin Ziling had only purchased three Blood-Nourishing Pills—yet today, he bought three in one go.

For martial artists seeking to strengthen their blood qi, diligent training had to be supplemented with ample meat consumption. However, meat could only fill the stomach so much; no matter how large one's appetite, there was a limit to how much could be eaten. Moreover, most meat contained only trace amounts of blood-nourishing essence, with the bulk ending up as waste. The flesh, blood, and bones of fierce beasts like tigers, black bears, and dragon eagles—creatures abundant in qi and blood—were far more potent than ordinary meat, not to mention the rarer meat of magical beasts. But such creatures were difficult to hunt, and magical beasts were even scarcer.

Thus, for wealthy martial artists, regular meat was akin to daily rice, while precious medicinal pills served as their occasional supplements. If Qin Ziling wanted to enhance his blood qi quickly, he couldn't rely on ordinary meat. The previous night, he had hunted a pheasant, two rabbits, and a red muntjac—enough to last him several days of heavy eating, yet the actual blood qi conversion would still be minimal. 

Selling his game to purchase expensive but easily absorbed blood-nourishing pills was the logical choice. Of course, this luxury was only feasible because Qin Ziling possessed exceptional hunting skills, confident in his ability to sustain a steady supply of game.

After buying the pills, he found a secluded spot to remove his disguise and resumed his usual appearance before heading to the martial hall. Along the way, he swallowed one Blood-Nourishing Pill. Slightly smaller than a longan, the pill emitted a faint herbal fragrance with a barely detectable hint of blood. As it settled in his stomach, Qin Ziling—now acutely sensitive to bodily changes—soon felt warmth spreading through his abdomen, his blood surging with renewed vigor.

*"These really are excellent, but so expensive! A single pill costs nearly a month's worth of rice for an average family—gone in an instant."* Qin Ziling marveled inwardly at the pulsating energy within him, his steps unconsciously quickening. This surge of blood qi was the perfect time for training.

By the time he arrived at the martial hall, most students were already present—some engrossed in practice, others chatting during breaks. Zuo Le, as usual, sat leisurely beneath a tree, sipping tea. Just as Qin Ziling was about to greet him, snippets of conversation nearby caught his ear.

"Liu Xiaoqiang is done for this time!"  
"True. Those who dare enter the martial arena are no pushovers. People die or get maimed there every year. Yet Liu, relying on his brute strength, refused to settle for mediocrity and insisted on testing his luck. Now look—his limbs are broken. Even if he recovers, he'll never lift or carry anything again. A cripple for life. With no family and everything of value already sold for training, he'll likely end up a beggar."  
"Worse—his injuries are so severe that if not for the hall master sending help and a physician, he'd have died there last night. He survived the night, but how long can he last alone in bed, with no care or money for further treatment? A few days at most."

Qin Ziling's expression darkened. He strode forward and demanded, "Liu Xiaoqiang fought in the arena yesterday?" Among all the students, Liu Xiaoqiang was his closest friend. Just two days prior, Liu had mentioned the arena but implied he needed more time. Qin Ziling had even planned to share one of his Blood-Nourishing Pills to aid him. Now, this shocking news greeted him upon arrival.

"Yes, it was a last-minute arrangement," replied one student. "Liu won two matches but lost the third. His opponent was vicious and broke through to the Iron Skin level mid-fight, shattering Liu's limbs." 

Arena matches typically pitted fighters of equal levels, though challengers could opt to face opponents one minor tier higher. Liu Xiaoqiang, eager to catch the eye of wealthy patrons or powerful factions, had chosen to challenge beyond his rank. With his natural strength, even a loss shouldn't have been so devastating—yet he had the misfortune of encountering a ruthless opponent who advanced during their duel.

Without another word, Qin Ziling turned and left, not even bothering to acknowledge Zuo Le.

"What's he doing?"  
"Worried about Liu, obviously. They were close."  
"What can he do? With Liu's condition and Qin's own humble means? At best, he'll pay a visit."  

As the students murmured, Nan Gongyue watched Qin Ziling's abrupt departure with a smirk of disdain and schadenfreude.

Liu Xiaoqiang's home was in Xianhe District, three alleys and a small river away from the martial hall's Xianyuan District. Qin Ziling soon arrived at the dilapidated single-room house. Pushing open the door, a pungent mix of odors assaulted his senses. 

Inside, the two-meter-tall, once-brawny Liu Xiaoqiang lay sprawled on the floor, inching forward with agonizing effort. His outstretched hand strained toward a cleaver placed just beyond reach. 

The sight struck Qin Ziling like a physical blow, a pang of sorrow gripping his heart. In that moment, he saw a reflection of his past self—not from injury, but from the relentless progression of ALS. Back then, he too had faced days of unbearable struggle, repeatedly contemplating suicide before choosing to endure, clinging to hope for a medical miracle.
