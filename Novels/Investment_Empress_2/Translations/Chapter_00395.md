Chapter 395: Here Again? Did You Two Plan This?

In front of the main peak hall of the Qingyuan Sect, the elders and all the true disciples stood waiting before the steps outside the hall, all of them silent.

Thanks to a certain "Little Overlord with a Divine Hammer," a proper reward ceremony was very likely to turn into a reprimand.

The Great Yu Empire did indeed co-govern the world with the sects, and there was nominally no relationship of ruler and subject. In fact, during the thousands of years since the founding of the Great Yu, there had even been instances where sects rose in rebellion.

Facts had proven that it was better to maintain a sense of awe towards the imperial family.

"Our ancestors weathered the chaotic times when the great tower collapsed; it's not as if the sky is falling now," Shangguan Wencang said solemnly, sweeping his gaze over the elders.

Then, he looked up at the sky, calculating the time in his heart. "The Crown Prince should be arriving soon... By the way."

"Where are Li Mo and Ying Bing?"

Come to think of it, these two little fellows were the main characters. Jiang Yu hadn't come to inspect the Qingyuan Sect, a minor sect, in the first place.

......

The next morning.

The room was no longer covered in a dense layer of frost, but a faint, cool fragrance lingered in the air.

Ying Bing opened her eyes on the bed, subconsciously glancing at the empty space beside her. In the past, the first thing she did upon waking was to check if the long sword beside her was still there, but at some point, this habit of hers had changed.

"Forty-Nine Forms..."

Ying Bing put away the Jade Phoenix Spirit. Her Hundred Birds Phoenix Form had now, to a preliminary extent, caught up with her Lunar Spirit Intent, meaning the two were beginning to complement each other.

Although she was still at the Six Apertures of Divine Perception Realm, her soul intent had made great progress compared to yesterday.

"Before reaching the Divine Perception Realm, I must fuse the two Spirit Intents into one furnace... then step into the Inner Scene."

"In doing so, I can manifest the scene of the Lunar Moon Phoenix."

Fusing Spirit Intents is a difficult and perilous path, one that many outstanding figures have attempted to walk.

Including the number one on the Hidden Dragon List, the Crown Prince of Great Yu.

But to her knowledge, throughout history, the only person who has been able to merge two Great Dao Divine Forms into one is her, in both her lifetimes.

Suddenly, that annoying system rang out again:

[Reminder: This system has not opened a ranking for a year. Have you forgotten about me, Host?]

"It hasn't been a year."

[The year has passed, so it is naturally a year. Moreover, this system just detected emotional fluctuations from the Host.]

A magical system algorithm.

Ying Bing had indeed been contemplating whether to open the ranking again just now. But after furrowing her brow slightly and thinking it over, she still put the idea aside for the time being. She would wait until after visiting the Broken Axe Mountain.

Her sword intent was perfected during the gathering of Hidden Dragon prodigies in the Imperial Capital in her previous life, forged by defeating countless heroes from all sides. Now, she planned to walk this path once more.

"I must defeat him fairly and squarely at least once..."

"Ice Cube."

At that moment, Li Mo's voice came from outside.

"It's time to set off."

"Mm."

The slender and tall girl also changed her clothes. The Lunar Immortal Skirt covered the white shirt that outlined her exquisite figure, turning her clarity into an ethereal elegance.

She pushed the door open and saw Li Mo standing before her, wearing the Pure Yang Robe.

Somehow, they had a tacit understanding and were dressed in matching... well, training outfits.

The two left the Autumn Water Pavilion together. As they walked, Li Mo glanced at his master's room. Don't get him wrong; the gentlemanly Li Mo did not have any bad habits like peeping.

Hmm, good. After chugging two bottles of Immortal's Drunk, his master was sprawled out, snoring loudly and peacefully.

Whoosh—

"It's pretty cold," Li Mo said, flexing his fingers. Feeling he had nowhere to put his hands, he could only scratch his own neck, leaving a few red marks in the process.

Little Overlord Li has a fiery temper.

The red marks reflected in Ying Bing's eyes were somewhat startling...

The image of a woman sitting in a man's lap, as if trying to devour him, leaving marks on his neck after a stormy kiss... looked somewhat similar, though the shapes were different.

---

I... what am I thinking?

The tranquility in Ying Bing's eyes trembled slightly, and she lowered her small hand.

Thus, Little Li was stunned for a moment.

In his originally aimless hand, a cool, soft palm was placed.

"I told you it's cold. Your hands are frozen," he said.

"...Mm, a little," the Ice Cube replied softly after a few seconds of silence, nodding slightly.

"See, I told you. And according to my professional knowledge, cold starts from the feet. So if your hands are cold, your feet probably aren't warm either."

Li Mo spoke seriously, sounding very reasonable.

As he spoke, he let go of her hand, seemingly intending to verify his own theory. Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. Even as a technician, one should always seek truth through practice!

How can you know if Schrödinger's cat is dead or alive without opening the box?

How can you know... without taking off her little boots?

"?"

Seeing Ying Bing looking at him with a profound gaze, Little Li Technician coughed lightly, his gaze clearing as he looked into the distance, as if nothing had just happened.

But at that moment, they happened to be passing through the mountain gate.

Looking into the distance, they saw two figures, one pink and one green, riding cloud-colored steeds and approaching, surrounded by attendants.

Those cloud-colored steeds were actually the same breed as Commander Qu Sheng's mount, possessing a divine and extraordinary bloodline. Because of their pure white fur, they were only available to the Great Yu imperial family or granted by the imperial household, never falling into the hands of commoners. They were known in the martial world as 'Heavenly Horses.'

In their past life, they were equivalent to limited-edition Rolls-Royces.

The group was imposing as they entered the mountain gate, seemingly intending to ride straight to the main hall. They looked less like they were here for a reward and more like they were here to make a charge.

The woman in the pink dress riding the Heavenly Horse had sharp eyes and immediately spotted the two about to go up the mountain.

"Li Mo... Ying Bing?"

The Crown Prince himself had not come today, only sending two maids to represent him at the Qingyuan Sect.

The woman in the pink dress knew this was a form of admonishment. Combined with the fact that she had been injured yesterday, she was filled with righteous indignation. Following the Crown Prince, even high-ranking experts from major sects treated them with courtesy. When had she ever suffered such a loss?

She didn't expect to run into Li Mo, the "Little Overlord with a Divine Hammer" who had backed the little princess yesterday, before even reaching the mountain.

But before Dan Hong could speak, Li Mo frowned first.

"No riding within the mountain gate."

"Under the vast sky, all land belongs to the King. How dare you block me from delivering the Crown Prince's orders?"

Dan Hong's eyes suddenly turned sharp. Today, Jiang Yu hadn't told her to hold back. She was in the Inner Scene Realm, and no matter how talented the other party was, he was only at the Divine Perception Realm.

She took the long whip from her waist, its sharp whistle cutting through the air like a venomous and nimble soft sword, aiming to tear at Li Mo's face.

*Crack!*

The whip, cracking in mid-air, inexplicably veered off course, striking the stone steps beside them and shattering them.

"Arrogant wretch, how dare you dodge!"

She drew a玄兵 (Mystic Weapon) from her chest, the Inner Scene field that connected with the heavens and earth faintly releasing.

But the next second, a sword light like the blue frost under the moon bloomed.

Ying Bing took a step forward, holding Heavenly Frost in her hand, her eyes filled with a cold majesty.

"This is bad... Honored guests, please calm yourselves. Sister Ying..."

Ouyang, who had come down to greet them, almost had his soul fly out at the sight of this.

Good heavens, Junior Brother Li offended them yesterday. Today it's Sister Ying again. Did these two plan this?

Evidently, neither party paid Ouyang any mind.

The green-clad woman, Qing Que, also dismounted and said to him, "The Crown Prince has ordered us to instruct the two Hidden Dragon prodigies in martial arts. Since that is the case, let us do it right here at the mountain gate."

Hearing this, Ouyang could only stomp his foot and turn to rush to the main peak hall to report.

Qing Que looked at the cold, sword-wielding girl and had the illusion of seeing the woman who had once stunned the entire martial world at the Tianshan Sword Manor.

Could she perhaps...

At that moment, Ying Bing's gaze also turned to her, and she said softly:

"The two of you, come at me together."
