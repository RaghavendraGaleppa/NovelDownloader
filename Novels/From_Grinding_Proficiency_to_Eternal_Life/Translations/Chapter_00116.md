# Chapter 116: The Second Trial's Dazzling Display

Xu Yunfan’s throat bobbed as a rumbling thunder sound rolled from his tongue. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand erupted with scorching heat, and visible shockwaves of force pulsed out rapidly with his surging blood essence.

The two forces collided. For an instant, hammer force and spear radiance intertwined and expanded. The ground beneath their feet, already churned up, flew into the air. Splintered stones shot out, catching the spectators in the front rows off guard and causing them to cry out in pain as they were struck.

The Sect Master of the Green Luan Sword Sect, though her sword remained sheathed, casually flicked her wrist to shatter the incoming stones into dust and deflect them away.

Her face bore a trace of shock. She turned her head to glance at the envoy of the Nine Luminaries Sect seated in the first position on the viewing platform.

Only a top-tier sect like the Nine Luminaries Sect had the audacity to disrupt another sect’s True Disciple Ceremony so brazenly. Had it been any other sect daring to offend the Heavenly Art Cave in such a way, they would have undoubtedly made a formidable enemy by the end of the event.

At that moment, Xu Yunfan used the rebound force to leap three zhang into the air. With a slight flick of his wrist, the mechanism in the hammer handle clicked. The chain of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer pulled taut like a fully drawn bow, and the rune-etched steel hammerhead plummeted downward like a crimson meteor.

Teng Lingchuan stepped through the Seven Star positions, his spear tip flickering with the Nine Luminaries technique. His muscles bulged, straining his loose clothing. As his spear moved, it carved a Big Dipper formation into the blue brick ground. The exhaled spear energy faintly took on the form of celestial phenomena.

"Break!"

Xu Yunfan’s voice exploded from his throat as he twisted his waist and hips, bringing down a force of a thousand pounds.

The moment the hammerhead struck the Celestial Balance star position, a brass piece shot out from the handle's end. A tremendous force immediately surged back, and the entire Big Dipper formation collapsed instantly. Shattered blue bricks were lifted into the air by the shockwave. The ground beneath Teng Lingchuan’s feet cracked inch by inch, crushed and squeezed upward by the immense power.

*Hum!*

Teng Lingchuan’s face flushed crimson instantly. The crushing weight of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, now a chain hammer, had forcibly suppressed even the radiance of his spear. His arms went numb from the impact. That hammer strike possessed no technique, yet the sheer power behind it was something he could barely withstand.

His feet were deeply embedded in the earth and stone. The force he channeled away tore jagged fissures into the surrounding ground. This single strike was enough to easily shatter iron and break steel.

Teng Lingchuan’s tiger’s mouth throbbed with jade-like veins. He let out a furious roar and suddenly shifted his grip on the long spear. The spear tip transformed into a sky full of starlight, shooting toward Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes deepened. His pectoral muscles suddenly swelled, tearing his shirt apart. Amidst the dark golden luster of his bronze skin, sinews like Teng Lingchuan’s appeared, pulsing with a jade-like color beneath his skin!

The Nine Luminaries Sect envoy on the sidelines shot to his feet, staring intently at Xu Yunfan, his expression one of utter disbelief.

On the high platform, Hong Baichuan also stepped forward to the edge, his face a mixture of shock and delight.

"Take this!"

Teng Lingchuan roared, his blood essence condensing like a crimson python. As he channeled it, the spear radiance surged to a length of one zhang. With the flick of the spear tip, it transformed into a sky full of stars.

Each thrust could easily pierce metal and shatter stone.

Facing the torrent of spear radiance, Xu Yunfan’s right arm suddenly swelled by three圈. His brachioradialis rose like an angry dragon.

"Hit!"

The chain of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly straightened like a spear. The hammerhead fell, shattering the countless spear shadows with a crushing force. Like a venomous dragon drilling into a heart, it slammed straight toward Teng Lingchuan’s chest.

Hearing the whistling sound of the air being torn by the heavy hammer, the young prodigy’s face changed drastically. His waist twisted into a bizarre arc like a spirit snake. As he executed the Nine Luminaries Sect’s secret Jade Netting Soft Form, the joints throughout his body cracked and popped like frying beans.

This was the moment Xu Yunfan had been waiting for!

The hammer chain snapped taut again, suddenly coiling around the spear shaft. Using the centrifugal force, the hammerhead swept out like a thousand-army charge.

Teng Lingchuan tried to retreat but suddenly felt his feet take root.不知何时, Xu Yunfan’s left foot had shattered the ground, and the chain hammer had clamped onto his deerskin boots like an iron vise.

He looked up sharply to see Xu Yunfan gripping the chain, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer falling from the sky.

"Lingchuan!"

The Nine Luminaries Sect envoy’s expression changed drastically. His body shot up, tearing a visible white shockwave through the air.

The Nine Luminaries Sect envoy, Yin Hong, turned icy cold. His body sprang forward like a taut bowstring. As his robes snapped and billowed in the wind, his bulging, knotted muscles tore a human-shaped white shockwave through the air, as if an invisible pair of hands had crushed all the mist in the training ground.

He was actually a Bone Marrow Cleansing Master-level expert.

"Elder Yin, please wait!"

Hong Baichuan’s pupils contracted. Yin Hong’s five fingers had already formed an eagle claw aimed at Xu Yunfan’s throat, the knuckles glowing red. The scorching heat made everyone nearby hold their breath.

He stomped his foot on the blue stone tiles, which instantly shattered into spiderweb cracks. His body shot across like a stone projectile from a catapult.

Before the roar could fade, the two collided violently in mid-air.

Yin Hong changed his claw into a palm. The lines on his palm actually turned a dark red due to high-speed friction. A palm capable of melting metal and iron descended, carrying the scent of sulfur.

Hong Baichuan’s knuckles bulged with veins. The moment he exerted force, a sound like forged steel rang out. It was the Heavenly Art Cave’s secret Thousand-Forged Mountain-Crushing Force.

The instant fist met palm, a shockwave slammed down like a heavy hammer.

Within a radius of three zhang, all the stone slabs were overturned. Flying gravel sparked against the force stirred up by the two.

Yin Hong’s boots plowed the ground as he retreated seven steps, each step leaving a half-inch deep imprint in the rock.

Hong Baichuan’s sleeves tore apart inch by inch, revealing the quenched copper scale armor densely covering his forearms. The scales were already twisted and deformed under the immense pressure.

*Boom!*

The hammer wind swept up a three-zhang dust storm. When the dust settled, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was suspended three inches from Teng Lingchuan’s face, stopped.

Xu Yunfan’s arm muscles were still vibrating at high frequency, a molten glow flowing beneath his skin.

Teng Lingchuan’s clothes shattered inch by inch, leaving him not even a pair of shorts. The tattered cloth fluttered into the sky with the airflow, leaving him stark naked. This was due to the high-frequency vibrations of the Zenith禅 Force; unable to dissipate the force, it had forcibly shattered his clothing.

The other seven sects of Cangzhou watching were first stunned, but not daring to make a sound due to the Nine Luminaries Sect’s prestige. However, the unconcealed amusement and teasing in their eyes made Teng Lingchuan’s face flush crimson.

Seeing this, Elder Yin of the Nine Luminaries Sect also paused. He let out a cold snort and crushed the tiger-head ring he had taken from his chest into dust, the iron powder falling from his fingers.

This made Hong Baichuan’s eyelid twitch.

That old dog Yin, relying on his status in the Nine Luminaries Sect, actually dared to secretly use a tiger-head ring.

Ignoring the wary Hong Baichuan, Elder Yin flashed forward, took off his long robe, and wrapped it around Teng Lingchuan.

Teng Lingchuan looked at Elder Yin, somewhat dazed.

"Master, I actually lost."

Seeing that Teng Lingchuan was fine, the worry in Elder Yin’s heart finally settled. He looked complexly at Xu Yunfan, who had been promptly shielded by Hong Baichuan.

"Skin and Sinew Second Trial perfected. Sect Master Hong has indeed found a fine seedling."
