# Chapter 44: Zhao Xuhe at His Wit's End

Skull Mountain, White Bone Cave, outside the market.

A streaking light concealed itself among the mountains and forests, revealing three figures. Two of them were precisely Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan, who had previously attacked the market but had fled back in disarray. The third person was a white-haired old man.

"Elder Ouyang..." Wu Zhichong spoke cautiously, fearing that the Qi Condensation Grand Perfection Elder before him might do something irrational. Ahead lay a dragon's pool and a tiger's den.

"Rest assured, this old man knows what's important." Ouyang Feng's expression was grim. Though his eyes, as he looked at the market, were filled with bitter hatred, his tone was remarkably calm, without the slightest ripple. "That devil is a Ninth-Rank Formation Master. He has set up two formations, an inner and an outer, in this market. They are not something ordinary people can break, which explains why he has been able to live so freely until now, even earning the infamous title of 'Blood-Clothed Lord.' However, he is not a true Qi Condensation Grand Perfection cultivator; ultimately, his power is a castle in the air."

"But Elder Ouyang, the Tai Xiao Mirror also fell into that person's hands." Wu Zhichong quickly agreed, then whispered, "The Tai Xiao Mirror is mysterious and unpredictable. If that devil can manipulate it, he might not be inferior to a Qi Condensation Grand Perfection cultivator..."

"I have naturally considered this matter as well." Ouyang Feng sneered, "The Tai Xiao Mirror is, after all, a spirit treasure of my Divine Martial Sect. How could a mere devil just take it and use it? If he dares to use it, all the better! I have already invited Master Yang Yazi, who originally forged the Tai Xiao Mirror. He is furious that the Tai Xiao Mirror fell into the devil's hands and has agreed to come to Skull Mountain to reclaim the spirit treasure and restore order. With him here, if that devil dares to use the Tai Xiao Mirror against me, he will be courting death!"

Although Ouyang Feng was enraged, he had not lost his composure. Moreover, with Ouyang Haoze's past lesson, he wouldn't dare to break through the formation again. After much thought, it was better to lure Lü Yang out of the formation.

"When does this person usually leave the market?"

"Uh..." Faced with Ouyang Feng's inquiry, Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan exchanged glances, utterly speechless.

Seeing this, Ouyang Feng immediately frowned, displeased, "Haven't you been staking out outside the market for a long time? How can you not even know such a small detail?"

"Reporting to Elder, this person has not left the market to this day."

"...He hasn't?" Ouyang Feng was stunned, "Didn't you pass on the news of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm? Doesn't he know that Skull Mountain is currently full of opportunities?"

The two wore aggrieved expressions: "We've already passed it on."

"So, the reinforcements from the Prime Saint Demonic Sect haven't arrived yet, and the demonic path is weak, which is why he dares not leave?"

"In fact, the Demonic Sect's reinforcements arrived three months ago and have been actively moving around Skull Mountain. Only this person has not left from beginning to end."

"Ah?" After hearing the report, Ouyang Feng finally revealed a look of bewilderment.

"I'm not going out."

Inside the Blood-Clothed Tower, Lü Yang and Fairy Feixia sat opposite each other. Lü Yang gently declined Fairy Feixia's invitation while handing her a cup of spirit tea.

"Junior Brother is truly..." Fairy Feixia looked at Lü Yang, her beautiful face suddenly lost in thought. Once upon a time, she had been deeply disappointed by this junior brother's timidity. Yet, he had meticulously planned every step, building the formidable reputation of the Blood-Clothed Lord.

One must know that all cultivators are vying with the heavens for destiny. Take one step too slowly, and the outcome is death from old age. Even with the so-called reincarnation, there's no guarantee of immortal destiny after rebirth, nor is there a guarantee of being oneself. Therefore, one cannot rely on it. Yet, seeing him again now, Lü Yang was just as he had always been. Indifferent, tranquil, as if nothing in the world truly mattered to him.

This rare temperament among cultivators made Fairy Feixia suddenly recall a saying: "Water benefits all things without contention, hence nothing can contend with it." But if a person lives their life without contending, how can they seek the Dao? In the next life?

Thinking of this, Fairy Feixia couldn't help but sigh, "...I'm ashamed. This humble one fears she will never achieve such a profound state of mind as Junior Brother's in this lifetime."

"Senior Sister overpraises me." Lü Yang smiled slightly, "Didn't I say before I came? This time, we won't discuss major affairs, only the Dao. I'll teach Senior Sister array formations, and Senior Sister will teach me talisman techniques."

"This humble one will naturally teach you everything I know." Fairy Feixia's red lips curved slightly. With a delicate hand, she drew back her veil, revealing a breathtakingly beautiful face that could topple nations. Beneath her thin, rosy robes, peaks rose majestically, and her hip line curved like the moon. Even her voice unconsciously softened, "Speaking of which, I haven't yet thanked Junior Brother for saving my life before..."

***

The next day, the sun was high in the sky.

Inside the market, a dishevelled young man paced back and forth in his cave dwelling, his face filled with struggle. It was none other than Lü Yang's old acquaintance, Zhao Xuhe.

"How could this be? How could this be?" At this moment, Zhao Xuhe had reached a peak of desperation. "News of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm is now known to all. If I don't act soon, I'll miss my chance!"

Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe's aura suddenly erupted. He was no longer at Qi Condensation Layer 6, as he had been when he first arrived at the market; he had broken through to Qi Condensation Layer 7, a late-stage cultivation. It was precisely because he had broken through a bottleneck that had plagued him for years that he harbored the thought of venturing into the secret realm to gamble for an opportunity. But having the thought didn't mean he possessed the strength. Without the opportunities from Dragon Coiling Island, he could only cultivate the Yin-Yang Grand Joy Scripture of Heaven Mending Peak. His true qi was only Fifth-Grade, and his divine abilities and magic treasures were all inferior. In such circumstances, contending for opportunities would be courting death.

After much thought, Zhao Xuhe finally gritted his teeth, took out a jade slip that had been sealed away for a long time, injected spiritual power into it, and contacted the person he hadn't seen in a long while. A faint glow permeated the jade slip. After a long while, a voice emerged, "Who is it?"

The voice carried a hint of laziness and a slight parchedness, yet it made Zhao Xuhe feel an extraordinary sense of nostalgia. He couldn't help but whisper, "Feixia... It's me, Xuhe."

That's right, he had an old acquaintance with Fairy Feixia. However, to call it an old acquaintance was perhaps too strong; they were merely former acquaintances. Yet, after he was chosen by the Heaven Mending Peak Master as a prospective son-in-law, he had severed contact with her to avoid suspicion. He had thought they would never cross paths again, but unexpectedly, he now found himself seeking her help.

Zhao Xuhe clenched his jaw and whispered, "Feixia, I want to ask you for something... My cultivation path is now hopeless, and I intend to leave the market for one last gamble." He knew that Fairy Feixia most admired actions where one burned one's bridges for the sake of seeking the Dao. So, only by speaking like this could he move her. "But I currently have no contribution points, and no means to purchase magic treasures or divine abilities. In such a situation, even with the resolve to burn my bridges, I fear it would only be a futile death. So... so... for the sake of our past relationship, lend me a little..."

As he spoke, Zhao Xuhe couldn't help but recall bits and pieces of his past with Fairy Feixia, and an unspoken sense of hope arose in his heart.

However, the next second, a basin of cold water poured down.

"I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about." The soft voice, which had initially carried a warm intensity, instantly turned icy cold. She said indifferently, "Also, please do not contact me again in the future. I am currently discussing the Dao with Junior Brother Lü, and I don't want him to misunderstand."

*Crack!* The next second, the jade slip shattered.

Zhao Xuhe stood frozen in place, not recovering for a long while. After a considerable time, his face gradually twisted, and he let out a roar from between his gritted teeth:

"NO—!!!"
