# Chapter 29: Convening the Clan Meeting  

"Why are you looking at me like that? Did I say something wrong?"  

Luo Li felt unnerved by Chen Daoxuan's gaze and snapped in embarrassment.  

"Ahem, Miss Luo, you misunderstand."  

Chen Daoxuan cleared his throat. "Perhaps in your and your elder's eyes, the price of these artifacts is low, but selling them to you at this price already earns us a profit. So, there's no need to think I lowered the price out of fear."  

His businesslike tone left Luo Li at a loss for words.  

"Good! Since both parties are satisfied with the price, let’s proceed with the transaction," the middle-aged merfolk declared.  

Eager to avoid any second thoughts, Chen Daoxuan quickly nodded. "Agreed!"  

With the initial agreement reached, the atmosphere between them eased.  

The middle-aged merfolk gestured to the merwoman beside him and said with a smile, "This is my daughter, Luo Li. From now on, she will represent our Luo Clan in all future artifact transactions with your family."  

He then gave Luo Li a meaningful glance.  

Understanding, Luo Li reached to her waist and forcefully plucked a bloodstained scale from her body.  

"Human cultivator, this is my life-scale. With it, you can contact me from anywhere within a radius of ten thousand miles."  

Her face paled as she handed it over.  

Chen Daoxuan silently accepted the scale and stored it in his pouch.  

"Once we settle our clan, we will return to complete the transaction," the middle-aged merfolk said, his gaze steady. "Human cultivator, I hope... you won’t deceive us."  

"I wouldn’t dare," Chen Daoxuan replied with a bow.  

"Good."  

With that, the middle-aged merfolk and Luo Li plunged into the water and vanished.  

From above, the dark mass of the merfolk clan gradually disappeared beneath the waves.  

Half an hour later, the members of the *Canglong* began waking up one by one.  

After calming the panicked crew, Chen Daoxuan ordered the ship to continue its journey back to Shuanghu Island.  

Twenty days later, the *Canglong* safely docked at Shuanghu Island’s deep-water harbor without further incident.

### Shuanghu Island, Changping County  
### Chen Clan Ancestral Hall  

The ancestral hall was not only a place of worship but also the highest seat of power for the Chen Clan. Over the past three hundred years, countless clan meetings held here had determined the family’s fate.  

Seated in the position once occupied by Chen Xianhe, Chen Daoxuan looked down at the two rows of clan members standing before him and sighed inwardly.  

The Chen Clan was truly dwindling.  

For a cultivation family, it was almost laughable that the only cultivator present at the clan meeting was himself.  

Shaking off his thoughts, Chen Daoxuan spoke from the patriarch’s seat.  

"Since the clan leader must oversee our shop in Guang'an Prefecture’s Immortal City, I will temporarily assume the duties of the family head."  

As he spoke, he displayed the black seal symbolizing the patriarch’s authority.  

The clan members showed no surprise. In their eyes, Chen Daoxuan, as the only rising cultivator of the younger generation, was the natural successor. With the elder patriarch aging, they had long been prepared for this transition.  

After murmuring among themselves, they bowed in unison. "Greetings, Young Patriarch!"  

"Rise," Chen Daoxuan waved his hand.  

"In the past, I focused solely on cultivation and had little involvement in clan affairs, so I am not well acquainted with many of you. But from now on, I hope we can work together to strengthen our Chen Clan of Shuanghu Island!"  

Hearing this, Chen Zhi, the magistrate of Changping County, stepped forward from the right row and saluted.  

"The county office pledges full support to the Young Patriarch in reorganizing clan affairs and advancing our family’s prosperity!"  

"Good," Chen Daoxuan nodded approvingly.  

Seeing this, Chen Liangyu, the former overseer of the Red Copper Mine, inwardly cursed. He had missed the chance to declare his loyalty first.  

Not to be outdone, he quickly added, "The Red Copper Mine also stands ready to serve at the Young Patriarch’s command!"  

"Excellent. I see everyone’s dedication," Chen Daoxuan smiled. "Now, there are several urgent matters to address."  

As the group listened attentively, he turned to Magistrate Chen Zhi.  

"Chen Zhi."  

"At your service," Chen Zhi replied with a bow.  

"How many registered households does our Chen Clan have?"  

"Reporting to the Young Patriarch, the Chen Clan of Shuanghu Island consists of 774 households, totaling 3,873 individuals. Among them, 597 households (2,987 people) reside in Changping County, while the remaining 177 households (886 people) live in the villages."  

"So few in the villages?" Chen Daoxuan frowned. "How does the clan manage food supplies?"  

"Previously, the elder patriarch purchased grain from Guang'an Prefecture to supplement the clan’s needs," Chen Zhi answered cautiously, noting Chen Daoxuan’s displeasure.  

"And the demographic structure of the clan?"  

Chen Zhi hesitated. "May I ask what you mean by 'demographic structure'?"  

Realizing he had used an unfamiliar term, Chen Daoxuan clarified, "The detailed breakdown of the population by gender and age."  

"Ah..."  

Chen Zhi broke into a cold sweat. This was something he had never recorded.  

Not one to admit defeat, he quickly replied, "The county office has no such records, but... from what I know, our clan has a relatively young population with ample male members."  

He assumed Chen Daoxuan was concerned about a shortage of male labor and emphasized this point.  

However, instead of being pleased, Chen Daoxuan’s expression darkened.  

A surplus of males meant a gender imbalance, making it difficult to expand the clan’s population quickly. And population growth was directly tied to the strength of the clan’s cultivators—its lifeblood.  

Rubbing his temples, Chen Daoxuan finally grasped how much pressure Chen Xianhe had shouldered alone to allow him to focus on cultivation and artifact forging.  

Moving on, he asked, "How much arable land does the clan own?"  

Relieved by the simpler question, Chen Zhi answered, "Reporting to the Young Patriarch, we possess 4,657 acres of fertile land."  

"With so much land and only 177 farming households, can the peasants manage it all?"  

"This..."  

Chen Zhi wiped his brow, unsure how to respond. He couldn’t very well admit that most of the land belonged to wealthy families.  

Even in the world of cultivation, land consolidation was an enduring issue. Even a small clan like the Chens faced this problem.  

However, cultivators, aloof from mortal concerns, rarely paid attention. Only when conflicts escalated would they intervene with their overwhelming power to redistribute resources.  

Seeing his hesitation, Chen Daoxuan pressed, "Then surely the county office knows the total land area of Shuanghu Island?"  

"I... I do not," Chen Zhi admitted, his head bowed under the growing weight of Chen Daoxuan’s presence.
