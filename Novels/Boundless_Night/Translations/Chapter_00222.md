**Chapter 222: No Overnight Grudges**

Wangxian Peak itself trembled, eliciting gasps of surprise. Was this an earthquake?

Most terrifying of all, everyone’s vision suddenly went dark.

"What happened?"

"Why can I see nothing?!"

The darkness came too suddenly, the world turning to ink, making it impossible to see one's own hand.

In Kunling City, there was more than one high-grade fire spring that should have lit the city bright as day, but now, covered by darkness, the city instantly lost all its radiance. Even the various experts were dumbfounded, let alone ordinary people.

Within the massive city, all sorts of panicked sounds arose, and the dense night mist was filled with unease. Soon, the shouts of adults, the cries of children, and the terrified screams of young women all mixed together.

In the private room, even Qin Ming, Xiao Wu, and the others were startled. What in the world was going on? Had the conflict on the plateau spread hundreds of miles away? But how could a battle extinguish the fire springs of Kunling City? Such a method was too terrifying.

Fortunately, this chilling state of the world turning into a bottomless abyss, with all things seemingly sinking into frozen earth, lasted only two breaths before rapidly ending. Light suddenly reappeared before everyone's eyes. Many looked towards the areas of the city with high-grade fire springs, seeing a dazzling display, the light sources as they had always been, as if no anomaly had ever occurred.

"Did the city's fire springs really go out just now, or were our five senses, or even six senses, temporarily stripped away? This... is bone-chilling!" Some elder figures tensed up, feeling a cold dread in their hearts, their hair standing on end. Ordinary people wouldn't think so much; upon seeing the light again, cheers erupted throughout the city. During those brief two breaths, people felt as if they had fallen into the Underworld, and that feeling was too terrifying.

"One can imagine what a dreadful scene it would be if, one day, all the fire springs on the land dimmed and finally went dark forever." In the private room, even Xin Youdao and Ling Yu still felt lingering fear, thinking of many negative future scenarios.

Tang Jin spoke, "Legend has it that in ancient times, during the first phase after the sun fell and never rose again, the primordial people experienced this, and their population drastically decreased, almost becoming completely extinct in a relatively short period." This topic was quite heavy; no one wished to experience such a dark era again.

In the distance, the night mist was burned away, and a 'Blazing Sun' was unusually dazzling. On the plateau, a crimson light surged into the sky, tearing through the darkness. Cao Qianqiu stood within a blood-red great sun, his silver hair flowing, his wide sleeves fluttering, supremely powerful.

"Is this your Esoteric Sect's unparalleled powerhouse, wanting to gauge this old man? Let him come out and fight!" His Pure Yang Spiritual Light was terrifyingly potent, his spiritual will shaking the entire plateau. Even those in Kunling City, hundreds of miles away, heard him and truly felt Cao Qianqiu's might, a posture as if to swallow the entire Sea of Night Mist.

The Esoteric Sect expert who appeared stepped forward to explain, "Brother Cao, we don't wish to conflict with you. We weren't targeting you just now; that strange phenomenon was merely this region's self-protection."

Cao Qianqiu coldly retorted, "You've set your sights on this plateau. Someone wants to subdue this place and achieve godhood here? Or even devour the entire Kunling region?!"

As these words were uttered, the hair of those in Kunling City stood on end. Who was this? To possess such ambition! Previously, only Sun Taichu, standing among the clouds, had mentioned such things. Ordinary people could not possibly know about them, and now, hearing them for the first time, they were all terrified. No one expected Cao Qianqiu to openly state it like this.

"Did you ask me first? Is Kunling your personal domain?!" Cao Qianqiu stood horizontally in the air, blood light engulfing a large portion of the plateau. He stomped his foot downwards. With a rumble, the ground sank again, and many giant cracks appeared on the plateau, extending into the distance.

"Brother Cao, there are some things you don't yet understand. You cannot rely solely on your own conjectures; do not bring about your own downfall!" The Esoteric Sect members responded in kind.

Cao Qianqiu scoffed, "Heh, I heard that those who wish to achieve godhood must experience a period of dormancy. To subdue a legendary land and devour Kunling, your audacity is too great. If I were to pierce through this place now, I wonder if he would emerge to fight me!"

Deep within the plateau, the group of demons were watching the show, not expecting the external enemies to actually turn on each other. Sun Taichu was nearby, not intervening. Kunling was a region connected to quasi-divine beings and near-immortal entities, with numerous legends. If it were devoured by an Esoteric Sect powerhouse, the god born from it would undoubtedly be immensely powerful. Perhaps, from then on, few in the world would be able to restrain him. Clearly, the Immortal Path was deliberately testing. Cao Qianqiu was strong and overbearing, not isolated; sometimes he represented the will of a portion of those from the Out-of-Realm Territories. At this moment, Old Cao was clearly the Immortal Path's "Cao the Thousand Blades."

Boom! The plateau vibrated violently; Cao Qianqiu refused to stop. The next moment, his blood-red great sun was swallowed by darkness.

"Hmm?" He let out a surprised sound. "Are you here? Fight me!"

In an instant, the world turned pitch black again. In Kunling City, everyone felt as if they had fallen into an abyss, unable to see anything. This time, the darkness lasted four breaths. When light reappeared, Cao Qianqiu stood high in the sky, holding an immortal spear, emanating murderous intent. His silver hair streamed backward as he gazed gravely in one direction. Clearly, Cao Qianqiu was under pressure, seemingly facing an incredibly terrifying existence!

This time, not only did the Esoteric Sect members step forward, but even Sun Taichu went to stop him. After an unknown conversation among the three, Cao Qianqiu snorted coldly and ceased his actions. Ordinary cultivators had no idea of the specific situation, but a few prominent elders knew that the Immortal Path expert had likely gained extremely valuable information through this test.

The bound cicada exuviae spoke, "Later generations, with ambitions for dead ends, truly are not simple. Hmm, he must be looking at the entire Kunling region, wanting to devour all the myths and legends? What great ambition!" Instantly, the golden runic ropes binding it burned, and with a crack, they almost snapped it.

Cao Qianqiu stepped forward, white mist rising and auspicious light surging from the immortal spear. With a bang, it pierced through the exuviae, then violently shook, causing a portion of the cicada exuviae to explode.

"Later generations are truly violent; can't you even tolerate an old cicada's dead skin? You bully me for being old and weak; beware that one day you too will be kicked apart by your descendants," the exuviae said.

Cao Qianqiu sneered, "A discarded dead skin, what are you pretending to be in front of me? If your true body were here, I might take such words seriously." He violently shook the immortal spear, like blazing flames consuming the sky, its Pure Yang Spiritual Light illuminating the plateau. The cicada exuviae cracked and then completely burst apart, utterly destroyed.

In Kunling City, upon witnessing this scene, everyone felt the terror of that single spear strike. Even from such a distance, their minds trembled, as if that spear had pierced their very hearts.

Sun Taichu spoke, "A discarded exuviae is nothing; I only fear that the cicada isn't dead and will appear again."

Cao Qianqiu retorted, "When it comes out, this old man will be even stronger than now. As long as I remain at the forefront of this path, there's nothing to fear." The two usually didn't get along and had had serious disputes, even slamming tables, but now there was no conflict.

Cao Qianqiu asked, "Have people from other paths arrived? Will we fight today? When will we sweep this plateau clean?!" His voice was grand, shattering the night mist, his murderous intent surging throughout the entire region. In Kunling City, people were alarmed. Indeed, with Cao Qianqiu's arrival, the established calm was instantly broken, and he intended to act immediately.

"Cao Qianqiu, do you really think you're invincible under heaven? Come and try it..." Deep within the plateau, a mountain-sized giant beast spoke, directly opposing him.

"Noisy!" Cao Qianqiu stepped forward, enveloped by the blood-red great sun. In an instant, he reached deep into the plateau and went straight for the giant beast. This time, he suddenly threw his right fist, and crimson light instantly seemed to tear through the entire world, shaking the very earth, with blood-colored lightning flashing everywhere. With a boom, the mountain-sized giant beast exploded. A powerful great demon, whose strength was exceptionally fierce and who usually looked down on all experts, dominating this plateau, was easily blasted apart by Cao Qianqiu.

Roar! A tremendous roar erupted, causing those in Kunling City to have splitting headaches, feeling their consciousness on the verge of exploding. An Auspicious Beast emerged, and when its eyes opened, they were like two golden blazing suns across the sky. Its aura was incomparably powerful. For a time, golden light surged, submerging the region in its divine radiance, making it difficult to look directly. The ground and sky trembled. This plateau was like a painting, seemingly on the verge of being torn apart by it. The Auspicious Beast swiped a giant claw, as if the sky itself were collapsing, covering the front and descending at extreme speed.

Clang! Cao Qianqiu thrust his spear, powerfully blocking the Auspicious Beast. At this moment, Sun Taichu and the Esoteric Sect experts all stepped forward. Behind the Auspicious Beast, two massive figures appeared consecutively, as if standing in an abyss, their auras terrifying, like an ocean breaching its dam, with overwhelming malevolent qi surging. Indeed, the Auspicious Beast had summoned unfathomably powerful experts. In the blinding light, both sides briefly clashed, shaking the earth and mountains, before ultimately retreating.

Those in the Kunling region could not see the specific situation there, as their vision was filled with light. The Esoteric Sect expert did not want the plateau to be destroyed and demanded that Cao Qianqiu stop, waiting for all their own allies to arrive before truly engaging the Auspicious Beast.

Sun Taichu also said, "Stop. There are some strange and quite dangerous things in the third ultimate desolate land at the end of the plateau. It's not suitable for a decisive battle today; preparations are needed." He suspected that the third ultimate desolate land might contain the crisis hinted at in the "Records of Quasi-Divine Beings of Kunling"! In fact, he believed that there might be remnants of decayed quasi-divine beings in the third ultimate desolate land.

"You're lucky this time!" Cao Qianqiu glared at the depths of the plateau.

"Cao Qianqiu, don't put on an invincible act. If this battle truly erupts, we guarantee we'll take you down!" the Auspicious Beast declared.

"What did you say?!" Cao Qianqiu pointed a finger, and thousands of runes appeared, forming a giant bag that covered the sky and earth, shrouding the depths of the plateau. Before the Auspicious Beast could move, a demon next to it erupted in black light, extending a giant claw to grab the bag in the sky. In the end, that demon was left bloody, nearly captured by the Ten Thousand Talisman Pouch.

"Brother Cao, after a period of seclusion, your cultivation has advanced again!" The Esoteric Sect expert revealed a look of surprise, feeling that Cao Qianqiu, who had rushed out of seclusion this time, had surpassed his former self.

...

A grand decisive battle was on the verge of erupting but was temporarily halted. Finally, both sides retreated, seemingly awaiting the arrival of powerful reinforcements. That day, other experts from the Immortal Path arrived, their Pure Yang Spiritual Light tearing through the dark night. The next day, an ancestor from the New Life Path hovered in the air, formed by pure heavenly light, causing all Immortal Path disciples to tremble, feeling extremely uncomfortable, as if their consciousness was about to ignite. Fortunately, the great sun formed by heavenly light disappeared in a flash.

The Esoteric Sect was very active, with an old senior who pioneered their path personally arriving, taking the matter very seriously because it involved their "core interests." The atmosphere in the Kunling region was tense; a decisive battle could break out at any moment!

"Cao Qianqiu's arrival has broken a certain balance. We originally planned to start with the lower-level pioneering, but now that's impossible. It's going to be an ultimate confrontation directly! I believe, to be safe, the disciples in the academies should retreat." The various academies reached a consensus that the younger generation could not participate in this. Moreover, some old seniors were slightly worried that the battle might affect Kunling City, so they made the worst-case preparations.

Qin Ming and Xiao Wu received the news in advance and were surprised. They had only been in Kunling City for a short time, and now they were to "strategically" retreat far away? No one expected that at such a tense moment, Cao Qianqiu would be the first to leave! Crimson light surged, his Pure Yang Spiritual Light traversing the night sky. He temporarily departed the Kunling region. This exceeded everyone's expectations. People naturally did not believe he was afraid; with his overbearing personality, he always liked to kick through iron plates, especially when he had the advantage.

"What is this Immortal Path 'slaughtering blade' trying to do, what madness is this?" An old senior asked, gazing in the direction Cao Qianqiu had departed. In fact, Cao Qianqiu's every move drew attention from all sides, and his departure sparked widespread discussion.

Soon after, someone charted his distant trajectory, somewhat surprised that he was heading towards a remote area. "Black and White Mountain! He seems to be heading there!" Immediately, many people made connections. The last time, after Cao Qianqiu hunted the blue centipede that sought godhood, he had gone to Black and White Mountain to "reminisce about the past," but he allegedly suffered a great loss and left injured.

"After emerging from seclusion this time, Cao Qianqiu's strength has improved. Is he going for revenge? That certainly fits his character!" Many guessed his purpose. People couldn't help but sigh; he was truly free-spirited and acted on his own impulse. Even with the tense situation in the Kunling region, he didn't care and went to Black and White Mountain alone.

"Not necessarily alone. I suspect he enlisted help from Kunling, which is why he's returning to Black and White Mountain with such murderous intent." Even so, many people were speechless; this man's desire for revenge was too strong; he didn't want to wait a single moment!

"You're all wrong. Cao Qianqiu doesn't hold grudges because throughout his life, he rarely has overnight grudges."
"This is to avoid holding grudges, so he rushed there immediately after coming out of seclusion." Only a few people dared to make such jests in private.

Some also suspected that Black and White Mountain held unknown great fortune, and Cao Qianqiu couldn't wait, immediately heading there after emerging from seclusion, wanting to try and obtain it.

When Qin Ming heard this news, he frowned. The Old Madman was going to Twin Tree Village again. He worried for his acquaintances there. Last time, Cao Qianqiu was injured because Old Man Liu had pointed out a problem above Twin Tree Village, where kites had been stained with blood. In fact, this time, when Cao Qianqiu returned to Twin Tree Village, he encountered Old Man Liu again, who was grinning at him.
