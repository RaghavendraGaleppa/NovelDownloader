# Chapter 167: Training Strength Like Flowing Water

The heatwaves from the smelting zone rolled through the air, lifting sparks and weaving a crimson net around the master and disciple. Yet, despite the scorching temperature, neither felt the slightest bit of heat.

Zhan Yan grabbed an unsharpened Xuan steel forging hammer.

"The Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer is divided into three training stages," he said, his voice resonating as his heel ground into the ground, cracking the three-foot-thick rock layer into a spiderweb pattern.

"The first stage is 'Xuan Steel Hundred-Forge Body,' training the muscles, bones, and skin to become impenetrable. When your blood energy is robust, the focus shifts to the rebound and dissipation of force. The second stage is the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, using the spine as the serpent, exploding force through each of the twenty-four vertebrae. The radius and ulna spiral and twist, turning a direct strike into a crushing bind. The fascia chains vibrate and transmit the force, allowing you to strike through three layers of steel armor from a distance.

"The third stage is the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method. When your strength reaches a thousand jun, you can swing the hammer to shake mountains. When the hammer falls, the tiger's mouth opens and closes like the earth's veins breathing, and the rebound force is channeled through the Yongquan acupoint into the ground three inches deep, where it vanishes!"

Before his words had fully faded, the forging hammer had already turned into a black blur and smashed down onto the anvil.

This strike was utterly without flourish, yet the moment the hammer face contacted the steel billet, a ring-shaped shockwave exploded outward.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. He clearly saw the tip of his master's elbow—the olecranon—shift half an inch beneath the skin, directing the impact force toward the shoulder blade, where it was then dissipated layer by layer by the great tendons of the spine.

The steel billet was flattened as thin as paper, yet the forging table didn't even tremble.

"Muscles are not an iron plate; they must learn to be like flowing water," Zhan Yan said, flipping his wrist to reveal the wriggling, earthworm-like veins on his forearm. "When the hammer's force enters the body, let the muscles and flesh rise and fall like rolling waves. Remember, hardening the body is not just about brute resistance, but also about 'guiding'! Only then can you minimize the enemy's damage. You must understand that even a body forged from refined steel will shatter under high-frequency attacks. But if a person knows how to dissipate force, they can endure longer, and their resistance will far exceed their original limits."

Zhan Yan gave a detailed explanation of how to guide the force.

"Dissipation—if you can ever reach the pinnacle of this skill, you might be able to endure a thousand forces acting upon your body and still remain as calm as a cloud in the sky. Give it a try."

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and focused. His spine suddenly arched like a full moon. He mimicked the trajectory of force he had just witnessed and swung his hammer at a spare anvil.

The hammer's wind pressure sent sparks rolling backward, but a third of the force was released the moment it touched the anvil. The rebound shot through his tiger's mouth and into his elbow, making him grimace in pain.

*You have listened to a strong cultivator's practice and seem to have grasped the force dissipation of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method. The proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method has increased.*

"Fool!" Zhan Yan flicked his finger against a numbing nerve on Xu Yunfan's arm. "Who told you to hold back? It should be like a mountain flood rushing through a floodgate, unstoppable and forward-pressing!"

Xu Yunfan's arm recoiled from the touch, and he couldn't help but shudder. The hard-body true art he had cultivated was full of flaws in front of Zhan Yan. He had to quickly cultivate to the Muscle Refining Realm to patch up his weaknesses.

On the second swing, Xu Yunfan decided to give up all control. The hammerhead descended with a piercing shriek, and the rebound force charged into his meridians like a wild horse. He grunted, and his arm muscles suddenly began to vibrate at a bizarrely high frequency. The moment the hammerhead contacted the anvil, the hair on the back of Xu Yunfan's hand suddenly lay flat.

A visible ripple of vibration spread from his wrist bone to his shoulder, and the surface of his triceps surprisingly took on a diamond-shaped, leather-like texture.

Zhan Yan's pupils shrank. He saw the tip of his disciple's elbow—the olecranon—sliding half an inch beneath the skin, directing seventy percent of the rebound into the trapezius muscle group.

*Crack!*

The spare anvil let out a teeth-grating groan. The three-hundred-jin cast-iron square anvil's surface was dented three inches deep, yet, strangely, no sparks flew from the edges; all the impact force was locked within the anvil's texture.

Xu Yunfan's sleeves on both arms exploded into fragments. On his exposed skin, blue veins writhed like living snakes, actually outlining a spiral pattern resembling a coiled dragon beneath his skin.

The entire forging platform was silent for a long time. Unable to hold back, Xu Yunfan turned his head to ask Zhan Yan.

"Master, is this the right way to strike?"

As he spoke, he couldn't help but glance at the notification of increased proficiency for the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method that had appeared in his vision. At most, three more swings, and the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer would definitely be mastered!

"Yes!"

Zhan Yan's expression flickered between light and shadow under the illumination of the ground fire. He remained silent for a long time.

Watching Zhan Yan's suddenly aged face, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but step forward and ask, "What's wrong, Master?"

Zhan Yan sighed. "Once, I too was a genius. I too possessed true blood!"

It wasn't until he met Xu Yunfan that he understood the saying that there are mountains beyond mountains and people beyond people. Anyone who cultivated alongside Xu Yunfan for a while would become depressed.

Xu Yunfan was surprised. "Master, you also had true blood?!"

"Let's not talk about that."

Zhan Yan waved his hand with a calm expression, seizing the opportunity to demonstrate the second stage: "The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength emphasizes the unity of waist and horse. The spine is the serpent, and the body's great tendons are the bowstring. Force is generated sequentially through the twenty-four vertebrae, layer by layer, allowing a human body to shake mountains."

He twisted his waist and侧身, and the forging hammer swept up from under his armpit. This hammer's trajectory was as cunning as a snake's tongue flicking out. The wind from the hammer overturned an iron water bucket three zhang away.

Xu Yunfan watched intently: his master's ilium and scapula simultaneously emitted a taut bowstring's *zheng* sound. The latissimus dorsi spread out like wings, forming a fully drawn, thousand-stone hard bow.

"Watch closely!"

Zhan Yan suddenly threw the forging hammer into the air. The instant the hammer body fell, he tapped the ground with his toes and spun, his heel striking down like a battle-axe, hitting the very end of the hammer handle.

*Boom!*

The forging hammer plunged into the rock layer like a meteor, leaving only the handle outside, vibrating at a high frequency. Amidst the flying stones, a crack spread ten zhang along the ground's veins, and steam wells erupted wherever it passed.

Soon, curses from the Heavenly Art Department could be heard from above.

"Cough, let's get out of here quickly. We'll leave the city first and find a suitable place to continue training."

"..."

Outside Heavenly Art City, in a depression on an unnamed mountain ridge.

"Remember, for the force to penetrate three inches into the ground veins, it is considered entry-level," Zhan Yan said, pulling out the forging hammer, its head now twisted into a spiral. "You have初步 formed the Outer Three Unions. Try to push your blood energy to the great spine behind you, and it will become a red serpent..."

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath of the scorching air, and his spine suddenly writhed like a python. He mimicked his master's spinning kick, but felt a cramp in his leg muscles the moment he tried to generate force. That was because his blood energy had not yet been able to reach his hair tips. To achieve this step, he would need to reach the Muscle Refining Realm.

The instant his boot sole struck the hammer handle, the rebound force shot into the back of his knee like a steel needle, causing him to kneel on the ground in pain.

"Who told you to rush!" Zhan Yan kicked him right where his buttocks met his thighs. "Let your ilium sink, keep the back of your knees empty, and imagine your Yongquan acupoint as a spring!"

On the seventh attempt, Xu Yunfan finally captured that wondrous feeling. The instant his heel touched the hammer, he deliberately relaxed his knee, allowing the rebound force to flow along his Achilles tendon into his waist and hips. His waist eye suddenly grew hot, and the wisps of pure yang energy hidden deep within his flesh, which had been accumulating, surged forth like a flood breaking through a floodgate, actually nailing the forging hammer two inches deep into the rock layer!

"Master, is this right?"

"...Close enough. If it weren't for the fact that you haven't reached the Muscle Refining Realm and your blood energy cannot reach your extremities, this strike would be considered qualified."

"The third stage is the 'Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer.' It can only be performed when one reaches the Muscle Refining Realm."
