# Chapter 24: The White Ant Queen  

After two days of cultivation, Qin Chong ventured alone into the depths of the mine.  

Suppressing his cultivation at the third layer of Qi Refining proved to be the right decision. Not only could he feign weakness to deceive potential threats, but it also ensured that even if he submitted fewer spirit stones each month, it wouldn't raise suspicion.  

This was his first time entering the mine alone, and despite being a cultivator with abilities far surpassing ordinary mortals, the oppressive environment still unsettled him. As he ventured deeper, the main tunnel branched into numerous smaller paths, and soon, he found himself completely alone.  

A day later, following the map he had obtained from Chen Mo, Qin Chong reached the end of the marked route, only to be met with over a dozen narrower passageways. His limited spiritual sense couldn't penetrate far enough to discern what lay at the end of these tunnels. After a brief hesitation, he randomly chose one and entered.  

Since spirit stones were still encased in protective barriers that reflected spiritual sense, Qin Chong could efficiently locate potential mining spots by detecting these reflections. Such materials were rare, making them easy to identify.  

Though his spiritual sense was relatively strong for a sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivator—enhanced by absorbing another cultivator’s soul—its range was significantly reduced within the dense rock. Here, he could only probe about a dozen zhang deep, a far cry from the threefold range he enjoyed above ground.  

If he detected a protective barrier deeper within the rock, it meant he’d have to carve out a new tunnel to reach it, further expanding the labyrinth of passages.  

Three days passed with Qin Chong exploring dozens of tunnels, yet he found nothing.  

Then, while searching another passage, he suddenly sensed the presence of a demon beast—a mid-tier first-stage creature, roughly matching his own strength. Following the faint aura, he discovered a burrowing armored beast resembling a pangolin, though much larger.  

The creature let out a startled cry and immediately vanished into a two-chi-wide hole in the rock wall. Qin Chong’s spiritual sense briefly tracked it before losing contact.  

Just as he was about to withdraw his senses, he noticed something unusual at the edge of his detection range—an anomaly near the end of the beast’s burrow, nearly fifty to sixty zhang away.  

The hole was situated about a zhang above the ground, too small for most to consider entering. Given its distance from the main tunnel and its absence from the map, Qin Chong hesitated but ultimately decided to investigate.  

The cramped passage forced him to crouch, slowing his progress, but the short distance made the discomfort bearable.  

After the time it took to drink a cup of tea, he emerged into a small cavern roughly a dozen zhang wide. The walls bore no signs of human excavation—instead, they appeared to be the work of some demon beast, though certainly not the small armored creature he had encountered earlier.  

Fragments of protective barriers littered the ground, indicating that spirit stones had once been present.  

Qin Chong took out a Moonlight Stone to illuminate the chamber, revealing numerous holes similar in size to the one he had entered. His spiritual sense probed each passage, but most extended beyond his range, leaving him disappointed.  

Undeterred, he pressed on, meticulously checking each tunnel. After a full day and night of searching, he finally detected the presence of a protective barrier. Though it was only about a zhang in length, it held enough spirit stones to sustain his mining efforts for months.  

Relieved, Qin Chong sat cross-legged to restore his energy.  

Yet, as his excitement waned, he frowned. The distance back to the main tunnel was considerable—each round trip would cost him two extra days. Still, given the scarcity of viable mining spots, he had little choice but to accept the inconvenience.  

Twenty days passed in a blur. As Qin Chong prepared to return, he made a startling discovery: the spirit stone vein he had been mining was merely a thin layer. Beneath it lay a hollow space, half a zhang wide, filled with shattered spirit stone fragments and a thick layer of powdered residue—identical to the remnants left after a cultivator absorbed a spirit stone’s energy.  

What could have caused this?  

Had someone—or something—been cultivating inside the spirit stones? There were no traces to suggest either possibility.  

Then, Qin Chong noticed a slight movement in the powder. Carefully brushing it aside, he uncovered a small creature—a white ant, no longer than his middle finger, with a bulbous rear.  

An ant queen.  

Its species was unclear, but what shocked Qin Chong most was its ability to evade his spiritual sense entirely. This tiny queen had somehow consumed vast quantities of spirit stones, yet emitted no detectable spiritual energy.  

Realizing the ant queen’s significance, Qin Chong recalled the beehive he carried. Perhaps he could use it to contain the creature.  

Determined, he prepared to test his theory.
