# Chapter 23: The Patriarch's Considerations

The next morning, a grand ancestral worship ceremony was held at the Yu family ancestral hall on Phoenix Mountain.

Through this ritual, Yu Chenglin's status as the heir was officially established.

Only the second branch of the eldest lineage of the Yu family was absent, making this grand event feel slightly incomplete.

After the solemn and formal rites, the various branches of the Yu family descended the mountain, and the ancestral hall immediately fell silent.

Yu Xinglong had Yu Chenglin light a stick of incense for his elder brother, Yu Chengye, then took his hand. Father and son slowly walked out of the hall.

In a corner of the courtyard stood an ancient, gnarled tree. In yesterday's thunderstorm, this long-hollowed-out tree, its insides eaten away by insects, had finally fallen. However, because it was so massive, requiring three people to encircle it with their arms, it had not yet been cleared away.

Yu Xinglong looked at the fallen giant and said to Yu Chenglin, "My son, from today onward, you are the heir of the Yu family. The day I am no longer here, you will be the master of our house."

Yu Chenglin held his father's hand, feeling it was as cold as freshly drawn well water.

"Father, why make me the heir? I heard some of my cousins say I'm too young to be the heir."

Yu Xinglong smiled faintly and looked down at him. "Chenglin, this was fought for with your elder brother's life. It can only belong to you!"

Yu Chenglin bit his lip and hesitantly asked, "But, can I be a good patriarch? Will my uncles and elders listen to me?"

Yu Xinglong said, "That is why you must work harder than before. Study diligently, practice martial arts well, and become even more outstanding than your elder brother in the future. Only then can you become a qualified family head."

Yu Xinglong sighed deeply and said in a low voice, "Our Yu clan was established in Tianshui nearly three hundred years ago. Through all the storms of these three hundred years, we have been able to preserve this glorious ancestral heritage. This is, of course, due to the tireless struggles of our ancestors through the generations, but an orderly succession is also an important reason."

Yu Xinglong pointed to the fallen tree and said, "Look at this old tree. It was here long before our family estate was built. It took at least five hundred years to grow this thick. Yet it fell in a single night of wind and rain!"

Yu Xinglong patted his son's head and said in a low, heavy voice, "Chenglin, you must remember, the heir must be the legitimate and eldest son! Power must be firmly held by the main lineage. If I were to make your second uncle's son the heir today, once this precedent is set, won't everyone think they have a chance in the future? Once there are no rules, great chaos will ensue!"

The seven-year-old Yu Chenglin looked up at his father, only half-understanding his words.

Yu Xinglong said, "Your second uncle is an ambitious man. In fact, if he were to become the patriarch, he would probably do a better job than your father. However, that 'better' would only last for our generation, while the calamity it brings would be endless for generations to come."

Yu Xinglong gently shook his head. "No, it wouldn't even need to be generations. If we did that, our Yu clan would likely fall apart within three generations, becoming mere fish on someone else's chopping block."

Yu Chenglin did not understand such profound words, but he tried his best to commit every one of his father's words to memory. He thought, it's okay that I don't understand now. As long as I remember them, I will surely understand one day.

Yu Xinglong said gently to Yu Chenglin, "So, Chenglin, you may not be the most outstanding descendant of our Yu family. But you are the most suitable. Do you understand?"

Yu Chenglin nodded vigorously.

Yu Xinglong smiled, then raised his eyes to look at the white clouds in the sky outside the courtyard, his gaze suddenly becoming distant.

"Chenglin, your elder brother and his wife consummated their marriage on the way back to Tianshui. By my calculations, in a few more days, a skilled physician will be able to tell if she is with child. If your sister-in-law is truly pregnant, you will soon be an uncle."

Upon hearing this, Yu Chenglin's eyes immediately lit up with excitement. He was still young and felt an inexplicable joy and anticipation at becoming an elder.

However, Yu Xinglong's expression became a bit strange. He suddenly asked Yu Chenglin seriously, "Chenglin, tell me, do you really think your elder brother and his wife have consummated their marriage?"

Yu Chenglin didn't quite understand what "consummation" meant. Wasn't it just sleeping in the same room? In his mind, his sister-in-law was his brother's wife, so it was perfectly normal for them to sleep together.

So, Yu Chenglin answered earnestly, "It should be true. Sister-in-law is so beautiful."

Yu Xinglong couldn't help but laugh. "You little brat, what do you know about beauty and ugliness at your age?"

Yu Chenglin protested, "Of course I know! Sister-in-law is beautiful, the most beautiful woman I've ever seen."

"Haha... *cough, cough*..." Yu Xinglong laughed heartily, laughing until tears formed. He took out a handkerchief and wiped the corners of his eyes. "Go on, go back now. Don't be late for your studies."

Yu Chenglin obediently agreed. He walked properly to the gate of the courtyard. Once he was off the steps, he lifted the hem of his robe and ran off.

Watching his son's back disappear into the distance, Yu Xinglong let out a long sigh and murmured to himself, "Chengye, if your spirit is watching over us, bless your brother that all may go smoothly and safely, and bless our Yu clan's foundation that it may prosper for generations."

When Yu Xinglong returned to his study, Yang Can had been waiting there for a long time. He had been summoned by Steward Deng. When he had arrived at the study, the ceremony at the ancestral hall was still in progress.

Yu Xinglong walked into the study and had someone bring Yang Can in. Yang Can had just finished paying his respects when Yu Xinglong suddenly asked, "Yang Can, when did you become Huan Hu's man?"

Yang Can was startled and said in confusion, "What?"

From the moment Yang Can entered, Yu Xinglong and Steward Deng, standing by his side, had been watching him closely, observing his every reaction. Even the most skilled dissembler would have some subconscious reaction when their secret was suddenly exposed. But Yang Can had none at all.

Yu Xinglong said, "If you aren't Huan Hu's man, why did you do everything you could to clear his name in the Mingde Hall?"

Yang Can suddenly understood and quickly defended himself, "You misunderstand, Patriarch! This one was not speaking for the Second Master!"

Yu Xinglong looked at Yang Can calmly, waiting for a reasonable explanation.

Yang Can said, "Patriarch, the Young Master's death is shrouded in mystery. Without ironclad evidence, the Second Master's罪 cannot be proven."

Yu Xinglong said, "But that doesn't clear him of suspicion, does it?"

"That is true. But now, has the Second Master cleared his suspicion?"

"Whether he has cleared his suspicion or not, what is your reason for speaking for him?"

"This one was not speaking for the Second Master. This one was merely helping the Patriarch guard against the Suo family and reserving an excuse for you."

Yu Xinglong's expression darkened slightly, and his voice turned cold. "Yang Can, what do you mean by this?"

"Patriarch, the Young Master treated me as his confidant and often spoke to me of his concerns. The position of patriarch is a throne the Second Master has long dreamed of. And our Yu family's fertile lands are a prize the Suo family covets desperately. The Patriarch was beset by internal and external troubles, and the Young Master felt this deeply, worrying day and night. I wished I could have borne this burden for him." Yang Can spoke with great emotion. "The Young Master met his不幸, and I have yet to repay the kindness of his recognition. The only way I can be worthy of his trust is to serve the Patriarch with all my loyalty."

After a moment of silence, Yu Xinglong narrowed his eyes slightly. "So, you insisted the Suo family was a suspect because you did not want the old man to be taken advantage of by them?"

"Precisely! No matter what I said, the Second Master could not be cleared of suspicion. Moreover, for the sake of the bigger picture, the Patriarch would never have put him to death anyway. So, no matter what I said or did, it wouldn't actually affect the Patriarch's plans for the Second Master. However, with my accusation, it becomes a reason the Patriarch can use at any time to restrain the Suo family." Yang Can added, "You can believe what I have said, Patriarch, or you can disbelieve it. You can believe it now, or you can believe it in the future. That is the reason for my accusation against the Suo family."

Yu Xinglong's gaze sharpened slightly. He did not know if his son, Yu Chengye, had ever told Yang Can about the complex relationship between the Yu and Suo families—a relationship of both mutual use and mutual defense. But even if his son had indeed treated Yang Can as a confidant and spoken of these matters, for Yang Can to be able to think of such a plan from this angle after his son's death... Whether this man truly felt gratitude for his son's recognition or hoped to use this as a stepping stone, his cunning could not be underestimated.

Yu Xinglong pondered for a moment, then suddenly asked, "You are not from Longshang. You are from the Central Plains?"

"Yes!"

"Why did you leave the Central Plains?"

"Because..."

Yang Can hesitated for a moment, then lowered his head and said in a low voice, "This one was originally a scholar from a humble family. I had the good fortune to meet the eldest daughter of the Luo family from the south at a Buddhist temple. I fell in love with Miss Luo at first sight and we secretly pledged our lives to each other. Unfortunately, when the Luo family found out, they sent their powerful servants to kill my entire family. Only I escaped by a fluke..." At this point, Yang Can's voice was choked with emotion, as if he could not continue.

Yu Xinglong understood immediately. The aristocratic families of the Central Plains were most proud of their lineage and blood. If a lowly person tried to marry into a noble family, they would be ruthlessly suppressed. Those noble families usually did not put too much pressure on their children; they had a simpler, more direct, and more effective method. That was to make the person who did not know their place and aspired to climb high disappear, along with their entire family.

Yu Xinglong nodded and asked again, "Was your original name really Yang Can?"

Yang Can said, "I dare not deceive the Patriarch. This one's original name was... Ding Hao!"

Yu Xinglong grunted. "Now that you are under my command, the Luo family of the south can do nothing to you. You may resume your original name and surname."

Yang Can said excitedly, "Thank you, Patriarch! But I swore an oath that I will not resume the name my parents gave me until I can avenge my family!"

Yu Xinglong showed a hint of admiration. "To have such a thought is very rare. You may withdraw."

"Yes! This one takes his leave." Yang Can cupped his fist in a salute and left the study.

Yu Xinglong leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and thought for a while. Then he said in a casual tone, "Xiao Deng, what do you think of this Yang Can?"
