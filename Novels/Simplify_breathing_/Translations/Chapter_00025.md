# Chapter 25: A Small Gain

"Then there's nothing I can do. I'll sell it to you when I learn how to refine it someday."

Chen Fei waved his hand and turned to leave. After mastering the Azure Spirit Pill, Chen Fei would indeed put it up for sale, as it was more valuable. As for the Ever-Floating Pill, even if he could make it, he wouldn't sell it. An innocent man is guilty of possessing a treasure. Chen Fei's current strength to protect himself was insufficient. At that time, he could easily be caught and turned into an alchemist who could only refine medicine.

Leaving the black market, Chen Fei shook off the few tails following him. As Chen Fei sold Grass Reversion Pills in the black market, more and more people started tracking him. Fortunately, Chen Fei's movement technique had progressed, and ordinary people couldn't keep up with his pace. However, a mere Grass Reversion Pill wouldn't attract any powerful masters. After circling the county a few more times, Chen Fei returned to the courtyard of the alchemist's chamber. Opening his money pouch and looking at the glistening silver inside, a smile involuntarily appeared on Chen Fei's face. Nearly six hundred taels of silver. In the eyes of ordinary people, this was a huge sum, and Chen Fei had accumulated this money within a few days.

"Surprising a Bone Forging Realm expert with such a sword strike would probably leave them in a bad state!" Chen Fei secretly estimated that if Jian Liang, whom he met earlier, and Sun Shu from last night, were caught off guard, they would indeed be seriously injured. Then, by using Immortal's Guidance a few more times, he might be able to kill them. Repeatedly using the same move would easily expose its flaws, but if the opponent was severely injured, they wouldn't have the leisure to look for weaknesses. Chen Fei felt a slight increase in his sense of security, but it was far from enough. He felt he still needed to work harder.

"Young Miss!"

Entering through the side door and walking to the separate courtyard, Chen Fei saw Zhang Sinan in the pavilion, seemingly lost in thought, and called out to her.

"You've arrived, sit." Zhang Sinan saw Chen Fei, and seeming to know his purpose, her brows furrowed slightly as she said, "Is it for the Azure Spirit Pill's formula?"

“Yes, Young Miss, please bestow it upon me,” Chen Fei said, cupping his hands.

“I'm afraid I cannot give you the formula for the Azure Spirit Pill,” Zhang Sinan said after a moment of hesitation.

“Why? You promised before.”

Zhang Sinan nodded, called a servant, and gave a few instructions. In just a moment, four sword technique manuals were placed before Chen Fei.

"These few manuals are quite good, choose one."

“May I look at each of them?” Chen Fei asked after thinking for a moment.

“You may,” Zhang Sinan nodded in agreement.

Chen Fei picked up the first one, Scorching Gale Sword, and began flipping through it. Perhaps it was due to Chen Fei's comprehension of the Immortal's Guidance sword move, but as he read Scorching Gale Sword, many of the sword principles seemed instantly clear to him. In just a quarter of an hour, Chen Fei finished perusing Scorching Gale Sword. He subconsciously looked at his panel, his eyes lighting up.

"I can get three for free?" This thought involuntarily popped into Chen Fei's mind. He looked up at Zhang Sinan, saw that her attention wasn't on him at all, and the corners of his mouth subtly curved upwards. He put down the manual in his hand and began flipping through the second sword technique.
