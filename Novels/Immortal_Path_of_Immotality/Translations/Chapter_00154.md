# Chapter 153: The Sect Leader Orders Me to Ambush a Fellow Disciple

The purple eerie tentacles on Bear Mountain Master's body had just been forcibly suppressed by over a hundred Golden Core guardians from the demonic path working together. But unexpectedly, a golden light barrier suddenly emerged.

Not only did it repel the Black Lotus Sect's Sect Leader, but there was also an old master possessing him!

"This humble disciple doesn't know what wrong he has committed. Why must everyone be so angry?"

At the same time, the three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings seated on the platform and Lin Shan below all recognized the speaker's identity.

Pure Lotus Hermit.

A Nascent Soul mighty figure among the loose cultivators of the Eastern Sea.

Bear Mountain Master had actually become his disciple?

Lin Shan was utterly shocked. He truly couldn't comprehend why a Nascent Soul mighty figure would take someone like Bear Mountain Master as a disciple—someone with no talent, no bone structure, and no moral character.

A middle-aged man still at the Foundation Establishment stage, a pirate leader in the Eastern Sea with countless killings to his name, lacking in talent and notorious for his misdeeds—no one in their right mind would consider taking him as a disciple. Why would Pure Lotus Hermit take a fancy to him?

At this moment, the Dharma King seated in the center among the three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings on the platform spoke in a deep voice.

"Fellow Daoist Pure Lotus, this person is a registered disciple of the Black Lotus Sect. Please do not interfere in our sect's internal affairs!"

The old master possessing Bear Mountain Master was hidden somewhere unknown, and Bear Mountain Master himself looked around in confusion, searching for the source of the voice.

"Hehe, this child took me as his master a year ago. As his master, how can I stand by and do nothing?"

The Dharma King abruptly stood up, the whites of his eyes instantly filling with pupils as if activating some pupil technique to directly lock onto the source of the voice.

"I don't care what relationship you have with him. He is a suspect in our sect's case of stolen faith and must undergo a soul search to get to the truth!"

"My disciple left Bitter Beard Island just three months ago. Fellow Daoist must be mistaken."

"Whether it's a mistake or not, neither you nor I can decide! A soul search will reveal the truth!"

"And if it turns out he's innocent?"

"If he's innocent, our sect will invite you for a discussion, publicly apologize, and turn hostility into friendship!"

"HAHAHAHA—"

Pure Lotus Hermit couldn't help but burst into laughter upon hearing this, the mockery in his voice unmistakable. It seemed to mock the Dharma King's ruthlessness or perhaps the Black Lotus Sect's domineering arrogance.

"Publicly apologize? The Black Lotus Sect has hundreds of thousands of cultivators in Bianliang Camp, hundreds at the Golden Core stage, and three Nascent Soul cultivators. If I were to come alone, wouldn't that be like a lamb entering a tiger's den with no way out?"

"Such a foolish act is something this old man would never do."

Seeing that his ploy didn't work, the Dharma King exchanged glances with the other two Nascent Soul Dharma Kings beside him. Their divine senses surged, frantically scanning every movement within dozens of miles to see if Pure Lotus Hermit was hiding nearby.

All the cultivators in the hall sat stiffly, feeling the terrifying divine senses sweep over them like an abyss or prison, deeply realizing the vast gap between the Golden Core and Nascent Soul stages.

"Fellow Daoist Pure Lotus is indeed cautious, sending only a split soul while keeping your main body thousands of miles away."

"If I'm not mistaken, the traces of faith on your disciple were left by you. It seems you also cultivate a faith-based technique!"

"The theft of the Buddha statue's faith three days ago must be related to you."

With just a few words, the Nascent Soul mighty figures seemed to deduce many hidden truths. For some reason, the Dharma King firmly believed that Pure Lotus Hermit was behind the theft of faith from the giant Black Lotus Buddha statue three days ago, refusing to accept any explanations.

"Fine, fine! It seems no matter what I say, the Dharma King won't believe me. Do as you wish."

"Fellow Daoist Pure Lotus, faith and belief are the foundation of our cultivation. We cannot be careless."

"I understand that as well. But I've only cultivated a faith-based divine ability and don't have much need for such things. There's no reason for me to compete with you for them."

"If this matter was indeed your doing, please return what was taken."

"Absolutely not! If the Dharma King wishes to search my disciple's soul, go ahead. But remember, you are currently at war with the righteous path. Don't say I didn't warn you!"

This was a blatant threat.

Clearly, as a Nascent Soul loose cultivator, Pure Lotus Hermit had the strength and confidence to back his words. Though he dared not enter their camp to cause trouble, what about their foundations in the Eastern Sea?

Or perhaps joining the righteous path, adding another Nascent Soul combatant to their enemies, would significantly tip the scales of the war. The consequences were self-evident.

After a moment of silence, the hall felt like a volcano on the verge of eruption, its energy accumulating with no outlet, ready to explode.

All the Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators wore grave expressions, sensing the fiery rage in the hearts of the Nascent Soul Dharma Kings. The Black Lotus Sect was a top-tier sect, and even with only half their strength deployed here, they had already crushed the righteous path coalition.

Yet a mere Nascent Soul loose cultivator dared to threaten a top-tier sect. If not for the war and the constraints of their enemies, the sect would mobilize all its Nascent Soul cultivators to hunt him down to the ends of the earth.

But the next moment, the Dharma King suddenly relaxed, a faint smile appearing on his lips.

"Very well. It seems this matter has nothing to do with Fellow Daoist Pure Lotus. I must have wronged you."

Everyone in the hall lowered their heads, not daring to speak another word.

Though the sect's major decisions ostensibly rested with the Sect Leader, the Dharma Kings, as the true top-tier combatants, usually delegated authority and stayed out of affairs. But when they did intervene, their word was absolute.

Pure Lotus Hermit's split soul also sighed in relief. It was best to avoid making enemies. "Thank you for your understanding. As for my disciple—"

"Whether he stays or leaves is up to you."

With that, the Dharma King turned and left the hall through the back door. The other two Nascent Soul Dharma Kings, united in purpose, followed without another word.

Thus, the farce came to an end. Everyone present breathed a sigh of relief. A peaceful resolution was best—they had no desire to make an enemy of a Nascent Soul loose cultivator.

The Sect Leader then announced the meeting adjourned, and everyone filed out of the central military council hall in an orderly manner.

As for the theft of the Buddha statue's faith, with Pure Lotus Hermit's involvement, the matter was quietly dropped.

That same day, Lin Shan immediately submitted a request to return to the temporary headquarters in the Eastern Sea for recuperation. Unsurprisingly, it was quickly approved, with the Sect Leader's personal endorsement:

"Approved!"

At the same time, a message talisman landed in his hand.

It contained a message from the Sect Leader, first praising him for his impressive cultivation at a young age and his potential to reach the Golden Core stage, becoming a pillar of the sect.

Next, he commended Lin Shan for his exceptional skills, having managed to kill a true disciple of the Dry Cloud Pavilion. Upon his return, the sect would increase his cultivation resources and prioritize his development.

Finally, he was assigned a confidential mission. Another person would be returning to the Eastern Sea temporary headquarters—a middle-aged man with a dull expression, also at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Lin Shan's task was to kill this man before they reached their destination.

Of course, the fact that this dull-looking man had once assassinated the Sect Leader's illegitimate son would never be revealed to Lin Shan. He only needed to follow orders.

The demonic path acted as they pleased. Even as the Sect Leader, with the big picture in mind, blood demanded blood. If the target had been a Golden Core guardian, he might have hesitated over the loss of combat strength. But for a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, there were no such concerns.

After listening to the message, the talisman burst into flames and burned to ashes—clearly, the Sect Leader wanted no evidence left behind. Such dirty work didn't require his personal involvement. With a little authority and the right incentives, there were always people willing to do the job.

If you refused, others would fight for the opportunity. Assigning it to you was a chance, a sign of favor, a test of your abilities—how well could you execute the task? How efficient? How cleanly could you tie up loose ends?

As the leader of a top-tier sect, many matters were simplified. Avenging his illegitimate son while also assessing Lin Shan's worthiness for cultivation resources—this was killing two birds with one stone.

Upon receiving the secret order, Lin Shan was initially thrilled. The Black Lotus Sect's Sect Leader favored him? Wouldn't that make it easier to infiltrate the power center and steal ancient charms? But the nature of the test left him puzzled.

The Sect Leader was ordering him to ambush a fellow disciple?
