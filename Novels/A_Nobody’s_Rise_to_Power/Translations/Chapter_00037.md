Chapter 37: Striking the Tiger

Pan Xiaowan did not rush to fetch the wine upon entering the inner room.

Her steps suddenly became light and brisk, her feet treading as if strolling through a starry sky.

This was the "Yu Step," a dance step more ancient and unique than the circular or cloud steps of opera. It was a unique creation of ancient shamans and is now nearly lost to the world.

She slid forward and drifted sideways, then made a charming turn, sliding right up to the carved wardrobe.

Madam Pan opened the cabinet, changed her clothes, and drifted over to her vanity table to touch up her makeup.

In the mirror was a face as delicate as a hibiscus, with brows like distant mountains and eyes containing the clarity of autumn waters—the prime of her "twenty years of peach and plum blossoms in the spring breeze."

She picked up her dark eyebrow pencil and meticulously traced her brows. Then, she took out some rouge, dabbed a bit with her fingertip, and pressed it to her lips.

She pressed her lips together into a thin line, and when she relaxed them back into their full, petal-like shape, their color was as vivid as a peach or plum.

Pouting, she blew a kiss to her reflection in the mirror, then took a sachet from the very bottom of her jewelry box.

She first took something out of the sachet, gently tore it open, and stuffed it back inside. Then, she hung the sachet from her waist.

Finally, she adjusted her golden hairpin in the mirror before taking the ox-horn flask of wine and gracefully walking out.

With Laixi having been sent away, there was no one to serve tea, so Yang Can could only sit idly in his chair.

After a long wait, Yang Can’s patience was wearing thin. Just as he was about to get up, Madam Pan emerged from behind the screen.

She had changed into a sea-blossom red ruqun. The fabric was light and soft, clinging to her figure, perfectly defining her waist and hips.

Her figure was truly exquisite; the air itself seemed to take shape around her, flowing like water in an alluring, graceful dance.

"Brother-in-law, this is the fine medicinal wine given to that old thing by the Master of Feng'an Manor. It is said to be extremely nourishing," Pan Xiaowan said, her voice three parts softer and three parts more seductive than usual.

There was no longer a trace of the disdain and impatience she had shown in front of Li Youcai.

She carried the large, ox-horn flask, which had been treated until it was as warm and translucent as jade, and placed it on the small table beside Yang Can. She then turned to fetch two thin, cicada-wing-like jade-colored cups.

"The more that old thing fails in bed, the more he fears others will find out. For the sake of his face, he actually gave all the wine to you. I hear this wine is best for strengthening the root and nourishing the source. Would it be so bad if your sister-in-law had a cup?"

Yang Can replied awkwardly, "Of course not."

Pan Xiaowan gave a dazzling smile, pulled the stopper from the horn, and poured two cups. She picked them up and walked gracefully to Yang Can's side, offering him one.

Yang Can was about to stand up, but Madam Pan stopped him with a look. She bent her slender waist, looking at Yang Can with a smile, and handed him the cup with her fingers, which were stained with nail polish.

The pale red liquid in the cup exuded the fragrance of both wine and medicine. The wine swayed in the cup, and the light in Madam Pan's eyes swayed with it. Her gaze was watery and deep, as if it could drown a man within it.

Yang Can took the cup. Madam Pan clinked her cup against his, her red lips parting slightly. "Brother-in-law, have a drink with your sister-in-law."

Yang Can swirled the cup, lowered his head to take a sniff, and looked utterly intoxicated, but he just wouldn't drink.

Madam Pan giggled and gave him a charming, reproachful glance. "Worried I've drugged you, aren't you? Honestly."

She chided him playfully, slowly raising her cup high above her head, then tilting her head back and opening her mouth. The cup tilted, and a thin stream of wine poured directly into her mouth.

Only after she had emptied the entire cup did she look at Yang Can with a teasing expression.

Yang Can breathed a sigh of relief and downed his wine in one gulp.

Madam Pan took a step closer and blinked at him. "How is the wine?"

"It tastes good."

Madam Pan took another step forward. "Then... does it have the effect of strengthening the root and nourishing the source?"

As she spoke, her hand naturally rested on Yang Can's shoulder. Her eyes glanced sideways, overflowing with the promise of spring.

Yang Can gave a wry smile. "Madam, even if this is medicinal wine, it's still wine. How could the effect be so fast?"

Madam Pan giggled. "You're right, I was just too impatient."

She had taken two steps forward, and since she was facing Yang Can directly, she was now standing right between his legs. Yang Can was sitting while she was standing. If he looked up, the view would be awkward, so he kept his gaze level.

But this meant all he could see was her slender, flexible waist, like a snake's. The waist was tied with a purple silk ribbon, from which a sachet hung.

The scent was strangely pleasant.

Yang Can suddenly felt his eyes glaze over. What was worse, it wasn't just his eyes that were stiffening.

He didn't know that the wine hadn't been tampered with; the sachet on Madam Pan's waist was the real weapon against him. The herbs inside were also a type of medicine, a potent concoction secretly prepared by shamans.

At that moment, Madam Pan stood while Yang Can sat. She was so close that the sachet hanging at her waist seemed to be right under Yang Can's nose. If not for that, with the wine and medicinal aromas masking it, Yang Can wouldn't have been able to smell the unique fragrance from the sachet.

Madam Pan looked at Yang Can and giggled. She could see that this little heartthrob had finally fallen for her trap.

She had originally intended to take things slowly, to have a mutual and joyful affair. Unfortunately, despite his youth, this young man had remarkable self-control. If she took it slow, who knew how long she would have to wait.

She had been trying to seduce this handsome young clerk for over three months, and she was no longer willing to wait.

*Click!*

Madam Pan snatched the empty cup from Yang Can's hand, placed it on the table, and wrapped her arms around his neck.

When the big rooster crowed at dawn, Yang Can woke up.

Last night, just as things were about to come to a head, Yang Can had finally run away.

To be honest, who wouldn't like a beauty like Madam Pan? But in the end, her identity was a barrier, and Yang Can dared not act recklessly.

Especially since he was now in the main household of the Yu family and still had to survive a life-threatening calamity ten months away. It was uncertain whether attracting such a fiery woman would be a blessing or a curse.

The drug Madam Pan used was an aphrodisiac. In her mind, a hot-blooded young man, a beautiful woman like herself, and the effect of the drug—how could it not lead to a natural conclusion?

But Yang Can thought of the many eyes and ears everywhere in the main household. If the affair were exposed, not only would he face the calamity ten months later, but he would likely be ruined immediately.

Besides, wasn't Suo Chanzhi also a beauty?

It was a combination of his uncontrollable worries about Pan Xiaowan and Suo Chanzhi's peerless beauty that helped him maintain a sliver of clarity and, at the critical moment, escape.

Now, waking up and recalling the moment, it would be untrue to say he felt no stirrings of desire.

But thinking of the possible consequences, he still felt that not going through with it was the right choice.

Actually, Pan Xiaowan was the wife of Head Steward Li. If he could make her his intimate, it would certainly be beneficial for Yang Can to expand his influence in the main household.

But that honey might be hiding poison within it.

Yang Can didn't know Pan Xiaowan's other identity; he just instinctively felt that her boldness and initiative meant she wouldn't be easy to handle.

Yang Can had not been awake for long and had just finished washing up when Madam Pan sent Laixi over with breakfast.

After sending Laixi with the breakfast she had carefully prepared, and thinking of his heartless departure last night, Pan Xiaowan couldn't help but feel a mix of hatred and affection.

She had never expected Yang Can to resist her temptation last night. She had been vexed for half the night and resentful for half the night, but her mindset had changed as a result.

Originally, she had just taken a liking to Yang Can at first sight and wanted to find a lover. She hadn't had any other intentions toward him. She approached him without any thought of using him, because she simply didn't think Yang Can could become a pivotal figure in the main household or the entire Yu family.

She just genuinely liked this handsome young clerk and wanted to establish the simplest, most straightforward kind of relationship with him. Her life was already complicated enough; she had emotions too, she was a flesh-and-blood person. She also wanted to sometimes be able to put down all her burdens and have a harbor where she could completely relax.

Ever since she saw Yang Can, she felt she had found it. That man was exactly to her taste in every way.

But he had rejected her.

However, precisely because Yang Can had rejected her, it made her think even more highly of him.

But of course, she wouldn't give up, nor was she convinced. Madam Pan was also very confident in her own charm. She firmly believed that this little heartthrob would be in her pocket sooner or later.

Watching Laixi walk out of the courtyard with the food box, Madam Pan finally retracted her gaze. Her eyes shifted, and she saw a branch of red apricot blossoms peeking over the wall from the apricot tree in the corner.

Madam Pan smiled, as sweetly as the apricot blossoms on the branch.

Seeing the breakfast Madam Pan had sent with Laixi, Yang Can felt a warmth in his heart.

Any man would feel guilty for failing to repay such kindness from a beauty.

It was just that this kindness was too heavy; on the other end of the scale was Head Steward Li Youcai.

"Ah... Laixi, thank Madam Pan for me."

Laixi said with a grin, "Sure thing! Please have your breakfast, Master Yang. I'll come back to clean up later."

"No need, no need. I'll have Wangcai wash the dishes and return them later."

Laixi agreed and left. The breakfast had a good mix of meat and vegetables and tasted quite pleasant.

Yang Can ate about seventy to eighty percent of the meal and was about to call Wangcai in to clean up and wash the dishes before returning the food box.

Before he could call, however, Wangcai ran in first.

"Master, a guest is here."

"A guest?"

Yang Can was taken aback. He had just taken office; who would come to visit him?

"Clean up the bowls and chopsticks, wash them and return them to Madam Pan's place," Yang Can instructed before walking toward the main hall.

In the main hall, a tall, imposing figure stood with his head held high, looking up at a scroll of calligraphy on the wall.

The man wore a tan headband tied into a hero's knot at the back of his head. He held a wild goose feather saber in his hand, standing with his feet apart in a stable, mountain-like stance, full of heroic spirit.

Seeing his peerlessly domineering aura, and thinking of the ambiguous situation with Madam Pan last night, Yang Can was afraid he might suddenly turn around to reveal the face of Zhu Yanping or Ding Haifeng, and then shout a line: "Sister-in-law, Wu Er has something to say!"
