# Chapter 168: Art Imitates Life, Enemy Ambush!

**The Tyrannical Empress Falls in Love with Me?!**

To be honest.

When Ouyang heard this title, his heart trembled, and he desperately wanted to know the content.

"Why did you give it such a name?" Princess Jiang Chulong asked, hugging her knees with curiosity.

She had never heard of a female emperor appearing in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Could it be that the story Brother Li was telling was like the teacher's, a story from a very distant era?

"Why did you... choose such a title?" Ying Bing narrowed her phoenix eyes slightly.

She took another cup and brewed some tea, taking a sip.

"This involves professional knowledge."

Li Mo was feeling a bit thirsty.

When one is showing off, they don't use their brain power.

He casually took Ying Bing's cup and took a sip.

Ying Bing opened her mouth slightly.

But immediately, Li Mo said:

"Let me ask, what is the most important thing for a best-selling work?"

"A... a good story?" Jiang Chulong said softly. As soon as she finished speaking, she noticed Brother Li looking at her and shyly buried her head again.

"Not entirely correct," Li Mo said with a smile, rubbing her little head.

"It must be enough to be spicy... enough to be rich and colorful," Ouyang felt he was quite authoritative in this area.

Which junior brother in the sect doesn't like good-looking picture books!

If it weren't for the laws of the Great Yu Dynasty prohibiting it, he would have already made it big!

"Content only determines whether the audience will like the book after reading it," Li Mo shook his head.

"If people aren't attracted in the first place, no matter how good the content is, it can't be seen. So, the most important thing for a best-selling work is... to grab attention! With a captivating title, you can attract the audience's attention the fastest!"

Ouyang: "!"

A thunderclap went through his heart.

No wonder Senior Brother Li chose such a strange name.

Regardless of whether the name is strange or not, he was indeed hooked as soon as he heard it!

"Listening to your words is better than painting for ten years!"

"You flatter me."

"Brother Li, please tell us the content. If I don't hear it, I won't be able to sleep tonight."

"Alright."

*Slap—*

Li Mo couldn't find the gavel.

So he casually grabbed the big-headed doll next to the Ice Cube and slammed it onto the tea table.

Ying Bing: "?"

She frowned slightly, but seeing that Li Mo was in high spirits, she didn't say anything in the end.

"The story begins in the Four Seas and Eight Wastes, where the forces of good and evil are fighting, the wind is rising and clouds are surging, and it is in the midst of a great trend."

"However, in this treacherous and unpredictable Jianghu, there is a force that stands aloof from the world, that is..."

Little Li, who was bad at naming, paused.

He glanced at the Ice Cube out of the corner of his eye before continuing:

"The Snow Moon Palace!"

"There is a female emperor in the Snow Moon Palace, as pure as a cold moon, like a celestial being, unparalleled in the world."

"However, what truly allows the Snow Moon Palace to stand at the pinnacle of the world and remain aloof is her god-like and devil-like power."

"Her name is Liu Wuyan!"

Jiang Chulong clapped her hands excitedly, then subconsciously glanced at the girl next to her.

She felt that Sister Bing and this female protagonist were somewhat similar?

Not just similar...

Ying Bing felt a strange feeling in her heart.

Wasn't this her past life, except for the name?

Ouyang's interest grew even stronger, and he asked:

"Brother Li, how did you come up with such an interesting character?"

Li Mo took another sip of tea:

"Art imitates life."

"Life..."

Ouyang glanced at Junior Sister Ying Bing.

Hmm.

That makes perfect sense.

"Speaking of which, Liu Wuyan had been in the Snow Moon Palace for a long time, standing at the top of the world, cold and lonely. Her only hobby was going to the secluded back mountain to admire the snow."

"One day, she changed into ordinary clothes as usual and went to the back mountain alone."

"But she discovered that an uninvited guest had arrived here."

"He is called Jiang Chen, an ordinary disciple of the Snow Moon Palace. He has a gentle temperament and is warm-hearted..."

"Someone asked him to deliver a letter to the woman here."

Li Mo's words were like blooming flowers, explaining the plot in a simple and engaging way.

At the beginning, someone wanted to kill the male protagonist, so they tricked him into delivering a letter.

The content of this letter turned out to be a love letter!

As everyone knows, Liu Wuyan hates love the most in her life!

And Jiang Chen had never seen this female emperor who was high in the clouds, so he was completely unaware that he had delivered a love letter into the hands of the female emperor!

"Whew!"

Ouyang felt a chilling sensation on his scalp.

Just this opening made his scalp tingle, and he was itching to know the rest of the plot.

It's addictive, damn it, so addictive!

His previous picture books only had pictures, no plot.

If his painting skills were combined with such a story... who would still be willing to read the current storybooks?

Jiang Chulong's eyes behind the cloth strip were shining, obviously also attracted by the story.

Ying Bing was slightly lost in thought.

A... love letter?

If she had received a love letter when she was the master of the桂宫 (Guigong), just by reading two lines, the messenger would have been beheaded. How would the subsequent plot even...

Did the male protagonist die in the first plot?

Ying Bing raised her eyes, but saw the young man, as warm as jade, talking eloquently with a gentle smile.

She unconsciously began to equate him with the male protagonist.

Perhaps, maybe, she would also listen to two words of explanation...

"After the first delivery, Liu Wuyan didn't kill him."

"The mastermind behind the scenes saw that the plan had failed, so they wrote the letters more and more explicit and passionate."

"And during the process of delivering the letters time and time again, Liu Wuyan also discovered that someone was manipulating things from behind the scenes."

"So on this day, to turn the tables, she actually pinned Jiang Chen against the wall... and accepted his confession!"

"Wow..." Jiang Chulong touched her own hot cheeks.

Ouyang: "!"

This plot was simply irresistible.

He didn't even have the energy to think about painting anymore; he just wanted to know how to keep listening to the story. If it suddenly stopped here, he was afraid he would have withdrawal symptoms.

"Accepting... the confession?!" Ying Bing looked away, as if she hadn't heard anything.

However, her curled fingers gripping the hem of her skirt tightly showed that our Empress of the Phoenix was not as calm on the inside as she appeared on the surface.

Listening very intently, aren't you, Ice Cube...

Just as the story reached its climax.

*Squeak—*

The carriage suddenly lurched to a halt.

"Enemy ambush!" came the voice of Senior Sister Xu Zhiqing from outside.

The atmosphere inside the carriage instantly froze.

"It seems we can only stop here for today," Li Mo said with a helpless smile, then frowned.

He really didn't want to stop at a critical moment.

Who would dare to ambush the Clear Abyss Sect's convoy?

To encounter such a thing.

Ouyang, with a dark face, rolled up his sleeves and rushed out.

"Who the hell is it?!"
