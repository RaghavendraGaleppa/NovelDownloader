# Chapter 156: Return to the Upper Realm, the Secret Realm Approaches

"Is this really my wife?!"

The aged Zhang father could no longer contain his complex emotions as he murmured these words, his clouded eyes brimming with excitement.

The emerald-green immortal light gradually faded before his eyes.

A youthful figure who appeared no older than eighteen or nineteen came into view.

Zhang father stared intently at his wife on the bed, unable to tear his gaze away for even a moment.

His memories instantly flashed back fifty years.

Back then, he had been a young man in his early twenties, toiling to manage the Zhang Family Herbal Shop inherited from his parents.

But it was that very year.

He met Zhang mother, who had fled to Yong'an from Yunzhou to escape a demonic calamity.

"Who would have thought that a lifetime would pass in the blink of an eye."

Zhang father's face was full of nostalgia.

Then, as if realizing something.

He reluctantly shifted his gaze from Zhang mother to his own wrinkled hands, his expression gradually freezing.

Something seemed... off.

Beside Zhang father.

Zhang Nianjing and Zhang Fan exchanged glances, both seeing a trace of unreality in each other's eyes.

The miraculous transformation before them gave them the surreal feeling of being in a dream.

Yet—

They both knew deep down.

Everything they were witnessing was undeniably real.

At this thought.

They simultaneously turned their gazes toward their elder brother who had suddenly returned from the legendary Upper Realm, their eyes filled with intense pride and admiration.

What even the Academy Head and Pavilion Masters couldn't resolve.

Their brother had treated as a trivial matter, solving it effortlessly.

This was their elder brother!

Meanwhile.

Only when the immortal light enveloping Zhang mother completely dissipated.

Did the Academy Head and five Pavilion Masters snap out of their daze, staring straight at Zhang Jing's back with growing astonishment in their eyes.

As long-lived Golden Core Divine Ability realm existences.

They knew far more than Zhang Nianjing and her brother.

And precisely because of this.

The shock in their hearts was even greater.

Subtle, almost imperceptible spiritual fluctuations filled the room.

"According to records, life-extending treasures are extremely precious even in the Upper Realm. Zhang Jing has only been in the Upper Realm for just over thirty years, yet he could produce one so easily."

Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master exhaled lightly, his voice tinged with disbelief.

"The key is he didn't hesitate at all, directly using the treasure on his mother. Haha, such pure filial devotion!"

Heritage Pavilion Master's eyes were full of approval.

"To descend to the lower realm at will, and even produce such a precious life-extending treasure... It seems Zhang Jing remains extraordinary even in the Upper Realm! Truly worthy of being one who established an immortal foundation and was personally escorted to the Upper Realm by a True Immortal for cultivation."

The Academy Head's face was alight with excitement and anticipation.

As the head of the Dao Academy, the more formidable Zhang Jing proved to be, the happier he was.

No matter what.

Longhu Dao Academy had the bond of having taught and guided Zhang Jing. If one day in the future...

The Academy Head suddenly didn't dare to continue that thought.

Before long.

The room returned to tranquility.

Zhang Jing turned around, a faint, gentle smile on his face.

He first cast an apologetic glance at the Academy Head and the various Pavilion Masters, then walked directly toward his frail, trembling father.

"Father."

Zhang Jing called softly.

Opposite him.

Looking at Zhang Jing, whose appearance hadn't changed in the slightest since their last meeting.

A trace of nostalgia flashed through Zhang father's eyes before he asked anxiously:

"Jing'er, how is your mother? Why hasn't she woken up yet?"

Seeing the worry in his father's, younger sister's, and younger brother's eyes reflected in his own.

Zhang Jing smiled and explained:

"Father, don't worry. Mother just needs some time to absorb the residual power of the Life-Returning Spirit Liquid. She'll wake up soon."

Huuu—

Hearing this.

Only then did Zhang father exhale in relief.

The next moment.

He then said cautiously:

"Jing'er, your mother hasn't been well these past few days, causing the immortal elders of the academy to go through much trouble. Don't worry about me—go attend to them first."

But at that moment.

"Haha, Brother Zhang, no need for such formalities."

The Academy Head laughed as he looked at Zhang father, speaking in a relaxed tone:

"Now that Zhang Jing has returned and your wife is out of danger, we won't intrude on your family reunion any longer."

"However—"

The Academy Head seemed to remember something as he looked directly at Zhang Jing and asked:

"Zhang Jing, some of your junior brothers and sisters have come as well. Would you give them the chance to meet you?"

Behind him.

Including Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master, all the Pavilion Masters looked up at Zhang Jing with hopeful expressions. Though they said nothing, their faces clearly conveyed their thoughts.

This was Longhu Dao Academy's first returned existence from the Upper Realm!

Who knew how the inner academy disciples outside would react upon seeing Zhang Jing?

And if Zhang Jing happened to give some pointers to his old acquaintances in his joy, that would be even better.

At this thought.

They couldn't help but glance subtly at Zhang Nianjing and Zhang Fan.

Zhang Jing's descent this time.

Would likely benefit these two siblings the most.

Meanwhile.

"Haha, Academy Head and Pavilion Masters, you flatter me. Given how much effort my junior brothers and sisters have put in this time, it's only right that I meet them."

Zhang Jing replied with a smile, his voice carrying a trace of gratitude.

Before projecting his consciousness to the lower realm this time.

He truly hadn't expected that his mother's impending lifespan limit would cause such a stir in Longhu Dao Academy.

Of course, Zhang Jing understood clearly.

All this was done for his sake.

But intentions aside, actions spoke louder.

Moreover.

He couldn't remain in the lower realm for long—his parents would still need the academy's care in the future...

In the courtyard outside.

The many academy disciples who had been chatting suddenly had their attention drawn by faint footsteps.

The next moment.

The air fell deathly silent.

Everyone simultaneously rubbed their eyes before staring dumbfounded at the youthful figure standing beside the Academy Head.

After what felt like an eternity.

"Elder... Elder Brother Zhang Jing?!"

Someone came to their senses and exclaimed involuntarily.

The cry snapped the assembled disciples out of their stupor.

Instantly.

Countless fervent gazes locked onto Zhang Jing.

"We greet Elder Brother Zhang Jing!"

They shouted in unison with utmost respect.

The loud, clear cry shot straight into the heavens, echoing repeatedly across the vast Starfall City.

"Junior brothers and sisters, please rise."

Zhang Jing's gentle voice softly reached each person's ears.

At this moment.

Within the crowd.

Ji Bochang raised his head, looking at Zhang Jing with an extremely complex gaze—one mixing surprise and joy with deep gratitude.

He knew the only reason he had reached his current status.

Was entirely due to the vast cultivation resources this former Brother Zhang had bestowed upon him.

"To think Brother Zhang actually returned from the Upper Realm. If Senior Sister knew, she'd surely regret not coming with me today."

He thought to himself.

As for going up to greet him—Ji Bochang didn't even entertain the notion.

The reason was simple.

The gap between them was far too vast.

Even if he shamelessly approached, it would only lead to awkwardness.

Absentmindedly.

Ji Bochang met Zhang Jing's faintly smiling gaze.

"Brother Zhang still remembers me!"

His heart swelled with excitement again...

Time flowed quietly by.

The many disciples, faces alight with excitement, flew straight back toward the Dao Academy.

They had originally come to pay respects for Zhang mother's passing.

But who could have imagined.

Zhang Jing, who was supposed to be in the Upper Realm, had suddenly returned, using immortal means to restore Zhang mother from the brink of death to youthful vigor.

More crucially.

Elder Brother Zhang Jing had even lectured on the Dao for them for a full two hours!

Each person's gains had far exceeded their wildest expectations!

They couldn't wait to bring this astonishing news back and see the expressions on the faces of those who hadn't come!

Back at the Zhang residence.

As they prepared to leave.

The Academy Head and Pavilion Masters looked at Zhang Jing with earnest expressions.

"Zhang Jing, You Yuanming and Nong Xingzhou have also gone to the Upper Realm to cultivate. If possible, we hope you can lend them some assistance. Especially Xingzhou—without your monstrous talent, their path in the genius-filled Upper Realm will likely be fraught with hardships."

"Understood, Academy Head and Pavilion Masters. You needn't worry."

Zhang Jing agreed with a smile...

That night.

In the Zhang family's main hall.

The lights shone as bright as day.

The aged Zhang father sat beside his wife, who now looked like a young girl, feeling utterly out of place.

Several times he tried to shift away, only for Zhang mother to grab his arm and pull him back forcefully.

Heaven knew.

In terms of strength, the current Zhang father was no match for his rejuvenated wife.

Helpless.

He could only surrender to his fate.

Opposite them.

Zhang Jing watched this scene with some amusement as another jade vial of Life-Returning Spirit Liquid appeared in his hand amidst a flash of immortal light.

"Father, return to the bedroom. I've prepared Life-Returning Spirit Liquid for you as well."

As these words fell.

The awkward Zhang father froze.

He stared wide-eyed at Zhang Jing, asking incredulously: "Jing'er, for me too?"

Zhang Jing nodded with a smile.

Hearing this.

Zhang father's breathing instantly grew heavy.

He couldn't help but glance sideways.

His wife's youthful appearance entered his vision, and a trace of longing flashed through his heart.

Yet the next moment.

As if remembering something, Zhang father began waving his hands in refusal:

"Jing'er, your father doesn't need this. I've lived a full life with no regrets! You're alone in the Upper Realm—such a precious treasure should be saved for when you truly need it."

Hearing this.

Zhang Jing fell silent.

He understood his father's concerns perfectly.

Who in this world didn't yearn for longer life? This was simply the selfless heart of a parent...

Time slipped quietly by as night deepened like ink.

In the pitch-black courtyard.

"Elder Brother."

A soft voice sounded.

Zhang Nianjing and Zhang Fan halted their steps, looking puzzled at Zhang Jing standing not far ahead with his hands behind his back.

They didn't understand.

Why their elder brother had called them here in the dead of night...

After a moment of silence.

Zhang Jing spoke softly:

"My projection is about to dissipate, so while there's still time, I have some instructions for you both. It's uncertain when I'll be able to project down again."

The moment these words were spoken.

Zhang Nianjing's eyes reddened, her face showing intense reluctance.

"Please instruct us, Elder Brother."

Zhang Fan said solemnly from the side.

"You two must take good care of father and mother. If any issues arise, seek help from the Academy Head and Pavilion Masters. But I needn't say this—you likely already know."

"Also, in your cultivation, never rush for quick progress. Focus on solidifying your foundations. When you enter the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven in the future, you can seek out the Myriad Spirits Treasure Vault's Elder Ying. Mention my name, and it will assist you with minor matters."

"As for Dao Intent—"

As he spoke.

Zhang Jing extended a hand, and two profound strands of Dao Intent slowly materialized.

Then.

Under his control, the Dao Intent flashed toward the two, eventually merging into their foreheads and leaving only faint marks.

"These are Dao Intents corresponding to your inheritances. Remember to contemplate them constantly—don't slack off. Strive to comprehend them to perfection and transform your Golden Nature Dao Foundations."

As these final words fell.

Zhang Jing's figure gradually faded from sight.

Not long after.

The rejuvenated Zhang father and mother hurried over.

"Where's your elder brother?" They asked anxiously.

"Father, mother... Elder Brother has returned to the Upper Realm."

Zhang Nianjing answered weakly.

The air turned deathly still.

Finally.

"Ah—"

A helpless sigh dissipated into the boundless night...

In the central palace of the Immortal Island Paradise.

Zhang Jing quietly opened his eyes.

"Just made it back in time! Now that matters in the lower realm are settled, it's time to prepare for the Proud Cloud Secret Realm opening in five years."

He thought to himself, a glint of anticipation flashing through his eyes.

Truthfully, there wasn't much to prepare.

In fact.

With the pseudo-Primordial Origin Spiritual Light by his side.

Whether facing the foundation-building prodigies nurtured by the other six top inheritance factions or the geniuses of the Myriad Races faction, Zhang Jing was confident he could not only fight them—

But emerge victorious.

His goals for entering the Proud Cloud Secret Realm were twofold.

First: to witness the various geniuses and prodigies for himself.

Second: to secure the top foundation-building rank within the secret realm and claim the reward of several billion destiny points.

With this massive amount of destiny, he could complete the final step of accumulation and sublimation in his foundation-building stage plans.

At this thought.

Zhang Jing suppressed his excitement and slowly closed his eyes again.

Various Dao Intents began intertwining within his heart...

Time flowed quietly onward.

On the meditation cushion.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes to find Deer Thirty-Eight's slightly mischievous gaze upon him.

"Thirty-Eight, you...?"

He asked curiously.

"Hehe, Master, it seems I'm about to break through to the Golden Core realm."

Deer Thirty-Eight grinned excitedly.

Golden Core realm?

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered.

This cultivation progress matched his expectations.

With bloodline inheritance and the assistance of immortal spirit liquid from the spiritual spring, advancing from foundation-building to golden core in thirty years wasn't particularly fast.

Mainly because this deer was too lazy in his cultivation!

Then, as if realizing something.

Zhang Jing asked:

"By the way, how long has this master been in seclusion?"

"Five years."

Deer Thirty-Eight counted on his hooves before answering respectfully.

Hearing this.

A look of eager anticipation instantly appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

Five years—the Proud Cloud Secret Realm was about to open!
