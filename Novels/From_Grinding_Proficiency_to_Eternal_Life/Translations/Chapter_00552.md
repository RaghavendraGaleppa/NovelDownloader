Chapter 552: Extinguishing a Man, Eliminating Fortune

The man's fortune was indeed profound; given time, he would have had a chance to rise to prominence.

Especially after the incident that had just occurred.

How could Xu Yunfan allow him to grow?

At this moment, the thick, bluish-gray fortune above Qi Hanfeng's head was like a vortex, frantically spinning and collapsing. The originally infinite potential and vigorous vitality of his destiny were violently disturbed, extracted, and plundered.

Although the Dongming Shitian Talisman had only been briefly practiced, Xu Yunfan had previously cultivated the Azure Dragon Thunder珠 Locking Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method and the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture's Tortoise Breath Hiding Spirit Technique—two methods for avoiding calamity and concealing one's own karma. Thus, practicing this secret technique came quite naturally to him.

With just the rudimentary application learned at the entry level, Xu Yunfan could already施展 it.

The vitality and fortune stripped away by Xu Yunfan did not dissipate into the heavens and earth. Instead, under the influence of the Dongming Shitian Talisman, they were instantly catalyzed, refined, and condensed.

They then condensed into a "Calamity Seed" radiating an ominous, deathly aura.

This "Calamity Seed" fell silently, precisely branding itself onto Qi Hanfeng's already faint and dim soul spirit.

The bluish-gray aura of fortune completely vanished, replaced by a dense, deathly aura of calamity clouds.

Fortune dispersed like smoke; calamity arrived in an instant.

The twitching finger had already returned to a natural hang, as if nothing had happened.

Xu Yunfan didn't even bother to look back, his steps still steady as he walked straight toward his own Divine Thunder Peak.

This operation, for him who had only just touched the surface of the Dongming Shitian Talisman, was not without its burden, slightly taxing his spirit, but the effect was immediate.

Meanwhile, Qi Hanfeng, collapsed on the ground, had the flames of revenge in his heart not yet extinguished, but his body first felt a sudden, piercing cold. An indescribable, rusty sense of suffocation seized him.

He shook his head, throwing aside the strange thoughts in his mind, and propped himself up with his arms, wanting to stand up, to at least leave this place that humiliated him alive.

As long as he lived...

Qi Hanfeng subconsciously touched the ring on his finger.

"ROAR!!"

A sudden, furious, and hungry roar, like a thunderclap on a clear day, echoed across the square.

Everyone was startled, including the hidden divine senses, which波动ed violently.

At the edge of the square, in a small, shaded area where disciples usually sat in meditation and which was protected by a weak formation, the space seemed to be torn apart by invisible claws.

A strange beast, covered in dark blue scales, resembling a hyena but the size of a calf, with eyes as red as blood, crashed through the fragile restriction and charged out.

"Eh? How could there be Shadow-Gnawing Hyenas within the sect?"

A disciple proficient in beast-taming techniques exclaimed in surprise.

This beast, the "Shadow-Gnawing Hyena," was not a tamed spiritual beast of the sect, but a variant of some low-grade fierce beast. It was bloodthirsty by nature and incredibly fast, requiring a disciple at the peak of the Qi Condensation realm to deal with it.

It was supposed to appear at the edge of the wild lands where outer disciples conduct their trials, yet for some reason, it had now instantly bypassed the complex sect restrictions and appeared in the core area's Scripture Pavilion Square.

Even more诡异的是, its point of breakthrough and its landing point formed a straight, shortest path, and the end of that line was precisely Qi Hanfeng, who had just struggled to his feet.

The entire process was so fast it made one's thoughts freeze.

Qi Hanfeng only felt a gust of foul wind rush at him. He didn't even get a clear look at what was charging at him before his vision was filled by a giant maw full of fangs and dripping with foul-smelling saliva.

"Rip!"

A bone-chilling sound of flesh and bone tearing.

Blood blossomed instantly.

That head, along with half of the shoulder, under the terrifying bite force of the Shadow-Gnawing Hyena, was crushed and torn apart like a fragile melon.

The headless残躯 was even sent spinning in place by the immense impact force before heavily falling to the ground. The hot blood spurting from the severed neck splashed a large,刺眼的 patch of scarlet onto the black stone slabs.

The Shadow-Gnawing Hyena, with Qi Hanfeng's head in its mouth, swept the square with its blood-red eyes, then turned without hesitation. A few leaps took it into the shadows of the forest at the square's edge, vanishing without a trace.

It left behind only the pungent smell of blood in the square, the still-twitching headless corpse, and a dead silence.

A few quicker-reacting outer disciples cried out in alarm, subconsciously stepping back.

Inner disciples maintaining order rushed over, but they only saw the beast's fleeing back and the gruesome scene on the ground. They looked at each other, unsure of what to do.

The hidden divine senses paused slightly, then悄然 withdrew, each carrying their own emotions.

Some were indifferent, some were slightly surprised, and some sneered with disdain.

In the Primordial Origin Sect, the death of a Qi Condensation disciple was a common occurrence, but for it to be so abrupt and coincidental, and to happen to a disciple who had just provoked a Foundation Establishment true person...

The thread of karma that had been拨动ed, though无形无质, its chilling寒意 was already显而昭之.

These foolish 'materials' who claim to be favored by heaven actually wanted to play the '三十年河东,三十年河西' game in the Primordial Origin Sect.

They had truly错投了胎 and寻错了地界.

From the moment he shouted those words at Xu Yunfan, his fate had been提前画上了休止符.

If it had been any other Foundation Establishment true person from the Primordial Origin Sect, their methods would have been far more cruel than Xu Yunfan's.

Xu Yunfan returned to his cave dwelling on Divine Thunder Peak. He walked straight into the meditation room, sat cross-legged, and his mind was as calm as an ancient, undisturbed well.

What had just happened was merely a small插曲 to him.

That少年 had some奇遇. Xu Yunfan was almost certain he was some hidden figure's experiment. Now that he had killed him, someone would naturally come looking for him.

Xu Yunfan wasn't afraid of this.

As long as a true person doesn't出手, who is stronger and who is weaker can only be known after a fight.

His spiritual will sank into his dantian sea of qi. The first thing to appear was the虚影 of a large, purple pill, constantly流转 and浮沉.

This was the core of his Dao Foundation, cultivated with his own life and spirit, and also the雏形 of the small world forged by the "Divine Thunder Nine Chasms Mystic穹 Indestructible True Scripture."

Beside the core of this large pill, nine fine yet substantial purple thunder chains intertwined, forming a profound and complex talisman array. Within this array, a jade-green Thunder珠, containing the意象 of a dragon swimming within, was firmly locked.

This was the Azure Dragon Thunder珠 Locking Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method.

This method is neither for attack nor defense. It is a technique for avoiding calamity bestowed by the True Lord of Pure Origin.当初 the Pure Yang Ancestor had given a cryptic hint but did not have him cultivate it, so its origins are naturally clean.

Its core is this "Mystic穹 Thunder珠" nourished and condensed by his own lifeblood thunder.

Its "Azure Dragon"意象 takes the meaning of its movements, transformations, and unpredictable rising and sinking, symbolizing this method's sensitivity to and ability to evade changes in calamity and karma.

The two words "Locking Calamity" point directly to this method's core function.

To lock one's own fortune and destiny, preventing calamities from easily afflicting one's body.

And "Suppressing Fortune" means stabilizing one's life pattern and destiny, suppressing any possible意外 twists and turns, making one as stable as a sea-calming needle.

Earlier,拨动ing Qi Hanfeng's insignificant thread of karma seemed easy, but it was actually due to operating a wisp of the subtlety of this method.配合 with the Dongming Shitian Talisman, he skillfully融合 the plundered fortune and calamity into his own Thunder River of Destiny, without causing any waves.
