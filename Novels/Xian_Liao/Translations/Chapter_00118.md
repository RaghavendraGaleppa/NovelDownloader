# Chapter 118: Mulberry Dew (Supplementary Update)

"Three-Yang Mystic Fire Fan, Vermilion Brilliance Mirror, Spirit-Piercing Arrow, and Blazing Fire Saber."

From the relics of the Elder Qingmo, Zhou Qing found four mid-grade magical artifacts and even the refining methods for two high-grade magical artifacts, along with the elder's cultivation notes.

The two high-grade magical artifact refining methods were for the "Demon-Binding Rope" and the "Qinghuang Sword."

There was even a method for crafting the Binghuo Divine Thunder Talisman.

The four cultivators—Luo Xiangu and Yu Qing—were only at the Qi Refinement stage, so the cultivation resources they could access were limited in quality.

However, they made up for it in quantity and were quite useful for innate experts in the mortal realm.

The relics left by Elder Qingmo, on the other hand, could assist Zhang Jingxiu.

Old Zhang, as a great cultivator at the Melting Furnace stage, had surprisingly never had a truly suitable weapon. Zhou Qing planned to lend him the Blazing Fire Saber for the time being to improve his productivity.

After all, Old Zhang's task of planting a demonic seed in the Great Pine Tree wouldn't be completed overnight. In the meantime, he could still go hunting.

The details of comprehending cultivation techniques still largely depended on Zhou Qing.

This also served as preparation for Zhou Qing's later plan to transplant the Great Mulberry Tree to the Water Mansion. Of course, after Old Zhang refined the Great Pine Tree, he could send it over first for experimentation.

Qi Refinement stage cultivators typically used low-grade magical artifacts. Mid-grade artifacts required at least late-stage Qi Refinement cultivation to activate—such as Luo Xiangu's Peach Blossom Barrier.

She had recently broken through to the late Qi Refinement stage, specifically the seventh layer.

Yu Qing was also at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement but was close to reaching the eighth layer.

However, during beast tides, quantity was more important for Qi Refinement stage cultivators. Different types of cultivators could coordinate better in battle.

Moreover, ordinary low-level demonic beasts had obvious weaknesses that, once identified, could be easily exploited.

After taking stock, Zhou Qing began reviewing Elder Qingmo's cultivation notes.

"By chance, I killed a demon-seeding cultivator and obtained his cultivation technique. I don't know if this is a blessing or a curse..."

"Another beast tide has come, and my fellow cultivators are falling one by one. I'm in despair..."

"Another failed attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage. It's time to make a decision..."

"At first, becoming a demon-seeding cultivator didn't feel too bad. Perhaps it's because this Qingmo Vine is still young and doesn't affect me much..."

"As I devoured more and more demonic beasts, my vitality grew stronger. I knew I was getting closer to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage..."

"The Qingmo Vine is growing too fast. I fear I won't be able to control it in the future..."

"I've successfully reached the Foundation Establishment stage. Now I no longer have to hide cautiously in the city, afraid of being recognized as a demon-seeding cultivator. I can venture into the wilderness alone to establish my own cave abode..."

---

"The more demonic beasts I devour, the stronger the demonic nature within me becomes. Because of this, I no longer dare to use the Qingmo Vine to consume living beings..."

"I couldn't resist—I ate a rogue cultivator. He was committing evil deeds, so I was dispensing justice. But... I ate a person..."

"I'm losing control of myself more and more..."

"I can no longer cultivate in peace. If I don't devour demonic beasts or other cultivators, I can't make progress. Moreover, the Qingmo Vine keeps draining my vitality and true essence—it's like a bottomless pit..."

"I tried to expel it from my body, but it was futile..."

"Demon-seeding opens a floodgate of desires. I thought I could control myself, but in reality, I can't control anything..."

"I was such a fool. If I could suppress my demonic nature, I could have reached the Foundation Establishment stage on my own, even without a Foundation Establishment Pill. Compared to conquering my demonic nature, self-attained Foundation Establishment might have been easier..."

"I'm beginning to regret it, beginning to go mad..."

"My moments of clarity are fleeting..."

"I don't know what I'm doing... I've started refining puppets..."

"Those cultivators' corpses on the battlefield—if I don't refine them into puppets, it would be a waste..."

"I refined a recently deceased body cultivator into a puppet. With the many puppets controlled by the Qingmo Vine, I've become terrifying to others now..."

"A demonic sect tried to recruit me, but I refused..."

"I've started preparing for my own demise because I don't want to become an uncontrollable calamity after death..."

"The key to demon-seeding lies in the Dao Heart. It's a pity I realized this too late. If I had reached the Foundation Establishment stage first and then seeded the demon, the situation might have been better—at least the time until complete demonization could have been prolonged..."

Elder Qingmo's cultivation notes were interspersed with these daily reflections.

Zhou Qing gradually came to understand his life.

A "True Demon" was a demonic entity that harmonized closely with one's own aura. The method of demon-seeding, even within demonic sects, followed similar principles, differing little from the "Demon-Seeding Life-Giving Great Method."

However, Elder Qingmo mentioned a crucial point: the Dao Heart.

Naturally, the elder left behind detailed cultivation insights. Whether intentional or not, these notes provided Zhou Qing with significant enlightenment.

---

"Dao Heart Demon-Seeding?"

Zhang Jingxiu carefully pondered the meaning of these four words.

Zhou Qing nodded. "I believe this is the true secret of the Demon-Seeding Life-Giving Great Method. The Great Dao is simple—methods and details are secondary, while the Dao Heart is the most critical. I can roughly guess how the four demonic sect leaders achieved their Golden Core formation."

He didn't strongly advise Zhang Jingxiu to rush into demon-seeding, but given Old Zhang's age, he undoubtedly had his own convictions.

Each cultivator walked their own path—the only difference lay in the outcome.

Success justified everything; failure, however...

"I think I understand. I'll attempt it when I feel ready," Zhang Jingxiu said calmly.

Zhou Qing handed him the Blazing Fire Saber. "Although this is a magical artifact, a body cultivator's true energy can still wield it. Give it a try."

Zhang Jingxiu took the saber, feeling its substantial weight. As he channeled his true energy into it, a blade aura several zhang long materialized. If he poured in his full strength, he could unleash a slash spanning dozens of zhang.

"An excellent blade!" Zhang Jingxiu's face lit up with rare delight.

The Blazing Fire Saber had originally belonged to the body cultivator puppet refined by Elder Qingmo.

Even that body cultivator's strength hadn't been enough to unleash the saber's full potential.

With the Blazing Fire Saber, Zhang Jingxiu could venture into deeper and more distant waters to battle stronger demonic beasts. Through combat, his martial will and spiritual cultivation would continue to grow.

However, life-and-death battles inevitably brought injuries. After demon-seeding, his vitality would strengthen, accelerating his recovery and making such battles more sustainable.

This was another reason Zhang Jingxiu intended to seed a demon.

Moreover, with the precedent of the four demonic sect leaders' success, Zhang Jingxiu was willing to take the gamble. Despite Zhou Qing's praise of him as a "late bloomer," he knew his current state offered no hope of surpassing the Melting Furnace stage to rival Golden Core patriarchs.

The older he grew, the more determined and fearless he became.

Cultivation was about seeking truth—not only manifesting the illusory into reality but also dispelling delusions to uncover one's true nature.

While cultivation resources were important, recognizing one's true nature and grasping one's Dao nature were equally vital.

Jiangzhou, Herb Garden.

Zhou Qing handed the Spirit-Piercing Arrow to Yuan Mingyue, instructing her to analyze its embedded formations and develop a simplified version. Ideally, innate experts could mass-produce them in the future.

Yuan Mingyue accepted the arrow and mentioned another matter to her master.

"Master, this is the Mulberry Dew produced by the Great Mulberry Tree. It drips to the ground but doesn't disperse or gather dust. I believe it's a type of spiritual dew, so I collected it."

Zhou Qing opened the jade vial and immediately sensed a surge of pure, potent vitality.

Inside were three droplets of Mulberry Dew, each remaining distinct.

He extracted one droplet and sampled it. Instantly, a vast yet gentle vitality flooded his body, even slightly benefiting his Liver-Wood Thunder cultivation.

Previously, he had tried using the Great Mulberry Tree's yin energy to cultivate Liver-Wood Thunder, but it hadn't worked.

Unexpectedly, after some time, the tree had produced Mulberry Dew, which now aided his cultivation.

This sparked a new idea in Zhou Qing.

His progress in the "All-Seeing Eye" technique had been sluggish. The technique involved absorbing vitality into the eyes, gradually transforming them into spiritual eyes.

After conducting tests to ensure safety, Zhou Qing confirmed that Mulberry Dew had remarkable effects on the eyes.

Moreover, when he nourished the Great Mulberry Tree with demonic beast flesh, it actively produced Mulberry Dew—though the yield remained relatively scarce.

"It seems the Great Mulberry Tree intends to trade Mulberry Dew for demonic beast flesh."

"Quite the shrewd bargain!"

But the Mulberry Dew was undeniably valuable.

Additionally, Zhou Qing could clearly sense the tree's emotions, so he wasn't worried about losing control. He simply needed to return more frequently to prevent mishaps.

Did this mean he had to visit more often?

For now, Zhou Qing lacked a method to transmit messages through the teleportation array, so regular visits were necessary. At least he wasn't short on spirit stones to activate the array.

Using the Mulberry Dew, his progress in the All-Seeing Eye technique accelerated significantly.

The dew also had beautifying effects.

Zhou Qing had previously wanted to refine Beauty-Preserving Pills but lacked key ingredients. Surprisingly, the Great Mulberry Tree's dew served the purpose. Though he had no use for it himself, he shared two droplets with Lin Wan'er.

The vitality from the Great Mulberry Tree could be substituted with many elixirs for physical cultivators, and its low yield made it impractical for widespread use.

Zhou Qing primarily used it for himself. He also simplified the All-Seeing Eye technique and taught it to Yuan Mingyue, greatly enhancing her vision and perception of formation patterns.

This allowed her to decipher the inscribed formations on magical artifacts with greater ease.

A month later, Zhou Qing checked his "Longevity Scroll":

**All-Seeing Eye (Second Layer).**

His progress had roughly tripled. However, upon reaching the second layer, the pace slowed considerably.

Still, Zhou Qing was satisfied with his rapid advancement.

With persistent cultivation, the All-Seeing Eye's effects would continue to improve. Even without activating the technique, his natural eyesight had significantly enhanced.

At times, he could vaguely perceive beneath surfaces with his naked eye—though it required intense focus.

In other words, even without magic, his eyes now possessed some extraordinary capabilities.

He tested this extensively upon discovering it.

The more he concentrated, the stronger the透视 (penetrative vision) effect became.

"Perhaps the ultimate form of the All-Seeing Eye is to transform the eyes into genuine spiritual eyes, not just illusory magical ones," Zhou Qing mused.

However, the Mulberry Dew's effects gradually diminished. Despite its low yield, the Great Mulberry Tree could produce it continuously, ensuring long-term benefits.

Zhou Qing allocated about one-tenth of the dew to Yuan Mingyue. The better her eyesight, the more it aided her formation studies.

Yuan Mingyue had already mastered the fundamentals of formations and was progressing toward becoming a true formation master.

Her talent in this field seemed innate, as if she possessed past-life wisdom.

In contrast, her cultivation aptitude was mediocre.

Yet, the pure yin energy within her grew increasingly concentrated, resembling liquefied jade marrow. Fortunately, it didn't adversely affect her, as Zhou Qing provided her with yang-harmonizing elixirs and had prepared Heart-Nourishing Pills—refined from Old Zhang's blood—as a contingency.

At Qingfu Palace's square, Zhou Qing pinned Fushan down with one hand and rolled his eyes.

"Second Senior Brother, haven't you been living too comfortably? You've made zero progress since reaching the third layer of body refinement." Fushan's cultivation had surpassed that of Fushan, who focused on alchemy.

Although Fushan divided his attention between alchemy and cultivation, he also practiced the Pure Yang Heart Technique, refining his energy to greater purity.

He would have no trouble reaching the Melting Furnace stage in the future.

Fushan, on the other hand, wasn't distracted by alchemy, had the Mountain Trigram left by Patriarch Jingyang, and even cultivated Zhou Qing's "Bear Roar Golden Bell Scripture." Yet his progress was frustratingly slow.

Even Xiao Ruowang was nearing the third layer of body refinement with the aid of elixirs.

It irritated Zhou Qing to no end.

Fushan intervened, "Junior Brother, don't blame him. Fushan has been busy instructing disciples daily—it's no easy task."

He added, "I'll take on more teaching duties to free him up for his Melting Furnace breakthrough."

Zhou Qing relented. "First Senior Brother, I spoke too harshly. But Second Senior Brother should still aim for the Melting Furnace stage soon. In a while, Brother Zhang will return for demon-seeding, and someone needs to handle the demonic beast hunts."

Fushan nodded. "I've gained insights from your 'Crane Cry Across the Skies Scripture.' I'll reduce my alchemy studies temporarily to attempt a breakthrough together."

With Zhou Qing's Five Animal Techniques, Patriarch Jingyang's Eight Trigrams, ample resources, and Zhang Jingxiu's experience, Fushan and Fushan had high chances of success. Even if they failed initially, repeated attempts would eventually succeed.

Moreover, they now had Foundation Establishment-level demonic beast blood.

The blood of the Yaksha Eagle, used to assist in Melting Furnace breakthroughs, was far more effective than the White Ape's blood from before.

Yet, an unexpected setback occurred.

Fushan failed his breakthrough!

Zhou Qing remained unperturbed—failure was just another lesson.

Around this time, Tang Jieyuan approached him.

"Vajra Elixir?" Zhou Qing was surprised. Tang Jieyuan and other Confucian scholars had deciphered an ancient recipe inscribed on a mysterious bronze cauldron.

Though the cauldron was damaged, its cryptic script had captivated the scholars, who painstakingly decoded its contents.

The Vajra Elixir recipe was part of their findings.

"This elixir can assist body cultivators in breaking through to the Melting Furnace stage!" Zhou Qing concluded after reviewing it.

It might even benefit him.
