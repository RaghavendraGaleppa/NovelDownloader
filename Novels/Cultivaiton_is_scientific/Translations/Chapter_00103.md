# Chapter 103: Intermediate Level  

Li Shiming placed the five newly crafted array flags into the spirit-gathering formation beside the lower-grade spirit vein. These flags required substantial spiritual energy to nurture.  

He then took out the Spirit Tortoise Shield, which he had yet to refine since acquiring it. Previously, he had felt no sense of urgency, but now he urgently needed to enhance his strength as quickly as possible.  

As he activated the *Dragon-Painting Dotting Technique*, intricate patterns emerged on the Spirit Tortoise Shield. These included the original mid-grade magical artifact patterns and the array patterns he had developed with Yin Shilan.  

After inheriting knowledge of formations, he was no longer a complete novice when it came to these patterns.  

Four glowing points appeared on the Spirit Tortoise Shield, indicating that its quality surpassed that of a high-grade magical artifact.  

Of course, while the Spirit Tortoise Shield exceeded the standard of high-grade artifacts, its limitations significantly diminished its practical value. Only in Li Shiming’s hands could it achieve its full potential.  

In terms of worth, the handheld mobile formation on the Spirit Tortoise Shield might hold the greatest value for formation masters.  

Unlike before, Li Shiming no longer randomly selected the order of the four glowing points for refinement. While that method still worked, it was far less efficient.  

He ranked the four points from lowest to highest and refined them one by one using the *Dotting* technique. Soon, the Spirit Tortoise Shield established a connection with him.  

At this point, the shield was usable, but to wield it with full flexibility, complete refinement was still necessary.  

He noticed that his current cultivation at the fourth level of Qi Refining allowed him to refine the shield much faster than during his early Qi Refining stage.  

Estimating, he calculated that fully refining the Spirit Tortoise Shield would take about two months—a significant improvement compared to the nearly year-long process he had endured when refining the high-grade artifact, the Green Kite Wooden Sword.  

Exiting his cave dwelling, Li Shiming arrived at the spirit field and cast *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique*. This time, he clearly felt the spell’s range expand to over 300 square meters.  

Now, a single *mu* of spirit field could be covered with just two applications of the technique—a major breakthrough.  

Previously, despite his relentless practice of spirit farming spells, progress had slowed to a crawl after reaching a certain level.  

Now, he finally understood: his cultivation level had been the limiting factor.  

*Spring Breeze and Rain Technique* relied on spiritual energy, and the quality of his internal energy had constrained the spell’s effectiveness.  

He then cast *Spirit Soil Technique* and *Metallic Essence Technique*. With the assistance of IBMz15, he had already mastered these spells to the limit of his early Qi Refining stage.  

Now, their power had also seen significant improvements.  

*It seems I can apply for the intermediate spirit farmer assessment now. This is also a good opportunity to gather information in the sect—see what impact that missing cultivator’s disappearance has caused.*  

With this thought, Li Shiming summoned his paper crane and rode it toward the Nine Peaks of the sect.  

About an hour later, the familiar peaks came into view.  

This time, armed with his formation inheritance, the Nine Peaks appeared entirely different to him.  

Before him lay an unimaginably vast formation, with threads of spiritual energy weaving a protective web around the entire mountain range.  

Within these threads, nine formation nodes—perceptible only to formation masters—channeled terrifying amounts of spiritual energy into the grand formation. The energy threads alone were nearly a meter in diameter.  

Though the sect’s protective formation was incredibly complex, it was fundamentally based on the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, with additional formations built around this framework.  

Of course, what Li Shiming saw was merely the tip of the iceberg. The formation was currently in a semi-dormant state. Fully activated, its consumption would be staggering, but its power would also be far more formidable.  

This was the heritage of a major sect—without an extremely high-grade spirit vein, such a formation would be impossible to sustain.  

With his identity jade slip, he easily passed through the formation and entered.  

The Thunder Rain Pavilion on Xun Peak was one of the few buildings open to outsiders. His identity as a low-level spirit farmer granted him access without needing to be a disciple of Xun Peak.  

As Li Shiming landed before the pavilion, he sensed the vitality in the air—this time with far greater clarity.  

Unlike his first visit, when he had been awestruck, he now recognized the gap between his *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique* and the vitality here. The missing piece was an intermediate-level spirit farming spell.  

Confidently, he entered the pavilion, where the elderly Elder Cheng was still present.  

"You’re that disciple who showed great aptitude for *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique*—what was your name again?" Elder Cheng nodded thoughtfully upon seeing him.  

"Elder Cheng, I’m Li Shiming." Li Shiming was surprised the elder still remembered him after so long and quickly responded.  

"My memory isn’t that bad—I remember your name!" Elder Cheng waved dismissively, clearly displeased at the implication of forgetfulness. "Are you here to join Xun Peak? If you want to make progress as a spirit farmer, joining us is the way to go."  

"Actually, Elder Cheng, I’m here to apply for the intermediate spirit farmer assessment," Li Shiming replied sheepishly.  

Elder Cheng paused, then released a wave of energy that swept over Li Shiming’s body.  

"You’ve only recently reached the fourth level of Qi Refining. Don’t aim too high. While intermediate spirit farming does require mid-stage Qi Refining, you still need to put in more effort to qualify," Elder Cheng advised, shaking his head.  

Li Shiming remained silent, bowing slightly in response.  

"Fine, if you insist on testing yourself, go ahead and demonstrate *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique*," Elder Cheng relented with a resigned wave.  

In his eyes, Li Shiming was like those impatient disciples who rushed to take assessments after minor achievements.  

As the sect’s gatekeeper, he couldn’t just let anyone pass. A low-level spirit farmer who hadn’t reached a certain standard would never master intermediate spells—and if they failed, it would reflect poorly on him as the examiner.  

Li Shiming traced a spell pattern in the air—one he had repeated countless times. In less than a breath, the pattern was complete.  

Elder Cheng straightened in his seat, his eyes flashing with approval. The speed of casting alone demonstrated Li Shiming’s mastery of *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique*—a skill that couldn’t be faked and required relentless practice.  

Of course, innate talent played a crucial role. A gifted spirit farmer could achieve in one attempt what a less talented one might take ten tries to accomplish.  

A dark cloud spanning over 300 square meters nearly covered the entire hall’s ceiling. Elder Cheng flicked his hand, and the cloud dissipated instantly.

With a smile, Li Shiming left Xun Peak, his identity jade slip now bearing the mark of an intermediate spirit farmer.  

As a reward for passing, Xun Peak granted him free access to the foundational intermediate spell for spirit farmers—*Spring Breeze Moistens All Things*.  

Other intermediate spells still required merit points, but this was already a generous boon. Given his limited merit points, Li Shiming wasn’t sure he could have afforded even one advanced spell otherwise.  

In high spirits, he flew toward the central peak’s Scripture Pavilion. As he approached, he couldn’t help but wonder when he’d be able to freely browse its collection.  

Holding onto this unrealistic fantasy, he entered and immediately spotted a familiar face—Senior Brother Liu.  

"Identity jade slip. What scripture do you need?" Senior Brother Liu’s indifferent voice rang out.  

"Senior Brother Liu, it’s been a while!" Li Shiming greeted warmly.  

"Who are you? Don’t try to cozy up. Hand over your jade slip if you want a scripture, or leave," Senior Brother Liu replied without even lifting his eyelids.  

Li Shiming’s smile froze. Resigned, he took out five spirit stones from his storage bag and extended his hand.  

Senior Brother Liu casually moved his hand, and the stones vanished.  

"Ah, if it isn’t Junior Brother Li! No wonder your voice sounded familiar!" Senior Brother Liu’s demeanor instantly shifted as he smiled at Li Shiming.  

"I’ll trouble you again, Senior Brother. Here’s my jade slip—I’m here to collect *Spring Breeze Moistens All Things*," Li Shiming said, handing over the slip.  

A few spirit stones bought better service, and Senior Brother Liu was the type to deliver.  

During his last visit, the senior brother had provided invaluable advice, making the stones well worth it.  

"Junior Brother Li, you’re making a habit of freeloading. Does the sect mean nothing to you? You’ve been getting all your spells and techniques for free!" Senior Brother Liu grumbled even as he swiftly copied the spell onto a new jade slip.  

"Senior Brother, I’m still new—where would I get merit points?" Li Shiming chuckled.  

"When you passed the low-level spirit farmer test, you could’ve gotten *Metallic Essence Technique* and *Spirit Soil Technique* for free. Want to claim those now?" Senior Brother Liu, feeling the spirit stones warranted extra service, made the offer.  

"No need—I’ve already learned both," Li Shiming replied, surprised to learn this was an option.  

Most aspiring spirit farmers in the sect didn’t bother with *Metallic Essence Technique* or *Spirit Soil Technique* initially. They first purchased *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique*, and only after mastering it—proving their aptitude—would they consider the others.  

Of course, not all who learned *Spring Breeze and Rain Technique* could master the other two.  

Even with the sect’s refined versions, which contained mature insights to ease learning, many struggled.  

Such spirit farmers would forever remain low-level, needing to collaborate with others who had mastered the complementary spells to tend to spirit fields.  

A thought struck Li Shiming—if he passed the primary formation master assessment, would he also receive free knowledge?  

"Senior Brother Liu, where is the primary formation master assessment held? And are there free resources if I pass?" he asked, figuring he might as well get his money’s worth.  

Senior Brother Liu proved to be a veritable encyclopedia.  

"You’ve studied formations too? The primary formation master assessment is at the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion on Dui Peak. Passing it lets you craft formations for the sect—the pay is astronomical, and you’ll earn merit points fast enough to exchange for more advanced knowledge."  

"If you can become a formation master, why bother with intermediate spirit farming?" Senior Brother Liu clearly doubted Li Shiming’s aptitude but answered professionally nonetheless.  

*No wonder Yin Shilan is so wealthy—formation masters are the real money-makers!* Li Shiming’s eyes lit up.  

*Apologies, Elder Cheng, but this disciple may have to abandon the path of spirit farming for the greater calling of formation mastery!*  

Still, he’d take the free spell. Even if he didn’t pursue spirit farming professionally, growing his own resources would benefit from intermediate-level techniques.  

"*Spring Breeze Moistens All Things*—the jade’s contents last one month. Don’t leave the sect during that time," Senior Brother Liu recited mechanically as he handed over the slip.  

"Though the sect’s waters count as part of the territory. This spell is universal—our sect’s version just has some unique insights," he added in a whisper.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Li Shiming accepted the jade slip.  

---  

After leaving the Scripture Pavilion, he immediately headed for Dui Peak.  

While on the paper crane, he used his jade slip to apply for the assessment at the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion.  

By the time he reached Dui Peak, he had received approval.  

Assessments for auxiliary professions were rarely crowded, and formation masters were the rarest of all, so walk-ins were accepted.  

His application was merely for entry permission. As his crane approached, the peak’s formation granted him access.  

Beyond the sect’s grand formation, each of the Nine Peaks had its own, which combined to form the larger defense. The more Li Shiming observed, the more he marveled at the complexity.  

He stopped analyzing—the formation was becoming too intricate for IBMz15 to compute without maxing out its processing power, which would require all nine ghost servants to drive the perpetual generators.  

While IBMz15 could handle the calculations, Li Shiming’s own mind struggled to keep up, even with only auxiliary input.  

At his current level, studying the sect’s grand formation was still beyond him.  

Of course, no other formation master would attempt to analyze a formation purely by observing its energy fluctuations and brute-force computation—such a method would drive any sane person mad.
