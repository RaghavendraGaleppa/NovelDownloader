# Chapter 385: The Emergence of Divine Martial

Dragon scales peeled away in the raging flames, and flesh sizzled. The flooddragon let out a piercing wail, thrashing its body wildly but unable to break free.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was cold and heavy. The true qi required to fuel such a primordial true fire was astonishing, enough to make even him feel a bit anxious. In just a few breaths, it had consumed a full percent of the true qi within his body. The battle against Chen Jiuchuan and the others had been trivial in comparison.

He continuously channeled true fire from his palm while using his Martial Dao Heaven's Eye to lock onto the remaining purple-black demonic qi within the flooddragon, ensuring it was completely incinerated.

Gradually, the flooddragon's struggles weakened. Its hundred-zhang-long dragon body shrank under the refinement of the true fire, eventually condensing into a fist-sized, crimson blood pearl that floated within the flames.

Xu Yunfan flicked his fingers, and impurities on the surface of the blood pearl flaked away. The essence within continuously solidified, finally forming a dark red pill the size of a dragon's eye. Faint patterns of a flooddragon adorned its surface, and it radiated a mighty aura of vital blood energy!

Xu Yunfan reached out and grabbed the pill. Immediately, he felt a fierce dragon's might impact his mind.

His expression remained unchanged. The Ten Extremes True Qi, gathered at his forehead with the Spirit-Condensing Incantation, pressed down with his spiritual will, and the pill instantly fell silent.

Xu Yunfan clenched his five fingers, feeling the immense vitality within the dark red pill in his palm.

This vital blood energy was vast as an abyss, far surpassing even his own land-immortal physique, which he had tempered to its peak!

If what Chen Jiuchuan said was true and this pill was truly the legendary Martial Dao Profound Crystal, then the immense vitality it contained, according to the *Great Art of Swallowing the Myriad Desires*, the *Sutra of Suppressing Demons with a Hundred Mountains*, and the *Sutra of the Heart of Annihilation and Micro-Dust*, would be sufficient to support the Foundation Establishment path as a catalyst!

The difficulty of Foundation Establishment is like climbing a mountain against the heavens. Even if an ordinary cultivator were to endure for a hundred years, they might not increase their chances by half a percent.

This Martial Dao Profound Crystal could not only forge a separate path but also forcibly increase the probability of successful Foundation Establishment by a full ten percent!

A ten percent chance may seem minuscule, but in reality, it is already a stroke of fortune stolen from the heavens. Forging a foundation for the Great Dao is inherently an act of defying fate. The greater the chance, the more hope there is for transcendence.

According to the true scripture of the *Sutra of the Heart of Annihilation and Micro-Dust*, such an opportunity is worthy of being called a "gift from the heavens."

"So this is the Martial Dao Profound Crystal?"

Just as he was carefully examining it, a strange, hoarse voice suddenly came from behind him.

"This is the Martial Dao Profound Crystal. It belongs to the Divine Martial grade, forging the position of a battle-sage, and establishing the opportunity for the Great Dao."

The voice, though coming from Chen Jiuchuan's mouth, carried an ancient, vicissitudinous tone, as if crossing a thousand years of time.

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled. He spun around sharply to see Chen Jiuchuan with hollow eyes, yet the corners of his mouth hooked into a bizarre smile. The aura around his body had changed drastically, faintly exuding a pressure that did not belong to him!

"Who are you?" Xu Yunfan demanded coldly, the Ten Extremes True Qi circulating silently. A赤 golden aura flared around him, and he was on extreme guard.

"Chen Jiuchuan" did not answer. Instead, he looked Xu Yunfan up and down, his brows furrowing tighter and tighter. Finally, he let out a contemptuous snort.

"Mediocre bones, clogged meridians, an unopened dantian. Your blood and flesh physique is trained quite well, having reached perfection, but with such poor innate talent, everything you've done is to alter your innate bones... With such qualifications, you were actually able to break the shackles of the Ninth Realm and step into the land of immortals? How interesting."

His tone was filled with undisguised disdain, as if inspecting a piece of scrap iron.

He sighed. "The Divine Martial Realm is truly out of talent. After all this planning, the heavens of this realm have only produced a waste like you. How am I supposed to return to Foundation Establishment?"

"However..." He rubbed his chin, his tone softening slightly. "Your body is translucent like jade, your Martial Dao foundation is flawless, and your true qi is vast as an ocean... Reluctantly, you can be considered a usable seedling. If I add a few more medicinal herbs, I should be able to give myself a fifty percent chance of Foundation Establishment. With the Martial Dao Profound Crystal, a sixty percent success rate isn't bad at all."

Xu Yunfan's gaze sank, but he had already made a guess. He said in a deep voice, "Divine Martial True Lord?"

"Chen Jiuchuan" fell silent for a moment, then let out a low laugh, his laughter tinged with desolation and self-mockery.

"Correct, it is I."

He slowly raised his head, purple light flickering in his eyes. The aura around his body grew increasingly solid. In just a few breaths, his aura continuously climbed, faintly showing signs of breaking free from Xu Yunfan's suppression of the Ten Extremes True Qi.

"Three thousand years... I have cycled through this Divine Martial Realm several times, laying out countless backhands, finally waiting for a martial artist to successfully advance to the land of immortals. It was not in vain that I went to such great lengths."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan immediately understood.

This Martial Dao Profound Crystal, or rather, this dying flooddragon, was fundamentally bait set by the Divine Martial True Lord!

That evil flooddragon, this shattered small world, and even the "manual" Chen Jiuchuan obtained were likely all part of his elaborate scheme, designed to lure in powerful experts to aid in his rebirth!

"Fishing?" Xu Yunfan sneered. "With just this wisp of a remnant soul, you think you're worthy?"

With the Divine Martial True Lord possessing Chen Jiuchuan's body, the spirit and body were incompatible. Moreover, Chen Jiuchuan's strength was only at the sixth level of Qi Refining. Xu Yunfan didn't even need to employ exquisite martial techniques; he could simply press down with a palm, relying on his mighty Ten Extremes True Qi to crush him into meat paste.

The Divine Martial True Lord was not offended. Instead, he looked at Xu Yunfan with great interest and said slowly, "Young man, do not be arrogant. I once used a Martial Dao Profound Crystal to establish my foundation, sweeping across the Six Directions. Even among the Foundation Establishment True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect, I was unique. Though I now have only a wisp of a remnant consciousness, killing you... is more than enough."

Before his words had faded, he suddenly raised his hand. The shattered secret realm's world twisted violently. Countless purple-black demonic qi converged from all directions, transforming into black snakes that entangled towards Xu Yunfan!

Xu Yunfan was already on guard. The Ten Extremes True Qi erupted violently, and a赤 golden flame swept around him, incinerating all the black snakes that attacked.

He reversed his grip, and the Mountain-Shaking Sea-Calming Hammer appeared out of thin air. Its hammer tip pointed directly at the Divine Martial True Lord.

"Old thing, the times have changed!"

"This trick of yours might fool others, but it won't fool me!"

Surprise flashed in the Divine Martial True Lord's eyes, followed by a light laugh.

"Interesting... Then let me see just how much weight this junior of mine carries! Know that all the martial arts of this world originated from me."

The Divine Martial True Lord clapped his palms together. The spiritual qi of the shattered secret realm's world, like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, converged in his palm, condensing into a purple-black "Seal of Heavenly Evil Annihilating the Spirit."

The moment the seal formed, the entire space let out a groan as if unable to bear the burden. Stones within a hundred zhang radius defied gravity to float into the air, only to be pulverized into dust under the terrifying pressure.

"Break!"

The Divine Martial True Lord gave a light shout and pushed the seal forward.

The seemingly slow movement caused thirty-three spiritual qi cyclones to form out of thin air. Within each cyclone, purple-black lightning flashed, capable of tearing the earth apart.

Using martial arts to invoke the laws of the heavens, every move and stance possessed a majestic, heaven-like might!

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted violently, and a storm of shock surged in his heart. He never expected the opponent to possess such a terrifying method.

The starting stance was clearly a martial arts foundation, yet the execution of the technique completely transcended the shackles of martial arts.
