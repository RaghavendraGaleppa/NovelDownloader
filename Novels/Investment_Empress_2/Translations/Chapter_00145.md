# Chapter 145: The Autumn Water Pavilion Hot Spring is Complete!

Autumn Water Pavilion wasn't small, but its architectural style was quite compact.

With rockeries and a stream running through it, there was hardly any open space to be found.

Li Mo pondered for a moment, then suddenly had a flash of inspiration.

"If I hollow out the rockery, that should be just right."

"That would provide some cover. That way, Master and Ice Cube can also soak in it."

"I'm such a genius."

Little Li complimented himself in his heart.

He decided to act immediately.

He took out the Chixiao Sword and the Starlight Pestle and began digging with both tools. The excavated stones were directly thrown into the World Seed to be disposed of later.

The efficiency was top-notch.

*Clang, clang, clang...*

*Rustle, rustle, rustle...*

"Hm?"

"Are you tearing the house down, kid?"

Watching Li Mo's busy figure from the side, Shang Wu narrowed her almond-shaped eyes and muttered.

Ying Bing was staring at the teacup in front of her.

Due to the commotion nearby, the tea water rippled, causing the reflection of her phoenix eyes within it to waver as well.

Shang Wu, her beauty sleep disturbed, walked over to Li Mo with her hands on her hips.

"What are you doing? Do you find the rockery an eyesore?"

"Just tell me next time, I can punch it..."

"Wait!"

Li Mo quickly stopped her.

"I want to hollow out the middle of the rockery to build a hot spring."

"That way, we can soak in it later."

"Hot spring?"

Shang Wu tilted her head.

"Yeah, Master, think about it. Soaking in the bath while drinking a little wine—what a delightful thing that would be."

Li Mo smiled.

If Ice Cube and Master also soak in the hot spring, that would add another long-term, fixed source of investment feedback.

Now *that's* what you call a genius investor.

Shang Wu thought about it and seemed to see herself soaking in the hot spring, drinking a little wine.

*How wonderful.*

She beamed and patted Li Mo's shoulder.

"Hmph,看来 you haven't followed me for nothing. You even came up with such a way to enjoy yourself."

"How much of the rockery do you plan to dig out?"

She flexed her pink fist, suddenly full of motivation.

Li Mo calculated the area of the Misty Flower Unaging Spring and said:

"Make an opening big enough for two people to enter."

"Then hollow out the entire middle of the rockery. Roughly a ten-zhang radius should do."

"Simple."

The words had barely left her mouth when a light pink fist struck the rockery, making it shudder violently.

*Rumble—*

The force penetrated the rock, and a hole large enough for two people to enter simultaneously collapsed.

Li Mo's heart skipped a beat.

After clearing away the broken stones, he found that the dimensions inside the cave were exactly as he had described.

"Incredible, Master."

"It's just a bit of force control. It's no different from hitting a person. Nothing difficult."

Shang Wu calmly raised her chin.

Li Mo nodded.

He could strike a person once, shattering their bones and organs, leaving them internally scorched but externally unharmed.

But shattering the middle of a mountain was something he couldn't do yet.

"Call me when you're done."

Shang Wu yawned and went back to sleep for her beauty rest.

...

More than two hours later.

The 'Hot Spring Rockery' at Autumn Water Pavilion was nearly complete.

After cleaning up the rubble, Li Mo also dug out a pool about ten meters long and wide.

As a bonus, he used the Chixiao Sword to carve some patterns on the inner walls of the rockery, making it pleasing to the eye. He also embedded night pearls on the ceiling for lighting.

He used the excess stone to make a few stone stools and a stone table, placing them inside the pool.

"Extract the Misty Flower Unaging Spring."

Li Mo silently commanded in his mind.

Instantly, a spring eye appeared in the middle of the excavated pool.

The spring water, shrouded in a hazy mist, began to bubble up.

If a person stood inside, the water would reach their lower abdomen. If they sat down, everything below their head would be submerged.

*Swish—*

Li Mo reached in and splashed the water a couple of times. The temperature was just right.

"Tsk, tsk, perfect."

After a hard afternoon's work, Master Li revealed a satisfied smile.

"All done?"

Two sets of footsteps sounded from behind.

He turned around and saw that both Shang Wu and Ying Bing had come. They were examining the pool of spring water. The former looked eager, while the latter frowned slightly with her lips pressed together.

"We can soak in the hot spring tonight."

"This hot spring is no ordinary one; it's a type of spiritual spring."

---

"It can not only beautify the skin and remove toxins, but it's also suitable for sensitive skin."

"Folks, are you tempted? Place your order now, and we have a free gift to give!"

Little Li's performative personality kicked in, and he gave a vivid explanation.

"Wow, there's a free gift?"

Shang Wu was in an excellent mood and played along perfectly.

"Exactly!"

Li Mo looked mysterious and took three sets of clothes out of his System Space.

All were hand-sewn by his mother and the maids of the house.

That's right!

Considering there was only one hot spring, it was inevitable that everyone might have to soak at the same time.

He had gone home and told his mother to quickly make a few bathrobes, using the finest materials.

"Wear the bathrobes, and we can all soak in the hot spring together!"

"Nice, nice. Very thoughtful. You truly are my precious disciple."

Shang Wu held the clothes, wishing she could try them out right away.

She took one for herself and handed another to Ying Bing.

Ying Bing stared fixedly at the hot spring and the bathrobe.

The mist was warm.

A flicker of something unusual appeared in the depths of her eyes...

"I won't be soaking."

"Huh?"

Li Mo was confused.

Shang Wu was also puzzled.

"It's so comfortable, why not?"

"I'm not used to it."

Ying Bing shook her head and turned to walk away.

"Well... okay. If you change your mind, you can come soak by yourself."

Li Mo shrugged.

If Ice Cube didn't soak, he would lose a long-term source of investment feedback.

How could anyone not like taking a bath?

Surely no one could resist it...

Once she experiences it, who could refuse such happiness?

Ice Cube might change her mind later.

...

Nightfall.

【Congratulations, Host, for investing in 'Shang Wu' with an Exotic Beast Dish.】

【Investment Feedback: Pine Pattern Purple Smoke Beast Ink.】

【Congratulations, Host, for investing in 'Ying Bing' with an Exotic Beast Dish.】

【Investment Feedback: Qilin Fragrant Inkstone.】

Autumn Water Pavilion had just finished dinner.

Li Mo had also received two top-quality pieces of the Four Treasures of the Study.

Come to think of it, lately, he had often been getting feedback like this. It wasn't like he was preparing for the imperial examinations...

Shang Wu had already changed into her bathrobe.

Hmm...

His mother had underestimated the "majesty" of the beautiful Master. If the fabric hadn't been of good quality, it might have burst.

To avoid such a situation.

Shang Wu undid two buttons and asked:

"Little Bing'er, are you really not going to soak?"

"No."

Ying Bing shook her head gently and went to the kitchen to wash the dishes.

Shang Wu pouted.

She had wanted to have a water fight with Little Bing'er.

Not long after.

The master and disciple soaked in the pool.

"Hmm~"

Shang Wu let out a comfortable hum. Her peony-like face was now flushed with red, blooming even more brilliantly.

She glanced at Li Mo not far away and said:

"It's comfortable, but don't soak for too long. Go practice early."

"The Wushen Summit in Yunzhou is counting on you and Little Bing'er to bring glory to our sect."

Hearing this, Li Mo smiled and wiped the water from his face.

"Rest assured, Master. I won't delay anything."

He took a bottle of Earth Vein Spiritual Milk from his System Space.

Then, while Shang Wu was stunned, he poured half of it directly into the pool.

Afterward, he leaned back against the pool wall with a look of contentment, feeling the warm, tingling sensation.

"So extravagant."

Shang Wu was often criticized by other elders for being wasteful, but she couldn't help but mutter at this moment.

Using such a precious item for a bath?

Li Mo smiled modestly.

"Your disciple has a bit of a fortune."

Shang Wu rolled her eyes, then the corners of her mouth curled up.

"If Elder Xue were here, he'd probably have his eyes roll back and faint on the spot."

It didn't matter that Elder Xue wasn't here. She could tell him personally next time!

After enjoying herself for a while, Li Mo asked again:

"By the way, Master, does our Qunyu Peak have any remaining Viewing God Diagrams or fundamental diagrams?"
