# Chapter 12: First-tier Sword Art – Galechaser Sword Technique

The turbulent waves of the Southwest Sea of Myriad Stars crashed against the pitch-black hull of a cargo ship, creating rhythmic splashes.

Standing on the deck, Chen Daoxuan gazed at the endless sea before turning to Clan Leader Chen Xianhe. "Thirteenth Uncle, is this our clan's Canglong cargo ship?"

"Haha, yes, this is it," Chen Xianhe replied, running his hand along the ship's mast. "This must be your first time aboard a ship, right?"

Chen Daoxuan nodded.

Though this was his second life, sailing across the ocean was a first for Chen Daoxuan, filling him with a sense of novelty.

"At first, sea voyages seem exciting, but the novelty wears off quickly. Our journey to Spirit Shell Island is long—even at the Canglong's speed, it will take at least a month."

Chen Xianhe was right. Within less than the time it took an incense stick to burn, Chen Daoxuan already felt bored. The endless expanse of blue water stretched before him, offering nothing new.

Suddenly remembering something, Chen Daoxuan asked, "Thirteenth Uncle, didn't you always say the Sea of Myriad Stars is dangerous, with frequent demon beast attacks?"

"That's only if you stray from the established routes. On fixed shipping lanes, the Sea of Myriad Stars is quite safe. After all, demon beasts have intelligence—they know which areas are safe and which are dangerous."

Chen Daoxuan was taken aback. He had half-expected a demon beast or two to appear during the voyage, giving him a chance to test his skills. It seemed he had overestimated the risks.

As days passed, the monotony of sea travel became unbearable. After the initial excitement faded, Chen Daoxuan spent most of his time secluded in the cabin, cultivating.

However, without a spiritual vein on board, he could only absorb the sparse ambient spiritual energy, making his progress painfully slow. Frustrated, he eventually abandoned cultivation altogether and turned to studying spells instead.

For Qi Refinement cultivators, combat primarily relied on spells, magical artifacts, and talismans. While artifacts and talismans required purchasing with spirit stones, spells were a means to harness one's own power.

Like artifacts, spells were categorized into first-tier, second-tier, and third-tier. However, unlike artifacts, spells within the same tier had no further subdivisions. For example, the first-tier Fire Control spell was fundamentally the same whether practiced by a first-layer or ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator—there was no distinction between low-grade or high-grade versions.

Yet, the proficiency in a spell varied among practitioners. In the cultivation world, spell mastery was divided into four stages: Initiation, Minor Achievement, Major Achievement, and Perfection.

For Qi Refinement cultivators, reaching Initiation in a spell was relatively easy—even the dullest could manage it within a few months. However, progressing beyond that proved far more challenging.

After five years of cultivation, Chen Daoxuan had only mastered two spells: Wind Riding for travel and Fire Control for artifact forging. He had yet to learn any combat or defensive spells.

This wasn't due to lack of talent but rather limited time and energy. Over the past five years, Chen Daoxuan had focused on cultivating the "Origin Return Technique," studying artifact forging, and developing the Spirit Fusion Furnace from scratch. Even with his exceptional aptitude, he simply couldn't spare the effort for combat spells.

That didn't mean he was defenseless, however. Beyond spells, cultivators primarily relied on magical artifacts for combat. As an artifact forger capable of crafting first-tier high-grade artifacts, Chen Daoxuan was far from unarmed.

Hidden in his storage pouch was his sole first-tier high-grade artifact—a water-attribute flying sword named "Flying Snow." Since its creation, it had remained his trump card, unknown even to his uncle, Chen Xianhe.

Though powerful, the Flying Snow Sword consumed vast amounts of Qi. At the second layer of Qi Refinement, Chen Daoxuan could unleash only three full-powered strikes before exhausting his reserves. Even now, at the third layer, he estimated he could manage just one additional strike before becoming completely drained.

On the tenth day of the voyage, Chen Daoxuan sat cross-legged in the cabin, eyes closed. Observing the ten motes of stardust orbiting the golden scripture in his sea of consciousness, excitement surged within him.

His experiment had confirmed it: reciting the "Primordial Enlightenment Sutra" once daily accumulated one mote of stardust. After ten days, ten motes could be exchanged for a moment of enlightenment.

Through trial and error, Chen Daoxuan had discerned the rules governing the stardust:

1. No matter how many times he recited the sutra in a day, only one mote would be stored. Additional recitations merely restored expended spiritual sense, as before.
2. The maximum storage was ten motes. If unused, they would continue orbiting the golden scripture indefinitely.
3. When ten motes collided and fused, they dramatically enhanced his comprehension, inducing an enlightenment-like state.

A profound realization struck him—the ten motes represented the sutra's method of storing his daily comprehension potential, accumulating it over ten days for concentrated use. The idea that comprehension could be stockpiled like currency or grain was astonishing, yet undeniable. Chen Daoxuan resolved to guard the "Primordial Enlightenment Sutra" as his greatest secret.

During the voyage, though unable to cultivate the "Origin Return Technique," Chen Daoxuan hadn't wasted time. He had decided to master a new spell—a notion that would have drawn ridicule from other Qi Refinement cultivators.

While initiating a first-tier spell wasn't difficult, achieving proficiency within a month was impossible. Most Qi Refinement cultivators considered it an accomplishment merely to initiate a spell in that timeframe. Reaching Minor Achievement in a month was unthinkable, even for a Heaven Spiritual Root cultivator with elixirs.

Typically, achieving Minor Achievement in a first-tier spell required at least a year, while Major Achievement demanded five years or more. As for Perfection, that realm transcended mere time investment—it required extraordinary innate comprehension. When cultivators spoke of fully mastering a spell, they usually meant reaching Major Achievement.
