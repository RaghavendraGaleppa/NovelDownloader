# Chapter 28: The Ability of Heaven and Man to Transform Life

This woman was highly unusual. In the freezing environment of minus dozens of degrees, she wore only a thin, plain silk robe. Due to his enhanced vision since practicing martial arts, Xu Yunfan could even clearly see Li Miaoyun's voluptuous figure.

*This world seems quite open-minded.*

Xu Yunfan silently glanced at Fang Mushan and Li Haomiao. Aside from solemnity in their eyes, they showed no disdain for the woman's indecent appearance.

Li Miaoyun said indifferently, "Your Highness the Prince of Yan, His Majesty wishes to see you. Come with me."

Li Haomiao's face turned cold. "They broke my limbs and threw me into the mines of Ningguta. Now they say they want to see me? Has that demon woman gone mad?"

Li Miaoyun replied calmly, "You carry the blood of the royal family and naturally cannot be allowed to wander outside. His Majesty said this time is merely a punishment for you. Come with me. If you go to the Hall of Mental Cultivation and properly admit your wrongs to His Majesty, after she passes away, you will be the Emperor."

How could Li Haomiao endure such humiliation?

He roared, "Tell that demon woman that I will return—properly and uprightly—to trample her beneath my feet. I will never return in such a cowardly manner."

Li Miaoyun said, "You are already disabled. What can you use to resist? Your Highness the Prince of Yan, let's go."

As she spoke, Li Miaoyun slowly walked toward Li Haomiao. As she passed, Xu Yunfan's gaze sharpened.

*This woman leaves no footprints in the snow.*

"Stepping on Snow Without a Trace!" Fang Mushan's expression was extremely solemn. "She must have cultivated Qi."

External training focuses on muscles, bones, and skin. Advancing from the Three External Unions to training flesh, blood, marrow, and organs with Qi—among the Nine Realms of Martial Dao, this woman seemed to have reached the pinnacle.

Li Haomiao narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing within. He said in a deep voice, "Stepping on Snow Without a Trace? It seems you are the Holy Maiden of the Celestial Pivot Sect, otherwise you wouldn't be traveling in such light clothing and thin gauze. I thought you had truly reached the realm of a Grandmaster. To nurture such a thread of Qi, your body must be riddled with holes, right?"

Li Miaoyun's expression remained indifferent, blending seamlessly with the wind and snow of the heavens and earth. She said calmly, "A single thread of Qi can move the myriad things of the world, killing people as easily as cutting wild grass. My Celestial Pivot Sect naturally has marvelous methods."

Hearing this, Fang Mushan's expression eased slightly. If a true Grandmaster were blocking their path, they would have no chance of winning and could only surrender.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's confusion, Fang Mushan lowered his voice and explained, "The Celestial Pivot Sect has a legacy spanning thousands of years. They possess a marvelous technique that allows one to cultivate a thread of Qi even while in the Three External Unions realm. However, this technique has both pros and cons. Although it enables one to do what ordinary people cannot, the practitioner's body becomes extremely frail to sustain this thread of Qi. Once they lose it, they are no different from an ordinary weak woman."

Li Haomiao turned to look at Fang Mushan and Xu Yunfan and said solemnly, "This is a grudge between me and that demon woman. You two go over the mountain top, head down, and keep moving forward."

Xu Yunfan and Fang Mushan exchanged a glance. Without hesitation, Xu Yunfan nodded firmly and said straightforwardly, "Your Highness the Prince of Yan, go ahead. I will mourn you every year on this day!"

With that, he turned and ran, his footsteps swift, vanishing instantly into the swirling snow.

Fang Mushan flushed red, then cupped his fists and said, "I shall do the same!"

With that, he fled like a startled bird, quickly departing.

Seeing this scene, the corner of Li Haomiao's eye twitched slightly.

Although he had been mentally prepared, seeing Xu Yunfan and Fang Mushan leave so decisively still brought a hint of sorrow to his heart.

He sighed inwardly. There are no true close friends in this world; they were merely fellow sufferers by coincidence.

Li Miaoyun withdrew her gaze from the direction Xu Yunfan had left and met Li Haomiao's sharp stare. She said coldly, "Rest assured, I will let them sleep forever in the accumulation of clouds on the mountain."

Li Miaoyun walked gracefully to Li Haomiao's front, extending her jade-white fingers as slender as scallions to grab Li Haomiao's clothes and lift him up.

At this moment, Li Haomiao's only remaining left hand shot out like lightning, grabbing Li Miaoyun's wrist.

Li Miaoyun frowned slightly, a flash of displeasure in her eyes.

Instantly, a color like faint blue veins appeared on her wrist. An inexplicable, immense force shot out from her wrist, attempting to shake off Li Haomiao's fingers.

To her surprise, Li Haomiao's seemingly weak arm was now as tough as an iron hoop.

The thread of Qi she released could easily shatter a boulder, but she couldn't break free from Li Haomiao's grip. Li Haomiao slowly raised his head, his gaze sharper than ever before, as if it could pierce through a person's heart.

"You should understand, Holy Maiden of the Celestial Pivot Sect, that the Li family of the Great Zhou royal clan is a True Blood family."

As he spoke, his abdomen churned violently, and his throat kept convulsing.

Immediately after, a golden, round pill, the size of a thumb and emitting a faint light, appeared in his mouth.

A strange fragrance instantly wafted from his mouth, causing Li Miaoyun, who had a cleanliness obsession, to frown deeply.

Even though she knew the pill in his mouth was an extremely rare treasure, deep down, she absolutely did not want to touch it, let alone breathe in the smell coming from Li Haomiao's mouth.

However, she recognized the pill in Li Haomiao's mouth immediately.

"The Dao Sect's Dragon and Tiger Great Pill!?"

Li Miaoyun sensed danger instantly. Her hand became as slippery as a loach, twisting in a way beyond ordinary imagination to grab Li Haomiao's wrist in reverse.

Simultaneously, her other hand quickly raised a finger, which turned into a sharp blade, stabbing toward Li Haomiao's forehead.

Her finger was incredibly sharp, instantly tearing through the air and bringing about a sharp whistling sound.

This finger strike contained immense power, capable of piercing through metal and stone.

Li Haomiao seemed to have anticipated this,及时偏侧脑袋 (timely tilted his head). Li Miaoyun's fingertip grazed his forehead, and blood immediately splattered. A fierce, distinct ruthlessness appeared on Li Haomiao's face.

Then, a shocking scene occurred.

The severed shoulder and legs suddenly burst open. As if cells were multiplying frantically and rapidly, countless strands of blood and flesh liquid writhed wildly like tentacles at the ruptured points.

Under Li Miaoyun's shocked and moved expression, the originally severed limbs were now rapidly piled up, writhing, swelling, and then quickly contracting with countless amounts of blood and flesh.

In the blink of an eye, Li Haomiao stood before Li Miaoyun, completely unharmed.

Meeting Li Miaoyun's slightly dazed gaze, Li Haomiao moved his hands and feet. A smile appeared on his handsome, flawless face, revealing his white teeth.

"Heaven and man transform life. For one who possesses True Blood, accomplishing this is merely a commonplace matter."

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Haomiao charged at Li Miaoyun like a wild bull, his hands and feet carrying the momentum of wind and thunder.

Li Miaoyun's expression remained calm as she quickly sidestepped to dodge. Simultaneously, her palms moved rapidly, palm shadows fluttering. Every move carried a sharp gust of wind, directly targeting Li Haomiao's vital points.

Li Haomiao's figure moved like lightning, dodging left and right while continuously searching for Li Miaoyun's flaws.
