# Chapter 8: Charging-Style Cultivation Practice

Yuanshen Temple.  
Kitchen.  

Liu Haizhu was eating slowly while Xiao Ji waited for him to finish so he could wash the dishes.  

During the wait:  

"Master, does our temple have any decent magical artifacts? I plan to travel far in a few days—about a hundred miles. It'd be good to have something for self-defense, even a weapon would do."  

Xiao Ji thought of those people at the Lu residence who were weaker than him but at least had impressive magical artifacts and weapons.  

Even if he didn't have a flashy artifact, he shouldn’t go empty-handed.  

Moreover, he intended to visit the Child-Giving Temple to gather information. If he could get his hands on the One-Stringed Pipa, that would be ideal. After obtaining the artifact, he could report the wicked doctor to the authorities.  

A place like that was dangerous—it was best to have a protective artifact.  

"Ever since you nearly stabbed yourself to death practicing swordplay, I sold all the dangerous weapons to the blacksmith," Liu Haizhu said, chewing on a vegetable.  

After finishing the vegetable, he pondered for a moment and added, "But I think there’s still a sword in the alchemy room—just can’t remember where it is."  

The alchemy room had been abandoned for a long time. As far as Xiao Ji could remember, his master had never refined any pills. The furnace had never been lit—perhaps because the temple was too poor.  

But his master often slept there and studied chess manuals.  

"One is enough. I originally planned to go to the Niu Family Blacksmith to order a sword today, but the cost was too high, and it would take ten days to complete…" Xiao Ji rambled about his day before confirming his willingness to check the alchemy room. "If we already have one here, I’ll make do with it."  

After his master finished eating, Xiao Ji opened a pack of osmanthus cakes he had bought and shared them as dessert.  

Liu Haizhu picked up a piece, tasted it, and nodded in approval.  

"Little Jiji is so thoughtful. Your master is very pleased. The taste of this osmanthus cake reminds me of that afternoon 250 years ago…"  

Xiao Ji fell silent for a moment. "Disciple isn’t that young anymore. Maybe you could call me something else?"  

"That makes sense," Liu Haizhu mused. "Then I’ll call you Ji’er from now on."  

Xiao Ji: "…"  

As long as his master was happy. The name wasn’t worth fussing over.  

Entering the alchemy room, the place felt chilly due to the cold furnace.  

Xiao Ji lit a lamp, illuminating the space so he could see clearly.  

"Take your time searching. I’ll rest for a bit." His master sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, wrapping himself tightly in his cotton-padded coat.  

Xiao Ji first scanned the walls, but none of the hanging items were swords. He channeled his spiritual energy, activating his perception. Within a radius of half a zhang, all objects' information flooded his mind.  

Finally, he found a pitch-black sword inside the alchemy furnace—and froze in shock.  

**[Thunderclap Sword – Heaven-grade, high-tier. Its sword energy spans heaven and earth, repelling all thunder. If the wielder is at the Nascent Soul stage, they can summon, control, and sever lightning.]**  

**[Deep perception gained. Cultivation +10.]**  

The description felt like a dream—which was why Xiao Ji stood there dumbfounded, staring at the blackened sword.  

"It seems the Yuanshen Temple is truly extraordinary. Master must have some hidden skills after all. He must be using poverty-based education to guide me, like those wealthy families who pretend to be poor before suddenly revealing their immense fortune to their children…"  

"But when I perceived him, he really was just an old man at Qi Refining Stage 3—the same level as me now."  

His mind was in turmoil.  

Liu Haizhu watched his stunned disciple and said, "That’s the one. You might need to sharpen it before using it… I can’t remember which year it was, but I used it to chop firewood while refining pills. Never thought I’d left it in the furnace." He added absentmindedly, "Good thing I forgot it there. Otherwise, when you nearly stabbed yourself, I would’ve sold it along with the others."  

It seemed his master wasn’t some hidden expert after all—he’d nearly sold a peerless sword as scrap metal.  

For a Qi Refining Stage 3 cultivator, how could he not recognize such a treasure?  

Then again, this was the highest-grade sword known. How could someone with low cultivation possibly grasp its value?  

"Master, where did this sword come from?" Xiao Ji asked.  

His master might not recognize its worth, but the sword had to have an origin.  

"It was already here when I arrived at Yuanshen Temple. I didn’t buy it." Liu Haizhu yawned, clearly growing drowsy.  

"What about the scabbard?"  

"Not sure. Look around—maybe it’s in the furnace too."  

Asking was pointless. Xiao Ji continued scanning the alchemy room and eventually found the scabbard on a roof beam.  

Under the round table, he pulled out a worn book from beneath one of the legs—an ancient sword manual.  

**[Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet-Gold Art – Heaven-grade sword technique. If your cultivation matches and your sword’s quality is sufficient, slaying dragons is like slicing vegetables, splitting mountains is like slicing vegetables, parting seas is like slicing vegetables, cleaving the heavens is like slicing vegetables…]**  

**[Deep perception gained. Cultivation +20.]**  

As the cultivation points registered, Xiao Ji’s entire body shuddered as if electrocuted, tingling for a long moment.  

**[Name: Xiao Ji]**  
**[Age: 19]**  
**[Faction: Yuanshen Temple]**  
**[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, fluctuating in number]**  
**[Cultivation: Qi Refining Stage 4 (0/40)]**  
**[Technique: Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet-Gold Art]**  
**[Perception Range: One zhang]**  

Another breakthrough.  

His perception range had expanded significantly. One zhang might not seem vast now, but compared to the previous inch-level range, it was a massive improvement. And since he was only at Qi Refining, once he reached Foundation Establishment, it might increase by whole li increments.  

This sudden advancement surprised Xiao Ji.  

He had merely perceived two objects and jumped from Qi Refining Stage 3 to 4. It seemed leveling up required interacting with cultivators or artifacts—those yielded higher rewards.  

"Master, why was such an incredible sword manual used as a table leg prop?" Xiao Ji asked, heart aching.  

"Oh, that? Useless. I tried practicing it but got nowhere. If the table leg hadn’t needed leveling, I would’ve burned it long ago." Liu Haizhu roused from his light nap with a yawn. "Well, you found your sword, and I’m tired. Time to rest."  

That night, Xiao Ji didn’t sleep.  

After polishing the blackened sword, he pored over the *Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet-Gold Art*, only to find he couldn’t understand a thing.  

In desperation, he used his perception to delve deeper into the manual.  

**[You focus intently on comprehending the *Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet-Gold Art*. Comprehension progress: 1%]**  

"So this is how you practice it?" Xiao Ji was both shocked and delighted.  

This charging-style cultivation method was undeniably thrilling.  

**[You focus intently on comprehending the *Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet-Gold Art*. Comprehension progress: 3%]**  

By midnight:  

**[You focus intently on comprehending the *Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Violet-Gold Art*. Comprehension progress: 100%]**  

**[You have successfully mastered this sword technique. Its power scales with your cultivation—the higher your realm, the mightier its effects.]**  

Success.
