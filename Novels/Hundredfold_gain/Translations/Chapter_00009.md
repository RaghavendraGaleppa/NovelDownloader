# Chapter 9: The Ban

Some time later.

At the main peak, within the grand hall of discussions.

As the spiritual land of the Qi Family, Red Maple Valley sat atop a first-grade upper-tier spiritual vein. However, only certain areas of the main peak reached this level of spiritual energy concentration—these were also the secluded cultivation grounds of the Qi Family's Ancestor. 

The other peaks varied between first-grade middle and lower-tier spiritual energy. Even the secluded cultivation sites of the elders only reached first-grade middle-tier at best.

The main peak housed various halls and offices dedicated to handling the complex affairs of the family. Among them, the grand hall of discussions was the most important, as all pivotal decisions regarding the family's future were made there.

At this moment, within the spacious and brightly lit hall, a massive and exquisite landscape mural was displayed—depicting the panoramic view of Red Maple Valley. Below the mural, a row of chairs crafted from Red Maple Spirit Wood stood in a line. Seated at the center was an elderly cultivator, his eyes slightly closed, his brows tightly furrowed as if troubled by some vexing matter.

This elderly cultivator appeared unremarkable at first glance, yet within him surged a formidable wave of spiritual power. He was none other than the Qi Family's sole Foundation Establishment Ancestor—Qi Wuyou.

Flanking Qi Wuyou were the family elders, all at the late-stage Qi Refinement realm and of considerable age, with only two or three appearing middle-aged.

The hall was arranged with rows of seats, each spaced apart. Presently, all Qi Family cultivators—except those away on business—had gathered, numbering around seventy to eighty in total, seated according to their cultivation levels.

Qi Chuan and Qi Baicang, at Qi Refinement first-layer and third-layer respectively, naturally occupied the last row and the seats toward the rear.

Qi Chuan glanced around the last row and noticed that none of the other spiritual seedlings tested alongside him that day were present. 

"Those who haven't broken through to Qi Refinement first-layer probably aren't yet considered true members of the main family line, hence their absence," Qi Chuan surmised.

His gaze then shifted forward, where he saw fewer than twenty mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators seated closer to the front. As for the late-stage elders at the highest seats, they numbered only in the single digits. Among them, Qi Chuan recognized the elder who had presided over the scripture transmission that day.

Remembering the red-clad young woman from the scripture hall, Qi Chuan scanned the room and quickly spotted her graceful figure.

"Is she a descendant of the scripture elder?" Qi Chuan wondered, though he averted his gaze after only a brief glance.

When he looked back to the front, the Qi Family Patriarch, Qi Wuyou, had opened his eyes. After sweeping his gaze across the assembly, he spoke.

"Let's keep this brief. The reason I've summoned you all is that a secret realm has appeared two hundred li southwest of Red Maple Valley!"

A secret realm?

At these words, the expressions of everyone in the hall shifted. Some showed excitement and yearning, while others grew tense with worry.

Though secret realms often held opportunities that could elevate one's cultivation, they also brought danger. Even if one chose not to enter, trouble could still find its way to them—after all, two hundred li was not a great distance. And wherever a secret realm appeared, turmoil was sure to follow.

"However, that secret realm is no longer our concern. The Fengyue Sect has already sealed it off, declaring a fifty-li radius around it as a forbidden zone. Any cultivator from a family or wandering loose cultivators found within will be executed on sight!" Qi Wuyou's voice was grave.

"How tyrannical of the Fengyue Sect!" Qi Chuan thought, inwardly shocked.

Though he had no intention of venturing near the secret realm with his current meager strength, the Fengyue Sect's heavy-handed approach still struck him as excessively domineering. Yet, they undeniably had the power to enforce it.

Qi Chuan speculated that a secret realm capable of drawing such attention from the Fengyue Sect must at least contain resources valuable to Core Formation cultivators—certainly nothing as trivial as Foundation Establishment opportunities would warrant this level of response.

"...Therefore, after discussing with the elders, I've decided that effective immediately, all family members are to remain within our territory unless granted explicit permission. Violators will face clan discipline. Those with urgent business must report and receive approval before leaving." Qi Wuyou announced solemnly.

This measure was to prevent family members from stirring up trouble. Matters involving the Fengyue Sect were no trifle—a single misunderstanding could spell disaster for the entire clan. As for the secret realm, since the Fengyue Sect had taken control, whatever extraordinary treasures lay within were far beyond the Qi Family's reach.

The hall remained silent, with no objections raised. This was, after all, the collective decision of the Patriarch and the elders.

After a few additional remarks from Qi Wuyou, the elders took over to elaborate on the details—particularly the scripture elder, who spoke at length.

The entire assembly lasted roughly half an hour. Throughout, even the mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators—considered the family's backbone—had no say in the proceedings.

"The situation is growing unstable. It seems I'll have to lay low within the family for now. Not that I had any plans to venture out soon anyway," Qi Chuan mused.

Even staying put, his strength would grow steadily thanks to the hundredfold multiplier. Besides, with his current first-layer cultivation, what could he possibly accomplish outside?

As the assembly concluded, the cultivators dispersed, returning to their respective peaks.

"Ah, Chuan, it looks like we'll be stuck on our peak for a while. But that's not entirely bad—at least we won't have to take on as many family tasks, if any," Qi Baicang remarked with a sigh as they returned to their solitary peak.

Qi Chuan knew that upon reaching Qi Refinement first-layer and officially joining the main family line, one was required to complete at least two family tasks per year. Sometimes, tasks were forcibly assigned. Whether chosen or assigned, completing them would earn spirit stones or contribution points.

But with the secret realm situation unfolding, the family likely wouldn't enforce external tasks. At most, there might be internal tasks, though these were limited in number and insufficient for all cultivators to share under current circumstances.

It seemed he could indeed focus on cultivation undisturbed for the time being.

Back in his room, Qi Chuan sat cross-legged on his bed. The emergence of the secret realm had stirred a faint sense of crisis within him. His current first-layer strength still felt inadequate—it was time to improve.

Closing his eyes, Qi Chuan began circulating the Evergreen Art. As a wisp of spiritual power flowed from his dantian along specific meridian pathways, a faint attractive force emanated from his body.

In response, the surrounding space rippled slightly as minuscule specks of spiritual energy materialized, then entered his body through his breath and pores. These motes of energy gradually transformed as they circulated through his meridians, eventually merging with his dantian's existing spiritual power as fine strands of refined energy.

Though the process was slow, it was steady.

After completing one full cycle of the Evergreen Art, all the energy had returned to his dantian. When Qi Chuan opened his eyes, a line of text appeared in his vision:

[Through diligent cultivation, you completed one full cycle of the Evergreen Art, triggering a 20x multiplier. You gained 20x the rewards—your spiritual power has slightly increased.]
