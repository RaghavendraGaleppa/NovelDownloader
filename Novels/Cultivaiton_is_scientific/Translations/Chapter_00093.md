# Chapter 93 First Encounter  

The paper crane flew for about an hour, taking Li Shiming far from the Eagle Beak Island where his cave residence was located.  

Flying over the sea was monotonous, but he couldn't afford to let his guard down. He had to remain vigilant against potential dangers on the water's surface.  

Although sea beasts were rare in the sect's waters, they weren't nonexistent. Worse still were rogue cultivators, far more dangerous than sea beasts.  

This area was even farther from the sect's Nine Peaks, making it considerably less safe.  

Out on the open sea, far from the sect, killing a weak cultivator could be an easy way to make a quick profit—something unscrupulous cultivators wouldn't hesitate to do.  

"What's that in the distance?" Li Shiming spotted a faint shadow in his field of vision and quickly took out his monocular telescope to observe.  

It was a small flying boat, about five meters long, hovering over the sea. The boat was entirely emerald green, with a wooden cabin in the center. On the front deck, a figure in green robes was crouched, seemingly engaged in some activity.  

Li Shiming's attention wasn't on the figure but on the flying boat itself.  

This was a flying boat—smaller than the one he had taken when he first arrived at the sect, but still a personal flying vessel.  

He was no longer a clueless newcomer. After interacting with several fellow cultivators, he had learned much about the sect's workings.  

Personal flying boats were either rented from the sect for long-distance missions or privately owned by high-ranking disciples.  

Li Shiming glanced down at his paper crane, then back at the flying boat, his eyes filled with envy.  

Wanting a closer look—and since the flying boat happened to be along his route—he steered the paper crane closer.  

Just then, the clouds darkened, and the wind grew damper.  

Within moments, heavy raindrops began to fall.  

Li Shiming hastily took out an oil-paper umbrella to shield himself.  

His cultivation was still weak. A proper cultivator would have used spiritual energy to deflect the rain. But with a long journey ahead and no telling when the rain would stop, he couldn't afford to expend his spiritual energy recklessly.  

If the paper crane got soaked and failed, he would be in serious trouble.  

Of course, the paper crane had some waterproofing measures, but looking at its fragile frame, Li Shiming wasn't confident in relying on its durability.  

A mere third-level Qi Refining cultivator stranded in the middle of the sea with no means of flight would have to swim—and the ocean was far from safe. A Qi Refining cultivator swimming in the water was like ringing a dinner bell for sea beasts.  

---  

As the paper crane approached within ten meters of the flying boat, Li Shiming saw that the green-robed figure was a woman. Her face wasn't visible since her back was turned, but for some reason, she wasn’t using any means to shield herself from the rain.  

Instead, she remained crouched on the deck, her hands moving as if writing something.  

The rain had soaked her robes, clinging to her body and outlining her graceful curves.  

Li Shiming realized she must be in some kind of focused state, completely absorbed in her task.  

The woman was writing intently, seemingly oblivious to the downpour.  

As the paper crane drew closer, Li Shiming saw that she was holding a brush, painting or writing on a sheet of paper. Raindrops splattered onto the paper, disrupting her work, and she instinctively shielded it with her body.  

This action left more of her robes drenched, accentuating her figure further.  

Li Shiming frowned. He didn’t know what she was doing, but it must be important. With a flick of his finger, a sword light shot out and hovered above her head.  

His *Sword Control Technique* formed a barrier, deflecting all raindrops away from her.  

In the curtain of rain, the paper crane and the flying boat remained motionless. Li Shiming averted his gaze from the woman’s figure, looking instead at the distant horizon.  

From the brief glimpse he had caught earlier, her face was breathtaking—delicate brows, skin like jade.  

She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in both his lifetimes. Whether it was due to cultivation or not, her appearance and bearing were peerless, carrying an aura of harmony with nature.  

Normally, Li Shiming, cautious as he was, would never have approached a stranger so closely.  

With his current cultivation, any cultivator in these waters could easily kill him if he wasn’t careful.  

But when he saw her, he sensed her connection with nature, an instinctive assurance that she posed no threat.  

The rain intensified, and Li Shiming expanded the *Sword Control Technique*’s barrier to cover a wider area.  

This tested his mastery of the technique, but fortunately, his *Sword Control Technique* was highly refined.  

The woman in green finally emerged from her trance, sensing the sword hovering above her. She didn’t panic, quickly realizing it was shielding her from the rain.  

Her face, as radiant as the autumn moon, softened with gratitude. She had been in a moment of enlightenment—if the rain had ruined her work, the insight might have been lost forever.  

---  

"Yin Shilan thanks the fellow Daoist for your assistance!" She looked up at Li Shiming, offering a smile so dazzling it nearly blinded him.  

At that very moment, the rain stopped. A gap formed in the clouds, and a beam of sunlight illuminated the flying boat—and Yin Shilan’s exquisite features.  

Li Shiming’s breath hitched, but he quickly composed himself.  

"Fellow Daoist Yin, it was nothing," he replied, turning his gaze away politely.  

With a wave of his hand, he recalled *Lieyan Sword*.  

Only then did Yin Shilan realize her current state.  

Her face flushed crimson. Normally composed, she had never imagined she would appear so disheveled before a man.  

With a graceful motion, she retreated into the cabin, and the flying boat abruptly accelerated into the distance.  

In her haste and embarrassment, she even forgot the sheet of paper on the deck.  

The flying boat vanished almost instantly, as if fleeing her own mortification.  

Only the sheet of paper remained, fluttering in the air. Li Shiming activated *Telekinesis*, summoning a spiritual hand to catch it.  

The paper was covered in elegant script and symbols—some he recognized, but most were beyond his understanding.  

Still, it was clear that Yin Shilan had been engrossed in studying formations. This was a design draft for an array.  

Li Shiming chuckled as he watched the direction the flying boat had disappeared. Seeing an ethereal beauty lose her composure made her seem more human.  

---  

"My design draft!" Yin Shilan only remembered the formation blueprint after flying far away.  

Fortunately, she had memorized it during her enlightenment, so she could recreate it.  

But that draft had taken her considerable effort and a rare moment of insight. If it fell into the wrong hands, it could cause trouble.  

Still, she was too embarrassed to turn back now. At least for the time being, she didn’t want to face that young cultivator again.  

She took out her identity jade slip and performed a series of operations.  

"Li Shiming, new sect disciple, Spirit Farmer, Eagle Beak Island," she murmured.  

Had Li Shiming been present, he would have been shocked—he hadn’t known identity slips could be used this way.  

Of course, this wasn’t a privilege available to just anyone. Only core members of the sect had the authority to query nearby identity slips.  

---  

Meanwhile, Li Shiming stored the formation draft away. The encounter had been fleeting, and he harbored no further thoughts about it.  

Though he couldn’t discern Yin Shilan’s exact cultivation level, she was undoubtedly far stronger than him. And her possession of a flying boat suggested she held a high status in the sect.  

A fairy-like beauty like her was merely a passing breeze in his otherwise tedious cultivation life—pleasant to behold but incapable of swaying his heart.  

He steered the paper crane onward toward Brightmoon Island.  

The delay meant it was already nine in the morning by the time he spotted the island.  

Instead of contacting Qiu Tan, he landed on the island himself.  

The market on Brightmoon Island was located on a protruding peninsula, easily identifiable.  

All visiting cultivators had to enter through the peninsula’s entrance, which was protected by a large formation.  

Since this was Heavenly Sea Sect territory, the daytime market was exclusive to sect members, ensuring security.  

Besides, the biggest spenders in the area were Heavenly Sea Sect disciples anyway.  

Li Shiming presented his identity slip and passed through the formation’s inspection, entering the peninsula.  

The area resembled a small town, with quaint buildings lining the streets.  

He browsed as he walked, eventually entering a法器 (artifact) shop.  

"Looking to buy artifacts, fellow Daoist?" An elderly cultivator, likely at the second level of Qi Refining, greeted him with a smile.  

The shop’s displayed items weren’t genuine artifacts—just ordinary weapons shaped like them, likely for promotional purposes.  

This was, after all, a market for Qi Refining cultivators within the sect. Basic low-grade artifacts were provided by the sect, while mid and high-grade ones wouldn’t be openly displayed.  

"I have some artifacts I’d like to sell. Does your shop purchase them?" Li Shiming asked after scanning the shop.  

"Of course! We buy artifacts as well as spirit ores and refined stones," the old man replied eagerly.  

Without further ado, Li Shiming retrieved four low-grade swords, a low-grade shield, and a mid-grade sword from the Hao family’s stash and placed them on the counter.  

The old man’s eyes widened slightly. He glanced at Li Shiming, then at the markings on the artifacts.  

He didn’t recognize the insignia, but it clearly belonged to the same faction.  

If not for the mediocre quality of the artifacts, he might have sounded an alarm.  

How many cultivators from one faction had this young man killed to amass so many of their artifacts?  

"Low-grade artifacts like these are poor quality and won’t sell within the sect. We’d have to transport them outside and remove the markings. The mid-grade sword has some value. How about 200 spirit stones for the lot?" The old man haggled without missing a beat.  

"Do you have mid-grade shield artifacts?" Li Shiming changed the subject, dissatisfied with the low offer.  

"Just one in stock—a mid-grade *Spirit Tortoise Shield* crafted from a first-tier spirit tortoise shell. It’ll cost you 300 spirit stones," the old man said.  

"Let me see it."  

The old man produced a black tortoise-shell shield, unconcerned about theft—daytime market transactions were secure among sect members.  

Li Shiming tapped the shield lightly. Though he didn’t use *Dragon-Painting Technique*, he could sense its superior quality compared to the Hao family’s mid-grade shield.  

Hao family artifacts, being products of rogue cultivators, were inferior in every way.  

"Add this mid-grade shield, and I’ll trade for the *Spirit Tortoise Shield*," Li Shiming said, tossing the Hao family’s mid-grade shield onto the counter.  

The old man inspected it carefully, calculating its worth.  

"Fine, I’ll take the loss. Deal," he said with a pained expression.  

Li Shiming scoffed inwardly—the old man was making a killing.  

But the Hao family artifacts were useless to him now. No sect disciple would be interested in them except as scrap.  

As he left with the *Spirit Tortoise Shield*, the old man grinned broadly behind him.  

Li Shiming was in high spirits too. Clearing out the Hao family’s artifacts and acquiring a usable mid-grade shield severed his last ties to that chapter of his life.  

"Fellow Daoist Li! Why didn’t you contact me when you came to Brightmoon Island?" A familiar voice, warm yet slightly reproachful, called out.  

It was Qiu Tan. Li Shiming hadn’t expected to run into him here.  

"Fellow Daoist Qiu, I was just browsing. Didn’t want to trouble you," Li Shiming explained with a smile.  

"Nonsense! Your visit could’ve been good for business," Qiu Tan said, gesturing to a nearby shop with a spirit plant emblem.  

Ah, so that was why Qiu Tan had been so friendly—he wanted Li Shiming’s spirit crops.  

Well, it didn’t matter who he sold to. Li Shiming rather liked Qiu Tan.  

"Did you bring spirit rice this time? We’re buying at one spirit stone per pound—as much as you’ve got!" Qiu Tan got straight to the point upon entering the shop.  

The shop was larger than the artifact store, with two other Qi Refining assistants besides Qiu Tan, all at the first or second level.  

The offered price for spirit rice was higher than Li Shiming had expected.  

In the sect, one merit point could be exchanged for ten pounds of spirit rice. If merit points were converted to spirit stones, one point would equal ten stones.
