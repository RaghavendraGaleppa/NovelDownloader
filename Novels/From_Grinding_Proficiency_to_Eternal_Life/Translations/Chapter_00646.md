# Chapter 646: The Sovereign of the Northern Plains

Locke Mann buried his head deeply at this moment.

Xu Yunfan's actions just now had filled his heart with terror.

This fellow seemed to have affected everyone's perception, silently and soundlessly devouring all the gods on the battlefield except for him and Buthus.

And he still claimed he wasn't a demon from beyond the heavens.

Looking at Xu Yunfan, who stood empty in the air clad in a cyan Daoist robe, a bone-chilling coldness instantly froze Buthus's entire body.

Even Locke Mann had been completely controlled?!

Just what kind of existence was this foreign demon from another realm?!

Could the opponent's strength not already be that of a main god?

But if he were a main god, why would he hide his head and tail like this?

"Want to leave?"

Xu Yunfan's figure had already appeared silently at the core of the array, facing Buthus from afar.

There was no expression on his face, only those deep eyes carrying a scrutinizing gaze.

"Too late."

Before the words had fully fallen, Xu Yunfan held nothing back.

The Thunder God Power used to disguise himself as Tathus instantly faded. A violent, pure, and immense spiritual power, completely different from the heaven and earth of this world, erupted with a bang. It then seemed to swallow the eight desolations and six harmonies, absorbing immeasurable essence and energy.

"Nine Ministers of the Divine Dawn, heed my command!"

Xu Yunfan's hand seals changed like phantoms.

In an instant, the rolling leaden clouds above his head were torn apart by an invisible force, revealing the purple sky curtain shrouded by the Heavenly Cosmic Locking World Array.

Above the sky curtain, immeasurable thunder was born in response.

The cumulonimbus clouds in the sky curtain were no longer just single blue-white arcs of lightning dancing.

The purple-gold Destruction Divine Thunder danced like furious dragons, capable of shattering all laws. The cyan-green Wood Positive Thunder contained the vitality of generation and restraint, specifically eroding the origin of Wind God Power. The ink-black葵Water Yin Thunder spread silently, slowing the wind speed.

The blood-red Fire Yang Thunder burned the sky and boiled the sea. The thick Earth Divine Thunder condensed into a hammer of billions of tons, crashing down with a bang.

There were even threads of Devouring Heaven Divine Thunder that twisted karma and directly targeted the core of the divine spark, silently mixing among them...

Billions of thunders, with different attributes, were perfectly commanded under the true meaning of the Divine Dawn Celestial Vault's Immortality, forming a torrent of thunder that drowned Buthus.

This was no longer natural thunder generated in the world of Aeterra. This was the Divine Dawn Heaven's Might, summoned by Xu Yunfan, who was nearing the perfection of the Foundation Establishment realm, by activating the *True Scripture of the Nine Ministers of the Divine Dawn Celestial Vault's Immortality*. It was born for destruction.

This technique was researched by Zhang Ziyang for a long time based on the characteristics of this world's divine sparks, specifically tailored for Xu Yunfan.

After all, Xu Yunfan was proficient in the Divine Dawn Myriad Thunders method. With various combinations, it could target the Qi of all things in heaven and earth.

It was naturally easy.

"Foreign demon! You!"

Buthus roared, knowing that if he didn't fight with his life on the line, his fate would be to be instantly drowned in the deafening thunderstorm.

His body flared with green light, and endless罡winds transformed into billions of wind-blade tornadoes, roaring as they迎向 the sea of thunder.

Wind and thunder, two violent natural forces, collided and annihilated each other frantically within the narrow space of the array.

But as soon as they made contact, the wind blades quickly dissipated.

Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle!

As soon as the wind-blade tornadoes touched the purple-gold Divine Thunder, they were forcibly shattered by the Destruction True Meaning contained within them.

The cyan-green Wood Positive Thunder was like maggots附骨, drilling into the gaps along the Wind God Power, frantically absorbing and assimilating Buthus's divine power origin, making his movements sluggish.

The black葵Water Yin Thunder froze the space around him, greatly reducing his proud Wind Speed.

The red Fire Yang Thunder burned the wind and breath, scorching his divine body and leaving blackened marks.

The heavy pressure of the Earth Divine Thunder made it even more difficult for him to move.

What frightened Buthus the most was the Devouring Heaven Divine Thunder. They ignored the obstruction of the wind barrier, as if they could predict every gap in Buthus's divine power operation, precisely striking at the weakest moment of his divine spark's defense. Each strike shook his divine soul and made his divine spark tremble violently.

Buthus's heart was filled with惊涛骇浪.

The opponent's control over thunder far exceeded Tathus's understanding of the Way of Thunder.

The opponent's authority should not have been endowed with so much thunder power. The Thunder God's Might that could shake people's hearts was Tathus's authority, but it had completely changed in Xu Yunfan's hands.

His proud authority of the gale was constrained everywhere and retreated step by step before this all-encompassing, attribute-restraining, and Destruction-origin-containing Divine Dawn Thunder.

In just a few breaths, Buthus's storm domain was compressed to within a few丈 of his body surface.

His divine power poured out like a flood from an opened gate. His divine body was covered in thunder marks, its green brilliance dimmed, and his aura visibly withered.

"Seal!"

Just as Buthus's divine power was about to dry up and his divine spark core was exposed, a cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. He took a step and shattered the void, his figure suddenly appearing before Buthus.

The palm, entwined with purple-gold thunder patterns, ignored the last wind barrier and pressed onto the core of Buthus's storm divine body.

A violently trembling green rhombic divine spark.

"洞Ming蚀Heaven Talisman, Suppress."

Hum!

Countless dark talismans, finer than hair and constantly twisting and writhing, gushed out from Xu Yunfan's fingertips. Like billions of living poisonous insects, they instantly钻入 Buthus's divine spark.

Buthus let out a shrill, inhuman shriek. His storm body twisted and expanded violently, then suddenly contracted, enduring indescribable pain.

He could clearly feel that his life and death were now completely in the palm of this foreign demon before him.

As long as the opponent willed it, these蚀Heaven Talismans would instantly detonate, completely annihilating his existence along the karmic line.

Gods have long lifespans and were naturally unwilling to die like this. The moment Xu Yunfan took control of him, Buthus completely gave up his resistance.

The violent storm around his body instantly subsided, and the green brilliance completely faded, revealing a humanoid phantom composed of pure wind elements, yet appearing incredibly feeble. This was his true divine form.

The phantom floated powerlessly in the air, its face filled with humiliation, fear, and an unbelievable confusion.

Xu Yunfan slowly withdrew his hand, his fingers gently raised, carefully sensing the karmic aura transmitted from Buthus's body, confirming that the restriction was perfectly imprinted.

He did not refine Buthus and absorb him into the Star Spirit Banner immediately.

A living and completely controlled upper god was far more valuable than a banner spirit at the late Foundation Establishment level.

Especially at the current stage.

With the three upper gods of the凛Winter Northern Plains, as long as they were used properly, they could completely start a true divine war.

"From this moment on, the fierce winds of the Northern Plains must blow according to my will."

Xu Yunfan's voice was flat.

"Buthus, if you want to live, put away your petty schemes."

Upon hearing this, Buthus tightly pursed his lips. Even if a main god were present, he had never suffered such humiliation.

But under the deadly threat transmitted by the蚀Heaven Restriction, he suppressed the humiliation and hatred in his heart. Just like Locke Mann before him, he slowly lowered his proud head before Xu Yunfan.

The dignity of the God of the Gale was fragile in the face of life and death.

"I shall reverently... obey the尊上's command."

Buthus's voice was hoarse and dry, like sandpaper rubbing, filled with a deep sense of powerlessness.
