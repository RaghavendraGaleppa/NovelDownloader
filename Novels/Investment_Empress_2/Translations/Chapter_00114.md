# Chapter 114: Little Bao Becomes Enlightened, Li Mo Might Become the Fastest Xuan Dan Cultivator in History

Atop the Cauldron Peak.

Roars of tigers and dragons echoed between heaven and earth, audible to everyone on the mountain.

"Judging by the phenomenon, Elder Xue's alchemy skills must have advanced again."
"He can't be refining a Fourth Grade Treasure Pill, can he? That would make him a Master Alchemist."
"He's even released his Field. The pill he's refining must be extraordinary."

Disciples and stewards gathered everywhere, discussing in whispers, all filled with curiosity.

Floating Prison looked at the dragon and tiger phenomena atop the peak, deep in thought.

"Steward Floating Prison, your Green Snake Blood Essence Pill is ready."

A male true disciple in a white robe presented a wooden box.

Floating Prison took it and asked, "Do you know what pill Elder Xue is refining today?"

"I don't know either."

The male disciple smacked his lips helplessly. "Every time the Master takes Little Bao to refine pills, he doesn't let us watch."

"I see."

Floating Prison nodded and turned toward the Rare Beast Peak.

***

At the peak.

Vicious flames leaped within the cauldron, dancing like the steps of a demon.

Li Mo wore the Illusory Light Silk Robe, his face flushed red by the firelight. On his body, an even deeper flame flickered, darker than the fire in the cauldron.

Compared to the furnace fire, the internal energy he produced was minuscule in volume, but far superior in quality.

"Elder Xue, I'm fine."

Little Li indicated he could handle even more intensity.

Xue Jing narrowed his eyes, observing Li Mo's slightly reddened skin. Just like Tang Xiaobao, he seemed unharmed. While sighing in relief, Xue Jing was inwardly astonished.

This wasn't something achievable merely by possessing a tempered body.

Even the blacksmiths from the Divine Weapon Peak wouldn't be able to withstand such high temperatures.

"Then this old man will raise the furnace temperature next."
"Remember, do not stop circulating your energy."
"Alright!"

Xue Jing formed a hand seal.

The dragon and tiger coiled atop the cauldron actually began to move slowly, as if they had come to life.

The temperature rose again.

"Li Shidi," Tang Xiaobao spoke beside him.
"Hm?"
"If you really can't control it and get burned later, just lick me a couple of times."
"......"

Li Mo looked at his serious little face and found it hard to bring himself to do it.

"No one has ever entered the cauldron with me before."

Tang Xiaobao looked moved. "If your method works and we circulate our energy together later, I'll have a chance to open my acupoints. Being licked by you is nothing."
"This... is the bond between us!"
"......Alright, I understand."

Li Mo didn't know how to refuse.

Because for some reason, it felt strangely exciting...

"Let's circulate our energy."
"Okay!"

Tang Xiaobao practiced the alchemy method.

Li Mo also closed his eyes and practiced.

He operated the *Karma Fire Red Lotus Mystical Method* with all his might, making his entire body look like a团 fire.

The Golden Crow Blood hidden in his waist began to boil, adding fuel to the fire.

The temperature inside the furnace didn't rise.

But with his internal energy mixed in, the color of the fire became noticeably deeper.

The herbs Xue Jing just threw in were refined, and the extracted essence became even purer.

Seeing that neither of them was hurt and they were actually complementing each other,

Xue Jing took a Clear Heart Pill given by Li Mo and waited for the herbs to be refined.

This was only the first step.

More than half an hour passed.

The marinating... or rather, the even distribution of medicinal power ended.

The golden luster on Tang Xiaobao's body was brighter than last time. He opened his sparkling eyes and said happily, "Master, Li Shidi, I feel so comfortable."
"Hoo... It is a bit uncomfortable."

Li Mo was fine, but the heat was real. He felt like he was burning up.

But the effect was truly excellent.

The Golden Crow Blood hidden in his body had been almost completely refined.

The lotus in his Dantian slowly bloomed another petal.

"I'm moving to the next step," Xue Jing said solemnly.
"Okay!"

Elder Xue gave him a long time to adapt.

Having gained experience from refining the herbs earlier, Li Mo knew how to use his internal energy to cooperate with the Dragon Tiger Cauldron.
"Good!"

***

A bucket of Black Evil Wood Oil was added.

It was added for about... ten seconds?

The temperature immediately rose significantly.

Li Mo frowned.
"Is something uncomfortable?" Xue Jing asked immediately.
"......Promise me, Elder Xue, if Ying Bing comes to you for ingredients next time, don't give them to her."
"......"

Xue Jing was stunned.

What? He never gave ingredients.

Ying Bing did come once and asked if Black Evil Wood Oil was edible. Who could have thought she was going to use it for cooking?

Well, as long as Li Mo is fine...

The opportunity was fleeting.

Next was fusion, the most crucial step in alchemy.

"Come on!" Tang Xiaobao shouted solemnly.
"I'm ready!" Li Mo's expression was equally serious.

*BOOM—*

The temperature skyrocketed.

At close range, he smelled the pill fragrance again, but this time it was ten or a hundred times stronger. It made one feel as if they would ascend to immortality just by smelling it.

Tang Xiaobao was enveloped by various purified medicinal powers.

These medicinal powers churned and surged, slowly merging into his body along with the flames mixed with Li Mo's internal energy.

Under the scorching of the flames, he looked like a little golden boy cast from pure gold.

What surprised Li Mo was that the Karma Fire didn't cause Tang Xiaobao any discomfort.

Perhaps...

The Karma Fire only has that extreme, destructive lethality towards wicked beings?

But Li Mo still didn't dare to be careless. The perception honed by Shang Wu still closely monitored the changes in his internal energy.

"Hoo..."

At the same time, Li Mo also worked hard to maintain the circulation of the *Karma Fire Red Lotus Mystical Method*.

Finally...

Here it comes!

Various lights surged on Tang Xiaobao's body, surrounded by the golden light of the dragon and tiger.

His small body gradually dissolved, or rather, was absorbed by his heart.

Li Mo finally saw it clearly.

That was Little Bao's true form.

A Golden Dan, flowing with Dao Rhymes, displaying myriad phenomena, and incredibly magnificent!

There were seven apertures on the Golden Dan.

And at this moment, one of them was slowly opening under the fusion of various medicinal powers.

"Master, need a bit more effort!"

The Golden Dan vibrated slightly, emitting Tang Xiaobao's anxious voice.

Xue Jing was ultimately not a Master Alchemist.

He had already given his all.

He could only watch helplessly as the eighth aperture, which had already opened a crack, began to slowly close again.

"I'll do it!"

The flames crackled loudly.

It was none other than our best chef of the Autumn Water Pavilion, the first Hotpot King of the Purple Sun Mansion—Chef Li!

He pushed the初熟 (Early Ripe) stage of the *Karma Fire Red Lotus Mystical Method* to its limit.

Is this a martial art?

No, this is the hundreds of years of insight he poured into it!

The single petal of the lotus in his Dantian swayed, plus he had consumed another drop of Golden Crow Blood just moments ago.

*Damn, let it burn!*

*BOOM—*

The lid of the cauldron spun into the air once again.

The roaring dragon and tiger phenomena became even more realistic at this moment.

"Did... did it work?"

Xue Jing sat on the ground, dumbfounded, staring at the cauldron.

However, the phenomenon was too violent, exceeding the control of his Field.

"Xiao Bao!"
"Xiao Mo!"

He called out twice.

A few seconds later, a reply came from inside.

"Master, I've achieved Xuan Dan!" Tang Xiaobao's delighted voice came through.

This meant he had opened another aperture.

He was one step closer to the true Nine-Aperture Golden Dan.

But before Xue Jing could celebrate in ecstasy,

Li Mo's confused voice came through:

"Uh... Elder Xue, it seems I've also become a Xuan Dan..."
"No, wait..."
"Little Bao Shixiong has become *my* Xuan Dan?!"

Xue Jing: "?"

What the hell?

***

P.S.: Little Bao Shixiong has no gender.
