Chapter 150: The Second-Realm Martial Artist, Dissolved by Water

Li Xian walked with the Clear Wind Legs, his steps making no sound. He opened his Heavy Pupils, taking in every detail of his surroundings.

"The Leopard Blade Sect occupies such a large piece of land in the county; their financial power is truly formidable."

Li Xian entered through a side door. He searched for Xu Liefeng's location, focusing his gaze as his vision gradually penetrated the walls.

Before long, he passed a house and caught a faint stench. Li Xian could ensure his walking was silent and his tracks hidden, but pushing the door open would inevitably cause noise.

Not daring to push the door and investigate, he relied on the power of his Heavy Pupils to observe through the wall. He saw a body lying inside, already swarmed by flies, its head severed.

However, there was no blood around it.

"This man's head was taken, and his blood was sucked dry. It must be Xu Liefeng's doing. He is truly ruthless, able to treat his own disciples so cruelly. If I fail, my fate will likely be even worse."

Li Xian became even more cautious, narrowing his eyes. Having made his decision, he would not hesitate. He hugged the wall and moved, guessing that Xu Liefeng's bedroom should be to the east.

He explored his way there. Finding the bedroom, he prepared to launch a sneak attack, only to find the room empty. The furniture and wooden chairs were covered in dust, indicating he had not been there for a long time.

Though disappointed, Li Xian did not let his guard down. He searched room by room. Finally, he faintly heard breathing and smelled the scent of blood.

In one room, he found Xu Liefeng. He was sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, meditating. Red mist enveloped his body, and his black robe rustled like a banner.

Due to his missing limbs, he looked somewhat comical.

Li Xian looked through the wall. Unlike the Madam, Xu Liefeng had not sensed him at all.

"He really fell for the trap. He absolutely wouldn't expect me to come for him tonight. He's currently focused on his closed-door training," Li Xian thought, delighted.

He took out a fragrant paste from his怀里. It could relax the mind and drain one's strength. He lit the paste and placed it outside the door. He then gently kicked it.

The kick from Clear Wind Legs created a breeze, blowing the strange fragrance toward Xu Liefeng. The essence of Clear Wind Legs is to make the wind seem natural, making it hard to detect. The wind he kicked out was just like a natural breeze.

Li Xian slowly circled to the back of the house to continue his observation. He needed to know the enemy as well as himself to win a hundred battles.

He saw Xu Liefeng's strange appearance, with fine, beard-like growths on his face. This was a characteristic of the Red Fungus Ginseng spreading throughout his body, emerging from under his skin.

Li Xian thought to himself, "This man has become a monster and has touched the Second Realm of martial arts. If I fight him, I must be extremely careful."

He waited quietly for half an hour.

The strange fragrance spread, its invisible medicinal effect seeping in. Seeing the time was ripe, Li Xian immediately drew his bow and shot at Xu Liefeng's head. The arrow was filled with pure killing intent, aiming for a one-shot kill.

Xu Liefeng's ears twitched, hearing the sound of the bowstring. He immediately threw himself forward. Just then, the spot where he had been meditating exploded into dust with a loud bang.

A thin arrow was stuck in the ground.

Such immense force could only be Li Xian's!

"You brat, you dare to sneak attack!" Xu Liefeng cursed in anger. Seeing the arrow had missed, Li Xian directly broke through the wall and thrust his sword at Xu Liefeng's chest.

Li Xian's plan was originally flawless.

The strange fragrance was purchased at a high price; first, it would relax the spirit and drain strength, followed by the arrow shot through the wall, hiding the killing intent.

But no one expected that the medicinal effect of the fragrance needed blood to transport it. Xu Liefeng had long had no blood, so no matter how long the fragrance burned, it was useless to him.

That was why Xu Liefeng avoided the fatal arrow. Although Li Xian's plan had failed, he remained calm and had left himself a way out. This sword strike was already at the enemy's chest.

Although Xu Liefeng avoided the fatal blow, he was caught off guard, shocked and furious. By the time he tried to defend, it was too late!

This sword shone with a golden light. It was called "Setting Sun Breaking Dawn," a very powerful killing move from the first level of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword.

It focused on "speed" and "fury." The sword carried golden light, tearing through the darkness. This strike did succeed, piercing Xu Liefeng's chest.

Xu Liefeng roared, "Brat, die!" and raised his palm to strike Li Xian. Li Xian was already prepared. He abandoned his sword and ran, fleeing the Leopard Blade Sect.

Xu Liefeng pulled the sword out. He felt a strong Yang energy eroding his body, causing severe injury. An ordinary person hit by this move would surely die.

But he cultivated the "Blood Rakshasa Art," an extremely powerful and evil technique. The more one cultivated it, the more one's internal organs would change and distort. After taking the "Red Fungus Ginseng," Xu Liefeng no longer relied on the function of his internal organs.

This sword pierced his body and burned his lungs, but it wasn't enough to kill him. He immediately gave chase.

His lightness skill was outstanding, but one of his legs had been cut off. This was an undeniable disadvantage. Although he still had the foundation of his lightness skill, his speed was no longer what it used to be.

Li Xian ran ahead, and Xu Liefeng chased from behind: "Brat, do you dare fight me fairly!"

"Okay, old thief, I'll wait for you here!"

Unknowingly, they arrived at the side of Qingning Lake. The name "Qingning" in Qingning County came entirely from "Qingning Lake."

Qingning Lake was vast, like a blue sea. The scenery was first-class, and many martial arts masters and literati came here to enjoy the lake.

By the shore, a small boat was already prepared. Li Xian jumped onto the boat, used his internal energy to row the oar, and quickly left the shore.

Li Xian had already planned his route. If the first plan failed, he would use the second. He would lead the enemy into the lake to fight, where he would have the absolute advantage. If things went badly, he could rely on the Green Water Pearl to escape.

"Damn it!" Xu Liefeng was furious and looked around. He saw several stone lions by the lakeside. He turned his left hand into a claw and grabbed at the stone lion.

Although the stone lion had been weathered and eroded, it was still stone and extremely hard. But Xu Liefeng's claw was even more powerful. He struck several times, grinding the stone lion into rubble.

He let out a cold laugh.

He wrapped the rubble into his sleeve and said, "Brat, watch my blade!" He flicked his sleeve. Countless pieces of rubble shot out, wrapped in internal energy, actually forming a large blade.

Xu Liefeng's body was incomplete, so many martial arts techniques could not be used. But the clever use of this "Sleeve Blade" was truly astonishing.

Li Xian put away his long bow. He stomped hard on the boat's plank. With a bang, lake water splashed up. Li Xian pushed both palms forward, silently reciting in his heart: "Green Waves Towering to the Sky!"

His internal energy surged, and the "Green Silk Palm" was pushed to its limit. The palm force, carrying the lake water, crashed into the rubble blade like a stormy wave.

In that instant, it consumed over a hundred feet of internal energy!

One thing truly conquers another. If it were a real blade, it would be easy to cut through water. But these were tiny pebbles. Although the range was larger, making it hard to dodge, hitting the water waves instantly dissipated eight-tenths of the force.

"Arrgh!" Xu Liefeng roared in anger. He hopped on one leg to another stone lion. His claws struck out, grinding the stone lion into countless pieces of rubble, which he wrapped in his sleeve.

He flicked his sleeve again, sending flying sand and stones, its momentum like a giant blade. Li Xian used the same trick again, using the Green Wave Palm to stir up a terrifying wave.

The battle was grand in scale, but no one saw it. Xu Liefeng, unable to take down Li Xian, felt both shock and fear, growing anxious. Suddenly, he saw another boat on the shore not far away.

His face lit up with wild joy, and he immediately jumped onto the boat and rowed to give chase. Li Xian steered his boat, swimming to the depths of the lake.

Xu Liefeng紧追而来... His clothes were loose, and his right sleeve hung long. He absorbed the lake water, then suddenly flicked his sleeve. Every flick was like swinging a water blade, making the lake surface choppy.

He had immersed himself in the martial way for decades. His martial arts moves were already flexible. For any bladesman, the arm is crucial. Losing an arm is a serious injury.

He used his sleeve as a blade, opening a new path. Every move and action showed his past blade skill. One could imagine that if his body were intact, his strength would be several times greater.

"Old thief, this chase is so boring. Do you dare fight me underwater!" Li Xian shouted loudly.

"Hahaha, brat, you are seeking your own death. How could I be afraid of you," Xu Liefeng's killing intent had risen.

Li Xian jumped into the lake. Xu Liefeng snorted coldly and followed immediately. The moment he entered the water, he sensed something was different.

His body was heavier than usual. His swimming skill was not bad, but no matter how he paddled, he moved a very short distance.

He could barely stop himself from sinking.

Moreover, the water flow was unpredictable. The more anxious he became, the more the current dragged him into the mud. He was filled with doubt: "What's going on? My swimming skill is not bad. Why has it become like this this time? Could it be... could it be that the brat has used some trick secretly?"

He struggled wildly, splashing water everywhere, barely managing to keep his head above water. He roared, "Brat, what did you do to me!?"

His voice was filled with panic and unease.

His voice was swallowed by the sound of water, vaguely carrying the sound of "gulping water." Li Xian climbed back onto the boat, his heart filled with shock: "The Madam was right. Who would have thought that a martial artist like this would be so afraid of water!"

Xu Liefeng knew he was in a dangerous situation and wanted to return to the boat. Among a hundred dangers, he pulled a thread from his black robe. He bit off a finger and wrapped the thread around it.

He threw the finger, nailing it to the deck of the boat.

"Got it!" Xu Liefeng was overjoyed and immediately pulled the thread, moving toward the wooden boat.

How could Li Xian let him go? He immediately drew his bow, aiming at that wooden boat. Xu Liefeng had run out of tricks and repeatedly begged, "Hero Li, Hero Li, spare me... spare me!"

Li Xian ignored him and shot an arrow. With a splashing sound, the wooden boat exploded into powder, completely cutting off Xu Liefeng's hope of survival.

Unwilling to die, he set his sights on the boat Li Xian was standing on. He immediately used his old trick again, tearing a thread from his clothes, biting off a finger, and throwing it to nail it to the deck of the boat.

Li Xian let out a cold laugh and stomped hard. With a cracking sound, the boat beneath his feet shattered into pieces.

It also sank into the lake.

Xu Liefeng's heart ached. The water surrounded his entire body. He had immense strength, but how could he push away the water? It was endless, surging in, pouring into his mouth and nose, filling his lungs.

Knowing he could not survive, his heart was filled with reluctance and regret. If he could start over, he would not provoke Li Xian. Even if he did, he should have killed him with thunderous force. But all this was just empty speculation; the outcome was already set.

He stared at Li Xian with a pair of eyes, gradually sinking to the bottom of the lake.

Soon, he stopped breathing.

After a dangerous battle, this great enemy was finally finished.

[You have killed the Leopard Blade Sect Leader, Xu Liefeng]

[Green Silk Palm Proficiency +596]

[Archery Proficiency +612]

[Clear Wind Legs Proficiency +458]

[You have fought a strong opponent, digested a trace of heaven and earth essence, Eating Essence Realm Proficiency +1]

The Second Realm of martial arts... actually has another nickname: "Mud Bodhisattva."

It means "dissolved by water." This is its number one weakness. If this weakness is grasped, even a mud statue, an ordinary person, has a slight chance of killing a Second-Realm martial artist.

However, this is a secret and is never passed on. Very few people know about it.

It is entirely because martial artists have a tacit agreement to never reveal half of it, keeping their weaknesses out of the sunlight. And Xu Liefeng, having just come into contact with the Second Realm of martial arts, did not yet understand its secrets.

In a daze, he jumped into the water and drowned right there.

Li Xian climbed onto the shore, feeling relaxed all over. Looking at the moon disk in the sky, he sighed, "The martial way has too many secrets. I still need to learn well from the Madam."

"A martial artist of the Second Realm, how could he not even know how to swim? If this got out, I'm afraid even a three-year-old child wouldn't believe it."

All's well that ends well.

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword, Proficiency +1]

Li Xian used the "Scorching Wave" characteristic to perform a set of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword. He dried his clothes and went to the Leopard Blade Sect's location.

The Leopard Blade Sect still had two disciples left. Hearing the commotion, they came out to investigate. Seeing the horrifying bodies of their martial brothers, they were scared and ran away.

"I wonder if Xu Liefeng had any treasured items," Li Xian thought, his eyes shining.
