# Chapter 4: The Soaring Sky Talisman! Brother Han, You've Been Scammed!

"You've got a sharp eye!" Lin Yun was ecstatic internally, though his expression remained unchanged. "Han Li, you're truly my lucky star!"

"What a dear brother from another mother you are, my best friend!"

Had it been anyone else standing beside Lin Yun instead of Han Li, he might not have gained any rewards at all—since those were common knowledge that wouldn't make a difference whether he mentioned them or not. But fate had placed the newly initiated Han Li by his side!

Just those five top-grade spirit stones alone were worth a staggering five million spirit stones! 

This was the very definition of overnight wealth! 

Lin Yun would never reveal his possession of top-grade spirit stones, lest he attract the pursuit of every cultivator across the Tiannan region.

"Truly remarkable treasures," Han Li thought with envy. "But alas, I don't even have half a spirit stone to my name. Brother Lin, as a seasoned cultivator, must have some. I wonder what they look like..."

Shaking off his thoughts, Han Li cheered himself up: "Don't worry, Han Li. You'll have spirit stones soon too!"

The two soon stopped at a talisman stall displaying various spiritual charms like "Thunderfire Talisman," "Fire Dragon Talisman," and "Herculean Strength Talisman," which greatly intrigued Han Li. However, lacking any spirit stones, he could only sigh and move to the next stall.

"Seems I'm truly a pauper in the cultivation world," Han Li mocked himself inwardly. He absentmindedly touched his belongings and suddenly remembered the talisman with a small sword design tucked in his robe. Though he didn't know its name, he was certain it must be valuable.

Thus, Han Li began scanning the stalls for similar talismans. However, treasures like his Talisman Treasure were rare even among Foundation Establishment cultivators, let alone Qi Condensation ones—no one would sell such an item at the Tai Nan gathering.

His gaze soon landed on a crowd gathered around a particular stall. Lin Yun followed his line of sight and recognized it immediately—this was where Han Li would trade his pills for the "Soaring Sky Talisman."

---

Han Li had rarely been swindled in his cultivation journey, but this time, he was truly duped. 

The Soaring Sky Talisman was priced at thirty spirit stones, which Han Li eventually exchanged for five bottles of pills—twenty-five pills in total. While ordinary Yellow Dragon Pills or Golden Marrow Pills might be worth one spirit stone each, Han Li's pills were made from high-grade ingredients with exceptional potency. 

Given the upcoming Ascension Tournament, many cultivators were stuck at bottlenecks. Han Li's pills could significantly boost their chances of breaking through and winning a Foundation Establishment Pill—an irresistible temptation.

The stall's sign read: "Soaring Sky Talisman—Wind-attribute, high-grade primary flight talisman. Price: 30 low-grade spirit stones or equivalent foundational cultivation pills."

Han Li was stunned—this was the first high-grade primary talisman he'd seen. Even the mid-grade "Vajra Talisman" had piqued his interest earlier, let alone this one. 

The talisman's dense spiritual energy tempted him, but he hesitated, glancing at Lin Yun. Without spirit stones, he'd have to use his pills, potentially exposing his secret. 

As he deliberated, a barefooted, horse-faced man angrily stormed off after a failed negotiation: "Remember this, kid! I, Ye Bao of Qin Ye Ridge, will settle this with you after the tournament!"

The crowd dispersed after their offers were rejected, leaving the stall deserted. Seeing his chance, Han Li decided to act. Though cautious, he was no coward—his boldness in trading millennium spirit herbs at Qi Condensation or snatching the Void Heaven Cauldron under Nascent Soul cultivators' noses proved that. 

With the Soaring Sky Talisman, even if his pill secret was exposed, he could escape if needed. The stall owner was only at Qi Condensation tenth layer, while Han Li was nearing the ninth. 

Approaching the young vendor, Han Li smiled and produced two small bottles: "I have two types of pills. Would they meet your requirements?"

The vendor sniffed the bottles pensively before setting them down. "They're slightly better than previous offers, but still insufficient."

Disappointed but unsurprised—since his pills were merely mortal-grade—Han Li reached to retrieve them.

"However," the vendor suddenly added, feigning reluctance, "if you had a few more bottles, I might consider trading."

Han Li's hand paused. "Who said I only have these?" he replied slyly.

"You have more?" The vendor pretended surprise.

After haggling, Han Li agreed to three more bottles, with the vendor throwing in a tattered spellbook and some talisman paper as compensation.

Just as the deal was about to close, Lin Yun intervened: "Brother Han, wait!"

The vendor, desperate for the high-quality pills, glared at Lin Yun. "What do you want?!"

Han Li looked at Lin Yun curiously.

"Thank the heavens I accompanied you, Brother Han," Lin Yun said coldly. "Otherwise, you'd have been swindled out of dozens of spirit stones!"

Han Li's heart skipped a beat—dozens of spirit stones?! He didn't even have one to his name!
