# Chapter 128: The Matriarch’s Prestige, Intimidating All Sides

“Brat, how dare you act so arrogant!”

Li Xian pursued his victory, his blade moving like the wind, its net of light weaving densely. Wang Bao could no longer defend himself, his movements sluggish as he swung his weapon. Li Xian reversed his blade, aiming to sever the man’s wrist.

Just then, a loud, bear-like roar shattered the air. A figure shot out with incredible speed, arriving before Li Xian in the blink of an eye.

Grabbing Wang Bao by the back of the neck, the newcomer tossed him out of danger. He then let out a cold snort and struck a palm toward Li Xian’s face.

Although the man used his hand, his mastery of the blade was undoubtedly exceptional. This palm strike cleverly bypassed all of Li Xian’s blade trajectories. It seemed ordinary, yet it contained boundless killing power and was exquisitely profound.

‘What a palm strike!’ Li Xian thought, showing no fear. He channe his Internal Qi and met the attack with his left palm.

The two palms met, producing a low, humming sound.

A moment later, Li Xian took three steps back. Each step shattered the stone tiles beneath his feet, sinking seven-tenths of an inch into the earth, leaving his boots covered in dust.

He had channe the palm force into the ground to mitigate the damage. The other man stood his ground, but his expression was incredibly strange.

This was none other than the Sect Master of the Leopard Blade Sect, the Leopard Blade, Xu Liefeng.

He had heard that his sect’s disciples were fighting in the streets. For martial artists, clashing with others was a common occurrence, and he hadn’t paid it much mind.

However, the fight had escalated, and even Wang Bao had been sent out. Fearing that things might get out of hand, he had secretly followed.

When he saw Wang Bao kick up bricks as a feint and use the dust cloud to fight, Xu Liefeng had nodded in approval. ‘My apprentice is cautious and not careless. Using the dust to obscure vision means this victory is all but assured!’

Feeling reassured, he had stroked his beard with a smile.

But moments later, he heard the密集 sound of a blade, its paths weaving a net. Xu Liefeng’s heart skipped a beat. ‘My Golden Leopard Swift Blade is fast in its swinging, not in its drawing. The sound I hear—dozens of slashes in a single breath—could not possibly be from Bao’er!’

The next instant, he saw the dust cloud get slashed apart.

Countless blade shadows appeared before his eyes. Wang Bao was completely overwhelmed and on the verge of death. Xu Liefeng, greatly alarmed, forcefully entered the fray to save him.

Seeing his disciple turned into a bloody mess, Xu Liefeng was filled with grief and rage. He disregarded the notoriety of bullying the young and weak with his superior age and strength. He immediately struck with a palm.

Although he used only a tenth of his power, he believed it was more than enough to capture the boy, publicly humiliate him, and display the might of the Leopard Blade Sect.

He never expected that, despite his youth, the boy’s Internal Qi cultivation was truly formidable.

After the palm exchange, Xu Liefeng looked at his palm.

A faint purple-black mark had appeared on his palm. Although he had gained the upper hand in the exchange, Li Xian’s palm force was chillingly cold and seeped into every opening.

It had trickled into his palm, stagnating within.

‘What a refined application of palm technique. It is no冤 for my apprentice to lose to him. Even ten more fights would not be this boy’s match,’ Xu Liefeng thought.

Li Xian shuddered, channeling the remaining force into the ground. The surrounding blue bricks cracked with a ‘clatter,’ shattering into pieces.

“Brat, let’s see you take another palm!” Having already made his move, Xu Liefeng was now unscrupulous.

Li Xian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He abandoned his blade for a sword, and the [Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword] was poised to strike.

He did not fear a powerful enemy, and prepared to应对 with all his might.

[Facing a powerful opponent head-on, your sword intent is fierce. Proficiency +21]

Xu Liefeng was taken aback, then his eyes filled with greed. ‘A high-level martial art! This brat has a high-level martial art!’

He had intended to kill Li Xian with one palm, but now he changed his move to a capture.

In the Great Martial Empire, martial arts were precious.

Cultivating a powerful martial art could even change the world. Basic martial arts could nourish Internal Qi. If an ordinary person practiced one and achieved a bit of skill, nurturing a thread of Qi, they could stand out from the crowd.

And that was just for basic martial arts…

What more need be said of high-level ones?

Xu Liefeng completely forgot his grief, his hands grabbing for Li Xian’s shoulders. Li Xian calmly应对ted, circulating his Internal Qi, his entire body becoming scorching hot like a furnace.

The moment he unleashed his sword, a wave of heat washed over the crowd.

The commoners backed away, fearing they would be caught in the heat.

“Hold!”

At that moment, a voice rang out.

The County Magistrate of Qingning County, Lin Guolong, arrived with county soldiers and constables. Ding Hu was also by his side.

Seeing the situation, Xu Liefeng thought that the boy was right in front of him and wouldn’t get far, so there was no need to rush. He retreated a few steps and frowned. “Lin Guolong, you dare to oppose this old man?! This boy injured my disciple, how can I let him go!”

“You are engaging in a martial duel. Casualties are to be expected. Both parties are at fault. Let this be the end of it!” Lin Guolong declared loudly.

He was short in stature, with fair skin and an air of affluence.

Xu Liefeng sneered. “If it’s a martial duel, what business is it of a County Magistrate? Get out of the way!”

“You have an official title, but you lack the support of fortune. It’s not easy for me to deal with you, but what if I kill a few of your subordinates? What could you do about it?”

A chilling aura emanated from him.

Many county soldiers took a step back, their eyes filled with fear. For an official without the support of fortune, it is difficult to command respect.

Lin Guolong was furious at being so looked down upon. “If it’s a martial duel, isn’t your behavior of bullying the young with your age something to be ashamed of in the martial world!”

Xu Liefeng clasped his hands behind his back and said arrogantly, “I have been practicing martial arts for decades. What insults have I not heard? If the martial world wants to curse me, let them. Today, this boy… I am taking him, no matter what!”

Lin Guolong sneered. “You are quite bold. But what if…”

“What if you faced the Sword-Breaking Matriarch? Could you still be this bold?!”

“What? The Sword-Breaking Matriarch?!” Xu Liefeng’s legs went weak, and his greed significantly diminished. “Don’t you try to intimidate me with her name. What does this have to do with her?”

Lin Guolong said, “I might as well tell you, the martial artist in the One-Union Manor is none other than the Sword-Breaking Matriarch.”

“The guards you have injured are all her people.”

“Consider carefully whether you would rather be flayed and have your tongue cut out by the Sword-Breaking Matriarch, or let this matter rest.”

A wave of cold water seemed to douse Xu Liefeng, and he showed a hesitant expression. If it were truly the Sword-Breaking Matriarch, then… a high-level martial art, he could not afford to provoke her.

Lin Guolong said, “Brother Li, the martial art you displayed earlier was quite formidable.”

Li Xian cupped his fists. “Thanks to the Matriarch’s favor, she thought highly of me and taught me this martial art. Hero of the Leopard Blade Sect, if you wish to learn it, why be so sneaky about it?”

“Why not come with me to the manor and ask the Matriarch for guidance? The Matriarch is very reasonable. If you are willing to ask, she might not refuse to teach you.”

Xu Liefeng’s expression wavered.

He thought, ‘I have walked the martial world for years and have never heard of the Matriarch teaching anyone a martial art. Could these two be deceiving me? If so, I could just seize it by force and obtain a high-level martial art.’

‘But if they are not lying, and I were to steal the Sword-Breaking Matriarch’s martial art, my fate would be grim, with no chance of survival. This is a huge gamble. No… I shouldn’t rush. I’ll observe for a while before making a move. A martial art is important, but my life is more so.’

Xu Liefeng’s mind raced.

Intimidated by the prestige of the [Sword-Breaking Matriarch], he had already lost the will to fight.

He flicked his sleeve, gave Li Xian a cold glare, and left.

Li Xian could not help but sigh:

“Who would have thought the Matriarch’s name would be so effective. Just moments ago, Xu Liefeng was full of greed, as if he wanted to devour me whole. But upon hearing the words [Sword-Breaking Matriarch], his eyes cleared in an instant.”

“This kind of reputation in the martial world is truly enviable, truly awe-inspiring. The [Sword-Breaking Matriarch] has many enemies, but her prestige is also deep.”

Li Xian smiled. “Thank you, Magistrate Lin, for your help.”

Lin Guolong looked at Li Xian with curiosity. He had originally thought Li Xian was just a pretty boy. Now that they had met, he found him to be quite extraordinary, with a demeanor that rivaled his own.

His gaze fell upon Li Xian’s forehead, and he asked in surprise, “You have manifested your Rebirth Phase?”

Li Xian replied, “Yes.”

Lin Guolong said, “You are also quite remarkable. Does the Matriarch know about this?”

Li Xian answered, “The Matriarch is in seclusion refining pills, so she is not yet aware that I have manifested my phase.”

“I see,” Lin Guolong remarked. “You and your brother have each achieved your own successes. You are young, and with the Matriarch’s support, you will soon enter the path of rebirth.”

“Now that you have manifested your phase, just by this point… you are too far ahead of others. Perhaps when the Matriarch emerges from seclusion, she will value you even more.”

He saw Li Xian’s handsome face. His eyes shifted. No matter how much one is reborn, one is still worldly. He was born into a great clan, without fortune, yet he secured the position of County Magistrate by leveraging his family’s influence.

Because of his family’s power, he had seen many martial artists who had undergone rebirth.

Rebirth was glorious, but it was still worldly. Wealth, lust, and power—these were the three things. Even martial artists had greater desires. An ordinary mud body, no matter how handsome, with flowers on its face, would not catch the eye of a martial artist.

Because it is a mud body, not a true form.

But if one washes for the [Rebirth Phase] and manifests the true form, then in the eyes of a martial artist, it would be different.

With a petty mind measuring a gentleman’s heart… the Matriarch might not be immune to lust. And this Li Xian’s “appearance” was already quite exceptional.

He had truly transcended his original class.

“Brother Li, we seem to be fated to meet.”

“It’s rare for us to meet. How about we go to the tavern together and have a drink?”

Lin Guolong stood on his toes and jumped to pat Li Xian’s shoulder.

Li Xian smiled. “Of course. It would be an honor to drink with the Magistrate.”

“Good, good, good,” Lin Guolong was greatly pleased. Neither Wen Caishang nor Xu Liefeng had ever given him a proper look. Even when they did, it was only at his official uniform.

And so.

The matter came to an end. Li Xian had Ding Hu lead the team, taking the guards back to the manor to rest.

He, on the other hand, went to the tavern with Lin Guolong.

The Red Candle Lane was bustling with activity.

The earlier duel had been extremely loud, and the tall tavern had allowed many onlookers to see it. Now, as Li Xian walked into the building, he immediately drew a crowd.

Everyone was respectful.

Men looked on with envy, while women’s eyes rippled with emotion, their gazes fixed on Li Xian’s face as they murmured, “A young hero, just like this.” Their hearts fluttered.

Among them were many young masters and ladies of the county.

They had no worries about food or clothing and held noble status.

They were once figures Li Xian could not hope to reach. Now, their positions had been completely reversed.

It was a sobering thought.

“Brother Li, you are far too handsome. This time, I don’t know how many young ladies’ hearts you have stolen,” Lin Guolong teased. “Have you thought about taking a wife and starting a family early?”

As they climbed the stairs, many women watched from afar, their gazes intense. The way they looked, they wished they could pounce on him immediately.

This inevitably made Lin Guolong jealous. As a County Magistrate, he had never enjoyed such treatment. Was his official uniform really inferior to youthful charm?

Soon after…

The two entered a private room. Lin Guolong knew how to enjoy himself, ordering a few beautiful women to knead his shoulders and back. He had food fed to him, utterly carefree.

The table was filled with delicacies, complete in color, aroma, and taste.

“Brother Li, please help yourself. Hehe, looking at you, I reckon you haven’t tasted the滋味 between a man and a woman yet. Today, this County Magistrate will…” Lin Guolong’s face suddenly stiffened, and he changed his tune. “But for you martial artists, it’s better not to get involved with beauty too early.”

In truth, there was no rule of abstinence for martial artists.

It was just that Lin Guolong thought of the Matriarch. Who knows if this boy is the Matriarch’s pre-selected lover. If he were to lead him astray, his own fate would be miserable.

Li Xian remembered something and said, “By the way, Magistrate Lin, there is something I must mention to you first.”
