# Chapter 329: Cleansing the Body with Profound Yellow Qi

With the true qi bursting from his fingertips, eighteen streams of earth-vein qi surged toward the heavens like giant dragons, tearing a hundred-mile-long rift through the purple clouds.

The thirty-five surrounding peaks, witnessing such peerless aura erupting from the summit of Qingwei Mountain, responded one by one. A green light shone from each peak, coiling around the mountain.

"Master Shen, we..."

Lu Jiuxiao on Qingming Peak cupped his fists and asked Shen Wuya for instructions.

Shen Wuya remained silent for a long time before finally sighing. "This is what he deserves."

Bi Yuan had gone to great lengths for this matter, forming alliances and secretly paying a huge price, conceding many interests. Shen Wuya could find no fault in his actions. If he did not cooperate now, it would undoubtedly leave a handle for others, making it difficult to command people in the future.

Upon hearing this, Lu Jiuxiao nodded slightly. With a single step, he entered the ritual platform set up on Qingming Peak. Treading the Dipper steps, he formed a Daoist seal with his hands, chanting incantations as he forcefully drew upon the ambient spiritual qi with his Gang qi, gathering it onto the gilded copper pillars ahead.

In an instant, a green light radiated out, shrouding the peak.

On a distant mountain, Chu Cangmiao watched this scene, his teeth nearly grinding to dust.

"How does he have such qualifications? How dare he..."

At that moment, Bi Yuan swept his sleeve, and the eighteen gilded copper pillars simultaneously blazed with piercing golden light. The spirit-conducting pearls atop the pillars erupted with brilliant pillars of light, shooting straight into the heavens.

In an instant, all thirty-six peaks of the Dao Sect trembled in unison.

At the summit of Yuxiao Peak, the headmaster, Xuanji Zhenren, his robes billowing, swept his horsetail whisk. The ritual platform beneath his feet lit up with a diagram of the celestial stars.

The spirit-conducting pearls atop the gilded copper pillars emitted a piercing silver glow. A brilliant pillar of light shot straight to the ninth heaven, interplaying with the green light of the main peak of Qingwei Mountain.

"The celestial stars, heed my command!"

The three grand elders chanted in unison, their voices like the tolling of a great bell.

In an instant, the sky, though not yet dark, manifested the phantom of the Big Dipper. The handle of the dipper pointed directly toward the location of the Imperial City of Yujing, a thousand miles away.

The *Profound Heavenly Treasure Register* in Bi Yuan's hands moved without wind. The crimson patterns on the ancient scroll writhed like living things, intertwining with the golden light of the copper pillars to form a net of talismans that blotted out the sky.

This Profound Heavenly Treasure Register was originally a treasure for drawing upon all kinds of spiritual qi. Now, at the final moment, it dissolved into specks of starlight, merging within and revealing its final, brilliant radiance.

"Boom!"

A deep tremor, like muffled thunder, came from deep within the earth-veins. The palpable shockwave rapidly spread toward the direction of the Yujing Imperial City.

Within Yujing City, the black-armored imperial guards guarding the Imperial City Department suddenly felt the blue bricks beneath their feet grow hot. The moat churned without wind. The "Kan-Li Turning Dragon Formation," which had lain dormant for a thousand years, was being forcefully activated!

The armillary sphere at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau spun frantically. The director, Guo Lang, stared tightly toward the direction of Qingwei Mountain, his face grim. "The Dao Sect is drawing the qi of the imperial city's dragon vein! How dare they?!"

The three grand elders had already formed a three-position array and were seated cross-legged.

The long-browed elder pointed two fingers like a sword toward the east, and a wisp of purple qi tore through the void from the land of the sunrise.

The one in the center formed the Zi-Wu seal with his hands, and a map of the mountains and rivers of the Great Zhou territory appeared on the black jade platform beneath his feet.

The white-haired old woman drew upon the spiritual qi surging wildly from beneath the earth-veins. A green aura suddenly churned around her, washing over her entire body like the spring river's tide.

The withered white hair visibly lost its frosty color, transforming from the roots to the tips into a torrent of flowing green silk. Wrinkled skin, as if smoothed by an invisible hand, revealed a lustrous, jade-like radiance. Her hunched spine slowly straightened, and the sound of thunder from sinews and bones echoed from within her Daoist robes.

When the green aura dissipated, the withered old woman was gone.

A peerless beauty with features as if painted sat cross-legged in her place. Her almond-shaped eyes contained stars, her lips were as if painted with vermilion, and a green lotus seal appeared between her brows, continuously surging with vitality.

She twirled the lingering green qi around her fingertips, each strand containing immense life force.

"I didn't expect the Green Wood Evergreen Art to break through at this moment."

"Junior Sister?!"

The elder in the center saw the beauty and his expression could not help but become dazed.

"I didn't think I would see your appearance from back then."

The beauty glanced at the elder and let out a soft snort. "Enough. My great-grandson is nearly fifty years old. You should give up that notion of yours."

The elder in the center could not help but苦笑 (wry smile). The next moment, he guarded his mind and urged his true qi, using the ritual platform to gather the earth-veins and pry open the heavens and earth.

"Earthly Fiends take position, Heavenly Dipper inverts!"

In Bi Yuan's sharp cry, the entire Qingwei Mountain suddenly rose three inches!

The surface of the mountain manifested dense golden Dao patterns. At this moment, these characters swam like tadpoles toward the center of the ritual platform. On the Black Jade Platform where Xu Yunfan had once cultivated, they condensed into a golden pillar of light that connected heaven and earth.

In Yujing City, a thousand miles away, the Empress Dowager forcefully pushed away the palace maid supporting her.

"Dao Sect, Dao Sect! How dare they, how dare they!!!"

Her withered, thin fingers gripped the armrest of the dragon throne tightly. The murky pupils reflected the Profound Yellow earth-vein qi erupting from beneath the imperial city. The dragon vein qi that should have nourished her was now like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, surging toward a single direction within the seventy-two wards of Yujing City!

"What is that movement?!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly looked up, his indigo robes moving without wind.

Where his vision reached, the entire sky was dyed in Profound Yellow qi. The bluestone ground of the arena cracked inch by inch. The dormant dragon qi of the earth-vein, lying in wait for hundreds of years, now surged toward the heavens like a volcanic eruption, then swept toward him!

Boom!

Before he could react, a pillar of Profound Yellow qi, ten zhang in diameter, descended from the heavens and completely engulfed Xu Yunfan.

On the viewing stands, the steward of Prince Mu's manor had the teacup in his hand shatter. The experts of the Imperial City Department trembled. Even the commander, seated high on the platform, shot to his feet, his pupils shrinking beneath his玄铁 (black iron) face mask!

"How can this be? What is this?"

"The Great Zhou dragon vein, how can it be spewing Profound Yellow qi?!"

The moment the Profound Yellow qi entered his body, Xu Yunfan's bones erupted with a sound like frying beans.

The jade marrow and golden bones, perfected by the Marrow Cleansing and Meridian Refining Scripture, were refined once more, a gilded hue appearing deep within his bone marrow.

Blood patterns, condensed from the Ten Extreme Martial Dao, appeared densely on his skin's surface. Each pattern writhed like a living thing, converting the raging earth-vein qi into pure energy.

"Crack!"

A crystal bone spur suddenly pierced out from his left shoulder blade, only to be enveloped by new flesh in an instant.

*'You are undergoing cleansing by Profound Yellow qi. Your physical attributes are strengthening.'*
*'Your Ten Extreme Martial Dao is greatly improving.'*
*'Your physique is rapidly rising.'*
*'You...'*

The attribute panel in his vision was frantically refreshing. Xu Yunfan clearly felt his heart beating with a wondrous rhythm. Each contraction pumped out blood threaded with golden丝 (strands). Wherever this blood flowed, the muscle fibers twisted and reorganized like steel wire.

The sound of a rushing river echoed from within his abdomen.

Xu Yunfan had to fully operate the Ten Extreme Martial Dao, letting all the condensed劲力 (force) surge from around the Mixed Origin True Seed, continuously converting this Profound Yellow qi.

At this moment, how could he not understand?

It must be that his master, Bi Yuan, and the others were setting up a ritual platform thousands of miles away at the Dao Sect, moving the Dao veins, and drawing the earth-veins to pour into his body.

With such a method, how is it any different from that of an immortal?
