# Chapter 33: Yang Shou's Secret

"Heh heh!"

Yang Shou suddenly let out a cold laugh, all his previous disguises shed, his expression gradually turning deranged.

"You want me to die? Then I'll make sure you die first!"

Yang Shou's voice was as if possessed, filled with murderous intent.

His eyes were completely bloodshot, without a trace of clarity.

This was the first time Ding Rui felt fear since transmigrating to this world, a slight chill running down his spine.

He had no time to ponder if this was the so-called killing intent, nor to think about why Yang Shou would utter such merciless words.

For his own safety, he turned and ran.

At the same time, Mu Tian chose to act!

Private duels were strictly forbidden within the sect, but in some cases, or under certain special circumstances, using power to resolve a crisis was not prohibited.

Clearly, Yang Shou's actions at this moment had made Mu Tian perceive it as a crisis.

Mu Tian stood his ground, pressing his hands forward. Golden true essence immediately burst forth, fully materialized, like countless sharp spikes piercing towards Yang Shou.

This rudimentary application of true essence, however, was merely a delaying tactic.

But before Ding Rui could even think, the seemingly stunned Yang Shou suddenly moved.

A violent surge of true essence erupted from Yang Shou, at its center. All the spike-like golden true essence that had struck Yang Shou was vibrated away, losing its forward momentum.

His true essence taking a massive impact, Mu Tian couldn't help but feel a wave of discomfort. He quickly retracted the external true essence back into his body, and, as if facing a formidable enemy, activated a second spiritual talisman.

"Go to the Spirit Field Management Office and get help!"

At the same time, Mu Tian turned his head and shouted at Ding Rui, who was behind him.

Ding Rui initially thought he had misheard, but after hearing Mu Tian's shout again, he finally sobered up. Mu Tian was telling him to get help.

Mu Tian, a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, was asking him to get help for Yang Shou, who was only at the third level of Qi Refinement!

Though filled with questions, Ding Rui still decided to obey. He turned and ran.

But at this moment, Yang Shou's voice, raw from his throat, rang out: "You still want to run? You're the one who deserves to die the most!"

To Ding Rui, that voice sounded like the devil's whisper, rapidly approaching him from a distance, the last word almost spoken right into his ear.

He turned his head and glanced back. Mu Tian was already locked in battle with Yang Shou, golden and white lights flashing. Although Ding Rui couldn't understand the flow of the battle, it was clear that Mu Tian was constantly being suppressed and pushed back.

Yang Shou, however, continued to roar, desperately trying to break through to Ding Rui.

If Mu Tian hadn't resisted with all his might several times, even taking a serious injury, Ding Rui would probably have been directly killed by the enraged Yang Shou long ago.

Ding Rui withdrew his gaze. He knew that if he continued to delay, not only would he be in extreme danger, but Mu Tian might also die in this place.

"Are demonic cultivators really this strong?"

He was greatly alarmed, completely unable to fathom how a demonic cultivator could have infiltrated the sect and blended into the Spirit Field area!

But he also knew he couldn't afford to keep thinking.
