# Chapter 63: Primordial Realm Ruins

Old Huang and his companions charged forward, but soon heard the sound of hoofbeats from behind.

“You few, quickly retreat! Those are wolf cultivators with Mid-stage Mortal Realm cultivation, don’t charge!” a shout came from behind.

The cultivation methods and realm divisions differ among various types of cultivators. However, there is also a general classification. Mid-stage Mortal Realm is equivalent to a human cultivator's Sea Condensing Realm in the Sect Domain. Old Huang and his Foundation Establishment stage cultivators, however, were only at Low-stage Mortal Realm. The disparity between them was naturally immense.

While Old Huang was still hesitating, Jin Feng, who was at the very front, stopped and reached out to block Old Huang and the others. “Retreat, listen to the Senior Brothers!” Jin Feng shouted, then pushed Old Huang and the rest, forcing them to quickly fall back.

But as Old Huang turned his head, he saw a huge black figure rapidly approaching.

“Senior Brother Jin, be careful!” Old Huang yelled.

“Die!” A cry burst from inner disciple Ma Xiu. *Pfft!*

The inner disciples were completely caught off guard at first. They hadn't expected these wolf cultivators to attack using such methods. Their defensive spirit artifacts didn't fully cover their bodies, unable to completely block these pink powders. As a result, they all inhaled some, and a large amount settled on their bodies.

After killing these suicidal wolf cultivators, the inner disciples naturally guessed that the powder must be some kind of poison, definitely problematic. They immediately began trying to expel the poison with their true essence, staying put without moving further. They instructed Old Huang and the other outer disciples, who hadn't run far, to go and summon the Alchemy Hall disciples.

Hundreds of miles away from the Sect Domain, in a mountain valley, was the recent temporary dwelling of a wolf cultivator tribe. The reason they chose this valley was its convenient distance from the Sect Domain, neither too close nor too far, making it easy for them to act against it.

At this moment, a large group of wolf cultivators gathered in the open space of the valley. Three wolf kings stood atop a massive rock in the valley, gazing towards the distant Sect Domain with indifferent, majestic eyes.

“But we must get our hands on that ruin! That’s a ruin left behind by a Primordial Realm cultivator. Even if it contains only some seemingly insignificant items, for us, it will undoubtedly be incredibly important, perhaps even allowing us to successfully step into the Primordial Realm!” Fire Mark Wolf King said, his eyes dreamy and filled with yearning. “That’s a Primordial Realm cultivator… there’s a world of difference between that and our Mortal Realm.”

High-stage Mortal Realm corresponds to the Core Formation stage for human cultivators in the Sect Domain, and Peak Mortal Realm corresponds to the Divinity Transformation stage. The Primordial Realm, however, is a realm above the Divinity Transformation stage. For nearly a thousand years, no Primordial Realm cultivator had appeared in the entire Huaqing Realm.

“If you’re so eager to get that ruin, you can go yourself. I won’t be accompanying you,” Long Tail Wolf King said.

Fire Mark Wolf King’s tail instantly stiffened, baring its fangs and snarling, hot air steaming from its maw. Long Tail Wolf King was not to be outdone, lowering its body and extending its front paws, also ready to attack. The two wolf kings were at daggers drawn, the atmosphere growing tense.
