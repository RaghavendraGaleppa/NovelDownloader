# Chapter 56: A Clean Break

“Is that really what Steward Yang said?”

Young Master Zhang asked with a trembling voice, his face ashen. Xiao Tan nodded vigorously.

Master Zhang had been detained by Yang Can under the pretext that many of his subordinates were involved in corrupt and illegal activities.

It was said to be an investigation, but everyone knew it was just a polite way of putting it before his crimes were made public.

The Cloud-Shadow Tower, already shaken to its core by Yang Can’s series of dismantling moves, had now completely collapsed in the hearts of the people of Feng’an Manor.

Young Master Zhang had brought a generous gift to plead for an audience with Yang Can, but the previously courteous Yang Can now refused to see him.

However, the Zhang family had not been restricted in any way despite Zhang Yunyi’s detention.

The Zhang family took the opportunity to quietly transfer their liquid assets out of the fortress.

A distraught Young Master Zhang received news from Xiao Tan at this very moment—a piece of news that was utterly despairing.

Young Master Zhang slumped into a chair, his face the color of gray earth.

*If Yang Can dares to do this, he must have already obtained a major lever against my family, right?*

*If that’s the case, what’s the point of transferring our liquid assets out of the fortress?*

*As long as the Zhang family cannot escape the Yu family’s territory, we will ultimately be at their mercy!*

*But we can only play petty tricks within Feng’an Manor right now. Is there still a chance if we try to escape now?*

“I… understand. Xiao Tan, you’ve done well. The Zhang family won’t forget your contribution. I will reward you handsomely,” Young Master Zhang said, casually offering Xiao Tan a empty promise before waving her away.

Once Xiao Tan left, Young Master Zhang paced the room like an ant on a hot pan for a long time. Finally, he stomped his foot hard and strode out.

Zhang Xiaomi was Zhang Yunyi’s paternal uncle, the eldest of the Zhang family.

Young Master Zhang usually had little contact with this grand-uncle.

But with disaster looming, the only elder of the clan he could consult was this grand-uncle.

After all, they were all in the same boat.

“This Yang Can is a ruthless man!” Zhang Xiaomi coughed twice and muttered, “This old man finally sees it clearly! This Steward Yang intends to use the blood of our Zhang family to dye his own reputation, to intimidate the six manors.”

Young Master Zhang said impatiently, “Grand-uncle, what’s the use of saying this now? What do we do? What do we do right now? That’s the most important thing!”

Zhang Xiaomi was silent for a long time before slowly saying, “You just said that Steward Yang lives in the east wing, adjacent to the granary?”

“Yes, what of it?”

A fierce glint flashed through Zhang Xiaomi’s eyes, and he said grimly, “We’ll set fire to the east wing and blame it on a natural disaster!”

Young Master Zhang’s eyes widened in shock. “But… what the hell is the use of that? We’ll still die!”

Zhang Xiaomi shook his head and said viciously, “We set fire to the east wing, and the granary is caught in the blaze. We burn all the stewards locked inside to death!”

Young Master Zhang was horrified. “G-Grand-uncle, my… my father is locked in the granary too!”

Zhang Xiaomi slowly lowered his eyelids, looking as if he hadn’t heard a word.

Young Master Zhang instantly understood. His grand-uncle intended to…

Young Master Zhang shrank back into his chair, nervously chewing on his fingernails—a habit he’d had since childhood.

Zhang Xiaomi said slowly, “If only Yang Can dies, we would be unable to escape responsibility. But if so many stewards in the manor die, it would be a natural disaster caused by dry weather.”

In the Hetao region, the wind blows from the southwest and northwest in spring.

Thus, once a fire started in the east wing, the granary area outside would easily be engulfed by the wind-driven flames.

Zhang Xiaomi said, “With so many dead at once, how many widows and orphans will there be? Will they not make a fuss? Our Feng’an Manor has been turned into this mess by that姓Yang (Yang) fellow. We can forget about a good harvest this autumn. What do you think the other five manors will do, feeling like a fox mourning the death of a hare?”

There was one thing Zhang Xiaomi did not say aloud.

If Zhang Yunyi also died in this fire, without evidence, who would dare accuse the Zhang family of starting it?

Once Zhang Yunyi was burned to death, the Zhang family would become the victims, capable of inciting the other victims to escalate the situation.

Moreover, they could use this fire to burn away much of the evidence unfavorable to the Zhang family.

With the witnesses gone, the physical evidence gone, and the investigators gone, what could anyone do?

To pacify the situation, the Clan Lord would most likely choose to let the matter rest.

After all, for the Clan Lord, the death of a steward meant nothing; maintaining his stable rule was what mattered most.

Young Master Zhang’s face flickered with uncertainty as he sat there in a daze, saying nothing.

This not only challenged the Clan Lord’s bottom line but also violated his own.

At the very least, he had never thought about patricide.

Zhang Xiaomi thumped his cane on the ground and asked sternly, “The fire is already burning our eyebrows. Have you made up your mind?”

Young Master Zhang stammered, “I… should I discuss this with my mother and my brothers first?”

Zhang Xiaomi sneered. “Can you command the guards in Feng’an Fortress?”

Young Master Zhang straightened his chest slightly. “With my father away, I am the head of the family. Of course I can command them.”

Zhang Xiaomi said, “Then that’s settled. If you insist on making it known to everyone, how will you hide it from the public?”

Young Master Zhang lowered his head, weighing his options repeatedly.

He and his father indeed had little affection between them, but patricide—even just thinking about it—made his heart pound with terror.

Zhang Xiaomi said, “I will have your three cousins help you.”

Zhang Xiaomi had three grandsons in total, meaning he was binding himself completely to this plan.

The constant pressure from Yang Can’s dismantling moves, the urge to escape that had already been stirred by moving their assets, combined with Zhang Xiaomi’s current instigation, finally made Young Master Zhang make up his mind.

He slapped his thigh hard and said through gritted teeth, “Yang Can, you forced me to do this!”

Night of April 18th.

There was wind tonight.

A northwest wind.

Young Master Zhang mobilized over a dozen Zhang family guards he believed he could trust completely.

Carrying jars of lamp oil, they quietly approached the east wing guest rooms where Yang Can and his party were staying.

This was the Zhang family’s territory; they were most familiar with every tree, brick, and tile.

Thus, they approached quietly without alerting the guards in the courtyard.

The Zhang family had raised fierce guard dogs, but since the intruders were from the Zhang family themselves, the dogs naturally did not bark.

In this era, even in Longshang, the buildings of wealthy families were mostly made of wood.

With wind tonight and lamp oil in hand, setting fire to a wooden building was easy.

Yang Can stood on the high granite base of the granary area, looking at the small building he should have been sleeping in.

This was the granary furthest from the east wing in the granary area, still holding half a bin of old grain.

Yang Can had come up here in a hurry, still wearing his nightgown.

The wind blew against his nightgown, making the hem flutter incessantly.

When Young Master Zhang was gathering the guards to make his move, Yang Can had already received the warning and quietly left.

He knew the Zhang family would act; under his constant pressure, people’s hearts would eventually break.

He just wasn’t sure how the Zhang family would act.

Now, he knew.

*Whoosh!*

The wind fanned the flames, and oil was poured on the fire—the result was self-evident.

A giant torch rapidly appeared in the night sky.

The evening wind in Longshang was very strong.

From here, one could clearly see the tongues of flame desperately licking the sky.

The tongues of flame, influenced by the strong high-altitude currents, bent sharply and rolled toward the storage area.

The flames were intense, and Yang Can was standing downwind, so even from a distance, he could still feel the scorching heat.

Zhang Yunyi, his two thumbs bound together with tough boiled ox tendons, stood beside Yang Can.

His face was extremely unsightly.

The fire was so fierce that even steel might melt.

The tongues of flame had already touched the first granary.

The part of the granary above the base was made of flammable materials and immediately caught fire.

If there was anyone inside, by the time this great fire burned out, they would likely leave no trace behind.

Zhang Yunyi was a man with a strong sense of family. In the first half of his life, he had fought with his life and his blade to carve out a bright future.

In the second half of his life, he had devoted himself wholeheartedly to strengthening the Zhang family, so that the family could flourish and firmly take root on the land of Longshang.

Therefore, as long as it could protect the Zhang family he had single-handedly built up, he was willing to die when necessary.

However, willingly sacrificing himself and being betrayed to death by the family he wanted to protect were two different things.

This was the ultimate betrayal. All his efforts and sacrifices had become a huge joke in this fire.

As soon as the fire started, the Zhang family members began to make a clamor.

The uninformed Zhang family members panicked, shouting for the servants and guards to hurry to the east wing to put out the fire.

But the fire was raging, and it was impossible to get close.

Deep in the granary area, on the granite base, Yang Can sat down, his legs dangling naturally.

The distant firelight flickered on his face with the wind.

Yang Can looked at the firelight and said to Zhang Yunyi, whose face was the color of earth, “Master Zhang, did you see it? This… is the Zhang family you devoted yourself to protecting!”

Yang Can shook his head and sighed, “Over all these years, you have probably only nurtured their calm enjoyment of wealth and glory. Each and every one of them has grown a crooked heart.”

*Whoosh…* The small building had not collapsed yet, but the top of the first granary to catch fire began to crumble.

The burning debris from the collapse splashed countless sparks, lifted high by the wind, scattered and dazzling.

“Master Zhang, I have a very good suggestion. Would you like to hear it?”

Yang Can suddenly turned his head, amidst the fluttering “starlight,” and smiled at Zhang Yunyi.

His smile was dazzling amidst the “starlight.”

Below the one-zhang-high granite base, two stewards and two matrons were supervising the guards watching over the many stewards of Feng’an Manor.

The stewards were petrified.

The granary originally used to imprison them had just been turned into a sky full of stars by the collapse.

Qing Mei, her heart still pounding from the shock, looked at the collapsed granary, then suddenly turned her head to look at the high stone base.

Yang Can was sitting on the edge of that stone base, the firelight illuminating his features, as if carved from granite.

*Thump!* Zhang Yunyi, his hands bound, suddenly knelt before Yang Can.

Because his hands were bound, he couldn’t kneel slowly, and his knees hit the hard granite.

His knees hurt, but his heart hurt even more.

Yang Can looked at the graying head bowed deeply before him.

Zhang Yunyi’s shoulders were trembling violently; he was weeping silently.

Yang Can said leisurely, “Master Zhang, I guarantee you will not regret today’s choice!”

Little Qing Mei looked up at the scene with her small face, staring fixedly, her eyes filled with admiration.
