Chapter 32: Heaven's Mandate!

Hearing the sound of the door opening, Zhou Zui turned his head, muttering displeasedly, "Didn't I say..."
Before he could finish, he saw Zhou Tian standing at the doorway, and his expression became quite a spectacle.

"Tell them to get dressed and leave," Zhou Tian said, frowning, paying no mind to the visibly startled Zhou Zui.

"Uh-huh..." Zhou Zui nodded frantically, gesturing for the young women beside him to leave.

"Get your clothes on! My fiancée is outside!"

"Uh-huh..." They scrambled to put their clothes on.

"Adjust the room's ambiance back to normal."

"Uh-huh..."

Seeing that everything was almost in order, Zhou Tian nodded in satisfaction, then went out and brought Tian Ling in.

It was essentially Tian Ling and Zhou Zui's first meeting. Zhou Zui proactively stood up and greeted, "Greetings, Sister-in-law!"

"Mm..." Tian Ling blushed and nodded.

"Alright, alright," Zhou Tian said to Zhou Zui, then led Tian Ling to sit at the table.

"You're the heir to the Carefree King, yet you act like a wimp!"

Zhou Zui forced a wry smile. *Big Brother, you've died twice and resurrected twice in front of me, and even Old Zhan showed up. It's a miracle I'm not a total wreck.*

"Clear all this stuff away and bring out today's special dishes!" Zhou Tian said, dissatisfied, looking at the leftovers on the table.

"Uh-huh..." Zhou Zui pressed a spot on the table, and a talisman array flashed. The entire table instantly refreshed. He then swiped a few times on the array, and with a flash of golden light, a golden-threaded dragon-patterned purple-gold jade porcelain pot appeared on the table. The jade pot was exquisite and translucent, allowing a clear view of its contents.

Golden mist swirled, like clouds in the Ninth Heaven, and a swimming dragon faintly appeared and disappeared, churning within the golden mist—a truly extraordinary sight.

The Sky Dance Pavilion had special dishes every day, all made from extremely rare ingredients. Just one serving could cost millions of spirit stones. But for Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui, spirit stones? What were those?

Opening the pot's lid, the swimming dragon soared three feet high before dispersing. A rich aroma permeated the air. As the golden mist dissipated, a foot-long dragonfish was revealed inside the pot.

Divine dragons held no special status in the Sky Qin Empire; dragon-based dishes were common even at state banquets.

"A Golden-Scaled Dragonfish! We're in for a treat today. Although it doesn't contain too much energy, its taste is unparalleled, and its texture is comparable to Great Saint-level ingredients!" Zhou Tian chuckled as he looked at the dragonfish. Though he knew little about cultivation, he was quite knowledgeable about food, drink, and entertainment.

This was exactly what Zhou Tian wanted. If it were truly a Saint-level ingredient, he wouldn't dare let Tian Ling eat too much; the scene of her sweating profusely and looking enchanting was something he preferred to enjoy alone.

He picked up a piece of fish and placed it at Tian Ling's lips. Tian Ling's small face turned slightly red, and she secretly glanced at Zhou Zui, who quickly averted his gaze, signaling that he wasn't peeking.

Only then did Tian Ling part her cherry lips and eat the fish. As her pearly teeth gently chewed, a look of astonishment appeared in her eyes; the exquisite taste clearly exceeded her expectations.

"Is it good?" Zhou Tian asked.

"Mm," Tian Ling nodded.

Zhou Tian then took a bite himself. The fish melted in his mouth, as if a fish was swimming within it. He nodded slightly; it tasted much like what he remembered.

After another bite, Zhou Tian spoke, "Zhou Zui, the banquet is tonight. You're still fooling around here. Aren't you afraid your father will break your legs?"

Zhou Zui sighed. "I'm not the main character tonight. It's those elder brothers. I'll just squat in a corner, and no one will bother me." *Big Brother, you made me send all the young ladies away, just so I could watch you two flaunt your affection here?*

Tian Ling picked up a piece of fish, held it suspended in mid-air, bit her lip lightly, and after much hesitation, placed the fish in front of Zhou Tian's mouth.

Zhou Tian lowered his head to look at Tian Ling. Tian Ling's eyes subtly darted away. He smiled faintly and opened his mouth to take the fish. Who said carnal desires were the only pursuit in male-female relationships? This kind of spiritual sublimation was Zhou Tian's true pursuit.

Zhou Zui watched this entire display, his mouth twitching. The putrid stench of love... *Ugh...*

"Sigh... Do you know where those brothers are fighting?" Zhou Tian suddenly remembered this question and asked Zhou Zui.

"Big Brother, both of your elder brothers are out there. I don't have any of them. How would I know?" Zhou Zui said helplessly. His father had married late, and he was the first legitimate child. "However, they're definitely not within the Nine Prefectures!" Zhou Zui quickly changed the subject.

"Not within the Nine Prefectures?" Zhou Tian's interest was piqued.

"That's right. This isn't really a secret, though... I never paid attention to these things before..."

"Think about it, besides Old Zhan, who else among the clan elders have you met?"

"They're all outside the Nine Prefectures. I don't know exactly where, but we'll probably find out after our experiential training begins."

"So that's how it is..." Zhou Tian nodded, secretly pondering. It seemed there were deeper hidden things in this world.

"By the way, what exactly is this experiential training?" Hearing Zhou Zui mention it, Zhou Tian seized the opportunity to ask.

"This so-called experiential training isn't unique to our Sky Qin Dynasty. It's jointly organized by all major forces in the Eight Prefectures. The training ground is in the Ninth Prefecture, the Unclaimed Land."

Zhou Tian pondered for a moment. Zhou Zui continued, "The time is almost upon us. It will begin not long after the Youth Tournament."

"All young people from the Eight Prefectures?" Zhou Tian asked, surprised.

"Exactly. Though it's called experiential training, this time it's more like a competition. This Youth Tournament is just a grand event for our one prefecture. Although people from other prefectures will come, they're only a small fraction of the younger generation."

"But the Eight Prefectures' experiential training is different. All the Heaven's Favored from the Eight Prefectures will enter it, competing in all aspects: strength, strategy, and means."

A look of yearning appeared in Zhou Zui's eyes. What a grand spectacle that would be, with prodigies from all prefectures contending, finding endless joy in battling others!

"But how are the rankings determined?" Zhou Tian wondered. Since an entire prefecture was being used as a competition ground, such a grand scale surely couldn't involve simple arena matches.

"Previously, the final assessment was done by the Sky-Gazing Mirror of the Simpletons. They aren't very concerned with fame and fortune, and they would exclude their own people during the assessment, so it was relatively credible. Primarily, it was just a ranking, without much real benefit, only some prestige."

"Previously?" Zhou Tian sharply caught that keyword.

"Yes, previously," Zhou Zui nodded. "According to my father, this time it's a bit different. Do you know why no one has occupied the Ninth Prefecture?" Zhou Zui didn't answer directly, setting up suspense.

"Stop beating around the bush!" Zhou Tian said, annoyed.

"Uh-huh..."

"...The reason the Ninth Prefecture isn't occupied is because it has a flaw. The other several prefectures all have something called 'Heaven's Mandate.' It's the essence of a prefecture condensed. Those who carry 'Heaven's Mandate' can not only use it to suppress enemies within that prefecture, but their cultivation speed will also be incredibly fast, possessing various indescribably profound functions. However, the Ninth Prefecture suffered severe damage in ancient times and fundamentally cannot form a 'Heaven's Mandate'!"
