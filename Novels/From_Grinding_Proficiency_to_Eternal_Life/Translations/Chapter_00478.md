# Chapter 478: Cultivation

Xu Yunfan referred to it as a chain.

This so-called "chain" was actually a forbidden art that deceived the heavens and stole fortune.

The method of grafting a small world was essentially using a secret technique to blind the Heavenly Dao, forcibly stealing the origin qi of a minor thousand-world, and grafting it onto one's own foundation like a transplant.

This method was extremely dangerous. A slight misstep could invite the backlash of the realm. In light cases, one's foundation would collapse; in severe cases, one's soul would be extinguished.

However, if successful, it was akin to stealing the creation of heaven and earth, seizing the origin power of a world as one's own, and achieving the embryonic form of one's own small world.

Xu Yunfan, following the method taught by Bai Yue, drove the power of the four great divine abilities within his body—especially the Supreme Purple Weiyi Suppressing Evil Primordial Qi—to temper his spiritual sense, condensing the illusory chain containing strange fluctuations bit by bit.

Every condensation felt like igniting an invisible Yin fire deep within his soul, bringing needle-like pain.

On the attribute panel, the proficiency indicator representing the comprehension of this technique jumped slowly but steadily. Every increase in proficiency allowed him to obtain new insights, thereby constantly correcting the minute errors in his spiritual thought construction.

Those errors were precisely the fatal flaws deliberately left behind in the version taught by Bai Yue.

It really works!

Xu Yunfan's heart settled, feeling a sense of relief.

Fortunately, he had the attribute panel; otherwise, he might have been stabbed in the back.

Xu Yunfan carefully调动 his True Martial Power, blending a trace of the imperceptible Eight Scenery Cloud Qi of the Cloud Satchel to construct a vortex structure on the outer layer of his foundation.

This process was like walking on thin ice; a single misstep could damage his own foundation.

If other True Persons were to cultivate this, the process might take decades. But in Xu Yunfan's vision, the cursor on the panel acted like the most precise scalpel, helping him avoid the dangerous nodes within Bai Yue's method that would cause the vortex to become unstable or even collapse.

Once the embryonic form of the small world was stabilized and the initial grafting was successful, and the origin qi entered his body, he would need to use a secret technique to bind and refine it, guiding it to construct a "small world embryonic form" between reality and illusion around his core divine ability.

At this point, he could truly step into the late stage of Foundation Establishment, with perfection in sight.

Once his own small world embryonic form was completely formed, he could then support the small world and prove the Golden Core Great Dao.

This was the final and most dangerous step of the grafting technique.

Xu Yunfan did not rush to practice it practically; he only simulated and evolved it within his Sea of Consciousness.

Every time he simulated, he saw through the panel that if he completed the final "stabilization" step according to the specific mantra combination taught by Bai Yue, the seemingly harmless mantra would instantly detonate, turning the origin qi he had painstakingly absorbed along with his own soul into "fertilizer" for the Divine Martial World.

After practicing until late at night, Xu Yunfan then used the meditation of the Lin Seal to strengthen his soul before finally breathing out a sigh.

He couldn't help but rub his brow.

In the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, the channels for advancement were basically controlled by the True Lords. Although the True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture he cultivated had an empty position in the Divine Martial World, it was highly likely left deliberately by the Pure Source True Lord.

It was meant for someone to prove the position and harvest the fruit.

But he had already become a Golden Core True Lord; what use would he have for these extra positions?

Thoughts welled up in Xu Yunfan's mind. After a long while, he finally shook his head.

He wouldn't know until he reached that step.

Meanwhile, his cultivation of the "Eight Scenery Cloud Satchel for Refining Heaven's Creation" was nothing short of frantic.

Taking advantage of his position as the Guardian of the Cold Crow Pass and the resources he had gathered, Xu Yunfan initiated an endless cycle of artifact refining.

He used the low-grade ores and fragments of discarded artifacts obtained from the treasury, as well as those he bought with spirit stones himself, as materials.

He even spread the word that he was willing to refine artifacts for a fee.

At first, people were skeptical, until Zhou Lu, hoping to curry favor with his superior, contributed materials, and finally walked out joyfully with a top-grade artifact. The cultivators at Cold Crow Pass were completely stirred.

A top-grade artifact—let alone Qi Condensation cultivators, even True Persons who had just entered Foundation Establishment would only have top-grade artifacts at most.

Naturally, people came in an endless stream to ask him for refinements. Moreover, Xu Yunfan didn't care about the origins of his clients, which attracted even more rogue cultivators to visit.

"..."

"Kan Gold Cloud Qi!"

Xu Yunfan let out a low shout, his hand seals changing at his fingertips. A wisp of faint blue cloud qi containing sharp gold energy surged from his sleeve, wrapping around a piece of meteoric iron.

The panel's operation interface lit up. The gold-energy cloud stream, like a precise engraving tool, infiltrated the ore along the optimal path guided by the panel.

With a hissing sound, the impurities of the ore were rapidly stripped away, leaving only the purest essence of庚金 (Geng Metal).

*Your proficiency in Supreme Purple Weiyi Suppressing Evil Primordial Qi has increased by 1.*

Xu Yunfan glanced at the information prompt that appeared in his vision, then paid it no further attention. He had grown accustomed to it these days.

"Li Fire Cloud Qi!"

Red light rose, and true fire flowed, melting and shaping the essence, revealing the雏形 (chuxing - embryonic form) of a small Li Fire Shield.

Cloud qi outlined simple fire-attribute runes within it.

"Xun Wind Cloud Qi... Gen Mountain Cloud Qi..."

The eight types of cloud qi took turns on stage.

He was refining the lowest grade of artifacts or even semi-finished talisman embryos, not seeking power, but only seeking to complete each piece with the highest efficiency and maximum material utilization under the panel's assistance, frantically accumulating the number of successful artifact refinings.

Every successful refinement would increase the proficiency of the Eight Scenery Cloud Satchel for Refining Heaven's Creation by one point.

If he refined a treasure, the proficiency increase would be several times greater.

Xu Yunfan naturally deliberately suppressed his artifact refining level, always only showing the ability to refine artifacts, and never easily touching the level of treasures.

Being able to refine artifacts and being able to refine treasures seem like only a step apart, but in reality, they are worlds apart.

Artifacts are merely the shallow application of spiritual materials; anyone with a bit of understanding of artifact refining, as well as insight and practical operation, can do it.

Whereas treasures require melting and refining the spiritual charm of heaven and earth, connecting to the runes of the Dao; only a true master of artifact refining can accomplish it.

Once he showed the ability to refine treasures, it would definitely attract the special attention of the high-levels of the Primordial Origin Sect, and might even alert the Pure Source True Lord.

By then, his position as the Guardian of Cold Crow Pass would probably be out of his control.

Either he would be forcibly conscripted as a sect artifact refiner, refining treasures for others day and night.

Or he would be deeply investigated for the origins of his artifact refining heritage, and the secret of the Eight Scenery Cloud Satchel for Refining Heaven's Creation might be exposed.

Neither outcome was something he could bear.

Therefore, Xu Yunfan always maintained his artifact refining level at "skilled but not yet reaching mastery," so as not to be looked down upon for crude refining, nor invite disaster from overly high standards.

In this Taihua Spirit Ruin World, hiding one's brilliance is sometimes more important than showing off.

In the next fifteen years, Xu Yunfan buried himself in cultivation day and night. The side hall of the stone palace became an artifact refining workshop. Piles of ore and spiritual materials were consumed, replaced by the proficiency bar of the "Eight Scenery Cloud Satchel for Refining Heaven's Creation" on the attribute panel rising at a visible speed. More importantly, his control over the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi became as precise as moving his own limbs.
