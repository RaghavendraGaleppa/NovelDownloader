# Chapter 63: The True Successor Position!

"Secret realm? What secret realm? What does that have to do with me? I'm not going to any secret realms," Zhang Yan replied, thoroughly confused.

Of course he knew about secret realms. These were small spaces existing alongside the cultivation world, also called sub-spaces. There were many ways these miniature worlds could form—some occurred naturally, others were small worlds captured by the cultivation world, and the last type were those artificially created by cultivators.

The thought of forcibly creating an entire small world made Zhang Yan wonder just how powerful those cultivators' magic power had been, what treasures they'd used to create them, and where those treasures might be now. If he could find such a treasure and equip it... that would be absolutely amazing. But alas, it was just a fantasy.

Regardless of how they formed, all small worlds shared one common trait—they were mostly rich in spiritual energy. Having remained undisturbed for long periods, they also contained numerous rare treasures and exotic beasts, any one of which could be incredibly valuable.

But with opportunity came danger. Every time a secret realm appeared, it would inevitably stir up storms of bloodshed, sometimes even triggering major upheavals in the cultivation world.

Yet... what did any of that have to do with Zhang Yan? He was just a simple farmer. He wasn't going to any secret realms or chasing any opportunities. At most, if someone brought back some second-hand magical tools they didn't want, he might trade for them.

Seeing Zhang Yan's indifferent attitude, Mu Sen's normally wooden expression became animated. "This is a secret realm we're talking about! Don't you want to go? What if you find some heavenly treasure and strike it rich?" Mu Sen looked at Zhang Yan and asked, "Don't you want to achieve enlightenment and become immortal?"

"I do," Zhang Yan nodded. After all, wasn't becoming an immortal the very reason everyone worked so hard at cultivation? But he quickly added, "But I'm afraid of dying."

Yes, Zhang Yan was afraid of death. There was no shame in admitting it—everyone feared death, so he had no intention of risking his life. Especially since he'd already died once before.

Watching Zhang Yan's resolute expression, Mu Sen sighed inwardly. Despite being a Foundation Establishment cultivator, his own determination paled in comparison. But he quickly steeled himself. Zhang Yan had made his choice, and Mu Sen had his own path to follow. He would fight and seize opportunities—how else could he hope to achieve the Dao?

"This secret realm is different, Zhang Yan. You have to go," Zhuge Wan suddenly interjected during their conversation.

"Ah?" Zhang Yan felt uneasy. He really didn't want to go to any secret realm—they were far too dangerous! Not only would he face unknown threats within, but also other cultivators. In fact, the cultivators might be even more dangerous than the realm itself. So no, he didn't want to go.

"This secret realm was established by the ancient Taiyi Sect to train disciples. Inside, you can comprehend various spells and supernatural abilities—all extremely rare and valuable. And do you think just anyone can enter? Our Qingheng Sect only received fewer than ten spots. Even if you want to go, you'd need to secure one of those limited slots."

"Does that mean only true successors can enter?" Mu Sen blurted out upon hearing Zhuge Wan's words.

"Nine spots in total. Six for true successors, leaving three remaining."

"Comprehending techniques and supernatural abilities? Rare treasures?" Zhang Yan's eyes lit up. This sounded like a good opportunity. As for the danger? Please—he, Zhang Yan, had been able to kill late-stage Qi Refining cultivators even when he was only at the early stage. Sure, there had been some luck involved, but his strength had improved since then, and he now had six equipment slots. With more equipment to stack, his current power could easily overwhelm ordinary late-stage Qi Refining cultivators.

As for those at the Great Perfection stage of Qi Refining... if he couldn't win, couldn't he just run? By stacking speed-enhancing equipment, when it came to fleeing, he feared no one! Besides, this wasn't some kill-or-be-killed secret realm—it was for comprehending techniques. There was no need for excessive bloodshed.

The only obstacle remaining was securing a spot. According to Zhuge Wan, the Qingheng Sect had nine spots in total, with six undoubtedly going to true successors. The sect had nine true successor positions available, but they adhered to the principle of "quality over quantity," so vacancies were common. Currently, they only had six true successors—fortunately, as that left three spots open.

"Only three spots? The odds are too slim," Mu Sen sighed. He knew his own limitations. While his abilities weren't bad, compared to the sect's true geniuses, he fell short. He stood no chance. But Zhang Yan's prospects were much better than his.

Because this secret realm focused on comprehending techniques rather than combat or cultivation, comprehension ability was paramount. And Mu Sen had witnessed Zhang Yan's comprehension skills firsthand—mastering two spells to perfection in just a few years. Such talent likely made him the foremost genius in the entire Qingheng Sect.

"Master, I think I have a chance," Zhang Yan said to Zhuge Wan.

"You certainly do," Zhuge Wan nodded. "But competing for a mere secret realm spot is too trivial. Why not aim for a true successor position instead?" As she spoke, her eyes narrowed slightly, gleaming with intensity.

"Eh? A true successor position? For Junior Brother Zhang?" Hearing this, Mu Sen and the others widened their eyes in shock, staring at Zhang Yan.

Zhang Yan himself hadn't expected Zhuge Wan to suggest this. The true successor position in the Qingheng Sect wasn't something to be taken lightly. As a true successor, one's status would be second only to Core Formation elders—even Foundation Establishment deacons would rank lower. That was because true successors were seedlings with the potential to form golden cores.

Moreover, once becoming a true successor, one would be exempt from sect missions. Unless absolutely necessary, the sect wouldn't demand their involvement. A true successor had only one task: cultivate, cultivate, and cultivate some more! Reaching Core Formation was their sole mission.

And now, Zhuge Wan was urging Zhang Yan to compete for this position.

Seeing everyone's astonishment, Zhuge Wan said nonchalantly, "Although Zhang Yan has inferior spiritual roots, his comprehension is monstrous. Mastering two perfect spells in such a short time at his young age—I believe he can master at least five perfect spells before establishing his foundation. At that point, who could deny he's a genius?"

Someone who established their foundation with five perfected spells—what did inferior spiritual roots matter then? Even their sect leader had only established his foundation with three perfected spells! Therefore, Zhang Yan absolutely could compete for a true successor position!
