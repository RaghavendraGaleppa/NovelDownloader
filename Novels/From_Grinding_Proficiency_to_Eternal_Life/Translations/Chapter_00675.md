# Chapter 675: The Scarlet Sun Dao Fruit

"Many thanks for the Venerable True Lord's grace!"

Bi Yuan and the others were overwhelmed with gratitude, their hearts surging with infinite excitement.

When one attains the Dao, even their chickens and dogs ascend to heaven.

From a remote spiritual peak, they had leaped directly to become disciples of the Nine Great Immortal Mountains. Such an opportunity was enough to make countless disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect green with envy.

The group secretly resolved themselves to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Xu Yunfan watched from the side and nodded inwardly. When he glanced at Bi Yuan and the others, seeing them looking at him with a somewhat restrained manner, he couldn't help but sigh softly in his heart.

With such a vast disparity in strength, although their relationship remained close, a bit of awkwardness was inevitable. Xu Yunfan had no way to resolve this.

After completely settling the mountain gate disciples, refining the origin of the Divine Xiao Mountain, stabilizing his Golden Core realm, and initially completing the arrangement of the mountain protection formation, Xu Yunfan finally devoted his entire mind to the path beyond the Golden Core.

Nourishing the Core to transform the Heaven, devouring the Dao Fruit.

The path was clear and definite; the next step was simply to continuously stabilize his Cave Heaven Dao Fruit.

This was the true meaning of the Golden Core.

To advance further, one must devour other Dao Fruits.

He looked inward into his Dantian. The Divine Xiao Golden Core shimmered with purple and gold brilliance, and the nascent form of a Cave Heaven slowly revolved within it.

The Divine Xiao Dao Fruit governed destruction and generation, the utmost Yang, yet solitary Yang cannot grow.

If he wanted his Cave Heaven to be stable and suspended high, with laws naturally forming, to then nourish the Golden Core and his own body, reaching the realm where the Cave Heaven does not fall in the mid-stage of the Golden Core, he must introduce the power of other Dao Fruits to harmonize and catalyze, forming a cycle.

The best target was the Scarlet Sun True Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's Scarlet Sun Dao Fruit.

This Dao Fruit had attributes similar to the Divine Xiao Dao Fruit, both belonging to the utmost Yang.

If they could be fused, Yang Fire would birth Yang Lightning, or Yang Lightning would stimulate Yang Fire. The power would surely skyrocket, allowing him to quickly advance to the peak of the early Golden Core stage, or even glimpse the threshold of the mid-stage.

But Xu Yunfan was well aware that this was almost equivalent to declaring war on the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Perhaps for Qi Condensation disciples, or even Foundation Establishment True Lords, their deaths were nothing to the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. After all, everyone was a True Lord. When encountering mutual interests, although they might not be on the best of terms, they could still join forces.

But if one were to plot against a True Lord's Dao Fruit, the hidden dangers were self-evident.

With the slightest carelessness, the result would be a ganging-up. The Universal Salvation True Lord would definitely not make a move to save him.

The opponent's supernatural powers and techniques would undoubtedly harbor an instinctual coveting for Xu Yunfan's Divine Xiao Dao Fruit, like the two poles of a magnet attracting and repelling each other.

They were natural mortal enemies in the Dao struggle, irreconcilable.

"Li Guang Ran Yan Scarlet Sun True Lord..."

Xu Yunfan murmured this name in a low voice, purple and golden lightning flashing in his eyes.

His foundation was only just stable now. If he were to recklessly confront this veteran True Lord, his chances of victory were slim. A direct, forceful attack was a terrible strategy.

Since learning this information, Xu Yunfan had been consciously collecting all relevant intelligence on the Scarlet Sun True Lord.

Through the Primordial Origin Sect's internal intelligence channels and by discreetly probing some well-informed Foundation Establishment True Lords, Xu Yunfan gradually outlined the profile of the Scarlet Sun True Lord.

His temperament was like his Dao Fruit—fiery and violent, with a temper as hot as fire. Within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, he was famous for his formidable combat prowess and explosive temper.

His methods against enemies were brutal, and he believed in the sword path of killing.

His Dao techniques were also highly distinctive. The Scarlet Sun Dao Fruit granted him a terrifying fire-based supernatural power capable of burning the heavens and boiling the seas. His sword intent was scorching and domineering, and he was especially skilled in large-scale incinerating sword arts. With a single sword strike, a thousand miles of land would be scorched.

His lifebound flying sword, the "Fenji," was even more notoriously fierce.

From the perspective of his social relationships, he did not get along too well with the Sect Master of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the Pure Yang Ancestor, Lu Chunyang. Xu Yunfan could also guess this, after all, whether it was the Scarlet Sun True Lord or the Profound Mystery True Lord, they were both direct disciples of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

The Pure Yang Ancestor, on the other hand, was an outsider who had risen from humble beginnings, and they always looked down on him, failing to see eye to eye.

Although the Pure Yang Ancestor was currently in the mid-stage of the Golden Core and was the number one figure within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

He had long-standing friction with the other True Lord in the sect, the Vast Ancient Heavenly Light of the North Pole Peak, who had also proven the Dao. Due to differing philosophies—one focused on ultimate destruction, the other on the universal shining of heavenly light—they had clashed many times.

In the Bodhisattva Pure Land, he had an even greater blood debt and was one of the sword sect True Lords most hated by the Buddhist cultivators.

He was usually stationed at the Scarlet Sun Peak, one of the Twelve Sword Peaks of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. However, being warlike by nature, he often took the initiative to patrol the borders, particularly enjoying provoking the Bodhisattva Pure Land and the Primordial Origin Sect.

Many Foundation Establishment True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect had fallen to him. It was said that the Clear Source True Lord had also clashed with this Scarlet Sun True Lord repeatedly.

His Dao field, the Scarlet Sun Peak, was heavily restricted, with a dense concentration of fire laws, making it difficult for outsiders to enter.

While collecting and organizing this intelligence, Xu Yunfan also attempted to sense, with his spiritual sense, the third Dao Fruit that could theoretically serve as a harmonizing agent.

The Yin Dark Nether Dragon Dao Fruit from the Samsara Sea of Bitterness.

This Dao Fruit was of the utmost Yin and coldness, governing reflection and tranquility, forming a stark Yin-Yang opposition to the violent destruction of the Divine Xiao.

If he could use the soft, Yin-natured power of the Yin Dark Nether Dragon Dao Fruit to harmonize the utmost Yang and firmness of the Divine Xiao, and then use the pure Yang fire of the Scarlet Sun True Lord's Dao Fruit to mediate or catalyze, he could initially form a triangular cycle of Yin, Divine Xiao, and Scarlet Sun, laying an supreme Dao foundation.

However, no matter how he activated his Divine Xiao Golden Core, or how his spiritual sense extended towards the direction of the elusive Samsara Sea of Bitterness, it was like a stone sinking into the ocean, yielding no results.

The Samsara Sea of Bitterness was mysterious and unpredictable, isolating the inside from the outside. It was difficult to explore without going there in person.

"It seems the trip to the Samsara Sea of Bitterness can only be put on hold for now, to be left for another day."

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly and refocused his attention on the Scarlet Sun Dao Fruit before him.

A direct confrontation would certainly lead to being ganged up on, so Xu Yunfan naturally had to plan carefully.

Could he borrow the power of the Bodhisattva Pure Land? The Scarlet Sun True Lord had a blood feud with the Bodhisattva Pure Land and was an out-and-out mortal enemy.

If he could cleverly use the Bodhisattva Pure Land's hatred for the Scarlet Sun True Lord to provoke or intensify the conflict between the two sides, or even create an opportunity for the experts of the Bodhisattva Pure Land to heavily injure the Scarlet Sun True Lord at all costs, he could then fish in troubled waters.

But this required precise intelligence and a grasp of timing.

Moreover, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect was not a monolithic bloc.

The conflict between the Scarlet Sun True Lord and the Vast Ancient Heavenly Light True Lord of the North Pole Peak was a breakthrough point.

If he could find a way to intensify the conflict between them, provoke an internal struggle, or use the hand of the North Pole True Lord to weaken the Scarlet Sun, that would also be an excellent strategy.

The Scarlet Sun True Lord had a violent temperament; the firmer he was, the easier he would break. This was his weakness.

If he could find something or someone he cared about, or a key point in his cultivation, that would be the best time to act.

At the same time, could he establish some sort of tacit cooperation with the Insightful True Lord, or even the Pure Yang Ancestor who had taught him techniques and protected him?

After all, within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the distinction between the direct disciples and the common disciples was very clear.

Of course, cooperating with the Pure Yang Ancestor carried immense risk. His identity was sensitive, and it could easily trigger a conflict between the two sects, so he had to be extremely cautious.

Xu Yunfan was not impatient. He knew well that a Golden Core True Lord had a long lifespan, and a Dao struggle was a protracted affair.

Stabilizing his own realm and increasing his strength were the fundamentals.

Just as Xu Yunfan was devoting himself to his schemes, he naturally敏锐地 (keenly) sensed that the vast aura of the Insightful True Lord, which had originally been stationed at the Mysterious Evil Mountain like a nine-fiendish nether evil observing all thoughts, had vanished without a trace.
