# Chapter 78: The Bait!

One ship, however, was particularly unique. It was a streamlined warship made of silver metal, exuding a strong futuristic, technological vibe. Its style was so distinct from the other vessels that Zhou Tian knew without a doubt it hailed from the Instrument Nation.

People nearby watched their group.

"The Eight States Grand Competition is about to begin again," someone whispered. The Grand Competition was no secret; almost everyone who had lived in Heavenly Pass for a long time knew about it.

"The God-Forsaken Land is going to become their hunting ground again!" a warrior muttered, having just disembarked from an ancient ship. His battle armor was tattered, and a scar ran from his temple to his nostril, containing a mysterious power that prevented it from healing naturally.

As they approached the ancient ship belonging to the Heavenly Qin, a tassel drifted down from it, forming a staircase directly to the ship's deck. Zhou Ying led the way, and the group boarded the ancient ship.

"Second Brother, where are the others?" Zhou Tian asked, looking left and right but not finding Tian Ling.

"Zhou Yan, Wu Peihong, and Wei Chuan went to lead the others. They should be arriving soon," Zhou Ying said, standing at the bow and watching the bustling crowd below.

On the other ancient ships, people continuously boarded. Zhou Tian didn't recognize most of them, though he did recognize a fair number from the Grand Luo Academy: Zi Qing, Iron Ox, and those who had followed Jun Feng to cause trouble for them that day.

There was also a familiar face among the Instrument Nation's team – a heroic and vibrant young woman in a black, tight-fitting battle suit. Her shapely figure was undeniable, drawing many gazes. Zhou Tian remembered her clearly as she was the first person eliminated in the elite competition that day.

"Why don't we wait until that fierce beast passes before setting off? It'll still be dangerous to depart now, won't it?" Sun Dao asked during the waiting period, a strange glint in his eyes, as if guessing something.

"That fierce beast is still some distance away from us. If we continue to wait, unforeseen changes might occur," Zhou Ying replied flatly, her face devoid of expression.

Far-fetched, perfunctory!

Even Zhou Tian could hear the forced and perfunctory nature in Zhou Ying's words, let alone Sun Dao. However, Sun Dao didn't question further but instead exchanged glances with Zhang Yi, completing a bizarre form of communication.

Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui also exchanged a look. Zhou Tian didn't understand what Zhou Zui was trying to convey, yet Zhou Zui seemed to comprehend the meaning in Zhou Tian's eyes, a meaning even Zhou Tian himself didn't grasp, and nodded in profound agreement. This left Zhou Tian with no choice but to nod in a similar, seemingly understanding manner.

After waiting for half an incense stick of time, Zhou Yan led a group of eight people out from Heavenly Pass. Tian Ling was prominently among them, as were Zi Xu and the young man from the Hao Tian Sect. Zhou Tian didn't recognize the rest.

Zhou Yan boarded the ancient ship, standing beside Zhou Ying, his hands clasped behind his back. He said nothing, his gaze fixed on the distant, immense void storm.

Something was wrong, terribly wrong!

Zhou Tian felt an increasing sense of unease. What exactly was happening? This was the first time he had ever seen such an expression on Zhou Yan's face.

"Zhou Tian, what's going on?" Tian Ling stepped forward, her delicate brows slightly furrowed, a worried expression on her face.

"It's nothing, just a void beast passing through, so the departure time was moved up," Zhou Tian reassured Tian Ling. The people Zhou Yan brought didn't ask him for an explanation; the gap in their statuses was simply too great, requiring them to weigh their words carefully.

Not long after, Wu Peihong and Wei Chuan arrived with the remaining individuals. Among them was the 'Exiled Immortal,' who had left a deep impression on Zhou Tian. He moved with an ethereal grace, like a true immortal. Even amidst the other contemporary heroes, he still stood out prominently, making Nan Qing beside him seem dim in comparison.

With everyone having boarded the ancient ship, all the Heavenly Qin participants had arrived. Zhou Tian counted sixty-three people in total, all young, representing the current generation of Heavenly Qin's finest talents.

Many people spontaneously formed groups upon boarding, gathering in threes and fives, clearly forming their own small cliques.

Although the Heavenly Qin contingent was complete, the representatives from other powers had yet to arrive. After another short wait, as Vorman led the last group onto the Instrument Nation's warship, all the ancient ships emitted a hazy glow. Beast-skin sails unfurled on their three masts, runes glowing upon them, and a divine light barrier was erected.

The ancient ships' hulls subtly trembled, slowly lifting off. All the silver patterns on their bodies lit up, and with a rattling sound, runic chains extended, linking the seven ancient ships and the Instrument Nation's warship together, forming a complex formation. They then set off towards the vast, boundless continent ahead.

As the Eight States departed, outside Heavenly Pass City, some individuals pulled out various statues from their pockets – some were judges with twelve wings on their backs, others were demons engulfed in infernal flames; their forms varied.

What they all had in common was their fervent expressions as they muttered to themselves:
"Our Father in Heaven…"
"The Destroyer of Old…"
"…"

Deep within Heavenly Pass, the eight Guardian Envoys watched this scene through their crystal orbs, their gazes chilling. Indeed, it was the remnants of the Ancient God Realm causing trouble.

"The big figures are all watching. This time, we'll uproot them completely!" the Instrument Nation's Guardian Envoy declared imperiously. These people had been hiding like rats since their defeat in ancient times, stirring up trouble in the shadows.

"They must have come prepared this time, so we mustn't be careless," the Fool's Guardian Envoy mused, thinking more deeply.

"With Heavenly Pass here, how much trouble can they really cause?" Daoist Ming Zhen said, he being the Dao Alliance's Guardian Envoy stationed there.

"We just have to wait for the masterminds to show themselves. All the young generation of the Eight States, what a grand bait. How big of a fish can it catch?" Wen Hou said, implying that Zhou Tian and all the others were being used as bait for a fishing expedition.

In the Void.

After the ancient ships had set off, Zhou Yan had everyone enter the ship's cabins. There was nothing to see outside amidst the void storm anyway, so standing out there was pointless.

Though the God-Forsaken Land appeared close enough to "run a horse to death looking at it" (a Chinese idiom meaning seemingly close but actually far), that was only because of its immense size. Despite the ancient ships' incredible speed, it would still take a week to traverse the void storm and reach the God-Forsaken Land.

In an unknown place within the endless void storm.

"They have departed."

A majestic voice rang out, accompanied by boundless light. Six pairs of colossal wings unfurled, sacred light flowing, and an endless divine realm floated around the being. Chants echoed throughout the void.

"Everything is ready."

A figure completely enveloped in a black robe appeared. Gurgling water sounds arose as muddy, turbid river water flowed from beneath his feet into the void. Fiery red Higanbana flowers bloomed along the riverbed, entirely unaffected by the raging void storm.

"They will pay for what they did to us, sooner or later!"

Another voice reverberated through the void storm, clearly audible, yet no strange phenomena accompanied it.

There was no response, and no more voices emerged.

The light faded, the Higanbana flowers withered, and the void returned to silence.
