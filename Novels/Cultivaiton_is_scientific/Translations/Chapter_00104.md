# Chapter 104: Re-examination

Standing before the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion, Li Shiming was momentarily stunned—the entrance was shrouded in a dense fog. To enter, one would have to navigate through this misty barrier.

"Is this the first test of the examination?" he wondered to himself.

The fog posed no real challenge to him, as it was merely a simple Five Elements Confusion Array—the very same formation he had been preparing to set up with his Five Elements Array Flags.

Inside the pavilion, a middle-aged man, handsome in appearance, was reading a book while simultaneously observing the situation outside through his spiritual sense. The Five Elements Confusion Array at the entrance was his first hurdle for examinees. If someone couldn't even break through the simplest of arrays, they had no business taking the examination. Moreover, he had no desire to be disturbed by amateurs. Being assigned to guard the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion was already unfortunate enough; having to examine ignorant juniors was the last thing he wanted to do.

"This kid's in for some trouble," the middle-aged man muttered to himself, shaking his head.

Li Shiming's method of entering the array was vastly different from conventional techniques—it was as if he knew nothing about formations at all. He simply walked straight into the Five Elements Confusion Array without any finesse.

The Five Elements Confusion Array was the most basic of formations, lacking any offensive capabilities. It merely disoriented those who entered, causing them to wander aimlessly. Those with good luck might find their way back out the way they came, while the unlucky would remain trapped until rescued.

Of course, as a simple formation, there was another way to break the Five Elements Confusion Array—by using brute force. The ordinary array flags used in this formation couldn't withstand powerful spiritual attacks, and if destroyed, the formation would collapse. However, this method wouldn't earn one a pass in the primary formation master examination, and attempting it on Dui Peak would likely result in never leaving the peak alive.

Li Shiming, however, wasn't wandering blindly. His eyes clearly discerned the spiritual energy lines, and each step he took carefully avoided them. Simple formations had more flaws—flaws that might not be apparent to others but were glaringly obvious to him. The operation of the Five Elements Confusion Array unfolded exactly as he had anticipated.

"Hmm, this kid's got some skill!" The middle-aged man's interest was piqued, and he set down his book.

Li Shiming walked straight through the Five Elements Confusion Array step by step. The middle-aged man didn't believe this was mere coincidence. With a flick of his finger, the man sent a formation disk flying toward Li Shiming, activating it instantly.

"Let's see if you can break this Minor Nine Palaces Illusion Array," he murmured with a raised eyebrow.

Li Shiming's steps faltered as countless towering trees appeared before him, their canopies blotting out the sky.

His formation knowledge wasn't derived from the Tianhai Sect's system, so he wasn't familiar with their formations. However, the fundamentals of formations were universal. After only a brief pause, he resumed walking without hesitation. His steps varied in speed—sometimes fast, sometimes slow—as if he were merely taking a leisurely stroll, yet he soon emerged from the Minor Nine Palaces Illusion Array.

The middle-aged man was tempted to throw out an even more complex formation disk, but remembering that this was an examination and not a formation duel, he restrained himself. His gaze at Li Shiming was complex—the boy's method of breaking formations was bizarre. Even as the master of the formation, he couldn't have done it as effortlessly as Li Shiming had.

Once might be coincidence, but twice was talent—extraordinary talent in formations.

"Greetings, Uncle-Master!" Li Shiming bowed respectfully upon seeing the only cultivator in the hall, sensing the pressure unique to Foundation Establishment cultivators emanating from him.

"You've passed. Present your identity jade slip," the middle-aged man said with a smile.

Li Shiming was momentarily taken aback before realizing that the two formations he had just navigated were the examination content. He retrieved his identity jade slip and handed it over. The middle-aged man took it, produced a new one, performed some operations, and returned the updated slip to him.

"Your identity jade slip now grants you the privileges of a primary formation master. Within a thousand li of the Nine Peaks, you can connect to the sect's grand formation through your jade slip to receive formation-related tasks. The rewards are quite substantial if you perform well," the middle-aged man explained with a smile.

Examining the new jade slip, Li Shiming noticed that all his original information remained intact. However, this slip was clearly more refined, crafted from superior materials. Only now did he truly grasp the difference in status between a formation master and others. Even as an intermediate spirit farmer, his identity jade slip hadn't been upgraded. Yet, upon becoming a primary formation master, he immediately received a superior one—a stark contrast.

"Additionally, you don't need to exchange merit points for formation knowledge in the Scripture Pavilion. You can directly use your jade slip to exchange merit points for relevant knowledge. Not all of this knowledge is collected by the sect—much of it consists of research findings by individual formation masters. If you wish to learn, you'll need to pay the corresponding price," the middle-aged man continued.

"Thank you for the information, Uncle-Master," Li Shiming said gratefully.

*Boom!*

The entire formation trembled violently, followed by an overwhelming, terrifying aura soaring out from within the sect. Thanks to his body-tempering training, Li Shiming managed to stay on his feet.

The middle-aged man's expression also darkened, his eyes filled with shock as he looked toward the sky.

"What's happened? Elder Quan himself has taken action!" he muttered under his breath.

Though his voice was soft, Li Shiming heard it clearly. Elders were the highest authority in the Tianhai Sect, surpassing even Foundation Establishment cultivators. Normally, elders didn't involve themselves in sect affairs—even the sect leader was merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator, highlighting the elders' supreme status. Only matters concerning the sect's survival or affairs at the elder level would prompt their intervention.

"Don't leave yet. Stay inside the pavilion," the middle-aged man said sternly to Li Shiming.

Having reviewed Li Shiming's records, he knew the boy's cave dwelling was outside the Nine Peaks. With the current situation unclear, he didn't want a promising formation talent to come to harm. Even if an elder-level battle were to occur, Dui Peak would remain unaffected.

"Yes, Uncle-Master," Li Shiming replied with a bow.

"My surname is Zhuge. You may call me Uncle-Master Zhuge," the man said while monitoring the situation outside through the grand formation.

After Elder Quan departed, the grand formation provided no useful feedback—a good sign, indicating no elder-level battles within the sect's waters. The Nine Peaks' protective formation could monitor intense spiritual fluctuations within a thousand li of the sect. Battles at the Foundation Establishment level would be detected immediately if they occurred within this range, let alone those at the elder level.

After waiting for about the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Uncle-Master Zhuge received a transmission, and his expression relaxed.

"You may leave now," he said, waving his hand dismissively.

"Uncle-Master Zhuge, what happened?" Li Shiming asked curiously after taking a few steps, unable to resist turning back.

"An elder from another sect arrived unexpectedly. Elder Quan didn't restrain his aura when leaving, startling the grand formation," Uncle-Master Zhuge replied with a smile, seemingly unbothered by the question—perhaps due to the rarity of formation masters.

Li Shiming bowed to Uncle-Master Zhuge before leaving the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion. Riding his paper crane, he pondered the recent events. The sudden arrival of an outside elder struck him as suspicious—it was too coincidental. Just yesterday, Baili Jinyan had met his end, and today an elder from another sect came looking. Judging by Baili Jinyan's storage bracelet, it couldn't have been provided by an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator. Perhaps there truly was a powerful elder behind him.

Li Shiming reminded himself to stay calm. Baili Jinyan's abduction of him had been conducted in secret, and their conflict had occurred entirely within the Dragon-Sealing, Phoenix-Locking Formation, leaving no traces. Moreover, the uninhabited island where the conflict took place had been destroyed, followed by continuous heavy rain—virtually erasing all evidence.

He considered whether Baili Jinyan's backer could trace events to the uninhabited island. Yet, locating the exact spot in the vast ocean where Baili Jinyan had last appeared—especially with the formation's concealment—was nearly impossible.

Reassuring himself repeatedly, Li Shiming returned to Eagle Beak Island. Everything there was normal. Forcing himself to put aside his worries, he proceeded as if nothing had happened, focusing on his tasks.

First, he studied the *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art*, placing the jade slip against his forehead to record its contents into his IBMz15.

The *Gentle Breeze Brings Rain Art* created a rain cloud that showered spiritual rain, providing plants with the spiritual water and vitality they needed to grow. The *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art* was an advanced version, requiring a high level of mastery of its predecessor. The technique built upon the foundation of the *Gentle Breeze Brings Rain Art*, even including its contents at the beginning of the jade slip.

The *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art* also formed a rain cloud, but the spiritual rain descended as a fine mist, ensuring not a drop was wasted as it settled on the spirit plants. Combined with the technique's inherently higher grade, the effectiveness of the spiritual rain was significantly enhanced.

Li Shiming examined the essence of the *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art*, which embodied the concept of *"The wind steals in night, unseen, unheard; It moistens all things gently, without a sound."* The jade slip even included an essence diagram—a visual aid to better grasp the technique's essence. The diagram, painted in ink, depicted spring rain gently nourishing all things, its artistic conception profound and far-reaching.

Yet, Li Shiming felt that the diagram paled in comparison to the videos stored in his IBMz15. Retrieving footage of drizzling spring rain and time-lapse videos of plants flourishing under such rain, he immersed his senses in the scenes. He felt the soft patter of rain, the joy of the plants, and the earth's revival.

Unsurprisingly, he grasped the essence of the *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art*. Drawing the Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things rune with his finger, dark clouds gathered over the five acres of spirit fields—indeed, over the entirety of Eagle Beak Island.

Only now had he truly become an intermediate spirit farmer. Uncle-Master Cheng of the Thunder Rain Pavilion had merely granted him the title, allowing him to learn the sect's advanced spirit farming techniques. Mastery of the *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art*—the foundational technique for intermediate spirit farmers—was required for official recognition.

Once he returned to the Thunder Rain Pavilion to certify his mastery, his status would be updated, granting him access to intermediate spirit farmer tasks.

Though the dark clouds covered a vast area, Li Shiming could precisely control the spiritual rain within them. At his will, the rain descended not as droplets but as a fine mist. Like sentient beings, the mist gathered around the spirit plants on the island—primarily aromatic plants and the Bamboo of Talismanic Spirits.

Beside the Bamboo of Talismanic Spirits, a newly sprouted shoot emitted faint cracking sounds as it grew several inches in mere moments. The leaves of the aromatic plants also expanded noticeably. A single application of the *Gentle Breeze Nourishes All Things Art* had accelerated their growth many times over.

No wonder intermediate spirit farmers could drastically increase spirit rice yields and shorten growth cycles. The effects of this technique made such claims entirely plausible. Yet, with such capabilities, one could manage higher-quality fields and cultivate more valuable plants—why bother with relatively low-value spirit rice?

Li Shiming didn't rush back to the Thunder Rain Pavilion for certification. Having just obtained the advanced technique, doing so immediately would seem too ostentatious. Now that he had his primary formation master status, he decided to explore the available tasks first. There was no hurry to certify—he could wait a while.

As Uncle-Master Zhuge had mentioned, when Li Shiming channeled a wisp of spiritual power into his identity jade slip, he sensed it opening a special long-distance communication channel. This channel automatically delivered a series of messages—all primary formation master tasks. Selecting a task would allow him to reply directly, and the sect's grand formation would update accordingly, marking the task as accepted.

Li Shiming marveled—this was essentially a rudimentary network! Using the grand formation as a server and router, the long-distance communication channel as the network cable, and the identity jade slip as the terminal, the system formed an interactive network capable of receiving, processing, responding to, storing, and updating information.

Admittedly, this network was far less sophisticated than those from his previous life. However, considering its thousand-li coverage, this technology surpassed his past world's in terms of range. Back then, networks relied on countless base stations, each covering only a small area.
