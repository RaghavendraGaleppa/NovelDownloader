# Chapter 194: The Art of the Big Promise

"Oh? What wisdom do you have to share, old friend?" Lin Shan's curiosity was piqued by Black Skeleton Demon Lord's suggestion of an alternative way to obtain breakthrough pills for the Foundation Establishment stage.

The demon lord didn't beat around the bush. "Have you heard of high-end exchange meetings?"

"High-end... You don't mean large auction houses, do you?" Lin Shan rubbed his chin uncertainly.

"No! Auctions generally cater to low and mid-level cultivators. The truly influential figures participate in high-end exchange meetings where they barter goods directly."

Being well-traveled, Black Skeleton Demon Lord knew many secrets of the cultivation world. It claimed to have ways to locate such high-end exchange meetings in Moonview City.

Lin Shan realized the benefits of having an ancient monster by his side. He would never have dared imagine attending a gathering of Golden Core cultivators, yet the demon lord claimed it could find one.

But even if they found such a meeting, how would a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like himself gain entry?

"Where there's a will, there's a way," the demon lord said confidently. "Each exchange has its own rules—either Golden Core cultivation, a recommendation from a major faction, or proof of sufficient wealth. Who's to say?"

Assured by Moonview City's strict no-fighting policy, Black Skeleton Demon Lord proposed crafting concealment artifacts to mask Lin Shan's cultivation level for entry.

Lin Shan nodded. With over 300,000 spirit stones, his wealth surpassed some Golden Core cultivators. Though these meetings mainly dealt in barter, his assets would suffice for entry.

Yet he wondered—why was the demon lord being so helpful? What was its angle?

Following the demon lord's directions, Lin Shan found the hidden entrance to Moonview City's high-end exchange in the northern district, only to be turned away by the guards.

The exchange had three strict requirements for membership: Golden Core cultivation, a recommendation from a major faction, or being the head of a merchant association.

Proof of wealth wasn't enough—the organizers had tightened restrictions after past incidents of people borrowing assets to gain entry, only to occupy space without participating.

Lin Shan had no choice but to leave.

Back on the streets, Black Skeleton Demon Lord reassured him. "Don't despair, young friend. This isn't difficult."

"Oh? What other options do we have? We don't meet any of their three requirements."

"If there's no opportunity, we'll create one. We can't reach Golden Core overnight, and we lack major faction connections. But becoming a merchant association head... that we can manage!"

"You mean..."

"Exactly! We'll establish our own association with you as its head," the demon lord cackled.

"That's easier said than done. The exchange requires ten years of successful operation with annual profits meeting certain thresholds. You think we can fool them with some fly-by-night operation?"

Lin Shan wasn't naive—only established, reputable associations qualified.

But the demon lord remained confident: "I'm not suggesting we cut corners. I mean we should go big!"

"You're serious?!" Lin Shan was astonished. Did this skeletal creature have business acumen?

"Do you actually have this ability? First we'd need city approval and permits, then startup capital, a prime location, deciding our business focus, hiring and training staff, operations..."

"None of these are problems!" The demon lord's tone was firm.

Lin Shan was taken aback. Had this hell-traveling entity truly mastered all skills?

"You dislike hassle, always focused on cultivation," the demon lord continued. "Leave the business to me. Rent a cave abode and cultivate peacefully while I handle everything—you'll reap the profits."

The tempting proposal swayed Lin Shan. Business wasn't his interest, but having someone else manage it for profit and exchange access was ideal.

"What business did you have in mind?"

---

"Of course," the demon lord nodded. "But it requires your summoning art."

"Summoning?"

Lin Shan recalled his experiments in the Eastern Sea's Xiayi waters, where he'd contracted thousands of sea creatures—clams, scallops, shrimp, crabs, oysters, and more.

The Black and Red Twins had profited from summoning trades. Now he might follow their path, though it seemed a practical choice.

As an inland nation, Lu Country relied on imported seafood. He could summon his Eastern Sea creatures for aquaculture.

However, the demon lord didn't know about these contracts—it had joined him later. Instead, it proposed summoning the mermaid maiden from Hurricane Sea, whom Lin Shan had forcibly contracted during the demonic fleet interception.

That binding soul contract, unless broken by her reaching Golden Core, made her an ideal supplier—she could gather seafood in the Eastern Sea for them to sell fresh in Lu Country.

"Think about it—the mermaids are local powers there. They can harvest seafood effortlessly, giving us pure profit!" The demon lord's empty eye sockets gleamed with greed.

But Lin Shan knew better. The summoning contract only compelled combat assistance—he couldn't control her actions remotely. Whether she'd cooperate was uncertain, making aquaculture more reliable.

"When we passed Hurricane Sea, I killed four mermaid Foundation cultivators and enslaved their maiden. There's deep enmity between us. Getting her to fight for me is one thing, but cooperation seems unlikely."

The demon lord volunteered to negotiate, confident in its persuasive skills despite lacking a silver tongue.

"Fine, you handle it," Lin Shan said, washing his hands of the matter.

---

But the demon lord extended a bony hand—it needed startup capital.

Lin Shan wasn't concerned; his spirit stones were idle anyway. If this secured exchange access, it would be worthwhile.

After discussion, he provided 100,000 spirit stones for initial testing, promising more if successful.

Lin Shan then rented a modest cave abode in Moonview City's outskirts, perfect for maintaining a low profile. With the Void Star Disc's spiritual energy amplification, location mattered little.

For rapid cultivation, elixirs and spirit liquids were essential.

---

Preparations complete, Lin Shan summoned the mermaid maiden using his banner. She emerged from the swirling portal, her fish tail flicking as she surveyed her surroundings coldly.

"Why have you summoned me?"

Lin Shan felt awkward about their forced contract. The demon lord, however, noticed her unstable aura and fresh scale wounds.

The mermaid erupted in fury: "You humans are beasts! The most hypocritical, cruel species!"

Lin Shan was baffled until her tirade explained: After the Song Dynasty's righteous sects conquered the Eastern Sea to prevent demonic resurgence, they'd turned on local powers like her mermaid clan, forcing them into hiding.

"Small clans are meant to be bullied—such is the cultivation world's cruelty," she said bitterly.

Lin Shan exchanged glances with the demon lord. "This complicates things..."

"Actually, their desperate situation makes them need resources more than ever," the demon lord replied mentally, suggesting Lin Shan wait outside while it negotiated.

An hour later, they emerged with the mermaid announcing bluntly: "I accept—but my clan gets 70%."

"What? You just gather seafood while we handle sales, operations—we should get 70%!"

"Take it or leave it." She was immovable.

The demon lord intervened: "How about a flat rate instead of profit-sharing?"

Unversed in business, the mermaid agreed to sell "spiritual seafood" (creatures with cultivation) at twenty spirit stones per ton—an incredible bargain.

After sending her back, Lin Shan asked about profits. The demon lord indicated 70%, earning his trust to handle operations while he focused on cultivation.

They'd need local hires for sales, so they visited Moonview City's talent market. The demon lord, disguised in concealing robes to hide its nature, set up a recruitment booth.

Graduates from Lu Country's Confucian academies crowded around their advertisement:

"Longevity Fresh, Living Fresh"
"Delicious Trends, Leading Freshness"
"Thanks to Nature's Bounty"
"Lin Clan Commerce seeks talent to build tomorrow together"

Most graduates, struggling in Lu's competitive cultivation job market, were desperate for work regardless of the business.

A young graduate, Lu Xiuming, stepped forward nervously: "Examiners, I'm Lu Xiuming from Jingyang Academy. Failed the Four Treasures combat exam but have Level 2 formation mathematics and top-tier Silver Tadpole script certificates."

"That's it?" asked the robed demon lord.

"That's all..."

"Congratulations! Welcome aboard!"

The crowd was stunned—hired so easily?

Lu Xiuming asked about work hours.

"Definitely no rest Saturdays, Sundays maybe. Acceptable?"

He gritted his teeth: "Yes!" (This was standard in the industry.)

"And compensation?"

"Base 5 spirit stones monthly, plus commissions, annual bonuses, birthday gifts, monthly team-building..."

The demon lord listed benefits like city-mandated insurance, housing subsidies, and cultivation aids—all at minimum standards.

"Meal, travel, and communication stipends—one spirit stone each. Free health checks, project bonuses, counseling..."

The graduates grew excited.

"Training provided! Managers will mentor you personally!"

Lu Xiuming clenched his fists: "Amazing!"

The demon lord's finale: "Future equity shares for early employees! Become Lu Country's next partner!"

Lu Xiuming bowed deeply: "I pledge my life to the cause!"

The graduates chorused: "We pledge our lives!"

The demon lord's skeletal hand (unnoticed in the fervor) raised Lu Xiuming: "You're Lu Country's future! Work hard, and spirit stones will flow!"

Overwhelmed by recruits, they hired ten before leaving.

With suppliers, sales team, and capital secured, Lin Shan left operations to the demon lord while he cultivated using spirit liquids and studied formations with the Void Star Disc's spirit, Xiao Xin. Starforce tempering refined his spiritual energy and soul purity.

Ten years passed—his wind and thunder energies peaked, nearing mid-Foundation Establishment breakthrough. The demon lord returned with results.
