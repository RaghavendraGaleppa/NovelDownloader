# Chapter 28: Level Up!

Endless lightning descended, crushing all in its path. Yet, a mere wisp of energy blocked every bolt, silencing the thunder. There was no grand explosion of power; the sea of lightning simply vanished without a trace.

Zhou Zhan’s pupils contracted at the sight of that wisp of energy. The blurry sensation consuming his body grew even more pronounced, as if he would dissipate at any moment.

“To think you have already reached this step…”

The Saint Demon retreated from its strange state, allowing the Demon Master to regain dominance. Hearing Zhou Zhan’s words, a sinister smile appeared on the Demon Master’s face.

“A thousand years have passed; I couldn’t very well stay in the same place, could I?”

Zhou Zhan’s figure grew even more indistinct, his features almost unrecognizable. He glanced at the divine dragon, whose entire body had been corroded black, and spoke in a deep voice:

“Demon, today I cannot stop you. But if you continue to lay hands on Zhou Tian, even if you break through to that step, you will not escape the pursuit of my Zhou family!”

Having spoken, Zhou Zhan’s figure vanished from the spot. The Demon Master remained silent for a moment, then a streak of dark light shot heavenward from his hand, striking the golden eye in the sky.

Boom!

The great eye exploded, transforming into a rain of light that dissipated into the void. Only then did the Demon Master slowly speak:

“Compared to your Zhou family’s pursuit, I am more unwilling to live in such a state forever…”

He turned his gaze to the phantom of Zhou Tian floating in the center of the white lotus on the altar. A slender black needle slowly pierced the phantom Zhou Tian’s forehead. Boundless dark light radiated outwards, and the phantom of Zhou Tian shattered…

***

In the Zhou family ancestral land…

Zhou Zhan’s figure in the void vibrated, then solidified completely. His expression was grim. He wiped a trace of faint golden blood from the corner of his mouth and said in a deep voice, “To Qin King’s Manor!”

***

In the reception hall of Qin King’s Manor…

Zhou Tian looked helplessly at the person who was tirelessly explaining to him techniques for winning a girl’s affection. After all that talk, it boiled down to just two words:

Splashing money!

Zhou Tian was truly speechless. Of course, for those courtesans, splashing money would suffice. Naturally, Zhou Tian held no prejudice against them; earning money through one’s own abilities, with mutual consent, was perfectly fine. The issue was that this guy treated this common tactic as some kind of secret art that could not be divulged.

Unable to bear it any longer, Zhou Tian opened his mouth to speak.

“I…”

Just as he uttered a single word, Zhou Tian’s vision went black, and he slid from his chair onto the floor.

Inside the Immortal System’s log panel, lines of text rapidly refreshed:

[Host has suffered a soul attack!]
[Host has died!]
[Immortal System initiated!]
[Host has been resurrected!]
[Death count increased by one!]
…

“Big Brother, Big Brother, are you alright? Don’t scare me! I just came here to chat with you, how could you just die…?”

Zhou Zui’s face was ashen. He squatted beside Zhou Tian, no matter how he probed, he found that all of Zhou Tian’s life force had vanished. This meant Zhou Tian was dead…

A flash of golden light. Old Zhan, Zhou Yi, and the Qin Emperor appeared. Seeing these figures, Zhou Zui’s face grew even paler. He pointed at Zhou Tian, then at himself, opened his mouth, but couldn’t utter a single word.

*It has nothing to do with me? There were only two of us here. Zhou Tian suddenly died. If it has nothing to do with me, then who is it related to?*

Zhou Zui himself didn’t believe it. He could already foresee spending the rest of his life in the clan’s prison.

Just as Zhou Zui was filled with despair, Zhou Tian on the ground suddenly let out a soft whimper. To Zhou Zui’s wide-eyed astonishment, Zhou Tian, whom he had just confirmed had lost even his soul aura, stood up, rubbing his backside, muttering:

“What’s going on? Why does my butt hurt so much?!”

“Ah, woo…”

Zhou Zui’s emotions soared and plummeted like a rollercoaster. Tears welled up in his eyes as he rushed forward to embrace Zhou Tian, sobbing loudly. Seeing this, Zhou Tian’s heart warmed. He hadn’t expected this kid to care for him so deeply, showing such intense emotion at his resurrection.

When he had just revived, he had already seen the record of his death in the Immortal System’s log. Just like last time, it was due to a soul attack.

“Tian’er, are you alright?”

Zhou Yi stepped forward, pushing aside Zhou Zui’s antics, and asked Zhou Tian.

“I’m fine! What could possibly happen to me?”

Zhou Tian pretended as if nothing had happened. His state of death was, in fact, instantaneous. And in that instant, only Zhou Zui detected the disappearance of his vital signs. By the time Zhou Zhan and the others arrived, he had already revived, and his soul lamp, which could detect his life state, was gone. In truth, these three didn’t know that Zhou Tian had already died once.

Zhou Zhan frowned slightly. *Could it be that the Saint Demon listened to his words? Did not make a move?*

***

On the other side, just after the phantom of Zhou Tian’s soul vanished, the Demon Master’s face revealed a smile. However, seeing the two black-robed figures standing beside him still looking grave, he asked curiously:

“It succeeded, why aren’t you happy?”

One of the black-robed figures explained, “Demon Master, it was the same situation last time, but Zhou Tian did not die.”

“Oh…”

The Demon Master paused slightly. Just then, a considerable amount of Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus essence remaining in the void rippled faintly. White lotuses bloomed anew, and a phantom of Zhou Tian once again appeared in the center of a white lotus…

Seeing this scene, the Demon Master narrowed his eyes slightly. *Interesting, truly interesting!*

With a wave of his hand, demonic energy surged. The great formation, shattered by his fierce battle with Zhou Zhan, lit up with light once more. The void fractured, and countless亡魂 (wandering souls/ghosts) appeared. In an instant, a slender black needle reformed. This time, without the protection of the dragon qi of providence, the black needle met no resistance. It pierced directly into the phantom Zhou Tian’s forehead, and the phantom Zhou Tian exploded again…

And this time, they waited for a long time, but no new phantom of Zhou Tian formed within the Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus essence…

***

Back here, before Zhou Tian could even say a few words, his vision went black again, and he fell stiffly to the ground.

[Host has suffered a soul attack!]
[Host has died!]
[Immortal System initiated!]
[No resurrection attempts remaining. Resurrection time postponed!]
[Death count increased by one!]
[Host leveled up, skill point gained!]
…

“Tian’er!”

Zhou Yi roared, catching Zhou Tian. His aura fluctuated wildly, an boundless sea of blood seemed to surge around him, and his imposing aura soared into the sky. Countless powerful experts in the Imperial Capital turned their gazes towards Qin King’s Manor, wondering what had happened.

Zhou Zui was once again dumbfounded. In his perception, Zhou Tian had lost his vital signs again. He couldn’t help but murmur:

“How could you die *again*?!”

Instantly, three figures surrounded him. Zhou Yi was shrouded in a bloody aura, like an ancient blood demon, his eyes glowing with an eerie red. He demanded:

“What do you mean ‘die *again*’?”

Zhou Zui swallowed, trembling as he stammered, “Rep-report to all uncles, just… just now… Zhou Tian already… died once, but… he came back to life…”

Although he spoke haltingly, he managed to recount the events in a concise manner, terrified that if he said too much, Zhou Yi would tear him apart…

“Second Brother, calm down. Remember the last time the soul lamp rekindled? Perhaps there’s still a turn of events!”

The Qin Emperor placed a hand on Zhou Yi’s shoulder. Golden runes flickered, helping Zhou Yi stabilize his emotions.
