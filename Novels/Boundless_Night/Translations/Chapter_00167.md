# Chapter 167: Unpredictable

"He was actually heavily injured." Li Qingyun's complexion was ruddy, his hair sparkling white. Usually a very calm person, he now wore an expression of disbelief.

It was unimaginable just how powerful Cao Qianqiu was! The news of his injury had shocked even Grandfather Li.

Meng Xinghai even considered it a major event.

Upon hearing all this, Qin Ming truly felt Cao Qianqiu's status and power, like a towering mountain standing in the clouds, pressing down on the hearts of all factions.

At the same time, his heart was far from calm.

He had come from that very place; what exactly did Black and White Mountain hold?

Cao Qianqiu, whose power was profound enough to defy creation, causing all sides to be wary, had actually hit a wall there.

This time, he didn't break through, nor did he shatter it. Was there truly a formidable figure in that region?

Qin Ming looked back at the path he had traveled; had he missed something?

"Could there be a reclusive senior?" he mused.

Five hundred years ago, Black and White Mountain was once a forbidden land that made all factions tremble in fear. Then, for unknown reasons, it collapsed overnight, falling into decline and becoming a desolate wasteland.

Were there un-dead masters from the old era?

"At such a time, we should have a drink of fine wine," Meng Xinghai said with a smile, ordering servants to bring out luminous cups and Golden Haze Wine.

Li Qingyun took a shallow sip of the beautiful wine, which shimmered with iridescent light, and asked, "Are there more specific details?"

Meng Xinghai replied, "An old friend from the mountains sent a message. He didn't dare approach, but he heard from other strange beings that Cao Qianqiu was stumbling, needing his disciples to support him as he walked."

Qin Ming's heart surged. Such an overbearing figure being injured to this extent? It seemed he had truly encountered a formidable opponent!

Li Qingyun said, "It's going to get lively now. Will anyone go to that region to hunt the injured Cao Qianqiu? For so many years, he has remained at his peak, invincible."

"I expect a storm to brew," Meng Xinghai remarked.

Qin Ming naturally hoped that Cao Qianqiu would not be able to leave Black and White Mountain. That old fellow was too dangerous; even an accidental glance at him could lead to being instantly grabbed and killed.

But which master was it who made a move?

"Even if that area is mysterious, it's highly likely related to god-like creatures, not humans," Qin Ming pondered.

The current mountain lord, that white-furred monster, had once wept at a grave there, kowtowing and offering sacrifices devoutly. It was said that the old tomb contained the remains of a strange being.

Soon, the news spread, causing a huge sensation!

Cao Qianqiu's injury indeed shook all factions. The name Black and White Mountain, dormant for many years, had its files once again placed on the desks of many major powers.

All this was irrelevant to Qin Ming now; the struggles of the great figures were still too far removed from him.

"'Five Thunder Organ Refinement' is quite profound!" After calming down, Qin Ming began to study the book, deeply captivated.

He had first heard of it at the Luofu Mountain ruins, never expecting to acquire it today.

It could strengthen one's inner self, and it seemed it could be used in conjunction with his Purple Mansion Thunderflame.

Unfortunately, the handwritten copy of "Five Thunder Organ Refinement," imbued with the scent of ink, had no emotional residue, so Qin Ming couldn't determine who had gifted the book.

"The fusion of thunder and fire, the meeting of dragon and tiger, refining the great elixir within—perhaps it can truly be achieved in the future," Qin Ming felt after studying the book; it was a highly valuable supplement.

Within his internal organs, five-colored mists flowed, followed by intertwining lightning, rumbling outwards and startling the dozing Yuque, who flapped its wings and flew up, almost hitting the ceiling beam.

"Mountain Lord, your stomach is truly wide enough to sail a boat—even your internal organs are connected to lightning!" it said with an expression of admiration.

Qin Ming looked at it and asked, "Do you have any inheritances?"

It sighed, "Bird life is tough. I only have the most rudimentary techniques from the great mountain, the kind everyone knows. Even though I, little sparrow, possess divinity, to rise, I can only rely on physical mutation."

"I'll teach you two scriptures," Qin Ming said, writing down the incomplete "Black Roc Scripture" he had obtained from the Divine Cataclysm Plains.

"Heavens and Earth! It's actually a Roc clan cultivation method! I, little sparrow, am practically crying tears of joy, wishing I could master it immediately to repay the Mountain Lord!" Yuque was incredibly excited, doing somersaults and pointing one wing to the sky, passionately declaring its eternal loyalty to the Mountain Lord.

"I also have a cultivation method from another exotic bird, a brocade sparrow quite similar to a phoenix..."

Before Qin Ming could finish, Yuque became dizzy, feeling that the happiness was too intense. It was as if it were drunk, almost falling to the ground.

Another sentence from Qin Ming, however, made it freeze instantly and completely calm down.

"Your current strength is still weak. Cultivate here in Scarlet Mist City for now. I'm about to embark on a long journey, and the places I'm going are very dangerous. Something might happen to you if you follow me."

"Mountain Lord, are you going on another journey alone?" Yuque looked at him eagerly.

Qin Ming nodded and said, "After I impart these two scriptures to you, you should focus on improving yourself here."

"Alas, little sparrow's strength is too weak," Yuque sighed in disappointment, silently memorizing the two scriptures, preparing to cultivate diligently from then on.

Qin Ming was indeed worried that it might accidentally die if it followed him. As his strength increased, the level of his opponents also continuously rose. If a fierce battle were to occur, a flicker of spiritual consciousness or an arrow imbued with divine wisdom from an opponent could claim Yuque's life.

He comforted it, "Cultivate well. Maybe you'll be the next lord of Black and White Mountain. You won't have to keep calling others 'Mountain Lord'."

Currently, Qin Ming already had a destination in mind — Kunling.

Soon, he would head to that special region located between the three great imperial dynasties: Yu, Qian, and Rui.

There were numerous academies, Daoist temples, blessed lands, and even incredibly dangerous forbidden lands, all with their own significance, filled with various legends and possessing immense backgrounds.

In Qin Ming's current state, there was no need for him to confine himself to a single sect.

Kunling not only bordered the three great dynasties but also had close ties with esoteric sects and lands beyond the mundane world.

As long as various libraries were open to Qin Ming, it didn't matter where he went; studying all kinds of scriptures brought him the greatest benefits.

Before his long journey, Qin Ming had a small gathering with Wu Zheng, Xu Sheng, and Sister Fangfang.

"At first, I was indeed just teasing Zheng Maoze, but later, I vaguely felt something was wrong. There was an aura about him that only old traveling merchants would have," Xu Sheng informed him, feeling that Zheng Maoze might have developed a "condition."

Qin Ming was lost in thought. Logically speaking, the lands beyond the mundane world were full of masters; if Zheng Maoze had a problem, it should have been detected immediately.

Or perhaps, after Zheng Maoze came out this time, he had just become entangled with something inexplicable? Immediately, his heart tightened. Could it be that the great centipede wasn't completely dead?

He frowned. Normally, that wouldn't be the case. Four old seniors had hunted the god together, leaving it no chance at all.

Qin Ming shook his head, thinking he was overthinking. If there really was a problem, having taken so much divinity, the karma would be immense, and that "great existence" would definitely come for him first.

The few of them drank until they were slightly tipsy, then clamored to enter the mountains. They had previously teamed up multiple times to search for spiritual materials in the mountains, but each time they returned disheveled and empty-handed.

"I still remember that gray-robed person intercepting our snow lotus! It's infuriating!" Zhou Lin was so angry she was about to start cursing again.

Qin Ming also thought of that person. He had seen that figure later but couldn't catch up. Now, he felt an impulse to go into the mountains and apprehend him!

Subsequently, the group entered the mountains, with Yuque following along. Soon, it went to socialize with the birds in the mountains, inquiring if there was such a person who liked to intercept treasures.

The result was unexpected: they immediately received an answer. It was a grey organization that specialized in such activities, but they wouldn't offend people to the point of no return—they robbed for wealth but didn't kill.

That day, Qin Ming, Xu Sheng, and the others destroyed that stronghold in the mountains, obtaining quite a lot of Daygold and other spiritual materials.

Zhou Lin finally stopped cursing, returning with a beaming smile this time.

Qin Ming only took some Daygold; the spiritual materials here were not of a high enough grade and were already useless to him.

Yuque and Wu Zheng's eyes were both eager, and Xu Sheng and Zhou Lin were also very happy, having reaped great rewards.

That very day, a piece of news arrived that caused all factions' expressions to freeze: Cao Qianqiu was not injured at all. That old fellow was purely fishing, and instead, he had killed two powerful experts who had possessed others and gone after him.

"That old immortal!" Many people were disappointed.

It was reported that Cao Qianqiu had recently had a sudden premonition, detecting a hint of abnormality and believing someone intended to harm him, which was why he had deliberately "shown weakness" to lure his enemies this time.

"Reaching that level, is it truly so terrifying?" Qin Ming was lost in thought. Could those old seniors sense impending events in advance?

"Those old fellows at that level, the ones at the very forefront, are indeed outrageous," Li Qingyun sighed.

However, the next day, another piece of news arrived, making everyone's expressions even more fascinating.

After Cao Qianqiu killed the two possessed experts, he truly encountered an accident. His sudden premonition... had miscalculated its target.

Meng Xinghai said, "People from the Pure Land Beyond confirmed it. This time it's real. Old Cao ran back overnight to recuperate from his injuries."

"What exactly happened?" Qin Ming was very eager to know.

"Still in Black and White Mountain..."

Cao Qianqiu had indeed wandered around Black and White Mountain with certain objectives, wanting to find something. He had previously inquired with locals about various situations and asked about unusual legends.

In a village, a very enthusiastic old man told Cao Qianqiu about a bizarre incident he encountered in his youth: a kite he flew had returned stained with blood.

When Qin Ming heard this, it felt quite familiar, because he had also heard this story!

Could this be Old Liu enthusiastically pointing the way?

Soon, Qin Ming learned that Cao Qianqiu's incident occurred near Twin Trees Village.

It was said that after understanding the situation, his spiritual consciousness transformed directly into a blazing red sun, ascending into the night sky to meticulously explore the entire area.

But not long after, he let out a muffled groan, the brilliant great sun instantly dimmed, rapidly plummeting, and then he took his disciples and fled overnight.

"This isn't fake again, is it?" Li Qingyun was suspicious. By now, he was somewhat doubting if Cao Qianqiu was luring enemies for a second time.

Meng Xinghai shook his head, saying, "This time it's not false. People within the Pure Land who are at odds with him have confirmed it. He is indeed injured, but his problem isn't particularly serious. Moreover, he himself declared that no external enemy could heavily injure him."

Qin Ming really wanted to understand what that old fellow had encountered.

Cao Qianqiu did not reveal the hidden truth, merely stating that anyone who didn't believe could investigate it themselves.

That night, as Qin Ming fell into a deep sleep, he suddenly felt a chilling sensation. He abruptly opened his eyes, then realized something was amiss.

He felt as if his consciousness had left his physical body, about to merge into a vast, dark fog.

He tried to rush back into his body but couldn't. He had already touched his flesh and blood but couldn't return, being pulled away by an unknown force. At the last moment, his consciousness only managed to grab an object "in hand."

After that, he completely drifted away from his physical body.

"This great fog..." Qin Ming's heart was alarmed. Back at the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, he had seen boundless black fog appearing behind Lu Zizai and the Six Imperial Patriarchs' physical bodies. Within that fog, terrifying giants corresponding to those two individuals radiated golden light.

He felt that he had entered a similar black fog!
