# Chapter 44: The Proud Dragon's Remorse

Magistrate Feng and Zhou Qing exchanged pleasantries and quickly became familiar, addressing each other as "worthy brother" as if they were old friends. Initially, Magistrate Feng had worried that Zhou Qing, being young, might be arrogant and difficult to get along with.  

To his surprise, the newly crowned Provincial Champion was so approachable, utterly unlike that old man Squire Zhang, whose presence in the same room made Magistrate Feng increasingly irritated with each passing moment.  

As their conversation deepened, Magistrate Feng found himself so in sync with Zhou Qing that he wished they could share a bed that very night, discussing their life aspirations. He envisioned how they might support each other in official circles in the future, creating a heartwarming tale.  

If only he had brought some yellow wine and chicken heads—they could have sworn brotherhood right then.  

Remembering that the chief and deputy examiners were waiting for the Provincial Champion, Magistrate Feng reluctantly urged Zhou Qing to change into formal attire, saying:  

"Worthy brother, we've become fast friends. I have a vacant house on East Gate Street—three courtyards with three rooms each. Though not spacious, it's clean. I'd like to gift it to you. Jiangzhou has barbaric customs, while Changzhou offers peace. I hear you're still unmarried—why not find a good match here in Changzhou? Settle down here and leave your rural properties to servants. That way, I can seek your advice often."  

Zhou Qing excused himself to change clothes, deftly sidestepping the offer.  

His policy was simple: don't initiate, don't refuse, don't commit.  

After changing into his champion's regalia, Zhou Qing—now a trained martial artist with what his past life would call a "model's physique"—looked impeccable in the formal attire. Magistrate Feng nodded approvingly: truly the reincarnation of the Literary Star, unmatched by ordinary men.  

Thinking of Squire Zhang's unresolved case, Magistrate Feng mused:  

"How can I leave loose ends for my worthy brother on his joyous day? So what if the Transport Commissioner pressures me? Justice resides in human hearts—should it bend to power?"  

A righteous energy coursed through Magistrate Feng from head to toe.  

This wasn't his usual demeanor—likely influenced by the virtuous aura of his "worthy brother's" essays. Though he hadn't read them, he felt their essence.  

It's never too late to become a good official.  

Riding through the streets on horseback, Zhou Qing was followed by a golden "Provincial Champion" plaque, flanked by crowds eager to bask in his auspicious aura.  

Becoming the Provincial Champion meant his name would headline this year's imperial examination records. Future historians would refer to the Bingzi Provincial Examination as the "Zhou Qing List."  

Parading through the streets in celebration, Zhou Qing reflected on his destitute state when he first transmigrated—it felt like a lifetime ago, too complex for words.  

His mood suddenly resonated with Meng Jiao's poem about passing the imperial exams:  

"Past humiliations need no mention,  
Today's freedom knows no bounds;  

Riding swift through Changzhou's spring breeze,  
I see all its flowers in one day."  

Altering one character to fit the scene, Zhou Qing internalized this sentiment, storing it for later transcription to strengthen his literary spirit. For now, though exhilarated, he refrained from reciting it aloud.  

After the initial excitement, Zhou Qing soberly recognized:  

How did a sixteen-year-old become Provincial Champion?  

Undoubtedly, unseen blades and shadows awaited him.  

"The topmost line: the proud dragon will have cause to repent."  

This line from the Book of Changes echoed in his mind.  

The peak often precedes decline. At moments of greatest triumph, one most easily oversteps—inviting disaster.  

Now at his zenith, caution was paramount.  

Only by avoiding arrogance and impetuousness could he endure.  

Follower Fushong observed Zhou Qing from behind, initially joyous for him but then concerned about the dangers of flying too high too young.  

A teenage Provincial Champion was both blessing and curse—how would Zhou Qing navigate it?  

Noticing Zhou Qing's demeanor shift from elation to calm, Fushong marveled: "Truly a seed of enlightenment."  

At sixteen, he himself had been chased around mountains by his senior brother—nothing like this composure.  

Arriving at the examination hall after the parade, Zhou Qing had already regained equilibrium.  

Candidates milled about, some lingering to glimpse the new champion. When Zhou Qing's youthful face appeared, stunned silence fell.  

"So young?"  

Meeting their gazes—shock, doubt, envy—Zhou Qing remained unflustered. His dignified poise earned nods from Chief Examiner Song He and Deputy Examiner Lu on the gallery.  

A champion indeed.  

"Brother Fengxian, congratulations on acquiring such a disciple."  

"The honor is mutual."  

Song He smiled. As chief examiner, Zhou Qing was naturally his protégé, though the court discouraged factionalism through examinations. Discretion was necessary.  

The candidates followed Zhou Qing inside.  

Magistrate Feng led them in paying respects to Song He before the customary exchanges between examinees and examiners. With their new status, they could now become officials—potentially colleagues with their mentors.  

In the study later, Zhou Qing recaptured his earlier inspiration and transcribed Meng Jiao's poem, substituting "Changzhou" for "Chang'an." As the ink dried, his literary spirit—initially fragmented in his self-cultivation record—became fuller than before.  

The examination had aided his literary spirit's recovery and growth, crucial for merging the "Breeze Talisman Canon" with "Ghost Step." Combined, they would form a "Shadowless" footwork technique—both evasive and balanced.  

Martial arts and temperament influenced each other. Practicing Tiger Form, Zhou Qing often felt he'd become a human tiger without his scholarly cultivation tempering it. Yet the tiger's aura from combat proved useful against supernatural threats.  

Exiting, he found the courtyard's peach and plum trees uprooted, Fushong sitting pale but grinning wildly: "So that's how it is..."  

Unsure whether to approach, Zhou Qing considered the intricacies of power dynamics—promotions and demotions, surface and substance. Unbeknownst to him, the court planned to replace regional circuits with provinces, appointing governors and administration commissioners.  

Lu's rapid promotion paved the way for another, part of political bargaining. Zhou Qing's youthful success became political capital for Song and Lu, stabilizing the region's governance—though banditry and taxes remained unresolved.  

For Zhou Qing, the examination path ended here. For Song He, it marked a risky new beginning—retreat meant ruin.  

Advance was the only option.  

...  

Zhou Qing rested a day in Magistrate Feng's gifted residence before returning to Jiangzhou, escorted by armed guards—a Provincial Champion's mishap would shake the region.  

Magistrate Feng tactfully kept his distance after Zhou Qing moved in—an implicit gesture of goodwill.  

Squire Zhang's murderous servant was swiftly sentenced, pending execution orders. Magistrate Feng informed Lu, soon to be Vice Minister of Justice, who vowed harsh punishment for such treachery.  

As for Squire Zhang—who collapsed after his son's death—Magistrate Feng "compassionately" arranged extended medical care in the county office. The Transport Commissioner, seeing the heirless old man bedridden, didn't object.  

In the courtyard:  

"'The topmost line: the proud dragon will have cause to repent,'" Fushong quoted.  

Zhou Qing: "Senior brother, you're truly a master of the Book of Changes."  

Fushong smiled: "Your journey embodies this line. Remarkable that you grasped its wisdom so young."  

Zhou Qing waved it off: "Can 'proud dragon's remorse' apply to martial arts?"  

Startled, Fushong—who'd never considered this—pondered before replying:  

"My Mountain-Suppressing Canon builds foundation, each layer increasing strength. But my signature Mountain-Suppressing Force requires full exertion, draining energy. Your question enlightens me—applying 'remorse' could allow controlled use, though adjusting force mechanics won't be easy."  

Zhou Qing then recounted the "Dragon-Subduing Palms" tale from "Legend of the Condor Heroes," where the first move was "Proud Dragon's Remorse."  

Fushong mused: "The storyteller half-understood martial arts—his 'internal energy' resembles true qi but falls short, though more versatile than inner force. The concept has merit, but force application differs. Still useful—I'll ponder it."  

Privately, he marveled at Zhou Qing's heritage—perhaps descended from or acquainted with transcendent masters—and took the tale more seriously.
