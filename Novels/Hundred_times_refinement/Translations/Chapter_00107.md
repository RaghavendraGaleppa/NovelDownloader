# Chapter 57: The Demonic Cultivator  

Demonic artifacts are also spiritual tools, but they are forged by demonic cultivators—a branch of practitioners diverging from orthodox cultivators.  

Ordinary cultivators pursue the path of immortality, but the road to cultivation is long and fraught with thorns. To achieve greatness, one must exert effort beyond the imagination of ordinary people.  

This is why an exceptional cultivator not only requires spiritual roots but also unyielding perseverance.  

Spiritual roots are innate and unchangeable, but perseverance depends entirely on oneself. While everyone wishes to advance further on the path of cultivation, only a few can endure the hardships and persist steadfastly.  

Many cultivators live mediocre lives not because of poor aptitude but due to insufficient effort. Some succumb to despair, while others seek shortcuts.  

It is well known that orthodox cultivators pursue the Heavenly Dao, emphasizing steady progress and a solid foundation. However, those seeking shortcuts carve their own path, creating techniques that require little effort yet yield rapid progress. For a time, many cultivators flocked to these methods.  

These were the first demonic cultivators.  

Yet not everyone was lured in. Many wise individuals discovered that while demonic techniques offered swift progress in the short term, they left behind hidden flaws and dangers.  

As their cultivation deepened, their progress would slow, and their Dao hearts would become unstable, prone to deviation or possession. Moreover, most of these techniques were sinister and cruel, violating the natural order.  

To be fair, orthodox cultivators are no saints either—they adhere to the law of the jungle and treat mortals as ants. However, few orthodox cultivators kill without reason. Even when they kill for treasures, there is usually a motive, driven by greed or ambition.  

Demonic cultivators are different. Prolonged practice of their malevolent techniques warps their temperament, making them cruel and bloodthirsty. They kill for pleasure and forge demonic artifacts using the souls of the living. Their actions are utterly devoid of restraint.  

Though demonic cultivators are notorious, orthodox cultivators do not necessarily oppose them outright. The immortal world is selfish—unless provoked, the idea of "eradicating evil and upholding righteousness" is nothing but a tale to deceive children.  

Hearing the term "demonic artifact," Lin Xuan recalled the information he had learned about demonic cultivators. He was inwardly shocked—Ye Tian had entered the valley at the same time as him, and their sect was an orthodox cultivation sect. How could he be a demonic cultivator?  

After immobilizing the three disciples with forbidden techniques, Ye Tian's expression grew even more sinister. He sneered, "Junior brothers, blame your bad luck. My Hundred Souls Banner has already refined the souls of eighty-one ordinary mortals. But according to the demonic manual I obtained, to perfect it, I still need the refined souls of three cultivators as catalysts."  

"Why us?" Song Hu trembled, clearly familiar with the legends of demonic cultivators. Having one's soul extracted to forge a demonic artifact was a fate worse than descending into the eighteenth layer of hell.  

"Humph, blame your weak cultivation," Ye Tian replied coldly. "If elite disciples went missing, the valley would investigate thoroughly. If suspicion fell on me, I'd be in deep trouble!"  

Though orthodox and demonic cultivators were not sworn enemies, practicing demonic techniques in secret was still taboo for sect disciples. Moreover, forging artifacts with human souls was a grave offense. Ye Tian was no fool—he had to be cautious.  

The Song brothers and the tall, skinny youth were all insignificant disciples. Even if they disappeared, the sect wouldn't bother searching extensively.  

Of course, this was only one reason. Another, which Ye Tian didn't voice, was that he had only recently obtained the demonic manual and his cultivation was still shallow. The manual stated that the stronger the souls used as catalysts, the more powerful the Hundred Souls Banner would become.  

But that was just theory. In practice, refining the souls of powerful cultivators might backfire, leading to failure.  

To play it safe, he chose three low-level disciples with weak cultivation—easy to refine and unlikely to draw the sect's attention. A perfect plan.  

Hidden in the bushes, Lin Xuan remained expressionless, but his heart burned with killing intent. Initially, Ye Tian had intended to target him—only luck had kept him from falling into the trap.  

The man's heart was vile. Of course, Lin Xuan wouldn't act now, but in the future...  

Though Ye Tian hadn't harmed him directly, his malicious intent was enough. If given the chance, Lin Xuan would repay him in kind.  

As Lin Xuan plotted, Ye Tian pulled out a small black banner from his robes. Though this place was secluded, delays invited trouble—he would refine the three souls immediately.  

The Hundred Souls Banner was only palm-sized, but the moment it appeared, Lin Xuan sensed a dense, resentful aura that sent chills down his spine.  

In contrast, Ye Tian's face lit with excitement. The stronger the malice, the more formidable the banner's power.  

"Senior Brother, spare us! We swear we won't say a word!"  

"Yes! We'll capture Lin Xuan—that brat without spiritual roots—and two other low-level disciples for you to refine the banner!"  

The three pleaded desperately, their words growing increasingly shameless.  

A shadow passed over Lin Xuan's face, and the last traces of sympathy in his heart vanished. He reminded himself: the cultivation world was a place of survival of the fittest. Cultivators were selfish, willing to harm others for personal gain. From now on, he would never show mercy—or he would be the one to suffer.  

A cold smile played on his lips as he watched the scene unfold. From now on, he would no longer concern himself with notions of justice or evil. He wouldn't actively seek to do harm, but neither would he ever be soft-hearted again.  

Otherwise, he might save someone only to be bitten in return. Lin Xuan had no intention of being a naive fool.  

If Lin Xuan wouldn't show mercy, Ye Tian certainly wouldn't. No matter how much the three begged, he remained unmoved. Let them go?  

A joke!  

Capture more disciples?  

Pointless!  

Who knew if they'd report him once back in the sect? Even if they kept their word, he saw no reason to go through the trouble again.  

Their souls would serve as the final sacrifice. Ye Tian raised the Hundred Souls Banner high...
