# Chapter 34: The Masked Man

The little maid was instantly terrified, her face losing all color, and instinctively wanted to scream.

But before she could make a sound, a rough, powerful hand clamped over her mouth.

"Don't make a sound. If you dare make any noise, I'll kill you. Understood?"

Xu Yunfan lowered his voice, making it as menacing as possible as he threatened the little maid in her ear.

Hearing this, the maid's eyes instantly welled with tears. Trembling with terror, she nodded repeatedly.

"Good. Now, I'm going to ask you something."

Xu Yunfan kept his voice low and deep, as if it were coming from the darkness itself.

"Where is the Hu family's treasure storage?"

The maid didn't dare to hesitate for a moment. Shaking, she quickly pointed in a direction.

Xu Yunfan looked toward where the maid was pointing. He saw that the building was brightly lit, as bright as day. He thought to himself that it was only natural for a place as important as the treasury to be heavily guarded. However, with an intruder in the Hu mansion and the black-clad figure drawing most of the attention, the treasury should be a bit emptier.

Just as he was about to ask a few more questions, Xu Yunfan's brow suddenly furrowed slightly. He instinctively sniffed the air.

*Why does it smell like urine?*

Puzzled, he looked down at the little maid in front of him, who was no taller than 1.55 meters.

She was trembling like a quail, looking utterly pathetic.

"Did you get so scared you peed yourself?"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but ask in a low voice.

Hearing Xu Yunfan's blunt words, the maid's fear was instantly replaced by immense shame and anger.

She buried her head in embarrassment, gritted her teeth, and was no longer frightened. She remained silent, wishing she could find a hole to crawl into and die.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan wasn't making any further moves, the maid slowly raised her head, only to find that he was already gone.

She opened her mouth but immediately closed it again, reminded of her current wretched state.

If the other maids found out, she would never be able to hold her head up again for the rest of her life. If the masters found out, they might also despise her and throw her out of the house. Such things had happened before.

The little maid looked around cautiously. Seeing that no one was there, she quickly lowered her head and hurried away in a fluster.

Xu Yunfan, hidden in the shadows, watched everything but said nothing.

In this ancient feudal society, the Great Zhou Dynasty wasn't as extreme as some dynasties from his previous life where women would want to die if a man saw their legs. Still, wetting one's pants was a scandal no one dared to speak of.

His predecessor, while at the Jiang mansion, had once seen a maid who, frightened by a martial arts instructor's punch, lost control of her bladder.

Jiang Yu, disgusted, had sent the maid directly to the pleasure house.

The households of the wealthy and powerful were truly filthy at their core.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He strode forward, sticking to the dark corners as he swiftly and silently made his way toward the treasury.

Now, the entire Hu mansion was distracted by the black-clad woman. Along the way, he didn't see many people, only a few maids and servants.

When he got close to the treasury, he found that the patrolling guards were indeed very dense. These men had steady footsteps and vigilant eyes, clearly possessing martial skill. However, he could see that their eyes were unsettled; the treasury was not as calm as it appeared.

Xu Yunfan crouched low. His hunting skills made his movements difficult to detect, and he used the surrounding debris and shadows to cleverly avoid the guards' line of sight.

*You concealed your presence, skillfully using cover to hide your form, making your prey unable to detect your actions. Your Hunting Proficiency has increased.*

He held his breath and glanced at the proficiency increase notification that popped up in his vision, quietly waiting for the right moment.

This hunting skill was proving more effective than he had anticipated.

After about ten minutes, a loud shout suddenly echoed through the Hu mansion.

"Bandits have invaded! Hurry and protect Master Hu!"

It was the voice of the middle-aged man who had chased the intruder out of the mansion.

Hearing this, the guards at the treasury were called away by their leader, leaving the entire treasury area suddenly much emptier.

It was just like finding a pillow when you were feeling sleepy.

Xu Yunfan felt a surge of joy. Sometimes, a little patience could bring good fortune.

There were only four or five guards left, all of whom were just at the entry-level of martial arts. Their leader, though powerfully built, had mediocre vitality and seemed to be at most at the minor success stage.

Xu Yunfan stopped hiding. He walked out of the shadows of the corner right in front of the group of guards.

No longer concealing himself, his slightly heavy footsteps seemed to pound on the hearts of the guards, making them all turn their heads.

The leader of the guards was startled. The man before him was dressed in black and masked, with an aggressive air—he certainly wasn't here for tea.

He drew the long sword at his waist and shouted, "Halt!"

The other guards also drew their swords, on full alert.

But Xu Yunfan acted as if he hadn't heard. He didn't stop his advance. The muscles all over his body swelled slightly, his bones let out a series of light popping sounds, and his clothes grew taut as his muscles bulged.

In the blink of an eye, Xu Yunfan had closed the distance in a few great strides, appearing before one of the guards.

The guard stared in terror, his simple broadsword instinctively swinging toward Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan didn't dodge or evade. He raised the back of his hand to meet the blade.

With a *clang*, sparks flew. The guard's broadsword was actually knocked from his grasp, while Xu Yunfan's arm bore nothing more than a faint white mark, which vanished in a few breaths.

"Hardened Body?!"

The leader cried out in alarm. He never expected to encounter someone who practiced this kind of body-forging art.

Xu Yunfan threw a punch. The knuckles of his fist tore through the air with a hissing sound. It was heavy and fast. The guard had no time to react before the fist slammed into his chest.

With a scream, the guard flew backward like a broken kite, crashed heavily into a wall, spat blood, and lost consciousness on the spot.

The other guards, seeing this, showed fear on their faces but still mustered their courage. Wielding their weapons, they rushed forward in a group.

Xu Yunfan wasn't the least bit flustered. Using his swift footwork, his figure darted like lightning through the crowd. Every time he threw a punch, it was followed by a dull thud and a scream.

His fists were like heavy hammers, smashing into the guards' bodies. The sound of bones breaking rang out incessantly.

The little leader was terrified. He swung his long sword wildly, trying to block Xu Yunfan's attacks.

However, Xu Yunfan lunged forward in a single step, flicked the long sword away with a finger, and then brought his hand down, grabbing the leader's wrist. With a slight exertion, a *crack* was heard as the wrist bone fractured.

The little leader screamed, and his long sword fell to the ground.

Xu Yunfan followed up with a kick to the leader's abdomen. The man flew out, landed on the ground, and fainted from the pain.

In just a few breaths' time, all four or five guards were on the ground, their ability to resist completely gone.
