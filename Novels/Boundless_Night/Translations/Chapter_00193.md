**Chapter 193: Victims in Pairs**

A gentle breeze stirred the blue lake into ripples, the bamboo forest rustled, the golden vine trees shimmered with vibrant light, and clusters of flowers and plants exuded a fresh fragrance.

Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu had each moved into a house with a large courtyard. Compared to the gloomy forest cabin they had occupied earlier, this place, with its trickling hot springs and expansive views, immediately lifted their spirits.

Little Wu spoke, "Brother, Xin Youdao seems to have lost. Sigh, could it be because of the earlier battle? I feel bad for him."

During the duel between the two prodigious talents of Mountain River Academy, the spectators constantly cheered and shouted. Even without being present, one could hear the sounds like a surging tide. Regardless, as they settled into their new homes and gazed at the picturesque surroundings, both were in excellent spirits.

***

"Cheng Rui," Xin Youdao called out to the yellow-clad woman, wanting to stop her.

"Don't bother. I don't believe it's such a coincidence. He must have temporarily invited a high-level Divine Seed who suppressed their cultivation to ambush you before the decisive battle." Cheng Rui refused to believe it. It was simply unrealistic for two "fierce dragons" to suddenly emerge among the new students this year. Looking across Kunlun City's dozens of higher academies, besides Ling Yu and the Pure Yang Body, where else could there be other new disciples comparable to Xin Youdao?

Cheng Rui walked quickly, their old residence coming into view. She immediately spotted the two. The older brother, surprisingly, was using her forgotten fishing rod to fish for five-colored dragon carp in the lake, looking utterly relaxed. In an instant, her chest heaved violently, feeling suffocated. "See? It's those two. Don't tell me you don't recognize them!"

Ling Yu, clad in black with hair flowing over his shoulders, possessed bright, piercing eyes that held a restrained heroic spirit. His composed demeanor exuded powerful self-confidence. Especially tonight, having defeated Xin Youdao, one of the strongest in this year's unified examination, it was as if he had cultivated a certain aura, completing a transformation. Now, Ling Yu's spirit, essence, and mind had all risen; he could feel his cultivation path had significantly improved.

His pupils contracted slightly. *Is this the person Master Wu thinks so highly of?*

With a *swish*, he seemed to teleport, stepping lightly over the branches of the golden vine trees, arriving before them as gracefully as a falling leaf, his gaze fixed on the fishing youth.

Wu Yaozu, carrying a grill, happened to step out of the courtyard gate and witnessed the scene. "Just moved in, and someone already wants to challenge us and take back the house?"

"Why did you two act?" Ling Yu approached, staring at Qin Ming.

"None of your business," Qin Ming glanced at him.

Ling Yu thought for a moment. "I'd like to spar with you." He decided on a swift resolution to clear up the misunderstanding between Xin Youdao and Cheng Rui. More importantly, he himself wanted to gauge his opponent, as Master Wu held this person in high regard. Thus, he chose simplicity over explanation.

Qin Ming was surprised. *So direct?* Ling Yu believed in the simplicity of the Great Dao, and he was on a quest to test his sword against the world, needing no other reason.

"No thanks!" Qin Ming flatly refused. He didn't want to engage in meaningless sparring.

"Right here. It won't take long," Ling Yu said, his black hair fluttering in the night wind, his eyes deep and radiating powerful conviction.

"Right here? Are you crazy, or am I?" Qin Ming decisively rejected. After one fight, they'd gone broke. Another fight and he and Little Wu would have to sell themselves to Mountain River Academy.

"Why is there someone else here again?!" Qian Chuan, the senior student on duty, was utterly exasperated. Today, he was on rotation here, and he kept encountering such incidents. He gasped, sucking in the mist from the lake. *Who was that? It's Ling Yu!* His head immediately throbbed. He had thought the duo were nobodies, but why did they keep running into such famous people?

"This battle is unavoidable!" Ling Yu advanced, his hair flying, his black robes flapping, his body surging with dense Heavenly Light Energy. Above his head, a spiritual waterfall seemed to descend faintly, though blurry, the ability to construct such a hazy wonder with Heavenly Light was astonishing. Some called him "Young Ancestor," truly due to his extraordinary talent, reaching heights unattainable by ordinary people. Simultaneously, from his glabella, a strong beam of spiritual consciousness, like a sword unsheathed, sliced through the night mist. He was a practitioner of dual paths.

*Boom!* The ground trembled slightly. He was building momentum; with each step forward, his mental fortitude was honed like a heavenly blade, becoming sharp and dazzling, radiating a formidable and oppressive aura. Ling Yu's physical body also began to glow, growing more brilliant, resonating with his spirit, like the clanging sound of a heavenly blade being sharpened. His entire being merged into the vast night, seeking to borrow some terrifying "momentum."

*Clang!* A grill flew towards him, but it was shattered by Ling Yu's protective Heavenly Light. He spun around abruptly, not expecting someone to forcefully intervene.

Wu Yaozu, seeing the shattered turf where Ling Yu had stepped, instantly teleported forward, launching a powerful move from the start. Rainbow light surged from within him, and he wielded a mysterious bronze staff. Of course, not wanting to go deeply into debt was only one reason; Little Wu felt guilty, thinking Xin Youdao's defeat might have been related to him. Therefore, upon seeing another person come looking for trouble, he was eager to act.

In a powerful collision, the ground instantly cracked open, and the nearby vines and flowers were once again ravaged.

"You want us to go bankrupt?!" Little Wu cried out in alarm. His divine rainbow transformed into a dazzling golden arch bridge, pressing down on Ling Yu, determined to stop him from causing further destruction.

"Hmm?!" Ling Yu was shocked. *How could this short-haired youth be so strong?* He had learned about almost all the exceptional individuals among this year's newcomers, so for two people to suddenly jump out with such extraordinary performances truly seemed absurd. Little Wu, as the sole descendant of the Fourth Forbidden Land, was naturally incredibly powerful! He blocked Ling Yu, using the golden bridge to draw out Ling Yu's spiritual consciousness.

Ling Yu, with his ambition to test his sword against the world, naturally possessed terrifying inner reserves and astonishing strength. Now, his whole body erupted with brilliant light, like a Phoenix reborn in fire, spreading its wings to tear apart all obstacles and illuminate the area. In the distance, some people exclaimed, as if they saw a blazing sun slowly rising in the night sky.

*Thump!* Ling Yu felt a sharp pain in the back of his head. He tried to turn and look, but his strength failed him. His vision blurred, and he collapsed to the ground. In that final moment, he was enraged beyond measure. *The youth Master Wu thought so highly of was incredibly dishonorable! He actually ambushed him!*

Qin Ming lowered his palm, feeling no shame. Since Little Wu had already acted, and with the painful lesson of bankruptcy fresh in their minds, Qin Ming naturally wouldn't allow such a thing to happen again. He simply and roughly stopped it.

In the distance, the yellow-clad girl, Cheng Rui, shrieked and darted away. Since she had led Ling Yu there, she feared the two youths might beat her up too. At this point, she believed that Ling Yu had no connection to those two savage youths; he himself had been knocked down.

Xin Youdao, still injured, walked slower and had just arrived. The dozen or so young men and women accompanying him, who had witnessed this scene from a distance, were all dumbfounded and utterly shocked. They knew that tonight's protagonists were Ling Yu and Xin Youdao. Yet, two mysterious youths had brutally acted, successively knocking down both prodigious talents. If this news got out, it would undoubtedly cause a massive uproar! What would those spectators feel if they knew? In a hidden corner, such bizarre "sparring" had actually taken place.

Xin Youdao's mood was complex. He and Ling Yu were truly in this together, having both been utterly defeated! Cheng Rui whispered, "Youdao, I believe you now. Ling Yu didn't arrange for anyone to ambush you. He... also became a victim."

The group: "..." They were at a loss for words.

Qian Chuan, who was on duty there, was stunned into a daze. This was Ling Yu, one of tonight's two strongest cultivators, also lying on this patch of grass. He knew that Ling Yu and Xin Youdao were destined to make tomorrow's newspaper headlines. Yet, such "hidden circumstances" were behind it; tonight had an unbearable side for both of them. If the outside world knew, it would certainly spark a storm of public discussion, like a mountain collapsing and a tsunami raging. And all of this was due to those two obscure youths!

Qian Chuan found it inconceivable. That dilapidated patch of grass seemed to possess a magical power. He watched for a long time, not daring to approach, genuinely feeling some reverence for that cursed patch of grass and the two mysterious youths.

The aftermath of the "battle" was still fervent, with many discussing it, and some were rushing towards this residence. Xin Youdao instructed the dozen people with him to slightly obstruct them, preventing the unconscious Ling Yu from being discovered in such a state and losing face.

"Brother, wake up," Qin Ming shook Ling Yu.

Wu Yaozu's eyes widened. He saw Brother Ming very naturally pull three gold notes from the man's embrace. *Could it be done like this?* He felt like a window to a new world had opened! Qin Ming's eyes also widened slightly. *Were Tang Jin and her lineage so rich? Each gold note was worth five hundred Day Gold!* Before his body exploded, he had accumulated for so long, but it was nowhere near this much combined.

Qin Ming said, "I'm not robbing him. He attacked me first, and I was forced to counterattack. He became my captive. However, since you interfered midway, Little Wu, I have to return five hundred Day Gold." He slipped one gold note back, keeping two notes and dozens of Day Gold coins.

"Brother, you're so honorable, you're a good person!" Wu Yaozu exclaimed. Now, the two of them wouldn't go bankrupt. After his initial excitement, he felt a bit of regret. "Such a loss! I forgot to 'touch gold' when I defeated Xin Youdao."

Not far away, Xin Youdao, who was walking over, heard this remark, and the veins on his forehead almost popped out.

Qin Ming said, "The nature is different. When you challenge someone, you shouldn't have such thoughts. I was attacked and forced to defend myself, so taking ransom from a captive is normal."

Ling Yu woke up, immediately enraged, wanting to fight his opponent to the death! However, he felt a sharp pain in the back of his head and was still groggy. If he were to fight a decisive battle like this, he would certainly suffer a massive loss.

Xin Youdao spoke, "Brother Ling, don't get agitated. You should leave here first. Everyone else is returning, and it's not suitable to cause more trouble tonight." He had to stop it, not wanting the situation to escalate, because he didn't want these messy affairs to be reported tomorrow; otherwise, it would truly be a "bloody storm."

Ling Yu pointed at Qin Ming, his chest heaving violently with anger. Finally, he turned and left, naturally not wanting to be reported in the newspapers tomorrow and become a laughingstock. "I will formally challenge you in a proper setting!" he declared before departing.

"There's no need," Qin Ming said, wanting to advise him not to be so agitated.

The disciples of the secret sects and immortal paths residing here had all returned by now. Upon seeing Xin Youdao and Ling Yu, they became incredibly excited. A large crowd surrounded them, exceptionally enthusiastic, treating them like stars, embracing them in the center.

"Brother Ling, you are truly the glory of our generation! I eagerly await seeing you test your sword against all under heaven, sweep away all rivals from various paths, and reach the pinnacle!"

"Brother Xin, though defeated, you are still honorable, astonishing everyone..."

Such praises and fiery gazes, which Ling Yu and Xin Youdao would normally have taken in stride, being accustomed to them, now made their moods utterly terrible. Every word felt like a whip lashing at them.

***

It was unclear how much time passed before the two managed to squeeze out of the crowd, both letting out a long sigh. They were both sweating; the experience had been an ordeal for them.

"What?! You lost to the youth from Black-White Mountain?!" Later that evening, Tang Jin suddenly turned around and looked at the indignant youth.

"I didn't lose! He was dishonorable, he ambushed me!" Ling Yu grew angrier as he spoke, clenching his fists. He declared loudly, "Sister Tang, please arrange it. I want to fight him fairly and squarely!"

"They might not accept the challenge," the purple-eyed crow interjected.
