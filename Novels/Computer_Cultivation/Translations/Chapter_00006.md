# Chapter 6: The Old Residence as a Stable

The core of North New Town was its spiritual vein, nestled within the mountains. The Fang family estate was situated on the mountainside.

The estate's architecture was magnificent, surrounded by layers of formations visible to a cultivator's divine sense, lending it an air of majesty and mystery.

Fang Jun slowly ascended the mountain. As soon as he reached the foot, he was stopped by two guards. "This is the Fang family estate. No idlers are allowed to approach!"

Fang Jun smiled faintly. "I am Fang Jun. I've come to visit the Fang family head."

The two guards were taken aback. One of them frowned. "Fang? Which branch of the Fang family are you from?"

The Fang family had branched out for five hundred years. Many in North New Town shared the surname Fang, but there were vast differences between them.

The older guard scrutinized Fang Jun and suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "You're the Eldest Young Master?"

The younger guard looked puzzled. "I've seen the Eldest Young Master before. He..."

The older guard interrupted him, bowing respectfully. "Eldest Young Master, welcome home."

Soon, a servant went inside to report, and someone came to lead Fang Jun in. Along the way, a middle-aged man surrounded by attendants approached him.

The servant introduced him. "Eldest Young Master, this is Steward Zhang."

Steward Zhang beamed. "Eldest Young Master, you've finally returned! The Master and Madam often speak of you, worried that you're suffering hardships outside, exposed to the elements without anyone to care for you."

Fang Jun didn't bother to respond. If they truly cared, how could they have allowed that incident fifteen years ago?

Seeing Fang Jun walk past him, Steward Zhang's smile stiffened, and his tone turned cold. "Eldest Young Master, Madam has summoned you to the ancestral hall for questioning."

Fang Jun still ignored him.

Steward Zhang finally dropped the pretense, sneering. "Just because I called you Eldest Young Master, you actually think you're someone important? Let me tell you the truth. Madam has already convened a clan meeting in the ancestral hall, preparing to remove you from the family register. From today onwards, you are no longer a member of the Fang family!"

Fang Jun raised an eyebrow. "So soon? I just arrived, and everyone's already gathered?"

Steward Zhang said smugly, "Afraid? If you're afraid, obediently kowtow to me, and perhaps I can plead on your behalf."

Fang Jun laughed. "If I really kowtow, things would only get worse. It's better to go directly to the ancestral hall. Perhaps there's still room for maneuver. However, playing these power games with you is truly boring. In the cultivation world, strength is ultimately respected."

Steward Zhang scoffed. "Strength? With your Qi Refining Stage Three cultivation?"

The two lackeys behind him immediately stepped forward, releasing their auras. They were both at Qi Refining Stage Four, and Steward Zhang himself was at Qi Refining Stage Six.

One of them sneered. "Will you kneel and kowtow yourself, or will we make you kneel after we've taken action?"

Fang Jun chuckled. "My choice is... *Hmph!*"

Before the words had faded, a beam of light shot out from his mouth, transforming into a flying sword that instantly pierced the heads of the two lackeys. They didn't even have time to scream before collapsing to the ground, dead.

Steward Zhang paled in horror. "A... a Natal Treasure! You're only at Qi Refining Stage Three. How is it possible for you to wield a Natal Treasure!"

Fang Jun said calmly, "You're making a fuss over nothing. The Dao children of the Immortal Sects use their Natal Treasures to establish their foundation even before entering Qi Refining. How could a frog like you at the bottom of a well understand?"

Steward Zhang stammered, "But... but you're just... a lowly..."

Fang Jun's gaze turned cold. "What?"

Steward Zhang opened his mouth, but ultimately dared not say anything. His face was pale as he knelt on the ground, kowtowing. "I beg you, Eldest Young Master, spare my life."

Fang Jun asked, "What if I don't?"

Steward Zhang said in a low voice, "With your talent, you're qualified to join a high-level sect. My life is nothing more than an insect on the road to you."

Fang Jun replied, "But even insects bite. They still need to be killed."

Steward Zhang gritted his teeth. "Have you considered this carefully? I'm someone Madam trusts, and Madam is currently at Qi Refining Stage Eight. Even if you have a Natal Treasure, you may not be able to defeat her."

Fang Jun asked, "Are you threatening me?"

Steward Zhang lowered his head. "I wouldn't dare."

Fang Jun laughed. "You say you wouldn't dare, but everything you've said is a threat. Actually, you know in your heart that perhaps my so-called 'mother' won't necessarily protect you. But even ants cling to life. What you're doing is only human nature."

A glimmer of hope flashed in Steward Zhang's eyes. "If you understand, then..."

Before he could finish speaking, the flying sword had pierced his head.

...

After killing Steward Zhang, Fang Jun didn't immediately go to the ancestral hall. He dismissed the other trembling servants and went alone to the East Wing, the residence he and his birth mother had occupied in his childhood.

Now, stirred by the scene, he wanted to reminisce.

However, when he arrived at the East Wing, he saw that the residence that should have belonged to Fang Jun and his birth mother had been replaced by a stable.

Although the Fang family was a family of cultivators, it wasn't as if they were immune to filth. It was still a place for livestock.

"Hee-haw!"

The sound of hooves rang out, and a chestnut-colored steed galloped through the door. The girl on its back dismounted and saw Fang Jun blocking the entrance. She shouted loudly, "Who are you?"

A servant was about to speak, but the girl said, "I don't care who you are. Anyone who dares to block my way deserves to be beaten."

With that, she swung her whip at Fang Jun.

Fang Jun activated his magic power to block the whip. The girl's expression turned cold. "You actually dare to block?"

The girl spoke with righteous indignation, as if Fang Jun deserved to be beaten by her.

Fang Jun didn't answer, but instead asked, "This place should have been a human residence. Why was it turned into a stable?"

The girl said impatiently, "Why are you asking so many questions? It's enough that I like it."

Fang Jun said, "So you running wild in the streets and hurting people is also because you like it?"

The girl suddenly understood. "So you're one of those moralists from a branch family, daring to interfere in this matter. Let me tell you the truth, it's just because I like it."

"The wails of mortals bring me joy, allow me to relax, and allow my cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds. So, what can you do to me?"

The cultivation world had its own legends of纨绔子弟 (wán kù zǐ dì, rich and arrogant playboys) who angered senior cultivators, leading to the destruction of their families.

However, legends were legends precisely because they were rare.

Expecting these people, who were usually high and mighty, to suddenly change their thinking and become humble and gentle was simply impossible.

Their thinking had already formed a habit. Wanting to reverse it wasn't something that could be done with a little correction.

Just like the Fang family's Second Miss, even if she knew that Fang Jun shouldn't be here in theory, she would follow her habitual thinking and assume he was someone else from the Fang family.

Fang Jun said, "I can't do anything, but I can take your life, because I also like it."

The Fang family's Second Miss smiled disdainfully. "A mere Qi Refining Stage Three cultivator. *Hee-haw!*"

She used magic to urge the horse, wanting to use it to trample Fang Jun. The horse she was riding was a spirit beast equivalent to Qi Refining Stage Three, coupled with her own Qi Refining Stage Two cultivation and the Beast Controlling Whip in her hand.

Even if she couldn't achieve the same level of integration between a cultivator and their Natal Treasure, she was still stronger than an ordinary Qi Refining Stage Three cultivator.

Moreover, she didn't believe that she couldn't deal with anyone in the Fang family.

"*Shhh!*"

A flash of sword light, and a head fell to the ground. A beautiful headless corpse fell off the horse, and the horse, without a head, crashed into the wall.

A shrill scream echoed from the horizon. "Yun'er!"
