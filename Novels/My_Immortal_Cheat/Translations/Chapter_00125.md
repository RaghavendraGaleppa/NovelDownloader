# Chapter 125: The Demon Reappears

“Slay!”

The Saint Demon roared, his white hair fluttering. Wielding his sword, he brought forth a misty radiance with each swing. The white sword-body in his hand sliced through the void, cutting towards the giant hand.

Zhou Tian's mind was clear and sharp. With the aid of his skills, his cultivation had reached the Heavenly King Realm, allowing him to perceive everything.

The thunderous giant hand did not dodge; it continued to descend, a torrential cascade of lightning, like a rolling river, smashing down. Originally formed of lightning, it now appeared as a luminous mist. This hand showed no fear of the sword-embryo forged from an immortal sword; even when cut, it still glowed brightly.

Boom!

A lightning waterfall exploded, its deafening roar shaking the void.

The Saint Demon activated a divine ability, merging his body into the void, making himself impervious to all spells and isolating himself from the lightning.

Zhou Tian's expression was calm and steady, like a true Heavenly King. Various anomalous phenomena appeared around him. Although his cultivation had reached the Heavenly King Realm, he possessed no divine abilities himself. He could only utilize异种能量 (heterogeneous energies), refining them to their utmost to unleash powerful destructive force. The Heavenly King Realm was already on the path of exploring the world's essence, allowing one to manipulate various wondrous energies from the void.

“Thunder Orbs Descend Upon the World!”

The starlit river shone brightly. The giant hand was re-condensed by Zhou Tian, undergoing new changes. One star after another appeared in its palm—these were spherical lightning bolts, forming a crackling, astonishing river of lightning.

Looking from afar, the hand was colossal, obscuring the sky. Within its palm and fingers, a cosmic starlit river rotated, spreading overwhelmingly downwards.

“This…” Even the Saint Demon was moved. Although he found Zhou Tian's naming conventions for his moves somewhat inexplicable, the way he wielded lightning to such an extent, pushing energy to its absolute limit, was truly earth-shattering and heart-stopping. A Heavenly Venerate's divine abilities were indeed unimaginable, possessing inconceivable creation.

“Shatter the Heavens!”

The Saint Demon bellowed. He was originally extraordinary and transcendent, but at this moment, he seemed like a mad demon. He swung the white divine sword in his hand, unleashing an ancient sword art to meet the overwhelming starlit river of lightning.

*Crack!*

The sky shattered. Thousands of layers of lightning engulfed the area. The giant hand was cleaved open, but the countless spherical lightning bolts, immense as mountains, descended like erupting volcanoes.

The white-haired Saint Demon in the center of the fray was entangled by lightning and bombarded by thunder. Yet, the immortal sword in his hand also possessed a strange demonic power, continuously annihilating the surrounding lightning.

*Clang!*

Suddenly, the white immortal sword vibrated intensely, and a strange electric arc still traveled along the sword body into the Saint Demon's essence. These lightning energies were terrifying. Zhou Tian, unable to wield divine abilities, could only compress energy to the extreme, but these energies, refined to their zenith, were not to be underestimated!

With a bang, the Saint Demon reeled backward, staggering. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured and did not cough up blood.

“Hahahahaha!”

The Saint Demon let out a wild laugh, his eyes filled with malevolence, completely different from before. He was like a Demon King. This transformation was alarming—from transcendent to overwhelmingly demonic, the change was immense!

Boundless demonic energy overflowed, and the Saint Demon was completely transformed. The immortal sword in his hand became a black great halberd, and even his white hair turned deep black, profoundly dark, as if containing some demonic power.

Zhou Tian, in fact, was unaware that he held a significant advantage. The Saint Demon's cultivation was not that of an ordinary Heavenly King, but rather at the extreme limit of a Heavenly King, almost reaching the half-step Dao Lord realm. However, due to his dual personalities, one persona simply could not utilize the strength of the other, so his power was significantly weaker compared to Zhou Tian. At this level, even the slightest difference was enough to become the straw that broke the camel's back.

Zhou Tian was not too surprised by the Saint Demon's sudden transformation because Zhou Yi had told him that the Saint Demon had a dual personality. This abrupt transformation, therefore, was not unexpected.

Without further words, time was limited, and Zhou Tian did not want to waste it. If he could kill the Saint Demon, that would be for the best, saving a lot of trouble.

Heaven and Earth erupted. An unimaginable power burst forth from Zhou Tian's seemingly frail body. His arms, one black and one gold, extended to his fingertips. His left hand shone like gold, while his right hand was as dark as ink.

As Zhou Tian swung his black right fist, black waves crashed against the sky behind him, filled with Yin energy—the ultimate Yin power. When he swung his golden left fist, an enormous sun rose from the black ocean, radiating Yang energy, scorching hot.

The interplay of Yin and Yang contained the most fundamental power in this world, terrifying and overwhelming. This was one of the few combinations of heterogeneous energies Zhou Tian could conceive.

“Yin-Yang Great Fists!”

Zhou Tian formed fist seals with both hands, unleashing torrents of black and golden light. The circulating Yin and Yang instantly shattered heaven and earth, shaking the sky!

The Saint Demon was now in his demonic form. His back sprouted a pair of jet-black wings, and his body was robust and powerful, muscles taut, like interwoven dragons. All his muscles were bulging. The great halberd in his hand was like black obsidian, a rare material he had spent a long time traversing the star realm to collect, possessing unimaginable might.

The Demonic One was not a scholar like the Saint persona; he was a martial general!

“Suppress!”

The Demonic One uttered a single word. He swung his great halberd, unleashing a formidable technique. Fierce beasts roared from all directions, divine birds tore through the sky, and a single great halberd suppressed everything. All the unleashed energy surged towards the two light beams sent forth by Zhou Tian.

The greatest sounds are silent. The world fell into a strange stillness, then a ripple of aftermath spread, almost tearing the heavens apart. Mu Su and Ling Yu were enveloped in a golden energy and sent further away, protected from the battlefield's shockwaves. Both watched the battle with tense expressions.

The energy unleashed by Zhou Tian and the Saint Demon far exceeded their expectations. They now only hoped that Zhou Tian could defeat the Saint Demon, otherwise their lives would be in peril.

“Splendid!”

The Demonic One grinned maliciously. His great halberd vibrated incessantly, but he paid it no mind, stomping the earth to crack it, transforming into a streak of light heading towards Zhou Tian. He was skilled in the art of conquest and sought close-quarters combat with Zhou Tian; the clashing of energies was not his forte.

Zhou Tian frowned slightly. Half the time had already passed, but the results were not significant. The Saint Demon possessed various powerful divine abilities and wondrous weapons, neutralizing several of his attacks. He could already sense that the power he could exert at this moment was higher than the Saint Demon's. It was not hard to guess this was due to the opponent's dual personality, preventing him from fully unleashing his strength.

“Kill!”

The Saint Demon let out a long roar, and a shocking sight occurred: the collapsed divine statues in the distance, shattered directly into rubble by the ripples of his voice, dispersing the clouds. He gripped the great halberd with both hands, then swung it powerfully, cleaving towards Zhou Tian.

*Crack!*

Heaven and Earth split open. A black electric light flashed, becoming eternal, illuminating the sky! One could see the void crumbling inch by inch beneath the great halberd; nothing could obstruct it, it was indestructible.
