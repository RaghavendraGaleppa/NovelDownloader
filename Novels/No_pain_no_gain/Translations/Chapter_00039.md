# Chapter 39: Red Face, White Face

"Senior, may I ask if there's any special meaning behind this Dark Spirit Root?" Han Zhen asked, his face filled with apprehension.

"Heh heh!" The bearded man grinned, revealing a cold smile.

He put his magic tool back into his storage pouch, then walked over to Han Zhen and said in a chilling tone, "It's a huge problem. A Dark Spirit Root is a born seed for demonic cultivation!"

"Demonic path?" Han Zhen cooperated perfectly with the big man's intimidation, feigning a look of terror, even letting his spiritual energy fluctuate erratically.

Han Zhen's vivid acting produced exactly the effect these two Foundation Establishment cultivators from Spirit Beast Mountain wanted to see. After all, Han Zhen had been cultivating diligently in the mortal world, hadn't even explored the small Yue State cultivation world, let alone witnessed the dark and bloody side of the vast cultivation world.

So, the old man surnamed Chen stepped in to play the "red face," comforting and explaining: "Stop scaring him. Whether it's a righteous sect or a demonic sect, cultivation is an act against the heavens, a survival of the fittest! It's just that those who call themselves righteous only have gentler cultivation techniques and emphasize gradual progress. But they also frequently use the banner of 'eliminating demons and defending the Dao' to commit despicable acts; most of them are hypocrites. Demonic and evil sects, on the other hand, strive for rapid advancement in spiritual power, blindly pursuing powerful cultivation techniques. Most of their cultivation processes harm natural harmony, and they easily lose themselves, becoming extremely bloodthirsty and cruel."

At this point, the bearded man scoffed, interrupting the old man surnamed Chen, and said with some disdain, "No matter what the righteous and demonic paths say, in reality, they all follow the law of the jungle. We cultivators are not like those common mortals. Cultivators with higher cultivation realms view lower-level cultivators as ants. It's common to casually kill someone if they displease you!"

Han Zhen, of course, knew that in the cultivation world, there were only three statuses: ant, fellow Daoist, and senior.

"Thank you, seniors, for clearing my doubts. May I ask, are the Seven Great Sects of Yue State righteous or evil?" Han Zhen asked hesitantly.

"Heh heh! Neither righteous nor evil."

The bearded man curled his lips and began to introduce the origins of the Yue State cultivation world. A thousand years ago, Yue State, like other places, had a clear opposition between righteous and evil paths, and the Seven Great Sects were all minor, insignificant sects. To survive, they could only remain fence-sitters. However, after a great war between the righteous and evil paths where both sides suffered heavy losses and weakened significantly, the Seven Great Sects seized the opportunity to unite and rise up, completely eradicating the legacies of both the righteous and evil paths. Many of the cultivation techniques in Yue State today are spoils of war left behind by the righteous and evil factions.

"Therefore, the cultivation techniques taught by the Seven Great Sects include both righteous and evil ones. But only our Spirit Beast Mountain is the most suitable for young friend," the bearded man said, emphatically stressing the last sentence.

***

"From now on, young friend Han, you'll have no other choice!" The bearded man said, hands clasped behind his back.

Han Zhen nodded. At this point, was there really any choice left? Even if he didn't want to, he'd probably be tied up and dragged back to the sect by these two.

"Unlike the other six sects, our Spirit Beast Mountain branched off from the Imperial Spirit Sect, a major demonic sect in Tianluo State. The foundation of our demonic cultivation techniques is naturally incomparable to the other six sects!" The bearded man dropped a bombshell secret into Han Zhen's ear.

"This..." Han Zhen naturally showed a shocked expression at hearing such a secret. But inwardly, he was a little speechless. They were actually trying to fool him with something even moderately high-ranking people in the six sects would know. However, one thing was true: Spirit Beast Mountain, backed by the Imperial Spirit Sect, was indeed Han Zhen's best choice. And they promised that those with unique spirit roots would have priority for Foundation Establishment Pills in Spirit Beast Mountain. Speaking of this, the two looked at Han Zhen with envy; back then, their journey to Foundation Establishment was not so easy.

"This junior is willing to join Spirit Beast Mountain. Greetings, two Martial Uncles!" Han Zhen bowed to them.

"Good, good!!" Both the old man surnamed Chen and the bearded man happily responded. Discovering a talented disciple meant they wouldn't receive meager rewards from the sect.

"These two spirit talismans are our welcoming gifts to you."

Han Zhen took the two spirit talismans. The spiritual energy on them was abundant, clearly indicating they were two high-grade basic spirit talismans. It was a pity that what he lacked least was talismans. Of course, he dared not show this on his face in front of Foundation Establishment seniors. Han Zhen naturally wore a wide smile.

"Young friend Han, do you have any other questions?"

"Um... do Spirit Beast Mountain disciples have to dress so... eye-catching?" Han Zhen thought for a long time before coming up with such an inoffensive term.

The bearded man and the old man surnamed Chen burst into laughter after hearing Han Zhen's question. Missing a unique spirit root disciple for such a reason would certainly make them the laughingstock of the Seven Great Sects. So the old man surnamed Chen explained, "Once young friend officially joins the sect, you'll understand the marvels of these magical robes. Cultivators of our generation should not be swayed by external things."

"This junior has been taught!"

But Han Zhen still felt some resistance towards the flashy clothes, unable to imagine himself looking so ostentatious when he next met Han Li. The cultivator Han Zhen yearned to be should be "white as mountain snow, bright as moon between clouds"!

Outside the hall for age detection, a moderate queue had formed due to Han Zhen's delay. Suddenly, the formation inside opened, and a flamboyantly dressed old man walked out, with Han Zhen following behind him.

***

The cultivators in the queue lowered their heads one after another, not daring to breathe loudly.

It was precisely because Han Zhen had mentioned he still had some matters to attend to in Taonan Valley. Unexpectedly, the old man surnamed Chen directly dropped his current work, letting the bearded man take over for him. He personally escorted Han Zhen to Taonan Valley and then directly took him back to Spirit Beast Mountain, to avoid any further complications. The attitude of the two Foundation Establishment seniors made Han Zhen feel somewhat overwhelmed by their favor. It seemed his days at Spirit Beast Mountain would be quite good!

Less than half a day later, above Taonan Valley.

"Look! What a huge bird!" A young-faced cultivator suddenly exclaimed.

Then, a massive dark shadow swept across the square. This huge brown bird spread its wings several zhang wide. Its tail and head had white feathers, its beak and sharp claws were golden, and its ferocious aura could be felt from a distance.

The cultivators below looked up and stopped to discuss. "Don't stare! It's a senior from Spirit Beast Mountain!" Someone who saw the old man in flamboyant magical robes on the bird's back quickly reminded others. A few brave cultivators who had originally taken out their magic tools, intending to capture the giant bird, instantly felt their limbs turn cold. Only after the giant bird had flown past did some dare to look closely, noticing Han Zhen also sitting on its back.

"What's his identity, to actually be personally escorted by a Foundation Establishment senior from Spirit Beast Mountain?"

"I think I've seen him before. Didn't he buy cinnabar at my stall?" Some people found the young man on the giant bird familiar and said with uncertainty.

This was, of course, Han Zhen, who had ridden Uncle Chen's Golden-beaked White-headed Eagle from Tianwu Platform to Taonan Valley.

"When you're done, just send a sound transmission talisman. I'll rest here."

"Thank you, Martial Uncle!" Han Zhen bowed politely, eager to go find Han Li and show off.
