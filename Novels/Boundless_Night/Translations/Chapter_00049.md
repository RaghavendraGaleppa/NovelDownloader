## Chapter 49: Surging Emotions

Qin Ming and Old Man Liu were busy with all sorts of preparations—chopping firewood, clearing paths, hunting beasts, and everything else was now ready.

"The Silver-headed Ants have a varied diet and acute sense of smell. They are incredibly sensitive to smells they like, and it’s certainly proving true now!" Qin Ming remarked.

He and Old Man Liu had purchased honey at a high price, and also prepared plenty of beast blood. They scattered blood along the path, occasionally smearing honey, gradually drawing the ants closer.

As soon as Qin Ming and Old Man Liu entered the mountain crevice, the two scents stimulated the previously motionless Silver-headed Ants, causing them to begin to stir.

"Some are starting to move, light the fire quickly!"

"Be careful not to burn yourselves!"

The two of them tossed several buckets of flame oil, then threw torches and immediately fled.

Boom! Flames shot up, startling all the Silver-headed Ants deep within the mountain. Although many were burned to death by the flame oil, there were simply too many, packed together, wriggling and squirming. Furthermore, the ant nest had a complex structure, making many areas impossible to burn.

In an instant, the Silver-headed Ants were enraged, surging out of the fissure like a tide.

"Come on, you bastards! You'd better bring your Ant Queen out too!" Old Man Liu shouted, wielding his thick-backed saber.

"Quick, they're already charging!" Qin Ming pulled him, and they began running up the mountain.

The two weren't worried that the Silver-headed Ants wouldn't chase them. They had scattered honey and beast blood along the way, and these creatures were no longer ordinary ants; they possessed an extremely strong territorial awareness and were incredibly fierce. Invading their nest would provoke immediate retaliation.

"How are some of these Silver-headed Ants flying?" Qin Ming hadn't even run a hundred meters when his back armor began clanging.

"What's going on?" Old Man Liu was also baffled. At least a hundred fist-sized flying ants were charging at them, far exceeding their normal counterparts.

"You're asking me?" Qin Ming felt something was wrong. This old man seemed a bit unreliable. Wasn't he supposed to know the mountain's conditions like the back of his hand? He didn't even know there were flying Silver-headed Ants!

Old Man Liu, while slashing at the flying ants with his thick-backed saber, replied, "It must be that the spiritual essence within the ant nest is too abundant, causing some Silver-headed Ants to evolve. They weren't here five years ago!"

"You... your information is five years out of date?" Qin Ming hammered one after another, striking the fist-sized flying ants. He felt they were quite hard; an ordinary person certainly couldn't smash them in one go.

The flying ants were dark red, with brighter and more numerous silver markings on their heads. Their wings were transparent, and the sound of their flapping wings echoed over the snow-covered ground, quite terrifying.

Their mandibles resembled a pair of large, blood-red pincers. When they landed on a person, they bit with such force that armor clanged loudly, indicating their formidable attack power.

The mere hundred or so that appeared were enough to instantly strip an ordinary person clean.

"It's fine, there aren't many flying ants. These hundred or so aren't enough for us to kill." Old Man Liu continuously swung his saber, while also paying attention to protecting his face.

No sooner had he spoken than hundreds more flew out from the mountain crevice. The terrifying whirring of their wings sounded like metal plates grinding together, extremely chilling.

Qin Ming's expression changed. If they kept coming, thousands upon thousands, that would be a huge problem.

Both had excellent stamina and ran straight to the top of the short mountain in one go.

Around them, hundreds of flying ants swarmed madly, their speed unaffected even in the harsh, freezing environment.

It was like a blacksmith's forge here; Qin Ming hammered one after another, constantly smashing the fierce insects that charged at him.

Old Man Liu was equally ruthless, swinging his great saber, continuous cracking sounds echoing in the bright, snowy light. Ant corpses piled up at their feet.

They stood on the short mountain, looking down. The dark red masses were truly dizzying, as vast numbers of Silver-headed Ants crawled up the snowy slope.

Actually, they didn't even need to scatter beast blood and honey. These fierce insects were too vengeful, with abnormally developed senses of smell, chasing after them simply by their scent.

"How is their speed not slowing down in this extreme cold?"

"It's slowed down slightly, but not enough time has passed. We need to hold out longer."

The two stood on the short mountain and didn't flee, fighting off the fierce flying ants while watching the approaching army of Silver-headed Ants, which grew closer and closer.

"Their speed has slowed. They might actually freeze if we wait a bit longer."

"Let's set fire to a batch first, give them some warmth, and try to draw out more Silver-headed Ants from the nest."

The two swung their sabers and wielded their hammers, all while remembering to light torches. To enter the ant nest, they first had to eliminate the ant army below.

"Be careful, don't throw the torch in the wrong spot!" Old Man Liu warned, truly fearing that Qin Ming, being clumsy, might prematurely detonate the earth explosives.

Those were by-products from hermits refining medicinal powders, which later spread and were gradually utilized by people.

"Don't worry!"

Soon, certain sections of the short mountain, where firewood had been laid, began to burn fiercely due to the flame oil poured over them.

Many Silver-headed Ants were burned to death, but this only incited the army's ferocity. Fearless of death, they continued to surge upwards like a tide.

"The second wave of ant army has charged out of the nest!" Old Man Liu exclaimed.

The worst-case scenario hadn't occurred; there weren't as many flying ants as they had imagined.

Suddenly, Old Man Liu cried out, and with a clang, he was knocked down by a giant flying ant, tumbling into a snowdrift, immediately buried by a swarm of flying ants.

Qin Ming's heart jolted. He saw a flying ant even larger than a human head, predominantly blood-red, with silver markings all over. It had not only mutated once but seemed to have undergone a second mutation.

He immediately rushed over, swinging his hammer to smash it. However, this second-mutated flying ant was incredibly fast, dodging in an instant and diving towards Old Man Liu in the snowdrift.

Qin Ming moved like lightning, quickly following up and slamming into this special flying ant.

The second-mutated flying ant didn't want to be hit by the person behind it while it was on Old Man Liu, so it quickly dodged. Enraged, it flew towards Qin Ming, attacking him erratically from left and right.

Old Man Liu cursed as he clambered out of the snowdrift, swinging his saber at the fist-sized flying ants.

"Such a big man like me actually got knocked down by an ant! I've lost all face today! Am I really too old and weak to lift my saber anymore? I... hiss, a second-mutated super flying ant! Little Qin, can you handle it?"

Qin Ming quickly replied and warned, "I'm fine, you be careful. There might be other second-mutated flying ants!"

Old Man Liu's expression turned grave. "That's right. Although the Ant Queen is a third-mutation creature, she's not good at fighting. They must be specially cultivating these flying battle ants."

Qin Ming continuously swung his long-handled black-gold hammer, hitting the flying ant multiple times. It sounded like striking iron, producing crisp metallic sounds; it was incredibly tough.

However, it ultimately couldn't withstand Qin Ming's immense strength. Each time it was hit, cracks appeared on its body, and then with a 'puff,' it was hammered to bits.

"Not good, three more super flying ants have appeared!" Old Man Liu's face changed.

At the foot of the mountain, three distinctly oversized flying ants emitted terrifying whirring sounds, flying upwards. Behind them were six slightly smaller flying ants, but still far superior to ordinary ones.

"Three second-mutated, six first-mutated. This insect nest is indeed difficult to deal with!"

As for the ordinary Silver-headed Ants, some had already crawled up the mountain. While the main force behind them was slow, seeing the two so close, they still charged upwards.

"Almost done!" Qin Ming said, blocking the three strongest flying ants.

Upon hearing this, Old Man Liu quickly lit the fire. With a 'boom,' the pre-buried earth explosives took effect, triggering an avalanche. Amidst the rumbling, vast numbers of Silver-headed Ants were buried below.

They had calculated the time, believing the ant army was already close to freezing, so being buried like this meant most would likely not crawl out and ninety percent would freeze to death.

"You little ant, you want to knock me flying? I won't stand for that!" Old Man Liu blocked a second-mutated flying ant, engaging it in a fierce battle.

"So tough, I can't cut it with one strike!" Old Man Liu was flustered, as there were other ordinary flying ants around.

Qin Ming fought with all his might, faint golden ripples even appearing on his body. Amidst clang after clang, he finally successively smashed two second-mutated flying ants. Then, he twirled his long-handled black-gold hammer into a whirlwind, and with continuous thudding sounds, ant corpses constantly fell around him.

"Don't move, let me do it myself!" Old Man Liu was very strong-willed, and eventually killed that second-mutated flying ant himself.

After they dealt with the Silver-headed Ants that had climbed the mountain and hadn't frozen yet, they both let out a long breath.

"We've done a good deed for the people by eliminating this threat in advance. If the Ant Queen were to undergo a fourth mutation and the Silver-headed Ant population exploded, nothing would be left in their wake," Old Man Liu said, flopping down onto the snow.

"It's not over yet, another large group is coming out of the mountain crevice," Qin Ming reminded him.

Old Man Liu's face turned green when he heard that. Fortunately, there were no second-mutated flying ants this time, just dense masses of ordinary Silver-headed Ants crawling up again.

"Not as many as the last wave. Once these are killed, we should be close to done."

They couldn't trigger another avalanche now. The batch of Silver-headed Ants below seemed to have heard a command, returning to their nest before freezing.

"Let's go down the mountain and lure them out near the ant nest to kill them at close range."

Even Qin Ming was tired today, having been killing ants continuously.

Yet, the shallow night was almost over, and still, large numbers of Silver-headed Ants were crawling out.

As for Old Man Liu, he was already dispirited, barely able to lift his saber.

Fortunately, this area was very remote, and no other creatures dared to build nests near the Silver-headed Ants, so no mutated creatures were drawn to spy on them.

"Let's continue tomorrow!"

In recent days, some villagers had entered the underground caves of the Great Rift Valley and brought out some excellent weapons, causing a sensation and leading more people to go there to seek their fortune.

Many of the weapons and armors were left behind by the deceased disciples of major clans from Chixia City, naturally, all of them were exquisite.

Qin Ming and Old Man Liu never expected that, from the first day of eliminating large numbers of Silver-headed Ants, they had been killing for three consecutive days and still hadn't completely cleared them out.

"I think we're almost done today. We could even force our way into the ant nest now."

"You're an old jinx, you should say less of such things!"

On the fourth day, as the two walked and chatted, Qin Ming paused as they passed the Great Rift Valley. He rubbed his eyes, confirming he hadn't seen wrong—a black mist, like a spiritual serpent, was rapidly moving within the valley.

"Old man, look over there, at the Great Rift Valley..." Qin Ming gestured.

"Look at what? There's nothing there." Old Man Liu was surprised, looking utterly bewildered.

Qin Ming said nothing more, feigning blurry vision. His heart was far from calm; he secretly guessed that it must be because he had absorbed the mysterious liquid, allowing him to perceive the abnormal black mist.

"Old man, I asked you to help me contact those once-prominent but now fallen sects. Is there any news?"

Old Man Liu said, "One family has relented. I think it won't be a problem."

"That's great!" Qin Ming was overjoyed.

"You two, come over here! What were you looking at just now?" Suddenly, a voice came from afar. Two figures appeared one after another near the exit of the Great Rift Valley.

Both had a powerful presence, clearly dangerous experts, causing Qin Ming's heart to sink.

Old Man Liu looked at the emblems on their sleeves and whispered, "They have golden patterns on their sleeves, meaning they've been initially recognized by the Golden Bandits. These two should be the leaders of Golden Rooster Ridge, the two strongest great bandits there."

Then, he shut his mouth and pulled Qin Ming forward, walking away.

Qin Ming naturally knew about these two great bandits, especially having heard many rumors about them recently. They were fourth-stage Newborns, among the strongest individuals in local organizations.

What were these two doing in the Great Rift Valley? Was that black mist related to them? He felt suspicious.

"Dawdling, hurry over here!" one great bandit shouted.

"We just want to hunt in the mountains; we're just passing through," Old Man Liu said, adopting a very low posture.

The two great bandits appeared to be around forty years old, with cold gazes. One of them grabbed Old Man Liu by his collar, lifting him up.

"Although he's a Newborn, he's too old and useless!" this great bandit commented, then threw Old Man Liu to the side, making him stumble and almost fall to the ground.

He came before Qin Ming and said, "You're so young and already a Newborn, that's quite good."

Then, he grabbed Qin Ming's collar and said, "Golden Rooster Ridge will be recruiting people in the next two days. Remember to sign up, understand? I've already memorized your face!"

This great bandit spoke calmly, without raising his voice, but his tone brooked no argument.

"Alright, don't worry, I'll take him to sign up then," Old Man Liu quickly said. He feared Qin Ming, being young and hot-headed, might retort against the great bandit, which would inevitably lead to a deadly disaster!

"You're so old, am I supposed to keep you around to eat free food?" The great bandit glanced at him.

"I meant I'll send him to sign up," Old Man Liu explained.

"Hmm!" The great bandit nodded, releasing Qin Ming's collar.

"I asked you a question just now. Are you mute, or did you not hear me?" The other great bandit suddenly spoke, reprimanding Qin Ming coldly.

"I didn't quite process it at first. Yes, I'll go sign up then," Qin Ming said, nodding.

Arriving near the ant nest, Old Man Liu cursed colorfully, unleashing a torrent of abuse, truly fuming with pent-up frustration.

Afterward, he quickly urged Qin Ming not to be impulsive and to absolutely endure this time, to go sign up first.

"You're still young, and already this strong. You'll be even more powerful in the future. Anything is possible, then..."

Qin Ming cut him off, saying, "Then I'll single-handedly, at night, infiltrate Golden Rooster Ridge and wipe out all the bandits there!"

Old Man Liu quickly stopped him, saying, "Hush, you mustn't say such things! Think about it again when you're a fourth or fifth-stage Newborn!"

Next, things went smoothly for them. After breaking into the ant nest, they found that the Silver-headed Ant army had indeed been largely eliminated by them over the previous three days.

The Ant Queen finally appeared. It was a silver worm. Although it was a third-mutation creature, it was indeed not skilled in combat. Its only strong point was the luminous liquid it spat from its mouth, which had strong lethality, astonishing penetrating power, and could corrode armor.

Upon first encountering it, Qin Ming and Old Man Liu were caught off guard by its wild spraying liquid and narrowly avoided being hit. Their first layer of armor was pierced, but fortunately, they had another steel plate over their chests.

After that, the battle had no suspense. The strongest battle ants had already been eliminated, and without the protection of a massive number of Silver-headed Ants, the Ant Queen was quickly dealt with by the two.

"We're rich!" Old Man Liu exclaimed, arriving deep within the ant nest. His eyes gleamed as he saw the honey wine sealed within the ant wax. Although most of it had been consumed during the winter, even the small amount remaining was incredibly valuable.

Qin Ming said, "Let's bury it for now. If we really sell it, our status as third-stage Newborns will definitely not remain a secret. The bandits from Golden Rooster Ridge are acting like monsters lately; if they find out, there will be trouble."

Old Man Liu naturally understood this, nodding in agreement.

Immediately, they discovered faint golden spiritual substance. Both instantly showed expressions of pleasant surprise and excitement, realizing there was enough for the two of them.

Back home, Qin Ming gazed at the pale golden liquid in the porcelain jar, his emotions stirring, his heart pounding with excitement.

Many things had happened recently, leaving his heart restless. But as long as he was strong enough, all the troubles he encountered would cease to be problems.
