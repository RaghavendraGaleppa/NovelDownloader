# Chapter 44: The Perilous Dragonrise Mountain

Outside the southern city gate.

Under the watchful eyes of many commoners, the so-called immortal masters' procession vanished into thin air. This spectacle stirred excitement among the crowd, especially those whose children had been accepted as disciples. They already envisioned their families' meteoric rise—imagining their children returning home someday, visiting on flying swords, a sight too magnificent for words.

This immortal master recruitment far surpassed the previous spectacle when the Lu family's so-called "genius child" was taken away by a single old man without any ceremony.

Xiao Ji, reading the thoughts of those around him, felt a pang of pity. These people had been deceived yet were singing praises for their deceivers.

If he were to reveal the truth to them, they wouldn't sleep well for days.

"Taoist Xiao, that bear demon you mentioned has disappeared with the group," Song Yuanbao said nervously. If the target was lost and the children couldn't be recovered, he'd face the grim prospect of losing his job in middle age.

Xiao Ji and Song Yuanbao arrived at the spot where the group had vanished.

**[Simple one-time spiritual energy transfer array. Array foundation buried half a zhang underground. Transmission distance: two li. Destination: the wilderness leading to Dragonrise Mountain...]**

Transfer arrays weren't particularly rare—many cultivators could easily purchase books on them—but their quality varied greatly, with the main issues being distance and instability, like the one Xiao Ji was currently inspecting.

To address instability, clever cultivators looking to make extra spirit stones proposed shortening the transmission distance and using disposable arrays. After continuous refinement, short-range one-time transfer arrays emerged.

Professional array masters strongly opposed these shoddy contraptions. The transfer array manuals on the market were not only ineffective but dangerous. They had once advocated for banning the sale of such inferior manuals, urging people to spend a bit more to hire professional array masters for proper transfers.

But it was futile—everyone wanted cheap solutions.

Transfer arrays operated point-to-point, with unalterable routes. Thus, even without knowing the bear demon's exact destination, Xiao Ji could trace their path by examining the subtle clues left by the array.

"There's a transfer array here, prearranged. We just need to follow the spiritual energy lines to find these human traffickers' lair," Xiao Ji said calmly, having already gathered sufficient information. "Let's head there now. Don't bring too many people—we might alert them. Especially don't bring that subordinate of yours named A'Sui."

Though just a constable, Song Yuanbao had interacted with officials from the Demon-Suppression Division and had some understanding of transfer arrays.

But knowing about them didn't mean he had experience using them or fully comprehended their workings.

"Taoist, should we use this transfer array too?" he asked, eager to try.

Xiao Ji immediately rejected the idea. "No," he said firmly. "It'll explode."

Song Yuanbao: "..."

Xiao Ji wasn't exaggerating to scare him. One-time transfer arrays truly could explode. They were called "one-time" precisely because their energy capacity was limited—the array's foundation couldn't sustain a second transmission. Attempting another use would cause it to fail, which was also the root of their instability.

High-quality transfer arrays required expensive materials, allowing repeated use over greater distances. Even then, major sects restricted their use to elders and stewards during emergencies due to high maintenance costs. Most arrays were reserved for life-or-death situations.

In contrast, simple one-time arrays used cheap materials. If mishandled, they could indeed explode, obliterating anyone mid-transit.

Xiao Ji would have preferred an easier method, but his perception warned of an explosion, so he had to disable the array first.

"Two li east, into the grove—that should be the other end of the transfer. Let's check it out," Xiao Ji said.

...

Beyond Willow Town stretched a range of rolling mountains.

Among them stood Dragonrise Mountain, its shape resembling a coiling dragon.

The mountain was off-limits, teeming with dangers—not just evil spirits using it as cover, but also ferocious beasts that could easily claim lives.

Despite its perils, hunters and farmers still ventured in, seeking pelts, herbs, and precious timber—all for meager profits.

The mountains housed many beasts and demons. Occasionally, a benevolent but powerful demon might cooperate with humans, receiving a "mountain god" title from the local dynasty in exchange for protection, with villagers offering incense—a mutually beneficial arrangement.

But more often, humans and mountain demons clashed violently—humans burning demon lairs one day, demons ambushing travelers the next—escalating tensions endlessly.

The Great Li Kingdom held annual conferences to discuss balancing resource extraction with civilian safety.

Solutions typically boiled down to two:

First, establish friendly relations with local demons—offer them worship in exchange for protecting mountain travelers.

Second, encourage sect development. Any cultivator bold enough to challenge mountain demons for territory would receive imperial subsidies.

Though effective, these were long-term solutions unlikely to show results for centuries—a bitter present for a distant future.

This year, the Great Li Demon-Suppression Division proposed an excellent idea: each commandery would order towns and villages to post exaggerated warnings at dangerous mountain entrances, deterring civilians from entering.

At Dragonrise Mountain's main entrance, a prominent sign stood with terrifying notices:

"Chen Ping'an of Mud Bottle Village, a youth with no backing, entered the mountains to reason with evil spirits after his friend was taken. He remains missing..."

"Tenant farmer Li lost his landlord's sheep and went searching in the mountains. Neither he nor the sheep were seen again..."

"Ye Bufan, a city dweller, drove up to watch the sunrise. Only his carriage returned..."

Some notices were weathered, others freshly posted—all warning of the mountain's dangers.

Xiao Ji, Song Yuanbao, and five brawny constables stood before the sign.

"Taoist Xiao, Dragonrise Mountain isn't as complex as the ranges near Falling Scales Town, but it's still vast. Where do we start?" Song Yuanbao's reliance on the Original Divinity Temple's Taoist had grown steadily stronger.

Xiao Ji paused, then pointed at the snowy mountain path. "Isn't it obvious? There are footprints right here."

Though spring had arrived, the cold lingered, and mountain snow melted slowly. The entrance path bore many footprints—including massive beast tracks.

"Ah, the simplest way is often the best," Song Yuanbao said, as if enlightened. "Though it's not simple at all—I never would've thought of it."
