# Chapter 31: The First Signs of the Talisman Source Spiritual Body  

The technique for crafting talisman paper was already deeply ingrained in Chu Ning's mind—now it was time to put it into practice.  

The key to making talisman paper lay not only in the quality of the Ink Spirit Bamboo but also in the precise application of multiple spells. Since talisman paper was meant to store spiritual energy for creating talismans, the entire process required continuous use of magic and spiritual power.  

Chu Ning first picked up several stalks of Ink Spirit Bamboo and cast a Cleansing Spell to remove surface impurities. Then, with a few Blade Wind Spells, he stripped away the leaves and cut the bamboo into segments. Throughout this process, he intermittently used Telekinesis—the leaves were gathered into a basket, while the bamboo sections fell into a cauldron.  

After his recommendation was approved, Zhuang Yunde had provided Chu Ning with a set of tools, including this very cauldron.  

Next came the Nourishing Rain Spell. The amount of water required wasn't excessive, so Chu Ning cast it effortlessly. Soon, the cauldron was filled with spiritual-infused water.  

Once again, he employed Telekinesis, stirring the bamboo segments to soak them thoroughly and further cleanse any remaining impurities. After this, he used Telekinesis and the Cleansing Spell in succession to lift the bamboo from the cauldron and remove the water and residue.  

Another Blade Wind Spell reduced the bamboo segments into fine shreds, which he then returned to the cauldron. Adding more purified, spiritual water summoned by the Nourishing Rain Spell, Chu Ning's expression grew more focused.  

The crucial stages of boiling and forming the talisman paper were about to begin—the quality of the final product depended on these next steps.  

With a Fireball Spell, he ignited the specially prepared wood beneath the cauldron and began boiling the shredded bamboo. To aid the process, he cast the Boiling Spell, accelerating the breakdown of the bamboo fibers.  

With the assistance of the auxiliary spell, the bamboo quickly turned into a pulpy slurry. Chu Ning carefully extended his spiritual sense into the mixture, feeling the distribution of fibers and impurities.  

**Cleansing Spell!**  

He cast it instantly, meticulously removing every trace of impurity from the cauldron. As he did, the slurry gradually whitened. By the time all impurities were gone, the mixture was a pristine white.  

Using Telekinesis, he transferred a portion of the slurry into a mold, where it spread evenly into a thin layer under the guidance of his spiritual power.  

**Drying Spell!**  

Another incantation, and half the moisture was drawn from the paper. A creamy white sheet peeled away, which Chu Ning set aside.  

However, this was not yet true talisman paper—it still lacked the most critical step.  

Rather than rushing ahead, Chu Ning repeated the process, producing several more sheets. Once all the slurry was used, he cleaned the cauldron and began boiling again—this time with the bamboo leaves he had set aside earlier.  

Under the Boiling Spell, the leaves soon dissolved into a green liquid. Chu Ning's expression grew even more solemn.  

The most crucial step in talisman paper production was using Telekinesis to evenly coat the newly formed sheets with this liquid. Only then could the paper properly hold spiritual energy for talisman crafting.  

This step was also the most difficult—any unevenness would render the sheet useless.  

*"I hope the Talisman Source Spiritual Body can help here,"* Chu Ning thought to himself as he cast Telekinesis once more.  

Carefully, he guided the green liquid onto the paper. But perhaps due to nervousness, his control faltered—the liquid spilled in a single spot, ruining the sheet.  

Sighing, he tried again. This time, he managed to coat half the sheet before another mistake forced him to discard it.  

Two failures in a row made Chu Ning frown. Instead of rushing into a third attempt, he sat cross-legged and cycled his spiritual energy through a minor circulation, calming his mind.  

Once refreshed, he resumed with renewed focus, his body no longer tense.  

At that moment, he entered a strange and wondrous state—it was as if the bamboo leaf liquid was an extension of his own senses, as if he had merged with it.  

Acting almost instinctively, he spread the liquid across the paper with flawless precision, as though he had done this countless times before.  

Without pause, he moved on to the next sheet, continuing until the cauldron was empty. Only then did he exit that profound state.  

When he examined the papers, each now bore a faint green sheen.  

*"Was this the Talisman Source Spiritual Body at work?"*  

A spark of joy lit in his heart—he hadn’t expected to master the most difficult step so quickly.  

But there was no time to dwell. He immediately cast the Drying Spell again, evaporating the remaining moisture. The green tint faded as the liquid fully absorbed into the paper, transforming its creamy white into a pale yellow.  

Encouraged, Chu Ning dried all the sheets, then used Blade Wind Spells to cut them into standard talisman paper sizes. Soon, a neat stack of pale yellow paper lay before him.  

Only then did he pick up a sheet to inspect it closely. A smile tugged at his lips.  

Success!  

And on only his second attempt!  

Such a success rate was unimaginable for most.  

Reflecting, Chu Ning realized two key factors: the Talisman Source Spiritual Body was undoubtedly one, explaining his sudden mastery of the final step. The other was the exceptional quality of his Ink Spirit Bamboo.  

After Zhuang Yunde's inspection, Chu Ning had divided his bamboo into two batches. One, meant for submission to the sect, received slightly less frequent applications of the Verdant Spring Spell. The other, reserved for his own use, was nurtured more intensively, resulting in superior quality.  

He had deliberately avoided cultivating all his bamboo to peak quality—modesty was necessary. A new disciple producing slightly better bamboo was plausible, but if his yield surpassed even seasoned disciples, suspicions would arise.  

Now that he had already demonstrated an affinity for the Evergreen Wood Art, it wouldn’t be unreasonable for his Verdant Spring Spell to be marginally more effective.  

With that in mind, Chu Ning tidied his workspace.  

Barring any surprises, Zhuang Yunde would arrive tomorrow to collect the bamboo.  

The only question was whether his proposal would be accepted.
