Chapter 62: Ambush on the Mountain Path

The Red Candle Inn in Qingning County.

Inside a room, three young heroes of the Jianghu—Yang Huayu, Liu Xian, and Yun Fei—were conversing.

"Qinghaitang went to seek help," said Yang Huayu. "A whole night has passed, yet she hasn't returned. Could something have happened to her?"

"You worry too much, Brother Yang," Yun Fei said calmly. "Qinghaitang holds a distinguished status. She is the daughter of the Divine Constable Li. Who would dare to make a move against her?"

"I'm afraid there are always those who are blind to the consequences," Liu Xian remarked.

Yang Huayu said, "The Cloud Dweller Fairy has already entered the Essence Devouring Realm. He is no easy foe to deal with. If we let him escape again this time, what will we do?"

"Heh heh, aren't we in the Essence Devouring Realm as well?" Liu Xian smiled smugly. "If it weren't for his exceptional lightness skill, he would have been caught long ago."

Including Li Qinghaitang, all four were pursuing the Cloud Dweller Fairy. Li Qinghaitang, the Divine Constable's daughter, was only fifteen or sixteen. Having just entered the Jianghu, she needed to capture a criminal to make a name for herself.

Yang Huayu was the young master of the Yang Manor in Ziqiong County. His cousin had been abducted and consumed by the Cloud Dweller Fairy, giving him a deep-seated hatred for the villain.

Liu Xian and Yun Fei came from Qiongtian Mansion and were also tracking the Cloud Dweller Fairy for various reasons.

They met on the road and joined forces to hunt him down. However, the Cloud Dweller Fairy was cunning and slippery, repeatedly escaping dangerous situations.

They chased him all the way to Qingning County.

Just as they were talking, Li Qinghaitang rode back and entered the inn to meet up with the three of them.

"How did it go?"

The three immediately gathered around.

Li Qinghaitang nodded. "The person at the manor is Wen Caitang."

"Wen Caitang?" Liu Xian opened his folding fan with a graceful air. "Is she the renowned 'Madam Broken Sword' of the Jianghu?"

Li Qinghaitang replied, "Precisely, it is her."

"If we can get her help, the Cloud Dweller Fairy will be nothing to deal with," Yang Huayu sighed.

"Heh heh, how could she lower herself to kill a mere Cloud Dweller Fairy?" Li Qinghaitang said. "However, out of respect for my father, she did lend me thirty men."

"Oh? Where are they?" Yun Fei asked, delighted.

Li Qinghaitang opened the window and pointed to the street below, where thirty men were standing and waiting.

Yang Huayu said, "If these men have some martial foundation and work together to surround and kill him, it should be more than enough."

Li Qinghaitang said, "A direct confrontation is still not ideal. Although these men are servants, they were borrowed using my father's name."

"The more of them die, the greater the debt of favor my father owes her. And I simply don't want my father to owe her anything. Everyone knows she has many enemies."

Liu Xian sighed in admiration, "Madam Wen's charm is unparalleled, her appearance noble and captivating, making people covet her. But she is not one to be trifled with either. Her methods are ruthless, and her heart is as venomous as a snake's. I heard that in her youth, Fang Meng of the Flower Cage Sect was skinned and had his heart torn out by her."

"That's a deep grudge," Yun Fei said. "Fang Meng was the nephew of the Flower Cage Sect Master."

"Tch, the Flower Cage Sect wasn't any better either. My cousin was beautiful, so they sent people to harass her, trying to capture her," Yang Huayu said.

Yang Huayu's cousin, Yang Mengluo, was a famous beauty. Unfortunately, her beauty was a curse, and she was captured by the Cloud Dweller Fairy, dissolved into blood water and consumed.

This was why Yang Huayu hated the Cloud Dweller Fairy so intensely, vowing to kill him no matter what.

"Enough, we have business to attend to," Li Qinghaitang interrupted. "You all follow the plan. I will go teach them the Iron Net Catching Criminal Formation."

"Good!" Liu Xian, Yang Huayu, and Yun Fei said in unison.

Outside Qingning County.

"Ten of you form a group. Four will hold the iron nets, two will hold long spears, two will hold iron shields, and two will hold long bows."

"Listen for my command, form the formation!"

Li Qinghaitang raised her command flag, arranging the formation for a temporary drill.

She simplified her family's "Iron Net Catching Criminal Formation" and taught it to the men.

This formation was simple and easy to learn, emphasizing tacit cooperation. To master it required long-term coordination, but to simply grasp the basics didn't take long.

Li Qinghaitang held a long bow, observing the changes in the formation. She felt it was quite extraordinary. Every person's position and angle followed the principles of the Eight Trigrams, coordinating and restricting each other, forming a single entity.

Advance and retreat, attack and defense, real and feint... This ten-man formation had endless variations.

But the killing move lay with the archer.

"If I were trapped in this formation, I would have no choice but to surrender."

Putting herself in that position, she realized she had no way to break the formation. What surprised Li Qinghaitang even more was that this formation did not require strong martial arts.

One only needed to be smart enough to quickly understand and apply it flexibly.

"Very good, very good."

Seeing that everyone had mastered it, Li Qinghaitang nodded, greatly pleased.

She then called Li Xian and the other two second-class guards to her side and said, "The Cloud Dweller Fairy has a very peculiar appearance and is easy to recognize."

"He is currently hiding in the mountains."

"Later, I will enter the mountains with my companions to search. With my ability to track and trace, we will find him soon. He will surely resist desperately and try to escape with his life. This thief's lightness skill is excellent, and we cannot catch up to him."

"You will listen for my command and ambush him at three strategic intersections beforehand. You need not worry about anything else."

After briefly explaining the situation, they parted ways. Li Qinghaitang joined up with Liu Xian, Yun Fei, and Yang Huayu to enter the mountains and search.

Li Xian and the others headed for the pre-arranged mountain path to set up an ambush in advance.

If they encountered the Cloud Dweller Fairy, they were to focus on restraining him with all their might.

"Master Li, what should we do if we really run into the Cloud Dweller Fairy?"

A third-class guard in the group asked with some concern.

"If we do encounter him, then we'll have a go at him," Li Xian said calmly. "Remember the formation. As long as we don't panic, taking him down won't be difficult."

In his heart, he wasn't confident either. But in front of his subordinates, he had to appear as if he had a well-thought-out plan; otherwise, if morale were to drop, they would be a disorganized mess.

At noon.

Li Xian led the team and arrived at the mountain path.

The path was long. The first half was overgrown with vegetation, making it perfect for hiding. The second half had a completely different terrain, with towering stone pillars and narrow mountain crevices.

He made a gesture, signaling everyone to hide in the grass on both sides of the path and wait for the fish to take the bait.

"The Cloud Dweller Fairy sounds intriguing. I both hope to run into him and fear it. My feelings are quite complicated."

"If I do meet him, I'll get to see what a so-called Jianghu criminal looks like and just how厉害 (powerful) he is."

"If I don't, it would be nice to go back and collect a reward from Commander Pang for nothing."

Li Xian held his breath and focused his spirit.

He wasn't concerned with Li Qinghaitang's progress; he just silently focused on his own part.

"This mountain path is treacherous. The Cloud Dweller Fairy certainly knows how to hide."

"I wonder how Li Qinghaitang and the others plan to find him if he's hiding in a place like this."

A long time passed with no movement. Li Xian pressed his ear to the ground.

Listening for any subtle sounds, everything remained as before.

For several hours, there wasn't a sound. He didn't even see the shadow of the Cloud Dweller Fairy.

He couldn't help but relax a little.

However, around the hour of Shen (3-5 PM) in the afternoon, Li Xian suddenly heard a sound of footsteps.

They were approaching from a distance, at an incredible speed. Li Xian's heart gave a jolt, realizing he'd hit the jackpot. He tossed pebbles at the members of his team to signal that a powerful enemy was coming.

Panic flashed in everyone's eyes.

"Don't be afraid."

Li Xian's eyes offered encouragement as he held up three fingers. He silently counted down from three. The moment he counted to one, a black shadow entered his field of vision.

"Let 'em have it!"

Li Xian roared. The four guards holding nets immediately stood up and threw their iron nets.

The figure was startled, dodging left and right. However, the iron nets spread out in the air, covering a vast area. It was hard to dodge in such a sudden situation.

He was instantly caught in the net.

"Heh heh heh, what nerve, what nerve. More soup has arrived," a sharp, thin voice rang out.
