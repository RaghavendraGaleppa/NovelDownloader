# Chapter 63: The Nineteenth Layer of Hell in the Mortal World!

The Cloudsoaring Heavenly Vessel traversed the Nine Heavens, crossing tens of thousands of miles in mere moments.

Outside the vessel, an invisible barrier shielded them, yet Li Zhengjing could still feel the chilling wind seeping through, bone-piercingly cold.

"When did the First Seat discover it?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"Half a year ago, a certain Li Erlang from the Jian'an Marquis' household died in the capital, while the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect gained a Li Zhengjing of unknown origins. Was this difficult to uncover?" The Ancient Moon Peak Master replied indifferently. "The Jian'an Marquis' methods are quite formidable in the mortal world, their arrangements seamless. Had you remained unremarkable, no one would have investigated, and thus no one would have known. But for the Immortal Sect, if we wish to investigate, even your ancestors five generations back would be laid bare."

Gazing at the distant horizon, he continued, "Your recent rise to prominence has spread beyond the sect, drawing the attention of various factions. Many are eager to uncover your origins. Rest assured, however—the Ancient Moon Peak's Law Enforcement Hall has severed all leads."

Li Zhengjing remained silent. To the Immortal Sect, the Jian'an Marquis' methods were limited. Many traces required time to fade. The Marquis' household likely never anticipated that he would rise so swiftly, becoming renowned within half a year and attracting the scrutiny of the sect's higher-ups.

"I did not summon you aboard the Cloudsoaring Heavenly Vessel to admire the sunset in silence," the Ancient Moon Peak Master said flatly. "To stand amidst the clouds, bathed in twilight—such a sight is beyond the imagination of most mortals in their entire lives. Since you are fortunate enough to witness it, would it not be a waste of your talent not to compose a poem?"

Li Zhengjing studied the Ancient Moon Peak Master for a long moment before turning his gaze to the setting sun. With a sigh, he shook his head. "Sunset and lone ducks fly together, autumn waters merge with the boundless sky in one hue? Yet here, I see only the sunset, no lone ducks, no autumn waters—hardly fitting. How about... Dragons bear jeweled canopies under the morning sun, phoenixes exhale tassels with evening glow? Or perhaps, men say the setting sun marks the horizon's edge, yet gazing afar, one sees no home?"

After reciting several lines, he suddenly murmured with a somber tone, "The sunset's beauty is boundless, yet dusk is nigh."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master's expression remained impassive, but upon hearing this last line, he stiffened slightly before turning to face Li Zhengjing. "You are young, your cultivation progresses swiftly, and your name resounds far and wide. At the peak of your vigor, why do you speak with the melancholy of one already half-buried?"

*Why am I half-buried, old man? Don’t you know?* Li Zhengjing cursed inwardly. *If not for your dealings with the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord, why would I be so despondent?* 

As he pondered how to respond, the Ancient Moon Peak Master spoke again.

"Could it be that you already know—acting as the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's guardian is a capital offense?"

The words struck like thunder, leaving Li Zhengjing dizzy. Before he could recover, the Peak Master continued.

"A few days ago, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official sent word to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, revealing a world-shaking secret and requesting aid. In his message... he specifically mentioned your name."

Li Zhengjing froze. *That old bastard! No honor among thieves—he sold me out just like that?* 

His expression shifted rapidly as he checked the Golden Scroll's fortune-telling page. Seeing that his fate remained unchanged—he would still perish from the backlash of the Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi—he sighed in relief.

Meanwhile, the Ancient Moon Peak Master gazed at the sunset and remarked, "After obtaining the case closure document in Wanlin County, you vanished for several days—precisely the period when the Ghost Valley Spirit Official had a guardian."

"Previously, no one would have suspected a newly advanced inner-energy realm inner disciple like you."

"But you slew the Venomous King Xin Xuan, proving you possess the power to slay true-energy realm cultivators."

"Given this, it is not difficult to deduce that you were the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's guardian."

The Ancient Moon Peak Master's voice was calm. "Do you admit your guilt?"

Li Zhengjing hesitated before replying, "If I said I merely sneaked off to the Dark Flower Alley during those days, would the First Seat believe me?"

The Peak Master's expression remained unchanged. "Do you think I would?"

Li Zhengjing fell silent.

With a sidelong glance, the Peak Master added, "As an Immortal Sect disciple, visiting the Dark Flower Alley is morally corrupt and disgraceful. Upon our return, report to the Law Enforcement Hall for punishment."

"..."

Li Zhengjing's expression twisted oddly before he acquiesced. As the Golden Scroll had foretold, this matter posed no threat to his life.

In truth, he had considered this possibility upon returning to the sect—that his rise to fame might lead others to connect his disappearance in Wanlin County to his role as the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's guardian. 

Yet he hadn't expected the revelation to come so soon. *Fame truly is a double-edged sword,* he mused. *Rising too quickly isn’t necessarily a good thing.*

"There is no need for concern," the Ancient Moon Peak Master said coolly. "If we successfully retrieve the Ghost Valley Spirit Official this time, I shall count it as a meritorious deed on your part."

"Furthermore, even your earlier act of escorting the Ghost Valley Spirit Official out of the sect—should it come to light in the future—will no longer be a crime. It may even be considered a great contribution."

Li Zhengjing blinked. "Why?"

"The Ghost Valley Spirit Official was never an enemy of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect," the Peak Master stated. "This time, he has relayed a message of utmost importance. The Sect Master has ordered me to rescue him and bring him safely back to the sect."

Just as Li Zhengjing was about to inquire further, the Peak Master waved his hand. A gust of wind lifted Li Zhengjing and deposited him onto the deck.

When he looked up again, the Ancient Moon Peak Master was gone.

The First Seat had returned to his quarters, his gaze drifting to the view outside his window.

The sunset had faded, the twilight dimming as darkness encroached.

*"The sunset's beauty is boundless, yet dusk is nigh..."* 

The Ancient Moon Peak Master murmured to himself, "No matter how dazzling the twilight, it lasts but a moment before yielding to the night. If this is so... have I been wrong all along?"

He raised his palm and sighed. "If all proceeds smoothly, we shall return to the sect within seven days. This path... cannot be wrong."

As the last vestiges of twilight vanished, the sky darkened completely.

The Cloudsoaring Heavenly Vessel continued its journey through the heavens.

A sleepless night passed.

At dawn, Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples, vexed by the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's betrayal. Yet he sensed the old man hadn't acted out of malice—mentioning his name to the sect likely concealed deeper intentions.

Most importantly, the Golden Scroll's unchanged prophecy reassured him.

With a human-immortal realm expert residing directly above him, he hadn't dared release Hanging Bird or the Five Elements Creation Tree from the box.

Stepping out of his room, he found Xie Guihai emerging next door.

"You overslept. Breakfast was distributed, but I saved two bowls of congee for you."

"Junior Brother Xie, you're a good man."

Li Zhengjing accepted the congee, downing both bowls in quick succession. Setting the bowls aside, he looked at Xie Guihai solemnly. "Junior Brother Xie, I've never said 'thank you' in my life, but today—"

Before he could finish, the sky abruptly darkened.

Dawn should have brightened the heavens, yet in an instant, gloom descended.

His eyes narrowed as he looked out the window.

"We're here," Xie Guihai said. "When Mount Fengdu collapsed in the past, a million demons emerged, darkening the skies with their sinister aura. Even now, the land remains tainted—devoid of life, barren of grass, the heavens perpetually shrouded."

Shouldering his pack, he added, "Prepare to disembark."

Li Zhengjing carried all his belongings in the Phoenix Tree Box, so he simply followed Xie Guihai onto the deck.

Several true-energy realm elders and inner disciples had already gathered.

As the Cloudsoaring Heavenly Vessel descended, Li Zhengjing peered outside.

The thinning clouds revealed a serpentine silhouette stretching across the land.

Upon closer inspection, the "serpent" was a city—its architecture elongated and narrow, utterly unlike the structures of the Central Plains.

"This is the Twin Nine City."

"Why 'Twin Nine'?"

"Legends speak of eighteen layers of hell in the underworld," Xie Guihai explained quietly. "Twin Nine makes eighteen. The locals call this place... the Nineteenth Layer of Hell in the Mortal World."
