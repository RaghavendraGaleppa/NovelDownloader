# Chapter 84: Demonic Transformation

Shortly after Zhou Qing had sent out letters through the courier, knocking sounds came from the outer courtyard.

Two guards on patrol nearby were carrying a bloodied man with festering wounds at the gate. Before losing consciousness, the man had repeatedly cried out "Zhou Jieyuan."

Zhou Qing recognized him—it was Chang Wanli from the Immortal Mist Sect. Years ago, Chang had brought the sect's orphans to Qingfu Palace seeking medical help. After Zhou treated him, Chang gifted him an animal hide. Zhou later recommended him to serve under Prefect Feng, where he became the chief instructor of the lake and mountain prefecture's naval forces. During the operation at Tai Lake to deal with Zhitong of Golden Light Temple and Qin Bao, leader of the Sea Sand Gang, it was Chang Wanli who led the interception of lake bandits attempting to reinforce the gang.

Now favored by Prefect Feng and thriving in life, why would Chang suddenly appear in Jiangzhou in such a grievously injured state, with wounds that looked eerily unnatural?

---

In the quiet room of the outer courtyard, Zhou Qing stabilized Chang Wanli's condition, using his vital energy to protect the man's heart meridians and administering an antidote.

The poison Chang suffered from resembled that of aconite root toxin, likely derived from some plant. Strangely, his wounds appeared to be from thorny vines, yet the injuries suggested they were inflicted by some formidable whip technique...

Zhou Qing felt something was amiss—could someone really use fresh poisonous vines as weapons?

But judging from the angles of Chang's wounds, some seemed impossible for a normal human to inflict.

After pondering for a while, Zhou Qing waited quietly for Chang to awaken.

Half an incense stick's time later, Chang Wanli finally regained consciousness. Zhou knew that Chang had been left with chronic ailments from his previous treatment. Forcing him awake without allowing his body time to adjust would likely destroy his martial prowess entirely.

For a martial artist, losing one's skills was little different from death.

Seeing Zhou Qing upon waking, Chang gasped, "Zhou... Jieyuan, please... save Lake... Mountain Prefecture..."

His voice was urgent, his words fragmented.

Zhou used his vital energy to regulate Chang's breathing and carefully inquired. He learned that Lake Mountain Prefecture had undergone a terrifying transformation. Strange vines had begun growing from many of the city's wells, which would frenziedly attack and devour any living creatures upon sensing blood.

Prefect Feng and others were trapped in the government office by these poisonous vines. Chang, relying on his martial skills, had fought his way out to seek help in Jiangzhou.

In short, anywhere near water sources in Lake Mountain Prefecture had become extremely dangerous.

Hearing Chang's description of the vines, Zhou's first thought was of the Great Mulberry Tree. Had it continued devouring living beings without Zhou's yang energy to neutralize it, wouldn't it have become another version of these poisonous vines?

---

Was this a resurgence of spiritual energy or the beginning of a demonic upheaval?

Zhou Qing was well aware that in these chaotic times, Lake Mountain Prefecture couldn't be the only place experiencing such bizarre and horrifying phenomena.

Chief Escort Wu had mentioned that reports of hauntings had been increasing across the land in recent years.

"These demons likely grow stronger by consuming flesh and blood, especially human flesh, which probably provides significant nourishment," Zhou mused, recalling how the Great Mulberry Tree's first digestion had been a monk's corpse—a martial artist at that.

A profound sense of crisis welled up in Zhou Qing's heart. Even with his standing as one of the world's top martial artists among humans, facing these demons...

The Great Mulberry Tree could easily subdue ghosts and even refine them into soul fruits.

What about other demons?

The White Crane, the Blood Python... none were ordinary beings, though their intelligence paled in comparison to Zhou's. They didn't unite either.

But unlike ordinary demonic beasts, entities like the Great Mulberry Tree could clearly grow stronger by consuming flesh, their growth rates alarmingly rapid.

The chaos and spiritual resurgence were undoubtedly catalyzing the rise of such demons.

Many likely didn't realize humanity was gradually losing dominance over this world. In some places, unsuspecting people might be nurturing terrifying demons.

Chaotic times?

Apocalyptic times?

Zhou knew that if incidents like Lake Mountain Prefecture's became widespread, the Great Zhou Dynasty wouldn't just descend into chaos—it would face an apocalypse.

The great pine tree of Taihe Mountain could have potentially grown into a fearsome demon too. But Zhou had warned the Taihe Sect against feeding it flesh, and with Zhang Jingxiu keeping watch, any abnormalities could be nipped in the bud.

But could other regions have innate martial artists standing guard? Would they even realize the danger?

"Regardless, I must first visit Lake Mountain Prefecture," Zhou resolved.

Chang Wanli hesitantly added one last piece of information: while escaping Lake Mountain Prefecture, he had passed the border between Jiangzhou and the prefecture, where a sinister blood vine grew by Tai Lake. It was distinctly different from the poisonous vines in the city and gave Chang an overwhelming sense of terror.

He had kept far away, not daring to approach.

Chang suspected the city's poisonous vines might originate from that blood vine's location—the very spot where Zhou and others had disposed of Qin Bao of the Sea Sand Gang and Fierce Tiger Taoist into Tai Lake.

Chang clearly realized that the flesh-devouring vines grew stronger by consuming living beings.

However, the city's vines were temporarily safe as long as one kept distance and avoided spilling blood nearby.

---

Most critically, water sources had to be avoided.

Affluent households with wells became the hardest-hit areas during this vine outbreak.

Jiangzhou would need to strengthen its vigilance in this regard.

But like plagues, if any place grew negligent, the situation could rapidly escalate with severe consequences.

Prefect Feng asked Zhou whether they should invite local gentry and commoners to witness their eradication of the blood vine—the source of this calamity. After brief consideration, Zhou agreed.

The most terrifying aspect of demonic anomalies was the unknown. Overcoming this fear would help people remain calmer during future encounters.

Most crucially, these entities must never taste blood—that was key.

Once deaths began, a chain reaction would follow.

At least that seemed true based on the current vine situation.

Thus, crowds gathered by the lakeside, keeping a safe distance from the blood vine.

The scene somewhat resembled Ximen Bao's flood control from Zhou's past life, except Zhou's opponent wasn't some fabricated river deity by shamans and gentry, but a real demonic entity—the blood vine.

Three innate experts unleashed their auras.

With the imposing might of Mount Tai.

Demon-slaying,

Truth-guarding!

"Ah!" A yamen runner cried out as vines approached, instinctively raising his arm to block—only to have it instantly ensnared.

Seeing this, Feng Xiu immediately drew his blade and severed the encroaching vine.

Sap splattered as the vine recoiled angrily.

Feng Xiu swung his blade calmly but was still struck by a lashing vine. Meanwhile, other vines crept toward Prefect Feng and the others.

The situation spiraled out of control instantly.

Feng Xiu moved to shield Prefect Feng, but halfway there, another vine coiled around him. As he desperately hacked at it, two more vines snaked toward him.

Just as the vines were about to crush him to death, three overwhelming auras erupted. The government office suddenly felt like a blazing furnace, the scorching energy charring the vines.

The vines hissed as if facing something terrifying.

Feng Xiu then saw Zhou Qing—even after years, he remembered Zhou's face.

Clad in a crane-feather cloak, any vine that neared Zhou was repelled by the energy swirling around him. Sword light filled the office, reducing the vines to splinters.

Meanwhile, the two elderly Taoists physically tore through the vines barehanded. What Feng Xiu saw as deadly threats were mere morning glories in their eyes.

Soon, every vine in the office was cleared. Even those in wells retreated, no longer daring to emerge.

"Brother Zhou, you've finally arrived," Prefect Feng sighed in relief, having narrowly escaped death.

"Brother Feng, just call me 'younger brother Zhou,'" Zhou chuckled.

"However you say, elder brother will call you. You saved my life—had you come any later, I'd be done for. From now on, Lake Mountain Prefecture will follow your lead."

He thus established their master-subordinate relationship.

Previously, their prefectures had cooperated as equals. But witnessing these demonic vines, Prefect Feng understood that only divine beings like Zhou could counter such threats. The coming era would be ruled by those with such power.

After all, Prefect Feng had already received reports of supernatural occurrences elsewhere. Now seeing was believing.

Lake Mountain Prefecture wasn't unique.

New times demanded new orders.

Moreover, without Zhou's protection, Prefect Feng doubted he'd survive another such incident.

Grand ambitions meant nothing compared to survival.

Zhou smiled. Out of past camaraderie, he hadn't known how to broach this topic. Now that Prefect Feng took the initiative, both sides maintained dignity.

After brief pleasantries, Zhou returned to business: "Brother Feng, the source of this demonic incident is likely a blood vine by Tai Lake. It extended its reach into the city to grow stronger. Having cleared the vines here, we'll handle the rest in the city—its minions. After eliminating them, dealing with the main vine should be easier. Have your men scout where vines have sprouted so we can purge them all."

Start with the easier targets to understand the vines' traits and eliminate its extensions.

This was Zhou's first time handling such an event—much required trial and experience. Currently, the vines seemed weak; even non-innate martial artists could handle them.

Further verification was needed.

Zhou mused that if mere minions could rival innate experts, they'd stand no chance.

Having gauged the vines' threat, Zhou relied on energy perception to locate them, while Zhishan led the elders under Prefect Feng's guidance to clear other areas.

In terms of martial prowess, Zhishan and the elders surpassed even Zhou himself, so there was no cause for concern.

Under the three innate experts' assault, even at night, the vines were swiftly eradicated. During this process, Zhou discovered their weakness—fire—and spread this knowledge via his thunderous voice.

Some clever citizens had already tried fire but were too intimidated by the vines' ferocity to persist.

Now with Zhou—a celestial figure in mortal eyes—guiding them, confidence soared.

By dawn, the city's vines were cleared.

Even residual roots retreating into wells were severely weakened, no longer an imminent threat.

After two hours of meditation and consuming fasting pills to recover, Zhou and the elders prepared to head toward Tai Lake.

Prefect Feng had already reorganized the city's defenses and discovered that within a mile of the blood vine, not a single fish remained in the lake.

The vine's rapid propagation clearly stemmed from consuming the lake's aquatic life.

Since the incident was recent, most citizens had suffered only fright, with casualties concentrated among well-owning wealthy households.

Though widespread, the vines' lethality was limited. Yet had they consumed all living beings in Lake Mountain Prefecture, Zhou dreaded to imagine how powerful the blood vine might become.

Currently, he couldn't estimate its growth potential.

While only the blood vine required immediate attention, Zhou felt an unusual weight—not from the vine itself, but uncertainty over how many such events might occur. Early intervention was crucial to minimize damage.

Jiangzhou would need heightened vigilance moving forward.

Like plagues, any negligence could trigger catastrophic chain reactions.

Prefect Feng had asked whether to let citizens witness their eradication of the blood vine. After consideration, Zhou agreed.

Demonic anomalies thrived on the unknown. Overcoming that fear would help people remain calm in future encounters.

Most critically, preventing these entities from tasting blood was paramount.

Once deaths began, the domino effect would follow.

At least the vines demonstrated this pattern.

Thus, crowds gathered by the lake at a safe distance.

The scene faintly echoed Ximen Bao's flood control from Zhou's past life—except his opponent wasn't a fabricated river deity but a real demonic entity: the blood vine.

Three innate auras erupted.

With Mount Tai's crushing might.

Demon-slaying,

Truth-guarding!
