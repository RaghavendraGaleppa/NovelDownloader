# Chapter 140: Five Thunders Transformation

Fusong raised his head to look at Zhou Qing, feeling that although his junior brother still wore Qinglingzi's appearance after this retreat, there was an indescribable jade-like purity and transcendent brilliance about him that had nothing to do with physical features.

This was the natural, peerless elegance that emerged when one's cultivation reached a certain realm.

A smile spread across Fusong's face.

He felt like their family tree had grown tall enough to prop up the heavens—who would dare not submit?

Zhang Jingxiu, meanwhile, wore an expression of deep admiration. While his martial prowess might one day reach Zhou Qing's level, such innate temperament was probably beyond his attainment in this lifetime.

Perhaps Ruowang might have a slight chance.

Ever since Zhang Jingxiu and Fusong had befriended Zhou Qing, no matter what difficulties or calamities they faced, as long as Zhou Qing was present, they naturally felt a sense of security.

They knew very well that Zhou Qing only acted when success was certain.

Crane Immortal, however, was unaware of this. Alongside the Jin Family Patriarch and Ye Chong, he was first shocked by the power Zhou Qing had just displayed—this was definitely not something an ordinary early-stage Golden Core cultivator could possess.

But Crane Immortal was deeply worried—as a Golden Core elder, wouldn't Zhou Qing's intervention violate the agreement between humans and demons?

Yet Ye Chong and the Jin Family Patriarch had heard hints from Jin Guang that within fifteen years at most, Patriarch Tianxuan would inevitably reach the end of his lifespan. Currently, the upper echelons of Tianxuan City were all making preparations for the period after Patriarch Tianxuan's passing.

This information had been deliberately revealed by Patriarch Tianxuan to Jin Guang.

After all, Jin Guang was Tianxuan City's only Golden Core cultivator besides Patriarch Tianxuan himself. Many matters concerning the post-Patriarch era were currently being entrusted to Jin Guang's care.

This was also Patriarch Tianxuan's only viable choice at present.

Patriarch Tianxuan understood clearly that compared to entrusting Tianxuan City's future to the Demon Sect, Jin Guang was undoubtedly the far better option.

Therefore, Ye Chong and the Jin Family Patriarch weren't as gravely concerned as Crane Immortal. Once Patriarch Tianxuan passed, the demons would certainly launch a large-scale invasion.

Without Patriarch Tianxuan to hold off the late-Golden Core level great demons, the four Demon Sect leaders would absolutely not come to Tianxuan City's aid.

Thus Zhou Qing's current intervention primarily advanced the inevitable breaking of the agreement by over a decade, depriving Tianxuan City of precious development time.

But could Tianxuan City produce another Golden Core elder in just over ten short years?

Ye Chong and the others found this equally unbelievable.

"This will inevitably affect Tianxuan City's original plans. Yet humanity has gained another Golden Core elder in Qinglingzi. The gains and losses must be weighed from each perspective. The good and bad both stem from him," Ye Chong thought to himself.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fusong didn't consider this issue. They knew that Zhou Qing hadn't merely rescued them—he had outright slain the Greedy Wolf Saint. He must have already weighed these matters carefully.

Zhou Qing's voice rolled like thunder, cleansing the void.

While everyone was lost in their own thoughts, explosive sonic booms erupted across the sky. A terrifying white silhouette manifested in the air, its overwhelming spiritual pressure combined with the continuous sonic booms making even Crane Immortal's scalp tingle.

The crushing spiritual pressure carried the aura of a great demon, instilling a desire to submit in all who felt it.

Now, this sky-shattering, earth-rending force focused entirely on Zhou Qing.

The great demon's voice blanketed heaven and earth:

"Junior, as a Golden Core cultivator, your intervention means breaking our previous agreement, does it not?" The tone was vicious and resolute, as if intending to wipe out every human cultivator at Broken Moon Ridge.

From Zhou Qing's body burst forth a refreshing, water-like divine light. Upon closer inspection, faint multicolored hues could be seen flickering within, instantly blocking the incoming oppressive force.

"Primordial Unity Divine Light!" Crane Immortal exclaimed in shock.

He never expected Zhou Qing to have mastered what was considered the second greatest offensive divine ability in the Jingyang Dao Domain, second only to the legendary Yin-Yang Divine Light of Patriarch Jingyang himself.

The Primordial Unity Divine Light was said to break all Five Elements magic in the world!

With the divine light protecting him, Zhou Qing calmly replied, "It is your demon race who broke the agreement first. Now you dare shift the blame?"

"Humans and their silver tongues can never be trusted. Our Greedy Wolf Saint was not at your human Golden Core level. Couldn't you see that?"

Zhou Qing gave a cold smile, glancing at the bloody rain coalescing around a sinister broken blade below: "Your White Wolf Tribe schemes against more than just us humans. Elder Howling Moon, is this all the skill your avatar possesses while possessing one of your juniors?"

The moment "Howling Moon" was uttered, Crane Immortal and the other cultivators were horrified to the extreme.

They all knew that the White Moon Wolf Tribe's strongest member wasn't their current late-Golden Core supreme elder, the White Moon Patriarch, but rather the ancient monster Howling Moon.

That was a ninth-rank demonic beast—a supreme great demon at the Nascent Soul level.

Only constrained by Patriarch Jingyang's oath was it prevented from attacking humans.

For three hundred years, though Howling Moon had not taken action, both humans and other demons deeply feared this ancient monster.

So he had actually used an avatar to possess the Greedy Wolf Saint! No wonder the Saint, though not at Golden Core, possessed such terrifying power.

Such actions were utterly despicable!

Had Zhou Qing not seen through this, every human at Broken Moon Ridge would likely have fallen today, with Tianxuan City suffering severe blows as well.

An avatar of a Nascent Soul-level ancient monster, even with but a fraction of its true power, was beyond any sub-Golden Core cultivator's ability to resist.

This was no longer a battle on the same dimensional plane.

This was the sword cultivator's common method of travel.

Not the sword-riding flight depicted in many of Zhou Qing's past-life movies and shows—standing on a flying sword and whatnot.

Rather, through lifebound cultivation with his sword, man and blade became one, naturally transforming into sword light that could traverse any distance. Moreover, such sword flight could bypass most arrays and restrictions.

---

Tianxuan City, Patriarch Tianxuan's secluded cultivation site.

"Fellow Daoist, give me the blood curse," Patriarch Tianxuan said directly.

Without hesitation, Zhou Qing tossed over the blood curse wrapped in Azure Sun Spirit Fire. With a wave of his sleeve, a flash of black-and-white light erased both the spirit fire and the bloodworm simultaneously.

"Yin-Yang Divine Light!" Zhou Qing couldn't help his astonishment.

"Indeed, it is the Yin-Yang Divine Light. Unfortunately, the version I cultivated through the Divine Thunder Method is impure, far inferior to Patriarch Jingyang's in his time."

The Yin-Yang Divine Light could dissolve and decompose any divine ability, spell, or magical artifact in the world, said to break all techniques.

Of course, this assumed opponents of similar cultivation levels.

However, when Patriarch Jingyang employed it, he might have been able to transcend levels.

Zhou Qing's Primordial Unity Divine Light was limited to the Five Elements, ineffective against thunder, yin-yang, and other non-Five Elements techniques...

But this was related to Zhou Qing's incomplete mastery. He sensed this divine light's potential extended beyond merely breaking the Five Elements—the term "Primordial Unity" contained profound mysteries.

Though the Primordial Unity Divine Light was said to break all Five Elements magic, its current power disparity with the Heavenly Wolf Divine Light was too great to overcome.

As the Primordial Unity Divine Light continuously dissipated under the Heavenly Wolf Divine Light's assault, this was a case of absolute power crushing all techniques.

Yet the Heavenly Wolf Divine Light's momentum was also checked by the Primordial Unity. Zhou Qing exhaled, infusing Azure Sun Spirit Fire into the divine light.

Originally balanced across the Five Elements, the divine light instantly transformed into a fiery cloud upon receiving the spirit fire, growing with the wind.

The dissolving retreat was immediately halted.

The Heavenly Wolf Divine Light belonged to the metal element, while the Primordial Unity had now fully converted to fire—burning all things while countering metal—swelling continuously into a massive firewall before Zhou Qing.

But the Heavenly Wolf Divine Light was so refined and condensed that it pierced through the firewall as countless strands, bursting forth before Zhou Qing like a hurricane of white light.

A green flying sword appeared before Zhou Qing, its blade light accompanied by thunderous resonance scattering the myriad white strands instantly.

Zhou Qing stood with hands behind his back, expression serene. Only droplets of sweat forming at his fingertips went unnoticed.

In the void, remnants of heavenly wolf essence gathered into a massive white wolf face, cold and fierce.

Zhou Qing laughed boldly at it: "White Moon, what other tricks do you have? Show me."

"Let's go." Before White Moon could speak, Elder Howling Moon's blood-shadow whispered.

The white wolf face dissipated like scattered stars.

Just as the Broken Moon Blade carrying the blood-shadow was about to depart—

The Green Gold Sword suddenly emitted a clear ring, the void humming as green sword light shot toward the blood-shadow.

This move was executed with ultimate suddenness.

No one expected that with the White Moon Wolf Tribe ready to withdraw, Zhou Qing would still pursue relentlessly.

"Junior, you seek death!" Elder Howling Moon's ancient voice sounded again.

Zhou Qing's expression turned icy, showing no fear before this Nascent Soul elder's avatar. This Broken Moon Blade must not be allowed to leave.

If surrender and retreat could make demons spare humans, that would be pure fantasy.

Even the previous human-demon agreement had been won by Patriarch Tianxuan at great personal cost.

Only through struggle could peace be obtained.

In the cultivation world, social relations were forged through battles of strength.

Allowing the Broken Moon Blade to leave today would mean allowing Elder Howling Moon's true form to break his oath sooner.

Though Zhou Qing didn't know how the elder planned to break the oath, he knew this blade was key to the process.

This sudden turn shocked all present human cultivators.

Just when things had calmed—

What was Elder Qinglingzi doing?

As sword light entangled the blade, Zhou Qing's physical form shot through the air, nearly keeping pace with the sword. A large hand wreathed in five-colored thunder light grasped the Broken Moon Blade.

Five-colored thunder erupted.

Heart Fire Thunder, Liver Wood Thunder, Kidney Water Thunder, Lung Metal Thunder, and Spleen Earth Thunder all bloomed simultaneously.

"Five Thunders Transformation Hand!"

This was Zhou Qing's new divine ability formed by fusing his five organ thunders, though only at the "entry" level.

Yet the Five Thunders Transformation Hand's greatest trait was eroding essence, energy, and spirit.

The Greedy Wolf Saint's blood-shadow had long dispersed. Across the blade's surface, a faint blood membrane steadily weakened under the five-colored thunder's assault.

"Audacious!" White Moon's mystical voice shook the heavens.

"White Moon, get back!"

The long-absent Patriarch Tianxuan's voice finally emerged as terrifying energy in the void blocked White Moon.

Zhou Qing's face grew paler, yet the five-colored thunder in his hand intensified until finally eroding the blood membrane completely.

However, a faint bloody mark appeared on Zhou Qing's arm, carrying an indescribable terror.

Zhou Qing's hand firmly gripped the Broken Moon Blade.

Infused with Azure Sun Spirit Fire, the blade grew increasingly feeble.

Zhou Qing's divine sense poured into the blade like a mighty river, thoroughly erasing all remaining traces within.

Since the Broken Moon Blade was originally a fragment of the Demonic Moon, and the Five Thunders Transformation Hand had already destroyed Elder Howling Moon's avatar, Zhou Qing's mid-Golden Core level divine sense easily wiped the remaining marks.

Yet even so, he was struck by Elder Howling Moon's Heavenly Wolf Blood Curse.

"Green Gold Sword!"

The curse's bloody mark spread.

Without hesitation, Zhou Qing severed his arm with the sword.

Simultaneously, Azure Sun Spirit Fire surged forth.

The arm burned completely in the flames, yet a blood-colored worm still writhed within.

Zhou Qing showed no hesitation in amputating himself.

Wrapped in spirit fire, observers couldn't see what transpired.

From his severed arm's wound, flesh buds rapidly regrew a new limb, though Zhou Qing's face lost all color.

"Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi, please meet me at my secluded site in Tianxuan City."

After repelling White Moon, Patriarch Tianxuan transmitted his voice to Zhou Qing.

"I shall pay my respects immediately."

Without delay, Zhou Qing responded.

Wrapping the bloodworm in spirit fire, he merged with the Green Gold Sword into sword light, streaking toward Tianxuan City.

This was the sword cultivator's common method of travel.

Not the sword-riding flight depicted in many of Zhou Qing's past-life movies and shows—standing on a flying sword and whatnot.

Rather, through lifebound cultivation with his sword, man and blade became one, naturally transforming into sword light that could traverse any distance. Moreover, such sword flight could bypass most arrays and restrictions.
