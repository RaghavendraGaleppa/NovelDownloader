## Chapter 30: Kraft Paper

Jian Liang's heart turned cold, and his body tried hard to dodge, but he found it was too late. This sword was too fast, so fast that one could only see a flash of sword light.

Chen Fei's strength and reaction were, at most, at the Body Refining realm. Yet, his swordsmanship was potent, and his cultivation of sword qi was particularly astonishing. At this level, it should have been his peak. How could such a profound sword technique appear on Chen Fei? This kind of swordsmanship should not exist in a place like Pingyin County; even the prominent families in Pingyin County could not possess such a legacy.

"Swoosh!"

A bloodied wound, piercing front to back, appeared on Jian Liang's chest. Although not large, such an injury was already fatal. Jian Liang's offensive involuntarily faltered, and he himself toppled from the wall, collapsing to the ground.

"What kind of swordsmanship is this!"

Jian Liang struggled to look up at Chen Fei, but only saw Chen Fei appear expressionlessly before him, thrusting his sword towards Jian Liang's head.

"Whiz! Whiz! Whiz!"

Three hidden weapons suddenly flew out from Jian Liang's sleeve. Chen Fei's sword light spun, deflecting the hidden weapons, and he saw Jian Liang desperately trying to run into the distance. Chen Fei's feet flickered, and in a few steps, he caught up with Jian Liang.

Chen Fei couldn't help but recall the faint sound of crashing waves that had resonated when Jian Liang attacked earlier. Martial artists typically kept cultivation techniques that hadn't been fully mastered close to their bodies; they wouldn't feel secure leaving them elsewhere. Moreover, they could take them out to review them from time to time, deepening their understanding and advancing their cultivation.

Chen Fei tucked the kraft paper into his bosom and continued his search when suddenly, footsteps sounded. Lowering his head, Chen Fei's face underwent a rapid transformation: his eye corners elongated into phoenix eyes, several scars appeared on his face, and his stature subtly grew a little.

"Third Brother!"

A painful cry rang out. Ling Hanjun looked ahead in disbelief, seeing Jian Liang lying on the ground, covered in blood. Just now, they had broken out of the encirclement, splitting into several groups. His group consisted of him and Jian Liang, and they had found a few courtyards to hide in. If anything unexpected happened, they were to immediately support each other. However, no sooner had Ling Hanjun's group hidden themselves than he heard sounds coming from Jian Liang's direction. Rushing out to investigate, he discovered Jian Liang was already dead. He hadn't died at the hands of the constables, but had perished here instead.

"I'll kill you!"

Ling Hanjun's eyes were bloodshot, wishing he could tear Chen Fei limb from limb, but he could only watch as the distance between them steadily widened.

"To the ends of the earth, I will kill you!" Ling Hanjun roared, then turned and ran off in another direction. Continuing the chase wouldn't yield significant results and would only risk losing more of his subordinates. However unwilling Ling Hanjun was, he could only swallow his anger for now.

Chen Fei sensed the disappearance of the aura behind him. After a moment's consideration, he ducked into an alley. His face rapidly shifted, and his stature simultaneously shrunk a little. A moment later, Chen Fei darted out from another alley, heading towards where Ling Hanjun had vanished.

Unless these bandits were eliminated, Pingyin County would never be peaceful. What Chen Fei needed most right now was time. As long as he had enough stable time, Chen Fei's strength would continuously improve. Currently, killing a Bone Forging realm expert still required relying on the Immortal's Guidance technique. Once Chen Fei grew to the Bone Forging realm, killing these people wouldn't be as troublesome as it was now. For his own sake, Chen Fei resolved to make these bandits disappear from Pingyin County.

He trailed far behind, but after a short while, Chen Fei lost track of the bandits.
