# Chapter 600: The Doppelgänger's Is Mine

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, then muttered to himself.

"The talent of my doppelgänger ultimately reflects the essence of my true self. With this foundation, my future path in the Way of the Sword can truly enter the halls of mastery."

Excellent!

What belongs to the doppelgänger is ultimately mine.

With the aid of the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan naturally shared the Sword Intent of Raging Waves that his doppelgänger, Han Shi, had comprehended.

As Han Shi stabilized his Sword Seat and completely mastered this "Raging Slaughter Sword Intent," the profound essence of this immense, furious Sword Intent, along with the various mysteries of condensing a Sword Seat, passed through the mysterious origin link of the Attribute Panel without any obstruction. It was transmitted with perfect clarity directly to the depths of Xu Yunfan's main body's soul.

The 'Absolute Control' text on the Attribute Panel flickered slightly, ensuring the transfer was precise and flawless.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes. A sharp, sword-like glint flashed within them instantly. His understanding of the "Raging Slaughter" true meaning deepened abruptly, and even his own Dao Heart and will seemed to have been tempered, becoming more refined and resilient.

This comprehension of Sword Intent was like the best nourishment, nourishing his foundation and soul.

Good, very good!

This could be considered another one of his trump cards.

After all, everyone knew he cultivated the Supreme Void Thunderclap Scripture of the Nine Celestials and was adept in various thunder techniques.

If he were to suddenly unleash such a sword, it would definitely give his opponent a huge surprise.

After pondering the Raging Slaughter Sword Intent comprehended by his doppelgänger, Han Shi, and with the assistance of the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan had no trouble understanding it. In fact, due to the numerical characteristics of the Attribute Panel, the Raging Slaughter Sword Intent he施展出来 was even three points stronger than that of his doppelgänger, Han Shi.

"Marvelous!"

Xu Yunfan looked at the tip of his finger, where a sliver of Raging Slaughter Sword Intent flickered.

This Sword Intent grew more powerful the angrier the heart. Such an Sword Intent could only be nurtured by those with deep-seated grievances and an extreme, eccentric personality.

It seemed the shadow he had cast over his doppelgänger, Han Shi, was不小不小.

But then again, among the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, those who could comprehend a Sword Intent were all individuals with extremely condensed will. Only by钻 the牛角尖 (being stubbornly obsessive) could they form various Sword Intent.

After cultivating for half a day, Xu Yunfan then turned his attention to his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, in the Eastern Wasteland.

His mind moved again, his vision crossing endless space and projecting towards the Eastern Wasteland.

The group of four, Tang Sanzang and the others, had long since finished their journey to the Earthly Immortal Sect and continued on. After several decades, they had already traversed the entire Eastern Wasteland.

But at this moment, his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, had fallen into a strange state of silence.

From the outside, he still looked like the defiant monkey carrying his staff, following beside Tang Sanzang. However, his expression no longer held the initial flightiness; instead, it carried a trace of stability that had worn away his monkey nature.

Deep within his sea of consciousness, the golden Buddhist light condensed from the Vajra Martial King Battle Buddha Sutra that Sun Wukong cultivated was now boiling.

This Buddhist light resonated with the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land, and in his heart, he constantly paid homage to the World Honored One, Tathagata.

Chanting his name, contemplating his form, meditating on his image.

A grand, compassionate, universal-saving, awe-inspiring, and boundless power, carrying with it the light of victory, seemed to cross the barriers of layers of time and space. It began to descend in wisps and threads, resonating violently with the Vajra Martial King Battle Buddha Sutra that Sun Wukong cultivated.

This is a disaster!

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but frown deeply.

In the Taihua Void Realm, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the Primordial Origin Sect, and the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land divided the world into three parts.

The佛法 cultivated by the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land was the most诡异. It focused on paying homage to the World Honored One, Tathagata, welcoming the light of his mind, and becoming a Buddha's body.

Everyone is a Buddha, everyone is the World Honored One, Tathagata.

This was also why, after his Master became a Dao Lord, even though he couldn't descend in person, he could still freely enlighten monks and turn them into his avatars.

After all, a Dao Lord, reflecting the myriad worlds, their power and laws would likely crush the Taihua Void Realm.

How could the Dao Lords of the other two sects allow this?

Now, his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, constantly contemplated and paid homage in his heart, and had already formed a connection with the World Honored One, Tathagata.

The other party could随时 turn him into an avatar and then go on a rampage in the newbie village.

But soon, Xu Yunfan's frown completely smoothed out.

In the Attribute Panel, the 'Eight Scenery of Xuandu Forging Creation Cloud Satchel' had long surpassed the original level of this true scripture regarding its Absolute Control characteristic.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to窥探 without the World Honored One, Tathagata, noticing.

It's great to have a system.

After digesting the gains from his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate at all and completely severed the form of the World Honored One, Tathagata, that his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, had brought.

Xu Yunfan's heart was clear, and this scene also confirmed his judgment.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land had used Tang Sanzang's group to travel through the Eastern Wasteland for decades, sorting out the earth veins, subduing demons and vanquishing fiends, and accumulating merit to guide the position of the Sovereign King Buddha. The ritual had already been completely completed.

If one were to rely on walking to measure the Eastern Wasteland, it would take a thousand years to walk through it. How far had Tang Sanzang's group actually walked?

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land must have been constantly arranging things behind the scenes.

This Great Compassionate Radiant Lotus Sovereign King Buddha position was extremely special.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land had used Tang Sanzang's group of four in the Eastern Wasteland to perform the ritual to guide the Sovereign King Buddha position, and it was already complete. This position was not inherent to the Taihua Realm. It was凝聚 by the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land gathering the vows of the Western Continent's sentient beings and paying homage day and night. It was a unique Buddhist position and did not belong to the 108 Heavenly Gangs and Earthly Fiends.

This position was a unique true Buddha position that the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land had spent countless tens of thousands of years to research the essence of Buddhist teachings, gathering the faith and念力 of boundless Buddhist followers, and in a specific King Buddha ritual, using the vows of sentient beings as fuel and supreme佛法 as a mold, to forcibly condense from the void.

Its essence was a creation of faith unique to the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land, yet it possessed a grand and mighty power that rivaled and even surpassed some of the Heavenly Gang Dao Fruits.

It represented a major expansion and victory for the佛法 of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land in the Taihua Void Realm, and was the core goal of its strategy to spread佛法 eastward.

Now that the position was about to be guided, his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, who cultivated the Vajra Martial King Battle Buddha Sutra, resonated with the position, which was naturally of the utmost importance.

At this moment, with the ritual complete, it was the critical moment to truly guide the position's descent, brand it onto the Eastern Wasteland of Taihua, and turn it into the core of this region's laws.

Once the King Buddha position was planted, the Eastern Wasteland would become a Buddhist kingdom on earth. From then on, the position hidden in the Eastern Wasteland would naturally pass through the hands of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land first.

And his doppelgänger, Sun Wukong, as a先天 living stone body cultivated in the Vajra Martial King Battle Buddha Sutra, was the most perfect bearer and fusion node pre-set for this position.

Through the Absolute Control characteristic, Xu Yunfan could feel that his doppelgänger was sensing that powerful summons.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land's attention must be highly concentrated here.

Once it was achieved, it was likely that another great Bodhisattva would appear. But the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land had been enduring and not acting. The other party was also clear that once the position was proven and the Buddhist kingdom on earth was established in the Eastern Wasteland, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect would never sit by and watch.

The reasoning was very simple.

Once the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land successfully anchored this position in the Eastern Wasteland and established a 'Buddhist kingdom on earth' covering hundreds of millions of miles of mountains and rivers.

It would be equivalent to driving an unprecedented wedge into the core area of the intersection between the forces of the Primordial Origin Sect and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

This would be a deep erosion and power projection of Buddhist forces into the Taihua Void Realm.
