# Chapter 34: The Sleeping Children

The King of Yinnan Kingdom treated them so well, fundamentally because he had seen too few cultivators and didn't understand them, hence his caution and fear.

Originally, many cultivators in the cultivation world who had no hope of advancing further and were greedy for worldly riches would have been willing to join secular dynasties, becoming carefree advisors or even controlling the royal family.

But these secular dynasties had long been regarded by major sects in the cultivation world as crops in their own fields. How could they possibly allow down-and-out rogue cultivators to snatch food from their bowls?

Rogue cultivators weren't permitted to join kingdoms, and sects looked down on mortal nations, leading to the current situation.

When Jiang Li and the others stepped out of the carriage, the King of Yinnan was surprised by their youth. In the public eye, immortals were still imagined as white-haired elders. But he didn't dare make assumptions.

"Honored Immortal Masters, you've come from afar. Please come to the palace for a brief rest. Allow us to arrange a grand banquet to welcome and honor you."

The king was quite enthusiastic, and the banquet he prepared would undoubtedly be impressive. Some disciples were tempted, but Yu Banxia at the front had no intention of enjoying such luxuries.

"We came for Yinnan Kingdom's request. Let's not waste time—tell us the details. Also, where are those unconscious children? Take us to them."

With him speaking like this, naturally no one would object.

The king pulled a few officials from the roadside, gave them some instructions, then returned to personally lead Jiang Li and the others.

"Honored Immortal Masters, over two thousand children fell unconscious overnight, and it's already been thirteen days! The best physicians and royal doctors in Yinnan have examined them, and we've tried all kinds of herbs and precious medicines, but they still won't wake up. My poor thirteenth, fifteenth, and seventeenth children are the same—it's driving me mad! Honored Immortal Masters, you must save them!"

The group exchanged glances. So even with his own children in this state, he still wanted to invite them to a banquet first? It seemed that no matter how cherished something was, when the quantity increased, the emotional attachment would dilute—whether it was love or familial bonds.

"Thirteen days unconscious—none of the children starved to death?"

"We had the people feed them thin porridge and flour paste. Though the children are asleep, fortunately they can still swallow, which is how they've lasted until your arrival."

The group understood. Yu Banxia continued questioning, "Before and after the children fell unconscious, did anything unusual happen, or did they eat anything strange?"

But such a simple, ordinary question left the King of Yinnan unable to answer for a long time.

"Forget it. Have your subordinates investigate. Ask the relatives and hometowns of every child—don't overlook any details."

Jiang Li suddenly spoke up, making Yu Banxia realize that trivial daily matters like these were something a king wouldn't pay attention to.

"Of course, of course. I'll arrange it immediately."

With a wave of his hand, a eunuch who had been following at a distance hurried over, received the order, and immediately ran off to relay it to the officials.

Soon, they followed the king into Yinnan's palace. Along the way, they saw many commoners carrying their children toward the palace in large numbers. Soldiers and officials were guiding people through the streets.

When the citizens heard that immortals had arrived to help heal their children, none dared delay, rushing to the palace with their children in their arms or on their backs.

By the time Jiang Li's group arrived, the palace square was already covered with cloths of various colors, with unconscious children lying in a dense, sprawling mass.

This wasn't because Jiang Li's group had walked slowly—it was because the king leading them was too out of shape. Though he looked sturdy, it was all soft flesh, unused to exertion beyond the bedroom. This walk had nearly killed him. His labored panting made Jiang Li and the others worry he might collapse on the spot.

"Honored Immortal Masters, this way, please."

Several obviously "distinguished" individuals stepped forward, relieving the exhausted king, and led Jiang Li's group toward a side hall.

"Why go there? Aren't the unconscious children all here?" Qu Qianfan asked, puzzled. Coming from a martial background, he wasn't familiar with such convoluted social norms.

"Ah, we couldn't possibly have the Honored Immortal Masters examining the commoners under the scorching sun. It would be better to go to the royal clinic in the side hall and have the children brought to you one by one," a richly dressed elder quickly interjected.

But while that was the stated reason, the reality was that the children lying in the open square were all from commoner and peasant families. Those receiving careful treatment in the royal clinic were of royal blood, and even those placed under canopies nearby were children of officials and wealthy families.

People were divided into high and low status—how laughable!

"The more cases we examine, the easier it will be to find patterns. I think we should start by checking the children here in the square," Jiang Li suddenly suggested.

The other disciples paused in surprise but quickly stopped walking. On one hand, Jiang Li's reasoning made sense. On the other, the face of mortals couldn't compare to Jiang Li's standing.

The expressions of the nobles instantly turned ugly and awkward, but even the king didn't dare say anything—how could they possibly make a fuss?

Jiang Li and the others approached a child—a boy around ten years old with flushed cheeks and a thick yellow trail of snot under one nostril. At first glance, Jiang Li saw nothing unusual.

Rather than being unconscious, the boy seemed to be sleeping. Aside from being impossible to wake, they snored, turned over, even talked in their sleep and kicked off blankets. They looked utterly normal—even drunkards slept more soundly than this.

"Qianqian!" Yu Banxia simply called a name, and Lu Qianqian immediately understood. With a flick of her slender fingers, three silver needles appeared between them.

A flash of silver, and the needles vanished into the boy's body. Fortunately, the children's parents had been kept at a distance—if they'd seen this, "medical disputes" might have erupted.

"These needles are coated with red-eyed caterpillar venom. Even a touch causes excruciating pain—no mortal could endure it." It was unexpected that Lu Qianqian, such a sweet and petite girl, would use such vicious hidden weapons.

As soon as the needles entered the boy's body, he reacted—first his body jerked, then he began twisting uneasily. His eyeballs rolled rapidly beneath his eyelids, his lashes fluttering as if he might open his eyes at any moment.
