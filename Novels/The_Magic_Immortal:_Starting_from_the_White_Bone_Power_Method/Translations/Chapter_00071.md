# Chapter 71: She Really Steps Up When Needed

The foot of the mountain seemed crowded with many people, their steps chaotic, heavy, and swift, accompanied by a clamor of voices.

Wang Chan's body tensed as he considered how to escape if those people decided to gang up on him. But then he relaxed. The newcomers were likely patrol guards and cultivators from the Lotus Mountain patrol team. After all, he was a legitimate cultivator of Lotus Mountain—a righteous one at that. What was there to fear?

A breeze swept up from below, lifting the strands of Beauty Mark's hair. The faint scent of spiritual fragrance mingled with the metallic tang of blood in the courtyard, creating a complex aroma. Yet, Beauty Mark's expression was even more complicated. Worried she might attack without warning, Wang Chan kept his eyes locked on hers. If her gaze turned hostile, he would immediately offer her half of Madam Golden Snake's storage pouch.

No doubt, the reason Madam Golden Snake had returned for a counterattack was due to Beauty Mark's coercion. The madam had come back covered in blood, gravely injured and unable to maintain her defenses—clearly at the end of her strength. Facing a group of patrol guards in her condition was hopeless, so she must have decided to drag Wang Chan down with her. At least that way, she wouldn’t go down alone.

Thus, she had handed Wang Chan a free kill. But he had no intention of keeping the credit—not just Madam Golden Snake's, but her sister's as well. Since they were on the wanted list, Beauty Mark would surely appreciate the merit. As for the spoils, unless absolutely necessary, there was no reason to hand them over. After all, to claim this victory, he had essentially lost ten mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans. He deserved some compensation.

Beauty Mark was a proper patrol guard, and the two of them had some rapport—though not yet deep, she owed him at least this much courtesy. If she begrudged him this, he’d never give her even the slightest favor again.

The silence stretched as they stared at each other. Seeing no sign of anger from Beauty Mark, Wang Chan finally spoke lightly, "In broad daylight, Fellow Daoist Tian, asking to see my needles like this—isn’t that a bit inappropriate?"  

Beauty Mark snorted at his playful tone, then seemed to remember something. "You keep the storage pouch. I’ll take the bodies."  

"No problem," Wang Chan agreed instantly.  

Beauty Mark was definitely worth befriending.  

Seeing his quick agreement, a triumphant smile flickered across her face. *Take what’s given, and you’ll owe a favor.* Once he had the storage pouch, he’d surely be more cooperative when she asked for acupuncture later.  

Just as she was about to tease him further, hurried footsteps approached. Her expression instantly cooled. "Fellow Daoist Wang, you’ve got quite the skills."  

When she first arrived and saw his white needles crackling with thunder and wood-attribute energy, she had been startled.  

---

Dual-attribute artifacts—especially mid-grade ones—were rare. If they had belonged to a scion of a noble family, it would have been understandable. But Wang Chan was just a minor rogue cultivator from the wilds.  

What’s more, the power emanating from those needles was formidable.  

During their silent standoff, she had used her Autumn Wind Cicada technique to scan the surroundings. Aside from the thunder and wood energy, there was also a yin-attribute force—though she couldn’t pinpoint its exact nature. Still, it was undoubtedly mid-grade.  

The Golden Snake Sisters’ techniques were well-documented, and none matched this energy. Moreover, Wang Chan’s spiritual power was no longer the unranked kind she had seen before—it was now a pure, low-grade yin attribute.  

Putting it all together, that yin energy had to be his doing.  

The defense he used against the Thunder Sword Talisman was likely an Earth Prison Talisman—an uncommon variant. And the fact that he also pulled out a Golden Armor Talisman was even more unusual.  

But the most baffling detail?  

Both Golden Snake Sisters had identical fatal wounds—a needle through the brow.  

Given that the sisters were no weaklings, for Wang Chan to land such precise strikes meant his combat prowess surpassed theirs—if not overwhelmingly, then at least dominantly.  

Additionally, the younger sister’s exploded eyes suggested a backlash from a soul attack.  

Piecing it all together, Wang Chan’s image in Beauty Mark’s mind became far more defined.  

On the surface, he was an obscure rogue cultivator, a low-grade physician scraping by with nine Rejuvenation Needles.  

In reality, he was an elite rogue cultivator hiding his true strength.  

No wonder he was so stubborn and prideful, indifferent even to a woman like her.  

Talented men were like that.  

Compared to some no-name rogue cultivator, an elite like him was far more suitable for her Spring Longing cultivation technique. The effects would be stronger, and their future cooperation could go much further.  

This was an unexpected boon.  

In an instant, Beauty Mark’s enthusiasm burned brighter.  

*Strike while the iron is hot. Later, I’ll make this stubborn man yield beneath my Mystic Armor.*

"Just luck," Wang Chan said loudly as a crowd of patrol guards and cultivators poured into the courtyard. "If Fellow Daoist Tian hadn’t already wounded her, I wouldn’t have had a chance to strike."  

There was no point in hiding his abilities entirely. Revealing some strength now would save him trouble during his upcoming seclusion.  

Beauty Mark caught his meaning and played along. "Even so, Fellow Daoist Wang’s skills are enough to hold his own against a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator. Capturing the Golden Snake Sisters deserves recognition—a reward of a few hundred spirit coins, at least."  

"You flatter me," Wang Chan demurred.  

The newcomers took in the scene, shocked to see the notorious sisters already dead. Hearing the exchange, their gazes turned to Wang Chan—especially at Beauty Mark’s high praise.  

The patrol guards, in particular, knew firsthand how dangerous the sisters were. One-on-one, only their captain stood a chance. And their captain rarely praised anyone.  

This man clearly had real skill.  

Among the patrol team, many studied Wang Chan carefully, committing his face to memory. Iron Fist even gave him a distant fist salute, which Wang Chan returned.  

"Clean up the bodies," Beauty Mark ordered briskly. "We’re heading back to the station to report."  

The guards sprang into action, eager.  

The Golden Snake Sisters were infamous bandits. Not only would this count as a major accomplishment, but the spoils had to be substantial. Even splitting 30% among them would be a windfall.  

Yet after thorough searching, no storage pouches turned up.  

Madam Golden Snake at least still had her clothes and shoes.  

Her sister had been stripped completely bare.  

"Captain, the storage pouches are missing!" one oblivious guard blurted out.  

Wang Chan’s heart clenched. *Idiot.* Bringing this up publicly made it impossible for Beauty Mark to cover for him without backlash. If he didn’t share some spoils now, future cooperation would be difficult.  

"The Golden Snake Sisters were cunning as serpents," Beauty Mark said coolly. "They likely hid their pouches somewhere along their escape. Huang San, go search for them."  

"...Yes." Huang San paled under her icy stare and scurried off.  

Seeing her determination to monopolize the loot, the others exchanged glances but dared not protest.  

Beauty Mark had engaged Madam Golden Snake alone before they arrived. By the time they showed up, the fight was nearly over—they’d just been spectators.  

More importantly, Beauty Mark was about to leave her post. Who would deny her a final windfall?  

Morale didn’t matter now. With the sisters dead, the mission was accomplished. Even if Beauty Mark spent her remaining days lazing at the station, it wouldn’t affect them.  

In fact, Huang San’s blunder meant he’d likely face her displeasure from now on.  

Wang Chan was surprised.  

Beauty Mark was a true ally—when things got tough, she really stepped up.  

---  

Late at night, the moon hid shyly behind clouds.  

In the courtyard, Wang Chan and Beauty Mark shared wine.  

Her cheeks were flushed, her movements slightly unsteady—clearly tipsy.  

Suddenly, her chopsticks slipped beneath the table.  

Owing to the storage pouch’s generosity, Wang Chan obligingly ducked down to retrieve them.
