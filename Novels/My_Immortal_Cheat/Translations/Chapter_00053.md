## Chapter 53: A Saint's Strike!

Bang! Zhou Tian suddenly sat up, his face grim, eyes filled with fury, his heart clenching. Since Tian Ling had already been struck out of the area enveloped by lightning flames, he could see the scene that had just unfolded, and a hint of regret spread through his heart. Although he knew injuries were inevitable in combat, he still found it hard to accept.

The few people beside him remained silent. To be honest, they didn't really care much about such minor injuries. They had all undergone training since childhood; while they wouldn't die, scars were certainly unavoidable. Tian Ling hadn't been pampered either. Zhou Tian's reaction was simply concern causing chaos; he'd understand once he thought it through.

On the arena, the piece of skin that had been gouged out fell to the side, instantly shriveling and decaying. It didn't look like it had been burned, but rather as if all its life force had been extracted.

Tian Ling's small face was pale. Green light surged from her hand, and the fragrance of plants permeated the air. She pressed it against her wound, green runes swirling around it. The wound healed at a visible rate; the flesh grew back instantly, and her skin became translucent. If not for her tattered clothes, there would be no trace of injury.

This was a healing technique, basically known by everyone. The superficial wound had healed, but internal injuries weren't so easily remedied. She could already feel countless cracks within her vital organs and needed quiet recuperation. After all, she had been directly struck by a Saint Tool. If not for the wielder's slightly weaker cultivation, she would have been instantly annihilated!

But this was not the time for healing. Zhang San emerged from the sea of lightning flames, the armor on his shoulders already self-repaired. However, his constantly twitching body and the lingering lightning flashes clearly indicated that he was not feeling well either.

Yet, he seemed to feel no pain, staring intently at Tian Ling. He came from a humble background, and despite his utmost effort in cultivation, he had only barely broken through the Heavenly Repository realm at the age of twenty. He refused to be a subordinate; he wanted to be superior! Therefore, he had to seize every opportunity he could.

Zhang San's eyes were wide with fury, bloodshot, and he muttered to himself like a madman. Strands of blood-red runes crept onto his body, and his aura intensified. In just a moment, blood-red runes covered his entire body, and the flames around him turned crimson...

"This... this is a forbidden technique. It exchanges life force for strength, but after using it, the person is essentially crippled. Doesn't he know that?" Zhou Xunchuan said with a frown. This was not just a forbidden technique; it was one of the most violent kinds—trading life for power!

"This Zhang San comes from a very ordinary background, with little experience. Those people must have misled him. He also hasn't seen high-level divine abilities, so he naturally wouldn't understand." Zhou Tian explained. He had already sat down, and after his initial impulse, he had come to understand that this world was not his previous one; seemingly terrifying injuries were actually nothing significant here. He had investigated this person. With the intelligence network of the Qin Royal Residence, this person's life history, from childhood to present, had been thoroughly scrutinized.

In the arena, Zhang San's aura soared to its peak, like a demon emerging from hell. A divine pillar of vital energy burst from his cranial crown, rising to the sky like a wolf smoke beacon, immensely thick. The life force of countless future years was blossoming at this very moment!

And that wasn't all. From a mysterious spot within Zhang San's body, a tiny particle emitted golden divine radiance. The blood-red runes spreading through his body seemed to find a ravenous wolf of flesh and blood, pouncing towards that particle, absorbing the power of the golden divine radiance and in turn feeding back even more blood-red runes.

"His body... something's wrong!" Zhang Yi watched the ceaselessly emerging blood-red runes within Zhang San. Divine light burst from his eyes, and a crack opened on his forehead, a faint golden light piercing through from within, golden runes swirling nearby.

*Is that you, Erlang Shen?* Zhou Tian almost blurted out, seeing the third eye emerging from Zhang Yi's forehead.

After observing for a moment, Zhang Yi frowned and said, "He has a divine pill inside him, containing rich life force. It's continuously releasing energy to replenish his vitality, causing the forbidden technique's power to constantly increase!"

"Combining a healing divine medicine with a forbidden technique—while devious, it exploits a loophole in the rules." Sun Dao nodded. These people from the Daluo Academy certainly had some clever tricks. However, this kind of method wasn't very useful for an individual in a competition; after all, if you couldn't win, you could surrender, there was no need to seek mutual destruction!

A look of unease also appeared on Zhang San's face. This situation was beyond his expectations. Feeling the seemingly limitless power increasing within him, he felt no joy, only apprehension. Though limited by his knowledge, he didn't understand much, but years of hardship had taught him one truth: when things are out of the ordinary, there must be something sinister at play! But his body was no longer under his control; it was operating entirely on its own!

Tian Ling's delicate brows slightly furrowed as she watched the scene unfolding before her. Which faction did this guy belong to? Why did he have so many hidden cards? And wasn't this just a competition? What was with this suicidal stance he was taking against her?

Although she didn't understand the reason, Tian Ling wouldn't let him continue empowering himself like this. His aura was already on the verge of crushing the heavens; if she didn't act now, she would have no choice but to surrender.

A pillar of azure light shot skyward, stirring the winds and clouds. Tian Ling raised her Thunder Saint Sword, energy converging, and a thousand-zhang lightning gale sword qi slashed out, tearing space apart and revealing the void.

Boom! The divine pill within Zhang San's body suddenly exploded, unleashing boundless divine radiance. Blood-red runes surged out like a sea of blood, enveloping his entire body.

Boom! Boom! A tangible, blood-red volcano appeared behind him, a hundred zhang tall, every grain of sand and stone incredibly distinct. What brewed within the blood-red volcano was not magma, but an unfathomable pool of blood.

Gurgle, gurgle! Bubbles rose from the blood pool, and a blood-red monstrous beast charged out. It had a bull's head, deer antlers, and was covered in porcupine quills, its muscles grotesque and seemingly solid.

The blood-red monstrous beast let out a thunderous roar, resisting the lightning gale sword qi.

"Half-step Law Manifestation!" Tian Ling exclaimed in shock. That volcano was clearly his Law Manifestation, painstakingly piled up using those blood-red runes, temporarily elevating him to the half-step Law Manifestation realm. But even as a half-step Law Manifestation, with the opponent wielding a Saint Tool, it was not something she could withstand.

She was about to concede...

However, Zhang San reaching the half-step Law Manifestation realm seemed to be a signal. The Saint Spear in his hand erupted with divine light, and the patterns on its shaft seemed to come alive, coiling around Zhang San's body. Fear flashed in Zhang San's eyes, for this was entirely beyond his control. At this moment, he finally realized something was amiss, but it was already too late.

Instantly, the patterns on the Saint Spear lit up. Zhang San's entire body was condensed into a ball of flesh and blood, enveloped by layers of blood-red runes, and then absorbed by the Saint Spear. The Law Manifestation behind him vanished after only a brief existence.

The Saint Spear, having absorbed all of Zhang San's essence, emitted an eerie, enchanting light, expanding ten thousand times. A majestic aura spread outwards, completely shattering the arena space and revealing the void behind it.

A terrifying aura locked onto Tian Ling, rendering her unable to move a muscle or utter a single word. This strike had completely reached the standard of a Saint!
