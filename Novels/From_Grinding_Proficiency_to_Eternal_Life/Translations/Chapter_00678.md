# Chapter 678: The Unique Characteristics of the Primordial Sect

"If... I can truly obtain the Nightfall Dao Fruit, then paying this price is worth it! Xu Yunfan... I hope you don't disappoint me. Otherwise..."

A chilling killing intent quietly spread.

The death of Qingyuan True Lord likely had something to do with her hand.

At the summit of the Divine Thunder Mountain.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged within the thunderlight, the black jade slip hovering in his palm.

On his Attribute Panel, the entries regarding Golden Core cultivation were rapidly refreshing and completing. The originally obscure path to supporting a Small World became clear, and the progress quietly jumped to [Small World Support: 42%].

"That woman Dongming truly left a hand in the crucial parts," Xu Yunfan sneered in his heart.

"If it weren't for the Attribute Panel's ability to trial and error, following the method for Nurturing the Core and Transforming the Heaven she initially gave me, I would have suffered a great loss due to Yin-Yang imbalance. If I were to recklessly devour Dao Fruits and refine Yin and Yang, my cultivation would have come to a halt. At that time, I would probably need to start cultivation all over again."

His thoughts moved, combining Dongming True Lord's insights with his own comprehension, and the speed of his Small World's evolution increased sharply.

His gaze pierced through the void, as if seeing the outline of the Aitira World across an endless distance.

"The Dark Main God's Nightfall, the Light Main God's Great Sun Light, the Nature Main God's All Things Life."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with thought. The insights given by Dongming True Lord made him feel that he might be able to walk a different path.

"Dongming wants to use Nightfall to harmonize herself, but she doesn't know that if these three Dao Fruits could all fall into my hands, using the Divine Thunder as the pivot, the Great Sun Glaze as Yang, All Things Life as Life, and Nightfall as Yin, the Four Symbols could rotate, creating endless vitality. I wonder if this could form a Small Heavenly Cycle."

But another problem arose. If the foreign Dao Fruit were refined and located within himself, it might halt his own path of cultivation.

This wouldn't do.

Xu Yunfan instantly rejected this idea.

Since he was going to Aitira, and going to the Boundary Sea with Dongming True Lord, he could pick some Life and Death Profound Light to refine into a Star Spirit Banner as his natal spiritual treasure.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Inside the Bone Jade Hall of the Mysterious Evil Mountain, the Nine Nether Evil Mist churned, but it was much thinner and more sluggish than usual.

Dongming True Lord leaned against the Mysterious Evil Throne, her rosy face showing a smile that could topple nations as she looked at Xu Yunfan, who was adjusting his clothes below.

She watched the purple-gold thunderlight flowing around Xu Yunfan become more restrained and profound than three days ago. Evidently, this Yin-Yang dual cultivation had benefited him immensely, making his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit even more stable.

Xu Yunfan smiled. "Senior Sister, your technique is truly excellent!"

"Junior Brother Xu, the time has come. Don't delay."

Dongming True Lord propped up her somewhat soft body to stand up, her demeanor slightly languid.

"The Aitira World has a雄厚 foundation. If we are late, changes may occur."

Xu Yunfan nodded, his smile sincere and brilliant. "Senior Sister is absolutely right. Junior Brother is already prepared."

His divine sense moved slightly, sensing the Divine Thunder Golden Core within his dantian, which had become even more rounded and surging after obtaining her primordial Yin. The barrier of the Small World's embryonic form had become a bit more solid.

Although this trip carried certain risks, the down payment Dongming offered was truly generous, making it worth the gamble.

Furthermore, there was Zhang Ziyang in Aitira, and he also possessed the Authority of Thunder. He could be considered to hold a 'green card,' giving him a greater advantage than Dongming True Lord.

The two said no more, their figures turning into streams of light simultaneously.

Dongming True Lord transformed into a dark, abyss-like Mysterious Evil light, cold and piercing, the space freezing wherever it passed.

Xu Yunfan became a purple-gold thunder that tore through the void, the Dao rhyme of destroying all laws surging. One after the other, the two lights instantly pierced through the Primordial Sect's protective array and entered the Boundary Sea.

The moment they entered the Boundary Sea, the violent and chaotic Chaos Life and Death Profound Light swept over them like a furious tide.

This Profound Light contained the true meaning of life and death. A Foundation Establishment cultivator would be obliterated upon contact.

Xu Yunfan was already prepared. The power of his Divine Thunder Dao Fruit circulated around his body, and the purple-gold thunderlight turned into a fine thunder net, deflecting and obliterating the incoming Profound Light.

Dongming True Lord's Nine Nether Evil Mist churned around her, like a slippery loach, weaving through the gaps in the Profound Light. However, her Nine Nether Evil Mist's insight intent was also hindered in this chaotic Boundary Sea, far from being as pervasive as it was in her own domain.

Following the coordinates provided by Xu Yunfan, the two lights sped through the bizarre and distorted Boundary Sea.

After an unknown amount of time, within the chaotic airflow ahead, the unique outline of the Aitira World, mixed with faith and natural vitality, was faintly visible.

But without precise coordinates, merely sensing it would make entry as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

Just then.

The churning airflow ahead was suddenly and forcefully split open by two overwhelming Sword Intents.

To the left, a blazing firelight shot up into the sky, illuminating a vast area of the Boundary Sea like a furnace. The heat waves distorted space and incinerated the Profound Light.

True Lord of the Scorching Sun, Li Guang Ranyan, stood with his hands behind his back, his red Daoist robe fluttering. The意 of burning the sky and boiling the sea emanating from him was the manifestation of his Scorching Sun Dao Fruit.

Although his natal flying sword, Fenji, was not unsheathed, its fierce Sword Intent was as solid as reality, locking onto Xu Yunfan.

To the right, the aura was as cold as ten thousand years of ancient ice, standing in opposition to the scorching heat.

True Lord of the Celestial Pivot, Tong Xuan, was surrounded by an invisible Sword Soul. The Sword Soul hummed, cutting through space. His Celestial Pivot Sword Soul Dao Fruit belonged to extreme Yin, yet it formed a strange balance with the extreme Yang of the Scorching Sun True Lord, jointly constructing a deadly cage.

The Scorching Sun True Lord's mouth curled up, showing a scorching smile, with magma flowing in the depths of his pupils.

"Xu Yunfan! This Lord has been waiting for you for a long time! Hiding in the Divine Thunder Mountain for thirty years, are you finally coming out to die today?"

His voice was like the grinding of metal and iron, piercing through the roar of the Boundary Sea.

Tong Xuan's face was cold and stern, his sword-like brows slightly raised. The Sword Soul around him was silent as an abyss, and he coldly uttered two words.

"Divine Thunder Dao Fruit, leave it."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed. The purple-gold thunderlight instantly surged, and his Divine Thunder Body instinctively operated to the extreme, resisting the dual lock of the Fenji Sword Intent and the invisible Sword Soul.

He instantly understood that there must be a spy within the Primordial Sect. He had been discovered the moment he left the mountain.

He didn't know what kind of strange treasure they used to intercept him here.

His gaze swept to the side.

He saw Dongming True Lord's dark light suddenly stagnate. Her face, which could topple nations, held a hint of determination.

She didn't even say a word. The Nine Nether Evil Mist around her suddenly collapsed, turning into a thin thread, almost blending into the background of the Boundary Sea. She fled frantically toward the direction of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World at a speed several times faster than when she came.

She only left a slightly steady voice ringing in Xu Yunfan's ear.

"Hold on, Junior Brother Xu. I'm going to the Primordial Sect to invite Senior Brother Pudu to help you. You must hold on!"

Xu Yunfan watched the fleeting shadow that didn't even turn its head back and almost cursed out loud.

"Dongming! You..."

He had long expected the selfishness of the Primordial Sect members, but he didn't expect this woman to turn around and flee so decisively and cleanly, without even a hint of hesitation.

What fellowship between sect brothers, what mutual support—all were illusions in the face of life and death.

"Hahaha!"

The Scorching Sun True Lord saw this and let out a sneer that shook the Boundary Sea's Profound Light.

"Members of the Demon Sect are indeed selfish and treacherous, breaking faith and abandoning righteousness. Xu Yunfan, you expected this woman to live and die with you? A pipe dream!"
