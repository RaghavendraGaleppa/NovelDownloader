# Chapter 82: The Vajra Guardian

Li Shiming observed the machine room space, where he no longer needed to deal with the exhaust and pollution from diesel generators. Although the perpetual motion generator appeared eerie and ghostly, it had the advantage of being clean and maintenance-free.

The two 'Five Ghost Soul Refining Banners' were placed beside the perpetual motion generator. With three ghostly shadows taking turns, there was still one left as backup, perfectly solving the power supply issue.

Having resolved the electricity problem, the excess diesel could be cleared from the machine room, freeing up considerable space.

His attention returned to the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art*, a technique with significant risks.

Buddhist cultivation methods were notoriously difficult to master initially. Once begun, they required only diligent practice, but each breakthrough demanded mental fortitude and insights drawn from Buddhist teachings.

Senior Brother Zhuji had mentioned that only by practicing body-refining techniques could the intervals between main cultivation sessions be reduced. Thus, body-refining techniques were essential.

As the foundational knowledge of the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art* flowed through his mind, Li Shiming took a deep breath, his eyes flashing with determination.

To embark on the path of immortal cultivation without the courage to practice body-refining techniques—what kind of immortality could one hope to achieve? What hope for longevity?

Of course, he didn't intend to proceed recklessly. Drawing from his previous success with Buddhist chants, he planned to use this method to bypass the need for deep study of Buddhist doctrines.

It wasn't that he couldn't learn Buddhist teachings—it was that they were too effective at reshaping one's mind. He had no intention of becoming a monk.

For him, Buddhist teachings were merely tools to be used when necessary.

From the Buddhist scriptures, he selected a suitable passage: *The Diamond Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom That Cuts Like a Thunderbolt*, commonly known as *The Diamond Sutra*.

Whether in name or in its calming and focusing effects, *The Diamond Sutra* perfectly complemented the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art*.

Moreover, he chose to play a recording from the IBMz15—a rendition of *The Diamond Sutra* chanted by a renowned Buddhist master from his previous life.

While there had been no immortal cultivation in his past life, in terms of Buddhist teachings alone, this master likely rivaled any in this world.

After all, the Buddhist chants stored in the IBMz15 were of legendary status, proven by research to have profound effects on the mind.

Li Shiming stood in the center of the room. As he activated the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art*, his emotions were intensely affected.

His vision filled with scenes of human suffering—war, slaughter, famine, and desperate acts of survival. A righteous fury arose within him.

This was the wrath of the masses, like the wrath of a Vajra guardian, a fire seeking to burn away all injustice in the world.

His eyes turned bloodshot, his muscles swelled to their limits, and veins bulged across his body.

His heartbeat accelerated to its physiological maximum, his body teetering on the brink of explosion.

At this critical moment, *The Diamond Sutra* began to play—triggered by the IBMz15's assessment of his condition.

Though the fury remained, the chanting allowed Li Shiming to detach, observing his body's changes as if from outside.

A realization dawned: his choice had been correct. *The Diamond Sutra* and the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art* were a perfect match.

His enraged body converted the spiritual energy from the vortex into the unique Vajra force of the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art*. With the first surge of Vajra force, his fury intensified further.

Had it not been for *The Diamond Sutra* and the IBMz15's direct projection of the master's chant into his senses, he would have lost control.

Losing control while channeling spiritual energy meant true qi deviation.

In Buddhist cultivation, qi deviation manifested as inner demons—once they took root, they were nearly impossible to eradicate.

The fury persisted, pushing his body beyond its limits. With each infusion of Vajra force, his physique strengthened.

Each increase in strength allowed his body to endure greater fury, maintaining him at the razor's edge of danger.

The first session of the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art* required circulating Vajra force through his entire body—laying the foundation and facing the greatest challenge.

Later, he could choose to strengthen his entire body at once or focus on specific areas.

His prolonged state of fury caused blood to seep from his eyes and pores.

His muscles trembled, his bones ached.

He wondered if his body would collapse.

Like fuel to a fire, the Vajra force poured continuously into his burning body.

The torment was unbearable—physically and mentally. Thanks to *The Diamond Sutra*, his mind held firm.

Though at the third level of Qi Refinement, his body was among the weakest, untrained and unprepared for such strain.

He endured solely through sheer willpower.

---

Time lost meaning. Each second felt like an eternity in hell. Even his connection to the IBMz15 couldn't anchor his sense of time.

Finally, his body gave out, and he collapsed, the floor slick with his sweat and blood.

"HAHAHAHA!" He laughed wildly. He had conquered himself. The Vajra force had circulated fully—the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art* was now his.

Exhausted, his body recovered at an astonishing rate.

After the time it took to drink tea, he had regained most of his strength.

Rising, he used the cleansing spell on his robe to tidy himself and the floor before inspecting his body.

Even at this initial stage, a faint layer of Vajra force coated his skin.

This energy would grow with practice, continuously enhancing his physique.

Currently in the Qingqiu Pavilion and still in his probationary period, Li Shiming couldn't purchase the elixirs needed for body refinement. For now, he would have to make do.

Without elixirs, his body required at least three days to recover between sessions.

According to the manual, practicing the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art* before full recovery drastically increased the risk of qi deviation and cumulative bodily damage.

Li Shiming realized he was caught in a paradox.

To accelerate his *Five Elements Absorption Art*, he needed the *Vajra Guardian Divine Art*. To speed up the latter, he required elixirs—which he had yet to acquire. And who knew what he'd have to do to obtain them!
