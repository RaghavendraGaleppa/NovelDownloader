Chapter 85: Almost Ascended on the Spot

The Purple Lightning Beast's body trembled slightly, a tremor of pure rage. It felt utterly humiliated, encountering the same human and being ridden twice!

"Don't be nervous, don't be afraid. I once met another Purple Lightning Beast, it was much braver than you, untamed and defiant, baring its teeth and wagging its tail at me," Qin Ming soothed it.

However, he noticed that this temporarily conscripted mount was trembling even more violently. Was it really that timid?

The Purple Lightning Beast's fur bristled with anger; it felt like it was about to explode on the spot! It was good that this enemy hadn't recognized it, but to then "behind its back" humiliate its past self? "Wagging its tail, baring its teeth"—what kind of wild nonsense was that? How could a creature of its noble status do anything so outrageous? The Purple Lightning Beast wanted to scream, "This princess is going to die of anger!"

"Hurry, chase that person!" Qin Ming urged, telling it that it would stop being nervous once it started running.

The Purple Lightning Beast wasn't just about to explode; it was so enraged it was on the verge of ascending on the spot.

If it weren't for the clear understanding that this person wielded the Sticking Force, adhering to it like a plaster and impossible to dislodge, it would have long since thrown him off and kicked him until his face burst.

It was enduring, slowly taking small, brisk steps, trotting forward.

The Purple Lightning Beast knew this person was a pervert; he had single-handedly annihilated Golden Rooster Ridge. It was quietly waiting for an opportunity. After all, it had undergone four rebirths now, no longer its former self!

It carefully assessed their respective strengths. As long as the other party was off its back, it should be able to kick this person into oblivion.

"Stop, something's not right." Qin Ming patted its spine.

The Purple Lightning Beast felt goosebumps rise, cursing silently, *This person is so troublesome, first telling me to chase someone, then stopping again.*

Qin Ming's expression turned serious. He quieted his mind, focusing his senses, allowing his instinctive perception to spread. In this sparsely treed lake area, he easily observed the abnormal "situation" lurking in the shadows.

He spotted an Azure Bird motionless, almost blending into a tree branch in the night, clearly observing him. Qin Ming instantly flared with anger. *Which major power sent this one now?*

*Did I not escape their eyes even after changing my appearance and becoming a fat man?*

Qin Ming remained outwardly calm, quietly observing. He then noticed a Myna, not only spying on him but also seemingly incredibly nervous.

He had only entered the mountains, and already someone had sent cunning birds to tail him.

Qin Ming no longer had the inclination to chase the gray-clothed man. The hidden danger before him demanded more attention. This time, although he hadn't brought the conspicuous, heavy bow he'd seized from Zhao Jingshuo, he still carried the bow and arrows he'd bought previously.

Undoubtedly, both birds had become spirits, highly vigilant. The moment they saw Qin Ming taking off his bow and arrows, they fluttered their wings and took flight.

Unfortunately, they had encountered Qin Ming, who was a master of the blade, spear, hammer, and arrow, all rolled into one. His archery at this range was virtually infallible!

"Ah, spare me, don't kill me!" The Azure Bird, being the most slippery of its kind, also meant it was spineless. With an arrow in its wing, it fell to the ground and immediately began begging for mercy.

The Myna had a resilient character; it didn't utter a sound even with arrows in both wings, plummeting to the lakeside.

The Purple Lightning Beast inwardly cried, *This is over! Even the scouts have been shot down.* Since its last mishap, even when bathing, it had two little followers standing guard. Yet, these two idiots hadn't served their purpose and were captured in pairs.

The two birds felt very wronged. Who could have imagined that person's speed was so fast? Even the incredibly sensitive Purple Lightning Beast hadn't reacted in time, so they naturally hadn't noticed either. Moreover, seeing that Princess had not resisted, the two birds were a bit bewildered and wanted to observe first whether they needed to report.

"You, remove the iron arrow from your wing yourself, then fly over here," Qin Ming called out.

The Azure Bird felt like it was going numb. *What kind of ruthless person have I met? This is too difficult for a bird!*

The Azure Bird, palm-sized and pale blue all over with eyes like black gemstones, looked like a very cunning, thieving bird. It endured the severe pain, flapping its wings, and managed to free itself from the iron arrow.

"Go, help that Myna," Qin Ming commanded.

The black bird, struck by two arrows, wanted to roll its eyes. *Who's a Myna?!*

"Sir, that's a Myna, just an unusually large one. Crows have black beaks, which is why people often curse them as 'black-mouthed.' Mynas have yellow beaks, well, this one's is golden," the Azure Bird said smoothly while using its beak to help the Myna pull out the arrow.

Qin Ming, unable to distinguish them, felt a bit embarrassed. He said, "Who asked you to explain? Chatterbox!"

The shimmering blue Azure Bird immediately shut up. This flattery had completely backfired!

"Both of you, come over here," Qin Ming threatened, holding his bow and arrow.

In the end, the two birds fluttered their wings, wobbling, and landed on Qin Ming's shoulders. They felt as if their entire bird bodies were glued, completely unable to struggle. It was an extremely peculiar Skyglow Force.

In an instant, the Purple Lightning Beast's two sentries had a thought: *Could this be the person who previously enraged the Princess, making her gnash her teeth, that "plaster-like" man?*

*This... we've encountered him again?* Both birds found it utterly unbelievable, ridiculous. *How unlucky must our master be? She's probably going to die of anger!*

The Purple Lightning Beast and the two birds cursed, their moods terribly foul.

Qin Ming was equally glum. His journey had been filled with various setbacks, and the pressure was immense. He sighed lightly, "My enemies' desire to destroy me is relentless."

Then, he glared fiercely at the two birds and demanded, "Speak, who sent you, and how long have you been secretly following me?"

*What's going on?* The two birds were dumbfounded, confused, and a little bewildered.

"Look at your innocent little eyes, still pretending to be stupid? Speak quickly, or I'll slap you both into meat patties!" Qin Ming said.

Then, he slapped the Purple Lightning Beast's back. *Slap!* The sound was crisp.

The effect was very clear: the two birds trembled with fright, because their own master had been hit!

The Purple Lightning Beast exhaled clouds of mist, its fur flowing with purple light. It was truly reaching its limit of endurance, so utterly provoked. When had it ever suffered such a loss?

But at the last moment, it horrifyingly realized that this person's naturally exposed Skyglow Force was now much stronger than last time. Had he... broken through too?

Its desire to fight him to the death instantly faded. For now... it endured!

"Myna, starting with you, dare to get one word wrong, and I'll pluck a hundred of your feathers immediately!" Qin Ming threatened. He thought the Azure Bird was too cunning, so he started with the dark, plain one.

"Sir, I promise not to lie, but I can't be sure if the meaning of every word is precise. After all, I'm not human, and I don't have such high talent in language. Also... I'm a Myna." Its voice grew smaller towards the end, seeing the human glaring at it.

"Do you want me to call you 'bro' now? You're a Myna now, don't give me any useless talk."

"Alright, I'm a Myna, but this can't be counted as me lying." The Myna was very particular and meticulous.

It then swore that it genuinely wasn't monitoring Qin Ming, had never seen him before, and had no previous contact with him.

"Sir, how could we provoke you without reason? We belong to the great mountain..." The Azure Bird also swore that it had never seen Qin Ming before. If it was lying, may its entire clan be exterminated.

Qin Ming glanced at it. *This cunning bird makes such harsh vows?*

He thought back. He shouldn't have been followed along the way.

"Then what are you doing here?" Qin Ming asked sternly.

The Azure Bird replied, "Sir, have you heard of the Black Market in the Night Mist? It appears once a month in the mountains. We wanted to follow behind the noble Purple Lightning Beast Sir/Madam, to see if we could sneak in."

Qin Ming's heart stirred. He had heard Xu Sheng mention it before—a special place where humans and various creatures traded, requiring an invitation from an acquaintance to enter, held once a month.

It was said that the Black Market in the Night Mist also had levels; the higher the level, the deeper into the mountains one had to venture. Although there were no Mountain Lords here, many dangerous creatures still dwelled in the innermost parts of the mountain range.

"What level of night market is this?" Qin Ming asked, somewhat intrigued. If all the beings there were in the mutated stage, he truly had nothing to fear. Creatures, like humans, rarely underwent nine transformations; it was an anomaly, almost impossible to encounter.

Qin Ming had already tested the power of his fully integrated Skyglow Force against Ge Qianxun, who had undergone seven rebirths. He felt confident enough to visit the Black Market in the Night Mist.

He genuinely wasn't afraid of being targeted by monsters. If any spiritual beings in the mutated stage followed him, perhaps they could provide him with what he currently needed.

"Can I get in with you?" Qin Ming asked the Purple Lightning Beast beneath him.

The Purple Lightning Beast shattered the rocks on the ground with its hoof. *If I carry this plaster-like scoundrel in, will I still have any reputation left? I'll never be able to hold my head high in this life.*

The Azure Bird said, "Sir, you definitely can't go in like that. If other creatures see you riding on such a noble Purple Lightning Beast, someone, human or creature, will definitely secretly target you. It's too eye-catching, like a crane among chickens, a tree that stands out in the forest will be destroyed by the wind."

Qin Ming was amenable to good advice and jumped down, agreeing that the Azure Bird's words made sense. But his hand didn't leave the Purple Lightning Beast, the Sticking Force ready to activate at any moment.

He began, "Purple Bro, or Purple Sis? You won't hold a grudge against me for riding on you like this, will you? It shouldn't be that bad. I think your temper is quite good, a hundred times better than that irritable Purple Lightning Beast from before. I just want to see the world; can I accompany you?"

Mainly, Qin Ming now had confidence; his own strength was sufficient to protect himself in such a place, and his appearance had changed, so he wasn't afraid of causing trouble.

"This isn't your lair up ahead, is it? Let me say this first: if anything happens to me, you three will definitely explode before I do." Qin Ming finished, and the fully integrated Skyglow Force flowed with dazzling brilliance from his right hand. With a gentle flick, a large boulder on the road silently crumbled into dust.

No sound was even more terrifying than exploding directly.

The Purple Lightning Beast's body tensed. It felt that this scoundrel was terrifyingly stronger than last time. But after removing his mask and armor, why was he so fat? It silently cursed: *Damn fatso!*

"Purple Bro, Purple Sis, the two birds say you're noble. Where do you live, which mountain range do you inhabit?" Qin Ming tried to lighten the mood.

The Purple Lightning Beast thought, *If I say "Blessed Land," it'll surely scare you to death, but it might also kill me to silence me.*

"Earlier, you said Purple Bro or Purple Sis is noble. In what way?" Qin Ming asked the two birds that could speak.

"Born with divine markings," the Azure Bird wanted to praise more but didn't dare reveal too much, only using four words to answer.

"Hmm, let me see. It seems there are some subtle, mysterious patterns on your neck. No, wait, are you wearing fake mane fur? No way, you even fake your fur? Are you going bald?" Qin Ming exclaimed in surprise. There seemed to be an extra layer of skin beneath the Purple Lightning Beast's neck.

"You're the one going bald! That's this princess's clothes!" The Purple Lightning Beast cursed silently, almost speaking human words and swearing loudly.

"That's for being low-key. A body full of divine markings is too dazzling," the Azure Bird explained.

This time, the Black Market in the Night Mist was in a valley. The fog was extremely dense, guarded at the entrance by a Mountain Monster that had undergone six transformations.

Before approaching, Qin Ming warned, "All three of you, make sure your expressions are normal later. Anyone who shows the slightest abnormality that makes me suspicious, I guarantee I'll make you explode on the spot. It's best if you all smile."

He guessed that he might encounter the Purple Lightning Beast's acquaintances from the mountains. However, he wasn't concerned. Perhaps he could gain spiritual substances for his fifth rebirth from this.

The valley was quite lively, with all sorts of creatures: masked humans, stumbling single-horned giant bears, silver-bodied raptors, and many nameless creatures.

Qin Ming had only walked around for a bit before he felt uneasy. The Purple Lightning Beast was attracting a lot of attention, with many creatures of considerable background watching them.

"This is going to go wrong!" He realized he had severely underestimated the Purple Lightning Beast's identity earlier.

"Hm, no fear. The current monsters can all be dealt with. Quickly check if there are any rare items. If not, we'll run immediately," Qin Ming quickly assessed.

Soon, he was startled because his Skyglow Force reacted, resonating particularly with a yellowish stone on a certain stall, seemingly wanting to... swallow it.

*What's going on? He had never experienced this before.*

Then, he noticed something: when he went to touch the palm-sized stone, his Yellow Clay Palm technique seemed to want to unleash its power.

"How much for this stone?" Qin Ming asked.

"It's worthless, just for weighing down the stall cloth. If you like it, it's yours," the humanoid Mountain Monster said. It was covered in green beast fur, and when it grinned, its green face and tusks were quite frightening.

It spoke courteously to Qin Ming, but its eyes were eager, fixed on the Purple Lightning Beast. Qin Ming guessed it didn't know what the stone truly was, and it was mainly being generous to curry favor with the Purple Lightning Beast.

"Here's one Day Gold," Qin Ming immediately pocketed the stone. At the same time, he wanted to leave; this Purple Lightning Beast beside him felt very wrong.

"Hmm, how much is this book?" He hadn't left yet when he saw an ancient book on an adjacent stall that resonated with him spiritually. He immediately stopped.

"Ten Day Gold, it's not considered a high-grade cultivation technique," this Mountain Monster was also very enthusiastic.

The Purple Lightning Beast was furious, cursing inwardly, *You think this is a friend accompanying me? You're giving things away at a loss! I've been kidnapped by him!* It found Qin Ming taking advantage of its presence to snatch bargains, feeling both angry and resentful, but it dared not show it, fearing that terrifying hand next to it would send it away. The most important thing was that there were no high-level creatures here.
