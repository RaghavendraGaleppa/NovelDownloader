Chapter 89: The Third Layer of "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh"

"Dual cultivation?"

The air became subtle for a moment after the words fell.

Creak, creak...

What sound was that?

Li Mo was taken aback, lowering his head to see that the ice cube, Ying Bing, was gripping the Tian Shuang sword so tightly that it was creaking.

Emmmm.

If it weren't for the fact that he was the one who said it, the sword would probably have already come down.

Raising his head again, he met Ying Bing's scrutinizing gaze.

Li Mo: "!"

Was he going to be rejected?

It was all because of those rogue cultivators in the martial world who kept talking about the heretical techniques of "gathering yin to nourish yang" and calling it "dual cultivation," making it easy to be misunderstood.

"Our two sword techniques are practiced together, isn't that also a form of dual cultivation?" Li Mo said.

"This is a proper martial art," Li Mo added.

"What do you mean by proper or improper?" Ying Bing tilted her head in confusion.

She was actually thinking about which传承 (legacy or inheritance) Li Mo had obtained, that he even had martial arts related to dual cultivation.

After a moment, Ying Bing said, "This kind of martial art requires extremely high demands on both parties. It's not certain that it can be practiced. Bring it out and let me take a look."

"Alright," Li Mo nodded and took out a few pages of light golden paper from his bosom.

Ying Bing sat down at the stone table, placed Tian Shuang across her knees, and began to read, her expression gradually becoming surprised.

"Is it an upper-grade exquisite skill?"

"Yeah, I found it by chance," Li Mo replied.

"Come to your room tonight," Ying Bing said.

"Huh?" Li Mo was taken aback.

"Didn't you want to practice dual cultivation?" Ying Bing asked.

"......"

The ice cube agreed with unexpected swiftness.

Li Mo couldn't help but think that she was indeed straightforward and decisive.

Was dual cultivation... also a form of investment?

After leaving the martial arts manual, Li Mo saw Shang Wu leaning against the back door, beckoning to him.

The message was: "Come out and get beaten."

Li Mo sighed and went out through the back door.

Only after he left did Ying Bing's hand, which was holding the paper, slowly clench.

She wasn't an inexperienced little girl.

This was indeed a proper dual cultivation martial art.

But even if it was proper, it was usually practiced between partners.

The Gui Palace strictly forbade disciples from falling in love.

In her previous life, many disciples had been caught by her for secretly practicing similar martial arts.

But now, she...

The strange feeling in her heart made her want to curl up her fingers.

However, if it weren't for this excuse, she wouldn't know how to fulfill the punishment criteria.

After all, Li Mo wouldn't get drunk and walk into the wrong room every day...

It was okay.

This was to get back to the top as soon as possible...

And also to repay him...

Yes, that's it, nothing else...

Moreover, she could figure out what kind of constitution Li Mo had, which had given rise to such strange internal energy.

Thinking this way, Ying Bing seriously lowered her head to continue reading.

Outside the courtyard.

The fiery color again enveloped the empty space.

Li Mo still felt uncomfortable staying in the domain, but he didn't try to use his internal energy to burn it again, as staying here could temper his internal energy.

Moreover, if his master just paid a bit more attention and filled in the loopholes in time, his last trick wouldn't have worked.

Looking up, he saw Shang Wu sitting on the wall with her legs crossed.

"Today is still about teaching you how to fight," Shang Wu said.

"But today's stuff is the real deal."

"Come on, attack," she beckoned.

Li Mo saw a hint of seriousness on his master's usually lazy face.

He also couldn't help but focus.

Yeah, starting with Wind Shadow Step.

Then using Star Meteor Hammer.

Then being flicked away by his master's finger.

As soon as the thought fell, his body moved.

...

However, just as he thought everything was developing as expected.

He saw those fiery eyes.

Li Mo felt a sudden suffocation in his chest, as if struck by lightning, like a mountain crushing him, and he was just a withered grass being crushed.

His vision directly plunged into darkness.

He died.

No, not really dead.

Just a real experience of death.

That terrifying aura still lingered in his consciousness after he woke up.

"You woke up faster than I expected," Shang Wu said, still sitting on the wall, her crossed legs swaying leisurely.

"Just now..."

"The intent of the sword is there, and the hammer isn't just for smashing people," Shang Wu explained.

Shang Wu jumped down.

"Is it about the sharpness of the weapon?" Li Mo probed.

"Not entirely," Shang Wu's fiery eyes faded.

"You now have a treasure mountain without realizing it."

"Same old rule, we'll talk while fighting."

"...."

Li Mo fell silent.

He couldn't hang up on this, could he?

...

At night.

Another day of fighting training ended.

"Finally understand why Master had no disciples before," Li Mo thought.

"If it were someone else, they'd be pushing up daisies by next year."

Li Mo, not wanting to move a finger, sank his mind into his dantian.

It had to be said, if he could withstand Shang Wu's training method, the effect was quite remarkable.

His internal energy grew a bit more.

And that wasn't the key.

If he were to fight against his past self, with similar internal energy, he was confident he could take him down within ten moves.

His realm and fighting level were improving at an incredible speed.

Give him another month or so, and he might be able to achieve a perfect condensation of energy?

Dragging his tired body into the courtyard, Li Mo saw that the "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh" he had given to the ice cube was lying quietly on the stone table.

Obviously, the ice cube had looked at it and then just thrown it there.

"Speaking of which, I haven't looked at it myself," Li Mo thought, heating up his meal and eating while reading.

This martial art was divided into four layers.

The first layer was about the fusion of energy.

The second layer was about the fusion of spirit.

The third layer... was about the unity of spirit and flesh.

"Does this unity of spirit and flesh mean...?"

Li Mo was silent for a moment.

[Ten years of martial arts comprehension injected successfully]

[First year...]

...

It didn't take long for the deduction to complete.

Yeah, it was strange, but he grasped this thing quite quickly.

Li Mo opened his mouth, forgetting to swallow his food.

This martial art could be practiced by the same sex, but it would never reach the third layer.

Because it required both parties to know each other intimately.

Only then could their essence, energy, and spirit achieve a temporary perfect fusion.

Tsk...

It wasn't entirely impossible for the same sex... but that wasn't the point!

Had the ice cube not realized this layer?

"Li Mo," a familiar voice came from upstairs.

Ying Bing was standing by the window.

"Come up," she said.

"Alright," Li Mo replied, feeling a bit apprehensive.

Creak...

Pushing open the door, he was met with Ying Bing's serene gaze.

Li Mo felt a bit uneasy under her stare.

"How much of that dual cultivation martial art have you learned?"

"I've just mastered the first layer, and I was planning to..."

"It's good, the first layer is enough, it's sufficient," Ying Bing interrupted.

Li Mo felt a bit relieved.

At this moment, the familiar coldness began to emanate from Ying Bing.

In the darkness.

The girl patted the bedside, her voice cold.

"Take off your clothes and come over."
