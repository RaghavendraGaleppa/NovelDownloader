# Chapter 46: Li Mo's Modest Wealth and the Ice Cube's Doubts

As soon as Elder Han He finished speaking, Shang Wu almost immediately retorted with an unfriendly expression.

"Leave him with you? Old man, are you trying to steal my disciple?"

"Who would want your disciple! This Old Master is keeping the Ancestral Divine Weapon!"

Elder Han He was unusually tough.

Even if this matter were to be brought before the Sect Master, he was in the right.

Moreover...

Shang Wu's concerns were not entirely unfounded.

Having the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer acknowledge him as its master, if he were a disciple of the Divine Weapon Peak, he would be the undisputed next Peak Master.

"Does Elder Han He want to keep me here to forge weapons?"

Li Mo vaguely sensed the underlying intention.

That wouldn't do.

If he stayed here every day, how could he... well, how could he rely on the Ice Cube for support?

"Let Li Mo stay here, and I, the Divine Weapon Peak, will cover all your future expenses."

The next moment.

Elder Han He's deep and somber voice carried a strong allure.

He was clearly prepared to pay a heavy price.

"Elder, what are you saying? My Master is unyielding and proud; she wouldn't abandon her disciple for a little money, right?"

"Right, Master... Master?"

Li Mo spoke righteously.

He turned around and saw that his Master had lost her previous imposing aura. Her beautiful eyes were a bit glazed over, as if she were calculating the carefree life of having an unlimited supply of fine wine and delicious food.

He strongly suspected that she could already hear the clinking of silver coins right now.

Little Li: "....."

It seemed he had still underestimated his Master's poverty and her love for money...

Li Mo lowered his voice and said, "Master, when has the Autumn Water Pavilion ever lacked fine wine and food for you? If I stay at the Divine Weapon Peak, who will cook for you in the future?"

The Divine Weapon Peak's weapons had a wide market and indeed made a fortune every day.

But it probably still couldn't compare to his ability to 'create something from nothing.'

Moreover, he would never be afraid of anyone eating him into poverty; instead, he would become richer due to the returns on his investments.

"Hmph, I'm not that kind of person."

The beautiful Master's eyes instantly cleared, and she nodded seriously.

"Elder, you overthink things. This disciple has a modest amount of wealth."

Li Mo cupped his fists toward Elder Han He.

"How much could you possibly have..."

*Clang—*

Two large chunks of metal, gleaming with a cold light, crashed onto the ground.

Instantly, the temperature in the room dropped slightly, as if these two pieces of metal were absorbing heat.

Elder Han He's smiling expression froze, replaced by deep thought.

Iron Essence.

Ten thousand catties of iron yield one tael of essence.

A hint of it added to an ordinary blade could make it sharp enough to cut through hair and iron as if it were mud.

These two large chunks of Iron Essence—even with the help of the Cold Flame Spring Water, even if all the disciples' hammers were worn down to smoke, it would be hard to produce this much in three years.

*Clang—*

Another dull sound.

A fist-sized, crimson metal also fell to the ground.

"Hiss..."

Elder Han He completely lost his composure.

Flaming Rock Copper Ore.

It could only be born near a volcano, where the ore is tempered by earthfire for over ten thousand years, and then only possibly obtained after a volcanic eruption.

This material was used in the Red Sky Sword.

And you call this... a 'modest amount of wealth'?

Elder Han began to ponder the origin of the legacy Li Mo had obtained.

Shang Wu was also thinking about this problem.

The powerful being who left behind this legacy—was he perhaps a merchant in his past life?

Or perhaps a great bandit who plundered countless fortunes?

"This disciple is not a blacksmith. These two rare treasures are like pearls cast before swine."

"Only you, Elder, who is a renowned master craftsman in Ziyang Prefecture, can make the best use of them."

Little Li knew how to flatter the old man.

Elder Han He fell silent.

After a long while, he sighed.

"Shang Wu, your disciple is better at dealing with people than you are. This Old Master is no longer worried about him causing endless trouble with the divine weapon."

Shang Wu: "?"

Han He didn't look at her. He turned back and said in a deep voice.

"Li Mo, if you can do three things for me, I will help you achieve your wish."

"Elder, please speak."

Li Mo followed his lead.

---

"First, if the Divine Weapon Peak one day forges a Profound Artifact and needs to use the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer, as the Master of the Weapon, you must help."

"Second, before your strength is sufficient, do not publicize the matter of the divine weapon. Besides me and your Master, no one else should know."

"Third, do not let the Ancestral Divine Weapon be stained with the blood of the unjust."

On the last point, Elder Han He加重了他的语气 (emphasized his tone).

"As it should be."

Little Li did not hesitate.

These conditions were far more lenient than he had expected.

Even if Elder Han He hadn't mentioned it, he would have done the same.

"Good, you may go."

Elder Han He waved his hand wearily.

"The old man is so agreeable today." Shang Wu挑了挑眉 (raised an eyebrow), feeling somewhat unaccustomed to it.

Li Mo bowed to Elder Han He and pulled his Master as they walked out.

They had gained an advantage; there was no need to be greedy.

Watching the master and disciple leave.

"The divine weapon finally has a master, and it has ultimately fallen to the Jade Peak."

"Shang Wu didn't get it, but her disciple did..."

"The ways of the world are truly marvelous and unpredictable..."

Elder Han He muttered to himself with emotion.

...

On the path down the mountain.

"My precious disciple, you're quite clever."

Shang Wu narrowed her almond-shaped eyes, put one hand on her hip, and draped her other slender arm over her disciple's shoulder, laughing without any sense of decorum.

"Not bad, not bad. To be able to talk Elder Han He into a daze already shows six or seven-tenths of my skill."

"It can't really be called talking him into a daze..."

Little Li coughed lightly as his Master, who was about the same height as him, put her arm around his shoulder.

"Hmph, are you trying to fool your Master too?"

"Where's the hammer? Let me see."

Shang Wu had a 'I understand everything' expression on her face.

Li Mo said with a bitter smile, "I really can't take it out."

You must be kidding.

It took a tremendous effort to put it inside.

He still hadn't fully recovered yet. To manifest it again?

Master, do you believe I would fall apart on the spot?

"Hmph, you ungrateful brat."

Shang Wu sniffed and put on a sulky face.

Li Mo: "...... Master, did you really want to sell me off just now?"

"Hehe... hehe, how could that be?"

Shang Wu's gaze drifted elsewhere.

"That was just a test from your Master, to see if you were truly loyal to the Jade Peak."

"Master, your conscience is pricking you."

"Bold rebellious disciple, how dare you question your Master! Are you trying to rebel?!"

The Master's pace明显加快 (visibly quickened), her fiery red palace dress fluttering.

Li Mo sighed softly. "Master, how about some aged Bamboo Green Wine with roasted whole lamb tonight?"

Little Li unleashed his control skill.

"How many years aged?"

"Thirty years."

The control skill was highly effective.

...

A moment later.

The master and disciple returned under the starlight, heavily laden.

As soon as they pushed the door open, Li Mo saw the少女's (young girl's) figure sitting at the stone table where they usually ate, slowly sipping tea. A long sword lay across her lap, reflecting the moonlight.

"I thought you had gone back to your room to practice."

"I haven't eaten dinner yet."

The Ice Cube said this.

Little Li fell silent for a moment and looked up at the sky.

The moon was dim, indicating that the night was almost over.

"But... it's almost time for breakfast."

"Is it?"

Ying Bing also looked up at the moon, her slender brows疑惑的蹙起 (puzzledly furrowed).

What kind of sense of time is this?

Who uses mealtimes to judge the time!

Unable to吐槽 (retort), Li Mo went to cook.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes for a moment, looked at Shang Wu, and asked softly.

"What happened at the Divine Blade Cave today?"

This was yet another thing that had exceeded her expectations.
