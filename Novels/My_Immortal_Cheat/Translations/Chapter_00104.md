# Chapter 104: The Beginning

Although Zhou Tian instructed Anduin to save as many people from the Nine Provinces as possible, in addition to Zhang Yi and Mu Su who were absolute priorities, Anduin clearly had no desire to burden himself with too many.

Stepping over the molten metallic liquid that had once been energy constructs, the being that Anduin had transformed into gripped the Ashfall Spear tightly. Flames swirled in his crimson eyes as he stared intently at the void before him, as if searching for something, the aura emanating from his body scorching and twisting the surrounding void.

Suddenly, the Ashfall Spear thrust forward, half its shaft plunging into the void. Clang! Chains rattled in the void as white divine chains of order materialized from thin air, ensnaring the Ashfall Spear and Anduin.

This Tribunal was built by the Ancient Sacred God Sect, naturally containing spatial seals. Breaking through here would not be simple.

“Hmph!”

The patterns across Anduin's body lit up, and vast energy coursed through him. Crimson flames attached themselves to the white chains, making them tremble uncontrollably. But the same problem persisted: this Tribunal had not been maintained for a very long time; the current Sacred God Sect simply lacked the technical support to repair it.

The chains shattered. Engulfed in a storm of flames, Anduin violently twisted the Ashfall Spear, its shaft still half-submerged in the void.

*Rip!*

A crimson vortex formed in the void. Anduin recalled his spear and again said in a low voice, "Follow me!"

With that, he stepped into the vortex first. Zhang Yi looked back at the other people from the Nine Provinces still in their cages, seeing hatred, yearning, and indifference in their eyes. He shook his head, then turned and stepped into the vortex with Mu Su.

The crimson vortex slowly spun, and all the remaining beings in the cages watched with longing faces, yet it remained tantalizingly out of reach.

Suddenly, two crimson chains shot out from the crimson vortex, carrying immense power. They smashed the railings of one cage to smithereens and swept the person inside out.

That person's face changed drastically. Although he wanted to leave, he absolutely did not want to leave in such a manner. Energy surged around his body, and runes spilled forth, but he was ultimately dragged into the crimson vortex. Only then did the vortex slowly close.

If Zhang Yi had been there, he would have recognized the person just swept away as one of the captured people from the Nine Provinces, though not from a major power, but a lone cultivator.

When Zhang Yi and Mu Su stepped out of the crimson vortex, they were already in front of the Central Grand Cathedral. Anduin floated in the void, gripping the Ashfall Spear. His wings gently flapped, spewing crimson flames, and the twin horns on his head emitted a faint purple glow, making him look like a great demon.

Opposite him stood the Pontiff of the Sacred God Sect, holding a scepter, his white robe immaculate, his bare feet treading the void. His face bore an indifferent expression, as if he paid no mind to Anduin.

Countless silver-armored guards surrounded them in layers. Bor was among them, along with several knights whose powerful auras radiated intense hatred as they stared at Anduin floating in the void.

“My Sacred God Sect is not a place you can simply leave whenever you please,” the Pontiff said calmly, and immediately, holy hymns resonated in the void, enveloping him in a sacred aura.

“It seems your Sacred God Sect truly has no one left if even the Pontiff has to personally deal with a small fry like me,” Anduin laughed heartily, molten rock dripping from his wide mouth, corroding large holes in the ground.

Though he appeared unconcerned, he actually felt a little troubled. He had intended to open a spatial passage directly outside Celer City, but he hadn't expected the Pontiff to react so quickly and intercept him. Now he had no choice but to confront them here.

“You are no match for my sect. Surrender obediently, and you might suffer less,” the Pontiff said, his eyes unwavering.

“Surrender? So you can find a way to extract my divinity and ascend to godhood yourself? I never would have thought the Pontiff of the Sacred God Sect, instead of serving the Holy Lord, would be scheming to become a god himself!” Anduin roared, releasing a huge piece of information. His voice was so loud it made the void tremble, audible throughout Celer City. He wanted to create some chaos for the other side.

However, to his disappointment, none of the Sacred God Sect's people showed any signs of shock; they simply didn't believe a word he said. On his side, one young junior seemed somewhat incredulous, but it was utterly useless. Fortunately, he had achieved his goal of buying time.

From afar, a loud shout echoed: “Divine Son, we are here!”

South of Celer City, towering flames surged, as if igniting the entire sky.

The Pontiff’s face remained unfazed. “It’s good that you’ve all come. We can just catch all of you in one go,” he said with absolute confidence in his tone.

“Then come on!” Anduin roared, shaking his wings, conjuring an endless storm of crimson flames. The Ashfall Spear glowed brilliantly, its crimson tip emitting a divine radiance that tore through space.

This weapon was born for slaughter, once the weapon of a Divine Lord in ancient times, having been stained with divine blood. Now, it burst forth with intense killing intent.

White light flickered in the Pontiff’s eyes. His scepter glowed as he used its side to parry the spear, pushing it away. Since the spear had locked onto him, he had no choice but to confront it directly.

Although the Ashfall Spear was parried, the Pontiff’s scepter was covered in cracks. A scepter worthy of being called a holy artifact was destroyed by the Ashfall Spear in a single exchange.

The Pontiff's expression finally turned grave. He stared at the Ashfall Spear in Anduin's hand. "No wonder you can awaken the diluted divine blood within your body. It seems this divine artifact is the key. So that's it..."

Divine blood was an incredibly powerful energy, but not everyone could awaken it. Divine Sons who could awaken their divine blood were extremely rare and would have been highly regarded even in ancient times.

However, during the peak of the Ancient Divine Realm, a Divine Son with such diluted divine blood as Anduin wouldn't even have been ranked, let alone allowed to touch a divine artifact.

Discarding the cracked, dim scepter, he waved his hand towards the Central Grand Cathedral. A streak of light flew into the Pontiff’s hand.

It was a long sword, also covered in cracks, with even some nicks and gaps, yet a brilliant glow still flowed within it, radiating an astonishing aura.

“Though this holy sword is not as renowned as your weapon, it is still relatively well-preserved and can suffice for now,” the Pontiff said, gripping the holy sword and casually swinging it. A forty-meter-long holy light sword energy was unleashed.

Anduin said nothing. His demonic god-like body burst with fiery light as he brandished his long spear, shattering the sword energy. It would be strange if a great sect like the Sacred God Sect didn't have one or two ancient artifacts as trump cards.

The Ashfall Spear flickered with intense flames, each thrust carrying immense power. Meanwhile, the Pontiff, holding the holy sword, exuded an aura of profound divinity; every movement was blessed with holy light.

Warrior against warrior, leader against leader, Anduin and the Pontiff fought fiercely. The Ashfall Cult members were also breaking through the layers of defense. Bor led a large contingent of Temple Knights to reinforce the fight, leaving only a fraction to encircle and eliminate Zhang Yi and Mu Su.
