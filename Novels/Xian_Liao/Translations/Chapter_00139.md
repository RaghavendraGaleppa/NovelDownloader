# Chapter 139: Forming the Golden Core (Seeking Monthly Tickets)

After instructing Yuan Mingyue on the key points of Foundation Establishment, Zhou Qing gave her a genuine Foundation Establishment Pill along with Blood Qi Pills refined from nine-leaf ginseng. 

Over the years, Fushan had continuously improved the Blood Qi Pills, making them increasingly effective for Qi cultivators. This was to compensate for the inherent deficiency of Qi cultivators' blood qi compared to Body cultivators.

Zhou Qing also set up a Spirit Gathering Array for Yuan Mingyue using ten mid-grade spirit stones. Over the years, Yuan Mingyue had occasionally consumed premium Dragon Pattern Rice, a privilege reserved for the five main branches of the Dao Court. The spiritual rice had gradually improved her physique.

She sat cross-legged in the Spirit Gathering Array, wearing thin clothing, and began her Foundation Establishment process. Her jade-like skin and bones faintly shimmered. Zhou Qing observed the entire process with his Insightful Void Eyes.

Yuan Mingyue was actually the first cultivator in the Dao Court to establish her foundation. Since Zhou Qing entered the Jingyang Dao Domain, three beast tides had occurred. During the second beast tide, Zhou Qing had made a name for himself as invincible below the Golden Core level. 

Nearly thirty years had passed since his first arrival in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Yuan Mingyue's breakthrough to Foundation Establishment marked a new milestone, signifying a breakthrough of great significance for the Dao Court's Qi cultivation path.

Body cultivators excelled in close combat, while Qi cultivators mastered endless divine abilities, spells, and magical instruments. Of course, cultivators could only specialize in limited aspects of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation. However, Qi cultivation offered greater diversity.

The current system of the Dao Court was that those who chose to undergo Heavenly Lightning Tribulation would focus on Body cultivation, while others would follow the Qi cultivation path. The previous generation of outer disciples were mostly martial cultivators focused on blood qi, so many had chosen the Heavenly Lightning path. However, as time passed and with the constant fifty percent mortality rate of the Heavenly Lightning Tribulation, fewer were willing to take the risk.

Overall, it was inevitable that Qi cultivators would become the mainstream. Yuan Mingyue, as the acting head of one branch, had delayed her Foundation Establishment for too long, which was somewhat unacceptable.

With Zhou Qing's guidance, Yuan Mingyue's Foundation Establishment proceeded smoothly. Zhou Qing also recorded the entire process as a reference for other disciples' future breakthroughs.

While overseeing Yuan Mingyue's breakthrough, Zhou Qing continued his cultivation of the Primordial Chaos Divine Light, starting with the Wood phase. Lin Wan'er played the Earthly Lute beside them, helping Yuan Mingyue stabilize her mind and body. The hundred-day Foundation Establishment period passed quickly.

Zhou Qing successfully progressed from the Wood phase to the Earth phase. Once he completed the Metal and Water phases, his cultivation would be complete.

---

Zhou Qing had already met the conditions for cultivating the Primordial Chaos Divine Light, and his progress was smooth. After Yuan Mingyue completed her Foundation Establishment, she cleansed herself with a Dust Removal Spell and came out to greet Zhou Qing.

Her jade-like skin and bones were even more pronounced, giving her a youthful appearance. If she were slightly shorter, she would resemble the Childlike Nun of Tianshan. But in Zhou Qing's eyes, her Profound Darkness Qi had completely fused with her marrow, becoming inseparable—a normally incurable ailment.

However, by analyzing Jingyang Zhenren's cultivation insights, Zhou Qing had vaguely conceived a solution that would also benefit his own future cultivation. In short, the higher Yuan Mingyue's cultivation, the more powerful her Profound Darkness Qi would become, and the greater the benefits for Zhou Qing.

Fire and water complement each other; the elixir forms as dragon and tiger unite. The Profound Darkness Qi had a tempering effect on the Golden Core after the Dao Furnace stage.

---

After Yuan Mingyue's breakthrough, Zhou Qing exchanged for high-grade spirit stones of the five elements at the Tianxuan City market and returned to the mortal realm.

He arrived at the Jingyang Cave Abode in the mortal realm. The eerie peach tree remained, as Zhou Qing had not moved it. The tree grew on the spiritual vein of the mountain, serving as the focal point of the Spirit Gathering Array deliberately placed by Jingyang Zhenren. The tree's ability to bear peaches that enhanced blood qi was related to this.

Zhou Qing set up another Spirit Gathering Array in the cave abode using the high-grade five-element spirit stones. With the Rooster and the little snake guarding outside, nothing in the mortal realm could disturb his Golden Core formation.

Once the array was complete, Zhou Qing smoothly completed the remaining Metal and Water phases of the Primordial Chaos Divine Light.

He did not inform Fushan and the others about his Golden Core formation. Although he was confident, what if he failed? After all, the next stage after the Dao Furnace was the Nine Revolutions Golden Core.

The first six revolutions corresponded to the early, middle, and late stages of the Golden Core and Nascent Soul realms. Moreover, the foundation built by the Nine Revolutions Golden Core far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators at the same level.

After mastering the Primordial Chaos Divine Light, Zhou Qing adjusted his body, divine sense, and Dao heart to their most perfect states. He also consumed a Jade Marrow Returning Pill.

He knew that after the next beast tide, Patriarch Tianxuan's life would come to an end, and the true calamity for humanity would arrive. Only by forming his Golden Core could Zhou Qing have the strength to protect himself when the Jingyang Dao Domain reappeared.

He was well aware that even if he successfully formed his Golden Core from the Dao Furnace, he would not initially match Patriarch Tianxuan's combat prowess.

Moreover, after refining the Life-Severing Blade into his Azure Wood Sword, Zhou Qing sensed an impending, terrifying danger from the White Moon Wolf Clan. This was an intuition derived from the Life-Severing Blade's material and his own heightened perception as a powerful cultivator.

Zhou Qing strongly suspected that the White Moon Wolf Clan's Nascent Soul-level elder, Howling Moon, might one day break the oath he had sworn to Jingyang. Oaths were a form of cosmic rule, but both cultivators and supernatural beings defied the heavens. Over time, it was possible to find ways to break the constraints of such oaths.

If Howling Moon broke his oath, all humans in the Jingyang Dao Domain would face annihilation—unless Patriarch Tianxuan achieved a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul realm in his final moments, continuing to protect the remaining humans.

Zhou Qing also discovered from ancient texts that every time humanity seemed on the verge of flourishing in the Jingyang Dao Domain, calamities struck. Jingyang had done everything right, yet he still mysteriously disappeared. There must be some profound cosmic secret behind this.

The rise of humanity was destined to face countless trials. The higher Zhou Qing's cultivation, the more he felt that the strength of his people was key to breaking through to higher realms and transcending life and death to "ascend."

Additionally, as the Dao Court grew, his Insightful Void Eyes vaguely perceived something called "fortune" enhancing him. Dynasties had fortune, and so did the Dao Court—a concept mentioned in ancient texts.

For example, Squire Zhang's transformation into a vengeful ghost was related to dynastic fortune, his scholarly rank, and certain special items in his home. Even the Esoteric Sect had methods to refine "Mingfei," a type of ghost deity.

Ancient sects in the Jingyang Dao Domain had legends of deification. Managing vast territories and populations, these sects would deify mountain and earth gods to better control mortals.

However, to truly perceive fortune, Zhou Qing needed to find the subsequent cultivation methods for the Insightful Void Eyes. Perhaps after forming his Golden Core, the Health Preservation Panel would reveal his own fortune.

Zhou Qing methodically sorted through his thoughts, recalling every detail of his past, leaving no stone unturned. During this process, regrets and desires surged like floodwaters.

With detached observation, Zhou Qing watched his own desires from a third-person perspective. In a sense, these desires were part of his true nature. But letting them run rampant would lead to demonic paths.

At the peak of the flood's fury, Zhou Qing's Dao heart manifested as a bright moon above his sea of consciousness. The turbulent waves of desire instantly calmed, and a wordless sense of freedom blossomed in his heart.

True freedom was not indulgence or lawlessness but knowing what one could and could not do—and having the discipline to adhere to it.

Boom!

Flames erupted from Zhou Qing's body—the Azure Sun Spiritual Fire igniting within his Dao Furnace. His vast blood qi served as fuel, and his body began a new transformation. Spiritual energy around him condensed into mist, rapidly flowing into his body.

Red, white, black, yellow, and green hues cycled across his skin. The sword aura of the Azure Wood Sword was purified in the flames. As Zhou Qing formed his Golden Core, his life-bound flying sword also underwent metamorphosis.

Mind and sword merged; man and weapon became one.

Five Elements True Body!

Unconsciously, Zhou Qing's body advanced beyond the Furnace realm toward the True Body stage. The Azure Sun Spiritual Fire returned to his heart, the Azure Wood Sword to his liver, the Primordial Heavy Water to his kidneys, the Geng Metal Qi to his lungs, and the Primordial Mother Qi filled his spleen.

Five-colored lights ignited within his organs. The effects of the Jade Marrow Returning Pill were fully unleashed. The Primordial Chaos Divine Light circulated among the five elements within his body.

Thunderous sounds echoed endlessly within him. His mana had long liquefied, surging like rivers. Embracing yin and yang, uniting form and spirit, he harmonized with heaven and earth, drawing spiritual energy like tides. Outside the Jingyang Cave Abode, winds gathered and clouds churned, forming dragon and tiger shapes.

The eight powers of heaven, earth, mountain, marsh, water, fire, wind, and thunder converged into the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace, further tempering and transforming Zhou Qing.

The Dao Furnace was the foundation of cultivation, but now Zhou Qing had taken the crucial step toward "defying the heavens to become immortal." His divine sense broke through once more during this process.

The world remained the same, but Zhou Qing's divine sense expanded dramatically, allowing him to perceive and explore far more than before.

Inside the Jingyang Cave Abode, the eight images representing heaven, earth, mountain, marsh, water, fire, wind, and thunder vanished. Soon, eight new patterns emerged, embodying the same concepts but now infused with Zhou Qing's own will rather than Jingyang's legacy.

The Dao is only me!

Outside the cave abode, the Rooster spread its wings, its body ablaze with brilliant flames. Beside it, the little snake emitted dragon-like roars, celebrating its master's achievement.

Far away in Jiangzhou's herb garden, the Great Mulberry Tree also burst into mystical flames, resonating with the Rooster.

---

Nine days and nights passed. The five-colored lights on Zhou Qing's body faded. During this time, the eight powers of heaven, earth, mountain, marsh, water, fire, wind, and thunder continuously tempered his Dao Furnace.

Finally, as the lights dissipated, a thin golden glow enveloped Zhou Qing's body, flowing like water. The Golden Core was not a physical pill but the perfection of the Dao Furnace—the harmonious completion of qi, body, and spirit after another metamorphosis.

For ordinary cultivators in the Jingyang Dao Domain, forming the Golden Core produced a thumb-sized, golden orb resembling a demon beast's inner core, embodying their essence, energy, and spirit. Zhou Qing was different.

His Golden Core represented the indestructible nature of gold and the perfection of his essence, energy, and spirit—an intangible yet real existence.

Observing his Health Preservation Panel:

**Name:** Zhou Qing  
**Lifespan:** 800 years  
**Cultivation:** Dao Furnace (First Revolution Golden Core)  
**Physical Body:** Five Elements True Body (Leak-proof Body, Limb Regeneration...)  
**Divine Sense:** Mid Golden Core stage  
**Golden Core Domain:** Five-zhang Inner World, Five-hundred-zhang Domain  
**Life-bound Treasure:** Azure Wood Sword (Treasure Embryo)  
**Divine Abilities:** Primordial Chaos Divine Light (Beginner), Insightful Void Eyes (Third Layer), Thousand Illusions (Proficient), Azure Sun Spiritual Fire (Proficient), Primordial Heavy Water (First Layer Perfection)...  
**Sword Dao:** Sword Qi Thunder Sound  
**Mid-grade Artifact Refining (Proficient), Mid-grade Alchemy (Proficient)**  
**Beast Taming:** Little Snake (Fourth-rank Demon Beast, Foundation Establishment Late Stage)  
**Spirit Cultivation Spells:** Tiger Demon Ming King (Foundation Establishment Late Stage, Guardian, Mind Stabilization, Mind Disruption...)  
**Demonic Arts:** Soul Bewitchment (Proficient)  
**Spells:** Frost Engulfs the World...  
**Unique Skills:** Three Origins Return to One...  

Zhou Qing first noted his lifespan. Ordinary Golden Core cultivators lived up to 500 years, but he had 800. This number held special significance—in his previous life's Daoist texts, it was said: "Breathing in and out, expelling the old and taking in the new, moving like a bear and stretching like a bird—these are the practices of those who cultivate longevity, like Peng Zu who lived 800 years."

The bear and bird movements were the foundation of Zhou Qing's Five Animal Exercises. Moreover, his Five Elements True Body granted him limb regeneration—a rare ability even among Body cultivators, typically seen only in wood-attribute demonic beings or mid-stage True Body cultivators specializing in wood-element techniques.

The physical body was a cultivator's vessel through the mortal world, not to be lightly damaged. With this ability, Zhou Qing no longer feared bodily harm. Of course, regeneration consumed vast amounts of vitality, but he had ample pills to replenish it.

His divine sense now reached eighty li at maximum range. Ordinary mid Golden Core cultivators typically had a range of 150 li, while late-stage ones reached 200 li under normal circumstances (though this could vary).

In Tianxuan City, an unusual spiritual fluctuation appeared.

"Someone is attempting Golden Core formation!"

The city's cultivators grew tense. They desperately needed a new Golden Core cultivator. But the fluctuation lasted only briefly before dissipating.

"Another failure," someone sighed, knowing such a short duration rarely led to success.

Then Shang Zijian announced to the city, "This was Golden Light Fellow Daoist testing the waters. The actual breakthrough will follow, during which the city's spiritual energy will prioritize him. Please refrain from secluded cultivation during this period to avoid disruptions."

Discussions erupted. "Golden Light must be confident if he asked Shang Fellow Daoist to announce this."

"Since the beast tide before last, over a decade has passed with no news from Qinglingzi at Luopoling. It seems Golden Light will form his core first."

"Qinglingzi is invincible below Golden Core, but Golden Light's breakthrough changes everything. The difference between Golden Core and Foundation Establishment is vast. Qinglingzi's invincibility may not translate to superior abilities at the Golden Core level."

Speculation about Tianxuan City's future spread. Over the years, there had been no news of Patriarch Tianxuan's Nascent Soul breakthrough. As cultivators neared the end of their lifespans, breakthroughs became increasingly unlikely—a well-known truth. Few held hope for Patriarch Tianxuan, only wishing he could hold on a little longer.

But that time would unlikely exceed fifty years. Even if Golden Light succeeded now, reaching mid Golden Core in fifty years was improbable. To replace Patriarch Tianxuan as Tianxuan City's guardian, one needed at least late Golden Core strength—and not just any late-stage cultivator.

Analyzing the situation, many concluded that when Tianxuan City fell, they would scatter. Golden Core cultivators were the best protectors, but the Jin Clan had many members and limited capacity to shelter others. Larger groups would attract demonic attention, becoming targets. Luopoling was another option, but for now, Golden Light was the preferred choice.

As time passed, Tianxuan City's spiritual veins began to tremble. Hope for Golden Light's success grew. Eventually, wind and clouds gathered in the sky, forming dragon and tiger shapes that lasted three days before dissipating.

"The longer the Golden Core phenomenon, the deeper the foundation and greater the potential."

"Patriarch Tianxuan's phenomenon lasted seven days—rare even in ancient sects."

"There are no records of Jingyang Zhenren's phenomenon. Some speculate he formed his core in a secret realm."

"Ancient texts mention phenomena lasting up to eight days at most. Patriarch Tianxuan once said nine days was possible."

"Nine days? Such a foundation would indicate potential for immortality!"

Immortality was a legend among legends in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Even ancient sects that perished in cataclysms had no records of ascension. The closest were primordial deities. Some modern demonic beings were descendants of these deities.

Human "immortal bodies" were said to result from ancestral exposure to deity blood—a theory explored by ancient sects like the Heavenly River Sect and Divine Water Palace.

Golden Light's three-day phenomenon was average by Jingyang Dao Domain standards—neither exceptional nor poor. The weakest was the External Pill method using a Golden Core demon beast's inner core, which granted Golden Core strength but with a Foundation Establishment lifespan and no further progress (phenomenon: one day).

Slightly better was the Evil Qi method, rarely used even by demonic cultivators. The four demonic sect leaders had phenomena lasting four days, with the Blood Demon Sect leader reaching five—a rare talent. The Black Water Sect leader managed four and a half days, slightly inferior.

But the strongest among them was the Life-Severing Sect's leader, whose Life-Severing Sword Scripture granted unparalleled offensive power.

In the mortal realm's Jingyang Cave Abode, as Zhou Qing refined his mana, golden light tinged with purple emerged. He gathered solar essence from the mortal realm, transforming it into wisps of purple qi that floated like mist within his Dao Furnace.

Nearly three years passed before Zhou Qing stabilized his Golden Core foundation. Ordinary Golden Core cultivators typically took half a year, but Zhou Qing's process was far more profound.

Now, his mana shimmered with purple-gold hues, dense as mercury, filling him with unprecedented power—a sense that the world was his to explore.

Suddenly, the stars seemed to shift, and time and space inverted. The scene before him changed:

He was back in Hu Village's private school. Butcher Hu ran toward him, excited. "Little Zhou Teacher, congratulations!"

The students were puzzled. Butcher Hu declared, "No class today—everyone gets a feast this afternoon!" At the mention of food, their eyes lit up.

Butcher Hu continued, "Little Zhou Teacher has topped the imperial exams, entered the state academy, and will receive a stipend!"

The students erupted. "Teacher passed the imperial exams—and came first!"

Butcher Hu urged, "Come quickly! The messengers are with the village elders. We've already given them rewards." His eyes gleamed with excitement.

The students clamored for Zhou Qing to go. Calmly, Zhou Qing said, "After cultivating to this stage, do you think mere demonic illusions can deceive me?"

A sword emerged from his heart, slaughtering the students and Butcher Hu without hesitation. Black water filled the ground beneath him, with vengeful ghosts howling. Ignoring them, he activated his Insightful Void Eyes, and Azure Sun Spiritual Fire evaporated the black water.

Legends spoke of celestial demons obstructing cultivation breakthroughs through temptation or terror. Zhou Qing stepped out of the Jingyang Cave Abode under a bright moon, its light pure as water, the mortal world like smoke.

In Jiangzhou's herb garden, Lin Wan'er played the zither while Yuan Mingyue accompanied her on the flute. Zhou Qing had been absent for so long that they grew wistful and worried. But the Great Mulberry Tree's earlier anomaly suggested his successful Golden Core formation.

As they played, the tree swayed joyfully. A breeze entered the garden.

"Wan'er, Mingyue, what delightful music."

A figure alighted on the tree's crown, standing gracefully in the wind—none other than Zhou Qing. The women rejoiced.

After brief reunions, Zhou Qing inquired about the time and learned the beast tide was imminent. He then teleported to the Water Manor.

Sensing the shifting spiritual energy, he knew the beast tide was coming but did not reveal himself. His Insightful Void Eyes had spotted a familiar "face." Luopoling would face significant pressure this time—good training for Fushan and Zhang Jingxiu.

He also wondered if other friends would come to help. Concealed in the void near Luopoling, invisible to all, he waited.

---

The decennial beast tide arrived. At Luopoling, Zhang Jingxiu, Fushan, and the Earth Armor Dragon stood ready, forming the strongest defense line. Over the years, the Earth Armor Dragon had enjoyed its best life at Luopoling, freed from the beast tide's influence by Zhou Qing's taming.

Now, as beasts attacked its beloved home, the dragon grew furious. Its massive tail swept through the enemy ranks like an iron staff, leaving carnage in its wake. The beasts—even some Foundation Establishment-level ones—were bewildered. This Earth Armor Dragon was supposed to be docile—why was it so vicious?

With the dragon holding the ground, Zhang Jingxiu and Fushan took to the skies. Zhang, now a true late Furnace-stage cultivator, battled a fierce Dark Eagle and quickly defeated it. But more beasts converged on Luopoling.

By the first day, their numbers already exceeded the fifth day of the previous tide. "This isn't right," Fushan realized, seeing the unprecedented assault. In the distance, a young figure coldly observed Luopoling, directing the beast tide's flow.

"Immortal Maiden, we can't hold this place," the Qiu brothers said to Luo Xian'gu, who had reached Foundation Establishment. They sensed something amiss—Luopoling was being targeted like Tianxuan City.

Luo shook her head. "If we retreat, we'll be picked off one by one." The brothers sighed but accepted her reasoning. They glanced at Zhang and Fushan, knowing the two elders could escape anytime—even Luo could flee. But the market's loose cultivators would be doomed.

Fortunately, over the years, Luopoling's market had merged with Tianxuan City's, and they had gathered ample resources now stored with the elders. As long as the elders survived, they would honor Qinglingzi's legacy.

The Qiu brothers, having failed Foundation Establishment, were disheartened. Their first instinct was to flee, but Luo knew the Dark Eagles would hunt them down—especially the brothers. Moreover, they owed Qinglingzi their lives and cultivation. Even at the cost of their lives, they would repay him.

Meanwhile, Fushan transmitted to Luo, "Fellow Luo, escape if you get the chance."

Luo replied, "Elder, I promised Qinglingzi to protect Luopoling's market."

Fushan thought, "Stubborn as ever. Junior Brother, where are you? No response yet?"

He spotted the White Moon Wolf Clan's Greed Wolf Holy Son and guessed revenge was the motive. Twenty years later, the Holy Son seemed even more formidable—had he reached Golden Core?

Fushan dismissed the thought. If so, Patriarch Tianxuan would have intervened.

---

"Holy Son, it seems Qinglingzi isn't here."

The Holy Son smirked. "Destroy Luopoling, and he'll show himself." After suffering under Patriarch Howling Moon's harsh training, he had mastered the first layer of the Heavenly Demon True Body, surpassing his former strength.

The first layer rivaled Golden Core demon beasts in physicality, though his demonic power fell short. At the second layer, he would be a true Golden Core demon. Since he hadn't officially reached that stage, he could still join the beast tide without violating agreements with Patriarch Tianxuan.

His Life-Severing Blade had been confiscated and erased by Patriarch Tianxuan. Though he gained the Heavenly Demon True Body and a reforged fragment of Patriarch Howling Moon's Moon Blade (now a treasure embryo), losing his life-bound weapon was an unbearable humiliation.

He had come for vengeance. Watching Luopoling's defensive formations crumble, he grinned cruelly. No one would escape.

---

Tianxuan City faced its weakest beast tide in years—because the pressure had shifted to Luopoling.

"Fellow Shang, it seems Luopoling is bearing the brunt," Golden Light remarked. With Patriarch Tianxuan long absent, Golden Light had become the city's pillar.

Shang Zijian asked, "Do you know why?"

Golden Light: "Likely related to the White Moon Wolf Holy Son. Luopoling won't last unless Qinglingzi appears."

Shang proposed sending reinforcements. Golden Light agreed: "Qinglingzi's absence suggests he's focusing on Golden Core formation. With Tianxuan City safe, organize a rescue team."

He also instructed the Jin Clan's leader to take two Foundation Establishment cultivators—including Ye Chong, now a late Foundation Establishment Jin Clan elder.

After forming his Golden Core, Golden Light's vision expanded. He hoped for another Golden Core cultivator to emerge—preferably Qinglingzi over the untrustworthy demonic sect leaders.

Ye Chong had reconciled with Zhou Qing over the years, acknowledging his past faults. Now, he volunteered to repay his debts.

The Jin leader joked, "I can hardly believe you were once one of Tianxuan's Three Fears."

Ye Chong smiled faintly. "That's in the past."

At Luopoling, Ye Chong unleashed his Profound Yin Ghost Slaughter, scattering Dark Eagles with blade lights. The Jin leader and another elder joined the assault, relieving pressure on Zhang Jingxiu.

---

Crane Sage, a long-time Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator, found this beast tide manageable. Noticing the Jin Clan's departure, he hesitated before following—reasoning that Golden Light's goodwill toward Luopoling signaled Qinglingzi's imminent Golden Core breakthrough.

As a near-Golden Core expert, he could escape unless a Golden Core demon intervened. Qinglingzi's youth suggested eventual success even if he failed now. Better to forge ties early.

Fushan had mended fences with Crane Sage over the years, sending gifts like spiritual tea. Their banter had turned friendly—though not enough to warrant Crane Sage's aid alone. But with the Jin Clan involved, he decided to act.

Arriving at Luopoling, Crane Sage stabilized the faltering defenses. Luo and the others sighed in relief, though Zhang remained tense.

"Old Crane, did you only come because the Jin Clan did?" Fushan teased via divine sense.

Crane Sage retorted, "I came to collect your corpse."

Fushan laughed. "I'm blessed—maybe one day I'll live forever. You can share in my fortune."

Crane Sage rolled his eyes. "I'm leaving at the first sign of trouble. Don't beg for help."

Fushan's bluntness eased old tensions. In the treacherous Jingyang Dao Domain, such honesty was rare.

"Junior Brother, I've talked big—don't let me down now," Fushan thought, though ready to flee if necessary. When Qinglingzi emerged as a Golden Core cultivator, Crane Sage would eat his words.

In cultivation realms, strength ruled supreme.

With reinforcements, Luopoling's situation improved. Then, an overwhelming aura erupted from the distance. Space itself seemed to vibrate as terrifying energy crashed toward Luopoling.

A colossal blade light filled the sky, its unstoppable force rendering all spells meaningless. The explosion shook the earth. Fushan's body trembled violently; Crane Sage felt death's approach. Even Zhang Jingxiu, facing his first near-death experience in the Jingyang Dao Domain, felt his scalp prickle.

A wolf's howl echoed through the void, casting deep despair over Luopoling's defenders. Crane Sage struggled to steady himself—the Holy Son's pressure was like a Golden Core cultivator's.

"Are the demons breaking their pact with Patriarch Tianxuan?"

"Greed Wolf, don't push humanity too far!"

The howling ceased, but the oppressive aura intensified, freezing the very air. In the suffocating silence, the Holy Son spoke:

"Today, all humans at Luopoling will die."

Death's shadow loomed, drowning all in hopelessness. Then—thunder cracked like divine judgment, and a sword light emerged, its radiance like clouds and flowing water, engulfing the Holy Son.

Moments later, blood rain fell from the sky. The sun returned, revealing a young Daoist riding the wind, hands behind his back, his brow outshining the southern wilds, eyes like stars that stole one's gaze.

"Only this much?" he said lightly.
