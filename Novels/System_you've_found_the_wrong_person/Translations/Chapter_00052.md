# Chapter 52: Misfortune Arises, Misfortune Shifts

Liang Region, Beiyang.

Beiyang Prefecture was one of the fourteen prefectures in Liang Region. 

With its vast, open terrain and flat plains, it served as a crucial hub connecting the capital to the northern territories. A nexus of commerce and trade, it bustled with merchant caravans that stretched like an endless dragon through its lands. 

This prosperous region had been granted to the deposed emperor as the fiefdom of the Northern Yang Prince, with Beiyang Prefecture transformed from a provincial capital into a princely state—a clear indication of the imperial court's preferential treatment toward the former ruler. The tax revenues from Beiyang alone were enough to sustain the deposed emperor's extravagant lifestyle.

After the escort mission encountered the attack by the Bloody-Handed Jin Sanming, the remainder of the journey passed without incident. It wasn't until arriving in Beiyang that Dou Changsheng began to feel restless.

For several days now, every attempt to request an audience with the Northern Yang Prince had been denied. This made Dou Changsheng wonder—did this deposed emperor even truly exist?

Returning empty-handed yet again, Dou Changsheng realized that if this continued, he would never get a chance to meet the Northern Yang Prince. 

As a former emperor, the Northern Yang Prince's status was highly sensitive. Unlike ordinary feudal lords, he couldn't casually receive outsiders. Once he entered the Northern Yang Prince's residence, there would be no further opportunities for him to leave.

Ma Liren wouldn't stop him—the true authority lay with his so-called "cheap sister," Dou Taizhen. 

Her temperament was capricious, fluctuating between kindness and malice. As she herself had claimed, it was due to "evil thoughts at work"—though whether this was true remained an open question.

Dou Changsheng had no desire to see Dou Taizhen, but now he had no choice.

The task entrusted to him by the Grand General remained unfulfilled, and Dou Changsheng was a man of principle—he wouldn't take benefits without delivering on his promises.

Dou Taizhen lay lazily on a long couch, her white gauze dress accentuating her curves as she rested with closed eyes. The elderly swordswoman stood behind her, kneading her shoulders.

As Dou Changsheng approached, faint strands of light began to shimmer, coalescing into an ethereal figure. 

The luminous silhouette was pure and translucent, like glazed glass, its features serene and holy. A black mole between its brows resembled a closed heavenly eye, exuding divinity. 

It cast a glance at Dou Changsheng before slowly ascending into the sky and vanishing.

The young swordswoman stepped forward, blocking Dou Changsheng's path. In a childish voice, she declared: 

"On the first day of the tenth month this year, the Jixia Academy will host its decennial Ten Thousand Laws Assembly. Our master has been invited as a lecturer to expound upon the Dao of Yin and Yang."

"Don't even think about it—the Ten Thousand Laws Assembly is presided over by the ninth-ranked expert on the Heavenly Rankings, Sage Lu. All participants are Earth Rankings grandmasters."

"In ten years, the top-ranked Sage Jin will be invited to lecture. You might have a chance then."

Dou Changsheng's lips twitched, but before he could speak, the childish voice continued:

"Your purpose here is already known to our master."

---

"The master has her reasons for preventing you from seeing the little emperor."

"If you can't even grasp this much, lacking even a third of Chen Qingyao's cleverness, you won't last long in this world."

A cold, youthful voice interjected: 

"The matter of the deposed emperor is not as simple as it appears."

"That little emperor is not one to resign himself to obscurity—he will inevitably stir up storms in the future."

"The master doesn't want you entangled in this mess, nor does she wish to involve herself further in the imperial family's squabbles. In the end, Yu Yun was too naive—but Chen Qingyao is different. His mind twists like nine bends and eighteen turns; no one in the world schemes more than he does."

"If Yu Yun knew the little emperor's thoughts, how could he have hidden them from Chen Qingyao?"

"Your escort mission was undoubtedly Chen Qingyao's doing—he pushed events behind the scenes."

"Don't bother with these rotten affairs. Once you've escorted the little emperor to the princely residence, leave Northern Jin immediately. Head to Western Qin or Eastern Qi—that will thwart all of Chen Qingyao's schemes."

"If Yu Yun demands an explanation, tell him this:"

"Among the nine adopted sons, one is Chen Qingyao's mole. It was this traitor's deliberate misconduct that made the little emperor distrust Yu Yun, leading to this chain of events."

"Don't ask who it is—I won't say more."

"If the clues are this obvious and he still can't figure it out—or refuses to believe—then the problem lies with Yu Yun."

"Stay out of it. The Empress and Yu Yun are no match for Chen Qingyao."

"In warfare, ten Chen Qingyaos couldn't rival Yu Yun. But in schemes and intrigue, few in the world can contend with him."

As the cold voice faded, the childish tone resumed:

"The master has said:"

"Unless you reach the Earth Rankings, do not go to the grasslands."

"Your best destination is Western Qin. Since Legalist Li Yan entered Qin, the state has grown stronger by the day—but Qin's laws have also grown harsher, especially toward martial artists. Without official approval, carrying weapons is forbidden. Those who fight without authorization face branding at best, execution at worst."

"From diet to travel, everything is strictly regulated. Those who dare overstep will not escape Qin Law's blade."

"All must act according to the law."

"You are not one to trample rules—Qin's legal system won't hinder you."

"Instead, the Qin way of governance will broaden your perspective."

"Southern Chen isn't worth mentioning. With the Demon Master single-handedly propping up the state, demons run rampant. With your Qingyang techniques, you wouldn't last three days."

"Eastern Qi is a land of a hundred flowers, the most open of all. But precisely because of this, orthodox and unorthodox factions gather there. Like Southern Chen, countless would covet your Qingyang techniques."

Dou Changsheng sighed inwardly.

In Northern Jin, the Wang Clan's protection had shielded him from most dangers. But Chen Qingyao's schemes never ceased—knowing his "cheap sister's" identity, he would inevitably exploit it.

Since Dou Changsheng wasn't a true Wang disciple, the clan wouldn't assign a Pure Yin or Pure Yang grandmaster to guard him day and night.

His only option was to flee to another land—and Western Qin was the safest choice.

Qin's strict legal system left no room for demonic sects to thrive.

The world was in turmoil.

Northern Jin had power-hungry ministers plotting to usurp the state.

Western Qin's reforms were bearing fruit. Dou Changsheng recalled how the Wolf Lord had invited the Living Buddha of the Western Regions—who traveled thousands of miles to the royal court—precisely because Qin was now conquering the Western Regions.

Qin's military laws were merciless. Those who disobeyed orders saw their commanders executed first, followed by deputies, with all officers held collectively responsible.

Having passed the most difficult phase of reform, Qin's armies now advanced relentlessly—generals fearless, soldiers unafraid of death, victory after victory.

The late emperor's sudden death, the young emperor's deposition, the power-hungry minister's usurpation, the empress's political manipulations—all signs pointed to a collapsing dynasty.

"Great Jin is doomed," Dou Changsheng suddenly thought.

Exhaling deeply, he finally spoke:

"I'll send a letter to the Grand General."

"Once the Northern Yang Prince enters his residence, I'll prepare to journey west to Qin."

"Will you be coming with me?"

An aged voice replied:

"No need."

"Every year at the Awakening of Insects, spring thunder arrives, and the master must enter dormancy. But recently, for some reason, thunder has begun gathering prematurely."

"The master must rest now."

"How strange."

"Shouldn't the situation be improving?"

"Why has it worsened instead?"

What a wonderful sister she was!
