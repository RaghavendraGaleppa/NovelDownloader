**Chapter 78: King of the Spirit Field Zone**

However, no cultivator would resent Ding Rui for this, because they all knew that even without Ding Rui, they wouldn't receive these honors. Before Ding Rui, no cultivator had ever experienced such things. More importantly, all of this was merely Jiang She's personal opinion for now. Although Jiang She was an important disciple of the Pill Hall and a prominent figure among the inner disciples, his words naturally weren't baseless remarks. However, as the events hadn't yet transpired, the shock to these onlookers wasn't as profound.

"If Junior Brother Ding Rui truly is so talented, then wouldn't it be a loss for the sect if he breaks through the Qi Refining stage and leaves the spirit fields?" someone suddenly remarked.

Jiang She also nodded in agreement: "If Junior Brother Ding indeed has no other talents, then even if he breaks through the Qi Refining stage and becomes an outer disciple, the sect would probably arrange for him to continue working in the spirit fields and make some adjustments accordingly. At that time, Junior Brother Ding would definitely be able to expand his capabilities and achieve greater things within the spirit fields."

"But I heard from our Miscellaneous Hall disciples that an elder brother from the Miscellaneous Hall once spoke of Junior Brother Ding Rui and wanted to recruit him into the Miscellaneous Hall," said a Miscellaneous Hall cultivator who had come to help. Miscellaneous Hall cultivators were the most likely to create surprises, but also the most likely to have slackers. Almost all non-production work within the sect was handled by the Miscellaneous Hall. At this time, most of them weren't overly busy, so they were naturally assigned to the spirit fields to provide what help they could.

"Indeed, Junior Brother Ding previously invented saddles and stirrups, which shocked even the horse-cultivating tribes at the time," Mu Tian, also in the crowd, couldn't help but interject. He was also a talented cultivator; otherwise, he wouldn't have achieved his current cultivation and status. But he admitted to himself that when he was at Ding Rui's stage, he truly couldn't compare to Ding Rui in terms of being a 'genius.'

"Junior Brother Ding Rui truly is an extraordinary person!" someone exclaimed. This immediately brought a wave of agreement and echoing voices.

"It's as if he was born specifically for the spirit fields."

"Look at his fluidity; even an outer disciple like me isn't that fluid."

"Indeed, and I specifically observed that the time he takes to loosen the soil for every two Meridian-Connecting Flowers is almost exactly the same. What kind of stability is that?"

"Simply astounding!"

...

For a time, this small area in the spirit fields became practically a Ding Rui discussion conference. It was just that Dong Feng had been focused on alchemy recently and truly had no mind to join such excitement. Otherwise, if he were standing in this crowd, he probably wouldn't have been able to stay for long. The onlookers, the cultivators, discussed animatedly.

Who knew if Ding Rui truly would soar to prominence as Jiang She predicted, gain the sect's attention, and become the true king of all spirit fields within the sect's domain? Although the king of the spirit fields would still be within the spirit fields, the connections that needed to be forged still had to be forged! A cultivator capable of earning such praise from Inner Disciple Senior Brother Jiang She—Ding Rui was truly one of a kind!

Jiang She smiled at Ding Rui, looking very optimistic, and said, "Junior Brother, keep working hard. With your talent, you are bound to become an extraordinary cultivator. Senior Brother looks forward to that day!"

Ding Rui smiled a little shyly, but still nodded and said, "I will work hard, Senior Brother. Once I break through the Qi Refining stage, I'll come find you in the Pill Hall." This was Ding Rui's true thought. Compared to Shui Yu's previous invitation to the Miscellaneous Hall, he personally leaned more towards the Pill Hall or the Artifact Hall. Because the Miscellaneous Hall's activities were more geared towards creation, he wouldn't be able to fully utilize the strengths of his skill bar there. Alchemy and artifact refining, however, were different. Given the unique nature of his skill bar, he very likely had immense room to display his talents on both these paths!
