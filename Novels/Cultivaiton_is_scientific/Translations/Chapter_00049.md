# Chapter 49: Security

In the study, Li Shiming wore an eyepatch that had been modified with an LCD screen from a disassembled fiber optic splicer, serving as a monitor. Two hundred meters above the courtyard, a camouflaged drone hovered silently.

It had been ten days since the cultivator gathering ended, and Zhongdu City was still immersed in a festive atmosphere. During this time, Li Shiming had remained highly vigilant, constantly monitoring his surroundings to guard against any sudden attacks from other cultivators. He hadn't even left the city.

The cultivators he feared never appeared. Instead, he successfully built the drone. 

The software and hardware for the drone weren't difficult to assemble, thanks to the components from the disassembled fiber optic splicer and the database in the IBM z15. The real challenge had been crafting high-precision lenses. Over several days, he used an electric arc furnace to produce the most transparent glass possible, then painstakingly ground it to meet specifications within the server room space. This was only possible because his consciousness could achieve micrometer-level precision there. Without this ability, the process would have taken much longer. Once he gained experience, producing additional lenses became much faster.

The drone was disguised to resemble a Xia eagle when viewed from below—a species revered by the Great Xia imperial family. At least within Zhongdu, no one would dare attack such a bird. The only drawback was the drone's limited battery life. Even with additional batteries, its maximum flight time was only twenty minutes.

However, Li Shiming no longer had to worry about intruders in his courtyard. While building the drone, he had also created four wireless camera probes connected to his monitoring eyepatch. The main display showed the drone's perspective, while four smaller windows displayed feeds from the ground cameras—all of which could be switched to the main view at any time. If not for the limited number of chips available (mostly salvaged from the fiber optic splicer), he would have made more probes.

Both the aerial drone and ground cameras operated in two modes: daytime vision using high-precision lenses, and nighttime infrared thermal imaging. The thermal mode was actually more effective, as no one could hide from heat detection—though this advantage would disappear if cultivators learned to mask their thermal signatures.

Extending his spiritual tendrils, Li Shiming used the *Object Control Technique* to operate the remote and recall the drone. This served dual purposes—controlling the device while practicing his technique.

The drone flew back through the window. Li Shiming swapped its battery for a fresh one but didn't relaunch it, instead storing it away. With this security system in place, his restless mind finally settled.

Entering the server room space with his consciousness, he checked on the grafted spiritual plant. The procedure had been successful—new leaves had sprouted, revealing it to be a tea plant. He couldn't imagine what had damaged the spiritual tea tree so severely that only roots and two branches remained. Without grafting technology, the sterile environment of the server room, the custom nutrient solution, and his repeated use of the *Spring Rain Technique*, the plant would have died long ago. Its revival represented a perfect fusion of previous-world technology and this world's magic.

Though leaves had grown, the plant was still too small to harvest. Li Shiming would wait for new branches to develop before considering picking tea leaves. There was no point in overharvesting a few tender leaves now when he could enjoy daily spiritual tea in the future.

Removing his eyepatch, Li Shiming took a deep breath to calm himself. The spiritual tea from the gathering had significantly boosted his spiritual energy, allowing him to cast *Light Body Technique* five more times per day. Over ten days, he had attempted to draw *Primary Light Body Talismans* nearly a hundred times—and failed every time. Yet each failure brought him closer to success through accumulated experience. Creating even this simplest of talismans made him appreciate how difficult cultivation truly was.

With the IBM z15's help, he could identify every mistake—yet still required over a hundred attempts. How many failures would an ordinary cultivator need to produce a single successful talisman?

Picking up the Snow Spirit Brush, he dipped it in precisely measured talisman ink—an amount determined through four previous failures. As spiritual energy gathered in the brush, merging with the ink at its tip, he began drawing on the talisman paper. The essence of a convertible sports car flowed through the brush as it moved steadily across the paper, his entire being focused on the task.

When the brush finally lifted, the *Light Body* rune on the paper emitted a brilliant cyan glow that quickly faded as the spiritual energy condensed into the paper. Li Shiming watched as the talisman successfully solidified the *Light Body Technique* within itself—a flawless result that surprised even him.

Checking his remaining energy (only one *Object Control Technique* used today), he immediately prepared another talisman. Again, cyan light filled the study as spiritual energy sealed into the paper.

"They say talisman success rates are low..." Li Shiming mused as he set down the brush. 

Ordinary cultivators relied on vague experiential knowledge, attributing failures to chance. But with the IBM z15, Li Shiming could pinpoint every mistake and eliminate them systematically. By the time he successfully created a third *Primary Light Body Talisman*, he understood his true success rate—not quite 100%, but close enough. With more practice and accumulated experience, his success rate would only improve.
