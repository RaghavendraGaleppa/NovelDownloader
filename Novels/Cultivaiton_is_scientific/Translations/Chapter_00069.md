# Chapter 69: Iron Corpse

"Kekeke, I didn't expect you to be prepared. I wonder how you discovered us?" The Xuanming Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivator showed no signs of panic as he stood upon a cloud of black mist.

Elder Zhao and Elder Dai didn't immediately attack. Battles between Foundation Establishment cultivators were extremely dangerous, and even with a two-to-one advantage, they couldn't guarantee victory. The main concern was the Xuanming Sect cultivator's numerous bizarre techniques—they needed to proceed with caution.

"Your Xuanming Sect disciples have already reached the capital of Great Xia. How could we not notice your plans?" Elder Zhao replied coldly while channeling his spiritual energy.

"Damn it, which brat ruined our plans?" the Xuanming Sect cultivator cursed inwardly.

He knew the sect hadn't sent any disciples into Great Xia's capital—that was a mortal realm. It was an unwritten rule that sect conflicts didn't involve mortals. If both sides targeted mortal populations, cultivators could easily wipe out all commoners in each other's territories. This would leave both sects without new spiritual root seedlings, cutting off their future generations.  

This continent wasn't solely ruled by their two sects. If they weakened, other sects would seize the opportunity. As for rogue Xuanming Sect disciples causing trouble in mortal worlds—that was inevitable. Not just in Tianhai Sect's territory, even within Xuanming-controlled regions, cultivators occasionally stirred up trouble. This stemmed from their cultivation techniques—many sinister methods grew stronger and faster with ample flesh and blood sacrifices.

"The Xuanming Sect hasn't sent disciples into mortal realms!" the Xuanming cultivator insisted. He had to make this clear regardless of whether they believed him. The sect needed to maintain its stance.

"No more talk!" Elder Dai seemed impatient. With a wave of his hand, a sword light shot toward a Xuanming Qi Refining cultivator. His action marked the battle's beginning.  

Elder Zhao flung a talisman at the Xuanming Foundation Establishment cultivator—his role was to stall the enemy while Elder Dai eliminated the Qi Refining disciples. Once that was done, they could jointly eliminate the Foundation Establishment opponent.

"Ah!" A scream rang out as a Xuanming Qi Refiner was pierced through the heart by Elder Dai's sword, his body plummeting from the sky.  

Just as Elder Dai prepared to attack another, the Xuanming Foundation Establishment cultivator lunged at Elder Zhao. Simultaneously, a black figure materialized beside him.

---

"It's an Iron Corpse!" Elder Zhao's expression changed drastically. He hastily retreated while shouting, flinging multiple talismans to block the approaching figures.  

The Iron Corpse was an evolved form of a refined corpse, possessing Foundation Establishment-level strength and defense surpassing ordinary cultivators of the same realm. It ignored Elder Zhao's talismans, letting them strike its body without evasion.  

Frost mist formed around the corpse, attempting to slow it, but the Iron Corpse's immense strength shattered the ice as soon as it formed. Behind it, the Xuanming cultivator launched several dark mist projectiles.  

Elder Dai could no longer pursue the Qi Refiners. He turned to assist Elder Zhao. Neither elder had anticipated facing such a formidable opponent.  

Iron Corpses were extremely difficult to refine—advancing a corpse from Bronze to Iron was comparable to elevating a Qi Refiner to Foundation Establishment, if not harder. The resources required made it more practical for sects to nurture actual cultivators instead.  

"Kill those spiritual root seedlings!" the Xuanming cultivator commanded the remaining four Qi Refiners when he saw Elder Dai join the fight. His initial plan had been to abduct the seedlings, but since that failed, destroying them was the next best option.  

Elder Dai and Elder Zhao wanted to intervene, but the Xuanming cultivator and Iron Corpse now pressed them relentlessly. The corpse's speed increased midair—its reckless, offense-only fighting style unsettled the Tianhai Sect elders.  

They avoided its black claws at all costs; a single scratch carried corpse poison capable of afflicting even Foundation Establishment cultivators. Neutralizing such toxins was notoriously difficult.  

With the Xuanming cultivator harassing them, the aerial battle reached a stalemate, leaving the Tianhai elders unable to disengage.  

Brother Ma and Brother Wu had no choice but to fight. Facing four late-stage Qi Refiners, they struggled against even one opponent individually. They fought desperately, hurling talismans like they were worthless, barely holding off two enemies. But such desperate measures couldn't last long.  

Li Shiming watched as two Xuanming Qi Refiners closed in. Suddenly, the flying vessel plunged downward—likely because the elders realized that if the ship was destroyed at this altitude, none of the mortal disciples would survive the fall.  

---

The two Xuanming pursuers chased the descending vessel, soon leaving the Foundation Establishment battlefield behind.  

"Stay calm!" Li Shiming suppressed his panic, his mind rapidly analyzing the situation with IBMz15's assistance.  

The landscape below became visible—a lake where the vessel was heading.  

"Good luck, everyone," he murmured, glancing back.  

He knew the vessel had defensive formations, having observed them during the mission. However, these formations couldn't withstand sustained attacks from two late-stage Qi Refiners. This wasn't a combat vessel—to accommodate mortal passengers, many formations had been removed to make space for living facilities.  

If he could lure away one attacker, the other disciples' survival odds would improve.  

This was also self-preservation—he couldn't stake his life on the ship's failing defenses. Staying aboard meant certain death once the two Qi Refiners broke through.  

Instantly, he activated a *Primary Lightness Talisman*, followed by his only *Intermediate Earth Armor Talisman*. He then used a *Primary Vanishing Talisman* to disappear from sight.  

He knew the invisibility effect would barely fool Qi Refining cultivators, especially late-stage ones. But at this critical moment, even the slightest survival advantage was worth pursuing.
