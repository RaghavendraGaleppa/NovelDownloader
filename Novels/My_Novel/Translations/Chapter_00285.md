# Chapter 285: Riding the Crane to Ask of the West, Heavy Pupil Enhancement, and the Second Turbid Garment?

The true name of the precious pill was "Riding the Crane to Ask of the West Pill," also known as "Nurturing Crane to Extend Life Pill." It possessed various miraculous effects such as strengthening the body, increasing lifespan, understanding crane language, brightening the eyes, enhancing comprehension, and controlling strength. Legend had it that the pure yang scholar, Lu Dongzhi, loved cranes from a young age, enjoyed raising them, and rode them to gallop across heaven and earth.

In the pond and lake areas deep in the mountains beside the tomb, one could see white cranes stepping on clouds and rosy clouds, with thousands of cranes inhabiting the area. This was specifically left behind by Lu Dongzhi, allowing him to抚鹤 (fondle cranes) and sleep eternally, expressing his elegance and freedom.

When the precious pill entered his stomach, the perfected [Consumption] skill took effect, increasing its benefits and reducing its drawbacks.

Li Xian felt a warm and cozy sensation in his abdomen, with the medicinal power flowing thread by thread, nourishing his flesh and bones. His whole body felt both cool and hot, with the sound of cranes chirping lingering by his ears. His thoughts seemed to fly on a crane, and his comprehension gradually increased.

[You consumed the Riding the Crane to Ask of the West Pill, Consumption skill proficiency +596]

[Your artistic conception is extraordinary, you comprehend heaven and earth, and the digestion of refined food is accelerated.]

The sound of thousands of cranes chirping lingered by his ears. At first, he didn't understand their meaning, thinking they were just the cries of birds and beasts, crisp and ethereal. Gradually, his heart sensed something, and he began to understand the true meaning of the crane cries, communicating with the crane spirit without obstruction.

The sound of the crane cries gradually faded.

His consciousness followed the pill's effects, traveling through every part of his body. It combed through his bones, meridians, flesh, and skin... Li Xian practiced "Iron Copper Body" and "Gang Thunder Finger," possessing "Perfect Physique," "Heavy Pupil Physique," and many other martial arts and characteristics, all of which could add pure power to his physical body.

This was naturally joyous, but he feared it might lose its refinement.

Li Xian's body was flawless, his immortal appearance and divine countenance rare in the world. With the加持 (blessing) of [Perfect Physique], his control over strength had already become refined. Now, with the enhancement of the precious pill's medicinal power, on top of refinement, it became even more refined, like adding flowers to embroidery or wings to a tiger. He could peel his strength into threads, controlling it as finely as a single hair.

He could施展 (施展) it freely and effortlessly, moving with ease, and treating the light as heavy.

『Riding the Crane to Ask of the West Pill』 belonged to the category of rare treasures and strange pills, its medicinal power originally being rare and strange. Having been stored for thousands of years, its medicinal power was inevitably lost. Li Xian's [Consumption] strengthened it, replenishing its medicinal power, making it several times stronger than before!

The medicinal power surged like a rising tide, one wave not yet receding before another rose. Its wonderful effects were truly terrifying. When Li Xian raised his eyes, his gaze was bright, and his eyesight increased dramatically. He focused his gaze to see through things, passing through the room's walls, passing through the courtyard's stone walls, and could see the pedestrians on the street.

The distance of his vision shortened, and his gaze fell back into the courtyard. He saw Nangong Liuli standing there in a daze. The gentle breeze brushed past, her hair lightly fluttering, and the tassel on her waist swayed slightly. Then, through her thin clothing, he saw the scenery inside.

Li Xian shifted his gaze away and lightly coughed twice, thinking that since they were cooperating sincerely and had made three agreements, if she wanted a closer look, there was no need to be so sneaky about it. He looked elsewhere again; the透视 (x-ray vision) of his Heavy Pupil consumed a lot of eyesight, but this enhancement had a significant effect.

His x-ray vision, observation, and intimidation... all were enhanced. When he focused his spirit, the surroundings seemed to freeze. Countless details flowed into his mind like water flowing to a low place. With a light sweep of his eyes, the flapping of mosquitoes' wings, ants returning to their nests, and cracks in tree trunks... all were seen clearly.

He could control it freely, seeing both near and far.

All kinds of wonderful effects were added to his body.

Li Xian felt comfortable all over, and suddenly felt the essence in his body being quickly digested. In that instant, dozens of threads had been digested, his physical body approaching the state of nature, and his strength becoming increasingly powerful.

[Shaping the Bone Embryo]

[Description: Ethereal fairy sounds, three flowers gathering at the crown, a turbid garment draped over the body...]

He had a vague, strange feeling that his body was about to show signs of another change. Nangong Liuli had told him that on the path of martial arts, one needs to accumulate a foundation in fine details and solidify the foundation. The more prestigious the aristocratic family, the stricter the requirements.

Nangong Liuli came from an aristocratic family, her knowledge was both broad and sharp. Although she might not be as versatile as Wen Caishang, her understanding of martial arts principles and systems was quite profound. She was naturally intelligent and wise, and also benefited from her family's heritage, with countless ancestral masters passing down their knowledge through generations.

Li Xian was not ashamed to ask for advice.

The scorching sun hung high in the sky, and the damp moisture from last night was baked dry. Nangong Liuli saw the yellow mud in the courtyard was messy and dirty, so she asked Li Xian to buy some flowers and plants to plant. Li Xian nodded and agreed; if he had any money left, arranging the courtyard scenery was indeed important.

Li Xian digested the medicinal effects and felt an unbearable hunger; he needed to find something to eat. However, he had only half a tael of money left and didn't want to waste it. Suddenly, he saw a fruit tree in the courtyard, with lush green leaves and fragrant red fruits.

He lightly leaped up, stepped on a branch, covered himself with pure Gang Qi, and picked seven or eight fruits, some green and some red. The red fruits were very sweet and fully ripe, while the green ones were slightly astringent but still edible. He used them as his lunch. He cooked a pot of fruit soup; although there was no meat, the taste was fresh and sweet, and it was quite delicious.

At the table, Li Xian inquired about Nangong Liuli's family affairs, martial arts masters in the Jianghu, secrets of grudges and enmities, and the winds and clouds of the imperial court... Nangong Liuli couldn't say much in a short time. She picked the aspects she was more familiar with and spoke in detail.

Li Xian thought that if he kept asking about other people's family secrets, it would seem like he had ulterior motives. Although he was curious, he didn't want to offend anyone. So he let the casual conversation flow freely, and they chatted without restraint.

After eating and drinking his fill.

Li Xian remembered the three agreements: sincere cooperation, seeking a way out together, and accumulating strength. He teased with a smile, "Xiao Li, now that you are a beautiful companion, having eaten and drunk your fill, what are you going to do next?" He leaned back, looking relaxed, observing Nangong Liuli's reaction.

Nangong Liuli suddenly came back to her senses. According to the three agreements, she was to perform the duties of a female companion and attend to Li Xian's daily life. Li Xian would protect her and help her find stability away from the Flower Cage Gate. If they obtained refined treasures or other items, they would appropriately share them and advance in martial arts together.

She was, after all, a noble lady from an aristocratic family. Once her hands and feet were free, she had put the matter to the back of her mind. Now that it was brought up, her pretty face turned red, and she said, "Since we have three agreements, I will naturally abide by them. I, Nangong Liuli, am not someone who goes back on her word."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Good beauty, then help me massage my legs first."

Seeing Li Xian's relaxed and carefree manner, Nangong Liuli suddenly felt indignant. To obey so乖乖ly seemed to damage her dignity. She glanced at him sideways, then suddenly had a clever idea to preserve her dignity. In the future, when she had to serve and fulfill the contract, she wouldn't have to be subservient. She said with a slightly disdainful tone, "You little thief Hua, you don't look very old, do you? How old are you this year?"

Li Xian said, "I'm twenty years old (of age to wear a cap), what about it?"

Nangong Liuli said, "In my Nangong family, the sons wear their caps at twenty-two. Are you also twenty-two? You don't look like it."

"In Yu'nan Province... the Gu family is quite famous. They consider the age of wearing a cap to be twenty-three. Different families have different customs, so the age for the capping ceremony varies. You... when others ask your age, you can't answer like that. After hearing it, they'll think you're being perfunctory and will have a bad impression of you, making future dealings inconvenient. You should state your actual age."

She spoke with a serious, lecturing demeanor.

Li Xian thought to himself, she truly is a noble lady from an aristocratic family. Aristocratic families have strict rules of etiquette; they are strictly constrained from a young age, learning about all kinds of etiquette, big and small, before studying literature and martial arts. He secretly felt he had learned something and said, "I'm eighteen years old. Why are you asking my age all of a sudden?"

Nangong Liuli's eyes immediately curved into crescents, filled with smiles. She asked again, "I think that's the lunar age, right?" She dipped her finger in her tea cup and drew circles on the table with the tea.

Li Xian nodded and said, "It is the lunar age, but that doesn't matter." On the boat on the Blue Water River, Wen Caishang's affection was hard to hide, and she had said that whether lunar or actual age didn't matter, he was already twenty and could start a family and career.

Nangong Liuli laughed and said, "How can it not matter? Since it's the lunar age, it means you're even younger."

She giggled and said, "Oh my, oh my, after all this, it turns out you're a little brother. You pretend to be so mature, but you're actually so tender. I'm twenty-one this year, three whole years older than you."

"Call me big sister."

Li Xian remained silent and suddenly felt on guard.

Nangong Liuli said, "It's only natural for an older sister to take care of a younger brother. I'll treat you as my little brother and serve you well."

Li Xian was slightly annoyed, seeing that Nangong Liuli was trying to use age to assert dominance, and said, "Who are you looking down on? Who's your little brother?" Nangong Liuli felt she had the upper hand and said轻松ly, "Why, it's you of course. You don't even have your full growth yet, pretending to be a twenty-year-old."

"You little show-off, have you no shame? Martial arts have strong and weak, age has old and young. If you were in the Nangong family, a little brother like you would have to respectfully bow and greet me as 'Cousin'. If I had some spare money and was pleased by your sweet call, I might reward you with some silver."

Nangong Liuli chuckled and said, "Little Hua brother, big sister will massage your legs for you, don't get any ideas, otherwise big sister will spank your butt." She had changed from "serving" to "taking care of," becoming even more pleased with herself.

Li Xian smiled and said, "Good sister, I've changed my mind." Nangong Liuli was startled and suddenly felt something was wrong. Li Xian smiled and said, "I have free time today, such a fine time. Since big sister is older than me, you must have more experience. So I'd like to ask my good sister to teach me something."

Nangong Liuli secretly lamented, moved her body slightly, pushed open the window, and looked at the bare courtyard scenery. "Good brother, sister... sister doesn't have anything to teach you. You're so smart, you can figure it out yourself."

Li Xian followed over, wrapped his arm around her waist, and said, "No... I know nothing about this, I'm so foolish. If you don't teach me, I'll never learn."

Nangong Liuli cried in her heart: "Nangong Liuli, Nangong Liuli... this little rascal originally just asked you to massage his legs. If you had just been sensible and helped him, it would be fine. Why did you have to bring this trouble upon yourself?"

She stammered, "Good boy, sister really can't teach you. I don't know how either. Good brother, go find someone else to teach you."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Is that so? You really don't know? Yesterday, I saw it myself. If you really hadn't learned it before, then it means you learned it without a teacher, your talent in this area is not ordinary. Teaching me would be more than enough."

Nangong Liuli's red lips pressed together, speechless. The words of rebuttal were stuck in her throat, too embarrassed to speak. She knew it was hard to avoid this matter, and she also had some desire, so she reluctantly said, "Good brother... it's not dark yet. If you really want to learn, we should wait until dark. How can we... how can we..."

She didn't finish, her modesty fleeing as she returned to the side room and lay down to sleep. But when the door was about to close, perhaps due to excessive panic, she forgot to bolt it, leaving a crack.

Li Xian, having eaten and drunk his fill, also wanted to go back to his room to rest, but in a daze, he walked into the wrong room.

Two hours later.

The inner courtyard was quiet and secluded once again.

Li Xian held the Sinking River Sword and practiced slowly. The first and second layers of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword had already reached their peak. The third layer required practicing with both Yin and Yang. Since Wen Caishang was not by his side, it was difficult to make any progress.

And so it went.

He spent several days in peace. Li Xian's temperament was steady; he honed his martial arts, worked silently, and accumulated proficiency. Nangong Liuli was fulfilling and interesting. The first few days, she was extremely shy, but now she was still quite bashful, but gradually she was becoming more understanding and enjoying it.

She was both afraid and fearful. Her waist and abdomen were sore from exhaustion, her legs and feet weak. Working together sincerely to seek a way out was indeed not easy. Having opened the floodgates, it was hard to avoid being busy around noon and at night every day.

[You digested refined treasure, proficiency +1]

His martial arts were gradually advancing. Li Xian was immersed in joy, climbing higher on the path of martial arts, and the manifestation of his characteristics became increasingly intense.

At noon this day, the flow of people on Green Ox Street was like a stream, with carriages and horses coming and going. In the small courtyard across the wall, the Five Element Flags regulated the feng shui, creating an无形 barrier. No matter how much noise or shouting was made in the courtyard, it was hard to hear from outside.

In the bedroom of the west wing room in the Green Ox Dwelling, the window was suddenly pushed open, startling the birds that were watching from the eaves, who chirped and flew back to their nests in the trees. The curtains in the room were trampled to the floor, and the tables and chairs were a bit askew.

Nangong Liuli's cheeks were slightly red. She had excellent upbringing from a young age and said, "Stinky brother, acting willfully and recklessly, pretending to be capable, you'll ruin your body sooner or later."

Li Xian said, "My body is very strong, it would be very difficult to ruin it. You, Sister Liuli, don't have that ability."

Hearing the words "Sister Liuli," Nangong Liuli couldn't help but feel even more embarrassed. She had originally relied on her age to call herself "big sister" to preserve her dignity. Who knew that the nature of things would gradually change, and this title of "big sister" made her even more annoyed.

She thought to herself that as the legitimate daughter of the Nangong family, she couldn't even deal with a young wild boy.

Li Xian came to her side and said, "Good sister, you can't bear to part with me?"

Nangong Liuli spat, "Who's your good sister? I wish you'd get out of here quickly." Li Xian said, "You're the one who brought up the age and seniority, now you're denying it yourself."

Nangong Liuli said softly, "Good brother... big sister is afraid of you now. I can't win an argument with you, I've brought a stone to smash my own feet. When we were on the flower boat, you always bullied me, and now you can still bully me. Fine... you were in such a hurry today, you must have something important to do. You should go quickly, don't let me hold you up." The embarrassed look gradually faded, mixed with a bit of tenderness.

Li Xian said, "Indeed. I'll take my leave for now, I'll come find you tonight."

Nangong Liuli got up to see him off, walking him to the bedroom door, and said softly, "Be careful. Although you've mixed in with them and gained some fame inside and outside the town. But the villains of the evil cults are unpredictable, and you've also provoked Hao Qingshe. You must be cautious. If something happens to you, it won't be easy for me either."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Don't worry."

Nangong Liuli smiled and said, "Good brother, go on." She watched Li Xian walk through the corridor and disappear around the corner. She let out a soft sigh, picked up the things on the floor: scattered books, boots, a bronze mirror, and a hairpin.

She put the scattered tables, chairs, desk, and bookcase back in their original positions. The furniture in this side room was relatively complete. The tables and chairs were made of mahogany, not easily rotten or moldy, and after being wiped clean, they looked brand new.

So even after being abandoned for several years, they could still be used.

Li Xian had left this side room for Nangong Liuli. It was originally a good intention, knowing that Nangong Liuli came from a wealthy and noble family and might be used to extravagance, so he left the best room for her. Who knew that fully furnished rooms could sometimes be quite inconvenient.

She closed the window and saw the fruit trees in the inner courtyard hanging with green vines. The gentle breeze blew, and the green vines swayed, peaceful and serene.

She hadn't noticed this before.

When the residence was desolate and abandoned, it was full of greenery and vitality, with snakes, insects, beasts, bees, mice, and centipedes all present. Li Xian had wiped out the snake dens, smashed the mice, and burned the bees... taking care of everything cleanly. He left only the fruit trees in the courtyard, and even pulled out all the weeds, leaving not a single strand, his actions decisive.

He had originally thought of leaving some grass to add some green scenery to the courtyard and increase its vitality. But the weeds were coarse in texture, their smell attracted beasts, and their roots carried insect eggs. Li Xian had cleared them all out, thinking that if he had money left in the future, he could buy some ornamental grass like "Hall Grass," "Blue Cloud Grass," "Soft Cloud Grass," etc., to carefully arrange the courtyard scenery.

Arranging the garden scenery was another big project, testing one's knowledge and taste. Nangong Liuli thought of her Fourth Uncle, who was extremely proud of his mansion's courtyard scenery. Whenever someone visited, he would take them on a tour of the residence. If someone made insightful comments on the appreciation of things, he would enthusiastically invite them to stay for a few days and make friends. Nangong Liuli had originally found it hard to understand, but now seeing the empty, dusty courtyard... she suddenly felt that managing a residence was an extremely energy-consuming task that contained the understanding of nature. It contained the understanding of the world within, the aspirations in one's heart... it could be said to be an image of the world in one's heart and the path of martial arts.

Moreover, Nangong Liuli didn't know how long she would stay here. It might be ten or twenty years without a turn for the better, or a hundred years might pass in a flash, and she might end her days here. She should take the residence seriously.

She saw a handprint on the window paper and was suddenly startled. She raised her hand to compare the size, and the scene at that time appeared in her mind. She suddenly understood how it was left, her face turned crimson, and she closed the window heavily.

She spat lightly, cursed "bad brother," and then went to tidy up elsewhere. To the southwest of the bedroom was a place for drinking tea and enjoying the scenery. There was a table and two cushions... sitting here to drink tea, one could enjoy the view of the courtyard.

The tea set was overturned, and the tea had stained the cushions.

Nangong Liuli picked them up one by one, her expression very strange. As a beautiful companion, tasks like brewing and pouring tea were naturally hers to do. But she vaguely remembered that the tea had just run out at that time.

The cushions were very wet.

Suddenly, with a "bang," the window was blown open by the wind. Nangong Liuli was startled, looked at the cushions, then glanced at the window, and thought to herself: "If someone had seen me in that state back then, that would really... really be unbearable."

She hurriedly went to close the window.

After the bedroom was cleaned up, Nangong Liuli straightened her clothes, dressed neatly, and stood quietly in the outer courtyard. She closed her eyes to clear her mind of distracting thoughts, the remaining blush on her face gradually faded, and she thought about the events of the past month. It was truly ups and downs. It was humiliating, but when it came to actual cooperation, it was also indescribably difficult. She held a wooden sword, spent a lot of effort to calm her mind, and lightly danced her sword moves in the courtyard.

The martial arts passed down in the Nangong family were vast and profound, and their martial arts manuals were extremely rich. Nangong Liuli had deeply inherited her family's legacy. Although young, she was already among the outstanding ones.

The sword technique she was performing was called "Nangong眷天 Sword" (Nangong眷天 Jian), an extremely complete set of basic sword moves. The direct descendants of the Nangong clan all had to practice it, as a standard for testing the talent of the clan's descendants.

Nangong Liuli's sword tip lightly tapped, lifting the turbid sand in the courtyard. Her sword flowers swirled, scattering the dust in all directions. Her steps were light, her figure like a fairy in the mist, suddenly thrusting east, suddenly拨 (flicking) west.

The graceful and wonderful posture in the sand mist is truly hard to describe in words. Although the Nangong眷天 Sword belongs to basic martial arts, it is known as the "Cornerstone of the Nangong Family's Martial Arts" and the "Jade Passed Down Through Generations of the Nangong Family." It is extremely exquisite, not输给 (losing to) ordinary entry-level martial arts.

It is said that the Nangong family has a sword technique called "Heaven's Luck Sword Technique." One must practice the Nangong眷天 Sword to an extremely high level, and then practice several family martial arts that are never passed down outside, before one can even hope to touch it. When the sword is unleashed, it seems to have the protection of a mysterious heaven's luck, defeating the enemy beyond expectations.

Even with casual挥洒 (flourishing), victory is already in hand.

Nangong Liuli's sword flowers were婉转 (graceful), her steps wandering in all directions. This set of "Nangong眷天 Sword" had already reached perfection. Her physique was slightly weak, and the intense cooperation just now had consumed a great deal of energy. Her waist and legs were sore and weak. After dancing a few rounds, she retracted her sword and stopped.

The sand mist, originally scattered and diffuse, with no pattern, spreading in all directions. But her sword stance was unique. When she retracted her sword, where the wooden sword passed, the sand mist seemed to be牵引 (pulled) by an invisible force, moving with the sword. At first glance, it looked like a light yellow ribbon hanging from the sword.

In a short while... all the sand mist turned into a light yellow ribbon several zhang long. Nangong Liuli's sword moved with her body, circling and turning, and the ribbon also lightly circled with her.

She suddenly flipped her wrist and retracted her sword. The ribbon聚拢 (gathered) into sand, sliding down the wooden sword and returning to the miscellaneous soil in the courtyard. But the sand that fell to the ground had become finer and smoother, different from ordinary soil.

Nangong Liuli had used "Turbid Garment Gathering" in this move. The厉害之处 (strong point) of the Nangong眷天 Sword is that its sword moves are vast and profound, and they also contain many mysteries like "Ethereal Fairy Sounds" and "Turbid Garment Draped Over the Body." When挥洒 (挥洒) the sword moves, there is great room for variation, allowing for the addition of unique characteristics. This makes the same move have different effects. As the saying goes, "No matter which way you go, it's all accessible, it's all the right path."

The "basic martial arts" of large clans are反而 (on the contrary) even more profound.

Nangong Liuli drank some tea and felt困厄 (trapped and oppressed), very bored, so she drew Five Element Diagrams to relieve her boredom. Suddenly, she felt a阴风 (yin wind) blowing, and her whole body's hair stood on end, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

She frowned, feeling uneasy, thinking: "This kind of感应 (sensing) is definitely not without reason. Could it be... that someone from the Flower Cage Gate, taking advantage of Hua Wucuo's absence, has sneaked into the Green Ox Dwelling? Hmph! If that's the case, don't blame me for being merciless." She held the wooden sword,提炁 (raised her Qi) in her chest, her steps light, and patrolled the residence once. She checked all the doors and windows of the houses.

She had suffered enough at the hands of the Flower Cage Gate and knew that their formations for capture were extremely厉害 (powerful). But single combat was not worth mentioning. Since they had潜入 (sneaked) into the residence, no matter how well hidden, they couldn't avoid her search.

However, after searching around, she found no trace of anyone. She couldn't help but frown deeply, feeling very puzzled. But since she couldn't find anyone, there was nothing she could do. She returned to the west wing room, took off her boots, and sat cross-legged to静心静气 (calm her mind and Qi).

In a flash, it was night. She pushed open the window; the sky was dark and gloomy. Last night the moon was round like a basin, but today it was covered by dark clouds.

Nangong Liuli saw the sky was dark and terrifying, as if pressing down on her head, and she vaguely sensed uneasiness. Worried about Li Xian's safety, she fumbled in the dark to light the candlestick, pacing back and forth anxiously. Suddenly, she heard two "tap tap" sounds, as if coming from the main gate.

Nangong Liuli was overjoyed and immediately hurried to the outer courtyard, about to open the door to welcome him. But when she touched the bolt, she felt it was wrong... the surroundings were extremely quiet, lifeless.

Nangong Liuli frowned and said, "Hua Wucuo, is that you?" There was no response from outside. Nangong Liuli said, "Stinky brother, if you're teasing me again, I'll get angry and won't open the door for you."

Still no response. Her pretty face turned pale with fright. She saw gray mist swirling around, a chilling aura, and an indescribable coldness. She remembered there was a pavilion in the residence, four or five zhang high, from which she could vaguely see the street scene.

She immediately climbed up to the pavilion and looked out from a high place. She saw that there was indeed a figure outside the main gate, wearing coarse linen clothes, with an extremely pale face.

It raised its hand and lightly knocked on the door. The thudding sounds seemed to beat into her heart, making her feel extremely烦躁 (agitated). Nangong Liuli's face turned completely white in an instant. At that time, the empire was about to fall into chaos, demons and monsters deceived the world, and ghosts did indeed exist.

She broke out in a cold sweat, calculating the date. It was the middle of the seventh month, when the gates of hell were wide open.

In this short moment, it became even darker.

Speaking of which, just after noon.

Li Xian turned out of Green Ox Street and looked at the tall buildings on the street. The noisy chatter wrapped around his ears, with local residents and Flower Cage Gate disciples mixed together on the street, impossible to distinguish.

He had忍痛 (endured the pain) to leave the tender embrace, all for the purpose of going to the Island Within the Island to purchase martial arts. Over the past few days, he had repeatedly reviewed his past martial arts, thinking about his own advantages, disadvantages, characteristics, and various considerations. Whether to promote his strengths, to make up for his shortcomings, or other things.

At this time, he already had the answer.
