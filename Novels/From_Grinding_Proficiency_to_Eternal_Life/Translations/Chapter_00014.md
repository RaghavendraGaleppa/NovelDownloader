# Chapter 14: A Golden Opportunity

After an unknown amount of time, Xu Yunfan looked at a system prompt that had jumped out in his vision, and joy filled his heart.

Success.

Just as expected, when he focused his attention on the attribute panel, he clearly saw a gray status reading "Linzi Jue (Not Yet Mastered)" in the Skills column.

As long as it could be added to the skill slot, mastering it was only a matter of time.

Only then did he feel his mind was exhausted, his thoughts even becoming sluggish.

Practicing this strange technique was too draining on his mental energy; he couldn't keep at it, or he would deplete his spirit.

Xu Yunfan turned over and fell into a deep sleep.

After an unknown amount of time, Xu Yunfan's eyes snapped open, his ears twitching slightly. Outside the stone house, amidst the howling cold wind, other movements could faintly be heard.

*Clang!*

A sound of metal clashing rang out, like the tolling of a great bell, exploding suddenly outside the stone house.

"Lian Yuanzhang, I knew you would come! With this net of heaven and earth, you won't escape!"

The voice sounded like a thunderclap, filled with delight and smugness.

Xu Yunfan got up and turned to see Li Haomiao's deep eyes, his expression filled with certainty.

Seeing Xu Yunfan looking over, Li Haomiao revealed a hint of a smile.

"The opportunity has come."

The people inside the stone house were all awakened by the commotion outside. Xu Yunfan could see clearly that while many were surprised by the noise outside, most seemed to have expected it.

They just didn't think it would come so quickly.

"The far north, once winter sets in, is virtually impassable. A surprise attack at this time, though rushed, is within reason," someone in the corner analyzed calmly, their eyes flashing with excitement.

The Empress had just ascended the throne and had cleaned up the court, but there was still considerable resistance below.

*Crash!*

A deafening explosion erupted as the wall of the stone house was smashed open by a man as tall as an iron tower, resembling a fierce beast. His muscles were knotted, and blue veins pulsed on his body. The heat radiating from him even raised the temperature inside the stone house by several degrees.

The burly man held a giant hammer in his hand, his eyes scanning the room before fixing on a thin youth standing silently in the corner. He grinned.

"Young Master, I've come to save you."

The thin youth, who had been silent all along, remained expressionless. He stepped out with a nod but was immediately picked up by the burly man's hand as large as a palm leaf fan before he could say anything. The burly man turned and strode away.

*Thud!*

The ground seemed to shake slightly as the burly man shot out like an arrow released from a bowstring, disappearing from the battlefield in the blink of an eye.

Looking out through the hole, one could see countless black-clad figures in iron armor fighting with the overseers. The most eye-catching were two burly men fully clad in heavy armor fighting in the center, both wielding long, heavy weapons.

The heavy weapons in their hands seemed weightless, each move and stance displaying an incomparable, overwhelming ferocity.

Every collision of their weapons was like a thunderclap on flat ground, deafening, and no one dared to approach.

The burly man wielding a long-handled Mohist saber laughed loudly.

"The Emperor早就预料到 you would come to raid the mine! Now, you won't be able to escape! Lian Yuanzhang, if you surrender now, I can put in a good word for you before the Emperor. You might even be reinstated and command the Xuanwei Guard again."

Lian Yuanzhang, holding a spear as thick as an adult's wrist, parried the other's saber and let out a cold snort.

"You once served by the Emperor's side. The Emperor treated you well, yet you bow your head to that witch. Zhang Shuyang, you've disgraced the entire Zhang family."

Zhang Shuyang said, "A good bird chooses the tree to perch on, which has been true since ancient times. After the Emperor ascended, she set things right, the governance is clear, and the people live and work in peace. I should naturally bow my head."

The two said no more, their weapons dancing like shadows, clashing hard and refusing to yield an inch.

Seeing this, others dared not approach. The immense power contained in their every move meant death upon contact and injury with even a graze.

Neither Lian Yuanzhang's nor Zhang Shuyang's subordinates dared to get close to the area around them.

"Both of them have mastered the training of muscles, bones, and skin. Especially Lian Yuanzhang, he is close to the Three Unifications of the Exterior. He has integrated the strength of his muscles, bones, and skin, and is training his strength into his flesh and blood. Once he steps into the Muscle Refining Realm, Zhang Shuyang won't be able to withstand a single blow from him. Although Zhang Shuyang's martial arts realm is slightly weaker, he has a unique physique, an astonishingly strong body, and naturally possesses three parts more blood and energy than an ordinary person. For now, it's hard to tell who will win," Li Haomiao's eyes darted around as he observed carefully, then his gaze fixed as he looked at Fang Mushan, who was preparing to get up.

"A great opportunity! The situation is chaotic. Follow that Fang Mushan," Li Haomiao urged opportunistically.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate. The place was in chaos, with powerful men attacking, and the entire Ningguta was in an uproar, at least on the surface. If he missed this chance, he might never get another.

He carried Li Haomiao on his back and used the human skin sack discarded by the person in the mine shaft as a rope to secure him.

*Rip, rip.*

Watching Xu Yunfan pull the human skin sack tight to tie a knot, making a tearing sound, Li Haomiao's eye twitched, feeling a bit pained.

"Don't damage it. This might be the remains of someone beyond the Ultimate Path. It could be very useful."

Xu Yunfan didn't care. This skin sack was extremely tough, hard to cut with a sword, and had excellent elasticity. He had tried his best to tear it apart in private but couldn't. It was very suitable as a rope now.

At this time, everyone in the stone house reacted, their faces filled with excitement as they rushed out to escape. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and no one wanted to miss it.

Not far away, the slender-looking Fang Mushan also slowly moved. After a lazy stretch, he plunged into the crowd.

*Interesting.*

In the current situation, whoever acts as the spearhead will be crushed on the spot. Only by following the crowd is there a chance.

Xu Yunfan was no exception, but carrying someone made him stand out even if he tried to hide his head, drawing sidelong glances from many.

Li Haomiao: "If you abandon me, the Chaoyang One Qi Jue is gone."

"..."

It wasn't just the people from their stone house; people from other stone houses also rushed out in a dark, chaotic mass. Seeing the situation, they naturally started making a racket, then scattered in all directions, fleeing like birds.

Li Haomiao couldn't help but sigh at the sight. The vast, icy plain stretched eight hundred miles. Even if they escaped, how many could survive?

There were people who practiced martial arts, but few who had achieved anything, capable of invigorating their blood and energy.

Very few.

And in such an extremely harsh environment, with the desolate wilderness ahead and the pursuit of the mine supervisors behind.

It was difficult.

Xu Yunfan swept his gaze over the scene, looked at Fang Mushan's back, and without further hesitation, followed closely.

In the field, the fight between the black-clad men and the overseers instantly reached a fever pitch.

The black-clad men were all clad in dark iron armor, which emitted a cold, hard luster in the dim light. The armor plates clanged against each other with a crisp sound.

This iron armor not only added a sense of intimidation but also served as a solid defensive barrier.

The overseers swung their long knives and fought desperately, but every slash against the iron armor only produced a few sparks, failing to inflict substantial damage on the black-cled men.
