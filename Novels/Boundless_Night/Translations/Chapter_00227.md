## Chapter 227: Ancestors Retreat in Alarm

Cao Qianqiu was the most aggressive, wielding a potent weapon—a long spear he had obtained from the night sky above Black-White Mountain, its rusted surface etched with divine symbols. Full of confidence, he was the first to charge, aiming the spearhead at the palm-sized fragment of cloth.

"What are you doing?" an Ancestor from a certain lineage of the Esoteric Sect flicked a finger. A thick green light shot out, transforming into a resplendent green lotus. Its petals unfurled, spewing forth countless divine patterns that actually blocked the potent weapon.

Cao Qianqiu's gaze was unfriendly. The bloody great sun around his body expanded as he fully activated the divine symbols on his spear.

"Stop, old Cao!" Sun Taichu called out.

Some of the other Ancestors moved to block him, while others, like Cao Qianqiu, wanted to snatch the fragment of cloth from the altar. Instantly, the area plunged into chaos.

This small group of people, all standing at the forefront of their respective paths, could cause catastrophic consequences with a casual strike. This particular area was special: golden patterns lit up on the ground, and silver symbols intertwined in the air. Had it not been for this, the place would have long since collapsed. Even so, several coffins related to quasi-divine beings emitted faint sounds, showing signs of damage.

"Crack!"

Most alarmingly, the altar itself developed a three-inch-wide black fissure, being the first to be damaged. It was on the verge of collapsing. The Ancestor-level figures, who had been confronting each other, now froze. They watched as dozens of cracks appeared on the high platform beneath the cloth fragment, and then observed it shatter before their very eyes.

Meanwhile, in Kunling, in the region facing the Great Yu Dynasty.

Black mist surged, and rows of buildings stood tall, their ruined halls having been thoroughly cleared. The central grand palace loomed ahead, its silver tiles gleaming brightly. Purple qi and dark mist swirled together, extraordinarily dense.

The first team entered, and immediately, a surge of yin energy erupted, accompanied by sounds of fighting. Ghostly figures flickered, and half-rotted ancient beings attacked with extreme ferocity. It wasn't long before the sounds of clashing weapons weakened. Finally, only one person escaped the grand palace, but a withered, skeletal hand reached out, pierced his chest, and dug out his heart from behind. In less than fifteen minutes, the entire team was annihilated.

Qin Ming frowned. The generous reward was clearly not easy to obtain; even he felt like backing out. This cursed place seemed to lack any scriptures or ancient texts; he hadn't resonated with a single one. And that final grand palace was so dangerous. Fortunately, he hadn't been chosen for that team.

The second team was visibly nervous, with some immediately suggesting they abandon the mission. However, an elder stepped forward, reminding them of the importance of contractual integrity. This time, screams echoed continuously within the grand palace, but some managed to escape, covered in blood.

"This place must be a stronghold for ghost cultivators, guarded by core disciples. We can barely hold out for a while, but ultimately, we are no match for them." That person's body was a wreck, as if mauled by multiple fierce ghosts, nearly torn apart, with even broken, hook-like nails embedded in their flesh.

"Bring out the body-protecting golden robes and wind-traveling talismans to help the explorers survive," ordered the Fourth Princess of Da Yu, clad in crimson armor that resembled a red lotus, both eerie and mysterious. Otherwise, if they tried to select a third batch of people, many would likely resist. Knowing it was a certain death, no one would be willing to sacrifice their lives.

"You only need to ascertain what exactly is inside this grand palace." At the same time, elders stepped forward, asking them about their needs, such as suitable weapons or life-saving elixirs, showing considerable concern and care. They feared these people might become perfunctory or half-hearted in their exploration.

Indeed, this team had a high survival rate, losing only three members, with the remaining six emerging alive. However, their priority was survival, so they only discovered a pond in the very center, where purple mist merged with dark mist. Approaching even slightly caused black qi to surge skyward. Moreover, those ghost cultivators were all seated around the edge of the pond.

Qin Ming was selected for the fourth team. He queued up to receive his reward: two thousand units of Daygold, which, naturally, weren't actual gold but two gold notes. Regarding cultivation techniques, there were several. He opted for the Netherworld Sutra, discarding the Wind Manipulation Sutra and Verdant Wood Sutra. Qin Ming immediately perused it, confirming there were no issues.

He donned the body-protecting golden robe on the spot, its surface etched with countless divine patterns. He also affixed wind-traveling talismans to his legs, which could significantly boost his speed.

"Young man, do you need anything else?" an elder asked kindly.

Qin Ming naturally presented his request. "I am a divine archer. If you could give me some arrows mixed with jade-iron, that would be even better."

"Bring the arrows!"

Many people from Da Yu had arrived, proving their deep resources. Among their retinue were some carrying special arrows. Although not pure jade-iron, they were all mixed casts, but still sufficient and incredibly valuable. They gave him a quiver containing twelve dark-red arrows.

Qin Ming and his group advanced, remaining vigilant as they passed through the ruined halls. As they neared the grand palace, the chilling aura grew increasingly dense. Upon truly stepping into the grand palace, with no buildings obstructing his view, Qin Ming immediately focused his mind. A warm current surged in his eyes, allowing him to see through the heavy mist. He instantly knew what was here.

Ahead, a ten-zhang square pond, its black mist so dense it wouldn't dissipate, had condensed into a pitch-black liquid within the pond. Even from a distance, it felt bone-chillingly cold. Was this yin energy fused with Grand Yin power? He couldn't be certain what it was.

In the pond grew a plant, taller than a man, with layers of black leaves. It bore nine pitch-black flowers, wreathed in dense dark light. Divine power permeated it, yet it was also intertwined with the power of death. These flowers gave a contradictory feeling: they were full of vitality yet eerily ghostly, like an extraordinary precious medicine, but seemingly fatal if consumed. Clearly, it hadn't reached maturity yet; the flowers hadn't withered, nor had they borne fruit.

"Nine flowers, a very auspicious number. It's probably a rare precious medicine exclusive to ghost cultivators, what a pity," Qin Ming shook his head. He really wanted to take a bite, but he feared he would immediately turn into a fierce ghost.

Furthermore, purple qi swirled in the pond, and there was a black seal, fist-sized. This was definitely an invaluable exotic treasure, as countless characters swirled around it, imprinted into the void. Qin Ming stared wide-eyed. With the people of Da Yu guarding this place, this item was certainly not destined for him. He felt a bit displeased. Was there really no scripture here? It seemed he wouldn't gain any extra rewards from this trip.

"Hmm?" The tattered cloth on his person, though normally quiescent, was silently drawing the essence of the black liquid from the pond within the black mist. He nearly threw the tattered cloth away because the chilling cold, as it was absorbed, nearly froze him solid. That dense Grand Yin power surged in ceaselessly, and he could no longer resist it.

By the pond, a group of half-rotted ghost cultivators all rose and charged towards their team. After his ninth rebirth, Qin Ming had gained spirit-pupil-like abilities. To him, the place was as bright as day, while others moved through the ink-like black mist, their vision far less clear than his. Thus, when the ghostly figures approached, many had to hastily engage them.

During this time, Qin Ming continuously drew his bow. Each arrow, radiating golden light, tore through the pitch-black mist and would explode the head of a fierce ghost. Even from outside, people from the Great Yu Dynasty could see the brilliant golden light, and many were surprised.

"This young man's Heavenly Light Energy is extraordinary. Its destructive power is immense. Could he be a disciple from a renowned sect like Pure Yang Palace or Blazing Sun Hall?"

In fact, Qin Ming was very restrained. He naturally wouldn't go all out. His current Heavenly Light Energy could even incinerate spiritual light of consciousness. In the first realm, this was akin to recreating a myth.

Eventually, Qin Ming couldn't bear it any longer; his body trembled. The tattered cloth, woven from exotic metal, normally didn't display its power, but at this critical moment, it caused trouble. He felt as if he was about to be sealed in ice, about to freeze to death.

He tried to move away from there, but the tattered cloth seemed to stretch like a strand, connecting to the pond via a channel of yin energy. His expression changed. If he ran out like this, his abnormality would immediately be exposed. Finally, he gritted his teeth and threw the tattered cloth into the pond, deciding to ignore it for now.

Qin Ming exhausted his twelve arrows, killing seven ghosts and deliberately holding back, then severely injuring five more before retreating with his teammates. After multiple probes, the people of Da Yu had deduced that there must be treasures in the pond and a rare spiritual medicine. They began making elaborate arrangements, preparing to clear it a few more times before the final snatch.

Even the old men were struggling to hold back Yao Ruoxian! Her talent and cultivation were comparable to an Immortal Seed. She felt these teams were too weak. If she went in herself, even against beings of the same cultivation level, she could quickly break through and retrieve the exotic treasures.

Cao Qianqiu, Sun Taichu, and the others fell silent. Was the nine-colored high platform so fragile? It had actually been destroyed.

The fragment of cloth floated, surrounded by river-like runes that spun rapidly around it, forming a kaleidoscopic tunnel. More than a path, it was like ripples, circles upon circles of them combining, countless "rings" strung together, leading into the distance.

"Everyone, should we retreat and reseal the path we came from, or continue forward and explore?" Even the Ancestor-level figures felt uncertain.

"If we take this fragment of cloth, will this 'tunnel' instantly vanish?" someone asked, their eyes like lightning, fixed on the motionless strip of cloth.

Ultimately, some decided to press forward. They knew more about the legends of Kunling than ordinary people and wanted to investigate further. The tunnel was brightly lit, the path paved with glowing rings, each formed by a symbol rapidly rotating in a circle. The gaps between them were like fissures.

The group advanced quickly. Not long after, they reached the end of the path formed by divine rings and were transfixed by the sight before them. Outside the tunnel, the land was desolate, as if no one had stepped there for a very long time. A city stood silent in the far distance, now vaguely visible.

At this moment, the Ancestor-level figures were filled with dread. It was just a small earthen city, yet purple qi soared to the heavens from it. Corpses hung from its city walls, and the flesh and blood of legendary creatures were nailed to its city gates.

"Retreat!"

They did not want to approach. All the Ancestor-level figures quickly exited the rune-constructed tunnel.

"Should we destroy this place?" They looked at the fragment of cloth, then at the tunnel.

At the same time, they observed carefully: there were six coffins, from which wisps of golden and silver threads overflowed, providing energy to the tattered cloth and constructing the passage.

"Was what we just saw the legendary city?"
