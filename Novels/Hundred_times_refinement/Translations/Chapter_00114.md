# Chapter 64: The Substitution Ruse  

The spiritual herb mentioned in this technique was none other than the premium-grade Red Silk Grass!  

This revelation had caused every cultivator who previously obtained this technique to curse in frustration.  

To be fair, Red Silk Grass wasn’t considered particularly rare in the cultivation world. Many sects and even family-owned herb gardens cultivated it in abundance.  

But those were all low-grade specimens!  

According to the *Compendium of Herbs*, Red Silk Grass was a unique medicinal plant whose value varied drastically depending on its grade. Low-grade Red Silk Grass was the most common and ordinary herb in the cultivation world. Mid-grade Red Silk Grass, capable of refining Foundation Establishment Pills, was relatively rare. As for the premium-grade…  

It was a treasure that would drive even Core Formation experts to draw their swords and fight over it!  

Under normal circumstances, only one in ten thousand Red Silk Grass plants would yield a premium-grade specimen—and that was with exceptional luck and meticulous cultivation.  

Leaving aside whether ordinary cultivators could even possess such a rare treasure, even if someone miraculously obtained it, what fool would use premium-grade Red Silk Grass for mere disguise purposes—especially when the effect lasted only a single hour?  

Wouldn’t it be better to trade such an herb for spirit stones or other treasures?  

Precisely because of these stringent requirements, aside from the founder of the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art, none of the cultivators who later acquired this technique ever practiced it. All dismissed it as useless and abandoned it.  

"Haha!"  

Lin Xuan couldn’t help but laugh. What a fortunate coincidence! Who would have thought that premium-grade Red Silk Grass, when paired with the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art, could achieve flawless transformation?  

For others, this technique was indeed useless—practically worthless. But for him, it was different. With his purification ability, even ordinary Red Silk Grass in his hands could exhibit the effects of a premium-grade specimen.  

If this technique truly worked as miraculously as described in the jade slip, then he could finally consult the elders about his Spirit Control Technique.  

A plan formed in Lin Xuan’s mind. Calming his mind, he began studying this disguise technique.  

Though miraculous, the technique was merely supplementary and not difficult to master—it mainly involved manipulating spiritual energy. Within half a day, Lin Xuan had fully grasped it.  

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xuan first retrieved a small vial from his robes and drank a drop of the purified green liquid extracted from Red Silk Grass. Then, following the technique’s instructions, he channeled his spiritual energy and recited an incantation. A layer of white mist materialized around him, enveloping his body.  

Moments later, the mist dissipated, revealing Lin Xuan with an entirely different appearance. Originally, his features were plain—the kind that would blend into a crowd unnoticed. Now, he had the striking looks of a noble scion, with sharp brows and bright eyes.

Ye Tian.  

Lin Xuan had assumed the appearance of the demonic cultivator he had killed a month ago.  

Not just the face—his height and build were identical to Ye Tian’s as well.  

Lin Xuan had chosen this disguise because Ye Tian had been an elite disciple of the sect, granting him the privilege to seek guidance from Foundation Establishment elders at any time. Thus, Lin Xuan intended to impersonate him.  

As for whether Ye Tian’s prolonged absence would raise suspicions when Lin Xuan suddenly reappeared under his identity—this wasn’t a concern. According to the rules of the Drifting Cloud Sect, a disciple would only be listed as missing if they failed to return for two consecutive months.  

Cultivators often ventured out for extended periods when seeking breakthroughs, as inspiration was sometimes needed alongside talent and effort.  

Only a month had passed since Ye Tian’s death, so Lin Xuan’s reappearance shouldn’t arouse suspicion.  

After considering every possible scenario, Lin Xuan practiced mimicking Ye Tian’s speech—a minor technique. Since people primarily focused on appearances rather than voices, this shouldn’t pose a problem either.  

Without further delay, Lin Xuan swiftly made his way to the Elite Hall.  

The Elite Hall, as its name suggested, was a prestigious location within the sect—a place where elders imparted wisdom to the most talented disciples.  

While the instructors at the Young Eagle Pavilion were typically at the early or mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, the elders at the Elite Hall were at least late-stage experts, with some even at the peak of Foundation Establishment. Rumor had it that Sect Master Yunhe Zhenren—the only Core Formation cultivator in the sect—occasionally visited the Elite Hall to mentor promising disciples.  

The reason for such attention was simple: most of these elite disciples would eventually succeed in Foundation Establishment, becoming the sect’s future pillars.  

This rumor made Lin Xuan slightly uneasy. A Core Formation expert like the sect master could easily see through his disguise. However, upon further reflection, he relaxed. Even if Yunhe Zhenren valued nurturing talent, given his status as both sect master and a Core Formation expert, it was unlikely he visited the Elite Hall frequently—perhaps once or twice a year at most.  

If Lin Xuan happened to encounter him despite such slim odds, it would simply mean his luck had run out, and there was nothing to complain about.  

Time was of the essence. Lin Xuan stepped into the Elite Hall—a grand, sprawling structure adorned with intricate carvings and far more spacious than the Young Eagle Pavilion.  

In addition to mentoring elite disciples, many elders cultivated here regularly. Though Foundation Establishment experts could claim their own caves, personal preferences varied, and some preferred training in this hall.

"Ah, Junior Brother Ye, long time no see! What brings you here today?"  

A voice sounded from behind, accompanied by footsteps. Lin Xuan’s heart skipped a beat. The greatest risk of this venture was encountering someone familiar with Ye Tian—not because they might see through his disguise, but because he might fail to recognize them and slip up in conversation.  

Though inwardly wary, Lin Xuan maintained a calm facade as he turned around. Upon seeing the speaker, he exhaled in relief.  

Luckily, he recognized this person.  

Of course, it was only Lin Xuan who recognized him—the other party wouldn’t know this spiritless junior brother. Cultivators were pragmatic; elite disciples associated only with fellow elites.  

The man appeared to be in his late twenties, with a square-jawed face and a sturdy build.
