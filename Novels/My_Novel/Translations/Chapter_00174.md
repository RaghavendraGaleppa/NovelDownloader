# Chapter 174: Unraveling the Silkworm Garment and Cultivating a Husband

The full moon hung high in the sky, and the inner courtyard remained eternally spring-like.

The Tranquil Heart Pagoda stood tall and black, majestic and solemn. Silver moonlight bathed its structure; the side facing the moon looked as if coated in silver paint.

Li Xian heard the transmission and dared not delay. He stopped his martial arts practice and immediately went to the foot of the塔 (pagoda). Gazing from afar, the pagoda stood towering, radiating a unique aura.

Li Xian stopped at the entrance. After a moment, the Madam’s transmission came: “You may ascend the pagoda.”

The Tranquil Heart Pagoda had black bricks and red tiles, all made of extraordinary materials. It could suppress geomantic omen and stabilize the household. The Madam possessed extensive knowledge in miscellaneous subjects—geomancy and the Eight Trigrams, surveying and construction, alchemy and medicine—all of which she had touched upon, manifesting in every aspect.

Li Xian entered the pagoda. A Yin energy rushed against his face, cool and refreshing. After a few more steps, a gust of hot wind blew over. The coolness faded, replaced by dryness and irritation.

This was the marvel of the geomantic structure. The base of the pagoda was shaped like the Eight Trigrams, capable of regulating Yin and Yang. The pure wind of heaven and earth flowed into the pagoda’s body, passing through several trigrams, dividing into Yin and Yang winds, and then blowing out through the main door.

The Yin wind was light and ethereal, blowing away dust, sweat, fatigue, and distracting thoughts. The Yang wind was dry and stifling, blowing away dampness and turbid energy...

The moment one entered, the effect of regulating Yin and Yang was already at work.

Spiral stairs led upward. Inside the pagoda, it was dark all day, so dark that one could not see their own hand in front of their face. One had to rely on the railing for guidance. Li Xian walked for a long time before reaching a spacious room on the first level.

Oil lamps stood on all four sides, but they had been extinguished.

In the room, precious incense was burning. Smoke curled up from the incense burner, drifting upward. The fragrance was long-lasting and撩人心神 (stirring the mind). The surroundings were pitch black, with only the faint light of the incense burner visible.

But the light was too weak to illuminate the room.

Li Xian’s eyesight was extremely strong, allowing him to see clearly in the dark. Although it was dark here, he could see everything at a glance. He quickly saw the Madam’s figure, and his face flushed slightly.

*‘All divine arts in the world have their benefits and their drawbacks. The benefits are endless, but the drawbacks are hard to avoid. The dignified Madam... to be in such a狼狈无助 (wretched and helpless) moment?’*

Li Xian thought to himself, feeling a sense of *schadenfreude*. He was pleased to see it, yet found it incredibly seductive. He teased in his heart: *‘The Madam always stabs me with her sword. If one day I become stronger than her, I will stab her back.’*

The Silkworm Garment Jade-Correction Art was a珍宝奇功 (treasure-like divine art). It was extremely powerful and extremely strange. Practitioners of this art could have a flawless jade body and an unblemished appearance.

The more profound martial arts a warrior practices, the more mysterious they become. They dare not easily reveal them, because within the practice methods often lie weaknesses.

Wearing the Silkworm Garment, locking the acupoints of the body, practicing internally, seeking flawlessness.

This art has no fist or foot stances. It is divided into two parts. The first part is the "Silkworm Garment" chapter, which is auxiliary. The second part is the "Internal Practice" chapter, which is the essence of the art.

The so-called Silkworm Garment refers to a kind of "special rope" that binds the whole body. Because the knots are complex and dense, it looks like a silkworm cocoon, hence the name "Silkworm Garment."

The Madam sat upright, but it was hard to avoid a certain sensuality.

She was currently wearing the "Silkworm Garment." Key joints of her body—knees, elbows, wrists, ankles, and even toes and fingers—were all strictly restrained.

Up and down her body, the silkworm ropes crisscrossed complexly, knotted and fixed. It was delicate and sensual, making it impossible to move a single inch. Knowing it was difficult to escape, Madam Wen did not struggle. Hearing footsteps approaching, she opened her eyes, revealing a rare look of embarrassment.

Li Xian pretended not to notice, glancing over her briefly. He asked, "Madam... are you here?"

"It’s so late, why did you call me here?"

His voice echoed.

After a moment, Madam Wen thought: *‘Qiu Yue has betrayed me; I can only have this boy take her place.’* She said, "I am here, come over."

Li Xian followed the sound. To avoid revealing that he could see, he simply closed his eyes. He groped his way step by step, slowly getting closer.

Madam Wen said, "Stop where you are, sit down, and reach your hand over." Li Xian did as he was told, extending his hand. When he touched her skin, it felt like stroking warm jade—cool and soft.

Madam Wen originally had killing intent. Qiu Yue’s disappearance was likely a betrayal. She was secretly furious, wanting to tear Qiu Yue to pieces to vent her anger. But as Li Xian approached, his breath brushed against her nose. Her heart stirred incessantly, and the matter of Qiu Yue was thrown to the back of her mind.

Previously, when they bathed together, she had not felt shy. Now, having made a mistake, she found it hard to compose herself, unable to control herself. Instead, she felt as if she had fallen into the mortal world, with all kinds of thoughts surging. When they practiced swordplay together, feelings of intimacy had risen.

Madam Wen’s expression was calm, but her heart was already a different world: *‘Thinking that I, the dignified Madam of the Broken Sword Manor, would be seen in such a sorry state by such a young boy today. Truly, the world plays tricks on people.’* Her heart was turbulent and hard to calm.

Li Xian closed his eyes and casually felt around. He felt that the Silkworm Garment had taken root in the flesh, tightly embedded in the body. It was no wonder the Madam could not free herself. Warriors are also human. Even if they have undergone a transformation and have a long lifespan, their essence remains unchanged; they are living, breathing humans who tread the earth and touch the sky. If a warrior’s hands and feet are controlled by others, their strength is inevitably diminished.

He exclaimed in surprise, "Madam, what... what is this situation? You... how were you captured? Who dares to treat you like this? I will kill him."

Madam Wen coughed lightly. The pitch-black night covered her flushed face.

Madam Wen had prepared many explanations beforehand to maintain her dignity. But now, her words changed: "I was indeed captured. The bandit is nearby."

"The bandit will return in an instant. My life is in danger and will soon be lost. Will you run or not? If you don't run, you will be buried with me."

Li Xian said, "I will untie you, Madam, and kill the bandit."

"Hmph," Madam Wen said. "With your meager skills, you cannot untie this in a stick of incense’s time. By the time you untie it, we will both be dead."

"I won't run anyway," Li Xian said.

Madam Wen’s beautiful eyes rippled. She was very comforted and somewhat happy, yet also somewhat shy: "I allow you to run. It is human nature to flee for your life right now. I won't blame you."

Li Xian did not answer, thinking inwardly: *‘This wicked woman is still testing me.’* But he didn't know that the more she tested, the more genuine her feelings became.

If Li Xian had fled, she definitely would have blamed him. But if he didn't flee, it was hard to express her joy. She possessed stunning beauty, but her style of doing things and her temperament made her surrounded by enemies. Although there were many pursuers, they were full of deceit and calculation.

Of course, the Madam was not pitiable.

"Fine, since you won't run, then stay here and wait for death with me," Madam Wen said, seemingly caught up in the act, sounding dejected.

Li Xian thought: *‘Would it be better to say some sweet words now?’* He mustered his courage: "I would be extremely happy to die with you, Madam."

"Is that really what you think?" Madam Wen asked, her voice trembling slightly.

After waiting a moment, Madam Wen said softly, "Light the lamps on all sides. There is no bandit here."

Light returned to the pagoda. The dim firelight illuminated the surroundings clearly. Madam Wen’s face was slightly red as she said, "You do not need to ask about my current situation."

"Today, I will teach you the method of 'Wearing the Silkworm Garment' and 'Removing the Silkworm Garment'. When I go into seclusion later, I will need your help. Come closer."

Li Xian moved closer, smelling the Madam’s hair fragrance, his heart pounding. He thought to himself that this scene was seductive; it was the first time he had encountered it in two lifetimes, something others might not encounter even in a hundred lifetimes. Madam Wen had recovered her composure and said, "This Silkworm Garment restricts all my joints. Wrists, knuckles, elbows. You can observe around my body."

"More than that, touch my Lingtai acupoint."

Li Xian located the acupoint and touched it with his fingers. He found that a silkworm rope was wrapped around it. When he pressed gently, he felt a slight roughness. The silkworm rope was smooth, and the roughness indicated the location of a knot.

The knot was complex, but looking at it with the naked eye, nothing could be seen.

"There are 361 acupoints on my body, and many of them have knots. Because the material of the silkworm rope is special, the knots are extremely tiny, to the point where they are invisible to the naked eye. You are proficient in the Blue Cloud Palm. The method of channeling Qi in that palm technique is similar to the knots. You..."

"Carry me to that couch. First, untie the knots on the acupoints around my body, then help me remove the Silkworm Garment. I will tell you the steps slowly. Remember them well."

"Of course, if you run now, I can't stop you. Just like Qiu Yue."

Madam Wen said gently, "I will just consider it my bad luck, that I misjudged a person. Leave me here to starve, exhaust, and困死 (die of confinement)."

Li Xian shook his head and said, "I won't run. I am only afraid of offending you, Madam."

Both had their own schemes.

"Hmph," Madam Wen said. "You are already mine. Where is the offense? I won't hide it from you. your Canyang Shuaixue Sword and my Yin Sword are complementary sword techniques. Now that you have reached the second level, we already need to bathe together. If you happen to reach the third level in the future, it will naturally progress further. Where is the offense between you and me?"

Her speech was calm, treating matters of men and women as if they were ordinary. But her heart stirred slightly, adding a thread of sensuality.

It wasn't without any touch.

There was no wind inside the pagoda, but it wasn't stuffy.

On the couch, Madam Wen instructed the method of the "Silkworm Garment," allowing Li Xian to untie the acupoints around her body. During this, it was inevitable to make contact. With this scene, Madam Wen felt a great sense of sensuality, her eyes rippling.

Usually, Qiu Yue assisted her, so she didn't have such feelings. Until now, when had Madam Wen ever been in such a situation? Unconsciously, she had already leaned against Li Xian’s shoulder.

"What happened to me today was all seen by him. I cannot let him go no matter what. This boy possesses the Perfect Physique, the talent for the Yang Sword, and has now reached the stage of removing my Silkworm Garment."

Thinking of this, her pretty face turned red: *‘Looking at the world, those who are this close to me, besides him, there seem to be no others. Although Uncle Xiang is absolutely loyal, he is loyal but not close. Speaking of which... don't I want someone to accompany me for a long time and experience the joy of that time?’*

*‘If I cultivate him as a husband, his strength is secondary. As long as he is forever loyal, has no other thoughts, and accompanies me faithfully, serving me, that is enough.’*

Madam Wen was moved. She glanced at Li Xian, seeing him handsome and extraordinary, with heroic spirit between his brows. She secretly evaluated: *‘His appearance is already perfect, but he still needs to increase his experience and gain more composure.’* Seeing him focused on untying the acupoints, with sweat on his forehead and a slight blush on his cheeks.

"If you are tired, rest for a bit. I am not in a hurry for this moment," Madam Wen said softly.

[Skill: Removing the Silkworm Garment]
[Proficiency: 12/500 (Entry Level)]

Midnight.

Li Xian followed the Madam out of the pagoda. Madam Wen wore a white dress, graceful and elegant. The events in the pagoda seemed to have been brushed aside.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, what about Qiu Yue..."

"Xiao Xian," Madam Wen said. "You are a smart person. Do you think that Qiu Yue betrayed me and left?"

"I dare not speak recklessly," Li Xian said.

"Speak freely," Madam Wen said.

Li Xian said, "Perhaps she did. Madam, what do you think?"

"I don't think she did," Madam Wen said. "But whether she did or not, I need to ask her personally."

"Madam, have you already found out where she is?" Li Xian asked.

"Not yet," Madam Wen shook her head and raised her hand slightly. Li Xian supported her from the side. Madam Wen walked toward the bathing room and said, "Usually, the task of boiling medicinal soup was done by Qiu Yue. Now that she is missing, it falls to you."

"I will teach you today. You must remember well. Starting the day after tomorrow, you will move into the inner courtyard and live beside my room. If you have any questions about martial arts, just knock on my door and ask."

"Why the day after tomorrow?" Li Xian asked.

Madam Wen sighed and reproached him, "You are smart, yet sometimes foolish. Tomorrow, of course, you will follow me out of the manor to inquire about Qiu Yue."

"If she has any difficulties, we have been mistress and servant for many years. I should help her. You..."

"You are young and inexperienced in many matters. Fine, fine, I will teach you slowly. But... if you also run away, I will never forgive you."

Her slender finger lightly tapped Li Xian’s forehead. Soft words and sweet talk were like a sword binding his neck.
