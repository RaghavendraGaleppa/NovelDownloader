# Chapter 342: Keep Fighting!

At this point, Xu Yunfan suddenly sneered. "What a fine Master Guanshan! What a fine Five Great Sects! You used the Dao Sect as bait just to get a share of the spoils?!"

Master Guanshan replied, "This matter was initiated by your Dao Sect. We merely turned the tables to our advantage..."

A smile appeared on his face. "Old Man Biyuan's move has lured out many old monsters. Your Dao Sect will find it difficult to survive this calamity. You are truly digging your own grave! To be blunt, your Dao Sect is currently surrounded by the Three Temples and Nine Gates on all sides. Even if Biyuan has abilities that touch the heavens..."

Xu Yunfan's heart sank slightly. He knew the situation was dangerous, but he hadn't expected it to be this severe.

No wonder. No wonder Biyuan had told him that the entire hope of the Dao Sect rested on his shoulders, and he hoped he wouldn't disappoint them.

If Xu Yunfan had failed in the Imperial Capital, the Dao Sect would have been destroyed in an instant. If he had succeeded in the Imperial Capital and stepped into the Imperial Court through the martial arts examination, the Dao Sect would naturally have taken a step forward.

Was Biyuan really such a gambler?!

Xu Yunfan was inwardly shocked and dared not be careless.

"Nonsense!"

Xu Yunfan roared, interrupting him as the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace slammed down.

"If my Dao Sect dared to send me into the Ninth Realm with the power of the entire sect, we never intended to leave you a way to retreat!"

Before Xu Yunfan's roar had faded, the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, carrying the Ten Extremes True Qi, slammed down ferociously.

The mace's body flared with crimson flames, and the dragon relief sculptures seemed to come alive, transforming into a fire dragon that roared and pounced toward Master Guanshan.

The air was scorched and distorted, and the blue bricks on the ground cracked inch by inch, shattering into countless pieces of stone.

Master Guanshan's expression changed drastically. The Three Thousand White Silk Horsetail Whisk in his hand transformed into a Vajra Spear to hastily meet the attack. The moment the spear and mace collided, the Dragon and Tiger True Qi and the scarlet dragon flame crashed together, exploding into a visible shockwave.

Master Guanshan groaned, retreating seven steps in succession. With each step, he left a footprint half a foot deep in the ground, and a trickle of blood leaked from the corner of his mouth. The Vajra Spear formed by his whisk trembled with a buzzing sound, and several of the whisk's hairs had actually been snapped.

"What overbearing true qi, capable of manifesting all kinds of true nature!" Master Guanshan's expression shifted不定, then he reacted. "The Ten Extremes Martial Way of the Heaven's Sword, Lone Nine?!"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. "Master Guanshan is quite knowledgeable, to even know of the Ten Extremes Martial Way."

"Heh, that madman Lone Nine wanted to fuse a hundred scriptures into one, nearly killing himself in the process. I didn't expect you to have actually mastered it."

Master Guanshan took a light breath, his left hand forming a seal to activate the Xuanzhen Dragon and Tiger Secret Technique. Nine talismanic golden runes appeared around him, forming a barrier to protect his body.

This was the foundation of the Xuanzhen Sect. With the spiritual energy of heaven and earth reappearing, it finally displayed a fraction of its might.

However, Xu Yunfan's attack was like a furious tidal wave, the second mace strike following immediately.

This strike was without any flourish, purely using the Mixed Origin True Seed to activate the Dragon Fall Eight Wastes Mace Technique. The special effect of 'Dragon Falling in the Eight Wastes' made the mace's force as heavy as a thousand jun. Master Guanshan's golden rune barrier shattered like glass.

"Crack!"

Master Guanshan's whisk finally could not bear the burden, its three thousand hairs snapping one by one.

Master Guanshan's Dao crown was blown away by the shockwave, his white hair scattering like a madman.

He stumbled and crashed into the screen wall behind him, the Daoist robe on his chest burned into a blackened hole by the scarlet flames, revealing a starlight-glimmering soft armor underneath.

Xu Yunfan's eyes twitched slightly. The Great Zhou's six top sects were truly too wealthy; the Ninth Realm Qi Condensation experts who ran out basically all had divine weapon armor to protect them.

This Starry Sky Silkworm Armor, he vaguely remembered, was a Seventh Rank Divine Armor forged by the Divine Weapon Ridge for the Xuanzhen Sect.

"Star纹钢 mixed with Sky Silkworm Silk? The Divine Weapon Ridge actually gave up its bottom-line treasure?"

Master Guanshan lowered his eyelids and said calmly, "Do you think, who was it that held a divine weapon and smashed the Divine Weapon Ridge to ruins back then?"

"Trying to make me angry?"

Xu Yunfan sneered, the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace spinning in the air, the third mace strike aiming directly at Master Guanshan's Heavenly Spirit Cover. "I want to see just how many hits this turtle shell can take!"

Master Guanshan's eyes showed caution, and the Dragon and Tiger True Qi around him evolved into a dragon and a tiger protecting his body.

The force of Xu Yunfan's heavy mace strikes was simply too terrifying; two strikes had shattered his Seventh Rank Divine Weapon whisk.

Just as he was about to execute the Xuanzhen Secret Martial Technique, he suddenly heard a earth-shaking, wild laugh coming from the sky: "Master Guanshan, you old Daoist, I didn't expect you to end up like this!"

The sound was like thunderclap. A black shadow dove down from the clouds.

The man was shirtless, his muscles knotted like cast refined iron, his right arm tattooed with a Nine Suns totem. Before his fist wind arrived, it had already sucked the air within a hundred zhang into a vacuum.

Xu Yunfan's Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace was actually knocked three inches off course by this punch, the mace tip grazing past Master Guanshan's ear and pulverizing half a pavilion.

"'Blazing Sun Venerate' Chu Sheng of the Nine Suns Sect!"

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted, feeling his虎口 go numb.

The newcomer was none other than Chu Sheng, the strongest Ninth Realm Qi Condensation Grandmaster of the current Nine Suns Sect. A supreme body-refining expert known for training his body to withstand divine weapons through the Great Sun Glazed Body, he was extremely famous throughout the Great Zhou.

When Chu Sheng landed, it was like a meteor strike, the blue stone ground collapsing into a spider-web-like giant crater. He twisted his neck, the joints popping like frying beans. "Old man Biyuan used the Dragon Vein's Xuanhuang Qi to send you into the Ninth Realm, but in the end, it's just a flashy trick."

"Flashy trick?"

Xu Yunfan grinned, having to withdraw the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace. He couldn't kill Master Guanshan with this mace strike and had to pull back.

These experts from the great sects were at least a level above ordinary Ninth Realm Qi Condensation practitioners.

"I'm talking about you!"

As Chu Sheng spoke, he suddenly threw a punch at Xu Yunfan's face. True Qi surged violently from his fist, and the Nine Suns totem on his arm lit up one by one. "Let me show you what a true Ninth Realm physique is!"

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. The Ten Extremes True Qi activated from the soles of his feet, and his body slid back ten zhang like a slippery fish.

The spot where he had been standing was blasted into a three-zhang-deep pit by the fist force, and the flying stones actually ignited into golden flames in mid-air.

This was the 'Melting Gold and Iron' special effect achieved when the Nine Suns Sect's foundational supreme skill, the Great Sun Glazed Body, was cultivated to its peak.

Wherever the fist wind reached, gold and stone turned to ash! Chu Sheng's pores喷射出 golden aura, the Nine Suns totem flowing beneath his skin like molten lava, every inch of his flesh and blood tempered to be comparable to a Seventh Rank Divine Weapon.

Even more terrifying was that he had already cultivated the Nine Suns Qi Devouring Technique to the 'Qi Devouring Mountains and Rivers' realm. With a single breath, he could drain the spiritual energy of heaven and earth within a hundred zhang. His blood energy was like a great sun furnace, and his true Qi was as vast as a surging river.

An ordinary Ninth Realm martial artist facing him in battle would lose three-tenths of their courage before even fighting!

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged as he said calmly, "Why does Sect Master Chu come here to join the fun instead of抢夺 the mountain gate occupied by the Great Gan?"

"Killing you is more cost-effective. Perhaps I can also enter the Land of Earthly Immortals. Do you think you can escape?"

Chu Sheng sneered, his fists colliding to emit a dazzling spark.

His pores喷射出 golden aura, and he transformed into a humanoid sun, pouncing over.

Xu Yunfan had nowhere to dodge. He crossed the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace in front of his chest. The moment the dragon patterns on the mace met the opponent's fist, a piercing, harsh sound of metal clashing rang out.
