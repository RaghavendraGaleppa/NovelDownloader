Chapter 12: Teaching Martial Arts, Practicing Moves and Strength

In front of the estate's guard courtyard, on an open patch of ground.

Hundreds of guards gathered here. Pang Long stood at the front, counting the numbers. Confirming no one was missing, he said indifferently:

"Today's morning training starts with three laps around the estate. Be energetic, loosen up your muscles and bones."

"The path of martial arts has no shortcuts. It is most taboo to be overly ambitious."

"If you lot can grasp some essence in your moves and strength, that would be considered quite an achievement."

With Pang Long's words falling, the morning training for the day began.

Li Xian mixed into the crowd, ran out of the estate gate, circled the estate, and picked up his pace, his speed changing from slow to fast.

The laboring servants who had started work early looked on with envy as the group of guards passed.

The One Union Estate was larger than imagined, surrounded by high mountains and rivers. Running around the estate required crossing several winding mountain paths.

Suddenly...

[Tech: Running]

[Mastery: 120/500 Beginner]

[Description: Just a matter of moving the legs and swinging the arms. It strengthens the body and builds the constitution. Why not do it?]

[Mastery +1]

[Mastery +1]

With every step Li Xian took and every arm he swung, the sound of gain rang out.

His breathing became increasingly steady, and his speed subtly increased.

After three laps, the sky was fully bright.

Tech [Running], Mastery has reached [251].

"Fourth Brother, quite the stamina. You aren't even exhausted."

Zhao Han gasped for breath, slightly surprised. Three laps around the estate, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, was no simple feat.

Moreover, the group ran at a decent pace. For a newcomer to keep up with the team was already considered impressive.

"Not bad." Li Xian wiped the sweat from his forehead. He couldn't say he wasn't tired, only that he could still hold on.

"Save some energy. Later, Commander Pang will likely call you over separately to teach you a martial art."

Zhao Han reminded him, pointing in Pang Long's direction.

Just as expected, Pang Long's gaze swept over the guards. When he saw Li Xian, he was clearly startled. In just half a day, the change was so great. He didn't expect the former little servant to look quite decent.

If not for the fact that among the guards, he was the only unfamiliar face, he wouldn't have recognized him.

"Li Xian, come here."

Pang Long beckoned.

Li Xian hurried over. "Commander Pang."

"I had urgent business yesterday and didn't teach you martial arts." Pang Long stood with his hands behind his back and said, "Before teaching you martial arts, I need to solemnly tell you one thing."

"The martial path we practice was all created by the Madam. To learn this martial path, you must regard the Madam as heaven and never defy her. If you disobey, you will be like this bamboo."

He struck out with a palm, hitting a bamboo stalk in the air.

Just a "crack" was heard, and the bamboo snapped in half.

Sounds of astonishment came from the guards:

"Commander Pang's Empty Air Palm, its power is becoming even more formidable."

"Alas, I wonder when we will reach Commander Pang's level."

"I'm afraid it's difficult. If I could have one-tenth or one-twentieth of his skill, I would be content."

Li Xian's eyes shook:

"Splitting bamboo from a distance... this strength is already very formidable."

"Yet yesterday, when I asked him, 'Is there a way to reach the ten-mile mark?', he answered, 'Harder than ascending to the heavens.' This means there is a way within the estate, and that is the Estate Madam."

"And even Pang Long couldn't obtain that way. Hence the sigh, 'Harder than ascending to the heavens.' This means... splitting bamboo from a distance is already quite powerful."

"But in the eyes of experts, it seems they haven't even touched the threshold."

"The martial path of this world is truly mysterious; it's hard to see its true face."

In an instant, his thoughts flashed rapidly.

"Did you remember?" Pang Long asked indifferently.

"I remember."

Li Xian nodded. Without sufficient strength, he could only follow the rules.

"Good. I see you have a foundation in boxing. I will teach you a boxing art first. Take it and study it carefully."

"Do not be lazy. Do not think that becoming a guard means you can be carefree."

"According to estate rules, if you do not meet my expectations in fifteen days, I will kick you out of the guards and send you back to being a servant."

Pang Long warned strictly.

Li Xian said: "I will not disappoint Commander Pang's expectations."

Pang Long's expression softened. "Watch closely." He leaped up.

He jumped into the crowd, opened his limbs, let out a low shout, and threw a punch. It looked plain and unadorned, but actually concealed killing intent.

He finished seventeen punches in a row. The wind of his fists swept in all directions, hitting left while aiming right, hitting front while aiming back.

Pang Long retracted his breath and stood still. "I know you yearn for that level."

"But from now on, there is no need to hold such extravagant hopes. Focus on practicing your moves and strength well; that is enough for us to use for a lifetime."

"Moves are the means to deal with enemies; strength is the foundation of a martial artist. These two are the cornerstones of any martial path."

"However, regarding strength, without ten or eight years, you can't achieve anything remarkable. For this point, I will not demand it for now."

"As long as within these fifteen days, you practice this 'Four Directions Fist' moves and mantras to proficiency and recite them fluently. And understand the major principles."

Li Xian nodded. Regardless, being able to learn martial arts was good. And Pang Long had hinted to him secretly.

When he said the words "any martial path," he intentionally加重了语气 (added weight to his tone).

The meaning was to remind Li Xian not to be overly ambitious and look down on these. This seemingly ordinary thing is actually key!

Pang Long threw the handwritten copy of "Four Directions Fist" to Li Xian and turned to the crowd, shouting:

"Where is Luo Tongyun?"

"Commander Pang, I am here."

A yin-soft man walked out, cupping his fists in response.

Pang Long said: "You have quite unique insights in the Four Directions Fist."

"The task of teaching him the fist falls on you."

Luo Tongyun gave Li Xian a gentle smile and replied: "Rest assured, Commander Pang, I will spare no effort in teaching."

"Mm." Pang Long nodded lightly. "Alright, you all should go practice your martial arts."

"Brother Li, the Four Directions Fist emphasizes square within round. It seems rigid, but actually hides smoothness."

"I will demonstrate it once. Remember the routine."

Luo Tongyun said with a smile.

In front of Li Xian, he performed the Four Directions Fist once.

Li Xian imitated the cat drawing a tiger, learning the footwork and fist path, and followed along to practice once.

Learning a complete fist art for the first time, he felt somewhat awkward. But after practicing a few more times, he gradually found the trick.

"Good, Brother Li, you have great comprehension. With diligent practice, mastering the fist art won't be difficult." Luo Tongyun nodded.

In a flash, it was noon.

Luo Tongyun said: "Brother Li, practice on your own. I have patrol duty this afternoon. I will teach you again tomorrow."

"Alright, thank you, Brother Luo, for your guidance."

Li Xian said gratefully.

After Luo Tongyun left, Li Xian continued to practice the fist over and over again. Before, he had to practice secretly. Now that he could do it openly, he naturally cherished it.

The枯燥 (monotonous) training, to him, had a unique charm.

Every time he threw a punch, he would compare it to the fist manual. Only when he thought he had memorized the fist path did he put down the manual and practice freely with open arms and legs.

"Bang!"

Having eaten a full meal, his strength was naturally abundant. His punches carried a wind of force.

"That desperate struggle back then was the right decision. Although guards are also servants, the atmosphere for practicing martial arts is much better!"

Li Xian thought to himself.

Half an hour later.

[You punched steadily, gradually grasping the method of practicing the Four Directions Fist.]

[Four Directions Fist]

[Mastery: 13/500 Beginner]

[Description: Stable and steady, a basic fist art. Outer square, inner round. Appears honest but is cunning. Easy to master, difficult to excel.]

When "Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence" was activated, progress could henceforth be seen.

"As long as I am willing to work hard, it is not impossible to master the Four Directions Fist."

"Currently a guard, I must strive to practice this fist art to the best!"

Li Xian was full of strength in his heart.

Guards also have labor; they are also servants. They do not eat, sleep, and practice martial arts all day.

The lower the rank of the guard, the more time spent on labor and handling trivial matters. The higher the rank, the more relaxed it is.

Generally speaking.

They get up at the third quarter of the Mao hour (around 5:45 AM), start morning training, and from the third quarter of the Chen hour (around 8:45 AM), they start doing various tasks one after another.

Because Li Xian was still a newcomer, for these fifteen days, he only needed to focus on practicing martial arts. After fifteen days, he would start taking shifts, checking attendance, patrolling, and all sorts of trivial matters would come looking for him.

He wouldn't have this atmosphere of practicing martial arts then.

The other guards had all gone on patrol, leaving him alone to practice the fist.

Every time he threw a punch, sweat would splash several feet. The momentum of the fist was brewing here.

"Martial artists practice moves and practice strength... if these two points are done well, one can be considered a secular expert."

"I will not think about those matters of longevity and transcendence for now. I will focus on practicing the current martial path well!"

With a clear goal in his heart, everything has more hope.

Luo Tongyun was on patrol duty.

Suddenly, he was stopped by the servant steward Luo Fang. Luo Fang smiled and said: "Brother Luo Tongyun, long time no see. Would you like to come inside for a sit?"
