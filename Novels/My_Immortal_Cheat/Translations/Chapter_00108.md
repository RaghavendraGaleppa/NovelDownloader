# Chapter 108: The Return of the Gods

In Cythera City:

The Ashfall Spear, which had been confronting Ming Ye, suddenly vanished. Ming Ye showed no surprise, his gaze sweeping over the surrounding ruins with an unreadable expression.

Bohr approached Ming Ye and asked, "Holy Emissary, why did you stop the pursuit? Those..."

"Are you questioning me?" Ming Ye's clear, bright eyes fixed on Bohr. Though his tone was flat, it carried an inexplicable pressure.

"I wouldn't dare," Bohr lowered his head.

"They are but a group of ants; if they flee, let them. What's most important now is preparing for the arrival of the lower-ranking Holy Emissary. That one is highly trusted by my Lord; no accidents can be allowed. If I had pursued them, our defenses would be exposed, and I might have been trapped. What if something unexpected happened?" Ming Ye's countenance remained pristine and calm.

"The Holy Emissary speaks truth," Bohr kept his head bowed, his peripheral vision catching sight of the collapsed buildings and dead believers nearby.

Ming Ye said no more. Light emanated from his body, and the Pontiff of the Sacred God Sect reappeared. He sighed, said little, and entered the well-protected central cathedral.

...

"How impressive, truly impressive," Zhou Tian said perfunctorily, eyeing the broken spearhead. "Are you all continuing with us, or...?"

Anduin put away the Ashfall Spear, seemingly oblivious to Zhou Tian's dismissiveness, and asked.

"We have other matters, so we won't be joining you," Zhou Tian would have to be out of his mind to follow such a religious organization.

Zhang Yi and Mu Su also nodded.

"Very well. You are friends of my Ashfall Sect. If anything ever arises in the future, my Ashfall Sect will certainly not refuse to help!" Anduin stated solemnly.

"Great!" Zhou Tian accepted without hesitation.

"..." *I was just saying it; you actually took it seriously?* Anduin nearly hurled a fireball at Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian understood his meaning, but he simply wanted to tease this show-off.

The trio said no more and turned to leave. Anduin's eyes flickered as he watched their retreating figures. "Gentlemen!"

Zhou Tian and his companions paused, turning to look at Anduin. Runes appeared beneath Zhang Yi's feet, connecting with heaven and earth, energy surging. *Was Anduin planning to attack them?*

"Rest assured, I know you two are of extraordinary origin, and I do not intend to fight. I have some information I wish to impart to you." Anduin gestured, indicating he bore no ill will.

"Information?" The trio exchanged glances, unsure of what Anduin was truly up to.

"Tell us."

"Do you know why I was captured?" Anduin's face showed a complex expression.

"Get to the point," Zhou Tian quickly cut off Anduin's impending trip down memory lane. *Why was he captured? We're not interested. At most, that woman, the Pontiff of the Sacred God Sect, seduced you and then captured you through various means. How much more outrageous could it be? I know you have a story, but I don't want to hear it.*

Anduin was choked, unsure what to say. After a moment of silence, he continued, "The gods are returning. You heard what the phantom of the Father God I summoned today said." Anduin went straight to the point, afraid of being interrupted by Zhou Tian again. "I've always wondered why my divine blood awakened. Now I know: the gods are returning, drawing closer to us, and the divine blood is beginning to boil."

"And then?" Zhou Tian asked. *The gods are returning, I know. I've even seen them. So what? What are you trying to say?*

"There's good and bad in this," Anduin said with a complex tone.

*I didn't see that coming, little brother. You have quite the ambition. Good and bad? Interesting.* Zhou Tian seemed to reassess him, scrutinizing him from head to toe. *The Pontiff of the Sacred God Sect is not honest, and you, this God Child, are also not simple. From this, one can deduce that the high-ranking members of the remaining sects probably all have their own agendas.*

"I merely wished to offer you a warning," Zhou Tian said with a smile. "Then many thanks, Your Highness God Child. We'll take our leave now."

The trio turned and departed. This time, Anduin did not stop them.

After Zhou Tian and his companions disappeared, Saman approached and whispered, "Your Highness God Child, their origins are mysterious; they are likely Outsiders, and their intentions are not simple."

"I know," Anduin's eyes were deep. He took out the Ashfall Spearhead again, injecting energy into it. A blinding light erupted, and a figure appeared out of thin air.

Instantly, three bishops rushed forward, runes filling the sky, divine arts unleashed, setting up layers of seals to trap the newly appeared figure.

The person was utterly bewildered, staring at their surroundings with a terrified expression, not understanding what was happening. This was precisely the person Anduin had rescued from the Tribunal at the last moment.

"Let me see what your true origins are," Anduin murmured softly. Nearby Ashfall cultists also lowered their heads, muttering blasphemous words that poured into the person's mind. A painfully twisted expression appeared on their face, and they let out shrill screams.

...

The three, who had already distanced themselves from the Ashfall cultists' area, stopped.

"Zhang Yi, you truly owe me one this time," Zhou Tian said to Zhang Yi. It had taken a considerable effort to save him.

"I know, I know. I'll repay you later," Zhang Yi reverted to his lazy demeanor, saying carelessly.

"What do you think about this 'gods returning' business?" Zhou Tian shook his head. Expecting gratitude from Zhang Yi was impossible; in his mind, everything was simply the best arrangement.

"What's there to think? A bunch of old fogeys from the Ancient God Realm think they've accumulated enough power, so they're colluding with forces from the Star Realm to regain their lost prestige. The events in the Void Storm are just a prelude. We're just small fry; if something goes wrong, someone higher up will take care of it. Why bother caring so much?" Zhang Yi's voice was nonchalant, utterly unconcerned.

"Your summary is truly... incisive," Mu Su stared at the two of them, wide-eyed. He always felt like these two were bragging, acting as if they were incredibly formidable.

"When are we leaving? I suffered greatly in the Tribunal, and I can't contact Kyushu. My communication device seems to have been shielded by something. We can only find people ourselves. This must be the arrangement of the gods from the God Realm; the game has probably already begun. They've been preparing for a long time and believe they have a great advantage. We need to prepare early and not delay too long," Zhang Yi said, deep in thought.

"I'm not planning to leave," Zhou Tian's eyes flickered. He didn't want to go back. How great it was here, where the sky was high and birds could fly freely, where he could mess around as much as he wanted. Going back would mean many restrictions, too troublesome. Since he already knew Tian Ling was fine, he wasn't in a hurry to return.

"Are you sure?" Zhang Yi looked at him in surprise, then relieved. "That's right, you have an invincible divine ability to rely on, so you're not afraid of anything. But I can't. A mere Dharma Aspect Realm cultivator can die if they're not careful, especially at this juncture."

"It's good that you're going back. Otherwise, I'd have to bother looking after you," Zhou Tian nodded, deeply convinced.
