# Chapter 42: Expansion Concluded! Harvest Summary! (3/3)

Lin Yun exhaled a long breath, organizing his somewhat scattered thoughts.

The Profound Heaven Five Elements Art had numerous benefits but only two limitations.  

First, the practitioner must possess five spiritual roots. This single condition alone barred the majority of cultivators in the world from practicing this technique. But for Lin Yun, it was a perfect match—what could be more tailor-made? He had been fretting over the lack of such a cultivation method.  

Second, it required an enormous amount of resources. While the manual repeatedly emphasized the slow progress of cultivation, Lin Yun believed the sluggish speed was solely due to the excessive resources needed—especially during the stage of cultivating the five elemental avatars.  

"I wonder if my Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light can accelerate the cultivation of the avatars. If it works, then this technique was practically made for me," Lin Yun mused.  

"Should I give it a try? After all, I'm only at the Qi Condensation stage now. If the True Light proves ineffective by the Foundation Establishment stage, I can always switch to another technique. The foundational Qi Condensation techniques won't affect anything. Besides, having gone to such lengths to obtain this manual, how could I, as a five-spiritual-root cultivator, not give it a shot?"  

After some deliberation, Lin Yun decided to proceed. The next opening of the Bloody Forbidden Land was still about two and a half years away.  

Once resolved, he threw himself into cultivating the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art.  

In addition to this, Lin Yun also began practicing the body-refining technique, the Vajra Art, and the divine sense secret art, the Great Development Art. On top of that, he continued drawing and selling talismans—truly swamped with work.  

Six months later, Lin Yun surveyed the dozens of disciples gathered at his stall and shook his head. "It seems this is about it. The Yellow Maple Valley Friendship Expansion Plan is complete."  

He packed up the remaining talismans and announced, "Fellow disciples, it appears everyone in Yellow Maple Valley has used up their eligibility. Those who were meant to receive talismans have done so. From now on, there's no need to come anymore. I won't be returning either."  

"The path of cultivation is long and uncertain. May we all take care of ourselves. Farewell!"  

"Senior Brother Lin, take care!" the disciples chorused. Regardless of Lin Yun's true motives, they had undeniably benefited—over a thousand high-grade primary talismans. Who else would give such gifts away for free?  

Only Senior Brother Lin!  

This Yellow Maple Valley Friendship Expansion Plan had connected Lin Yun with over fourteen thousand people.  

The rewards were staggering:  

- Various precious materials like Gold Essence, Silver Essence, Copper Essence, and Iron Essence.  
- Nearly four thousand top-grade magic tools (discounting minor quantities). Though these were ordinary top-grade tools averaging three hundred spirit stones each, their total value amounted to 1.2 million spirit stones!  
- Over eight thousand mid-grade magic tools, averaging one hundred spirit stones each—worth 800,000 spirit stones.  
- A dozen or so talisman treasures, valued at tens of thousands of spirit stones.  
- More than a thousand bottles of Qi Condensation-stage elixirs.  
- Miscellaneous items, including more precious materials like Gold Essence, Silver Essence, Copper Essence, and Iron Essence.  
- Special physiques like the Profound Yin Eye, a wisp of divine sense from the True Spirit Kirin, a Thunder Spiritual Root, a thunder-attribute magic treasure, and the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art—a technique from the Spirit Realm obtained from Xiang Zhili.  

All this in exchange for just over a thousand high-grade primary talismans worth merely 100,000 spirit stones. The return? Over two million spirit stones' worth of items, not even counting those that couldn't be bought with spirit stones.  

It was an overwhelming victory.  

Joining Yellow Maple Valley had undoubtedly been the right decision. Such treasures would have been impossible to obtain by befriending rogue cultivators alone. Success was deeply tied to one's environment.  

As the saying goes: *A man's worth is like a rat—it depends on where he stands.*  

With over a thousand bottles of elixirs fueling his cultivation, Lin Yun's progress in the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art soared. Moreover, his Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light proved exceptionally suited for the technique.  

Though he didn't know how fast a Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivator progressed, his speed undoubtedly surpassed it.  

From the moment he began practicing the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art, the Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth techniques advanced explosively. In less than two years, he reached the peak of Qi Condensation, completing the foundational stage.  

While dissipating and restarting his cultivation had contributed, Lin Yun attributed his rapid progress primarily to the True Light.  

Midway through, when the True Light accumulated with Chen Qiaoqian was exhausted, his speed noticeably slowed. Though elixirs kept him ahead of ordinary cultivators, the difference was stark.  

Fortunately, Chen Qiaoqian emerged from seclusion just then, replenishing his True Light and enabling him to complete the transition from the Flowing Cloud Art to the Profound Heaven Five Elements Art.  

Now at the Foundation Establishment stage, Chen Qiaoqian's contributions to the True Light had increased significantly.  

With its aid, Lin Yun not only reached peak Qi Condensation in two and a half years but also found time to practice the Vajra Art and Great Development Art.  

The Great Development Art was surprisingly straightforward. Though best suited for Foundation Establishment, Lin Yun's naturally strong soul allowed him to master the first layer at Qi Condensation. His divine sense now rivaled that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

As for the Vajra Art, with the elixirs and materials generously provided by Han Li, along with his True Light, Lin Yun completed the first two layers.  

Originally a technique for mortals in the Spirit Realm, the Vajra Art relied on dense spiritual energy for body tempering. But as a cultivator, Lin Yun bypassed this requirement.  

His speculation proved correct—Han Li had once used the True Light to skip millennia of body refinement, even while practicing the combined body-and-soul cultivation of the Brahma Sacred True Devil Art.  

Now, with two layers of the Vajra Art mastered, Lin Yun was formidable among Qi Condensation cultivators—mid-grade magic tools couldn't harm him.  

Chen Qiaoqian, having experienced it firsthand, could attest to his overwhelming strength.  

The Vajra Art had seven layers:  

- Layers 1-2: Qi Condensation  
- Layers 3-4: Foundation Establishment  
- Layers 5-6: Core Formation  
- Layer 7: Nascent Soul  

Some might assume the seventh layer could rival a late-stage Nascent Soul grand cultivator, but this was unrealistic.  

While body refiners were fearsome in close combat, a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator's advanced spells, movement techniques, magic treasures, illusions, concealment arts, and talismans made them nearly untouchable.  

No single technique guaranteed invincibility—strength was built through accumulation.  

Han Li's Brahma Sacred True Devil Art was formidable, yet he still supplemented it with the Ten Thousand Poison Mixed Origin Body, Hundred Meridians Treasure Refinement Art, Twelve Solar Terms Transformation, and more.  

In the human realm, he even practiced the Bone Tempering Art obtained from the Golden Flood Dragon King.  

True power was never achieved overnight.  

In the Spirit Realm, body refiners were renowned for their spirit tools—comparable to magic treasures, with the highest-grade ones rivaling top-tier treasures.  

For Lin Yun, who cultivated both body and soul, such limitations didn't apply. He wanted it all!  

He also pondered the differences between the Demon Subduing Art, the King of Brightness Art, and the Vajra Art.  

He deduced the Demon Subduing Art was the most complete—essentially a condensed version of the Brahma Sacred True Devil Art. The others had been altered for specific needs: the Vajra Art had to accommodate mortals, while the King of Brightness Art incorporated Buddhist practices and baleful energy.  

Only the Demon Subduing Art remained true to its origins, merely simplifying its transformations.  

Of course, this was just Lin Yun's theory. To confirm, he'd need to obtain the Demon Subduing Art from Barbarian Beard in the Chaotic Star Sea.  

"Brother Lin, you're too strong!" Chen Qiaoqian gasped, utterly defeated. "I surrender!"
