# Chapter 86: Righteous Methods for Evil Purposes

The snow-covered plateau remained bitterly cold, with icy winds occasionally lashing at Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu. As innate masters, they suppressed their qi and blood circulation, paying no mind to the harsh conditions.

Zhang Jingxiu, operating in enemy territory, deliberately restrained even his reflexive martial techniques like the Eighteen Falling Garments. His appearance had aged slightly since entering the snowy region—a deliberate concealment of his vitality to avoid unnecessary expenditure, a hallmark of having mastered the One Qi Sunrise Scripture to profound levels, similar to the Buddhist Withered Meditation technique.

"I visited this region in my youth," Zhang remarked. "Back then, the climate was much warmer, with lush pastures and even farmland like in the Central Plains. Now the population has dwindled to almost nothing—nine out of ten homes lie empty. Strangely, there are more temples now than in my younger days."

While the Great Zhou Dynasty was in turmoil, conditions in the snowy region were even worse. Herders were ruthlessly exploited, and the lives of serfs held less value than weeds.

Zhou Qing nodded. "Have you noticed? The spiritual energy here is significantly denser than elsewhere."

Zhang sensed it too. "Indeed, though the ambient energy feels tainted—similar to that giant pine on Mount Taihe but far more sinister. It's unsuitable for qi refinement."

"The Tantric sect worships and commands spirits. The abundant spiritual energy here likely stems from the deities enshrined in their temples."

Zhang scoffed. "These so-called Buddhist practitioners commit demonic deeds under religious pretense. I wouldn't be surprised if they fed ghosts and spirits with human flesh and blood."

Zhou Qing agreed wholeheartedly. The Scripture of the Slaying Tiger contained instructions for crafting a tiger-skin kasaya using human flesh to enhance its spiritual properties—clearly a method for creating evil artifacts.

The Tiger Venerable Mingwang Temple enshrined a tiger demon, with the kasaya serving as the key to controlling it. Given the lamas' inability to develop divine consciousness to weave a tiger robe, they resorted to such dark methods.

"They pervert righteous methods for evil ends—such practices can never yield true enlightenment."

As they approached the sacred Mount Snow, the golden-hued peaks under the blue sky presented a scene of divine majesty.

"Sunlight gilding the snow-capped mountains—such sacred beauty transcends the mortal realm," Zhou Qing marveled. It was ironic that such breathtaking scenery existed in a land filled with human suffering.

The mountains weren't always golden; they were often white. Zhou Qing and Zhang happened to witness this rare spectacle at the perfect moment.

At nightfall, they entered the mountains under cover of darkness. Zhou Qing's rooster companion, Maori, moved with stealth and agility, even capable of short flights.

The Tiger Venerable Mingwang Temple was mostly dark, with only a few oil lamps flickering. Zhou Qing navigated the shadows effortlessly, his perfected Shadowless Leg technique leaving no trace as his true qi nullified all sound.

Maori occasionally perched on rooftops to observe—any patrolling monk who spotted him would mistake him for an owl. Zhang employed the Taihe Sect's secret movement techniques, remaining undetectable in the darkness while maintaining telepathic awareness of Zhou Qing's position—a subtle connection that had developed naturally between the two innate masters over time.

In the living Buddha's chambers, crimson sutras floated on drapes, emitting an eerie glow as chanting reverberated through the temple like fish swimming through water. The living Buddha was the source, seated beside a skeletal figure and a fierce tiger.

As the Buddha chanted, flesh and blood vessels gradually regrew on the skeleton while he manually installed internal organs—all that remained missing was human skin. A freshly flayed hide was brought by the tiger and donned by the skeleton, which then dressed in monastic robes, fully coming to life.

"Honored guests from afar, what brings you here? Won't you come in?" The chamber doors swung open unaided, revealing two figures emerging from the darkness.

The living Buddha's eyes flickered with surprise before he greeted them politely. "So the Central Plains truly has produced two innate masters—Master Zhang of Taihe and Master Zhou of Clear Blessing Palace?"

Hurried footsteps approached as monks mobilized against the intruders.

"Living Buddha, allow me to handle Master Zhang," offered the skin-clad skeleton.

"Lama Wula?" Zhang recognized the voice with astonishment.

"I must thank you, Master Zhang, for helping me shed my mortal form and comprehend Buddhist truths, freeing me from the cycle of life and death. To express my gratitude, I invite you to join me in paradise." The skeleton was indeed the reincarnated Wula.

Suddenly, Maori streaked down like flaming lightning, his razor-sharp claws attacking Wula with blinding speed. Meanwhile, Zhou Qing struck the living Buddha's head as a venomous snake bit his neck—both strikes landing simultaneously.

The living Buddha passed peacefully without a sound. Zhou Qing then dispersed the Buddha's soul with a palm thunder strike, destroyed the tiger guardian spirit, and obliterated the skeleton's ghost—all in one fluid motion that left Zhang speechless.

"Brother, did your divine sense fail to detect Wula's ghost last time? How could you let it escape back to the snowy region?"

Zhang admitted, "I was preoccupied with Ruowang's injuries and didn't notice. Besides, how was I to know where ghosts go after death?" Despite being a Taoist priest, this was his first encounter with such phenomena.

Zhou Qing reflected that he indeed had more experience in these matters. He had encountered several posthumous spirits—the ghost fox, Squire Zhang, and Wula—while more powerful beings like the demon crane and blood python left no ghosts, possibly because they had formed inner elixirs.

The ghost fox had lacked an inner elixir, while Wula and the fox could be explained by their strong lingering attachments. Squire Zhang's case puzzled Zhou Qing, who speculated it related to imperial merit and fortune—factors that had failed Scholar Shang when the dynasty collapsed.

Regardless, Zhou Qing's palm thunder, powerful divine sense, and the Scripture of the Slaying Tiger gave him ample means to deal with such entities. Back in Jiangzhou, the great mulberry tree at his residence specialized in handling ghosts.

After disposing of the living Buddha, Zhou Qing located hidden treasures in the chamber using his enhanced senses, taking the most valuable medicinal herbs and rare artifacts. He then imitated the Buddha's voice in the local language, ordering the monks outside not to disturb him for three days.

At a secluded mountain location, they inventoried their spoils. Zhang was unnerved by Zhou Qing's professional handling of the operation.

"Brother, we've gained much, but we must clarify one thing," Zhou Qing said. "Although I came for the Formless Heart Sutra, we failed to find it while making an enemy of the powerful living Buddha. To protect my people, I had to act decisively. His death can't remain hidden forever..."

Zhang glanced at their loot and had an epiphany. "This was originally to settle my Taihe Sect's grudge. The Tantrics had a living Buddha killed thirty years ago—what's another one now? If that eunuch in the palace could do it, why can't I? I'll take full responsibility."

Zhou Qing smiled. "Actually, claiming credit might be beneficial."

Zhang disagreed. "That eunuch is dangerous. I'm not stealing your glory—I want him to think twice before targeting Taihe Mountain over the prince's affairs. News of me killing the living Buddha should deter him temporarily."

Zhou Qing chuckled. "Then this matter is settled. Let me take these ingredients to refine elixirs. Once we've strengthened ourselves further, I'll send a letter demanding the Formless Heart Sutra's return. If refused..."

"And then?"

"The sutra belongs to Clear Blessing Palace. If he won't return it, we'll have to retrieve it ourselves."

Zhang had been waiting for this declaration. His sect and the Qinghe Prince's faction were already rebels—without overthrowing the old regime, how could a new one arise? Rebellion was a life-or-death struggle with no turning back.

"By the way," Zhang added, "the living Buddha mentioned something about your spirit fowl's origins. Don't you want to investigate?"

Zhou Qing shook his head. "'The breeze stirs not, yet the cicada senses it; death comes unseen in darkness.' I suspect a trap—that's why I acted decisively. We'll note the location but visit that so-called shrine later, after refining these herbs and improving our strength."

Zhou Qing's plan was clear: absorbing these resources would elevate their group's power, enabling them to confront the palace eunuch for both the sutra and the imperial stockpile of herbs—ill-gotten gains that should be returned to the people.

This was how momentum built. With the Tantric temple's herbs and the palace's reserves, Zhou Qing anticipated significant progress in his qi refinement. The palace likely held clues to the remaining two beast skins as well.

Monster incidents nationwide also presented opportunities for physical cultivation, though the risks remained high without stronger divine awareness. Zhou Qing considered every angle carefully—dealing with the eunuch required utmost caution. Only after maximizing their strength would they attempt to persuade him to surrender the items voluntarily.

Upon their return, news of the living Buddha's death remained suppressed until Zhang publicly claimed responsibility. The Tantric sects vehemently denied it, insisting their leader had achieved rainbow body ascension through Buddhist practice, condemning Zhang's "slander."

Representatives from the Peacock Mingwang and Vajra Temples investigated but concluded the living Buddha had indeed transcended physically—though they disputed who inherited his teachings and right to succeed him.

"The Vairocana Temple supposedly has images resembling your spirit fowl," the living Buddha had mentioned earlier. "It's located beyond a perilous crevasse behind Mount Snow, accessible only by an iron chain bridge for the wisest. The temple contains just one hall with carvings."

"Thank you for the information," Zhou Qing had replied—just before striking the fatal blow.
