# Chapter 6: Qi Refinement and Body Entry

Chu Ning had already skimmed through the general contents of the Evergreen Wood Technique earlier, but now he carefully took out the booklet again to meticulously review the key points of cultivation several times.

Only after ensuring he had memorized every essential aspect of the meditation and breathing techniques did Chu Ning set the booklet aside. Closing his eyes slightly, he began sensing the presence of spiritual energy as described in the technique.

The first step from mortal to cultivator was drawing qi into the body, officially entering the Qi Refinement stage. To achieve this, one first needed to sense spiritual energy, then further distinguish the wood-attribute qi from it. Both sensing qi and drawing it into the body depended on one's innate talent—specifically, the spiritual roots. Those with higher-grade spiritual roots found this step easier.

Chu Ning possessed a four-attribute pseudo-spiritual root. Under normal circumstances, this step wouldn't come easily to him—it typically took several days. For those with poorer aptitude, ten days to half a month, or even a full month, wasn't uncommon.

Yet as Chu Ning closed his eyes and gradually calmed his mind, entering a mysterious state of concentration, he sensed the faint spiritual energy around him within moments. Among this energy, a green wood-attribute qi stood out distinctly in his perception.

"Have I already sensed spiritual energy?" Chu Ning was so surprised he nearly broke his meditative state. Fortunately, he quickly regained composure and maintained focus.

Originally planning only to sense the qi, Chu Ning now instinctively proceeded to the next step upon detecting the clear wood-attribute energy—drawing qi into his body.

Following the Evergreen Wood Technique's口诀 (mnemonic chant), Chu Ning adjusted his breathing. The ambient qi around him soon became orderly as a strand of wood-attribute energy separated from the surroundings and entered his body through his breath.

Effortlessly, Chu Ning had accomplished qi absorption. His mind now fully immersed in cultivation, he guided this strand of qi through his meridians into his dantian. The qi washed through his meridians, strengthening them, until only a faint trace remained, settling in his dantian.

The previously empty dantian now had an extremely thin wisp of qi swirling at its base. As more strands of qi continued to enter, they coalesced into a thread of spiritual power that settled in his dantian. Chu Ning's body trembled slightly as he emerged from his meditative state.

He knew his mental energy was insufficient to continue cultivating, yet he felt no frustration. The changes in his dantian were unmistakable—he had successfully refined qi into his body, reaching the first level of Qi Refinement in his very first attempt!

Glancing at the hourglass in his room, the entire process had taken merely two hours. "Even a Heavenly Spiritual Root might not surpass this. Is this the talent of the Yin Wood Spirit Body?" Chu Ning marveled inwardly.

Checking his cultivation progress in his mind:
[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Low Grade), First Layer (1/300)]
A single session had already increased his proficiency by 1 point. He knew this didn't mean the technique was easier than the Nine Yin Body Forging Art—the only explanation was his Yin Wood Spirit Body.

"This innate talent is truly formidable," Chu Ning mused. Recalling the spirit body's other ability—"wood-attribute spiritual power can conceal itself from detection and freely display strength"—he tested controlling his aura. With a thought, his Qi Refinement aura completely vanished, leaving him appearing as an ordinary mortal.

Chu Ning's eyes shone with realization—this talent was perfect for his current status as a menial disciple. Completing qi absorption in a single day would inevitably arouse suspicion, especially for a pseudo-spiritual root cultivator. "I'll observe others' progress these days and reveal my breakthrough at an appropriate time," he decided, storing the booklet before settling into restful sleep.

Perhaps due to his cultivation, despite the late hour, Chu Ning woke refreshed the next morning. Choosing not to practice the Evergreen Wood Technique again—uncertain if Cao Dongxin would summon him—he instead practiced the completed Nine Yin Body Forging Art, which could be stopped anytime. Though mastered, the art still invigorated his body.

Hearing Cao Dongxin's door creak open, Chu Ning promptly emerged. "Good morning, Senior Brother!" Despite the man's eccentric temperament, Chu Ning remained courteous—he'd be learning from him for three months.

Cao Dongxin snorted. "From now on, wake half an hour earlier to prepare breakfast." 
"Understood," Chu Ning agreed readily. "I'll start now."
"Unnecessary. We're heading to the fields now." 
Realizing Cao had likely eaten already, Chu Ning produced two pancakes—dried provisions he'd brought from Qingxi City that kept well. As Cao's expression flickered, Chu Ning offered, "Would you like one, Senior Brother?" 
Without reply, Cao strode out. Chu Ning followed, munching his pancake.

After walking a third of a mile, they reached a field of pale red grain. "Could this be spirit rice?" Chu Ning wondered, though asking the temperamental Cao seemed futile. 

To his puzzlement, Cao simply sat by the field, silent and inactive for nearly an hour. Was this deliberate obstruction of his cultivation time? 

Voices approached—the talkative senior disciple Shang Zhaoxiang arrived with Qiu Shunyi, another new disciple from yesterday. Spotting them, Shang called out playfully, "Early as always, Old Cao?"
