# Chapter 108: Jingyang Cave Mansion (Part 1)

In Jiangzhou's medicinal garden, beneath the great mulberry tree...

"Greenwood Sword, unsheathe!"

With a clear ring, the Greenwood Sword slid out from its dragon-scale vine scabbard. Within the small medicinal garden, the flying sword emitted flickering sword radiance, its trajectory as unpredictable as a spiritual bird's flight—twisting and turning without discernible pattern.

Yet even under the flying sword's pursuit, the Rooster of the Pleiades managed to dodge vigorously, never once touched by the sword's glow. 

To any innate expert observing from afar with their keen vision, the scene would resemble nothing so much as two spiritual birds engaged in an intricate aerial dance—one pursuing, the other evading with equal grace.
