# Chapter 482: Duel of Laws

As this sword was drawn, the air shrieked under the unbearable strain. A vast will to slay demons and purge evil swept through the surroundings, causing the very space to seem to twist slightly before this ultimate, evil-cleaving edge.

It was the first form of the Subduing Demon Sword Art recorded in the *True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra*.

**Purge Demons, Sweep Evil!**

The brilliant sword light, like a thunderclap from the ninth heaven, descended upon Sanzang with the force of ten thousand jun.

Before the blade even arrived, the pure and domineering sword intent had locked onto its target, determined to tear apart any "evil nature" it contained!

Faced with this fierce and unrivaled strike—enough to instantly shatter the soul of an average mid Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator—Sanzang showed no fear. Instead, a hint of compassion mixed with a gentle smile appeared on his face. He neither dodged nor evaded.

"World-Honored One, Tathagata, Universal Salvation."

A Buddhist chant rang out, gentle yet grand.

A layer of soft yet incredibly tough golden light suddenly flared around Sanzang, with the faint sounds of Sanskrit and禅 (Chan) singing appearing in the air.

The domineering Purge Demons, Sweep Evil sword light struck the golden light, producing a deafening clang like that of a great bell or massive gong!

The golden light remained completely unscathed.

Sanzang lowered his eyes.

"Benefactor, this humble monk cultivates the orthodox Buddhist light, which is pure and unblemished, compassionate to all living beings, and contains not a trace of demonic thought. No matter how sharp your evil-sweeping sword is, it might be effective against a deluded heart, but how could it harm this humble monk's bright Buddha-nature?"

Sanzang's voice remained calm, as if he were merely stating an obvious fact.

"Hmph! Nonsense!"

Xu Yunfan snorted angrily, and the True Martial sword light changed instantly.

The originally grand and vast sword intent instantly transformed into endless killing intent and the will of destruction.

Complex and mysterious Dao patterns appeared on the blade, as if condensing the karma of countless sins from the mortal world.

*I only recognize the judgment of my own heart.*

*If the Buddha is not benevolent, how is he different from a demon?*

*To kill is to protect life; to sever karma is not to sever people.*

The second form of the True Martial Subdues Demons Sword Art.

**Sever Karma!**

This sword no longer targeted "evil spirits" but instead struck directly at the "karma" entangling the opponent's very existence with this world—the "cause and effect"!

At this moment, Xu Yunfan was convinced that Sanzang's forced conversion was an entanglement of karmic obstacles. This sword was meant to sever the "evil karma" connection that the other party was forcibly entangling.

*Sizzle!*

The air seemed to be cut by invisible threads of cause and effect, making a sound like tearing silk.

Wherever the blade reached, Sanzang's golden light shield fluctuated violently, and for the first time, tiny ripples appeared.

Clearly, the essence of the power contained in this sword had surpassed the simple category of purging evil!

Compassion finally turned to a hint of solemnity on Sanzang's face. He clearly hadn't expected Xu Yunfan's sword intent to be so uncanny and powerful.

"A fine saying: 'to sever karma is not to sever people.' Unfortunately, the karma of Buddhism is deeply buried. How can it be severed by a single sword of yours?"

He suddenly formed a seal with his hands.

*Boom!*

Brilliant, dazzling golden light exploded like a tangible substance. Sanzang's figure rapidly grew taller within the golden light!

A colossal golden Dharma form, thirty feet tall, rose from the ground!

This Dharma form was supremely majestic and sacred.

Eight arms stretched out, each forming a mysterious seal. Its face was neither angry nor joyful, its eyes half-closed. One eye gazed upon the suffering of all phenomena in the mortal world, while the other illuminated the immeasurable light of the ten directions.

Above the Dharma form's head, a great halo of light rotated. Within the halo, the shadows of heavenly dragons circling as protectors were faintly visible, along with the singing of Kalaviṅkas, and the silhouettes of countless Vajra heroes and Dharma protectors of the heavens chanting sutras.

Magnificent, compassionate, majestic, and vast.

A majestic Buddhist power, like a tangible tsunami, swept through the air, pressing down on the void and making it rumble!

This was a protective Dharma form that could only be manifested by a Great Bodhisattva of the Zen Pure Land.

**The Golden Body of the Eight Divisions of Devas and Nagas, Illuminated by Immeasurable Light.**

Although it was not the true body descending, the aura of rank contained within this Dharma form was far beyond the mid Foundation Establishment realm.

It was comparable to the power of a Great Perfected One at the peak of Foundation Establishment!

The moment the Golden Body Dharma form appeared, the edge of the Sever Karma sword was instantly halted in mid-air, as if it had crashed into a hundred-thousand-mountain range. The Dao patterns on the blade flickered wildly and dimmed, on the verge of shattering.

In the life-and-death moment, a fierce light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes, and he held nothing back.

"True Martial... Manifest in the World!!!"

With his furious shout, the light from his Purple Mansion Dao Base shone brilliantly behind him.

A majestic figure, no less imposing than the Golden Body Dharma form opposite, manifested with a thunderous roar.

This was a phantom of a supreme demon god with three heads and six arms!

Xu Yunfan had already lifted his Dao Base, deploying his Martial Dao Base for confrontation.

The central face of this Dharma form was dignified and resolute, its eyes containing thunder, wielding a terrifying halberd wrapped in heavy, dark energy that seemed capable of piercing the earth.

The left face had glaring, furious eyes, its murderous aura soaring to the heavens. Three arms held eerie, chain-like swords entwined with cold, yin energy.

The right face appeared somewhat calmer, but its eyes held flames that could burn the heavens. Three arms held a rapidly spinning great flywheel spewing molten lava, and a narrow-bladed sword that exhaled extreme cold, its blade like an ice spirit.

Its domineering aura and overwhelming might actually managed to withstand the suffocating pressure brought by the Immeasurable Golden Body's Buddhist light.

This was the manifestation of the True Martial Dao Base that Xu Yunfan had cultivated from the *True Martial Subdues Demons Sutra*!

This Martial Dao Base Dharma form circulated the True Martial divine light that was supremely rigid and yang, repelling all evil. Its six weapons exuded distinct yet perfectly integrated destructive energies.

*BOOM!!!*

The True Martial Dharma form swung its dark energy heavy halberd, as if wielding an ancient demonic mountain, and smashed it toward the Immeasurable Golden Body.

The crimson flywheel spun at high speed, transforming into a fury of scorching flames that swept forth.

The青冥 (Cyan Nether) chain sword coiled and stabbed like a venomous snake. The玄冰 (Mystic Ice) sword unleashed a cold wave that could freeze space. Six arms danced wildly, its divine might overwhelming the heavens.

"Benefactor, do you know that the Dao Base is not easily manifested? If something goes wrong, it will be difficult to repair the damage to your Dao."

Accompanied by Sanzang's low chant, the thirty-foot Golden Body Dharma form remained unmoved. Eight arms danced in unison, using fists, palms, or seals, with Buddhist techniques readily deployed, and the golden light vast as an ocean.

A golden "卍" (wan) seal appeared, deflecting the heavy halberd's strike.

A pure, glazed flame spewed from his palm, colliding violently with the molten lava of the crimson flywheel. Ice and fire countered each other, causing continuous, thunderous explosions.

He then lightly flicked a finger behind him, and the Buddhist chant transformed into a tangible sound wave, knocking away the coiling chain sword shadows.

His Buddhist finger, like one plucking a flower, pointed at the piercing玄冰 sword qi. The cold energy was shattered and melted by the pure, refined Buddhist light.

Each collision between the two sides was like the striking of a divine drum or heavenly hammer.

A violent storm of energy spread wildly from the epicenter of their battle.

The sand, stones, and vegetation on the ground were instantly reduced to dust. The solid bedrock below was carved into trenches several dozen feet deep by the dissipating force.

The long sky fluctuated violently, light refracted, and the scenery became blurred.

Within a radius of several miles, low hills were flattened into nothingness, and mountain streams were evaporated dry.

The entire battlefield was in a shambles, as if ravaged by a natural disaster.

This was the limit of the great power a Foundation Establishment cultivator could unleash. Its might was enough to make ordinary Foundation Establishment Perfected Ones not dare to take half a step within it.

This was still because they were within the jurisdiction of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and did not dare to act too recklessly. If they were to fight without restraint, no longer holding back the shockwaves, the battle between just two Foundation Establishment Perfected Ones could shatter mountains and rivers.

Foundation Establishment cultivators had already transcended the mundane and ascended to a higher dimension. When it comes to combat, they naturally enter this higher-dimensional state, avoiding the karma of the mortal world and engaging in their duel in the realm of the unmanifested.
