# Chapter 94: Those Who Rebel, I Shall Kill

Three months after Zhou Qing subdued the Anping Dao sect, the martial world and local factions experienced unprecedented peace since the great upheaval began.

"One month ago, on a night of the full moon, Master Zhou met with the martial heroes of the world at the sheer cliffs behind Qingfu Peak," the storyteller in the teahouse rapped his gavel, recounting one of the two most earth-shattering events in centuries that shook both the martial world and imperial court.

"At that time, the three Grandmaster-level experts were guarding the capital in the north. Jiangzhou only had Master Zhou as its sole Grandmaster. Heroes gathered from all directions, including many notorious figures from the Black Ranking."

"With just one sword, Master Zhou effortlessly defeated nine top experts from the Black Ranking. Then, at his suggestion, the assembled heroes attacked him together—yet still suffered complete defeat."

"Afterwards, Master Zhou left words carved with invisible true qi on the cliff face of Yitian Peak:"

"'Those who rebel, I shall kill.'"

Such stories, spread by storytellers dispatched by the Black Tiger Gang, quickly circulated throughout the land.

Simultaneously, rumors that Zhou Qing was the legendary "Dao Court's" celestial envoy gradually spread. According to investigations by scholars from ancient texts, the legend of the Dao Court could be traced back to antiquity, even tens of thousands of years ago.

The original Great Zhou Empire was merely a remote mortal region in a spiritual wasteland. Master Zhou, as the Dao Court's celestial envoy, came to this mortal land to revive the immortal path—truly ordained by heaven.

This was further confirmed by Prince Qinghe and the Taihe Sect. Prince Qinghe, a descendant of the Great Zhou's founding emperor, possessed family records with ancient seal script containing fragments about the Dao Court.

In ancient times, when states were small and populations sparse, the Dao Court dispatched external branches to govern mortal affairs. All factions coexisted peacefully, unlike the current era of frequent conflicts. It was only after the Dao Court's disappearance that disputes arose.

If it were merely the claims of Prince Qinghe's residence and the Taihe Sect, it wouldn't be convincing. But there was overwhelming evidence.

The elderly Minister Shang of Xijiang Province, though bearing the grudge of his son's death at Zhou Qing's hands, possessed the integrity of ancient scholars. As a former triple-first scholar and model for scholars nationwide, he personally admitted seeing records about the "Dao Court" in imperial archives.

Thus, the credibility of the Dao Court's existence greatly increased.

Li Qingzhi, the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Xijiang, elaborated on how Zhou Qing authored the "Treatise on Epidemics." If not for an immortal's compassion, how could such salvation of all living beings be possible? Li was one of the few officials who strived to maintain peace during the chaotic times, enjoying excellent reputation among the people.

Governor Song of Tiannan Province recounted details of Zhou Qing's participation in the provincial examinations. When he read Zhou's essays, each word seemed to radiate brilliance, brimming with sagely wisdom.

Other examiners also came forward, stating that when Zhou Qing, then the top provincial graduate, visited the examination hall, all secretly marveled, "Truly a celestial being." The then sixteen-year-old youth left an indelible impression on Changzhou's examiners and new graduates.

These individuals, whether Zhou's friends or foes, unanimously agreed that Zhou Qing was indeed a celestial being sent to save the world.

On Prince Qinghe's desk lay Zhou Qing's letter. Sighing to his confidant, he remarked, "I never expected Master Zhou has no desire to be emperor. Instead, he wants us to identify as part of the Huaxia collective, all as legitimate regimes. But this means we need not live in fear anymore."

Henceforth, the Dao Court would be the supreme authority over all Huaxia factions. Without its permission, no conflicts could arise between them. Whether Prince Qinghe wished to attack others or others wished to attack him, they would first need approval from the Dao Court's envoy, Master Zhou.

Only after receiving authorization could warfare proceed according to rules. Otherwise, it would be deemed rebellion.

"Those who rebel, I shall kill!" This was Zhou Qing's stance.

Thus, only righteous wars were permitted between Huaxia factions, and they must follow the Dao Court's arrangements. However, taxes could be retained locally, reducing burdens on the people by eliminating intermediary costs.

Moreover, the Dao Court's external branch would dispatch inspectors to oversee Huaxia factions. If any region excessively oppressed its people, neighboring factions would be authorized to launch righteous wars against it...

Yet overall, the Dao Court's governance of mortal affairs followed a laissez-faire approach.

Prince Qinghe also heard rumors about demons. The Dao Court was selecting candidates nationwide to establish a Demon-Slaying Division dedicated to handling supernatural threats like demonic beasts and evil spirits.

Meanwhile, the former Martial Virtue Division's intelligence network was gradually being taken over by Jiangzhou forces.

"It's said the martial world's Black Ranking will remain, updated every three years. The top-ranked individual may receive Master Zhou's assistance to attempt the Heavenly Thunder Trial and break through to the Grandmaster realm," Prince Qinghe mused.

"Competition for the top Black Ranking spot will intensify."

"That's the Grandmaster realm! If I weren't so old, I'd compete myself."

Additionally, Huaxia factions would undergo evaluations every five years. The top three could obtain Ascension Tokens, granting opportunities to receive Zhou Qing's guidance at Qingfu Palace for the Heavenly Thunder Trial.

However, Zhou Qing warned that even with his help, the trial remained perilous. Success required one's essence, energy, and spirit to reach extraordinary levels.

The Ascension Tokens became a major incentive for factions to submit to the Dao Court. A successful breakthrough could ensure a faction's prosperity for decades.

...

In a desolate underground cavern on the grasslands, the Grassland Martial Sage recuperated amidst dark vines and ghostly mist that continuously converged upon him.

The mist's vine-like tendrils pierced his skull as he emitted distorted screams that gradually faded.

After an indeterminate time, his eyes snapped open, glowing brilliantly and illuminating the cavern. The ghostly mist vanished, leaving only serpentine vines coiled around his knees.

Rising slowly, he exited the cavern, the vines slithering after him. At the entrance stood a stone tablet inscribed with ancient seal script: "Ghost Vine Imprisoned Here" — erected by Master Jingyang.

The Grassland Martial Sage had obtained his beast-skin armor here, along with other cultivation resources that propelled him to prominence among grassland warriors. After successfully undergoing the Heavenly Thunder Trial and achieving the Grandmaster realm, he was severely wounded by the Mystic Yin Patriarch.

Returning to the grasslands, he risked refining the cavern's ghost vine to heal his injuries and enhance his power.

Outside, his disciples stood guard. Seeing him emerge, they knelt in reverence. "Eternal Heaven blesses us! We congratulate Master on mastering divine techniques!"

Observing the ghost vine accompanying him, they assumed he had subdued the demonic entity, gaining unrivaled power.

The Grassland Martial Sage slowly raised his hand. A buzzing roar erupted as ghostly mist enveloped the disciples. The vines beneath them shrieked, wrapping around the warriors and draining their flesh.

Under the mist's influence, they remained dazed, utterly defenseless.

When the mist cleared, only desiccated corpses remained.

A grotesque vine head emerged from the Martial Sage's shoulder, snake-like with fangs, writhing against his face. The vines retracted into his robes, even penetrating his body.

"I... am... the... supreme... one..." he uttered in a sinister, distorted voice.

...

Zhou Qing knew that if Yuan Mingyue could break through to the Grandmaster realm, she would greatly aid him in the future. As for Lin Wan'er, she might only follow the path of Qinglingzi.

Once Zhou Qing gathered sufficient resources, he planned to provide her and Butcher Hu with enough Marrow-Cleansing Pills and Qi-Condensing Pills to embark on the Qi Refining path.

He intended for Prefect Feng to take a greater role in managing secular affairs. Recently, Feng had grown closer to Jiangzhou's garrison commander. Compared to Zhou's original followers like the Lin family and Hu Village, they lacked intimacy with Zhou, naturally forming their own faction.

This reflected the complexity of secular power structures. Even Zhou's inner circle had factions, let alone external forces.

Nevertheless, Zhou had no intention of ruling oppressively. Seeking the Dao was for longevity, not domination. Yet the executioner's blade must remain visible—without deterrence, there would be no fear, inviting chaos.

This transition was new to Zhou, requiring gradual adaptation.

While cultivating, Zhou began enhancing his Shadowless Kick technique, along with Tiger-Crane Form and other martial arts. Advanced techniques were necessary to complement his body-refining cultivation.

True Qi excelled in comprehensive and ranged combat, while close-quarters combat relied on martial techniques suited for body refiners.

In melee, a Qi-refining specialist like Qinglingzi would be no match for Zhou at the same level.

However, Qinglingzi's mention of magical artifacts intrigued Zhou. Thus far, he hadn't found any true artifacts, though his iron sword was gradually developing spirituality through psychic resonance.

The Esoteric Sect and Anping Dao leaders could control spirits, but their ghostly artifacts, while effective against ordinary people and martial artists, were useless against Grandmasters.

Zhou disdained them. His condensed Tiger Armor surpassed any ghostly artifact. With Thunder Palm, White Tiger Seven-Killing Blade, and the demon-repelling mulberry tree in his courtyard, he thoroughly countered all ghostly and demonic paths.

The profound mysteries of the Clear Wind Talisman Scripture unfolded in Zhou's mind as he upgraded Shadowless Kick.

After half a month, a powerful new leg technique emerged—Wind God's Kick (Beginner Level).

With a single kick, an invisible blast shattered a distant earthen wall. Leaping lightly, Zhou soared over a hundred feet high.

"My movement and offensive capabilities have ascended," Zhou remarked, satisfied.

As his cultivation deepened, his Self-Cultivation System and training allowed him to develop various extraordinary abilities. Compared to the dying words of the old eunuch and Qinglingzi, Zhou knew he differed significantly from ordinary Qi refiners and martial Grandmasters.

His abilities were comprehensive, with essence, energy, and spirit advancing uniformly without weaknesses.

"Continue cultivating," Zhou murmured, focusing on mastering Wind God's Kick.

Afterward, he would enhance Tiger-Crane Form and Diamond Palm. With these three powerful techniques combined with Thunder Palm, his combat prowess would become increasingly formidable.

If he were to venture into immortal cultivation regions in the future, formidable strength would be essential. Immortals' abilities far surpassed mortals', making power Zhou's greatest asset on his path.

Advance, continue advancing!

...

On the grasslands, in a desolate underground cavern, the Grassland Martial Sage cultivated amidst dark vines and ghostly mist that converged upon him.

The mist's vine-like tendrils stabbed into his skull as he screamed in agony, his cries gradually weakening.

After an unknown duration, his eyes snapped open, glowing brilliantly and illuminating the cavern. The ghostly mist vanished, leaving serpentine vines coiled at his knees.

Rising slowly, he exited the cavern, the vines slithering after him. A stone tablet at the entrance bore ancient seal script: "Ghost Vine Imprisoned Here" — erected by Master Jingyang.

The Grassland Martial Sage had obtained his beast-skin armor here, along with cultivation resources that elevated him among grassland warriors, enabling him to undergo the Heavenly Thunder Trial and achieve the Grandmaster realm.

After being wounded by the Mystic Yin Patriarch, he returned to the grasslands, risking a secret technique to refine the ghost vine for healing and empowerment.

His disciples, guarding outside, knelt upon his emergence. "Eternal Heaven blesses us! We congratulate Master on mastering divine techniques!"

Seeing the ghost vine, they assumed he had subdued it, gaining demonic power unmatched in the world.

The Grassland Martial Sage slowly raised his hand. A buzzing roar erupted as ghostly mist enveloped the disciples. The vines beneath them shrieked, wrapping around the warriors and draining their flesh.

Under the mist's influence, they remained dazed, utterly defenseless.

When the mist cleared, only desiccated corpses remained.

A grotesque vine head emerged from the Martial Sage's shoulder, snake-like with fangs, writhing against his face. The vines retracted into his robes, even penetrating his body.

"I... am... the... supreme... one..." he uttered in a sinister, distorted voice.
