## Chapter 212: The Ninth True Disciple

"What was that?"

Jun Shixiong, clad in white, instinctively rubbed his eyes, then stared intently at the purple Daoist Seal on the forehead of Deer Thirty-Eight. This kind of Daoist Seal was not unfamiliar to him. Within the Grand One Infinite Dao Sect, all cultivators who practiced the Grand Beginning Primordial Realm possessed it, as it was an external manifestation of the Grand Beginning True Intent. Furthermore, besides cultivators of the Grand Beginning Primordial Realm lineage, the other eight lineages, such as the Aurora Primordial Magnetic Sea, the Chaos Abyss, and the River of Time and Light, also had corresponding Daoist Seals.

However, that trace of supreme and noble purple aura was not among them. If he remembered correctly—

"A True Disciple!"

Jun Shixiong's heart trembled. He was certain he hadn't misidentified it; the Daoist Seal on the beast's forehead was indeed the mark of a Dao Sect True Disciple. In other words, the other party this time represented a True Disciple.

Who could this unknown True Disciple be?

'My master is currently in secluded cultivation, so he specifically sent me here. I hope none of you masters will take offense.'

Deer Thirty-Eight's words echoed in his ears once more. An extremely young face flashed through his mind. As if realizing something, Jun Shixiong's eyes widened, and in an instant, a chill spread throughout his body.

"Zhang Jing? How is this possible! A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator..." He cried out in disbelief in his heart.

Events had progressed to this point, entirely beyond Jun Shixiong's expectations and control. He understood in his heart that if the other party was merely a nominal disciple of a True Monarch, then his actions would not have been problematic. After all, they were also nominal disciples of the Scarlet Bright Vast Clarity Cavern-Heaven; such a minor dispute, even if a True Monarch knew, would not warrant their attention. But if the other party was a True Disciple, then the nature of the situation changed entirely. Even if he was at the Dharma Aspect realm and the other party was merely at Foundation Establishment, a True Disciple was a True Disciple! How could their authority be challenged by an ordinary disciple like himself, who was beneath the True Disciple rank?

*Thump! Thump! Thump!* Jun Shixiong suddenly felt his consciousness become hazy, and his heart pounded violently in his chest. *'I've truly caused a huge problem this time!'* he thought to himself.

Just then, seven other figures, wreathed in dazzling immortal light, silently appeared on the high platform. Five men and two women. Each had a magnificent Daoist Seal on their forehead, faintly imbued with a hint of purple, highlighting their extraordinary nobility.

"It seems everyone has arrived. In that case, let the Welcome Immortal Banquet begin."

On the high platform, Senior Sister Kong's cool gaze swept across the faces of the many Cavern-Heaven disciples below, then lingered on Deer Thirty-Eight for a moment. "Taking this opportunity, I have something to announce to all our junior brothers and sisters. Several months ago, under the witness of all the Martial Uncles, Junior Brother Zhang Jing successfully apprenticed himself to Master, officially becoming Master's fifth formal direct disciple, and also the Ninth True Disciple of the Scarlet Bright Vast Clarity Cavern-Heaven!"

As her words fell, the already quiet venue became even more deathly silent. Immediately after, *Boom—* The entire immortal island began to buzz with excitement.

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing, that name sounds familiar?"

"There shouldn't be a second Senior Brother named 'Zhang Jing' in our Scarlet Bright Vast Clarity Cavern-Heaven, right?"

"Are you talking about *him*? But wasn't he only at the Foundation Establishment realm?"

"..."

***

At this very moment, on the high platform, the eight True Disciples were clearly divided into two ranks. Seated at the front were two men and two women, led by Senior Sister Kong and Feng Wuyu. It was clear that these four were True Monarch Yuanming's four formal direct disciples. Behind them sat four other figures. Although the auras around them were similarly incredibly powerful, with endless immortal light enveloping them, a stark difference could instantly be perceived when compared to the four figures in front.

"Second Senior Brother, congratulations! Your Nine Domains lineage has gained another True Disciple, and to be formally accepted by Master as a direct disciple at the Foundation Establishment realm, your immortal path is boundless."

Beside Feng Wuyu, a charming and graceful figure in a crimson Daoist robe, her teeth faintly visible, spoke softly. Although her voice was soft, her tone revealed neither joy nor sorrow, making it impossible to discern any emotion.

"Haha, Third Junior Sister, you flatter me. Junior Brother Zhang Jing still has a long way to go; he will need Junior Sister's guidance in the future."

"Senior Brother, you're too kind. If Fifth Junior Brother truly needs anything, I will certainly provide my utmost assistance." The woman in red robes covered her mouth with a light laugh, and a terrifying, soul-stirring charm involuntarily bloomed between her brows.

And as the two spoke, Senior Sister Kong, who was seated in the middle, suddenly turned her head and looked directly at Feng Wuyu: "Junior Brother Feng, after this matter is concluded, please take us to visit Junior Brother Zhang Jing. Although we used Junior Brother's opportunity to admonish those below, we have still inevitably offended him."

"Furthermore," Senior Sister Kong's hand suddenly produced a decree, and she said lightly, "According to Master's decree, as a True Disciple, Fifth Junior Brother's immortal island should also be elevated to the higher reaches of the Cavern-Heaven's void."

***

As her words fell, before Feng Wuyu could reply, he heard the voices of the other True Disciple junior brothers and sisters from all sides:

"Second Senior Brother, please be so kind as to take me along."

"Senior Brother, this time I'll go with you too. I'm truly very curious about Junior Brother Zhang Jing, who I've only ever heard of but never seen."

"Oh, right, Senior Brother, since you have such a good relationship with Junior Brother Zhang Jing, may I ask if you know what he likes?"

"Immortal artifacts, spirit treasures, enchanting fairies, seductive Rakshasa, or perhaps wealth and fortune..."

***

Below, Deer Thirty-Eight looked around blankly. He found that what greeted him were only complex gazes, one after another, mixed with awe, goodwill, envy, and various other emotions. This was completely different from when he had first arrived. Moreover, even the terrifying person who had initially given him trouble had subtly changed his attitude. Gone was the previous nonchalance and arrogance. In fact, at this moment, the other party even began to avoid his gaze. How incredible was this?

"A True Disciple! Master actually transformed into a True Disciple of the Grand One Infinite Dao Sect, an immortal human Dao lineage, *hiss—*" Deer Thirty-Eight's mind swirled with countless thoughts, and a sense of profound relief welled up within him. In the Nine-Colored Deer's bloodline inheritance, there was information about the human race and the myriad spirit factions of the myriad heavens. He naturally understood the terror of the Grand One Infinite Dao Sect. And what it meant for his own master to become a Dao Sect True Disciple was self-evident.

"Hehe, I can strut around the Heavenly Realm sideways from now on!"

***

On the other side, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing, a True Disciple?" Xuan Yuan and a few others, along with the many disciples of the Lower Realm's Nine Domains lineage behind them, couldn't help but exchange bewildered glances. They seemed to have been stunned by this sudden news.

After a long while, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly grew fervent. Their Lower Realm's Nine Domains lineage had actually produced another True Disciple, and what's more, a direct disciple of True Monarch Yuanming, the Lord of the Cavern-Heaven! How could they not be excited?

"It seems we'll have to change our address from now on." Xuan Yuan glanced at Junior Brother Gu Yao beside him and said with a smile. Her words were filled with joy.

***

Across from them, "Senior Brother, this... how about we just forget about it? You never said before that the person I was to spar with was a Foundation Establishment True Disciple." The black-robed man from earlier said cautiously, his face drawn. *'I can't possibly do this job!'*

For the other party to become a True Disciple at the Foundation Establishment realm, they must undoubtedly be a monstrous genius with formidable combat prowess. Leaving aside whether he could defeat them while suppressing his own cultivation, just the immense disparity in status made it impossible for him to fight, even if he could win. After all, what if the other party sought revenge later? He was merely a small Golden Core realm cultivator; how could he withstand the full retaliation of a True Disciple? Even if this True Disciple was only at the Foundation Establishment realm!

Beside the black-robed man, Jun Shixiong, still in his white robe, remained silent, appearing as if he hadn't heard anything. A voice that had inexplicably echoed in his mind, *'After today's banquet, you all must first seek Junior Brother Zhang Jing's forgiveness, and then go to my immortal island to face the wall in contemplation for fifty years, as punishment,'* left him stunned in place.
