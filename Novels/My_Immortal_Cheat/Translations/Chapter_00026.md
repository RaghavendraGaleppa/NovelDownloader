# Chapter 26: The Heaven-Searching Grand Formation!

"An Extreme Evil Soul Essence! You're even bringing out something like this!" the other black-robed figure exclaimed in surprise. Soul Essences are fragments of a soul that slowly form after a person above the Saint Realm dies, evolving over a long period. Due to various influences, they come in different types and can profoundly affect one's spirit. Extreme Evil Soul Essences are imbued with malevolent thoughts. Judging by the impact of this particular mass, the soul from which it originated must have been beyond the Saint Realm in life. It was a true evil artifact, priceless in value.

"If this doesn't succeed, even the best treasures will be useless to us later," the black-robed figure holding the Extreme Evil Soul Essence said with a wry smile, guiding the essence in his hand towards the slender black needle on the altar. As the Soul Essence approached the needle, an inexplicable attractive force emanated from it. The essence slowly enveloped the needle, then was gradually absorbed by it. After absorbing the Soul Essence, the faint black light emitted by the slender black needle became even deeper, distorting the surrounding light.

Hearing the words of the black-robed figure who had brought out the Soul Essence, the other person fell silent for a moment. He then conjured an item from thin air: a ghastly white mist floating in mid-air. Countless skull faces emerged on its surface, emitting terrifying roars, accompanied by sounds of chewing and screams. He declared, "This contains the souls of a hundred thousand people who died after enduring immense torture, brimming with resentment. I originally intended to refine a suitable weapon with it, but for now, we must deal with the current situation!" The other black-robed figure nodded, accepted the ghastly white mist, and merged it into the slender black needle.

Once all preparations were complete, a strand of Zhou Tian's hair floated into the Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus's sap. The white lotus bloomed, and just like last time, a phantom image appeared in its center. The two exchanged glances. Having performed this ritual once before, they were well-versed in the steps. Their bodies surged with energy as they cast various runes, controlling the slender black needle to pierce towards Zhou Tian's soul projection.

"Roar!"

An earth-shattering dragon roar emanated from Zhou Tian. A thousand-zhang-long golden divine dragon flew out from his body, circling him. Its physique was robust, its sharp claws tore through space, and its bright dragon eyes shot forth divine light, radiating immense, heaven-shaking power. This protective dragon aura was clearly enhanced and simply could not be compared to the one from last time.

The instant Zhou Tian's protective dragon aura was activated, in an unknown space an immeasurable distance away... This place was like a world unto itself: rivers of starlight flowed, primeval divine mountains stood tall, and hundreds of massive islands floated in the air. This was the Zhou Family's Ancestral Land. On one of the floating islands stood a jade tower ten thousand zhang tall, entirely cast from white jade bricks and intricately carved with profound patterns. The room at the top of the tower utilized a spatial expansion array, enlarging it by more than ten thousand times.

The room was entirely white. In the center was a strange-looking instrument, cast entirely in gold. Its exterior was a hollow spherical cage, within which a golden ellipsoid floated, covered in complex flowing runes. Around the instrument sat four elderly men, their hair and beards pure white, dressed in simple robes. Their eyes were closed, and their hands formed peculiar seals. The moment Zhou Tian's protective dragon aura stirred, the four elders' ears twitched, and they simultaneously opened their eyes. The elder from the west declared, "Zhou Tian's dragon aura has moved!"

"They've made their move!" the elder from the north stated.

The elder from the south nodded and said, "Let's begin as well!"

"I'd like to see who dares to provoke us!" the elder from the east roared.

The elder from the west drew a glistening drop of blood from the void—Zhou Tian's blood. He placed it above the ellipsoid within the hollow sphere. The four elders exchanged glances and nodded. Their auras surged as complex runes flowed from their hands, striking the sphere. The hollow sphere began to rotate slowly, with chains of runes swirling around it. The entire space started to riot, and streaks of formation patterns appeared in the void, connecting to the sphere. The entire tall tower emitted a faint white glow, and the carved patterns on the jade bricks shone with a subtle light as immense energy coursed through them. The hollow sphere spun faster and faster. The ellipsoid inside lit up with golden light, and a slit opened in its center, slowly expanding, resembling an eye. As the "eye" fully opened, a golden pillar of light shot heavenward, passing through the suspended blood above it.

Boom!

The golden pillar connected heaven and earth, and a white grand formation, covering the entire sky, unfurled from its base. In its center was an enormous eye, tens of thousands of li wide, awe-inspiring and chilling to the soul. Simultaneously, above the location of the black-robed figures, another colossal eye appeared tens of thousands of li in the sky, gazing down at them.

The instant they saw the eye, both figures' expressions changed simultaneously. "The Zhou Family's Heaven-Searching Grand Formation!" one of them gasped, recognizing it. This was one of the Zhou Family's super formations, renowned across the Nine Provinces. It was rumored that as long as they activated this formation, there was nothing they couldn't find, akin to the Heaven-Monitoring Treasure Mirror of the Sages. The other's face flickered between different emotions. "These super-powers react incredibly fast. At this point, we can only press on. Only success can earn us the Saint Devil's salvation!"

"Alright!"

Gritting their teeth, the two ignored the gigantic golden eye in the void and continued to control the slender needle, pushing it towards "Zhou Tian." The golden divine dragon radiated brilliant rainbow light, gathering Human Path Saint Qi, resisting the slender black needle. This protective dragon aura was indeed very different from the last time, not just in terms of its physical size. Last time, the dragon aura was eroded within moments, unable to stop the needle. This time, however, it significantly slowed the black needle's advance.

Meanwhile, the four elders, observing this scene through the Heaven-Searching Grand Formation, widened their eyes and roared, "How audacious!"

"Notify Elder Zhan!"

A message was sent out, accompanied by a small golden eye. Outside the jade tower, a white-haired middle-aged man stood in the void – it was Elder Zhan. Upon receiving the message, Elder Zhan frowned slightly. He reached into the void, took the golden eye, and infused it with energy. A fissure opened before him. His body surged with energy, runes erupted, and his qi and blood soared to the heavens. He formed his hand into a claw and reached into the fissure.

Although the golden divine dragon slowed the black needle, it did not stop it. The black needle continued to advance towards "Zhou Tian" at a slow but steady pace. Just then, a fissure opened in the center of the colossal golden eye in the sky. A massive hand, formed from golden energy, reached out, blotting out the sky and sun, aiming for them. The giant hand was incredibly lifelike; a single finger alone was a thousand li long. Its palm lines were clearly visible, and chains of runes swirled around it, imbued with a potent sealing aura.

The two black-robed figures were drenched in sweat, completely unable to move. The black needle nearly came to a halt. "Lord Saint Devil! If you don't act now, we will be suppressed!" one of the black-robed figures roared to the heavens.

Boom! Boom!

The firmament tore open, and a barefoot youth in a white robe stepped out. His white hair flowed behind him, and a rain of flowers descended from the sky. Enveloped in white radiance, he caused an unconscious sense of relaxation in observers. Chants resonated in the void, and celestial maidens danced as if celebrating his arrival.
