# Chapter 27: Conversation and Cooperation

The surface of the sea.

The Canglong Hao was held motionless by an invisible force, its journey halted.

Waves crashed against the ship's bow with rhythmic splashes.

At the bow of the Canglong Hao...

A middle-aged man with a robust build, muscles like bronze cords, and a resolute expression stood atop the waves, looking down at Chen Daoxuan on the deck.

A merfolk!

However, this merfolk bore severe injuries—a massive gash across his chest crisscrossed with sword energy that prevented healing. This was clearly the same merfolk who had clashed with Zhou Mubai, the prodigy of the Zhou Family, ten days ago in Guang'an Prefecture.

Seeing this, a trace of despair flickered in Chen Daoxuan's eyes.

And that wasn't even considering the tens of thousands of merfolk lurking beneath the waves.

The two parties simply stared at each other in silence.

After a long while...

Chen Daoxuan, suppressing the immense pressure, lowered his Feixue Sword and clasped his hands respectfully. "Junior Chen Daoxuan, Young Patriarch of the Chen Family of Shuanghu Island's Changping County, a vassal family under the Qian Yuan Sword Sect's decree, greets the honored elder."

He wasn't ashamed to invoke the name of the Qian Yuan Sword Sect—this merfolk's power far exceeded anything he could handle. He estimated this merfolk had at least mid-stage Zifu cultivation, if not higher. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to hold his own against Zhou Mubai, who ranked on the Zifu Prodigy List.

As for invoking the Zhou Family of Guang'an Prefecture... was he trying to die faster?

Sure enough...

At the mention of the Qian Yuan Sword Sect, a flicker of fear passed through the merfolk's eyes—brief, but caught by Chen Daoxuan's peripheral vision.

"Hmph! Human cultivator, don't think invoking the Qian Yuan Sword Sect will intimidate me!"

His life was saved! Hearing the merfolk speak, Chen Daoxuan internally sighed in relief. His greatest fear had been that the merfolk wouldn't even talk before killing him.

"Honored elder misunderstands—this junior would never dare imply such a thing," Chen Daoxuan said with exaggerated deference. "It's just that the despicable Zhou Family exploits minor families like ours too severely. I have no wish to be associated with them."

He carefully distanced himself from the Zhou Family while making it clear he wasn't issuing threats.

As expected...

At the mention of the Zhou Family, the merfolk's face darkened with hatred.

Seeing the merfolk's emotional reaction, Chen Daoxuan's heart pounded. *Please don't lose control and kill me in a rage—that would be so unfair!* he thought.

Fortunately, as a tribal leader, the merfolk quickly regained his composure despite his fury.

Slowly descending to eye level, the merfolk asked, "You came from Guang'an Prefecture?"

"Reporting to the elder, this junior departed from Guang'an Prefecture seven days ago," Chen Daoxuan replied with a bow.

The merfolk nodded noncommittally, then suddenly raised a hand. A piece of red spirit ore flew out from the Canglong Hao's cargo hold into his palm—the very same red copper ore Chen Daoxuan had purchased in bulk from Guang'an Prefecture's immortal city.

Uncertain of the merfolk's intentions but not daring to resist, Chen Daoxuan kept his head lowered, awaiting judgment.

"Human cultivator, what is this?" the merfolk asked, holding the ore.

"Reporting to the elder, this is red copper ore, a type of spirit ore," Chen Daoxuan answered obediently.

"Is the weapon in your hand made from this ore?" The merfolk pointed at Chen Daoxuan's Feixue Sword.

"The flying sword in my hand is indeed forged from spirit ore, but not red copper—several other types were used instead."

The merfolk exchanged a glance with the smaller female merfolk beside him before nodding. "You're honest, unlike most deceitful human cultivators."

Chen Daoxuan bowed even lower. "Thank you for your praise, elder."

"Enough. Stand straight when speaking." The merfolk waved dismissively.

Relieved, Chen Daoxuan straightened up—his life was safe for now.

"Tell me, why would a minor family cultivator like you purchase so much spirit ore? Don't most sell their ore in Guang'an Prefecture?"

After a brief internal struggle, Chen Daoxuan decided on partial honesty. "Reporting to the elder, my family employs an artificer, so we need to purchase spirit ore for crafting magical implements."

"Is this weapon in your hand one such implement?" The merfolk pointed at the Feixue Sword.

Without hesitation, Chen Daoxuan offered the sword. "Indeed. Please examine it, elder."

The merfolk summoned the sword with a gesture and handed it to the female merfolk. "Nuò'er, test this."

"Yes, Father."

The merfolk maiden named Nuò'er channeled a surge of demonic energy into the sword. Instantly, the Feixue Sword blazed with light, its tip extending a three-meter-long blade aura that slightly distorted the air.

"Such a sharp weapon," Nuò'er marveled. "If our tribe had weapons like this, the Zhou Family wouldn't find it so easy to capture our sisters."

Her expression turned icy at the mention of the Zhou Family's merfolk-hunting teams. Chen Daoxuan remained silent, making himself as inconspicuous as possible to avoid trouble.

"Father, what if we—"

"You mean—"

As the two merfolk conversed via sound transmission, Chen Daoxuan waited patiently.

After a brief interval...

The elder merfolk spoke again. "Human cultivator, we have a business proposition for your family. Are you interested?"

Guessing what was coming, Chen Daoxuan replied cautiously, "Might the elder elaborate on this business?"

The merfolk leader saw right through his reluctance. "We merfolk aren't like you humans—we don't engage in coercive transactions. You needn't worry about that!"

"Elder, I meant no offense—"

The merfolk cut him off with a wave. "First, see what we offer."

He nodded to Nuò'er, who immediately dove beneath the waves.

Half an incense stick's time later...

Nuò'er returned, carrying several items that made Chen Daoxuan's eyes gleam with barely concealed greed—spirit clams, spirit ore, and most importantly, spirit stones—precisely what the Chen Family lacked most!

"Agree to this deal, and our merfolk tribe can provide as much of these as you need," the elder merfolk declared.

At the sight of such treasures, Chen Daoxuan abandoned all pretense of caution. "Elder, please state your terms plainly!"

Who could blame him for changing his tune so quickly? The offer was simply too good to refuse.
