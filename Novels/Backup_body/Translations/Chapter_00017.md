# Chapter 17: The White Bird on the Wall! Comprehending Divine Abilities!

Under the moonlight, in the courtyard,  
a man and a bird stared at each other in astonishment.  

Li Zhengjing had never expected that the so-called "distinguished guest" would turn out to be a white bird!  
Just as he met the bird's gaze and was about to speak, his inner energy suddenly surged!  

A wisp of inner energy flowed into his eyes and onto the golden page!  
The text on the golden page transformed entirely!  

—  

**White Phoenix Divine Bird!**  

**Age:** 8 years and 32 days.  

**Cultivation:** Third level of bloodline awakening (upper-tier inner energy realm).  

**Identity:** Grandson of the "White Sky Sage," the guardian divine bird of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  

**Race:** Phoenix bloodline, innately attuned to fire, blessed with great fortune, revered as an embodiment of auspiciousness! Cooking and consuming it can prolong life!  

**Fate:** Due to negligence caused by drunkenness, the Five Elements Creation Tree was lost. As punishment from the sect's higher-ups, it was originally scheduled to be cast into the Forbidden Thunder Prison in three days, to endure ten years of torment!  

Given its shallow cultivation and incomplete bloodline awakening, entering the Forbidden Thunder Prison would mean certain death!  

Thus, the "White Sky Sage" secretly swapped places, taking the punishment himself in the Forbidden Thunder Prison while covertly releasing his grandson and entrusting it to Elder Gao Changhe of the inner sect!  

Later, through the hands of inner sect disciple Li Zhengjing, the bird would secretly leave the sect and head to Qiling Prefecture to seek the Ghost Valley Spirit Official, who would alter its appearance and forge a new identity for it!  

"Was this white bird reduced to such a state because of me?"  

Li Zhengjing reflexively tightened the sack containing the Five Elements Creation Tree.  

No wonder Elder Gao called it a distinguished guest—this white bird's grandfather was the "White Sky Sage," the sect's guardian divine beast!  

From the looks of it, the White Sky Sage was willing to endure ten years of punishment in its stead, showing just how much he doted on his grandson.  

As he pondered this, he suddenly froze. *How did I see its background?*  

He glanced at the golden page again, but the text had already reverted to content about himself.  

A thought struck him, and after some contemplation, he vaguely understood.  

"By expending my own inner energy, I can discern the details of others?"  

"Right! The inner energy I cultivate is also a form of spiritual energy!"  

"Does this mean I don’t necessarily need spirit stones to reveal the golden page’s content?"  

At this moment, Li Zhengjing felt a surge of excitement. But then another thought occurred to him: *When Elder Gao was here earlier, why couldn’t I see through his background?*  

As Li Zhengjing was lost in thought, the bird's youthful voice rang out again.  

"Have you never seen a talking bird before? Are you scared of me?"  

The white bird burst into laughter, but its mirth quickly faded as sorrow took hold. It asked, "Do you have any wine?"  

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Yes."  

There was still some wine left from the batch the fake medicine peddler had delivered, and the servant disciples had brought it to him after tidying up the outer courtyard.  

"I’ve never left the sect in all my years. The thought of leaving the mountain with you tomorrow weighs heavily on my heart."  

The White Phoenix Divine Bird raised its head slightly, exuding melancholy. "Bring out the wine. Let me drown my sorrows..."  

Li Zhengjing fetched the wine and uncorked it, releasing a rich aroma.  

"Good wine!"  

The white bird sniffed appreciatively, then lowered its head again, despondent. "This wine smells just like the one that got me into trouble last time."  

*Not just similar—it’s the exact same batch!*  

But Li Zhengjing knew this type of wine was common in the taverns outside the mountain, so he poured freely for the bird to enjoy.  

After the bird had its fill, it invited Li Zhengjing to drink as well.  

A few cups later, the white bird began wailing miserably.  

"It was wine like this that got me into big trouble... I don’t know which bastard tricked me..."  

"If I ever find out who it was, I’ll strip them naked, hang them up, and peck them full of holes from head to toe!"  

"That black-hearted scoundrel must be ugly as sin. When I catch him, I’ll drink twelve jars of wine first, then piss all over him!"  

The bird ranted furiously before pausing, then muttered, "I’m a scholarly bird. I shouldn’t use such foul language and lower myself in others’ eyes."  

It then thought, *Under this bright moon, with wine in hand, I should compose a poem to show him I’m no vulgar creature but a literary genius!*  

Just as it was about to speak, Li Zhengjing, equally drunk, suddenly stood and declaimed loudly:  

*"The bow subdues the tiger of South Mountain,*  
*The hand tames the gibbon of Taihang..."*  

He drew his blade and unleashed the Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Saber Technique, venting all the pent-up emotions he had harbored recently.  

*"Drunk, we vie in valor,*  
*Three cups, we wield the treasured blade.*  
*Killing men like cutting grass,*  
*Roaming with heroes like Ju Meng..."*  

"His literary talent surpasses mine?"  

The white bird shuddered in disbelief.  

Li Zhengjing sheathed his blade with a flourish and returned to the table.  

After a long silence, the bird sighed. "I thought few in this world could rival my literary prowess. Yet your talent is no less than mine."  

Li Zhengjing’s expression turned complicated. *A bird thinking it can outshine Li Bai? This bird’s head may be small, but its face is thicker than mine!*  

The bird flapped its wings but said nothing more. After a few more drinks, it muttered, "With such talent, I underestimated you earlier. But you mispronounced the name just now—tomorrow, when we travel together, remember it’s not ‘Ju Meng’!"  

"May I ask your esteemed name?" Li Zhengjing inquired.  

"My name carries profound meaning and a grand origin."  

"On the day I was born, the sect leader returned from slaying demons, reclaiming a lost sect treasure—the Eight Scenes Immortal Tower Diagram, missing for a thousand years."  

"On the day I hatched, the sect leader emerged from seclusion, having mastered the diagram’s secrets."  

"That day, my grandfather was tasked with hanging the diagram on the top floor of the library. Upon returning to the nest, he heard me breaking out of my shell."  

"Recalling the diagram depicted a moonlit sky with an immortal palace and eight celestial scenes, each layer profound and boundless—fitting my destiny—he named me..."  

The bird paused dramatically, eyes gleaming with pride.  

"Bai Jinglou? Bai Xianhua?" Li Zhengjing ventured.  

"Bai Guabi (White Hanging Wall)," the bird declared proudly.  

"..." Li Zhengjing fell silent before finally praising, "A fine name. The White Sky Sage’s literary talent is indeed unmatched."  

"Naturally, his talent is the greatest in the world. Mine is second, and you barely rank third."  

After another swig of wine, the bird muttered, "The night is cold, and the wine’s gone lukewarm..."  

It then opened its beak, and a flame shot out, swirling around the wine jar!  

Li Zhengjing, who had been about to warm the wine, froze in shock.  

*This bird is only at the inner energy realm. How can it perform such a feat?*  

*No wonder Elder Gao said it could protect me on my journey!*  

His eyes flickered as he asked eagerly, "How did you do that?"  

The bird closed its beak, extinguishing the flame, and took a satisfied sip. "The wine’s warm now."  

Li Zhengjing grew even more enthusiastic, fetching another jar to share.  

After several rounds, he finally asked about the flame.  

"This fire?"  

The drunken bird waved a wing. "It’s an innate divine ability. You can’t learn it! Just like I was born with wings and learned to fly, while you humans can’t."  

It opened its beak and spat fire twice more. "But once you reach the ‘true energy’ realm and unblock your meridians, you can cultivate Daoist arts. Channeling true energy through your meridians will grant you wondrous abilities, no less impressive than my divine power!"  

It grew even prouder, boasting that at the "inner energy" realm, it already wielded power comparable to the "true energy" realm.  

After a few more drinks, it toppled over, utterly drunk.  

Li Zhengjing sat silently for a moment.  

"Daoist arts?"  

"I haven’t learned any, but I’ve mastered the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi!"  

"I haven’t reached the true energy realm, and my meridians remain blocked, but... humans are born with open passages from mouth to nose, throat to chest and abdomen!"  

"If I emulate this bird, using the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi as a Daoist art and my ‘mouth’ as a meridian, could I unleash a ‘divine ability’?"  

Excited, he decided to try. A glance at the golden page confirmed his fate hadn’t changed—this experiment wouldn’t endanger his life, bolstering his confidence.  

He stood, took a deep breath, and channeled his inner energy, condensing sword qi in his dantian.  

His eyes brightened as the energy surged upward, ready to burst through his organs, chest, throat, and out his mouth!  

But suddenly, his organs felt as if they were being torn apart. The energy’s path threatened to destroy everything in its wake.  

"No good..."  

Li Zhengjing paled, collapsing with a groan. Gasping, he thought, *If I force this sword qi out, it’ll shred my organs, chest, throat, and mouth—I’d die before harming anyone!*  

He muttered, "Of course. Cultivators only wield Daoist arts at the true energy realm."  

"The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s millennia-old records mention no cases of inner energy realm practitioners using Daoist arts. I was too naive."  

He exhaled, then paused. *But what if my organs, tempered by the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, became tough enough? And if I fortified my mouth, throat, and chest with inner energy beforehand? Maybe it’s possible.*  

But how resilient would his organs need to be?  

Moreover, diverting inner energy for protection would deplete his reserves.  

At his current level, his inner energy was already insufficient. He’d need to expend half just to shield his body, halving his combat strength!  

*But if I reach the upper tiers of the inner energy realm, my reserves would be vast enough that the protective energy would be a minor fraction, barely affecting my power.*  

He nodded to himself. *The real hurdle is my organs’ fragility. I’ll revisit this once my inner energy grows stronger.*  

With that, he gathered his inner energy into his dantian, filling the lower layer to a height of three inches.  

**Third level of the inner energy realm!**  
**Peak of the initial stage!**  

One step further, and he’d truly enter the "mid-tier" of the inner energy realm!
