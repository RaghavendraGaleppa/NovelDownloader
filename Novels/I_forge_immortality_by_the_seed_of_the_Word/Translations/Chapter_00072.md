# Chapter 71: The Outbreak of War

"Who did this? Demons?"

Inside the shop, Zhang Jing looked at the two people across from him, his voice devoid of emotion.

"Junior Brother, you haven't left the city, have you?"

Tong Yao didn't answer his question, instead asking with concern.

"Senior Brother, what exactly happened?" Zhang Jing turned to Senior Brother Ding.

Opposite him, Senior Brother Ding gave a bitter smile before recounting their previous encounter in detail.

After finishing, he stared intently at Zhang Jing and earnestly advised:

"Junior Brother, whatever you do, don't leave Langya City."

"Tong Yao and I will be returning to the academy tonight with several senior brothers. You should find a way to return with Senior Brother Li—it'll be safer that way."

"That's right, Junior Brother, don't even think about going back alone," Tong Yao chimed in.

Zhang Jing remained silent, seemingly deep in thought.

After a long pause, he spoke.

"Senior Brother Ding, Senior Sister Tong, if I understand correctly, while you were hunting demons outside last night, you were suddenly attacked by a cultivator who questioned you about the whereabouts of the storage bag from that demon tiger?"

"Subsequently, Senior Brothers Zhou and Xia were subjected to soul-refining torture, and the attacker learned the item was in my possession."

"You two were rescued by a passing senior brother, while the assailant fled in panic."

"That's essentially what happened, right?"

Zhang Jing's voice was grave.

Senior Brother Ding and Tong Yao nodded in unison.

"Was the attacker wearing gray robes, with a hooked nose and deep-set eyes?" Zhang Jing suddenly asked, as if recalling something.

As soon as the words left his mouth, the two across from him showed identical expressions of surprise.

"How did you know?"

"Did he come after you?"

So it was that gray-robed man!

Understanding dawned in Zhang Jing's heart.

No wonder the man knew about the Blood Mill in his possession—he had interrogated Senior Brothers Ding and the others first.

"What a pity about Senior Brothers Zhou and Xia," he sighed inwardly.

"Junior Brother, how exactly did you escape from that man?"

Tong Yao looked at Zhang Jing, noticing his pristine condition without any signs of battle, and couldn't help but ask curiously.

"That man is dead," Zhang Jing stated calmly.

The moment the words fell, Tong Yao and Senior Brother Ding's breathing hitched.

"Junior Brother, you're saying that man is... dead?" Tong Yao stammered.

Beside her, Senior Brother Ding wore an equally incredulous expression.

"Correct!"

Meeting their gazes, Zhang Jing nodded firmly in confirmation.

Boom—

A thunderous explosion seemed to echo in Senior Brother Ding's ears.

Though he found it impossible to believe, the junior brother before him had accurately described the assailant's appearance—details that couldn't be fabricated.

But how was this possible?

A late-stage Qi Refining cultivator ambushing a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator, with the advantage of surprise, yet ending up dead himself?

Wait—his cultivation!

Only then did Senior Brother Ding realize he could no longer discern his junior brother's cultivation level, which could only mean one thing.

"Junior Brother, you've reached the fifth level of Qi Refining?" he asked dumbly, his eyes filled with bewilderment.

"Senior Brother, I was fortunate to make a breakthrough."

"Fortunate, my foot," Senior Brother Ding muttered.

Meanwhile—

"What? Fifth level of Qi Refining!" Tong Yao exclaimed. "Junior Brother, weren't you at the third level just recently? How did you reach the fifth level in such a short time?"

She stared at Zhang Jing as if he were a monster.

No—even monsters didn't cultivate this fast!

"Then why am I still at the third level after three years of cultivation? What am I doing wrong?" Tong Yao muttered, her eyes glazing over as she fell into self-doubt.

At that moment, the door to Zhang Jing's shop suddenly rattled.

The next second—

With a loud crash, both doors collapsed inward.

"Master, when can I come in—"

A massive deer head cautiously poked through the doorway, staring dumbly at the broken doors on the ground, as if puzzled why they had collapsed at a mere touch.

Lu Thirty-Eight then looked at Zhang Jing inside the shop and shrank its neck—it seemed it had messed up.

"Junior Brother, what is this...?" Senior Brother Ding pointed at the terrifyingly powerful Lu Thirty-Eight, his tongue tangling.

"Senior Brother, this is Lu Thirty-Eight, my mount," Zhang Jing explained.

"Mount?"

Tong Yao looked at Zhang Jing numbly.

"Junior Brother, you..." Senior Brother Ding wanted to say more, but the words caught in his throat. Finally, he could only mutter, "We'll be heading back first. Take care, Junior Brother."

"Safe travels, Senior Brother and Sister!"

Zhang Jing stood to see them off, watching until they disappeared into the crowd.

Only then did he turn around and say irritably to Lu Thirty-Eight, "Come in."

"Yes, Master."

Lu Thirty-Eight grinned widely before squeezing its massive frame through the doorway with a series of creaks and groans.

The two broken door panels on the ground were crushed to splinters under its hooves.

Gazing at the now doorless entrance, Zhang Jing sighed.

"Thirty-Eight, since you broke my doors, you'll stand guard here tonight. It's not like you have anywhere else to stay for now."

"I'm going out."

"Understood, Master."

Lu Thirty-Eight obediently replied before finding a spacious spot to lie down, its large eyes fixed unblinkingly on the entrance.

Ignoring the deer's antics, Zhang Jing stepped outside, having already decided to return to the academy tomorrow.

With his current resources nearly sufficient, he needed to exchange for high-grade cultivation techniques as soon as possible—every day sooner meant faster progress.

He also needed to find a size-shifting technique for Lu Thirty-Eight.

Otherwise, he feared his residence wouldn't last long under the deer's... enthusiasm.

But before that, he needed to inform Senior Brothers Li and Yan, and return the shop keys to the latter.

After all, they were of no use now.

In the quiet courtyard of Langya Prefecture's government office:

"Returning tomorrow?" Senior Brother Li nodded approvingly after glancing at Zhang Jing standing before him. "That's for the best. The situation is growing increasingly tense—some inner court members have already arrived ahead of schedule."

"The sooner you leave, the safer you'll be."

"That's what I thought, which is why I came to bid you farewell today, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"By the way, Junior Brother, after you return, remember to visit the Luodu Tower at the center of Luodu Island. Senior Brother Li will be waiting for you there," Senior Brother Li instructed.

"Senior Brother Li?" Zhang Jing looked at him curiously.

"Haha, he's the current captain of our Luodu Squad," Senior Brother Li chuckled, suddenly remembering that this junior brother had joined the squad less than two months ago and knew few people.

"Understood. Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother."

Zhang Jing didn't press further, though he had a vague feeling it might be related to his talisman crafting.

Other than that, he couldn't think of any other reason the captain would seek him out.

As Zhang Jing pondered, Senior Brother Li abruptly asked:

"What's your current success rate for mid-grade talismans, Junior Brother?"

"Thirty to forty percent."

Zhang Jing answered without hesitation.

"Haha, excellent!"

Senior Brother Li laughed heartily before fixing Zhang Jing with a serious look. "Junior Brother, when you meet Senior Brother Li this time, don't forget to apply for a steward position in the squad."

"A steward?"

"Indeed. With fifth-level Qi Refining cultivation and over a thirty percent success rate for mid-grade talismans, you're more than qualified to become a steward of our Luodu Squad. Tsk tsk—a steward in less than two months? You'll be making history in Luodu Squad, kid."

Senior Brother Li clicked his tongue in amazement.

Become a steward?!

Zhang Jing was momentarily stunned.

If he remembered correctly, Senior Brother Yangchu was a steward, wasn't he?

"I wonder what expression Senior Brother Yangchu will have when we meet again..." Zhang Jing thought with amusement.

Snapping back to reality:

"Senior Brother, as a steward, would items from the squad's resource repository be cheaper?"

Zhang Jing looked at Senior Brother Li curiously.

"Naturally. Squad stewards can exchange items from the repository at sixty percent of the original price. They also gain the authority to issue personal missions."

"However, due to the unique nature of the top ten squads, these personal missions can target all members of the top ten squads, not just our Luodu Squad."

Senior Brother Li patiently explained.

Across from him, Zhang Jing was dumbfounded.

Stewards could do this?!

Not only could they purchase cultivation resources at nearly half price, but they could also issue personal missions accessible to all members of the top ten squads?

Zhang Jing felt a surge of excitement.

"Understood, Senior Brother."

That night, while cultivating, Zhang Jing was abruptly awakened by a tremendous commotion.

Before he could react, he sensed wave after wave of terrifyingly oppressive auras appearing one after another.

Looking out the window, he saw a crimson giant dozens of feet tall materialize, gripping a massive bow that it slowly drew back.

A flaming arrow wreathed in scarlet fire suddenly appeared, illuminating half the sky!

A scorching, overwhelming heat surged in all directions, as if a volcano had erupted in the heart of Langya Prefecture.

Everywhere his gaze fell, raging flames spread.

Twang!

The fiery arrow shot into the heavens.

The next moment, flames erupted, setting the clouds ablaze.
