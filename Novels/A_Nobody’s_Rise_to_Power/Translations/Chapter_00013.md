Chapter 13: The First Striker Has the Advantage

Yang Canfeng glanced quickly at Steward Yi, whose face was even paler than if he had just lost his own father.

A mountain breeze swept past, and Yi She felt a chill run down his back.

If he had known that interrogating the bandit would yield such an answer, he would have preferred to be reprimanded by the Clan Master for incompetence rather than conducting the preliminary interrogation.

He never imagined that a name like Yu Huanhu would be revealed.

The Young Master’s death was actually the work of the Second Master?

Steward Yi believed the bandit’s words almost instantly.

Because no one had a stronger motive to kill than the Second Master, Yu.

The power struggle between the main branch and the second branch of the Yu family had been going on for a long time.

As a vassal of the Yu family, Yi She had always been secretly courted by both sides.

Naturally, he was fully aware of their open and covert conflicts.

In fact, Yi She was also very clear about the Yu family’s desperate attempt to form a marriage alliance with the Suo family.

Wasn't it just to借助 the Suo family's help to regain control of the main branch?

Under such circumstances, it was not impossible for the second branch to take a desperate gamble and destroy the alliance by assassinating the groom.

However, using assassination as a means of struggle meant that the internal power struggle within the Yu family had escalated to a life-and-death frenzy.

The more precarious the situation became, the more he wanted to avoid getting involved before clearly choosing a side.

Yi She now wished he had never heard the bandit utter the words "Yu Huanhu."

The interrogation ended hastily.

The bandit was stripped, washed clean, and had a full gourd of top-quality golden sore medicine applied to his wounds. He was then wrapped entirely in clean silk cloth, turning him into a mummy.

Now, Steward Yi was truly afraid he would die. This bandit had to be brought alive to Tianshui City to be personally interrogated by the Clan Master.

Steward Yi did not want to be the one to tell the Clan Master the name "Yu Huanhu."

Bonfires were lit at the foot of the mountain.

Everyone relaxed as they were about to enter the territory of Tianshui, and tonight’s dinner was exceptionally sumptuous.

The yellow sheep hunted along the way were cleaned by the stream. Chunks of fatty, tender mutton were either boiled or roasted, ready to be devoured.

There were three felt tents at the foot of the mountain, serving as the sleeping quarters for Suo Chanzhi, Steward Yi, and Tu Mama.

Due to Steward Yi’s arrival, and coupled with Yang Can’s earlier "accusation," Tu Mama specifically instructed that the Yu and Suo families mix their camps tonight, no longer driving the Yu family members to the periphery as lowly servants.

Yang Can and several Yu family guards sat beside a bonfire outside the sleeping tents, roasting meat.

The best cut of mutton for roasting is the shoulder, followed by the ribs, tenderloin, and hind leg.

Because the shoulder has low fat content, tender meat with a chewy texture, and high heat can lock in the meaty aroma, providing an excellent taste.

Yang Can was currently roasting a piece of shoulder meat.

As a great hero who dared to challenge the Suo family directly, this was a special cut chosen for him by the Yu family guards.

Sitting by the same bonfire with Yang Can were five people, one of whom was Leopard Head.

Even though Leopard Head was about to fall from grace, before the Clan Master’s disposal was decided, he was still the person in the Yu family’s contingent with the highest status after Steward Yi and Mr. Yang, and naturally had the right to be here.

Seeing that the sky was gradually darkening and everyone was about seven or eight tenths full, Yang Can secretly winked at Leopard Head.

Leopard Head understood, passed the wine jar to the side, and said in a deep voice, "You guys drink, I’m going to patrol."

The guards by the bonfire paused, watching Leopard Head leave.

Someone originally wanted to say something, but swallowed the words back down.

They knew that once they returned to Tianshui, Commander Cheng would not have a good time.

In this situation, did he still need to be so dutiful?

Although these words were spoken out of good intentions, they were not easy to say, so they ultimately remained silent.

"Hey, let's drink, let's drink!" A guard picked up a wine gourd and raised it to Yang Can.

Yang Can was holding a small knife in his hand, carving meat off a shoulder bone.

Perhaps because he had drunk too much, Yang Can didn't control his strength well. With a fierce slash, he cut off a piece of meat along with the bone.

"Ah!"

Yang Can watched the piece of bone and meat fall into the bonfire and couldn't help but cry out in annoyance, then raised his wine gourd.

"Come on, come on, drink, drink."

Leopard Head walked along, his heart still struggling.

Should he really do as Mr. Yang said?

Create a disturbance to attract everyone's attention, luring the old witch Tu Mama out of the tent.

And then...

Mr. Yang said that after that, someone would naturally take care of it.

The person who would take care of it was taking Tu Mama’s life.

According to Mr. Yang, the person responsible for plotting everything in the Suo family’s dowry procession was this Tu Mama.

As long as Tu Mama was eliminated, the person stirring up trouble in the Suo family would be gone.

Moreover, if he could do something so ruthless, he might actually win a sliver of life in front of the Clan Master.

Leopard Head had some doubts about this statement, but it was obvious that he was already facing a desperate situation.

Should he take a gamble?

This wavering thought was finally solidified with the "help" of Deputy Commander Liu Yu.

Liu Yu was the deputy commander of the main branch guards and Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan’s deputy.

Usually, this man was very respectful to Leopard Head, but tonight when Leopard Head patrolled to his position, Liu Yu sat by the bonfire, and seeing Leopard Head approach, he remained seated cross-legged.

When Leopard Head toasted them, he also sat there arrogantly, raising a hand perfunctorily.

Looking at Leopard Head, Liu Yu’s gaze was very thought-provoking.

It was this gaze, faintly tinged with mockery, that stabbed Cheng Dakuan’s heart.

Although Liu Yu’s eyes were very subtle, it was no match for Cheng Dakuan, a fierce tiger who could smell a rose.

The deputy who used to be so respectful to him was already acting like this...

Leopard Head could already imagine how many people would add insult to injury when he truly fell into misfortune.

Since a head will be chopped whether it sticks out or not, then this老子 will fight!

When Leopard Head turned and walked away, a fierce smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

The night was as dark as ink. Bonfires flickered in the wind, stretching shadows long and short.

Although it was not suitable to talk and laugh loudly due to the assassination of the Young Master of the Yu family, the custom in Longshang was rough, and there was no ban on alcohol.

The aroma of wine and meat, mixed with low voices, drifted slowly into the distance.

Suddenly, by a bonfire, several drunk Yu family guards quarreled with the Suo family guards next to them over some unknown reason.

The verbal quarrel quickly turned into a fistfight.

Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan was indeed about to lose power, and there were people eagerly waiting for him to fall.

However, he had served as the commander of the main branch guards for many years, and naturally had some loyal confidants willing to work for him.

Under Leopard Head’s instigation, they pretended to be drunk and fought with the Suo family members.

Leopard Head "heard the news" and rushed over. Seeing his subordinates being beaten, he immediately drew his sword and charged in.

Thus, the fight escalated into a melee.

Bonfires swayed in the night wind, and the scale of the melee continued to expand.

The several Yu family guards beside Yang Can all jumped up, gripping their sharp blades and vigilantly watching the two sides in the chaos.

They did not forget that their duty was to protect Steward Yi, so they did not leave.

Yang Can also stood up. He had no weapon in his hand, still holding the shoulder bone with meat.

Suo Chanzhi hurriedly walked out of the tent, subconsciously looking at Yang Can first.

Because she had been paying attention to Yang Can, she found his position at a glance.

Yang Can stood in the middle of several guards, looking towards the commotion while raising the shoulder meat and taking a calm bite.

This reckless guy...

Suo Chanzhi was so angry she laughed.

Tu Mama heard the commotion and was immediately delighted, quickly walking out of the tent.

She thought this was the effect of the means she had arranged beforehand, but she never expected that Yang Can would coincidentally have the same idea.

Her people had not yet started causing trouble, but the people arranged by Yang Can had already made a move.

However, precisely because Tu Mama had also made arrangements, the conflict broke out so quickly and spread so rapidly.

The guards around the main tent held their positions and did not participate in the surrounding melee.

Tu Mama hurriedly stepped out of the main tent, walked forward a few steps, and looked at the crowd fighting in the distance.

A wolf-tooth arrow was hidden in her sleeve, tightly pressed against her wrist.

Tu Mama was skilled in hidden weapons such as flying knives and sleeve arrows.

Although she was now using just an ordinary wolf-tooth arrow, throwing it as a hand arrow would not be very effective, but it was enough for sneak attacks and killing.

Yang Can and the four guards were not standing closely together. Tu Mama approached slowly from their side and rear, her eyes always looking forward, as if watching the two sides fighting.

But out of the corner of her eye, she had already taken in the situation of Yang Can and the others.

Everyone was watching the chaos on the periphery. If she acted now, even if her movements were a bit exaggerated, no one would notice.

After all, it would only be a matter of an instant, and then...

Then there would be nothing more. Yang Can would die, killed by a inexplicable cold arrow.

As for who shot the arrow, heh, the death of the Young Master Yu is still a mystery, who cares about a tutor?

In short, once Yang Can died, the danger of her secret being leaked would be gone.

Tu Mama slowly stopped, a sinister smile appearing at the corner of her mouth.

She had found a good angle, her arm was already gathering strength, preparing to throw out that wolf-tooth arrow.

Tu Mama quickly glanced around to prevent anyone from noticing her movements.

Suddenly, a strange object spun through the night air, carrying a faint sound of wind.

However, the sound of breaking the wind was very small, completely concealed by the evening breeze and the shouts of battle.

"Swoosh!"

The object swept past Tu Mama’s throat and spun back.

Until the thing came and went, flying towards Yang Can in a strange arc, did Tu Mama feel a sharp pain in her throat.

Tu Mama subconsciously let go of her tightly clenched fingers, and the wolf-tooth arrow in her sleeve fell to the ground.

She wanted to cover her bleeding throat, but it was all in vain. Blood sprayed out from between her fingers.

Tu Mama made a "gurgling" sound in her throat, stumbled forward two steps, and fell face down.

Tu Mama’s eyes were wide open until her death, she never knew what had happened.

Yang Can was still standing by the bonfire, craning his neck to look ahead, like a focused duck.

Perhaps because the battle ahead was too intense, he even walked forward two steps unguardedly.

Because of these two steps he took, the object spinning back brushed past him and flew into the bonfire beside him.

The thing that disappeared into the bonfire... was the sheep shoulder bone he had been gnawing on.

A sheep’s shoulder blade is naturally close to a boomerang, flat, slightly curved, and triangular, with thin and sharp edges.

Moreover, the parts that needed to be used were made even sharper by Yang Can’s sharp knife.

The sheep shoulder bone that had completed its mission of killing brushed past Yang Can and fell into the bonfire.

The sparks stirred up by the bonfire were negligible compared to the size of the entire fire, and did not attract anyone’s attention.

Tu Mama fell to the ground, motionless, and not a single person around her had seen it yet.

The spot she had chosen was indeed good.
