# Chapter 81: The Princess's Hobby, and the Lotus Beyond Divine Arts

Tonight, the moon seemed much brighter than usual.

In the guest room, Li Mo had just finished laying out the bedding.

After thinking about it for a moment, he roughly guessed that Bing Tuozi didn't let him stay next door because of her constitution.

He wondered if this happened regularly, like "those days" of the month, or if it was an occasional occurrence?

"The Supreme Yin Moon Phoenix Body possesses various extraordinary traits and phenomena."

"My Immortal Body is too low-key; even breaking through realms is a problem now."

Li Mo only muttered a few complaints.

The System never gave him useless things, especially those dropped by Bing Tuozi.

But constitution...

That is something usually explored by martial artists who possess such constitutions, generation after generation, based on experience.

For example, Lin Jiang clearly knew he had to practice spear techniques to maximize the potential of his constitution.

Li Mo had no one to learn from.

He could only rely on himself, exploring step by step...

Thinking this way.

Li Mo opened the two new supreme sword manuals he had obtained and began to study them carefully.

Gradually, night deepened.

Suddenly, the World Seed fluctuated.

"Is Chu Long that early today?"

.........

Inside the World Seed.

Jiang Chulong hugged a tree branch, hanging her little head. She had just demonstrated her results, her eyes secretly looking at the figure opposite her.

Biting her lip, she carefully asked:

"Teacher... I... I didn't make you... disappointed, did I?"

She didn't know.

The 'Heavenly尊' (Lord) was just one step away from sucking in a cold breath and saying, "This girl is terrifying!"

*A single blade severing the sun, moon, and stars.* He had just said that casually to give Princess Jiang a little motivation.

But Princess Jiang actually practiced along that path!

When she just unleashed her sword.

She actually carried a hint of that boundless meaning: "The wild fire cannot burn it all, the spring wind blows and it grows again."

It was Sword Intent.

Without formally learning any sword manual, she had领悟ed (comprehended) her own Intent!

"Mm, not bad. You must have worked very hard这段时间 (during this period)."

"Not hard... not hard."

Princess Jiang's face turned red from the praise, waving her hands repeatedly:

"I just... just..."

"When I wake up early... when I eat... when I go outside... to pick things up... I practiced... practiced a bit, then at night... at night when sleeping... I practiced with you again..."

Princess Jiang's day was very simple.

Eating, sleeping, picking up trash, and practicing the sword while doing these three things.

Li Mo: "..."

Practicing twelve hours a day, huh?

Also, didn't he ask the Murong family to take good care of her? Why did she still have to go out to pick up scraps?

"Did you encounter difficulties in your life?"

"I used to often go hungry, but after Brother Li came, it never happened again..."

Jiang Chulong suddenly stopped stuttering, speaking softly.

When mentioning 'Brother Li', her voice grew smaller and smaller...

"Then why do you go out to pick things up every day?"

Hearing the Heavenly尊 Teacher ask this.

Jiang Chulong tilted her head.

Right, why?

She didn't understand either.

She only knew that every time she came back from outside, picking up things others didn't want, like broken paper kites, chipped bottles, and such, seeing those scraps tidied up and arranged neatly, she felt very satisfied, a sense of accomplishment, and very happy...

"A hobby... a hobby?"

Jiang Chulong blinked, testing the waters.

Li Mo: "..."

Such a niche hobby.

Fine, as long as she's happy.

"By the way... Teacher... Brother Li... how has he been recently?"

A weak inquiry came.

Jiang Chulong's gray-white eyes seemed even brighter than just now.

She thought, the Teacher is so powerful, knowing even the magnificent events of the ancient times in detail.

He must know how Brother Li has been doing recently, right?

The little girl cares about me quite a bit.

He had said he would go back to see her last time, but he never sent a message back.

Li Mo couldn't help but smile in his heart.

He cleared his throat:

"Li Mo, right? He's doing quite well."

"He just won one of the top three spots in the Nine Peaks Tournament of the Qingyuan Sect, his reputation is rising, respected by the heroes of Ziyang Prefecture."

"Speaking as a neutral bystander, his sword skills are quite decent."

Jiang Chulong listened with shining eyes, as if drifting far away, seeing Brother Li's high spirits on the arena.

She smiled foolishly:

"Brother Li is so amazing."

"Mm, he should come back to the prefecture city to see you in a while."

"Really?"

"Alright, back to business. Take these two sword manuals to comprehend. Next time I will test you. Practice them secretly, don't show them to others."

The Heavenly尊 waved his sleeve, and two sword manuals appeared on the table.

Jiang Chulong accepted them珍视地 (treasurely).

Then she covered her stomach, a bit confused:

"Teacher, I... in my stomach... recently, it feels like there's a... little mouse."

A little mouse?

Under the mask, Li Mo raised an eyebrow, reaching out to check her pulse.

After sensing it, he let out a breath of relief, but found it strange:

"That's not your stomach, that's your Dantian."

"You are about to open your meridians."

"Opening meridians?"

Jiang Chulong knew very little about martial arts and didn't understand the concept of opening meridians.

Li Mo didn't have time to explain to her.

He had planned to wait until Jiang Chulong's body recovered a bit more before helping her condense Qi and blood.

He didn't expect her to find the right path on her own, albeit confusedly.

"In that case, I will give you some pills to protect your meridians."

......

The night grew even thicker.

The bright moon hung high in the sky, casting silver brilliance over the entire Autumn Water Pavilion, making the ground reflect a snow-white light.

The sound of the stream flowing in the courtyard was gone.

"Hoo..."

Li Mo exhaled a white breath and looked outside.

The entire stream had unknowingly frozen solid, glowing with a dark blue luster in the night.

The small Autumn Water Pavilion was now freezing cold,简直 (simply) colder than the deep winter.

"Bing Tuozi..."

"She shouldn't be in any trouble, right?"

Thinking this way.

The System's notification sound suddenly rang in his ear:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Jiang Chulong and helping her successfully open her meridians.】

【Investment Feedback: One Mystic Silver Heavenly Script Seal.】

【Mystic Silver Heavenly Script Seal: Can deduce and perfect any technique below Supreme Grade, and elevate its grade by one level!】

"It's finally here!"

Li Mo's eyes lit up suddenly.

He was just one Mystic Silver Heavenly Script Seal away from upgrading a Supreme Grade technique to a Divine Art, and then he could use that Golden Heavenly Script Seal.

This meant he would obtain a martial art above Divine Art!

And he had the chance to break through to the Internal Breath Realm!

If Princess Jiang were in front of him, he would hug her and give her a few hard kisses!

No need to hesitate.

A small seal, resembling flowing mercury, appeared in his palm. The tadpole-like script on it seemed to come alive.

He took out the "Fire Lotus Extreme Yang Strength" and stamped it.

The characters suddenly flowed, as if countless swimming fish were darting around inside.

**True Phoenix Blood Lotus Exchange Sun Divine Art**

Divine Art!

The thing that countless people in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths dream of, lying quietly on the table like this.

A single Divine Art was enough to make countless strong experts fall, influence the rise and fall of unimaginable forces, stir up wind and clouds, and unleash a storm of blood and rain.

After reading the "Moonlight Sword Canon" and the "Sun Wheel Sword Canon," Li Mo knew that while these two sword techniques were exquisite, they were ultimately just Lower Grade Supreme Techniques.

No matter how well the two swords combined, they couldn't compare to a true Divine Art.

It was probably due to the long passage of time and the exaggeration of rumors.

"Divine Arts are still beyond imagination, the extreme of the martial path."

"What lies above that?"

Li Mo couldn't help but feel his heart surging.

The Golden Heavenly Script Seal, in his palm, slowly fell onto the paper.

Golden mystic text exploded at this moment, converging into it like a hundred rivers flowing east to the sea.

The high-quality blue-and-white paper gradually dissolved, perhaps because what was written on it exceeded its capacity.

"Wait, I haven't seen it clearly..."

While greatly surprised in his heart, Li Mo focused his gaze.

He saw that the characters were obscure and profound, seemingly still changing and being reborn, impossible for anyone to peep at.

This wasn't any script Li Mo had ever seen.

It was hard to even say this was writing.

Hum—

The paper finally dissolved completely.

It turned into a petal with a mysterious charm. Taking advantage of Li Mo's inattention, it flew into his eyebrows.

Boom—

A magnificent scene flashed through his mind.

As if the heavens and earth had just opened, all things were chaotic. In an instant, countless things were dissolving and reborn, far more exaggerated than the movements in the small world.

A red lotus grew quietly.

With a slight movement of the lotus petals, boundless karma fire burned the sky.
