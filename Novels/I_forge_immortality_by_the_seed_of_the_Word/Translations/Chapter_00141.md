# Chapter 139: The Conflict Between Two Factions

"Open the Immortal Transformation Pool? Just for one person and a deer?"

The two white-robed men—one tall and one short—were momentarily stunned before quickly realizing the situation.

The young purple-robed man before them and the white deer by his side must have just ascended from the lower realm.

Exchanging glances, they couldn't hide the resentment in their eyes. This was their first time guarding the Immortal Transformation Pool, and they hadn't expected to encounter such a situation right away. Though they wanted to protest, the senior before them clearly had an imposing presence that suggested significant backing. They didn't dare refuse outright.

"Senior Brother, please wait a moment. We need to request instructions," they said respectfully in unison.

"Go ahead," Feng Wuyu replied impassively.

With that, the two men transformed into streaks of light and vanished into the sky.

Watching them leave, Zhang Jing's eyes flickered with curiosity. "Senior Brother Feng, those two seemed rather reluctant?"

"That's normal," Feng Wuyu explained with a smile. "They're natives of the Celestial Realm. They believe we from the lower realms are taking resources and sect quotas that rightfully belong to them. Their attitude isn't surprising. Besides, those two are likely new recruits to the Taiyi Dao Sect and don't know any better."

"There are mortals in the Celestial Realm? The Taiyi Dao Sect recruits disciples from here as well as the lower realms?" Zhang Jing asked, surprised.

He had always assumed the Celestial Realm was populated solely by immortals and that all new disciples came from the lower realms like himself.

"Of course," Feng Wuyu replied, his smile widening. "In fact, the sect recruits far more disciples from the Celestial Realm than from the lower realms. The Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven, where our sect resides, is comparable in size to the Nine Domains of the lower realms, with countless mortals. Moreover, due to the complete Dao laws here, prodigies emerge in endless succession."

"Then why does the sect still recruit from the lower realms—" Zhang Jing began, puzzled.

"Because the Nine Domains are the ancestral homeland of many of our sect's Dao Sovereigns," Feng Wuyu explained. "Out of respect for this heritage, the sect expends great resources to recruit disciples from there. Consider it a form of compensation. This isn't unique to our Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect—all major human factions in the Celestial Realms follow the same practice."

A complex emotion flashed through Feng Wuyu's eyes.

"I see," Zhang Jing murmured, a glimmer of understanding dawning.

Wait a minute!

A sudden realization struck him. "Senior Brother Feng, are you also from the Nine Domains of the lower realms?"

"Yes," Feng Wuyu replied, his gaze warming as he looked at Zhang Jing. "I'm from the lower realms as well. But my homeland, the Bian Domain, wasn't as peaceful as your Jun Domain. There, the conflict between humans and the Myriad Spirit Faction never ceased, even drawing in factions from the Celestial Realms."

Then, as if remembering something important, Feng Wuyu cautioned, "Junior Brother, currently within the sect, the Celestial Realm faction holds the upper hand. The majority of the True Disciples belong to their faction. We of the Nine Domains faction must remain united. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid conflict with them."

"Understood," Zhang Jing replied solemnly, his expression turning serious.

If Senior Brother Feng was emphasizing this, it meant the rift between the Celestial Realm faction and their Nine Domains faction was severe.

"I'm here to seek immortality—I just want to cultivate in peace. I'll stay out of these messy conflicts," Zhang Jing thought to himself.

Yet he knew better than to think he could avoid such factional struggles entirely. Whether he liked it or not, he was already branded as part of the Nine Domains faction.

Noticing Zhang Jing's grave expression, Feng Wuyu chuckled lightly. "Don't worry too much, Junior Brother. When the time comes, you must stand your ground. Though the Celestial Realm faction is strong, that doesn't mean our Nine Domains faction can be bullied. When all is said and done, the final outcome is still uncertain!"

His voice carried unwavering confidence.

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully.

At that moment, two streaks of light descended, revealing the same white-robed men—one tall and one short. Their faces were now pale with fear.

"We were blind! We didn't realize a True Disciple had arrived. Please forgive us!" they stammered.

"Can the Immortal Transformation Pool be opened now?" Feng Wuyu asked coolly, ignoring their apology.

"Yes, yes!" they hastily replied.

The taller man produced a jade talisman wreathed in white immortal light and hurried to a corner of the pool. Meanwhile, the shorter man approached Zhang Jing. "Junior Brother, you and your deer may enter the pool now."

Zhang Jing glanced at Feng Wuyu, who nodded in confirmation.

"Thank you," Zhang Jing said politely before stepping into the pool with Deer Thirty-Eight.

As they entered, the milky-white immortal liquid began to boil, and a brilliant white radiance erupted.

"Master, it hurts so much!" Deer Thirty-Eight wailed telepathically. "I'm dying! I won't be able to serve you anymore!"

"Quiet! It doesn't hurt that much—you're not going to die! How can a grown deer like you make such a fuss over a little pain? Have some dignity!" Zhang Jing scolded, though he himself was gritting his teeth against the agony.

At that moment, he resolved to remove Deer Thirty-Eight's spirit beast ring once they got out. Otherwise, the constant whining would be the death of him.

But truth be told, the process of completing his Dao laws felt like being torn apart at every level—body, mind, and soul—before being painstakingly reassembled. The torment surpassed all description, pushing Zhang Jing's consciousness to the brink of blankness.

After what felt like an eternity, the excruciating pain vanished abruptly, replaced by an instinctive surge of joy.

As his awareness returned, Zhang Jing examined his hands. Aside from his skin appearing slightly fairer, there seemed to be no other changes. His strength hadn't increased, nor had the spiritual energy in his dantian undergone any noticeable transformation.

Yet now, an indescribable sensation lingered in his heart—a sense of completion, as if all shackles had been removed and the path ahead lay unobstructed.
