# Chapter 84: Inspection Mission  

Over the next few days, the news of Chu Feifei rejecting invitations from inner sect disciples twice began to spread like wildfire. Many female disciples who considered themselves more outstanding than Chu Feifei harbored deep resentment toward her.  

At that moment, Chu Feifei seemed to become the common enemy of the Formation Peak's outer disciples. Her performance over the past few years had been witnessed by many, and naturally, jealousy had festered. Now that she was caught in the whirlpool of rumors, many took the opportunity to fan the flames, eager to tarnish her reputation.  

Such situations were quite common among outer disciples—even among inner disciples, similar conflicts arose.  

As for why Gu Mo hadn’t encountered such issues, the reason was simple: he had risen too quickly. His ascent was so rapid that before the outer disciples of the Spiritual Planting Hall could even feel jealous, they were already trying to curry favor with him, hoping to exchange more Spirit Water Rice from him.  

Chu Feifei paid no heed to the gossip outside. She focused solely on her cultivation, knowing that strength was the sharpest blade to cut through all malice.  

Her current goal was to break through to the third level of Qi Refining as soon as possible and receive the inheritance of a formation master. Once she officially became a formation master, she would be promoted from an outer disciple to an inner disciple.  

By then, the rumors would collapse on their own. After all, if it were discovered that outer disciples were maliciously slandering an inner disciple, the punishment would be severe.  

However, reaching the third level of Qi Refining would take Chu Feifei at least a year or two in her current state. Originally, it would have taken two or three years, but after Gu Mo’s perfected Cleansing Technique permanently erased a layer of dust obscuring her special constitution, her innate talent had improved.  

Breaking through in a year or two was already remarkably fast. But for Chu Feifei, caught in the storm of rumors, it still felt too slow. If she wanted to accelerate her progress further, she had only one option—to seek out Gu Mo and have him fully awaken her special constitution. Only then could she reach the third level of Qi Refining in the shortest time possible.  

Yet, given her current situation, with so many eyes watching her, approaching Gu Mo was out of the question. If discovered, it would drag him into the whirlpool as well.  

Thus, Chu Feifei had no choice but to look for another solution.  

And soon, an opportunity presented itself—a mission issued by Formation Peak’s Supervisor Lan Shuying: the inspection of the sect’s protective mountain array.  

Inspecting the protective mountain array was Formation Peak’s top-priority task. All other missions had to yield to it. Even other peaks had to cooperate fully with Formation Peak disciples conducting the inspection.  

The reason was simple—the protective mountain array was of utmost importance to the Qinglu Sect. With the sect’s founding ancestor deceased, the only thing safeguarding the Qinglu Sect now was this fourth-grade protective array.  

However, the inspection mission Supervisor Lan issued this time was not routine but a temporary one.  

Such temporary inspections typically didn’t involve critical nodes of the array, meaning even outer disciples could take on the task.  

Yet, the mission’s rank remained at the inner disciple level—the minimum requirement for protective array inspections. Thus, if an outer disciple successfully completed it, the rewards would be of inner disciple caliber.  

This time, Supervisor Lan offered the inheritance of a formation master as the reward for outer disciples.  

For Chu Feifei, this was a godsend. Given her current comprehension of formations, she was only one step away from becoming a true formation master. The inheritance would bridge that final gap.  

Without hesitation, Chu Feifei went to the mission hall and accepted the task. With her impeccable mission record over the years, there were no objections to her taking it.  

"Senior Sister Chu, don’t forget about me once you become an inner disciple," a junior outer disciple pleaded pitifully as Chu Feifei prepared to depart for the inspection.  

The junior had also applied for the mission but was rejected outright for lacking the necessary skills. Many outer disciples had been turned away this time, with only a handful making the cut.  

"You little fool, I wouldn’t dare let you run off—you’d get swindled in no time," Chu Feifei scolded half-heartedly.  

This junior was one of the few people in Formation Peak she could talk to. If she could lend a hand, Chu Feifei wouldn’t hesitate.  

Once ready, Chu Feifei headed to the assembly square. Her arrival drew many gazes, but she ignored them.  

"Let’s go."  

After a brief wait, Lan Shuying arrived. Her eyes briefly swept over Chu Feifei before she led the Formation Peak disciples to the mission area.  

Inspecting the protective mountain array wasn’t much different from inspecting other arrays—except for the higher standards.  

For example, array stones that wouldn’t need replacement in other formations had to be replaced here.  

"You’re responsible for replacing the array stones in this area. You handle this section…" Upon arrival, Lan Shuying efficiently assigned tasks.  

Chu Feifei received her designated zone and immediately set to work, carefully replacing the degraded array stones.  

Suddenly, as she removed one of the stones, the entire array trembled violently. A chain reaction followed—array stones shattered one after another, and the formation in that area began to collapse.  

"What’s happening?"  

Before Chu Feifei could react, Lan Shuying appeared and stabilized the array. Then, her gaze turned to Chu Feifei.  

"I—I…"  

Chu Feifei opened her mouth, at a loss. She had followed the manual precisely—why had the array suddenly failed?  

"State your name. Sabotaging the protective mountain array is a grave offense," Lan Shuying cut her off sharply.  

Chu Feifei froze. How had a routine mission turned into an accusation of sabotage?  

"Supervisor Lan, I swear I never intended to damage the array—" she pleaded frantically. If convicted of this crime, the lightest punishment would be expulsion from the sect.  

"How can I believe you?" Lan Shuying sighed in mock disappointment. "But given your past performance, I’ll give you one chance."  

"To prove your innocence, you must find someone of standing to vouch for you."  

Someone of standing—that meant at least an inner disciple. But as an outer disciple, who could Chu Feifei possibly know? Even if she begged an inner disciple, who would risk vouching for someone accused of sabotaging the protective array without any ties?  

In the end, Chu Feifei had only one option—Ye Yuqi, the inner disciple who had once extended an invitation to her.
