Chapter 90: Little Li Brother Really Can Take a Lot, Please Increase the Intensity

"Huh?"

Although Li Mo knew that Ying Bing didn't mean it that way, he still took a step back instinctively.

It was a habit he developed from reading too many novels in his past life, particularly those with plots involving a domineering female CEO falling in love with the protagonist.

"The day before yesterday, the Taiyin star was at its peak, and I'm still not fully recovered, so I can't control my internal energy completely," Ying Bing said in a calm tone, devoid of much emotion.

"If we're not separated by clothing, you might get hurt."

Li Mo felt a bit embarrassed, thinking he was overreacting. Ying Bing didn't seem to care, so why was he being so uptight?

"Okay," Li Mo said, removing his shirt.

The candlelight flickered, casting a warm glow on his now bare torso. The young Li Mo was no longer the weak, sickly young master he once was. His body was now toned, with well-defined muscles that hinted at his underlying strength. His height had also increased by a few centimeters, making him at least 1.8 meters tall.

Compared to those with naturally gifted physiques, Li Mo's body seemed more balanced and harmonious.

"Uh... pants?" Li Mo asked cautiously.

Ying Bing's expression remained serene, her eyes still like frosted jade. She didn't respond directly, leaving Li Mo to wonder what she meant.

Li Mo coughed lightly and sat down beside her, not feeling awkward. The scent of her fragrance wafted through the air, and he felt a slight itch on his shoulder, possibly from her hair.

As a normal male, Li Mo's most intimate experience with the opposite sex was limited to holding hands and hugging his high school girlfriend. Now, he was sitting next to a girl of unparalleled beauty, someone who could be described as "cheating" in terms of her looks, and they were both shirtless.

"Turn around," Ying Bing instructed.

Li Mo stiffly turned to face her. He saw that her hand was surrounded by a swirling blue aura, emitting an astonishing chill.

"My internal energy will enter your dantian," she explained. "Try to use your own internal energy to connect with it without getting hurt. If you can withstand it, we can proceed to the next step."

"Okay," Li Mo replied, collecting his scattered thoughts and focusing on her eyes.

He wasn't sure if he could succeed, as his internal energy had always disappeared when others tried to input their energy into him.

Ying Bing nodded slightly, and her icy palm gently touched Li Mo's dantian. A blue glow burst forth, transforming into tiny, swirling star points that danced across his body.

It felt cool, but much better than the experience on the arena. Moreover, her energy didn't disappear.

Ying Bing continued to input her energy, and Li Mo felt his body grow cold, as if he was submerged in an ice bucket. The chill wasn't painful, but it made his body feel stiff and numb.

However, Li Mo's physique was robust, so he didn't feel too uncomfortable. If an ordinary person were in his place...

Li Mo glanced at Ying Bing, who was focused intently on the task at hand. He couldn't help but think about the hardships she must have endured since childhood, which were likely far greater than what he was experiencing now.

"Focus," Ying Bing said softly, her tone firm.

Li Mo refocused, using the techniques from the "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh" to circulate his internal energy and envelop the blue energy in his dantian.

To his surprise, it wasn't as difficult as he expected. The two energies mixed and swirled together like dough, and he felt a sense of familiarity, as if he had done this many times before.

Ying Bing's eyes fluttered slightly as she sensed Li Mo's internal energy. She was surprised to find that he had more energy than she did, despite his relatively short cultivation time.

Moreover, Li Mo's dantian was incredibly resilient, like an abyss that seemed bottomless.

"Is it uncomfortable?" Ying Bing asked.

"Increase the intensity," Li Mo replied with a grin.

Ying Bing remained silent, continuing to input more energy into Li Mo.

Half an hour passed before she stopped.

"Why did you stop?" Li Mo asked, opening his eyes to look at her.

"I've run out of energy," Ying Bing replied, her expression serene.

Li Mo felt a bit puzzled. "I'm fine now," he said, having carefully assessed his condition.

In reality, Li Mo's main task was to control his internal energy to prevent it from overwhelming Ying Bing's.

The process wasn't as challenging as he expected, thanks to his robust physique.

"It's my turn now," Li Mo said.

Ying Bing nodded, indicating that she was ready.

As Li Mo input his energy into Ying Bing's dantian, she felt a stinging pain, despite his efforts to control it. The energy was filled with a primal, destructive intent.

Ying Bing's expression remained calm, but her face flushed slightly.

"Are you okay?" Li Mo asked softly, sensing her discomfort.

Ying Bing bit her lip, her eyes flashing with determination. "I'm fine," she replied.

Li Mo continued, pouring more energy into her dantian. The process was more challenging for Ying Bing, as Li Mo's energy was wild and unbridled.

As the night wore on, the two continued their cultivation, circulating their energies through various acupoints. Li Mo remained calm throughout, but Ying Bing occasionally trembled, her body reacting to the intense sensations.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they completed the first cycle of the "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh." Hundreds of acupoints had been traversed, and their energies were now intertwined.

"How do you feel?" Li Mo asked, his eyes shining with excitement.

"The effect is excellent," Ying Bing replied.

"Shall we continue?" Li Mo asked.

Ying Bing hesitated, knowing that prolonged exposure to foreign energy could be taxing on the body. However, with her physique, she could continue if needed.

"I'm a bit tired," she admitted. "Let's stop here."

Li Mo nodded, feeling exhausted himself. "Let's sleep," he said, lying down.

Ying Bing followed suit, closing her eyes as she waited for the arrival of the zi hour.

As Li Mo drifted off to sleep, Ying Bing felt a sense of relief wash over her. She knew that he wouldn't be able to continue the cultivation process again tonight.

Their first dual cultivation had come to an end.
