# Chapter 26: Market and Clan  

"Make a fortune?"  

Upon hearing Elder Bai's words, Zhang Yan's eyes lit up.  

He was extremely interested in spirit stones.  

"Indeed, your mastery of the Wood Element Technique is quite advanced. Several minor clans affiliated with our sect have come to us, seeking a group of Spirit Planters. They're offering a high price. You could give it a try," Elder Bai said with a smile.  

"Does it require leaving the sect?"  

"Forget it, that's too dangerous!"  

Zhang Yan, who had been enthusiastic moments ago, immediately shook his head upon hearing that he would need to leave the sect.  

The world of cultivation was far too perilous!  

He was still too weak and had no desire to take such risks.  

"..."  

Elder Bai was left speechless by Zhang Yan's excessive caution.  

He had seen timid people before, but never one as fearful as this!  

It bordered on pathological.  

"I must say, with this attitude, your path of cultivation won't be smooth! The most important thing in cultivation is resources. If you don’t fight for them, how can you progress?"  

"Elder Bai is right, but going outside is just too dangerous, and my cultivation level is still low," Zhang Yan replied, his expression clearly saying, "I hear you, but I’m still not going."  

"What are you afraid of?  

This is Tianmu Mountain. We’re disciples of the Qingheng Sect. Who would dare to act against us here?  

Besides, you’re just a measly Qi Refining second-stage cultivator. Killing you wouldn’t yield any benefits, and they’d still have to face the Qingheng Sect’s pursuit. What kind of rogue cultivator would be foolish enough to target you?" Elder Bai was almost amused by Zhang Yan’s paranoia. "Moreover, the clan’s residence is near the Qingheng Market. How could there be any danger?"  

"Oh?"  

"Near the Qingheng Market?"  

Hearing this, Zhang Yan’s eyes brightened.  

Within Tianmu Mountain, the Qingheng Sect reigned supreme.  

To facilitate trade with other factions and to extract resources from various forces, the sect had established the Qingheng Market.  

This market was guarded by a Golden Core Elder, making it extremely safe.  

It was practically home turf, so encountering danger was highly unlikely.  

Thus, Zhang Yan decided he could go.  

Another reason was the Qingheng Market itself.  

It was the largest market in the Tianmu Mountain Range, likely filled with all sorts of magical artifacts.  

Zhang Yan was very interested in such items.  

However, the Qingheng Market was not only far from the Qingheng Sect but also posed risks like encountering wild beasts and other unknown dangers along the way.  

Until now, Zhang Yan had only admired the market from afar.  

He hadn’t expected Elder Bai to offer him such a mission.  

A smile crept onto his face.  

"Alright, I’ll take this mission."  

"That’s more like it. The rewards for this mission are substantial—600 contribution points for just six months. If I were a Spirit Planter, I’d go myself," Elder Bai said.  

"That much?"  

Zhang Yan was stunned by the generous offer.  

With a righteous tone, he declared, "Elder Bai, contribution points aside, as a member of the Qingheng Sect, it’s my duty to help the sect in its time of need!"  

"..."  

Elder Bai stared at Zhang Yan, utterly speechless.  

Had he not witnessed Zhang Yan’s true nature earlier, he might have believed him!  

"Enough talk. First, heal this Frost Moon Orchid for me. Then, report to me the day after tomorrow, and we’ll set off together."  

"Understood!"  

As Elder Bai brought out the Frost Moon Orchid, Zhang Yan immediately cast the Wood Element Technique to heal it.  

"Spirit Planters like you make money so easily. Just three spells, and you’ve earned over a hundred spirit stones!" Elder Bai remarked with envy.  

Zhang Yan scoffed inwardly.  

Elder Bai only saw how easily he earned money but didn’t realize the effort he put into making it seem difficult!  

After healing the orchid, Elder Bai left in high spirits.  

Zhang Yan then went to the stone quarry to explain his situation and tidied up his valley.  

He would be away for six months and couldn’t let his spirit fields go to waste.  

In the end, he hired a few spirit farmers to tend to his fields.  

He wasn’t aiming to make a profit—just ensuring they didn’t fall into disrepair.  

Three days later, Zhang Yan packed everything he needed into his storage pouch and set off to meet the others.  

The Qingheng Sect had dispatched a total of thirteen Spirit Planters for this mission.  

That might seem like a small number, but it was actually quite impressive.  

Only a major sect like the Qingheng Sect could muster so many Spirit Planters at once.  

In the outside world, a single Spirit Planter could elevate a clan’s status.  

A second-tier Spirit Planter could even support an entire Foundation Establishment clan.  

Sending out thirteen Spirit Planters at once showed how seriously the Qingheng Sect took this mission.  

Thus, three Foundation Establishment cultivators were assigned to escort them.  

At the meeting point, Zhang Yan saw a massive flying ship in the distance.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Void Spirit Battleship  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Blue  
**[Equipment Effects]**: ???  

Seeing the enormous ship and its blue-tier quality, Zhang Yan couldn’t help but covet it.  

However, for some reason, the equipment effects were displayed as "???"  

"Sigh."  

Zhang Yan sighed.  

He guessed that the reason he couldn’t see the artifact’s attributes was because it already had an owner.  

Just like when he had tried to inspect Elder Bai’s flying artifact, he hadn’t been able to discern its effects either.  

"Please wait here, honored one. Once everyone arrives, we’ll depart."  

A disciple quickly approached Zhang Yan after verifying his identity token and escorted him to a private cabin on the ship.  

"Alright, you may leave."  

Zhang Yan waved the disciple away.  

The cabin wasn’t large or luxurious, but it was more than enough for one person.  

Before long, everyone had arrived, and the ship took off.  

It moved much faster than Zhang Yan’s Golden Bamboo Sword or Greenwood Boat.  

Standing by the window, Zhang Yan gazed at the blue skies and white clouds outside, watching the Qingheng Sect’s mountain gates grow distant.  

Since transmigrating to this world, he had never left the sect.  

Now, on his first journey beyond its borders, he felt a faint stirring in his heart.  

"Enough overthinking. Time to cultivate!"  

Shaking his head, Zhang Yan sat down to meditate.  

Since the mission involved multiple clans, each Spirit Planter was assigned to a different location.  

Zhang Yan was to go to the Liu Clan, the closest to the Qingheng Market.  

After three or four days aboard the ship, it finally descended near the Liu Clan’s territory.  

Two Foundation Establishment cultivators escorted Zhang Yan off the ship, where they were greeted by over a dozen robed figures.  

The leader, a white-haired elder with a radiant aura, was clearly a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

The others behind him were all at the late-stage Qi Refining realm.  

Yet, despite their strength, they regarded Zhang Yan and the others with unmistakable fear.
