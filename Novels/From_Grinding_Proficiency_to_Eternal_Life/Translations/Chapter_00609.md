# Chapter 609: Encircled and Killed

The pride of the Soul-Slaying Power, when it collided with Ye Yuan's Sword Intent, was like spring snow meeting the scorching sun—not a single bit could it shake.

Zhang Qiaoluo's face changed drastically. The vital energy in her body churned violently. The Soul-Slaying Pearl was connected to her soul; now that it had been shattered by a single sword strike, her sea of consciousness felt a piercing, needle-like pain, and she was forced to take several steps back involuntarily.

One sword!

With just one sword strike, combining the true meaning of the Shaking Star Splitting the Sea with his own overbearing and formidable, Sword Soul Profoundly Mysterious supreme Sword Intent, he simultaneously shattered Lu Chuan's awe-inspiring Commanding Clear Qi and Zhang Qiaoluo's sinister and bizarre Profound牝 Soul-Slaying Pearl.

"One sword破万法 (shatters ten thousand methods)!"

Sun Yue couldn't help but murmur, his expression incredibly complex.

Why was the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect known as the leader of the Righteous Path? It was because its sword cultivators were the first in the world in killing and warfare.

No matter how complex your arts or how bizarre your divine abilities, no matter if you draw upon the heavens and earth or specifically target the Primordial Spirit, I need only one sword. With absolute speed and strength, and a supreme Sword Intent that penetrates the core of the Dao's principles, I sever its core and dismantle its structure. Once the source of power is cut off from its foundation, it is like a tree without roots, collapsing instantly.

Xu Yunfan, witnessing this scene, his pupils shrank to the size of pinpricks.

Lu Chuan and Zhang Qiaoluo were top figures even among late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Was their full-force attack truly so easily shattered?!

The last lingering thought in his heart completely vanished. He knew that today, victory could not be achieved through single combat or conventional siege tactics.

Almost at the moment Ye Yuan's Sword Intent was at its peak, just after shattering the combined attack of the two, when his mind was focused on what was ahead and his vital energy was just beginning to recede from its peak—old force spent, new force about to be born—Xu Yunfan seized this opportunity in an instant.

"Activate the formation!"

Xu Yunfan roared, his hands instantly forming seals, leaving afterimages from their speed.

The vast, ocean-like spiritual power within him was poured without reservation into the core eye of the great formation that had already been connected.

BOOM RUMBLE!!

The originally peaceful valley instantly transformed into a Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.

The power of the formation, forcibly suppressed by karmic secret techniques, at this moment, like an ancient ferocious beast breaking free of its restraints, bared its savage fangs.

The sky suddenly darkened. It was not that dark clouds had appeared from nowhere, but that the firmament and the great sun were obscured by a rapidly rotating vortex of thunder, shining with piercing purple and white light.

Countless purple and white electric snakes gathered and intertwined within the vortex, unleashing an earth-shaking roar of destruction.

It was as if the world was being ended.

Within the formation, the Divine Celestial Domain Thunder, capable of cleansing all filth and evil in the world, was rapidly evolved.

The thunder did not pour down immediately, but condensed into thick, water-jar-sized pillars of purple and white light, radiating an aura of annihilation. Then, under the牵引 of Xu Yunfan's hand seals, like a judgment from the heavens, they targeted the white figure in the valley with clear purpose.

They bombarded down in a狂轰滥炸 (fierce bombardment).

Each thunder pillar struck an extremely cunning position, subtly sealing off all possible evasion routes for Ye Yuan from all directions.

The ground also trembled violently.

The ground veins' evil qi, originally locked by the formation, now transformed into thousands of thick, ink-black, purple-black evil dragons, surging madly from the crevices of rocks and the depths of the earth.

These evil qi dragons carried a terrifying power that could make one sink into chaos and defile the soul, roaring as they coiled towards Ye Yuan, forming layer upon layer of a Yin-Yang domain force field around him, thick and sticky as a mire.

Then, they frantically pulled and entangled Ye Yuan's form and the operation of the spiritual power within his body.

The most dangerous, however, were those intangible fluctuations that made everyone present feel a sense of dread and unease.

The "Chaos Soul Domain" was activated!

Yin evil qi intertwined with the invisible mind-thunder.

What is mind-thunder? It is the power to confuse the spirit.

These formed countless shockwaves targeting the very origin of the soul, penetrating directly to the Purple Mansion Sea of Consciousness.

They would evoke the deepest fears, resentments, and even all the negative emotional thoughts of madness in a person's heart, simultaneously accompanied by a bone-piercing cold and mind-freezing mind-thunder bombardment.

Once struck, the lightest consequence was a confused mind and inaccurate movements; the severe consequence was the soul being torn apart, leading to madness and self-destruction.

This was the true hidden killing move of the "Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos Soul Overturning Evil Formation," and the origin of the name "Chaos Soul."

Trinity, Yin and Yang mutually supporting, sealing the physical body, grinding away the soul, and guiding the heavenly punishment.

Just as the great formation erupted abruptly, thunder light and evil qi roared, about to engulf Ye Yuan, while the Chaos Soul power followed like a shadow, frantically impacting his soul in this critical moment—

Two long-prepared, fierce killing intents finally erupted at the perfect moment.

Sun Yue, this seemingly heroic, mountain-like body-refining cultivator, moved at the moment Ye Yuan shattered Lu Chuan and Zhang Qiaoluo's combined attack, when old force had declined and new force had not yet risen.

And at the moment his mind was牵制 by the sudden, violent bombardment of the great formation.

The muscles over his entire body completed the transformation from stillness to explosion in an instant. The knotted muscles emitted a dull sound of friction like stone on metal, bones crackled, the blood and energy around his body surged like mercury, and a faint layer of golden light even appeared on his surface.

This golden light was the manifestation of blood and energy after tempering the physique to its extreme.

He had no fancy moves, nor any lengthy preparation.

His entire body, like a spring compressed to its limit, suddenly exploded. His left foot stomped the ground fiercely.

THUD!!!

Centered on his feet, the solid ground, as if trampled by an ancient giant elephant, saw spiderweb-like cracks suddenly spread for dozens of miles.

Gravel and dust were directly shaken into the air by the terrifying force.

Relying on this violent recoil, Sun Yue's body, like a giant cannonball fired from a muzzle, tore through the air, emitting a scalp-numbing sonic boom.

His palm-sized right fist rose and thrust out.

Where the fist peak passed, the air was forcibly squeezed and displaced by the extreme speed and strength, forming a visible milky white cone-shaped shockwave.

The aura of this fist was simple, direct, and brutal to the extreme. Carrying the will of a mountain collapsing and crushing everything, it blasted directly towards Ye Yuan's right lower ribs.

"Ten Thousand Calamities Indestructible Giant Spirit Battle True Art, Inverted Mountain."

Almost in the same instant as Sun Yue's explosion.

In the shadow behind Ye Yuan, a point of shadow that had almost completely blended into the ambient darkness writhed slightly.

Mo Qisha's figure emerged like a ghost.

He seemed to have long since calculated the appearance of this fatal moment. Using the huge energy fluctuations and chaotic light and shadow from Xu Yunfan's great formation explosion as the perfect cover, he launched his long-planned assassination at the instant Ye Yuan's entire perception was filled with Heavenly Thunder, Earthly Evil Qi, and Chaos Soul power.

Mo Qisha held a short sword entirely black, as if it could absorb all light.

This sword had no edge, but it radiated an extremely dangerous, condensed to the extreme aura of soul-slaying.

It was his lifebound artifact, the Shadow Seven Extinction Sword.

It could be seen that Mo Qisha had no redundant movements. His entire body, along with the short sword in his hand, transformed into a speed that surpassed the limit of thought, condensing all his power, and even his spirit and energy, onto the sword tip.

He held a sword, but did not walk the path of the sword.

He followed the path of the assassin, focused on assassination—one strike not landing, flee ten thousand miles.

This thrust was silent and soundless, without any breaking of the air, nor did it cause any changes in light and shadow.

Sword Gang was silent, killing was formless.
