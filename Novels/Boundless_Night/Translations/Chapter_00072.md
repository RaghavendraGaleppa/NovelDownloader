# Chapter 72: Almost Playing Dead

At this time of year, earth mist ascended, light rain scattered across the wilderness, and the heavy dark clouds in the sky became visible. The first rumbles of spring thunder echoed, accompanied by faint flashes of lightning in the distance.

With a whoosh, a large crowd of people, both men and women, appeared beside Qin Ming, rushing into the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall, all looking extremely nervous.

“What’s the rush? The spring thunder has just begun; there’s still some time before the real 'boom.' How the celestial phenomena evolve depends on the earth glow,” said the seventy-two-year-old Old Man Zhao, who had truly arrived. He had mentioned at the Drunken Mist Pavilion that he intended to risk his life in the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall this year, hoping for rejuvenation.

“You young ones are still too green. You don’t frequent the fire fields, observe the earth mist, or discern the seasons. Although the light rain from the fire springs dormant underground has already stirred the celestial phenomena, it still lacks some crucial timing.”

A group of old men walked in, having already put on their burial shrouds, making the young people in the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall feel quite morbid and unlucky.

“Don’t rush, we definitely have to wait. Everyone still has time to write their wills, grab some food and drink. Don't shortchange yourselves before you go, and you can even ponder whether you really want to die.”

Led by Old Man Zhao, over a dozen old fellows, in addition to wearing burial shrouds and jade ornaments, also carried some of their favorite belongings, ready to "take them with them."

“Are you planning to cremate yourselves using the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall?” a bearded man with a short temper asked, feeling somewhat offended by the display.

“Young man, are you upset? Old man here means no harm. Based on past experience, it’s good if one person out of several can survive. Chances are, we’re destined to be companions on the Yellow Springs Road, so let’s get to know each other and build some good relations beforehand.”

The young people stared blankly, because although these words were unpleasant, they were indeed the truth.

“I should have worn gold and silver too, if I had known. If I die here, at least I wouldn’t have wronged myself,” a young man sighed.

Just then, an old man with almost no teeth asked the people outside the hall, “Has my golden nanmu coffin been brought over?”

The young people in the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall were speechless. These old fellows probably had their burial objects and even their graves arranged already.

“Don’t be strangers, everyone. Come, let’s share some wine and dishes. We are comrades in death; we are all our own people,” another old man called out, having already ordered plenty of fine wine and delicious food to be brought in.

The young people remained silent, feeling that they were far less open-minded than these old folks, who seemed to view life as a grand dream, ready to depart calmly and end this existence with equanimity.

“Since you’ve prepared your burial shrouds and coffins, knowing there’s little hope, why still come here to suffer? Wouldn’t it be better to avoid being struck by lightning and keep your bodies intact?”

“How would we know if we don’t try? What if it works? In this world, nothing is certain. Who doesn't want to be that 'one'?”

A group of people sat down. They counted carefully, a total of sixty-nine people, roughly the same as in previous years. The comrades in death let loose; regardless of gender or age, they all began to eat and drink. Some even started reminiscing about their past.

Qin Ming kept glancing outside the golden hall. Where had the corpse collector Xu Sheng found for him gone? He hoped it wouldn’t mess up the important business; he felt a bit unreliable.

“Young man, you look quite young. Why have you come to risk your life so early?” an old man asked.

At this time, Qin Ming’s long black hair was disheveled, covering most of his face, and his face was dirty, but the old man still sensed that he was very young.

Qin Ming sighed, “I have no choice. A thousand-year-old monstrous beast from afar is staring at me coldly, and I don't know what it intends to do. If I don’t raise my life level quickly, I won’t be able to control my own destiny.”

Anyway, everyone was about to be separated by life and death, so whatever he said now didn’t matter.

“Boy, you’re only fifteen or sixteen, even younger. Why are you here?” Old Man Zhao asked a dull-looking boy beside him.

The boy, named Qian Cheng, said blankly, “They say I’m stupid, always bullying and beating me, forcing me to do things for them. I don’t want to be kicked or slapped anymore. Anyway, Grandma has passed away, and I’m all alone, so I came here to try my luck.”

“This… alas! Child, leave this place. You can come to my home; I’ll arrange a job for you feeding horses,” Old Man Zhao said.

“No, being pitied, that kindness will always be consumed by time,” the dull boy Qian Cheng said.

Qin Ming was surprised, feeling that he wasn’t stupid at all.

“The spring thunder has already sounded, why isn’t it striking yet? This is torture!” a fierce, tattooed big man exclaimed, looking like a prisoner.

Noticing the strange looks from others, he explained, “Don’t look. I’m a death row inmate. They sent me here to withstand the lightning. If I survive, I won’t be executed.”

“This is a thunder-fed subject, thunder-flesh!” an old man whispered softly.

“What did you say?” the big man asked.

“Every year, nobles do this: they send condemned prisoners in. Some heavenly light can still remain on their bodies, and later, the corpses are used to feed alien creatures.”

“And it’s not always fed to alien creatures. Those with good appetites, who are fierce enough, might even eat it themselves.”

When the fierce big man heard these words, he instantly felt terrible, slumping onto the ground. This was even worse than waiting for an execution!
Now, first he was going to be struck by lightning, and then either fed to alien creatures or end up in the bellies of old nobles. It was truly too tragic.

“No, I’m not doing this! I’m leaving the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall!” He stood up and shouted.

“What are you yelling about? Your family has already taken the money, and your son has entered the academy. Are you going to go back on your word now?” Someone approached from a distance.

The big man slumped back down, motionless and silent.

Clearly, he was not an isolated case. Over a dozen people in the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall looked ashen, having been sent in by nobles or wealthy individuals.

After eating and drinking his fill, Qin Ming went back to retrieve treasures from the black emotional sea. It didn't matter if he couldn’t find any, because he discovered that he could train his willpower in such "torrential waves."

“Hmm?” When he stopped caring and treated this resonance as a form of cultivation, something unexpected happened: he encountered a very strong fluctuation.

In this pitch-black emotional sea, a young man roared, his entire body emitting a faint silver light.

“I refuse to accept this! I survived two spring thunders, and I’m stronger in my third year, yet I’m going to die here? Why is the otherworldly heavenly light descending with the thunderfire so intense this time?!”

In the scene before him, the young man’s hair stood on end. He was circulating a strange force, resisting the heavenly light's erosion.

Around him, corpses lay everywhere, some pitch-black, others fiery red. Some bodies were even torn apart by the heavenly light, like a corner of hell.

“What a pity. I only mastered Explosive Force, not true Thunder Force. I truly resent this! My sect’s supreme technique was about to be revealed to me, yet for quick breakthroughs, I advanced too hastily and ruined my brilliant future.”

All these were his thoughts in his final moments. By then, he was paralyzed and couldn't escape at all.

The young man regretted and blamed himself, but at the last moment, he cast aside negative emotions. Every pore on his body erupted with explosive force like electric arcs, exerting all his might to resist the heavenly light.

“I will endure this!”

Then, he exploded, dying a very gruesome death.

Qin Ming felt as if he had experienced it firsthand; his hair stood on end. It was too bloody and tragic.

Afterward, he began to practice that Explosive Force in the golden hall. This force was very powerful, and from it, the famous Thunder Force could be evolved.

Qin Ming was surprised; Explosive Force was actually a composite force, integrating several types of heavenly light forces, with immense power. When unleashed inside a monstrous beast’s body, it would cause a large area of flesh and blood to rupture.

“Little Qin, it’s not too late to back out now,” Xu Sheng arrived, clearly disguised and looking completely different from his usual self. He also brought along the corpse collector, who had almost overslept.

Qin Ming shook his head and whispered that his condition had never been better, having initially mastered the Sun family's Hammer Force and Whip Force.

He had already been candid with Xu Sheng earlier, as he needed to instruct the corpse collector to pull him out of the golden hall immediately, dead or alive, after he had received four streams of heavenly light.

The spring thunder rumbled, echoing in the distance.

After two more days, true electrical flashes began to appear above this area. Light rain pattered, and earth mist ascended across the wilderness, making the world exceptionally dazzling, almost like daytime.

Many people came to Mount Chixia, knowing that every year at this time, after the spring thunder erupted, people would line up here to die.

Many came to observe this "wonder" and join the commotion. Of course, some nobles were also waiting for their "thunder-flesh" to be carried out.

The Mountain God Temple was once again packed with people, all watching the lightning on Mount Chixia.

Finally, the spring thunder descended, exploding above the Thunderfire Alchemist Hall. On the bright, shining metal tiles, electric arcs intertwined, dazzling beyond belief, and thunderfire balls rolled, creating a terrifying spectacle.

The most frightening was the otherworldly heavenly light, descending with the lightning, incredibly brilliant. It could penetrate buildings and enter the mountain body.

The Thunderfire Alchemist Hall's structure was very precise; it could conduct electricity and weaken thunder, but it struggled to resist the otherworldly heavenly light.

The heavenly light and thunderfire combined, nurturing an incredibly rare spiritual substance, which was carried along and fell into the golden hall.

Qin Ming witnessed it firsthand. After the first wave of thunderfire heavenly light, half the people collapsed. Some had black faces and were motionless, while others had skin so red they looked cooked.

Qin Ming was awestruck. He indeed felt the violence of the heavenly light; upon entering his body, it felt like boiling water flowing, threatening to cook him.

With a crash, when the second wave of heavenly light fell, few people remained standing in the golden hall. Qin Ming saw the seventy-two-year-old Old Man Zhao explode.

When the third wave of heavenly light arrived, Qin Ming felt intense pain throughout his body. He promptly lay down, not wanting to appear too unusual, as everyone else had collapsed. Besides, he could still receive the heavenly light and spiritual substances while on the ground.

Far away outside, people had already begun pulling ropes, and cries could be heard, indicating that their loved ones in the hall hadn't made it.

When the fourth wave of heavenly light descended, the golden hall was like a hell. Some corpses that hadn't been pulled out in time were torn apart by the heavenly light. Near Qin Ming, Old Man Zhao’s leg lay, along with another old man’s arm, their broken burial shrouds burnt beyond recognition.

The otherworldly heavenly light was indeed terrifying, posing a threat even to Qin Ming. At the same time, he sensed a rich spiritual substance entering his body.

He circulated the art from the silk book, regulating his body's state and channeling the heavenly light for his own use. This otherworldly heavenly light could merge with the heavenly light born within himself.

Suddenly, Qin Ming felt something was wrong. The fifth wave of heavenly light had already descended, so why hadn't the corpse collector made a move? He saw half of Old Man Zhao, who was also a thrice-reborn, being dragged away, while he himself was still lying here.

What was that corpse collector doing? Qin Ming wanted to curse!

Then, the sixth wave of thunderfire heavenly light, mixed with rare spiritual substances, fell. Qin Ming grew agitated. Did that guy truly want to send him to his death?
He couldn't take it anymore and was ready to jump up and run.

He was a living person; he couldn't possibly be tormented to death by an unreliable corpse collector. At worst, he’d just stop being low-key.

From a distance, someone spoke to Qin Ming’s corpse collector: “Brother, we’ve all pulled out our employers, whether complete or incomplete. We’ve done our best. Why haven’t you made a move yet?”

“They’re not going to live anyway, so sooner or later it’s all the same. But I guess I should pull him out to prevent him from being completely shattered. Don't want the family of the deceased causing trouble and cutting my wages,” the corpse collector finally made a move.

Qin Ming was about to sit up at this point; he couldn’t help but look like he was playing dead. Once he got out, he was going to chop that corpse collector into pieces!

Just as he was about to rise, the special material rope around his waist tightened, beginning to drag him out. He gritted his teeth and endured it!
Then, he wanted to curse again. Why was the rope being pulled so slowly? Had they not eaten? He really wanted to kill that corpse collector.

When the seventh wave of thunderfire heavenly light fell, Qin Ming was affected by some of the "tail light," finally being dragged out of the main hall.

He immediately activated his secret art, Harmonizing Light with Dust, and began to play dead.

Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief. With such abundant spiritual substance entering his body, the fourth rebirth should be no problem, and he would regain those lost memories.
