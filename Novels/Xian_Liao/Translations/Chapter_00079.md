**Chapter 79: Spiritual Medicine**  

At Qingfu Temple, after consuming several elixirs bestowed by Zhou Qing, the rooster Mao Ri regained its vigor, proudly strutting with a small snake in its beak as it followed Zhou Qing up the mountain.  

"Little Uncle, are you planning to awaken Master and the other elders?"  

Zhou Qing nodded. "Over these past days, your continuous recitation of the 'Heart-Cleansing Mantra' has shown some improvement in their madness. I now intend to attempt using the Immortal Crane Needles to briefly restore their lucidity."  

To administer the needles, the two elder Taoists first needed to be subdued. Zhou Qing decided to start with the easier target.  

"Senior Brother Fu Song, it's your turn. Stop looking around."  

Zhou Qing instructed Zhi Shan to lead Fu Shan away, leaving Fu Song standing there in confusion.  

Seeing that Fu Song ignored him, Zhou Qing let out a tiger's roar. His divine sense manifested the ferocious tiger's aura, revealing his killing intent.  

"Good! The 'Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm'!"  

Zhou Qing blocked Fu Song's palm strike, inwardly marveling at the mastery behind it. Though Zhou Qing had also learned this technique, Fu Song embodied its essence far more profoundly.  

The training grounds echoed with the sounds of their clashes—tiger roars and dragon cries intertwined.  

Fu Song unleashed the full might of the 'Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm,' each strike carrying the force to subdue dragons.  

Zhou Qing countered with the 'Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist,' his movements simple yet refined, leaving Fu Song feeling constrained at every turn.  

"Senior Brother, your skills are truly impressive!" Zhou Qing praised.  

Fu Song's face darkened. "You little brat, are you mocking me?"  

Zhou Qing chuckled. "Not at all. I genuinely admire your mastery."  

Fu Song snorted. "If you really admire me, then why don't you let me land a solid hit?"  

Zhou Qing smiled but didn’t respond. Instead, he intensified his assault, pushing Fu Song to his limits.  

Soon, Fu Song was overwhelmed. Zhou Qing seized the moment, using the 'Diamond Indestructible Divine Skill' to absorb Fu Song's strike and then twisting his arms with the 'Dragon-Capturing Hand,' immobilizing him.  

With Fu Song subdued, Zhou Qing swiftly inserted golden needles into his acupoints.  

After a while, Fu Song slowly regained consciousness.  

"Senior Brother, you're awake!"  

Fu Song rubbed his head, disoriented. "What happened?"  

Zhou Qing explained the situation, and Fu Song sighed. "I see. My lucidity won’t last long—perhaps half an hour at most. We must act quickly."  

Zhou Qing nodded. "Indeed. I need your help to subdue Senior Brother Fu Shan next."  

Fu Song hesitated. "But... he's far stronger than me. What if he loses control?"  

Zhou Qing reassured him. "Don’t worry. Even in his madness, he won’t strike you with lethal force. Besides, I'll be there to assist."  

Reluctantly, Fu Song agreed.  

When they confronted Fu Shan, the latter’s overwhelming aura made Fu Song hesitate.  

"Zhi Shan, step aside."  

Zhou Qing activated his divine sense, manifesting the tiger's aura once more. Fu Shan, sensing the threat, instinctively retaliated.  

The battle was fierce. Even with Fu Song acting as a shield, Zhou Qing struggled to subdue Fu Shan, his qi and blood churning from the counterattacks.  

Finally, Zhou Qing managed to knock Fu Shan unconscious with a decisive strike.  

"Senior Brother, your strength is truly formidable," Zhou Qing admitted, panting.  

Fu Shan, now lucid, shook his head. "You flatter me. Your potential far surpasses mine. Once your qi and blood fully transform, none of us will be your match."  

Zhou Qing smiled. "Let’s not dwell on that. We have more pressing matters."  

He then presented the small snake Mao Ri had captured.  

Fu Shan’s eyes widened. "A Blood Python Snake! How did you catch this?"  

Zhou Qing explained the creature’s origins. The Blood Python Snake was a highly venomous creature, capable of weakening even innate-level experts.  

"Can this snake lead us to the Spirit Ginseng?" Zhou Qing asked.  

Fu Shan nodded. "It’s possible. This snake is intelligent. Try communicating with it using your divine sense."  

Zhou Qing focused his mind, projecting the image of a fierce tiger into the snake’s consciousness. The young snake, its will still weak, quickly submitted.  

Through their mental link, Zhou Qing learned that the Spirit Ginseng’s original habitat had been taken over by a fire-red crane capable of breathing flames and piercing solid rock with its talons. The snake had barely escaped with its life.  

"If we can secure that location, our temple can cultivate its own spiritual herbs," Fu Shan mused.  

Zhou Qing agreed. "But first, we must deal with that crane."  

The three of them began strategizing. With their combined strength, they stood a chance against the formidable creature.  

As they prepared for the upcoming battle, Zhou Qing couldn’t help but feel a surge of determination. The path ahead was dangerous, but the rewards—greater power and longevity—were worth the risk.
