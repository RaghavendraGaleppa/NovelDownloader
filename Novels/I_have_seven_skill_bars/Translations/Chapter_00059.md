# Chapter 59: The Pros and Cons of a Spirit Farmer

Ding Rui's eyes lit up, and he nodded furiously, "Good, good!"

Liu Yun shifted into a more comfortable position, shaking his head with a somewhat helpless smile, "Being a spirit farmer isn't easy!"

He first sighed, then began, "Although I knew a lot about spirit farmers before, it wasn't until I actually started doing it that I realized how difficult it truly is. After all, it was my suggestion for you to become a spirit farmer. Naturally, I have to take responsibility now. Otherwise, if you were crushed by the pressure, regretted becoming a spirit farmer, or even decided not to be one anymore, wouldn't I have made you waste all that time for nothing? If it weren't for needing to cultivate five cultivation methods to become a spirit farmer, with your ability to acquire resources and your talent, you would probably have reached the third level of Qi Refinement by now, or even established your foundation."

Ding Rui quickly waved his hand and shook his head, "No, no, don't worry, Brother Liu, how could I blame you? I chose to be a spirit farmer because I felt it suited me better. After losing my memory, I don't understand many things well. The only things I truly understand are everything in the spirit fields. So, being a spirit farmer is the most suitable choice for me right now. Even if you didn't say anything, I would have chosen to become a spirit farmer after thinking about it myself."

"Haha!" Liu Yun looked at Ding Rui, satisfied with the answer. "However, what needs to be said must be said. Although being a spirit farmer is very stressful, the benefits are incomparable to those of ordinary spirit field cultivators. In some special aspects, even outer sect disciples can't compare!"

"Like what aspects?" Ding Rui's eyes brightened; what he cared about most was coming.

It only sets requirements for the harvest. As long as a spirit farmer can provide enough spirit rice or other cultivated plants to the sect at harvest time to fulfill their quota, all other aspects of their work and lives, spirit farmers can arrange independently! So, it can be said that spirit farmers have much greater freedom in arranging their own time than outer sect disciples. There are no fixed working hours, no fixed rest periods, and even no completely fixed tasks. A spirit farmer can stay in their spirit field whenever they wish, and leave whenever they wish, without anyone questioning it, as long as they fulfill the resource quota required by the sect!

This is undoubtedly the greatest benefit of being a spirit farmer. However, this benefit naturally requires strength to enjoy. Under normal circumstances, in fact, many spirit farmers live lives that are even less comfortable than ordinary spirit field cultivators, and naturally far inferior to outer sect disciples. Although spirit farmers can arrange their time freely, bearing the entire burden of the spirit field's harvest alone is not that easy. Many spirit farmers end up spending a lot of time in their spirit fields just to ensure they can deliver enough resources to the sect while also securing a greater profit for themselves.

And, as an ordinary spirit field cultivator, even if one person can complete the work of ten, their harvest reward is still only the equivalent of ten individuals. Compared to a spirit farmer, this is far inferior. Because, for an entire spirit field, the total harvest reward for all cultivators combined only accounts for 20% of the entire spirit field's harvest. A spirit farmer, however, only needs to hand over one million grains of spirit rice to the sect during each harvest. All other harvest exceeding one million grains belongs entirely to the spirit farmer!

This was also the second major benefit of becoming a spirit farmer that Liu Yun told Ding Rui. If a cultivator is strong enough, they can completely use their identity as a spirit farmer to legitimately acquire enormous amounts of resources! Even far more than the resources earned by most outer sect disciples through their work! If the spirit field yields an excellent harvest, it can easily reach a quantity of two million grains of spirit rice. In this way, after handing over one million grains to the sect, the spirit farmer themselves can keep a full one million grains of spirit rice. This is something most outer sect disciples cannot obtain in a year, while a spirit farmer only needs one growing season, four months.
