**My Undying Cheat - Chapter 204: Blood River Boils!**

Boom!

Above the Burial Tome, an flickering, blood-red spear was forming. Its tip pulsed with sanguine brilliance, chaotic vital energy surged, and a sweet, metallic scent pervaded the air. The Blood River visibly shrank by an entire circle, showing that the Burial Tome had truly poured its essence into preparing this attack.

The human-skinned man from the Border Prison, seated cross-legged beneath the Burial Tome, remained unmoved, as if oblivious to everything. Runes leaped from his mouth, refining the Burial Tome.

"Where do you think you're going!" Puzhi roared, and two more illusory figures stepped out from his body. The three figures each moved towards one of the three remains. Although these three remains had fallen to the Dao Lord realm due to years without vital energy replenishment, they were once Heavenly Venerate-level existences, and supreme experts among Heavenly Venerates, still retaining some residual power. Puzhi had only reached the Heavenly Venerate realm through special means, not as a true Heavenly Venerate. While he held the upper hand, he couldn't completely overwhelm them.

"Samsara Fist!" Majestic and vast fist intent surged. One of Puzhi's illusory figures clenched his hand into a fist, as if opening a path to Samsara, intending to send these remains to rebirth. The three remains looked nearly identical, making it impossible to distinguish between them. The remains enveloped by the Samsara Fist glowed with dark light. Mysterious symbols blossomed on its body, only a few scattered ones, yet they emanated unimaginable radiance, possessing an ancient and profound aura no less than Puzhi's.

Clang! The fist collided with the dark light runes, producing a metallic clang. Although it only blocked for an instant, it obstructed most of the attack's power. Puzhi's fist struck the remains' body, yet it felt like hitting a wad of cotton. This was a unique property of these remains; their physical bodies could diminish most of the power from physical attacks. Even so, the remains were still sent flying far back. The little vital energy it had just absorbed was also scattered, erupting into a mist of blood in the void, only to retract and be reabsorbed. Similar events occurred in the other two directions. All three sets of remains were temporarily halted, unable to approach the ancient city.

At this moment, three blood-red spears had fully formed above the Burial Tome. They were like crystalline blood jade, translucent and etched with mysterious patterns. A mere glance was enough to induce a feeling of dizziness. The entire Blood River had shrunk further. Compared to what Zhoutian had just seen, it was almost a quarter smaller, indicating how much essence was contained within these three blood-red spears.

Buzz! The blood-red spears trembled, humming. The void vibrated. Puzhi felt a chill in his brow, as if he had been targeted by some great malevolent entity.

Whoosh! The three blood-red spears transformed into streams of sanguine light, piercing through space. Puzhi's expression shifted slightly as his three fragmented figures recombined into one. Originally, two of the spears were aimed at Puzhi's other two illusory figures. Now that the three had merged into one, those two spears also changed direction, heading directly for the sole Puzhi.

Puzhi formed the Vase Seal, manifesting his Glazed Body. His form radiated light, and a colossal, golden, almost corporeal Buddha phantom appeared behind him. Low chants echoed in the void, as if praising something.

"Flower-Plucking Finger!" Puzhi extended a finger, and the colossal Buddha also stretched out a gigantic, glazed Buddha finger. Vast Buddhist intent permeated the air, and golden lotuses blossomed in the void, their fragrance filling the surroundings. This was an exceptionally powerful finger technique, even now considered a great divine ability within Luotian Temple, not easily imparted.

Boom! The Buddha finger collided with the blood-red spears, creating a massive explosion. Energy was annihilated, the void collapsed, and a blood-red storm erupted, sweeping across the area like a tornado. The golden lotuses in the void spun continuously, forming a mysterious formation to suppress the sanguine tempest.

However, at this moment, an arrogant and vast aura erupted. One of the remains seized the opening while Puzhi was obstructed, bursting with speed and charging into the ancient city. The moment these remains entered the ancient city, the Burial Tome began to riot, like a drowning man clutching at a straw. The Burial Tome itself was merely an extraordinary treasure. While more powerful than ordinary artifacts, possessing unimaginable might, even surpassing some Heavenly Venerate artifacts, it was still just a treasure. When it was being refined, it had no means to resist. To escape this predicament, it could only rely on external aid, which were these three remains of Wutian – its lifeline.

Boom! The Blood River churned with ten thousand waves. Black steles radiated light, attempting to suppress it. Divine steles inscribed with strange scenes descended one after another, but to no avail. Endless blood-red runes erupted.

Bang! A black stele exploded, its inscribed patterns completely obliterated, losing all power. Subsequently, one black stele after another exploded. The great formation of countless steles suppressing this place completely lost its power and shattered.

The Burial Tome emitted an eerie, blood-red glow. A massive surge of blood churned up from the Blood River, pouring into the body of the remains. The shriveled body of the remains began to fill with blood, swelling up. Blood-red runes lit up across its form, and its aura grew stronger and more sinister. The external damage on its skin was repairing, yet the massive sword mark on its chest remained unhealed, as if some strange energy was obstructing it.

Huang Qi and Saint Demon's expressions changed, and they were about to step forward to interrupt. These remains were about to reach the Heavenly Venerate realm by absorbing vital energy; it would be troublesome then.

"Do not interfere!" At this moment, the person from the Border Prison, seated beneath the Burial Tome, suddenly transmitted a message, stopping the two. Zhoutian and the other two looked at that person, unsure why he was stopping them. Zhoutian also heard his voice in his mind, so he knew it was the Border Prison individual who had stopped Saint Demon and Huang Qi.

"These three remains were left by Wutian. Back then, he had nearly broken through the Heavenly Venerate realm, reaching an extreme. In his prime, these remains were similar to him in cultivation. Even though they have now fallen to the Dao Lord realm, they still contain a trace of divinity. You cannot stop them; you might lose your lives. The Burial Tome has a spirit. Knowing it's about to be refined, it's retaliating at all costs. Puzhi is held back, and I cannot act for now. This momentum is now unstoppable, unless one of you can unleash Heavenly Venerate combat power. Even then, it's only a possibility that you might hinder it slightly. The foundation of these remains is still there; they cannot be underestimated or treated merely as Dao Lords."

Zhoutian's gaze flickered. He could indeed unleash Heavenly Venerate combat power, but he had just witnessed Puzhi's struggle against these three remains; it was not a crushing victory.

"However, there is also good news. Previously, the Burial Tome was aided by the Blood River, making its refinement extremely difficult. But now, if the Blood River weakens, my refinement speed will increase severalfold. Once I've refined the Burial Tome, these remains will all perish!"
