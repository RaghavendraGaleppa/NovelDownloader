Chapter 114: The Way of Consuming Essence, Congenital Body Washing

Li Xian received the order and immediately went to receive the punishment. Everything comes at a price. The "Way of Consuming Essence" could be bought with twenty heavy strokes—a privilege many sought but could not obtain.

"Use the switch," Lady Wen added softly.

"Yes!" Li Xian gritted his teeth.

This suffering would be no small ordeal.

Lady Wen watched his retreating figure, a smile playing on her lips. She weighed the pros and cons in her mind: "This boy is sixteen, full of youthful vigor, and even has strange dreams at night. It is perfectly normal. By having him take the punishment now, making the pain seep into his marrow, I am not trying to extinguish his desire. Rather, I want him to both love and fear me, so that I may use him as easily as moving my own arm."

Lady Wen thought further: "People are often trapped by appearances, and I am no exception. Although this boy owes his position to his younger brother, which gave me the idea to nurture him, his appearance is not ordinary, and his talent is acceptable. When he comes near me, I find I do not dislike it."

She waved her sleeve and swept the table of delicacies away. She had caught an interest and secretly followed to observe.

She watched as Li Xian walked straight into a dark room. This was the "Punishment Room," specifically for punishing those who made mistakes.

Every day, the "Third-Rank Guardians" took turns on duty.

"Commander Li."

When the guardians saw Li Xian, they thought he had come to inspect, and they hurriedly came forward to greet him.

"I am here to receive punishment," Li Xian said. Seeing the switch in the corner, his brow furrowed and then relaxed. His mind naturally calmed, and he thought: "Is there any way of martial arts in the world that is easy to obtain? Since the Lady said she is willing to teach me the method of consuming essence, it proves my actions were correct."

"She punishes me with the switch not to punish me, but to make me afraid. In that case, I only need to suffer enough for her to be happy."

Although Li Xian had not seen much of the world, he knew what he sought and guessed what the Lady sought.

"P-Punishment?" The guardian was stunned.

"That's right. The Lady ordered me to receive twenty heavy strokes with the switch. You may begin."

"This is the Lady's command. You need not hold back for the sake of my position. Otherwise, it will be you taking the punishment!"

Li Xian had already laid himself on the long bench.

"Th-then... Commander Li, we will offend you."

The two took out the switches and channeled their internal energy to strike. The switch hit Li Xian's back.

In the manor, unless it was a major crime, a wooden rod to the buttocks was enough to settle matters.

Only if one angered the Lady would the switch be used. It was enough to make a person faint from the pain.

After a few strokes, Li Xian's back was already a mess of blood and flesh. Blood welled from the holes, flowing freely. The sight was shocking, making the guardians tremble with fear.

Lady Wen watched secretly and nodded slightly. "The switch is coated with salt water; every stroke bites into the flesh. The pain is unforgettable. Since this boy can endure this, teaching him the 'Way of Consuming Essence' is not out of the question."

"Someday, he will still be of use to me."

When she was young and roaming the Jianghu, she had pursuers like a river of crabs. She liked to make her pursuers suffer for her; the more wretched their wails, the more delighted she was. Though her age and experience had grown, she had lost that interest long ago.

But seeing Li Xian now, not making a sound, his eyes resolute, enduring the pain while hiding a sharp edge, she suddenly found herself looking at him in a new light.

Half an hour later.

Li Xian applied some ointment simply to "stabilize the blood and close the pores" to prevent excessive bleeding.

He put on a cloth shirt and walked toward the inner courtyard.

"Commander Li, won't you rest for a bit?" the guardian who held the switch asked cautiously.

"No need," Li Xian said. His face was pale, but his eyes were bright. He was selling the act of suffering; he couldn't afford to delay for a moment.

The punishment was over, but the pain remained. Every step he took pulled at the injuries on his back, an indescribable sensation. He hadn't walked far before the cloth shirt on his back was soaked with blood, sticking to his skin.

"I hope the Lady keeps her word and doesn't make me take this beating for nothing," Li Xian muttered to himself as he walked straight into the inner courtyard.

Seeing the Lady, he cupped his fist and said, "Lady, I have returned after receiving the punishment."

"Turn around," Lady Wen said. When Li Xian turned and revealed the terrible state of his back, her voice softened slightly. "Does it still hurt?"

"It doesn't hurt," Li Xian shook his head.

"It doesn't hurt?" Lady Wen's palm moved slightly, and a gust of energy blew over. Li Xian's back felt as if it were being cut by a knife.

Lady Wen said, "In front of me, you cannot hide anything. Do you think I don't know if you are in pain?"

"You have suffered this time, so you must remember the lesson. Do not make the same mistake again."

Li Xian shook his head. "I cannot agree to that." Lady Wen frowned slightly.

Li Xian continued, "My thoughts are not my own. I will restrain them, but I cannot guarantee it completely. Otherwise, I would be deceiving you."

Only then did Lady Wen relax her brow. "It is good that you have this awareness."

"The Way of Consuming Essence... speaking of which, Pang Long also asked me about it, but I did not answer. Do you know why?"

Li Xian shook his head. "I do not."

Lady Wen smiled. "Naturally, he was not qualified. Stepping into the realm of consuming essence means beginning to transform one's body. But how can those who transform their bodies in this world be of poor quality? If that were the case, wouldn't we be looked down upon?"

"I looked down on him, so I couldn't be bothered to teach him."

"Truthfully speaking, in my eyes, the Way of Consuming Essence is not really that great."

Li Xian felt a pang of sadness for Pang Long. Pang Long was loyal to the bone, yet he couldn't catch the Lady's eye. At the same time, he thought that if it weren't for his younger brother's success, leaving the manor would have been far better than staying.

"Regarding the so-called consuming essence, you must have learned a lot from Pang Long," Lady Wen said leisurely. "Tell me your understanding first."

Li Xian said truthfully, "The realm of consuming essence is to digest the essence of heaven and earth, allowing the innate clay body to begin its transformation."

"That is indeed the case. These are the things I told Pang Long. He told you this, it seems you two have a good relationship." Lady Wen knew Pang Long was loyal, and that Li Xian was close to him, which further confirmed his loyalty.

She then continued, "Did Pang Long also say that clay body martial artists, through bitter training, first fill their energy lake, then circulate energy through the meridians, and finally stabilize their blood and close their pores? Only then can it be considered a preliminary success."

"After that... they can try to swallow essence food and essence soup. Allow the essence of heaven and earth to enter the body, constantly entering and dispersing, repeating this process. This process is called body washing."

Li Xian nodded. This was indeed what he had heard from Pang Long.

"If I am not mistaken, you are already in the process of washing your body. Did you have essence treasures to consume in Black River Village?" Lady Wen asked.

Li Xian felt there was no need to hide the matter of the crab treasure, and it wouldn't hurt to tell her, so he explained about the crab treasure.

"I see."

Lady Wen nodded, looking down on such trivial gains. "Pang Long's words, you can listen to, but they are not entirely correct. He has a superficial understanding of the 'Consuming Essence Realm.' The fact that he showed characteristics of consuming essence was purely accidental. In my opinion, he is still a leaking vessel."

"Even if he entered the Consuming Essence Realm, that's all he is."

"Leaking vessel? What is a leaking vessel?" Li Xian asked.

"If the body washing is not done properly, it naturally becomes a leaking vessel," Lady Wen said. "Those who follow the wild path without a proper method only think that the longer the essence of heaven and earth is stored in the body, the better."

"Indeed, this allows the physical body to retain the essence of heaven and earth, and the characteristics of consuming essence appear faster."

"But this is wrong."

"A martial artist's clay body inevitably dissipates the essence of heaven and earth. In the body washing stage, what truly needs to be done is to guide the path of the essence's dissipation. Allowing it to dissipate along the meridians and acupoints truly brings out the body's impurities. Only then is it considered 'washing'."

"That is why some children of aristocratic families start consuming essence soup from a young age, beginning the body washing."

"Later, when they can circulate energy through the meridians and stabilize blood and close pores, they naturally gradually retain the essence of heaven and earth and attempt to truly digest it. It is a natural progression into the 'Consuming Essence Realm'."

Li Xian asked, "In other words, one can actually consume essence food without needing to circulate energy through the meridians or stabilize blood and close pores?"

"Yes," the Lady said. "The so-called circulating energy first, then stabilizing blood and closing pores, and finally retaining the essence of heaven and earth, is just a misunderstanding of the wild path."

"Without a proper method, they can only guess. Naturally, they think so. In fact, most martial artists on the wild path have no conscious body washing."

"Long-term persistence will eventually make them martial artists of the Consuming Essence Realm. But their achievements will be limited. The so-called longevity will be out of reach."

"Weren't you of the same belief before?"

Li Xian wiped a handful of cold sweat. He didn't know if it was because the injury on his back was too severe, causing sweat to flow from the pain, or because he felt a chill of fear upon hearing that what he knew was a wrong path.

"Indeed... I only thought what Commander Pang said was very reasonable, so..."

Lady Wen smiled. "Since you work for me, you are no longer a martial artist of the wild path without a method."

"I have a scroll of the 'Congenital Body Washing Diagram.' Take it and memorize it. It records the dissipation routes of the essence of heaven and earth and the method to bring out the body's impurities."

"When the impurities are washed away, the body is clear and bright, and the turbid air is completely gone, you will not be far from the Consuming Essence Realm."

Li Xian took the body washing diagram, unable to hide his joy. The switch punishment was not in vain after all. People often say that the beginning is the hardest part of everything. The hardest thing is that if you go wrong at the start, everything is in vain.

Li Xian asked, "Lady, I have another question I would like to ask."

"Speak," Lady Wen nodded.

"Are there martial artists in this world who, after being washed by the essence of heaven and earth, gradually produce strange scenes and reveal strange appearances?" Li Xian asked.

"You are referring to the [Transformation Appearance]?" Lady Wen nodded. "The way of martial arts is vast. There are indeed Transformation Appearances, and not a few. But this matter is far from you. You do not need to know the details for now."

Lady Wen looked Li Xian up and down. "Martial artists must avoid being too ambitious. You first practice the body washing diagram well. Coincidentally, I will open the cauldron to boil essence food tomorrow."

"You can try it."

Commander's Courtyard.

Li Xian called two laundry maids to help apply medicine. He lay on the bed, his back covered in blood and filth, a shocking sight. The maids were afraid of hurting Li Xian and tried to be as gentle as possible, but Li Xian still frowned in pain from time to time.

"Commander, what exactly did you do to be punished so severely by the Lady?" the maid asked curiously.

Li Xian, however, was engrossed in the Body Washing Diagram.

"So that's how it is... So that's how it is..."

"The body washing that people don't pay attention to is actually the most important link."

Li Xian suddenly realized. He was also secretly afraid. The path of martial arts, later on, one might be able to rely on oneself, but in the early stages, without a guide, it truly wouldn't work.

"The Congenital Body Washing Diagram... using the mind and energy as the lead, using the body and breath as the guide, allowing the essence of heaven and earth to follow the body's muscle texture and meridians. From the surface to the inside, from the shallow to the deep, gradually washing away the five turbidities and filth, revealing the true form of the body."

"Wash the limbs and skin first, then the acupoints of the whole body, the five organs and six bowels, the nine orifices and eight holes... until the whole body is transparent, the turbid air does not stain, and the body is clear and the mind true."

"What is so difficult about entering the Consuming Essence Realm?"

"Tomorrow, I will start boiling essence food. Let's try this body washing method. The Lady's essence food is definitely better than that mountain crab..."

Li Xian's eyes were bright. The great path of consuming essence, the clouds and mist have dispersed, and it is right before his eyes.
