# Chapter 127: Returning Home

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing!"

Tong Yao watched as the storage bag floated gently before her, her mind conjuring the image of a youthful young man. Her eyes brimmed with nostalgia.

The scene when Senior Brother Yang Chu had brought him to report to the Luo Du team remained vivid in her memory, as if it had happened just yesterday. And those times when they had carried out missions together!

The Black Mountain City filled with skin puppets, the pig demon...

Those were such good days.

Junior Brother Zhang Jing had been a quiet, unassuming youth back then.

Xia Yuan and Zhou Zhi were still alive, Senior Brother Ding hadn't lost his arm yet, still full of vigor and vitality. Even during dangerous missions, everyone would chatter and laugh boisterously, like one big family.

But none of that could ever return.

Tong Yao's eyes grew moist.

She recalled yesterday when they had all gone to welcome Zhang Jing.

At the time, she and Senior Brother Ding had wanted to speak with him.

But on one hand, the supervisors had surrounded Zhang Jing, making it impossible for the two of them to approach; on the other hand, it was because of their own sense of inadequacy.

An overwhelming sense of inferiority stemming from the vast difference in their statuses.

In the end, they had given up.

Yet who would have thought that Junior Brother Zhang Jing would still remember her and Senior Brother Ding?

Yes.

Even though Zhang Jing was now a lofty Inner Court disciple, Tong Yao stubbornly continued to call him Junior Brother in her heart, as if only this way could he remain familiar to her.

Returning to the present, Tong Yao gently wiped away the glistening tears at the corners of her eyes with her sleeve.

Beside her, Senior Brother Ding's voice trembled as he said, "Senior Brother Zhang Jing... he still... still remembers us?" His remaining hand unconsciously covered his face, his eyes already reddening.

"Junior Brother, Junior Sister, I think you should take a look inside the storage bag first," Senior Brother Li reminded with a smile.

Before long.

Two exclamations sounded in quick succession.

"So much?"

"Heavens!"

"Junior Brother, Junior Sister, the resources Senior Brother Zhang Jing has given you are more than enough to cultivate to the tenth level of Qi Refinement, with plenty to spare. Cherish this opportunity. As for sect missions, don't accept any for now. Wait until your cultivation reaches the late stages of Qi Refinement."

"Thank you, Senior Brother Zhang Jing. Thank you, Senior Brother Li." The voices of Senior Brother Ding and Tong Yao choked up simultaneously.

Half a month passed quietly.

At the center of Longze Lake...

On a small island shimmering with spiritual light.

The entire island was now enveloped in dense spiritual mist, with sunlight filtering through to make everything on the island glitter with golden radiance.

At the island's center.

The spiritual energy was ten times denser than elsewhere on the island. Yet even so, endless streams of spiritual energy continued converging here.

The incredibly rich spiritual energy condensed into raindrops that fell to the ground, only to quickly disperse and rejoin the spiritual mist.

This cycle repeated endlessly.

Within the curtain of spiritual rain, an elegant emerald-green pavilion loomed faintly visible.

On the second floor's cultivation chamber.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, bright divine light bursting forth like twin suns.

His vast spiritual sense swept through his dantian.

Inside, ink-black magical power surged tumultuously, emitting waves of terrifying fluctuations.

Every strand of magical power had merged with the perfected intent of the Lunar Dragon Python Dao, resembling countless minuscule lunar pythons that exuded an aura of extreme ferocity, darkness, and desolation.

"With spiritual consciousness transformed into divine sense, and spiritual power into magical power, it's time to prepare for Foundation Establishment," Zhang Jing murmured, a glimmer of anticipation in his eyes.

With that wisp of Primordial Beginning True Intent, establishing a Purple Immortal Foundation was guaranteed!

And after establishing his foundation, he would be able to mobilize the Primordial Beginning True Intent, beginning to comprehend the wonders of the 'Heavenly Immortal Great Dao'—the Primordial Beginning World.

Zhang Jing had a vague premonition.

When he successfully established his Dao Foundation, he would undergo an unprecedented transformation.

The true divide between immortal and mortal.

But before that—

"The Academy Head said establishing a Dao Foundation is an extremely lengthy process, taking anywhere from several months to several years. Especially for a Golden Nature Dao Foundation! Establishing a Purple Immortal Foundation might take even longer."

A faint smile appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes.

"I should return home first. It's been two and a half years since I last went back."

With this thought.

He rose and walked out directly.

As Zhang Jing moved, the liquid-dense spiritual energy in the room rippled in waves...

His figure slowly ascended into the sky.

Only then did Zhang Jing notice.

In just half a month.

His ninety-li immortal island had undergone tremendous changes from when he first arrived.

In his view.

Every patch of visible soil on the island was now covered with sprouting spiritual herbs of various colors, forming an expansive nursery.

The mastermind behind this—Deer Thirty-Eight—was currently happily moving rocks in a rugged area of the island, seemingly preparing to cultivate another spiritual herb garden.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but shake his head at the sight.

Instantly.

A majestic voice resounded in Deer Thirty-Eight's mind:

"Thirty-Eight, your master has some temporary business to attend to outside. Take good care of the immortal island. And stop obsessing over those herbs of yours. Now that you have a proper inheritance and are an Outer Court disciple, focusing on cultivation is the correct path."

Hearing this.

Deer Thirty-Eight's movements halted abruptly before it replied sheepishly:

"Understood, Master."

"But... hehe, Master, I'm not some Outer Court disciple—I'm your mount!"

"You should still cultivate properly. Otherwise, in the future—no, even now you can't carry me anymore!" Zhang Jing retorted irritably.

Deer Thirty-Eight immediately shrank its neck, replying pitifully:

"Don't scold me, Master. I'll start cultivating right away."

The Five Treasures Spiritual River once again transformed into a dark python, weaving swiftly through the clouds.

Several li traversed in a single breath!

Within the clouds, the Lunar Dragon Python Dao Intent grew increasingly active. Combined with Zhang Jing's surging magical power, it continuously drew in dark clouds and strong winds.

Wherever it passed, rain followed in its wake.

But Zhang Jing, wholly focused on his journey, paid no heed to this. His magical power surged wildly, causing the dark python beneath him to accelerate further...

As night deepened.

The darkness posed no obstacle to Zhang Jing's vision.

The familiar outline of Yong'an City had already appeared before him.

"We're here!"

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as he transformed into a streak of dark light, descending from the clouds into the boundless night...

Yong'an City, Zhang Residence.

"Oh dear, Young Master, please slow down! Don't fall!"

In the courtyard.

Several maids holding lanterns chased frantically after a one-year-old boy who was running wildly about.

In this world, it wasn't unusual for a one-year-old to be able to run.

Not far away.

A little girl of similar age, her hair in small braids, sat quietly on a stool, her large, dark eyes fixed curiously on the stars above.

Meanwhile.

Zhang Jing hovered in midair, watching the scene below with interest, a faint smile of contentment on his face.
