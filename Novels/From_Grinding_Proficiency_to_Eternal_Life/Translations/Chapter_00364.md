# Chapter 364: Do You Know What It Means to Be a Landbound Immortal?

He raised his left hand and gently clenched his five fingers.

In an instant, the heavens and earth changed color.

The clouds above the palace walls suddenly parted, and the boundless spiritual qi of the heavens and earth seemed to be pulled by a black hole, transforming into a golden pillar of light that descended from the sky, enveloping Xu Yunfan.

An aura as vast as the sea radiated from his body. Every strand of it was as heavy as a thousand jun, pressing down on the surroundings until they seemed to warp slightly.

The smile on You Quan's face froze.

The purple-black flames in his palm suddenly extinguished, and the giant serpent let out a mournful cry before dissolving into black smoke.

What truly terrified him to the point of liver and gall bursting was that the surging true essence within his body had become as stagnant as dead water. No matter how he tried to mobilize it, it remained completely motionless.

This was no ordinary suppression; it was forcefully sealed by Xu Yunfan's true qi, which was as deep as an abyss.

That true qi was as immense as ten thousand mountains pressing down, so thick it had become a tangible, liquid form. Each strand weighed a thousand jun, locking all the acupoints on his body, and even the flow of true essence in his meridians was completely frozen.

"Foundation Establishment?! No, that's impossible!"

You Quan's face contorted violently. The purple mark on his forehead split open like torn silk, revealing a bloodshot, eerie vertical eye.

The vertical eye, with blood light swirling within, stared fixedly at his opponent. "The Heavenly Dao of this world is incomplete, the spiritual veins are depleted, and even the most basic Zhou Tian circulation is difficult to sustain. How could you possibly complete Foundation Establishment?! With the constitution of the Godly Martial World, it's impossible to achieve such support. It's absolutely impossible! A mere native of a world!"

His voice was a mix of shock and envy, the last few words squeezed out from between his teeth.

Xu Yunfan remained silent and took a step forward.

Just one step, yet it made You Quan feel as if struck by lightning, stumbling backward.

The handsome face of the Demon twisted, and fear finally appeared in his eyes.

"A thousand years of slumber has made you miss many things," Xu Yunfan said, his tone still calm but carrying an undeniable authority. "For example, what my status as a Landbound Immortal signifies."

He raised his right hand and gently swung the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammer.

There were no flashy moves, no earth-shattering momentum, just a simple swing.

However, You Quan felt an indescribable force迎面而来. All the defenses he had hastily gathered were torn apart like thin paper.

*Bang!*

You Quan's body flew backward like a ragdoll, crashing heavily into the palace wall.

Cracks like a spider's web appeared on the solid city wall, and shattered stones flew everywhere.

He struggled to his feet,紫黑色的 blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"No... this is impossible..." You Quan rasped, "How could a martial artist from the lower realms possess such power?"

His eyes were bloodshot as he stared fixedly at the torrent of true qi around Xu Yunfan, which was as deep as an abyss.

The true qi was so thick it almost condensed into a tangible form, forming layer upon layer of aura vortexes around Xu Yunfan. Each strand contained a suffocating sense of oppression.

A complex light of greed and fear flickered in You Quan's vertical eye. Such terrifying reserves of true qi, even if the quality was slightly inferior to true essence, the quantitative change would trigger a qualitative change. A torrent of true qi on this scale was enough to drown and crush a being like him, like ants devouring an elephant.

"How did you do it?!"

If everyone in the Landbound Immortal realm was like this, what were these people here for? It was just delivering themselves as food.

Xu Yunfan didn't answer, just walked forward slowly.

With every step he took, the bricks and stones on the palace wall trembled slightly, as if unable to bear his weight.

You Quan finally realized the gravity of the situation.

The human cultivator before him was by no means one of those so-called Landbound Immortal experts he knew.

The power to move the forces of the heavens and earth with a mere gesture—even in the records of the Primordial Origin Sect, only Foundation Establishment True Persons could achieve such a feat.

"Wait!" You Quan hurriedly raised his hand, his voice losing its previous arrogance. "We can talk! I... I know the secrets of this world! The path of martial arts in your Godly Martial World has been completely sealed off. No matter how you cultivate, you cannot break through the shackles. I can guide you into the Immortal Path! And those things that are hidden..."

As expected of a demonic cultivator, being arrogant first and then obsequious, it was truly laughable.

Xu Yunfan shook his head. "I don't need it. If I want to know something, I will take it myself."

He raised the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammer again. This time, the head of the hammer pulsed with dark light, as if containing the weight of a thousand mountains, and pressed down horizontally.

You Quan's face fell drastically, and he turned to flee. However, as soon as he took a step, he discovered that the space around him had been completely sealed, not even a wisp of true essence could leak out.

"No, it's absolutely impossible!"

The Godly Martial World was merely a lower realm for the Foundation Establishment disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect to train and harvest in. For a Foundation Establishment True Person to suddenly appear here—how could this continue?

You Quan let out a desperate roar. The purple mark on his forehead opened completely, bursting with strands of true essence, attempting to transform into various wondrous techniques for a final struggle.

Xu Yunfan gently swung the hammer down.

*Boom!*

A flash of golden light, and You Quan's body, as if struck by a force of ten thousand jun, exploded in an instant.

The紫黑色 demonic qi scattered in all directions.

As expected!

This guy's vitality was extremely strong; even after being hammered to pieces, he could still cast spells.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with intensity. His right palm shot out, and the Ten Extremities true qi surged forth like a raging storm.

The fleeing紫黑 demonic qi immediately became as if trapped in a swamp, forcibly stagnated in mid-air by an invisible force.

He clenched his five fingers, and the demonic qi in the sky actually converged like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, letting out a piercing shriek under the refinement of the Ten Extremities true qi.

"Condense!"

With a loud shout, the boiling demonic qi was compressed into a fist-sized紫黑气团.

Xu Yunfan's left palm suddenly glowed with Ten Extremities true qi, circulating within his palm, transforming into pure Yang true gang, and slapped it heavily onto the气团.

Countless golden patterns immediately appeared on the surface of the气团, like molten gold flowing on the surface of the demonic qi.

As the demonic qi churned violently, it was forcibly refined into a pill with a诡异紫光. Occasionally, a few struggling blood threads flashed across its surface.

In an instant, the once arrogant and unruly You Quan was reduced to only a few wisps of lingering demonic qi floating in the air.

Xu Yunfan put away the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammer. The golden light dissipated, and heaven and earth returned to peace.

He turned to look at the dumbfounded Dugu Jiu and smiled slightly. "Now, we can go to the Martial Practice Tower."

Dugu Jiu's Adam's apple bobbed. It was a long while before he found his voice. "Brother Xu... just now..."

"Just cleaned up a small nuisance," Xu Yunfan said calmly, as if he had just casually swatted a fly. "This person was indeed mysterious. If it were any other Landbound Immortal, they might have fallen for his tricks. Unfortunately, he met me..."

Dugu Jiu's heart trembled. He could naturally see that Xu Yunfan was using the path of the Ten Extremities martial arts, but the changes within it were completely beyond his comprehension.

Just those few moves earlier seemed like seeing a being who had been immersed in the Landbound Immortal realm for decades.

How could that look like someone who had just entered this realm?

Dugu Jiu took a deep breath, suppressing the shock in his heart.
