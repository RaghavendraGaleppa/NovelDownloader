# Chapter 35: Hidden Chaos

Early morning, after a night of cold rain. The alley outside the Fierce Tiger Gang's headquarters was still filled with puddles, mixed with dust, turning the ground muddy.

Chen Hu crouched beside the corpse of his cousin Chen Bao, suppressing his grief as he examined the wounds.

Chen Bao wasn't the strongest fighter in the Fierce Tiger Gang after himself, but he was definitely among the top five. As his cousin, Chen Bao was Chen Hu's most capable and trusted subordinate.

Now that Chen Bao had been killed, it was like losing an arm.

"Boss, we've checked the warehouse—that fifty-year-old ginseng is missing," a gang member reported nervously.

Chen Hu's expression darkened further. "To kill Chen Bao over a fifty-year-old ginseng... I've always been generous. If someone powerful had asked me for it, would I have refused?"

His fists clenched, veins bulging.

He couldn't fathom that someone would kill for such a thing. While rare, the ginseng was primarily used to sustain life. Any capable martial artist could have simply asked for it—he would have given it freely.

Such items were meant to build connections, not cost lives.

Furious yet methodical, he examined the wounds with his seasoned experience.

Three fatal injuries.

A heavy punch to the temple, the kind that required at least twenty years of training to deliver.

Two sharp wounds on the left and right chest.

As he inspected the chest wounds, his grim expression shifted to shock.

"What is this?" he muttered, then said firmly, "Crossbow bolts!"

The surrounding gang members gasped.

Even the Fierce Tiger Gang didn't have crossbows—at least none that the rank-and-file had seen.

Chen Hu had secretly acquired two at great cost, but he hadn't even told Chen Bao.

If this got out, even the previous prefect of Jiangzhou would have demanded thousands of strings of cash to overlook it. The current Prefect Ling would throw him in prison without hesitation.

Who would dare use a crossbow for murder?

Such weapons were only used in life-or-death situations.

For a fifty-year-old ginseng? Was it worth it?

Something didn't add up.

In all of Jiangzhou, which faction would be so brazen as to use a crossbow for murder?

Only the Zhang family had the audacity—but why would they?

Chen Hu felt the situation was far more complex, as if an invisible hand was manipulating events. Was this a warning? Related to his plans to become a lay disciple of the Golden Light Temple?

He seemed caught in a vast, unseen whirlpool.

Drawing on his years of experience, he steadied himself and made a bold decision.

"Take Chen Bao's body to the prefectural office. Report this to the authorities," Chen Hu said coldly.

The gang members were stunned.

Report to the authorities?

They were an underworld gang!

But the boss had spoken, and they had no choice.

Chen Hu's reasoning was clear: Prefect Ling Chenghe prided himself on being a capable official. Since he'd been targeting the Fierce Tiger Gang, let him deal with a crossbow murder. If Ling investigated, it would cause major trouble. If he didn't, or failed to solve it, what excuse would he have to harass the gang further?

Pushed to the brink by Ling Chenghe, Chen Hu was ready to fight fire with fire. If the fish was going to die, he'd make sure the net tore too.

Only... he mourned the loss of his loyal brother.

Three days after retrieving the ginseng.

In his simple alchemy room, Zhou Qing expertly finished the last batch of Blood Qi Pills. His technique had improved, yielding a higher success rate with less waste.

*Knock, knock, knock!*

"Master Zhou, it's me."

Zhou Qing stored the pills and opened the door to find Miss Lin, accompanied as usual by her maid Chunxiang and bodyguards Zhang San and Li Si.

"Master Lin, please come in," Zhou Qing welcomed her with a smile. "It's been sunny for two days—not too cold today. Shall we talk in the courtyard?"

Miss Lin agreed.

Under the large mulberry tree, they sat facing each other.

Strangely, the tree provided cool shade in summer and seemed to absorb the winter chill, making the courtyard less damp and cold.

As for Mao Ri, the rooster, it was impervious to both heat and cold.

Miss Lin had come to share major news: Chen Bao, the fourth leader of the Fierce Tiger Gang and Chen Hu's cousin, had been killed by a crossbow bolt.

Chen Hu had reported it to the authorities, causing an uproar in Jiangzhou.

Chen Bao was a martial artist, ranking in the top five of the gang's fighters. His death was a significant blow to the gang's strength.

Moreover, Chen Hu had broken underworld protocol by taking a gang-related death to the authorities.

Given the use of a crossbow, it was a justified move.

Before leaving, Miss Lin said meaningfully, "Master Zhou, keep that item I gave you for self-defense safe. Don't let anyone see it."

Zhou Qing feigned confusion. "Master Lin, did you give me such a thing?"

Miss Lin smiled. "Perhaps I misremembered."

Zhou Qing pointed to the ancient iron sword hanging on a newly made wooden stand. "For self-defense, I have this."

The sword, unshielded and rusted in the sunlight, looked more like a relic than a weapon.

They shared a knowing smile before Miss Lin departed.

Zhou Qing quietly closed the gate.

After offending Young Master Zhang Shen, Miss Lin had risked much to give Zhou Qing a crossbow for protection, never asking for it back.

Her mention of it now suggested she suspected Zhou Qing's involvement in Chen Bao's death—whether directly or through hired help. Her message was clear: handle the crossbow carefully, leave no traces.

Zhou Qing's response assured her the crossbow would never be linked to the Lin family, as if it never existed.

Pointing to the sword emphasized that his visible means of defense ended there—nothing more would be revealed.

Their exchange was tacit, understood only by them. Even Chunxiang and the bodyguards, though loyal, wouldn't grasp the full meaning.

Miss Lin's visit also served another purpose: Chen Bao had led the thugs who harassed Zhou Qing's neighborhood and crippled Butcher Hu.

Her news of his death was a congratulatory message—evil had met its retribution.

Once Zhou Qing passed the provincial exams, this would add to his mystique. Chen Bao had sought to harm him, yet died within months. A little embellishment would enhance Zhou Qing's reputation post-exam.

A successful candidate was like a celestial star—offending one brought divine retribution.

Such narratives, true or not, often surrounded rising figures.

Zhou Qing, well-read in history, knew that while the masses might believe such tales, true leaders and their inner circles did not.

When King Wu of Zhou prepared to overthrow the Shang, three divinations all foretold disaster.

The Duke of Jiang's response was startling: he broke the divination tools, declaring, "Old bones and dried leaves cannot predict fate!"

Later, before the Xuanwu Gate coup, Prince Li Shimin sought to divine the outcome. His general Zhang Gongjin smashed the tortoise shell, saying, "What's there to doubt? If the omens were bad, would we stop?"

Thus, Li Shimin acted without hesitation.

For Zhou Qing, the fifty-year-old ginseng was essential. Even if it caused trouble, he had to obtain it to survive the journey to the provincial exams.

He couldn't believe the Zhang family or the Fierce Tiger Gang would let him travel unmolested.

To them, eliminating the source of trouble was the simplest solution. Zhou Qing's success would cut into Zhang interests and harm the gang.

The gentry's spoils were finite—more players meant smaller shares.

The gang's earlier actions had threatened Zhou Qing's scholarly future, an unforgivable offense.

He wouldn't gamble on their mercy.

Before the exams, he had to strengthen himself.

Only power could counter external threats.

As the saying goes: "Better to rely on oneself than divine omens, better to hone skills than chant sutras." He hadn't sought conflict, but when pushed, he would strike back.

"I wanted to cultivate in peace. These two deaths—you forced my hand," Zhou Qing thought darkly.

Chen Bao's death, involving a crossbow and reported to authorities, stirred minor chaos in Jiangzhou.

Zhou Qing shut his gate, ignoring the turmoil as he focused on cultivation.

Bear Form training required mimicking a bear's strikes, sways, and rotations, strengthening the upper body and resilience.

His appetite grew with his practice, as did his digestion.

At his age, his body craved nourishment.

Combined with Bear Form, he became a voracious eater.

He couldn't prepare all his meals, but Blood Qi Pills and their byproducts supplemented his diet. With winter preserving meat and vegetables, money solved his needs.

Income from Five Fragrance Pills continued, though Zhou Qing learned the Lin family's other businesses were struggling.

The new prefect's crackdown on local magnates targeted merchants like the Lins more than entrenched gentry.

As outsiders, the Lins lacked the political clout to resist.

Yet they never pressured Zhou Qing about the exams.

For both sides, his success would transform their partnership.

The priority was ensuring he reached the exam safely.

Pressure fueled his determination.

He endured Bear Form's rigors, even using iron sand to toughen vital areas, then healing with Tiger-Crane Force, Bear Form's heat, and wound remedies.

The process was brutal but effective.

Bear Form was for emergencies; in combat, his experience taught him to strike first and dirty.

Stealth from Deer Running was perfect for ambushes.

As he trained Bear Form, he honed Deer Running.

A martial art took root in his mind.

A month later, as Bear Form reached the入门 stage, Deer Running evolved into a martial skill.

His attention turned to the养生主:

Five Animals Form (Proficient): Tiger Form (Skilled), Deer Form (Skilled), Bear Form (入门), Bird Form (Proficient), Monkey Form (Proficient).

Martial Skills: Tiger-Crane Twin Forms (Skilled); Ghost Step (入门)+Light Wind Manual (Skilled); Finger Flick (Transcendent).

Special Skill: Revival Manual (入门).

Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary): Blood Qi Pills.

Literary Courage (Elementary), characters faintly transparent.

Remaining Lifespan: 58 years.

His month's gains included three added years of life and Deer Form's evolution into Ghost Step.

"Ghost" captured Deer Running's stealth and elusiveness.

Since Deer Running had naturally blended Deer Form and Light Wind Manual, Ghost Step's recognition by养生主 marked their deeper fusion.

Why did Ghost Step need further merging with Light Wind Manual, like Tiger Form and Crane Style had?

Zhou Qing realized Ghost Step was incomplete—only with the manual would it become whole.

A kick from him now came without warning, ghostly and unpredictable.

In direct confrontations, Ghost Step was deadlier than Tiger-Crane Twin Forms, though still needing refinement.

Spring was two months away.

With its arrival, he'd depart for the exams.

He felt urgency and quiet anticipation.
