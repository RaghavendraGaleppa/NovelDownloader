# Chapter 59: Special Effects Blockbuster

"Uncle Zhou, can you send someone to protect Tian Ling? Haotian Sect's past record is still there, I'm afraid of something happening!" Zhou Tian looked at the teleportation array, its glow dimming as cultivation energy dwindled, and said to Uncle Zhou beside him.

"This... dispatching a Saint King would be a bit troublesome. As for a Saint, their strength might not be quite enough." Uncle Zhou pondered for a moment, and a purple light silhouette stepped out from his body. "This is my Spirit Body. It possesses half of my strength. I don't need him at the moment, so let him go."

"That would be perfect." Zhou Tian smiled. Half the strength of a Great Emperor was more than enough.

The purple light silhouette stepped onto the teleportation array. The array lit up again, intricate runes swirling around it. The spatial passage opened, and the purple light silhouette vanished, having been successfully teleported.

After the purple light silhouette disappeared from the teleportation array, Uncle Zhou said to Zhou Tian, "Young Master, the Master wants you to see him again today."

"Looking for me again?" Zhou Tian's face was full of helplessness. Ever since he made Scholar Li kneel with a single word on the arena that day, his old man had become incredibly rampant in the imperial capital, walking sideways as if he owned the place. He had sought Zhou Tian out a few times, extremely curious about the divine ability he used, but Zhou Tian had always managed to fool him. Now, whenever he heard Zhou Yi was looking for him, his trigeminal nerve would twitch in pain.

"It seems there's something else today." A smile also appeared on Uncle Zhou's face. The father and son pair indeed had a comedic dynamic. He was also very curious how Zhou Tian had made Li Lingyi kneel that day. He had been closest to Zhou Tian and felt it most deeply; there were no spiritual energy fluctuations at all, nor did he perceive any other laws. If Li Lingyi hadn't been from the Great Luo Academy, he would have thought it was an act arranged by Zhou Tian.

"Let's go, let's go..." Zhou Tian sighed. He could run from the first day of the month, but not the fifteenth. So he might as well go see what his old man wanted this time.

After several turns and twists, they reached Zhou Yi's study. Pushing open the door, Zhou Yi was already seated behind his desk, waiting. Zhou Tian sat down on a chair in a grand, unceremonious manner, and said brazenly: "What do you want? If you're going to ask me how I made that old geezer kneel, I've already told you: 'Spirit controls the body, if I can do it, so can you.'"

Veins pulsed on Zhou Yi's forehead. "Spirit controls the body," my foot! He took two deep breaths and said: "The elite competition is this afternoon. Get ready and come with me to the imperial palace to watch!"

"What? The regular competition is over?" Zhou Tian asked in surprise. Because of his interference in the competition that day, Tian Ling had forfeited her qualification, so he hadn't known the regular competition was over. No wonder he hadn't seen Zhou Zui or Liu Yan these past few days; they must have been preparing for the competition.

"It ended yesterday! What have you been doing these past few days?" Zhou Yi's eyebrows twitched.

Yesterday... Zhou Tian thought for a moment... with Tian Ling in the garden... the day before yesterday... with Tian Ling in the pavilion... the day before that... with Tian... "Who's the champion?" Zhou Tian shook his head, cutting off the images in his mind.

"I... don't know either..." Zhou Yi thought for a moment and said dejectedly. Apart from Zhou Tian's incident that day, he hadn't paid any attention to this year's Youth Competition at all. He had been busy formulating plans to explore that new world; how could he have the mind to care about children's games?

"Tsk..." Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Yi disdainfully. "And he talks about me."

"That's not the point. Come with me to the imperial palace to watch the competition this afternoon!" Zhou Yi, mortified, put on a fatherly air.

"Is the elite competition not open to the public?" Zhou Tian asked. If the competition venue was in the imperial palace, it certainly wouldn't be open to the public.

"It's not open to the public because not only are there people from our Heavenly Qin, but also participants from other forces," Zhou Yi replied.

"Can I not go? Watching others fight is so boring..." Zhou Tian said dejectedly.

"No!" Zhou Yi said, "He's such a disappointment!" His son was too unmotivated. Forget soaring ninety thousand li, he should at least be able to strike the waters for three thousand li. How could he be so lazy that he couldn't even bother to turn over? "The elite competition isn't like those regular ones. These are the people you'll be dealing with in the future; their statuses aren't much lower than yours..."

"Go, go, go..." Zhou Tian's head ached from Zhou Yi's words. "Fine, I'll go," he thought, "I'll just treat it as watching a special effects blockbuster."

After this roundabout discussion, it was almost time. Zhou Yi was decisive in his actions, pulling Zhou Tian directly towards the imperial palace. On the way, Zhou Yi meticulously explained the rules of the elite competition to Zhou Tian. The elite competition didn't use an arena system. Instead, a group of participants would be placed in a secret realm, where they would fight to the death like 'Gu' insects, until only the final victor remained. There was no second or third place, only first. The law of the jungle was clearly evident, making it almost a miniature version of the Eight Prefectures Grand Competition.

The competition venue was in a palace within the imperial compound. Although called a competition venue, it was actually a viewing area, as the true competition took place inside the secret realm. By the time they arrived, the palace was already mostly filled. The important figures of Heavenly Qin, along with the leaders of forces from several other prefectures, had mostly arrived. Li Lingyi from the Great Luo Academy was also present, though his expression showed no unusual change. So many days had passed, and with all the human and material evidence, and the mastermind having confessed, the Great Luo Academy could only swallow this bitter loss.

"King Qin..." Others stepped forward to greet them as they saw the two enter. "Chancellor Liu..." "Duke Guo..." "General Gu..." "Master Zhikong..." "..."

Zhou Yi returned their greetings one by one. Of course, most people's gazes would occasionally drift towards Zhou Tian. It hadn't been long since Zhou Tian's spectacular display, and the sensation hadn't died down, so everyone was very curious about him. Zhou Tian, facing so many pairs of curious eyes, remained composed. "Go ahead and look," he thought, "it's not like I'm going to lose a piece of flesh. So what if they're all Saint King level experts?" "See that? The guy who knelt before me two days ago is sitting right there, pretending he doesn't see me."

After exchanging greetings with everyone, Zhou Yi led Zhou Tian to their seats. Only he had brought Zhou Tian along; everyone else present was from his own generation, while the other young participants were mostly preparing to enter the secret realm. After waiting a while longer for the remaining people to arrive, a flash of golden light appeared, and Emperor Qin materialized in the seat of honor. Everyone rose to pay their respects, after which he blathered on with another round of nonsense.

Zhou Tian didn't catch a single word of what Emperor Qin was saying. He was too busy gulping saliva, staring at the golden-eyed, purple-furred pork hock in front of him. The hock was translucent and glistening, with golden, exquisite jade honey flowing over it. The aroma, mixed with the sweetness of the honey, made Zhou Tian's stomach rumble, as he hadn't eaten breakfast. The snacks provided were quite abundant. There was also a food similar to sunflower seeds from Zhou Tian's previous life, though each was thumb-sized, with an outer shell like warm jade, and misty energy flowing within, faintly revealing golden kernels inside. It was practically the standard setup for watching a movie. He secretly gave Emperor Qin a thumbs-up; it would be even better if he talked less nonsense.
