# Chapter 201: The Emperor Isn't Anxious, But the Eunuch Is

The situation took another sudden turn. From the moment the Jinzhou Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator summoned his lifebound treasure—the small golden lock—to nailing the five ghost generals in place, and finally expending his vital essence to forcefully annihilate the leader of the ghost generals, everything happened in the blink of an eye.

"Ding ling ling~"

The small golden lock let out a mournful chime, prompting the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator to hurriedly recall it into his dantian, his anger flaring even more intensely.

Before a lifebound treasure could be fully nurtured, it required the cultivator's heart's blood and true essence to be carefully cultivated and stored within the dantian. The duration of this process depended on the treasure's potential.

For example, the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's golden lock was originally a lifebound treasure with twelve layers of restrictions. It would take roughly twenty-four years of nurturing within the dantian to fully synchronize with his soul. If it had thirty-six layers of restrictions, it would require a full seventy-two years.

Though this was a lengthy process, given the lifespan of a Golden Core cultivator, it wasn't entirely unacceptable.

Once the nurturing and refinement were complete, not only would the treasure unleash 120% of its power, but even if it were stolen, as long as the cultivator remained alive, no one else could refine or use it.

Only then would it truly become his own lifebound treasure.

But now, in this life-or-death moment, he had no choice but to summon the golden lock prematurely to resolve the crisis. This meant all the years of nurturing had been wasted. Not only would he have to start over, but the abrupt interruption in the nurturing process also caused an immediate backlash on his soul and vital essence, forcing him to cough up blood once again.

At this moment, without the golden lock's restraint, the remaining four ghost generals regained their mobility and resumed their assault on the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator.

But this time, no matter how they attacked, their strikes were effortlessly blocked by the black umbrella treasure. With the leader of the ghost generals—the Golden Core-level one—destroyed, the Five Ghosts' combined attack formation had been broken. Not only had their power drastically diminished, but more importantly...

The magic treasure, the Severing Water Sword, had fallen into the enemy's hands!

Without the threat of the magic treasure, the four ghost generals couldn't breach the black umbrella's defenses, and the pressure on the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator lessened significantly.

At the same time, the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator examined the newly acquired treasure in his hand. He channeled his divine sense into it, forcefully obliterating Lin Shan's refinement marks. Sensing the abundant power of the treasure's restrictions, he couldn't help but burst into laughter:

"Excellent, excellent! Who would've thought that at the brink of despair, fortune would turn in my favor? Misfortune may prove a blessing in disguise!

With this offensive treasure, combined with the defensive treasure passed down from my ancestors, and once my illusion treasure is fully nurtured in a dozen years, I will undoubtedly stand as a formidable expert among Golden Core cultivators!"

"Ever since I broke through to the Golden Core stage, I've been running around, calling in favors from friends and family, exhausting countless generations of accumulated goodwill, and selling off my lineage's inherited assets—all just to forge this twelve-restriction lifebound treasure. Now, I'm practically penniless. Who would've thought that just when I was in dire need, someone would deliver a pillow to me as I slept?"

---

"You two are truly my lucky stars! Not only did you leave behind the Lin Clan Trading Company—such a fat piece of meat—but you also generously gifted me an offensive magic treasure. Truly, fortune and misfortune are intertwined."

"I really must thank you. If not for you, how could I have obtained such an opportunity? Among you, there's even a formation master and a business expert. I'm almost looking forward to seeing what kind of inheritance you'll leave behind after your deaths..."

---

Though the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator had suffered significant damage to his vitality, he was now in high spirits, brimming with confidence. With one hand holding the black umbrella and the other gripping the sword, he strolled leisurely under the relentless attacks of the four Golden Core-level ghost generals as if they were nothing.

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon, however, felt their hearts turn cold. They hadn't expected the Golden Core-level ghost general leader to be killed, nor that their magic treasure would be lost. What had been a smooth battle had been completely overturned by their opponent. They racked their brains but never imagined that the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator—a mere newcomer to the Golden Core stage—would possess not one, but two magic treasures, including a lifebound treasure! The depth of his hidden strength was staggering.

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator glanced at the gathering yin energy in the distance. He knew it was the ghost general leader he had just destroyed reforming itself. As long as the Five Ghosts Yin Formation was backed by the pit of yin energy, the ghost generals could revive endlessly.

So instead of dealing with the other four ghost generals, he moved to the edge of the formation and began violently attacking the barrier. Once this killing formation was broken, the ghost generals inside would collapse on their own, and the two outside would have no chance of escape.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

Deafening explosions rang out as the formation's barrier trembled violently. Yet the opponent's black umbrella treasure remained unshaken. The four ghost generals could only uselessly scratch at him, unable to pose the same threat as before, let alone stop him from breaking the formation.

The Black Skeleton Demon increased its透支 of soul power, its skull's soul flame still burning as it desperately maintained the Five Ghosts Yin Formation. But the situation on the battlefield was already crystal clear.

"Stop struggling. For two Foundation Establishment juniors to push me to this point is already something you can be proud of."

"Blame your own bad luck for running into me. Consider it your misfortune. Remember to choose a better reincarnation in your next life!"

"Once this formation breaks, I'll give you a dignified death..."

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator spoke leisurely, completely at ease. While defending and attacking the formation, he didn't forget to taunt the two outside.

He wasn't worried about them escaping. Given a Golden Core cultivator's speed, these two wouldn't stand a chance. Moreover, he had just seized their magic treasure, which still carried their aura. He could easily track them to the ends of the earth. This time, victory was absolutely assured!

---

The Black Skeleton Demon also realized this and inwardly lamented its terrible luck.

Originally, with the "Illusory Spirit Mind Trap Formation" in place, they could attack or retreat as they pleased. The enemy, trapped in the illusion formation, wouldn't even be able to reach the outer "Five Ghosts Yin Formation," giving them an unassailable advantage.

But plans couldn't keep up with changes. Due to Lin Shan's blunder of aiding the enemy, all their preparations had been perfectly countered. It was as if they were cursed with the worst luck possible, rendering their layered formations useless.

This ambush against a Golden Core cultivator hadn't just failed—it had backfired spectacularly, and now both it and Lin Shan were about to lose their lives.

If this were just one of its avatars dying in another world, it wouldn't be a big deal. But if Lin Shan died, wouldn't the innate spiritual treasure, the Void Star Disk, fall into enemy hands? After all its patience and scheming, was it all just to hand victory to someone else?

The Black Skeleton Demon grew increasingly frantic. While maintaining the formation, it shouted into the barrier:

"Honored cultivator, hold your hand! I have something to say. Can we discuss this calmly?"

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator sneered and ignored it, continuing his relentless assault on the formation without any intention of delaying. The Five Ghosts Yin Formation trembled under his attacks, its barrier flickering unsteadily.

In this critical moment, the Black Skeleton Demon abandoned all pride and began pleading desperately: "Honored cultivator, your divine powers are boundless, your magic immeasurable! We were blind not to recognize your might. Our earlier offense was like an egg striking a rock. We beg for your mercy!"

The corners of the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's lips curled upward. Now that the tables had turned, he couldn't resist mocking them: "Weren't you two just sneering at me earlier? Why the sudden humility?"

The Black Skeleton Demon lowered its head meekly: "We were fools blinded by greed, spouting nonsense in our confusion. Please don't take it to heart. We are now willing to serve under you, as you previously suggested, and pledge our loyalty. We only ask for a chance to live!"

Ever since arriving in this world and unexpectedly discovering that a precious innate spiritual treasure was in the hands of a nobody like Lin Shan, the Black Skeleton Demon had endured humiliation, biding its time to break free and eventually seize the treasure for itself.

Now, seeing the script veer completely off course, it had no choice but to prioritize saving Lin Shan's life—if only to keep the innate spiritual treasure hidden from their enemy. It could always find another opportunity to reclaim it later.

But the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator seemed to have wised up. He had no intention of playing along with their act. With victory in his grasp, he focused solely on breaking the formation, his words cutting and final:

"Little skeleton, save your breath. You're both dead today! With my status, finding lackeys is as easy as snapping my fingers. Did you really think I needed you? I was just toying with you earlier. Hahahaha!"

---

The Black Skeleton Demon's soul flame flickered uncertainly, clearly at its limit. It was even more anxious than Lin Shan, terrified that all its schemes would come to nothing:

"Honored cultivator, you're mistaken. My expertise as a formation master could make me a valuable asset, bringing you endless connections—"

"Unnecessary. After how you humiliated me earlier, a mere formation master is hardly worth sparing."

"Honored cultivator, I must confess—I'm not just a formation master. I'm actually a refining grandmaster! I can forge magic treasures for you in the future, upgrade, maintain, repair, and improve them. From now on, I'll follow your every command!"

"What? A refining grandmaster?!"

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was stunned. He scrutinized the skeletal figure outside the formation, noting how its soul flame dimmed further under his assault. His movements slowed slightly as hesitation crept in.

Seeing an opening, the Black Skeleton Demon pulled out all the stops, demonstrating its abilities as a refining grandmaster through various means.

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator nodded thoughtfully. A refining grandmaster was essentially a money-printing machine in the cultivation world. Letting one die here would be a terrible waste.

"Very well. I'll let bygones be bygones and spare your life!"

"What about my companion—"

"As for that brat beside you, after the insults he hurled at me, he must die!"

The Black Skeleton Demon hurriedly interceded on Lin Shan's behalf: "Honored cultivator, a great man like you can surely forgive a minor slight. Please spare him for my sake!"

"You have value as a refiner and formation master, so sparing you makes sense. But what use is he?"

The Black Skeleton Demon glanced at Lin Shan and was baffled to find the kid not only unafraid but also seemingly deep in thought, as if watching a play unfold. He showed no anger over losing the Severing Water Sword, nor any concern about the formation's imminent collapse and his impending doom.

Honestly, how could you be so calm at a time like this?!

Suppressing its frustration, the demon stammered:

"Well... he... he does have some talents..."

"Such as?"

"Uh... such as..."

The Black Skeleton Demon hemmed and hawed, struggling to think of any redeeming qualities in Lin Shan. In its eyes, the kid was nothing but flaws: reckless greed, a troublemaker, cursed with bad luck, a heartless capitalist, a drama queen, two-faced, a wolf in sheep's clothing...

Of course, none of that could be said aloud.

"Ah! Right! He's... he's a business genius! The Lin Clan Trading Company was actually his doing all along!"

The Black Skeleton Demon reluctantly credited Lin Shan with its own achievements, feeling a pang of injustice. For this brat, I've sacrificed too much!

---

But the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator shook his head, unimpressed by this so-called "business talent." Ever since that high-end auction, he'd harbored a grudge against this "Bear Mountain Ascetic." Now, with old and new grievances piling up, he was determined to kill him.

The Black Skeleton Demon grew frantic, pleading desperately, even dropping to its knees—like the proverbial eunuch more anxious than the emperor. It abandoned all dignity to ensure Lin Shan's survival, if only to keep the innate spiritual treasure out of enemy hands.

Because in its eyes, the Void Star Disk already belonged to it. Lin Shan was merely holding onto it temporarily.

But the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator refused to budge. Not only had these two ambushed him and beaten him half to death, but his lifebound treasure had nearly been damaged. More importantly, he needed to kill someone to vent his frustration.

Cultivators lived by the principle of "unfettered thoughts, an unimpeded Dao heart." The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator decided to spare the skeleton but kill that Bear Mountain Ascetic to clear his mind.

Seeing no way out, the Black Skeleton Demon finally snapped!

Pointing at the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator inside the formation, it let out a roar like never before:

"We live together or die together! In this life, loyalty comes first—I'd take a blade for my brother! If you won't spare him, I'll drag you down with me!"

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's temper flared. Unmoved by the threat, he coldly snorted:

"Fine! I was going to spare you out of appreciation for your talents. But since you value loyalty so much, you can die together!"

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

With that, the Five Ghosts Yin Formation trembled violently once more. This time, the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator held nothing back, intent on exhausting the skeleton to death. Talent was talent, but if it couldn't be used, what was the point of keeping it?

Though he had to admit, in all his years, this was the first time he'd seen such a loyal skeleton. It was downright bizarre.

Aren't skeletons, yakshas, zombies, and vengeful spirits supposed to be synonymous with treachery? Since when did they start taking blades for each other?

The Black Skeleton Demon glared fiercely at the figure inside the formation. Its soul flame flickered like a candle in the wind, but an overwhelming aura began to awaken around it, as if it were preparing some earth-shattering forbidden technique for a mutual destruction attack.

"You forced this on me! I never wanted it to come to this! Why did you have to push me?!"

The Five Ghosts Yin Formation's barrier suddenly solidified. The surrounding spiritual energy seemed to obey some command, swirling into cyclones that howled as they spun!

---

A world-shaking momentum erupted into the heavens!

Inside the formation, the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator paled as he sensed this power. If he wasn't mistaken, this was the "momentum" of controlling the world's energy!

Was this skeleton's true form actually a Nascent Soul grandmaster?

"This Demon Lord never intended things to go this way. Before securing the innate spiritual treasure, I'm forced to invoke my contract to save my master by borrowing power from my true body in the Netherworld.

After this sacrificial ritual, I'll likely be pulled back to the Netherworld, expelled from this realm. Truly, fate plays cruel tricks!"

The Black Skeleton Demon stopped pretending. Pillars of black light shot into the sky, shockwaves rippled outward, and thick black mist billowed around it. At this moment, it resembled a demonic overlord!

Believing all hope was lost, it spilled everything without restraint. The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator, both shocked and puzzled, wondered what it meant by "innate spiritual treasure."

"What a pity... This avatar would've needed to reach the Nascent Soul stage to break free from the contract scroll. But following this jinxed kid, with all the disasters and misfortunes he attracts, I'd probably never live long enough to reach that level!"

The Black Skeleton Demon wore a bitter expression as it continued gathering energy. The overwhelming pressure filled the entire space, leaving the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator dumbfounded.

"Such is fate! Stuck with this walking calamity, bound by a soul contract, failing to obtain the innate spiritual treasure but getting entangled in this mess—no gain, all pain! Damn it all!!"

Behind the Black Skeleton Demon, a terrifying colossal phantom emerged—a manifestation only possible at the Nascent Soul stage. It appeared to be a skeletal figure seated upon a throne. Now, at last, it bared its fangs in full!

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was scared out of his wits! The skeleton that had just been groveling before him had transformed into a prehistoric monstrosity at the Nascent Soul stage, threatening mutual destruction!

Holy heavens, esteemed elder... was this really necessary?

More importantly... am I even worthy of this?

The Black Skeleton Demon seemed reluctant to end its otherworldly journey so abruptly. With complex emotions, it glanced at the brat beside it—who remained utterly unfazed even now. This Demon Lord has worried itself sick over you!

"Little brother, after saving you this time, this avatar will vanish completely. If you ever grow strong enough to traverse worlds, don't forget to seek me out in the Netherworld to repay this debt. After all, it's a life-saving grace!

When that time comes, gifting me an innate spiritual treasure wouldn't be too much to ask, right? Remember—the Fifth Netherworld, Skeleton Demon Ridge. I'll be waiting..."

As its skeletal frame began to fade, as if burning away its soul for one final strike, a voice finally spoke up beside it.

"No need!"

Lin Shan flatly refused, disdainfully pushing aside the skeletal hand trying to rest on his shoulder. He was baffled by this insincere melodrama.

Repay a debt?

Since when did I owe you anything?

Did you really think I was helpless, with no other cards to play?

Besides, the Void Star Disk is mine—what nonsense are you spouting?

And as my subordinate, who gave you permission to use a forbidden mutual destruction technique?

A wage slave's soul belongs to its master—you'll be my wage slave for life!

"Cancel your forbidden technique and watch closely!"

After spectating for so long, Lin Shan finally stepped forward. Without any grand gestures, he merely raised an eyebrow.

"Rumble—"

High in the heavens, a golden pool of lightning slowly materialized.
