# Chapter 126: The Remains and the Investment Reward: The Blood-Soaked War Soul Talisman!

Deep within the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

A figure in blood-red robes stared intently at the name at the very top of the sky.

"She has indeed come."

The young man's murky, turbid eyes flickered, a trace of excitement surfacing.

"Thousands of years... I have finally waited for such a person..."

"Master Han."

Yin Huaxuan, completely shrouded in a black robe, approached and bowed respectfully.

This was the first time he had seen the mysterious and immensely backgrounded Master Han reveal such an expression.

Master Han held an extremely high status within the Demonic Sect.

So high that even he did not know the other's true name.

Master Han's methods could only be described as uncanny and divine.

This Blood Phoenix Secret Realm—even a Sixth Realm Law Body martial artist could not break its rules unless a massive external force were to destroy the realm directly.

Yet, Master Han allowed him, an Inner Scenery cultivator, to move freely in and out.

Furthermore.

Although Master Han appeared to be in his twenties, his vision and experience made Yin Huaxuan feel like a frog at the bottom of a well.

Yin Huaxuan also had another feeling.

Ever since entering the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm and standing before Master Han, he felt a suffocating pressure, like a fishbone stuck in his throat.

A moment later.

The blood-robed youth's expression returned to calm.

"How goes the matter I entrusted to you?"

"Within this secret realm, there will surely be a river of blood."

"Good, you are a capable one. Enduring for decades within the Clear Abyss Sect, you have suffered."

The blood-robed youth seemed to be in a good mood.

"For the prosperity of the Great Sect, I am willing to lay down my life..." Yin Huaxuan dared not claim credit.

The youth known as Master Han waved his hand, a half-smile on his face.

"The benefits will not be lacking."

"Yes."

Yin Huaxuan bowed again.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a pale golden skeleton nearby, emitting a golden light mixed with blood-colored runes. The clothes on its body had long since rotted away, but the bones remained smooth and lustrous.

It was almost... lifelike.

And those blood-colored runes seemed even brighter than when he last saw them...

***

On the first level of the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

In the withered and twisted dense forest, the sound of snapping branches echoed.

"Ying Bing is terrifying..."

Iron Qi retracted his gaze from the sky, squinting and staring at the goosebumps on his arm.

"I feel like something isn't right here."

The Ten-Sided Ambush Military Dao Diagram he observed in the Observation Realm belonged to the Gang Dou Sect, making him extremely skilled in group battles and particularly sensitive to killing intent.

He felt as if some existence was secretly spying on him.

However, looking around, there was no one in sight, not even a living creature...

"What's going on?"

Iron Qi scratched his head.

There were no living creatures, yet he could smell the scent of blood.

He took a few more steps forward and finally found the source of the blood smell.

Several tattered pieces of clothing hung on tree branches, but the owners of those clothes were nowhere to be found.

"Strange."

Iron Qi was about to get closer.

Then he discovered that the ancient trees in this withered forest had, at some unknown time, cracked open giant mouths on their trunks.

The branches also began to writhe frantically.

"Tree demons?"

The thought had just crossed his mind.

*Whoosh—*

A branch, carrying a mournful whistling sound, whipped through the air like a revived venomous snake.

*Crack!*

Iron Qi was whipped and stumbled, his blood and Qi churning.

He quickly circulated his internal energy, and the halberd in his hand became impenetrable like a泼水不进 (water that cannot be splashed in).

After exchanging several moves with the branches.

"Break!"

The internal energy in Iron Qi's halberd condensed into Gang Qi. Behind him, the shadow of a heavily armored general faintly appeared.

With a single thrust, he pierced through the tree demon.

However.

Just as Iron Qi was about to sigh in relief, his expression suddenly turned ugly.

*Creak creak—*

The entire forest came to life. Countless tree shadows danced wildly, like hibernating venomous snakes awakened.

They blotted out the sky and the sun.

"Troublesome..."

Iron Qi fell into a bitter struggle.

Every tree demon here was at the Internal Energy Realm, but their numbers were simply too great.

Moreover, their bodies were as tough and tenacious as his own tempered physique, making them very difficult to deal with.

Even with the shadow of the general behind him, the speed at which he wielded his halberd grew slower and slower.

***

Half a quarter of an hour later.

"I can't drag this on any longer. If I manage to break out, I'll be completely drained."

Iron Qi made a decisive move and slapped his thigh.

His upper body shot out abruptly, wanting to fly out of here.

---

However.

The branches suddenly wove a dense net in the air, covering him down from above.

It was a King Tree Demon.

Its aura was actually stronger than his own.

"Is my exploration of the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm ending here..."

Iron Qi was filled with bitterness.

The exhaustion of his body and the pain of his flesh made him see glimpses of his past in a daze.

A cripple might be able to practice martial arts.

But what about someone with no legs?

Things that ordinary people could do easily, he had to give his all, even just to go to the bathroom.

Compared to his senior and junior brothers, he was just a disabled person.

All he could do was put in more effort than others.

When others ran, he supported himself with his hands, going down the mountain and climbing back up bit by bit. At first, it took him several days to complete one round trip. When hungry, he ate the flatbread tied around his neck; when thirsty, he drank dew.

Later, relying on half his meridians to successfully open his meridians, his master specially forged a pair of mechanical legs for him.

After he stood up.

Those past mockeries, past despair, and past confusion were all left behind him.

But after all, those weren't his legs.

His body was still only half whole.

Perhaps there is a Fruit of Earth Fusion in this Blood Phoenix Secret Realm that could complete his physical deficiency.

But the distance to reach it seemed something that willpower alone could not bridge?

The tip of the descending branch was incredibly sharp, rapidly enlarging in his pupils.

It was a King Tree Demon.

"Is this ending... perhaps..."

"Because I wasn't hard enough?"

Iron Qi's calm heart held no unwillingness, only confusion.

*Snap—*

The sound of a branch breaking came.

Iron Qi opened his eyes in a daze.

He saw that the tree demon in front of him had already been set ablaze with fire, struggling and twisting in pain.

"Huh?"

Iron Qi had tried using fire to burn them too, but even using oil, he couldn't light them on fire.

Who was it?

He looked up.

A figure had already grabbed a long sword. With a light swipe of his index finger, the entire sword burst into flames.

Behind the youth, a scorching sun seemed to appear.

Sun Wheel Sword Canon.

"Die!"

In the span of a breath, countless sparks scattered from the solar halo, following the sword's guidance and sweeping down.

*Sizzle sizzle sizzle!*

A rain of exploding fire pierced through the body of the King Tree Demon.

After a series of grating sounds, the King Tree Demon crashed down.

The other tree demons were all struck with terror, not daring to approach at all.

"Brother Li?"

Looking at the youth who looked like a deity, Iron Qi was completely stunned.

"Glad I made it in time."

Li Mo sheathed his sword and turned back, grinning.

The two had drunk together last night and were kindred spirits.

To put it simply, they could brag together.

"Brother Li, hurry and go."

"I'll hold them off here!"

The hope that had just risen in Iron Qi's heart shattered again.

That sword technique with such immense power just now was definitely a supreme technique.

Li Mo was only at the Jade Liquid Internal Energy Realm and hadn't even condensed a Profound Pill.

To be able to use such a sword technique to kill an enemy above his realm was already exaggerated; he definitely couldn't recover his energy in a short time.

He himself definitely couldn't escape; he only hoped that this youth he had met once...

"Huh?"

"You want to handle this yourself? Alright, alright."

Iron Qi didn't expect the other's willpower to be so astonishing, wanting to fight even in this state.

After thinking for a moment, Li Mo took something out.

"Open your mouth."

"Ah?"

Iron Qi's mouth was just open, and before he could speak.

He felt something slide down his throat.

"Brother Li, why do you stuff strange things into people's mouths when they open them!?"

"I wasn't bragging yesterday."

Li Mo smiled.

Iron Qi was stunned.

After eating what Brother Li gave him, why did he feel...

His lower body was itching?

Li Mo's ear also rang with a prompt sound:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Iron Qi', helping him complete his disability and saving his life.】

【Investment Feedback: Blood-Soaked War Soul Talisman】

【Blood-Soaked War Soul Talisman】: "One-time use item. Can summon an ancient war spirit to possess the user, drastically increasing combat power and growing braver the longer the battle lasts. Duration: one quarter of an hour."

"Pretty good."

"Too bad it's only one..."

This thing is simply too valuable as a trump card.

Moreover, who knows what variables will arise in this Blood Phoenix Secret Realm. Having this item provides a bit more confidence.
