# Chapter 235: Dumbfounded

Immediately, someone nearby objected, saying, "He's just a practitioner of the New Path. Just deal with him quietly. Do you really want to stir up someone like Cao Qianqiu? Are you insane?"

Several direct descendants of the Cui family were present, responsible for gathering intelligence and information.

Upon hearing this, everyone else's expressions changed. Who was Cao Qianqiu? One of the strongest cultivators in the Outer Realm Pure Land, at the peak of his prime. In this great era of a hundred schools of thought contending, he had the potential to abandon immortality and become an Ancestor.

Someone else rebuked, "Don't play with fire. How could an Ancestral Master-level figure be used by the likes of you? The Pure Yang consciousness aura of such individuals is extremely keen; anyone who intends to harm them might trigger their premonition."

An elder sternly added, "Put away your manipulative schemes. Others avoid that man surnamed Cao as if he were a plague, yet you actively seek to provoke him?" He had a grave expression as he scanned the night sky, fearing that Cao Qianqiu might still be on the plateau, and if he overheard them, a terrifying scene would surely unfold.

Cui Cheng chuckled, "Gentlemen, don't get agitated. I just mentioned it casually. How could 'using another's knife to kill' be so simple and crude? We just need the message to make a few more rounds."

Some shook their heads, believing it was unnecessarily complicating the matter. "If we can confirm his identity, we can go there ourselves and kill him directly, without causing any further complications."

Cui Cheng smiled, "Gentlemen, I want to drag more people into this. Aren't Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun trying to protect him? Wouldn't it be better to use someone else's hand to eliminate them all?"

Night shrouded the crimson plateau, where shouts of battle echoed everywhere. Qin Ming, wielding his blade, traversed this land. For the sake of the Auspicious Beast Blood, he never hesitated to display his power when needed, having slain several "renowned demons" on multiple occasions.

In a desolate underground palace, he stopped to examine the dark, dull stone. He was somewhat uneasy about the tattered cloth woven from exotic metal, as it had previously devoured the divinity of a giant centipede and absorbed the Yin Nether Energy from a ghost pond. If the Essence of Starlight were to be completely consumed by it, he would have nowhere to cry. Qin Ming meticulously inspected it and was relieved to find that it was still well-behaved, never actively damaging items within its storage space.

Qin Ming coveted this dark stone; it was a priceless treasure. Because it could effectively enhance his strength. For a moment, he felt an urge: should he try to refine it now? Nourish his Heavenly Radiance with it, and see if it could undergo a drastic metamorphosis. However, he restrained himself. In the Immortal Dao Domain, he was immersed in the scenario, free to conduct all sorts of experiments, repeatedly courting death, and doing whatever he pleased. But in reality, there was only one chance: either attain perfection or be crippled, or even die on the spot. Besides, he had several ideas and hadn't yet decided whether to refine the Essence of Starlight.

Nevertheless, he could feel its might in advance, which wouldn't take much time or effort; he could experience it instantly. Qin Ming cautiously "tested the goods," as this would influence his decision on which path to take in the future. He used his adhesive energy to position the washbasin-sized stone in front of his right hand, not directly touching it, but with the approximately foot-square tattered cloth separating them. Then, he began to activate his Heavenly Radiance Energy.

In an instant, his eyes stung. The light emanating from his right hand was too awe-inspiring, as if it ignited the night sky, incinerated everything, fiery streaks splattered, and everything was destroyed with overwhelming force. The stone wall in front of the underground palace, originally engraved with demonic runes, was swiftly torn apart, then melted away, completely disintegrating in a golden radiance. Qin Ming quickly pulled back his hand; he was moved! The Heavenly Radiance he activated briefly merged with the Essence of Starlight within the black stone, forming an indestructible immortal sword resembling shattered suns. This display of power startled Qin Ming.

Was this considered a brief fusion with an exotic substance, allowing him to prematurely experience the power of a mid-stage Outer Saint? Clearly, this had flaws, as his cultivation level had not reached the mid-stage Outer Saint realm, and it consumed an enormous amount of Heavenly Radiance, allowing only momentary experience. Moreover, he hadn't refined the Essence of Starlight; without the separating cloth, he would most likely bring harm upon himself and "self-destruct" right there. Such an astounding performance from an "incomplete form" of a mid-stage Outer Saint made Qin Ming's heart stir.

This path was extraordinary. He had only found the Essence of Starlight; he still lacked the opposing "Essence of Night." If he could gather both, how terrifying would that be? Just now, the dazzling Heavenly Radiance illuminating all directions gave Qin Ming a feeling that nothing was impervious.

"This experience should belong to the Pure Yang Palace's cultivation path. If Heavenly Radiance reaches the extreme Yang level, it would truly be terrifying!" Qin Ming knew that if this stone from outside the heavens fell into the hands of Pure Yang Palace, it would undoubtedly be regarded as a supreme treasure.

"Before nourishing it with Heavenly Radiance, it's better to be cautious. If someone discovers it and comes to kill for the treasure, that would be miserable." He frowned. In truth, it wasn't just Pure Yang Palace; the Yin-Yang Temple would also certainly consider it a divine artifact, and all top-tier great sects would covet it. This Essence of Starlight also held immense value for practitioners of the Immortal Path and the Divine Path.

Qin Ming didn't linger. He put the stone into the tattered cloth's space and swiftly departed. Following this, he went all out, slaying famous demons one after another. He continued to push deeper into the plateau. Lu Zizai had told him to go all out and compete fiercely for the Auspicious Beast Blood. Qin Ming didn't want to miss it; Auspicious Blood could allow the physical body to undergo nirvana, shortening the time needed for cultivation and accumulating Dao, making it one of the most coveted treasured medicines for New Path practitioners.

Along the way, his battle merits steadily increased. When he had slain several extremely powerful Fire Crows in front of a cliff piled high with human skulls, he estimated he had accumulated enough to qualify for the Auspicious Blood. "I wonder if a second portion of Auspicious Blood would still be effective on my body," Qin Ming thought, hoping to exert more effort to obtain an additional treasured medicine.

"Qing Xu has lost again. Will his mental state be alright?" On the plateau, a Li family expert frowned deeply, feeling uneasy.

Another person said, "I think he's actually let go. Now he wants to temper himself under a new identity and start anew, which isn't a bad thing." "The plateau is very dangerous. He won't get into trouble, will he?" someone worried. "No worries. He carries a life-preserving immortal talisman from his master's sect; he can retreat calmly at a crucial moment."

At this moment, Li Qingxu, wearing a mask, was traveling alone, gazing at the path ahead. Bristling with killing intent, he swept through all kinds of demons and monsters along the way.

In the territory on the other side of Li Qingxu, several miles away, Little Wu felt that someone was snatching demons from him, and his harvesting speed was clearly affected. He needed to investigate. He believed that some ignorant fellow was maliciously sweeping his path—was this a provocation?

"An interesting piece of information has arrived: Qin Ming, the discarded son of the Cui family, is suspected to have mastered the Silk Scroll Technique!" At this moment, a direct descendant of the Li family responsible for intelligence gathering received this secret news and immediately became interested.

"Silk Scroll? It sounds familiar. What's its origin?" "It's a scripture jointly researched by several Ancestral Masters of the New Path, claimed to rival all scriptures of the Immortal Path and be comparable to the various god-becoming methods of Esoteric Sects, ensuring no other cultivation path monopolizes the glory." "So it's that one. Wasn't it problematic and impossible to master?" "That Qin Ming mastered it by himself!"

On the plateau, some direct descendants of the Li family immediately began to scheme after hearing this. They then learned that Qin Ming had some past entanglement with Li Qingxu, had nearly been killed, and had even revived after his skull was shattered. Naturally, many people in the Li family could only follow the New Path, and they now grew serious. This scripture was of immense origin; if it could be fully mastered, its implications would be far-reaching. Such a Silk Scroll Technique, and such a person, were worth their serious study!

Some people from the Cui family chuckled softly. The news, of course, was sent by them, but it had made several rounds before reaching the Li family. "Hmm, they don't know it's our gift. The information is very 'clean,' completely detaching us from it." These Cui family members naturally didn't dare to provoke Cao Qianqiu directly, but with a little manipulation, having the Li family take the lead was no problem. Although they had ceased hostilities with the Li family, they hadn't forgotten the old animosity from back then. If their family's Old Ancestor hadn't emerged alive from his secluded cultivation, they would have been in grave danger. That old fellow from the Li family, having accumulated strength for a long time, was now quite terrifying. "In that battle, our Cui family's elder generation, whose lifespans were nearing their end, all went to their deaths. What a regrettable pity!" "Once our Old Ancestor emerges from seclusion again, and once Chong He grows to a certain level, we must annihilate the Li family!" these direct descendants of the Cui family vowed fiercely.

Afterward, they smiled, eager to see if Meng Xinghai, Li Qingyun, and others behind Qin Ming had any plans, and if they would be dragged into the mess. Cui Cheng chuckled, "Oh, Li family, don't rush. We'll play with you slowly."

An elder of the Cui family said, "If the Silk Scroll Technique can truly be mastered, we will need to soul-search Qin Ming to get to the bottom of it. The implications of this matter are significant."

On the crimson plateau, after careful consideration, the Li family began to react. "Send this letter out, and after two rounds, find a way for the Cui family to intercept it, letting them test the waters. After all, Qin Ming is very close to the hidden cultivation family behind Li Qingyue." "Be careful to avoid those smiling tigers from the Cui family; send the message to the most reckless ones." The Li family was quite cautious and didn't directly involve themselves. They were very eager to obtain the Silk Scroll Technique and understand how Qin Ming had mastered it, but after careful analysis, they concluded that he might not have mastered it on his own. Perhaps an Ancestral Master who practiced the Silk Scroll Technique was still alive behind Qin Ming, guiding him onto that path. Not knowing enough about Qin Ming, they naturally considered more possibilities. They also wanted to make a move, but decided to wait, observing how the situation unfolded. If they could drag Meng Xinghai, the hidden cultivation family, and the Cui family all into the mess, that would be perfect.

"What did you say? Our Cui family intercepted an important piece of news, and after discovering Qin Ming, some people are now rushing to intercept and kill him?!" Upon hearing this, Cui Cheng and the others were all dumbfounded. This matter truly exceeded their expectations!
