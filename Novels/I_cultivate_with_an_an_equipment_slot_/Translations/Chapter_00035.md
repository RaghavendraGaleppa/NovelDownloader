# Chapter 35: Extreme Speed + Extreme Speed + Speedboat + Lightness

"Stop them! Don't let a single one escape!" The bearded man pointed at Zhang Yan, and the two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators behind him immediately gave chase.

At this moment, Zhang Yan had already flown dozens of zhang away on his Golden Bamboo Sword. When he left the Liu Family, he had equipped both the Lightness Boots and the Green Wood Boat in case of emergencies. Both of these magical artifacts possessed the Extreme Speed attribute.

With the combined effects of two Extreme Speed attributes, the perfected speedboat technique of the Green Wood Boat, and the enhancement from the Lightness Technique, Zhang Yan's speed was astonishingly fast.

The two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators chasing him on paper kites were dumbfounded. How the hell were they supposed to catch up?

"How is this kid flying so fast?" a pale-faced cultivator asked the red-faced cultivator beside him.

"Look at his flying artifact, then look at ours," the red-faced cultivator replied, stomping on the paper kite beneath his feet. Although the paper kite was also a flying artifact, its speed was severely limited—slow and sluggish. Moreover, their kites were patched up. Catching Zhang Yan was nearly impossible.

"What do we do then? If we let these two escape, we'll be in big trouble!" The pale-faced cultivator grew even paler.

"Don't worry, they won't get away." The red-faced cultivator calmly tugged at his sleeve, and a green-headed hornet flew out. With a flick of his finger, he tossed a drop of spirit honey. The hornet caught it mid-air before darting off in a specific direction.

"No matter how fast that kid runs, he's still only at the early stage of Qi Refining. His spiritual energy won't sustain long-distance travel, especially since he's carrying dead weight."

"This Crimson Jade Hornet excels at tracking. We don't need to be faster than him—we just need to follow him. Sooner or later, we'll wear him down. You take a shortcut to ambush them while I continue tracking."

The red-faced cultivator urged his paper kite forward at "extreme speed." Unlike his companion's, his kite wasn't patched up, allowing for slightly faster flight.

In theory, the red-faced cultivator wasn't wrong. Zhang Yan had nearly exhausted his spiritual energy after less than half an hour of flying on the Golden Bamboo Sword. But he remained completely unfazed.

He stowed the Golden Bamboo Sword, then removed the Green Wood Boat and placed Liu Yiting on it before continuing his flight. Though the Green Wood Boat was a high-grade artifact, its speed couldn't compare to the Golden Bamboo Sword, which had double Extreme Speed attributes, perfected speedboat technique, and the Lightness Technique.

However, as a high-grade flying artifact, the Green Wood Boat could carry multiple people and was powered by spirit stones. After switching to spirit stones, Zhang Yan sat cross-legged on the boat to recover his energy. He held a spirit stone in his hand, continuously absorbing its energy. At that moment, he wished he had a Heavenly Spirit Root.

Spirit roots didn't just determine cultivation speed—they also affected how quickly one could recover spiritual energy. Even during meditation, others would always be faster.

"If I ever find spirit materials, I'm upgrading my spirit root. Even if I can't reach high-grade, mid-grade would be fine!" Zhang Yan sighed inwardly, eyes closed.

While recovering his energy, he continued piloting the boat—but not toward the Liu Family. Since the enemy was targeting them, returning there might lead to an ambush. Instead, he decided to head for Qingheng Market, which wasn't far. Once there, he'd be safe. As for the Liu Family, Zhang Yan had his hands full just protecting Liu Yiting—that was already more than enough repayment for Elder Liu's kindness.

Besides, the Liu Family's estate had protective formations. It wouldn't fall so easily.

At the same time, Zhang Yan took out his Qingheng Sect jade token. The token had multiple uses: identification, storing contribution points, and even message transmission—though the latter had a distance limitation. Otherwise, he could have called for help from the sect.

After meditating for fifteen minutes, Zhang Yan had recovered about eighty percent of his energy. Suddenly, his expression changed as he looked into the distance.

The red-faced cultivator was approaching on his paper kite, which was now covered in yellow talismans—Speed Talismans. Though they increased his speed, the kite was on the verge of collapse. Yet the cultivator didn't seem to care. In his mind, capturing Zhang Yan would earn him a flying sword—who needed a tattered kite when they could have something so sleek?

But when he finally saw Zhang Yan, his jaw dropped. The kid was now on a flying boat—a high-grade artifact at that!

A high-grade flying artifact! The red-faced cultivator's face flushed even redder with envy. What kind of treatment was this? A measly early-stage Qi Refining cultivator with two flying artifacts? A flying sword was one thing, but a flying boat too? Was he the Liu Family patriarch's illegitimate son or something? No—even a legitimate son wouldn't get this kind of treatment.

---

"Damn it." Despite spotting the red-faced cultivator, Zhang Yan remained calm. Instead, he stood up and called out, "Fellow Daoist, I am a disciple of the Qingheng Sect. Would you be so kind as to let me pass?" He raised his jade token.

"A Qingheng Sect disciple?!" The red-faced cultivator's expression shifted. The Qingheng Sect ruled the Tianmu Mountain Range—everything here technically belonged to them. Families like his were merely tenants. Worse, the sect was notoriously protective of its members. Attacking a disciple meant certain death.

But he had already crossed Zhang Yan. His eyes darted around. They were deep in the Tianmu Mountain Range—if a Qingheng disciple died here, no one would know who did it. And that high-grade flying boat... Even if he couldn't use it openly, selling it on the black market would be a windfall.

This was his chance! He had sent the pale-faced cultivator away precisely to monopolize Zhang Yan's artifacts. Forcing a smile, he said, "Ah, so it's a junior brother from the Qingheng Sect! What a misunderstanding. Are you returning to the sect? Let this senior brother escort you."

"Escort me?" Zhang Yan feigned hesitation, his youthful appearance adding to the act. But then he shook his head. "No need, senior brother. I can manage alone."

"Ah, but it's dangerous out here. I can't let you go alone!" The red-faced cultivator inched closer.

"If senior brother insists... then rest in peace!" Seeing the distance close, Zhang Yan's eyes narrowed—and he struck.
