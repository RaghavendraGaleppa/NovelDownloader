# Chapter 6: Abandoning Cultivation  

Gu Mo had discovered a new use for the Solar Essence—it could disperse the black mist within the dark mist space. Although each portion of Solar Essence could only clear a tiny fraction of the mist, this discovery still filled him with excitement.  

His Sunflower had come from that black mist space. If he could clear the mist, would he be able to find more Sunflowers?  

One Sunflower had already granted him the cultivation speed of a low-grade spiritual root cultivator. With two, his speed would approach that of a mid-grade spiritual root. And if he could obtain five Sunflowers, his cultivation speed would rival that of a high-grade spiritual root cultivator.  

The thought alone sent a surge of exhilaration through Gu Mo. He was tempted to immediately use all the Solar Essence he harvested each day to disperse the black mist. But reality reminded him that his top priority now was to improve his cultivation.  

Only by reaching the Qi Refining stage and becoming a spirit farmer could he plant Sunflowers in spirit fields. Currently, growing them in pots was merely a temporary measure.  

Gu Mo could sense the spiritual energy in the pot gradually depleting. Once it was completely exhausted, the Sunflower, deprived of spiritual energy, would no longer be able to condense Solar Essence.  

Fortunately, after becoming an official outer disciple, the sect had issued him three spirit stones. He could hold on for a while longer, but he absolutely had to reach the Qi Refining stage before the spirit stones ran out.  

Checking the time, Gu Mo set off for the private dining room where they had met before. When he arrived, Yao Shifeng and the other three were already there, deep in discussion.  

"Gu Mo, which peak do you plan to go to?" Yao Shifeng asked as soon as he saw him.  

As outer disciples, they would eventually be assigned to various peaks for labor, but for now, they still had some choice in the matter.  

"The Spirit Plant Hall!"  

Gu Mo didn’t hesitate. The spirit fields of the Green Dew Sect were all managed by the Spirit Plant Hall. If he wanted to become a spirit farmer, that was where he needed to be.  

His answer took the other four by surprise. Among the various paths of cultivation, the most popular were alchemy, artifact forging, formations, and talismans. Thus, the four peaks dedicated to these arts were the most sought after—not just for the work but for the chance to learn a valuable skill, which would provide a foundation for their future.  

Yao Shifeng and the others had each chosen one of these four peaks: Hu Hai for Alchemy Peak, Wu Jinfei for Artifact Peak, Chu Feifei for Formation Peak, and Yao Shifeng himself for Talisman Peak.  

Gu Mo’s choice of the Spirit Plant Hall was undoubtedly the least popular. After all, what future was there in being a mere spirit farmer?  

"Going to different peaks means we can complement each other better," Gu Mo said with a smile after learning their choices.  

"True enough."  

Yao Shifeng nodded but didn’t press further. Gu Mo had only been brought into the group to make up numbers, barely managing to achieve Qi Induction at the last moment. His aptitude was among the poorest even for a low-grade spiritual root, and now he had chosen the dead-end path of a spirit farmer. It meant he would be of limited help to Yao Shifeng in the future.  

If it had been someone else, Yao Shifeng might have tried to persuade them. But for Gu Mo, becoming a spirit farmer was probably his best option. With his talent, none of the more prestigious peaks would likely want him anyway.  

After settling the discussion about their future assignments, the conversation turned to the most crucial topic—cultivation. Wu Jinfei brought up the difficulties he had encountered in his cultivation over the past week, and Yao Shifeng, drawing from his own insights, provided explanations. Hu Hai and Chu Feifei also raised their own questions, all of which Yao Shifeng answered.  

Gu Mo, however, didn’t ask anything. So far, he hadn’t encountered any real obstacles—thanks to the incredible efficiency of Solar Essence.  

The problems the other three faced mostly revolved around expanding their meridians and completing small circulations. The key to smoothly expanding meridians lay in the amount of spiritual energy and the control over it.  

The amount of spiritual energy depended on how much a cultivator could refine each day. Gu Mo absorbed Solar Essence directly, bypassing the need for refinement. Moreover, one portion of Solar Essence was equivalent to two days of hard cultivation, matching the accumulation speed of a low-grade spiritual root cultivator—far surpassing the other four.  

As for spiritual energy control, the energy derived from Solar Essence was exceptionally pure, making it incredibly easy to manipulate.  

This meant that as long as Gu Mo accumulated enough spiritual energy, he could directly complete a small circulation and advance to the first level of Qi Refining without encountering any bottlenecks.  

Though he had no questions, Gu Mo still listened attentively to Yao Shifeng’s explanations. He noticed that Yao Shifeng answered Wu Jinfei’s questions in the greatest detail—because, aside from Yao Shifeng himself, Wu Jinfei had the best aptitude among the five.  

Naturally, Yao Shifeng would invest more effort in those with better potential, as they would yield greater returns in the future. As for someone like Gu Mo, even if he never asked a single question, Yao Shifeng wouldn’t bother to inquire.  

That said, Yao Shifeng wouldn’t openly snub Gu Mo either. Maintaining harmony within the group was important, and he wasn’t foolish enough to actively exclude him.  

As dusk fell, their gathering came to an end, and they agreed to meet again in a week.  

"Gu Mo, are you really going to the Spirit Plant Hall? There’s no future there," Hu Hai called out as Gu Mo prepared to leave.  

"Of course!"  

Gu Mo turned and smiled. "I’ll bring you some spirit rice when the time comes."  

"Alright."  

Seeing Gu Mo’s resolve, Hu Hai didn’t press further and left with a nod.  

Back in his hut, Gu Mo retrieved the Sunflower from the dark mist space. Unfortunately, it was already late, and he had missed another day’s worth of Solar Essence.  

But the Sunflower was far too important, and he didn’t dare leave it unattended while he was away.  

Without Solar Essence, Gu Mo had no choice but to cultivate on his own. The shortcomings of his low-grade spiritual root became painfully apparent—his progress was agonizingly slow.  

Eventually, Gu Mo stopped. If he didn’t have the Sunflower, he would have gritted his teeth and pressed on. But with it, his cultivation speed was comparable to that of a low-grade spiritual root cultivator.  

He could afford to abandon the inefficient part—his own cultivation—and rely entirely on Solar Essence. True, this meant sacrificing half of his potential speed, reducing it from three times (his own cultivation plus Solar Essence) to just two times (Solar Essence alone).  

But in exchange, he gained a wealth of time. Eight hours of his own cultivation barely equaled half a portion of Solar Essence. It was far better to use that time for other pursuits, such as learning spells.  

As a cultivator, he couldn’t focus solely on cultivation—he needed to master some techniques as well.  

While the other outer disciples were pouring all their effort into cultivation to reach the Qi Refining stage as quickly as possible, Gu Mo could use his freed-up time to start learning spells early—without delaying his cultivation progress. With one portion of Solar Essence equaling two days of hard work, his speed would still outpace that of other outer disciples with low-grade spiritual roots.  

With this in mind, Gu Mo ignored the darkening sky and headed straight for the scripture pavilion. Inside, there were many low-tier spells perfect for someone like him who hadn’t yet reached the Qi Refining stage.  

"This one!"  

His eyes quickly scanned the shelves before settling on a particular spell manual. Picking it up, he began studying it intently.
