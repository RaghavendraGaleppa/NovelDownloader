# Chapter 244: Liu Haizhu's Transformation  

Huang Jiu had struck it rich.  

A mere nine-year-old child becoming wealthy—the villagers couldn't comprehend it. Some went to ask, and the answer they received was: "I met an immortal."  

What nonsense.  

Thieves coveted the child's silver and tried to steal it at night, only to meet their doom. Others attempted extortion in broad daylight and suffered the same fate.  

Within days, no one dared trouble Huang Jiu again.  

Seeing that the child could now fend for himself, Xiao Ji prepared to leave. Before departing, he swaggered into the sizable village.  

The village rarely saw cultivators or wandering martial artists.  

The sudden appearance of a Daoist priest with an otherworldly aura piqued everyone's curiosity. Donkey drivers halted their carts, farmers stopped plowing with their water buffaloes, and even the gossiping old women at the village's central crossroads fell silent.  

"That doesn’t look like a proper Daoist at all..."  

Murmurs arose behind Xiao Ji as he passed the crossroads.  

When he arrived at Huang Jiu's home, the child immediately knelt and kowtowed upon seeing him. Many witnessed the scene.  

"You are blessed with great fortune. Do no evil in the future," Xiao Ji said before conjuring a pristine white cloud beneath his feet, its edges gilded in gold, and leisurely ascended into the sky.  

Those who saw this spectacle fell to their knees, believing the immortal to be the God of Wealth—after all, whose divine cloud would be adorned with golden edges?  

With this display, no one would dare bully Huang Jiu from then on.  

In a village where eyewitnesses abounded, the tale would spread like wildfire, ensuring no one would ever scheme against Huang Jiu again.  

Thus, an inexplicable bond came to a fitting end.  

Now, Xiao Ji was ready to begin his own connection with the East Sea.  

---  

Journeying to the East Sea was a significant undertaking, one of great importance to Xiao Ji.  

Venturing into the depths of the ocean would take an unknown length of time.  

Before setting off, he needed to return to the Primordial Spirit Temple for a while—first, to strengthen the temple's private domain. Now that he had reached the Nascent Soul stage, the power of his personal domain could be enhanced further. He also wanted to tend to his master and fulfill his filial duties.  

Second, he needed to gather information about the East Sea—legends, unofficial histories of the Dragon Palace, and the secrets of the dragon race. Such knowledge would greatly aid his understanding of the region.  

Most importantly, he needed a map of the East Sea's waterways and the "Chart of Ten Thousand Seas."  

Though oceanic maps were often crude and imprecise, Xiao Ji didn’t mind. As long as they provided a general direction and location, he could fill in the details himself.  

Gathering the materials wouldn’t take long. He only needed to voice his request, and Constable Song Yuanbao of Willow Town would personally ensure the materials were delivered.  

Having connections in the yamen certainly made things easier.

**Primordial Spirit Temple**  

Just as before he left, visitors didn’t come to burn incense—they came to see if the great peacock would ever move.  

"I refuse to believe I’ll die before seeing you twitch even once," an old white-haired man grumbled stubbornly, leaning on his cane as he glared at the peacock.  

"Grandfather, you’re eighty years old. Let it go and come home to rest," his grandson pleaded sorrowfully.  

"Seems I’ll never get the chance," the old man sighed bitterly before turning to his grandson with gritted teeth. "When you make offerings to our ancestors, don’t forget to tell me if it moves."  

The grandson agreed.  

Most visitors to the temple were similarly obsessed, trapped in their own stubborn hopes.  

At night, the temple closed its doors, and the day’s business ended.  

Wang Yaoda reverted to human form.  

He wished he could move for the townsfolk of Willow Town, but he simply couldn’t.  

Though the situation was far from ideal, things were improving. At least he could now return to his true form, even if he remained immobile.  

Before coming to the temple, he had nearly forgotten what he even looked like.  

**Main Hall**  

Liu Haizhu stood before the statue of the temple’s founder, lost in thought.  

Dinner was still some time away.  

Ying Xiao swept the floor of the hall, contemplating the wisdom of governing the world through the simple act of cleaning.  

Wang Yaoda burned incense before the founder’s statue, praying for the restoration of his former power as a great demon king.  

Xiao Ji wandered the hall for a while before, unusually, joining Liu Haizhu for a game of chess.  

These days, Liu Haizhu consulted a strategy manual before every move—whether this counted as cheating was debatable.  

While his master studied the manual, Xiao Ji observed him closely. He noticed a few strands of beard had fallen out, and within his hair, black strands had begun to appear.  

"Master, what have you been washing your hair with lately?" Xiao Ji asked.  

"A comb," Liu Haizhu replied absentmindedly, still focused on the manual.  

In other words, he hadn’t washed it at all.  

But why would his once entirely white hair now show black strands? It was a mystery worth pondering.  

**[Liu Haizhu, Master of the Primordial Spirit Temple. Cultivation: Theoretical Half-Step Qi Refining… Remaining Lifespan: 12 years, 6 months, 16 days, 7 ke, 24 breaths…]**  

Liu Haizhu’s cultivation and lifespan were peculiar. Xiao Ji had studied them many times but could never uncover the root cause.  

There seemed to be something connected to him, but it remained elusive—only a shadowy presence Xiao Ji couldn’t grasp.  

His cultivation weakened day by day, yet his lifespan fluctuated unpredictably, sometimes lengthening, sometimes shortening.  

"Don’t think you can distract me during the game," Liu Haizhu warned, glancing up. "Trying to disrupt my focus won’t work."  

*Clack.*  

He set the manual aside and placed a piece on the wooden board, satisfied with his move.  

"Checkmate," Xiao Ji declared, sliding his chariot piece into position.  

They were playing xiangqi this time.  

Liu Haizhu stared silently at the board before turning to Ying Xiao, who was still sweeping. "Girl, come here… He’s cheating."  

While Ying Xiao put away her tools, Xiao Ji spoke with his master.  

"Master, I plan to journey to the East Sea. I may be gone for a long time," he said.  

"The East Sea? Bring back some seafood," Liu Haizhu replied as he reset the board. "Crucian carp from the East Sea makes excellent soup—very flavorful."  

"Master, crucian carp are freshwater fish," Xiao Ji corrected gently.  

Liu Haizhu’s memory wasn’t just failing—it was becoming increasingly disordered.  

Xiao Ji regretted correcting him, feeling a pang of sorrow.  

Liu Haizhu didn’t seem to mind. After a pause, he fell into thought. "I first met her by the East Sea. I wonder how she’s been lately… I miss her."  

He stood, lit a stick of incense, and offered it to the founder’s statue—likely praying for her well-being.  

"Who is 'her'?" Ying Xiao asked, setting down her broom and sitting on a cushion. "Wang Yaoda, stop burning incense. Come listen to the story. You waste too much—the founder can’t possibly consume it all."  

After much elaboration, they finally understood: "her" was a woman—a stunningly beautiful and formidable hammer-wielding immortal who smashed anyone in her path…  

The tale was drenched in bloodshed.  

*So Master likes that type…* Xiao Ji imagined the violent scene of a hammer-wielding fairy crushing her foes.  

"Master, where is this peerless fairy now?" Ying Xiao asked.  

Liu Haizhu shook his head. "I can’t remember. I’d like to find her… She’s so important to me. I hope she’s still alive."  

Seeing his master’s melancholy, Xiao Ji said, "I never knew Master had someone in his heart."  

Liu Haizhu’s thoughts seemed to drift before he sighed. "I, too, once loved."  

The abrupt shift from tales of slaying demons, devouring dragons, and battling immortals to this tender, nostalgic story left them momentarily speechless.  

Once emotions settled, they prepared for dinner.  

After the meal, they retired for the night.  

Everything was as usual.  

---  

**The Next Morning**  

Chaos erupted in the temple.  

"Stop right there, intruder!"  

Ying Xiao and Wang Yaoda stood outside Liu Haizhu’s door—one wielding a broom, the other poised in a peacock-style fist stance—blocking the entrance. Something strange was happening inside.  

The peacock fist resembled crane-style boxing, with slight variations in hand positioning.  

Hearing the commotion, Xiao Ji stepped out and approached the scene.  

"What’s all this noise?" came Liu Haizhu’s voice from inside—but it sounded stronger, more vigorous.  

Ying Xiao pointed inside. "This impostor ate your master!"  

"Nonsense! What’s gotten into you today, girl?" the voice retorted.  

Xiao Ji stepped forward.  

Inside stood a Daoist in his fifties, bearing a striking resemblance to Liu Haizhu—but the age was wrong. His master had been white-haired and white-bearded, yet this man had black hair and beard, streaked with only a few silver strands.  

**[This is indeed Liu Haizhu. He has grown younger.]**  

Xiao Ji handed him a bronze mirror. Staring at his reflection, Liu Haizhu was equally stunned. "Who is this?"  

No one could explain why Liu Haizhu had rejuvenated. It seemed to have happened overnight.  

Though his appearance had grown younger, his memory was even more fragmented—many things now lost to him.
