# Chapter 1: The Bride Who Doesn't Want to Be Unemployed

A sliver of a moon hung between the mountain peaks, like a piece of crisp bone wedged in a wild dog's tooth. On the Gobi Desert, the scattered bonfires resembled phosphorescent lights flickering through a field of graves.

The bonfires marked a campsite. At the center of the camp, atop a high mound, stood a large felt tent—the wedding tent for the union of the Tianwater Yu family and the Jincheng Suo family.

Bridesman Yang Can hurried into the tent and saw the bride sitting there in her bright red wedding gown and phoenix coronet. Her hands rested on her knees, her posture graceful and dignified.

Yang Can couldn't help but sigh inwardly, feeling a sudden sense of kinship. For the groom was dead, killed by a stray arrow from bandits. He, the bridesman, best man, and private secretary, was about to become unemployed, and the bride before him... had already lost her position.

Yang Can composed himself and stepped forward to bow. "May I ask why the young mistress has summoned this servant?"

The bride rose gracefully and spoke in a soft, melancholy voice. "There is something I do not understand, and I seek your counsel."

"Please give your orders, young mistress."

"The groom is dead. To whom should I, the bride, go into the bridal chamber?"

"Ah?" Yang Can looked up abruptly, his face a mask of shock.

The bride drifted toward Yang Can, her long wedding veil trailing over the carpet like flowing clouds. "Why not have you, Master Yang, take his place? What do you say?"

Yang Can's mind went completely blank.

*What kind of nonsense is this?*

*Have me take the groom's place in the... bridal chamber?*

*The groom just died. His body is still warm...*

Indeed, the groom had just died. It hadn't even been an hour; his body hadn't even grown stiff.

Earlier that evening, their procession, which had traveled to Jincheng to fetch the bride and was now returning, had made camp on this stretch of the Gobi when a group of bandits suddenly appeared.

The bandits had come and gone like the wind, making off with some valuables and casually taking the groom's life in the process.

The groom had died from a stray arrow.

As the groom's幕客 (private secretary), best man, and bridesman, from that moment on, Yang Can had officially switched professions to "funeral master."

In this desolate place, far from any village or town, it was impossible to find a coffin for the young master. But Secretary Yang was clever. On a sudden inspiration, he decided to dismantle the carriages and use the wooden planks to hastily assemble a makeshift coffin.

He was in the middle of enthusiastically dismantling a carriage with his men when the bride sent for him. He never expected her to make such a bizarre demand.

Could it be that the bride, suddenly thrust into the role of a widow, had been driven mad by the shock?

A veil strung with pearls obscured the bride's peerlessly beautiful face, so Yang Can couldn't see if her eyes held a crazed look.

This bride was named Suo Chanzhi, a noble daughter of the Jincheng Suo family.

And the not-yet-stiff groom was named Yu Chengye, the heir apparent of the Tianwater Yu family.

The Suo and Yu families were both powerful clans in Longshang, and this marriage was a perfect match of social status.

As for Yang Can, he was a private secretary Yu Chengye had hired half a year ago.

Ever since he saw Suo Chanzhi, Secretary Yang had fantasized about a forbidden scenario: "Young Mistress, don't turn around, it's me, your young master."

Because this bride was just too beautiful!

Various tribes lived intermingled in Longshang—Xianbei, Quanrong, various Qiang tribes, Han people... which is why there were many beauties here.

But even in a place known for producing beautiful women, Suo Chanzhi was a peerless beauty.

However, such improper thoughts were just that—thoughts. In a lifetime, who doesn't have their moments of fantasy?

Now that his fantasy had come true, Yang Can only felt terrified. He had already sensed that there were people lying in ambush outside the tent.

It seemed that if he didn't agree, he wouldn't be able to walk away unscathed tonight.

When Suo Chanzhi spoke these shocking words, her expression was calm.

Of course, that was just forced composure. If she hadn't said it all in one breath, she wouldn't have had the courage to speak again.

Even so, her beautiful face had turned the color of a burning cloud. Fortunately, the pearl curtain under her phoenix coronet hid her shame.

And beneath her "twelve-panel" multicolored skirt, her long, straight legs were trembling uncontrollably.

"Young Mistress... why would you say such a thing?"

Yang Can spoke with a look of astonishment. If there weren't people lying in ambush outside, he would have thought the young mistress had gone mad.

"Yu Chengye is dead, and I have not yet consummated the marriage with him. Master Yang, do you know what this means for me?"

Under the phoenix coronet's pearl curtain, a look of unspeakable bitterness crossed her peerlessly beautiful face.

Yang Can当然 knew. He had transmigrated to this world three years ago, and he was already well-versed in many of the world's customs and rules.

He knew that if a groom died on the way to fetch the bride, the bride was considered a "roadside widow," a woman seen as extremely inauspicious.

Suo Chanzhi was a noble daughter of the Suo clan and the wife of the Yu clan's heir. In the future, she would be the mistress of the Yu household, a position of immense prestige.

But now, her life would be devoid of light, left with nothing but endless darkness until her black hair turned to snow.

Suo Chanzhi sighed softly. "I am not a legitimate daughter of the Suo clan. Becoming the wife of the Yu family's heir was very important to me.

Now this has happened... but I refuse to accept my fate.

So, even if the groom is in his coffin, this marriage must be completed! To put it plainly, I need..."

A faint flush appeared at the corners of Suo Chanzhi's upturned eyes. "...a child."

Yang Can finally understood what Suo Chanzhi meant. This bride wanted to...

*Borrow a seed?!*

Yu Chengye had led a team to Jincheng to fetch the bride and was on his way back to Tianwater. The journey had already taken more than half a month.

Along the way, Yu Chengye had used the excuse that "the road is crude, it is not proper to offend a beauty" and had not consummated the marriage.

However, since the central part of the camp was attended by Suo family servants, not many people knew about this.

Besides the few Suo family maids who served the couple closely, it was probably only Yang Can, the groom's bridesman, who knew.

Therefore, as long as Yang Can was pulled into this plan, it should be possible to deceive everyone. Perhaps that was why he had been chosen.

Once Suo Chanzhi had a child, and it was a boy, then this child would naturally become the heir of the Yu family's main line.

In this way, even if Yu Chengye died, the main line of the Yu family would not be without an heir, and Suo Chanzhi, as the wife of the main heir, would retain her rightful status.

But what about me? Before that, I'd probably be silenced, right?

The Suo family would never let such a thing be exposed; it would ruin their reputation and destroy the friendship between the two clans.

"I want a child, so I must first have a man..."

As Suo Chanzhi spoke, her cheeks grew even hotter. She tried to mask her embarrassment and anxiety with pride and haughtiness, forcing herself to lift her chin.

She was only seventeen. How could she remain calm and composed while making such an absurd request?

Originally, she would have rather died than do such a thing, but her dowry matron, Madam Tu, had persuaded her for a long time.

Madam Tu had analyzed the pros and cons for her, weighed the gains and losses...

In the end, she had been convinced.

She didn't want to end up in the miserable situation Madam Tu had described.

She was not a legitimate daughter of the Suo main line, and her father and brothers' position in the Suo family was not very good.

Marrying into the Tianwater Yu family was a crucial opportunity for her branch of the family to gain the clan's attention.

Only if this marriage had value could her father and brothers receive the倾斜 of the family's resources.

And only then would she herself not become a "roadside widow," to be kept in a gilded cage by the Yu family for the rest of her life.

But to break this predicament, she first had to find a man and successfully conceive a child.

"Master Yang, if you comply with me, in the Yu family's main line, from now on, you will be second only to me alone.

And your child will have the chance to become the master of the Yu family in the future. I think... you won't refuse, will you?"

Suo Chanzhi said this with feigned pride. She gently tugged the tie at her neck, and her long wedding veil slid off. Suppressing her shame, she placed a delicate hand on Yang Can's shoulder.

That soft hand slid suggestively toward Yang Can's chest. Where her fingertips touched, Yang Can's muscles tensed as if electrocuted.

Suo Chanzhi felt the change in Yang Can's muscles. She had thought Secretary Yang was a weak, scholarly man with no strength to bind a chicken, but she hadn't expected him to be so... well-built. This made Suo Chanzhi even more satisfied.

Although she had to find a man to go into the bridal chamber with her to change her fate, which made her feel deeply humiliated, there were over three hundred strong men in the camp. For Miss Suo to choose whomever she wanted tonight... wasn't that also a kind of forbidden pleasure?

"Young Mistress, surely... you have other choices besides me?"

Although Yang Can asked this, he already knew that no matter why the bride had chosen him, from the moment he learned this secret, he had no way out:

Either comply, or die.

"The people who came with my dowry are all my servants. How could this young lady let a servant offend his master?"

Suo Chanzhi's reply was righteous. She and Yang Can were very close. Although this wasn't the first time she had met Secretary Yang, it was the first time she had looked at him from such a close distance.

Yang Can was twenty-two or twenty-three, with handsome and elegant features, a clear jawline, and eyes that, in the candlelight, were the color of amber.

Unlike the pale, weak sons of the Central Plains, or the crude, barbaric warriors of Longshang, he had a perfect blend of strength and softness.

"As for why I chose you..."

Suo Chanzhi's voice paused. She didn't want to admit that compared to the groom, she had always preferred Yang Can's type.

So when she had to accept Madam Tu's suggestion, the first male image that popped into her mind was the Secretary Yang before her.

"Of course, it's because... among the Yu family, you're the only one I'm familiar with!"

Yang Can sneered inwardly. He didn't believe a word of Suo Chanzhi's explanation.

It should be because I'm the only one on the Yu family's side who knows your secret about not consummating the marriage, right?

Pulling me into this, and then killing only me after it's done, is that not equivalent to silencing two witnesses at once?

"So, life or death, Master Yang, have you made your choice?"

Suo Chanzhi asked, her finger on Yang Can's chest lifting slightly to hook his chin. The feeling of being high and mighty, of taking what she wanted, temporarily dispelled the humiliation in her heart.

But the next moment, she tumbled into Yang Can's arms.

"You... what are you going to do?" Suo Chanzhi's face instantly lost its color.

"Of course, I'm going to do what you wish, young mistress."

Yang Can answered her as he wrapped his arms around Suo Chanzhi's small waist. Since a beheading is a beheading whether you stretch out your neck or shrink back, and he was dead either way, what was the point of being coy?

Suo Chanzhi suddenly felt as if she were riding on clouds. Then she realized she had been roughly thrown onto the large bed.

Her phoenix coronet slipped off, and her light body bounced a few times on the soft mattress.

Suo Chanzhi was enraged by Yang Can's roughness. She flipped over, propping herself up on the bed with one hand, her phoenix eyes narrowed as she glared at Yang Can.

Her posture and aura were like a cat that had puffed itself up, its back arched, hissing in threat.

"Yang Can, how dare you!"

"Young Mistress, what Yang has is not just his courage!" Knowing there was no way out, Yang Can, his heart hardened, no longer had any scruples.

Since transmigrating to this world, he had experienced the desperate times of wandering and starvation. That kind of suffering, he never wanted to endure again.

好不容易 found Yu Chengye, such a big tree, and had enjoyed its shade for less than half a year before it was chopped down with a crack.

With his employer dead, as a幕客, his future was already uncertain. Now, to be dragged into such a conspiracy by Suo Chanzhi, Secretary Yang was furious!

Yang Can suddenly ripped open his belt, and his black Lánshā robe immediately fell open.

When a mouse is too big, even a cat will flee.

The hissing cat, upon seeing something, suddenly turned red to her ears and scrambled to escape.

But she had barely made it to the other end of the bed when her delicate ankle was caught by a large hand.

"Ah—!"

With a startled cry, the bride "whooshed" back from the far end of the bed to his side.
