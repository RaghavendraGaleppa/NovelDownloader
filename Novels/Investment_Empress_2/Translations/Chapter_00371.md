# Chapter 371: Ancestral Worship and the Nian Beast (Part 1)

“You’ve grown up...”

Little Ice Cube turned her gaze, looking at his chubby baby face.

She furrowed her delicate brows, reached out to pinch his face, rubbed it, and pulled on it, making Li Mo grimace in pain. She pursed her lips, looking unsatisfied.

“Ouch... Don’t be in such a rush. You’ll understand once I draw it.”

What kind of self should he draw?

Little Master Li fell into deep thought, gently poking his own cheek with the butt of the brush. After a moment of contemplation, his bright, dark eyes lit up.

That day, he had also been drawing.

And he had accidentally gotten ink on his face...

Images from a time that didn’t belong to this moment slowly appeared on the paper. Thus, the sunset of that day in the Autumn Water Pavilion illuminated today’s canvas.

In the painting, the少年 (young man) was off to the side, drawing the少女 (young girl). His bright and handsome face still had a few smudges of ink...

“The eyes and brows do have a bit of resemblance,” Lady Ying nodded.

“What resemblance? Big Brother Li is so burly. Little Mo definitely made himself look better on purpose.”

Ying Xuliang clicked his tongue like a dead duck, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart.

Seeing how the Li boy looked grown up, why did he feel even more like he wanted to beat him up?

“Boys take after their mothers when they grow up.”

Lady Ying smiled gently, not letting her husband find fault.

As everyone knows, a father-in-law looks at his son-in-law and gets more annoyed the more he looks, while a mother-in-law looks at her son-in-law and gets happier the more she looks...

Wait.

Wasn’t their mood a bit too complex for that? These two little ones were still so young; the childhood engagement was just...

“.....”

The sunset illuminated the sunset in the painting, and it also illuminated Little Ying Bing’s mirror-like eyes, breaking through the snow-white color deep within them.

She couldn’t help but reach out and gently touch the face of the少年 in the painting, letting her fingertips also be stained with a bit of ink.

“How is it? Is the painting good?”

Little Master Li raised his head, feeling a bit proud.

Then, he felt a chill on his philtrum.

“?”

The little hand with ink-stained fingertips poked his philtrum.

“Hmm, now you look even more like the one in the painting.”

Little Ying Bing spoke softly, glancing at her parents who were talking on the side. Her clear eyes turned complex.

“It’s time for dumplings!”

The New Year’s Eve dinner at the Ying family courtyard was about to begin. After the dinner, they would worship their ancestors, recounting the major events of the family over the past year to them, and praying for a smooth year ahead.

This was quite similar to the traditions of other commoners in Qinghe County.

Soon, in front of the brightly lit ancestral hall, a large pot was boiling dumplings outdoors. The sound of firecrackers came intermittently from the side, and the gray night sky was stained with the atmosphere of fireworks.

The Ying family was a large clan with a profound background.

For the New Year’s banquet, neighbors and people from the county could come to eat and join the fun, which showed the prosperity of the family.

Little Li Mo sat there with a frowns on his face, looking at the Little Ice Cube beside him.

Little Ice Cube was still Little Ice Cube, which meant the dream still showed no signs of waking up.

Little Ying Bing picked up a dumpling, her gaze a bit absent-minded, looking at the Ying family courtyard during the New Year.

“Wife, where’s the vinegar? How can I eat dumplings without vinegar?”

Old Father Ying Xuliang looked at the two little ones, asked his wife for the vinegar, and prepared to give the dumplings a thorough bath.

“You really are... Little Bing finally has a friend. That’s a good thing.”

“I know, but I just want to eat something sour.”

“Then go ahead. I’ll go find a red envelope for Little Mo. We can’t lose etiquette.”

Ying Xuliang ate his dumplings: “Why hasn’t he gone back to his own home for the New Year’s Eve dinner yet?”

---

“You forgot, the Li family eats their New Year’s Eve dinner late,” Lady Ying reminded.

“That’s right. Big Brother Li is probably patrolling the streets. If he happens to pass by later...”

“Dad, eat your dumplings.”

A dumpling was夹 (picked up) with chopsticks and brought before his eyes. The chopsticks were held by a small hand.

Ying Xuliang’s eyes widened suddenly, and he was stunned for a long time.

It was Bing?

At this moment, the old father suddenly felt like crying. Bing had never liked communicating with people since she was little, even with her parents. There were even rumors in the county that his daughter was a fool.

Today, Bing seemed to have changed.

“Good, delicious, these dumplings are really fragrant.”

“Uh, Little Mo, you eat too.”

Ying Xuliang was stunned for a moment, then his face broke into a wide smile.

Lady Ying also returned, holding two red envelopes in her hand:

“Happy New Year, Little Mo. Take the red envelope. Bring Bing to play together more often in the future.”

“Thank you, Auntie.”

Li Mo tucked the red envelope away and took a serious look at Little Ice Cube. She stuffed the red envelope into her怀里 (bosom), the corners of her lips slightly raised, satisfied and happy.

“.....”

Well then.

Anyway, this is just a dream. Even if he really encounters a disaster beast in the dream, it doesn’t matter. Even if he dies in the dream, it would only make his soul weak for a while.

Why bother waking up?

At least in the dream, he could accompany Little Ice Cube to face the fears of childhood together. That was enough.

A while later.

The banquet was almost over. Under the summons of the clan elders, the Ying family members entered the ancestral hall.

The night seemed to have grown thicker.

In the center of the ancestral hall stood a large incense burner, into which were inserted incense sticks as thick as a child’s arm. They made the ancestral tablets enshrined behind them hazy amidst the curling smoke.

Not just the tablets, the Ying ancestors also had a gilded statue, which was the figure of a woman. The craftsmanship could be described as uncanny.

“This statue is so magnificent.”

“Of course. The statue of our ancestor was crafted by a famous divine artisan.”

Ying Xuliang raised his head, thinking that Little Li Mo had good taste.

“Divine artisan...”

Li Mo withdrew his gaze, thinking to himself that it was no wonder he vaguely sensed a scent of the power of all living beings from it, mixed with divine intent.

“Go offer some incense.”

Lady Ying brought two sticks of incense.

“Do I have to go too?”

“Go ahead. Since you’re already here.”

Little Bing had never paid respects to the ancestors before. Ying Father and Ying Mother mainly wanted to see if, with Little Li Mo leading the way, she would follow along as well?

Li Mo nodded and took the incense, looking at Little Ice Cube:

“Shall we go?”

“.....”

Little Ying Bing, however, seemed not to hear, her gaze fixed on the deep night outside the ancestral hall.

That’s right.

Li Mo suddenly realized, when had it become so quiet outside? Not a single sound?

Following Little Ice Cube’s gaze, Li Mo’s pupils contracted.

It was a pitch-black strange beast, four legs standing on the ground, a black horn on its head, eyes like crimson lanterns. It looked somewhat like the legendary Qilin, but it had no auspicious aura at all. It was ugly and ferocious.

Its huge, lantern-like eyes stared straight at the two little ones.

Or rather, it was looking at Little Ying Bing.

“Hehehe... You’ve finally returned.”
