# Chapter 49: That Old Man's Half-Buried Already—What's He Doing Here?!

"You—" Li Huayuan was stunned. "Why is this guy always so confident?!"

"Don't worry. Though they claim they'll unite, it's easier said than done." Lin Yun crossed his arms behind his head, completely unfazed by the so-called alliance of the six sects. 

"The Bloody Forbidden Land is vast, and everyone's entry point is randomized. Finding me won't be that easy."

"Once they see the blooming Purple Monkey Flowers, the elegant Jade Marrow Mushrooms, and the crystalline Heavenly Spirit Fruits, who would still remember their alliance?"

"If they all abandon the spirit herbs, who will give them Foundation Establishment Pills?"

"Naturally, they'll start fighting over the resources."

"Thus, the so-called alliance of the six sects will collapse on its own."

Such a plan was clearly unreliable—it could only intimidate ordinary people. 

While unity sounded appealing in theory, execution was fraught with difficulties. In fact, it was nearly impossible. 

The elite disciples of the seven sects were all proud and arrogant. Getting them to cooperate was no simple task. 

Locating Lin Yun alone posed a significant challenge. 

Of course, some disciples would undoubtedly come for him, as their sects must have offered substantial rewards for his elimination. 

But those few weren't worth worrying about. As long as their numbers didn't exceed a hundred, they were merely delivering storage pouches to him.

After hearing Lin Yun's reasoning, Li Huayuan nodded, visibly relieved.

Once the seven sects finalized their discussions, they led their disciples toward the border with Yuanwu Country. 

After flying for several hours, they descended onto a vast, desolate loess slope. The area was barren, devoid of even a single blade of grass, with only scattered rocks dotting the yellow expanse.

"Is this really the place?" 

Han Li, like the others, was surprised. It hardly seemed like a place where natural treasures could thrive.

Lin Yun, meanwhile, sat calmly on a rock, observing the scene ahead.

The Golden Core elder from the Giant Sword Sect stepped forward and demonstrated an intermediate-level spell—"Turning Earth to Stone"—condensing several stone swords and slashing them forward.

What followed was astonishing. 

The stone swords flew only a few dozen steps before triggering something unseen. They trembled violently and crumbled into dust. 

Then, a vast expanse of cyan light erupted in the void, flooding the area and tinting everyone's skin with a bluish hue.

As the disciples shuddered in fear, the cyan light roiled violently without warning, transforming into countless wind blades that howled and slashed wildly, forming an impenetrable wall of wind. 

Looking along the wall in either direction, it stretched endlessly into the distance, its full extent unknown. The air was filled with the eerie wails of the wind.

Even Xiang Zhili, hidden among the Yellow Maple Valley disciples, couldn't hide his astonishment.

"An ancient wind-attribute restriction... It seems the ancient cultivator who once resided in the Bloody Forbidden Land was a Wind-attribute Nascent Soul cultivator," Lin Yun murmured. But then he shook his head. "Though not necessarily. The attribute of a restriction doesn't always reflect the cultivator's techniques or spiritual roots."

"Restrictions are like formations. As long as you have the right materials, you can create wind-attribute or thunder-attribute ones."

"So, hastily concluding that this ancient cultivator was a Wind-attribute user is incorrect."

Lin Yun then turned his gaze toward the Giant Sword Sect's contingent. Among them was a barefooted, burly man carrying a massive silver sword on his back.

"That guy has the silver page I need—something I can use to extract rewards from Han Li."

Just as the six sects couldn't possibly unite fully against him, Lin Yun couldn't possibly hunt down and kill every last one of their disciples. 

If he wiped them all out and emerged as the sole survivor, the blame would be obvious. 

It was a move that would earn him immense hatred with little gain—something Lin Yun had no interest in.

As for top-tier magical artifacts? He already had thousands of them—more than he could ever use. 

Wasting time on such trivial pursuits wasn't worth it. He still had to find Nangong Wan.

Simply put—he was rich. Petty loot didn't interest him.

Once inside, it would all come down to luck. Whoever crossed his path would regret it.

While he couldn't annihilate all six sects, the Moon Mask Sect was a different story. 

After all, they had provoked him first. He was merely retaliating in self-defense.

And with the backing of the Yellow Maple Valley, the Moon Mask Sect would have no choice but to swallow their grievances.

As Lin Yun pondered, the Golden Core cultivators of the seven sacts began dismantling the ancient restriction.

Li Huayuan raised his hand, summoning a ruler-like artifact that emitted a silver glow before shooting forward.

Floating Cloud spat out a streak of cyan light from his mouth, which expanded into a flying sword several feet long.

The other five elders also unleashed their own dazzling artifacts: a pink silk ribbon, a dragon-headed staff, a massive black sword, a crimson longsword, and a yellow-glowing seal.

The seven artifacts formed a circular formation and charged toward the wind blade barrier.

A thunderous explosion erupted as the seven treasures clashed with the wind blades. Multicolored lights scattered in all directions, accompanied by eerie howls that left the watching disciples tense.

The sheer power of the battle sent a surge of excitement through Han Li. "This is the terrifying might of magic treasures! One day, I, Han Li, will possess my own!"

Li Huayuan's ruler spun rapidly, its silver glow fluctuating as it shattered countless wind blades.

The cyan flying sword transformed into a dragon dozens of feet long, each slash accompanied by a soul-shaking screech.

The other five treasures also displayed their unique abilities. The most impressive was the yellow seal wielded by the Heavenly Fortress Sect's elder. 

With each strike, it swelled to the size of a small mountain, accompanied by thunderous booms, before shrinking back to its original form. However, its movements were noticeably sluggish.

Observing the seal, Lin Yun analyzed its strengths and weaknesses: 

"Seal-type treasures are known for their overwhelming power, but their slow speed and the need to accumulate spiritual energy before attacking are clear drawbacks."

"When I reach the Golden Core stage, I'll choose the Profound Heaven Five Spirit Seal instead," he mused.

The Profound Heaven Five Spirit Seal retained all the advantages of seal-type treasures while eliminating their flaws. 

Given Lin Yun's ability to cultivate his dharma body to perfection, he would never lack spiritual energy.

Moreover, the seal could unleash rapid five-colored spirit light, compensating for its slow movement speed and making it nearly impossible to evade.

After three or four hours of intense battle, the seven elders were drenched in sweat, but their treasures finally gained the upper hand. 

They forced open a ten-foot-high circular passage through the wind barrier, its interior pitch-black and unfathomable.

"Hurry inside! We can't hold this for long!" Floating Cloud shouted, his energy nearly depleted.

The disciples wasted no time, filing into the passage in groups.

Han Li glanced back at Lin Yun, who flicked a Soul Fusion Talisman toward him. 

This talisman had been modified—beyond its standard effects, it allowed mutual location tracking within a certain range and could serve as a distress signal. 

Once activated, it would fly toward its paired talisman.

"Be careful inside. Because of me, the six sects are hostile. They may unite against you."

Han Li nodded and stepped through the passage.

Once everyone had entered, Lin Yun stood and stretched. "My turn."

"Stay alive, kid," Li Huayuan's voice echoed in his mind as he approached the entrance. 

Lin Yun smirked and stepped inside, vanishing into the darkness.

Inside the Bloody Forbidden Land, a Yellow Maple Valley disciple had the misfortune of spawning near several hostile sect members.

"Yellow Maple Valley is really scraping the bottom of the barrel—sending in an old man at the 11th level of Qi Condensation!" A scar-faced burly man from the Saber Transformation Sect sneered at the trembling elder.

"That old man's half-buried already—what's he doing here?!"

"Old man! We heard your sect's disciples are tough! Let's see what you've got!"

"We outnumber you and have higher cultivation. You're done for!"

"Get him!" The disciples lunged forward.

The elder didn't move. 

In the next instant, the Qi Condensation disciples collapsed, while he leisurely strolled toward the center of the Bloody Forbidden Land, hands clasped behind his back.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun found himself in a mist-shrouded valley.

He glanced at the Soul Fusion Talisman in his hand—no reaction. 

"Bad luck. A fifty-fifty chance, and we didn't spawn together."

"Hmm? Someone else?" 

Lin Yun turned toward a particular direction, stroking his chin.

"That aura..."

"Moon Mask Sect?"

"Not attacking?"

He waited briefly, but when no one approached, he shrugged. 

No point chasing after trash. He had more important matters.

Consulting his map, he murmured, "This should be Mist Valley. Han Li's probably still at Black Dragon Pond."

"Not too far. I'll find him first. With the Tracking Art and my talisman, it shouldn't be hard."

Lin Yun wasn't seeking Han Li out of sentimentality—he needed Han Li to locate the Moon Mask Sect's "Treasure Girl" and seize her map. 

Without it, locating the stone palace would be like finding a needle in a haystack.

Having a guide would simplify things immensely.

As a core disciple, the Treasure Girl would know the stone palace's location.

Elsewhere, the Moon Mask Sect's disciples—mostly male and female pairs—had spawned together, save for a few unlucky stragglers.

"Ancestor, aren't we attacking?" a disciple asked the fairy-like maiden beside him.

"Attack? Can you withstand his barrage of talismans?" Nangong Wan retorted.

"Uh..." The disciples fell silent.

"As a talisman master, he's at his strongest now—his talisman reserves are untouched. Don't waste our disciples' lives. Let the other five sects deplete his resources first," she instructed.

"Yes, Ancestor."

They proceeded according to their map, searching for spirit herbs.
