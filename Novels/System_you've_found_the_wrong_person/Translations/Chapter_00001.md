# Chapter 1: The System Came to the Wrong Person  

Jun County.  

As sunlight illuminated the city, life began to stir once more.  

With a creak, Dou Changsheng pushed open the door and stepped into the courtyard. His handsome face was clouded with gloom as he stared at the towering, muscular figure already awake and stretching in the yard. A shadow flickered in his eyes.  

Reality was truly absurd, ridiculous, and laughable.  

Since transmigrating into this world, Dou Changsheng had never once had it easy—always running into these violent thugs.  

He had merely been wandering through Jun County, wearing a bamboo hat with a sword hanging at his waist—a common enough attire for wandering martial artists. Yet, this nameless brute had mistaken him for an accomplice and eagerly invited him to stay in this residence.  

Damn it!  

There had to be at least twenty, if not a hundred, people dressed like this in Jun County. It was standard attire for martial artists, and Dou Changsheng had adopted it precisely to avoid trouble.  

The burly man finished his martial arts routine with a deep exhale, a visible puff of white qi lingering in the air. He turned to Dou Changsheng with a hearty laugh.  

"We didn’t get to talk much when we first met yesterday," he said. "But now that the Sword Demon of the Northern Frontier and I, the Ironclad Mad Lion, have gathered here, the government silver shipment heading beyond the Great Wall is as good as ours!"  

"The Demonic Master Lin Xuanqi has declared that anyone bold enough to rob the silver convoy will be accepted as his disciple."  

"For wandering cultivators like us, this is a golden opportunity!"  

"After this job, you’ll be the senior brother, I’ll be the junior brother—we’ll support each other and carve out our place in this world!"  

Dou Changsheng finally understood.  

This bastard was looking for a scapegoat—a fall guy.  

That was why he had dragged Dou Changsheng into this, fabricating an identity for him as the "Sword Demon." Once the deed was done, the imperial court would issue a bounty for the mastermind—him—while the brute would fade into the background, free to seek apprenticeship under the Demonic Master.  

And for a villain like the Demonic Master, such scheming wouldn’t be a flaw—it would be a selling point.  

Life was bitter.  

Unbelievably bitter.  

Other transmigrators had it easy, but him? Nothing but trouble, and it was only getting worse.  

Out of all the people dressed similarly, this brute had zeroed in on him. What kind of twisted luck was that?  

Dou Changsheng’s gaze darkened as murderous intent simmered in his heart. Seemingly sensing his thoughts, the burly man grinned, revealing yellowed teeth, and grabbed a broken blade from the ground.  

With a powerful grip, he twisted the steel weapon like a piece of rope, bending it into knots until cracks spiderwebbed across its surface. Then, with a loud crunch, he took a bite out of the metal as if it were a crispy snack.  

Dou Changsheng watched, stunned, as the man chewed and swallowed the broken blade.  

All his anger evaporated in an instant, replaced by icy dread.  

There was no way he could win a fight against this guy.  

His fingers instinctively tightened around the hilt of his own sword—cold, hard metal.  

But compared to this monster, his life was far more fragile.  

How the hell did someone this strong end up in a small place like Jun County?  

The brute finished his meal, licking his lips before spitting out metal shards like bullets. They embedded themselves into the wooden door with a sharp thud, cracking the surface like a spiderweb.  

A silent warning: that broken blade had been real steel.  

"The silver shipment arrives in Jun County tomorrow," the man said, tossing a bundle toward Dou Changsheng. "We’ve got one day to wait. Eat up, train hard—we move at dawn."  

With a dismissive gesture, he signaled for Dou Changsheng to return to his room.  

Expressionless, Dou Changsheng picked up the bundle and retreated inside, shutting the door behind him.  

He didn’t bother checking what was inside—whatever it was, he wasn’t stupid enough to eat it. Poison was the least of his worries.  

He had to escape.  

Tonight? No—better to make his move during the day.  

While darkness provided cover, this brute was too strong. If Dou Changsheng caused a scene in broad daylight, the man might hesitate to kill him in public, lest he draw unwanted attention before the heist.  

Going along with this plan meant certain doom.  

Trying to escape was risky, but actually robbing the silver convoy? That was a death sentence.  

Just as he sat down, a voice echoed in his mind.  

**[Ding!]**  

**[Congratulations, fortunate host! You have acquired the Blessed Life System!]**  

**[At eighteen, while traveling through Jun County, you encountered the Ironclad Mad Lion’s plot to rob the silver shipment. Drawing your sword in righteous defiance, though outmatched, you caught the attention of the Black Eagle Sovereign, who not only saved your life but also guided you onto the path of cultivation.]**  

**[At nineteen, during a ghoul massacre in Changzhou, you stood alone against the monsters. Though gravely wounded, you emerged victorious, slaying the ghoul and earning fame. The prestigious Wang Clan sought your hand in marriage for their eldest daughter.]**  

**[At twenty, you ranked among the Human Rankings, married into nobility, became a disciple of an Earth Ranking grandmaster, and entered a prestigious sect. Looking back, your cultivation journey has been smooth and prosperous. Congratulations on obtaining the Blessed Life System!]**  

**[Diligent Training: Though you are now twenty and renowned, never forget your roots. Train diligently for fifteen minutes—Reward: Thirty days’ worth of cultivation progress.]**  

Who the hell was this?  

Dou Changsheng immediately realized—this wasn’t him.  

Then it hit him.  

A parallel timeline.  

While the other Dou Changsheng had ten measures of luck, he was in the red by three.  

Was there no justice in this world?  

No wonder his life was so miserable—all the good fortune had gone to this other version of himself.  

And now, even a system?  

Unbelievable.  

They were both Dou Changsheng—why such blatant favoritism?  

Wait… no.  

Now the system was his.  

Ah, my apologies, dear parallel self. Clearly, you saw how hard my life was and generously handed over the system. It didn’t come to the wrong person at all.  

No—the system was describing *him*, wasn’t it?  

At twenty, ranking on the Human Rankings, marrying into nobility—none of that had happened yet.  

There was still hope.  

What "handing over the system"?  

Nonsense.  

This system was always meant for him.  

Dou Changsheng steeled himself to train hard—every bit of strength counted if he wanted to escape.  

Thirty days’ worth of cultivation wasn’t much, but even a mosquito’s meat was still meat.  

But before he could even begin, the task completed itself.  

After a brief pause, Dou Changsheng broke into a wide grin.  

*Brother suffers, I benefit. Thank you for your hard work, my parallel self.*  

This "thirty days’ worth of cultivation" wasn’t from his current self—it was from his future twenty-year-old self, already a ranked martial artist.  

No longer just a scrap—this was a full-course meal.  

A whole damn feast.
