## Chapter 55: Rabbit Meat

As Han Lisi approached, he slapped Li Zhiming on the back with a resounding thud, causing Li Zhiming to stumble. Han Lisi had been testing his recent mastery of "Internal Breath Palm" without making a sound.

"What's wrong?" Li Zhiming asked, rubbing his back.

"Nothing, just preparing to skin this rabbit for dinner," Li Zhiming replied, holding up a gray rabbit that was frantically kicking its legs and emitting high-pitched squeaks.

On the ground, a chubby, panda-like creature with a dog-like smile on its face and a long tail wagging furiously came rolling over. The creature, named Paopa, was a vegetarian and had a tendency to drool excessively.

"Scram!" Li Zhiming kicked Paopa away, "You're a vegetarian, eat your greens!"

"I'm making spicy rabbit head for dinner," Han Lisi said nonchalantly.

"And maybe spicy Paopa head tomorrow," Han Lisi added.

Paopa took off like a shot, nearly colliding with Jiang Yun, who was entering the kitchen. Jiang Yun let out a startled cry, intimidated by the large creature.

Li Zhiming, on the other hand, was pleased with himself. He had managed to copy a new skill, "Fast Knife King," making him one of the youngest masters of this skill in Qixuanmen. He pondered the conditions required to copy a命格 (life pattern) and realized that it required an extremely high level of trust.

The more he thought about it, the more Li Zhiming suspected that the reason he couldn't copy Han Lisi's命格, "Great Late Bloomer," was due to Han Lisi's命格, "Cautious Nature," which made him extremely cautious.

As Li Zhiming entered the kitchen, he couldn't shake off his thoughts about Tong Hua Zhi, who had easily handed over his命格. Li Zhiming wondered if there was more to it than met the eye.

Li Zhiming began to prepare the rabbit for cooking, and suddenly, an epiphany struck him. He realized that as a divine physician, people naturally trusted him, especially since he had saved them from the jaws of death. This trust was the key to copying their命格.

The thought sent a shiver down Li Zhiming's spine. With this kind of power, he could potentially master all the martial arts in Qixuanmen in a few years.

"Enough daydreaming, focus on the task at hand," Li Zhiming chided himself, shaking his head. He began to efficiently clean and prepare the rabbit for cooking.

Just then, a burly figure with a childlike face, Da Niu, arrived at the kitchen. "Little Four, I'm here!" he boomed.

Li Zhiming ladled out a large bowl of rice and a generous serving of rabbit meat for Da Niu, who dug in with gusto. However, Li Zhiming soon regretted it, as Da Niu devoured most of the meat, leaving him with only a few pieces.

"Hey, you're eating too much! That's not fair!" Li Zhiming complained, but Da Niu just grinned, his face buried in the food.

As they ate, Da Niu caught sight of the spicy rabbit head on the table and his eyes lit up. "Is that mine?" he asked, drooling.

Li Zhiming swatted his hand away, "Not a chance!"
