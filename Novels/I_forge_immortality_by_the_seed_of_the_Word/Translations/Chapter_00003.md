# Chapter 3: Azure Sky Spirit Crane

Flecks of cyan light flickered into view, swiftly filling the entire field of vision.

An indescribably terrifying aura poured down from midair.

Zhang Jing found himself involuntarily lowering his head, a sudden urge to prostrate himself surging through him. An intense feeling of suffocation made him instinctively gasp for air, his heart pounding like a drum.

Every hair on his body stood on end.

This sensation was akin to a lower lifeform facing a superior one—utterly soul-shaking!

"Is that... an immortal crane?"

In that fleeting glance, Zhang Jing vaguely discerned the massive silhouette of a crane behind the cyan glow.

With great effort, he turned his head.

He saw the others similarly keeping their heads bowed low, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

Except for Ji Bochang!

This fellow had his head lowered, yet his expression remained remarkably composed. Noticing Zhang Jing's gaze, Ji Bochang even blinked his small eyes and fanned himself twice with his paper fan in an ostentatious manner.

Zhang Jing's look toward him instantly turned peculiar.

Fanning oneself in cold weather could be excused as youthful bravado. But why was this guy winking at another man? Didn't he realize how...

Zhang Jing subtly took a small step back.

Just then.

"Are you Liu Shidi of Yong'an Academy down there?" A clear, warm voice suddenly rang out from above.

"This humble one is Liu Sanyi, respectfully welcoming Senior Brother," Instructor Liu replied deferentially.

"Haha, are these youngsters the ones you've selected this year? Not bad—your Yong'an Academy has produced quite a promising seedling."

"You flatter me, Senior Brother."

As they spoke, an enormous shadow, dark as storm clouds, gradually descended.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but look up.

What met his eyes were crane legs as thick and smooth as white jade pillars.

His gaze traveled upward.

Snow-white feathers, each as large as small trees, shimmered with a profound cyan spiritual light, radiating an aura of sacred majesty.

Standing so close, even when Zhang Jing craned his neck back as far as possible, he couldn't take in the entire crane. It felt as though a mountain of feathers dozens of zhang tall had abruptly materialized before him, exuding overwhelming pressure.

"This crane... is unreasonably large..." Zhang Jing muttered in awe.

The warm voice spoke again.

"Liu Shidi, since everyone is gathered here, I'll take them directly back to the Dao Academy."

"Many thanks for your escort, Senior Brother."

"Merely fulfilling my duty—no need for thanks."

The moment these words fell, Zhang Jing felt a gentle force lift him effortlessly into the air.

Alongside him, Ji Bochang and over a dozen other academy students rose simultaneously.

The scenery below rapidly shrank.

---

Zhang Jing could even see pedestrians on the streets outside, yet they seemed oblivious to the colossal crane beside him, merely hurrying along with heads down.

Before long.

Zhang Jing and the dozen others stood upon the crane's broad back.

The roar of rushing wind filled their ears.

Not far behind them.

An ancient wooden hut stood out conspicuously.

While directly ahead sat a young man who appeared no older than twenty.

Clad in a cyan robe with a mutton-fat white jade crown, his complexion was smooth and his eyes lightly closed as if lost in celestial contemplation.

"Greetings, Immortal Master."

Zhang Jing and the others bowed in unison.

"Hmm." The man opened his eyes, his expression impassive. "Since you've been chosen by Liu Shidi, you must give your all in the Dragon Lake Dao Academy's assessment. Do not disappoint him."

"We thank the Immortal Master for your guidance!"

Zhang Jing and the others chorused.

"If there's nothing else, you may enter the hut or move freely on Qingxiao Spirit Crane's back. Refrain from loud noises."

"We shall heed your instruction, Immortal Master."

At this, the man gave a slight nod and closed his eyes again.

Zhang Jing and the others lifted their feet cautiously, retreating slowly to avoid disturbing the immortal master before them.

Yet in the next instant, the "ground" suddenly trembled violently, sending the group tumbling. Zhang Jing quickly flattened himself against the surface to steady his body.

Turning his head.

He saw the spirit crane below suddenly spread its wings. With a single powerful flap, it soared skyward, piercing straight into the clouds.

In moments.

Thick mist enveloped their surroundings.

"Qingxiao Spirit Crane—what a fitting name," Zhang Jing remarked in admiration.

He noticed that during flight, a faint cyan spiritual light enveloped the crane's body.

It was undoubtedly this luminous barrier that allowed them to remain as stable as if on solid ground, shielded from the biting winds.

After a dozen breaths, the surface beneath them stabilized.

"Brother Zhang, why the daze? Many have gathered in the hut—let's join them."

Ji Bochang nudged Zhang Jing's arm, whispering.

"Many people?" Zhang Jing looked surprised.

"Surely candidates from the other six prefectures of Huizhou. Due to our location, the immortal master always comes to Linshan Prefecture last."

"I see." Enlightenment dawned on Zhang Jing as he followed the others.

Creak—

The door swung open.

"Ji Bochang of Yong'an's Ji Clan?" someone inside called out sharply.

In that instant.

Zhang Jing saw dozens of eyes in the room light up, sweeping over their group with looks ranging from reverence to sycophancy.

He instinctively stepped back.

---

Immediately, the gazes shifted away from Zhang Jing without hesitation.

Seizing the opportunity, he surveyed the hut's interior.

Though small, it packed sixty to seventy people who either sat or stood crowded in the corners.

At the center sat two young men and a woman, their noble bearing setting them apart.

A conspicuously empty space surrounded the trio.

None dared approach.

"These must be scions of prominent clans," Zhang Jing silently concluded.

Before him.

Ji Bochang snapped his fan shut and laughed heartily. "You must be Brother Deng, Brother Wu, and Fairy Chu. My elders often speak of you three—I'm truly humbled."

"Cousin jestes. Before my departure, Father repeatedly instructed me to learn from you."

Among the three, the young woman rose gracefully, her radiant smile blooming.

Despite her youth, she already possessed beauty capable of toppling cities. Her flawless, makeup-free features were exquisitely carved as if by divinity, especially her eyes—bright as spring waters, their every glance brimming with irresistible charm.

Her light green liuxian gown not only failed to conceal her alluring figure but accentuated it with deadly allure.

Drawing countless admiring looks.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept past her without lingering.

Having lived two lives, he knew all too well that such breathtaking beauty often spelled trouble—especially at their current age.

Meanwhile.

"Indeed, Brother Ji is too modest. Please, join us," the other two youths eagerly invited.

"Haha, then I'll not stand on ceremony." Ji Bochang nodded before turning to whisper to Zhang Jing, "Brother Zhang, these three are the elite talents of Heishan's Deng Clan, Yangshui's Wu Clan, and Zhouyang's Chu Clan. Will you join us?"

"Please proceed without me, Brother Ji," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"Very well. I'll go sound them out first."

With that, Ji Bochang strode toward the hut's center.

Scanning his surroundings.

Under the curious stares of others, Zhang Jing found a relatively quiet corner with fewer people and leaned against the wall to sit down, closing his eyes to rest.

Awaiting their arrival at Dragon Lake Dao Academy.
