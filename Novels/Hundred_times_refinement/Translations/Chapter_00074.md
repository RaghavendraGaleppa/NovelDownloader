# Chapter 24: Analyzing Pros and Cons

After thoroughly analyzing the situation, the next step was naturally to find a solution. He attempted to increase the speed of the light points' movement, which would generate stronger energy to push the impurities out.

The difficulty lay in determining the right amount of energy to add. Too little would be ineffective, while too much would exceed the pill's tolerance, causing it to explode and become useless.

Lin Xuan carefully increased the energy bit by bit. The light points around the impurities grew denser until, finally, the impurities began to move again. His movements became even more cautious as he meticulously guided the impurities out...

About an hour later.

"Whew!"

Lin Xuan lay on the bed, exhausted. His clothes were drenched in sweat—the purification process was more taxing than a full day of meditation. 

Yet, a faint smile touched his lips. He raised his right hand and opened his palm to reveal a small pill emitting an intoxicating fragrance.

A mid-grade Body Refining Pill!

Though he had never seen one before, the descriptions in the pill annotations matched perfectly—its pale blue surface and rich medicinal aroma far surpassed that of a low-grade pill. 

In the cultivation world, pill refinement was an exceptionally intricate art. Even low-grade pills had a success rate of only 50-60%, while mid-grade pills were even rarer, with less than a 20% success rate. In other words, refining a mid-grade pill often required five batches of materials, with four ending in failure. Moreover, this was only achievable by highly skilled and experienced alchemists. Such extravagance was something only major sects could afford—small sects like the Drifting Cloud Valley lacked the resources to refine mid-grade pills.

Theoretically, one mid-grade pill could be exchanged for ten low-grade pills of the same type. But in reality, mid-grade pills were practically priceless. While low-grade Body Refining Pills were rare, most sects still had a few in stock. Mid-grade pills, however, were exclusive to a handful of major sects and were reserved for their most talented disciples during critical breakthroughs.

This alone demonstrated the immense value of mid-grade pills!

After examining the pill and recalling all he knew about mid-grade pills, Lin Xuan decided to test its effects firsthand.

He rose from the bed, sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, and placed the pale-blue pill in his mouth. It dissolved instantly.

Closing his eyes, he focused his spiritual sense on his dantian and began refining the pill's energy. Soon, a vast wave of warmth spread through his dantian.

Unlike the scorching heat produced by consuming multiple low-grade Body Refining Pills—which felt like being trapped in a furnace—this warmth was gentle and soothing, akin to soaking in a hot spring.

With fewer impurities than low-grade pills, the medicinal energy was purer and more potent.

Though the *Pill Annotations* had briefly mentioned this, experiencing it firsthand was entirely different. Lin Xuan felt a surge of joy but kept his mind steady, channeling all his focus into refining the energy.

He gathered the spiritual energy in his dantian. Compared to when he was at the first layer of the Spirit Movement Stage, both the quantity and quality of his spiritual energy had undergone a dramatic transformation.

What was once as thin as a strand of hair had now thickened to the size of a matchstick, and its color had deepened from a faint, almost transparent white with a hint of blue to a rich, solid azure.

He quickly formed the energy into a stream and guided it through his meridians, merging it with the mid-grade pill's medicinal power.

This process was crucial—it involved using the refined pill's energy to nourish his spiritual energy, much like roots absorbing nutrients to grow stronger. Lin Xuan then directed the energy through nine full cycles of the Great Celestial Circuit.

...

By the time he finished and stood up, it was already noon. Refining the mid-grade pill's energy had taken far longer than when he had consumed three low-grade Body Refining Pills at once, but the results were also significantly more pronounced.

A quick check with his spiritual sense confirmed that his spiritual energy had grown noticeably—a stark contrast to the diminishing effects of low-grade pills after reaching the fourth layer of cultivation.

In other words, mid-grade Body Refining Pills could indeed meet his current cultivation needs.

Through personal experimentation, Lin Xuan had reached this conclusion. However, another challenge remained: mid-grade pills were incredibly difficult to refine.

Over the past six months, Lin Xuan had gained considerable experience in manipulating the blue light points and had mastered the purification of low-grade pills. But mid-grade pills...

Truthfully, the one he had just consumed was the result of a lucky success. Attempting it again, he wasn't confident he could replicate it—not because it was impossible, but because the process was time-consuming, exhausting, and prone to failure.

For instance, Lin Xuan could now purify an entire bottle of defective pills in a single day and night, with a success rate exceeding one-third. Without rest, his Star Sea could sustain the purification of six to seven low-grade pills consecutively.

But for mid-grade pills? Even at full capacity, his Star Sea could barely support the purification of one pill, and failure was highly likely.

In other words, while he *could* produce mid-grade pills, the efficiency was abysmal—so much so that his cultivation progress would inevitably slow down.

What to do?

Lying on the bed, Lin Xuan pondered. After a moment of silence, he clapped his hands and made a decision: he would continue refining mid-grade pills.

The reason was simple. Relying on low-grade pills for cultivation had already reached its limits—breaking through bottlenecks would take who knew how long. 

Though refining mid-grade pills would require more time initially, he needed to think long-term. As the saying went, practice makes perfect. When he first started purifying low-grade pills, his success rate had been abysmal, and progress had been painstakingly slow. But eventually, he had mastered it effortlessly.

He couldn't let the difficulty of refining mid-grade pills discourage him. The path of cultivation was fraught with challenges—what was this compared to the trials ahead?

He simply had to find a way to overcome it.

With persistent practice, his efficiency in refining mid-grade pills would improve. And with their miraculous effects, his cultivation speed would soar once more.

From a long-term perspective, investing time now to master mid-grade pill purification was undoubtedly worthwhile.

Having carefully weighed the pros and cons, Lin Xuan had a clear plan for his future cultivation. All that remained was to press forward with unwavering determination.
