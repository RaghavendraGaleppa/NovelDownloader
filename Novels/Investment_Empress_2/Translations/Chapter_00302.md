# Chapter 302: The Peerless Warrior and the Divine General, The Noise and The Nursery Rhyme

Li Mo: "!"

He watched as the young girl raised the skewer to his lips, her eyes lowered as she looked at him quietly, like the moon tinged with the color of earthly fires.

Possibly, just possibly.

Could it be that当年大郎 (that big boy from back then) knew there was poison but still swallowed it in one go? After all, this ice lump is definitely more犯规 (犯规 - against the rules/overpowered) than the fictional Jin Lian'er.

"Um..."

Under such overwhelming pressure, he didn't have time to dwell on her calling him "stinky little brother" or "Little Li." He opened his mouth and took a bite.

Ying Bing thought for a moment, her cherry lips parting slightly:

"Good boy."

"....."

Li Mo shrank his neck. Was this mutton from a happy sheep? Otherwise, why was he eating it with his scalp tingling and shivering, yet the corners of his mouth were harder to suppress than a hammer treasure?

Zhong Ling: "!"

She currently felt the strong liquor in her mouth tasted sweet.

This... this, this!

Was this Young Hero Li secretly giving the Cold Immortal a lesson, demonstrating a textbook example in person?

Young Hero Li was such a reliable person. Not only was his strength formidable, but he was also so kind. Thinking back to her own actions when they first met during the day, she felt like giving herself two slaps.

Later, she definitely had to toast him a couple of drinks. For now...

"Stinky little brother, eat." Zhong Ling imitated what she saw, holding up a lamb leg.

"......"

Zhong Zhenyue hesitated for three and a third of a second before choosing to use the lamb leg to block his stomach full of question marks.

Thus, a bizarre scene appeared.

The ice lump treated Zhong Ling as a reference object. Seeing her feed Zhong Zhenyue, she followed suit and fed Little Li.

Zhong Ling treated the ice lump as a textbook demonstration. Seeing her feed Li Mo, she immediately applied what she learned to Zhong Zhenyue, though she didn't do it well—it was like a buyer's show being dimensionally crushed by the seller's show.

Each was learning from the other, creating a dead loop.

It was very confusing.

The entire tavern was lively, but their table was the center of attention.

A child at the next table asked curiously, "Mom, what are they doing?"

He was immediately covered in the eyes by his mother.

"Wait a moment!"

Zhong Zhenyue covered his stomach and raised his hand.

"Hm?" Zhong Ling looked at him with displeasure.

"Brother Li, these ingredients... I can't digest them all at once. I really can't eat anymore."

Zhong Zhenyue grimaced and loosened his belt slightly. His round belly immediately pushed his inner shirt up.

When Ying Bing fed Li Mo, she fed him a piece, then ate a piece herself.

Zhong Ling almost shoved the entire lamb leg down Zhong Zhenyue's throat.

"Sister, you eat too. The taste is really good."

"Oh, you're sensible now."

Zhong Ling happily took a bite of the food Zhong Zhenyue handed over and secretly gave Li Mo a thumbs up.

As expected of her "Prosperous Wife Fighting Spirit." The method he gave was brilliant. Zhenyue had never fed her before.

"....."

Little Li Mentor supported his forehead, blocking the black lines on it.

If you said the love operation failed, Zhong Ling did get to eat.

But if you said it succeeded... it still felt like something was off.

He夹着菜 (picked up some food) and took a bite, chewing on the chopstick head while pondering what was wrong, when he met the gaze of a certain Cold Immortal.

She looked at the dishes on the table, then at Li Mo's chopsticks. Her eyes practically wrote:

*Are you really just going to eat by yourself?*

"Right, eat."

Li Mo picked up a chopstick of shredded potato and green pepper, bringing it to her lips.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, turning her face slightly to the side, her lips pressed together and refusing to open.

Refusal.

"???"

A small question mark appeared over Li Mo's head. Didn't she really like shredded potato and green pepper?

Fortunately, he was a genius.

This time, his genius wasn't misplaced. In that instant, inspiration struck, and he keenly caught that tiny detail.

He blurted out:

"Sister, eat?"

---

"En."

Ying Bing's frown smoothed out. Only then did she open her mouth, like a cold cat seeing a familiar person.

"...."

So that was it?

Li Mo had just been struck by sudden inspiration. After all, Zhong Zhenyue had called Zhong Ling "Sister" since he was a child, but the ice lump was only two months older than him...

There were many military men in this shop. As they ate and drank, acquaintances naturally chatted with each other.

"This is the famous Prosperous... uh, Lone Wolf Strange Sword!"

"The one next to him is the Cold Immortal."

Zhong Zhenyue introduced the soldiers, and the atmosphere grew even hotter. After all, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were vast, with countless heroes, yet there were only a hundred prodigies known as "Hidden Dragons." And right here at this small table sat three of them.

Two of them were even among the top ranks, the legendary dragons and phoenixes among men that people loved to talk about.

"Young Hero Li, if you don't mind, let me have a drink with you."

"Earlier, when I was watching, I felt this one wasn't an ordinary person."

"Young Hero Li, are you married... *gasp*, this liquor is strange, I'm drunk after just two cups."

The soldiers initially only gave the Young Master face, but later they discovered this "Prosperous Wife Fighting Spirit" had no airs and was quite approachable, so the atmosphere in the room became much more lively.

Zhong Zhenyue was a bit surprised, but thinking about it, it seemed normal. Brother Li seemed to get along well with anyone, as long as they weren't evil or vicious people.

He also smiled and said:

"Brother Li will come to the military camp tomorrow to cooperate with our collective training. You guys better be spirited then, don't lose face for our border troops."

"How will the training be conducted? Young Hero Li doesn't seem to have served in the military." The tavern owner, the one-armed man, asked curiously.

"You'll find out tomorrow."

Zhong Zhenyue took a sip of wine and smiled:

"Our commander praised him, saying that if Brother Li joined the military, he would surely be a Divine General who would be the bravest in the three armies. Even Uncle Qu has never praised me like that."

The soldiers looked at each other, a sense of gravity growing in their hearts.

Their Commander Qu never spoke nonsense. He was always thoughtful and deliberate, his words carrying absolute weight. What he said usually had a hundred percent certainty.

"May I ask... Little Li Brother, how much military force can you bear? Is it more than the Young Master?" The one-armed man asked tentatively.

"Bear military force?"

Li Mo looked at Zhong Zhenyue.

Zhong Zhenyue explained: "When a hundred soldiers form a military formation, it's called one 'Fang'. The power of the military formation is usually manifested through the 'Formation Eye'. The stronger one's physique and soul, the more military formation power they can bear."

"Right now, with Sister Ling's coordination, I can bear at most four Fang and a bit."

This happened to be the number of personal guards he brought to Nanguan City.

Li Mo roughly understood.

The power of a military formation is incredibly turbulent and vast; it is not something an ordinary person can control. To channel the power of so many people into a single person, that person's quality is especially important.

Those who can bear ten Fang are already great generals and can serve as vanguards.

Those who can bear a hundred Fang are called "Peerless Warriors" (Ten Thousand Enemy Heroes), capable of roaming the battlefield freely.

As for the current Divine Generals... the Great Yu Dynasty had them.

The King of the South.

Of course, besides the "Formation Eye," it also depends on the elite level of the soldiers and the command quality of the military formation commander.

"If I were to study military formations, how much military force could I bear..."

"Brother Li can try it tomorrow."

....

A group of rough men chatted with great interest, their coarse voices rumbling, shaking the ceiling of the tavern.

"He should be able to sleep well tonight?"

Ying Bing looked at the不远处 (not far away), where the youth was like a fish in water among a group of soldiers, and couldn't help but think this.

A martial artist at the Divine Observation Realm could replace sleep with meditation.

But unless the situation was urgent, they would still sleep a little every day to relax their spirit.

But Li Mo hadn't had a good sleep in a long time.

At this moment.

The child at the next table was sleepy, rubbing his eyes, but couldn't sleep because of the noise.

His mother, a local woman from the southern frontier, gently patted his back and sang softly:

"The sky is dark, dark, about to rain."

"The sky is dark, dark, dark..."

The local dialect nursery rhyme gave the noise a distinct yet harmonious tranquility, allowing the child to fall into a deep sleep amidst the comfort.

The young girl's eyes were soft and serene in the night of fire and smoke.

She didn't deliberately try to remember it.

But the nursery rhyme remained in her heart...
