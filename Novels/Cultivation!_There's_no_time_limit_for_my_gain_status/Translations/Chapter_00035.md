# Chapter 35: The Monk

The group gathered around the child, watching as he squirmed, rolled around, and eventually began crying in his sleep—yet his eyes remained stubbornly shut, trapped in an unbreakable slumber.

"As expected, it didn't work," someone sighed.

No one was discouraged, as this outcome had been anticipated. If mere pain could wake these children, the task wouldn't have fallen to them in the first place. Human ingenuity knew no bounds, and the torture methods employed by various nations' prisons were far from ineffective.

Lu Qianqian showed a glimmer of interest. With a light flick of her hand, three bloodstained silver needles returned to her grasp.

"Well?" the others pressed.

Their confidence in taking on this investigation largely stemmed from Lu Qianqian. She was a skilled healer, versed in the medical arts of the cultivation world.

"It's not poison, but... there's something odd about the scent of his blood," she murmured.

Kneeling again, she summoned two clear water orbs in her palms and pressed them against the boy's body, conducting a more thorough examination.

"Did Lu Qianqian have prior training before joining the sect?" Jiang Li asked.

Although the Scripture Valley's teaching hall covered some medical knowledge, it was only superficial—far from sufficient to explain her level of expertise.

"Indeed," Yu Banxia replied. "Her family possesses a medical cultivation legacy. While not particularly combat-oriented, their methods for healing and treating illnesses are unparalleled. They're renowned in the mortal world—it's said no ailment exists that the Lu family can't cure."

Jiang Li nodded. Seeing that Lu Qianqian was still deep in examination, he began circling the other children, occasionally casting Appraisal spells on them.

**[Name: Zhao Asan | Gender: Male | Occupation: None | Level: None | Threat Level: None]**  
**[Name: Zhang Aniu | Gender: Male | Occupation: None | Level: None | Threat Level: None]**  
**[Name: Zhang Xiaohua | Gender: Female | Occupation: None | Level: None | Threat Level: None]**  

Unfortunately, his Appraisal skill was still too low-level to yield useful information. Still, after making the rounds, he noted one commonality: all the children were between eight and fourteen years old—none older, none younger. What else connected them?

When he returned, Lu Qianqian was still frowning over her examination. The others, whose skills leaned toward offensive techniques, were of little help in healing. They had been assigned to question local residents of Yinnan Kingdom, gathering every possible detail. Logically, an incident of this scale should have an obvious common denominator. What had caused their condition?

"Banxia, I have a technique I'd like to try," Jiang Li said politely.

"Go ahead. Just don't kill anyone," Yu Banxia replied, watching as sweat beaded on Lu Qianqian's forehead. At this point, any opportunity was worth exploring.

Jiang Li flipped a boy—who looked slightly older than himself—onto his back, positioning his head face-up. With a series of hand seals and murmured incantations, a green light flickered at his fingertips before drifting into the boy's skull.

**Parasitic Puppetry Art!**

This technique could manipulate even broken corpses, let alone a living, intact person. While cultivators might resist with their spiritual energy and willpower, a mere mortal stood no chance.

"Stand up!" Jiang Li commanded, his finger pointed at the boy. The green light seeped deeper into the boy's skull, and his body jerked stiffly, rising inch by inch like a marionette.

"He's up! It worked!"  
"Immortal! Truly the work of an immortal!"  

The local officials erupted in excitement, some nearly prostrating themselves in reverence. But just then, the boy's face twisted into a grotesque mask of agony.

"Wake up!"  

Jiang Li's will forced the boy's eyelids open. To his surprise, the boy resisted. His body convulsed unnaturally, one eyelid wrenching open to reveal a bloodshot white, while the other fluttered weakly.

"He's actually resisting?!" Jiang Li was stunned. This was his first attempt at controlling a mortal, and it had failed?  

He could distinctly sense another tenacious will within the boy's body, fighting for control.  

Jiang Li: (ﾟ⊿ﾟ)ﾂ  

Was this boy some once-in-a-millennium prodigy? Could a mortal's will truly resist a mid-stage Qi Refining spell?  

This was absurd.  

Before Jiang Li could process his shock, a thunderous roar erupted behind him.  

"Fiend! How dare you commit such atrocities!"  

The Buddhist shout struck like lightning. A gust of malice surged toward Jiang Li, every hair on his back standing on end.  

An ambush!  

Instinctively, he channeled spiritual energy, his back darkening as his skin hardened to stone-like resilience.  

But in the next moment, a yellow-robed figure blurred past him, kicking up dust as it charged straight for the boy Jiang Li had been controlling.  

"Ha!"  

A fist the size of a sand pot slammed into the boy's frail chest. The sickening crunch of shattering bones echoed as the "prodigious" youth was sent flying like a ragdoll, crashing heavily to the ground.  

"Humph! I knew at a glance you were no human!" the monk declared triumphantly.  

Jiang Li & Co.: ??  

Yinnan officials: ???  

"Uh... Senior Brother, who are you?" Jiang Li ventured, breaking the silence.  

The monk had appeared out of nowhere, slipping past Yu Banxia and the others before anyone could react. His speed surpassed even Jiang Li's unimpaired movement, and that punch had been devastatingly powerful—clearly, this was no ordinary opponent.  

Yet he hadn't attacked Jiang Li, instead targeting a helpless mortal. What was his goal?  

"Ah, no need for formalities, Junior Brother. Fellow cultivators should aid one another in their travels. When I saw evil at work, how could I not intervene?"  

The monk turned, his face breaking into a hearty grin. "This humble monk is Zheng Yuan of the Cihang Temple. And you are...?"  

Jiang Li was momentarily disarmed by the monk's confidence. Had he misjudged? Was that boy truly a hidden monster in disguise?
