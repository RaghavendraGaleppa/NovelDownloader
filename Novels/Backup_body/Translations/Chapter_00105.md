# Chapter 105: Immortal Zhengjing, Break the Formation!

In an instant, the entire grotto-heaven fell into silence.

This Crown Prince knew when to advance and when to retreat. After Li Zhengjing gained the upper hand, instead of fighting to the death in a fit of rage, he suppressed his hatred and took a step back.

The alchemy formation was rooted in the twenty-four Dragon Pillars of the Grand Hall, manipulated by the power of five divine beings. The great medicine being refined within was none other than five Human Immortals and thousands of cultivators!

Once the refinement was complete, it would produce a divine elixir of unprecedented power!

Who could refuse such an elixir?

"Little friend Zhengjing..."

Yuan Zhengfeng finally spoke, his tone grave.

He wanted to dissuade Li Zhengjing, believing this act to be the work of demonic practitioners! Yet he also knew that if this succeeded, consuming the great medicine would enhance their strength, giving them a better chance to face the true creditor and increasing their odds of survival.

Though he considered himself righteous, even he might waver in such a situation. Thus, he fell silent.

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing laughed and sheathed his saber.

The trapped cultivators within the formation despaired, some cursing and roaring in fury.

Seeing this, the Crown Prince smiled. "No one in this world can refuse such a divine elixir. Come up here—just standing here, a single breath will grant you years of cultivation progress. This is a medicine that can elevate you to the heavens in one step!"

"Fine by me!"

Li Zhengjing laughed heartily and stepped forward. As he approached, he raised his left arm!

Flames and sword intent merged into one, erupting with a devastating force!

At this moment, the killing intent in Li Zhengjing's eyes was no longer concealed.

Ever since the golden page revealed its contents, he had known that from the moment he began cultivating, he was merely a spare body for the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord.

The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord intended to refine him to extend his own future!

And now, the Crown Prince sought to refine all these lives into medicine to elevate his own cultivation!

What difference was there between the Crown Prince and the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?

"Such filthy methods, feeding on the blood of others—even without the constraints of the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, I would never stoop to this!"

Two hundred small dragons surrounding Li Zhengjing opened their mouths and spat out sword energy.

He swung his saber again and again, striking at the Crown Prince!

As he advanced, he declared, "In this world, there are things one must do and things one must never do!"

He pressed forward, his killing intent soaring, thinking to himself, "I cannot become the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, nor will I ever emulate him!"

Looking at the Crown Prince before him, he seemed to see a reflection of that very Divine Lord.

In that instant, his eyes turned blood-red, his killing intent reaching its peak.

"I swear I'll kill you today!"

Flames, sword energy, saber light, thunder—even the light in Li Zhengjing's eyes burned with killing intent!

The Crown Prince could no longer hold on. He tumbled from the roof of the grand hall.

His robe glowed, protecting him, but it was already tattered. Severely injured, he looked utterly wretched.

He had prepared countless contingencies, but never considered that Li Zhengjing—a mere youth who had cultivated for less than a year—would become the key to his downfall.

As Li Zhengjing approached, the Crown Prince no longer hid his hatred and fury, his eyes filled with resentment and unwillingness.

"You're young and inexperienced. How can you turn a blind eye to such a divine elixir?"

"Because I don’t need it!"

Li Zhengjing strode forward.

But at that moment, over a dozen golden dragons surged toward him!

The five divine beings, seeing the Crown Prince defeated, had no choice but to command the dragons to aid him.

Yet with the dragons shifting positions, the formation destabilized. The five Human Immortals seized the chance to break free, charging out of the formation to face the five divine beings amidst the raging flames.

The five Human Immortals clashed with the five divine beings, and a great battle erupted instantly.

Meanwhile, the golden dragons returned to the Crown Prince's control.

"Li Zhengjing! With just a year of cultivation, you've ruined centuries of the Great Zhou's plans and destroyed my life's work!"

The Crown Prince stood in mid-air, surrounded by golden dragons, and charged at Li Zhengjing!

Though Li Zhengjing now fought like a Human Immortal, facing nearly twenty golden dragons left him struggling.

His external mana condensed into the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, but in his haste, it wasn't enough to slay the dragons.

The twenty golden dragons coiled around him, attacking relentlessly, spewing golden flames that engulfed him.

The five Human Immortals and five divine beings, locked in their own battle, sensed the shift—some shocked, some delighted, some regretful.

Among the thousands of cultivators on the celestial stairways, emotions were mixed.

Some, envious, rejoiced at seeing a prodigy meet his end.

Others, grateful, wept at his tragic fate.

But in that moment, thunder flashed, flames and sword energy surged endlessly.

A battered figure emerged slowly.

Drenched in blood, his expression was icy.

"Twenty golden dragons flying around are hard to fight. But when they gather in one place, it becomes easier..."

With each step, Li Zhengjing's injuries healed slightly.

He walked forward, stopping before the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince's face was deathly pale.

"How could twenty golden dragons fail to kill you?"

"If I couldn't heal, I'd be dead twenty times over. But I can..."

Li Zhengjing swung his saber, severing the Crown Prince's arms to stop his hand seals, then placed the blade against his neck.

Without hesitation, before the Crown Prince could speak, he slashed horizontally.

The Crown Prince fell backward, his head rolling away.

His eyes remained fixed on Li Zhengjing, filled with unwillingness and regret.

He had believed today would be his chance to ascend as an Immortal Emperor. Instead, he was defeated by the second son of the Marquis of Jian'an—a youth he had never even considered a threat.

A year ago, this boy hadn't even begun cultivating, while his own grand scheme had been nearly complete.

"As the next emperor of the Great Zhou, seeking to restore its glory is understandable," Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "But his methods were too ruthless. This end is not undeserved."

Li Zhengjing turned his gaze elsewhere.

The five divine beings, enraged by the Crown Prince's death, surged toward him.

The five Human Immortals seized the moment to attack, suppressing the divine beings.

But the Human Immortal from Luofu Immortal Sect, hoping to use the divine beings to kill Li Zhengjing, deliberately slackened his efforts, allowing one to break free.

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing raised his left arm, unleashing flames and sword intent to repel the divine being.

At the same time, the five Human Immortals struck back with their treasures, forcing the disoriented divine beings back into the alchemy formation.

The golden dragons coiled around the twenty-four Dragon Pillars remained outside, but though the formation was unstable, it still held, retaining its refining power.

"Something's wrong..." Yuan Zhengfeng murmured. "The elders from Kunlun Immortal Sect and Vajra Temple seem hesitant. But the other three... they want to complete the formation and refine the divine elixir!"

This elixir could allow any True Qi cultivator to break through to the Human Immortal realm—and for existing Human Immortals, it could elevate them even further.

With the five divine beings and thousands of cultivators inside, the resulting elixir would be unparalleled!

Li Zhengjing might see this "divine elixir" as worthless, but clearly, others were unwilling to let it go.

His killing intent flaring, Li Zhengjing leaped toward the grand hall.

He raised his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber and swung at the structure.

But at that moment, the Luofu Immortal Sect's Grand Elder roared, "Audacious!"

Though aged, his eyes burned with fury.

Of all present, he was the most desperate for the elixir.

With the Luofu Sect's strongest leader dead and half its Human Immortals fallen, the sect's prestige was in shambles.

If he could break through to the next level, he could become the new sect leader and preserve its millennia-old legacy.

"The Crown Prince is dead—this matter is settled!" Li Zhengjing stood atop the hall's roof and declared, "I've done what your righteous sects should have done. What more do you want?"

He glared at the Luofu Grand Elder. "Do you intend to continue refining lives like a demonic practitioner?"

The grotto-heaven fell silent.

"Earlier, you allowed the formation to activate, watching as the Crown Prince turned lives into medicine!"

"If you killed him afterward and took the elixir, you could claim righteousness—accepting the divine medicine out of necessity."

"But now that he's dead, maintaining this formation makes you no different from demonic practitioners!"

Li Zhengjing struck the roof again.

The hall trembled, the formation weakening further.

As he prepared to strike once more, the Luofu Grand Elder shouted, "Li Zhengjing! This formation is unstable! Without the Imperial Seal to suppress it, forcibly breaking it will cause the twenty-four Dragon Pillars to rebel! The golden dragons will rampage, and the five divine beings will escape! Even if you break the formation, none of the thousands inside will survive!"

Chen Zhu added calmly, "The outcome is decided. No matter what, those who entered the grotto-heaven are doomed. Since they must die, why waste their lives? It's better to refine the elixir and share it among us."

"If I wanted the elixir, I could've taken half from the Crown Prince. Why share it with you five?"

Li Zhengjing gathered flames and sword intent in his left arm, aiming at the formation's core. Then he turned to the cultivators on the celestial stairways and shouted, "Do you wish to offer your lifelong cultivation to these five Human Immortals? Or would you rather break the formation, face the dragons, and fight for your lives?"

"Immortal Zhengjing, free us!"

"Break the formation! We'll take our chances!"

"We'd rather turn to ash than become medicine for these so-called immortals and arhats!"

"Immortal Zhengjing, save us!"

"Immortal Zhengjing, break the formation!"

The crowd roared in fury, their voices united.

When life was at stake, they no longer cared about immortal sects or Buddhist temples.

Only by breaking the formation could they have a sliver of hope.

Otherwise, they were doomed to become ingredients for the elixir.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing was their only hope—the one who could give them a chance to survive.

"Very well!"

Li Zhengjing unleashed the Blazing Sun Divine Sword from his left arm!

The already weakened grand hall collapsed under the strike.

Instantly, cracks spread across the twenty-four Dragon Pillars, and the golden dragons went berserk, slaughtering indiscriminately.

As the formation shattered, flames scattered, reducing weaker cultivators to ash.

The five divine beings, freed from the formation's suppression, clashed with the five Human Immortals.

The Human Immortals, seeing the situation lost, reluctantly engaged the divine beings.

The elders from Kunlun Immortal Sect, Feather Transformation Sect's new Gu Yue Peak leader Chen Zhu, the Vajra Temple's Arhat Hall leader, and the Suspended Cloud Temple's arhat all fought the divine beings—except for the Luofu Grand Elder, who was consumed by rage.

Ignoring the divine being before him, he charged at Li Zhengjing!

That divine being, now unopposed, also turned its fury toward Li Zhengjing, the slayer of the Crown Prince.

One immortal and one god descended upon him.

"I'll end your life today!"

"Come then!"

Li Zhengjing, brimming with killing intent, met them head-on.

Meanwhile, the golden dragons battling the Hanging-Wall Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree also went wild as the Dragon Pillars were damaged.

The bird seized the chance to retreat, wielding a Dragon Pillar fragment to aid Li Zhengjing.

The Five Elements Creation Tree also disengaged, directing the Profound Insight Mirror at the Luofu Grand Elder.

In an instant, chaos engulfed the grotto-heaven.

The entire realm trembled as those below the Human Immortal level perished in the crossfire.

When gods and immortals battle, mortals suffer.

Only Jia Shifang managed to shield himself under a magic bowl, avoiding the devastation.

The twenty-four golden dragons rampaged, leaving dismembered bodies in their wake.

Remnants of the alchemy flames burned everything.

Four Human Immortals fought four divine beings, no longer restrained by the formation, clashing with earth-shaking force.

Li Zhengjing, the Hanging-Wall Bird, and the Five Elements Creation Tree battled the Luofu Grand Elder and the Great Zhou divine being.

Amidst the chaos, a figure stepped effortlessly into the grotto-heaven.

He wore a high crown, a dark green robe, and a bronze ghost mask, walking through the turmoil as if strolling through a garden.

His presence was so subtle that no one noticed him—like a mosquito entering unnoticed.

In two steps, he reached the little dragon girl, his eyes showing surprise.

Without pause, he reached out and seized the Imperial Seal.

"Ah!"

The dragon girl looked up into the eyes behind the mask.

They seemed to smile.

Enraged, she swung a fist at him.

The figure sidestepped and lightly pushed her head.

She toppled over.

The motion was casual, as if pushing over a child.

Yet when she hit the ground, one of her horns broke off.

The masked man chuckled, crushed the Imperial Seal in his grip, and swallowed the light within.

His aura swelled.

Under the stunned gazes of the Human Immortals, arhats, divine beings, and thousands of cultivators, he turned and walked out of the grotto-heaven.

"The Third World-Saving Heavenly Venerable of the Salvation Golden Ship... He is... the Creditor?"
