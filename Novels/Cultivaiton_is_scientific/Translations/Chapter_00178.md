# Chapter 178: Shifting the Blame

Li Shiming stayed at the Wei Clan's stronghold for another twenty days. He only ended his seclusion when his spiritual energy reserves were sufficient to fully deploy the Nine Palaces Sword Formation. During this time, he made a decision—to chart a separate path for Li Yuanba.

Yes, he needed to part ways with Li Yuanba. He had tested it—no matter how far apart their physical bodies were, the connection between their souls remained unaffected. They could exchange thoughts anytime, anywhere. This eliminated the possibility of the "clone rebelling against the master" scenario he had read about in some ancient texts. 

Li Yuanba had no background, and Li Shiming didn't plan to fabricate one for him. While a fabricated identity might work for small sects or minor factions, it wouldn't withstand scrutiny from major sects. Therefore, he decided to use the Senluo Token to have Li Yuanba join the Senluo Sect. For a rootless cultivator like Li Yuanba, this was likely the only way to enter a major sect.

Though the Senluo Sect was a demonic sect, it was still a major power currently planning to unify the vast territory of the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Li Yuanba already had his own cultivation method and didn't need to practice demonic techniques. Li Shiming was mainly interested in the Senluo Sect's resources, which would provide more avenues for obtaining cultivation materials.

This was a necessary decision. His main body now had to consider acquiring third-grade Five Elements formation materials. Moreover, Li Yuanba would also need substantial resources to advance quickly. Relying solely on Li Shiming to gather everything would slow his own cultivation progress—something he couldn't afford given his already slow advancement.

Having made this decision, it was time to divide their assets. He gave Li Yuanba a fifty-cubic-meter storage bag (for appearances) and the storage bracelet that originally belonged to Li Yuanba (though conspicuous, its large capacity was useful if used discreetly). He also allocated one million spirit stones and all thirty-six remaining formation flags—his entire remaining stock, as the flags deployed at the Wei Clan's stronghold had lost most of their spiritual energy, and he lacked materials to make more.

Though Li Yuanba wasn't a formation master, their soul connection allowed him to utilize Li Shiming's advanced formation skills to deploy the flags when needed.

Li Shiming also gave Li Yuanba the jade flying boat. He wasn't short of flying boats—during his time in Tianhai Island, his enemies were either elite sect members or cultivators connected to Golden Core experts, so flying boats frequently appeared among the spoils.

Before leaving, he used his remaining formation materials to seal the cave dwelling, completely blocking access to the upper-grade spirit vein. Without the spirit vein, the site would be useless as a cultivation base even if others occupied it. After all this time without the Wei Clan's Foundation Building cultivators returning, they were likely dead, meaning the spirit vein would probably remain undiscovered. This was his emergency refuge in case of life-threatening danger.

Li Shiming and Li Yuanba left the Wei Clan's stronghold via a secret passage, emerging from a riverbed outside the valley. Boarding a flying boat, they sat on deck—now at Foundation Building stage, they no longer needed to move like frightened mice.

From the Wei Clan's archives, Li Shiming had learned about the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The number of cultivators in Northern Shu far surpassed Tianhai Island, especially Foundation Building cultivators, due to abundant resources. In Tianhai, only the seven major sects controlled strategic resources like Foundation Establishment Pills, but in Northern Shu, anyone with spiritual roots could cultivate. Even five-element spiritual root holders could advance with sufficient resources and proper techniques. Foundation Establishment Pills were widely available—purchasable with spirit stones, obtainable through competitions, or by joining factions. His seven Foundation Establishment Pills were now mostly devalued here.

While Foundation Building cultivators were numerous, Golden Core cultivators remained relatively scarce—though "scarce" by Northern Shu standards still far exceeded Tianhai's numbers. Just the Mingxin Sect alone in the Hundred Thousand Mountains had nearly twenty Golden Core cultivators and one False Infant expert—enough to overwhelm Tianhai's seven major sects combined.

After several hours of low-altitude flight, Li Shiming witnessed multiple battles—between Qi Refining cultivators, Foundation Building cultivators, and even large-scale clashes involving dozens. "Such chaos," he sighed. "As long as it doesn't involve us," Li Yuanba replied, eyes closed as he contemplated sword intent. Their displayed Foundation Building aura deterred most troublemakers.

Li Shiming had discovered that by transmitting sword intent from the Sword Bone to Li Yuanba, then having Li Yuanba refine it through the "Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art," the resulting sword intent became more compatible with them. Though the process was complex, the enhanced power was evident.

"Trouble ahead," Li Shiming noted as a fleeing female cultivator approached, pursued by five others. The woman, using sword遁 at Foundation Building level, was followed by a specialized flying boat matching her speed. Li Shiming immediately changed course to avoid involvement, but the woman redirected toward them.

"Fellow Daoists, take this treasure!" she shouted, tossing a box their way. Recognizing her attempt to shift blame, Li Shiming repelled the box with spiritual energy. "This matter doesn't concern us. Approach again, and we won't hold back," he warned, releasing intimidating pressure with lightning flickering in his eyes.

Despite being a new Foundation Building cultivator, his highly condensed spiritual energy matched peak early-stage veterans in quality. Foundation Building advancement was slow—most future Golden Core cultivators spent decades at this stage, creating significant power gaps even within the same minor realm.

"Looks like Daoist Yi found helpers," sneered a sharp-nosed young man leading the pursuers, flanked by a mid-Foundation Building elder. "We're just passing through," Li Shiming said, but the woman insisted, "You can't back out now!" Her gaze lingered on the strikingly handsome Li Yuanba, whose appearance often distracted opponents.

Seeing the young man's murderous glare, Li Shiming sighed. "Seems we're fighting." Li Yuanba erupted with sword intent, his flying sword striking the woman's spirit artifact shield—a rare sight that surprised Li Shiming, as most Northern Shu Foundation Building cultivators used only top-grade magical instruments. The shield's control weakened under the assault.

Li Shiming deployed the Nine Palaces Sword Formation, nine flying swords forming a thunder array that trapped all six adversaries. "We're from Baize Mountain. Withdraw now, or face consequences," the elder warned, wary of Li Shiming's thunder techniques and Li Yuanba's sword cultivation. 

"It's too late for that," Li Shiming replied, noting the young master's arrogance and jealousy toward Li Yuanba. Knowing such privileged cultivators would hunt them down later, he chose to eliminate the threat completely.

As thunder serpents danced within the formation, the elder ordered, "Protect the young master! Kill them!" The woman, struggling against Li Yuanba's relentless sword light that battered both body and spirit, found retreat impossible. Meanwhile, Li Yuanba rapidly adapted his sword techniques in real combat, assimilating the "Ten Directions Sword Cultivation Art" methods that Li Shiming had mastered through IBMz15's computational analysis.
