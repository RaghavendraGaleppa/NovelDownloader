# 第一百九十二章 夺魁！

How will he respond?

Within the layers of mist, a hint of anticipation flickered across Chang Jin's face. Her beautiful eyes sparkled with a curious light as she scanned Zhang Jing's placid expression.

Initially, Chang Jin's sole objective in entering the Pride Cloud Secret Realm within the human territory was to secure first place in the Foundation Establishment stage and complete her chosen trial. Nothing else mattered.

But now, while completing the task remained paramount, observing the true strength hidden by the human man named Zhang Jing had also become a goal, almost unconsciously.

She had always believed that the strength of human Foundation Establishment cultivators peaked at a level similar to that of Ji Changyu. After all, it was a racial limitation. Unlike the various races of the myriad realms, who were born with divine gifts and incredible talents, humans underwent a process of life transformation through cultivation.

Therefore, humans in the lower realms were naturally at a disadvantage when facing the powerful races of the myriad realms. Only a rare few geniuses could break through this barrier.

However, Zhang Jing's appearance seemed to shatter Chang Jin's perception. It reminded her of a casual remark made by a deity within her clan: "Weak and ordinary as ants at birth, yet possessing almost limitless potential!"

"Though unlike us royal clans, favored by a particular Great Dao from birth, they are also not bound by any Great Dao."

"Every sip and every peck is predetermined."

Thinking this, Chang Jin looked at Zhang Jing again, feeling the increasingly intense aura of danger emanating from him. She murmured, "Is this the limitless potential of humans?"

As her voice faded, the illusory image of the bright moon behind Chang Jin shone brilliantly, its cool moonlight instantly enveloping the entire arena.

In an instant, the scene within the moonlight's reach transformed. The true meaning of Taiyin permeated the air, forcefully clearing away all other powers. Zhang Jing, within the moonlight's embrace, seemed to be teetering on the brink.

Below, on Hero Island and the other arenas, seeing the same scene as when Ji Changyu had been defeated, the crowd anticipated what would happen next and averted their gazes, unable to bear witnessing another defeat.

They had already been disheartened once.

...

But at that moment, Chang Jin's eyes widened in surprise. A complex expression, both expected and unexpected, flashed across her face.

She saw a wisp of extremely faint Chaos Immortal Light quietly appear in Zhang Jing's hand. The moment that light appeared, Chang Jin felt her own talent-based domain emit a faint, almost imperceptible wail.

At the same time, the sense of crisis that had been lingering in her heart reached its peak. Chang Jin unconsciously bit her lip.

The good news was that she had finally seen the other party's hidden strength; the bad news was that his methods seemed to be extremely effective against her talent-based divine power.

It seemed her mission might not be completed this time.

...

In the arena, watching the Taiyin domain suddenly begin to boil, a faint smile flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes.

The next moment, he pointed forward. A dazzling Primordial Chaos Immortal Light flew out from behind him, quickly sweeping across the surroundings.

For the first time, the Primordial Chaos Immortal Light revealed its terrifying and domineering nature to the world!

*Crack, crack*—

The domain began to tremble violently. Wherever the Primordial Chaos Immortal Light passed, the seemingly unbreakable Taiyin domain shattered instantly, leaving behind a network of black spatial rifts like spiderwebs.

The aura of earth, fire, wind, and water attached to them intertwined, gradually widening these black spatial rifts.

*Buzz!*

The Taiyin domain trembled incessantly, and the bright moon hanging in the depths of the sky emitted a myriad of clear moonlight, shining like a great sun.

A massive amount of Taiyin power poured out, and the terrifying Taiyin Dao intent began to gradually drive out and compress the earth, fire, wind, and water aura attached to the black spatial rifts, seemingly trying to reconnect and repair the broken domain.

However, it was all too slow, too late.

With a thought from Zhang Jing, the Primordial Chaos Immortal Light moved like a nimble fish, traversing freely within Chang Jin's Taiyin domain.

Finally...

*Boom*—

The Immortal Light flashed.

The bright moon above was silently shattered.

The black spatial rifts that permeated the entire Taiyin domain seemed to lose all restraint and began to spread wildly.

In an instant, the scene around Zhang Jing changed again.

He had returned to the arena.

At that moment, the Primordial Chaos Immortal Light crossed the sky, carrying a terrifying intent to create the heavens, and slashed directly towards Chang Jin.

Her protective spiritual light shattered like paper.

Then came the mist covering her face.

In a fleeting glimpse, a stunningly beautiful face, blessed by the spirit of heaven and earth, came into view. The delicate, jade-like face, with its spirited features, was perfectly natural, leaving those who saw it in awe of the creator's artistry.

At that moment, Chang Jin's eyebrows furrowed slightly, and her gaze towards Zhang Jing was filled with helplessness and a hint of gentle reproach.

As if to say: I'll remember you.

A flash of white light.

Chang Jin's figure instantly disappeared from the spot.

The Primordial Chaos Immortal Light continued unabated, heading straight for the arena.

But the next moment, Zhang Jing's expression changed, and he waved his hand abruptly, causing the Primordial Chaos Immortal Light to vanish without a trace, as if it had never appeared.

A faint voice slowly faded away in his ear.

"An arena costs ninety million units of luck. This first offense will not be counted, but any further violations will be deducted from your rewards."

Zhang Jing was familiar with this voice.

It came from the Secret Realm Spirit.

That was why he had decisively dispersed the Immortal Light.

After all, ninety million units of luck was not a small amount.

"You could have reminded me earlier."

Zhang Jing smiled sheepishly, his gaze unconsciously sweeping over the spot where Chang Jin's figure had disappeared.

A lingering trace of awe remained in his eyes.

How could there be such a nearly flawless face in the world?

Zhang Jing marveled inwardly.

Yes, Chang Jin's face gave him the feeling of being perfect and flawless, with all the elements in just the right proportions, exuding a sense of natural harmony.

That kind of beauty transcended the ordinary.

It was a magnificent creation of heaven and earth!

"A world-shattering beauty. No wonder Chang Jin's face is always shrouded in mist. It must be the protection of her elders."

Zhang Jing realized.

Soon, the awe in his eyes gradually faded, replaced by excitement and anticipation.

His gaze turned to the scroll in the sky.

The rankings on it had already undergone a slight change.

[Rank B-1: Zhang Jing, Wins: 99]

[Rank A-1: Chang Jin, Wins: 98]

[Rank C-1: Ji Changyu, Wins: 97]

[Rank A-2: Qu Junhou, Wins: 96]

...

...

"Next should be the Secret Realm Spirit announcing the luck rewards for each ranking, and..."

Zhang Jing glanced at the golden sun in the sky.

A hint of longing flickered across his face.

...

At that moment, in a certain space in the outer layer of the Secret Realm, the stands were silent.

Many people clutched their chests, seemingly unable to bear the continuous and shocking reversals.

Their faces were flushed with excitement!

From the initial despair at the appearance of the mysterious woman, to the rekindled hope when Ji Changyu and Zhang Jing successively displayed strength no less than hers.

Then came the surprise when Zhang Jing 'struggled' to defeat Ji Changyu, who seemed to be the strongest.

Then, the despair as the mysterious woman displayed extremely terrifying combat power, directly sweeping Ji Changyu out of the game with overwhelming force, causing their mood to plummet to the bottom once again.

Seeing this, everyone thought the ending was set.

But who would have thought that the one who was easily defeated in the end was the mysterious woman!

Instead of Zhang Jing, who was not favored from the start.

"Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect! Zhang Jing!"

For a time, everyone silently chanted these two names in their hearts, their faces overflowing with excitement and pride.

It was not that there were no human Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Their genius was even stronger than the myriad realms!

...

In a corner of the stands.

"How is it?"

A pretty woman covered her eyes tightly with both hands, wanting to see but afraid to see, and could only softly ask the man beside her.

Hearing this, the man looked at Zhang Jing on the arena with unconscious fervor, and said with a smile:

"Overwhelming!"

"Then why are you smiling?!"

The woman said angrily, her voice clearly carrying a hint of crying.

"I mean—our human genius won!"

"And he swept away the opponents from the myriad realms with overwhelming force!"

A brilliant smile suddenly appeared on the man's face.

...

On a certain arena.

"Hahaha, well done! Daoist Zhang Jing!"

A man suddenly reacted and couldn't help laughing heartily.

Although he still couldn't quite believe what had just happened on the stage.

But... who cared so much.

Anyway, their human top genius had won.

And opposite the man.

The Water-Avoiding Deer looked incredulous.

It couldn't help looking at the lonely figure on the distant arena, feeling a trance in its mind.

How could the adult lose?

It made no sense at all.

She was a descendant of the Heavenly God!

Even in the myriad realms, she was the most top-notch genius, how could she lose to a human in the Foundation Establishment stage?!

And in this way!

...

Not far away.

Ji Changyu's eyes were slightly dazed.

As someone who had personally experienced Chang Jin's talent-based divine power before, he naturally understood how terrifying its power was.

That Taiyin domain that repelled everything was simply despairing.

So he didn't really want to watch that duel.

Anyway, the result was already determined.

There would be no suspense.

But.

He didn't want to pay attention, but the opponent on the arena was paying attention to the battle over there, and was completely defenseless.

At this time.

Ji Changyu naturally couldn't bring himself to attack.

Helplessly.

He could only look at the arena where Zhang Jing and Chang Jin were.

But he never expected—

This look directly stunned Ji Changyu.

Especially the terrifying Immortal Light that Zhang Jing controlled, which easily tore apart Chang Jin's talent-based divine power.

Just looking at it from a distance.

He felt a chill all over his body.

"What exactly is that Immortal Light? Why didn't Zhang Jing use it when we fought?"

After thinking for a moment.

A wry smile appeared on Ji Changyu's face.

The other party did not use that Immortal Light when fighting with him, obviously because he was considering Chang Jin.

In other words.

Zhang Jing probably knew Chang Jin's strength from the beginning.

Thinking of this.

"There are also differences between the nine ranks of Foundation Establishment!"

Ji Changyu sighed.

...

Time passed little by little.

As the magic fluctuations on the last arena gradually subsided.

The final ranking on the heavenly scroll was finalized.

A pleasant smile quietly bloomed on the giant face of the Secret Realm Spirit covering the sky.

Then came a grand and impassioned voice.

Resounding in everyone's ears.

"The final ranking of the Foundation Establishment stage of this Pride Cloud Secret Realm has been determined, and the rewards will now be issued!"

"One hundredth place, Qi Yunteng!"

"Reward for this ranking—zero!"
