**Chapter 74: Sorry, I Forgot My Money**

"This is the last item of the auction, a magnificent creature from the Eastern Endless Forest in the God-Forsaken Land – an Elf!"

A creature bound by black divine chains was pushed onto the stage. Its entire body was veiled only by white gauze covering certain private areas. It had snow-white skin, a full bosom, and a graceful figure. Its eyes were green, its ears pointed, and its gaze carried timidity and fear, making one instinctively feel pity.

Seeing this creature, Zhou Tian had a strange feeling. Why did this creature seem so familiar?

Everyone turned their gaze to Zhou Tian. He did not disappoint, shouting with full vigor:

"One thousand divine crystals!"

Another exorbitant price.

After the last item was auctioned off, the black-robed man on stage said:

"Today's auction ends here!"

Having spoken, he impatiently led his people down. Everything Zhou Tian had "bought" followed him, including the elf.

"Friend, that's a total of 2100 divine crystals. Would you mind settling the bill?"

The other black-robed figures didn't leave through hidden passages as usual; instead, they stood their ground, watching. They sensed a good show was about to unfold today.

"Alright," Zhou Tian replied, reaching into his crotch and fumbling around.

The black-robed man stiffened. *Where is he keeping the money?* Still, it looked like he had money on him, and that was all that mattered.

Zhou Tian fumbled for a while, then withdrew his hand, empty.

The black-robed man had a bad feeling. Sure enough, Zhou Tian spoke:

"Sorry, I forgot my money. Can I pay later?"

The atmosphere became incredibly awkward, almost spiraling out of control. The black-robed man's expression was hidden, but the arm extended from beneath his robe trembled continuously.

"Friend, this joke isn't funny!" the black-robed man suppressed the rage in his heart, speaking chillingly.

"I really did forget it! Who's joking with you? You're unbelievable, is it that hard to trust someone?" Zhou Tian said, displeased. Where had the trust between people gone?

Visibly, the black-robed man's entire body began to tremble. His exposed arm turned crimson, swelling into a beast's claw with thick fingers and jet-black nails, covered in black fur. A wicked aura circulated around it, and faint bloody light flickered.

*Bang!*

With lightning speed, the beast claw slammed into Zhou Tian's chest.

*Splat!*

Zhou Tian seemed to hear a strange sound near his ear, probably his heart exploding. This was his last thought.

Just like the black-robed man yesterday, this one hadn't expected to defeat Zhou Tian so easily. The beast claw twitched. Had he grown stronger again?

Then, he witnessed a bizarre sight: Zhou Tian's "corpse" lying on the ground suddenly vanished. Everyone was stunned. What was happening?

The black-robed man froze for a moment, then turned and said:

"Forgive my gaffe, perhaps we should restart the bidding for this item?"

"No, no."

"I forgot to turn off my divine fire stove at home, I need to rush back."

All the black-robed figures made excuses. This matter today was too strange. Could it be that some big shot from Tianguan had set their sights on this place? Whether they could come here again was now a question.

Outside the room, Zhou Tian's figure appeared. He picked himself up from the ground, rubbed his chest, and grumbled:

"No way, I definitely need to find a skill to reduce pain in the future. That was too painful."

The black-robed man had been too close to him. To avoid trouble, he hadn't even bothered with pleasantries; he just left immediately after resurrecting. If that guy had hit him again, he would have had to wait for his resurrection count to reset before coming back to life. By then, the "day lilies would be cold" (meaning it would be too late), and it would be hard to explain to the people of Tianqin.

"Sigh... I'm sorry, Elf Miss, but I can't help you."

Zhou Tian thought of the pitiful elf girl, but unfortunately, he had no way to help her now.

He could send people to raid the place tomorrow and rescue the elf girl, but that would mean offending both the dark and light sides of Tianguan.

He didn't believe that the commanders of the Eight Great Forces stationed there would be unaware of Tianguan's dark side. Judging by the patrolling soldiers' practiced movements, it was likely not their first time collecting protection fees.

Darkness protected within the system was the hardest to eliminate because it would offend both sides. Although his status was noble and his life wouldn't be in danger, this matter wouldn't achieve any results. In the worst-case scenario, he might just get reprimanded, and the issue would be dropped, possibly even earning him the title of "idiot." It was far too troublesome.

All for an elf of a different race? Even if he rescued her, in that elf's eyes, Zhou Tian would probably be no different from those people.

Doing good deeds without expecting anything in return? Zhou Tian didn't possess such noble sentiments. He could only sigh in regret, wondering which beast would defile this elf girl.

Since he had spent a lot of time searching for a house today, by the time he returned to the mansion, dawn was already breaking. He felt like he had barely fallen asleep before being roused; people from the Grand Luo Academy had arrived.

In the mansion's main hall, Zhou Xunchuan and the others sat in order, while Zhou Yan and Zhou Ying sat at the head.

"Do these people really need to come so early? I'm dead tired..."

Zhou Tian yawned, rubbed a piece of eye booger from his eye, and wiped it onto Zhou Zui, who was beside him, causing the others to instinctively move a little further away.

A flash of green light, and the eye booger Zhou Tian had just wiped away vanished. Zhou Zui said with disdain:

"What were you doing last night? Why are you so listless?"

"Yesterday..." Zhou Tian thought for a moment and said:

"Last night, someone smashed my heart, and I still haven't recovered."

*Sigh...* Zhou Zui stroked his forehead and let out a long sigh. His spirit was so listless it was causing him to talk nonsense.

Not long after, a group of five entered through the hall doors. Leading them was a young man clad in a Kirin jade robe, wearing a golden hair-restraining crown. He possessed a pair of purple pupils that exuded pressure, as if a divine mountain were bearing down.

Behind him followed four youths, all outstanding individuals with steady steps and extraordinary presence.

"Jun Feng, long time no see."

Zhou Yan stood up, his eyes shining like the moon. It was as if a great dragon soared, tearing apart the divine mountain and dissipating the pressure into nothingness.

"Prince Yan, I didn't expect you to lead the team personally this time."

Jun Feng unceremoniously led his people to sit down. Although he addressed him as Prince Yan, he showed no respect whatsoever.

"Which one is the Prince of Qin's heir?"

After sitting down, Jun Feng spoke indifferently, his purple eyes as deep as the sea, scanning Zhou Tian and the others.

"Hey, hey, Zhou Tian, he's looking for you..."

Zhou Zui nudged the drowsy Zhou Tian beside him.

"Who's looking for me?" Zhou Tian was startled awake, seeing Jun Feng staring at him. *Why do these people all look like non-mainstream fashionistas wearing colored contacts?* he thought, rubbing his eyes and saying:

"My apologies, I didn't sleep well last night. What can I do for you?"

Jun Feng's eyes narrowed slightly, staring at Zhou Tian. Purple light rippled in his pupils; he felt he was being underestimated.
