# Chapter 21: Xiao Qin's Old Grandfather, Fire Sparrow Feather

At the cave entrance.

"That True Disciple Li entered the third level of the Divine Edge Cave?"

"Holy crap, how did he get in there?"

"He's doomed. A few years ago, someone who had just entered the Inner Breath realm accidentally wandered into the third level. When they were rescued, not only were they riddled with holes, but their mind was also damaged. Even after being cured, they were still drooling."

"Hiss... He won't die on our peak, will he?"

"That's Shang Wu's disciple... I just remembered I haven't hung the laundry at home, I'm going back first."

The cave entrance was bustling. Many disciples had even stopped forging iron, gathering to discuss. If a True Disciple were to have an accident in the Divine Edge Cave, it would be a huge scandal for the Clear Abyss Sect.

Murong Xiao paced back and forth, anxious as an ant on a hot pan. "Brother Li is such a good person, please don't let anything happen to him..."

He was murmuring to himself when he suddenly brightened up.

"Why are you all gathered here? Get back to your business!" Han He walked ahead, scolding the inner disciples who were gossiping. Shang Wu and Li Mo then walked out from behind him.

Little Li was still wearing that same smile.

"Brother Li, are you alright? Do you still recognize me? How many fingers is this?" Murong Xiao took huge strides, jumping in front of Li Mo and wiggling his fingers.

"Five... Uh, don't you only have five fingers?" Li Mo thought it was some kind of brain teaser.

"What's five plus five?"

"...Ten."

After a series of intelligence tests.

"It's good that you didn't turn into an idiot." Murong Xiao sighed in relief, his face filled with genuine happiness.

Li Mo: "...Thank you."

Before they could say much, Li Mo was pulled by Shang Wu onto the carriage.

"Let's go, old geezer." Shang Wu, in an excellent mood, gave the foal's rump a whip.

The carriage gradually drove away.

"Brother Li, take care on your way." Murong Xiao waved at Li Mo.

Seeing this, Han He couldn't help but feel curious. How did his disciple know Li Mo, and seem to have such a close relationship? Never mind, it doesn't matter. The Nine Peaks Martial Competition has nothing to do with personal feelings; at that time, they would still have to compete for supremacy. No matter how gifted Li Mo was, he had only just entered the Qi-Blood realm, and the difference in cultivation realm with Murong Xiao was evident. As for later, it was hard to say...

"Xiao'er."

"In a little over ten days, all newly promoted disciples will participate in the sect trial. During this period, you will follow me every afternoon to refine your martial skills."

"Yes."

***

Night fell.

The vast Clear Serenity Mountain Range was utterly silent. In the large courtyard where the outer disciples resided, a certain house still had its lights on.

Xiao Qin held the Profound Crystal, and his cultivation realm had astonishingly recovered to the Ninth Meridian of the Qi-Blood realm. More than half of that Profound Crystal had already turned grayish-white. This was naturally not solely due to him.

"Hoo..."

"Tenth Meridian, I've returned to the Tenth Meridian of the Qi-Blood realm!" Xiao Qin opened his eyes again, and a hint of joy couldn't help but appear on his resolute face.

But then, he looked at the Profound Crystal in his palm, which had completely turned grayish-white and was indistinguishable from an ordinary stone, and couldn't help but look puzzled. "The entire block has been drained? I shouldn't be able to do that..."

"Naturally, you couldn't do it. It was because of this old man."

Suddenly, an old voice resonated in his ear.

"Who are you?!"

"My name... it is a story from a distant past..."
