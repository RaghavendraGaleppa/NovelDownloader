# Chapter 50: Senior Team Member

Before long.

Senior Brother Li and Zhang Jing walked one after another into a small palace.

Inside the palace, two middle-aged men appeared to be arguing about something, their faces flushed with excitement. Beside them sat an elderly man with graying hair, watching their debate with an amused smile, showing no intention of intervening. Around the three of them were arranged several bronze tables, piled with spirit paper, spirit ink, and a few spirit brushes.

Tap, tap—

The sound of Senior Brother Li and Zhang Jing's footsteps suddenly echoed through the hall.

The three men immediately stopped their actions and turned to look at the newcomers.

The next moment.

"We greet Senior Brother Li!" the elder said, standing at the forefront and leading the other two in bowing to the newly arrived Senior Brother Li.

"No need for formalities, junior brothers," Senior Brother Li replied.

Zhang Jing slowed his steps.

The sight of two middle-aged men and an old man respectfully bowing to a youth who appeared barely past adolescence—who accepted the gesture with the calm demeanor of someone far older—struck Zhang Jing as both bizarre and yet somehow fitting.

"This is a world of immortal cultivation. Age can't be judged by appearance alone. I must remember that," he reminded himself sternly.

Meanwhile.

"Senior Brother, have you come today because of this junior brother?" the elder asked, glancing at Zhang Jing behind Senior Brother Li with a somewhat reserved expression.

"Indeed," Senior Brother Li confirmed, stepping forward to introduce Zhang Jing. "This is Junior Brother Zhang Jing. I've brought him here today to verify his success rate in crafting lower-grade talismans. I'd like the three of you to witness it."

"Understood. Please wait a moment, Senior Brother," the elder nodded, as if he had anticipated this request.

He then called the other two middle-aged men to prepare one of the bronze tables, clearing away its contents and replacing them with fresh spirit paper and ink.

Once everything was ready, the elder approached Zhang Jing and said somewhat apologetically:

"Junior Brother Zhang, our current conditions outside the sect are rather crude. Please forgive the inconvenience. Do you need anything else prepared? If so, please let us know. A talisman master's work requires careful preparation—"

"This is already excellent. Thank you, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied, surveying the bronze table with satisfaction.

If this was considered "crude," then the conditions he'd worked under for the past half-month while making talismans must have been downright wretched.

"Then please take a moment to meditate and prepare yourself before beginning," the elder said, shaking his head. Then, as if remembering something, he added kindly, "And don't feel pressured, junior brother. If your success rate doesn't reach thirty percent this time, you can always retest when we return to Luodu Island."

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

With that, Zhang Jing walked directly to the bronze table and sat down, a spirit brush suddenly appearing in his hand.

In his sea of consciousness, the Heart's Eye Seed suddenly shone brightly.

At this moment.

All eyes in the palace were fixed on Zhang Jing.

Senior Brother Li stood solemnly in silence.

The other three stood together, their spiritual senses faintly active.

"Good heavens, this unfamiliar junior brother is quite extravagant—that's a mid-grade spirit brush!"

"Hiss—both of you, look at this junior brother's state! How did he enter such deep concentration so quickly? That's truly impressive. If someone told me he could craft talismans right next to a demon now, I'd believe them."

"He's starting, he's starting!"

Time passed slowly.

As the final stroke was completed, Zhang Jing immediately stored the spirit brush in his jade pendant space, then stood up and clasped his hands together.

"Senior Brother Li, and all three senior brothers, Zhang Jing has not failed in his mission!"

"Excellent! Truly worthy of Junior Brother Zhang!" Senior Brother Li strode forward, his eyes filled with admiration. "I'll send word immediately to have the team update your status to senior member."

"Additionally," Senior Brother Li pointed to the elder who was examining Zhang Jing's talisman, "Junior Brother, this is Senior Brother Yan. You can collect your talisman-making materials from him during this period, and you can also sell any talismans you make directly to him. I've already instructed him."

"Understood. Thank you, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said, suppressing his excitement.

"Then I'll take my leave now. Since you and Junior Brother Yan are both talisman masters, you should exchange experiences frequently."

"Safe travels, Senior Brother."

Only after Senior Brother Li's figure had completely disappeared from the palace did Zhang Jing walk briskly toward Senior Brother Yan and the other two. To his surprise, they were still studying the talisman he had just made.

"This makes no sense!" one of the middle-aged men exclaimed in confusion.

"Indeed, why are they all of superior quality?" the other middle-aged man echoed.

"Enough. Clearly, Junior Brother Zhang has exceptional talent in talisman-making. Otherwise, why would Senior Brother Li be in such a hurry to personally bring him here for verification? And—" The gray-haired Senior Brother Yan trailed off, as if hesitant to continue.

Then, remembering Senior Brother Li's earlier instructions, a look of astonishment appeared on his aged face.

"Senior Brother Yan?" Zhang Jing called out.

Hearing this, Senior Brother Yan quickly turned around and said warmly:

"Congratulations, Junior Brother Zhang, on becoming a senior member so smoothly. With your talisman-making skills, once you reach the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, becoming an attendant will be a natural progression."

"Thank you for your earlier guidance, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

Internally, he was analyzing Senior Brother Yan's words carefully.

According to him, attendants were the rank above senior members. And similarly, talisman masters had special channels for promotion to attendant, just like the current situation.

Attendants could probably exchange resources from the team's repository at lower prices.

Seventy percent? Or perhaps sixty percent?

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed slightly.

Upon closer analysis, he realized he wasn't far from becoming a team attendant. His talisman success rate wasn't a concern, and the main requirement—his cultivation level—wasn't too far off either.

From now on, he would focus entirely on mass-producing talismans.

The team would buy them all at market price.

Then he, Zhang Jing, would use the merits earned from selling talismans to purchase various spirit pills and natural treasures from the team's resource repository at discounted prices to boost his cultivation.

As his cultivation improved and time passed, his source talismans would only increase in number and quality...

A virtuous cycle?

For a brief moment, a strange thought occurred to Zhang Jing.

If this trend continued, would the Luodu Team's resource repository be stripped bare by him?

It wasn't impossible!

Unintentionally.

Zhang Jing suddenly heard one of the middle-aged men sigh: "Tsk, these superior-grade defensive talismans are hot commodities in the temporary markets of Langya County City."

He turned to Senior Brother Yan:

"Senior Brother, as a newcomer, may I ask if there are temporary markets in Langya County?"

"Haha," Senior Brother Yan laughed. "Naturally, Junior Brother Zhang. With thousands of cultivators gathered in Langya County City now, temporary markets have sprung up everywhere. However, to prevent chaos, our sect has taken over management of these markets."

"The talisman business must be doing well in these markets?" Zhang Jing asked, visibly intrigued.

"Absolutely. Whether they're sect cultivators or rogue cultivators, almost everyone has been hunting demons nonstop these days. The consumption is enormous—talismans in the markets are in high demand."

Just as he'd thought!

On his way to Langya County City, Zhang Jing had already noticed this trend.

Sect cultivators were flooding into Langya County in droves. Completing missions was likely just a side benefit—their main goal was probably the abundant low-level demons in the area.

How many merits did sect missions reward?

Hunting demons for materials was where the real profits lay!

For ordinary citizens, the demon uprising in Langya County was a catastrophe. But for sect disciples, it was a golden opportunity.

A single mission could potentially yield enough merits to cover years of cultivation expenses.

And the risks weren't even that high!

After all, the high-level demons were busy confronting the senior sect brothers. The junior disciples only had to deal with low-level demons.

With frequent battles, talisman consumption would inevitably be massive.

Facing Zhang Jing.

Senior Brother Yan's smile widened unconsciously at the mention of this.

"Haha, it seems Senior Brother has been making quite a profit recently," Zhang Jing teased.

"Ah, just a few meager merits and some demon materials. Not worth mentioning, not worth mentioning!" Senior Brother Yan waved his hands modestly.

If not for the grin that threatened to split his face, Zhang Jing might have actually believed him.

"By the way, Junior Brother asked about this because you also want to sell talismans in the markets?" Senior Brother Yan suddenly realized and looked at Zhang Jing with concern.

Zhang Jing nodded frankly. "That was indeed my thought."

"Then it's simple."

With that, Senior Brother Yan took out a copper key from his storage bag, wrote down an address, and handed both to Zhang Jing generously.

"To be honest, Junior Brother, I arrived early, so I managed to secure a few market stalls as favors. Giving one to you now seems most appropriate."

"Thank you for the gift, Senior Brother."

Without hesitation, Zhang Jing accepted the key and address.

Then he asked another question:

"Senior Brother, earlier Senior Brother Li mentioned I could collect talisman materials from you?"

"Ah—" Senior Brother Yan slapped his forehead as if suddenly remembering. "Yes! I nearly forgot about that."

As he spoke, he took out a stack of spirit paper and ink from his storage bag.

"Junior Brother, as per Senior Brother Li's instructions, you can receive five hundred sheets of lower-grade spirit paper and corresponding ink each month for free."

Zhang Jing accepted the materials, picked up the talisman from the table, and prepared to leave.

"Thank you, Senior Brother. I'll take my leave now."

"Take care, Junior Brother. This is where our team's talisman masters gather. You're welcome to stay here anytime."

"I'll keep that in mind."

On the street.

Zhang Jing rubbed the copper key in his palm thoughtfully, his brow furrowed in contemplation.

He had already made up his mind.

From now on, he wouldn't follow Senior Brother Ding and the others to hunt demons.

He would go to the temporary markets to sell talismans.

Of course, Zhang Jing's real target wasn't the talismans—it was demon cores!

He would trade these essential consumables for demon cores, even if it meant paying a slight premium. With his Crimson Divine Light, the value of the cores would instantly double.

After this exchange, the profit in merits would be dozens of times the original investment.

He would seize this opportunity to earn one or two thousand merits in one go—a sudden windfall.

At this thought.

Zhang Jing felt his heart begin to race uncontrollably.
