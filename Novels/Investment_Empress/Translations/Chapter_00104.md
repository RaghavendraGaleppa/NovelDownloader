Chapter 104

When Luo Yu arrived at the scene, the temple was in shambles. The once-vibrant Buddha statues now lay shattered on the ground, revealing the white bones within. A single ice sculpture remained, its surface etched with a serene smile.

It was clear that a fierce battle had taken place here not long ago, but now there was no one in sight. Or so it seemed.

Luo Yu's gaze fell upon the ice sculpture, and his eyes widened as he realized it was not a sculpture at all, but a person killed by sword energy. "Temple guardian?" he muttered to himself.

"If he was the temple guardian, he must have known about the white bones inside the statues," Luo Yu thought, his expression turning grave. "The technique he's practicing is... 'Replacing the Divine with the Body' - a demonic art!"

The technique, also known as "Replacing the Divine," involved creating a golden body for oneself and absorbing the incense and worship to nourish one's own soul. It was a forbidden art that required at least a level of Realm of Observation to practice.

"This temple guardian was at the Realm of Observation, and he was killed?" Luo Yu's mind reeled. "Who could have killed him?"

His eyes scanned the area, and he noticed the sword energy infused with icy coldness. "Ying Bing?" he whispered, his heart racing. "Did she really kill someone at the Realm of Observation?"

The thought sent a shiver down his spine. Dealing with a practitioner of the "Replacing the Divine" technique, even at the Realm of Observation, was no easy feat. Ying Bing's growth would undoubtedly change the landscape of the Eastern Desolate Region.

As Luo Yu turned to leave, a sudden, ominous wind howled through the sky, casting a dark shadow over the land. The air was filled with an eerie, unsettling energy that seemed to be spreading from the Mud Corner Lane.

Meanwhile, at the dock, Li Mo gazed up at the sky, sensing the turbulent energy emanating from the Mud Corner Lane. "The internal landscape is clashing, and the impact is felt even here," he observed.

Ying Bing and Xiao Qin followed his gaze, their faces etched with concern. "There's an internal landscape conflict in the government city," Xiao Qin said.

"It's definitely Fine Rain Tower's internal landscape, and a Di Sha-level assassin is involved," Zuo Qiu Yang added.

Li Mo's eyes locked onto the direction of the Mud Corner Lane, and with a sudden burst of speed, he vanished into the wind, followed closely by Ying Bing.

As they arrived at the scene, they saw a middle-aged woman in a crimson robe, her sword radiating a brilliant light, clashing with a black-robed figure wearing a malevolent ghost mask. The air was filled with the cries of vengeful spirits, and the atmosphere was thick with tension.

The black-robed figure was using a dark, twisted technique, and his body seemed to be absorbing the sword energy. The woman, though superior in realm, was wounded and had to protect the children behind her, putting her at a disadvantage.

Li Mo and Ying Bing launched a joint attack, but the black-robed figure proved to be a formidable opponent, effortlessly deflecting their assault. Just as he was about to press his advantage, another black-robed figure wearing a judge's mask appeared, targeting Li Mo and Ying Bing.

"I want these two alive," the new arrival declared.

The judge-like figure charged forward, but Li Mo was prepared. With a flick of his wrist, he summoned the Star Chisel, a divine artifact. The judge's eyes widened in surprise, and he hesitated for a moment before continuing his attack.

However, Li Mo was not to be underestimated. With a mighty roar, he unleashed the Hammer's might, striking the black-robed figure and shattering his left hand.

The judge's expression turned cold, but before he could react, Li Mo smiled and said, "Oi, old chap, what's the big idea?"

A presence appeared behind the judge, and he felt a chill run down his spine. He realized too late that he had underestimated Li Mo and Ying Bing.
