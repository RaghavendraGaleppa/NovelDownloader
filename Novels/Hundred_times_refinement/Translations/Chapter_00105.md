# Chapter 55: Preaching at the Young Eagle Pavilion  

Lin Xuan arrived at the Young Eagle Pavilion. It had been a long time since he last attended a lecture by an instructor. Although he had already reached the late-stage Lingdong realm, listening to the insights of a Foundation Establishment elder could still help him avoid many pitfalls on his path of cultivation.  

Unlike before, Lin Xuan no longer chose a secluded corner but secured a good spot in the front row. With the green liquid refined from the Scarlet Vine Grass, he no longer had to worry about exposing his true cultivation level.  

"Eh? Isn’t this Junior Brother Lin? Long time no see!"  

A clear voice cut through the air and reached Lin Xuan’s ears. He frowned slightly. The owner of the voice was named Ye Tian, a disciple who had entered the valley at the same time as him.  

Ye Tian possessed extraordinary talent and a remarkable spiritual root, allowing his cultivation to progress rapidly. He was considered an elite disciple of the sect. However, his personality was acerbic and he took pleasure in bullying others. Over the years, Lin Xuan had endured no shortage of his taunts and mockery.  

A shadow of displeasure flickered across Lin Xuan’s face, but it vanished in the next instant. He sneered inwardly. In the past, his strength had been too weak, forcing him to endure humiliation. But now… if Ye Tian dared to provoke him again, he would make sure the man regretted it.  

*If others don’t offend me, I won’t offend them. But if they do, I’ll make sure they regret ever being born.*  

Lin Xuan wouldn’t actively seek trouble, but now that he had the strength, he wouldn’t swallow insults as he had before. If the situation called for it, he wouldn’t hesitate to act.  

"Junior Brother Lin, it’s been a while. How have you been?" To Lin Xuan’s surprise, Ye Tian didn’t mock him as usual. Instead, he acted warmly, even feigning concern.  

The sudden one-eighty in attitude caught even the composed Lin Xuan off guard. However, he maintained a detached expression on the surface and replied indifferently, "Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother. I’ve been well."  

With that, he turned to leave. Since Ye Tian hadn’t picked a fight, there was no need to teach him a lesson. But Lin Xuan also had no intention of getting entangled with him.  

"Why the hurry, Junior Brother?" Ye Tian called out again. "This elder brother still has something to say. The autumn air is crisp today, perfect weather. Would you like to join us for a barbecue in the back mountains?"  

"Barbecue?"  

Lin Xuan was taken aback. Although cultivators pursued the Heavenly Dao, they were still human, with all the accompanying desires. Even high-level cultivators who could abstain from food occasionally indulged their appetites.  

It was common for fellow disciples with good relationships to gather for hunting and barbecuing.  

But the world of cultivation was hierarchical. In the eyes of these fellow disciples, Lin Xuan was just an ordinary boy without a spiritual root, often subjected to discrimination. He had never been invited to such group activities before.  

Though he didn’t understand why Ye Tian’s attitude had suddenly changed, Lin Xuan knew that unsolicited kindness was never genuine. After a moment’s thought, he shook his head and declined politely, "Thank you for the invitation, Senior Brother, but I have matters to attend to today. Perhaps another time."  

A flash of disappointment crossed Ye Tian’s eyes, but he quickly resumed his amiable expression. "Alright, another time then."  

After bidding farewell, Ye Tian turned away, his face twisting into a sneer. *This brat doesn’t know what’s good for him. Fine, consider yourself lucky.* He quickly smoothed his expression and, spotting another target, approached a low-ranking disciple with a smile.  

Though Lin Xuan had already walked away, he observed everything coldly. Outwardly calm, he pondered internally: *What is Ye Tian plotting by cozying up to weaker disciples?*  

Though he didn’t know the specifics, it was undoubtedly malicious. However, Lin Xuan quickly dismissed the thought. Whether Ye Tian had schemes or tricks up his sleeve, it had nothing to do with him. He just needed to stay vigilant and keep his distance.  

As for whether others would suffer, Lin Xuan wasn’t noble enough to play the hero. Of course, if Ye Tian ever targeted him, Lin Xuan wouldn’t mind teaching him a harsh lesson.  

The deep toll of a bell echoed through the pavilion. The chattering disciples quickly fell silent and lined up, bowing respectfully to a yellow-robed instructor. "Master."  

The Foundation Establishment elder nodded, scanning the crowd indifferently. His gaze passed over Lin Xuan without pause as he began his lecture.  

---  

An hour later, Lin Xuan left the Young Eagle Pavilion. Today, the instructor hadn’t taught any new techniques but had instead shared cultivation insights. Lin Xuan listened with rapt attention, feeling as if a veil had been lifted. Over the past year, with the aid of pills and ten times the effort of his peers, he had advanced from the first layer of the Lingdong realm to the sixth.  

His progress had been swift, but he had overlooked many details in his cultivation method. While this hadn’t caused immediate problems, it could become a hidden danger as he progressed further.  

Coincidentally, today’s lecture addressed these very issues. The instructor’s insights resolved many of the difficulties Lin Xuan had encountered in his cultivation.  

Once he returned, he would correct the mistakes in his previous training based on today’s teachings, further strengthening his foundation.  

From now on, Lin Xuan would attend the Young Eagle Pavilion lectures regularly. With the green liquid from the Scarlet Vine Grass, he no longer feared his cultivation level being exposed, freeing him from worry.  

It was still early, and Lin Xuan wasn’t ready to return to the Waste Pill Room. After months of secluded cultivation, he deserved some rest.  

Leaving the Floating Cloud Valley, he climbed a nearby mountain peak, where the scenery was beautiful and perfect for relaxation.  

Lying on the grass, he had barely rested for half an hour when his expression shifted. He quickly rose and slipped into a nearby thicket—someone was approaching.  

Now a far cry from his former self, Lin Xuan’s enhanced spiritual sense allowed him to detect movements within hundreds of meters. It was Ye Tian, followed by several young disciples, all with mediocre cultivation levels.  

Lin Xuan hadn’t expected to encounter them here. He doubted they had come for a simple barbecue—there was surely some scheme afoot. While he had no intention of meddling, leaving now would alert them. So he stayed hidden, watching silently to see what would unfold.
