# Chapter 32: The Liu Family Treasure Vault  

The bird didn't seem to have a name—it looked utterly ordinary and somewhat foolish.  

When Zhang Yan used his spiritual energy to pull it over, the bird just tilted its head and stared at him blankly.  

"What a silly bird."  

Zhang Yan chuckled, then suddenly adopted a solemn expression. "But even a silly bird has its fortune. Today, I shall bestow upon you an opportunity!"  

With that, he pinched off a tiny fragment from the pill in his hand. Ignoring the bird's confused reaction, he stuffed it directly into its beak.  

The moment the pill entered its mouth, the bird began thrashing violently in Zhang Yan's grip, struggling with all its might.  

*Oh no, did I actually create poison by accident?*  

A wave of dread washed over him.  

*Good thing I tested it on a dumb bird first!*  

Watching the bird writhe and screech in his hand, Zhang Yan felt a pang of guilt. He considered putting it out of its misery right then and there.  

But just as he was about to act, he noticed something unusual.  

The bird's strength seemed to be increasing.  

"Hmm?"  

"It's not dying?"  

Though the bird continued to screech, its energy showed no signs of waning.  

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yan tied a string around its leg and set it aside to observe.  

*Maybe it's just a temporary reaction. I should wait and see.*  

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the bird's vigor only seemed to grow stronger. At that point, Zhang Yan was convinced—the pill had worked.  

"Excellent, excellent."  

He untied the string and released the bird, expecting it to fly away. After all, even a silly bird's life mattered.  

Now that he no longer needed a test subject, he could afford to be magnanimous.  

But to his surprise, the bird didn’t leave. Instead, it perched itself on his shoulder.  

Zhang Yan was taken aback.  

"What, you’re sticking with me now?"  

His expression darkened slightly.  

But after a moment's consideration, he realized having a dedicated test subject wasn’t such a bad idea.  

*Convenient!*  

From now on, he wouldn’t need to find another creature for experiments.  

With that thought, his gaze toward the bird softened considerably.  

With the bird’s successful trial as proof, Zhang Yan felt confident enough to consume the pill himself. He sat cross-legged on his meditation cushion and placed the slightly chipped pill into his mouth.  

The moment it touched his tongue, the pill dissolved, transforming into a surge of pure spiritual energy that coursed through his meridians.

The Liu family’s spirit herb garden was completed in a surprisingly short time.  

A few days later, Zhang Yan received word and went to oversee its final arrangements. He helped organize the layout—which herbs should be planted where, what conditions each required, and other essential details.  

Seeing how Zhang Yan had transformed their once-chaotic garden into an orderly and efficient space, Liu Changfeng was thoroughly impressed.  

The Liu family had always dabbled in alchemy and harbored ambitions of mastering herb cultivation.  

But in the Tianmu Mountain Range, every family with a specialized craft guarded their knowledge as fiercely as life itself. After all, possessing a unique skill ensured a family’s survival and prosperity—it was a legacy to be passed down through generations.  

Thus, the Liu family had been forced to learn through trial and error.  

It was only after forging a connection with the Qingheng Sect through their alchemy that they finally gained access to proper guidance from the sect’s herb cultivators.  

"My task is complete," Zhang Yan said, clasping his hands in salute to Liu Changfeng.  

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Zhang!" Liu Changfeng beamed as he surveyed the newly organized garden.  

Not only had their cultivation space become far more efficient, but Liu Yiting and a few others had also gained valuable insights. While they were still far from becoming true herb cultivators, decades of further study might change that.  

At the very least, the family had taken a crucial step forward.  

"Just fulfilling my duty," Zhang Yan replied with a modest nod, though his tone carried an unspoken expectation.  

Liu Changfeng immediately understood.  

"As promised, I shall grant you access to the Liu family’s treasure vault. You may select one item of your choosing."  

A flicker of hesitation passed through Liu Changfeng’s eyes, but he quickly masked it.  

"Excellent. My gratitude, Clan Leader Liu."  

This time, Zhang Yan’s smile was genuine.  

Without further delay, Liu Changfeng led him to the family’s treasure repository.  

With a series of hand seals, they entered a hidden chamber filled with neatly stacked spirit stones, carefully preserved pills in ornate boxes, and an assortment of magical artifacts.  

A single glance told Zhang Yan the truth—this was not the Liu family’s true treasure vault.  

The items here, while numerous, were neither rare nor particularly valuable by the standards of a prominent family.  

*No wonder he was so willing to let me pick anything.*  

Still, free loot was free loot. And though the selection wasn’t exceptional, a few items did catch his eye.  

"Feel free to take your time, Fellow Daoist Zhang," Liu Changfeng said, gesturing expansively.  

"Many thanks, Senior Liu."  

Zhang Yan bowed slightly before beginning his inspection.  

Most of the vault’s contents consisted of refined medicinal herbs—products of the Liu family’s alchemical expertise. He even spotted a top-grade first-tier spirit herb, which could fetch hundreds of spirit stones if sold.  

But Zhang Yan had little use for herbs. He wasn’t lacking in that department, so he moved on without a second glance.  

Next, he examined the collection of magical artifacts.  

A single glance made him frown.  

The quality was abysmal—mostly low-tier artifacts with mediocre enchantments, far inferior to what the Qingheng Sect could offer.  

But this was to be expected.  

In the Tianmu Mountain Range, the Qingheng Sect reigned supreme, monopolizing the best resources while exploiting the smaller families and rogue cultivators.  

For minor clans like the Lius, obtaining decent artifacts was a struggle—not just due to cost, but sheer scarcity.  

Zhang Yan shook his head and continued deeper into the vault.  

The innermost section housed jade slips containing cultivation techniques and spells.  

A quick scan revealed nothing of interest. The Liu family’s collection was underwhelming at best.  

*If nothing else, I might as well take that refined top-grade herb. At least I can sell it for some spirit stones.*  

Just as he turned to leave, however, his gaze snagged on an unassuming bamboo-like rod resting on a shelf.  

*This thing…*  

*Why is it just sitting here?*  

The rod itself was plain, but the inscriptions on it—  

They were absolutely extraordinary.  

In fact, they were downright *unbelievable.*
