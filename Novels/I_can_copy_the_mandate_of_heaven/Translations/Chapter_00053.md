## Chapter 53: Saving a Life

Deep within a bamboo forest, Li Zhi Ming began his martial arts practice. He had acquired a variety of skills, mostly copied from Da Niu, such as "Occupy the Land Step" and "Burst Extreme Hand" from the "Broken" character hall, as well as "Magic Silver Hand" and "困龙功" passed down from his master. Among these, the latter two were his most reliable skills.

However, no matter how powerful a martial art was, it ultimately required the practitioner's physical strength to support it. As the saying goes, "when one's vital energy is vigorous, one can overcome ten opponents with one move; when one's vital energy declines, one becomes old and is bullied by others." Li Zhi Ming currently had weak vital energy.

At twelve years old, he was as thin as a noodle. Nevertheless, the top-tier "Magic Silver Hand" with forty years of strength was not to be underestimated. Among ordinary seventh-ranked disciples of the Qi Xuan Gate, Li Zhi Ming could already stand out.

However, any ordinary master of a hall could defeat him within ten rounds. Despite his young age, Li Zhi Ming's potential was evident. As he grew, his abilities would become increasingly formidable. The path to becoming an invincible, top-tier martial artist in the world, as envisioned by his master, seemed achievable.

Taking a deep breath, Li Zhi Ming started practicing his "Magic Silver Hand." The hidden meridians in his arms began to open, and his palms rapidly swelled, resembling those of Mo Da Yi, the doctor he had seen earlier. His hands became as hard as silver, impenetrable.

"Hmmph!" Li Zhi Ming shouted, striking forward with a palm. The "Qing Gang Zhu" in front of him, a type of extremely hard bamboo, shattered instantly, turning into layers of flying ash.

The "Qing Gang Zhu" was a rare product of the Qi Xuan Gate, known for its hardness surpassing steel. A grown man could, at most, leave a white mark on it after a day of chopping. Li Zhi Ming's palm, however, could reduce it to ashes.

Li Zhi Ming was surprised by the destruction he had caused. He shook his head, observing the chaos around him. His companion, Pao Pao, was still running about, covered in bamboo leaves, holding a seemingly dead bamboo rat in his mouth.

After practicing for a while, Li Zhi Ming stopped and headed back home. As they approached the halfway point up the mountain, a fellow disciple from the Feng Zi Tang came running towards him, effortlessly covering the thousand-meter distance in just a few minutes.

The disciple bowed respectfully to Li Zhi Ming. "The Medicine Valley has a severely injured patient. Could Master Li Zhi Ming please accompany me down the mountain to help?"

Li Zhi Ming followed the disciple down the mountain. Along the way, the disciple was surprised to find that Li Zhi Ming kept pace with him without slowing down.

Upon arriving at the Medicine Valley, Li Zhi Ming saw several people preparing hot water, towels, gauze, and medicine boxes. As he approached, the crowd parted, and someone called out, "Let through! Master Li Zhi Ming is here!"

Li Zhi Ming examined the patient and was taken aback. A long cut across the abdomen had turned black and was festering, clearly poisoned. The patient's complexion was ashen, and his eyes had turned purple.

Without listening to the others, Li Zhi Ming quickly knelt down, took silver needles from Jiang Yun, and began to treat the wound. He swiftly stopped the bleeding, then proceeded to detoxify, replenish blood, and suture the wound. The onlookers were amazed by his skillful and mature actions.

Thirty minutes later, Li Zhi Ming finished the treatment. He washed his hands and calmly said, "The patient's life is saved, but he needs to stay here for observation."

The crowd erupted in gratitude. Someone offered Li Zhi Ming a substantial amount of silver, but he directly declined. "I receive a stipend from the Qi Xuan Gate for treating patients here. I won't accept anything else."

The patient was then taken care of, and the others dispersed. For Li Zhi Ming, this was not a significant event, especially during a period of relative peace between the Qi Xuan Gate and the Hai Sha Bang. Patients rarely came to him, and if a large-scale conflict were to break out, people would not necessarily come to him for treatment. Many other doctors and medical practitioners under the Qi Xuan Gate could handle simple treatments.

No one, however, had the extraordinary abilities like Mo Da Yi.
