# Chapter 418: Divine Treasure Hundred-Forging, Slightly Leaning Towards Lewdness (1/2)

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Xue Houzai, preventing his death in the Yunmeng Underground Palace.】

【Investment Feedback: Three hundred catties of cold iron ore.】

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Zhao Qin, preventing her death in the Yunmeng Underground Palace.】

【Investment Feedback: A set of red jade mahjong tiles.】

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Zhao Fuming...】

Inside the room, Li Mo crossed his arms and finished reviewing the feedback from investments of the Blue grade and below. He then began sorting them into batches within his System Space.

He possessed a strange passive skill.

For instance, if he clearly remembered placing something in a certain spot, it would inexplicably vanish, forcing him to call for his mother. Then, Gu Xueqin would say, "You're dead if I find it," while somehow producing the item from an unknown location...

It was truly strange.

Unfortunately, his mother couldn't help him organize the System Space.

The investment feedback was piling up more and more. If this continued, Little Li would end up wealthy without even realizing it.

Gold and silver treasures... Well, another mountain of gold had been added. His current cash flow was probably equivalent to ten times that of the Hengtong Branch in Yunzhou.

Various pills... The quantity of pills was still manageable (compared to his money), but the quality was high.

He could now fill the Pill Pavilion on Mount Dinding with Six-Pattern and Seven-Pattern pills.

There were also spiritual herbs and treasures, various minerals, and rare curios...

Little Li the tycoon might be a bit arrogant to claim he was as wealthy as a nation now.

But if the leaders of all the sects in a region held a meeting, he could stand up and say that everyone present combined was still trash, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration.

"My money... it just keeps growing no matter how much I spend."

Li Mo sighed softly, bearing the burden of boredom that someone his age shouldn't have to endure.

He pulled out a map and began marking it seriously.

Some villages and towns that worshipped the Heavenly Venerable and Immortals were still backward and poor, lacking various supplies. He marked everything he could remember one by one.

After marking them, he had to find time to distribute the supplies.

"Doing all this alone is truly not an easy task."

Half an hour later, Li Mo stretched and continued to check his rewards.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Bai Jinghong, preventing his death in the Yunmeng Underground Palace.】

【Investment Feedback:屠蛟剑术 (Slaying Flood Dragon Sword Art).】

【Slaying Flood Dragon Sword Art】: "The swordsman Lu Wuchong observed the surging tides, like a flood dragon lurking beneath the water (there was indeed a roaring flood dragon at the time), and thus comprehended this sword art at the Divine Perception Realm. Later, relying on this sword art, he gained the allegiance of a Swordfish Great Demon. This sword technique is top-tier even among high-grade martial arts."

"I, the Peerless Heavenly Flood Dragon, don't seem to be the type to learn this."

"It would be more suitable if it were called Slaying Dragon Sword Art."

Little Li the Heavenly Flood Dragon shook his head, expressing his unwillingness to learn this sword technique.

It was entirely because he had also been a Roaring Flood Dragon for a period of time, and had nothing to do with his sword talent.

It could be given to Little Princess Jiang to learn.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in Wu Chushu, preventing the loss of his cultivation base.】

【Investment Feedback: Ancient Heavenly Book Seal of Ancient Bronze.】

"Hm?"

Li Mo thought, that's right, he had the Heavenly Book Seal.

He simply took out the Heavenly Book Seal and stamped it onto the [Slaying Flood Dragon Sword Art].

Tadpole patterns flowed into the martial arts manual. The original high-grade martial art became a Transcendent Art, and its name changed along with its content:

【Dragon Slaying Sword Art】

It was not only a Transcendent Art, but also a top-tier one among Transcendent Arts.

"Little Princess Jiang was already not far from defeating that Red Dragon."

"By learning this sword art, she will surely be able to slay the Red Dragon, and even..."

Li Mo recalled the Divine Will of a certain Great Yu Crown Prince, surrounded by golden dragons.

If he had the chance, he naturally wanted to beat Jiang Yu into the ground.

But he wanted to see Chulong take back what she had lost with her own hands even more.

That day wouldn't be too far off.

He had seen about enough of the Purple Fate. Among them were a few Upper Form Diagrams.

After upgrading them with the Mithril Creation Seal...

"Evil Creature, I need you to assist my cultivation!"

Li Mo's expression turned serious as he opened the most fragrant reward, the Ice Cube's gift.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Ying Bing', helping her obtain half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain.】

【Investment Feedback: Divine Treasure Hundred-Forging】

---

【Divine Treasure Hundred-Forging】: "A forging method of the Divine Art level, capable of forging Divine Weapons at its peak. Its greatest divine effect, however, is the tempering of the physique during the forging process."

"Concentrate on one point, forge a god through a hundred refinements!"

"Forging technique?"

Li Mo thought, his conditions did seem quite suitable for becoming a craftsman, though he had never considered developing in this direction before.

But what made the [Divine Treasure Hundred-Forging] truly catch his eye was the additional effect.

Tempering the physique.

The progress of [Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body] had already slowed to the point where it was invisible to the naked eye, and the Consummate Realm was far out of reach.

As is well known, the body is the foundation of revolution.

Whether it is the Heaven-Equal Battle Intent or the Great Sage's Divine Ability, the physical body is of utmost importance.

Perhaps by using this method... he could reach another level!

*Hum—*

In the Little World, the Hammer Treasure hummed.

To feel a sense of grievance from a hammer... it was truly a nightmare.

"Hammer Treasure, you don't want to forge?"

*Hum hum...*

Not happy.

"If you accompany me in forging for a few days, I'll find you a playmate, how about that?"

Little Li student earnestly coaxed, painting a vision for the Hammer Treasure.

It wasn't entirely a lie. He remembered that the Ice Cube's other sword seemed to emit the aura of a Divine Weapon...

Hammer Treasure: "(~.~)"

Is it true or false?

"When have I ever lied to you? Isn't your master an honest gentleman?"

"I'll definitely find you a good friend, and a very beautiful one at that."

Li Mo didn't know if weapons had aesthetics.

But he felt that sword must be a beauty among swords.

In the end, the Hammer Treasure reluctantly lost its resistance.

Li Mo sighed in relief, while feeling a bit of guilt.

Although the Ice Cube was occasionally naughty, most of the time, she was a quiet and serene Frost Immortal. Now, after her little feet and little hands, he was even eyeing her personal sword.

Truly unworthy of being a gentleman!

Daring to covet her sword today, what would he dare to covet tomorrow?

He didn't dare to think about it!

Because it leaned slightly towards lewdness...

Little Li the Gentleman didn't want to think about it, but his mind would involuntarily picture the Ice Cube curling her slender fingers, her eyelashes trembling, her beautiful eyes closing in shy annoyance, and whispering "don't"...

"Keke... *cough*!"

Li Mo, Li Mo, how could you sink so low!

It must be the lingering influence of the Roaring Flood Dragon bloodline!

He silently entered the Little World.

Little Li student was now boiling with热血 (hot blood).

Eager to find his sparring partners to vent.

...

As dusk approached, Ying Bing withdrew her thoughts from the Heavenly Phoenix Domain. She had yet to fully condense the Hundred Birds Phoenix Form, and there was no great benefit to contacting the Heavenly Phoenix Domain further, especially since it was incomplete.

She walked down the stairs and saw Qin Yuzhi writing something at the tea table in the courtyard.

"You're here?"

"Writing a resume, what of it?"

Qin Yuzhi looked up, her gaze momentarily stunned.

The more carefully she looked, the more she felt Ying Bing was breathtakingly stunning.

Moreover, Ying Bing was standing, looking down from above. Her cold, detached, and fleeting glance brought a sense of pressure in an instant.

No one would have thought that a Divine Perception Realm could exert such pressure on a Profound Realm expert...

No wonder she was favored by that person...

"I have a question I'd like to ask."

"Please, go ahead..."

"How can I avoid the influence of other consciousnesses and remain clear-headed?"
