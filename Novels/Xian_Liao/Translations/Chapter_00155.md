# Chapter 155: Gathering Storm - The Fierce Might of the Sun Rooster Deity  

Under Bai Yue's command, a great demon of the White Moon Wolf Clan at the early Core Formation stage approached the Demon-Binding Pillar.  

"Hong Yue, pays respects to the Ancestor."  

"Hmm." The old monster Xiao Yue nodded, then suddenly spat out a ghostly green flame. The Core Formation-stage demon Hong Yue let out a piercing shriek as his eyes glowed with an eerie green light.  

"Hong Yue" stretched his limbs, as if adjusting to his new body.  

Bai Yue felt a chill in his heart but still asked respectfully, "Ancestor, how is it?"  

"After years of blood sacrifices, my Heavenly Demon Soul Condensation Art is finally complete. Though Hong Yue's bloodline isn't pure enough, it allows me to channel thirty percent of my power into his body and control it. However, this means my escape will be delayed by another ten years. If you all weren't so terrified of Tian Xuan, I wouldn't have resorted to this."  

Hong Yue was a Core Formation-stage demon, a pillar of the White Moon Wolf Clan. After being possessed by the old monster Xiao Yue through the Heavenly Demon Soul Condensation Art, even if control were returned to him later, Hong Yue would forever lose any hope of further advancement.  

It was only in recent decades that the old monster Xiao Yue, despite being suppressed by the Demon-Binding Pillar, had managed to act. If the Greedy Wolf Saint hadn't fallen into Zhou Qing's hands back then, even if Xiao Yue couldn't escape now, he could have used the Greedy Wolf Saint's far purer Xiao Yue bloodline to elevate his Heavenly Demon True Body's power to the late Core Formation stage—effectively gaining a late Core Formation clone.  

All of this had failed because of Zhou Qing's interference.  

Thus, in the following years, Xiao Yue devised the blood sacrifice method to hasten his escape and cultivated the Heavenly Demon Soul Condensation Art to refine a stronger soul fragment, allowing him to possess Hong Yue.  

Splitting off this soul fragment weakened his main body, further delaying his escape.  

The soul fragment Xiao Yue had placed in the Greedy Wolf Saint had been extremely weak, as the Saint hadn't yet reached Core Formation at the time. Even the first level of the Heavenly Demon True Body had been forcibly achieved through Xiao Yue's intervention.  

Ghostly green flames surged around "Hong Yue," accompanied by terrifying bloodlight and eerie wolf bristles. His body transformed into that of a handsome youth, resembling the Greedy Wolf Saint but with far more sinister features—complete with the White Moon Wolf Clan's signature wolf ears in human form.  

His aura also broke through from early Core Formation to late Core Formation.  

"Let's go. If Tian Xuan appears, I'll handle him," the youth said coldly.  

Xiao Yue sensed an overwhelming crisis. If the human race's longevity elixir was successfully refined, even if he escaped, he would face dire consequences. Thus, he had no choice but to split his soul, weaken his main body, and delay his escape—all to stop or seize the humans' longevity elixir.
