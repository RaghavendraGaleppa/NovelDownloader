# Chapter 32: Cultivation Speed Skyrockets

"Huff!"

After working busily for an entire afternoon, Chen Daoxuan felt a surge of satisfaction looking at the neatly stacked, courtyard-filling pile of bluestone bricks.

He turned to face Chen Beiwang, who was standing nearby, and asked, "Are there enough bricks now to build the workshop?"

"Enough, enough! Absolutely enough!"

Chen Beiwang nodded woodenly.

"Then, I require you, Zuo Cao, to construct the workshop within a month. Can you complete this task?"

"Yes!"

Chen Beiwang glanced at Chen Daoxuan, afraid the latter wouldn't believe him, and emphasized, "Definitely can!"

"Good."

Chen Daoxuan nodded in satisfaction and immediately used the Wind Control Art, soaring away in front of everyone.

Before leaving, his voice echoed in Chen Beiwang's ears, "Don't forget about mapping Shuanghu Island."

"Yes, Young Clan Leader!"

Chen Beiwang bowed deeply.

An incense stick's time later.

Chen Daoxuan, riding the wind, returned to his cave dwelling on the Red Copper Mountain Range.

Having been away in Guang'an Prefecture for over two months, the cave dwelling was still spotless.

He knew this was the result of the clan sending people to clean it daily.

Walking into the cave dwelling's cultivation room.

After carefully inspecting the spirit eye, he breathed a sigh of relief upon finding it intact and showing no signs of spiritual energy depletion.

As dusk gradually descended.

The mountain nights were icy cold, but Chen Daoxuan remained oblivious.

He sat cross-legged on a prayer mat with unwavering focus.

In front of him were a brocade box and a jade bottle, the two treasures he had obtained from Guang'an Prefecture to aid in cultivation: the Water Spirit Pearl and the Qi Gathering Pill.

"According to records in the clan's ancient texts, the Qi Gathering Pill can help cultivators increase their efficiency in refining spiritual energy by two times, allowing cultivators with superior spiritual roots to cultivate as fast as those with heavenly spiritual roots within a single month."

"I wonder if it's true!"

Chen Daoxuan gently played with the jade bottle in his hand before placing it in front of him.

He then opened the brocade box, revealing a Water Spirit Pearl the size of a marble, radiating vibrant vitality.

"The Water Spirit Pearl can purify spiritual energy, thereby allowing cultivators to increase the speed at which they refine it. What's even rarer is that, unlike pills, the Water Spirit Pearl doesn't produce pill toxins and can continuously aid in cultivation."

Chen Daoxuan glanced at the Water Spirit Pearl, then at the jade bottle containing the Qi Gathering Pill, and took a deep breath, "I wonder to what extent my cultivation speed will increase if I use both of these cultivation aids simultaneously."

After pondering for a moment.

Chen Daoxuan opened the jade bottle, poured out a Qi Gathering Pill, and swallowed it.

At the same time, he opened the brocade box, guiding the Water Spirit Pearl within to absorb the spiritual energy emanating from the spirit eye. Subsequently, an even purer stream of spiritual energy was fed back by the Water Spirit Pearl.

Seeing this.

Chen Daoxuan didn't dare waste the pure spiritual energy before him and immediately activated the *Returning Origin Sutra*, absorbing the pure spiritual energy emitted by the Water Spirit Pearl.

As this pure spiritual energy entered Chen Daoxuan's body.

Instantly, every cell in his body cheered with joy.

The spiritual energy first entered the human meridians from the Heavenly Spirit Baihui point, then circulated through the entire body, slowly refining the spiritual energy, converting it into true qi, and storing it in the dantian.

Chen Daoxuan had been performing these steps of refining spiritual energy for over five years.

Chen Daoxuan was confident that even without conscious control, he could refine spiritual energy instinctively.

But today, Chen Daoxuan felt different.

The speed of cultivation was simply too fast!

If Chen Daoxuan's usual speed of refining spiritual energy was one point, then today's speed was a full five points!

He wasn't exaggerating at all; the speed was just that fast.

To the point where he faintly felt that the spiritual energy provided by the spirit eye was becoming somewhat insufficient.

"How can it be so fast?"

After circulating the energy for one great cycle, Chen Daoxuan opened his eyes, his face filled with shock, "No wonder cultivators are so eager for spiritual pills, and value pills even more than magical artifacts.

If I were them, I would choose the same!"

It wasn't his fault for being shocked; the speed of cultivation was simply too fast.

Compared to before, the results of his cultivation in just these two hours were equivalent to two or three days of hard cultivation in the past. The speed of cultivation had increased by more than four or five times.

Which cultivator in the world could resist such temptation?

Thinking of this, Chen Daoxuan didn't dare waste any time and continued to close his eyes and refine spiritual energy.

The next day.

After feeling a faint ache in his meridians, Chen Daoxuan ended his day of cultivation.

"I actually cultivated for an hour longer than usual last night."

After opening his eyes, Chen Daoxuan calculated the time with his fingers and muttered to himself.

It should be known that for cultivators, it's not that the more time spent cultivating without eating, drinking, or sleeping, the better.

For cultivators, the amount of time spent cultivating each day should be appropriate.

The so-called appropriate amount of cultivation time depends on the constitution of different cultivators.

For example, for Chen Daoxuan, the best time for him to cultivate each day was about four hours, or eight hours.

Roughly equivalent to the time a mortal sleeps at night.

Therefore, Chen Daoxuan usually chose to cultivate at night.

Exceeding this time, there might not be any problems in the short term, but over time, it would cause irreversible damage to the cultivator's physical meridians, causing the path to be covered in dust.

And last night.

Chen Daoxuan had obviously exceeded the normal cultivation time.

However, the reason why this happened was because he was too engrossed in cultivation last night, to the point where he ignored the cultivation time.

Of course.

Such engrossed cultivation also yielded gratifying results.

Chen Daoxuan discovered that, at this rate of cultivation, he would be confident in breaking through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement in at most half a year.

After his cultivation broke through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement, Chen Daoxuan's strength would probably have another qualitative leap.

At least when he controlled the Flying Snow Sword, he wouldn't be like in the early stages of Qi Refinement, where he could only use a few swords before his true qi was exhausted, leaving him at the mercy of others.

He estimated that after breaking through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement.

Thanks to the strengthening of true qi and the surge in divine sense, he would be able to kill at least ten or more enemies before exhausting his true qi.

When people are happy, they are in high spirits.

Chen Daoxuan's cultivation was smooth, and his path was clear, so the smile on his face naturally increased.

Half an incense stick's time later.

When Chen Daoxuan flew to the family's old earth fire room using the Wind Control Art, he found a group of sixteen or seventeen-year-old teenagers waiting on the jade plaza of the earth fire room.

Seeing this group of teenagers the same age as him.

Chen Daoxuan smiled and looked at Chen Liangyu, saying, "Sorry, I kept you waiting."

Hearing this apology, Chen Liangyu immediately had a flattered expression, saying, "Young Clan Leader, why do you say that? We should have arrived earlier than the agreed time."

Chen Daoxuan didn't intend to argue with him about this topic, and changed the subject, saying, "Are these the apprentices you found?"

"Reporting to Young Clan Leader, yes."

Chen Liangyu bowed, "These young men are literate and very clever, and should be able to serve under Young Clan Leader."

Although Chen Liangyu didn't know what Chen Daoxuan intended to do by gathering these teenagers.

But he knew that the time for him, Chen Liangyu, to turn his luck around had arrived!
