# Chapter 27: Is Being Too Handsome and Dashing a Flaw?

Meanwhile, Dong Xuan'er had found Hong Fu.

Upon learning that Dong Xuan'er had arrived at Yellow Maple Valley, Hong Fu had specially interrupted her seclusion to meet her.

Though Hong Fu had mentally prepared herself beforehand, her expression still turned complicated when she saw Dong Xuan'er again.

Dong Xuan'er, however, enthusiastically grabbed Hong Fu's arm.

"Master~! Master~! You're the best to Xuan'er! Can you do me a favor?" Dong Xuan'er cooed while shaking Hong Fu's arm.

"What is it?" Hong Fu's tense expression softened, replaced by a gentle, almost doting look.

"Master~! Master~! Could you take Big Brother Lin as your disciple too?" Dong Xuan'er pleaded with hopeful eyes.

"Lin Yun?" At the mention of this name, all warmth vanished from Hong Fu's face. She asked expressionlessly, "That talisman-making genius?"

Dong Xuan'er was surprised Hong Fu had heard of Lin Yun's reputation and immediately grew excited.

"Yes! Master! That's Big Brother Lin!"

"Master~! Master~! My dear master, please take Big Brother Lin as your disciple!"

"Why?" Hong Fu's voice gradually lost emotion, turning icy.

"Because then he'd be my senior brother, and I'd be his junior sister. We'd be a match made in..." Dong Xuan'er grew shy, lowering her head and unable to finish her sentence.

Too excited to notice Hong Fu's displeasure, she continued obliviously.

"Xuan'er! You should focus on your cultivation! Not waste your thoughts on some man!"

"But Big Brother Lin is exceptional!" Seeing Hong Fu's displeasure, Dong Xuan'er didn't understand and immediately defended Lin Yun. "Not only is he a talisman-making genius, but he's also generous, kind-hearted, and thoughtful—a rare good match in this world! If I don't seize this chance, someone else will take him!"

"Look, this Spring Transformation Fan was his gift to me. It's a top-grade supreme magic tool worth nearly two thousand spirit stones on the market—comparable to the Wind Thunder Fan! Even such a treasure, Senior Brother Lin was willing to give me!"

"Xuan'er! Have you ever wondered why a man would carry such a fan?" Seeing the pink Spring Transformation Fan, Hong Fu was furious. What decent man would carry such a thing? Only... Hong Fu recalled unpleasant memories, her face darkening like storm clouds.

"Xuan'er, from now on, you are forbidden from contacting that Lin Yun!" Hong Fu declared sternly. "That fellow is clearly no good!"

"How can you say that about Big Brother Lin? And how can you even tell he's no good?" Dong Xuan'er retorted defiantly.

"His handsome and dashing looks alone prove he's no good!" Hong Fu said with absolute conviction.

"Wha—Being handsome and dashing is a flaw?!" Dong Xuan'er was stunned, unable to comprehend her master's logic.

"Regardless, you two cannot meet! And I'm confiscating this Spring Transformation Fan! Later, I'll find you another top-grade supreme magic tool to replace it!" With a flick of her wrist, Hong Fu snatched the fan from Dong Xuan'er's hands.

"What are you doing?! How dare you take my things! Give it back!" Dong Xuan'er's spoiled temper flared as she tried to grab it back.

"Xuan'er! You're being insolent!" Hong Fu's anger erupted, releasing a terrifying pressure that immobilized Dong Xuan'er.

Realizing her mistake, Dong Xuan'er finally understood—the person before her wasn't just anyone but Hong Fu, her pillar of support. Cowed, she could only nod meekly and submit.

Seeing Dong Xuan'er yield, Hong Fu nodded in satisfaction, believing her disciple would understand her good intentions.

But she didn't know that some people only grow more rebellious when forbidden—and Dong Xuan'er was exactly that type.

Moreover, if she obeyed her master, what if Hong Fu later paired her with some plain-looking fellow like Han Li? Her life would be ruined!

She, Dong Xuan'er, would never accept that!

Big Brother Lin, come save me!

As the morning sun rose high, Lin Yun glanced at Chen Qiaoqian, still fast asleep on the bed. Lifting the covers, he inspected his waist. "You've worked hard."

Then he looked down and smirked. "Luckily, I'm gifted—blessed with the Dragon's Den!"

"System, open my status panel," Lin Yun commanded mentally.

[Hei Mu, Hei Jin.]

Lin Yun examined his panel—nothing had changed much. With a flick of his wrist, a manual appeared in his hand: the Dual Cultivation Art obtained from Xuan'er.

"Yin-Yang Sunflower Art... This name sounds suspiciously like the technique that Old Devil Yunlu practices." Lin Yun frowned. Truthfully, he hadn't had time to study it properly since acquiring it. He'd been... preoccupied.

Channeling his spiritual sense into the jade slip, the first line read: [To master this art, first sever the root. Balance yin and yang, harmonize inside and out.]

"Damn—" 

Lin Yun's hand trembled at the familiar warning.

However, beneath the bold text was a smaller note: [For those with both yin and yang constitutions, coexisting as male and female, balance is innate—no severance needed.]

After skimming the manual, Lin Yun understood its core: the Yin-Yang Sunflower Art focused on dual cultivation, absorbing yin energy from women and yang energy from men to balance internal and external forces.

"I'd rather die than practice this! I refuse to 'advance while facing men'!"

"I, Lin Yun, would sooner starve to death than cultivate this technique!"

Never had Lin Yun's resolve been firmer.

He tossed the manual into his system storage. Though he wouldn't practice it, one section on balancing yin and yang might prove useful later.

After putting it away, Lin Yun sighed at his status panel. "I'm so poor!"

"My inventory looks impressive, but what's actually usable is pitiful."

"Just over a thousand talismans, eighty-seven Heavenly Thunder Beads, three talisman treasures, and a few top-grade defensive tools."

"Now that I'm in Yellow Maple Valley, I need to plan my next moves."

"I must find a way to extract resources from the valley's ten thousand Qi Refinement disciples and hundreds of Foundation Establishment disciples."

Lin Yun pondered. "Even if I only get a hundred spirit stones from each, that's still a million in total!"
