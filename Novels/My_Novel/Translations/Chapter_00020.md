# Chapter 20: The World Remains the Same, A Return to the Servants' Quarters

With Pang Long’s guidance, Li Xian finally caught a glimpse of the truth.

The initial realm of martial arts: Mud Body.
The first realm of martial arts: Consuming Essence.

“In that case, every martial art is incredibly precious. It can accumulate internal strength and martial insights... all sorts of things, building up enough capital for the future transformation of one’s body!”

Where does internal strength come from?

Ordinary running and physical training do not generate internal strength. It is cultivated by practicing different martial arts, allowing a force to naturally grow within the body.

“The harder you work, the more you gain... In that case, there is no breathing technique in the world, only high-level martial arts!”

Li Xian sensed his own body. A warm current flowed in his lower abdomen, which had grown larger than a fist already.

Part of the internal energy came from practicing the “Mangled Ox Fist.” Because the Mangled Ox Fist was incomplete, this part of the internal energy was very limited. The other part came from the “Four Directions Fist.”

Although the Four Directions Fist was very basic, its movements were complete. After Li Xian became familiar with it, he executed the punches as smoothly as flowing water and flowing clouds, indescribably顺畅.

His progress was not slow at all.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 658/1000 Proficient]

At this speed, reaching “Small Success” was not far off.

There was a row of duty rosters in the Patrol Duty Room.

How the hundreds of guards patrolled was all recorded and arranged in the table.

Li Xian had become a formal guard, so he had less time to practice martial arts. Every day, only two hours in the morning were free for practice.

The rest of the time was assigned to patrol duty, requiring him to patrol the manor.

Sometimes, if luck was bad and he was assigned many shifts, he couldn't even sleep in the middle of the night.

“Indeed... guards are ultimately servants, though much better than the likes of common servants. They are still servants.”

Li Xian’s patrol duty today was full, or rather, it was almost full every day.

The Mao and Chen hours in the morning were for martial arts practice. Patrol duty started from the Si hour. He could take a short fifteen-minute break at the Wu hour. Then, during the Wei, Shen, and You hours, he had to patrol various locations.

He could rest for an hour during the Xu hour to eat dinner. But he had to patrol again during the Hai and Chou hours.

Tomorrow would be slightly better; he didn't have to patrol during the Chou hour, so he could get a decent night's sleep.

“Total of three hours of rest, two hours of martial arts practice. All other time is spent doing various tasks.”

“But it is much better than being a servant.”

Common servants rose at the fifth watch (around 3-5 AM), while the guards were still snoring in their beds. Moreover, the treatment was worlds apart regarding food and lodging.

“If I can become a C-rank guard, the patrol time will be greatly reduced.”

Li Xian saw in the duty roster that the higher the guard's rank, the more free time they had. “A-rank guards” even patrolled only once every few days.

After领取 (receiving) the guard token and equipping a waist knife, Li Xian went on patrol.

He patrolled the east side of the manor in the morning. This area was one Li Xian had never been to before. It was lush with green plants and had a beautiful scenery.

“This is...”

Li Xian suddenly stopped. He saw a large tree split right down the middle. The stump was incredibly thick; it would take seven or eight people to link hands to barely encircle it.

Yet such a massive tree had been split in two with a single blow, and the cut was smooth without any extra sword or knife marks.

Obviously, it was done in one strike!

“What terrifying power!”

Even with the advanced technology of his previous life, relying on technology, one couldn't make such a smooth cut.

Li Xian couldn't help but move closer to observe, only to find it even more shocking. This kind of tree had very vigorous vitality. Even if it was broken in the middle, its life force should still be present.

It would grow new branches next year. But this stump did not sprout any branches, as if its “head” had been chopped off.

Its vitality had been completely severed.

“With such strength, what realm has this martial artist reached?”

“Could it be that Lady did this?”

Li Xian dared not observe further and honestly followed his patrol route.

“Who!”

Li Xian’s ears twitched slightly. Ever since he mastered the “Four Directions Fist” and acquired its trait “Hearing in All Directions,” his hearing had far surpassed others.

He heard a slight movement in the grass in the distance. His eyes turned cold, and he slowly approached.

He used his waist knife to push aside the weeds and saw a small beggar, stripped to the waist, wearing tattered pants, cowering in the corner in fear.

It was already winter. Frost and snow hadn't fallen yet, but the temperature was getting colder.

The beggar looked at Li Xian, eyes filled with despair. He covered his mouth tightly to keep from making a sound, but he was already crying from fright.

Li Xian couldn't help but think of himself and his younger brother. “Are you here to steal?”

The beggar shook his head, but afraid Li Xian would hit him, he nodded and said pitifully, “I didn't steal anything.”

“Great Hero, I dare not do it again. Spare... spare my life.”

“I... my sister... we really can't survive this winter. That's why I came. Please spare me. I... I won't do it again.”

The beggar was skin and bones, kowtowing repeatedly.

“How did you get in?” Li Xian frowned.

“Through... through a dog hole. I'm thin...” the beggar trembled.

“Go back the way you came. If I see you again, I’ll beat you to death,” Li Xian said coldly.

“Ah!?” The beggar couldn't believe it. “Big... Big Boss, you’re really letting me go?”

He had a few companions who also sneaked into the manor. When caught by the guards, some were beaten to death, some were played to death. Their deaths were miserable.

“Hm?” Li Xian frowned, showing a look of displeasure.

“Okay... okay, I'm leaving right away. Big Boss, you're a good man, you're a good man.” The little beggar was about to钻 (crawl) through the hole to leave.

Li Xian looked around and saw no other guards. He called out, “Wait.”

The little beggar was so scared he almost wet himself, but fortunately, his stomach was empty, so he couldn't even if he wanted to.

“Here are some stale buns. Take them and get lost.” Li Xian took two soft, warm buns from his chest.

Since they were kept close to his body, they still had some warmth.

“This...” The little beggar didn't dare to take them. Li Xian simply threw them at his feet. Seeing the buns get dirty, the beggar hugged them to his chest, looking at Li Xian timidly.

Then he kowtowed twice and crawled through the crack in the wall to leave.

“Sigh, my extra snack is gone.”

“And they were delicious meat buns... I snuck them.”

Li Xian felt a pang of heartache. He used a stone to block the crack in the wall, covered it with weeds, and continued his patrol.

The world was still so painful.

It was just that Li Xian’s situation was better than before.

“Guard No. 269, D-rank, Li Xian.”

“Your afternoon patrol is canceled. Come with me to help watch over the servants' quarters.”

About half an hour later, when Li Xian was getting bored, a middle-aged man walked toward him, waving and shouting.

This man was also a D-rank guard named Zhao Dachun. He was an old hand among the guards, with average martial talent, so he hadn't been promoted for a long time.

“Is it Li Xian?” Zhao Dachun said bluntly. “I'm Zhao Dachun.”

“Brother Zhao, hello,” Li Xian nodded. “I’d like to ask, why are we suddenly going to watch over the servants' quarters?”

Zhao Dachun explained, “What else? The Lady wants to repair an alchemy pavilion. But she’s short on wood and stone materials.”

“A while ago, she bought some wood and stone from the Lin family of Qingning County and the Black Wood Gang. They are piled up three miles outside the manor.”

“Since winter is approaching, we need to bring the stone and wood back to the manor quickly. We’ll have the servants of the servants' quarters do the heavy lifting. You and I just need to watch from the side.”

Li Xian said, “I see.”

“This is a good job. It’s much easier than patrolling,” Zhao Dachun laughed. “We got lucky. We can just slack off on the side.”

“I didn't expect to return to the servants' quarters so soon,” Li Xian smiled suddenly.
