# Chapter 6: Teleportation

Zhou Tian turned his head and clicked on the second skill.

**[Teleportation: Appear anywhere you wish to be, ignoring all seals (Distance: 100 meters, related to number of deaths)]**

"666…"

With the groundwork laid by [Crippling Fist], Zhou Tian was already mentally prepared. Although this skill was also incredibly powerful, he merely muttered "6" to show his respect.

"Huh, why is there a question mark at the end?"

Just as Zhou Tian was about to click on the next skill, he suddenly noticed a small, bright yellow question mark at the end of the [Teleportation] skill description. Curious, he clicked on it.

**[Ignoring all seals means: within the skill's specified distance, if space is sealed, Teleportation will use the rules of time. If time is sealed, it will use the rules of causality. If causality is sealed, it will use the rules of the unspeakable to perform Teleportation.]**

"Holy cow, this system is so user-friendly, it even has annotations." Zhou Tian exclaimed, surprised that it was an annotation, as if the system was afraid he wouldn't understand what "ignoring all seals" meant.

After reading the annotation, Zhou Tian's eyes gradually grew hot. So the real highlight of this skill was "ignoring all seals." In that case, the skill's value increased significantly. From now on, no one would be able to touch him…

Uh… if others couldn't touch him, they couldn't kill him. And if they couldn't kill him, how could he accumulate death counts? Zhou Tian realized he had entered a thought trap. He no longer needed to escape death; he craved it.

He clicked on the next skill.

**[Judgmental Strike: Summon a bolt of lightning to strike the chosen enemy, causing up to five seconds of paralysis. Cannot be repeatedly used on the same target. Varies with enemy strength (Daily uses: 1, related to number of deaths)]**

This skill was also formidable. It would cause at least one second of paralysis, meaning it virtually ignored level limitations. Paired with the previous [Crippling Fist], it was incredibly potent—control plus damage.

Zhou Tian looked at the three dazzling skills, conflicted and unsure which to choose. All three were powerful, but each had its restrictions. [Crippling Fist] required him to physically hit the enemy, [Teleportation] had no offensive power, and [Judgmental Strike] could only control enemies; he had no cultivation to follow up with damage.

"Sigh… I'll still go with [Teleportation]. At least it has no usage restrictions."

After a long deliberation, Zhou Tian finally clicked on the [Teleportation] skill interface and then on the plus sign next to it.

Shimmering light converged on the icon. The [Teleportation] icon, which had been flickering, now glowed steadily. A surge of inexplicable information flooded his mind, while the other two skills transformed into two streaks of dark light and vanished into the still-locked skill list below.

"Does this mean I can still choose them later?"

Zhou Tian's eyes lit up slightly. From the looks of it, those two skills had merged into the skills that would appear later. Originally, Zhou Tian felt a bit regretful. Although he had chosen [Teleportation], it didn't mean he wasn't eager for the other skills.

The main reason for choosing [Teleportation] was not only its lack of usage restrictions but also another crucial factor: although he could now revive, each revival occurred at the spot of his death. If the news of his revival ability ever leaked, enemies could set up a damage array at his death spot, trapping him in an eternal loop of death-revival-death. During revival, he was unconscious, as he was merely a mortal. Unless he had skills that strengthened his body, there were still many ways to restrain him.

With this [Teleportation] skill that could ignore all seals, he would have a lot of leeway.

However, Zhou Tian still yearned for the other two skills. He had thought that by choosing [Teleportation] this time, the other two skills would disappear, but unexpectedly, they had merged into the future skill pool, giving him another chance to select them.

This had both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was not having to regret giving up good skills, as there would be another opportunity to choose them. The disadvantage was that many undesirable skills might repeatedly appear, occupying unlocked skill slots.

From the system description, Zhou Tian understood that the three skills that appeared each time he leveled up were randomly drawn with no fixed pattern. Zhou Tian didn't believe there were no useless skills in this Undying System.

Closing the system interface, Zhou Tian processed the information that had just appeared in his mind about how to use the [Teleportation] skill. After learning this skill, the Undying System directly embedded it into his soul, making it as natural as eating and drinking, a part of his physical abilities, ready to be used at any moment.

Zhou Tian looked at the space behind his desk. His body blurred, as if tearing apart, vanishing from his spot, and reappearing exactly where he wanted to be.

At the same time, a sudden realization dawned on him.

"So this is what it's like to use the rules of time for teleportation."

Zhou Tian sat on his chair, lost in thought. The entire Prince Qin's residence was equipped with restrictions, using powerful formations to seal space. That's why [Teleportation] had just used the rules of time to move…

[Teleportation], amidst the infinite possibilities of the future, found the possibility of Zhou Tian reaching that exact spot, then截取(extracted) that possibility and manifested it in his body, completing the movement.

Inside the room, Zhou Tian's body continuously blurred, disappearing and reappearing—on the roof, under the bed, on the table, in mid-air. He played to his heart's content. The "100 meters" referred to a range extending 100 meters up, down, left, and right from Zhou Tian, so the space was quite large.

*Knock, knock, knock!*

A gentle knocking sound came from the door. One moment, Zhou Tian was in mid-air, the next he was standing by the door.

He opened the door. Outside stood a maid in a green dress, holding a purple sandalwood box. She was about to speak.

"Young..."

Before "Master" could leave her lips, she saw the door open. A look of surprise crossed her face; she hadn't expected it to open so quickly, as if someone had been standing right at the door.

After a moment, the maid reacted. "Young Master, this is your dinner! Master ordered us to deliver it!"

Zhou Tian nodded, took the food, and instructed, "I understand. You may leave."

The green-clad maid responded with a "Yes," bowed, and retreated.

"Why are all these maids so ordinary-looking..." Zhou Tian grumbled after closing the door. In novels, weren't maids always beautiful beyond compare? Why were his so common? And there was no personal maid who had grown up with him since childhood. Sigh...

He opened the purple sandalwood box with silver threads in his hand. There were faint, transparent runes inscribed on it, likely for insulation.

A fragrant aroma wafted out, making Zhou Tian involuntarily swallow. Golden meat glistened with oil, the light green vegetable leaves were as lustrous as jade, and golden, dragon-like substances swam in the soup, while the rising steam formed shapes of various exotic beasts.

After a day of commotion, Zhou Tian was indeed quite hungry. He sat down and ate ravenously. The food was incredibly delicious, making him lament why he hadn't noticed how tasty it was in the previous days.

His golden finger had arrived today. Tomorrow, he still had to go find Tian Ling to play with. That's how relationships were built; he had a lot to do.

What? "Hollow eyes"? Sorry, how could I possibly have such eyes! Zhou Tian smiled faintly, speeding up his eating even more...
