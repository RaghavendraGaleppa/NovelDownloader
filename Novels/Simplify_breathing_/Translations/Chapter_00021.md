**Chapter 21: Startling Thunder Sword Energy**

"Your subordinate did discover something, but whether it's an issue or not still requires Young Miss to find someone to verify."

Chen Fei hesitated for a moment. Regarding the profit split, Chen Fei didn't particularly care, as the bulk of his earnings would come from the black market later anyway. However, the Light Spirit Pills mentioned by Zhang Sinan completely piqued Chen Fei's interest. Light Spirit Pills were a higher-grade cultivation elixir than Grass Reversion Pills, typically consumed by Bone Forging Realm, or even Marrow Tempering Realm martial artists. Consequently, their medicinal efficacy was much stronger than Grass Reversion Pills, and their price was naturally considerably higher. If Chen Fei could obtain the Light Spirit Pill formula, he could replace his current Grass Reversion Pills. Whether for his own consumption or for sale in the black market, it would be viable.

"'Speak!' Zhang Sinan said calmly."

"'The scent of Light Spirit Pills on Steward Sun's body is quite strong,'" Chen Fei said in a deep voice. An alchemist's nose was more sensitive to medicinal ingredients than other martial artists, especially concerning herbs. Chen Fei had seen, and even consumed, Light Spirit Pills, so he was very familiar with them. As the steward of the medical hall, it was normal for Sun Shu to have the scent of elixirs on him. However, the scent of Light Spirit Pills completely overpowering all other elixirs was not normal, especially since he wasn't an alchemist. Only through daily contact, or even long-term consumption, would the scent of Light Spirit Pills become so potent. Light Spirit Pills were not cheap; one pill cost fifteen taels of silver, fifty percent more expensive than Grass Reversion Pills. Although Sun Shu was a medical hall steward, his wages were nowhere near enough to support consuming one Light Spirit Pill a day.

"'Those counterfeit medicinal ingredients, did you make them yourself?' Chen Fei asked calmly."

"'Huh? Counterfeit medicinal ingredients? How could that be!'" Chi Defeng cried out loudly, a look of disbelief on his face, then walked towards the medicinal ingredients, inspecting them carefully. Chen Fei wanted to roll his eyes. With such an act, anyone unaware would probably be fooled. If Chen Fei himself weren't an alchemist, ordinary people truly wouldn't be able to discern such a counterfeiting method. Without a certain level of foundational skill, it would be impossible to produce counterfeit medicine of this quality.

"'There really are fakes! Those damn refugees, they even fooled me!'" Chi Defeng wailed sorrowfully, but after shouting a few times and seeing no reaction from Chen Fei, he awkwardly trailed off.

"'So, what now?' Chen Fei asked, looking at Chi Defeng."

"'I've looked, and there aren't actually many fakes, just a little bit,' Chi Defeng said with a smile."

"'I asked for ten portions, and only six were genuine. Yes, just a little bit,' Chen Fei nodded."

"'That many? I didn't even notice just now! Those damn refugees!' Chi Defeng started shouting again."

"'Here's the silver for six portions of medicinal ingredients. Next time, I'll still need ten portions, pick them up in three days.'"

It wouldn't be long before Chen Fei accumulated five hundred taels of silver. Tucking the medicine bottle into his embrace, Chen Fei glanced at his panel.
