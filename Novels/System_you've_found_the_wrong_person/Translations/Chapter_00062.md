# Chapter 62: The Beauty Ranking  

When misfortune strikes you alone, it feels unbearable.  

But when someone else shares your misfortune, it becomes easier to bear.  

And when an entire group is equally unlucky, you hardly feel it at all—because misery loves company.  

After encountering Jin Wuming, the two of them quickly discovered a third unfortunate soul.  

This was a woman—her brows arched like crescent moons, her nose high and delicate, her lips red and teeth white. Her slender, graceful figure swayed like a willow in the wind, exuding an air of elegance.  

She was like a dazzling pearl, gentle yet radiant, with an unparalleled aura.  

At first glance, Dou Changsheng recognized her—Sun Duxiu, the foremost of the Eight Talents of the capital!  

The reason she left such a deep impression on him, allowing him to recognize her instantly, was simple: she had made it onto the Beauty Ranking.  

(To clarify—the ranking was for those under thirty.)  

Beyond the Heaven, Earth, and Human Rankings of the Martial Arts Pavilion, there existed numerous other lists—rankings for movement techniques, palm techniques, sword techniques, and so on.  

But the most attention-grabbing of them all was the Beauty Ranking.  

The Martial Arts Pavilion had always maintained a strict selection of the Ten Great Beauties, never expanding the list to a hundred. But as times changed, even ten spots became insufficient. At some point, an ingenious mind decided to keep the Ten Great Beauties as the main ranking while adding sub-rankings—first for those under thirty, then expanding to include those under fifty and under a hundred. Beyond that age, they were no longer considered—though exceptions could still make it onto the main Ten Great Beauties list.  

A man might not know the Heaven, Earth, or Human Rankings by heart, but the Beauty Ranking? That was mandatory knowledge.  

Sun Duxiu, at twenty-six, ranked seventh among the Ten Great Beauties under thirty. Naturally, she hadn’t made it onto the main list, and once she passed thirty, she might not even retain her current position.  

This was the most fiercely contested age bracket—competing not only against peers but also against older predecessors, with occasional dark horses emerging from obscurity.  

With Sun Duxiu’s appearance, the number of unfortunate souls inevitably grew.  

Because a woman like her would never lack admirers.  

Dou Changsheng couldn’t help but glance at a strikingly handsome man in white—Chen Weiquan, one of the Ten Elites of the capital. Compared to their last meeting, Chen Weiquan seemed much more composed, as if life’s hardships had tempered him. A commendable growth, truly.  

But this man… didn’t seem like the type to fawn over a beauty.  

Dou Changsheng took another look at Sun Duxiu and immediately retracted that thought.  

Her beauty alone wasn’t what drew people in—it was the effortless grace in her every movement, like a living poem, intoxicating to behold.  

Sun Duxiu’s bright eyes gleamed as a faint smile touched her lips, revealing charming dimples that exuded an innocent allure.  

Her gaze seemed to lock onto him—though Dou Changsheng knew it was an illusion. She was looking at both him and Jin Wuming.  

Sun Duxiu drifted toward them, light as a feather, as if gravity had no hold on her. She stopped before Dou Changsheng and Jin Wuming, the latter’s silver-white hair fluttering as he studied her intently.  

A whisper reached Dou Changsheng’s ear:  

*"Every woman on the Beauty Ranking is far from simple."*  

*"The more innocent they appear, the darker their hearts."*  

*"Sun Duxiu’s family background isn’t strong enough to secure her position among the Ten Great Beauties."*  

*"She must have climbed her way up through ruthless means."*  

*"Brother Dou, I’m guessing you’re still a virgin. Let me warn you—if you fall for her, that’s your problem. Just don’t drag me down with you."*  

*"As an experienced man, I’ll tell you this: to survive in the martial world, never let emotions cloud your judgment. Don’t see women as people—only then can you live peacefully."*  

*"Countless heroes have fallen to beauties throughout history. Learn from their mistakes."*  

*"Brother Dou, you can’t handle this."*  

*"Let me take care of it."*  

With that, Jin Wuming stepped forward, his voice smooth as he spoke:  

*"Ah, Sister Sun."*  

*"It’s been fifteen months since we last met in the capital."*  

Sun Duxiu’s voice chimed like silver bells: *"Fifteen months and ten days."*  

*"I was traveling north when I was caught in this maze. I can’t tell direction anymore—I can’t find my way out."*  

*"Brother Jin, could you lend us a hand? We’ll repay the favor."*  

Jin Wuming glanced at the group behind her and scoffed.  

*"A bunch of worthless stragglers."*  

*"Dying here would be a fitting end for them."*  

*"I’ve told you before, Sister—don’t associate with these lowlifes."*  

*"Keeping such company will only drag you down in the eyes of the world."*  

He gestured toward Dou Changsheng.  

*"This man here? He debuted on the Human Ranking at seventy-ninth place, titled the 'Boundless Sword Lord.'"*  

*"He’ll undoubtedly rise to the top ranks in time. In a few decades, he’ll make the Earth Ranking, shaking the world with his fury and calming it with his presence."*  

*"These nobodies? They’d struggle just to make the Human Ranking. Forget the Earth Ranking—reaching the Divine Marvel Realm would be a miracle for them."*  

As Sun Duxiu opened her mouth to speak, Jin Wuming’s eyes turned icy.  

*"I’m only sparing these trash out of respect for you."*  

*"Now scram—unless you want me to start killing."*  

Then, without hesitation, he placed a hand on Sun Duxiu’s shoulder and murmured:  

*"Don’t speak."*  

*"I might do something reckless."*  

*"Out here in the wild, there’s no one to play the gallant hero for you."*  

Jin Wuming’s demeanor was utterly ruthless, his gaze lingering on Sun Duxiu before shifting sharply to Chen Weiquan and the others. They exchanged glances, their eyes eventually settling on Dou Changsheng.  

This was a test.  

After a moment of thought, Dou Changsheng understood.  

From the moment Jin Wuming saw Sun Duxiu, he had planned to use her beauty as leverage. By playing the villain and intimidating her, he could provoke a protective instinct in others.  

This wasn’t truly the wilderness—there were people watching.  

Chen Weiquan’s group was insignificant, but the Mechanical Gate had laid this formation—meaning a Divine Marvel Realm expert was present.  

Rather than struggling to break the Nine-Curve Maze, it was better to force the Mechanical Gate to reveal themselves.  

With so many trapped here, the sect wouldn’t dare let anything happen to Sun Duxiu.  

Her family might not be powerful, but as the leader of the Eight Talents and a ranked beauty, she had influential backers now.  

A Human Ranking expert might be strong, but in terms of fame? Sun Duxiu eclipsed them all.  

If anything happened to her, the entire martial world would take notice.  

Scandalous rumors about beauties always spread the fastest—especially the juiciest ones.  

"Jin Wuming."  

"Enough theatrics."  

"The sect master has invited you all here to celebrate the completion of the Lake Realm."  

"You are all honored guests."  

"Please, come!"
