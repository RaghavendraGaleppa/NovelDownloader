# Chapter 34: Qi Chan'er in Peril, Qi Chuan Steps In  

On the small rocky island, Qi Chan'er's delicate face showed a trace of anxiety.  

A golden ring-shaped light revolved rapidly around her, emitting beams of golden radiance that shot in all directions. The four water cloud alligators surrounding her let out agonized howls as the golden beams struck them, shattering their scales and drawing blood.  

Having learned their lesson, the alligators began dodging the golden beams, but they didn't retreat. Instead, they continued to circle her, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Their massive jaws dripped with foul-smelling saliva as they glared at her with predatory eyes.  

Seeing this, Qi Chan'er grew even more anxious.  

"I need to think of a way out, or I might not make it out of here alive. My spiritual energy won't last much longer with the Golden Light Ring activated like this."  

The golden ring-shaped light was an upper-grade magical artifact called the **Golden Light Ring**. As the daughter of the Qi family's Transmission Elder, Qi Chan'er had been given this treasure before leaving the Red Maple Valley to cultivate in the Moonwind Sect.  

The Golden Light Ring was both offensive and defensive. In its defensive form, it spun around the wielder, emitting golden beams to repel enemies. In its offensive form, the beams became more concentrated and powerful, but the coverage area shrank. Right now, switching to offense would leave her vulnerable to the alligators' attacks.  

With the Golden Light Ring and her Qi Refinement Stage Four cultivation, Qi Chan'er could hold out for a short while. But against four beasts of similar strength, the spiritual energy drain was immense. She knew she wouldn’t last long.  

"If this continues, I’ll run out of energy before long. Once my reserves are low, the Golden Light Ring’s defense will falter, and that’ll be the end of me."  

She gritted her teeth in frustration.

### Regret and Desperation  

Regret gnawed at her.  

Since joining the Moonwind Sect’s outer sect, Qi Chan'er had been taking on numerous missions to quickly improve her strength and surpass Qi Chuan. Over the past few months, she had visited the Black Swamp several times for assignments.  

She knew this area was supposed to be teeming with water cloud alligators, but strangely, they had become scarce. Even when actively searching, she’d only find one or two.  

Recently, she had accepted a mission to gather **Black Mystic Grass**, a rare spiritual herb in the swamp. After finding only two stalks, she ventured deeper into the marsh, hoping to collect more.  

Despite the increased danger, she encountered no alligators—until now.  

On this small rocky island, she had discovered three Black Mystic Grass plants. Overjoyed, she rushed in to harvest them without thoroughly scouting the surroundings.  

That was her mistake.  

Four water cloud alligators, lurking in the nearby waters, suddenly emerged and ambushed her.  

"If only I had been more careful," she thought bitterly.  

But regret wouldn’t save her. She needed a plan.

### A Risky Gamble  

Her only option was to take a desperate risk.  

"I have to break through now, while I still have energy left."  

She eyed the alligators warily. If she waited until her spiritual energy was nearly depleted, she’d be doomed.  

Her plan was simple: switch the Golden Light Ring to its offensive mode, unleash a concentrated attack to severely injure one or two alligators, then escape through the gap.  

But this strategy was dangerous. Abandoning defense meant exposing herself to fatal attacks.  

Still, she had no choice.  

"Now!"  

As the Golden Light Ring forced back two alligators on her left, she locked onto the two on her right.  

One was dangerously close. If she struck now, she could likely wound it severely, creating an opening.  

The other was farther away—too far to guarantee a hit.  

With a deep breath, she activated the offensive mode.  

The Golden Light Ring hummed as it shifted forms, and her spiritual energy drained rapidly. A concentrated golden beam shot toward the nearest alligator.  

But fate was cruel.  

The alligator instinctively sidestepped, avoiding a fatal blow. The beam still struck, tearing through its scales and drawing blood, but the wound wasn’t crippling.  

Worse, the pain enraged the beast. It let out a furious roar and charged at her with reckless abandon.  

The other three alligators, sensing their companion’s fury, also lunged forward.  

Qi Chan'er’s heart sank.  

"Am I really going to die here?"  

She braced herself for a final, desperate counterattack.

### A Sudden Intervention  

Just then, a faint sigh reached her ears.  

A sharp *whoosh* followed, and two fist-sized crimson fireballs streaked through the air. They struck the two closest alligators with terrifying precision.  

*Boom!*  

Flames erupted, engulfing the beasts in a blazing inferno. Their agonized shrieks filled the air as the intense heat seared their flesh.  

Qi Chan'er’s eyes widened in shock.  

"That’s… a **Perfected Fireball Technique**?"  

Someone had intervened—someone powerful.  

And she had a suspicion who it might be.
