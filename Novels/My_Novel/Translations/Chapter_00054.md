# Chapter 54: Displaying the Hunt, Astounding the Crowd

Outside the Bear and Tiger Mountain, after the continuous rain had ceased.

Seeing Li Xian pull out two deer carcasses in a row, Hua Hanying was startled. But remembering his own abundant harvest, he puffed his chest out again, looking down on Li Xian with arrogance.

Jiang Yun stood with her arms crossed. There were many forest beasts in the mountains. If one’s luck was good enough, catching two wild deer wasn't exactly strange.

She herself had quite a few wild deer.

While everyone was lost in their own thoughts, Li Xian reached in again and took out yet another deer carcass.

"An arrow through the heart, followed by a finishing shot with a sharp-feathered arrow."

"Killing from fifty paces away. These three deer of yours were hunted beautifully."

Seeing that it was yet another arrow through the heart, and that three consecutive deer kills were all like this, Lady Wen knew it was enough to prove Li Xian truly had skill.

She was extremely fond of winter hunting, feeling that men should be heroic. And this heroic spirit should be displayed through hunting.

Although these people were merely subordinates, in her heart, they were as lowly as dust. But a heroic subordinate is always better than a despicable one.

Among the usual Grade B guards, only a few could gather three wild deer.

For Li Xian, a mere Grade C, to achieve such a level, it was already quite impressive.

The crowd spoke up one after another, with praise, astonishment, and disbelief.

Luo Fang felt a sense of dread. *This little bastard is getting more and more powerful.*

"Thank you for your praise, Madam," Li Xian replied.

Lady Wen nodded, her brow relaxing. "Whatever other beasts you have, just take them out."

Li Xian nodded, reached into the shrinking flesh bag, and this time... he pulled out a mountain tiger!

"It's a mountain tiger! Li Xian actually hunted a mountain tiger!"

"This Li Xian is so incredibly powerful. As a fellow Grade C guard, if it were me, I would only be able to run away if I encountered a mountain tiger."

"Could it be a sick tiger or something? Otherwise, with his strength, how could he possibly hunt a mountain tiger?"

The moment the tiger corpse appeared, the scene immediately became noisy, filled with various words of disbelief.

In the eyes of the crowd, it was natural for Hua Hanying and Pang Long to hunt mountain tigers, so it wouldn't cause much of a reaction.

But Li Xian was just a Grade C guard, yet he had suddenly killed a mountain tiger. This was definitely worth discussing.

Lady Wen drew an arrow, gently flipped the tiger's body over, revealing an arrow hole. Her willow-leaf eyebrows raised slightly. "A very handsome archery skill."

"Another one-shot kill. The angle was tricky. You must have taken advantage of the tiger drinking water to suddenly shoot and kill it."

"To be able to do this, your archery cannot be bad. You can achieve over ninety percent accuracy within fifty paces."

"Good, very good."

Lady Wen stroked the yellow jade ornament on her bow and looked at Li Xian. "You used to be a hunter?"

"Replying to Madam, yes, I was a hunter," Li Xian answered truthfully.

"No wonder then," Lady Wen said. "To have such a harvest, while your archery played a big part, it relies even more on your tracking and hunting skills."

"Do you have any larger beasts?"

Li Xian said, "There are more."

More?... The crowd murmured.

Hua Hanying and the others already had unsightly expressions, their fists clenched, an unknown fire of jealousy rising in their hearts, feeling both unconvinced and resentful.

However, the next moment, they were so shocked they took several steps back, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

It was another tiger!

And it wasn't an ordinary mountain tiger, but a mottled great tiger! Its size was a full half larger than an ordinary tiger.

"A mottled great tiger?"

The field fell silent. When Lady Wen spoke, no one dared to interrupt. They only listened to her clear voice as she点评-ed.

"This type of tiger beast has considerable intelligence, and its patterns are strange. When running at high speed, they can dazzle the eyes."

She inserted an arrow into the tiger's leg and, with a light exertion of her wrist, moved the mottled great tiger beneath her.

"This tiger beast ambushed you. You dodged downwards, your mind clear in the emergency, and kicked a 'Gentle Breeze Leg'."

"Then, you拉开 distance, firing several arrows in succession to block its path. The final arrow hid a killing intent, ending the tiger beast on the spot."

"A very beautiful hunt."

Lady Wen nodded, looking at Li Xian, her eyes now holding a hint of approval. "This winter hunt, you have given me a great surprise."

"Eh?"

She suddenly paused, focusing on the tiger's belly. "There is even a tiger fetus. This tiger counts as two."

"A Deer Blood Pill and a Tiger Blood Pill, plus a monetary reward to be calculated by the accounts office. You also get a chance to enter the Leisure Martial Pavilion."

By this point, Lady Wen thought this was the limit. Hua Hanying, Pang Long, and the like were only at this level. It would be difficult to produce any larger beasts. She prepared to return to the manor.

"Madam, I still have a large beast," Li Xian stated directly.

"Oh?" Lady Wen said with great interest, "You still have a large beast?"

"Yes." Li Xian reached into the bag and pulled out another tiger beast.

But this tiger beast, merely revealing its front claws, was already enough to make people tremble. Its claws were black, flashing with a sharp锋芒, larger than two heads combined.

When its true appearance was fully revealed...

It was clearly not an ordinary mountain tiger, but a Ghost-Striped Tiger!

"This... what kind of tiger beast is this? Even in death, it has such a powerful imposing manner!"

"Its eyes are staring at me, and my whole body is bristling, as if bearing needles on my back. It's incredibly uncomfortable."

"What a terrifying tiger beast. Can such a fierce beast really be killed with a bow and arrow?"

"This tiger beast is probably even more powerful than the bear beasts of Commander Pang and Master Hua!"

The crowd was in an uproar.

"Ghost-Striped Tiger?" Lady Wen murmured. The previous noise immediately quieted down. "You encountered a Ghost-Striped Tiger and were actually able to escape with your life."

She then examined the injuries on the Ghost-Striped Tiger. One eyeball was burst, and its entire body's bones were broken and disconnected. It was clearly the result of falling from a high place.

Then it was趁机 shot to death.

After the fall, it immediately suffered a fatal arrow wound. It was obvious that everything had been planned.

This young man, whether in archery, or in temperament, or in his calmness when facing a crisis, was far superior to others.

"What other beasts do you have? Pour them all out," Lady Wen said.

"Yes!"

Li Xian channeled his internal energy into the shrinking flesh bag and gave it a full shake.

A black-furred bear corpse fell out with a thud. This type of black-furred bear beast, with its dense black fur and tough hide, was a rare variant among bears and was very difficult to hunt.

The crowd was already numb to it. Hua Hanying's body trembled lightly, his pride completely shattered.

But this wasn't the end.

With another shake, another bear corpse. This bear corpse was much smaller, with a long mouth and sharp teeth. At first glance, it looked like a monkey.

"It's a cub..." a guard sighed in relief. Finally, not all of them were huge beasts.

"What do you know? This is a Long-Tongued Bear, the most ferocious type of bear!" Pang Long said solemnly.

Jiang Yun trembled all over, her legs going weak. She had originally gone deep into the forest to hunt bears, specifically looking for bear dens.

She had encountered this type of bear and had witnessed with her own eyes how it devoured humans. She had almost lost her life there too. Luckily, she had hidden in a crevice in a mountain wall and managed to escape.

"A monster, it's a monster!"

"Is there really someone who can shoot and kill such a bear beast?"

Jiang Yun looked at Li Xian, who had a calm expression.

"If you've killed the cub, the mother bear must also be on you," Pang Long said.

Li Xian nodded and took out his final prey.

A massive mother bear, with a long mouth and sharp teeth, a three-foot-long tongue, and ferocious eyes.

Only now was Li Xian's entire harvest displayed in full.

"What a fine lad, you're truly amazing!"

Pang Long, in his surprise and delight, patted Li Xian on the shoulder.

It was too brilliant. Seeing these kinds of猎物 was truly satisfying.

Lady Wen's beautiful eyes looked over. Seeing Li Xian's youthful vigor, his excellent temperament and archery, and his heroic style, she made an internal assessment:

"This young man is quite good among these guards."
