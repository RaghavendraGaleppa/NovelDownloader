# Chapter 168

Zhang Kun, being perceptive, immediately changed his tune upon seeing that his grandfather seemed to be acquainted with the influential figure opposite them. Although he organized the banquet, the incident of the Chen family member's invitation being snatched had little to do with him. If not for considering the other party's influence, he likely wouldn't have bothered.

Zhang Yu nodded in satisfaction, very pleased with his grandson's discernment. The Chen family member, on the other hand, was extremely nervous. He hadn't expected the person behind this guy to be acquainted with Zhang Yu. The Zhang family was a formidable clan, comparable to the Primordial Qilin Ox clan, and far stronger than his own. This made him regretful. He shouldn't have let his anger get the better of him, sought out his uncle to get another invitation, and come in trying to regain face.

Zhou Tian narrowed his eyes slightly upon hearing Zhang Kun's words but said nothing more.

A moment later, Huang Niao spoke: "Esteemed Zhang Yu, Master has arrived, but there are restrictions here, preventing him from entering." The invitations were issued by Zhang Yu, not Tongtian Hotel, so Sheng Mo could bypass that. However, the verification system within the elevator-like space of Tongtian Hotel was personally set up by Tongtian Corporation, and Sheng Mo couldn't bypass it.

"Kun'er, remove the restrictions," Zhang Yu instructed. Zhang Kun had booked the entire floor, and Tongtian Hotel naturally provided corresponding services. The elevator's verification system was set up by Tongtian Hotel at Zhang Kun's request, ensuring that only those holding an invitation could press the button for this floor.

"Yes," Zhang Kun nodded, took out a golden card, swiped it a few times, causing runes to ripple, then put it away.

A moment later, the "elevator" opened, and a man stepped out. His body was radiant, his skin fair, and his appearance could be described as peerless. His lips curved slightly, and his eyes sparkled. Many women present were captivated, their faces flushed, biting their lower lips, as if they had just encountered their beloved. Zhou Tian secretly curled his lips, feeling an urge to remove the mask from his face and show them what true handsomeness looked like. However, considering Sheng Mo was, after all, his subordinate, he decided not to embarrass him.

"Haha, Brother Sheng Mo, why didn't you greet me when you arrived?" Zhang Yu laughed heartily and walked up to greet him, just as Zhang Kun had greeted Niu Hong earlier.

"Brother Yu, you're too polite. I'm only staying here for a day or two, how could I presume to disturb you?" Sheng Mo said calmly, then looked at Zhou Tian. "What trouble did you cause that even Brother Yu was alarmed?"

"Alas, it was just a minor misunderstanding between the younger generation. It's already resolved, nothing major," Zhang Yu said, not wanting to dwell on the matter.

"Mu Su, did you bully someone again? If so, even with me here, you must apologize." Sheng Mo said this naturally, as Huang Niao had secretly informed him of many things, including Zhou Tian's alias.

"So cultivated~" A Saintess, usually an unattainable goddess, exclaimed infatuatedly, her heart fluttering with admiration.

"Nothing much, I snatched someone's invitation, and they came looking for me," Zhou Tian said casually, waving his hand. Although there were many hidden details, like the other party initiating the trouble, Zhou Tian felt it could be said, but wasn't necessary.

"Whose did you snatch?" Sheng Mo asked with a frown.

"His." Zhou Tian pointed at the Chen family member who was now standing meekly aside, like a turtle retracting its head.

Sheng Mo turned his head, his eyes gleaming with divine light. "I snatched yours. Any objections?"

"So domineering." It was still the same Saintess, her face even redder with shyness, leaning against the wall as if she could barely contain herself.

Everyone was speechless. The Chen family member was shocked, almost spitting blood. What about the promised apology? This was simply shameless! However, he only dared to curse inwardly, stammering outwardly, "Dare not, dare not."

"Brother Sheng Mo..." Zhang Yu took a step forward and stood before Sheng Mo. "The Chen family is one of Tongtian Corporation's shareholders."

"Brother Yu, you and I should both be clear on the full story. Since Mu Su is my man, I naturally cannot let him be bullied." Sheng Mo frowned, meeting Zhang Yu's gaze, not yielding an inch.

Zhou Tian secretly rolled his eyes. *People should take responsibility for their words. Who the hell is 'your man'?*

"Let me handle this. I'm acquainted with the Chen family head, and I'll definitely give you a satisfactory answer. After all, the Chen family is a shareholder of Tongtian Corporation; if you make a move, Tongtian Corporation definitely won't stand idly by." Zhang Yu also had a headache and, after a moment's thought, came up with this solution.

The Chen family member collapsed to the ground, his face pale. He was already disliked within his own family. If Zhang Yu were to say a word or two to the Chen family head, he would surely be finished, not knowing where he would be banished.

Sheng Mo turned to look at Zhou Tian and asked, "What do you think?"

Zhou Tian nodded and said, "That works." He hadn't expected Sheng Mo to be so accommodating, nor did he continue to pursue Zhang Kun's earlier actions. He hadn't suffered any loss in this incident anyway.

Zhang Yu feigned indifference as he glanced at Zhou Tian, surprised at his high standing in Sheng Mo's heart, yet still having no particular impression of him.

With the matter temporarily concluded, Zhang Yu invited Sheng Mo to the VIP room. Originally, Zhang Yu wanted to open a new space specifically for Sheng Mo, but Sheng Mo declined, so they could only reminisce there. Zhang Kun, as if nothing had happened, beamed with smiles and enthusiastically chatted with Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian didn't feign aloofness and engaged in a casual conversation with him.

"Greetings, two seniors." As he passed Niu Hong, Niu Hong respectfully bowed and greeted them.

"The Qilin Ox clan? Hmm, not bad. I had a drunken night with one of your clan's elders a few days ago and heard your name. Come along." Zhang Yu nodded slightly. He had a wide circle of friends and also had dealings with the Qilin Ox clan.

"Is your Great Elder still alive?" Sheng Mo suddenly asked.

"What do you mean, senior?" Niu Hong frowned slightly, his voice neither humble nor arrogant. Although his cultivation wasn't high, his clan feared no one, and Sheng Mo's question carried a hint of provocation.

"Don't misunderstand, he and your Great Elder are good friends. They had a fight some time ago, and your Great Elder returned in utter defeat, which is why he asks," Zhang Yu explained.

Niu Hong was slightly taken aback, then he remembered. Indeed, the Great Elder had returned in a hurry some days ago, and half of his large horn was broken, which he remembered very clearly. He gave a wry smile and said, "Thanks to senior's blessing, the Great Elder is still well."

Sheng Mo smiled slightly. "That old fellow is quite tough." Then, he pulled a dark object from the void – it was half of a large horn. Its surface seemed to have a substance flowing, shimmering with an inexplicable radiance, and he handed it to Niu Hong. "This is your Great Elder's horn. It's yours now. It contains quite a few Dao principles, which should be suitable for you."

Niu Hong felt helpless, unsure whether he should accept it.

"Take it if I give it to you. Don't give it back to your Great Elder; he probably wouldn't have the face to ask for it anyway." Sheng Mo forcefully pushed it into Niu Hong's hand.
