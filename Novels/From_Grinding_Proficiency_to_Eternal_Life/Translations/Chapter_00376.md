# Chapter 376: The Penglai of the Eastern Sea

When Xu Yunfan stepped on the air and arrived, the Nine Luminaries Sect had already received news that he had successively annihilated the Maitreya Sect and the Xuanzhen Sect. They were fully prepared, their Nine Luminaries Formation connected root and branch. As the disciples’ vital energies and blood essence linked together, a thick and vast power of blood and energy surged into the sky, as if raising a massive furnace between heaven and earth.

A purple-robed elder stood within it, his hair and beard bristling as he shouted fiercely, "Demon! Today, I shall let you witness the might of the Nine Luminaries' True Flame Energy!"

"I've become a demon too?"

Xu Yunfan sneered, reaching behind him to unhook the Void-Piercing Cloud-Piercing Bow.

The Ten Extremities True Qi surged like a tidal wave. Before the bowstring was even drawn, nine golden-red arrows materialized out of thin air.

The arrowheads exuded a piercing cold light; the surrounding air was torn apart by the sharp energy, emitting a sharp hiss, as if even the void was about to be pierced.

Xu Yunfan’s arm shook, the bowstring tightening like a full moon. The moment his fingertips released—

"Swish! Swish! Swish!"

Nine arrows pierced the air, like golden-red meteors tearing through the sky. Wherever the arrows passed, airwaves rolled, clouds scattered, and even the sea of clouds above Nine Luminaries Mountain was split into nine distinct paths!

"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"

The first arrow shattered the Nine Luminaries' blood-energy furnace phantom like glass, splattering blood essence everywhere.

Using his ability to locate dragon veins and distinguish pulses, the second arrow pierced the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend star positions within the mountain range, causing the mountain to crumble inch by inch.

The third arrow fell directly into the center. Before the purple-robed elder could react, his chest was pierced by the arrow's energy, and his protective true qi dispersed like paper.

The shockwave caused the entire mountain to tremble; the mountain gate halls collapsed with a rumble, the crust sinking three hundred zhang. Scorching magma erupted from the fissures, swallowing the remaining buildings.

The Grand Elder of the Nine Luminaries Sect, his hair and beard standing on end, raised his withered hands with a猛然 movement, supporting the Nine Luminaries' Jade-Breaking Sun-Falling Star Core.

The fist-sized crystal core suddenly burst with a piercing white flame. Within the light, it seemed as if thousands of strands of true fire circulated. The scorching heat made the surrounding air twist and pop, and even the mountain walls melted into red magma under the baking.

"Demon! Taste this solar true fire that can burn the sky and boil the sea!"

The Grand Elder roared fiercely. The light and flame erupting from the陨星核 turned into nine white-hot flames, clawing and lunging at Xu Yunfan.

Facing this terrifying true fire left behind by a Land Immortal Realm expert, capable of burning mountains to ash, Xu Yunfan didn't move a muscle.

A mocking curl touched his lips as the Ten Extremities True Qi formed a vortex-like devouring force in his throat.

He opened his mouth and inhaled...

"Huu!"

The nine flames were actually like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, swallowed by him into his belly.

The Ten Extremities True Qi circulated rapidly on his body's surface, forcibly suppressing the violent solar true fire and refining it into pure golden-red true qi to merge into his meridians.

White mist sprayed out from Xu Yunfan's pores; it was the impurities and fire toxins being expelled.

"This... this is impossible!"

The Grand Elder stumbled back, his wrinkled old face twisting. "The True Flame Energy can burn even a Ninth Realm peak expert to ashes. Even if you are a Land Immortal, you shouldn't be able to... You..."

A Grand Elder beside him, putting on a brave face, said, "Xu Yunfan, what do you want?!"

Xu Yunfan smiled grimly, revealing his white teeth. "I kept you old fossils alive until now."

He clenched his right hand into a虚握, and the Ten Extremities True Qi took shape, instantly condensing into nine dark golden ribbon-like strands.

"Naturaly, I want to make full use of you."

The ribbons, like venomous snakes, wrapped around the limbs and bodies of the Grand Elders, their tips piercing into the Dantian acupoints.

The several elders discovered in horror that the star power they had cultivated for hundreds of years was leaking out like a bursting dam.

They struggled desperately, only to see Xu Yunfan's five fingers slowly clenching.

"Crack!"

In the crisp sound of the ribbons crushing bone, the last reserves of the Nine Luminaries Sect were drained of their essence and true qi, turning into withered, mummified corpses.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. His spine glowed with a golden-red aura; it was the newly refined Nine Luminaries true qi fusing with the Ten Extremities true qi.

The entire Nine Luminaries Mountain was completely silent, only the gurgling sound of flowing magma remained, as if mourning the fall of this thousand-year-old sect.

"Hiss!"

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and focused, feeling the surging foreign true qi within him guided by the Ten Extremities true qi, flowing endlessly like rivers returning to the sea.

Every cycle of the meridians was like a furnace smelting iron, refining and purifying the mixed foreign true qi layer by layer.

While breathing and exhaling with focus, the originally violent and uncontrollable foreign true qi—such as that from the Nine Luminaries, Xuanzhen, and Vajra sects—had been refined by more than half, turning into strands of pure Ten Extremities true qi that merged into his four limbs and hundred bones.

The Ten Extremities patterns that had unknowingly formed on his spine flickered on and off, like a flowing galaxy, showcasing the continuous improvement of his martial cultivation.

The remaining foreign true qi still rushed about in his meridians, but in the end, it could not escape the suppression of the Ten Extremities true qi and was completely assimilated, becoming part of his power.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, a golden light flaring within them, and his overall vital energy rose to a higher level.

*Your Ten Extremities Martial Dao proficiency has skyrocketed.*
*Your Ten Extremities Martial Dao seems to have broken through a limit.*
*Ten Extremities Martial Dao (Broken Limit)*
*...*

Glancing at the data floating in his vision, Xu Yunfan slowly exhaled a mouthful of turbid air. The Ten Extremities true Qi within him churned like a tidal wave.

He could clearly feel that the foreign true qi filling his flesh and blood had been refined by more than half, and a feeling of fullness came from the pores all over his body.

"I can still swallow a few more times."

He narrowed his eyes. With every breath, strands of mixed true qi that hadn't been fully refined溢出 from his pores, turning into fine golden light in the air and dissipating.

Time was sufficient.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning as he looked far toward the direction of the Eastern Sea. That was where Penglai Pavilion was located. Although it wasn't famous in the world, being one of the Six Great Sects of the Great Zhou, it naturally had its unique points.

Moreover, in Yujing City, Penglai Pavilion had struck at him ruthlessly.

He tapped his toes lightly, his figure suddenly shooting up from the ground, flying through the air like an arrow released from a bow.

The Ten Extremities True Qi circulated around him, turning into a golden-red flow of light that tore through the sky.

Wherever he passed, airwaves rolled, and the clouds were forcibly torn open, leaving a vacuum trail and emitting a piercing shriek.

Below in the mountains and forests, trees were pressed low by the violent airflow, leaves scattering; streams flowed backward, splashing water droplets that refracted colorful halos in the sunlight.

Birds scattered in panic, beasts knelt on the ground trembling.

Xu Yunfan's speed grew faster and faster. The Ten Extremities True Qi was expended by him, constantly exploding behind his heels, creating ring-shaped airwaves. Under such acceleration, his figure wrapped in protective energy gradually transformed into a golden-red rainbow, slashing through the sky and pointing straight toward the Eastern Sea!

A hundred miles out into the Great Zhou's Eastern Sea, amidst vast misty waves, stood a solitary cyan-black island.

The entire Penglai Island was shrouded in mist that never dissipated. Weak Water surrounded the island; its color was like ink, and poisonous mist that could erode bones and souls churned and steamed on the water's surface. Ordinary martial artists would dissolve into a puddle of blood upon contact.

The world says there are immortal traces on the island, and many martial artists desired to land, but they were all poisoned to death by the Weak Water surrounding the island.

The island's terrain was strangely steep. Jade pavilions and mansions were built against the mountain, their eaves corners drooping with thousands of water-curtain threads, refracting seven-colored clouds in the morning light.
