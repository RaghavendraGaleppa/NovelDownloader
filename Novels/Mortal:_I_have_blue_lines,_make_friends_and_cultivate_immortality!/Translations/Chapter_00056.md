**Chapter 56: The Battle! Annihilating the Moon Veil Sect Cultivators! (2/3)**  

"What do I want to do?"  

Lin Yun snorted coldly. "You should be asking what your Moon Veil Sect intends to do!"  

"Out there, you openly allied with the other five sects to hunt me down. And now, you’ve broken the seven sects’ agreement by sending a Core Formation elder inside!"  

"Your Moon Veil Sect really plays a clever game!"  

Caught off guard, a flicker of panic flashed across the young woman's face as she defended, "Lin Yun, my cultivation technique is special—I’m genuinely at the Qi Condensation stage right now."  

"Humph—and am I not at the Qi Condensation stage too?!" Lin Yun retorted with another cold snort.  

"Uh—" Nan Gong Wan froze awkwardly. This had nothing to do with her—it was all that damned Elder Qiong’s doing. He had made the decision without even consulting her.  

After his sneer, Lin Yun pulled out a stack of talismans.  

The Moon Veil Sect disciples paled at the sight, screaming in terror, "So many talismans!"  

From behind them came another panicked shout: "The Black Flood Dragon is charging again!"  

"Damn it! Now we’re trapped between a wolf and a tiger!" Nan Gong Wan’s delicate, fairy-like face turned deathly pale.  

"Curse you, Senior Brother Qiong! Why did you have to provoke him?!"  

But she quickly assessed the situation—fighting the Black Flood Dragon was impossible. Their only chance was to break through Lin Yun’s side.  

"Moon Veil Sect disciples! If you want to live, charge forward and capture that man!" Nan Gong Wan pointed at Lin Yun and commanded.  

"Otherwise, we’ll all end up in the belly of that flood dragon!"  

The disciples exchanged glances, knowing this was their only hope.  

"Fight him to the death!" one of them shrieked.  

"Fight me to the death?"  

Lin Yun sneered. "Do you even have the strength for that?"  

"None of you Moon Veil Sect disciples will leave the Bloody Forbidden Land alive!"  

He activated the first talisman in his hand.  

A piercing cry echoed through the underground cavern as a massive firebird, over ten zhang in size, surged toward the Moon Veil Sect disciples.  

"Watch out—that’s an intermediate-grade Firebird Talisman!"  

"What?! An intermediate-grade talisman?! Impossible!" Nan Gong Wan staggered back in shock, her face ghostly pale. "You can already craft intermediate-grade talismans?!"  

"How is this possible?! No one’s talisman-crafting talent can be this monstrous!"  

"You’re only at the Qi Condensation stage!"  

But Lin Yun’s only response was a relentless barrage of talismans. In truth, only the first one had been intermediate-grade.  

**Boom!**  

**Boom! Boom!**  

**Boom! Boom! Boom!**  

The underground world trembled violently as the Moon Veil Sect disciples scrambled for their lives under the onslaught. Most were obliterated instantly, with only a few elite disciples—armed with top-tier defensive artifacts—managing to survive by hiding in corners.  

Ironically, the Black Flood Dragon suffered the worst. Its massive size left it no place to hide, and after enduring several explosions, it hastily retreated into the muddy depths.  

"Brother Lin, stop! I’m still here!"  

Han Li, who had been hiding at the back, was nearly caught in the crossfire when a talisman landed at his feet. He leaped out in panic.  

The Moon Veil Sect disciples were stunned—there had been someone else behind them all along?  

Only Nan Gong Wan remained grim. With her heightened spiritual sense, she had detected Han Li earlier. She had planned to deal with him after securing the jade box, but unforeseen events had derailed everything—first the Black Flood Dragon’s unexpected evolution, and now Lin Yun’s ruthless assault.  

And he had brought an arsenal of talismans!  

"Little Li, what are you doing here?!" Lin Yun feigned surprise.  

"Brother Lin, I didn’t want to—" Han Li began, but before he could explain—  

"Capture him!" Nan Gong Wan barked. "He’s Lin Yun’s sworn brother! Take him hostage, and we can force our way out!"  

The surviving Moon Veil Sect disciples, who had already resigned themselves to death, suddenly erupted with desperate resolve.  

These were the sect’s elites—each armed with top-tier artifacts or talismanic treasures. Though few in number, they were formidable.  

Nan Gong Wan summoned her Vermilion Bird Ring once more, aiming to seize Han Li and use him as leverage against Lin Yun.  

"Why is my luck so terrible?!" Han Li cursed inwardly. He had just witnessed the ring’s terrifying power—now he was about to experience it firsthand.  

He tried to flee, but Nan Gong Wan flicked out a mid-grade Golden Thread Talisman. The talisman transformed into golden strands midair, instantly binding Han Li.  

"Damn it!"  

"Black Iron Shield!" Han Li attempted to summon his artifact, but the golden threads split into countless filaments, wrapping around him like a cocoon.  

Though he managed to deploy the shield in time, the Vermilion Bird Ring—a true magical treasure—shattered it effortlessly. The impact sent Han Li flying, blood spraying from his mouth as he collapsed, consciousness fading.  

"Grab him now!" Nan Gong Wan ordered triumphantly.  

"Don’t you dare touch my brother!" Lin Yun hurled several talismans, forcing the approaching disciples back. Then, slapping speed-enhancing talismans on himself, he dashed toward Han Li.  

With Lin Yun momentarily distracted, the path to the exit was left unguarded.  

"Now’s our chance! Run!" Nan Gong Wan shouted.  

"I’ll hold him off! Go!" she commanded the remaining disciples.  

She knew that as long as even one Moon Veil Sect disciple escaped, Lin Yun wouldn’t dare kill her—murdering a Core Formation elder’s disciple was a crime he couldn’t afford.  

The survivors, seeing hope, sprinted toward the exit.  

"Think you can run? Not a chance!" Lin Yun flicked his wrist, three Heavenly Thunder Beads materializing between his fingers. He hurled them at the tunnel entrance.  

**BOOM!**  

A blinding flash and deafening explosion later, the fleeing disciples were reduced to bloody mist.  

Nan Gong Wan’s eyes nearly burst from their sockets in fury, but before she could react, the underground cavern—already weakened by Lin Yun’s earlier bombardment—began collapsing under the Thunder Beads’ force.  

"The exit’s caving in!" she gasped, panic setting in. Survival was now her only concern.  

"Not so fast!" Lin Yun, now holding Han Li, tossed several Wood Binding Talismans enhanced by his Yin-Yang Five Elements True Light at her.  

"Pah! You think mere high-grade Qi Condensation talismans can stop me?!" Nan Gong Wan scoffed, the Vermilion Bird Ring igniting with flames that illuminated the cavern.  

Ordinary Wood Binding Talismans would’ve burned to ash instantly.  

But Lin Yun’s were no ordinary talismans.  

The vines and roots, reinforced by his True Light, regrew faster than her flames could destroy them. Their unnatural toughness ensnared her before she could react.  

"You’re not escaping either!" Seeing her trapped, Nan Gong Wan abandoned resistance and directed the Vermilion Bird Ring to smash the ceiling above the exit. A massive boulder crashed down, sealing the tunnel.  

Han Li, barely conscious in Lin Yun’s grip, rasped, "Brother Lin, leave me! Go, or you’ll be trapped here too!"  

"Don’t be ridiculous. What kind of brother abandons his sworn sibling?"  

"Live well, little brother!"  

Lin Yun slapped a mid-grade Diamond Talisman on Han Li and, with a mighty heave, hurled him through the narrowing gap just before the boulder sealed it shut. The force sent Han Li tumbling out—likely to collide with something and lose consciousness.  

**CRASH!**  

With the exit sealed, Lin Yun and Nan Gong Wan were now trapped.  

"Tch. How touching," Nan Gong Wan sneered, though her voice held a note of grudging admiration. "You could’ve escaped if you’d abandoned him. Yet you chose to stay."  

That plain, unremarkable Qi Condensation rogue cultivator meant so much to him?  

"Han Li and I are brothers by fate," Lin Yun said coldly. "He’s my sworn brother—closer than blood."
