# Chapter 206: Such a Master of Pretense

The bustling marketplace was crowded with people coming and going.

At the recruitment stall of the Lin Clan Trading Company, a large group of scholars were queuing up for interviews. Examiner Lü Xiuming was meticulous and rigorous in screening resumes. As a native Confucian cultivator from the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world, he naturally understood the appropriate interview standards for the local environment—which was why the Black Skeleton Demon Lord trusted him with this task.

Although the Mountain Bear Sage coveted the generous conditions offered by this trading company, he didn't dare to step forward recklessly. He planned to observe how others interviewed first, secretly learning from their experiences.

The interviews on-site were proceeding.

"Honorable Examiner, this humble scholar Wu Hanqiao graduated from the White Deer Academy. I represented our academy in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world combat tournament and earned a top hundred ranking. I specialize in talisman arts while also studying formations, puppetry, and beast taming..."

This was a top student from a prestigious academy—a true all-rounder.

"Honorable Examiner, this humble scholar Jin Wenhao graduated from the Shangyang Academy. I failed the Four Treasures of the Study combat exam but hold a second-level certification in formation arithmetic and a first-class certification in Silver Tadpole Script..."

This was an average student from an ordinary academy—nothing remarkable.

"Honorable Examiner, this humble scholar Gong Shutang graduated from the Green Toad Mountain Academy of Hongze Lake. I have extensive experience in aquatic farming and conservation, having sold fish for a living during my youth..."

This was a weak student from an obscure academy—but with practical experience.

...

After a round of interviews, some were rejected while others passed. All three candidates mentioned above were accepted.

The top student was accepted without question—that was only natural.

The average student's background resonated with Examiner Lü Xiuming, so he was also taken in.

As for the weak student, although his academy—Green Toad Mountain—wasn't among Lu Kingdom's top ten academies, it still had some local reputation. Moreover, the young man had relevant work experience, so he was given a chance.

Others weren't so fortunate—Lü Xiuming's screening still had standards.

The Mountain Bear Sage's eyes gleamed with insight. He paid no attention to those who were rejected, focusing only on the successful candidates' interview techniques to refine his own presentation.

Precisely because he didn't understand Lu Kingdom's system—the prestige of various academies, the value of competition certificates—and because Examiner Lü Xiuming wouldn't deliberately verify the authenticity of "academic qualifications," the Mountain Bear Sage saw an opportunity to slip through the cracks.

When his turn finally came, the Mountain Bear Sage mentally reviewed his prepared speech several times. Confident he'd absorbed the best from all candidates, he sat excitedly before the examiner.

---

Examiner Lü Xiuming frowned imperceptibly. The burly man before him looked downright crude!

The surrounding scholars all wore expressions of disdain. This man was unkempt, ill-mannered, and carried an air of banditry—utterly lacking a scholar's demeanor.

Worst of all, he came to the interview without a resume—as if he didn't take the examiner seriously at all. Was he genuinely here to apply?

"Where is your resume?"

Lü Xiuming suppressed his impatience as he asked.

"Uh, that..."

The Mountain Bear Sage fumbled awkwardly. He'd been so focused on observing others that he'd completely forgotten to prepare one.

Seeing his discomfort, Lü Xiuming didn't press further but got straight to the point:

"Please introduce yourself, scholar."

The Mountain Bear Sage sighed in relief. Sitting properly on the stool, he began reciting his carefully "synthesized" speech word by word:

"Honorable Examiner, this... uh, humble scholar Xiong Shan graduated from the Shangyang Academy. I participated in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world combat tournament but failed the Four Treasures of the Study exam..."

"Failed? Then how did you participate in the tournament???"

"Ah no no, I passed the combat exam! Passed! I also have a second-level certification in formation arithmetic and first-class in Silver Tadpole Script..."

The Mountain Bear Sage stammered, sweat beading at his temples as his nerves grew.

"I have extensive experience in aquatic farming and conservation, having sold fish for a living during my youth..."

Examiner Lü Xiuming listened with deepening frowns. The already accepted candidates behind him exchanged puzzled looks.

Why did this guy's background sound so similar to theirs?

The surrounding scholars also found his resume disjointed and began murmuring among themselves.

Lü Xiuming turned to the previously accepted Shangyang Academy student: "Is this man from your academy's graduating class this year?"

The student honestly replied he didn't know and hadn't heard of him.

But this didn't stump Lü Xiuming. As the trading company's general manager, he had access to the official registry of graduating students seeking employment from major academies this year.

After checking, he found no record of the Mountain Bear Sage.

The Mountain Bear Sage squirmed uncomfortably, his face burning with embarrassment, fearing public exposure.

After scrutinizing him for a long moment, Lü Xiuming—considering the man's Foundation Establishment cultivation—ultimately decided to accept him.

Academic credentials were important, but cultivation level was hard capability. Though from a Confucian background, Lü Xiuming wasn't entirely inflexible.

---

In normal times, he would have opted for cheaper Qi Condensation laborers. But the Lin Clan Trading Company currently faced special circumstances. According to instructions from the "vice president" above, they needed to establish their own aquaculture farm—digging channels outside the city to cultivate vast quantities of seafood, all spiritual aquatic creatures with cultivation bases.

Ordinary Qi Condensation cultivators couldn't possibly manage so many spiritual creatures, let alone handle channel digging.

This Foundation Establishment oaf happened to be perfect for the company's labor needs.

As for why the Lin Clan Trading Company suddenly abandoned import channels—their previous lucrative business—to start aquaculture, this was naturally the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's directive.

When selling a business, one couldn't pass off an empty shell. Since the East Sea supply channels couldn't be sold, they had to quickly establish an aquaculture farm for the buyer to continue operations—a sustainable business model. Otherwise, it would be hard to sell.

Thus, the dazed Mountain Bear Sage received an offer to become the aquaculture farm manager—or more grandly, the "Fish Pond Supervisor."

He was overjoyed!

A dream job for fishing enthusiasts!

With opportunities to slack off!

Perfect, absolutely perfect.

Having just arrived in Lu Kingdom, he'd landed such a great position immediately—the Lin Clan Trading Company treated him well!

What he didn't notice was that just outside the recruitment market, two Dai Clan cultivators were secretly observing this scene.

---

That evening, in a northern city cave abode.

The Dai Clan members gathered as one of them reported:

"The Lin Clan Trading Company hasn't changed hands yet. But today at the recruitment market, I spotted another middle-aged man with a beard calling himself the Mountain Bear Sage."

"What?"

"Are you sure you heard correctly?"

"Another Mountain Bear Sage?"

...

Everyone was baffled. Was the title "Mountain Bear Sage" really that common?

"That oaf who called himself the Mountain Bear Sage was actually hired by the Lin Clan Trading Company."

"???"

The group sensed something unusual. Dai Budong pressed: "And then?"

"Then..." The Dai clansman looked puzzled. "Then the Mountain Bear Sage was appointed as the company's Fish Pond Supervisor. Apparently, he's going outside the city tomorrow to assume his post."

"Fish Pond Supervisor?"

Dai Budong immediately spotted an issue—how could a new hire be given a supervisor position right away?

"What's his cultivation level?"

The clansman hurriedly replied: "I secretly checked with a spirit detection plate—late Foundation Establishment."

"Tsk—"

Now everyone understood. No wonder he was entrusted with responsibility immediately—he was a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.

They instantly connected this bearded Mountain Bear Sage with the white-robed young man from the Lin Clan Trading Company—both late Foundation Establishment. Could there be a connection?

After prolonged association, they'd developed a habit: when uncertain, ask Zhu Duiyou.

Zhu Duiyou paced the room for a long while before suddenly snapping his fan shut.

"I've got it!"

"This bearded Mountain Bear Sage and the white-robed young Mountain Bear Sage—despite different appearances—are the same person!"

"Today's performance was just the Mountain Bear Sage's scheme to not only change his appearance but also adopt a new identity—switching from 'Lin' to 'Xiong'—to slip out of the city undetected."

"What a brilliant diversion tactic!"

"After today, you'd think he's still in the city preparing to sell the Lin Clan Trading Company, waiting to be caught at the gates. In reality, he plans to leave openly under a new identity. Who would have thought he'd mastered the art of cutting losses to survive!"

"Though compared to selling the Dai Clan's assets in Moonview City, abandoning the Lin Clan Trading Company is insignificant."

"What a formidable opponent. Unfortunately for him, we've already uncovered the Mountain Bear Sage alias—his very disguise has become his flaw!"

...

Everyone was shocked. They hadn't expected the Mountain Bear Sage to be so cunning—they'd nearly been fooled.

If the Mountain Bear Sage escaped the city, only a Golden Core cultivator could catch him. They'd lose all chance of redress, allowing him to roam free. Even if the Dai Clan sent another Golden Core elder to Moonview City, it would be futile.

By then, the furious Dai Clan would need a scapegoat—likely Dai Budong himself.

"Damn it, that Mountain Bear Sage is truly despicable!"

"So treacherous, with such intricate schemes!"

"This 'deceiving the heavens to cross the sea' tactic is impressive~"

"Luckily, nothing escapes Brother Zhu's sharp eyes."

...

Everyone gasped in awe, marveling at Zhu Duiyou's perceptiveness.

Dai Budong urgently sought advice: "Brother Zhu, what should we do now?"

Zhu Duiyou gently fanned himself, exuding confidence: "No rush. Since the Mountain Bear Sage wants to escape, he'll play his role thoroughly. We'll simply wait for him at the Lin Clan Trading Company's aquaculture farm outside the city."

---

Following the plan, the group left the city that night, arriving at the designated location to lie in ambush.

...

The next day, the Mountain Bear Sage—radiant with joy—tossed aside his small card, donned the Lin Clan Trading Company uniform, and leisurely exited the city.

He arrived at a large compound one li outside the city, marked with four large characters: "Lin Clan Fish Pond."

Nodding in approval, the Mountain Bear Sage strode inside. Passing through the gates and front courtyard, a group of servants—having received word from the company—greeted him with broad smiles.

"Are you Supervisor Xiong Shan?"

"Indeed."

"Please come in! We'll show you around."

"Mm, lead the way!"

Assuming a leadership stance, the Mountain Bear Sage inspected the entire compound, making "professional assessments" of the aquaculture farm's setup.

Truth be told, he wasn't misplaced in this role—he genuinely had relevant expertise.

Back in the East Sea's Water Bear Territory, he'd been a notorious pirate—pillaging when possible, turning to aquaculture when not. This was essentially returning to his roots.

Having just arrived in Lu Kingdom and encountering a "talent scout" like Lü Xiuming on his first day—receiving such excellent benefits—he felt deeply indebted to the Lin Clan Trading Company. Determined to repay their recognition, he resolved to contribute his specialized skills wholeheartedly.

Thus, on his first morning, after familiarizing himself with the operation, he rolled up his sleeves and trousers, diligently beginning to dig fish ponds.

Of course, had he known the "fish pond" was merely a front and that the owner was about to abscond, one wonders what he might have thought...

---

By midday, with frogs croaking and cicadas chirping...

While the Mountain Bear Sage toiled diligently inside the compound, the Dai Clan members watching from a nearby tree grew restless.

"What's going on? Why isn't the Mountain Bear Sage fleeing? Is he really digging fish ponds?"

"Truly bizarre!"

"Has he gotten too into character?"

"Actually... he seems quite professional at it..."

...

As they whispered among themselves, Dai Budong grew increasingly anxious. He turned to Zhu Duiyou:

"Brother Zhu, what should we do? With the Mountain Bear Sage staying inside, the traps we set along the escape route are useless. We wasted a whole night's effort."

"Brother Dai, remain calm. The Mountain Bear Sage is cunning—we mustn't act rashly. Since he's not fleeing, let's observe patiently."

"Brother Zhu, I disagree. While he appears to be digging ponds, how do we know he isn't secretly setting up another grand formation? If he succeeds, how could we possibly capture him?"

...

"This... is a valid concern. But time is on our side. If we keep him under surveillance until the Dai Clan's new Golden Core elder arrives in a few days, he won't escape then. We'd still accomplish our mission—why rush?"

Zhu Duiyou maintained clear-headed judgment, advising the most prudent approach to assist Dai Budong.

But Dai Budong had a premonition—he couldn't wait. As the saying goes, long nights invite bad dreams; indecision brings disaster. If they didn't act now and the Mountain Bear Sage escaped, what then?

"My mind's made up. If he won't come out, we'll go to him!"

The Dai Clan members voiced no objections—at critical moments, they followed Dai Budong's lead. Zhu Duiyou could only follow reluctantly.

---

The Mountain Bear Sage wiped mud from his ankles. Looking up, he saw two young Confucian scholars enter the courtyard, followed by twenty-some attendants.

"And you gentlemen are...?"

"I am Dai Budong, disciple of Yun River Academy."

"I am Zhu Duiyou, disciple of Jingyang Academy."

"We're representatives of the Dai Clan. We apologize for this unannounced visit and hope for your understanding!"

Dai Budong smiled insincerely, revealing his identity to see the Mountain Bear Sage's panicked reaction.

To his surprise, the Mountain Bear Sage knew nothing of the Dai Clan. Having just arrived in Lu Kingdom days ago, he assumed they were business partners of the Lin Clan Trading Company!

"Ah, no need for apologies! The Dai Clan's presence honors the Lin Clan Fish Pond! Please, have a seat!"

The Mountain Bear Sage warmly ushered them in, determined to represent his company well and not embarrass his employers.

The Dai Clan members stared blankly as he busied about, carving over twenty stone stools for them as if nothing were amiss. It took them a while to recover.

Then they sneered collectively.

What an act!

Still pretending at this stage!

Dai Budong remarked mockingly: "Should I address you as the Mountain Bear Sage... or Wanliu Academy's Bu Peiying?"

The Mountain Bear Sage looked utterly baffled: "Wanliu Academy? Bu Peiying? Never heard of them. I am the Mountain Bear Sage, name unchanged."

The group cursed inwardly—this guy wouldn't admit defeat until confronted with irrefutable evidence.

Still pretending even now!

---

Zhu Duiyou stepped forward slightly, his gaze subtly sweeping the fish pond as he asked pointedly:

"What kind of fish pond is this... that it can contain so much?"

The Mountain Bear Sage puffed out his chest proudly:

"The Xiong-style Nine-Grid Professional Fish Pond, of course it can contain much!"

"See how it's long east-west, wide north-south, with a five-to-three length-width ratio."

"Ample sunlight, minimal shade—fishing and netting handled with ease."

"Turtleback-shaped bottom ensures smooth drainage."

"Surrounded by blue-patterned stones—no seafood escapes!"

...

The Dai Clan members stood dumbfounded, listening to his professional fish pond lecture, momentarily forgetting their original purpose.

---

Meanwhile, in Moonview City...

Inside a private room on the fifth floor of a restaurant, Lin Shan was shaking hands warmly with a portly merchant. They'd finally reached a transfer agreement, to be formalized before the Interior Ministry in two days.

"Haha, Fellow Daoist Lin, don't forget to visit the Lin Clan Trading Company when you have time."

"Nonsense, Fellow Daoist Qian! What Lin Clan Trading Company? It should be called the Qian Clan Trading Company now!"

"Hahaha!"
