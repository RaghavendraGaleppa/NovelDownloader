# Chapter 45: The Water-Avoiding Pearl and the Mysterious Golden Light  

What truly drew Gu Yuan to the Cloud Cliff Shell Field wasn't the shell pearls that could aid in cultivation breakthroughs, nor was it the peculiar "Dharma Body Seal" within the cavern before him.  

It was the enigmatic and unfathomable "golden opportunity."  

A golden legend—a chance to defy fate and alter destiny.  

This was the true, monumental stroke of fortune.  

Everything else had merely been minor gains.  

Gu Yuan burned with desire.  

Yet, upon arriving at the Cloud Cliff Shell Field, his heart had sunk halfway.  

The stone liquid's revelation pointed to an opportunity buried deep within the water veins—a depth even a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator wouldn't dare venture.  

At only the sixth level of Qi Refining, Gu Yuan couldn't even withstand the water pressure at such depths, let alone engage in underwater combat.  

Suppressing his longing, he had bided his time, methodically seizing the Shell King and the half-silver opportunity, ensuring he secured every attainable benefit first.  

But now, a glimmer of hope to glimpse the golden opportunity had emerged.  

"Lan Tianlu descended directly from the cave opening atop the cliff, bypassing the water and entering the sixth layer of the shell field?"  

"Could there be a passage within the cliff wall that leads downward without entering the water?"  

Gu Yuan gazed thoughtfully at the broken cave opening above.  

Lan Tianlu had shattered the cliff wall, descending vertically, but the cave itself spiraled like a partially destroyed staircase, extending significantly to the side.  

"Let's test it first!"  

From Lan Tianlu's spoils, Gu Yuan retrieved a cyan paper crane. Infusing it with spiritual energy, he sent it into the cave to scout.  

The crane, small and swift, vanished into the depths of the cave.  

Closing his eyes, Gu Yuan attached his spiritual sense to the crane, using it to probe the cave's layout.  

Though the paper crane, a mere Qi Refining artifact, lacked sufficient spiritual sensitivity to relay clear details, Gu Yuan could still grasp the general environment.  

The cave was deep and winding, spiraling endlessly downward as if the entire solitary peak had been hollowed out.  

"Roar!"  

Suddenly, a fierce roar echoed through the darkness. Flames erupted, instantly reducing the paper crane to ashes.  

Gu Yuan's spiritual sense suffered minor damage, and a sharp pain flashed through his eyes as he reopened them.  

"Was that… a Flaming Earth Lizard?"  

Though the crane had been destroyed in an instant, Gu Yuan had caught a fleeting glimpse of the creature.  

It was a dark-red lizard with eerie blue eyes, clinging to the cave walls.  

"Flaming Earth Lizards—fiery denizens of volcanic caverns. They thrive in heat, live in groups, and are fiercely territorial. Do not provoke them lightly."  

Gu Yuan recalled the records from the Scripture Pavilion.  

These creatures were formidable, their fiery markings capable of overpowering even a seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator. Worse still, they were pack hunters.  

Typically, if you spotted one Flaming Earth Lizard, ten more were already lurking in the shadows.  

"So, this cave isn't a passage at all—it's a Flaming Earth Lizard nest. They've hollowed out the cliff to claim the geothermal energy within."  

Gu Yuan pieced together the truth and couldn't help but chuckle wryly.  

The solitary peak of the Cloud Cliff Shell Field, though submerged in water, housed a fire vein within, creating a balance of yin and yang that birthed the shell field.  

But it seemed the environment nurtured more than just shell pearls—it also bred all manner of demonic beasts.  

"If there were only one lizard, I might risk it. But a whole pack? No chance…"  

Reluctant to give up, Gu Yuan took out ten more paper cranes, infused them with his spiritual sense, and sent them into the cave.  

The cave remained dark and bottomless, spiraling into the unknown.  

"Roar!"  

This time, the cranes didn't even make it as far as before before being incinerated by crimson flames.  

"Roar! Roar!"  

More angry roars followed, and the remaining cranes were swiftly reduced to ashes.  

"No room for luck here."  

Rubbing his throbbing temples, Gu Yuan sighed.  

Pack hunters were not to be trifled with.  

Worse, the creatures seemed to have detected the intruder and were now advancing upward through the cave.  

"Time to leave!"  

With his first plan foiled, Gu Yuan abandoned the idea and turned his attention to the emerald-green pearl on the stone platform.  

The pearl shimmered, translucent and radiant, its depths swirling with what seemed like rolling waves—yet it exuded an oddly dry aura.  

It was one of only two treasures in the cavern.  

The Water-Avoiding Pearl!  

This pearl, impervious to decay for millennia, was born from underwater veins. It had but one function: to repel water.  

Holding it allowed one to traverse rivers and lakes, diving thousands of feet without hindrance.  

Yet it offered no combat advantages.  

It could let a person enter the water, but it wouldn't turn them into a dragon king.  

The crushing pressure of the depths meant that a fire spell, for instance, would fizzle out before reaching its target, smothered by the sheer weight of the water.  

Even the sharpest sword seal would struggle to pierce through hundreds of feet of dense currents to strike a foe.  

Simply put, the deep waters were no place for Qi Refining cultivators.  

Entering was one thing, but encountering a demonic beast there would render one as helpless as a mortal.  

At only the sixth level of Qi Refining, Gu Yuan knew that even with his water-based seals, he'd struggle to fight effectively in such conditions.  

Yet the golden opportunity beckoned, and he was willing to take the risk.  

If things turned dire, he could always retreat.  

But not trying at all? That was unacceptable.  

"Let's go!"  

Once resolved, he wasted no time.  

Grabbing the Water-Avoiding Pearl and the Void-Concealing Jade, he activated his seals and exited the cavern.  

Emerging from the sixth layer, he plunged downward, swimming swiftly toward the depths.  

---  

The currents below the sixth layer grew increasingly turbulent.  

Not only was the water pressure immense, but an indescribable force mingled with the flow, creating a deafening roar.  

Worse, the deeper he went, the greater the distance between layers—each now spanning dozens of feet.  

Reaching the ninth layer meant descending hundreds of feet.  

At this depth, the pressure alone would have crushed Gu Yuan without the Water-Avoiding Pearl.  

Even so, the pearl's protection had weakened, now shielding only a small radius around him, unlike its earlier dominance in the sixth layer.  

And then there were the powerful aquatic demons lurking in the depths.  

"Gurgle…"  

Not far away, a massive black turtle lurked on the ninth layer's cliff face, its emerald-green eyes fixed on two robed cultivators locked in combat within the cavern.  

Even beasts knew the adage: when the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman profits.  

This ancient turtle, brimming with cunning, waited outside the cavern, poised to strike once the cultivators weakened each other.  

Gu Yuan froze, not daring to move.  

The Void-Concealing Jade could mask his presence, but both the demons and cultivators here were at least three levels above him—capable of seeing through his concealment.  

Yet, with some distance still between them, the black turtle remained unaware of him.  

---  

After what felt like an eternity, the battle in the cavern neared its end.  

A pale-faced young cultivator unleashed a sweeping sword seal, felling his opponent—but not without sustaining heavy injuries himself.  

Seizing the moment, the black turtle surged forward with a strange cry, launching its ambush.  

This was the first time Gu Yuan had seen a demonic beast ambush humans.  

He dared not intervene, silently observing.  

Once the turtle vanished into the cavern, Gu Yuan resumed his descent.  

Deeper and deeper he went, until the muddy seabed and the base of the solitary peak came into view.  

It seemed there was nowhere left to go.  

But Gu Yuan followed an odd sensation, driving straight toward the cliff wall.  

"Plop!"  

The wall rippled like a transparent membrane as he passed through, revealing a dark, yawning cavern entrance.  

Though shrouded in darkness, a faint golden glow shimmered within the depths.  

The light wasn't dazzling, but it carried an air of timelessness—as if it could withstand the erosion of ages.
