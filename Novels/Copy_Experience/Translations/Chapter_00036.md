**Chapter 36: The Death of Fatty Mo**

After a while.

"Hahahahaha!"

Fatty Mo suddenly burst into laughter, looking at Lu Xu with an eager expression. "Brother Lu has made a wise choice. You also live in Tianmen City, don't you? Why don't you come with me to see the Mo family patriarch? He'll certainly value you highly!"

"I can also introduce Brother Lu to Young Miss Qingchan. You must have heard of her, right? She has a high-grade spiritual root, and there's a great chance she'll reach Foundation Establishment in the future. If Brother Lu could assist her with me, then after the Mo family is rebuilt, Brother Lu will surely hold a high position with great authority!"

"Oh, and speaking of it, Brother Lu and Young Miss Qingchan are similar in age, and the Young Miss is still unmarried. Perhaps there might even be a destined connection between you two!"

Fatty Mo's small eyes carefully observed Lu Xu's expression, his mouth constantly spewing out various enticing prospects.

But Lu Xu remained expressionless, making it impossible to guess what he was thinking. This made Fatty Mo's heart gradually sink.

"With me mediating, Brother Lu and the Young Miss have a strong possibility. The child you two bear in the future could even become the Mo family patriarch—" Fatty Mo continued to speak.

"Oh, that's truly an enticing offer. I've seen Young Miss Qingchan several times, and in my heart, I've always had a soft spot for her..." Lu Xu's voice gradually faded, stammering indistinctly, a faint blush inexplicably appearing on his face.

Fatty Mo was stunned by this sight, then immediately overjoyed.

*So this kid is interested in Young Miss Qingchan, hehe!*

"Haha, Brother Lu, don't worry, with me vouching for you, there'll definitely be no problem! Hehe, I didn't expect you to really have feelings for Young Miss Qingchan, but then again, she's drop-dead gorgeous, what man wouldn't be tempted when he sees her!" As Fatty Mo spoke, a playful smile appeared on his face as he walked closer to Lu Xu, this posture immediately making their relationship much more amicable.

Seeing Lu Xu's increasingly embarrassed expression, Fatty Mo's tense mood gradually relaxed, a sense of relief at surviving a crisis washing over him. It was then that he realized his back felt cold, his sweat having soaked his back at some point.

*This kid is young after all. As a spirit farmer, he lacks experience. He only cultivated to this realm by seizing our Mo family's resources. His strength might have increased, but his experience hasn't caught up. A toad wants to eat a swan's meat? Hehe, kid, I'll teach you a lesson later, let you see the cruelty of the cultivation world!*

Fatty Mo chuckled coldly to himself. Then, he watched as Lu Xu waved his hand, dismissing the Vajra Talisman Shield around him.

"Fellow Daoist Mo, let's go. You can take me to see Qingchan. With my current cultivation, I should be able to help her now!" Lu Xu said, as the Azure Radiance Sword flew out from his sleeve, enlarged, and he leaped onto it.

Lu Xu's gesture was indeed full of sincerity; he had even dismissed his Vajra Talisman Shield, indicating his complete trust in Fatty Mo. Fatty Mo saw this and thought that since the other party had set such an example, it wouldn't be good for him to keep his own Vajra Talisman Shield active. So, he too waved his hand, dispelling the shield, and jumped onto his flying sword, ready to leave with Lu Xu.

"Oh, I haven't collected the demonic fish's corpse yet!" Lu Xu said, jumping off the Azure Radiance Sword again and walking towards the fish he had sliced in two.

Fatty Mo laughed heartily, "Brother Lu, after you meet the patriarch, this kind of spiritual fish won't even be considered—"

Fatty Mo had not even finished speaking when the corner of his eye caught a flash of azure light streaking towards him.

"Ah!!!"

A shrill scream tore through the air as the Azure Radiance Sword, between its thrusts, directly shredded Fatty Mo's heart. He was completely unprepared at this moment, still standing on his flying sword, unable to react in time.

*Swish!*

The azure light circled Fatty Mo's neck once, and his head was directly severed.

Lu Xu collected the spiritual fish's corpse, then walked forward to take Fatty Mo's storage bag, picked up his magical artifact, and rummaged through his body for a while, pulling out everything that might be valuable.

Standing up and kicking Fatty Mo's corpse, Lu Xu smiled. "If you hadn't dispelled that defensive barrier, I really wouldn't have been sure I could keep you here!"

The moment he saw Fatty Mo, Lu Xu had already decided to kill him. Especially after hearing Gao Tianqiang say that the Mo family had a close relationship with the Wei family, Lu Xu's killing intent intensified to an unprecedented degree. He knew he had to keep Fatty Mo here. Otherwise, if Fatty Mo returned and told the Mo family about Lu Xu's cultivation changes, they would certainly believe Lu Xu had cultivated to this realm by feeding on the Mo family's essence.

Although that was indeed the truth, Lu Xu couldn't let the Mo family know it. Otherwise, they would surely view Lu Xu as an enemy and seek trouble with him.

*Dead fatty, when you were oppressing us spirit farmers back then, you probably never imagined a day like this, did you?*

Thinking this, Lu Xu flicked a ball of flame from his finger, engulfing Fatty Mo's corpse. The corpse burned, the firelight reflecting in Lu Xu's eyes, and a hint of emotion welled up in his heart. He recalled how, in the past, he had been timid and submissive before Fatty Mo, not daring to resist him in the slightest.

But now, times had changed. In just a few years, he had gained the strength to kill the other party.

"The wheel of fortune truly turns!" Lu Xu mused inwardly.

*Swish!*

A flying sound suddenly came from the forest. Lu Xu turned his head to look, only to see Gao Tianqiang flying over from a distance again.

Upon seeing the burning flame at Lu Xu's feet, Gao Tianqiang immediately burst into laughter. "Brother Lu, I knew this idiot would definitely die by your hand!"

"You dare to come here? Aren't you afraid I'll kill you too while I'm at it?" Lu Xu asked, expressionlessly.

"I dare to come, naturally, because I'm confident I can escape from your grasp. But then again, Brother Lu, there's no need for conflict between us!"

"In previous years, when we cooperated, wasn't it a win-win situation? We got the talismans, and Brother Lu, you obtained cultivation resources!"

"It's precisely thanks to the support of our Black Robe Society that Brother Lu could cultivate so quickly!" Gao Tianqiang said with a smile, standing on a thick branch.

"So? You've come to me because you want to restart our previous cooperation?"

"Haha, exactly. Brother Lu, you heard it earlier, didn't you? The Wei family, in alliance with the Chen family and the White Mountain Sect, is preparing to attack our Black Robe Society. This will be a tough battle, and now is precisely when we desperately need talismans!"

Lu Xu felt a bit strange hearing this and asked, "Couldn't your Black Robe Society just hide? Why fight them head-on?"

According to the Black Robe Society's usual hit-and-run tactics, no one could ever catch them, let alone engage them in a direct battle.

"The situation is different now!" Gao Tianqiang's smile gradually faded, and his expression became somewhat grave. "This time, our Black Robe Society has completely occupied Qinghu Market and taken over that second-tier spiritual vein. We have no intention of leaving!"

"You want to establish a sect?" Lu Xu found it somewhat unbelievable. The Black Robe Society, a disreputable organization that stood opposed to order, didn't have its own spiritual vein strongholds. Once they occupied a place for a long time, it would inevitably attract attacks from the major powers of Wei Kingdom. Therefore, in the past, they had always roamed throughout Wei Kingdom, living by robbing homes and looting.

What were they trying to do now? Occupy a second-tier spiritual vein and completely transform themselves into a legitimate force? It was no wonder the Wei family, Chen family, and White Mountain Sect would besiege and Crusade them. Even without the grudge of destroying the Mo family, these major powers of Wei Kingdom wouldn't just stand by and watch the Black Robe Society step into the limelight.

Hearing Lu Xu's question, Gao Tianqiang shook his head. "Who knows what the leader is thinking? Regardless, we'll likely have to rely on Qinghu Market and fight those three families a few times!"

"Hmm, that's quite interesting. However, restarting the talisman trade is something I'll have to consider carefully!"

"No worries, Brother Lu, I can understand your concerns. If Brother Lu makes up his mind, you can come find me. I'll be in Tianmen City these next few years..." Gao Tianqiang gave him an address. This rogue cultivator from the Black Robe Society had actually openly infiltrated Tianmen City again. This person truly had immense guts.

But then again, perhaps no one in Tianmen City knew his identity as a rogue cultivator. After Fatty Mo's death, probably only Lu Xu was aware. Gao Tianqiang entrusting his weakness so easily to Lu Xu was likely an attempt to gain his trust.
