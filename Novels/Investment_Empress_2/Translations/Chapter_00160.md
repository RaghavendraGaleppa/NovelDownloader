# Chapter 160: The Punishment Begins, Soaking in the Hot Spring for Two Quarter-Hours Is the Healthiest!

The water rippled, and mist rose.

In the not-so-large Mist Blossom Everlasting Spring, the air fell silent for a moment.

Li Mo squatted in the pool, the fruit in his mouth falling into the water with a plop, completely unnoticed.

Meanwhile, Ying Ice stared fixedly at the illusory panel in shock.

**[East Wasteland Region Genius Ranking, 2nd Place: Ying Ice.]**

**[East Wasteland Region Genius Ranking, 1st Place: Li Mo.]**

She suspected this was a dream, and one that had yet to awaken.

This time, their cultivation level was the same.

At the same time, she was countless times stronger than she had been in her previous life.

She had the Blood Phoenix Essence.

She had various martial arts techniques that she could execute to their absolute limit.

She had even observed the Bronze Divine Tree and was in the process of condensing a Divine Form of the Great Dao.

She even had the True Phoenix Feather granted by the system.

Yet, she still lost.

“Why?”

Ying Ice was at a loss; she couldn't understand.

Let alone the East Wasteland Region, she was confident that even among the geniuses of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands who had just entered the Observation of the Divine Realm, no one was her match.

Setting aside other means, she had seen everything in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

But.

How many people in this world can condense a Divine Form of the Great Dao to enter the Observation of the Divine Realm, while also having a physique that corresponds perfectly to it?

She hadn't seen him condense his Divine Form.

Wasn't Li Mo someone who awakened his spiritual sense by accident due to a heavenly wonder?

That would mean he only grew his spiritual soul and didn't possess a Divine Form.

Without a Divine Form, yet he was still stronger than her?

‘Is the system malfunctioning?’

This thought surfaced in Ying Ice's mind.

【This system adheres to the principle of absolute fairness and impartiality. Power comparisons are calculated strictly according to the user's current highest level.】

【In ten life-and-death battles, the host has only won three times.】

【One of those victories was due to clothing shattering, which inflicted a 'Hard Control' effect on Li Mo, allowing for a narrow victory.】

Ying Ice: “.....”

She glanced sideways and saw Li Mo in a daze, his ears red.

“What's wrong with you?”

“An old habit, it's just... high blood pressure.”

Li Mo cleared his throat.

Little Li's blood pressure looked high, but it was actually quite high.

He wanted to take his gaze back in his mind, after all, it wasn't good to keep staring at the ice lump.

But isn't it strange? His eyes seemed to have a mind of their own.

“Hmm...”

Ying Ice bit her lip and slowly sat back into the pool water. Her feelings were incredibly complicated right now.

The system's judgment seemed quite reliable.

Could it be... that this sixteen-year-old boy, who suffers from high blood pressure as an old habit, has actually surpassed her again at the same cultivation level?

But isn't that even more absurd than the system having a problem?

【Congratulations, host, for taking second place in this genius ranking.】

【Reward is being issued...】

【Detected that the host has activated the Loser's Punishment. All rewards are stored in the system space and will be issued after the punishment mechanism is completed.】

【This punishment involves: taking a bath together with 'Li Mo'.】

【Requirement: Wear the情趣 (erotic) set issued by the system.】

If it were anyone else, they would probably be killed by a sword the moment they stepped into the Mist Blossom Everlasting Spring.

He...

After all, they had already shared a bed last time, so taking a bath together wasn't that hard to accept.

But, wearing that kind of clothing...

If it were possible, she would have destroyed that shameful outfit long ago!

【Ding!】

Coincidentally, the notification sound rang out again.

【Detected that the host's current environment meets the scene requirements. Punishment is about to begin.】

【In ten seconds, the corresponding clothing will be automatically equipped for the host. Countdown starting: ten...】

【Nine...】

【Eight...】

The countdown ticked away.

At this moment, Ying Ice's eyes lost their luster, and all sorts of chaotic thoughts surged in her mind.

“Huh?”

Li Mo, who didn't know where to put his eyes, narrowed his gaze.

He saw Ying Ice curling her fingers, leaning against the edge of the pool, as if she had lost her spirit.

Ice lump, your style has changed, you know!

“Are you sick? Your face is so red...”

---

Li Mo stood up with a splash and walked over.

Then he reached out and placed his hand on Ying Ice's forehead.

Feeling the warmth from her forehead, Ying Ice looked up in a daze.

【Five...】

【Four...】

【Three...】

In her vision, the continuing countdown was flickering right above the boy's head.

Ying Ice: “!”

Li Mo: “(⊙ˍ⊙)”

It was visible to the naked eye.

The ice lump's neck, like a ripe pomegranate, turned a deep, thorough red.

Li Mo opened his mouth, but before he could say anything.

Ying Ice suddenly stood up and covered his eyes with her hand.

The movement was fast, as fast as a transformation-level palm technique.

And so...

Little Li's eyes were plunged into darkness.

Her slender, warm hands, trembling slightly, covered his eyes tightly.

“What's wrong?”

“You... can't look at me.”

Is the ice lump really sick? Is there a time when she can't speak clearly?

From her voice, Li Mo heard a hint of trembling.

But then he realized something was a bit off.

Earlier, with his superior eyesight, he seemed to have faintly caught a glimpse of brocade-like white and a mesmerizing black appearing on the ice lump's deadly figure...

“If it's inconvenient, should I go out first?” Li Mo asked softly, testing the waters.

“You... can't leave either.”

Her voice was like jade falling to the ground, yet he could hear her forcing herself to be calm.

Li Mo: “???”

This was baffling.

He knew that Ying Ice was, in her bones, a very proud and strong person who didn't want others to see her vulnerability, which was why she said he should leave first.

To avoid another awkward situation like last time.

But...

Not letting him look, and not letting him leave—what kind of confusing operation was this?

“So, are we just going to stand here like this?”

“Close your eyes and sit down.”

“......Alright.”

Li Mo sighed inwardly.

The sound of water.

He could tell Ying Ice was trying to circle around to his back.

Splash—

Suddenly, she seemed to trip and almost fell.

“Are you okay?”

“I'm fine, it's just a bit slippery. You... don't turn around.”

“.....”

...

And so.

Little Li sat in the pool, facing the wall in contemplation.

He knew the ice lump hadn't gone far.

Because from time to time, he could feel slightly erratic breaths lightly hitting his back, making it itch...

Forget it.

Li Mo had wanted to practice his cultivation.

Now, there was no way he could focus.

Behind him.

The bathrobe she had been wearing had disappeared at some point.

The water shimmered, and from time to time, mysterious and beautiful scenery could be faintly seen.

This outfit was truly more embarrassing than not wearing clothes at all...

Ying Ice's slender fingers had already curled up so much she couldn't open them, completely unresponsive.

“Almost... it was almost... just now...”

“The system... actually specified a distance requirement between the two people...”

Ying Ice's mind replayed the scene just now.

She had risen from the humblest beginnings to stand at the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

But... she had never experienced a scene like this!

Right now, every moment, her mind was in turmoil.

Even she was curious.

Wasn't she someone who, in the past, wouldn't change her expression even if Mount Tai collapsed in front of her?

【Soaking countdown: Two quarter-hours.】

【As is well known, soaking in a hot spring for two quarter-hours is the healthiest.】

She still has... two quarter-hours?!
