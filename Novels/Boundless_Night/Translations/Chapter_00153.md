# Chapter 153: All Are Happy

A green raptor was assigned to pick up Qin Ming. From a distance, it loudly shouted, "Little Brother Qin, it's me, a bird! Please, don't shoot arrows!" On its way, it felt a little scared, fearing accidental death. Rumors had been circulating in the bird world recently that this young man would shoot any bird he saw, which was truly too brutal.

Qin Ming smiled, waved at it, and reassured it not to be nervous.

The green raptor secretly breathed a sigh of relief, circling down to land. But when it saw the spoils of war, it trembled again. First, the sharp claws of Great King Black Roc caught its eye. Then it saw the Flame-Scaled Lion, Mountain Ape, Brocade Sparrow, and Master Swordsman Huang Yuan... Feathers, fur, and fangs lay scattered everywhere, glistening brilliantly. This was utterly outrageous, making its feathers stand on end. Those were all ancient demons!

"Are you a local bird demon?" Qin Ming asked.

"Little Brother, no, Great King! Although I am a local bird, I have long since abandoned the darkness and turned to the light. Recently, I have been following the orders of Great King White Peacock, patrolling various areas. I have absolutely never done anything harmful!" The green raptor was truly terrified, thinking this god-like young man also wanted to settle accounts with it. Its beak was trembling, and it nearly bit its own tongue.

The wind whistled as the green raptor carried Qin Ming and his spoils, approaching the city a hundred *li* away. Throughout the journey, it kept its body taut, not daring to breathe loudly. Raptors were not allowed to fly directly into the city, or they would be shot down by the giant crossbow bolts within.

Qin Ming entered the city with his vast spoils, attracting many curious glances. Truly experienced adventurers and hunters were all inwardly startled.

"So young, yet he has already slain so many ancient demons. What's his background? Most likely, he's an Abnormal whom the Six Emperors intend to focus on cultivating!"

"Young and accomplished, with a bright future ahead! Is the declining Six Emperors Ancestral Court about to experience a revitalization?!"

At the Six Emperors' outpost, Zhou Tao, White Peacock, and Black Crane had all returned and were "checking accounts," exchanging serious words.

White Peacock said, "During this assessment, there were experts who tried twice to eliminate the young Abnormal from the Cui family. Could it be an attempt to stir up conflict between the millennial aristocratic families and the Six Emperors?"

Zhou Tao was startled and asked, "Are you referring to Cui Chongxuan or Qin Ming?"

"Cui Chongxuan received attention twice," White Peacock replied, adding that it was responsible for several Abnormals. It then continued, "Qin Ming, Zhuo Ya, and Cao Wuji were each targeted once."

Black Crane spoke, "My side was relatively relaxed; no incidents occurred." The group of youths it was monitoring were all not Abnormals.

"There was no activity deep within the Divine Wounds Plain," Zhou Tao said, mentioning he was observing the extremely high-level anomalous beings in the night mist. Afterwards, he sighed, wondering how he would apologize to those old fellows upon his return.

White Peacock consoled him, saying, "Just tell them the truth when you go back. The wondrous medicine itself is a reward; if he has the ability to obtain it within the rules, that's his capability."

Zhou Tao's emotions were stirred. "Four Abnormals came, and it's normal for one or two plants to be picked, even two or three would be acceptable. But one of the youths acted as if he was stocking up, like he was harvesting with a sickle in a vegetable garden!"

Black Crane was surprised. "In an era where the path of New Life is gradually fading, there's still such an astonishingly talented youth? I must take a closer look when I get back."

White Peacock said very solemnly, "Elder Zhou, you should be happy! The Six Emperors are corrupt and in decline, but you might be fortunate enough to witness the rise of an Ancestor of Revitalization!"

"I understand the gravity of the situation," Zhou Tao nodded.

White Peacock said, "The area you assigned him this time was close to the red-line zone, the difficulty was too great."

Zhou Tao replied, "It wasn't beyond the scope. The Silver Wolf King, Black Roc, and Flame-Scaled Lion weren't on the dossier; he only needed to eliminate a donkey demon. I didn't expect him to be so full of righteous indignation, fighting with such passion. I heard he almost got himself killed before he managed to defeat several old demons one by one?"

White Peacock nodded, saying, "Yes, the specific details are untraceable. He shot down all nine bird demons I had tamed."

Zhou Tao nodded. If White Peacock was unwilling to speak, he wouldn't get any more details by pressing the matter.

Qin Ming noticed that the young disciples at the Six Emperors' outpost showed shock when they saw him. Some opened their mouths as if to speak but then closed them. These young disciples, some from the Zhou family lineage and others grand-disciples of high-ranking elders, had come to assist with the assessment and, incidentally, to observe the "wondrous medicines." How could their expressions not change? They felt as if the sky had fallen, that the medicine field had been flattened! Hence, it was understandable why Elder Zhou Tao's head was as big as a bushel basket; too many interests were involved.

A group of youths returned one after another, with over a dozen casualties in total. Even though they had been advised to act within their capabilities and not to force a fight if they couldn't deal with the demons on the dossier, some still took risks and lost their lives.

Zhou Tao sighed, first expressing regret for the deceased youths, then encouraging the returned group of vibrant "seeds," telling them they were the future of the Six Emperors. This time, he very formally greeted each youth and meticulously inquired about their demon-extermination experiences. Besides him, other experts from the Six Emperors' outpost also appeared, showing great concern for these elite young talents. A banquet was held to welcome them and wash away their dust.

White Peacock and Black Crane, with their bodies shrunk, also came to the venue, paying special attention to the several young Abnormals, though their main focus was on observing Qin Ming. Because this person was too special; nine rebirths, yet he continuously slew ancient demons. Such a feat would be more fitting for the "seeds" in the Ancestral Court who had learned the Six Emperors' Strength. The two high-level anomalous beings did not know that Qin Ming was only in his seventh rebirth.

"He couldn't have studied the Six Emperors' Heart Sutra with Cui Chongxuan, could he?" Black Crane wondered.

This was a banquet, and all those who survived were considered to have passed the assessment. They all smiled, raised their wine cups, and got acquainted with their future fellow disciples. Clearly, many were sober-minded; the number of core disciple positions was limited, so they settled for being elite disciples. By now, many had heard that the young Qin Ming was courageous and exceptionally enthusiastic, having once crossed boundaries to help others. For example, Zhou Lei and Huang Cheng had both received his care, making him truly worth befriending. Especially when people learned of his achievements, they felt like they were dreaming—wasn't it too terrifying?!

In fact, the achievements they learned of were severely downplayed because Zhou Tao had ordered them to be concealed, telling Qin Ming that it was a form of protection for him. Zhou Tao frankly stated that it was to prevent the Six Emperors' genius from being stifled prematurely once outsiders learned about him. Qin Ming nodded, thinking Elder Zhou's consideration was quite thorough.

Zhou Tao's mood was incredibly complex now. This time, he indeed had a selfish motive, as his uncle, Zhou Shize, had mentioned giving extremely outstanding individuals some extra challenges and more tempering so they could become great in the future, even specifically naming Qin Ming. However, his uncle had also seriously warned him not to cross the red line and to act within the rules.

"We'll talk more later," Zhou Tao turned and left. He couldn't show favoritism; he still needed to check on the three young Abnormals: Zhuo Ya, Cao Wuji, and Cui Chongxuan.

"All of you are uncut jade. As long as you master the Six Emperors' Strength, whether it's a White Jiao or a Golden Rhinoceros, with your foundations, you can defeat them all!" Zhou Tao immediately gave them the strongest confidence.

Cao Wuji's eyes immediately lit up. What he lacked most was a cultivation method renowned throughout the Night Mist World. He had Abnormal-level potential but no matching Heavenlight Strength.

Qin Ming was also listening, seriously pondering: in the New Life stage, how many "Emperors" could the Six Emperors' Strength be cultivated to? Qin Ming had fought Cui Chongxuan on Mount Luofu and heard him say that becoming an Abnormal in the New Life stage and mastering two "Emperors' Strengths" was considered success. This "success" likely meant passing the threshold. Could anyone master three "Emperors' Strengths" in the New Life realm? As he thought about this, Qin Ming's brows furrowed. If this speculation was true, he couldn't be complacent and needed to work hard to improve himself. Because when he fused two wondrous arts and a dozen types of Heavenlight Strength, he could suppress Cui Chongxuan, who had mastered one "Emperors' Strength." If someone mastered three "Emperors' Strengths," would he need to fuse six wondrous arts and thirty or forty types of Heavenlight Strength?

"The road ahead is long, and I still need to work hard!" Qin Ming was this simple-minded; he would rather overestimate the Abnormals raised in the Ancestral Court than underestimate potential formidable opponents.

"Don't worry, it's not too late for you to learn the Six Emperors' Strength in the Outer Saint realm. You will still undergo a complete metamorphosis. That's the beauty of the Six Emperors' Heart Sutra. Our Fourth Ancestor, Junior Ancestor, and others started even later than you, yet achieved even greater things." The Fourth Ancestor and Junior Ancestor Zhou Tao referred to were the Ancestor Master's fourth disciple and final disciple. This was the truth: it was never too late to learn the Six Emperors' Heart Sutra!

"To be safe, in the New Life stage, I need to fuse at least six wondrous arts!" Qin Ming mused.

After cordial conversations with the group of youths, Zhou Tao came to find the exceptionally formidable young man in his eyes. He took a deep breath, shifting his mindset. This truly might be an Ancestor of Revitalization!

"Elder Zhou, when I slew an ancient demon, I found its horn extraordinary. It can detoxify and nourish medicinal properties. I polished it into a cup and would like to offer it to you as thanks for your care," Qin Ming said with a smile, handing over a golden, translucent rhino horn cup.

Zhou Tao took it, finding it "hot to handle" and almost dropping it, because it was the horn of the Golden Rhinoceros, the same "wild medicine" that his uncle, Zhou Shize, was cultivating. If Old Zhou saw him using such a cup to drink tea, he'd probably want to slap him.

"Alright, this is an excellent gift. I accept it," he said with a smile, nodding and tucking it into his robes. He just wouldn't let Old Zhou see it when he got back. Afterwards, he became serious and said, "For this assessment, I will give you the highest evaluation. I believe your performance is at the level of a Young Cult Master, and even rating you as a Junior Ancestor wouldn't be out of the question. But I maintain my previous stance: keep it concealed for now, don't publicize it, or I worry that the Six Emperors' adversaries might target you."

"I will follow Elder's commands," Qin Ming nodded.

Zhou Tao secretly calculated: this youth was already stronger than a top-tier Abnormal, and coupled with continuously refining various wondrous bloods, his natural endowment... was likely already directly chasing that of a Junior Ancestor! He even suspected, could this perhaps be a future Ancestor-level figure?!

Zhou Tao said, "I've seen some of the prey you've slain. Your Heavenlight Strength is indeed exceptionally formidable. However, some Heavenlight Strengths in the world are only extraordinary in the New Life and Outer Saint realms; they don't have sustainable chapters. Such combinations of Heavenlight Strength simply cannot reach the end and will get obstructed halfway. Our Six Emperors Ancestral Court's cultivation method, however, can help you achieve your lofty ambitions, ranking among the foremost in every major realm, with only a few other inheritances able to rival it." Having thoroughly studied the Six Emperors' Heart Sutra, he understood Heavenlight Strength more deeply than the high-level anomalous beings, White Peacock and Black Crane. Therefore, he immediately concluded that this young man had not studied the Six Emperors' Strength with Cui Chongxuan.

Qin Ming nodded solemnly. Whether he went to the Six Emperors Ancestral Court or not, he had to display immense anticipation now.

After Zhou Tao figured it out, his attitude towards Qin Ming completely changed. If this truly was an Ancestor of Revitalization, when else should he get close? He believed this could also be considered a happy outcome for all.

Subsequently, White Peacock and Black Crane came over and chatted with Qin Ming, looking at him with new respect. However, neither of them stayed long, to avoid drawing attention from those with ulterior motives who might find their attitude towards Qin Ming unusually abnormal.

The next day, as the night mist surged, White Peacock and Black Crane carried a group of people, embarking on their return journey.

Zhou Tao's mood was complex; ultimately, he alone bore the weight of everything. He was wondering how to explain the matter of the wondrous medicines to the elders when he returned.

Qin Ming was full of anticipation, as both Zhou Tao and White Peacock had said they would fulfill their promise upon returning, allowing them to go to the Six Emperors' Enlightenment Ground to comprehend an extremely powerful cultivation method.

The dark world was vast and boundless. The two flying mounts were incredibly fast; forty thousand *li* was not a challenge for them.

The Six Emperors Ancestral Court was in sight, and the group returned.
