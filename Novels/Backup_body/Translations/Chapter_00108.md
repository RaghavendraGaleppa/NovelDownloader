**Fortune:**  
Upon cultivating the *Great Yan Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi* and breaking through to the Human Immortal Realm, the sword qi will become too sharp, tearing through the body, leaving countless wounds, rupturing organs, and disfiguring the face!  

Afterwards, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord will be enraged, dismembering the body, grinding bones to dust—leaving no intact corpse!  

**Methods to Alter Fate:**  
1. Obtain the secret inheritance of the Eastern Sea's Nine Spirits Immortal Island—the *Supreme Unity Sword Refining Technique*.  
2. Acquire the *Heavenly Profound Great White Metallic Essence*.  
3. Using the *Supreme Unity Sword Refining Technique*, refine the *Heavenly Profound Great White Metallic Essence* into a Sword Core, transforming it into a life-bound treasure. Prosperity and ruin shall be shared—thus completely subduing the *Great Yan Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi* and averting the inevitable calamity!

"Nine Spirits Immortal Island in the Eastern Sea? The *Supreme Unity Sword Refining Technique*? *Heavenly Profound Great White Metallic Essence*?"  

Li Zhengjing was stunned for a long moment before finally realizing the truth. He cursed inwardly, *"So everyone has been treating the* Great Yan Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi *as a sword technique to cultivate... when in reality, it's the foundational method for refining a Sword Core?"*  

Now he understood why all past cultivators of the Kunlun Immortal Sect had met inevitable deaths—they had all been wrong!  

And so had he!  

Even the seemingly omniscient and omnipotent Thousand Illusions Divine Lord had been mistaken!  

The *Great Yan Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi* was never meant to be cultivated within one's body!  

This thing was meant to refine a life-bound Sword Core!  

Only by obtaining the *Supreme Unity Sword Refining Technique* and refining the *Heavenly Profound Great White Metallic Essence* into a Sword Core could one safely cultivate the *Great Yan Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi* and avoid being devoured by its backlash!  

Only then could one escape the fate of being riddled with holes, organs ruptured, and left without a whole corpse!  

*"Do I need to make a trip to the Eastern Sea? And how exactly do I obtain the* Heavenly Profound Great White Metallic Essence*?"*  

As Li Zhengjing pondered this, he glanced at the golden page's fortune section, certain that it would contain detailed methods to alter his fate.  

Just like when his *Internal Organ Qi Nurturing Technique* was incomplete, the golden page had revealed the exact time and place to place strong liquor and when to use a sack to capture the Five Elements Creation Tree.  

But now, the golden page still hadn't displayed any specific details.  

*"Still not enough spiritual energy!"*  

Li Zhengjing once again transformed into a ravenous devourer, diving headfirst into a mountain of spirit stones.  

He lost count of how many spirit stones he consumed, grabbing them one after another and stuffing them into his mouth. After emptying one mountain, he immediately moved to the next.  

Only when a young Daoist's voice echoed from outside did he pause.  

"Immortal Venerable Zhengjing, you entered yesterday. It is already past noon today."  

"That fast?"  

Li Zhengjing hadn't realized that he had been eating nonstop for an entire day and night.  

He took a deep breath and looked back.  

Behind him was a vast empty space.  

Wiping his mouth, he thought, *"The National Preceptor was so generous—he probably won't get mad, right?"*  

With that thought, he continued stuffing spirit stones into his mouth.  

Only after repeated urgings from outside—when it seemed the National Preceptor's disciple could no longer resist opening the formation to investigate—did Li Zhengjing reluctantly leave, turning away without hesitation.  

But his true qi, guided by the *Feather Transformation Dragon Riding Immortal Technique*, condensed into over two hundred tiny dragons that burrowed into the spirit stone mountain.  

As he walked toward the treasury exit, his true qi continued to plunder spirit stones, delivering them to his mouth.  

The open space ahead was vast.  

Li Zhengjing walked slowly.  

By the time he leisurely crossed the open space and reached the treasury gates, he had devoured yet another mountain of spirit stones.  

Before stepping out, he glanced at the golden page and felt a surge of joy.  

The remaining spirit stones were now used for cultivation!  

With each step, the roar of tigers and dragons echoed.  

With every stride, another aperture in his body shattered.  

By the time he stepped out of the treasury gates, he had broken through 273 apertures.  

Until he resolved the backlash of the *Great Yan Void-Shattering Myriad Transformations Sword Qi*, he wouldn't recklessly push to the peak of the True Qi Realm. Although it wouldn't kill him, having sword qi constantly slicing through his body was no pleasant experience—akin to being slowly flayed alive.  

As he stepped out of the treasury, the young Daoist bowed deeply, far more respectfully than ever before.  

"Has the Immortal Venerable obtained what he sought?"  

"I have, I have."  

Li Zhengjing grinned brightly and waved his hand. "What about the library? My bird and tree went in there—they've been reading for a day. It's time for a break. Let's go home."  

"They came out a short while ago and are waiting for you ahead," the young Daoist replied, then hesitated. "What exactly did the Immortal Venerable take from inside?"  

Li Zhengjing coughed and glanced around sheepishly. "Why do you ask?"  

The young Daoist lowered his voice. "Every item in the national treasury—even every single spirit stone—must be accounted for. We'll need to conduct an inventory later to ensure nothing is missing."  

Li Zhengjing waved dismissively. "I didn't take any world-shaking treasures. Just refined some spirit stones, that's all."  

"Spirit stones?"  

The young Daoist was stunned. "The Immortal Venerable entered the national treasury just to refine some spirit stones?"  

He was genuinely surprised. Previously, even the National Preceptor had assumed Li Zhengjing would take some legendary treasure.  

As for spirit stones—how many could even a Human Immortal refine in a single day?  

If it was just spirit stones, Li Zhengjing could have simply asked, and they would have gifted him an entire mountain. Why go through all this trouble?  

"Why would I lie to you?"  

Li Zhengjing waved again. "I'm heading home now. Tell the National Preceptor I won't be staying for dinner. For the next few days, he shouldn't look for me if there's nothing urgent—and definitely not if there is."  

"..."  

Watching Li Zhengjing leave, the young Daoist suddenly felt a sense of unease.  

He hurriedly opened the treasury and rushed inside.  

A short while later, the young Daoist emerged, looking utterly devastated, as if his soul had left his body.  

His eyes were vacant, his face pale, and his expression dazed.  

He stumbled into the main hall to seek an audience with the National Preceptor. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.  

"Li Zhengjing left?"  

The National Preceptor remained calm.  

The young Daoist swallowed hard before replying weakly, "Yes."  

The National Preceptor frowned. "What's wrong with you?"  

The young Daoist hesitated, then muttered, "Li Zhengjing... he..."  

The National Preceptor's frown deepened. "What about him? Did he consume some rare treasure from the treasury? I already said—as long as it's not a national treasure, he could take anything. What did he take?"  

The young Daoist lowered his head. "Spirit stones."  

The National Preceptor was even more surprised. "Just spirit stones? How much could he refine in a single day? If that's all, we could have just given him a mountain of them. Why are you acting like this? So what if he refined some? As a direct disciple of the National Preceptor's estate, what kind of scene haven't you witnessed? You're embarrassing us!"  

The young Daoist looked up, trembling. "He went in alone and came out alone... but he refined a lot of spirit stones..."  

The National Preceptor remained composed. "Did he refine an entire mountain? That would indeed be unbelievable..."  

The young Daoist's throat was parched, his emotions in turmoil. He could only raise three fingers.  

"Three mountains?" The National Preceptor's expression shifted.  

"At least... three hundred." The young Daoist's breathing hitched. "The treasury... only has a few dozen mountains left..."  

"..."  

The National Preceptor fell silent for a long time before finally speaking, his voice now hoarse. "No one could refine three hundred mountains of spirit stones in a single day. He'd ascend to immortality on the spot!"  

"But three hundred mountains are indeed missing."  

The young Daoist's voice trembled with despair. "This was the Great Zhou Dynasty's accumulation over centuries..."  

"If this gets out, His Majesty may suspect our estate embezzled the treasury's spirit stones."  

After another long silence, the National Preceptor said, "Take me there. I'll conduct the inventory myself."  

His gaze at the young Daoist held a trace of doubt.  

*Who the hell eats three hundred mountains of spirit stones in a single day?*  

*Unless Li Zhengjing only ate one mountain, and this kid reported three hundred to pocket the rest?*  

But he wouldn't dare!  

---

That day, Immortal Venerable Zhengjing left the national treasury.  

Then the National Preceptor entered.  

And then, the National Preceptor fell ill.  

But rumors spread that he had gone mad—because he immediately ordered all generals, officials, deities, and spirit stone mines across the land to transport vast quantities of spirit stones to the capital. Those who disobeyed would be treated as rebels, and divine generals would lead armies to suppress them!  

Meanwhile, at the Marquis Jian'an estate...  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page and sighed in relief.  

He had been slightly worried the National Preceptor might actually go insane and besiege the estate.  

Fortunately, the madness hadn't gone that far.  

"Old Yuan, did you uncover anything?"  

"Only rumors, nothing concrete," Yuan Zhengfeng replied.  

"Master! Master!" The wall-clinging bird poked its head out, eager to boast. "I found records about the Creditor in the Great Zhou archives. The oldest mention dates back 3,800 years!"  

"But records of the Human Realm's Dao Ancestor go back 4,800 years," Yuan Zhengfeng interjected.  

"4,800 years?" Li Zhengjing frowned.  

"That Dao Ancestor was once the world's strongest, with power rivaling a sect master," Yuan Zhengfeng explained. "But for unknown reasons, he slaughtered his entire sect..."  

"That sect was called the Illusion Divine Immortal Sect, located where the Luofu Immortal Sect now stands," the bird added. "Originally, Luofu was just a top-tier sect, not yet an immortal one. But after inheriting the ancient sect's treasures, it rose to immortal status!"  

"That's why the current Violet Mist Dao Sect wants to emulate that and replace the declining Luofu," Yuan Zhengfeng said.  

"Illusion Divine Immortal Sect?" Li Zhengjing mused. "Then why was he called the Human Realm's Dao Ancestor?"  

"Rumors say he wielded a broken sword to slay countless experts, invincible in his prime. In his later years, he preached the Dao to the world," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "Even the ancestors of the three immortal sects and the two Buddhist sects once studied under him..."  

"Not just them—cultivators from overseas, southern tribal leaders, the frozen lands north of Fengdu Mountain, and the western deserts all came to pay homage," the bird chimed in. "Back then, the Central Continent was the world's most prosperous cultivation holy land—not just for humans, but all living beings!"  

"And then?" Li Zhengjing pressed.  

"And then... nothing." The bird sighed. "No further records."  

"A Dao Ancestor from 4,800 years ago..." Li Zhengjing fell silent.  

"I suspect the Creditor who stormed the Netherworld merely borrowed the title, not the original figure," Yuan Zhengfeng speculated.  

"Earlier, we thought the earliest Creditor lived about 4,000 years. But if he appeared even earlier, it wouldn't be impossible," Li Zhengjing reasoned.  

"Master, are you saying this 'Dao Ancestor' spread his 'opportunities' under the guise of preaching, cultivating them through powerful figures?" the bird asked.  

"Ancient history is hard to verify," Li Zhengjing said. "But later, the Creditor became more subtle—many recipients thought they stumbled upon fortuitous encounters, unaware it was a trap."  

"Perhaps after the Dao Ancestor's overt methods, he switched to secrecy?" Yuan Zhengfeng pondered. "But could someone truly live for 4,800 years?"  

"What are you implying?" Li Zhengjing asked.  

"After killing the Creditor in the Fallen Dragon Realm, I considered that the true Creditor might not be a single immortal being, but a lineage passed down through generations," Yuan Zhengfeng said.  

"The one in the Fallen Dragon Realm—even the Ten Thousand Realms Salvation Heavenly Venerate—might just be debtors who received 'opportunities.'"  

He sighed. "Unless we can prove the existence of an immortal being."  

Just then, a streak of light suddenly appeared, landing on the bird's head.  

The light unfolded, revealing Ghost Valley Lingguan's voice:  

"Immortal beings do exist. The current Yuan Zhengfeng can live forever!"  

"Senior Ghost Valley?" Li Zhengjing was startled. "Aren't you back on the Salvation Golden Ship?"  

"Don't ask. Meet me outside the city," Ghost Valley Lingguan said wearily. "Three days ago, I recommended you to the Salvation Golden Ship, hoping they'd protect you. But now, after you ruined the Heavenly Venerate's plans and left him severely injured... I'm implicated too. I fled and am being hunted!"
