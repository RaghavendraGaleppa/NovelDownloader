# Chapter 16: The Competition System

Early the next morning, Zhou Tian was pulled out of bed by his father.

"Can't you wait until I'm up to talk about it?!" Zhou Tian, still groggy, rubbed some sleep from his eyes and complained, his face full of reluctance. He was just a mortal, without any cultivation base, and needed enough sleep every day!

"You have the nerve to say that! Look at the time! How come you woke up so early yesterday to find Tianling!" Zhou Yi was utterly exasperated.

"Alright, alright, what is it exactly?" Zhou Tian yawned as he asked. If it was nothing important, he wanted to go back to sleep. Last night, his dreams were filled with scenes of Tianling drenched in sweat, almost draining him dry.

"What is it?!" Zhou Yi's voice rose three octaves, his eyes wide as bronze bells. "Didn't Uncle Zhou tell you last night? His Majesty is summoning you and Tianling today!"

Zhou Tian scratched his head. Uncle Zhou did seem to have mentioned it last night, but at the time, his mind was completely filled with Tianling's wet allure. Summoned? Summoned for what? His mind was completely elsewhere, and he promptly forgot.

Zhou Tian showed an awkward yet polite smile and said, "I knew why I heard magpies chirping early this morning! It turns out His Majesty is summoning me!"

Suppressing the urge to smack his son dead, Zhou Yi tried his best to control his emotions and said, "Hurry up and come with me!"

"Okay, okay..."

After waiting a moment, Zhou Tian finished washing up and changing clothes, then followed Zhou Yi to the living room. Tianling was already waiting there. Someone had informed her yesterday as well. She wasn't like Zhou Tian; upon hearing of the Qin Emperor's summons, not only did she not forget, but she hadn't even rested well...

Seeing Tianling there, Zhou Tian's spirits immediately lifted, and he chuckled, "Ling'er, you're up quite early."

Hearing his intimate address, Tianling's pretty face flushed slightly. She glanced at Zhou Yi, who was standing beside them, feeling a bit embarrassed in front of Zhou Tian's father.

"Mhm..." She just nodded, too shy to say more.

"Alright, alright, Zhou Tian, you have the nerve to say that! If it weren't for you, we would have left long ago!" Zhou Yi said to Zhou Tian. He was so pleasant to pretty girls, yet so rude to his own father.

Zhou Yi didn't dally. He led them out of the living room and towards the main gate, where a carriage was already waiting.

Seeing the carriage parked in front of the gate, Zhou Tian's jaw nearly dropped to the floor. Nine purple exotic beasts pulled a golden carriage, arranged in three rows of three. The exotic beasts were about three meters tall, with lion heads, deer antlers, tiger eyes, elk bodies, dragon scales, and ox tails, resembling Qilins. They were incredibly robust, their muscles like gnarled ancient roots. Purple divine light flowed across their bodies, and their scales bore arcane patterns.

The carriage itself was the epitome of luxury, topped with a golden canopy from which four corners hung glazed golden ornaments, shimmering with golden divine light. Dragons and phoenixes were carved onto the red carriage walls, outlined with gold thread, radiating an almost lifelike spirituality as if they were about to fly off.

Looking at this carriage, then recalling the one he rode yesterday, it was truly the difference between a bicycle and a sports car.

Swallowing, Zhou Tian said, "Father, this thing, you..." At that moment, Zhou Tian just wanted to cling to Zhou Yi's leg and call him "Daddy," thinking, 'Blood is thicker than water!'

"Don't even think about it!" Zhou Yi interrupted him before Zhou Tian could finish. "This is my carriage as the Prince of Qin. It's fine for me to take you, but if you were to ride it yourself, those old ministers who view rules as their very lives would probably chew you out!"

"Alright..." Zhou Tian said, feeling disappointed. He suddenly felt a gap reappear between him and Zhou Yi. After all, he was a transmigrator; that mental hurdle was still difficult to overcome... sigh...

The group boarded the carriage. The purple exotic beasts roared skyward, stepped on purple thunderclouds, and soared into the air, flying towards the Imperial Palace.

Flying within the Imperial Palace was forbidden, though that was relative. After all, if the Qin Emperor needed to leave the palace, he couldn't possibly walk, so mounts of the third rank and above were permitted to fly through the void.

The carriage wasn't moving too fast. These Purple-Scaled Dragon Beasts contained a trace of a divine dragon's bloodline, and their strength had already reached the Manifestation Realm. If they traveled at full speed, the thundercloud storm they stirred up would be enough to engulf the entire Imperial City. Zhou Yi didn't want to be furiously criticized by the ministers.

Sitting in the carriage, Zhou Tian's gaze was unfocused as he recalled memories of the Qin Emperor from his own mind.

As the ruling family of the Great Qin Empire, and the only power among the Nine Provinces to govern an entire province in the form of an empire, they had their unique aspects. Firstly, there was their succession system. The Great Qin Empire's throne did not follow an ordinary inheritance system, but rather a competition system. This world possessed transcendent power; it was not difficult for profound cultivators to live for several millennia, let alone the Qin Emperor, who governed an entire nation. His lifespan was terrifyingly long. During his reign, not only his sons but even his grandsons would have grown old. Thus, a conventional primogeniture system was definitely unworkable and had significant drawbacks.

Therefore, the competition system was established. As long as you were outstanding enough and gained the recognition of the Zhou family's clan elders, you could become the Emperor. While it seemed simple and perfunctory, it was actually not that simple. The Emperor of the Great Qin Empire was also the Head of the Zhou family. In Zhou Tian's memory, the Zhou family had a saying: "It is the Zhou family that forged the Great Qin, not the Great Qin that forged the Zhou family!" The super force standing tall in Futian Province was more accurately the Zhou family than the Great Qin Empire.

The so-called competition system was not like the deadly struggles seen in the palace dramas of Zhou Tian's previous life. The Zhou family's clan elders were not blind; they would never allow such things to happen. All you had to do was showcase yourself as much as possible, revealing your excellent qualities. The Zhou family's clan elders naturally had their own criteria for judgment. Forming factions or seeking external forces to support oneself was utterly useless—what power could be greater than the Zhou family itself? Not to mention plotting against brothers or infighting among fellow clan members; that was simply courting death.

Interestingly, not all Zhou family members aspired to be emperor. According to Zhou family records, there were many who were selected by the clan elders but were unwilling to take on the role of emperor. Not everyone craved power. Becoming emperor would significantly reduce the time available for cultivation, delaying their path to becoming stronger, so they would decline the offer. Therefore, the relationships among the Zhou family disciples were relatively harmonious. Although there was competition among them, it was all healthy competition.

The relationship between the Prince of Qin and the Qin Emperor was even better; they were true brothers. It was said that at the time, the clan elders hesitated for a long time between Zhou Yi and the current Qin Emperor. It was due to Zhou Yi's more restless nature in his youth, while the Qin Emperor was more composed, that the clan elders chose the Qin Emperor and passed over Zhou Yi.

The distance between the Prince of Qin's Residence and the Imperial Palace wasn't too far. After only a moment, the carriage descended from the sky. Any further ahead was the Imperial Palace itself. Even the Prince of Qin was not permitted to fly directly over the Imperial Palace.
