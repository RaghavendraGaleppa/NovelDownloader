Chapter 86: A Brand New Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol, Nascent Soul Stage

The Humanoid Weapon merges into the True Adamant Dharma Idol!

The moment this idea arose, it spread like wildfire, uncontrollable for Yang Ji, whose mind was now filled with this very thought. With such a strong subconscious urge, Yang Ji immediately set about implementing it without hesitation. As soon as the Humanoid Weapon began to operate, golden tadpole runes continuously poured into the True Adamant Dharma Idol. The two profound mysteries fused, and although there was some resistance in the process, it continued slowly under the constant error correction and improvement of his 'Golden Finger'. As the profound meanings of the two cultivation techniques continued to merge, a completely new Dharma Idol was being systematically constructed.

A year passed.

*Hum!*

After the last golden tadpole rune integrated into the True Adamant Dharma Idol, a slight tremor occurred, shaking both the celestial and terrestrial energies, and visible ripples immediately spread through the air. The Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol was now covered in armor, resembling a deity, mighty and extraordinary. The power it exuded was dozens of times more formidable than before. Upon closer inspection, the intricately woven, tightly connected golden chainmail covering its body was precisely the golden tadpole runes integrated into the True Adamant Dharma Idol. This was not just simple golden chainmail; Yang Ji knew that it was completely fused with the True Adamant Dharma Idol, forming a single entity, capable of connecting with even vaster celestial and terrestrial energies. Standing before him now, the entire space trembled. Just by its mere presence, the power of heaven and earth gathered towards it—it was truly extraordinary. Although Yang Ji had never witnessed Heaven and Earth Dharma Idols condensed from supreme Dao-level cultivation techniques, his subconscious told him that the brand new Dharma Idol he had condensed might not be inferior to theirs. Yang Ji looked at the Dharma Idol before him, utterly satisfied.

Just as the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol completely stabilized, a terrifying pressure suddenly assailed him from the depths of his soul, as if from the unseen realms.

*Whoosh—*

Within his Sea of Consciousness, a fierce wind suddenly arose, a tearing gale with the terrifying power to scrape the ground a hundred feet deep and erode mountains into dust.

"The Wind Tribulation!"

Yang Ji knew that his first divine tribulation had arrived. If his Nascent Soul passed this tribulation, he could break through to the Nascent Soul stage, gaining a lifespan of twelve hundred years. The Wind Tribulation was a tribulation of heaven and earth, specifically targeting the Nascent Soul, and extremely potent. Those with weak Nascent Souls, if even slightly careless, would be blown into scattered soul light, their very existence extinguished. Some peak Golden Core cultivators, despite having accumulated enough true qi to condense a Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol, were hesitant to break through precisely because they feared failing the Wind Tribulation. As the saying goes, the physical body is the boat, and the soul is the person inside the boat. While condensing a Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol would indeed invite the Wind Tribulation, the Dharma Idol itself was also the "boat" that protected the Nascent Soul from its harm.

Yang Ji had no Wind Tribulation Pills, nor did he deign to use them, because he had cultivated the Humanoid Weapon, making his Nascent Soul several times stronger than that of ordinary cultivators. Generally speaking, upon passing the Wind Tribulation, the Nascent Soul would transform from a translucent state into a visible Yin God. Although a Yin God was visible to the naked eye, it remained ethereal like air, untouchable by physical hands. After passing the Fire Tribulation, the Yin God would become a Yang God. A Yang God was far more powerful than a Yin God; at this stage, it could be touched by physical hands, possessing a tangible feel akin to a human body. After passing the Lightning Tribulation, the Yang God would evolve into a Pure Yang Nascent Soul. At this point, the Nascent Soul would be identical to a human body and could survive independently, separated from the physical body. With its Nascent Soul out of the body, a single thought could traverse a thousand *li*, killing unseen. Some powerful Nascent Soul cultivators, upon reaching this stage, could even achieve soul-splitting abilities, cultivating external avatars, essentially living two lives, which was extremely formidable.

To achieve Soul Transformation, a Pure Yang Nascent Soul was a necessary step. This was because only the consciousness of a Pure Yang Nascent Soul could travel to the ends of the world, reach the Immortal Realm, and draw down the Dao Qi that contained the profound meanings of the Great Dao from within. Dao Qi was the energy used to condense the immortal body of a Soul Transformation expert, and also the energy for forming a nascent world. Only when the physical body completely transformed into a Dao Body could it bear the Great Dao that had been comprehended. One could say that the Nascent Soul stage refined the spirit, while the Soul Transformation stage refined the body. Only with a Pure Yang Nascent Soul and a Dao Body could one touch the Great Dao and qualify to comprehend it.

Yang Ji's Nascent Soul strength had already reached the peak of the Yin God stage. To progress further and allow his Nascent Soul to undergo a perfect transformation, he chose not to use the Wind Tribulation Pill. For heavenly tribulations were "calamities," yet also opportunities for creation. To face the heavenly tribulation head-on without protection and achieve a perfect advancement was an almost universal practice among geniuses. Even so, Yang Ji dared not be overconfident; his expression grew solemn, unwilling to fail at this crucial juncture.

The fierce wind raged within his Sea of Consciousness. He immediately controlled his Nascent Soul to fly into the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol.

*Hum—*

*Whoosh whoosh whoosh!*

The fierce wind roared, ferociously striking and scraping against the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol. Protected by the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol, most of the fierce wind that surged out from his Sea of Consciousness was immediately blocked. However, a small portion still pierced into the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol and struck his Nascent Soul. Yang Ji's Nascent Soul was powerful; he made no unnecessary movements, allowing the fierce wind to buffet him, undergoing a perfect baptism and a perfect transformation. The fierce wind blew for a full thirty breaths before its energy was finally depleted and it slowly dissipated. But before Yang Ji could make a move...

*Whoosh whoosh whoosh—*

The sound of fierce wind resounded once more. He fixed his gaze and saw a wind spear condensing between heaven and earth. It was faintly wreathed in white spiritual light, exuding a terrifying aura as if it could pierce through space. It transformed into a streak of flowing light, rapidly shooting towards the Nascent Soul within the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol.

"Hadn't the Wind Tribulation already passed? Why is there more?"

Yang Ji was slightly surprised. Seeing the fierce approach of the wind spear, he dared not be overconfident and immediately activated his Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol to slap at it.

*Swish!*

The Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol collided with the wind spear. Although some energy was weakened, the heavenly tribulation seemed unstoppable, directly piercing through the Dharma Idol and heading straight for the Nascent Soul. Seeing this, Yang Ji began to activate his Nascent Soul to resist. The wind spear collided with his Nascent Soul, and dazzling ripples of energy overflowed, instantly making the entire Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol's interior vibrant and resplendent. Behind this splendor lay Yang Ji's perseverance; he used his Nascent Soul to directly clash with the wind spear, making himself even stronger. The wind spear and the Nascent Soul contended for three breaths before its energy was finally depleted and it dissipated.

Before Yang Ji could even sigh in relief, his nerves tightened again the next moment.

*Whoosh whoosh whoosh—*

Fierce winds churned between heaven and earth; this Wind Tribulation was even more violent than the previous two. In the blink of an eye, a massive wind giant condensed before the Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol. It was like an enraged Vajra, with a cold expression, holding a colossal wind blade in its hand, its entire body radiating a destructive aura. Yang Ji's expression turned stern. He had not anticipated there would be yet another Wind Tribulation. By conventional understanding, there was only one Wind Tribulation, but he was facing three. Perhaps it was because his Nascent Soul and Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol were relatively powerful, thus attracting two additional Wind Tribulations? There was no time for further thought. What greeted him was a descending wind blade.

Yang Ji felt no fear; instead, a faint excitement stirred within him. Three Wind Tribulations were rare; though terrifying, if he passed them, he would become even stronger. "Come on, let my Nascent Soul transform again."

Yang Ji activated his Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol to resist. However, as this blade struck down, it seemed irresistibly destined, piercing through the Dharma Idol and directly cutting down upon his Nascent Soul. A look of pain suddenly appeared on Yang Ji's face. Although the wind blade did not cleave his Nascent Soul apart, a soul-corroding fierce wind invaded its interior. The fierce wind rampaged wildly within his Nascent Soul, and in an instant, cracks appeared on its surface. Yet Yang Ji showed no fear or panic, stubbornly enduring.

Thirty breaths later, the Wind Tribulation dissipated. His Nascent Soul was like cracked porcelain, covered in fissures. But the very next moment, a mysterious Dao rhyme quietly surged from within his Nascent Soul, rapidly enveloping the entire spirit. Under the nourishment of the Dao rhyme, the cracks on the surface of his Nascent Soul repaired themselves at a visible pace. In just three breaths, his Nascent Soul was completely restored. After the baptism of the Wind Tribulation and the restoration by the Dao rhyme, his Nascent Soul surprisingly became flawless and pure, imbued with an inexplicable aura of the Great Dao, and emanated a faint spiritual light, becoming even more sacred.

At this moment, two words appeared in Yang Ji's mind—Yang God. Yes, his Nascent Soul was now even more powerful, having transformed into a Yang God. "Indeed, what the books said is true. The Wind Tribulation is a calamity, yet also a profound opportunity," Yang Ji muttered, staring at his Nascent Soul with dawning comprehension. "From now on, I am a true Nascent Soul True Monarch, aren't I?"

After breaking through, he felt both his Nascent Soul and Dharma Idol had undergone sublimation and transformation. In the unseen realms, he sensed his lifespan had greatly increased, reaching a maximum of over twelve hundred years. Over a thousand years. At first glance, it might seem short, but as time flowed, who knew how many times secular dynasties would change within those thousand-plus years? One must remember that the known history unearthed from ancient China was only just over five thousand years; thus, the immense significance of these thousand-plus years was clear. Yang Ji was quite pleased. With his Nascent Soul formed, he was one step closer to longevity.

At this moment, after carefully sensing his cultivation, he looked at his own status.

[Name: Yang Ji]
[Root Bone: Medium]
[Lifespan: 124/1200]
[Cultivation Realm: Nascent Soul Stage One (0/27,648,000)]
[Cultivation Techniques: Ling Water Art (Low-grade), True Adamant Divine Art (Dao-grade)]
[Grand Divine Abilities: Humanoid Weapon [Volume One] (Mastered), [Volume Two] (Great Accomplishment)]
[Grand Divine Abilities: Zhou Tian Teleportation (Mastered)]
[Grand Divine Abilities: Gui Zang Sword Art [Li Sword Dao (Mastered Sword Soul)], [Zhen Sword Dao (Mastered Sword Soul)], [Xun Sword Dao (Mastered Sword Soul)], [Dui Sword Dao (Mastered Sword Soul)]]
[Spells: Following Water Sword Art (Mastered), Light Body Technique (Mastered)]

Currently, breaking through to the next realm would require over twenty million cultivation points. If he had a Nine Revolutions Golden Core to consume, it would take around over a hundred years. These hundred-plus years were neither long nor short. But Yang Ji didn't want to waste time idly. He decided to make a trip to the Hell Refinement Ground. If he could find a Purple Sun Fruit to enhance his root bone, his cultivation speed would greatly increase, essentially gaining back decades of lifespan for free. No one disregarded lifespan, and Yang Ji was no exception.
