# Chapter 25: A Startling Turn of Luck

The exploding light of the treasure, like a monstrous tidal wave, instantly tore through the formation set up by Immortaless Qingchen, then engulfed Lu Yang, Liu Xin, and Chen Xin'an.

Liu Xin was the first to scream. To deal with Lu Yang, he had successively summoned banner spirits, and finally inviting Chen Xin'an had consumed most of his True Qi. At this moment, he was utterly powerless to resist the impact of the explosion. His body instantly ignited, then turned to ashes, his Myriad Spirits Banner falling limply through the air.

"As expected of a disciple of my Sacred Sect..."

With Liu Xin's death, though Chen Xin'an still had some strength to maintain himself, he could no longer sustain his existence. He let out a long sigh, then dispersed with the wind.

As for Lu Yang, he was directly swallowed by the treasure's light, vanishing without a trace.

It was a while before the turbulent light gradually subsided, revealing Xiao Shiye's figure, his face alight with intense elation.

"I won!"

Xiao Shiye laughed excitedly. Although self-detonating a Spirit Treasure was his trump card, it actually had many limitations and was very easy for opponents to evade.

To kill an enemy with this move, one first needed to restrict the battlefield to ensure a hit.

Secondly, the explosion's power couldn't be concentrated; it had a large range but was too dispersed. Therefore, the enemy had to be weakened to a certain extent to ensure a one-hit kill.

Lastly, Spirit Treasures possessed self-awareness and might not cooperate with self-detonation.

"Good thing luck is still on my side!"

Xiao Shiye felt as if his luck had completely turned around ever since he joined the Primeval Sacred Sect. He got everything he wanted, and whatever he did seemed divinely aided.

When speculating on Substitute Death Puppets, his luck was so good that he sold at the peak, earning hundreds of thousands of contribution points.

He casually went to the mortal realm and effortlessly picked up a Magic Treasure left behind by a predecessor.

When being chased, he coincidentally met Lu Yang, who served as a perfect shield.

No matter what kind of crisis he encountered, the result was always that he emerged unscathed after a series of coincidences, ultimately reaping the greatest benefits.

"What a Myriad Spirits Banner. From now on, it's mine."

Xiao Shiye was about to step forward to retrieve the treasure, but almost simultaneously, a figure wreathed in blood-red light appeared beside him, also reaching out to grab the banner.

Seeing this, Xiao Shiye froze instantly, then his whole body began to tremble.

"Oh? Does Brother Xiao also want this Magic Treasure?"

The blood shadow rippled, then Lu Yang's face slowly materialized. He turned to Xiao Shiye and grinned, startling Xiao Shiye so much that his body convulsed.

Are you human or ghost?

Xiao Shiye's face turned ashen white. Looking at the Blood-Fiend Divine Light swirling around Lu Yang, the images of the various figures he had drained into husks flashed through his mind.

The next second, he hastily let go of the Myriad Spirits Banner and bowed respectfully. "Congratulations, Senior Brother! This is the Myriad Spirits Banner that Junior Brother was safekeeping for you. Now, it is returned to its rightful owner!"

"Thoughtful of you."

Lu Yang smilingly took the "Innate One Qi Myriad Spirits Banner," examined it for a moment, then injected True Qi into it, extracting two storage bags.

These were Liu Xin's and Immortaless Qingchen's storage bags.

Opening the storage bags, an "Innate Dao Scripture" was clearly visible, and besides that, a "Formation Treasure Secret Compendium," evidently belonging to Immortaless Qingchen.

"All good stuff..."

Lu Yang sighed with emotion, firmly memorizing the contents of both Dao scriptures. Then he looked at Xiao Shiye, who was retreating step by step, trying to put distance between them.

Truth be told, Xiao Shiye's killing move was indeed unexpected.

A self-detonating Spirit Treasure could potentially kill even a Qi Condensation Perfection cultivator. Theoretically, it was a sure kill, but Lu Yang was the exception among exceptions.

Because he cultivated the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light.

As a blood shadow, he was currently merely a human form, formless and without substance. His true spirit was entirely entrusted to his Sword Pill. As long as the Sword Pill wasn't destroyed, he wouldn't die.

And against Xiao Shiye's self-detonating Spirit Treasure, a Sword Pill crafted from essence gold and jade was far more durable than a mere physical body. While it wasn't entirely unscathed, it ultimately wasn't annihilated. So, after the explosion passed, Lu Yang re-materialized, reaping the greatest benefit.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang found Xiao Shiye particularly pleasing to the eye.

He truly hadn't misjudged this person earlier; this Xiao Shiye was indeed a valuable asset! Without him, how could he have gained such rich rewards?

"This time, I truly thank Junior Brother Xiao."

"To show my gratitude, Senior Brother will send you on your way now."

Lu Yang chuckled, then waved his hand. A blood-red light enveloped Xiao Shiye. Before Xiao Shiye could speak, he was drained into a human husk.

This person, keeping him alive, was simply too much of a hidden danger.

With such astonishing luck, what if he rose to power later and came back to seek revenge? So, it was better to put an end to it once and for all, nipping the problem in the bud.

"But he actually died just like that?" Lu Yang looked at Xiao Shiye's corpse, touching his chin in surprise. "With his Son of Destiny-like luck, shouldn't some noble person appear at this moment to stop me? I even prepared for it, but I didn't expect it to be so easy..."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang's heart suddenly stirred. He cast his Aura-gazing Art on Xiao Shiye again.

A bizarre scene unfolded.

Before, when he looked at Xiao Shiye, his auspicious aura shot to the sky, a clear sign of soaring luck. But now, all that auspicious aura had vanished into thin air.

Watching this, a thought inexplicably arose in Lu Yang's mind:

This person's luck is exhausted.

"Alas..."

The next second, a sigh suddenly echoed.

Lu Yang looked up at the sky, his expression freezing at the very moment surprise was about to surface. All his thoughts were suspended in that instant.

At some unknown point, a figure had appeared before Xiao Shiye's corpse.

The person wore a crane cloak, a smile on his lips, and gently fanned himself with a feather fan. His appearance was dashing and uninhibited, at first glance like a handsome scholar enjoying a spring outing.

However, with his appearance, the entire world seemed to lose its color. Only the place where he stood became the center of all things, concentrating all the blessings, wealth, and even luck of the heavens and earth. He was the darling of heaven, making people involuntarily feel jealousy and resentment.

"Is this all the harvest?"

The newcomer waved his hand. The "Innate Dao Scripture" and the Innate One Qi Myriad Spirits Banner, which Lu Yang had just put away, flew out of the storage bag and landed in his hand.

Just then, a voice abruptly transmitted, "Hongyun, you've emerged from seclusion?"

The Daoist named "Hongyun" looked up, seemingly meeting someone's gaze, and chuckled, "I had no choice. My chosen one suddenly died."

The voice sounded somewhat surprised upon hearing this, "Died? Your chosen one can die? What happened?"

"It's laughable to say, but it was due to ill timing."

"I gave him so much luck, intending for him to fish for that colorful fish in the Pool of Merit. But there were too many variables, causing his luck to be prematurely exhausted."

"When luck is exhausted, death naturally follows."

With that, Daoist Hongyun weighed the "Innate Dao Scripture" in his hand, shook his head, and casually put it away. Then he looked at Lu Yang nearby.

"This person, on the other hand, is quite interesting..."

Daoist Hongyun pinched his fingers to calculate, and the smile on his lips grew wider. "This person possesses immense variability. The recent commotion regarding the Substitute Death Puppets seems to be related to him."

"Hmm, his background is undeniably clean. But how did a mortal possess a Qi Condensation Fourth Stage cultivation at the very beginning of his entry? Deliberately hiding it, it seems he's a rogue cultivator who sought a master for tutelage. That's fine... Wait, no, he learned the Divine Firmament Sword Art before even entering the sect? Could he be a spy from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion?"

The more Daoist Hongyun calculated, the greater the interest in his eyes.

Except for the Book of One Hundred Lifetimes, all of Lu Yang's secrets were calculated by Daoist Hongyun, peeled away like layers of an onion, until finally, he frowned:

"...He cultivated the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light?"

The next second, the interest in Daoist Hongyun's eyes rapidly dissipated, replaced by an expression of "bad luck."

To transform into a blood shadow meant his immortal path was severed. Such a cultivator was naturally not worth his continued effort, nor could he assume the identity of the next "Son of Destiny."

"It's a pity about that colorful fish in the Pool of Merit. I didn't catch it this time. It seems I'll have to wait for next time."

Daoist Hongyun withdrew his gaze, then took a step, like a fisherman whose bait had run out and had no choice but to leave empty-handed. He quickly vanished without a trace.

Only Lu Yang remained standing on the spot.

Sweating profusely.
