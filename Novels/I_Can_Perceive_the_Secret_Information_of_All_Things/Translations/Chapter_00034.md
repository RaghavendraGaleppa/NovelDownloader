# Chapter 34: The Moonlit Mass Grave

That night, Xiao Ji and Song Yuanbao stayed at the Chuyun Town government office. Chang Ping, eager to strengthen ties with his fellow officers, specially prepared fine wine and dishes. While not extravagant, the meal clearly demonstrated his hospitality.

Both men were given private rooms.

Song Yuanbao felt relatively little pressure. He had merely been assigned to assist from above. If the case remained unsolved, he wouldn't bear responsibility—he just needed to do his best.

After drinking and eating, he returned to his room and immediately lay down to sleep.

Before long, he sensed someone in the room.

Opening his eyes, he saw the face of the Yuanshen Temple Taoist, his heart pounding with fright.

"You're awake!" 

Xiao Ji sat by the bed, watching Song Yuanbao.

"Taoist Xiao," Song Yuanbao retreated to the edge of the bed, clutching the quilt, and said in a low voice, "You know... I'm a man."

A misunderstanding.

"I believe you," Xiao Ji moved back slightly, pondered for a moment, and then continued, "Though we're both men, you still can't sleep in my room."

Only then did Song Yuanbao realize he had entered the wrong room... He hurriedly dressed and got up: "All the guest rooms in the Chuyun Town office look the same. I made a mistake."

"No matter," Xiao Ji's attitude remained pleasant. "Since you're here, you might as well stay."

Song Yuanbao's mood shifted again, feeling like a lamb entering a tiger's den.

Xiao Ji frowned at Song Yuanbao and said, "Let's discuss this case... Later, you'll accompany me to a place."

...

Outside Chuyun Town.

The mass grave.

The reason Xiao Ji asked Song Yuanbao to accompany him was that the town had recently imposed a curfew at night, closing the city gates. Without a special token, no one could leave.

As an invited constable, Song Yuanbao naturally had the authority to work at night. The Chuyun Town government had issued him a special pass token.

Even if Xiao Ji could manage to leave the city on his own, it would be too troublesome—avoiding patrols, climbing and jumping over city walls—making him look like a criminal.

It was much simpler to just walk out through the city gates openly.

Cold gusts of wind swept through the winter air, making the mass grave appear even more terrifying.

"Taoist Xiao, why are we coming to such a place in the dead of night?" Song Yuanbao asked, puzzled, upon seeing the mass grave.

"To solve the case," Xiao Ji replied. "What, are you scared?"

A shallow taunt, but effective.

"Of course not," Song Yuanbao raised his saber. "Walking through a mass grave at night is nothing. Once, to catch a violent criminal, I even shared a coffin with a corpse."

"Let me explain my thoughts," Xiao Ji said. Since he had brought Song Yuanbao along, he needed to provide a reasonable explanation. "I've carefully examined all three crime scenes—the Cui family and the Kaishan Escort Agency murders."

"Everyone was killed by swords, but the bodies outside the town and at the escort agency were killed using saber techniques. Cui Dubo's death was completely different from the other two scenes."

"As Constable Chang Ping speculated, there wasn't just one killer..."

Xiao Ji spoke at length, then looked at Song Yuanbao, waiting for the constable to respond.

The cold wind howled around them, and faint sounds of beasts chewing on hard objects could be heard.

After a long pause.

"Well, actually," Song Yuanbao said awkwardly, "I didn't understand."

How did you even become a constable with such poor comprehension? Xiao Ji decided to be more direct: "So, Coroner Wang Dajiu lied. He's hiding something."

"But he's a highly respected coroner in Chuyun Town," Song Yuanbao said. "For a coroner to earn the town government's respect, he must be exceptionally skilled."

"Exactly why Han Kaishan chose to work with him," Xiao Ji continued.

"Han Kaishan? Working with Coroner Wang?" Song Yuanbao was even more confused.

"Correct. The Kaishan Escort Agency was hiding a poison that weakens martial artists," Xiao Ji explained. "The dead escort members had this poison in their bodies. Han Kaishan poisoned them first, then killed them, pretending to commit suicide afterward. Before his 'suicide,' he tried to destroy the evidence but didn't finish the job. In the dry well in the backyard, there was a half-burned paper packet of poison—likely blown into the well by the wind."

"Also, in the escort agency, one of the deceased escorts had a thread from Han Kaishan's clothing under his fingernail."

"Coroner Wang Dajiu examined every body and helped Han Kaishan eliminate any evidence, but this thread was too insignificant to notice... Yet it proves Han Kaishan was present during the fight in the front courtyard, even though he claimed to have been injured in the back courtyard..."

Song Yuanbao was astonished. Though he wanted to believe Taoist Xiao—after all, this Taoist had helped him solve many major cases in record time—the current explanation seemed highly implausible.

"But why would Han Kaishan do this? There must be a motive," he asked.

The two walked along the outskirts of the mass grave. Under the winter moonlight and the reflection of the surrounding snow, many details were visible.

A night crow, having just finished eating carrion, perched on a dead tree to rest.

Shadowy figures of various sizes could be seen scrambling for something within the mass grave, occasionally letting out growls.

"The motive is the embroidered koi fish luck-changing painting Cui Dubo commissioned. Since it's a treasure of the Cui family, it must be priceless... Everything was done to divert suspicion."

Song Yuanbao thought for a moment and asked, "Fine, the motive makes sense. But now I want to know—why are we here in the middle of the night?"

The Taoist had said much, but he still hadn't answered Song Yuanbao's initial question.

"As I said earlier, there are two killers. Han Kaishan killed the escort members, and Wang Dajiu killed Cui Dubo," Xiao Ji explained. "Moreover, I discovered that more than one person died in the Cui family's villa—there was also a steward."

How do you even find these things when no one else can? Such incredible observational skills were truly enviable for a constable. Song Yuanbao couldn't hold back: "How did you find out?"

"After dinner, while you all were still drinking, I went to speak with Madam Cui. I wanted to console the widow, but I made a new discovery instead."

"What discovery? Tell me, tell me!" Song Yuanbao was eager to hear more.

Xiao Ji didn't keep him waiting. "I found out that Madam Cui had actually arranged to meet the steward that night, but he never showed up and has been missing ever since. From what I gathered, the two had been having an affair for seven or eight years."

"Every time Cui Dubo went to the gambling den, visited brothels, or stayed at the villa with other women, it was the steward's idea."

"Whenever Cui Dubo went to the villa, he always took the steward with him, sent him away at night, and had him return the next morning. And on those nights, the steward would always secretly meet with Madam Cui under the pretense of keeping an eye on her."

"Tsk tsk tsk," Song Yuanbao marveled. "How attractive is Madam Cui?"

"Constable Song, shouldn't your focus be on where the steward went?" Xiao Ji reminded him.

"Oh right, where is the steward?" Song Yuanbao said. "His body hasn't been found either."

"And that's exactly why we're here in the middle of the night," Xiao Ji said, turning his gaze toward the depths of the mass grave. "We're here to find the steward's body."
