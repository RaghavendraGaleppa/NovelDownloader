# Chapter 76: The Truth is Just Another Layer of Curtain

In the evening, Crimson Glow City faded from a hazy twilight into the true darkness of night.

The sunstone in the room was almost extinguished. Qin Ming sat there motionless, his face obscured, only his eyes still gleaming.

He looked again at his fourteen-year-old self. That boy valued emotions, cared deeply for those around him, and found it hard to let go during life-and-death separations.

At that moment, the fourteen-year-old Qin Ming trembled slightly. He wanted one last look at his parents and younger brother, knowing that this journey would likely lead to death.

When he turned back, he only saw the receding figures of his parents.

The fourteen-year-old Qin Ming's eyes reddened. He struggled to compose himself, quickly turned back, and set off with the elderly seniors from his family.

As expected, they were ambushed. Although they fled all the way, they were always found in the end.

These decrepit elders of the Cui family, with only a few years left to live, displayed terrifying combat power. Furthermore, each one fought fearlessly, making even the Li family momentarily apprehensive.

"Some of those old geezers are powerful figures from the Cui family's main lineage. They truly get stronger and more formidable with age. Hmm, I see Cui Chonghe; he's very likely the next standard-bearer."

In the darkness, several pairs of eyes from the Li family's camp stared at the fleeing Cui family members.

"Although Cui Chonghe has not embarked on the Path of Rebirth, he truly possesses special innate talent. In the future, he might approach immortality. Recent reliable reports confirm that he was identified at a very young age as exceptionally suited for the path of an outsider."

A group of Li family experts suspected that these powerful Cui family members, in their frenzy, were trying to break through with Cui Chonghe to an Outsider's land, to meet the legendary "old senior," who would be Cui Chonghe's future master.

Qin Ming saw much blood and bone, from both Cui family elders and Li family experts. Eventually, they broke through and escaped, disguising themselves in tattered clothes, entering a village that the Cui family had prepared for many years, temporarily lying low.

In fact, after several bloody battles, the Li family seemed to realize something, and their subsequent pursuit became less urgent.

"The Li family might have already discovered that some of our Cui family members departed via another route."

"There's also a possibility that the Old Ancestor, who vanished over two hundred years ago, has reappeared."

In the village, several Cui family elders whispered. By now, they were all heavily wounded and dying, having lost the strength to fight again.

Among the group of elders with little lifespan left, only a few remained after fighting to this point, all having collapsed along the way.

It was precisely because they fought like madmen, unafraid of death, that the Li family eventually became apprehensive, daring not to engage in further bloody battles, failing to realize that just a little more effort could have completely annihilated their opponents.

The fourteen-year-old Qin Ming remained silent, because even these elders themselves said they had expended their "remaining warmth" (final efforts).

An old man, with white hair and blood-stained, deeply wrinkled face, smiled somewhat eerily in the darkness as he looked at Qin Ming and sighed, "Your innate talent is extraordinary, extremely suitable for the Path of Rebirth. It's a pity to learn the methods from the silk scripture; you won't be able to cultivate it."

Another elder looked at Qin Ming with a complex expression and said, "Wait a little longer. Little Seven (Cui Hao) should rush here to save you once he hears the news."

In the inn, Qin Ming meticulously observed that scene.

Clearly, everyone in the Cui family knew that Cui Hao, his Seventh Uncle, was kindest to him; even these elders spoke of it.

"You are Seventh Uncle's... biological grandfather?" the fourteen-year-old Qin Ming asked. What he had seen and heard along the way made him realize something, and recalling the past filled him with deep loss.

"Yes, Little Seven is my favorite grandson. He has a fatal flaw: he's too sentimental. Come, sit beside me. No one will be able to touch you before I die," the old man said, patting the spot next to him.

Was valuing emotions truly a fatal flaw? After sitting down, the fourteen-year-old Qin Ming pondered, *I'm just like that, too.*

"You old geezers, stay away from me!" Seventh Uncle's grandfather looked up at the other blood-soaked elders, his attitude less than friendly.

An elder said, "All of us will die here, and we have no regrets. After all, we've already killed so many from the Li family. The Li family wants to rise, to demonstrate their strength and gain prestige by clashing with our Cui family, thereby ascending to a millennium aristocratic family. But they too must pay a heavy price. This time, they are destined to shed much blood. Whether the Li family is being pushed forward by someone or not, they will not be the ultimate victors."

"This child is still young; he still has regrets. He shouldn't die here. You few, go sit over there," Seventh Uncle's grandfather said.

Several elders rose and moved away from them.

In the inn, Qin Ming reflected, his gaze falling upon the other elders.

Seventh Uncle's grandfather led Qin Ming into a dilapidated house in the village and said, "Given Little Seven's personality, he will come to save you once he knows, but he'll likely be intercepted. The clan won't allow anything to happen to him, after all, his talent is most akin to mine; he's one of the Cui family's future top combatants. I don't think Little Seven will give up easily, so someone will send appropriate experts to rescue you. I just hope they arrive soon and don't miss the opportunity. Hmm, don't worry, the Li family isn't foolish; by now they understand what's going on, and their experts are no longer focused here, and besides..."

At this point, he began to cough, blood constantly gushing from his mouth. Qin Ming quickly stepped forward but didn't know how to help him.

The old man waved his hand and said, "My body is failing. Let me continue. I believe the Old Ancestor has appeared, and both sides have probably begun to retreat now. There are no major battles left, so you might survive."

The old man glanced outside, then spoke using a secret technique, his voice only audible to Qin Ming, "I'm about to die. Don't leave this room. Just say I'm recuperating and ask them not to disturb me."

The fourteen-year-old Qin Ming nodded, tears in his eyes, watching the old man close his eyes and become motionless.

In the inn, the sunstone completely extinguished. Qin Ming sat there and whispered, "Before I lost my memory, I... actually knew a lot."

In the dilapidated room, the fourteen-year-old Qin Ming merely wrote the character 'abandon' (弃), then fell silent, unwilling to speak.

Having recovered his memories, the current Qin Ming re-experienced the feelings of that moment. The sensation was unbearable, more painful than having his skull shattered later, more agonizing than slowly having his heart and lungs sliced open with a knife. At that time, he sat there, feeling so wretched he could barely breathe.

In the inn, Qin Ming forcefully shook his head, finally breaking free from that emotion. He re-examined the past, as if conversing with his self from over two years ago, telling his past self, "You, because of everything you saw and heard along the way, looked back and thought you discovered the so-called truth? In fact, that was still just another layer of curtain."

The slightly yellowed book of memories turned another page, and the dust cleared. Qin Ming looked back to that year, seeing the Feather-robed youth, Li Qingxu, once more, walking towards him with an ethereal, transcendent aura, and directly attacking him.

Cui Hao's grandfather was not wrong. The Li family did not dispatch a large number of experts to continue pursuing them, but a small group of experts leading and gathering followers from nearby cities was still enough to annihilate this village.

In the inn, Qin Ming did not skip this memory. He re-experienced the agony of his broken arm and shattered skull, quietly reviewing all the details of the past, for he intended to completely unveil the curtain woven from the so-called truth.

Seventh Uncle Cui did not appear, precisely as the old man predicted. Cui Hong, a man with unusually long arms, and a woman with a red mole in her right eyebrow arrived, quickly disappearing with him into the night, bypassing Crescent Moon City and choosing to travel afar.

"Where they went wasn't important, as long as it was a remote place," Qin Ming muttered in the inn. He looked at Cui Hong and the woman in her early thirties, knowing the reason they took him to Black-White Mountain.

More than two years ago, celestial light penetrated the night sky from beyond the world, flying towards various regions. One of these light beams fell upon Black-White Mountain. The two individuals were already planning to investigate there, and since it also met the requirement of being a 'remote place,' Qin Ming ultimately ended up in that region.

"My self from over two years ago was actually quite perceptive, aware of certain things. Everything was because I was too sentimental. Was that truly a weakness? Probably!" Qin Ming's voice was very soft.

He muttered to himself, "At that time, I was still too young, after all, and I didn't know as much truth as I do now."

The most crucial point was that Qin Ming successfully cultivated the silk scripture on his own. With this as his foundation, his body underwent a complete rebirth, he initially navigated this path, and saw a corner of the past truth.

The silk scripture was miraculous. Since his rebirth, it had made his subconscious incredibly active, allowing him to see his infant self, likely around three years old, in a semi-conscious state. And these weren't memories he lost due to the Feather-robed youth shattering his skull!

Those were childhood memories that had naturally faded with the passage of time; it's difficult for normal adults to recall events from before the age of three.

"Ah, silk scripture, it wasn't in vain that I started cultivating you since childhood. At the critical moment, you allowed me to see my original self, and perhaps it was precisely my persistence in cultivating you for over a decade that ultimately saved my life."

Qin Ming suspected that his cultivation of the silk scripture wasn't without effect; perhaps it had been accumulating something all along. Because, when the Feather-robed youth, Li Qingxu, shattered three parts of his skull, he should have died; under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have survived at all.

"My childhood self didn't live well, wearing patched small clothes and shoes with holes, perhaps even worse off than children from ordinary families. And the old man who taught me characters and showed me the silk scripture, he was just an ordinary person, with rough large hands, dressed as shabbily as I was."

Yet, in the Cui family, Fifth Master and Seventh Master said that the grandfather in Qin Ming's memory had "severed all attachments" to forge his own path, and had already departed for the Imperial Capital of the Great Yu Kingdom.

The old man Qin Ming had relied on, who was clearly just an ordinary person, they had lied to him, saying he was a great expert. If he truly were extraordinary, why would the grandfather and grandson have lived in such poverty?

Qin Ming felt a pang of pity for his former self. Through the yellowed book of memories, his gaze turned to that year, reliving the emotions of that time.

During his time in the Cui family, as Qin Ming slowly grew older, his childhood memories naturally faded. Yet, he still had a vague impression, feeling that he should have another very dear grandfather.

"I miss him, I miss that grandfather." Those were his exact words from the old memory. At that time, his eyes were red, and he wanted to retrieve the silk scripture that belonged to him.

But several elders of the Cui family refused, saying the silk scripture was an ancient artifact, easily damaged, and told him to master the Path of Rebirth methods from the beginning of the scripture before looking at the subsequent methods.

From then on, the young Qin Ming practiced regardless of wind or rain, for many years, never interrupting.

It was all because he wanted to retrieve the silk scripture, and he missed the grandfather from his memories—that was the deepest emotion in his heart.

Although, as time passed, his memory of that grandfather completely faded, and he even forgot him entirely. However, cultivating the silk scripture had become an instinct, a persistent obsession of unknown origin supporting him, urging him to continue.

Clearly, in his earliest days in the Cui family, he had been intentionally guided: if he wanted to see the grandfather from his memories, he had to cultivate this silk scripture!

Now, looking back, Qin Ming found many things traceable.

Did Second Master truly reveal secrets while drunk? Was Fifth Master's perfectly timed hint perhaps overdone? There were too many details.

"With what you did, how could a child possibly be your match? This is truly bullying."

Qin Ming muttered to himself in the dim room. He carefully reviewed, and there were still many incomprehensible and illogical points.

"All the events, the entire process, if there was just one more person involved, then everything would fit, it would be understandable." He pushed open the window and looked out at the dark night sky. If that were the case, then he truly was somewhat pathetic and lamentable.
