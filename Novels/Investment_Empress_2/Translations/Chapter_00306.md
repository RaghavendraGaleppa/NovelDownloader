# Chapter 306: Making History, Forging the Inner Scene with Soldiers!

"I lost again."

After much hesitation, Zhong Ling finally let the Go stone slip from her fingertips. She finally understood the game.

In truth, she had been doomed to defeat fifty moves ago. Every move afterward was merely a guide given to her by her opponent before the final checkmate.

At this moment, Zhong Ling deeply understood why this young girl, who had surpassed the terrifying Li Mo and ascended to the top ten of the Hidden Dragon List at an unprecedented age, was rated as a Celestial Maiden.

"Um..."

Zhong Ling was just about to speak.

"Did I win?"

But she saw that at some point, that little Li Mo had凑到 (moved to) behind Ying Bing. He was staring intently at the board, but he was standing a bit too close, practically whispering into her ear.

The Cold Celestial Maiden, who had been orchestrating the battle with an air of hopelessness, as if she had no flaws, slightly shrank her neck.

I definitely didn't see wrong!

Ying Bing's fingertips trembled slightly, and a black stone fell onto the board.

But she still said coldly and clearly:

"Yes, I was playing a game with Zhong Ling."

Li Mo tilted his head. "Weren't you using the game to practice military formations?"

"How did you know..."

Ying Bing was stunned.

"Commander Qu said that the more military formations you command, the better. Miss Zhong was practically driven to question her life by you."

"....."

Ying Bing lowered her gaze and looked to the side. "She is quite good. If I gave her seven or eight stones, she might not necessarily lose."

Zhong Ling: ".....Thank you for the praise."

"So厉害 (amazing)?!"

Seeing Zhong Ling's expression, Li Mo knew it was true. So, Little Li Mo looked the board up and down seriously, then gave the Ice Cube a thumbs up, earning a light glare from the Cold Celestial Maiden.

He didn't understand Go at all.

But he never failed to provide emotional value.

"Then I shall entrust the soldiers of my Greenwood Camp to you, Miss Ying," Qu Sheng said, handing over his command banner.

"How many units should we try first?"

"Ten units should be fine. We can add more depending on the situation later."

Li Mo looked down at the forest of long halberds below. The thought that *a great man should be like this* arose in his heart. He felt every cell in his body buzzing with excitement.

He couldn't tell if it was battle intent or just nervousness.

"Starting with ten units right away?" Qu Sheng raised an eyebrow.

The generals present exchanged glances. The stronger among them were already at the Third Heaven of the Inner Scene, yet when they first managed to hold military power, even one unit was difficult.

It is no easy task for one person to bear the power of a thousand soldiers.

Ying Bing took the command banner, her gaze calm as she looked at Li Mo. "Go on. Just do as you please."

"!"

Little Li Mo immediately felt he didn't need to think about it too much anymore.

He had someone supporting him from behind.

He strode forward into the middle of the formation. Soon, the seven Xuan Dans in his dantian began to vibrate. Behind him, the phantom of a monkey appeared, its eyes seeming to burn with golden fire.

Li Mo asked loudly:

"Are there any brothers willing to help me form the formation?"

"Count me in!"

"Brother Li is so generous, how could we dare dampen the mood!"

"To be a soldier in Brother Li's formation? Haha, I'll have something to brag about when we drink in the future!"

The squad leaders and centurions were all unwilling to fall behind, afraid that if they responded too late, they wouldn't get a spot. It wasn't just about filling ten units.

In the end, those who stayed by Little Li Mo's side were the most elite centurions.

"Rise!"

As the command banner above fluttered.

Ying Bing familiarized herself with the method of commanding the soldiers while simultaneously using the military formation method she had just learned from Zhong Ling.

Master one, and you understand all.

Martial arts are essentially a type of military formation, just a type that can only be executed by multiple people.

A thousand-man military formation, under her command, was like a precision machine made of people.

"Is this... the power of a military formation?"

In an instant, Li Mo felt the surging power within him.

The Yin God Mark and the Stone Monkey God Mark on the figure within his dantian lit up simultaneously.

The Qi of the armored warriors was continuously transported to the array's core, sorted by his spiritual will, and merged into his body.

---

"It's somewhat similar to containing the power of a world, but not exactly the same. It has more killing intent and military煞氣 (Sha Qi)."

"If the Extreme Weapon Killing Body reaches perfection, will it have such an effect?"

Li Mo felt the sensation of his vital energy and blood being like a rainbow. A thought moved.

*Bang—*

A huge coral stone was placed in the field. This was a thank-you gift from Guo Jing for saving his life, but the Sky蛟 (Sky Flood Dragon) Little Li insisted on exchanging something for it.

"A Whale-Breath Coral Stone? A piece this big isn't common."

"Is Brother Li trying to test his attack power?"

"Tsk, tsk, tsk. He actually fully contained ten units of military power. He has the bearing of a great general. Is Brother Li unprecedented in this?"

"The Cold Celestial Maiden's command of the military formation is terrifying as well."

The generals watched this scene.

"I heard a legend from ancient times. There was a Tyrant with a Cangtian Tyrant Body. At sixteen, he was already an enemy of ten thousand. I wonder if Brother Li can achieve that?" Zhong Zhenyue muttered to himself as he looked down.

"I don't know what his limit is."

Qu Sheng looked at Ying Bing, then at Li Mo, and murmured:

"But it definitely isn't now."

*Boom—*

As the Wuzhiqi phantom beat its chest.

A loud *bang* erupted from the Whale-Breath Coral. The stone, upon hitting the ground, took root, shaking the very earth. Its color rippled like water, dyeing thirty percent of the coral stone.

Purple!

This meant that Li Mo's casual strike, without using any martial arts, was comparable to the Inner Scene.

"Not enough!"

Li Mo felt the Wuzhiqi phantom becoming more solid, his voice booming across the training grounds.

"How many more units?"

Qu Sheng asked loudly.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and met Li Mo's gaze.

"Thirty units!" ×2

They spoke in unison.

"Add thirty units at once?"

The field fell silent for a moment. The soldiers thought they had misheard.

Qu Sheng took a deep breath. He had a vague guess what this pair of young man and girl wanted to do:

"First Battalion, Second Battalion, Third Battalion, go up in order."

"Received!"

Three thousand soldiers, following orders with absolute discipline, stepped forward to prepare to enter the formation.

"Uncle Qu, adding thirty units at once... isn't that a bit too big of a step?!" Zhong Zhenyue asked with an anxious expression.

Zhong Ling looked at the iron armor below like clouds and found it hard to believe.

This was four thousand people!

Wait a moment...

Qu Sheng felt his whole body heating up despite the cold weather, his voice trembling:

"You don't know what they are doing. They are making history, the history of military formations!"

"Making history?" Zhong Zhenyue was confused.

Zhong Ling looked at Ying Bing, who had let go of the command banner and was using the color of her radiance to signal changes. She suddenly remembered what this Cold Celestial Maiden had once said.

Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain, complementing each other.

"She wants to use forty units of military formation to simulate a domain, using four thousand soldiers to construct an Inner Scene for Li Mo?!"

"Using soldiers to forge an Inner Scene domain?!"

Zhong Zhenyue felt a sudden numbness at the crown of his head.

No one had ever done this before. Perhaps there were, but it was absolutely certain no one had ever succeeded.

What kind of talent is required to even conceive of this? What kind of favorable timing, geography, and human conditions are needed to turn theory into reality?

Zhong Zhenyue's heart was racing. He knew what this meant.

Once successful, the history of the Military Sect would likely turn a new page.

*Huo—*

Ying Bing's beautiful eyes were like a mirror of ice, reflecting the high spirits of the young man in the formation. She waved her fair hand, plucking the clouds and mist.

The Xia Huang Qi changed color, turning into green, representing speed.

"Wind!"
