# Chapter 67: Deer Thirty-Eight  

A gentle breeze swept by.  

The corpse crashed to the ground, reduced to a pile of mangled flesh.  

With just one strike, Gou Sheng, a cultivator at the seventh level of Qi Refinement, was killed—his death gruesome.  

Standing in place, Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as he witnessed the scene.  

He had actually sensed the presence of Dao Rhyme in the man's attack.  

Through that faint trace of Dao Rhyme, he seemed to see a bizarre crow, its feathers and flesh rotting away, exuding an overwhelming aura of decay.  

Opposite him, the gray-robed man steadied his breathing before turning his attention to Zhang Jing.  

"Kid, your senior brother is already dead. Now, hand over the Blood Mill. Actually, never mind—I'll just take it myself."  

As he spoke, he strode toward Zhang Jing, his body once again surging with formidable spiritual energy.  

A bone-white magic sword suddenly appeared in his hand.  

"Yes, my senior brother is dead, and you’ve outlived your usefulness," Zhang Jing murmured, his gaze fixed on the gray-robed man as if he were already a corpse.  

"What do you—" the man began, confusion flashing across his face.  

Before he could finish, he saw the air in front of him tremble violently, as though something immense was pressing down upon it.  

The next moment—  

**Boom!**  

The sound of flowing water intertwined with the clashing of magical instruments, instantly filling every inch of space.  

**That was—!**  

The gray-robed man jerked his head up, his pupils dilating in shock as he beheld the massive river that had abruptly materialized from the void.  

Through the river, he glimpsed the silhouette of a ferocious black flood dragon.  

"Dao Rhyme!" the man screamed in horror.  

But his voice was drowned out in an instant.  

**Clang! Clang! Clang!**  

The river surged, magical instruments collided!  

A flood dragon emerged from the sea, spanning the heavens!  

Frigid Netherwater, Verdant Wood Radiance, Blazing Flames, Mountainous Weight, and the Brilliant Mace Light erupted simultaneously. The five elements cycled in harmony, and wherever they passed, the spiritual energy of the world was instantly stripped away.  

The five-colored lights intertwined.  

The Five Treasures Spirit River, now imbued with the Dao Rhyme of the Shadow Swallowing Flood Dragon, revealed its ferocious edge for the first time to an outsider.  

Though it appeared chaotic and violent, there was an inexplicable sense of unity to it.  

**Unstoppable!**  

Despair flashed in the gray-robed man's eyes.  

He couldn’t comprehend what kind of treasure could unleash such terrifying power in the hands of a mere fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Even more baffling was how a random fifth-level cultivator could possess the Dao Rhyme of a flood dragon.  

Cornered, a desperate will to survive surged within him.  

Without hesitation, he activated every magical instrument and talisman in his storage pouch.  

Spiritual light formed layer upon layer of barriers between him and the oncoming Five Treasures Spirit River.  

His bone-white sword, bone whistle, and other magical instruments were frantically deployed in a last-ditch defense.  

Yet, even so, the gray-robed man felt not the slightest shred of security.  

Because this attack had already surpassed the limits of the seventh level of Qi Refinement.  

**Boom!**  

The defenses he had painstakingly erected were crushed like paper under the full might of the Five Treasures Spirit River.  

In the next instant, the man managed only a muffled groan before being swallowed by the river’s five-colored radiance.  

Silence returned.  

**Tap. Tap.**  

Light footsteps sounded as Zhang Jing approached the gray-robed man’s corpse. He examined the storage pouch and the scattered magical instruments.  

Then, his brow furrowed.  

The storage pouch was damaged beyond repair, its contents inaccessible.  

As for the magical instruments—even the mysterious bone whistle—they were all broken beyond use.  

"From now on, I should avoid fully unleashing the Five Treasures Spirit River unless absolutely necessary," Zhang Jing mused with a sigh. "Especially when imbued with the Shadow Swallowing Flood Dragon’s Dao Rhyme. It’s too costly."  

He then moved to Gou Sheng’s corpse and retrieved his storage pouch.  

Without bothering to inventory the contents, Zhang Jing transferred everything into his own pouch before tossing the empty one aside.  

Two Sunscorch Talismans appeared between his fingers.  

In the next moment, both corpses were engulfed in roaring flames.  

Meanwhile, deep within the medicinal garden, the massive white deer cautiously cracked open one eye—only to witness Zhang Jing burning the bodies.  

Its pupils trembled uncontrollably.  

Overwhelmed by tension, it lost control of its bladder.  

After thoroughly cleaning up the scene, Zhang Jing remained vigilant as he turned and walked toward the garden.  

Before long, he stood about thirty feet from the white deer.  

**"This thing is sleeping so soundly during its breakthrough?"** Zhang Jing thought, puzzled. **"I’m this close, yet it hasn’t moved at all. That’s strange."**  

He studied the deer intently.  

Only now did he realize that this white deer was different from the other demons he had encountered.  

Its aura was pure, devoid of the usual violent bloodlust.  

Zhang Jing guessed that this was because the deer had spent its life consuming the garden’s spiritual herbs rather than engaging in slaughter.  

**"Could it actually be a good demon?"** he mused with amusement.  

The thought made the deer seem far more agreeable in his eyes.  

Though lying on the ground, the deer’s fur was immaculate—white as snow. Its antlers twisted and branched like a regal crown.  

Zhang Jing took a few more steps forward—  

**"What’s that smell?"** He immediately covered his nose.  

**"Maybe I should just stop here?"** he hesitated.  

The illusory form of the Five Treasures Spirit River stirred restlessly.  

This deer might be benevolent, but Zhang Jing wasn’t willing to gamble. Besides, he had no intention of abandoning the garden’s treasures.  

On the other side, the deer’s eyelids began twitching violently.  

Especially when it sensed Zhang Jing’s killing intent.  

**"I’m dead, I’m dead, I’m dead! What do I do?"** Panic surged within it, its aura fluctuating wildly.  

Its beautiful deer life had only just begun—it hadn’t even found a mate yet! How could it die like this?  

**"Maybe… surrender?"**  

It had heard that immortal cultivators favored mounts—especially those with good looks.  

**"I’m considered quite the handsome buck around these parts. Maybe I should give it a shot?"**  

As for fighting back? The deer wasn’t stupid.  

It had just witnessed this cultivator’s ruthlessness firsthand. With its frail limbs, how could it possibly withstand such brutality?  

Lost in thought, the deer’s ears seemed to ring with the terrifying **"clang-clang"** sounds from earlier.  

**"The stress is getting to me—I’m hallucinating,"** it lamented inwardly.  

But in the next moment, it realized—  

**"That’s not a hallucination! That monster is really about to strike!"**  

With a jolt, the deer leaped to its feet and immediately dropped to all four knees before Zhang Jing, wailing tearfully:  

"Immortal Lord, spare me! My Deer Clan has been single-lineage for thirty-eight generations! I’m the last one left—I can’t die!"  

"Waaah! I’ve lived here my whole life—never bullied another demon, never harmed a single human! Not even that little girl who kept sneaking in to steal herbs! I didn’t lay a hoof on her!"  

"Immortal Lord, I’m a virtuous demon, I swear! Heaven and earth bear witness!"  

"Please take me as your mount! I promise I’ll eat little and run fast when it counts!"  

Zhang Jing stared, dumbfounded.  

For a moment, he questioned his own sanity.  

This colossal beast—towering over him even on its knees—was bawling like a heartbroken maiden.  

**"Who would believe this?"**  

After a long pause, Zhang Jing regarded the deer with a complicated expression.  

Its words aligned with his initial assessment—likely true.  

As for taking it as a mount?  

The idea was tempting.  

With a faint smile, Zhang Jing asked, "What’s your name? And what skills do you have to offer as a mount?"  

"Reporting to the Immortal Lord, this humble one is Deer Thirty-Eight!"  

"I’m incredibly strong, tough as nails, and I can identify hundreds of spiritual herbs! Oh, and I can walk on wind, tread on water, and cross mountains and rivers like they’re flat ground!"  

Deer Thirty-Eight pitched itself with desperate enthusiasm, terrified that the slightest dissatisfaction might cost it its life.  

**"You can identify spiritual herbs?"** Zhang Jing seized on the key detail.  

"I wouldn’t dare lie, Immortal Lord! It’s my specialty!" the deer declared proudly.  

Zhang Jing gestured at the surrounding plants. "What about these?"  

"Some were transplanted from elsewhere, and some I grew myself!"  

"This place must be special to sustain so many spiritual herbs," Zhang Jing remarked thoughtfully.  

"Immortal Lord sees all!" Deer Thirty-Eight flattered before explaining, "My ancestor, Deer Eleven, discovered this place. He said there’s a treasure buried beneath it—that’s why the herbs thrive here."  

**"A treasure?"**
