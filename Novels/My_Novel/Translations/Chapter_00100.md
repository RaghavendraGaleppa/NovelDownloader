# Chapter 100: Archery Mastery and the Return for the Crab Treasure

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Great Luo Saber]
[Proficiency: 149/500 Novice]

Inside the wooden hut at the west end of the village, Li Xian held a long saber, striking out repeatedly. Saber light flashed frequently, accompanied by the sound of splitting wind.

The Great Luo Saber was a basic saber technique with no extraordinary cultivation method. Its moves were fierce and open, emphasizing wide and grand movements. The word "Great" in its name encompassed the saber's intent.

"I heard Commander Pang say that some martial artists in the Jianghu, used to using their hands and feet, dislike fighting with weapons."

"Because weapons are external objects. No matter how well one trains with them, they can never be as natural as one's own limbs. Furthermore, while weapons have advantages, they also have disadvantages."

"When facing off on a narrow path, if one's skill is lacking and their weapon is taken, their spirit breaks, and they have already lost. In contrast, those skilled in fist and foot techniques possess a reckless courage that presses forward without fear."

Li Xian's posture was elegant. Although the saber technique was open and fierce, the wielder himself was not rough.

Jianghu martial arts were diverse and varied.

Martial artists have different areas of expertise, leading to naturally biased views. What Commander Pang said might not be entirely correct, nor entirely wrong.

Fists, feet, palms, claws, sabers, swords, staffs, spears... various paths of martial arts had established systems within the Jianghu. On every path, there were many famous masters.

Who is strong and who is weak is truly unknown.

More than three days had passed since Ma Daozi returned to the stronghold. Black River Village continued its training as usual. Seeing that the winds were calm, Li Xian moved back to the small hut at the west end of the village.

He practiced martial arts in the bitter cold.

[Green Jade Palm]
[Proficiency: 1599/2000 Proficient]

Li Xian's Qi Lake had slightly expanded, now reaching a size of two zhang and one chi. His martial arts realm was progressing steadily.

"It won't be long before the Green Jade Palm reaches Minor Completion."

He started practicing before dawn. After several hours, his stomach rumbled with hunger.

He hadn't gone up the mountain to hunt for a long time, and there was no game meat at home. He could only cook coarse yellow millet to fill his stomach.

Coarse yellow millet was cheap grain. Although it could satisfy hunger, its texture was rough and hard to swallow.

Ordinary families planted white rice, which was usually used to pay land taxes. The remaining money was exchanged for coarse yellow millet to ensure they had food to eat.

This winter, Black River Village had accumulated a considerable amount of coarse yellow millet, so they wouldn't starve or freeze to death.

"It's time to go into the mountains and catch some crab treasures to eat!"

"This time, I have circulated my Qi through the meridians and sealed my pores. I wonder what changes will occur," Li Xian thought.

Deep in the mountains and forests.

Li Xian followed his memory, carrying a quiver of arrows on his back containing hundreds of wooden arrows. The arrowheads were sharpened stones, and the fletching was made of duck feathers. Hunting alone, he felt as if he had returned to the past.

Hunters' bows and arrows were all self-made.

Suddenly, there was a "flapping" sound, and a bird flew overhead.

Li Xian said, "Perfect timing!" He leaped up, channeling Qi to his chest, his body becoming incredibly light. He stepped on a branch and used it to launch himself higher again.

His body rose again, reaching several zhang above the ground, actually clearing the top of the trees to shoot at the high-flying cold goose.

"Whoosh."

The cold goose was hit and fell into the forest. Li Xian went to pick it up. The goose was the size of a face盘 and was already dead.

Lunch was sorted.

Li Xian's Qi Lake had grown stronger, and having gained the characteristics of the "Breeze Leg," he had grasped the secret of "lightness." When he channeled Qi into his chest, his entire body felt like an inflated balloon, extremely light.

He applied this flexibility, greatly improving his hunting skills.

[You killed a cold goose, Proficiency +3]
[Skill: Archery]
[Proficiency: 1463/1500 Minor Completion]

Li Xian had never deliberately practiced archery, but archery had many uses: hunting, harassing, probing... whenever facing a strong enemy, Li Xian would maintain distance and try to attack with arrows. Thus, his archery grew remarkably fast.

A campfire was lit, and Li Xian began plucking the feathers and cleaning the innards to prepare the meal.

The feathers of the cold goose had many uses and could be made into arrow fletching. Li Xian kept them for later use, so after plucking, he put them into his arrow bag for temporary storage.

In the past, when entering the mountains to hunt, cold geese were very common birds, but he usually disdained to shoot them. This was because, aside from the valuable feathers, the goose had a layer of fine down.

This down clung to the skin and was very difficult to remove. If not cleaned properly, eating it would cause poisoning. Yet, the meat of the cold goose was delicious.

Therefore, in the county's large restaurants, there was a famous dish called "Cold Goose Brings Joy." It was very expensive, and the price covered the cost of plucking the feathers.

Li Xian had never eaten cold goose meat.

After plucking all the feathers, leaving only the skin and down, Li Xian had his own method. He channeled his internal Qi into the goose's body, shaking it from the inside out, and then pulled. This could uproot the fine down in one go.

Internal Qi had many clever uses.

He started a fire to roast it.

The aroma of the meat gradually wafted out.

The first bite of cold goose meat was like a cold plum blooming in winter. It was very stunning. Cold geese liked to eat forest fruits, so over time, their meat had no fishy smell and carried a natural fruity fragrance.

Juice trickled down.

As Li Xian savored the delicious cold goose, he suddenly thought:

"Archery is truly my means of making a living. If I didn't have archery, how would I dare venture deep into the forest while guarding this Black River Village?"

"My archery is nearing Major Completion, and I happen to be deep in the forest. Better now than later. Once I finish eating and drinking, I'll strive to achieve Major Completion in archery!"

He quickly finished the cold goose.

Immediately, he set up his bow and shot arrows, training his archery.

He sought stability and accuracy in his shooting, not necessarily the kill. After all, game in the mountains were precious resources; killing indiscriminately would be a waste.

[You hit a bullseye at a hundred paces, shooting a vermilion fruit, Proficiency +2]
[You killed a thick-furred wild boar, Proficiency +5]
[You killed a mountain monkey, Proficiency +6]

Several arrows flew out, attracting some forest beasts. Li Xian's archery was exquisite, resolving the threats from several miles away.

An hour passed this way.

The proficiency accumulated enough, and [Archery] broke through to Major Completion.

Li Xian felt a sensation in his heart. It was a sudden enlightenment like being anointed with sweet dew, and also a natural flow like water finding its course. The combination of the two caused the intent of the arrow to rise naturally.

He suddenly felt as if his body were the bow and his will were the arrow. Not shooting would not calm his spirit, not shooting would not bring satisfaction. He nocked an arrow and drew the bow, releasing the overflowing intent.

The arrow was still the arrow, the bow was still the bow, but the difference before and after was like heaven and earth.

Minor Completion in archery pursued precision. It sought to hit every target, never missing a shot. It trained hand-eye coordination, body posture, and breathing rhythm.

Major Completion in archery pursued intent and spirit.

"How dare you dodge my flying arrow?"

A bowman, without a soaring spirit, could not shoot a stunning arrow.

Li Xian now understood why the Madam once said that a man's heroic spirit should be reflected in hunting and in archery.

Accuracy is only one aspect, and game is only the second.

Intent and spirit are the most important.

The flying arrow pierced through a tree trunk and nailed into another tree.

Walking over to look.

Li Xian gently removed the stone arrow. He saw a black dot on the arrow tip, which was a tiny fly. The fly was not dead; its wings had merely been pierced by the arrow.

It passed through the feathers without harming the body.

A divine skill.

[Skill: Archery]
[Proficiency: 12/3000 Major Completion]
[Description: You hunted in the wild and found the intent of the arrow. Archery has reached Major Completion, capable of piercing stone and breaking armor.]

When an arrow is imbued with intent.

Once it leaves the string, it moves forward without hesitation. Piercing stone and breaking armor is only natural.

Talented archers in the world, guided by famous masters since childhood, still couldn't find the elusive "intent and spirit."

Moreover, this "intent and spirit" is related to one's state of mind, situation, and condition. Even a master of archery cannot guarantee that every arrow will be stunning and full of spirit.

But Li Xian can.

His arrows will only become stronger and faster! Never regressing!

Because the crab treasure was of great importance, Li Xian marked the way as he went. Relying on his excellent tracking skills, he walked for about a day and reached the vicinity.

"That crab treasure appeared out of thin air. I wonder if I can encounter it this time."

"Well, finding it is my fortune, not finding it is my fate. It would be best to find it. If I really can't, I'll find another way to get other spiritual treasures."

He searched along the way.

There were no streams nearby, showing that the mountain crabs did not live near water.

Li Xian overturned large boulders, mainly checking the crevices in the rocks. He searched for most of the day. As the sky gradually darkened, he still hadn't found any trace.

Helpless, he had to light a fire and lay out a ground sheet, resting for the night.

He watched the campfire rise.

In the silent forest, he was alone. Occasionally accompanied by the sounds of beasts, it wasn't too lonely.

Li Xian couldn't help but sigh. The path of martial arts is difficult, and progress is arduous. For a clay body like him with no sect or path, when will he truly be able to walk his own path?

"Spiritual treasures are so difficult to obtain."

"Martial artists... martial artists... this path of shedding the mortal coil and being reborn is truly not easy to walk."

"Secular industries, Jianghu connections, martial arts attainments, channels for spiritual treasures, business development..."

Li Xian lay on a fallen tree.

Using the campfire to warm himself.

He couldn't help but think of "Madam Wen," feeling a sense of admiration. She was half a guide on his martial arts path.

But he was clear-headed. He felt neither gratitude nor loyalty, nor did he hold any resentment or hatred.

"I hope I can encounter the crab treasure tomorrow!" Li Xian banished his distracting thoughts and closed his eyes to enter the land of dreams.

The next day, dawn. Li Xian lightly shook his body, and the snow on him fell away. His pores opened, and heat flowed out, melting the remaining snow.

After a martial artist "seals their pores," their adaptability to the environment increases significantly.

He buried the campfire to extinguish it.

Using his base as the center, he gradually extended outward, searching for the crab treasure in the ground.

His luck was good today. When he overturned the fourth large boulder, he saw a flash of red light. Li Xian happily said, "Trying to run?" He flew forward to grab it.

He caught the Red Mountain Crab in his hand.

The crab's pincers were strong and powerful, grabbing and pinching randomly. Li Xian thought, "I wonder how powerful these pincers are. I'll test them with something." He cut a branch and placed it in front of the crab's pincers.

"Snap."

The branch was cut cleanly. Although the mountain crab was small, its power was not insignificant. Seeing that he had underestimated the crab, Li Xian looked around and saw a large boulder.

He punched the stone, and fragments flew. He took a larger piece of stone to test the crab's pincers again.

"Snap."

The stone turned to powder.

"Wow! If this were a mortal body, getting pinched by this would definitely break bones and flesh."

Li Xian pondered: "This little crab is easy to deal with. But... if there were dozens or a hundred of them, I would have no choice but to run."

He took out tree vines and tied the mountain crab up securely. He paid special attention to the two pincers, using tree sap to stick them shut.

He continued to patrol the mountain and search.

"Haha, another one in the bag!"

Li Xian caught two more in a row, feeling very pleased. He thought he would have [Spiritual Food] to use again. But seeing that the three mountain crabs were small in size, their crab roe was probably not much.

He continued to search.

这时，忽瞥见一道红影，他立即飞扑而去。这只山蟹速度却奇快，竟闪了开来。
Suddenly, he caught a glimpse of a red shadow and immediately flew forward to grab it. This mountain crab was surprisingly fast and actually dodged.

"Trying to run!" Li Xian gave chase. He reached out to grab it several times but missed every time.

Li Xian channeled his Qi and施展ed the "Four Directions Fist" technique. Fist shadows重重, leaving the Red Mountain Crab with no way to escape, finally allowing him to catch it.

This Red Mountain Crab was the size of three fists.

Its eyes hung from its body like lantern grass.

He tied it up and put it into a cloth bag.

Three small crabs, one large crab.

A rich harvest today.

"Quit while you're ahead. Being too greedy is not good." Li Xian felt satisfied and patted the cloth bag.

He was just about to return and boil the spiritual food.

Suddenly, Li Xian's footsteps paused. His eyes caught sight of something, and his mood immediately became excited.
