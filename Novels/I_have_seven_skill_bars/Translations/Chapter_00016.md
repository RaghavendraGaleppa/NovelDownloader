# Chapter 16: The Bee Cultivator Gives Birth

In the evening.

Ding Rui awoke from his cultivation and planned to get something to eat. But as soon as he stepped out, he found Li Yizhen standing outside.

Ever since Ding Rui first eradicated the large aphids in the Grain Bloom, every spirit field producing Grain Bloom would ask Li Yizhen to introduce them to Ding Rui for help with aphid removal. Although the large aphids in the Grain Bloom were far fewer than those in spirit rice, it still earned him spirit rice, so he naturally wouldn't refuse. Over this period, Li Yizhen and Ding Rui had become quite familiar with each other.

"More large aphids?" Ding Rui asked. People from outside Spirit Field 377 almost always came to him for such matters.

"Of course not! Am I the kind of person who only comes to you for large aphids?" Li Yizhen said playfully.

"Huh? Aren't you?" Ding Rui looked puzzled.

The smile on Li Yizhen's pretty face immediately froze. She rolled her eyes at Ding Rui and said, "Sister Mi is looking for you."

Ding Rui immediately realized that Mi was the bee cultivator from Spirit Field 56. Lately, Ding Rui had often conversed with her. After all, such a unique creature as a bee cultivator genuinely piqued Ding Rui's interest.

"What does she want with me?" Ding Rui was a little confused. The bee cultivator Mi had always been quite aloof. Unless Ding Rui brought her a few wild flowers—and they had to be uncommon, fragrant ones—Mi wouldn't even acknowledge his questions.

Ding Rui wasn't surprised. The entire hive was Mi's body; she could manifest her consciousness in any single bee. In fact, bee cultivators weren't unique; common ant cultivators also adopted this way of life, but most ant cultivators were considered evil cultivators, so they were never seen within the sect's territory.

"What do you need me for? And... what's all this about?" Ding Rui asked, pointing at the sky full of bees in the spirit field.

"I've had a child," Mi stated concisely.

"..." Ding Rui's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately grew apprehensive. He thought, "What does its child have to do with me? Why call me here? I didn't... Could it be those wild flowers I brought? But didn't Li Yizhen say wild flowers would only slightly affect the quality of her honey?"

Ding Rui forced down his racing heart and called out, "So?"

"I plan to entrust my child to you!"

"Why?"

"Because, in the early stages of cultivation, bee cultivators generally need to stay in spirit fields with flowers. It will be the same later; we simply can't leave flowers. Under normal circumstances, my child would be directly handed over to the sect and then assigned to a spirit field with flowers. However, I can also make my own arrangements. For instance, aren't you planning to become a spirit farmer?"

"Yes!"

"Then you'll also be planting some flowers. So, I can entrust it to you for care. It's the same as being randomly assigned to any spirit field. I see that you're very interested in us bee cultivators, and considering you've brought me wild flowers a few times, I'm giving you this opportunity," Mi said.

Ding Rui found it a bit strange. "Can't you take care of your own child?"

Ding Rui could only wait until the Young Bee Knight grew up and gained sentience before slowly asking more questions. Originally, Ding Rui didn't know that every animal could gain sentience. It was only through his conversations with Mi that he learned almost every animal in this world had a stage of gaining sentience, though the timing varied. Humans also had a stage of gaining sentience; humans under one year old similarly possessed low intelligence.

The Young Bee Knight settled down in Spirit Field 377. The beehive Mi gave to Ding Rui contained a good amount of royal jelly, which was the Young Bee Knight's primary food and would last for over three months.
