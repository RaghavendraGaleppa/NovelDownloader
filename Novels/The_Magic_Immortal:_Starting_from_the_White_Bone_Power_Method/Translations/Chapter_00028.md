# Chapter 28: Dual Cultivation of Body and Magic

"At this point, we can't catch up anymore."

The beauty mark sighed helplessly, her expression filled with resentment.

As the captain of the patrol team, her experience was naturally extensive.

The person who stole the demonic tiger-jiao bones and jiao core was extremely skilled. It seemed they had anticipated the possibility of being tracked by scent, as they deliberately left behind the jiao claws and skin scattered here without taking them. 

As for the jiao core and demonic bones... since the thief dared to take them, they must have used methods to seal or refine them. The [Autumn Wind Cicada] tracking technique had already failed to locate them.

After receiving Chen Daoyou's reminder, the beauty mark calmed down and focused on carefully examining the scene again.

"The injured tiger-jiao fled here and fought with the three-eyed red hound to its death. Later, someone else fought with the hound—likely two people... Chen Daoyou, this hound's head was blown apart. Can you tell what kind of force caused this?"

Based on the traces at the scene, the beauty mark deduced some details. However, there wasn't the slightest trace of energy left on the three-eyed red hound's body—it was as if the dog's head had exploded out of thin air.

Chen Daoyou leaped up and landed beside the beauty mark, both staring at the hound's corpse.

After a long silence, Chen Daoyou frowned and said, "Formless and traceless. I don't know."

The beauty mark sighed helplessly. With no residual energy or unique traces to analyze, it was practically impossible to track anyone based on this.

She then asked Bai Shaofeng, "Did anyone come from that direction? Or go over there?"

Bai Shaofeng thought of Wang Chan's frail appearance and recalled that the ones who stole the jiao core and demonic bones were two powerful experts. He naturally shook his head, and the other patrol members followed suit.

Just as the beauty mark was at a loss and the others were equally puzzled, Chen Daoyou suddenly swept her sleeve, collecting the scattered jiao claws and teeth into a newly retrieved storage pouch.

As for the jiao tendons and skin, which still had bits of flesh attached, she deliberately left them untouched—perhaps out of consideration for the beauty mark.

Then, with another sweep of her sleeve, she summoned a chilling flying dagger. Swiftly, she dismembered the three-eyed red hound, extracting a bloodstained demonic bone the size of a palm, adorned with crimson patterns.

Holding the bone with a magical hand, she rinsed it thoroughly with a gourd of spiritual spring water before storing it away in the pouch.

The others watched silently as she gathered the spoils, not daring to utter a word or make any move.

Only Bai Shaofeng, hiding his clenched fist in his sleeve, felt his heart bleed in silent frustration.

"You have no objections, I presume?" Chen Daoyou asked the beauty mark after stowing everything away.

The beauty mark smiled apologetically. "Chen Daoyou, you waited at Lotus Mountain for over two months for that high-grade demonic bone from the tiger-jiao. It's a shame my delay earlier..."

"Without your information and help tracking it, I wouldn't have found it in the first place. It's not your fault," Chen Daoyou replied indifferently. "It's getting dark. I need to go home and cook."

"..." The beauty mark was momentarily stunned by the latter part of her statement before chuckling awkwardly. "Thanks to you, Chen Daoyou, we avenged the blood feud and resolved this grudge by slaying the tiger-jiao. I know a fine spiritual cuisine restaurant in Green Bamboo Mountain. Would you honor me with your company—"

"No need."

"Please don't stand on ceremony, Chen Daoyou. You've worked hard today to kill that jiao. I couldn't possibly let you go hungry—"

"I don't like others' cooking. I prefer making my own."

With that, Chen Daoyou recited an incantation and exhaled, summoning a gust of icy wind that carried her swiftly toward Lotus Mountain.

Only after the wind had faded into the distance did Bai Shaofeng step forward, unable to resist muttering, "She actually enjoys cooking..."

"Be careful with your words, Brother Feng," the beauty mark cautioned. "Chen Daoyou came out to train and painstakingly sought that high-grade demonic bone to forge a suitable high-grade magical weapon—likely for the position of True Disciple in a few years. We've barely managed to establish a connection with someone like her. We can't afford to ruin it."

**Midnight.**

The moonlight was gentle, the night breeze soft, and the spiritual plants in the courtyard emitted a refreshing fragrance.

On such a beautiful night, Wang Chan longed to enjoy a leisurely midnight snack.

After a day of running around and thrilling adventures, he now felt utterly relaxed—and ravenously hungry. Without a proper meal, sleep would be impossible.

Half of the courtyard's bluestone floor had been pried open, and Wang Chan had playfully dug a pit.

Earlier, on his way back from the market, he had casually bought a [Willow-Leaf Spirit Chicken]. The white-bearded old man had claimed that although this chicken weighed only about three pounds, it was exceptionally tender and juicy, with top-tier meat—perfect for making beggar's chicken.

Wrapping the chicken in over a dozen layers of emerald spirit leaves, he mixed spiritual spring water with yellow spiritual soil to form mud, coating the bundle thoroughly before gently placing it in the pit and covering it with a moderate layer of soil.

Next, he lit a bonfire with spirit wood and set up a makeshift grill, skewering cuts of spirit lamb, beef, snake meat, and edible wild greens. With the barbecue sauce he had prepared days earlier, he began grilling.

Considering that grilled food could be drying, Wang Chan took the opportunity to cook a pot of spiritual rice porridge in the kitchen.

He also rummaged through his storage pouch for jade-green spirit fruits, golden-green apricots, and hundred-flower fruits—several kinds of sweet-and-sour spirit fruits—which he mashed together. Mixed with cool, sweet spiritual spring water and sipped through a hollow spirit grass straw, the fruit juice was ready.

The only thing missing was spirit wine. Without a brewer's skills, he couldn't make it himself, and it was too expensive in the market. He hadn't indulged in it yet, but perhaps next time.

Flipping the skewers with one hand and sipping juice with the other, Wang Chan exhaled deeply in satisfaction—bliss!

Since the skewers needed more time, he idly opened his virtual panel.

**Name:** Wang Chan  
**Lifespan:** 30/93

"Heh..."

Scanning the panel, Wang Chan couldn't help but chuckle softly.

The moment he returned home, he had eagerly hidden in the underground bunker beneath his bed, praying fervently before opening the panel. When he saw the words "capable of forming a low-grade Dao Foundation," tears had streamed down his face uncontrollably. 

Now, he scolded himself inwardly for being so emotional. 

*What kind of man cries over something like this?* 

But he just couldn't help it. 

The months of suppressed hope and silent torment had welled up all at once, overwhelming him. 

Now, however, things were different. Not only did he have the chance to establish a low-grade Dao Foundation, but he could also condense True Apertures—since the *Bone Devouring Great Strength Art* cultivated both body and magic simultaneously. 

Refining Qi to build a Dao Foundation, refining the body to condense True Apertures... it felt incredible. 

"The future looks bright." 

Wang Chan sighed contentedly to himself.
