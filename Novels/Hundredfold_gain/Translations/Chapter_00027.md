# Chapter 27: Journey to the Breeze Moon Sect, the Object of Opportunity

In the following days, Qi Chuan remained on his private mountain peak, dedicating himself to cultivation.

Apart from his usual efforts to advance his cultivation base, he devoted some time to mastering common spells from the "Minor Compendium of Qi Refining Techniques." Through persistent practice, he gradually achieved initial proficiency in these basic Qi Refining spells.

However, once he grasped the fundamentals, Qi Chuan slowed his practice of these spells, only occasionally reviewing them. The majority of his time was spent on advancing his cultivation and honing the five basic elemental spells—fireball technique and others—which were already at the advanced stage. If he could elevate them to perfection, they would provide significant advantages in the Qi Refining realm.

As for the common spells from the compendium, basic proficiency sufficed for now. Yet, even with sporadic practice, Qi Chuan knew that over time, these spells would naturally progress to the intermediate level.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

On this day, Qi Chuan received news that the Breeze Moon Sect was opening its doors to new disciples. The Qi family would escort those who had earned inner and outer sect positions to the sect.

Thus, Qi Chuan bid farewell to Second Elder Qi Baicang on their private mountain peak.

"Second Elder, I'm leaving," Qi Chuan said solemnly, clasping his hands in respect.

Since joining the main branch of the family, he had lived on this secluded peak with Second Elder for nearly four years. In that time, he had grown from a ten-year-old boy into a fourteen-year-old youth, his once delicate features now carrying a hint of handsomeness.

Over these years, Second Elder had treated him with kindness akin to a grandson, for which Qi Chuan was deeply grateful.

"Go, and focus on your cultivation once you enter the Breeze Moon Sect," Qi Baicang replied, his face softening with pride as he regarded the young man before him.

Though he had initially thought Qi Chuan's low eighth-grade spiritual root was only slightly better than his own ninth-grade, the boy had proven himself a prodigy, now on the verge of joining the prestigious sect.

Though parting brought a tinge of melancholy, Qi Baicang had lived alone on this peak before Qi Chuan's arrival. Now, he would simply return to solitude—though with the added comfort that his young disciple's future success would ensure his own standing in the family remained secure.

After all, if Qi Chuan reached the late Qi Refining stage and returned, he would become one of the family's few elders.

Qi Chuan nodded.

After exchanging a few more words, he set off for the main peak under Second Elder's watchful gaze.

Soon, he arrived at the square before the main hall, where three others had already gathered. Among them was the red-clad girl Qi Chan'er, along with the two youths who had secured outer sect positions.

The moment Qi Chuan appeared, Qi Chan'er's gaze locked onto him, her lingering resentment over losing the inner sect spot evident. The other two boys also glanced his way, aware that while they were entering the outer sect, Qi Chuan's path as an inner disciple would soon diverge sharply from theirs.

Ignoring their stares, Qi Chuan stood quietly, waiting.

Before long, a familiar figure appeared—the Grand Elder, the same ordinary-looking old man Qi Chuan had met before.

"Greetings, Grand Elder!" the group chorused, bowing.

The Grand Elder surveyed them briefly, then summoned a flying carpet, a magical artifact that expanded under his command. "Since everyone is here, board the carpet. We depart for the Breeze Moon Sect."

The four complied, stepping onto the plush surface, which was far more comfortable than the rigid flying sword Qi Chuan had ridden years prior.

As the carpet soared into the sky, Qi Chuan watched the landscape shrink beneath him, the outline of Red Maple Valley fading into the distance. A ripple of anticipation stirred within him—his path of cultivation was about to enter a new chapter.

His thoughts turned to the Breeze Moon Sect. What awaited him there? Could he seize opportunities like becoming a true disciple, obtaining a Foundation Establishment Pill, or even touching the elusive path of sword cultivation?

With his hundredfold amplification ability, true disciple status and a Foundation Establishment Pill seemed within reach. As for sword cultivation, while inheriting the legacy of the Profound Sword Sage might be unrealistic, surely the sect housed other sword techniques worth exploring.

If he could master even one such technique with his amplification, it would become a formidable asset in his journey.

"One step at a time," he murmured, settling into meditation to calm his mind and cultivate the Evergreen Art. The journey to the Breeze Moon Sect would take a while.

Meanwhile, atop a mist-shrouded peak in the Breeze Moon Sect, a dark boulder jutted from a cliff's edge. Seated upon it was a youthful figure in Taoist robes, his eyes closed, his face serene yet marked by white brows and temples that betrayed his advanced age.

The air around him was unnaturally still, as if the world itself bowed to his presence.

Footsteps approached. An elderly man—none other than the sect's leader, a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator with no hope of forming a golden core—bowed deeply. "Elder Supreme, the disciple recruitment is about to begin."

The robed youth gave only a faint acknowledgment.

The sect leader sighed inwardly. This was the Profound Sword Sage, the Breeze Moon Sect's sole Core Formation expert—a sword cultivator whose prowess allowed him to slay other Core Formation adepts with ease.

For years, his might had shielded the sect from rivals. But now, with only decades left in his five-century lifespan, the sect faced a crisis. Without a Core Formation expert, their enemies would descend like vultures.

Unless a new Core Formation cultivator emerged—a near-impossible feat in such a short time—the sect would have to rely on a pseudo-core leader, a stopgap measure fraught with peril.

As these worries weighed on the sect leader, the Profound Sword Sage spoke again: "Has every suitable Foundation Establishment cultivator in the sect attempted to comprehend that object?"

The sect leader bowed lower. "Yes, Elder Supreme. None have succeeded."

The object in question was a mysterious artifact retrieved from a secret realm. Despite extensive study, none had unlocked its secrets—though the Profound Sword Sage seemed convinced of its significance.

"Then," the sage continued, "issue my decree: True disciples may also attempt to decipher it. Whoever succeeds shall be rewarded with a Foundation Establishment Pill."

The sect leader's expression shifted.
