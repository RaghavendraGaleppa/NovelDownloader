# Chapter 47: The Duped Floating Cloud Master! What a Surprise?!  

"Hehe, among our respective sects, you and I are the latest to reach the Golden Core stage. If we don't handle these errands, who else will?" Floating Cloud Master said nonchalantly, flicking his whiskers with an unchanged smile.  

He stroked his beard proudly and boasted, "Brother Huayuan, that piece of refined iron you gave me has served me quite well."  

As he spoke, he even showed off his Qingjun Sword, its power enhanced after being infused with the refined iron he had painstakingly cultivated.  

"You old coot, enjoy your moment of pride!"  

"Just wait—I'll show you what a real surprise looks like!"  

Though Li Huayuan's face remained expressionless, inwardly he was overjoyed. The two were longtime rivals, and each knew the other's tricks all too well.  

Floating Cloud Master was clearly here to challenge him to another bet.  

"That piece of refined iron cost me twenty years of effort!" Li Huayuan said angrily.  

"Haha—Brother Huayuan, no need to be upset."  

"Bets are about winning and losing—it's all part of the game. How about we make another wager?"  

"This time, I've brought something far more valuable than that refined iron. If you win, it'll more than make up for your previous loss," the Daoist said with a sly grin.  

"Forget it! Refining a single piece of iron takes me decades. I can't afford to lose again!"  

"No more bets! Absolutely not. Do you think I'd fall for the same trick twice?" Li Huayuan shook his head like a rattle drum, firmly refusing.  

His expression alone proved that in the world of immortal cultivation, everyone was an actor. If you couldn't act, what kind of cultivator were you?  

"Hehe—" Floating Cloud Master stroked his beard, his face exuding confidence. "No bet?"  

"Since when has Brother Huayuan's taste become so refined?" He opened his palm, revealing a pale, blood-streaked orb resting in its center. "Are you really going to ignore a Bloodline Flood Dragon's inner core?"  

"Bloodline Flood Dragon's inner core?!" At the mention of the item, Li Huayuan's expression changed drastically, his voice trembling slightly.  

"You old coot, you and I really are kindred spirits!"  

"Who would've thought you'd prepare a surprise for me too?!"  

"Exactly! I heard that you once spent over thirty years by the treacherous rapids of Panlong River in Yuanwu Country for this very thing, only to leave disappointed. So I went to great lengths to acquire it just for you!"  

The Daoist spoke leisurely, his expression one of absolute certainty.  

"If your Silver-Armored Horned Python consumes this core, it could leap from mid Foundation Establishment to late-stage in one go. With another century of cultivation, reaching the Golden Core stage isn't impossible."  

---  

"Fine, I'll take the bet! But what treasure of mine are you eyeing this time?" Ancestor Li pretended to hesitate before finally adopting a "I'm all in" expression.  

"Ah, I'm not interested in any other treasures of yours. If I happen to win, I only ask that you refine two more pieces of iron of the same size for me within the next twenty years. Your mastery of True Fire is renowned among the Seven Great Sects—this should be a trivial matter for you!"  

Floating Cloud Master narrowed his eyes with a smile, though his words carried a hint of cunning.  

"Two more pieces of refined iron?!" Ancestor Li's face darkened, and he nearly jumped up in anger.  

"You old coot, you're trying to turn me into your laborer!"  

"This guy's greed knows no bounds! Good thing I came prepared this time!"  

"Hahaha—"  

"Old coot, let me teach you a lesson: cherish your life, stay away from gambling!"  

"Not at all! If you win, you won't have to do anything. This is the inner core of a fifth-tier demon beast—equivalent to an early Golden Core cultivator. It's absolutely worth the price!" The Daoist shook his head with a grin.  

"Fine." Li Huayuan nodded and extended a hand.  

"Same rules as last time?"  

"First, we compare the quantity of spirit herbs collected. Then, the quality. Finally, the number of disciples who make it out alive!"  

"Of course, everything stays the same!"  

The Daoist was delighted and quickly extended his own hand to seal the bet with a clap.  

*Slap!* A crisp sound rang out.  

But the Daoist's face didn't light up with joy—instead, it twisted in dismay.  

The hand he'd slapped wasn't Li Huayuan's, but a filthy, grimy hand that had mysteriously appeared between them, covered in grease and dirt as if it hadn't been washed in years!  

The disciples from both sects, who had been watching their elders' exchange, were stunned by this eerie spectacle.  

"Senior Qiong!"  

Floating Cloud Master and Li Huayuan both turned pale as they called out in unison.  

"Senior? Don't flatter me. I'm just at the Golden Core stage like you—I just got here a few years earlier!" A lazy voice sounded between them as a strangely dressed figure gradually materialized.  

The man wore a patched blue robe, had short hair barely a few inches long, and carried a faded green cloth bag at his waist—seemingly someone who valued cleanliness.  

Yet his face was smeared with grime, so dark that his true features were barely visible.  

"A few years? More like a few centuries!"  

Upon recognizing the newcomer, Ancestor Li and the Daoist inwardly groaned. Though they thought, *So it's him*, they dared not show the slightest disrespect.  

This eccentric was not only terrifyingly old—half a step into the Nascent Soul stage—but his self-created Invisible Escape Technique was renowned throughout the cultivation world, known even in neighboring nations.  

Perhaps because his lifespan was nearing its end without him fully breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, his temperament had grown increasingly bizarre over the past century. He took great pleasure in tormenting Golden Core cultivators, leaving almost all of the Seven Great Sects' high-level experts in disarray.  

Yet these revered elders, normally treated as patriarchs within their sects, could do nothing about him.  

In terms of cultivation depth, he was unmatched among Golden Core cultivators. In terms of backing, he belonged to the Masked Moon Sect, the strongest of the Seven Great Sects. Even if they sought help from their own Nascent Soul elders, most of those "seniors" knew him personally—and those who didn't wouldn't bother interfering over trivial matters.  

Thus, among the upper echelons of the cultivation world, he had earned the reputation of a "bully" and a "rogue." Meeting him was a matter of praying for good luck—hoping he was in a good mood, or else some teasing and suffering were inevitable.  

"If you're making a bet, just the two of you would be too dull. Count this old man in!" Senior Qiong, seemingly in high spirits, said something that made the two men inwardly despair.  

"Two's too few—with me, we'll have three!"  

"Senior, you jest. How could our disciples compare to the elite disciples of the Masked Moon Sect? We'd lose for sure—no need to bet, we concede!" The Daoist forced a smile, trying to appease him.  

Li Huayuan was equally anxious. *Why did this old monster have to show up now of all times?*  

Senior Qiong chuckled coldly, rolling his eyes as he retorted,  

"Do I seem like the kind of person who'd bully others so shamelessly? Relax—if the combined results of your two sects surpass ours, then I'll count it as my loss, and you two can settle your own bet afterward."  

"Really?"  

The Daoist sighed in relief. Though this senior was capricious and spoke his mind freely, his words were ironclad—he never went back on his promises. This made the bet fair, even slightly advantageous for them.  

"These three Invisible Needle Talismans were just something I made for fun. Since I have no descendants, they'll serve as this bet's stakes!" The old man raised his hand, revealing three talismans inscribed with seven-colored needles before tucking them away again.  

Ancestor Li and the Daoist couldn't hide their astonishment, exchanging glances filled with greed.  

Li Huayuan, however, was startled—he suddenly remembered Lin Yun's earlier request.  

*Could it be...? No, it must be a coincidence.*  

Once the bet was sealed, Floating Cloud Master asked curiously, "Senior, what brings you here? Are you leading the Masked Moon Sect's team this time?"  

"Me, lead? Would they trust me? The sect's leader this time is that girl Nichang. I just came to see if any promising newcomers have emerged among the sects." Senior Qiong glared at him irritably.  

"From what I see, they're all mediocre! Any truly talented disciples are probably being hoarded like treasures by your juniors. But what's the point? Without real experience, talent is worthless—they'd be slaughtered like lambs the moment they encounter demonic cultivators!"  

The old man seemed deeply critical of the sects' practices, his expression screaming, *You're all doing it wrong!*  

Just then, Li Huayuan suddenly slapped his forehead.  

"Ah—right, right! How could I forget something so important!"  

Floating Cloud Master and Senior Qiong gave him a deadpan look—his acting was far too exaggerated.  

Still, Floating Cloud Master played along. "Brother Huayuan, what is it?"  

"Hahaha—" A sinister smile crept onto Li Huayuan's face.  

"I forgot the surprise I prepared for you on the way here."  

"Originally, my Yellow Maple Valley had one more disciple, but he had to stop to relieve himself halfway."  

"I need to fetch him now—if some wild beast snatches him, it'd be a disaster."  

"Could you two keep an eye on my disciples? I'll be right back."  

Seeing Li Huayuan's sly grin, Floating Cloud Master's heart sank.  

"You expect me to believe that?!"  

"Relieving himself? Cultivators don't even need to eat!"  

"Oh no... it can't be *him*, can it?!" The thought made Floating Cloud Master turn deathly pale.  

"No—no way. Someone like him would never join the Bloody Trial."  

"No—it can't be him."  

"I must be overthinking this."  

Beside him, Senior Qiong asked in confusion, "Why do you look so terrified? It's just one disciple—what's there to fear?"  

"Senior, have you heard of the talisman-making prodigy who appeared at the recent Tai Nan gathering?" Floating Cloud Master said grimly.  

"Oh, that kid? I heard about him from that girl Nangong. Supposedly, his talent in talisman-making is extraordinary." Senior Qiong nodded, puzzled. "Is there something else special about him?"  

"Perhaps you haven't heard, Senior, given how busy you are. After joining Yellow Maple Valley, he crafted over a thousand high-grade talismans and gave them away to his fellow disciples—for free."  

"What?! A thousand high-grade talismans, *for free*?!" Even Senior Qiong, who prided himself on his vast experience, was stunned. In centuries, he'd never heard of such a thing.  

"Senior, if Li Huayuan is bringing *him* back, we're doomed!" Floating Cloud Master said despairingly.  

Senior Qiong's expression also darkened.  

Just then, a booming laugh echoed from the horizon.  

"HAHAHA—"  

"Old coot, I've brought my disciple—and your surprise along with him!"  

When Floating Cloud Master saw Lin Yun standing beside Li Huayuan, he choked on his breath, let out a strangled cry, and plummeted from the sky.  

"ARGH—"  

Furious, he shot back up to confront Li Huayuan.  

"You call *this* a surprise?!"  

His eyes burned with rage, fixed on Li Huayuan like a beast ready to strike. "You scheming old fox, you tricked me!"  

"Haha—old coot, that's a bit harsh. It's not like I left him behind on purpose—Junior Lin just had to answer nature's call." Li Huayuan grinned, then whispered in Floating Cloud Master's ear, "Do you like the surprise I prepared for you?"  

With that, he patted Floating Cloud Master's shoulder and threw his earlier words back at him:  

"Bets are about winning and losing—it's all part of the game."
