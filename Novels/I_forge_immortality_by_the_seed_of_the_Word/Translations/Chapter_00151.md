# 第一百四十八章 筑基境后期

"Master, why did you stop? Should I read slower?"

Deer Thirty-Eight tilted its head and looked at Zhang Jing, asking softly.

It thought it was reading too fast, causing the master to not hear clearly.

"It's alright, no need."

Zhang Jing smiled, then directly took out the seed of the Three-Light蟠桃 Tree Immortal Root and handed it to Deer Thirty-Eight, asking with some nervousness, "Thirty-Eight, can this seed be planted?"

Across from him.

When Zhang Jing took out the Immortal Root seed.

Deer Thirty-Eight's big eyes were already staring straight at it.

*Gulp.*

It swallowed and asked cautiously, "Master, do you mean, you're giving this seed to me?"

"I want you to help Master see if this thing can be grown."

Zhang Jing said unhappily.

This deer always loses its way when it sees spiritual plants. Now that it's in the Celestial Realm, the situation seems to have become even more serious.

Hearing this.

Deer Thirty-Eight chuckled:

"It's all the same, all the same. Mine is Master's, and Master's is still Master's."

It suddenly noticed Zhang Jing's half-smiling expression, and its neck shrank involuntarily, instantly changing the words it hadn't fully spoken.

Zhang Jing shook his head.

The Immortal Root seed in his hand slowly flew towards Deer Thirty-Eight.

The other party carefully took the seed of the Three-Light蟠桃 Tree Immortal Root, and a bright, green light shone on its body. Then, the green light flowed towards the Immortal Root seed like water.

An aura of natural tranquility, peace, and the flourishing of all things instantly emerged.

"The Great Dao of Nature!"

Seeing this scene.

Zhang Jing felt a hint of envy in his heart.

Time slowly passed.

Deer Thirty-Eight suddenly opened its eyes and said excitedly, "Master, it can be planted, but this seed seems to need a very long time to germinate."

"How long?"

"At least eight hundred years!"

Deer Thirty-Eight said confidently.

Zhang Jing's expression froze.

"What if this seed is planted here?"

He pointed to the spiritual spring next to him and asked tentatively.

"I'm not sure, it might be faster."

Deer Thirty-Eight said uncertainly.

"Forget it, let's plant it first, it's better than not growing at all."

Saying that.

Zhang Jing took out the Rejuvenation Spring Eye and placed it not far from the spiritual spring.

Instantly.

Green spring water gurgled out from the spring eye.

At the center of the spring eye, a drop of water, shimmering with emerald light and shaped like a pearl, floated, incompatible with the surrounding green spring water.

"Rejuvenation Spiritual Liquid?"

Zhang Jing's eyes flashed, but he didn't take it out.

Just as he was about to turn around and go back to cultivate.

Unexpectedly, Deer Thirty-Eight stopped him again.

"Master, can I use that green spring water to irrigate the Immortal Root seed? I feel that this thing, combined with the spiritual spring water, should greatly advance the germination time of the Immortal Root seed."

Deer Thirty-Eight's voice carried a hint of longing.

"Yes, but don't touch the emerald water droplets inside."

Zhang Jing nodded in response.

Back in the palace.

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly.

Seeing the reaction of the three senior brothers when they saw the spiritual spring, he knew that he might have underestimated the effect of the spiritual spring.

Thinking of this.

Zhang Jing had an extra jade gourd in his hand, which was already filled with pure Immortal Spiritual Liquid taken from the spiritual spring eye.

He gently pursed his lips.

The next moment.

An incomparably majestic, but without any impurities, Immortal Spiritual Qi burst out in his body.

Vaguely.

Zhang Jing seemed to feel that his early Foundation Establishment cultivation had moved forward a very slight bit.

His eyes lit up.

He instantly understood the preciousness of the spiritual spring.

This thing can help cultivators save the effort of long cultivation accumulation.

Especially for Zhang Jing.

With the Immortal Spiritual Liquid.

This also meant.

He could put all his energy into comprehending and cultivating the World Derivation of the Primordial Beginning Realm.

Returning to reality.

Behind his head.

A five-colored Dao Origin Celebration Cloud, shimmering with illusory and hazy colors, slowly rose.

Cultivation knows no years.

In the blink of an eye, two years and seven months had passed.

Inside the palace.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, a trace of confusion flashing in his eyes.

It seemed that a long time had passed.

Thanks to the assistance of the Immortal Spiritual Liquid.

A powerful aura of the late Foundation Establishment stage was faintly revealed in his body.

Coming back to his senses.

Zhang Jing's mind moved, and his mind instantly came to the Niwan Palace.

At this moment.

A crimson crow with golden-red flames burning all over its body, like the previous Taiyin Dragon Flood Dragon Dao Intent, shrank in the corner, not daring to move.

The Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation revolved slowly around the mysterious jade talisman in the center.

The outermost layer was four Dharma Seeds.

Zhang Jing directly 'looked' at the central jade talisman.

His gaze swept over the familiar Dharma Seeds and quickly scanned to the bottom.

Technique:

[Primordial Beginning Realm · Level 1 (3117/1 million)]

Skill Characteristics: Dao Fusion Creation (Immortal)

Special:

[Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intent (Perfect)]

"With the Dao Origin Celebration Cloud blessing, comprehending Dao Intent is very simple, it only took three months to comprehend it to the perfect realm. It's just this Primordial Beginning Realm method..."

Zhang Jing pursed his lips, wanting to say something, but for a moment he didn't know how to start.

In the end, it could only turn into a sigh.

"Alas, it's difficult~ I still have to find something similar to the previous Zhouhe Gold Sand."

However, Zhang Jing also knew in his heart that cultivation was difficult was a normal phenomenon.

After all, as far as he knew.

Whether it was any kind of Heavenly Immortal Great Dao inheritance, it was related to the principles of the operation of heaven and earth, and was incredibly complex and profound, requiring thousands or even tens of thousands of years of cultivation to achieve even a slight accomplishment.

Imagining that he could reach the perfect realm by cultivating a method for decades, as he did in the lower realm, was no longer possible.

His mind withdrew from the Niwan Palace.

Zhang Jing then got up and walked outside.

Next to the spiritual spring.

Deer Thirty-Eight was lying on the ground, guarding the Three-Light蟠桃 Tree Immortal Root seed to the death.

And the aura on its body had already reached the early Foundation Establishment stage.

"This guy won't step into the Golden Core Divine Power Realm before me, will he?"

Seeing this scene.

Zhang Jing suddenly had an indescribable premonition in his heart.

After all, the Golden Core path he chose was extremely difficult.

Not to mention that Zhang Jing had even higher pursuits, and was not merely satisfied with fusing the thirty-six kinds of perfect Dao Intent into the Primordial Beginning Dao Foundation.

Thinking of this.

*Huff—*

Zhang Jing couldn't help but exhale lightly, walked directly to the Rejuvenation Spring, and took out the three drops of Rejuvenation Spiritual Liquid that had already condensed.

His mind moved.

A chaotic-colored Dharma Seal appeared between his eyebrows, connecting to the Flowing Light Immortal Realm.

Two years and seven months had passed.

Now he should have nearly two million three hundred thousand units of Qi Luck. Selling these three drops of Rejuvenation Spiritual Liquid was expected to yield more than six hundred thousand units of Qi Luck.

Then, he would use all of this Qi Luck to exchange for Dao Intent.

Since his cultivation had reached the late Foundation Establishment stage.

Then the cultivation of the World Derivation of the Primordial Beginning Realm should also be accelerated.

At the same time, he had to take advantage of this opportunity.

To search carefully in the Dao Repository Secret Realm for any Immortal Dao inheritance that met his requirements and could be exchanged for.
