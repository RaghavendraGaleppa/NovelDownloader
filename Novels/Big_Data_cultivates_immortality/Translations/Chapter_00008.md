# Chapter 8: Xiao Li's Bizarre Reaction

Feng Jun genuinely wished he could grow a bit taller. He had once thought this dream would remain unfulfilled in this lifetime—his best option being, like some guy named Xiao Ming, buying a pair of height-increasing shoes.  

But now, he was experiencing a second growth spurt. It had to be said, this development excited him greatly.  

However, no matter how thrilled he was, his current focus remained on his ability to monetize this newfound power.  

Thus, upon returning to his dorm, he rummaged through his belongings, pulling out two autumn shirts, a thick jacket, a pair of heavy trousers, and a rechargeable flashlight, stuffing them all into his rolling suitcase.  

What surprised him most was the infrared telescope he had bought during college. Back then, aside from studying and working out, he had been an amateur outdoor enthusiast. Though he hadn’t traveled far, he had accumulated some gear.  

*Ah, those college days…* He couldn’t help but reminisce about the time when he could recklessly chase dreams and flaunt his youth.  

Along with the telescope, he had also purchased a kukri knife, but he sold it to a junior before graduation—carrying such a thing around was just asking for trouble.  

After packing all the essentials, Feng Jun picked up his phone, ready to act. Just then, the door creaked open, and Qin Tao walked in.  

Feng Jun waited, but the guy simply sat on the bed and started playing games on his phone. Sighing inwardly, Feng Jun grabbed his suitcase and headed for the door.  

Without looking up, Qin Tao asked, "Leaving?"  

Glancing at him and seeing his attention still glued to the screen, Feng Jun replied casually, "Just going out for a bit."  

Qin Tao said nothing more. For someone as reclusive as him, asking even that much was already out of character.  

Dragging his suitcase downstairs, Feng Jun passed a convenience store. After a moment’s hesitation, he went in and bought two liters of mineral water and a few chocolate bars.  

When he entered the Hongjie Club’s front door, the receptionist, Xiao Li, happened to be yawning in his direction. Spotting him, she blinked in surprise. "Where are you going with that?"  

Feng Jun lied effortlessly, "The suitcase is dirty. Thought I’d clean it."  

"Oh," Xiao Li nodded, easily convinced—she wasn’t one to overthink things. Then she remembered something. "I’m not using my phone right now. Need to borrow it for half an hour?"  

Feng Jun hesitated before replying, "Actually… never mind?"  

"Never mind?" Xiao Li’s eyebrows shot up, her face flushing with anger. "I deleted my mobile banking and Alipay, transferred all my WeChat balance to someone else—and now you’re saying *never mind*?"  

*What the hell?*

"Fine," Feng Jun sighed, rubbing his temples. "I thought you might be busy. Ten minutes is enough."  

"Ten minutes?" Xiao Li eyed him suspiciously before handing over her phone. "Where are you planning to use it?"  

Without missing a beat, Feng Jun answered, "The bathroom."  

"The bathroom?" Xiao Li froze for a second before snatching the phone back with lightning speed.  

Unlocking the screen, she swiftly opened her photo gallery, her fingers dancing across it in a blur. She tapped dozens of times in quick succession, then hit delete before handing the phone back with a smirk. "Why not just find a proper girlfriend? Stop with these shady habits!"  

*Damn it!* Feng Jun smacked his forehead. "You thought I was going to… *use* your photos for *that*?"  

"I won’t give you the chance," Xiao Li retorted proudly. "All that’s left are food and scenery pics now."  

Feng Jun stared at her speechlessly before finally muttering, "You’re *really* overthinking this."  

*Am I that desperate?*  

To be fair, Xiao Li had a decent figure—though she was more of a "Beethoven" type (a euphemism for an attractive body but an average face). Still, as the saying goes, *youth hides no ugliness*—she could pass for a 7/10.  

After all, the club wouldn’t hire someone outright unattractive for the front desk, right?  

Carrying his suitcase into a bathroom stall, Feng Jun propped up Xiao Li’s phone on the water tank cover—it even had a handy little stand. He slung the suitcase handle over his right elbow and tapped the blank space on his old phone’s screen. "Off we go!"  

In the next instant, he was back in the desert. Sure enough, the suitcase had come along.  

The sun hadn’t set here yet—time seemed to freeze in this space whenever he left.  

A cold wind blew, making him shiver. He quickly opened the suitcase and began layering up. The thermal underwear could wait; the thick jacket and trousers were enough for now.  

Checking his left wrist, he saw the mark had faded almost completely—even more than after his first grass-grabbing experiment. Without recharging, he wouldn’t be able to return.  

---

Bringing items here clearly drained more energy. He’d need to quantify the cost.  

But that could wait. Right now, he had exploring to do.  

For over two hours, he circled the abandoned village, finding no signs of life.  

In a sheltered spot, he changed into his thermal layers before venturing into the village after sunset. Over the next few hours, he combed through every corner.  

No living creatures—just scattered bones, some human. In a shallow pit, he even found a skull with bite marks.  

Feng Jun wasn’t easily spooked, but stumbling upon a skull in the dead of night still left him trembling.  

He’d brought a thin blanket, planning to stay if necessary, but the cold was worse than expected. Worse still, sleeping near human remains required nerves of steel—which he lacked.  

After what felt like an eternity, dawn finally broke. Feng Jun nearly wept with relief.  

*Finally! Any longer and I’d have lost it.*  

He’d eaten all his chocolate but barely touched the water—it was too cold to drink comfortably.  

*Next time, I’m bringing proper supplies.*  

As the day warmed up, he resumed his search but found little of value—just broken pottery and coarse ceramic shards.  

*Some silver or copper coins would’ve been nice.*  

His only notable discovery was two crude charcoal drawings on a ruined wall: one of a person, the other of a rabbit-like creature.  

The artwork was amateurish, but the clothing suggested a Ming Dynasty style.  

"Did I time-travel?" Feng Jun mused, stroking his chin.  

Not that it mattered—he could return anytime. This was a two-way portal.  

*I wonder which era this is. Late Ming would be perfect.*  

His thoughts drifted to legendary beauties like Liu Rushi and Chen Yuanyuan before he shook himself back to reality.  

As he prepared to leave, he noticed something odd—his wrist mark was faint but warm.  

Tracing the heat led him to the stone stool he’d been sitting on.  

*This thing’s special.*  

The stool was heavy—300-400 pounds—far too much to haul back.  

*No way I’m dragging this through the club’s bathroom.*  

In frustration, he kicked it over—then froze.  

"Wait… *what*?"
