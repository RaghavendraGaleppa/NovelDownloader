# Chapter 122: New Skill

Ling Yu and Mu Su both wore grim expressions. Although the Saint Devil seemed incredibly familiar with Zhou Tian, neither of them were fools; they could tell something was off.

“You are…?”

Zhou Tian’s eyes were somewhat bewildered. This person acted as if they knew him intimately, but he couldn’t recall where he might have met them.

“My name is Saint Devil. Does that ring a bell?”

The man’s smile remained unchanged as he spoke softly. This was none other than the Saint Devil with a split personality, sent by certain individuals to the Divine Abandoned Land to contend for Heaven’s Mandate.

Zhou Tian’s pupils contracted. He knew that name. Zhou Yi had once told him that the person who had repeatedly attacked him with soul methods was named Saint Devil. He hadn’t expected to encounter him here.

For powerhouses of this realm, changing their appearance or even their gender was a matter of moments, which was why Zhou Yi had never shown Zhou Tian the Saint Devil’s true appearance.

“Remembered now?” The Saint Devil sighed. “I didn’t expect to run into you here on Mount Myriad Gods, and without an elder by your side. What will you do if you encounter danger?”

The Saint Devil himself was a little surprised. He had been dispatched to the Divine Abandoned Land by someone shrouded in light to help them contend for Heaven’s Mandate. According to the other party, the Heaven’s Mandate was set to emerge here, so he had been lying in wait. He had been waiting and waiting, and unexpectedly, he ‘caught a rabbit.’

He had scanned the nearby void thoroughly, inside and out, multiple times, yet found no one who could be called an expert accompanying Zhou Tian. Thus, he had emerged to meet him, to see this mortal who had frustrated him countless times.

Mu Su and Ling Yu remained silent. Although the Saint Devil’s smile was warm and his tone calm, every pore on their bodies screamed a single message: “Danger.”

“This junior greets Senior Saint Devil on behalf of my family.” Zhou Tian bowed slightly, his mind secretly calculating. This old monster was beyond comparison to anyone in the Divine Abandoned Land. Having lived for an unknown number of years, his schemes ran deep, making him incredibly difficult to deal with.

Though Zhou Tian could revive and possessed the divine skill of Instant Teleportation, he believed that the Saint Devil could absolutely keep up with the meager distance his single teleportation covered. Moreover, his resurrection could be counteracted; all it took was setting up a powerful damage array at the place of his death. At the moment of his revival, it would be enough to kill him before he could even use Instant Teleportation, trapping him in a death loop. And this guy could even manifest as sprites, which was somewhat terrifying.

Furthermore, there were Mu Su and Ling Yu. After all, he was the one who had brought them out. They had spent some time together, enough for him to consider them friends, and he couldn’t let them die here. So, facing this old man, he couldn’t act rashly; he had to proceed cautiously.

“No need to use your family elders to pressure me. Since I dared to act against you then, I am not afraid of your family’s retaliation.” The Saint Devil’s expression was indifferent, not taking the latent threat in Zhou Tian’s words to heart.

“Senior Saint Devil is overthinking it,” Zhou Tian said, maintaining a humble tone. “May this junior ask why Senior sought me out?”

“Why?” The Saint Devil thought for a moment. “Actually, there isn’t much to it. My current goal isn’t to kill you. I don’t have a habit of offering extra help.”

Currently, the Saint Devil’s objective was to contend for the Heaven’s Mandate, not to kill Zhou Tian. Killing Zhou Tian was the previous task, and though it wasn’t completed, he had still managed to claim the reward for it.

“However, I am very curious about how you managed to evade the array’s curse-kill time and time again.” A strange smile appeared on the Saint Devil’s face, his eyes glinting. Without any apparent movement from him, something that shocked Mu Su and Ling Yu occurred. Zhou Tian’s body turned into fine dust, scattered by the wind. His expression remained as it was before, without a single drop of blood.

However, a moment later, something even more shocking happened. In the exact spot where Zhou Tian had vanished, a naked man with a bare backside appeared. It was the very same Zhou Tian who had just dissipated.

Since his resurrection count had refreshed, Zhou Tian revived directly on the spot. New information flashed across the log in his Undead System:

“Host has been attacked!”
“Host has died!”
“Undead System activated!”
“Host has revived!”
“Death count increased by one!”
“Host leveled up, skill point gained!”

This was his last death at the fourth level. With this, he had ascended to the fifth level, gaining one skill point. The number of deaths required for the next level-up had also increased to 32.

“You truly are peculiar!” An excited expression appeared on the Saint Devil’s face, as if he had discovered something novel.

Zhou Tian had just regained his composure, cursing inwardly. He hadn’t expected this old man to act so decisively, without any warning, extremely ruthless, and seemingly unafraid of his actual death.

The situation was now extremely tricky. Zhou Tian’s mind raced, hoping to find something among his newly acquired skills that could extricate him from his current predicament.

“Saint Devil, do you know why I can revive?” Zhou Tian engaged the Saint Devil’s attention, afraid he might pull another trick, while simultaneously opening the Undead System’s skill panel.

“Why?” The Saint Devil was unhurried. He had already placed a restriction around them, making it impossible for any information to be transmitted or for anyone to come to Zhou Tian’s rescue. He didn’t mind playing along with Zhou Tian; he had been bored to death recently.

The skill panel opened, displaying the first skill:

**[Levitation: Grants the host the ability to fly. (Duration: 30s, dependent on death count.)]**

Zhou Tian quickly skimmed over it, cursing silently, “What the hell is this trash skill?” At the same time, he answered aloud, “Because of an extremely special reason, a very special reason!”

The Saint Devil’s brows furrowed slightly. The sky above them grew dark, thunder rumbled, and thick bolts of lightning rolled, seemingly intent on destroying heaven and earth. He didn’t mind playing along with Zhou Tian, but he *did* mind being played for a fool!

Mu Su and Ling Yu cursed inwardly, *Aren’t you just stringing him along? You want to die, but we don’t!*

The second skill appeared:

**[Sword Draw Technique: Accumulates power, dealing damage at the instant of the sword draw. Damage depends on accumulation time, can be accumulated infinitely. Every second, the previously accumulated power doubles. (Initial Power: Strength of 30 mortals, dependent on death count!)]**

While this skill wasn’t bad, it required accumulation time and was completely unsuitable for the current situation.

“This reason is special because… it’s special because…” Zhou Tian quickly looked at the next skill:

**[Cultivation Replication: Replicates a target’s cultivation and loads it onto the host. During this period, all system skills cannot be used. (Uses: 1, dependent on revival count, Duration: 30s, dependent on death count.)]**

Holy shit. Without even thinking, Zhou Tian immediately chose this skill. A flash of understanding surged through his mind.

The Saint Devil had lost his patience. He had thought Zhou Tian might have some earth-shattering revelation, but it turned out he was just someone scared witless, incoherent and with unfocused eyes.
