# Chapter 171: A Serendipitous Encounter

All the tree demons stopped fighting, their attention collectively shifting to the newly arrived woman wearing a bamboo hat. The Water Bear leader, its face bruised and swollen, squinted at her with a sidelong glance. It still didn't understand why Lin Shan had ordered the tree demons to beat it up earlier.

*Wasn't it you who smashed my eye socket crooked with a hammer back in the East Sea's Stormy Waters when you ambushed me to forcibly plant that summoning contract? Now that I'm out here helping you fight, you're turning on me?*

Lin Shan didn't notice the Water Bear's subtle glance at the woman. His gaze was fixed intently on the hat-wearing figure before him. He felt a vague sense of familiarity, as if he'd seen her somewhere many years ago.

"You are...?"

"Ah... Fellow Daoist Lin, you've come out..."

The woman's voice from beneath the hat sounded slightly unnatural. She hadn't expected the envoys from the opposing righteous and demonic factions to meet under such circumstances.

Her original intention had merely been to check on the spiritual vein tide situation in the Gongsun family's territory—and if possible, to take a share for herself.

As for where that share would come from? Naturally, it would be taken from Lin Shan, this demonic cultivator.

Once the situation on the frontlines became clear and the Gongsun family's two Golden Core elders made their final decision, Lin Shan would undoubtedly face punishment. The vacancy in the spiritual vein tide quota would then be something she could strive to obtain.

Previously, she had merely helped the Gongsun family keep their secret, but that didn't mean she wasn't coveting the opportunity.

Now that Dry Cloud Pavilion's Elder Mang had arrived at the Gongsun family, her confidence had grown with this powerful backing. She had come down to investigate how much longer the spiritual vein tide would last.

If it was about to disappear, then there was no need to bother. But if it could continue for a while longer, she might consider negotiating terms with the Gongsun family.

Who would have thought that Lin Shan wouldn't be obediently cultivating underground but would instead come out!

However, Lin Shan was currently puzzled. Why would someone come down to the earth vein at this critical moment?

Moreover, he didn't recall meeting her since arriving at the Gongsun family, yet she had recognized him at a glance. Had they crossed paths before?

Fragments of memories from the past twenty to thirty years flashed through his mind like slides. A sudden realization dawned on him, and he asked the early Foundation Establishment female cultivator with some uncertainty, "Have we met somewhere before?"

Beneath her hat, the woman's heart skipped a beat. She instinctively lowered the brim of her hat and forced a laugh. "No, we haven't. Although I mostly stay within the family, I do keep up with news of outside visitors. I heard that a demonic envoy came to our family as a guest two months ago, so I guessed your identity, Brother Lin..."

---

"Oh, is that so? It seems I mistook you for someone else."

"Haha, no matter. Brother Lin, please continue with your business. I won't disturb you further and will take my leave now."

The woman sighed in relief and quickly turned around, pulling out a talisman to break through restrictions. She was ready to leave the underground hall immediately, temporarily setting aside her original purpose of investigating the spiritual vein tide.

But then Lin Shan's lazy voice suddenly called out from behind.

"Wait!"

The woman froze. The talisman in her hand crumpled slightly from her tight grip, and her heart pounded with panic. Her spiritual sense could clearly "see" that the man hadn't moved, merely sitting there with a faint smile.

Yet the group of tree demons and the Water Bear in the hall were all staring at her back with predatory intensity. The danger in their gazes made her skin crawl!

Lin Shan slowly collected the melon seed shells—items that had been in his mouth couldn't be carelessly discarded.

Not for any particular reason, but ever since obtaining the "Nailhead Seven Arrow Book" and the Void Star Plate, he had become extremely cautious about leaving behind objects carrying his aura.

If such items fell into the wrong hands, they could be used to track his whereabouts or even curse him. In the world of cultivation, such precautions were necessary.

"Might I ask if the young lady has ever been to the capital, Bianliang?"

At the young man's gentle inquiry from behind, the woman's figure trembled imperceptibly. A muscle in her calf twitched, and her mind raced to figure out how to escape. The strength of this demonic envoy was something others might not know, but she understood all too well!

"Brother Lin jests. Bianliang is the capital of the Great Song Dynasty—how could I not have been there?"

"Oh? Then might the young lady know of a Qi Refining mid-stage rogue cultivator and court sorceress in black robes who served at the residence of Duke Qi?"

Lin Shan watched her back with amusement, his lips curling into a smirk as her silhouette gradually overlapped with someone he had encountered during his first journey to the capital.

The woman swallowed hard but didn't dare turn around. Her spiritual sense remained locked onto the scene behind her, her heart pounding like a drum.

"I don't understand what Brother Lin is referring to."

"Hahaha! Well said! Truly 'don't understand'!"

Lin Shan clapped his hands and laughed heartily, suddenly standing up. The tree demons and Water Bear leader all took a step forward in unison, making the woman tremble in fear!

"Fairy Qi, it's been fourteen years since we last met. Who would have thought you'd advance from early Qi Refining to early Foundation Establishment? With a genius elder brother setting such an example, it's no surprise his younger sister wouldn't want to fall behind!"

At some point, a gentle breeze had begun swirling through the underground hall, forming slow whirlwinds around the central area.

---

Lin Shan unleashed his mid-Foundation Establishment spiritual pressure without restraint. The wind and thunder spiritual power within him surged, causing his hair to whip wildly and his white robes to flutter in the wind.

His imposing aura was like a towering mountain bearing down, his cold smile fixed on the graceful figure before him. The woman had no doubt that what followed would be a devastating strike.

At this point, she realized her identity had likely been uncovered by the demonic youth behind her.

But how? She hadn't said anything incriminating. How had she been exposed?

Seeing that further pretense was futile, she turned around to face Lin Shan squarely.

It seemed there was no leaving without a fight. The talisman to break the restrictions would take a full ten breaths to activate the formation—plenty of time for the opponent to strike mercilessly without giving her a chance to escape.

Still, she couldn't resist asking, "How did you figure out who I am?"

"Guessed!"

Lin Shan's response confirmed his earlier speculation.

This woman was from Duke Qi's residence. Back in the capital Bianliang, she, along with the black-robed sorceress, Lin Shan, Immortal Huang, the green-robed elder, and the hook-nosed man, had set out for Yichuan together. They were ambushed by Princess Guo and her group by a stream in the Yan Yun Mountains.

In the end, Immortal Huang died, as did the green-robed elder and the hook-nosed man. Later, in a teahouse in Yichuan, Lin Shan encountered Princess Guo feigning reconciliation and learned from her that the black-robed sorceress had also died. Only the hat-wearing woman had been spared due to her family's influence.

Connecting this to Princess Guo's relationship with Qi Zhong, a true disciple of Dry Cloud Pavilion, Lin Shan pieced together previously unnoticed clues and boldly formed a hypothesis.

As for why the woman hadn't followed Qi Zhong to Dry Cloud Pavilion to cultivate, why her cultivation had advanced so rapidly to Foundation Establishment in the following decade, and whether her relationship with Qi Zhong was as siblings or something else—none of that mattered!

Lin Shan didn't care. He only needed to test his theory to confirm it.

With identities laid bare, the woman's tense shoulders relaxed slightly, as if realizing Lin Shan had been bluffing. She let out a bitter laugh and shook her head, seemingly mocking fate's cruel joke.

"Brother Lin truly lives up to being a demonic prodigy. Not only is your cultivation and combat prowess remarkable, but your cunning is almost inhuman. In my memory, only my elder brother Qi Zhong could compare."

As she sighed, memories of her genius brother surfaced, stirring emotions within her.

"My brother was tested at age six and found to have top-grade wood spiritual roots. Under the guidance of a Golden Core elder from Dry Cloud Pavilion who favored him, he was placed among inner disciples to temper himself. Without using a Foundation Establishment Pill, relying solely on his profound cultivation, he broke through to Foundation Establishment at sixteen as an adult."

"Later, he formally became a true disciple and displayed unparalleled talent in artifact forging, crafting over ten high-grade magical instruments. His master personally bestowed upon him the Geng Metal Sword Qi for protection."

"Even after failing to break through to mid-Foundation Establishment twice and being forced to rebuild his foundation, he succeeded on his third attempt at thirty, reaching mid-Foundation Establishment. Our parents and entire clan placed their hopes in him."

"My brother's aptitude, talent, intellect, and perseverance were all exceptional. Yet he was bewitched by that vile Princess Guo!"

"In the end, for a woman, he traveled alone thousands of miles to Bianliang and died beneath her pomegranate skirt, becoming star-crossed lovers."

"He had such a bright future ahead of him, yet he was blinded by lust, infatuated with that vile woman!"

As she spoke, the woman grew increasingly agitated, pointing at Lin Shan with tears streaming down her face.

"And you! Though you killed that vile Princess Guo with your own hands, you also deceitfully murdered my brother, destroying generations of our Qi family's efforts to become a cultivation clan!"

"Demonic cultivators are despicable and shameless, deserving of death!"

"But don't rejoice too soon. Your days are numbered. Soon enough, you'll join my brother in the afterlife!"

Lin Shan listened expressionlessly to her tirade, inwardly shocked by the legendary tale of Dry Cloud Pavilion's true disciple Qi Zhong. Who would have thought he had such a storied past?

However, recalling the final moments at the Poison Burial Great Valley's exit camp when he killed Qi Zhong and Princess Guo, Qi Zhong had seemed remarkably clear-headed—not at all like someone bewitched by Princess Guo.

It appeared he had merely been coveting Princess Guo, or perhaps something she possessed, but had been unable to obtain it due to certain constraints.

"Could it be the Jade Talisman?!"

Lin Shan quickly pieced most of it together. With Qi Zhong's talent, what woman couldn't he have? Why would he be infatuated with the venomous Princess Guo?

Unless he had learned that the Jade Talisman was a treasure but hesitated due to fear of the Enchantress Palace's Holy Maiden, biding his time. Princess Guo, equally cunning, might have guessed his intentions but played along, using his status and strength for her own ends.

Of course, no matter how these two schemed against each other, they had both ended up dead at the hands of Lin Shan—a cheat—and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, an old monster disguised as a novice despite being a Nascent Soul grandmaster.

In the end, the mysterious Jade Talisman had been taken by the "Enchantress Palace's Holy Maiden," making her the ultimate victor!

---

This chain of deductions flashed through Lin Shan's mind in an instant. After undergoing the baptism of "Heaven and Earth Nectar" within the spiritual vein tide, not only had his aptitude improved, but his comprehension had also soared. His mind had become incredibly sharp, processing thoughts at lightning speed!

Was comprehension truly this miraculous?

Of course, there were still some things he didn't fully understand and would have liked to ask Qi Zhong and Princess Guo directly. Unfortunately, both were long dead.

As for Qi Zhong's sister, Lin Shan regarded her with pity. It seemed this close relative had been kept in the dark all along, directing all her hatred toward him after Princess Guo's death.

But there was no need to argue right and wrong.

Qi Zhong had died by his hand—that was an indisputable fact. Thus, he and the hat-wearing woman were mortal enemies, regardless of her identity or the hidden truths.

And mortal enemies must be eradicated, roots and all!

Coincidentally, Lin Shan hadn't known there was an enemy still at large. Now, she had delivered herself to him from thousands of miles away.

What could be more convenient?

Deep underground in the Gongsun family's territory, isolated by formations, this was the perfect place to dispose of a body. Since they had met, he might as well deal with her before leaving, lest she expose his whereabouts.

The woman also knew that her accidental encounter with Lin Shan likely meant life or death. Aware that he had killed her brother a decade ago and surely hadn't remained stagnant since, his strength must have grown even more formidable.

But having reached Foundation Establishment, who would resign themselves to death? She would fight with all her might for a sliver of hope.

"Buzz—"

"Clink!"

A purple poison needle artifact suddenly materialized mid-air, intercepted by a single finger.

Or rather, by a jade ring on Lin Shan's finger, which blocked the treacherous, invisible needle with precision.

During their conversation, the woman had secretly activated the poison needle for a sneak attack. But under Lin Shan's stacked "illusion resistance," all hidden artifacts were as good as visible. Using the ring as a thimble, he effortlessly neutralized the threat.

Seeing her carefully planned strike fail, the woman panicked. But what shocked her more was recognizing the high-grade artifact on Lin Shan's finger.

Wasn't that her brother Qi Zhong's jade ring, which he always carried?

"Demonic thief, return my brother's artifact!"

With a flick of her sleeve, dozens of hair-thin poison needles shot toward him, trailing purple smoke and filling the air with a chilling whistle.

"Whoosh—whoosh—whoosh—"

Lin Shan remained unperturbed, producing a teacup artifact. Tossing it forward, the cup enlarged and neatly caught all the needles with a series of metallic clinks, trapping them inside.

Unconcerned about her lost needles, the woman's voice cracked with emotion upon seeing the teacup.

"Thief! That was my brother's favorite teacup! Give it back!"

Chanting an incantation, she formed hand seals, releasing a misty, multicolored glow that bathed the entire hall in radiant hues.

This time, Lin Shan didn't take it lightly. Uncertain of the spell's nature, he activated the jade bracelet artifact on his wrist.

The bracelet expanded, encircling him like a giant hula hoop. Rotating slowly, it blocked all the colored light, preventing it from touching his body.

Notably, this bracelet was also part of Qi Zhong's legacy...

The woman nearly gritted her teeth to dust. Her consecutive attacks had been thwarted by her own brother's artifacts, as if salt were being rubbed into her wounds.

Fortunately, she kept her wits. The restriction-breaking talisman had already opened a gap in the underground hall's formation. As long as she escaped alive to report to Elder Mang at the Gongsun family, this demonic cultivator would surely die!

But before she could flee through the opening, a miniature pagoda materialized above her head, slamming down with a resonant "clang" and trapping her inside.

The woman frantically struck the pagoda's walls with her artifacts, but Lin Shan's mid-Foundation Establishment spiritual power far surpassed hers. Moreover, the pagoda was one of Qi Zhong's finest artifacts...

Despite her desperate struggles, once trapped, she couldn't escape in time. The talisman's energy lasted over twenty breaths before burning out, allowing the formation to reseal the underground hall.

Cut off from escape, the woman screamed in despair, "Fine! Demonic thief! My brother and I will haunt you even in death!"

Lin Shan snorted coldly. "Save those words for when you reunite with your brother in the underworld!"

First, he ordered the Water Bear and tree demons to disperse the colored light and suppress the poison needles in the teacup. Sensing the increasingly violent fluctuations from within the pagoda, he drew his Golden Scale Sword and attacked from the outside.

While battling, he flaunted the four artifacts taken from Qi Zhong to unsettle the woman—in life-or-death combat, any psychological advantage was fair game.

Admittedly, using her brother's artifacts to torment her was exceptionally cruel, shattering her composure and reducing her combat effectiveness by at least twenty percent.

The woman had never imagined that a momentary decision—emboldened by Elder Mang's arrival—to investigate the spiritual vein tide would lead her straight to Lin Shan, who had emerged early after learning of the righteous faction's Golden Core elder's visit.

Their encounter, seemingly coincidental, was in fact inevitable.

And in dire straits, people often reveal their true thoughts. Unable to prevail in battle, she sought a final verbal victory.

"Useless! Even if you kill me today, you won't escape!"

"The frontlines at Falling Pine Mountain will launch a full-scale attack tonight. Dry Cloud Pavilion and Beast Control Valley are mobilizing together. With dozens of Nascent Soul elders joining forces, thunder and fire will sweep across the land, and the demonic path will crumble like an avalanche."

"Here at the Gongsun family, Elder Mang stands guard. The Gongsuns will defect to the righteous side. The teleportation formations they've built over the past two months are ready. Once activated, the entire eastern Great Song will rise in response, sparks uniting into a wildfire."

"The righteous sects will restore their golden age of a thousand years ago, cleansing the demonic path from the inland and expelling them from Great Song entirely, back to distant Lu Country!"

"And you—a half-hearted latecomer to the demonic path—will perish with them, a pitiful ripple in the tide of history..."

...

Lin Shan ignored her ranting, resolved to send her to the afterlife. No longer conserving spiritual power, he unleashed all his artifacts and commanded his summoned creatures to attack en masse, abandoning all pretense of fairness.

---

Half an hour later, the woman was predictably slain, though the underground hall was left in complete disarray.

Removing her hat revealed a delicate face with features faintly reminiscent of Qi Zhong, whom Lin Shan had killed years ago. But such details were trivial.

Originally, he had considered cleaning up the battlefield from his earlier clash with the twin-horned rhinoceros puppets to buy time after his escape. Now, with this additional mess, there was no point in bothering—the chaos could remain as it was.

Once the woman's disappearance was noticed, the Gongsun family would surely investigate underground. Lin Shan's absence from the spirit well's secret chamber would be exposed, making any cover-up futile.

However, the woman's dying words sent chills down his spine.

*A full-scale attack at Falling Pine Mountain tonight?*

*Dry Cloud Pavilion and Beast Control Valley joining forces?*

*Dozens of Nascent Soul elders?*

*The Gongsun family's teleportation formation activating tonight?*

*Then what about me...?*

Lin Shan hastily retrieved his Void Star Plate. This spiritual treasure could not only observe earth veins but also celestial phenomena, clearly indicating the current time.

It was just past midnight.
