# Chapter 26: Exchange

After one successful transaction, Li Shiming and Fan Yiyang became quite friendly with each other.

"Fellow Daoist, are you heading to Zhongdu to participate in next year's Ascension Assembly?" Fan Yiyang took a sip of tea and asked.

Li Shiming hadn't expected Fan Yiyang's first topic to be this. He didn't deny it, smiling as he refilled Fan Yiyang's teacup.

"As long as your background is clean, with your age and second-level Qi Refining cultivation, joining a sect through the Ascension Assembly shouldn't be difficult. However, you must clearly explain the origin of your cultivation technique and withstand the sect's investigation!" Fan Yiyang, thinking his judgment was correct, continued.

Li Shiming pondered. His "Five Elements Absorption Technique" came from the Weiyuan Escort Agency and was even found in his own garden, so he didn't need to worry about that. Even if the sect had some truth-seeking methods, he could honestly admit where he obtained the technique.

"I suppose Fellow Daoist aims to join the Tianhai Sect as your first choice—that's what most people with spiritual roots would choose. Your spiritual roots still need to be tested during the Ascension Assembly, but given your age and second-level Qi Refining cultivation, your roots must be decent!" At this point, Fan Yiyang seemed lost in thought.

This was the first time Li Shiming had heard about spiritual roots. Previously, he only knew that cultivation required talent, which he now understood referred to spiritual roots.

"How are spiritual roots judged for quality? Aside from the Ascension Assembly, are there other ways to test them?" he asked.

"Fewer spiritual roots are better. Single or dual spiritual roots indicate geniuses, though such individuals are extremely rare. Next are triple spiritual roots—these cultivators form the backbone of the cultivation world. Of course, most have four or five spiritual roots, with the majority falling into these two categories.

"Four spiritual roots still have a sliver of hope, but five spiritual roots are considered waste roots—even with a lifetime of cultivation, one would barely reach the early stages of Qi Refinement.

"As for testing spiritual roots, there is another method. If you can sense fire-attribute spiritual energy while practicing a fire-based technique, then you have a fire spiritual root. However, techniques shouldn't be tested casually, especially during foundational training. A single mistake could ruin your cultivation base." Fan Yiyang explained solemnly.

Only now did Li Shiming realize how fortunate he had been. He only had the "Five Elements Absorption Technique" and had managed to form a spiritual energy vortex with the help of the Spirit Gathering Plate. Had he known earlier that techniques shouldn't be practiced randomly, he might not have dared to cultivate the "Five Elements Absorption Technique."

Additionally, he suspected he had at least three spiritual roots, as he had sensed three types of spiritual energy while practicing the technique.

"If Fellow Daoist joins the Tianhai Sect, I hope you'll look out for me. My path ends here," Fan Yiyang sighed softly.

"You're a disciple of the Tianhai Sect?" Li Shiming finally learned of Fan Yiyang's background.

"Just a menial disciple, sent to the mortal world to procure supplies," Fan Yiyang admitted.

Li Shiming didn't look down on him. A menial disciple was still a disciple of the Tianhai Sect, and one assigned procurement duties likely had some connections. Procurement tasks were usually lucrative—this was true in both his past and current lives, and the cultivation world was no different.

Perhaps because Fan Yiyang hadn't spoken with a fellow cultivator in a while, or because Li Shiming's youth made him trustworthy, Fan Yiyang shared most of what he knew about the cultivation world, barring particularly sensitive matters.

From him, Li Shiming learned that the Ascension Assembly would take place in the tenth month next year.

After their first exchange, Li Shiming didn't return to his cabin to activate the Spirit Gathering Plate. For one, activating it required more than just spirit stones—he still needed to figure out how to trigger it. Now that he had spirit stones, it was only a matter of time. 

More importantly, Fan Yiyang had mentioned that spirit-gathering artifacts were extremely valuable. Li Shiming hadn't directly asked about the Spirit Gathering Plate but had instead inquired about methods to accelerate cultivation through spirit gathering. Among these methods was the Spirit Gathering Plate, which was prohibitively expensive for Qi Refining cultivators.

Knowing this, Li Shiming naturally refrained from attempting to activate it on the official ship. The cabins were separated only by wooden planks, making it impossible to conceal the spiritual energy fluctuations it would produce. He had no intention of testing Fan Yiyang's character—human nature was not something to be tested.

In the evening, he stood by the railing, gazing into the distance. The canal the ship traveled had a peculiar name: the Immortal's Slash Canal. Legend had it that a mighty cultivator had carved it out with a single sword strike. At first, Li Shiming had dismissed it as mere folklore.

But after some time on the water, he noticed something unusual—the canal was perfectly straight, unlike natural rivers that followed the terrain. From where he stood, he could see the canal stretching straight to the horizon without a single bend.

The aroma of spirit rice wafted into the air—Fan Yiyang must have been cooking. Li Shiming smiled. Meeting a cultivator like Fan Yiyang was truly fortunate.

Though he couldn't sense Fan Yiyang's exact strength, Li Shiming deduced from his behavior that he wasn't particularly powerful. The despondence in Fan Yiyang's eyes when speaking of five spiritual roots was unmistakable. 

Li Shiming guessed Fan Yiyang likely had five spiritual roots, which explained why, despite appearing to be in his thirties, he remained a menial disciple. A cultivator's appearance wasn't a reliable indicator of age—even without youth-preserving techniques, they aged much slower than ordinary people.

Following Fan Yiyang's advice, Li Shiming wore a scholar's robe over his low-grade magic garment and stored his low-grade sword in his storage pouch. In the mortal world, no one could recognize magical artifacts, but Zhongdu would soon host the Ascension Assembly, attracting many cultivators—some of whom might kill for treasure. 

Though low-grade artifacts were basic, they were still highly coveted among rogue cultivators—worth killing for.

Li Shiming reviewed the contents of the "Breath Concealment Technique." Due to his lack of spiritual energy, he hadn't practiced the "Metal Dominance Technique" or "Earth Spirit Technique" he had acquired earlier. But the Breath Concealment Technique was different—it could hide his spiritual energy fluctuations.

According to Fan Yiyang, Li Shiming's spiritual energy fluctuations were like a candle in the dark to other cultivators, easily detectable from afar. In the cultivation world, many cultivators allowed their energy to radiate freely, but those were individuals confident in their strength, using it as a warning to deter trouble.

For now, concealment was the wiser choice.
