# Chapter 175: The Libertine

The author: Crow is Better Black

A warm current surged through his body out of nowhere, flowing slowly through his four limbs and eight meridians. It felt as if he were soaking in a hot spring, so comfortable that he couldn't help but let out a long breath.

As for physical enhancement... there was none to speak of.

Given his current formidable physique, the reinforcement from the mining skill was negligible. Only the mining memories infused into him by the attribute panel were truly precious.

In the memories of his mastery of mining, he saw himself hunched over in the pitch-black mine tunnels, crawling with iron ore slag wedged deep under his fingernails, digging at the ore veins almost incessantly day and night.

He saw himself huddled in a leaky shack during a stormy night, the blood scabs on his palms fusing with the wooden handle of his pickaxe.

He also saw a certain night during a lunar eclipse, when the old miner who had been leading him smashed his gourd against the rock wall. The splashing wine outlined the veins of the earth's dragon.

"The seven thousand four hundred and thirty-first swing."

In the memory, the old miner with a blurred face suddenly spoke, his voice like the grating of two flint stones.

That hunched figure suddenly straightened, back muscles tearing through the tattered cloth shirt. The mining pick turned into a venomous dragon, plunging into the winding dark crevices of the rock layer.

Amidst the shattering of rocks, a trace of molten gold erupted from the depths of the earth's core.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan pondered thoughtfully. Looking at the large cavity he had dug out in the mine tunnel ahead, his mining pick suddenly flew from his hand.

The pick tip bounced off the rock wall seven times, each collision precisely striking a node of the ore vein.

When the final clang of metal on metal faded, the entire rock face before him, like a disarmed giant dragon, crumbled away, shedding three hundred catties of red-patterned copper ore.

"..."

It was more than ten times more efficient than the few玄钢 (Mystic Steel) burrowing mechanical beasts in the Rongjin Hall.

If he were to dig a three-zhang deep pit for the Tiancheng Workshop now, Xu Yunfan was confident he could finish the job in a single day.

And most importantly, the first characteristic of the mining skill: Dragon Seeking and Gold Dividing.

It could discern the trends of mountain ranges and spot places where spiritual energy converged.

If he could find a place where spiritual energy converges, then, just like when practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Art today, each breath would draw in a few more strands of Primordial Spirit Qi.

His heart trembled slightly. If the practice of the Pure Yang One Qi Art could be accelerated, then the stage of the Outer Three Unifications would be passed through in an extremely short time.

He glanced at Yan Yuwei, who was already lying on the ground, sprawled out and fast asleep.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and walked straight out of the mine tunnel.

Yan Yuwei had a particularly bad habit: whenever things didn't go her way, she would tear off her clothes, revealing her muscular physique that was even more robust than a man's. It was truly a sight one couldn't bear to witness.

By the time he left the Geothermal Training Area of the Rongjin Hall, it was already late at night. Xu Yunfan returned to his small courtyard and opened a hidden compartment to take a look.

Seeing that the Extreme Dao Remnant was still wrapped up, he hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided against taking it out.

Xu Yunfan adjusted his posture into a natural lotus position, his palms cupped loosely in front of his chest, his hands forming the Lion Seal (Lin Zi Yin). He recited the "Supreme Goodness is Like Water" Heart Mantra in his mind, meditating on the Lion Seal technique for cultivation.

With the rhythm of deep, long breaths, the tip of his tongue lightly touched the roof of his mouth. The rising and falling of his chest gradually calmed. His originally turbulent thoughts, like settling sand entering water, were stripped away layer by layer amidst the continuous exhalations and inhalations.

He quickly fell into a deep silence. The distracting thoughts in his mind were successively eliminated. His own spirit slowly emerged from his consciousness and once again took residence in the center, suppressing all external demons.

The clear will that had been lying dormant in the depths of his consciousness broke out of its cocoon, re-anchoring itself to the core of his spirit, isolating restless emotional fluctuations outside his cognitive barrier.

The midnight moonlight spilled over the window lattice. Faintly, a faint silver glow seemed to flicker around Xu Yunfan, outlining a hazy silhouette.

'In a moment of sudden enlightenment, you have finally grasped some of the subtleties of the Lion Seal. Your proficiency in the Lion Seal has increased.'

In a daze, Xu Yunfan saw a system notification suddenly float into his vision. It instantly disrupted his silent and tranquil state of mind, like a stone suddenly thrown into a calm lake, stirring up ripples. It pulled him completely out of the state of maintaining clarity and correcting the heart.

Xu Yunfan jumped up abruptly, looking at the notification of his increased Lion Seal proficiency flickering in his vision with a mixture of suspicion and immense joy.

This was truly a rare sight, like a country bumpkin visiting the Grand View Garden for the first time.

This was the first time since he began cultivating the Lion Seal that his proficiency had increased through his own efforts.

Ever since yesterday, when the woman from the Extreme Dao Remnant entered his dream and he passively gained proficiency, this was the first time.

A total of two points of proficiency.

It was truly rare.

After a long period of contemplation, suppressing the turbulent thoughts in his heart, Xu Yunfan glanced in the direction of the skin sac he had hidden in the compartment, then turned over and went to sleep.

As the night deepened, Xu Yunfan, who had fallen asleep with vigilance, had at some point fallen into a deep slumber, his five senses withdrawn, completely unaware of the outside world.

The Extreme Dao Remnant, hidden by him in the compartment under the bed, resembled spilled mercury, creeping out from the gap in the compartment. It slowly writhed, and as the moonlight shone down, it seemed as if a real woman, with skin like congealed fat and completely naked—except for a long, narrow, bloody fissure on her back that appeared as she moved—crawled into his quilt.

An eerie and cold atmosphere spontaneously filled the entire room.

The Extreme Dao Remnant slowly clung to Xu Yunfan's muscles and bones, adhering tightly to him.

The skin sac actually produced a sticky, living sensation. Its fingers tightly interlocked with Xu Yunfan's, its legs entwined and embedded with the host's sinewy muscles, leaving no gap. Silver threads, like a venomous snake flicking its tongue, roamed between their chests and slowly probed into Xu Yunfan's nostrils.

The moment Xu Yunfan fell into the dream, a thousand peaks and emerald waters劈开了 (cleaved through) the chaos.

He abruptly opened his eyes, his heart shuddering violently.

Before him was no longer the icy landscape of yesterday.

The winding Lijiang River hung upside down in the sky. Green peaks, like ten thousand swords, pierced the sea of clouds upside down. The rock patterns hidden in the mist were all sword energy scars.

In the center of the river floated half of a setting sun. Its blood-red color soaked through the water, splashing shimmering gold and red onto the sleeves of the white-robed woman who seemed to draw all the attention of the world.

She stood atop the isolated peak, which was as sharp as a blade. A three-foot-long white silk ribbon was wrapped around her wrist, hanging down. Her originally cold and clear face now carried a faint flush.

Her star-like eyes stared at Xu Yunfan, and within them... there seemed to be a flash of anger?

He had been pulled in again!

Xu Yunfan's expression turned somewhat gloomy. He finally confirmed his suspicion: once he fell asleep, this revived Extreme Dao Remnant would pull him into the dream.

"Libertine!"

Her voice was like an icy spring washing over stones, carrying a rare hint of annoyance. It was completely unlike yesterday, when she was like a ten-thousand-year-old piece of ice, her voice capable of freezing one's very soul.

"Huh?"

Xu Yunfan was completely bewildered. Before he could ponder why the woman would call him a libertine, she had already regained her composure.

"Defeat me, and I will let you go."

As her words fell, the woman pointed with a finger. A wisp of silver sword light, like a falling meteor, instantly blasted towards Xu Yunfan.

The scent of sandalwood still lingered on his fingertips from before he entered the dream, but his pupils were already filled with the sword light.
