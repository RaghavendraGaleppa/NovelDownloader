Chapter 82: The Insect-Attracting Flute and the Bird-Controlling Zither

"Brother Shen, what's going on with the Fire Spirit Gate? They're suddenly acting so strangely and aggressively," a black-faced cultivator asked, his brow furrowed in concern. As a senior member of the Heavenly Star Sect, he had a long-standing alliance with the Fire Spirit Gate, and their sudden betrayal had left him both shocked and enraged.

"I don't know what's going on," Shen, a white-haired elder, replied. As the head of a cultivating family with a history tied to the Fire Spirit Gate, he was equally perplexed by their actions. "It's as if they've gone mad, slaughtering even their allies. Are they trying to become the public enemy of the entire Xi Yue cultivation world?"

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged a concerned glance. "Whether they'll become a public enemy or not, I'm not sure, but if we're not careful, we might not make it out of the Xi Yue Valley alive," one of them said.

Shen nodded in agreement. "Let's focus on preserving our lives for now."

Just as they were discussing their situation, a chorus of alarmed cries and beast roars erupted from the distance. The remaining cultivators stood up, looking uncertainly towards the source of the commotion.

"What's happening?" the two Foundation Establishment cultivators asked simultaneously, flying towards the front to investigate.

"It's... it's demonic beasts," several battered cultivators stammered, their faces filled with terror. They were the outer perimeter guards, and their grim expressions only added to the anxiety of the others.

Shen's expression darkened as he extended his spiritual sense. "Brother Shen, what did you find out?" the black-faced cultivator asked.

"A large group of demonic beasts is heading towards us," Shen replied, his words sending a chill down the spines of the other cultivators.

Panic set in, and some cultivators attempted to flee. However, the first to escape were quickly intercepted by a flock of dark, ominous birds. The cultivators' screams were cut short as the birds tore them apart in mid-air.

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators watched the gruesome scene unfold, their faces grim. "It looks like the Fire Spirit Gate is behind this. They're using demonic beasts against us," one of them surmised.

As the cultivators regrouped, a rustling sound filled the air, and the ground began to swarm with colorful, venomous insects. While most were not considered demonic beasts, their sheer numbers posed a significant threat.

"Don't panic! As long as we stick together, these beasts won't be able to harm us," Shen shouted, his voice steadying the other cultivators.

The cultivators rallied, unleashing a variety of magical techniques and spiritual tools. Feathers flew, and insects buzzed as the cultivators fought back against the demonic beasts.

Meanwhile, about ten miles away, four individuals stood on a massive boulder, clad in fiery red robes with embroidered flames. The two in front had two flames on their robes, signifying their Foundation Establishment status, while the two younger individuals behind them had only one flame, indicating they were at the Spiritual Vitality stage.

The two Spiritual Vitality stage disciples held musical instruments - a jade-green flute and an ancient-looking zither. As they played, the music emitted a palpable aura of killing intent, and their instruments glowed with spiritual energy, revealing them to be spiritual tools.

"The Insect-Attracting Flute and the Bird-Controlling Zither crafted by our senior uncle are truly incredible," one of the Foundation Establishment cultivators praised.

"Indeed, our senior uncle is the top expert of our Fire Spirit Gate, capable of creating such miraculous spiritual tools," the other agreed.

The senior uncle in question was none other than the lascivious Li Elder, the only cultivator in the Fire Spirit Gate to have reached the Core Formation stage.

As the music intensified, the demonic beasts launched a more ferocious attack. However, the cultivators held their ground, and the two Foundation Establishment cultivators, supported by the others, managed to fend off the beasts.

"Senior Brother, it seems we need to take action personally to eliminate these cultivators," Xiang Wu, one of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, said, his face twisted in a snarl.

Dong Fei, the other Foundation Establishment cultivator, nodded, and with a wave of his hand, a blood-red glow enveloped the four of them. They then shot into the air, flying towards the besieged cultivators.

Qin Yan, a cultivator among the besieged group, wielded a blue-glowing sword that materialized into a massive seven to eight zhang long sword, striking down a giant, level-one peak-grade demonic beetle.

As the battle raged on, the cultivators fought valiantly, with Qin Yan's swordplay proving particularly effective against the more formidable demonic beasts.
