# Chapter 188: Thirty Years Without Leaving Home, Divine Art Perfected

Xu Yunfan pushed open the door to the geothermal chamber and squinted against the harsh glare of the sun. He returned directly to his residence, ordered a table of food, and only after eating and drinking his fill did he prepare to lie down and rest.

His eyes, which had been closed, snapped open.

Cursing under his breath, Xu Yunfan sat up halfway and looked down at the Extreme Dao Remnant Armor he wore. If he fell asleep, he would have to endure that woman's torment in his dreams again. Although it increased the proficiency of his Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Art, it was ultimately exhausting. He truly wanted to rest for a while.

Xu Yunfan immediately sat cross-legged, forming a seal with his hands before his chest. Just as he was about to silently recite the "Supreme Goodness is Like Water" Heart Incantation, he paused. He reached out again and pressed open the mechanism on his chest. The little Ginseng Doll's head popped out from the hole once more, struggling to get out.

"What are you coming out for? It's windy in there, so it's not stuffy, and there's a crystal to see the outside. It's much better than that birdcage, isn't it?"

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan pressed down on the Ginseng Doll and took a deep breath. When the doll bared its teeth, he quickly retracted his breath, causing the doll to bite empty air. Before it could do anything else, it was pushed back in completely.

As the last wisp of Ginseng Qi seeped into his lungs through his nasal cavity, Xu Yunfan had already arranged the hand seal for the "Lin" character mantra. While silently reciting the "Supreme Goodness is Like Water" Heart Incantation, this wisp of Ginseng Qi suddenly rose from his flesh and blood, penetrating into his skull.

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt a metallic tremor on the inside of his skull.

"Kan and Li intersect, Wind and Thunder oppose each other..."

The silently recited "Lin" character mantra suddenly transformed into the roar of bronze chimes, booming in his mind. His own spirit, which had been blurry, walked out from the mist. As the Ginseng Qi permeated it, it seemed to become substantial, and even his spirit's eyes gained a hint of liveliness.

An hour later, Xu Yunfan, whose temples were slightly throbbing with pain, opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was a series of five or six prompts appearing in his vision, indicating an increase in the proficiency of his "Lin" character mantra cultivation. He was instantly overjoyed.

It wasn't easy!

Ever since he started cultivating the "Lin" character mantra, apart from the ominous aura from the Power-Awakening Bodhisattva statue at Thousand Buddha Temple that gave him an amplification and allowed him to successfully step into the threshold of the "Lin" character mantra, the rest came from the Bright Lord statues of the Incense Fire Sect.

He had destroyed many in Wuzhou, but rarely encountered ensouled statues. And the ones that were truly ensouled were surrounded by experts from the Incense Fire Sect, making it impossible for him to break through.

Moreover, the Bright Lord was extremely strange. With the world's spiritual energy recovering somewhat now, who knows what the situation will be.

Right now, a single mouthful of Ginseng Qi was enough to push his "Lin" character mantra cultivation to the limit where his temples ached.

Why should he go out and take risks anymore? He should honestly cultivate in the Heavenly Work Cave until his martial arts are perfected before leaving the mountain. By then, anyone who defies him will have a hammer with the power to collapse mountains fall upon them.

Who agrees, who objects?

Walking out of the room, Xu Yunfan looked at the faint morning light in the distance and had no intention of running to the top of a mountain to absorb the morning sun's purple energy. He squinted towards the east. The purple energy condensed from the morning clouds in the sky quickly spread over and covered his body in an instant, then vanished just as quickly.

If it were half a month ago, he would have rushed thirty miles to seize the Dragon Head Peak at the precise time. But now, he just stroked the slightly warm玄钢机匣 (Mysterious Steel Mechanism Box) on his chest.

Inside the box, three hundred and sixty vortex grooves were vibrating rhythmically, slowly collecting the liquid overflowing from the Ginseng Doll's body to the bottom.

With the Ginseng Doll in hand, his Pure Yang One Qi Art would be perfected in less than two months, and he would step into the Flesh Refining Realm.

He moved his limbs slightly in the courtyard, preparing to lift the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer to practice the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Art, and to feel the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength that was born from his flesh and blood.

Due to the dream, he had managed to cultivate the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer to an入门 (entry-level) state in the External Three Unifications realm ahead of time. At first, because the strength was derived from his flesh and blood, his physique couldn't quite take it, but now it flowed smoothly.

The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength flowing under his skin suddenly accelerated. The muscles on his back undulated like living things, creating wrinkles in his coarse cloth shirt like a dragon or python shedding its skin.

This was true strength. Although it wasn't as exquisite and profound as true qi, it could greatly enhance a warrior's combat power and nourish the physique.

This was also the result of training the body's tendons, bones, and skin to the extreme, breaking through the first shackle of the human body. It wasn't related to the outside world, but a strength that spontaneously arose from within the body.

Xu Yunfan casually picked up the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. The moment the hammer's handle touched his palm, twelve red patterns shot from his tiger's mouth to his elbow.

With a flick of his wrist, the nearly four-hundred-pound heavy hammer tore through the air without a sound. It turned out that the thunderfire patterns on the hammer head absorbed all the airflow vibrations. But when it struck the blue flagstone floor, it exploded with thirty-six ring-shaped shockwaves.

"Rise!"

As his spine produced a series of nine linked crisp sounds, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength transformed into two blood pythons surging under his skin, wrapping around his arms.

Xu Yunfan suddenly realized that every muscle seemed to hide a miniature river cart wheel, and the seven hundred and twenty tendon and fascia nodes opened and closed with the hammer's movements.

When the seventh form of the hammer art, "Eagle's Beak Shatters Rock," ended, the hammer head hadn't even touched the ground yet, but the fine steel pillar three zhang away was already broken in half at the waist.

"Good hammer art! Good skill!"

The voice of the Sword Pavilion's walker, Pei Yan, came from outside the door. Xu Yunfan wasn't surprised. He had long heard the commotion outside the courtyard gate, but once his hammer art started, it was so exhilarating that he naturally didn't want to stop.

"Your Green Bamboo Sword seems to be even more agile, Walker Pei."

He flicked the hammer handle with his fingers, shaking off a few wisps of the still-unsettled Red Serpent Strength.

In his peripheral vision, the three-foot green blade was humming in its scabbard. The ice-crack pattern on the sword guard resonated faintly with the chainmail pattern on Pei Yan's back muscles, making his heart skip a beat.

It seemed that the armor Pei Yan wore and the Green Bamboo Sword were both divine weapons.

The young man leaning against the moon gate raised his hand to straighten the crane-patterned jade belt hook. His knuckles tapped the seven-inch mark on the scabbard, and the gilded bamboo节纹 (node pattern) lit up in response.

Pei Yan was tall and straight like a green pine. He wore a crow-blue tight-fitting outfit with a moon-white gauze robe over it. The collar was embroidered with silver thread in the unique Sword Pavilion pattern of the Big Dipper. His left hand habitually rested three inches and seven tenths on the scabbard. The calluses on the inner side of his knuckles, formed from years of sword practice, lightly tapped a rhythm on the bronze sword guard.

But none of this was important. Most of Xu Yunfan's attention was on the long sword in Pei Yan's hand.

Hearing Xu Yunfan's words, Pei Yan smiled slightly. "I was just lucky enough to have a fateful encounter with the Green Bamboo Sword in the Sword Pavilion's Sword Mountain. To have it recognize me as its master while still in the External Three Unifications realm is quite something. Now that I've entered the Flesh Refining realm, I feel a bit of a bloodline connection."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. The fact that he could feel a bloodline connection was enough to show that this divine weapon was extremely compatible with Pei Yan. This effect only occurs when a divine weapon fully relaxes and recognizes its master.

In contrast, the gilded mace behind him, if not for entering the "Lin" state, would resist Xu Yunfan's grip from top to bottom.

As Pei Yan spoke, he also looked at Xu Yunfan's attire with some surprise. He carried a large and a small mechanism box on his front and back, which made him look somewhat unconventional. He just didn't know what was hidden inside the boxes.

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to say much to Pei Yan. Dealing with people from these six top sects was truly a tiring affair.

"If Walker Pei has no business, I'll go practice my skills."

"Naturally, there is business."

"And it's good news."

Qi Huan's voice came from behind Pei Yan, causing Xu Yunfan's eyes to flicker.
