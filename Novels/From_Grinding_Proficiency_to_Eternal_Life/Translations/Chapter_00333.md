# Chapter 333: No Matter

“Taoist priest, just wait and see if your disciples of the Dao Sect can survive today.”

The black spear in his hand suddenly retracted, the sharp whistling sound of the tip tearing through the air still echoing in his ears.

Like a ghost, he retreated several zhangs, his black robes surging as he merged into the shadows of the alleyway. Only a chilling killing intent, like a viper flicking its tongue, remained, fixedly staring at Xu Yunfan, who was still being washed by the infusion of Xuanhuang Qi.

National fortune was like fuel, currently being refined into Xu Yunfan’s bones and muscles by the Dao Sect’s intense fire.

He was using the seized Great Zhou’s national fortune to strengthen himself. Loyal to the Great Zhou, how could his eyes not redden, and the killing intent in his chest not churn like thunder?

But the die was cast; doing anything more was futile.

Chen Wei left a cold transmission in the void: “Bi Sheng, let’s call it a day for now. But within the Jade Capital, not every Dao Sect disciple has your skill...”

Bi Sheng watched the other leave, slowly sheathing his rusted sword. The mottled patterns on the blade, illuminated by the Xuanhuang Qi, actually reflected a trace of blood color.

He frowned slightly, knowing the other’s words were not false.

Although the Empress Dowager dared not act openly against Xu Yunfan—the Xuanhuang Qi pillar was already linked to the fortune of the imperial examination, and forcibly intercepting it would inevitably invite the backlash of the dragon vein—the Dao Sect disciples scattered throughout the Jade Capital had become the most vulnerable targets.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. The Xuanhuang Qi pillar flowed around him, casting a golden glimmer in his eyes.

He clearly heard the conversation between Bi Sheng and the experts of the Imperial City Division. His throat moved slightly, and his voice was low like muffled thunder: “Senior Uncle... the Dao Sect fellow disciples within the Jade Capital, I’m afraid they cannot escape this calamity.”

Bi Sheng turned his head. The rust on the mottled iron sword reflected a blood color under the Xuanhuang Qi.

A难以察觉 (hard-to-detect) fluctuation flashed through his eyes, immediately replaced by an ice-like determination: “No matter.”

Xu Yunfan’s heart chilled.

Bi Sheng’s voice was low: “Their lives are exchanged for the thousand-year grand plan of the Dao Sect. It is the path to the heavens forged by your Master for you. You bear too much; do not let us down.”

Xu Yunfan fell silent and said no more.

The Ten Extremities True Qi within his body was still rapidly increasing. The illusory true qi that originally flowed between flesh and bone had already taken on a mist-like appearance.

Bi Sheng’s fingers tapped lightly on the sword hilt. His gaze swept over the surging Xuanhuang clouds above the seventy-two wards, then he took out a firework tube from his waist. It exploded in the sky, ordering the Dao Sect disciples to gather here quickly.

Currently, Xu Yunfan was at the height of his power. If the Empress Dowager acted directly, it would be equivalent to destroying her own national fortune. But if she allowed the Dao Sect disciples to secretly lay out their formation in the Jade Capital, she feared Xu Yunfan would use the momentum to completely swallow the dragon qi.

Declaring war on the Dao Sect—given the current state of the Great Zhou—might still hold sway within the Jade Capital Dao, but once outside, it would be nothing more than a scrap of paper.

Shouting the slogan of war would only add to the ridicule and damage the dignity of the Great Zhou, causing the dragon qi to dissipate further.

Caught in this dilemma, the Empress Dowager had no choice but to resort to the most insidious method: eliminating the Dao Sect disciples one by one under the pretext of “suppressing rebels”!

Bi Sheng sighed lightly. This trip to the Jade Capital Dao only had him, a Ninth Realm expert, making it truly difficult to sustain. Being able to protect the Dao Sect disciples to some extent was already the limit.

Within the Jade Capital, there was not just the Great Zhou’s Ninth Realm; other sects also had hidden dragons and crouching tigers within the city.

It was possible for a Ninth Realm expert to pop out at any moment to challenge him.

And the ritual of the Dao Sect’s Grand Offering of the Heavens could not be interrupted, leaving no room to spare anyone.

During the imperial examination, Xu Yunfan could not move easily either.

“Senior Brother, this job is hard to do; it’s truly a sign of great misfortune!”

Bi Sheng couldn't help but mutter.

At almost the same moment, a tea house in the West Market of the Jade Capital.

Three Dao Sect disciples were whispering when they suddenly heard a sharp whistling sound of a mechanism tightening from outside the window.

Before they could react, crossbow bolts dipped in faint blue poison poured in like a rainstorm. The fine iron arrowheads easily pierced the carved window lattices, nailing the sandalwood tea table and sending wood chips flying.

The leading disciple’s long sword had only managed to unsheathe three inches when a steel crossbow bolt pierced his throat. Poisonous blood splattered on the wall, drawing a hideous fan shape.

Simultaneously, Xu Yunfan, sitting cross-legged in the Xuanhuang Qi pillar, suddenly opened his eyes.

The rapid enhancement of his five senses brought about by the Bone Marrow Cleansing Technique surging toward perfection allowed him to clearly capture the successive screams from miles away.

The sound of broken tiles on the Sparrow Hawk Street tavern, the clashing of swords in the West Market pawnshop, and even the slight tearing sound of a sharp blade cutting through a windpipe in a dark alley—all pierced his eardrums like awls.

Further away, the hoofbeats of the Imperial City Division’s iron cavalry were trampling over the bluestone slabs. Wherever they passed, a mist of blood would explode.

He stood in the center of the Xuanhuang Qi pillar. The Ten Extremities True Qi surged like a river. Every inch of his bone and muscle was transforming under the nourishment of the dragon vein, emitting the sound of metal and jade colliding.

On the attribute panel, the progress bar of the *Bone Marrow Cleansing Technique* was rising at an astonishing speed.原本莹润如玉 (Originally jade-like and smooth) bones surfaced with wisps of golden light, beginning to cover his entire skeleton at a visible speed. Deep within the marrow, a brilliant glow burst forth.

What shocked him even more was that the Mixed Origin True Seed at the intersection of flesh and blood qi was actually devouring the dragon vein spiritual qi like a starving wolf.

This seed, originally the size of a grain of rice, had now transformed into the core of a true qi vortex, frantically refining the Xuanhuang Qi poured into his body.

Every inhalation and exhalation brought a rapid increase in martial prowess.

It wasn't until nearly half an hour later, when the Xuanhuang Qi stopped gushing, that Xu Yunfan gently stretched his body. A three-foot aura erupted from his pores, and faint golden-red veins appeared under his skin.

He casually clenched his fist, and the air actually cracked with a sonic boom. His pure physical strength far exceeded that of ordinary martial artists. Even a Ninth Realm master of physical training would likely have to look up to him in his presence.

The five elements of qi within his viscera circulated on their own. His heart beat like the drum of the Kui God, and his breathing sounded like drawing in wind and thunder.

The previously stagnant Kidney Water meridian, which had been obstructed during the cultivation of the *Ten Extremities Martial Dao*, was now unblocked as if naturally.

Under the Xuanhuang Qi, the spine, like a great dragon, connected section by section. The connection points of the twenty-four vertebrae were blasted open by the Xuanhuang Qi.

The threshold of the “Marrow Sea Tidal Wave,” which originally required three years of bitter cultivation, was breached in an instant under the washing of the dragon vein.

When the last wisp of Xuanhuang Qi was completely devoured, Xu Yunfan suddenly opened his eyes. Golden-red light flowed within his pupils, and his breathing caused the airflow within a radius of ten zhang to reverse.

Only then did he have time to look at the attribute panel in his vision.

‘Your Bone Marrow Cleansing Technique proficiency has increased significantly.’
‘Your Bone Marrow Cleansing Technique has reached Perfection.’
‘You have achieved the Buddhist Golden Body.’
‘Your Clear Mind Sword Washing Technique has reached Small Success... Great Success... Perfection.’
‘Your Mixed Origin True Seed has transformed into a True Qi Seed.’
‘You have stepped into the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining.’
‘...’

The proficiency prompts on the interface were flooding the screen. Under the infusion of the Xuanhuang Qi, one or several information prompts appeared every minute and second.

In just a short half hour, he had broken through two major realms, stepping into the Ninth Realm. Moreover, with the true qi accumulated in his body almost like mist, it was far beyond what an ordinary Ninth Realm Qi Refining Grandmaster could compare to.
