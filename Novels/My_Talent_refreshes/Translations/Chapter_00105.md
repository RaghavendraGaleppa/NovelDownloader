# Chapter 105: Bountiful Harvests

Chu Ning and the others departed from Du Han’s residence.

All the way back, their hearts were heavy. The short distance felt as if they had walked for an eternity.

Upon reaching the entrance of the shop, Gu Xiaohong looked at Lu Miaoying, who had remained silent.

“Junior Sister Lu, is there anything left to take care of in the shop? I’ll come with you. Also, why don’t you stay at my place tonight?”

Gu Xiaohong was always thoughtful of others, and this was clearly out of concern that Lu Miaoying had been too shocked today. Coupled with Luo Yiping’s death, she worried her junior sister would be scared.

To her surprise, Lu Miaoying shook her head, forcing a relaxed smile. “Senior Brother Luo left behind many spirit beasts. I still need to take good care of them. The shop needs to open again in a day or two.”

Hearing this, everyone fell silent. Chu Ning couldn't help but glance at Lu Miaoying. He hadn't paid much attention to this female disciple from the Spirit Beast Pavilion. He only knew that she was completely deferential to Luo Yiping and didn't seem to have much initiative of her own. He hadn't expected her to be so deeply devoted to Luo Yiping. And now, she was showing a strength and tenacity unlike her previous self.

After Lu Miaoying left, the others exchanged glances, preparing to return to their own places. Shen Zhengquan left first, and Gu Xiaohong lingered a few steps behind. As Chu Ning was about to enter his shop, she called out to him and quickly walked over.

Gu Xiaohong then took out the storage bag from the Yinmo Sect disciple, which she had taken earlier, and offered it to Chu Ning. “Junior Brother Chu, I must thank you again. I would surely have lost my life there today if not for you. This storage bag should be handled by Junior Brother Chu. I wouldn’t have been able to kill that person without your help.”

“Since Senior Sister insists, it would be rude for me to refuse.” Chu Ning looked at the grateful Gu Xiaohong, thought for a moment, and didn’t decline, accepting it directly. Women were more emotional after all; if he didn’t accept it, his senior sister would likely feel very apologetic.

Indeed, upon seeing Chu Ning accept the storage bag, a faint smile appeared on Gu Xiaohong’s face. This was the first time she had shown such an expression since the attack earlier that day.

After Gu Xiaohong departed, Chu Ning returned to his residence with the storage bag. He also pulled out three other storage bags from his person.

Perhaps Lin Changqing thought Chu Ning and the others had indeed suffered losses today, or perhaps he simply disdained the possessions of these Qi Condensation stage disciples, for he only took a few identity tokens from the Yinmo Sect disciples, leaving everything else behind.

At this moment, Chu Ning decided to empty all the contents of the storage bags onto his table at once. Immediately, a dazzling array of miscellaneous items made Chu Ning’s eyes slightly daze.

Since Lin Changqing had mentioned earlier that the Yin Demon Slash was cast from a Dharma Artifact, Chu Ning’s gaze first fell upon the few artifacts. He picked up the staff that the black-robed man had used to unleash the gray mist against him. A surge of Yin energy emanated from the staff, causing Chu Ning to frown slightly. Even though he wasn't very familiar with Dharma Artifacts, he knew this was an Yin-aligned object. However, upon closer inspection, this artifact was quite extraordinary; it was a mid-grade Dharma Artifact.

He attempted to inject spiritual power, and after a few tries, he quickly mastered how to use it. Two small spell formations were carved onto the artifact, corresponding to two functions. One was the gray mist that could obscure vision, which could be activated by simply channeling spiritual power. Chu Ning tested it, and it could cover a maximum range of about ten zhang. The other function was to unleash a grey light spell through spiritual power. Chu Ning carefully sensed it and found that this spell did not belong to any of the Five Elements. It faintly emitted a chilling Yin aura, indicating it was some kind of Demonic Path spell.

“This gray mist is quite a useful trick.” Although Chu Ning felt the staff was a bit unsightly, he also thought it was quite practical. It could certainly be useful in combat. The black-robed man today had coincidentally run into him. If it had been an ordinary Qi Condensation cultivator, even one at the late or perfect Qi Condensation stage, without divine sense, they would have been trapped and easily slaughtered. From how the opponent reacted to his movements, it seemed the black-robed man didn’t realize he was using divine sense to perceive. Therefore, the Spirit Refining Art should not be something of the Yinmo Sect, but rather something Qi Chongmao obtained from elsewhere.

Putting the staff away, Chu Ning looked at another Dharma Artifact, the black wheel wielded by the person Gu Xiaohong had killed. From how his opponent used it, Chu Ning could tell this was an artifact capable of both offense and defense. However, after a brief trial, Chu Ning quickly lost interest. Although this artifact could attack and defend, its quality was mediocre, barely reaching the standard of a mid-grade Dharma Artifact. Its attack mainly relied on the artifact flying out directly after activation, but controlling it would likely require specific incantations. As for defense, it only relied on a spell formation combined with the artifact's own material, which did not protect the entire body.

Chu Ning’s gaze then fell upon the other two Dharma Artifacts. The yellow-robed man he had killed used a long saber. It was also a mid-grade Dharma Artifact and seemed quite lethal. However, Chu Ning didn’t seem to have much use for it either. The first person Chu Ning killed, the man who initially faced Lu Miaoying, used a low-grade Dharma Artifact. Chu Ning simply picked it up, glanced at it, and immediately put it away, uninterested.

“I wonder if Lin Changqing can apply for a sect reward for us. If so, these Dharma Artifacts can be taken back to see if the sect can recycle them.” Chu Ning thought to himself. He would never dare to take artifacts of such dubious origin directly to Cloud Sea Pavilion for disposal. However, if the sect would recycle them, there would be no problem. After all, the sect knew their origins.

Putting away the Dharma Artifacts, Chu Ning’s eyes fell on the various bottles and jars. Chu Ning casually opened them and found that they mostly contained various elixirs. Some had one or two pills, others seven or eight. What gave Chu Ning a headache was that none of these elixirs had labels. Chu Ning neither knew what kind of elixirs they were nor what their uses were. After looking at a few bottles, he simply stopped, put them all away, and planned to ask Gu Xiaohong about them the next day.

Immediately after, Chu Ning began to count the considerable amount of one item in the storage bags: spirit stones. These Yinmo Sect members seemed to be quite wealthy. Each person carried several hundred spirit stones, totaling 1732 low-grade spirit stones. Seeing these spirit stones, Chu Ning, who had been upset about his Silver Crystal Frost Shield being damaged, finally felt a little better. Over 1,700 spirit stones might be slightly insufficient for a top-grade defensive Dharma Artifact, but it was certainly enough for a high-grade defensive Dharma Artifact. After all, at Cloud Sea Pavilion, an ordinary high-grade Dharma Artifact typically cost around 1,200 spirit stones.

There were also some scattered beast materials of various kinds. Chu Ning took a quick look at them and didn't pay them much mind. He put them all into one storage bag, along with the Dharma Artifacts he wouldn’t use. A smile spread across Chu Ning’s face. Although he had incurred some losses today, his gains were also substantial. He should have no problem recouping his losses.

After all this, Chu Ning reflected on today’s battle, his eyes flickering. He felt that his previous philosophy had some flaws. Perhaps he had thought there wouldn't be much danger around the market, and combined with the vast resources needed for cultivation, Chu Ning had spent a large amount of his resources on things that improved his cultivation realm. While he had bought some high-grade talismans and Dharma Artifacts this time, they weren't many. Especially defensive ones; he had always thought a mid-grade defensive Dharma Artifact was enough for self-defense. Now, it seemed he needed to progress on both fronts. Cultivation resources were certainly necessary, but these life-saving items could not be neglected either.

“It would be great if I can exchange these for rewards when I return to the sect. If not, I must have Lin Changqing take me to Wind Gorge Market again to buy more from Cloud Sea Pavilion.”

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately took out the Pure Yang Stone Powder, Meridian Cleansing Body Tempering Pill, and Spirit Essence Pills that had cost him a considerable amount of spirit stones today. Since the spirit stones had already been spent, he might as well put them to good use.

Picking up a Spirit Essence Pill, Chu Ning subtly sensed it for a moment, then swallowed it directly. He began cultivating the Green Wood Everspring Art. After entering the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, not only was the proficiency cap higher, but the difficulty of increasing proficiency also intensified. Even with the aid of a spiritual plant as excellent as the Iron-Stem Orchid for absorbing spiritual energy, Chu Ning still needed to spend a considerable amount of time each day to gain 2 points purely through the Green Wood Spring Radiance Art. Additionally, he also had to cultivate the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art and the Spirit Refining Art. To speed up his progress, he still needed to supplement his cultivation with spirit stones and elixirs. Moreover, Chu Ning’s Yin Wood Spirit Physique allowed for faster spiritual energy absorption, making his cultivation with spirit stones and elixirs more effective than that of ordinary cultivators.

After taking one Spirit Essence Pill and meditating for most of the morning, Chu Ning opened his eyes. An ordinary cultivator might need two or three days to digest the medicinal effects of such a Spirit Essence Pill, but Chu Ning had completely absorbed the medicinal energy in just half a day.

At this moment, Chu Ning immediately checked his cultivation progress. “The third layer proficiency of Green Wood Everspring Art increased by 3 points. This is roughly the same effect as when I took Essence Gathering Pills in the second layer. If I add my daily cultivation, gaining 4 points a day should not be a problem.”

Thinking this, Chu Ning picked up a Meridian Cleansing Body Tempering Pill. This item was not cheap either, so he wanted to see its effects. He prepared a large bathtub with warm water, then dropped a Meridian Cleansing Body Tempering Pill into it. Once the pill completely dissolved in the tub, turning the water brown, Chu Ning stepped directly into the tub to soak.

“The medicinal effect should be considerably weaker than Bloodglow Grass combined with Earth Spirit Spring Water,” Chu Ning mused inwardly as he felt his body absorbing the medicinal energy. However, he quickly became at ease. Although this Meridian Cleansing Spirit Pill cost 50 low-grade spirit stones per pill, its value was naturally much lower compared to Bloodglow Grass and Earth Spirit Spring Water. Moreover, he was in the Unwithered Bones Stage back then, whereas now he had entered the Unbroken Sinews Stage, making the difficulty of improvement naturally greater.

He circulated the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art to accelerate his absorption of the medicinal energy. After about half an hour, the water in the tub returned to its original clear state, and Chu Ning no longer felt the medicinal effects. He leaped out of the tub and began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, combining the cultivation art with its corresponding movements. After one cycle of the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, Chu Ning felt that the absorbed medicinal energy had been completely converted, and then he stopped.

He checked his proficiency levels again.

[Green Wood Everspring Art (Yellow-grade Low-tier), Third Layer (63/2100)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Unbroken Sinews (32/1500)]
[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer (440/1000)]

The proficiency of Unbroken Sinews had increased by 1 point. Chu Ning winced slightly. “50 spirit stones for 1 point. Body refinement is truly spirit stone-intensive.” After calculating, if he combined it with his daily cultivation, he should be able to gain about 2 points a day.

With his Qi cultivation and body refinement complete, Chu Ning then naturally began his charm crafting and divine sense cultivation. Most of the morning passed in such cultivation.

The next morning, after Chu Ning got up, cultivated for a while, and opened his shop, he glanced next door. To his surprise, Lu Miaoying had already opened her shop and was busily setting out edible spirit chickens, gray spirit rabbits, and spirit snakes.

“Did I get the day wrong? Is today the market day?” Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. But after thinking, he realized that wasn’t right; the market day had just been the day before yesterday, so it wasn’t time yet. He then understood: Lu Miaoying seemed to be finding something to do, as a form of emotional sustenance.

Lu Miaoying also saw Chu Ning at this moment and forced a smile. “Senior Brother Chu, good morning!” Chu Ning currently displayed a cultivation of the fifth layer of Qi Condensation, while Lu Miaoying was already close to reaching the sixth layer of Qi Condensation. Such a respectful address was clearly due to Chu Ning’s performance yesterday.

“Morning!” Chu Ning didn't specifically correct her form of address, nor did he engage in extensive conversation. After exchanging greetings, he saw that Gu Xiaohong had also opened her shop door across the way, and he walked straight towards her. Besides the elixirs from yesterday, Chu Ning also wanted her to examine the Spirit-Nourishing Pill that he had kept on him for quite some time.

“Junior Brother Chu has arrived,” Gu Xiaohong said, her tone warmer and more gentle than usual upon seeing Chu Ning. After speaking, she also noticed Lu Miaoying’s actions across the way. She paused, and a trace of worry appeared on her face. “Junior Brother Luo’s passing must have been a great blow to Junior Sister Lu. Junior Sister Lu had always been deeply fond of Junior Brother Luo, but he never seemed to realize…”

Chu Ning didn’t take up the topic, simply glancing at Gu Xiaohong. It wasn't that Luo Yiping was unaware of Lu Miaoying’s affections; it was just that he usually seemed to have thoughts for Gu Xiaohong. Of course, Chu Ning would never voice such a thing. Perhaps Gu Xiaohong herself was aware of it. After a moment’s thought, Chu Ning spoke, “It may not be a bad thing. This way, she’ll stand on her own, which might even benefit her cultivation.”

Hearing this, Gu Xiaohong looked at Chu Ning, a smile gracing her lips. “Oh, I forgot. Junior Brother Chu can manage two fronts; your cultivation speed and combat skills are far beyond what ordinary disciples can achieve.”

“Senior Sister flatters me,” Chu Ning chuckled. Then he began taking out various bottles and jars from his storage bag.
