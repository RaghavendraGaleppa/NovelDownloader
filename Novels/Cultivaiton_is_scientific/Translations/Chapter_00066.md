# Chapter 66: The Flying Vessel

"Nephew Gu, this is a good start. Let's hope we find more promising talents!" Elder Zhao appeared to be in good spirits.

"That's thanks to your auspicious influence, Elder!" Gu Jia replied with a flattering smile.

His gaze towards Li Shiming was also full of satisfaction. He hadn't expected Li Shiming to possess single or dual spiritual roots—such talents were far too rare.

Overall, Li Shiming's aptitude was decent enough to meet the requirements for joining Tianhai Sect without needing to rely on Elder Cui's influence.

"Li Shiming, you'll assist in management alongside these two. With your abilities, you should have no trouble keeping the newcomers in line," Elder Zhao instructed.

"Yes, Elder!" Li Shiming bowed in acknowledgment.

"Address me as 'Uncle' from now on. You'll soon become a formal disciple after entering the sect," Elder Zhao said, his tone noticeably warmer after assigning Li Shiming his duties.

"Thank you, Uncle!" Li Shiming bowed again.

He moved to stand beside the two cultivators, who nodded at him with smiles, pleased to have someone share their workload.

"Li Shiming, call in the next candidate," Elder Zhao soon put him to work.

As Li Shiming stepped out of the Prayer Hall, hundreds of young eyes—both boys and girls—turned toward him. He was the first to enter; some were curious about what had happened inside, while those familiar with the Ascension Assembly hoped to learn whether he had passed.

"First in line, come forward!" Ignoring their gazes, Li Shiming addressed the youth at the front, who wore robes embroidered with four-clawed golden dragons.

The boy's eyes flickered with unreadable emotions as he strode up the steps, pausing to scrutinize Li Shiming before entering the Prayer Hall.

Li Shiming paid no mind to the youth's thoughts and followed him inside.

Without any preamble, Elder Zhao didn't even speak a word. The cultivator beside him simply instructed the boy to place his hand on the Spirit Testing Wall.

"Age: fifteen years and five months. Spiritual roots: water, fire, earth, wood—quadruple affinity!" The cultivator paused to examine the height of the four light pillars before continuing, "Spiritual root quality meets the standard. Passed!"

The boy's face briefly lit up with elation before he quickly masked it with an air of arrogance.

"Next!" the cultivator said to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming went out again and summoned the second candidate—a young girl in palace attire.

The girl possessed a triple spiritual root affinity and also passed the test.

Three consecutive passes put Elder Zhao in an even better mood.

However, luck didn't hold. Soon, Li Shiming no longer needed to shuttle in and out of the Prayer Hall, instead remaining outside to call in candidates as each test concluded.

The process was swift, with each candidate taking no more than twenty seconds. Under the cultivators' imposing presence, none of the youths dared act out, all behaving with utmost obedience.

By afternoon, the testing finally drew to a close.

Li Shiming realized just how rare spiritual roots were—out of nearly four hundred youths, only thirteen possessed spiritual roots, and merely five were ultimately selected.

This meant that after Li Shiming and the two royal youths, only two others had met Tianhai Sect's standards.

The remaining eight either had penta-spiritual roots or quad-spiritual roots of insufficient quality to qualify.

Even so, Elder Zhao seemed satisfied with the results.

Among the five, the best was only a triple spiritual root—no single or dual spiritual root prodigies had appeared, contrary to expectations.

Li Shiming also got acquainted with the two cultivators—Brother Ma at the fifth layer of Qi Refining and Brother Wu at the sixth layer.

According to them, they were merely here to assist. With Elder Zhao present, no one would dare cause trouble.

Now Li Shiming had joined their ranks, assigned by Elder Zhao himself.

"Brother Gu, please look after my family. Until we meet again!" Before leaving, Li Shiming bowed deeply to Gu Jia.

"May your path of cultivation be smooth, young friend Li!" Gu Jia returned the bow.

He had seen off many talents like Li Shiming over the years, and his well-wishes were always sincere.

Just as Li Shiming was about to follow Elder Zhao out of the Prayer Hall, several figures appeared outside.

"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Zhao! Another bountiful year for Tianhai Sect, it seems," one cultivator greeted Elder Zhao cheerfully.

Their sudden appearance startled Li Shiming, but seeing they meant no harm, he relaxed.

When the newcomers' gazes fell upon Li Shiming and the other four youths, the hunger in their eyes made him feel that had Elder Zhao not been present, they might have tried to snatch them away.

"Eight others have spiritual roots. With proper nurturing, some may yet prove useful," Elder Zhao replied with a nod.

Hearing this, the cultivators lost interest in further conversation and hurried into the Prayer Hall, eager to claim the remaining candidates before their peers could.

"These are minor sects subordinate to ours. Their territories are small, so they need to supplement their disciple intake," Brother Ma quietly explained to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming felt a surge of relief—joining a major sect like Tianhai was vastly superior to these minor sects, which had to settle for the rejects.

Outside the Prayer Hall, the unsuccessful candidates had already been escorted away, returning to their ordinary lives.

Most would never know how close they had come to stepping into the world of cultivation—a realm just beyond their grasp.

With a wave of Elder Zhao's hand, Li Shiming felt his body lighten as a cushion of spiritual energy lifted him off the ground.

Passing through an invisible barrier, he beheld a flying vessel.

The vessel measured about twenty meters long, its deck crowned by a two-story pavilion with intricately carved beams and painted rafters. Ornate lanterns hung from each of the four upturned eaves.

As they landed on the deck, Li Shiming noticed the shimmer of spiritual energy beneath his feet—even the deck was crafted from spirit materials.

He studied the vessel anew, marveling at the sheer amount of rare materials required to construct such a marvel.

The pavilion's doors swung open, and Elder Zhao entered first.

"Everyone inside. Stay on the first floor—the second floor is Elder Zhao's quarters," Brother Ma instructed.

Upon entering, Li Shiming was immediately struck by the dense spiritual energy, far richer than what his Spirit Gathering Plate could produce.
