# Chapter 65: Elite Disciples  

"Senior Brother Ma!" Lin Xuan imitated Ye Tian's voice as he greeted him with a cupped fist.  

This man was named Ma Tianxiong, who had entered the sect earlier than Lin Xuan and seemed to be a disciple from the same batch as Zhou Yan. Currently, his cultivation was at the sixth layer of the Lingdong Stage.  

Strictly speaking, given the time he had spent in the sect, nine years to reach the sixth layer was impressive but not extraordinary enough to be considered a genius. Normally, he wouldn't have qualified to enter the Elite Hall. However, Ma Tianxiong's circumstances were unique.  

Before joining the Piaoyun Valley, he had been a renowned young master in the secular martial world. Later, by sheer coincidence, he embarked on the path of immortal cultivation.  

Yet, he didn't abandon his martial arts. Instead, he took an unconventional route—using martial arts as a foundation for his cultivation.  

Cases like his weren’t unheard of in the cultivation world, but they were rare. It was said that those who followed this path could never advance far in their cultivation. Achieving Core Formation was nothing but a pipe dream. However, reaching the Foundation Establishment Stage was almost guaranteed, and it was even easier for them compared to regular cultivators.  

For the Piaoyun Valley, Foundation Establishment cultivators were already the backbone of the sect. Thus, Ma Tianxiong, who had taken the martial path to cultivation, was permitted entry into the Elite Hall.  

Because of his unique circumstances, Ma Tianxiong was quite famous within the sect. Seeing that it was someone he recognized, Lin Xuan felt relieved—there was less risk of exposure. He turned and greeted the man.  

"Junior Brother Ye, I heard you recently obtained the spirit artifact 'Fire Serpent.' I thought you’d be in seclusion refining it. I didn’t expect to run into you here in the Elite Hall."  

"Haha, Senior Brother flatters me. My meager skills are nothing compared to your Mountain-Splitting Divine Art. I’ve encountered some difficulties in refining the spirit artifact, so I came to seek guidance from our master."  

Although Lin Xuan hadn’t interacted much with Ye Tian, they had entered the sect around the same time. He had a decent understanding of the man’s character.  

Ye Tian was the type of hypocritical villain who looked down on and bullied those weaker than him but acted meek and polite toward those stronger. Since Lin Xuan was impersonating him, he had to mimic this behavior.  

Sure enough, Ma Tianxiong didn’t suspect a thing. He patted Lin Xuan’s shoulder and laughed. "Haha, Junior Brother, you’re as humble as ever. Let’s go in together!"  

"Alright!" Lin Xuan nodded, quickly weighing the pros and cons in his mind. Refusing wouldn’t be difficult, but entering with Ma Tianxiong had more advantages. The Elite Hall had many restrictions, and having Ma Tianxiong handle them would reduce the risk of exposure.  

The two walked into the hall together. Ma Tianxiong made casual conversation, and Lin Xuan responded carefully, revealing no flaws.  

---  

A layer of blue light appeared before them.  

"Ugh, another identity check. It’s always like this," Ma Tianxiong grumbled before turning to ask, "Junior Brother Ye, should we use yours or mine?"  

"Haha, with Senior Brother here, how could I dare to embarrass myself?" Lin Xuan replied with a smile, though inwardly, he was relieved. He hadn’t expected an identity verification barrier. If he had come alone, he would’ve been stuck.  

"Very well." Ma Tianxiong didn’t refuse. He took out a waist token emitting spiritual energy, infused it with his divine sense, and swiped it across the blue light. After verifying his identity as a registered elite disciple, the barrier parted. Lin Xuan quickly followed behind.  

They passed several more barriers like this along the way, leaving Lin Xuan inwardly exasperated. The Elite Hall didn’t even house any treasures—it was just a place for certain elders to cultivate and for elite disciples to seek guidance. Why were the defenses so tight?  

About ten minutes later, they arrived at a magnificent hall. While it wasn’t as spacious as the training hall in the Zhiying Pavilion, it was far more luxurious in terms of furnishings. Lin Xuan couldn’t help but marvel—the sect truly treated its elite disciples differently.  

Coincidentally, today was the day a highly accomplished elder—rumored to be at the peak of Foundation Establishment—was scheduled to give a lecture. The elite disciples, who usually trained separately, had all gathered.  

There were over thirty of them. Lin Xuan scanned the room and recognized only about half. Fortunately, these elite disciples were all aloof and didn’t seem inclined to greet him.  

Ma Tianxiong seemed to be the exception, likely due to his background in the secular martial world. He went around greeting everyone one by one. Some returned the courtesy with a cupped fist, while others merely snorted and ignored him. Strangely, Ma Tianxiong didn’t seem to mind.  

Whether out of pride or competition, none of these so-called elites concealed their auras. Without even probing, Lin Xuan could clearly discern their cultivation levels.  

After surveying the room, Lin Xuan—who had been somewhat proud of reaching the sixth layer of the Lingdong Stage—felt a blow to his confidence.  

Elites were indeed elites. Most of them were at the sixth layer. Of course, many of these senior brothers and sisters had entered the sect earlier than him. But considering they had achieved this with only the meager resources provided by the sect, relying solely on their superior spiritual roots, Lin Xuan couldn’t help but feel envious.  

Only a few were at the fifth layer, and the "weakest" among them was at the peak of the fourth layer. Yet, no one dared to look down on this "weakest" elite disciple—because he was only twelve years old and had joined the Piaoyun Valley just a year ago.  

In just one year, he had reached the peak of the mid-Lingdong Stage. That kid was a true genius.  

Of course, the most eye-catching figures weren’t these disciples but the two seated at the very front. Both appeared to be around thirty years old.  

Their cultivation had already reached the pinnacle of the Lingdong Stage—the Great Perfection.  

They were just one step away from Foundation Establishment!  

Their presence also set them apart from the other elite disciples.  

Though Lin Xuan was surprised, deep down, he still believed himself to be stronger. Back then, Yan Tianheng had also been at the Great Perfection of the Lingdong Stage, yet Lin Xuan had defeated him even when he himself was only at the mid-Lingdong Stage.  

As for the battle a month ago, Ye Tian had been a sixth-layer demonic cultivator with bizarre spells and the Hundred Soul Banner—his strength should have surpassed these two Great Perfection disciples. Yet, he had still lost to Lin Xuan.  

Maintaining a calm expression, Lin Xuan found a corner and sat down.
