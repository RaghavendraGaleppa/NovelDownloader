# Chapter 87: Slaying Earth Demons, Obtaining the Violet Sun Fruit

With these thoughts, Yang Ji immediately rose and headed towards the Hellish Forging Ground.

The Hellish Forging Ground, alongside the Heavenly Demon Forging Ground and the Ten Directions Forging Ground, was a training area established by the sect's Mahayana cultivators using great divine abilities for their disciples. It connected to the Underworld, the domain of the Earth Demon race. The Underworld was rich in ores, spiritual veins, and various rare materials. The sect had used its divine abilities to open up a relatively fertile forging ground within it, allowing all disciples to enter for exploration and training.

However, as a forging ground, danger was inherent. Records stated that many disciples died each year while training in the forging ground, but similarly, the rewards were exceptionally generous. Some disciples ventured deep into the Underworld and discovered numerous rare treasures, such as Earth Spirit Milk, Ten-Thousand-Year Iron Essence, top-grade spiritual ores, Immortal Crystal Stones, and so forth. Despite the dangers, where there was profit, nothing could deter them; many disciples still went.

After several teleports, Yang Ji arrived before a palace that bore the inscription: “Entrance to the Hellish Forging Ground.” The hall was bustling with disciples coming and going. He immediately sought out a less crowded teleportation tunnel and walked towards it.

“Is the junior brother here to enter the Hellish Forging Ground?” an Incarnation realm deacon guarding the teleportation array called out to Yang Ji.

“Yes, Senior Brother, I intend to go to the Hellish Forging Ground for some training,” Yang Ji replied.

“The teleportation array beneath your feet leads directly to the forging ground. There is a light barrier there, within which our sect's experts are stationed. Outside the light barrier, however, you are unprotected and constantly face the danger of encountering the Earth Demon race. Do you understand?” the deacon asked.

“I understand,” Yang Ji nodded.

“Very well, then go forth. Be careful, and do not venture too deep alone,” the deacon advised.

Yang Ji nodded in understanding, stepped onto the teleportation array, and after a moment of dizziness, he found himself in the Underworld. Though it was underground, it wasn't completely dark. It was as if this world was the inverse of the surface world, a reversal of Yin and Yang. There was a sky here too, but it was dark. Only tiny plankton floating in the void emitted specks of light, casting a gentle glow that slightly illuminated the Underworld. Fertile black earth covered the landscape, permeated by a strong earthy scent. There were mountains and rivers, but scarce green vegetation. The overall tone was dark.

Yang Ji looked behind him. There was a palace, from which a light barrier extended, covering an area of ten li. Clearly, this was the protective barrier. Yang Ji glanced at the map in his Sea of Consciousness and immediately flew forward, following its guidance.

Before long, he had flown out of the light barrier. For safety, he stopped flying and instead walked upon the black earth. After all, this was the domain of the Earth Demon race. Flying would be too conspicuous. If a Demon Venerable were to discover him, they could probably snatch him away from tens of thousands of miles, so he dared not be too ostentatious.

Thus, concealing his aura, he walked for several hundred li. Suddenly, Yang Ji opened his eyes wide and saw information appear: [Three low-tier Earth Demon Kings are lying in wait in the pit ahead.]

Three low-tier Earth Demon Kings? These were beings equivalent to first-stage Nascent Soul cultivators. He hadn't expected to encounter three at once. The three Earth Demon Kings blocked his path forward. As Yang Ji pondered, he quietly approached, his ears catching faint, sinister cackles.

“Heh, these humans truly don't know what's good for them. To dare come to our Earth Demon race's territory for training, they're practically asking for death. How could the treasures of the underworld be something they can lay their hands on?”

“Human cultivators are excellent supplements. Devouring one can equal several, even ten, years of arduous cultivation, and they taste exquisite. The more, the better! I truly hope they come down more often.”

“Heh, I heard that a few days ago, Demon Emperor Chian used a treasure to set a trap and devoured many Dao Sect disciples. Their flesh and blood were so fragrant, it was truly comfortable.”

“Don't be careless. There are also powerful existences among the Dao Sect disciples. There's an Incarnation cultivator named Qingfeng who charged tens of thousands of li deep, killing several of our Demon Emperors. His arrogance was outrageous, and even our Demon Venerable Chixiao personally intervened but couldn't subdue him. It truly infuriated the Demon Venerable.”

“Indeed, the Wuji Dao Sect has no shortage of formidable individuals, but how could our Earth Demon race not have our own experts? We merely kill each other. It's been so long since I've eaten a human cultivator, I miss it so much.”

“Heh, today we're staking out here. If we could encounter a female human cultivator, that would be wonderful! I'd absorb her Yin essence while eating her tender flesh. Just thinking about it feels marvelous.”

“Is that so? How marvelous exactly?” Suddenly, a cold, clear voice echoed in the ears of the three Earth Demon Kings.

“Who?!” Abruptly, a terrifying, murderous aura enveloped them, instantly causing them to blanch in fright. They frantically drew their blades and retreated three zhang.

Yang Ji now clearly saw their appearances. One Earth Demon had a green face and fangs, with backward-pointing thorns on its back. Another Earth Demon was covered in armor with a blood-red gaping maw. The third Earth Demon had bestial feet and claws, resembling a human but with horns on its head.

As soon as the three demons saw Yang Ji, they exclaimed in shock and rage, “A human cultivator?!”

“Precisely!” Their response was a dazzling radiance and unmatched sword qi. As Yang Ji's sword wings unfurled from his back, countless sharp sword qi surged out in a strangling torrent, striking with unparalleled speed and instantly bisecting the three still-shocked Earth Demon Kings.

The unparalleled, incandescent sword qi pierced through the three demons' bodies, annihilating their primordial spirits along with them. In an instant, the three demons died.

“Heh heh, these devils encountered a true killing star like you, yet they still wanted to eat meat, oh no, they dared to provoke Master, and even wanted to eat your flesh! They truly didn't know what was good for them. Let me eat them to vent Master's anger, wah!” The three-inch Buddha Child suddenly flew out from his sleeve, black qi billowing around him, demonic flames surging. It transformed into a monstrous maw that seemed capable of devouring heaven and earth, instantly swallowing the bodies of the three Earth Demon Kings. The Buddha Child retracted his divine ability, let out a satisfied burp, patted his belly, and revealed a look of contentment.

“You rascal,” Yang Ji squinted at him.

“Heh heh, Master, leaving their bodies here would be a waste. It's better for me to devour them to increase my cultivation. Once I'm stronger, I can serve Master better,” the Buddha Child said with a fawning smile.

“What divine ability is that?” Yang Ji asked.

“Master, this is Demonic Devourer of Heaven and Earth, a great divine ability from the Buddha-Demon Scripture. With this ability, I can devour all things to increase my magic power,” the Buddha Child chuckled.

Yang Ji cast a glance at him, saying nothing more, and the Buddha Child obediently burrowed back into his sleeve.

He continued forward, encountering various ferocious Earth Demons along the way, all of whom he slew. The Buddha Child remained hidden in his sleeve, devouring along the way, thoroughly content. Following the map, he ventured a full thirty thousand li deep until Yang Ji finally arrived at the foot of a mountain. The mountain was barren, covered in scattered rocks, and quite unremarkable. However, the map indicated that the Violet Sun Tree was located within a cave inside this mountain range.

Following a faint aura emanating from the map, Yang Ji searched around and finally discovered a clue on a stone wall. The aura from the stone wall was identical to the one emitted by the map Elder Chunye had given him.

“A restriction! This was originally a stone cave. It seems Senior Chunye secretly sealed it away back then.” Yang Ji's expression lit up. Just then, the map in his mind, perhaps sensing the aura on the stone wall, transformed into a streak of light, shot out, and struck the stone wall. Instantly, the stone wall rippled like water, and with a flash of spiritual light, the stone cave reappeared.

Seeing this, Yang Ji glanced inside, and with a joyful expression, instantly teleported in. When he emerged, the smile on his face was incredibly wide, clearly indicating that he had obtained three ripe Violet Sun Fruits inside. Three fruits, enough to elevate his root bones to the Upper-Grade level. Yang Ji hadn't expected to obtain the Violet Sun Fruit so easily; it was truly a stroke of luck and destiny. He couldn't help but sigh, perhaps he was also a Child of Destiny, otherwise, why would his luck be so good?

Joyful as he was, he didn't forget that this was the Hellish Forging Ground. After concealing the cave dwelling, he left the area.
