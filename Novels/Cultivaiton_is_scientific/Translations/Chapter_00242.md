# Chapter 242: Ambush

Li Yuanba was flying through the Hundred Thousand Mountains using his sword flight technique. Ever since cultivating the "Sword Intent Soaring to the Skies Art," he had rarely used flying boats anymore—though this was also because he hadn't undertaken any long-distance journeys during this period.

Even now, as he prepared to cross the Hundred Thousand Mountains to reach the territory of the righteous path, he still relied on sword flight. Long-distance sword flight had some effect in tempering his sword intent.

Over the past year, his strength had improved rapidly, but his sword intent lacked real combat experience. Without being honed in battle, it felt like an unsharpened blade.

His gaze fell into the distance, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

With his heightened perception, he had long noticed the hidden observers lurking in the distance.

Li Yuanba recalled Sword Elder's warning—his possession of Core Formation resources had made him a target for demonic cultivators within the sect.

Rather than fear, he felt excitement.

"Hold it!" a cold voice rang out as four mid-stage Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators emerged from their hiding spots below, blocking his path.

"What do you want?" Li Yuanba demanded sharply as he halted.

"Senior Brother Lin will arrive shortly. He asked us to request you wait a moment!" one of the demonic cultivators said with a cupped fist.

Despite being four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, they dared not be disrespectful to Li Yuanba. He was a sword cultivator. Even with their numerical advantage, they couldn't guarantee they'd fare well against him.

Since becoming a true disciple, Li Yuanba's known combat feats were few, but just the fact that he had slain the Jueyuan Buddha was enough to make sect demonic cultivators wary. The Jueyuan Buddha had killed many sect demonic cultivators, and Li Yuanba's achievement spoke volumes about his strength.

"What Senior Brother Lin is worth my time waiting for?" Li Yuanba waved impatiently.

Ignoring the four blocking his path, he activated his sword light, preparing to fly past them.

"Stop him!" A red streak of light rapidly approached from behind, the voice preceding it.

Without hesitation, the four mid-stage Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators unleashed their spiritual artifacts.

They didn't resort to underhanded methods, merely intending to delay Li Yuanba for a few breaths—just enough to fulfill Senior Brother Lin Ping's orders.

"Seeking death!" Li Yuanba roared as his sword light flashed.

The moment the sword light appeared, the four demonic cultivators stiffened. A terrifying surge of Yang energy radiated from the sword light like a blazing sun.

Yang energy was inherently counter to demonic cultivation techniques. Since they were all at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, the suppression effect was especially pronounced.

The four demonic cultivators found their spiritual power sluggish, momentarily difficult to mobilize.

Spiritual power was the foundation of a cultivator's strength. Without it, their artifacts and secret techniques couldn't be activated in time.

The sword light passed through the four demonic cultivators. By the time Li Yuanba retracted it, only a single breath had passed—yet all four demonic cultivators had lost all signs of life.

Li Yuanba sensed the terrifying potency of the Yang energy within his sword intent. At the very least, it had an unimaginably potent effect against demonic cultivators.

"You dare kill my men? You're dead!" Lin Ping had arrived, but he was a step too late—only catching sight of the four corpses plummeting to the ground.

Lin Ping was a true disciple at the late-stage of Foundation Establishment. He had been frantically completing missions to gather Core Formation resources.

When he heard that a newcomer like Li Yuanba had claimed a set of Core Formation resources, he was furious enough to consider murder. Upon learning of Li Yuanba's departure from the sect, he was the first to react, immediately giving chase and ordering his subordinates to intercept.

Lin Ping waved his hand, summoning a cloud of poisonous mist filled with a buzzing sound—a swarm of venomous insects.

These were his Iron-Winged Mist Insects, ranked among the most notorious venomous creatures in the world. Each insect could control a patch of poisonous mist, and together, they formed a vast, deadly miasma.

Moreover, Iron-Winged Mist Insects were among the fastest of venomous creatures. Without specialized countermeasures, ordinary methods couldn't exterminate them.

Li Yuanba flicked his wrist, sending his sword light toward the swarm.

As it neared, the sword intent within the light transformed into countless threads, weaving a net of sword energy. The sword light itself split, intertwining the physical and ethereal, enveloping the swarm.

A cacophony of shrill shrieks erupted as the sword intent made contact with the insects. The Yang energy within annihilated their bodies before they could react.

Though Li Yuanba had never studied specialized techniques for dealing with venomous creatures, the "Sword Intent Soaring to the Skies Art" was more than sufficient. The combination of sword light division and sword intent left the Iron-Winged Mist Insects defenseless.

"My Iron-Winged Mist Insects!" Lin Ping had little interaction with Li Yuanba and underestimated his strength. Watching his painstakingly cultivated insects being slaughtered en masse, he felt as though his heart was being torn apart.

The insects had cost him immense effort—they represented nearly half of his combat power.

But Li Yuanba paid him no heed. The net of sword intent tightened further, annihilating every last insect without mercy.

However, a true disciple who had survived to the late-stage of Foundation Establishment quickly reassessed the situation.

Instead of pressing forward, Lin Ping retreated. Despite his grief, he summoned two more swarms of Iron-Winged Mist Insects to shield himself.

"Don't think you can just sit back and reap the rewards! His strength is beyond any one of us!" Lin Ping shouted as he fell back.

He knew that when he left the sect, several familiar auras of fellow true disciples had followed. Now, his priority was killing Li Yuanba. The matter of Core Formation resources could be settled afterward.

If he continued attacking alone, he might just pave the way for the others to swoop in and claim the spoils.

He had been confident in his own strength. Though Li Yuanba was a true disciple and a sword cultivator, he had only joined the sect a few years ago—his power shouldn't be overwhelming.

"Lin Ping, to see you in such a sorry state!" A voice rang out from Li Yuanba's left as two figures appeared—one a cultivator, the other a peak Iron Corpse.

Li Yuanba's eyes narrowed. Regardless of the demonic cultivator's combat prowess, the Iron Corpse beside him radiated the aura of a peak-level entity, its skin shimmering with silver light—a sign it was nearing the Silver Corpse stage.

He knew how terrifying a peak Iron Corpse could be—Jiang Chen was one.

Of course, Jiang Chen was special. Originally a Golden Core sword cultivator before being refined into an Iron Corpse, his true strength couldn't advance to the Silver Corpse stage. Still, his attacks carried traces of a Golden Core sword cultivator's intent, making him far stronger than ordinary peak Iron Corpses.

"Li Yuanba, parading around with Core Formation resources—if we let you live, wouldn't that make us look incompetent?" Another voice came from the right.

Li Yuanba turned to see a late-stage Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator surrounded by flickering illusions—figures appearing and vanishing like mirages.

"Just the three of you? That's not enough to kill me," Li Yuanba said coldly, eyeing the newcomers.

"Du Ke, true disciple of the Netherworld Sect. Hand over the Core Formation resources you stole, and I'll leave your corpse intact," the cultivator on the left—Du Ke—said icily, unfazed by Li Yuanba's dismissiveness.

"Yu Piao, true disciple of the Netherworld Sect. Remember this name—I'll be the one to kill you," the one on the right added.

"Be careful, both of you. His sword intent is unusual," Lin Ping warned from his position in midair.

The three demonic cultivators had formed a triangle, trapping Li Yuanba in the center.

"Lin Ping, you only became a true disciple because of those bugs. Once they're countered, you're useless. I'm ashamed to share the same title with you," Du Ke sneered.

"Du Ke, you're one to talk—relying on that corpse of yours. Why don't you refine yourself into one?" Lin Ping shot back.

Even while facing a common enemy, demonic cultivators were hardly cooperative. Before the battle had even begun, they were already at each other's throats.

"Enough bickering. Let's settle this—the Mountain-Sundering Pill ingredients go to me. The rest is yours," Yu Piao interjected, raising a hand.

"Dream on! I'm taking the Mountain-Sundering Pill!" Lin Ping snapped.

"Yu Piao, why don't you just take it all?" Du Ke retorted sarcastically.

Li Yuanba watched the three Netherworld Sect true disciples with amusement. Anyone listening would think they had already killed him and divided the spoils.

But he soon realized their ploy—their argument was a stalling tactic. More cultivators were approaching from all directions.

The three true disciples had arrived first, while their subordinates lagged behind.

Having witnessed Li Yuanba's strength—Lin Ping's insects, formidable as they were, had been wiped out in moments—they knew overwhelming numbers were necessary to take him down.

Li Yuanba remained still, sensing the approaching demonic cultivators. All were at the Foundation Establishment stage, with the strongest only at late-stage.

As long as they were Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators, he could fight.

Within ten breaths, over twenty demonic cultivators surrounded him, their gazes filled with greed.

Li Yuanba mused that if he threw out his storage bracelet now, these cultivators would likely turn on each other instantly.

But that was just a passing thought. His blood was boiling—he couldn't wait to test his combat prowess.

He struck first at Du Ke's side. Though Du Ke only had six cultivators with him, he also commanded ten Iron Corpses, making his group the strongest.

Li Yuanba chose this direction because his sword intent had a natural advantage against corpse puppets.

He had tested it on Jiang Chen before. Even though Jiang Chen was his own bonded corpse puppet—and thus should have been immune to his unintentional energy influences—the Yang energy within the sword intent still terrified him, even triggering an instinct to flee.

If that was how his own puppet reacted, how much more effective would it be against an enemy's?

Today, he would find out. Du Ke's ten Iron Corpses were perfect test subjects.

His sword light shot toward Du Ke's group.

Though surprised by the sudden attack, Du Ke laughed and ordered his subordinates to engage.

With Li Yuanba surrounded, Du Ke saw him as a fish caught in a net. His real concern was the other two true disciples.

Li Yuanba attacking him first suited his plans—kill him, seize the storage bracelet, and leave before the others could interfere.

But as he plotted, a primal dread seized him—the instinctive fear of a natural predator.

Li Yuanba's sword light closed in, bypassing the demonic cultivators—their artifacts provided some defense—and targeting the ten Iron Corpses, which relied solely on their innate resilience.

The sword intent within the light surged like a rising sun. The advancing corpses froze. Du Ke's peak Iron Corpse hesitated, while the nine weaker ones turned and fled.

But none were faster than the sword light. Under Li Yuanba's control, it beheaded corpse after corpse.

Now wielding his flying sword with divine sense, Li Yuanba's "Sword Intent Soaring to the Skies Art" was at least twenty percent more powerful.

Coupled with the innate advantage of Yang energy against corpse puppets, the ten Iron Corpses were annihilated in moments.

Even Du Ke's peak Iron Corpse was no exception. The Yang energy hindered its movements, and under divine sense control, the flying sword dispatched it as easily as the others.

Du Ke and his six subordinates groaned in unison as their spiritual connections to the corpses were severed, injuring their minds.

"Die!" Li Yuanba roared, focusing all his sword intent into the flying sword as it shot toward Du Ke.

Though Du Ke's artifact shield blocked the strike, the impact further damaged his already injured mind. Another hit would worsen the backlash.

"Stop him!" Du Ke screamed for help.

Only now did Lin Ping and Yu Piao react, stunned by the swift annihilation of the ten Iron Corpses.

"Surround him! If he lives, we're doomed!" the two true disciples ordered in unison, their voices tinged with fear.

This terrifying sword cultivator reminded them of Sword Elder.

If Li Yuanba were allowed to grow, he would become another Sword Elder—and then they'd face his relentless vengeance.

A fully matured sword cultivator was a nightmare. This was no longer about Core Formation resources—it was a matter of life and death.
