# Chapter 334: Nothing Much

Even if Bi Yuan were to step before Xu Yunfan and compete solely on the quantity of true qi within their bodies, he might still fall slightly short.

Xu Yunfan slowly exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, suppressing the turbulent emotions surging in his chest.

His gaze swept across the surroundings. He saw that during this time, only a dozen or so Dao Sect disciples had gathered below, all bearing injuries. Some clutched bleeding arms, while others leaned on broken weapons just to stay standing.

These were all Dao Sect disciples, their faces etched with shock, anger, and indignation.

The sudden attack by the Great Zhou army had caught them off guard, resulting in heavy casualties.

In the distance, the setting sun was as red as blood. Dozens of Great Zhou soldiers lay scattered across the bluestone slabs, their still-unclotted blood snaking through the cracks between the bricks.

With a crisp *clang*, Bi Sheng sheathed his rust-covered iron sword. The blood soaking the blade seemed to writhe like a living thing amidst the mottled rust, turning the originally dark red iron rust into a bizarre purplish-black.

He raised a hand to wipe away a streak of blood on his cheek, his voice as sharp as clashing cold iron: "Lead all the disciples out of Yujing. Set out immediately. I will clear the way for you."

Bi Sheng retracted his gaze from the direction of the Imperial City; the blood grooves on his mottled iron sword still held traces of un-dried blood.

He turned to face Xu Yunfan on the stage, whose aura was slowly converging. The usually cold and hard voice revealed a rare hint of warmth: "The path ahead, you must walk on your own."

"I understand," Xu Yunfan replied.

His voice was as calm as a deep pool.

Bi Sheng nodded slightly. "Now that you bear the Dragon Qi, if the Empress dares to harm you in the shadows, she would be severing the lineage of Great Zhou herself. They only have a chance on the擂台 (arena). You... must emerge victorious!"

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed like lightning. The true qi around his body suddenly condensed, turning into a tangible golden brilliance that flowed over his skin before rapidly retracting inward.

He cupped his fist in a salute, his voice steady as iron: "Rest assured, Senior Uncle. Since this disciple has been bestowed with Dragon Qi, I shall naturally prove the Dao with martial prowess. This is also my path."

Bi Sheng nodded slightly. True qi swirled around his fingertips, gathering onto the iron sword. The rust-covered blade let out a low hum within its sheath.

As he turned, the hem of his black robe swept over the un-dried blood on the bluestone, leaving behind a dark red trail.

"Follow me, everyone. I shall clear the way for you."

The voice wasn't loud, yet it made every disciple of the Dao Sect straighten their backs.

Xu Yunfan watched as everyone left, his gaze lingering for a moment on Chen Hong's retreating figure.

This round-faced disciple's clothes, though covered in dust, didn't have a single tear. In a group where everyone was wounded, he stood out conspicuously.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, his knuckles unconsciously tapping the handle of his撼岳镇海锤 (Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer). Amidst the trembling of the metal, a barely audible sneer was mixed in.

He paid no more attention and looked down from the arena.

The area below the arena had long been cleared. Bluestone slabs were littered with crushed name tags and torn colorful ribbons.

Only three officials remained, huddled under a tung oil umbrella. The leading one was constantly wiping the bloodstains on his body with a silk handkerchief.

When Xu Yunfan looked over, the official's handkerchief fell with a *snap*.

A glint flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. When he grinned, the white teeth he revealed were as chilling as a blade's edge.

By this time, the spectators below the arena had long since vanished, leaving only a few officials from the Great Zhou government presiding over the martial arts imperial examination.

"Esteemed Official," Xu Yunfan said.

He stepped down, crushing a half-broken arrow lying at his feet. The sound of the steel arrow shaft cracking under his boot was spine-chilling.

"I have already advanced. When will the next擂台 (arena) battle be?"

Only by continuously fighting in the arena and completing the imperial examination process could the final victor be truly determined.

This was an indispensable process, one that Xu Yunfan had to navigate alone to reach the final outcome.

The official's Adam's apple bobbed violently. Cold sweat slid down his temples, soaking the cloud goose insignia embroidered on the collar of his official robe.

He opened his mouth, but before he could speak, a voice carrying the scent of iron and blood boomed like muffled thunder: "The imperial examination proceeds as normal. Everything remains unchanged."

"Tell him the time."

The moment this voice sounded, the temperature around the martial arts stage dropped sharply.

Xu Yunfan's pupils contracted slightly. He saw that不知何时 (at some point), a tower-like figure had appeared below the arena.

The Grand Commander of the Imperial City Guard, Chen Wei, held a seven-grade divine weapon, a twelve-foot-long black spear. The tip of the spear pointed diagonally at the ground. Under the illumination of the true qi surging from his palm, the dark red blood groove emitted a bizarre glow.

Xu Yunfan's right hand instinctively rested on the twin hammers at his waist, his fingertips tracing the uneven anti-slip patterns on the hammer handles.

Suddenly, he heard the sound of bowstrings tightening, *creaking* from the surrounding roof ridges.

Three hundred Imperial Guards emerged from the shadows of the streets and alleys, forming a formation. The steel forest formed by the玄铁 (titanium-steel) spear tips gleamed coldly in the rain. The bright yellow silk bands wrapped around the spear shafts indicated they were the Empress's personal guards.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and looked at him. "Commander Chen, are you planning to use these people to fill the pit?"

Chen Wei let out a cold laugh, the killing intent in his eyes undisguised.

"Heaven wishes to make someone perish, it must first make them mad. You won't live long."

The official suddenly straightened his腰杆 (waist/back), his voice carrying the confidence given to him by Chen Wei.

"The next match is set for tomorrow's辰时 (7-9 AM)!"

He pointed north with a trembling finger. "Central Square of Yujing City, the Xuanwu Arena! By then, the top three martial artists from the Six Paths and Seventy-Nine Prefectures under heaven will all gather!"

The six top sects of Great Zhou naturally did not need to participate. They would only step in after the so-called martial arts champions had battled it out to produce seven victors.

But Xu Yunfan was different. He needed to walk step by step to the very end.

This was exactly in line with the Dao Sect's intentions. Every victory would bring down the Yellow Qi of the Great Zhou Dragon Vein to cleanse him, increasing his power and true qi.

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. He took a step down from the arena, and spiderweb-like cracks immediately appeared on the bluestone slab.

When he stopped three zhang away from Chen Wei, Chen Wei slightly raised the black spear in his hand. The tip instantly emitted a sound like the clash of metal and weapons. Several strands of spear qi shot out, gouging several deep, bottomless holes at Xu Yunfan's feet.

"Commander Chen, do you want to fight me?"

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm, a hint of eagerness flashing in his eyes.

He really wanted to test exactly how far his strength had progressed. The vast amount of cultivation memories in his mind kept surging, making him nothing like a warrior who had just entered the Ninth Realm.

Xu Yunfan was a top-notch expert who had immersed himself in the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining for at least a full sixty years.

He noticed that the tip of Chen Wei's twelve-foot steel spear was always pointed diagonally at the ground. This was the starting stance for the "Earth-Splitting Spear Formation" used by the Imperial City Guard in battlefield combat.

Chen Wei suddenly sneered, slamming the spear shaft heavily into the ground, causing the iron armor of the surrounding Imperial Guards to clang: "I have received His Majesty's decree. I am here today to 'escort' you back to the post house."

His tower-like figure pressed forward half a step, a muffled echo coming from behind his玄铁 (titanium-steel) face mask.

"After all... if anything were to happen to you, wouldn't the fortune of the Dao Sect be a pity."

From the distant roof ridges came the sound of tiles shifting lightly. The cold glint of three hundred Soul-Eroding Crossbows flickered under the setting sun, their poisoned arrowheads locked onto Xu Yunfan's vital points.

Xu Yunfan suddenly laughed, shaking his head slightly. "Look at you, thinking about all sorts of useless things."

He turned and walked out of the arena. He didn't even need to use true qi. Relying solely on his physical body, every step he took made the surroundings tremble slightly.
