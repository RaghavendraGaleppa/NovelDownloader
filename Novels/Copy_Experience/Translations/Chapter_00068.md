# Chapter 68: The Grand Auction (Two-in-One Chapter)

A wave of discussions rippled through the hall; the item Mo Qingchan had presented had truly astounded everyone.

Magic tools, spirit artifacts, and magic treasures corresponded respectively to the Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, and Core Formation cultivation stages. Just as higher realms possessed overwhelming power over lower ones, the might of spirit artifacts held a crushing advantage over magic tools. No matter how powerful a magic tool, it couldn't even unleash a tenth of the power of the weakest spirit artifact.

However, precisely because of their immense power, only Foundation Establishment cultivators' liquid spiritual energy could activate them. Even a tenth-level Qi Condensation cultivator would find their entire reservoir of spiritual energy insufficient to effectively wield one. But if a spirit artifact were damaged, the situation would be different. Its power would plummet, and its activation difficulty would decrease, making it possible for Qi Condensation cultivators to wield. Consequently, such an item became a coveted trump card for Qi Condensation cultivators.

However, damaged spirit artifacts were exceedingly rare in this world. After all, a single spirit artifact cost several thousand spirit stones; no one would be so profligate as to intentionally destroy an item of such caliber. Foundation Establishment cultivators could only break spirit artifacts during extremely fierce battles. It was precisely for this reason that everyone was so surprised when a damaged spirit artifact appeared here.

Lu Xu's spirits immediately lifted, and he stared wide-eyed at the jade box in the hands of the black-robed figure, whom Mo Qingchan was disguised as. A damaged spirit artifact – this was exactly what he needed right now. If he could obtain this item, his combat strength would immediately increase significantly.

Only after the discussions among the crowd subsided did Mo Qingchan's voice sound again: "This damaged spirit artifact has not been broken for long, and its power is extremely terrifying. A cultivator at the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation can use it to instantly slay any opponent in the Qi Condensation stage!"

Her words immediately made everyone's eyes burn with fervent desire.

"Please, fellow Daoist, open the jade box and let us observe the appearance of this spirit artifact!"

"Indeed, we wish to see what a damaged spirit artifact looks like!"

"May I ask what you wish to exchange this spirit artifact for, fellow Daoist?"

Questions rang out one after another, and the hall instantly became exceptionally lively. Hardly anyone could resist the allure of this item. Mo Qingchan's hoarse voice sounded again from beneath her black robe: "Fellow Daoists, do not rush. I am about to display this item for all of you to see!"

As she spoke, she opened the jade box. After a flash of red light, an incredibly scorching aura emanated from within. In an instant, the temperature throughout the entire hall rose significantly.

Everyone quickly widened their eyes and looked into the jade box, only to see a broken jade ruler contained within. The jade ruler was entirely fiery red, appearing to be only half of its original length, with a scorching aura emanating from its fracture.

"This item is called the Blazing Flame Ruler. It was damaged approximately seventy years ago. Normally, it must be stored and suppressed within an artifact made of ice jade, otherwise, its divine essence will completely dissipate!"

As Mo Qingchan's voice faded, someone immediately asked: "So, this damaged spirit artifact incurs a certain loss each time it's used, and if used too many times, it will become useless?"

Mo Qingchan nodded, "Indeed, most damaged spirit artifacts are like this. However, fellow Daoist, you need not worry. To render such a damaged spirit artifact useless, it would require at least a hundred uses!"

Upon hearing this, people couldn't help but frown. So, this damaged spirit artifact had usage limitations. This significantly reduced its value. Many who had just seen the item were thinking of acquiring it as a treasured family heirloom, a part of their foundational strength. However, a hundred uses was not a small number, and if one didn't consider the long-term, it was still worth contending for.

"What do you wish to exchange for, fellow Daoist?" a voice inquired.

Mo Qingchan still replied in a hoarse voice, "Qi Gathering Pills. This old man desires Qi Gathering Pills suitable for late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators! At least three bottles are required for the exchange!"

"Three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills?" Upon hearing this, everyone present gasped, finding the price somewhat prohibitive. Qi Gathering Pills were very expensive and rare elixirs. While the late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators present weren't so poor as to be unable to afford even one bottle, many had only consumed two or three bottles throughout their years of cultivation. Now, to demand three bottles at once, truly few people could produce them.

"Qi Gathering Pills? It seems she wants to enter the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation realm as quickly as possible?" Lu Xu secretly thought to himself upon hearing this. There was no bottleneck between the ninth and tenth levels of Qi Condensation; one could enter as long as their spiritual energy accumulation was sufficient. In fact, the tenth level of Qi Condensation could hardly be considered a separate minor realm; it was a state within the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation. But even without a bottleneck, accumulating enough spiritual energy to reach the tenth level of Qi Condensation was not an easy task and required considerable time. Mo Qingchan exchanging for elixirs seemed to indicate her desire to shorten the time needed to reach the tenth level. Indeed, she was preparing for a demon hunt, so it was not surprising that she wanted to quickly raise her strength to the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation.

"Given this, she might even possess more than one damaged spirit artifact. As expected of someone from a Foundation Establishment family!" Lu Xu mused.

"Fellow Daoist, your demand is perhaps too high. Who can produce three bottles of elixirs?" someone remarked.

"Compared to the value of a damaged spirit artifact, three bottles of elixirs are not excessive!" Mo Qingchan stated calmly.

The crowd fell silent. After a long while, no one stepped forward to make the exchange; truly, hardly anyone could produce three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills. Mo Qingchan looked somewhat disappointed, "Can no one produce three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills?"

"If fellow Daoist were to lower the demands, perhaps someone could exchange with you!"

Mo Qingchan shook her head, "It's impossible to lower the conditions. If I did, this old man would incur a loss! Bringing out this item was a decision this old man struggled with for a long time. If no one wishes to exchange for it, then so be it; I will use it myself in the future!" With that, Mo Qingchan closed the jade box and walked off the stage.

Lu Xu's eyes flickered. He had been observing dispassionately and ultimately did not make a move. He had used up his Qi Gathering Pills to break through to the ninth level of Qi Condensation, so he indeed could not produce three bottles. However, since he knew this damaged spirit artifact was in Mo Qingchan's hands, he would still have a chance to acquire it after returning. Furthermore, exchanging privately might be safer. If he were to produce three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills here, he would undoubtedly become a target, far too conspicuous.

"Indeed, as Hu Jun said, quite a few good items appeared at this exchange! If I hadn't developed divine sense and couldn't discern who was truly behind the mask, I might have genuinely missed out on this damaged spirit artifact!"

After watching for a while longer, Lu Xu finally encountered a magic tool that interested him. It was a rare set of bow and arrow magic tools: a bow and ten arrows, all radiating golden light.

"A Golden Shot Bow. Both the bow and arrows are high-grade magic tools. A tenth-level Qi Condensation cultivator wielding it can shoot arrows a thousand zhang away without losing power. Exchange for Blazing Jade Marrow or over four hundred spirit stones!"

Upon hearing the Golden Shot Bow owner's introduction, Lu Xu's eyes lit up. This was precisely what he needed right now. He immediately stepped forward. A moment later, after spending four hundred spirit stones, Lu Xu obtained the set of magic tools. Afterward, he did not see anything else that interested him until the exchange ended.

After leaving the secret shop, Lu Xu immediately went to procure spiritual herbs and started refining Qi Gathering Pills. Qi Gathering Pills were rare on the market, partly because high-grade alchemists were uncommon, and partly because their main ingredient was difficult to find. It took Lu Xu a month to collect four sets of materials for refining Qi Gathering Pills. With his hundred percent success rate, these four sets of materials transformed into four bottles of Qi Gathering Pills.

He was just about to take these four bottles of elixirs to visit Mo Qingchan, when unexpectedly, Mo Qingchan herself came knocking on his door that day. She stood at the doorway, dressed as usual in a black dress, tall and slender. Her black hair was soft and smooth, and her fair skin appeared even fairer against the black dress. Light shimmered in her autumn-water-like bright eyes, and a faint smile graced her beautiful face. She parted her vermilion lips and spoke: "This humble sister's visit is presumptuous; I hope Fellow Daoist Han can forgive me!"

"Fairy Mo is a distinguished guest, please come in!"

While Lu Xu pondered the reason for Mo Qingchan's sudden visit, he led her into the courtyard. The two sat facing each other at a stone table, and Lu Xu spoke first: "Fairy Mo, is there something in particular for your sudden visit?"

"Indeed, there are some matters I wish to inquire about with Brother Han. Regarding Fellow Daoist Hu's previous proposal, how have you considered it? Qingchan came here to persuade Brother Han to join. We have already gathered eight tenth-level Qi Condensation Daoists, and more than twenty late-stage Qi Condensation Daoists have also joined. One could say we are well-equipped and powerful, absolutely capable of hunting second-tier demon beasts!" Mo Qingchan made no secret of her intentions, directly stating the purpose of her visit.

Lu Xu adopted a contemplative expression, and after a moment, said: "To be honest, this Han is very tempted by the demon hunting group you've formed. However, I am still somewhat hesitant about whether to join or not. Could I perhaps delay for a few more years?"

Mo Qingchan smiled faintly, "If Brother Han hasn't made up his mind, it's fine. However, Qingchan must remind Brother Han of one thing: the later you join this demon hunting group, the further back your turn for the Foundation Establishment Pill will likely be! In fact, even I, had I not contributed a set of first-tier high-grade formations, would probably have been pushed to the back," Mo Qingchan said with a wry smile. It seemed there were quite a few strong individuals among the newly joined members.

Lu Xu nodded, "This Han has already considered that point. Once I enter the tenth level of Qi Condensation, I will definitely give Fairy a reply!"

"Then Qingchan will look forward to it!" As Mo Qingchan spoke, a strange glint suddenly appeared in her eyes: "I remember Brother Han is also from Wei State, aren't you? Speaking of which, a genius like Brother Han, who is both a high-grade talisman master and possesses Foundation Establishment potential, Qingchan has never heard of before when I was in Wei State!"

Lu Xu chuckled, "Wei State has a hundred thousand cultivators. Fairy Mo wouldn't think she could know them all, would she?"

"You're right, Qingchan was presumptuous. I almost thought Brother Han was an old acquaintance Qingchan had met before!" A smile appeared on Mo Qingchan's fair and delicate face.

She recalled some information about Fellow Daoist Han Feiyu that she had gleaned from conversations with a few neighbors. The year this person entered Myriad Immortal City was precisely the year the Wei family and the Thousand Absolutes Sect began their great war. Furthermore, when this person first arrived, they were a seventh-level Qi Condensation cultivator and a high-grade talisman master, so they should have had a large number of talismans on hand. This naturally made Mo Qingchan think of the mysterious cultivator who had produced a large pile of talismans during her fierce battle with the Fourth Prince. Moreover, after inquiring with several neighbors, she learned that the Yi Fang Zhai managed by this Fellow Daoist Han could sell a large number of talismans and elixirs annually. From the shop's turnover, the Han family behind him must be a very powerful clan. However, Mo Qingchan had never heard of such a powerful Qi Condensation family anywhere in Wei State. Mid-grade talisman masters aside, mid-grade alchemists were not something ordinary Qi Condensation families could possess. The emergence of even one could elevate a family to the strongest rank below Foundation Establishment families. There were indeed quite a few Han Immortal Clans in Wei State, but none could achieve this level.

Mo Qingchan thought for a moment and knew that Fellow Daoist Han Feiyu in front of her was certainly not from any Han family; he was most likely using a false identity. However, she did not wish to needlessly offend a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, so she merely probed lightly, not intending to dig deeper.

Hearing Mo Qingchan's words, Lu Xu shook his head repeatedly, "I've heard of Fairy Qingchan before, but I don't believe I've ever met you. Fairy must have mistaken me for someone else."

"It seems Qingchan was indeed overthinking things then!"

As Mo Qingchan finished speaking, she was about to rise and bid farewell when Lu Xu suddenly said: "Speaking of which, during the Moonbone Secret Market exchange previously, a damaged spirit artifact appeared. Did Fairy know about it?"

"Oh, Qingchan also attended that exchange, so naturally, I know about it!" Mo Qingchan sat back down, a hint of surprise and doubt in her eyes. She wondered why this Fellow Daoist Han Feiyu suddenly brought this up. Could he have recognized her as the one who brought out the spirit artifact?

Lu Xu sighed, "At that time, this Han greatly wished to acquire that trump card, but unfortunately, I had no Qi Gathering Pills on me. Now that I have finally managed to purchase three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills, I don't know how to acquire that damaged spirit artifact!"

"It seems he knows through some method that it was me!" Mo Qingchan's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly. Lu Xu inexplicably bringing up this matter, and moreover, mentioning that he had gathered three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills, was clearly a hint that he wished to conduct a transaction with her. Mo Qingchan thought back carefully. After leaving the secret shop that day, she had circled around Myriad Immortal City many times, only returning to her home with peace of mind after confirming that she wasn't being followed.

Yet, her identity had still been seen through, which couldn't help but send a chill down her spine. "This Fellow Daoist Han is truly unfathomable!"

"That is indeed a pity. Brother Han, acquiring such a damaged spirit artifact, could it be that you intend to hunt demons alone?" Mo Qingchan probed.

"Not so. It's merely to have an extra layer of assurance. Speaking of which, from the appearance of that damaged spirit artifact, it strongly resembles a spirit artifact once used by the Mo family's old ancestor."

"Does Fairy Qingchan know anything about this?"

Hearing Lu Xu's words, Mo Qingchan smiled helplessly, "Brother Han, there's no need to probe further. I was indeed the one who presented the damaged spirit artifact that day!"

Lu Xu laughed heartily, "Then, Fairy Qingchan, do you still wish to sell that damaged spirit artifact? This Han can provide three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills!"

"Yes, the trade conditions are still valid!" As Mo Qingchan spoke, she took out the jade box from her storage pouch. At close proximity, Lu Xu could clearly sense waves of chill emanating from the jade box. Mo Qingchan opened the jade box, a wave of heat surged forth, revealing the broken, fiery-red jade ruler lying quietly within the box.

"Here are three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills!" Lu Xu produced three jade vials, and the two completed the trade. With this, Lu Xu gained another trump card. He mused to himself, "Activating the damaged spirit artifact should cause significant damage to a second-tier demon beast, and with the addition of Fire Thunder Orbs, my offensive power should be sufficient! But the key is still to trap the second-tier demon beast. I must have a second-tier formation!"

After receiving the three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills, Mo Qingchan immediately bade farewell and left. This was precisely what she urgently needed. With the aid of these elixirs, the time it would take for her to reach Great Perfection of Qi Condensation would be significantly shortened. In this way, her influence within that demon hunting alliance would increase. With more and more people joining, Mo Qingchan's position in that alliance had actually become precarious. Disputes about how to distribute the Foundation Establishment Pills after obtaining them had already arisen within the alliance. Hu Yan, with the backing of her father's influence, could currently firmly hold the first priority slot. However, Mo Qingchan's second priority slot was not as secure, with many voices seeking to replace her.

In fact, her eagerness to pull Lu Xu in was also to make them mutually reliant. After all, if her conjecture proved true, then Lu Xu was not a scion of a cultivation family at all; he was most likely a rogue cultivator. Lu Xu was alone, and Mo Qingchan was also alone. If the two formed an alliance, and both had the potential to establish Foundation, their influence within the demon hunting alliance would greatly increase.

Unfortunately, her hopes ultimately fell through. Lu Xu had his own plans and currently had no intention of joining the demon hunting group. "Many times, more people aren't necessarily better!" Lu Xu sighed inwardly, watching Mo Qingchan's departing figure. A small, elite team would have fewer disputes over loot distribution, but it would be difficult for them to hunt second-tier demon beasts. While a large, mixed team had a higher chance of successful hunting, it would be difficult to reach an agreement on loot distribution. In the past, many in Myriad Immortal City had tried to form large demon hunting groups, but successful ones were few and far between. The reason was that the more people there were, the harder it was to balance their interests.

Although Hu Jun had presented the Blood Spirit Ancient Scroll this time, guaranteeing that all who signed the contract would not renege afterward. However, disputes immediately arose regarding the content of the contract itself. Since there would be no regrets after signing, everyone tried their best to secure satisfactory terms before putting pen to paper. Over the past month, Lu Xu had conversed with Talisman Master Wang several times and knew that they still hadn't signed the Blood Spirit Contract. After discussion, they seemed to intend to sign the contract only after successfully hunting a second-tier demon beast.

"At that point, there might even be a fight. It's too difficult to make rogue cultivators unite!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

After trading with Mo Qingchan, Lu Xu continued his peaceful life, rarely going out except to manage his shop. However, his courtyard often received visitors. After all, Lu Xu was someone with the potential to establish Foundation, and not a few people wished to befriend him. Among these people, Talisman Master Wang and Mo Qingchan were the most frequent visitors. Talisman Master Wang and Lu Xu had known each other for many years, and their relationship was quite good. As for Mo Qingchan, she still seemed to have not given up on the idea of recruiting Lu Xu into the demon hunting group.

From them, Lu Xu learned much about this large demon hunting group. This alliance now boasted ten grand masters at the tenth level of Qi Condensation and over forty late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, possessing astonishingly formidable strength. In these two years, they had indeed successfully hunted two second-tier demon beasts. Unfortunately, neither of these two second-tier demon beasts contained a pseudo demon core. Moreover, hunting these two demon beasts had caused them heavy losses; the set of first-tier high-grade formations Mo Qingchan initially provided had already been destroyed. The middle-aged man at Hu Jun's birthday banquet, who initially, like Lu Xu, had not agreed to join, eventually did. But unfortunately, he died during a second-tier demon beast hunt. Furthermore, besides him, this demon hunting group had already lost three tenth-level Qi Condensation masters and eight late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators.

The reason their strength was so formidable now was that their successful hunts of second-tier demon beasts had spurred many others to join. However, most of these later joiners did not agree with the initial profit distribution plan, which made the demon hunting group increasingly chaotic. Faced with such a chaotic situation, even Talisman Master Wang felt like withdrawing. However, Lu Xu felt that the more chaotic the demon hunting group became and the harder it was to negotiate profits, the more opportunities there would be to fish in troubled waters. For a time, it made him somewhat want to join.

However, before he could make a decision, an event occurred that changed his mind. Myriad Immortal City's grand auction, held once every thirty years, was about to commence. Lu Xu spent quite a few spirit stones to learn some inside information about the auction in advance. During the climax of this auction, a second-tier high-grade formation would appear. At that time, the second-tier high-grade formation master who created this set of formations would personally come out to introduce it. This person was a treasure that safeguarded the Merchant Alliance, a renowned grand figure among the Nine Eastern Wilderness Nations. Now, finally having the opportunity to meet this person, Lu Xu's mood instantly grew excited.

"A second-tier high-grade formation master! With his experience, I can definitely hunt demons alone! I must prepare in advance!"

With an excited heart, Lu Xu took out all his spirit stones. By now, the spirit stones he had accumulated had reached over eight thousand two hundred. In these past two years, he had slowed his cultivation, spending most of his time on talisman crafting and elixir refining, finally accumulating such a fortune.

"The cost for second-tier low-grade experience has already reached thirty times the base rate. Second-tier high-grade will certainly be more expensive. This time, I must go all out!"

After careful consideration, Lu Xu finally steeled himself and recharged all eight thousand spirit stones into the Azure Stone Stele, converting them into eight thousand replication points. With this, the total number of replication points on the Azure Stone Stele reached 8241.

"It should be enough!"

A few days later, the time for the grand auction arrived. "Time to reveal my true appearance again!" Touching his face, Lu Xu removed his bronze mask. The grand auction would attract many Foundation Establishment cultivators, and any disguise would be useless under their divine sense. Lu Xu did not want to be noticed by Foundation Establishment grandmasters just because he had changed his appearance; that would not be a good thing.

The grand auction was still held at the Cloud True Auction House. A large hall, with a high platform in the center, surrounded by thousands of seats. Above the crowd, there were private boxes, which were VIP rooms accessible only to Foundation Establishment cultivators.

After Lu Xu arrived, he looked around and saw that not many people had arrived yet. He chose a corner seat and sat down. Lu Xu had only one attitude towards this auction: observe, but do not buy. He was specifically waiting for the second-tier formation master to appear.

Time gradually passed, and more and more people entered the auction hall, with the surrounding seats gradually filling up. The entrance of the auction hall constantly shimmered with light, indicating a formation that restricted entry to only late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. When approximately half of the seats were filled, a flash of light at the entrance announced the arrival of a stunning woman in a black dress. Her figure was graceful, slender, and tall, her black hair cascaded like a waterfall, and her fair, jade-like face radiated astonishing beauty. As she stepped forward, her gaze swept across the surroundings. When she saw Lu Xu in the corner, her expression suddenly froze, and a hint of surprise flashed in her eyes.

Lu Xu hadn't noticed this until a fragrant breeze wafted over, and a woman sat down beside him. "If I'm not mistaken, fellow Daoist's name should be Lu Xu, correct?" A clear and pleasant voice rang in his ear.

Lu Xu turned his head to look, and a stunning, immortal-like face appeared before him, her autumn-water-like bright eyes filled with various emotions such as surprise, confusion, and doubt.

Mo Qingchan!

"In the end, I still ran into an acquaintance!" Lu Xu sighed inwardly.

"Indeed. I didn't expect Fairy Mo to still remember me!" Lu Xu said, his expression unchanged.

"It's been many years. Brother Lu's cultivation has actually reached such a level, it's truly surprising!" Mo Qingchan said slowly.

"Merely a fortunate encounter; I'm no match for Fairy Mo!" Lu Xu's expression remained calm.

Mo Qingchan looked at him repeatedly. This person, who should have been her family's spirit farmer, had now appeared here with a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivation. This was truly an incredible matter. While surprised, Mo Qingchan also vaguely felt that the figure before her seemed to overlap with another figure. Various suspicions constantly welled up in her heart. Both were ninth-level Qi Condensation; could it be such a coincidence? Her heart was filled with countless doubts, and for a moment, she didn't know how to voice them.

A silent atmosphere enveloped the two. At this moment, more and more people entered the hall. Before long, the seats were almost fully occupied, with over a thousand late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators gathered here. As for how many Foundation Establishment cultivators had arrived in the VIP rooms above, those below had no way of knowing.

The auction hall doors closed, and a white-haired elder slowly walked onto the high platform. "Everyone, this old man is Cloud True Master. I have humbly taken the position of Elder in the Merchant Alliance, and today's auction will be presided over by me!"

The elder's powerful voice echoed through the venue, sparking waves of discussion.

"It's Senior Cloud True Master! This auction must be extraordinary!"

"They've even brought out a Foundation Establishment grandmaster like Senior Cloud True Master. Could there be some heaven-shaking item at this grand auction?"

"Could it be that a Foundation Establishment Pill will appear? Or perhaps something extremely beneficial to Foundation Establishment grandmasters will be presented?"

Amidst the waves of discussion, Cloud True Master smiled and pressed his hands downwards, and the crowd immediately quieted. "Before the auction begins, this old man has something to announce!" As Cloud True Master spoke, his eyes swept around the hall, his voice faintly tinged with excitement and fervor: "Our Merchant Alliance is preparing to launch a Demon Purging War, vowing to clear that ancient path!"
