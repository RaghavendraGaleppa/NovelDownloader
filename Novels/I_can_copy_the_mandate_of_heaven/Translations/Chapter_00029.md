Chapter 29: The Turned Face of Master Mo

Another year had passed, and Mo, the great physician, looked much older than before. When they first entered the valley, he appeared to be a middle-aged man, but now his hair was snow-white, and his face was full of wrinkles. It was as if something had caused him to age rapidly in just two years.

Despite his aged appearance, Master Mo still carried himself with the same air of dignity as before. Li Zhi Ming, on the other hand, was intimidated by him. Han Li, who had been standing beside Li Zhi Ming, was now respectful and silent, a stark contrast to his usual demeanor.

"Little Fourth," Master Mo said, looking at Li Zhi Ming, "follow me."

Without waiting for a response, Master Mo turned and walked away. Li Zhi Ming took a deep breath and followed, his head bowed. Han Li soon disappeared from view.

As they walked, Master Mo led the way, and Li Zhi Ming followed, his senses on high alert. They walked for almost half a day, leaving the medicinal valley far behind.

Finally, they reached a desolate, uninhabited area. Li Zhi Ming began to feel uneasy, realizing that he couldn't escape even if he tried to run. Master Mo continued to walk, his back to Li Zhi Ming, until they reached a familiar location - the stone chamber where Li Zhi Ming and Han Li had found Master Mo over a year ago.

Li Zhi Ming remained silent, following Master Mo to a small valley. At the entrance, Master Mo stopped and turned to face Li Zhi Ming.

"Little Fourth, you're a clever child," Master Mo said, his voice tinged with nostalgia. "I've known that since the day you arrived at the valley."

Li Zhi Ming kept his head bowed.

"You're a rare talent, but unfortunately, you're also..."

Master Mo's voice trailed off as he walked behind Li Zhi Ming. Li Zhi Ming felt a chill run down his spine as he sensed Master Mo's presence behind him.

"You have a clever mind, but when you grow older, you'll realize that it's not worth it," Master Mo continued. "Being reckless and self-assured can be a death sentence."

As Master Mo spoke, he placed a cold, clammy hand on Li Zhi Ming's shoulder. Li Zhi Ming felt a surge of fear and decided to take drastic action.

With a burst of strength, Li Zhi Ming turned around, kicking backward with his leg and throwing a poisonous powder at Master Mo. However, Master Mo was too quick, and with a flick of his sleeve, he deflected the powder.

Undeterred, Li Zhi Ming pulled out a sleeve arrow and fired it at Master Mo, but the latter dodged it with ease. Master Mo counterattacked, his hand shooting towards Li Zhi Ming's throat.

Li Zhi Ming was desperate, and he pulled out a handful of poisonous needles, firing them at Master Mo. Although some of the needles hit their mark, Master Mo managed to deflect most of them.

Enraged, Li Zhi Ming pulled out two poisonous daggers and charged at Master Mo, determined to take him down with him. Master Mo was taken aback by Li Zhi Ming's ferocity and was forced to retreat.

However, Li Zhi Ming's bravery was short-lived. Master Mo kicked Li Zhi Ming's wrists, causing him to drop the daggers, and then grabbed his neck, lifting him off the ground.

As Li Zhi Ming's face turned red, Master Mo sneered, but Li Zhi Ming suddenly bit down on a silver needle and spat it at Master Mo's face. The needle narrowly missed Master Mo's cheek.

Enraged, Master Mo punched Li Zhi Ming in the stomach, leaving him gasping for breath.
