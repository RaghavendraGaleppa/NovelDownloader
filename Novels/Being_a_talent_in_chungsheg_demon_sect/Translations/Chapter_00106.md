# Chapter 106: Make the Necromancer Sect Great Again!

After hearing Lu Yang's voice, Patriarch Ting You was momentarily plunged into deep self-doubt. A 367th-generation disciple of the Necromancer Sect?

"Presumptuous!" The next second, Patriarch Ting You erupted in fury. "My Necromancer Sect's foundation isn't deep. I am merely the sixth-generation sect master. How could there be a 367th-generation disciple?"

Facing Patriarch Ting You's interrogation, Lu Yang not only showed no panic but instead his eyes reddened, and two streams of hot tears rolled down as he choked out, "Grand-Ancestor, you are unaware that for the past thousand years, the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion has relentlessly pursued us, hunting us down everywhere. To this day, only my single lineage remains."

Major immortal sects and scattered cultivator inheritances are different. Any major immortal sect has at least a Foundation Establishment True Person overseeing it, ensuring stable and orderly transmission. Often, a few centuries pass with only a generation's difference. However, it's different for scattered cultivators. After all, scattered cultivators mostly wander, living day to day. If they also have a few enemies, their generations can change remarkably fast; dozens of generations is quite normal.

Thus, Patriarch Ting You quickly came to a realization. If a branch of the sect truly had been left outside, without a True Person to oversee it, and was being hunted by the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, then a thousand years of transmission across hundreds of generations wasn't impossible.

'Wait, no!'

Soon, Patriarch Ting You grew suspicious again. He was the last sect master of the Necromancer Sect; how could he not know if the sect had a branch lineage outside? Thinking of this, Patriarch Ting You suddenly spoke, "Which branch lineage do you belong to?"

(In reality, the Necromancer Sect had no concept of branch lineages. Patriarch Ting You said this solely to trick Lu Yang, clearly still not believing him in his heart.)

However, upon hearing this, Lu Yang replied fluently, "To answer Grand-Ancestor, the sect never had branch lineages. We are the lineage secretly sent outside the sect by the Grand Elder after you, Grand-Ancestor, achieved Foundation Establishment Consummation and clashed with that lord from the Sword Pavilion over a karmic position. He sought to sever the karma, and only then was this lineage passed down."

He had obtained the complete inheritance of the Necromancer Sect. In the divine sense imprint left by Patriarch Ting You, there was a deep nostalgia for the entire Necromancer Sect. Thus, Lu Yang knew no less about the sect than he did. For instance, the Grand Elder of the Necromancer Sect he spoke of. That Grand Elder had once contended with Patriarch Ting You for the sect master position, being both a friend and foe to him, and had consistently opposed Patriarch Ting You's decisions, including the idea of establishing the [Yama Temple]. So, Lu Yang used him to craft a flawless identity for himself, allowing him to easily handle any questions Patriarch Ting You might pose.

"It was him..." After hearing Lu Yang's explanation, Patriarch Ting You was momentarily stunned. Long-dead memories instantly flooded his mind, and he even fell into a reverie for a moment. When he regained his senses, his tone had softened considerably. "So that's how it is. I always thought that old fellow had deliberately opposed me because he never won against me and I took the sect leader position. Now it seems, he was more farsighted than I."

'No, he was actually just opposing you,' Lu Yang thought to himself, while actively changing the subject. "Without further ado, Grand-Ancestor, please wait a moment. I will find a way to rescue you immediately!"

"No, wait," Patriarch Ting You quickly waved his hand. "You don't need to worry about me; I have my own way out. Rather, you should leave quickly and don't get entangled with me!"

Patriarch Ting You had already believed Lu Yang's words by eighty percent. This wasn't because of Lu Yang's persuasive words, of course, but because after discreetly probing, he discovered that Lu Yang genuinely possessed the inheritance of the Necromancer Sect. If Lu Yang was a fraud, where would he have obtained these inheritances? It couldn't possibly have been from himself. Therefore, even though Patriarch Ting You found Lu Yang's identity somewhat fantastical, he still chose to believe him and regarded him as a disciple of the Necromancer Sect.

"No matter what, being able to pass down the inheritance is better than anything..." At this point, Patriarch Ting You suddenly spoke urgently, "There's still that Golden Core sword qi here. You must leave quickly, or you might be locked onto by it."

"Grand-Ancestor, you don't need to worry about that," Lu Yang said, shaking his head. He then revealed a hint of bitterness. "Actually, there's something I've been hiding from you, Grand-Ancestor, which may disappoint you."

"After the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion pursued us for a thousand years, with only my single lineage remaining, to protect myself, I dared not call myself a disciple of the Necromancer Sect. Instead, I had to hide my identity and join the Primeval Saint Sect, using their karma to conceal myself, which allowed me to grow and reach my current cultivation." Having said this, Lu Yang lowered his head, looking like someone who had done wrong and feared punishment from an elder.

"So that's how it is..." However, Patriarch Ting You showed no surprise upon hearing this. Instead, an expression of sudden understanding dawned on him, resolving a doubt he had about Lu Yang. After all, Lu Yang's cultivation was a bit too high. With Patriarch Ting You's discernment, he could naturally tell that Lu Yang was only a step away from Foundation Establishment and had even reassembled the [Yama Temple], which was incredibly powerful. But if the branch lineage had such a miserable existence, how could Lu Yang have reached this level? So, he joined the Primeval Saint Sect. That explained it.

"Actually, this is good too," Patriarch Ting You said, seeing Lu Yang's remorseful expression, and actively comforted him. "To preserve the sect's inheritance, compromising and enduring hardship is normal. Besides, the Primeval Saint Sect might not even care. Rather, you took the right step. I never thought my Necromancer Sect, after clinging to existence for a thousand years, could still take in such an outstanding disciple..." Thinking of this, Patriarch Ting You even looked at Lu Yang with a hint of sorrow. "This child, it hasn't been easy for him!" Patriarch Ting You sighed, "You've worked hard."

"For the Necromancer Sect, it's no hardship!" Lu Yang shook his head, wiped his eyes, and declared firmly, "To be honest, the reason this disciple came to Skeleton Mountain was originally to explore the sect's ruins. After all, I am now at Qi Condensation Consummation, just one last step from breaking through to Foundation Establishment. I plan to immediately reopen the Necromancer Sect's mountain gate after achieving Foundation Establishment. I only lack some resources and foundation, which is why I came to Skeleton Mountain, hoping to reclaim the former sect's residual foundation and make the Necromancer Sect great again." Having said this, Lu Yang looked expectantly at Patriarch Ting You.

Patriarch Ting You felt somewhat awkward under his gaze. He had the intention to provide some funds, but after a thousand years, any sect foundation would have long been used up by him. What could possibly be left?

Seeing his expression, Lu Yang's eyes instantly darted. With a thought, the [Yama Temple] emerged, and the Protector Spirit Su Nü stepped out from it. Su Nü then exchanged a knowing glance with Lu Yang.

"Master, isn't there still the earth vein?"

"What earth vein? What earth vein are you talking about!" As soon as these words left her lips, Lu Yang's face instantly hardened, and he reprimanded Su Nü angrily, "How could you say such a thing?"

On the other side, Patriarch Ting You had a sudden realization. "Right! There's still the earth vein!"

"Grand-Ancestor, you mustn't!" Lu Yang quickly waved his hand. "You are the sect master; only you can control the Skeleton Mountain earth vein. How could a junior like me borrow it?"

"No, I think your Protector Spirit makes sense," Patriarch Ting You shook his head. "Although I've lived out my fifth life through the method of soul-usurpation, I'm already nearing my limit. My soul has been severely worn down, and I don't have much lifespan left. I essentially have no use for the earth vein anymore. It's better if I give it to you; perhaps it will have a place to be utilized."

As his words fell, Lu Yang discovered that Patriarch Ting You truly took the initiative to relinquish control of the earth vein's location, allowing Su Nü to command the [Yama Temple] and take charge of it. He believed him, he really believed him!
