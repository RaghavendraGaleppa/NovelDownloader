# Chapter 35: Three Factions  

The clouds parted and the sun rose, its warm rays shining down as the next day arrived.  

After washing up in the morning, Lin Xuan used his waist token to dispel the restrictions and descended from the pavilion. Though it was still early, small groups of cultivators could already be seen everywhere. It seemed he wasn’t the only one who had arrived early for the treasure exchange.  

According to the information in the jade slip, there was a square in the southern part of the valley where cultivators could set up stalls.  

The surrounding area of several thousand miles had few cultivators and no proper marketplaces. Thus, the disbanding of the Lingyun Sect provided an opportunity not only to acquire their treasures but also for everyone to trade and exchange what they needed.  

The treasure exchange wouldn’t officially begin until the next day, so the stalls currently set up in the square belonged to visiting cultivators.  

After reviewing the details from the jade slip, Lin Xuan made his way toward the southern square with several goals in mind:  

First, he wanted to familiarize himself with the environment—memorizing the layout of the area would make it easier to escape if any unexpected trouble arose.  

Second, he needed to understand the market conditions. Though he had been cultivating for a while, this was his first time attending a gathering of cultivators outside his sect. He wasn’t yet confident about the value of various items, so he planned to browse around first to get a sense of prices. That way, when the treasure exchange began, he wouldn’t be cheated when purchasing mid-tier cultivation techniques.  

Otherwise, if something worth only a hundred spirit pills was being sold for two hundred, and he foolishly paid up due to ignorance, wouldn’t he just be an easy mark?  

Third, he wanted to broaden his horizons. Staying in his room was dull, and with such a rare gathering of cultivators, it was a perfect chance to see new things and join in the excitement.  

With these three goals in mind, Lin Xuan entered the marketplace. Upon reaching the square, he realized there were far more stalls than he had expected—vendors were scattered everywhere, their calls filling the air like a bustling mortal marketplace.  

"So many cultivators!" Lin Xuan estimated that there were at least two thousand people setting up stalls or browsing. It seemed the disbanding of the Lingyun Sect had truly drawn widespread attention. The scale suggested that cultivators from beyond Yanzhou had also come.  

Most were rogue cultivators, but various sects had also sent representatives. For instance, the Piaoyun Valley had dispatched two Foundation Establishment elders. While Piaoyun Valley was only a mid-to-lower-tier sect in the broader cultivation world, within Yanzhou, it was a major power. Two Foundation Establishment cultivators were enough to command respect and deter troublemakers.  

Apart from Piaoyun Valley, other sects from Chongzhou—such as the Fire Spirit Sect, Talisman Mountain Sect, and Heavenly Star Sect—had also sent elders.  

These sects formed the most powerful faction at the treasure exchange. Their targets were likely precious crafting materials and spirit artifacts—treasures that could significantly enhance their strength. Naturally, they wouldn’t allow such items to fall into others' hands easily. Fierce competition was inevitable.  

But this didn’t concern Lin Xuan. He already possessed three spirit artifacts, one of which was top-tier—more than enough for his needs. He had no intention of acquiring more, so his goals didn’t conflict with the major sects. He just needed to avoid being recognized by his own sect.  

Not that this was a real concern. He had never met the two elders before, and the accompanying elite disciples had joined the sect long before him. Even if he stood right in front of them, they wouldn’t recognize him.  

Next in strength were the cultivation families—small, bloodline-based groups that could be considered miniature sects. Their sizes varied, from over a hundred members to just three or five, with the patriarch serving as both clan head and leader.  

Though far weaker than the major sects, these families still held some influence. Their targets were the low-tier spirit artifacts and powerful talismans deemed unworthy by the sects, as well as cultivation techniques.  

This overlapped with Lin Xuan’s needs, potentially making them competitors. Frowning, he pondered how to handle this.  

Lastly, there were the rogue cultivators—the largest group but also the weakest and least influential. Most had no specific goals beyond observing the event or hoping to stumble upon something useful that the other factions overlooked.  

On the surface, the Lingyun Sect’s disbandment and asset sale appeared fair—everyone could acquire what they needed based on their means. But in reality, the cultivation world operated on strength and brute force. If a rogue cultivator happened to obtain something coveted by a major sect, they’d better watch out—bloodshed might follow.  

In essence, the major sects would pick first, taking the choicest treasures. The cultivation families would follow, settling for scraps. As for the rogue cultivators, lacking any backing, they could only scavenge for leftovers.  

That said, it wasn’t as if rogue cultivators gained nothing. At the very least, this was a rare spectacle in the cultivation world, offering a chance to broaden their horizons. Additionally, before the official exchange, they could set up stalls to trade among themselves for items the sects and families wouldn’t bother with.  

Surveying the dense crowd of cultivators, Lin Xuan analyzed the situation. This was the conclusion he had drawn from the intelligence he’d gathered beforehand. The only thing he hadn’t anticipated was the sheer scale—the exchange hadn’t even begun, yet so many had already gathered.
