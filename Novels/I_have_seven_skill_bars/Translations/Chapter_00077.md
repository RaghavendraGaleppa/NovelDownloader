# Chapter 77: Speaking of Ding Rui

"The fees, I'll still pay myself..." Ding Rui wanted to be polite, though he knew it was useless. As expected, before he could finish speaking, Jiang She said, "No need for more, Junior Brother. This matter is settled!"

Ding Rui's journey of overtime was about to begin again. Unlike before, this time he was working overtime under orders and would receive some rewards. Of course, having a disciple from the Pill Hall teach him alchemy couldn't be considered a great reward, and Ding Rui didn't ask for anything more. Although he hadn't extensively studied emotional intelligence before transmigrating, he still understood that the biggest benefit of this matter was being discovered by Jiang She, demonstrating his value and talent, making himself known, and incidentally gaining some connections.

As for rewards, Ding Rui truly wasn't very concerned. Because he didn't have anything urgently lacking right now. For human cultivators within the Sect Domain, all the most basic necessities were guaranteed. For instance, cultivation techniques, cultivation resources, as well as knowledge of formations, alchemy, and artifact refining... and so on. As long as one reached a certain realm, they could obtain them for free, learn at will, and receive ample guidance. There was absolutely no need to find ways to buy or exchange for them. Only in this way could the Sect Domain grow stronger at the fastest pace. These were cultivators who banded together for warmth, and similarly, because of the dangers lurking outside the domain and the harmony and safety within, no cultivator would willingly leave this group. Even Yang Shou, who had previously practiced evil cultivation methods, had obediently stayed within the Sect Domain before being discovered.

And as Ding Rui successfully comprehended the [Double Pit] skill, his reputation reached a peak! Each time, he could simultaneously loosen the soil for two Vein-Flowering Plants, making his efficiency several times that of other cultivators, even other spirit farmers. One person participated in loosening the soil for a full ten spirit fields! Such a Ding Rui had practically become the "King of Farming" in the hearts of the Spirit Field cultivators of Xuanfu Sect. These empty titles, in Ding Rui's eyes, were still quite exciting.

And just after Ding Rui comprehended the [Double Pit] skill, doubling his ability to handle the rapid growth phase of the Vein-Flowering Plants, Jiang She was once again astonished! When he personally watched Ding Rui cast [Double Pit], single-handedly loosening the soil for two Vein-Flowering Plants simultaneously, even he, an inner disciple, couldn't help but marvel. It was truly astounding!

As an inner disciple, Jiang She had lived longer, seen more, and understood many things better. The planting talent Ding Rui displayed was completely beyond ordinary description. "Junior Brother Ding Rui's talent can truly be called that of a genuine genius. With Junior Brother Ding Rui's talent in planting, even if he were to remain in the Qi Condensation stage his entire life, he would still be valued by the Sect. It's just that the Sect Domain is currently in a time of crisis; once this period passes, Junior Brother Ding Rui is bound to receive attention from the Sect Elders!"

Only Foundation Establishment cultivators could become outer disciples, and only Sea Condensation cultivators could be promoted to inner disciples. This was precisely why. Because talent was something too ethereal, completely unpredictable, with no specific way to measure it. Perhaps some cultivators had very fast cultivation speeds in the Qi Condensation stage, but once they reached the Foundation Establishment stage, their speed might slow down, even astonishingly so. While some cultivators had extremely fast cultivation speeds in the Foundation Establishment stage, yet slowed down again upon reaching the Sea Condensation stage. This was because the cultivation methods for these realms had significant differences; otherwise, there would be no need for such detailed divisions. For this very reason, talent simply couldn't be definitively judged. Yet now, inner disciple Jiang She had personally stated that Ding Rui might break this rule, earning the Sect's strong regard based solely on his talent. This was truly astonishing.
