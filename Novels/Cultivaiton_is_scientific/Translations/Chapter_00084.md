# Chapter 84 Conclusion  

"Today marks the end of the probationary period. Congratulations to the thirty-two junior brothers who have successfully condensed their spiritual energy vortexes—you are now probationary disciples of the sect. The Eight Peaks will soon arrive to select candidates. If chosen, you may still refuse.  

Apart from joining the Eight Peaks, if you possess a secondary profession, you may apply to rent a cave dwelling within the sect's maritime territory.  

Aside from the mandatory annual tasks, completing other assignments will be your primary means of earning merit points. If you wish to grow stronger, take on more tasks!" Zhu Ji said sternly, addressing the thirty-two Qi Refinement disciples standing before him.  

He paid no attention to the remaining eighty-plus individuals—they would become menial disciples.  

Menial disciples could at least remain within the sect. With the spiritual energy-rich environment, they might slowly grind their way to the first level of Qi Refinement through sheer persistence, but their future prospects were virtually nonexistent.  

Li Shiming had previously inquired with Zhu Ji about the Eight Peaks. Each peak specialized in different disciplines. Joining one meant completing daily assigned tasks, with only the remaining time available for personal cultivation.  

The benefits across the Eight Peaks were similar—each offered monthly lectures, sometimes delivered by late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators and occasionally even by Foundation Establishment elders.  

Additionally, the Eight Peaks provided opportunities to learn secondary professions. While fulfilling peak-specific tasks, disciples would be exposed to related professions. Those with talent might even master one.  

For newcomers without any background, this was highly advantageous, which was why most chose to join one of the Eight Peaks.  

However, Li Shiming had his own plans. He needed ample time and space to pursue his own affairs.  

He had no need to learn a secondary profession—he had already mastered two: Spirit Farmer and Talisman Master. Though both were at a basic level, they were sufficient for the early and middle stages of Qi Refinement.  

Zhu Ji said nothing more, and the newcomers below dared not move.  

They waited for nearly an hour before cultivators finally arrived.  

Zhu Ji glanced at the newcomers and sighed inwardly.  

The Eight Peaks were named after the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams. The first to arrive was a low-ranking steward from Qian Peak, indicating their lack of interest in this batch of newcomers.  

Soon, representatives from the other peaks arrived—all low-ranking stewards, not even a single managing deacon among them.  

In the sect, low-ranking stewards were late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators with no hope of advancement. They served the sect in exchange for resources.  

Some did so for their descendants or clans, while others, having no remaining family, treated the sect as their only home until their eventual demise.  

With proper care, a Qi Refinement cultivator could live up to a hundred and fifty years—an age by which two generations of mortals would have already passed away.  

---  

All the new Qi Refinement disciples crowded around the eight stewards, hoping to be chosen first.  

Li Shiming, however, approached Zhu Ji. The latter glanced at him but showed no surprise.  

Li Shiming was acquainted with Elder Cui, who might have already arranged something for him.  

"Senior Brother, I’d like to take the Primary Spirit Farmer examination first before deciding my next steps," Li Shiming said.  

"You’re well-prepared. Very well, I’ll take you there once this is over," Zhu Ji replied with a smile.  

His duty of guiding newcomers would conclude after this handover, but he saw potential in Li Shiming and wanted to foster goodwill. A small favor cost him little—why not?  

The stewards from the Eight Peaks remained indifferent. They had no reason to be picky—these disciples would simply replenish their lower ranks.  

As for Li Shiming, who had already reached the third level of Qi Refinement before the probationary period, they didn’t even know of his existence.  

Even if they had, a triple-spiritual-root disciple was nothing special—the Eight Peaks had plenty. He wasn’t worth an active recruitment.  

The Qi Refinement disciples were divided among the Eight Peaks, while those who hadn’t reached the first level were taken away by the menial stewards.  

The fates of the two groups diverged from this moment—some were joyful, some sorrowful, some resigned, and some numb.

Li Shiming followed Zhu Ji on a paper crane, heading toward Xun Peak, which specialized in spirit farming.  

The crane landed before a verdant pavilion named Thunder Rain Pavilion. Li Shiming sensed the vitality permeating the surrounding spiritual energy—a sensation he usually only felt after casting *Spring Breeze and Rain Art*.  

If spirit rice were planted here, it might not even require the art—just a spirit field would suffice for normal growth.  

Of course, he didn’t know that every spirit field on Xun Peak was at least mid-grade. Such fields would never be wasted on something as common as spirit rice.  

"Greetings, Elder Cheng!" Zhu Ji bowed to an elderly cultivator inside the pavilion.  

Li Shiming hurriedly followed suit. To his surprise, the elder was a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"What brings you here?" Elder Cheng glanced at them.  

"This disciple wishes to take the Primary Spirit Farmer examination," Li Shiming replied, still bowing.  

"Demonstrate the foundational spirit farming arts," Elder Cheng said without preamble.  

Li Shiming channeled his spiritual energy, sketching a rune in the air. Instantly, dark clouds gathered, forming a rain cloud covering nearly a hundred square meters within the hall.  

Before the rain could fall, Elder Cheng waved his hand, dispersing the cloud.  

"Your *Spring Breeze and Rain Art* isn’t the sect’s orthodox version, but its essence is no lesser. Your mastery is proficient—well done," Elder Cheng remarked with mild interest.  

Li Shiming had used *Spring Breeze and Rain Art* extensively. In his machine room space, seventy square meters of spirit rice, spirit tea plants, and talisman bamboo required daily irrigation.  

"Elder Cheng’s insight is impeccable. Junior Brother Li learned his spirit farming skills outside the sect," Zhu Ji flattered.  

"Anything else?" Elder Cheng ignored Zhu Ji, addressing Li Shiming directly.  

Li Shiming then demonstrated *Metal Severing Art* and *Earth Spirit Art*. Due to his practice in crafting *Primary Metal Severing Talismans*, his *Metal Severing Art* was fairly polished, but his *Earth Spirit Art* was noticeably slower.  

"Hand me your identity jade slip. You’ve passed the Primary Spirit Farmer examination," Elder Cheng declared.  

Li Shiming presented his jade slip. Without touching it, Elder Cheng cast a spell onto it.  

A small tree emblem now adorned the slip—the mark of a Primary Spirit Farmer.  

"Go. Primary Spirit Farmer is merely the beginning. I hope the next time we meet, it will be for your Intermediate Spirit Farmer examination," Elder Cheng said, waving them off.
