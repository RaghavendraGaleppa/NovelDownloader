# Chapter 148: Golden Core Alliance, Intimidating Blackwater

Three years passed swiftly since Zhou Qing began cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light.

Within the embrace of his Taiyi Primordial Chaos Divine Light, two intertwined yet utterly distinct black and white energies circulated. These were the very Yin-Yang energies he had painstakingly cultivated. They were extracted from his disciple Yuan Mingyue’s Profound Nether Qi and Mao Ri’s lifeblood essence, respectively. When Zhou Qing purified these Yin-Yang energies, they were initially extremely unstable. Fortunately, he had cultivated the Taiyi Primordial Chaos Divine Light, which miraculously managed to envelop and stabilize them.

With the Taiyi Primordial Chaos Divine Light on the outside and the Yin-Yang energies within, it was as if a grand elixir was being nurtured. Moreover, the Taiyi Primordial Chaos Divine Light, based on the Five Elements, could nourish and feed the Yin-Yang energies with its Five-Element essence. When Zhou Qing’s spiritual consciousness entered the Yin-Yang energies to harmonise them into the Yin-Yang Divine Light, his consciousness was also tempered. Over these three years, his spiritual consciousness gradually reached the peak of the mid-Golden Core stage.

Concurrently, through various insights and the assistance of the Yang Sheng Zhu, a Golden Core-level Spirit Refinement Art began to take shape. He observed the Yang Sheng Zhu:

Yin-Yang Divine Light (embryonic form).
Yin-Yang God Refinement Art (beginner).

The Yin-Yang God Refinement Art refines and nourishes spiritual consciousness using Yin-Yang energies. Once the Yin-Yang Divine Light achieves minor completion, it can also temper the physical body and refine spiritual power. The simultaneous advancement of Essence, Qi, and Spirit would naturally propel Zhou Qing faster towards Golden Core Second Revolution.

Currently, the Yin-Yang Divine Light was merely in its embryonic form, making it impossible for Zhou Qing to manipulate it freely or convert between its aspects. However, it could be unleashed as a fatal strike, and its power was certainly not to be underestimated. The Yin-Yang Divine Light was especially effective at nullifying cultivators' spells and artifact defenses. Cultivated to perfection, it was said to be able to break all techniques within the same realm, and even allow one to kill enemies across major realms. Once Zhou Qing cultivated to Golden Core Third Revolution and perfected the Yin-Yang Divine Light, he could confidently declare himself unrivaled below the Nascent Soul realm, and capable of trading blow for blow with early Nascent Soul cultivators!

In these three years, during the rainy seasons, the Qing Huang Sword absorbed a considerable amount of lightning essence. Now, the Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light within the Qing Huang Sword was fully charged, and the excess had even been used by Zhou Qing to create ten talismans. To create Golden Core-level Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light Talismans, he needed the hide of a Golden Core-level great demon as the talisman paper. Fortunately, he had resources from Tianxuan City; otherwise, he would have had to hunt a Golden Core great demon himself. Even if he used his Thousand Illusions Transformation identity to easily leave the vicinity of Tianxuan City, there was still a risk of attracting encirclement from other great demons if he were to engage in combat.

"The next step in cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light involves the conversion of Yin-Yang energies, which is a gradual process requiring much effort. After conversion, the primary goal is to enhance control over the Yin-Yang Divine Light. My method of cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light by using Yuan Mingyue’s Profound Nether Qi and consuming Mao Ri’s essence blood is a clever shortcut, and the results are better than Old Ancestor Tianxuan's. As for whether it can reach full completion, that depends on whether Mingyue can advance to the Golden Core realm."

Over these three years, with Zhou Qing's blood essence and Yang Qi constantly supplied, he was able to exchange for Profound Nether Qi from Yuan Mingyue. However, Yuan Mingyue possesses the Nine Nether Extreme Meridian, meaning her Profound Nether Qi cannot be fundamentally eradicated. Zhou Qing’s blood essence and Yang Qi merely treated the symptoms, not the root cause. Yet, with Zhou Qing's blood essence and Yang Qi flowing into her, Yuan Mingyue's body received nourishment and tempering. As her physical body improved, even her spirit soul received a certain degree of nourishment. Yuan Mingyue inherently possessed outstanding spiritual soul talent, and now, imperceptibly, her spiritual consciousness had reached the late Foundation Establishment stage. Her cultivation base had also reached the peak of the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.

However, the hope of reaching Golden Core remained incredibly slim. Even with the assistance of the Jade Liquid Reversion Pill, she still needed other fortuitous opportunities. Zhou Qing only needed to open the Divine Water Palace once more and trade with the Blood Demon Sect for Blood Dragon Ganoderma. Then he could refine another batch of Jade Liquid Reversion Pills. Furthermore, since the Great Mulberry Tree had advanced to a "Heaven and Earth Spirit Root," the spiritual dew's effect was much better than during the last alchemy session. This time, the quality of the Jade Liquid Reversion Pills would certainly be higher.

"Mingyue, cultivating with pills and spiritual rice has both advantages and disadvantages. The spiritual energy contained in pills and spiritual rice is relatively gentle and easy to convert, but this means the tempering of the body is insufficient. The Golden Core step requires a solid physical foundation. Fortunately, over these past few years, with my blood essence and Yang Qi nourishing you, your physical body has been tempered to a certain extent. For now, you should temporarily stop taking pills and focus on cultivating the body refinement techniques of the Crane's Cry Nine Heavens Scripture to first stabilize and enhance your physical body." Zhou Qing carefully instructed his disciple. Over the three years, he frequently practiced with his disciple, which significantly deepened their relationship.

For the next year or so, Zhou Qing continued to stabilize the Yin-Yang energies, increasing their power. However, the step of Yin-Yang conversion proved much more difficult. Nevertheless, progress was steadily being made. Besides cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light, Zhou Qing also strengthened himself in other areas. All his various divine abilities and spells advanced to the Golden Core level. This was related to his profound foundation and powerful spiritual consciousness. A divine ability or spell that might take Golden Light five years to master, Zhou Qing could complete in half a year to a year. Moreover, he possessed a Five-Element True Body, allowing him to cultivate the vast majority of divine abilities and spells in the world without any hindrance.

Currently, apart from advancing to Golden Core Second Revolution, Zhou Qing’s main cultivation challenges were the creation of the Yin-Yang Divine Light, One Yuan Heavy Water, and Sleeve Dimension, as well as obtaining a Spirit Cultivation Legacy to master even more potent spiritual consciousness attack abilities. Spiritual consciousness attacks didn't necessarily need to have powerful killing intent; as long as they could affect the enemy, they could create opportunities for Zhou Qing. Generally, Golden Core level existences have perfected their divine abilities and spells, making it difficult to find flaws even with a Truth-Shattering Dharma Eye.

However, spiritual consciousness attacks could indeed create openings.

"After these past few years, Daoist Zhang's True Body realm should be stable. The Blackwater Sect has been making too many small moves, and I need to open the Divine Water Palace as soon as possible. This matter is crucial for refining the Longevity Immortal Pill, and I cannot allow Meng Xuan to continue feigning compliance." Old Ancestor Tianxuan, after entering the Spirit Sealing Pagoda for slumber, could theoretically last for a hundred years. However, upon emerging from the Pagoda, he would quickly exhaust his lifespan and die within a short period. The Longevity Immortal Pill was key to Old Ancestor Tianxuan's continued life. From ancient pill formulas, the Longevity Immortal Pill was extremely difficult to refine and required a very long time—forty-nine years. Even if Zhou Qing and Fushan later compressed the time and reduced the effect to only extend the lifespan of Golden Core cultivators, it would still take twenty to thirty years. Therefore, preparing the materials for the Longevity Immortal Pill was better done sooner rather than later.

He pondered for a long time, then decided to invite the Four Great Demonic Sect Masters to a meeting under the name of Jinguang. He would first display his strength to intimidate the Blackwater Demonic Sect. Since Old Ancestor Tianxuan entered the Spirit Sealing Pagoda, Tianxuan City and the Three Great Demonic Sects had largely been acting independently. The Blood Demon Sect was quite cooperative, but Qin Fang was very strong, and the Blood Demon Sect often seemed not to care much about the feelings of Tianxuan City or Luopo Ridge. Zhou Qing intended to further strengthen the alliance between Luopo Ridge, Tianxuan City, and the Blood Demon Sect after this meeting. His own powerful strength was the foundation for the three parties' cooperation.

Zhou Qing quickly notified Jinguang, asking him to invite the Four Great Demonic Sect Masters to Tianxuan City for a Golden Core-level meeting. This news somewhat surprised Jinguang. Currently, among the orthodox human cultivators, only he and Zhou Qing were Golden Core level existences. As for Luopo Ridge, there were rumors that Xiao Jing (Zhang Jingxiu’s alias in the Jingyang Dao Domain) had advanced to the True Body realm, but Jinguang had not witnessed it personally. Even if it were true, with three of them at the early Golden Core stage, and even if Zhou Qing possessed the strength to contend with mid-Golden Core cultivators, they would absolutely be suppressed in terms of aura when facing the Four Great Demonic Sect Masters. Ultimately, the alliance between the Blood Demon Sect's Qin Fang and them was not solid enough. Recently, Meng Xuan of the Blackwater Sect had been making many small moves. The Killing Life Sect and Blazing Sun Demonic Sect among the Four Great Demonic Sects had temporarily formed an alliance with the Blackwater Sect. Feeling the pressure, the Blood Demon Sect's attitude towards Tianxuan City and Luopo Ridge had become noticeably colder recently. Although Jinguang was worried, he still heeded Zhou Qing's words. He began sending out invitations, asking the Four Great Demonic Sect Masters to Tianxuan City for the Golden Core Alliance meeting.

...

...

Tianxuan City, Tianxuan Hall.

Jinguang did not make this meeting of all Golden Core level existences of the human race too grand, as it was merely a brief gathering. Moreover, it would be quite embarrassing if he and Zhou Qing were to lose face.

Jinguang waited quietly in the hall. At first, he only saw a murky blood light, like a surging long river, approaching and settling within Tianxuan Hall. The blood light dispersed, revealing a middle-aged scholar, none other than Qin Fang, the Sect Master of the Blood Demon Sect. Jinguang naturally stepped forward to greet him. Qin Fang arriving first truly gave Zhou Qing and Jinguang significant respect. The two exchanged pleasantries for a while.

Soon after, surging black water, like a black dragon, descended into the main hall. As the water light dispersed, it revealed Meng Xuan, the Sect Master of the Blackwater Sect. He glanced at the people in the hall, then said, "Daoist Jinguang, why hasn't Daoist Qinglingzi arrived yet? Is this how you treat guests?" He had been mediating and maneuvering for Zhou Qing's sake, but Zhou Qing had yet to make a clear stance, leaving Meng Xuan exhausted. Many of his schemes couldn't be carried out. This time, attending the Golden Core Alliance meeting, he intended for the three great demonic sects to jointly pressure Zhou Qing into taking a stand, and even to further gain the demonic sects' influence in Tianxuan City. However, Zhou Qing had originally said he would enter seclusion for fifteen years, yet it had been less than five, and Jinguang was orchestrating this Golden Core Alliance meeting, which somewhat puzzled Meng Xuan. But no matter what tricks Zhou Qing might pull, with the three great demonic sects applying pressure this time, Qin Fang wouldn't dare to act rashly again. He also intended to take this opportunity to teach Qin Fang a lesson.

Jinguang, naturally not daring to offend Meng Xuan, bowed and said, "Sect Master Meng, perhaps Daoist Qinglingzi was delayed by something." Just then, a streak of fiery light soared from the sky, entering the main hall simultaneously with a searing white energy. They were Chiyang, the Sect Master of the Blazing Sun Demonic Sect, and Daoist Killing Life, the Sect Leader of the Killing Life Sect. Chiyang, with his fiery temper, snapped, "Qinglingzi is just a junior, what important business could he possibly have that outweighs us seniors? Are his affairs more important than ours?" His words expressed great dissatisfaction. Jinguang knew he was in the wrong and apologized. Meng Xuan also chimed in with sarcastic remarks from the side. Daoist Killing Life, though taciturn, also emanated a palpable killing intent, clearly indicating his displeasure. Jinguang, after a long time, broke out in a cold sweat, thinking, "I wonder how this will end today." He simply couldn't understand why Zhou Qing would be late.

As Jinguang's cold sweat emerged while he dealt with Chiyang and Meng Xuan, suddenly, outside, the sounds of wind and thunder roared loudly, growing from afar to near, echoing incessantly through the void. They stirred countless natural spiritual energies. The expressions of everyone in the hall changed. It wasn't that the aura of the newcomers was world-shaking and caused them fear. Rather, it was four distinct Golden Core auras, spanning across the sky, long and continuous. Among them, the Qing Huang Sword led the way, with the Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light flickering in and out of sight, causing a sense of dread to arise in the hearts of the four demonic sect masters. This was because the Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light was simply too effective against demonic cultivation.

But as the four Golden Core auras approached, another terrifying flame burst forth at the hall entrance. The great sun blazed, melting everything. The pure and refined Great Sun Divine Flame enveloped Mao Ri, subtly carrying an aura of sanctity and nobility. Although Mao Ri's aura was only at the early Golden Core stage, the Great Sun Divine Flame's restraint on demonic cultivation was no less potent than the Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder. The four demonic sect masters naturally grew even more wary.

Qin Fang of the Blood Demon Sect was first startled, then his face broke into a wide smile. Two Daoists stepped into the hall. One was a young Daoist, his robes fluttering, appearing like an immortal, his demeanor captivating. Beside him was a body cultivator who had achieved True Body, radiating磅礴 (pángbó - vast and mighty) blood qi, walking half a step behind as an attendant. Even more alarming to Meng Xuan and the others was that they had clearly sensed four Golden Core-level auras approaching, yet at this moment, they only saw Mao Ri, Zhang Jingxiu, and Zhou Qing. The fourth mysterious Golden Core-level aura, upon reaching outside the hall, had inexplicably vanished without a trace. And due to the intense spiritual fluctuations from the Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light just now, they had instinctively not dared to release their spiritual consciousness to probe.

Zhou Qing moved as if performing Daoist ritualistic steps, his aura mysterious and unfathomable. Furthermore, Zhou Qing not only used the Thousand Illusions technique, but his spiritual consciousness was also no less than Meng Xuan's. They simply couldn't see through Zhou Qing at all. Qin Fang was the first to greet him. "Greetings, Daoist Qin," Zhou Qing first addressed Qin Fang, who returned a solemn bow. He had long been dissatisfied with the three great demonic sects' joint pressure, and seeing Zhou Qing's demeanor and his singular politeness towards him, he knew exactly how to seize the opportunity. His aura naturally exuded, yet it did not overshadow Zhou Qing's presence, only serving as a backdrop. On the other side, Jinguang also hurried to greet him.

For a moment, Zhou Qing's side had six Golden Core-level existences in total, and the sixth Golden Core existence, Meng Xuan and the other two couldn't even sense, which was the most terrifying part. Zhou Qing then calmly and gracefully saluted Meng Xuan, Chiyang, and Daoist Killing Life, "Greetings, three Daoists." For a moment, the three instinctively returned the bow. Then, the three demonic giants, who had been in the mid-Golden Core stage for many years, suddenly felt like mortals who had stumbled into a tiger's den. Merely Qin Fang alone was no longer inferior to any of the three. Zhou Qing, who had been able to withstand Bai Yue's Heavenly Wolf Dharma Idol strike back then, and whose flying sword also bore the aura of Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light, which countered demonic cultivation, left Meng Xuan and the others admitting they had no confidence in defeating Zhou Qing. Moreover, Zhou Qing's side had four other Golden Core-level existences, even if all were early Golden Core, none of them could be defeated by any one of Meng Xuan's trio alone. Demonic alliances were notoriously fragile.

Daoist Killing Life, decisive in combat, made a quick decision and immediately moved one step away from Meng Xuan. Chiyang, seeing Daoist Killing Life's action, also retreated half a step. Demonic cultivators were always like this, fickle and revering only strength. How could they possibly risk their lives for Meng Xuan's sake?

The main doors of Tianxuan Hall closed with a resounding boom, and the melodious sound of the Daoist Bell that Fusong had purchased from Crane Immortal Elder previously rang out. When the bell stopped, Zhou Qing smiled faintly, "Fellow Daoists, please take your seats." Meng Xuan's face fluctuated between green and pale, but he still found a cushion and sat down. However, no one, not even the powerful Daoist Killing Life, took the main seat in the hall. Everyone instinctively left it for Zhou Qing. When under someone else's roof, how could one not bow their head? Moreover, if demonic cultivators cared too much about integrity, they wouldn't have been able to cultivate to the Golden Core stage.

Zhou Qing took the main seat. He was like an alchemy cauldron, exuding a sense of stabilizing the heavens and earth, an aura of grandeur and dominance naturally emanating from him. This was also the Golden Core Grand Dao that Zhou Qing cultivated, which exerted a natural suppression over ordinary Golden Core cultivators. "I am of the Orthodox Dao; you are all of the Left Path and Side Gate!" Meng Xuan and the others, in a daze, felt as if they had seen another Old Ancestor Tianxuan. But he had only reached the Golden Core stage for less than twenty years; how was this possible? Zhou Qing became even more mysterious in their minds. Apart from Meng Xuan, Chiyang and Daoist Killing Life's eyes became complex, filled with both surprise and a hint of joy. Ultimately, the emergence of another Old Ancestor Tianxuan for the human race was also very beneficial to them, the demonic cultivators. Otherwise, if the mortal foundation of Tianxuan City were to collapse, the demonic cultivators would also be rootless drifters.

Zhou Qing waited for their agitated thoughts to settle before his gaze slowly landed on Meng Xuan. "Today, I've invited all fellow Daoists to this alliance. The first important matter is that I wish to borrow your Blackwater Divine Stele fragment, Daoist Meng. I wonder if that would be possible?" Zhou Qing's tone was calm, but Meng Xuan felt as if a heavy hammer had struck his heart. Borrow? Or not borrow? To bow his head or not? Qinglingzi was just a junior who rose later! How could he just completely give up the secret of the Divine Water Palace? The Qing Huang Sword floated before Zhou Qing, threads of Divine Firmament Heavenly Thunder Divine Light subtly escaping, like a heavenly river about to descend.
