# Chapter 110: You Yuanming's Breakthrough

As if suddenly realizing something, Zhang Jing hurriedly took out the top-grade magic treasure embryo he had obtained just days before.

A trace of heavy, majestic aura slowly emanated from the Mountain-Shaking Treasure Seal, instantly filling the entire cave.

"A top-grade magic treasure embryo!"

Zhang Jing couldn't help but reveal a look of joy on his face. The aura radiating from this Mountain-Shaking Treasure Seal was countless times stronger than his only other magic treasure embryo, the Frostwind White Banner.

If he could integrate this into his Five Treasures Spirit River...

Zhang Jing took a deep breath and slowly extended his spiritual sense into the Mountain-Shaking Treasure Seal, attempting to refine it.

Time passed slowly.

From noon to night, then from night to morning—refining the Mountain-Shaking Treasure Seal proved incomparably more difficult than refining the Frostwind White Banner had been.

During this time, Senior Brother Liu came to invite Zhang Jing to hunt spirit demons together. However, upon learning that Zhang Jing was refining a magic treasure embryo, he didn't press further, merely informing Zhang Jing about the hunting grounds he and Yang Bai had planned to explore.

Three days slipped by unnoticed.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes, exhaustion evident in his gaze. Yet beneath that weariness lay an irrepressible excitement.

Without pausing to rest—

Whoosh—

The Five Treasures Spirit River gradually materialized. Drawing from his previous experience, Zhang Jing first removed all his magical instruments before carefully placing the newly refined Mountain-Shaking Treasure Seal into the river.

In an instant, the aura of the Five Treasures Spirit River began to surge wildly!

Before he knew it, another month had passed.

In the Tenth Virtual Heaven, at the Stairway to Heaven:

A flash of light appeared, revealing a figure clad in purple robes with ordinary features.

"Eight full months... but I've finally succeeded. What incredible fortune," murmured You Yuanming.

For someone of his status, he couldn't help but laugh aloud at this moment.

Golden Array Rune Foundation!

To be honest, he hadn't been particularly confident about transforming his Azure-Gold Foundation into a Golden Foundation. Yet against all odds, he had succeeded.

As his expression gradually returned to calm, You Yuanming looked up toward the sky.

"It's time to see what the Eleventh Virtual Heaven looks like," he thought.

In the next instant, his figure transformed into a streak of light shooting straight upward.

Eighty-third step of the Stairway!

Eighty-eighth step!

Ninety-second step!

At this moment—

The previously quiet Spiritual Merit Ranking began flashing wildly.

Finally:

[1st: You Yuanming (92nd Step · Late Foundation Establishment · Dragon Lake Academy)]
[2nd: Qiu Han (84th Step · Late Foundation Establishment · Divine Thunder Academy)]

You Yuanming, originally in second place, had suddenly surged to first—and by a considerable margin.

In the deepest layer of the Myriad Gods' Miniature Heaven:

"Oh? Someone actually managed to evolve their foundation into a Golden one?" A surprised voice suddenly rang out.

Immediately afterward, space itself began to tremble.

Dozens of gazes—some curious, others astonished—appeared within this layer of the Myriad Gods' Miniature Heaven, all focusing on You Yuanming in the Eleventh Virtual Heaven.

The place instantly became lively.

"Not bad at all! A Golden Array Rune Foundation indeed. This young man seems quite suited for our Dustfire Blessed Land."

"Haha, you're too late, brother! Our Dongming Blessed Land has had our eyes on him for some time. We'll be bringing him to our blessed land for cultivation when the time comes."

"Now, now, brother—since when was it decided that someone your blessed land fancies can't be contested? We all represent different blessed lands here. Aren't you being rather domineering?"

The argument continued with neither side willing to yield, resulting in a stalemate.

This commotion eventually attracted the attention of a vast, cold consciousness.

"Such behavior is beneath you all. For this recruitment of talents from the lower world's True Spirit Ranking, there shall be no contention. Let them choose freely."

A moment of silence followed before numerous voices respectfully responded in unison:

"We shall obey True Inheritor Zhuming's instruction."

"Good."

The immense consciousness withdrew as suddenly as it had appeared.

After some time, a quiet voice remarked:

"Tsk, True Inheritor Zhuming just returned from the Sea of Desire Demons, yet instead of returning to the Upper Origin Green Scenery Cave Heaven to cultivate, he came here instead?"

"Probably to check on that little fellow who comprehended the basics of the Aurora Magnetic Sea."

Outside, silence still reigned.

Everyone stared at You Yuanming's name at the top of the Spiritual Merit Ranking, momentarily at a loss for words.

To leap ten steps of the Stairway in one go, advancing directly from the Tenth to the Eleventh Virtual Heaven—everyone present understood exactly what this signified.

Foundation Evolution!

Had this been an ordinary inner academy disciple achieving foundation evolution, it wouldn't have caused such a stir. While rare, a few such cases appeared every time the Myriad Gods' Miniature Heaven opened.

But for You Yuanming to evolve his foundation—that changed everything.

"Hahaha! A Golden Foundation... a Golden Foundation!" The master of the Thousand Methods Pavilion could no longer contain his excitement, laughing heartily without regard for the other academy heads present.

Yet no one blamed him.

After all, this was a Golden Foundation—something that could rank at the forefront of the True Spirit Ranking. It had been years since any of the three great academies had produced such a talent.

"Excellent! Truly excellent!" The Dragon Lake Academy head joined in the laughter.

"Fellow Daoist Qi, your Dragon Lake Academy truly produces prodigies one after another. First You Yuanming now, and next time when the Clear Sky Profound Brightness opens, there's Zhang Jing," the Mystic Light Academy head said, his tone sour.

Why did all the good fortune land in Dragon Lake Academy's lap? Why couldn't his Mystic Light Academy have such luck?

"That young Zhang Jing is currently in the Eighth Virtual Heaven. It's highly likely he'll fully comprehend his Dao Intent and establish a Golden Foundation. Even if not this time, he'll surely succeed when the Myriad Gods' Miniature Heaven opens next. Fellow Daoist Qi, congratulations. Two immortal seeds in consecutive cycles," the Divine Thunder Academy head offered his congratulations.

"Ah, Zhang Jing is still too young. I'll need both of you to look after him in the future," the Dragon Lake Academy head replied modestly.

"Of course. Our three academies share the same breath. After the Myriad Gods' Miniature Heaven concludes, if he has time, the young man is welcome to cultivate at our Divine Thunder Academy for a while. All our inheritances will be open to him."

"Our Mystic Light Academy extends the same invitation."

"My thanks to you both." The Dragon Lake Academy head's face blossomed into a wide smile.

Meanwhile, in the Myriad Gods Treasury:

"How much River of Time Gold Sand do you need this time, Zhang Jing?" Young Master's face wore an amiable smile.

Zhang Jing's expression remained perfectly calm. He'd long grown accustomed to this complete reversal from Young Master's initial attitude.

Ever since entering the Eighth Virtual Heaven, Zhang Jing noticed Young Master's demeanor toward him had changed. From this, he understood—Young Master wasn't inherently unpleasant; he simply treated people differently based on their status.

While aware of this, Zhang Jing showed no reaction. As long as he could exchange for what he needed, he couldn't care less about Young Master's personality or attitude.

A translucent jade talisman flickered before his eyes:

[Pure Origin Absorption Contemplation Method · Level 9 (8713/)]
Skill Characteristics: Gathering Origin Spirit Light (Low Grade), Crimson Spirit Light (Medium Grade), Dao-Guiding Spirit Light (High Grade)

"Still about 70,000 experience points short. One grain of River of Time Gold Sand provides 3,000 experience... I'll need twenty-four grains."

Connecting with the Dao Mark in his palm:

[Spiritual Essence: 4,937,900]

More than enough spiritual essence.

Looking at Young Master, Zhang Jing said calmly, "Please exchange twenty-five grains of River of Time Gold Sand for me."

"Right away!"
