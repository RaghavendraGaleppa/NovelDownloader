# Chapter 135: Inside the City of Heavenly Artificers

The morning mist atop Mount Guniu had yet to dissipate. Xu Yunfan stood halfway up the mountain slope, gazing down at the winding bronze gate that resembled a giant serpent.

The silhouette of the Mechanism City loomed faintly in the thin fog. Three hundred and sixty bronze watchtowers along the city walls emitted a cold light, and the roar of interlocking gears could be heard clearly even from miles away.

He gripped the True Disciple Token at his waist; the unique chill of metal transmitted through his palm. The rules of the Heavenly Artifice Cave required identity verification for entry, and even True Disciples were no exception.

However, there was something unusual about the Mechanism City today.

The merchant caravans at the city gates were still coming and going in an endless stream, the sound of camel bells mixed with hoofbeats, just as usual.

But when Xu Yunfan’s gaze swept over the crowd, it suddenly froze. Those outer affairs hall disciples who should have been inspecting tokens at the city gates had all been replaced by unfamiliar faces.

Although they wore the standard black casual attire of the Heavenly Artifice Cave, the copper tokens hanging at their waists were slightly worn, and some even had uncleaned bloodstains on their sleeves.

This scene made his heart sink slightly. Although he didn't recognize all the disciples on duty, these people were completely out of place with the disciples of the Heavenly Artifice Cave; their disguise was terrible.

No wonder the高层 of the Incense Fire Cult in the翠波城 (Cuibo City) who had reached the Blood Transformation Realm had said their preparations were rushed.

"Senior Brother Xu, those aren't outer affairs hall disciples of the Heavenly Artifice Cave. Today's gate duty should be handled by Mechanism Hall disciples. The daily duty roster is reviewed by the supervisors of each department; it couldn't be controlled by a single hall."

A hoarse female voice came from behind.

Xu Yunfan turned around and met the burning gaze of Yan Yuwei, the chief disciple of the Melting Gold Hall. Her eyes were bloodshot, filled with inescapable hatred, yet she suppressed it fiercely, not letting it affect her.

Her entire family in Cuibo City had been killed, yet she didn't rush into the city recklessly. Instead, she turned back to the Heavenly Artifice Cave. Aside from the initial madness upon seeing the massacre in Cuibo City, her every move now was composed.

Truly worthy of being the chief disciple of the Melting Gold Hall, possessing both superior temperament and aptitude.

This woman had changed her equipment at a checkpoint near the City of Heavenly Artificers, donning a rare set of the Melting Gold Hall's iconic red copper heavy armor. Beneath the heavy armor, a black tight-fitting outfit wrapped around her burly muscles. A meteorite mining pick was tucked at her waist, its tip glowing with a dark red luster, evidently having just been dipped in fire oil.

Xu Yunfan naturally wasn't clear about these things; since arriving at the Heavenly Artifice Cave, he barely had enough time for martial arts training, let alone concerning himself with such matters.

Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, Yan Yuwei realized he likely didn't know.

"I saw the outer affairs hall duty roster last month. The last ones guarding the gate should have been Qi Huan's 'Twelve Green Blade Guards,' but these people..." She paused. "They haven't even trained their bodies to the form of the Hidden Blade Pavilion. Now that the city gates are held, it's impossible for no disciples to notice, yet it's calm as ever. I'm afraid..."

"Let's go in and see first. Since there's no movement yet, there must be a chance to turn things around."

The two exchanged a glance and parted ways tacitly.

Yan Yuwei blended into the merchant caravan, her rough fingers rubbing the mechanism of the great mechanism sword's handle.

Xu Yunfan绕道 (detoured) to the west side of the city wall, where there was a secret passage leading directly to the Forging Hall. Zhan Yan had only informed him of this the day before; he could enter and exit using his True Disciple Token.

The iron door, covered in moss and blending in with the surrounding mountain, creaked open. Xu Yunfan grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer behind him, the dormant Qi and blood in his body slowly surging.

The萤石灯 (fluorite lamps) in the secret passage should have been permanently lit, but now they were all extinguished. A pungent smell of rust and tar filled the darkness.

He closed his eyes and focused, his ears twitching slightly. Thirty zhang away at a fork in the road, there was a faint sound of metal scraping.

"Click!"

After taking a few steps forward, a mechanism suddenly sprang underfoot. Xu Yunfan immediately retreated three steps. The ground where he had been standing collapsed instantly, revealing sharp spikes glowing with a幽蓝 (dark blue) toxic gleam below.

Simultaneously, dozens of holes split open in the stone walls on both sides, poisoned crossbow bolts pouring down like a storm!

*Thud!*

Xu Yunfan let out a low shout, the muscles and tendons of his entire body instantly tensing like iron and stone. The crossbow bolts struck his copper skin and iron bones, sparking as they deflected. He used the momentum to roll, swinging the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer horizontally. The wind of the hammer, carrying a scorching heat wave, smashed one side of the holes into scrap iron.

As scrap metal flew, a black shadow pounced from the ceiling, a chain blade in hand aiming straight for his throat!

"Ghost Strangulation Chain?"

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. It was a mechanical weapon developed by the Mechanism Hall.

The copper spring at the end of the hammer handle snapped open, and as the hammerhead slammed into the ground, the recoil force deflected the chain blade by three inches.

In that lightning-fast moment, he saw the attacker's face clearly—it was Outer Affairs Hall Supervisor Wang Huan!

He remembered him clearly. It was Wang Huan who was responsible for furnishing his courtyard; he was humble and polite.

At least, Xu Yunfan, with his extremely sharp six senses, hadn't detected any negative emotions from him at all. This made the heavy hammer in his hand slow down slightly, while his heart sank even further.

This secret passage was known only to the supervisors and elders of the various departments of the Heavenly Artifice Cave, aside from the True Disciples of each department.

"Brother Wang, you..."

Before he could finish, the whites of Wang Huan's eyes suddenly turned bloodshot, the veins on his neck writhing like earthworms, and the攻势 of the chain blade increased by another three points, clearly a desperate move.

Xu Yunfan's expression quickly calmed down. The hammerhead accurately struck his Tanzhong acupoint, and hidden force penetrated his body. Wang Huan immediately collapsed to the ground.

Tearing open his clothes, a dark purple bruise resembling a blood lotus appeared on Wang Huan's chest.

"Incense Fire Cult's Erosion Heart Pill!"

Xu Yunfan's eyes were inexplicably dark.

He had seen those who took this pill in Wuzhou; their internal organs were gnawed away by pill worms, eventually turning them into mindless killing zombies.

There was no saving him.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and brought his hammer down with a crash.

Holding the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, he rushed out of the secret passage. Xu Yunfan looked back at the scattered corpses inside.

These were Heavenly Artifice Cave disciples who had fallen victim to the Erosion Heart Pill, including more than a dozen inner sect disciples.

He raced all the way, heading deep into the Heavenly Artifice Cave to the Thunderfire Cave, where he saw Zhan Yan forging weapons.

"Master!"

Zhan Yan turned around. When he saw it was Xu Yunfan, a smile couldn't help but appear on his face, and he put down the red copper forging hammer in his hand.

"You've come at the right time, Yunfan. I've had quite good luck these past few days, forging several superior blades in a row... I went back to take a look when you were forging iron yesterday, and I just thought of a technique that can squeeze out more than ninety percent of the impurities in the meteoric iron. It will be much easier to forge it into thousand-fold steel then."

"Master, let's put this aside for now. Please listen to me first."

Xu Yunfan spoke first, telling Zhan Yan everything about how he and Yan Yuwei had arrived at the Cuibo Tower, discovered the Incense Fire Cult's massacre, and encountered Outer Affairs Hall Master Zhou Yuande on their way back to the Heavenly Artifice Cave.

Upon hearing this, Zhan Yan naturally found it somewhat fanciful and frowned. "Setting aside the martial artists in Cuibo City, the four major martial arts halls, the city's prefect, the military commander, and the martial arts experts, there are also ten thousand elite garrison troops. How could they suddenly be wiped out by the Incense Fire Cult?"

Xu Yunfan said, "I didn't believe it at first either, but that is the reality."

Zhan Yan pondered for a moment, then looked at the bloodstains hanging on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand, and the wine bag in his hand was crushed to pieces.
