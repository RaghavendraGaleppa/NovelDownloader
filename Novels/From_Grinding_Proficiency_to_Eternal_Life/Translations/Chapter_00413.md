# Chapter 413: Your Wansheng Transformation Sword Has Been Mastered

Yu Congling was filled with astonishment.

"The Three Talismans Sword Seed?"

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan asked, "What is that?"

"The Real Person is preparing to break through to the mid Foundation Establishment stage."

Her usually calm and indifferent tone finally showed some fluctuation at this moment.

She said with a hint of helplessness, "We were fellow disciples back then, yet now she has forged her True Dao Foundation, while I have become a mere skin bag, barely clinging to life."

Xu Yunfan ignored Yu Congling's sigh and continued to press for answers.

Yu Congling explained, "She is likely cultivating a supreme sword technique from the Wansheng Sword Sect, known as the Ten Thousand Transformations True Dragon Demon-Subduing Sword Qi. This technique not only requires slaying dragons but also uses dragon souls to nurture the sword!"

Taking advantage of the Wansheng Sword Sect's Foundation Establishment Real Person being fully focused on casting her spell, Xu Yunfan quietly retreated to the edge of the ice abyss.

Although separated by thousands of miles, and despite the fact that in the eyes of a Foundation Establishment Real Person he was nothing more than an insignificant ant, the path of cultivation was fraught with peril at every step.

A single moment of carelessness could lead to eternal damnation.

After all, he was still bound to Yu Congling's physical skin bag.

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly. "Do you have a grudge against her?"

Yu Congling fell silent for a moment before saying, "More than that. You can rest assured, if I were to be captured by her, I would surely suffer for eternity and never reincarnate."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. This was no lie; the hatred in Yu Congling's voice was incredibly intense.

It seemed that her trip to the Divine Martial Realm back then had also been a choice of desperation.

Hualing's silver bell was half-buried in the snow, its clapper still stained with the blood foam from her final moments.

As he bent down to pick it up, a wisp of pink smoke suddenly drifted out from the bell—it was the "Acacia Calamity" from the Hundred Desires Peak, hidden in advance.

"Looks like I underestimated you."

Xu Yunfan chuckled lightly. This poisonous smoke had been prepared for him; if he had been greedy for beauty just now, he would have surely fallen for it.

Indeed, every disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect was like a venomous snake, willing to bite back even in death, enjoying actions that harm others without benefiting themselves.

They loved nothing more than taking money but doing no work.

They would stick their faces to you if there were benefits, but turn a cold shoulder if there were none.

Just as he was about to leave, his Martial Dao Heaven's Eye suddenly detected movement beneath the ice layer.

The eight severed dragon qi auras were secretly converging, transforming into a blurry humanoid figure that knelt before him.

The figure held a crystal of ice in its palm, inside which was sealed half a green jade sword scabbard. It carried the same origin as the dragon severed by the Qingming Real Person, yet it felt even more ancient!

"This is... True Dragon Qi?!"

Xu Yunfan's heart suddenly raced.

Yu Congling also cried out in shock, "The Azure Sky Dew-Collecting Sword?! How could this treasure appear here?!"

Xu Yunfan: "Is this a treasure from your sword sect?"

Yu Congling's voice came rapidly, "This was refined by the previous Real Person who cultivated the Supreme Azure Sky Sword Art. It is extremely compatible with this sword technique. If one can harmonize with it, their own strength will increase by thirty percent."

The moment the ice crystal entered his hand, the Arctic Gale suddenly stilled.

The sky full of flying snow condensed into sword shapes, forming a strange sword array three zhang around him.

Xu Yunfan, enlightened by a sudden insight, immediately used his True Wu Subduing Demon Origin to simulate that dragon-slaying sword intent.

*Clang!*

The torn page of the *Wansheng Transformation Sword* in his chest suddenly ignited on its own, outlining the complete sword technique in the void.

**[Your Wansheng Transformation Sword has been Mastered]**

Seeing the attribute panel notification appear in his vision, Xu Yunfan instantly understood. Immediately after, he felt the sword scabbard in his hand become scalding hot. His whole body trembled slightly, and as if holding a hot iron, he frantically threw the scabbard away before leaving without looking back.

Xu Yunfan's figure had just vanished into the snowstorm when a graceful silhouette appeared like a phantom at the spot where he had just stood.

The woman wore a plain white gauze robe, its hem completely motionless in the biting cold wind, as if it had merged with this ice field.

She lowered her head to gaze at the Azure Sky Dew-Collecting Sword scabbard discarded on the snow, a hint of surprise flashing through her ice-blue eyes.

The icy patterns on the scabbard's surface refracted a seven-colored halo in the sunlight, reflecting the crimson "Sword Heart Seal" between her brows.

"Interesting..."

The woman's vermilion lips parted, her voice cold and clear like shattering jade. "To actually break free from the Cause and Effect threads I laid. Have my hands grown clumsy..."

She raised her slender hand lightly, and the scabbard flew into her palm through the air.

As her fingertips brushed over the lingering True Wu Subduing Demon aura on the scabbard, the jade hairpin in her hair suddenly burst forth with a seven-inch cold light.

"The True Wu Subduing Demon Scripture? I didn't think anyone would still be cultivating this Dao. So it's someone from the Primordial Demon Sect."

The woman's gaze sharpened, a cold smile curling her lips. "So Senior Sister Yu's skin bag is indeed parasitizing on this ant."

She raised her eyes to look in the direction Xu Yunfan had departed. The snowstorm automatically parted a path before her gaze.

Simultaneously, Xu Yunfan, who was already dozens of miles away, suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.

He felt his blood and energy boiling uncontrollably, the scales on his armor clamping shut on their own with a *zheng* sound.

Xu Yunfan's scalp instantly went numb; he hadn't expected someone to be able to pursue him after all.

The woman stood motionless, yet it seemed she could see Xu Yunfan's distress through the thousands of miles of snow and wind.

She tapped lightly on the scabbard with her fingertip, and the icy patterns immediately revealed the phantom of Xu Yunfan frantically leaping and running.

"Can you escape?"

She murmured to herself, her voice carrying a playful tone like a cat toying with a mouse. "Since you've entangled yourself with the karma of the Wansheng Sword Sect..."

The graceful figure raised her slender hand lightly, and the discarded scabbard flew into her palm through the air.

Just as Li Qingling's sword qi was about to condense, she suddenly felt the daylight darken.

The Arctic Gale froze instantly into a curtain of ice crystals, and a figure in a dark Daoist robe stepped through the spatial cracks, a white jade token hanging at his waist bearing the words "Primordial Origin" shining brilliantly.

"Daoist Li's dragon-slaying sword intent is becoming ever purer. It seems you will soon step into mid Foundation Establishment. To slay a flood dragon here in the extreme north, are you perhaps planning to cultivate the Ten Thousand Transformations True Dragon Demon-Subduing Sword Qi?"

As the young Daoist's wide sleeves billowed, the patterns of a hundred mountains secretly embroidered on his cuffs swallowed the scabbard's cold light completely.

He tapped his toe on the curtain of ice crystals, and the earth veins of the entire frozen plain trembled along with it, actually shattering the three thousand sword seals Li Qingling had secretly laid down.

A single step forward was filled with ease and naturalness.

Li Qingling's pupils contracted slightly, and the seven-inch cold light from her jade hairpin was instantly retracted. "The *Hundred Mountains Subduing Hell Scripture* of the Hundred Mountains Peak from the Primordial Demon Sect? When did Peak Master Chu become interested in the Arctic Wasteland?"

Chu Chengnan laughed lightly. "The Azure Sky Dew-Collecting Sword of your sect is indeed excellent, but it wasn't easy for my Primordial Origin Sect to cultivate a disciple to the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation. It would be a pity if she were killed by you."

"You've said too many high-sounding words," Li Qingling sneered. "You're just concerned about the True Wu Subduing Demon Scripture on him, aren't you?"

Chu Chengnan smiled upon hearing this and didn't deny it. The actions of Primordial Origin Sect disciples all had a purpose.

Li Qingling's gaze turned icy. Her fingertips lightly stroked the ice patterns on the scabbard and continued, "This scripture involves a vast amount of karma. If you step into this, you might find it difficult even to pass through the cycle of reincarnation."

Chu Chengnan's sleeves moved slightly, the phantom of a hundred mountains appearing and disappearing behind him, his tone still calm. "Daoist Li is overthinking. This matter does not require you to worry."

His gaze passed over Li Qingling, looking toward the figure that had vanished into the distant snowstorm. He said indifferently, "But your Wansheng Sword Sect, slaying dragons to steal their qi, acting against the heavens—aren't you afraid of the Heavenly Dao's retribution?"
