# Chapter 16: Display of Dominance

"Steward Sun is currently inside. Shall I go and announce your arrival?" Liu Jun asked in a low voice, following beside Chen Fei inside the North City Medical Hall.

Ever since he heard that a new Deputy Steward was coming to the North City Medical Hall, Liu Jun had been paying close attention. As a marginalized figure in the medical hall, only by latching onto someone powerful could he hope to advance. A new Deputy Steward, fresh to the place, would surely be unfamiliar with many things. Approaching them now would undoubtedly lead to closeness, perhaps even becoming their trusted subordinate.

"No need," Chen Fei shook his head. "We can wait until Steward Sun is free."

Chen Fei shook his head. Sun Shu clearly knew he was coming today, yet didn't bother to come out, likely indicating either a dislike for him, the 'parachute' appointment, or simply indifference. Either way, it represented Sun Shu's attitude. Chen Fei didn't care. Upon arriving at the North City Medical Hall, he had no intention of digging up any dirt on Sun Shu. His only goal was to refine pills peacefully, earn good money, and improve his cultivation. As for the 'pie in the sky' promised by the Zhang family, Chen Fei had absolutely no intention of biting into it.

"Does Steward Sun have any hobbies?" Chen Fei asked, after walking a round in the alchemy room, turning to Liu Jun.

"Steward Sun likes to kick feet," Liu Jun said, his expression a little strange.

"Kick feet?"

A smile appeared on Sun Shu's face. The servant's eyes widened in terror. Just as he was about to retreat, a foot already landed on his palm.

"Ah!" the servant screamed in agony. Sun Shu remained unmoved. Instead, his foot began to grind forcefully, and blood quickly seeped from beneath his sole, soaking into the soil.

"P-plea—"

"Crack!"

Before the servant could finish his plea, Sun Shu kicked his two arms, and the bones snapped with a loud crack. Before the servant could react, his body involuntarily toppled forward.

"Crack!"

Another crisp snap. Sun Shu had appeared behind the servant at some point, and stomped on his calf. The bone shattered, and blood splattered.

"Don't say I'm heartless; I left you one leg," Sun Shu said nonchalantly.

The servant had already fainted from the pain. The guards nearby immediately splashed water on his face to wake him up.

"Th-thank you, Steward Sun!" The servant's lips trembled as he looked up at the high and mighty Sun Shu, muttering.

[Cultivation Technique: Crossing River Cloud (Grand Completion)]

Compared to before, Chen Fei had made significant progress in both flexibility and speed. He had also witnessed some Skin-Refining Realm martial artists running, and with a slight comparison, he realized his movement technique was far superior. However, he still couldn't precisely determine what level he was at now. Moreover, the current Crossing River Cloud was far from its peak; Chen Fei intended to continue integrating other movement techniques into it.

In the night, Chen Fei, with his face covered by a mask, ran freely through Pingyin County. The exhilarating sensation made him want to let out a long howl at the sky. However, Chen Fei forcibly suppressed the urge. If he had let out that howl, the scene that followed would likely have been entirely different.

"Hm?"

As he ran into an alley, Chen Fei's ears twitched slightly, and at the same time, a faint scent of blood wafted through the air.
