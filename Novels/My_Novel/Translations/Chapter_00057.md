# Chapter 57: A Myriad of Industries, Beyond Reality

“Li Ye, you’re leading the patrol today.”

Just as Li Xian was lost in thought, a third-tier guard hurried over with an obsequious smile.

His name was Fu Yongfa, a portly man in his late forties. Yet, the way he called out “Li Ye” was incredibly smooth and ingratiating.

“Alright.”

Li Xian adjusted his breathing, calming his vital energy.

A second-tier guard’s daily duty was to lead a patrol. The team typically consisted of two third-tier guards and seven fourth-tier guards.

The patrol route was quite remote, usually taking them outside the manor.

“Wait a moment. I don’t know who’s in the team yet. Let me go get the roster first,” Li Xian said.

Fu Yongfa chuckled. “Li Ye, no need for a roster. If I just shout once, they’ll all know to come. Who would dare not show up?”

With that, Fu Yongfa’s expression shifted from fawning to fierce as he yelled at the crowd, “Whoever is on patrol with Li Ye today, report in immediately! If you’re late, Li Ye is magnanimous and won’t mind.”

“But I, Fu Yongfa, am not so forgiving. I’ll count to three.”

“Three…”

The words had barely left his lips when several people from the crowd scrambled over, their clothes disheveled, terrified of being a second too late.

These fourth-tier guards were terrified of offending their superiors. They paid the closest attention to the daily patrol roster. How could they not know who they were patrolling with today?

Li Xian hadn’t been a fourth-tier guard for long, so he wasn’t used to this and didn’t fully understand the situation. However, he had no desire to delve into the underlying dynamics.

The team was quickly assembled: two third-tier, seven fourth-tier, plus Li Xian, making a total of ten people.

Among the seven fourth-tier guards was a familiar figure, Zhuo Yilie, his former roommate. His head was lowered, not daring to look at Li Xian.

“The imprint of the Blue Jade Palm is still there…” Li Xian glanced over and noticed the purple-green palm print hadn’t faded at all, making a mental note.

He had never forgotten the matter of the Blue Jade Palm.

At that moment, another thought crossed his mind: “I’ll be entering the Leisurely Martial Pavilion soon to select a Tier 2 martial art.”

“Which martial art I choose doesn’t really make much of a difference to me, so I might as well exchange for the Blue Jade Palm. Once I’ve mastered the palm technique, I can conveniently settle this karmic debt. Why not?”

Li Xian said, “Since everyone is here, let’s go.”

This patrol route was quite long and winding, taking a full two hours, and it required leaving the manor.

Before setting off, Li Xian led everyone to the cafeteria to collect a sufficient supply of hot, dry flatbreads.

He distributed two pieces to each person. The fourth-tier guards got plain dry bread with no filling. The third-tier got vegetable-filled bread, while the second-tier got meat-filled bread, packed with beef and rich in fat.

Li Xian had a large appetite and was still growing, so he took three pieces.

“There might not be time for lunch today, so everyone will have to make do with the dry bread,” Li Xian announced.

“Let’s move out!”

Li Xian led the team, passing through two large bends and turning into a desolate, overgrown garden. The place was eerily阴冷, a chilling wind that seeped into one’s bones.

After walking for about fifteen minutes, they emerged from the garden, and the view suddenly opened up. A few more steps brought them to the manor’s side gate.

Second-tier guards were strong, and when they led patrols, they usually went outside the manor. They had to check on various mountain areas, forests, and fields. The routes were all planned in advance. After all, the Madam’s assets weren’t limited to just what was inside the manor.

A cool breeze greeted them, making them feel refreshed.

Li Xian stretched and looked out. The scenery between the mountains and forests was truly a beautiful sight.

Thousands upon thousands of trees were clad in silver, frost and lingering snow under a clear sun.

One might say the vast, beautiful landscape already had its master. Only the blowing wind and the faint sunlight were generous enough to be shared by all.

“Li Daye, should we go to the forest or the mulberry garden first?” Fu Yongfa asked.

“The forest first.”

There was a forest to the west of the manor, which provided all the firewood for cooking and heating within the estate.

After walking seven or eight miles, they saw a vast sea of trees. The southwest wind was blowing today, and from a distance, the trees swayed like a green ocean.

These were “Evergreen Trees,” which didn’t shed their leaves in winter and grew very quickly.

A manor with over a thousand people required an immense amount of firewood every day.

Li Xian led the team through the forest, inspecting for any wood thieves.

“Who’s there?!”

Fu Yongfa suddenly shouted harshly. Two fourth-tier guards beside him leaped into a patch of weeds.

Soon, they dragged out a beggar. One guard kicked the back of the beggar’s knee, forcing him to his knees, then pressed him down from above.

“Ouch…” the beggar wailed.

“Ah, so you dare to steal firewood? Beat him!” Fu Yongfa roared.

“N-no… Lord, I was just… passing by…” the beggar pleaded desperately.

The guard wasn’t about to listen to his explanation and was about to strike when Li Xian said, “He has no axe. He’s not a wood thief. Let him go.”

“Li Daye, this kind of scum, even if he isn’t stealing wood today, he surely will tomorrow.”

“Why not beat him to death and bury him? Heh, since he loves firewood so much, let him become nourishment for it. It would fulfill his wish. Who knows, maybe he’ll thank us in the underworld.”

Fu Yongfa suggested with a fawning tone.

The beggar shook his head violently, crying in terror.

“Oh?”

Li Xian felt a surge of displeasure at this suggestion. Seeing Fu Yongfa’s despicable face, flattering his superiors while bullying his inferiors, he felt nothing but disgust for such a person.

He then thought that burying beggars alive was clearly a common practice. With the forest so lush, this might well be one of the reasons.

If Li Xian went against the tide, the others wouldn’t dare disobey him, but they would surely gossip behind his back. It would be better to use this opportunity to establish his authority and instill fear in them, which would save him a lot of trouble.

He immediately backhanded Fu Yongfa with a resounding slap. “Does it hurt?”

Fu Yongfa was stunned. A handprint appeared on his face. He didn’t know why Li Xian had hit him, but he didn’t dare show anger or resentment. He didn’t even feel it was a humiliation, just chuckled, “No, no, it’s my honor to be slapped by you, Li Daye.”

Li Xian backhanded him again. This time, he infused it with his Internal Qi and the essence of the Quadrant Fist. Though it seemed like a light, casual slap, it felt as if it came from all directions, terrifying Fu Yongfa so much that his whole body trembled.

He sensed the scent of death and tried his best to dodge, but there was nowhere to hide. With a “bang,” Fu Yongfa was slapped to the ground, his nose bleeding profusely.

“Thank you, Li Ye, thank you, Li Ye.”

Fu Yongfa covered his face, knelt, and kowtowed, tears and mucus streaming down. If Li Xian hadn’t held back, he would have been killed.

He was terrified. This Li Ye was so young, yet his martial arts attainment was profound. He would never dare to harbor the slightest disrespect.

“Let him go,” Li Xian said calmly.

The fourth-tier guards didn’t dare disobey and quickly released the beggar.

Li Xian said, “Don’t come here again in the future.”

“Yes… yes, thank you for sparing my life,” the beggar said as he fled.

People like him didn’t have the courage to steal wood. He was probably trying to pick some fruit, got lost last night, used the weeds for shelter, and fell asleep in a daze.

After letting the lost beggar go, they continued their patrol of the forest.

Not far away, a group of laborers was chopping wood. At times like this, guards would usually make a special detour to enjoy the envious gazes of the workers.

Li Xian found it troublesome. He glanced from a distance and left the forest directly for the “Mulberry Garden.”

Upon arriving at the mulberry garden, he was even more astounded.

The Madam’s assets were immense. Tens of thousands of acres of fertile farmland were one thing, but this mulberry garden was also vast.

Moreover, it was nestled among the mountains, shielded from the wind and snow, making it surprisingly warm even in the dead of winter.

Over a hundred mulberry girls were hired to tend the fields and raise silkworms. The silk they reeled was crystal clear and difficult to break, indicating that these were no ordinary mulberry trees or silkworms.

The division of labor in the mulberry garden was clear: some picked mulberry leaves, others reeled silk. The girls were nimble and skilled, their movements practiced, making the patrolling guards unconsciously slow their steps.

“What kind of things are usually made from this silk?” Li Xian stopped a girl and asked curiously.

“Ah! A young second-tier guard, I haven’t seen you before,” the girl said, her eyes lighting up.

Li Xian smiled. “I was just promoted.”

The girl answered his question. “All sorts of things. For making clothes and fabrics, it has many uses. Also for making ropes.”

“There are clothes sold to shops in the market, and also sold to martial arts sects. So many, I can’t list them all in a short while.”

The mulberry girls were hired, not sold into servitude. In terms of status, they were quite high.

Some senior mulberry girls in the garden could even order the guards around.

“The Madam’s industries are truly bottomless,” Li Xian thought.

Using the patrol as an opportunity, he was truly broadening his horizons.

He gradually came to understand a truth: martial artists who have undergone a metamorphosis, despite possessing不可思议 power and unfathomable lifespan, are not ethereal gods. They are still people with their feet planted on the red earth!

They need industries to support them from behind!

Martial artists stand above reality, but they do not completely detach from it.

To judge a martial artist, one cannot just look at their strength, but also at the resources behind them!

In this book’s setting, the martial world will be revealed gradually, with a slow-burning pace.
