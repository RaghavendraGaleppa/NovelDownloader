# Chapter 313: Conversation in the Military Tent and the抚恤金 (1/2)

In the early morning, wind chimes under the eaves trembled in the cold wind.

Clothes hung inside the room were occasionally brushed by drafts sneaking in.

Strange, a piece of clothing with a local Southern Frontier style seemed to be missing.

It was unclear whether it had been hidden away by some divine thief or if something had gone wrong somewhere.

The Ice Cube was still quietly shining in harmony with the Jade Phoenix Divine Artifact.

She wasn't going to the military camp today, as it seemed she had reached a critical point in her cultivation.

"So strange," Little Li muttered to himself as he walked out of the side room. He put the Golden Creation Seal into his system space and fell into deep thought.

It turned out that in terms of being aloof, Brother Monkey was truly the strongest.

The Creation Seal still hadn't been stamped.

"Haven't I already领悟ed the Somersault Cloud?"

Li Mo walked onto the street, casually buying a Southern Frontier breakfast and eating a fragrant, spicy pastry.

As he headed towards the Green Wood Camp, he pondered over it.

The Golden Body was actually already perfected; its duration just depended on his physique.

Seventy-Two Transformations went without saying.

So, was it because of the Somersault Cloud?

"The true wonder of the Somersault Cloud is bridging a thousand miles in a single step, traversing a thousand li in an instant."

"Right now, I can only fly through the air; that can't be considered perfect."

"But it's not 'light' enough, and it's too ethereal..."

Li Mo was brainstorming when, halfway there, he suddenly bumped into a somewhat familiar figure.

Li Mo was stunned, almost failing to recognize him.

The person before him was disheveled, his clothes tattered and blackened. Only his eyes burned with spirit, along with that familiar wariness and inexplicable sense of stealth...

Huang Donglai?!

"Donglai, has your part-time business expanded to the Beggars' Sect? Your channels are too wide," Li Mo said.

"Brother Li? Cough, I didn't expect to see you in Green Wood City," Huang Donglai's eyes lit up, then he苦笑ed.

"To be honest with Brother Li, I was entrusted by someone to deliver a military report to the Green Wood Camp. This disguise is for convenience."

Li Mo nodded, the light of the Heaven's Fate Divine Eye fading from his eyes as he smiled.

"So it's a part-time delivery service. I was actually thinking of you yesterday. Commander Qu offered me a fine steed, but I didn't take it."

"????" 

After all, there weren't many people in this world who remembered him. Huang Donglai was quite touched.

If he hadn't heard the reason.

"Donglai, since the military report needs to be delivered to Commander Qu anyway, and since your report is rather urgent, why don't you enter the camp with me?"

"That was my intention."

Li Mo led Huang Donglai, and the two entered the Green Wood Camp together. The patrolling soldiers saw it was Li Mo and let them pass unobstructed all the way.

There were many types of disaster beasts in the Southern Frontier. Yesterday, he hadn't even shown all the transformations available in the Seventy-Two Transformations. He was originally supposed to continue the military drill today.

On the drill ground today, company commanders and platoon leaders were already leading their soldiers in specialized training. The entire camp gave off a feeling of intense activity.

This scene falling into Huang Donglai's eyes carried a sense of an impending storm.

"Brother Li, there might be warfare in Green Wood City soon. You should make plans early and leave."

"Warfare?"

Li Mo was taken aback, his brow furrowing.

There hadn't been warfare in the Southern Frontier for many years. Why was it happening so suddenly...

He seemed to recall something vaguely, his brow tightly furrowed, and he didn't answer Huang Donglai's question.

After a brief通报, the personal guard brought Commander Qu's reply and led the two into the central command tent.

Inside the tent stood a sand table over three zhang wide and long, depicting the map of Green Wood City. This should be military机密. Commander Qu Sheng could have chosen another place to meet them, but for some reason, he still chose this place.

Qu Sheng stood before the map, seeing the two of them with a gentle smile.

"The guard said that this friend of yours, Young Hero Li, has an urgent military report?"

"Commander Qu, commoner Huang Donglai..."

Huang Donglai handed over the letter. After delivering it, he seemed relieved.

Li Mo was somewhat curious about what this so-called military report was, but it wasn't his place to inquire. However, he felt a sense of heaviness in his heart.

---

Because he only saw Qu Sheng's expression growing increasingly grave.

"Please, sit."

Qu Sheng invited the two to sit and personally poured them tea.

"This letter is very important. Thank you, righteous warrior, for traveling a thousand miles and risking your life to deliver it. No wonder you are a friend of Young Hero Li."

After saying that, he looked at Li Mo and took a deep breath.

"Go. Leave Green Wood City."

Li Mo, holding his teacup, hurriedly asked, "Is the warfare in Green Wood City... very serious?"

Qu Sheng looked at the map, somewhat lost in thought, no longer hiding his weary demeanor.

"These past few days, I have used the 'Art of War' to calculate the battle situation many times. Initially, the chance of victory was only thirty percent. It wasn't until Young Hero Li appeared that the chance of victory exceeded half."

"Until I saw this letter today."

"Yes, I knew this battle would happen long ago. Some days ago, I intended for you and the Young Marquis to leave together, but back then, to increase our chances of victory, I swallowed those words."

"I truly cannot bear to see the brothers and the王爷's efforts, the Green Wood City built from nothing, go up in flames..."

"... "

Li Mo fell silent for a moment.

Why did Qu Sheng know in advance?

The Celestial Jade.

He wasn't stupid; he just hadn't experienced war.

"And what about you, Commander? If there is no chance of victory..."

"A clay pot is destined to break by the well; a general is难免 to die on the battlefield."

Qu Sheng filled their teacups.

"Actually, many years ago, when I followed the王爷 to slay that wicked crocodile, I should have died back then."

"You two are different. Both of you are hidden dragons and geniuses, young heroes. A vast world awaits you in the future."

"Go, if you wait any longer, you won't be able to leave."

Qu Sheng cupped his hands towards the two, weary.

The tent fell silent again, the sound of the wind outside格外刺耳.

At this time, Huang Donglai spoke again.

"This letter was given to me by a scout in his last moments. He should belong to the Green Wood Camp."

A section of a bamboo tag was placed on the table.

"Young Hero Li, the person you are looking for is also here. There is nothing left for you to worry about in this place."

Exiting the central command tent.

Huang Donglai asked quietly, "Brother Li, are you alright?"

"I... Let's go. Let's go collect the pension for Lu Yi."

Li Mo shook his head, his gaze firm.

He had only thought about achieving military merit and displaying divine might on the battlefield.

But seeing this military tag right before his eyes, it was so刺眼.

That's right, a clay pot is destined to break by the well; a general is难免 to die on the battlefield.

War causes bleeding; people die. Isn't that normal?

He had never met this soldier named Lu Yi. Helping deliver his pension to his family would be completing a good deed, right?

But what if.

This war was started because of him?

Ten-odd minutes later.

The two arrived at the quartermaster's department, which was also a tent.

The quartermaster, upon receiving the military tag, counted out a string of copper coins.

"Young Hero Li, this is all there is."

"Only this much?"

"The imperial court does indeed have regulations: twelve taels of silver for those who die in battle. But we are far from the emperor here, and the military pay was actually funded by the王爷's personal wealth..."

Thirty or forty copper coins, each one worn smooth and shiny.

They reflected the young man's suddenly pale face.
