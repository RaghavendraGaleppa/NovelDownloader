**Chapter 255: Just Act**

Night fell. On the high tower, the thunder-fire dissipated, but the metal tiles, embedded with special runes, still glowed in the darkness.

Inside the quiet room, Qin Ming's flesh and blood became translucent, radiating brilliance. In his abdomen, a Golden Core spun rapidly, like a condensed sun. The room was filled with a refreshing medicinal fragrance.

The Celestial Radiance from the outside world had not yet faded; it remained dense, enveloping him. As he breathed deeply, through his mouth, nose, and even his pores, brilliant light surged, dazzling to behold.

Qin Ming sat in meditation, thunder and fire merging, dragon and tiger converging, internally refining "wondrous great medicine."

Excluding the Silk Scroll Arts, Qin Ming had mastered ten wondrous techniques in total: Five Elements, Dragon Snake, Golden Cicada, Undying Butterfly, Wither and Flourish, and Black and White. Now, all these methods were harmonized, returning to their true essence and unifying.

"These ten wondrous techniques refined into a Golden Core, this time it can truly be considered flawless and complete."

In the stone chamber, when Qin Ming opened and closed his eyes, it was as if lightning was born in the void.

His Flawless Wondrous Technique Golden Core, after absorbing all the Celestial Radiance, projected his own image, identical to him.

As Qin Ming's entire body glowed and he gave a sudden jolt, the entire complete Golden Core burst open. A dazzling little figure rose, then transformed into a stream of light, rushing into his limbs and bones.

"What an astonishing sight!" Even an elder like Zhao Ziyuan revealed a look of surprise.

"Incredible," Yu Gensheng sighed. "No wonder Little Qin is much stronger than other Neo-Mortals."

Qin Ming felt the changes within himself. His physique and Celestial Radiance had improved, and his spiritual field had strengthened. Naturally, his power surpassed his past self.

However, he frowned. This was different from the records in the books; he still hadn't managed to step into the mid-stage of the Second Realm. Something was missing.

He remained seated, pondering.

Outside, Li Qingyue breathed a sigh of relief. If even the Celestial Radiance hadn't harmed him, there was nothing to worry about.

Little Wu, puzzled, said, "I can feel that Brother Ming has become stronger, so why is he frowning so deeply?"

Zhao Ziyuan explained, "Progress in the Second Realm of the Neo-Mortal Path is slow. He's looking for an opportunity, hoping to find another way, to explore a more efficient breakthrough method."

Qin Ming pondered for a long time, and he finally understood the "bottleneck."

This time, his overall strength had increased, but it was due to localized changes: his physique, Celestial Radiance, consciousness, etc., each had different degrees of improvement.

"It's still missing that crucial last piece."

Qin Ming realized the problem: his body, spiritual field, and other aspects hadn't undergone unified changes, but rather "acted independently," lacking a coordinated sense of thoroughness.

Previously, when he first became a Neo-Mortal in the First Realm, a vigorous life force surged within him, and all aspects were transforming. He could even clearly perceive his lifespan increasing.

Today was different; the various changes were quite scattered.

"It should be a complete marrow-cleansing and sinew-changing, like gaining a new life."

Qin Ming knew that some areas hadn't kept up with the transformation; this change was still flawed.

He rose and walked out of the stone chamber.

"Little Qin, don't rush. All you lack is time," Yu Gensheng advised.

Zhao Ziyuan added, "Neo-Mortals in the Second Realm, known as 'Manifestation,' can use Celestial Radiance to capture various substances beneficial to the body. This is a process that requires long-term accumulation, where quantitative change eventually leads to qualitative change."

Who didn't understand that principle? Even geniuses needed to "endure" time.

Just one Second Realm could consume a person's entire youth.

"Alas, if that's the case, I'm worried for Brother Ming!" Little Wu exclaimed.

Yu Gensheng suggested, "Auspicious beast blood could allow Little Qin to undergo a nirvana once."

They all knew this was a shortcut.

But did every small hurdle, and the later grand realms, require searching for such rare blood medicine to overcome? That was simply unrealistic.

Qin Ming had consistently restrained himself from using the auspicious beast blood precisely because he believed valuable resources should be used wisely, not to be stuck at the first minor hurdle.

Li Qingyue suddenly spoke, "According to various ancient texts of the Immortal Path, whether it's thunder-fire or Celestial Radiance, each time they descend, they bring a large amount of mysterious substances, often unique."

Instantly, the high tower fell silent.

The few people present naturally understood what this meant immediately.

Qin Ming was not afraid of the Celestial Radiance's erosion. If he continuously received it, entering the high tower and the Thunder-Fire Alchemist Hall every time there was a thunderstorm, then he would surely accumulate enough to reach "completion" in not too long, allowing quantitative change to lead to qualitative change.

Little Wu clapped his hands, "Indeed, for others, being covered by Celestial Radiance is like stepping into hell, a dead end. But Brother Ming is different; he can turn a losing game into a winning one!"

"The Immortal Path has deep research into thunder-fire and Celestial Radiance. They need it for artifact refining and also use it to refine immortal flames," Zhao Ziyuan nodded.

Li Qingyue said, "I'll write down some information for you. The Outland has done detailed research on what special substances correspond to different colors of thunder-fire and Celestial Radiance."

Clad in white, her figure was as slender and graceful as an immortal willow. Without any makeup, her faint smile made her seem like the morning glow breaking through the clouds over the sea, radiating immense brilliance.

Qin Ming's final confusion vanished. All that remained was to act.

However, he wanted to visit the blighted lands. Refining malevolence and merging strange substances was an urgent matter that needed to be done.

Kunling had Absolute Lands, Blessed Lands, Blighted Lands, and even sealed Yin Earths and Jade Capitals, all incredibly mysterious.

The next day, Patriarch Yu Shaohua of the Immortal Path gave a sermon, attracting a large crowd to listen to his immortal teachings.

Qin Ming and Little Wu also went, believing that one could learn from others' strengths and gain new insights.

"Hiss, Li Qingxu has broken through to the late stage of the Second Realm! With a bit more refinement, he'll reach completion, and entering the Third Realm will be just around the corner!"

No one had expected someone to break through while listening to the sermon.

For a moment, many people cast astonished gazes, sighing that he was indeed an Immortal Seed. Even after suffering major setbacks, he could still emit dazzling brilliance.

Those who knew the inside story understood that it wasn't that he wasn't strong enough, but that he had fought only peak battles, and all those who appeared were ruthless individuals.

For example: Li Qingyue, Little Wu, the heavenly prodigies from ancient immortal daoist sanctuaries, and Qin Ming. One could say that all the opponents he encountered were "monsters."

In truth, what harmed Li Qingxu the most were his "own people," such as his senior brothers and venerable elders from his clan. When he and Qin Ming had their public duel, after enduring for some time, those people actually felt that his performance was good enough.

"See? This is a disciple of our Immortal Path. Setbacks in youth are merely fleeting scenery along the way, nothing to dwell on. Soon, that former opponent will be left far behind!"

"Yes, a former sage once said that if one encounters a Neo-Mortal who practices special force methods in their early years, even if there's a 'nominal defeat,' it's nothing to worry about. Just smile freely and leave your opponent with your back; in the years to come, you are destined to be people of two different worlds."

Li Qingxu's breakthrough sparked heated discussion, with some Immortal Path disciples "empathizing."

On that very day, Qin Ming set off for the blighted lands.

It was three hundred and fifty *li* from Kunling City, constantly shrouded in dense fog, with bursts of malevolent light occasionally rising, making it extremely dangerous.

This area was frequented not only by Neo-Mortals collecting various malevolent and strange substances, but also by disciples from other paths.

Because various malevolent substances, divine substances, etc., were rare materials, not only could they be used for artifact refining, but also to temper one's spiritual field.

That day, news reached Kunling City that Qin Ming had been seen in the blighted lands.

Instantly, many people understood that he was refining malevolence, a necessary process for those on the Neo-Mortal Path in the Second Realm.

Some showed worry, suspecting that he was restless after hearing of Li Qingxu's breakthrough.

Even some on the Neo-Mortal Path themselves thought this way, worrying for him.

One could imagine the reaction of the Esoteric Sect and Immortal Path disciples.

People naturally assumed that Qin Ming felt pressure and also wanted to break through as soon as possible.

But how easy was that?

The Neo-Mortal Path emphasized accumulation; the more impatient one was, the worse it would be.

For a time, many Immortal Path disciples deeply understood the profound wisdom of those words from their predecessors.

"A nominal defeat is not a defeat. We stand on a golden grand path, wide and long enough. As long as we cultivate step by step, we can leave our past opponents far behind."

Others reminded that the young man on the Neo-Mortal Path possessed extraordinary talent, having embarked on the path less than a year ago, perhaps even only seven or eight months.

"Even a future Patriarch-level figure would need at least several centuries of accumulation to truly shine, and anything can happen during that time!"

The greatest confidence of those from the Outland was that they had constantly been blazing new trails, staying in a leading position.

Whereas the Neo-Mortal Path had been stagnant for many years, with no new sections to explore.

If things continued this way, a Neo-Mortal Path Patriarch several centuries later should no longer be a threat.

In the thick fog, Qin Ming's concentration was extremely high. His eyes were hot, and all scenery became clearly visible as he activated his "Neo-Mortal Eye."

He had been in the blighted lands for over half a day, marking many areas.

During this time, he encountered Yin Malevolence, Earth Malevolence, Fire Malevolence, etc., none of which were quite satisfactory.

His standards were now very high; he only wanted to find legendary "malevolence," otherwise, it wouldn't be worthy of the Star-Fire Essence he had already collected.

"Five-Colored Divine Fire Malevolence!" Little Wu excitedly pointed ahead. This was considered an extraordinary "heavenly material," recorded in many books.

"Chase!" Qin Ming whispered.

However, it flashed and vanished underground.

Little Wu sighed, "These malevolent substances have sentience; some instinct makes them seek fortune and avoid danger, making them very difficult to capture!"

Before coming, they had done their homework.

The so-called blighted lands were likely related to ancient, immortal, top-tier great sects, established by them as places to nurture malevolence; otherwise, it would be impossible for such a variety to exist.

Ironically, the so-called immortal great sects of yesteryear had perished, while the blighted lands still remained, preserved.

No one knew what level of malevolence and strange substances existed in the deepest parts of these blighted lands, because after long years of nurturing, many malevolent substances had mutated. Some had become useless, while others had become even more terrifying.

As time passed, Qin Ming successively discovered several mutated malevolent substances, all incredibly bizarre. Some should already be considered legendary terrifying substances.

For instance, a ball of light contained patterns, like a divine lamp suspended high in the night sky, incomparably sacred, yet its essence was still a form of malevolence.

Unfortunately, when Qin Ming tried to capture it, it flashed and disappeared instantly.

"As long as they exist, I'm not worried about not even seeing them," Qin Ming was full of anticipation. As long as he captured the "Night Matter" and paired it with the Star-Fire Essence,

Then he would be complete, and breaking through again would be smooth sailing.

The blighted lands stretched for a thousand *li* of barren earth, not a blade of grass grew, and the dense fog grew heavier in the gloom.

"Brother Ming, there's a thatched hut ahead, with a dim lamp. The lamp wick seems to be a kind of malevolence!" Little Wu felt his mouth go dry, seeing such an unusual sight in this deathly silent place.

Qin Ming nodded; he had already seen it.

"There's also a humanoid lantern, emitting a faint, eerie light." Little Wu was first surprised, then his scalp tingled as he said, "Could that be a human skin lantern?!"

Upon approaching, they breathed a sigh of relief; it was just made of paper.

However, after Qin Ming looked closely, he was shocked. The humanoid lantern was lifelike, very much resembling an old acquaintance from Twin Tree Village!
