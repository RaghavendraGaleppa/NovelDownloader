Chapter 57: Cross-Server Conversation, The Terrifying Effects of Earth Pulse Spirit Milk

Fifteen minutes later.

In the distance, Jiang Chulong was hugging a broken bowl, licking the bottom of it like a little cat. Her dirty face finally relaxed a bit as she savored the delicious wild vegetable and meat porridge. The warmth spread through her numb body, and the pain in her chest eased.

She secretly raised her head, glancing at the young man beside her.

The young man was resting his chin on his hand, gazing towards the direction of Qingyuan Mountain with a worried expression, as if he was concerned that a certain "ice cube" might poison him while cooking.

Seeming to sense her gaze, the young man turned his head back.

Jiang Chulong's head dropped again, her face buried in the bowl.

"I... I'm done eating," she stuttered.

"If you're not full, I can make some more," Li Mo offered.

Looking at Jiang Chulong, who was covering her eyes and lowering her head in a timid and humble manner, Li Mo felt a growing sense of peculiarity.

She was once the Princess of Yu, and even a random princess would be received with grand ceremony at the Ziyang Mansion, with the three sect masters attending in person.

"Don't... need... more," Jiang Chulong replied, shaking her head vigorously like a rattle drum.

"Save the rice for later?" Li Mo asked.

Jiang Chulong nodded.

Li Mo couldn't help but feel a sense of absurdity, but it didn't clash with his expectations.

"Muyong Mansion has a charity hall where you can get porridge and rice for a while," Li Mo informed her.

Upon hearing this, Jiang Chulong raised her head, and despite the cloth covering her eyes, it was clear that her eyes lit up.

"If... if we save it until winter..."

"You're really planning to save it for the new year?" Li Mo asked with a helpless smile.

He thought for a moment and took out two silver tickets of relatively small value.

"If you're short on food, just go buy some on the street," he said.

Jiang Chulong looked at the silver tickets, her dirty face filled with confusion.

"What's... this?" she asked.

Meng Can, who had eaten his fill, rubbed his belly contentedly and explained, "That's money, sister! You can use it to buy food, roast chicken, and candied haws. It's very useful!"

He took the silver tickets and examined them closely, his eyes widening in shock.

"One... one hundred taels!"

"One hundred taels... how much is that?" Jiang Chulong asked.

"One tael of silver can buy 140 catties of rice!" Meng Can replied.

Jiang Chulong's eyes widened in shock, her fingers trembling as she calculated.

The princess was stunned.

"Too... too much..." she stammered.

Li Mo anticipated her next words.

"You want to say that we're strangers, and you can't accept so much money, right?" he asked.

Meng Can looked at Li Mo in amazement, wondering how he knew what Jiang Chulong was thinking.

Jiang Chulong nodded timidly, her face tense.

Li Mo continued, "First, one hundred taels is nothing to me. It's no different from a bag of rice or a grain of rice."

The little beggars looked at Li Mo with admiration, especially Meng Can, who gazed at him with a strong sense of longing.

Jiang Chulong was taken aback, seemingly intimidated by Li Mo's "generosity."

"Second, I was entrusted by someone to take care of you," Li Mo explained.

"Entrusted by someone?" Jiang Chulong repeated, her voice barely above a whisper. Her small hands suddenly gripped her clothes tightly.

"Is... is she still alive?" she asked.

Mei Yi, her mother's former sword servant, was the only one who still cared for her. Jiang Chulong had been taken care of by Mei Yi since her mother's death.

"Yes, she's currently out of danger," Li Mo replied.

Jiang Chulong's eyes welled up with tears beneath the cloth covering her face.

Tears streamed down her face, and she hastily wiped them away, making her face dirty again.

"Thank... thank you," she stammered.

"But this money... is still... too much," she said.

Li Mo thought for a moment and suggested, "Why don't you come with me to Qingyuan Sect? You'll be able to see her then, and you won't have to worry about living expenses."

Jiang Chulong slowly shook her head.

"I... I don't want... to put her in danger," she said.

Li Mo understood that Jiang Chulong was still being pursued by the Tianwei guards, the strongest martial force in the Dayu Empire.

"Alright, it's getting late. I'll head back first," Li Mo said, deciding to take things slowly.

Jiang Chulong's situation wasn't suitable for being around him for an extended period, and she wouldn't want to be either.

As Li Mo left the dilapidated residence, the little beggars saw him off.

In the courtyard of Muyong Mansion's separate residence, Li Mo pondered.

"If I can help Jiang Chulong practice martial arts again, the system will surely yield unimaginable rewards," he thought.

But how could he achieve this without keeping her by his side?

Just as he was thinking, a maidservant arrived.

"The hot water is ready, young master. Please bathe," she said.

Li Mo lay in the large bathtub and received a reward.

[Earth Pulse Spirit Milk]: "A drop of this condensed from thousands of years of earth pulse energy is a sacred product for tempering blood and energy. Its most potent effect is prolonging life!"

Li Mo thought, "I'm not in need of longevity. I'll use it to temper my blood and energy."

He opened the bottle of Earth Pulse Spirit Milk and poured two drops into the bathtub.

The addition of the spirit milk caused the water to glow with a crystalline light.

Li Mo operated the Fire Lotus Method directly in the bathtub.

The moment he did, the resonance between heaven and man became much stronger, and the entire Muyong Mansion could sense it clearly.
