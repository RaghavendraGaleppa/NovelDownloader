# Chapter 67: Such a Monster  

"Disciple has learned a variety of spells, so I humbly ask for the Sect Master's guidance," Zhang Yan said respectfully to Mo Changqing.  

"No problem at all. As the saying goes, 'many skills make light work.' It's no bad thing for a young man to learn more spells," Mo Changqing replied. He naturally favored polite disciples, especially when they belonged to his junior sister—such favor only grew stronger.  

"Many thanks, Sect Master. Then this disciple will make a fool of himself."  

With that, Zhang Yan began casting spells.  

**First spell: Wood Essence Art!**  

A verdant green light shimmered as he lightly tapped a spiritual plant seed. Instantly, the seed took root, sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit—all within a few breaths. However, after flowering, the entire plant withered away.  

"Wood Essence Art at the Perfection Stage—impressive, impressive." Both Zhuge Wan and Mo Changqing were well aware of Zhang Yan's mastery of this spell, so they showed no surprise.  

Without wasting words, Zhang Yan continued.  

**Next, his spiritual energy surged, and a wispy cloud materialized in the air.** Before Mo Changqing could react, Zhang Yan had already levitated effortlessly.  

Fortunately, Mo Changqing's cave abode was spacious enough to accommodate such displays.  

Zhang Yan flew beside the cloud, tapped it lightly, and raindrops began to fall, soon turning into a torrential downpour.  

"Perfection-Stage **Spiritual Rain Art**? And **Lightness Art** at the Perfection Stage too?"  

Mo Changqing's expression shifted as Zhang Yan demonstrated two more perfected spells.  

**Three perfected spells!**  

Mo Changqing, the esteemed Sect Master of Qingheng Sect, had only mastered three spells to perfection before reaching Foundation Establishment. Yet this young man before him had already achieved the same at just the fifth level of Qi Refinement.  

**A genius.**  

This boy was undoubtedly a genius!  

It was a shame such talent wasn't his own disciple.  

Then again, glancing at Zhuge Wan—well, since this disciple belonged to his junior sister, it was practically the same as being his own.  

Just as Mo Changqing was about to rise and praise Zhang Yan for his three perfected spells, the young man wasn't finished.  

A single drop of water formed in Zhang Yan's palm—clear, pure, brimming with vitality.  

"This…"  

"**Perfection-Stage Water Essence Art!**"  

At this moment, Mo Changqing felt a pang of exasperation.  

*You can be a genius, but must you be* this *much of a genius?*  

*You're making my three perfected spells before Foundation Establishment look pathetic!*  

---  

"Junior Sister, you've truly given me a surprise," Mo Changqing sighed deeply at Zhuge Wan.  

Zhuge Wan: "???"  

She wanted to say that she, too, had been unaware that Zhang Yan had **four** perfected spells. She had thought it was only two.  

But in reality, it wasn't just four.  

It was five.  

There was also **Spirit Nurturing Art**.  

Unfortunately, that particular spell wasn't easy to demonstrate, so Zhang Yan had only shown four.  

No matter.  

Beyond perfected spells, Zhang Yan also had Great Achievement spells, Minor Achievement spells, and even entry-level ones.  

By the time Zhang Yan finished his display, both Mo Changqing and Zhuge Wan had fallen into stunned silence.  

Their gazes bore into Zhang Yan, neither speaking a word.  

Zhang Yan, unnerved by the scrutiny of two Golden Core elders, finally broke the silence.  

"Does… does my spellcasting have any issues?"  

Mo Changqing and Zhuge Wan exchanged glances.  

**Issues?**  

**There were massive issues!**  

How could a mere disciple know **this many** spells? And with such mastery—Great Achievement, Perfection Stage!  

What were they, as elders, supposed to do now?  

But under Zhang Yan's "innocent" gaze, Mo Changqing swallowed his words and forced out a strained compliment.  

"Excellent… truly excellent. To possess such comprehension at your age is rare indeed."  

"Many thanks, Sect Master."  

"Very well. You may leave now. Your master and I have matters to discuss." Mo Changqing waved him off.  

Once Zhang Yan was gone, the Sect Master's composed expression twisted into something far more animated.  

"Junior Sister! Junior Sister! Did you see that?! **Four perfected spells!** Every perfected spell becomes a divine ability after Foundation Establishment, increasing the purity and density of one's spiritual energy by ten percent! With four perfected spells—and likely eight or nine by the time he reaches Foundation Establishment—his spiritual energy will be **twice as potent** as others!"  

"With so many divine abilities, he could likely **challenge mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators while still in the early stage!** This boy is a **once-in-a-generation prodigy!**"  

Mo Changqing couldn't contain his excitement.  

"Naturally. After all, whose disciple do you think he is?" Zhuge Wan replied with a composed smile, though inwardly, her heart was roiling with shock.  

"By the way, Senior Brother, I recall our Qingheng Sect has a certain sword technique that no one has mastered in generations. Perhaps we should let Zhang Yan attempt it," she suddenly suggested.  

"That sword technique's difficulty is…" Mo Changqing hesitated, then nodded. "But with Zhang Yan's talent, it might just be possible."  

The technique was infamous for its complexity. In Qingheng Sect's long history, only three had ever mastered it—and each had gone on to become Sect Master, leading the sect to victory in countless expansion campaigns.  

"Very well. I'll have someone deliver the manual to Zhang Yan later," Mo Changqing agreed without further objection.  

A disciple with such courtesy, comprehension, and background was undoubtedly worth nurturing as a core successor. Even if the technique was a top-tier heritage of Qingheng Sect, Zhang Yan had earned the right to learn it.  

"Also, Senior Brother, what do you think about Zhang Yan becoming a **True Disciple**?" Zhuge Wan pressed.  

Zhang Yan had exceeded even her expectations, making his candidacy for True Disciple all the more compelling.  

"A True Disciple **should** be someone like Zhang Yan!" Mo Changqing declared without hesitation.  

His initial reluctance had stemmed from ignorance of Zhang Yan's monstrous talent. Now that he knew, why would he oppose?  

Besides, Zhang Yan was practically **his** disciple by association. Who else would he support?  

"However, Junior Sister, this matter still requires the approval of all elders. It concerns the sect's future leadership. And you know Old Lei is pushing for his grandson to become a True Disciple—there may be significant resistance."  

"Old Lei…" Zhuge Wan murmured softly, her eyes narrowing.
