# Chapter 96: The Tribunal

He, meanwhile, took several guards and went off somewhere unknown.

Two guards pressed down on his shoulders, glaring fiercely at Zhou Tian. This man had just blasphemed their supreme Lord, and were it not for His Holiness the Pope's orders, they would surely thrust their spears into his skull and stir! Zhou Tian was pushed down forcefully, his body slightly bent forward. Four silver-armored guards followed on either side of him, all with grim expressions.

Zhou Tian felt the pressure on his shoulders and narrowed his eyes. However, his main goal now was to rescue Zhang Yi, so he did not retaliate.

Although the Tribunal was said to be underground beneath the central cathedral, it wasn't entered through the cathedral itself. They turned left and right within a cluster of spire-topped buildings behind the cathedral, arriving at a hidden structure. Like the surrounding buildings, this one was also a white, spire-topped house. A silver-armored guard walked forward, approached the door, and placed his hand on the wooden surface. A milky-white light glowed, a magic array appeared on the door, then it split open, and the door automatically opened.

The group entered. On the surface, it looked like an ordinary house, but the silver-armored guards escorting him opened another hidden passage. After walking through it for some time, they arrived at a place similar to the previous house, but it was still not the Tribunal. Zhou Tian was speechless. The infrastructure was too backward; they made it so complicated just to protect one entrance.

After wandering for a long time and passing through another passage, the scene before them suddenly brightened. It was no longer the monotonous house scenery but a brightly lit area. Zhou Tian had just thought they were going to open another secret passage in a room, but unexpectedly, they arrived at their destination so abruptly. He looked up at the silver-armored guards escorting him and noticed they also seemed surprised, as if they didn't expect to arrive so suddenly either.

This place was about tens of square meters, with white floor tiles, and a sacred aura flowed through it. At the far end stood four figures in white robes, enveloped in light, their appearances unclear. Behind them was a magnificent statue of an Archangel of Judgment, leaning on a Holy Sword.

Six people pushed him forward. A silver-armored guard approached and said, "Your Excellency, Inquisitor, this is a Voodoo cultist sent by His Holiness the Pope."

"A Voodoo cultist?" The white-robed figure slightly to the left in the center spoke, his voice ancient. "Haven't you been hiding like rats for many years? When did you dare to jump out again?" He was speaking to Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian was stunned. Asking him? He didn't know. After a moment of silence, he shouted, "Long live Voodoo!" No matter what others said, he just needed to shout slogans.

"Another one twisted by an evil god. May our Lord forgive you." The white-robed figure sighed and nodded to the other three. The four turned back, bowed their heads towards the statue of the Archangel of Judgment, and whispered. Zhou Tian couldn't hear clearly; it sounded like some kind of incantation.

As the four whispered, the Holy Sword held by the Archangel of Judgment emitted a glow. Streaks of white runes appeared, then detached from the Holy Sword, intertwining and combining in the void. Soon, a portal composed of white runes materialized. Zhou Tian frowned. *Not a physical passage?*

"Enter!" A silver-armored guard barked, abruptly pushing Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian stumbled and entered the light portal. The portal then closed, and the silver-armored guards bowed and retreated, leaving only the four white-robed figures standing silently.

As for Zhou Tian, after entering the light portal, he felt a dizzying sensation, and when he regained his senses, he was in a dark environment. Before he could properly observe his surroundings, he was pulled up from the ground by... no, not a person. Although the thing in front of him wore silver armor, Zhou Tian could see through the gaps that inside the armor was actually a ball of light.

"An energy construct. How did the technological level suddenly jump up a notch here?" Zhou Tian mumbled to himself. He was dragged by this energy construct in one direction, muttering to himself, while also glancing at his surroundings. It was a very dim space with little light, so he could only see his immediate surroundings; anything further was obscured.

They passed various torture devices: a stone rhinoceros-horse with sharp spikes on its back, an iron brush with dozens of metal barbs. Even traces of blood remained on them—not just red, but also green and blue, clearly not just human. Just looking at the designs of these things made Zhou Tian's scalp tingle. However, he was relieved to see that these torture devices seemed to have been unused for a long time. Even those made from extraordinary materials had a lot of rust, and many parts were even broken.

Passing the area where these torture devices were kept, they gradually approached the cells. The Holy Church no longer held its ancient glory; most of these cells were empty. Suddenly, a dishevelled humanoid creature burst out from a cage, crashing into the black metal bars. White patterns lit up on the metal bars, and flames ignited out of nowhere, burning the creature, which screamed in agony but lingered on, not dying. It screamed as if shouting something, but no sound was heard, despite the large gaps in the metal bars.

The energy construct remained unmoved, continuing to walk forward with Zhou Tian.

A flash of light caught Zhou Tian's attention. He turned to look, and in one of the cells, Zhang Yi stood behind the bars, reaching out to grasp them. White light-flames enveloped him completely. He was enduring the pain, and the light came from these flames. Seeing Zhou Tian looking, he released his grip, a faint smile forcing its way onto his pale face. Zhou Tian gestured to him to be at ease and memorized the cell's location.

Figures also emerged from nearby cages, each with a bald head and gaunt face. Seeing Zhou Tian, their eyes surprisingly showed a look of schadenfreude, seemingly pleased that he had fallen to this state. Zhou Tian secretly curled his lips. *Serves you monks right for being abandoned.*

After walking for another stretch, Zhou Tian was led into an empty cell. The energy construct threw him in, locked the door, and a wisp of light floated into the metal bars. White runes flashed and vanished, activating the restriction. Zhou Tian wasn't in a hurry. He casually sat on the ground. Since he was already in, he would first see what kind of place this was.

Nothing here made one feel the passage of time. After an unknown period, Zhou Tian checked his Undying System and saw that his revival count had refreshed, indicating that a day had passed. Throughout that day, not a single entity passed through this place. Even the energy construct seemed to have forgotten about them, never showing its face again, as if certain that the prisoners here had no way of escaping.
