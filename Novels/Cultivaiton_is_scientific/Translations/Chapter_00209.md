# Chapter 209: Threads of Sword Intent  

Li Yuanba strode into the mission hall of the Outer Sect Combat Division. At the task submission counter, he retrieved a corpse from his storage and tossed it onto the ground.  

"Mission complete," he said coldly.  

The chilling killing intent radiating from him was unrestrained, causing nearby cultivators to instinctively step back. While the Netherworld Sect was indeed a major sect, even among the battle-hungry Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Outer Sect Combat Division, none had undertaken missions with such relentless intensity.  

In just over a month, five hostile early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators had fallen to his blade, their corpses delivered as proof of completion. Combined with the three early-stage, one mid-stage, and one late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators he had previously eliminated, Li Yuanba had slain a total of ten Foundation Establishment cultivators since joining the sect.  

Such a killing spree was striking even within the demonic Netherworld Sect.  

The attendant at the counter flipped the corpse over, verified its identity, and processed the mission completion, transferring the corresponding contribution points to Li Yuanba's identity jade slip.  

Glancing at the 2,050 contribution points now recorded in his jade slip, Li Yuanba nodded in satisfaction. His relentless mission completions had earned him a considerable amount of resources.  

He stored the corpse back into his spatial artifact—such remains were valuable spoils of war. Among demonic cultivators, intact Foundation Establishment corpses fetched high prices as prime materials for refining corpse puppets.  

On the second floor of the mission hall, an elder observed Li Yuanba with keen interest. Pure sword cultivators like him were exceedingly rare in the Netherworld Sect. Most demonic cultivators pursued shortcuts to power, with few willing to painstakingly temper themselves and dedicate years to comprehending sword intent.  

"Assign him Mission Sixteen," the elder commanded just as Li Yuanba was about to select a new task.  

The attendant stiffened momentarily before quickly understanding. He cast a furtive, fearful glance upward, then swiftly averted his gaze, wary of displeasing the elder.  

"Fellow Daoist," the attendant said with a smile, "given your impressive track record, I have a high-reward mission here. Would you be interested?"  

"What kind of mission?" Li Yuanba's interest was piqued. Such lucrative missions rarely appeared in the public listings, as they were usually prioritized for inner sect or core disciples.  

To understand the Netherworld Sect's mission system, one had to grasp its hierarchy. The sect placed great emphasis on combat missions.  

For example, a mission to eliminate a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator might offer 100 contribution points. However, the actual reward varied depending on the executor's cultivation level.  

If completed by a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was classified as a first-tier mission, granting the full 100 points.  

If completed by a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, it became a second-tier mission, with a 50% increase in reward (150 points).  

If completed by an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, it escalated to a third-tier mission, doubling the reward (200 points).  

Conversely, high-level cultivators completing low-level missions saw drastically reduced rewards.  

This system incentivized most sect members to stick to first-tier missions, as lower-tier ones were inefficient—consuming the same time for half the reward.  

The Outer Sect Combat Division lacked truly powerful Foundation Establishment cultivators, as the strongest had already advanced to the inner sect. Thus, only a few were willing to undertake second- or third-tier missions.  

"Here's the mission," the attendant said, handing Li Yuanba a handwritten briefing.  

Li Yuanba accepted it. The mission was classified as first-tier for his cultivation level, yet it offered a staggering 2,000 contribution points—equivalent to the total he had earned from slaying ten Foundation Establishment cultivators, including one late-stage expert.  

In other words, the mission was exceptionally dangerous. The target, an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, was deemed as threatening as a late-stage opponent.  

The mission objective was Ren Pengxiao, a remnant of the Earth Vein Sect. Once a mid-to-large sect in the Ten Thousand Mountains, the Earth Vein Sect had been annihilated by the Netherworld Sect, its mountain gate shattered.  

Many Earth Vein Sect disciples had escaped, and Ren Pengxiao, a former core disciple, was among them.  

The Netherworld Sect's approach to such enemies was systematic: their intelligence network scoured the Ten Thousand Mountains, reporting sightings immediately. Rather than dispatching higher-level cultivators, the sect assigned peers to handle the threats. This strategy honed their disciples' combat prowess and allowed the most talented to amass greater resources, further strengthening the strong.  

Normally, such a mission would never reach the outer sect.  

A core disciple from a mid-to-large sect, especially one carrying survival treasures after their sect's fall, was prime prey for the Netherworld Sect's inner and core disciples. After all, such targets were bound to possess substantial resources.  

Li Yuanba was puzzled as to why this mission had landed in his hands. But with such an opportunity before him, he wouldn't let it slip away.  

"I accept this mission," he declared firmly.  

"I'll process it immediately," the attendant replied, relieved to have fulfilled the elder's directive.  

Without even returning to his cave abode, Li Yuanba summoned his jade flying boat and set off toward the target's location.  

The Netherworld Sect's intelligence network was formidable. Ren Pengxiao had hidden within a rogue cultivator family, posing as their son-in-law.  

After three days of travel, Li Yuanba arrived at the family's residence. The strongest cultivator there was merely an early-stage Foundation Establishment patriarch, with the rest at Qi Condensation—no match for the mission target.  

Stowing his flying boat, Li Yuanba assessed the family's defensive formation with disdain. Though he couldn't directly access his main body's formation mastery or IBMz15's computational power, his advanced formation knowledge allowed him to bypass such rudimentary setups effortlessly.  

The rogue family was poor, their formation serving only as an alarm with Qi Condensation-level defenses—easily shattered by a few strikes from a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator.  

But Li Yuanba had no need to break it. Slipping in through a weak point, he navigated the formation's energy channels, avoiding its nodes entirely, and entered undetected.  

Inside, several courtyards surrounded a modestly abundant spiritual vein—likely mid-grade. His gaze settled on one courtyard, outwardly unremarkable but protected by a formation far superior to the others.  

This defensive formation was crafted by a formation master, beyond Li Yuanba's ability to bypass unaided. But he had no intention of studying it. Instead, he deployed thirty-six formation flags around the courtyard.  

Once the flags were in place, he soared into the air above the courtyard without hesitation.  

"Ren Pengxiao, come out and die!" Li Yuanba bellowed, channeling spiritual energy into his voice.  

Simultaneously, his Swiftwind Goldenlight Sword slashed down onto the courtyard's defensive formation. The barrier shuddered under the assault as the sword descended again and again.  

In just two breaths, the sword—imbued with terrifying sword intent—struck five times. The formation, lacking a skilled overseer, soon collapsed under the relentless onslaught.  

"Ren Lang, what's happening?" a female voice called out before a male figure shot into the sky.  

Li Yuanba's overwhelming aura had cowed the rogue family's cultivators into hiding. Only when Ren Pengxiao confronted the intruder did they realize their seemingly Qi Condensation son-in-law was actually a powerful Foundation Establishment expert.  

"Li Yuanba of the Netherworld Sect Outer Sect, here to claim your life!" Li Yuanba announced, sensing Ren Pengxiao's aura. His declaration served as a warning to the family—interference would mean opposing the Netherworld Sect.  

"To think the Netherworld Sect would send an outer sect disciple after me!" Ren Pengxiao let out a maddened laugh, his voice thick with humiliation.  

As a former core disciple of the Earth Vein Sect, he had expected inner sect or core disciples to hunt him—not an outer sect nobody. The insult stung, fueling his rage and killing intent.  

"Die!" Li Yuanba ignored his outburst, sending his sword streaking forward.  

Ren Pengxiao summoned a spirit artifact shield, blocking the strike. As he prepared to counterattack, he noticed the shield faltering.  

"You're a sword cultivator?!" Ren Pengxiao shrieked, his voice laced with horror.  

Now he understood why the Netherworld Sect had sent this outer sect disciple. A pure sword cultivator in the Netherworld Sect—and merely an outer sect member? Unheard of!  

Instantly, he resolved to kill Li Yuanba. Slaying a Netherworld Sect sword cultivator would be no less impactful than killing an inner or core disciple.  

He produced a yellow orb, channeling earth-attribute spiritual energy to erect a thick earthen barrier.  

This was an Earth Vein Sect specialty—a spirit artifact capable of storing earth spiritual energy to deploy a formidable defensive shield. The barrier could withstand multiple full-power strikes from a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, buying Ren Pengxiao time to eliminate Li Yuanba.  

Li Yuanba's sword strikes now landed with diminished effect. His eyes narrowed as he spotted Ren Pengxiao retrieving a talisman treasure.  

Knowing he couldn't afford to let Ren Pengxiao activate it, Li Yuanba triggered a secret technique from the Ten Directions Sword Art. His sword accelerated, hammering a single point on the earthen barrier with relentless precision.  

He held nothing back now. Surging forward, he fully unleashed the Sword Demon Codex, manifesting his third-grade sword foundation.  

With the sword foundation leading, he poured all his spiritual energy and physical strength into its tip—a charging technique from the Sword Demon Codex, concentrating every ounce of power into a single piercing strike.  

The target was the spot his sword had repeatedly struck.  

After over a month of relentless combat, Li Yuanba had fully embraced his identity as a sword cultivator. He no longer summoned his zombie servant at the first sign of danger.  

Unless death loomed, he would trust only his sword.  

Of course, his version of sword cultivation was unorthodox. Traditional sword cultivators wielded a single flying sword, but Li Yuanba carried both a flying sword and a close-combat blade.  

Yet this didn't negate his status as a sword cultivator. As his focus converged on the sword foundation's tip, all his sword intent coalesced there. Even his flying sword froze mid-air.  

"Die!" Li Yuanba roared as the sword foundation's tip met the earthen barrier.  

A grating screech erupted as metal clashed with earth—the sound of his sword's metal-attribute spiritual energy forcibly penetrating the barrier's earth-attribute energy.  

Two breaths had passed since Ren Pengxiao activated the talisman treasure, its surface now flickering with runes.  

Ren Pengxiao was confident in his defenses. Against a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, they might not hold long, but an early-stage opponent—even a Netherworld Sect core disciple—couldn't breach them in three breaths.  

His strategy against Netherworld Sect elites relied on the Earth Vein Shield Orb and talisman treasure combo. Activate first, and victory was assured.  

The sword foundation lodged in the earthen shield, its tip barely penetrating. The shield's unique property prevented complete collapse even when breached.  

The tip hovered a mere thirty centimeters from Ren Pengxiao—an insurmountable gap.  

As the talisman treasure neared full activation, Li Yuanba's sword intent surged. The pressure forced him to push his limits.  

A hair-thin strand of sword intent detached from the sword foundation, drifting like a breeze across Ren Pengxiao's arm.  

Silently, the arm—still clutching the talisman treasure—separated from his body. The half-activated treasure instantly deactivated.  

"Sword Intent Threading..." Ren Pengxiao murmured, seemingly numb to the pain.  

Sword intent manifested in many forms. While all could disrupt spiritual imprints in artifacts, other effects depended on the swordsman's comprehension.  

Li Yuanba practiced the Ten Directions Sword Art. Though lacking a natural sword bone limited his sword intent compared to his main body, Li Shiming, his focus on sword cultivation granted him deeper understanding.
