# Chapter 45: Zixu

Among the crowd, there was an old acquaintance of Tian Ling's, a disciple of the Haotian Sect. He was her junior brother, quite the looker, reaching the Earth Treasury Realm in cultivation. He also wielded a Saint Artifact, and through the past two days of competition, he had accumulated quite a few female fans…

Although this young man had been in the Imperial Capital for a long time, for some reason, he hadn't sought out Tian Ling until he qualified for the top sixteen. There was a small anecdote regarding him.

That day, Zhou Tian and Tian Ling were returning from the competition grounds. It was the last match to decide the top sixteen. After today, the competition format would no longer be so casual; each match would be grander and more ceremonious. After all, from this point on, things truly started to get interesting.

Zhou Tian and Tian Ling were being lovey-dovey in their carriage, enjoying themselves immensely, when they heard a loud shout from their servant outside:

"Why are you blocking my master's path?"

Hearing this, Zhou Tian's body stiffened. He released Tian Ling from his embrace. Was the "show-off and face-slapping" cliché about to begin?

Filled with excitement, he lifted the curtain to see a young man standing in front of the two Thunder Flame Steeds. He wore a blue shirt and a white robe, appearing young, with a long sword strapped to his back.

The stopped Thunder Flame Steeds snorted loudly, spewing crimson flames that almost enveloped his face. The hair on his forehead was slightly singed. Although his expression showed a hint of nervousness—after all, they were Dharma Aspect Realm exotic beasts, their might was still formidable—he still didn't move aside.

The Imperial Capital residents nearby pointed and whispered, their faces filled with schadenfreude. Blocking the Qin King's Manor's carriage? This young man probably had a death wish…

Divine steeds possessed intelligence. Even though the young man blocked the carriage's path, they wouldn't attack without permission. After all, the Qin King's Manor wasn't a tyrannical gang that would take lives at will.

Just as Zhou Tian was pondering how to speak in a way that would be both imposing and dignified, Tian Ling suddenly exclaimed from beside him:

"Junior Brother!"

"???"

Zhou Tian had a look of utter bewilderment. He glanced at Tian Ling, then at the young man below, only to hear Tian Ling continue:

"Zhou Tian, this is my junior brother…"

"Junior Brother?"

Zhou Tian scratched his head, feeling vexed.

"Since you're family, come up and talk!"

When would the "show-off and face-slapping" plot finally arrive!!!

The young man climbed into the carriage, looking slightly reserved. Once inside, he was visibly startled by its luxurious interior. After a moment of being stunned, he finally spoke:

"Greetings, Senior Sister! Greetings… Young Master Zhou!"

Tian Ling was clearly delighted. After all, this was a reunion with an old acquaintance in a foreign land; it was understandable to be happy seeing someone familiar for the first time since arriving in the Imperial Capital days ago.

She grabbed the young man's arm and asked:

"Zixu, why are you here? Are you by yourself? Has Uncle Ling come?"

Zhou Tian narrowed his eyes, looking at Tian Ling's hand clutching the other's arm…

"I came to participate in the Youth Grand Competition. An elder from the sect brought me. My master had affairs to attend to this time, so he didn't come."

Zixu slowly replied, looking at his long-unseen Senior Sister, a deeply hidden hint of adoration in his eyes.

"Then why did you only come looking for me now?"

Tian Ling, with her sparkling big eyes and simple heart, didn't think much of it. She only saw him as her junior brother whom she hadn't seen in a long time.

"If I didn't achieve a good result in the competition, how could I have the nerve to come see Senior Sister?"

Zixu rubbed his head and chuckled.

"You also made it into the top sixteen?"

Tian Ling asked with surprise, every frown and smile exuding extraordinary grace, her voice as soft as celestial music, her eyes as bright as a clear moon.

"Yes, I was lucky enough to!"

Though Zixu's words were humble, there was a faint hint of pride in his heart. After all, entering the top sixteen meant he was already considered outstanding among the younger generation in Futian Province.

Zhou Tian pursed his lips. *If you're so great, don't use a Saint Artifact! What's there to be proud of?*

Tian Ling smiled, her eyes like crescent moons. "Then Uncle Ling will surely be very happy!"

Then, as if remembering something, she sobered her smile and asked:

"Oh right, how has my master been recently…?"

Zixu was silent for a moment before speaking:

"The Sect Master misses you very much and wishes for you to return for a visit…"

Return?

Zhou Tian glanced at the young man, his eyes full of hidden meaning.

Tian Ling fell silent, saying nothing.

Zhou Tian took the initiative to speak:

"You're Zixu, right? Where are you staying? I'll send you over."

He made no attempt to hide his intention of sending him away. Tian Ling looked at Zhou Tian, hesitant to speak, but in the end, remained silent.

Zixu lowered his eyelids, his expression unreadable, and said softly:

"No need to trouble Young Master. I can go back by myself!"

"Senior Sister, goodbye!"

With that, he stepped out of the carriage.

After Zixu left the carriage, Tian Ling's eyes swirled as she looked up and asked:

"Zhou Tian, are you upset?"

Zhou Tian was slightly startled. *My Tian Ling truly has an exquisite heart. Although I'm a little jealous, how can I show it?*

"No, how could I be? Why would I be upset?"

Three denials in a row!

"Your face is so dark it looks like it's about to drip water, and you say you're not upset…"

Tian Ling mumbled softly, just loud enough for Zhou Tian to hear.

Zhou Tian's face was awkward. *Is it that obvious?*

"That's right, I'm jealous! So what?!"

Zhou Tian, red with embarrassment and vexation, cupped Tian Ling's pretty face and said fiercely.

"Zixu is my junior brother. We grew up together, and our relationship is very good. I've always seen him as my little brother."

Tian Ling's face was slightly red as she looked at Zhou Tian, who was so close, and explained.

"Grew up together, childhood sweethearts?"

A jealous man is unreasonable! Zhou Tian keenly latched onto that phrase.

"…………"

Tian Ling looked helpless. *I explained so much, and that's all you focused on?*

"You're not allowed to interact with him in the future, do you hear me!"

Zhou Tian said "fiercely."

"But he's my junior brother…"

Tian Ling mumbled softly…

*Slap!*

Zhou Tian slapped Tian Ling on a certain spot. It was soft and yielding, very comfortable…

"Ah…"

Tian Ling gasped, a tingling sensation reaching directly into her heart. Her face was so red it looked like it could drip blood, and she said indignantly:

"Zhou Tian… you… shameless!"

Tian Ling finally understood. All of Zhou Tian's earlier setups were just to take advantage of her.

"Do you hear me?!"

Zhou Tian's expression remained unchanged. *What's wrong with being shameless? I just am shameless!*

"I… I hear you…"

Tian Ling wanted to argue, but seeing Zhou Tian raise his hand again, she could only succumb to his playful authority.

"That's right, time for a reward!"

Zhou Tian nodded in satisfaction, his palm covering a soft and tender spot, kneading it vigorously…

Another gasp. Tian Ling's body went limp, unable to muster any strength, and she collapsed into Zhou Tian's embrace. Her entire body was covered in a faint pink hue, her pretty face like a sunset, and her bright eyes seemed to be veiled by a film of water…

After returning to the Qin King's Manor, Zhou Tian instructed his servants to investigate this person named Zixu. He just had a feeling that this young man wasn't so simple.

Jealousy? How could it be because of jealousy that he ordered an investigation? Was he, the Young Master of the Qin King's Manor, truly so petty?
