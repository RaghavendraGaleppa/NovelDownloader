# Chapter 204: An Unexpected Blame

Dai Budong's group consisted of over twenty people. Apart from him and Zhu Duiyou, who were Foundation Establishment cultivators, the rest were elite members of the Dai family, all at least at the late Qi Refining stage.

These were Dai Budong's blood relatives from his branch of the cultivation family, his trusted subordinates and the foundation of his future achievements. If he succeeded in the succession battle and became the Dai family's heir, he would receive the family's full support, including various spiritual materials to aid in forming his Golden Core, and his supporters would also benefit.

If he eventually broke through to the Golden Core stage and became the family head, these people would become his closest advisors, automatically rising to become core elders wielding significant power within the family.

As for Zhu Duiyou, he was Dai Budong's sworn brother and most trusted companion. There was no question—he would be well taken care of.

Upon entering Wangyue City, the group first headed to the Dai family's local reception center. After traversing seven or eight streets in the northern part of the city, they arrived at an ancient-style pavilion.

"Dai Family Hostel."

"Brother Zhu, this is our family's base in Wangyue City. We've been traveling nonstop for two days—let's rest here first."

Just as Dai Budong was about to lead everyone inside, a worker emerged from the building, pulled out the large flag bearing the character "Dai" from its stone pedestal, and replaced it with one bearing the character "Yang."

"???"

The Dai family members halted in confusion. Dai Budong was equally stunned. He quickly retrieved a jade slip from his storage bag, comparing the map inside repeatedly. This was indeed the Dai family's reception center—wasn't it?

He hurried forward and respectfully inquired, "Brother, isn't this the Dai family's property? Why has the flag been changed to 'Yang'?"

The worker, about to return inside, turned back upon being addressed. Seeing the twenty-some people standing dumbfounded at the entrance, he politely explained, "Honored guests, this place did indeed belong to the Dai family, but as of today, it has been sold to the Yang family."

"The Yang family? Which Yang family?"

"Which other Yang family is there in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world? Naturally, it's the Yang family of Luzhong County."

The Yang family of Luzhong County—another mining giant in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world, comparable in strength to the Dai family. Not only were they industry competitors, but they also engaged in constant overt and covert conflicts.

Dai Budong's expression darkened instantly upon hearing this. He hadn't expected their old rivals, the Yang family, to be involved. The Dai family's Golden Core elder in Wangyue City had only fallen two days prior, and the Yang family had already acquired their property. Could the murderer be connected to the Yangs?

---

The worker, merely an employee, quickly returned to his duties after answering. With no place to stay, the Dai family members had no choice but to seek out other properties.

One disappointment followed another.

The Dai family's artifact forge in Wangyue City had been acquired by the Wang cultivation family.

The Dai family's metallurgy workshop in Wangyue City had been bought by the Lingyun Sect.

The Dai family's ore processing plant in Wangyue City had been taken over by the Crane Gate.

The Dai family's spiritual material warehouse in Wangyue City had been purchased by the Zhaoshen Fortress.

The Dai family's artifact repair building in Wangyue City had been acquired by the Liuyang Sect.

...

After visiting all these locations, the group was stunned.

The entire vertically integrated metallurgy industry the Dai family had painstakingly built in Wangyue City over the years had been dismantled and sold off???

Six or seven sects and families from the Lu Kingdom's mining industry—all competitors of the Dai family to varying degrees—had swooped in like sharks smelling blood, eagerly snapping up the pieces. Meanwhile, the mastermind behind it all, Lin Shan, was leisurely counting his money from a high-end trading event!

The Dai family members stood dumbfounded before the last property.

They hadn't even begun their investigation, and their family's entire foundation in Wangyue City had already been sold off.

How were they supposed to explain this to the family elders?

This was an enormous dereliction of duty.

Cold sweat broke out on Dai Budong's forehead as he suddenly realized why none of his brothers had competed for this assignment—it was clearly a trap!

The deeds to these properties had originally been held by the deceased Golden Core elder. After his death, they would naturally fall into the murderer's hands, and their subsequent sale would require a scapegoat.

So who would take the blame?

The dead elder?

Impossible. A Golden Core elder was a family patriarch, representing the family's honor. The blame would fall on someone lower down.

Dai Budong had volunteered for this investigation, and the properties had been sold off after his arrival in Wangyue City. Who else could be blamed but him?

"Damn it, I've messed up!"

Only now did Dai Budong realize the gravity of the situation. This case was a hot potato, and in his eagerness to prove himself, he'd rushed to take it on without considering the consequences. Before he could even begin his investigation, he was already mired in trouble.

Worse, there was no way to clear his name. None at all!

When the family conducted its review, this blemish would disqualify him from the succession battle, rendering all his efforts futile.

Moreover, the value of these properties was staggering—estimated at nearly a million spirit stones! How could he possibly compensate for such a loss?

---

At this critical moment, it was his loyal friend Zhu Duiyou who stepped in, placing a steadying hand on Dai Budong's trembling shoulder.

"Brother Dai, stay calm! What's done is done. We can only take things one step at a time. Don't lose your composure now."

Dai Budong thought of his brothers vying for succession, likely laughing at his misfortune behind his back, and couldn't help but mutter in distress, "How can I stay calm? Losing our family's assets in Wangyue City is a colossal loss. How can I possibly shoulder this responsibility? The elders will hold me accountable—I'll be forced to take the blame!"

"That damned murderer! Killing our Golden Core elder wasn't enough—they had to frame me too..."

"I'm so unlucky to have taken on this cursed assignment!"

...

"Brother Dai, pull yourself together!"

Zhu Duiyou's stern voice cut through Dai Budong's panic. With a solemn expression, he said, "What's lost is lost. We must focus on making amends. We need to not only gather information about the deceased elder but also uncover the murderer's true identity and strength, easing the elders' burdens."

"Think about it—if we not only complete our original mission but also identify and capture the murderer, recovering the lost assets in the process, our merits could outweigh our faults. You could still impress the family elders with your performance!"

"From what I've seen, your competitors are nothing but short-sighted cowards who shirk responsibility at the first sign of trouble. You, on the other hand, face challenges head-on. True leadership is revealed in times of crisis—this is the quality the family values most!"

"We've only just begun. How can we falter before even starting? Remember, you have me and all these loyal brothers by your side!"

"The game isn't over yet—we're still dark horses in this race! The final outcome is still within our grasp!"

...

Zhu Duiyou's impassioned speech struck Dai Budong like a wake-up call. Gradually, clarity returned to his eyes, and he bowed deeply to his friend.

"With you by my side, Brother Zhu, I'm like a fish returned to water or a tiger granted wings. What great undertaking could possibly daunt me?"

Zhu Duiyou helped Dai Budong up, his eyes reflecting genuine emotion. "I'm glad you've regained your spirit, Brother Dai. Since we've lost our accommodations here, let's find another place to stay and plan our next steps."

The Dai family disciples behind them gazed at Zhu Duiyou's back, struck by his towering presence and calm demeanor, and couldn't help but feel admiration.

Taking his friend's advice to heart, Dai Budong adjusted his mindset and led the group through the city, eventually renting a spacious cave dwelling.

...

Over the next two days, while Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon lurked in the shadows, sneaking around various merchant houses—one busy purchasing formation materials, the other finding buyers for the Lin Merchant House—the Dai family exhausted all means to collect information about the deceased Golden Core elder, compiling it into a jade slip.

"Brother Zhu, should I send this jade slip back to the family with one of our men for the elders to review?"

"That would be best. We can continue gathering more information, but what we have now should be sent back immediately."

"What should we do next? Wait for the family's response or take the initiative to hunt down the murderer?"

"Brother Dai, you already know the answer in your heart. Follow your instincts."

...

Dai Budong dispatched a subordinate to deliver the report while discussing their next steps with Zhu Duiyou. To offset his impending blame, he needed to identify the murderer before the family made any final decisions, achieving significant results before the arrival of a new Golden Core elder to salvage his current predicament.

His confidence in finding the murderer stemmed from their recent discoveries—the case wasn't as complicated as it seemed. The root of the incident traced back to a newly risen "Lin Merchant House."

Their investigation revealed that the Lin Merchant House had registered in Wangyue City fifteen years prior. Within just over a decade, it had rapidly captured the local market with its unique marine spirit products, emerging as a promising new enterprise.

In the past two years, as the Lu Kingdom's Tunxing Mountain Range experienced beast riots, disrupting seafood supply channels, the Lin Merchant House had somehow capitalized on the crisis to aggressively expand its market share in Wangyue City. Its brazen tactics had drawn attention from nearby factions.

Before his death, the Dai family's Golden Core elder had incurred massive debts while refining his lifebound treasure and was desperate for funds. Thus, he'd set his sights on the Lin Merchant House, planning to seize it through overt and covert means to fill his financial gap.

This wasn't hard to deduce—after all, Dai Budong himself had lent this uncle 1,500 spirit stones, and Zhu Duiyou had contributed 800 as a gesture of goodwill. Most perceptive juniors in the family had similarly offered loans.

As a newly advanced Golden Core elder, he could have been a valuable ally in Dai Budong's succession bid. Although the selection process for the family heir was supposed to be fair and transparent, blatantly bribing family elders was unacceptable. Small loans, however, could leave a favorable impression.

Yet this uncle had barely spent five years in Wangyue City before meeting his end, leaving behind this mess.

Now, the murderer was at large, having sold off the Dai family's properties and counting his profits—utterly shameless.

---

The prime suspects in the case were the masterminds behind the Lin Merchant House, previously residing in the city's western affordable cave dwellings: a white-robed young man and a gray-cloaked, hooded figure.

Their portraits had been gathered:

The first painting depicted the white-robed youth leisurely sipping tea in his courtyard, likely glimpsed by a neighbor passing by when his door was open.

The second showed the hooded figure surrounded by students in a marketplace, apparently recruiting for the merchant house. Witnesses remembered him clearly—not only was his face concealed, but his sleeves revealed a pair of black skeletal hands.

The Dai family members scrutinized the portraits, trying to glean clues, but with their limited insight, the images offered little to go on. Frowning in frustration, they turned as one to Zhu Duiyou, a distinguished disciple of the Jingyang Academy.

The Jingyang Academy ranked second among the Lu Kingdom's top ten academies, just behind the White Deer Academy. With a Nascent Soul grandmaster in residence, it was a formidable force in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world, boasting exceptional faculty and admitting only the most talented.

That Zhu Duiyou, from humble origins, had gained admission through sheer effort spoke volumes about his exceptional intellect.

Dai Budong had witnessed his friend's brilliance firsthand since their childhood together at the Yun River Academy, watching as Zhu Duiyou steadily advanced to the prestigious Jingyang Academy. He knew well the depths of his friend's wisdom.

The only drawback was Zhu Duiyou's lack of combat prowess—he invariably faltered at critical moments, a puzzling flaw.

But as the saying goes, "Gold cannot be pure, and no person is perfect." No one excels in every area, and a true leader knows how to delegate according to each person's strengths.

"The white-robed youth, according to neighbors near his cave dwelling, was likely at the mid or late Foundation Establishment stage. His handsome, refined appearance suggests noble origins, though he seems somewhat familiar..."

"The hooded figure's posture appears loose, his robes draped over him like an afterthought. His hands lack flesh—could he be a demonic cultivator practicing sinister arts?"

Dai Budong voiced the group's collective confusion, but Zhu Duiyou, after prolonged observation, suddenly stiffened.

"Brother Dai, I think I remember. Years ago, when we were summoned by the academy to the demonic sects' headquarters for the final battle between righteousness and demonic forces—do you recall what we encountered?"

Dai Budong froze, memories from over a decade ago surfacing, bringing a twinge of shame.

Back then, fearing the chaos of the frontlines, the two had stayed behind to scavenge the battlefield—a dishonorable act he'd since tried to forget, never speaking of it to avoid tarnishing his reputation. Now, Zhu Duiyou's mention tore open those sealed memories, and something clicked.

Their eyes met as realization dawned, and they exclaimed in unison:

"Wanliu Academy, Bu Peiying!"

They hurriedly reexamined the portrait, comparing it to their memories, focusing on details—the white-robed youth's facial features, the absolute confidence in his eyes, his spirited demeanor, the unique blend of wind's grace and thunder's ferocity in his aura—unmistakable!

Crucially, unlike in their memories, the skull pendant at his waist was missing in the painting.

And the other figure, the hooded one with skeletal hands...

"This..."

Dai Budong's astonishment grew. After over a decade, they'd unexpectedly crossed paths with this man again in Wangyue City.

Back then, he and Zhu Duiyou had found the man deeply enigmatic—arriving on a demonic flying vessel, claiming to hail from some ancient eastern kingdom and the unheard-of Wanliu Academy, his masterful acting, his pure wind and thunder spiritual power, accompanied by a skeleton adept at formations...

It had all been shrouded in mystery, their brief encounter leaving them with more questions than answers, a tale so bizarre Dai Budong had dismissed it as fantasy.

But Zhu Duiyou had pursued the matter, discovering that "Bu Peiying" had later appeared at another battle site, competing for fragments of the Black Lotus Buddha Statue. When surrounded by Confucian cultivators, he'd claimed to be the Bear Mountain Master, disciple of the Nascent Soul grandmaster Pure Lotus居士.

Five years prior, during tumultuous times in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world, the True Knowledge Academy and the Flowing Cloud Merchant House had invented the revolutionary "Dandelion" artifact—a media tool with a transmission range exceeding ten thousand miles, intended for mass distribution across the cultivation world.

Their ambition exposed, numerous factions had stormed their headquarters in disguise. The ensuing battle had been cataclysmic, with over a dozen Nascent Soul elders fighting fiercely over the "Dandelion" artifact and its inventor, Ma Wentong, reshaping mountains and rivers in the process.

Ultimately, the "Dandelion" had fallen into the hands of a lone stranger whose manifestation was a three-foot green lotus. According to intelligence from major factions, this figure had briefly appeared in the Lu Kingdom three hundred years prior, his name faintly remembered by older generations as...

Pure Lotus居士!

Zhu Duiyou, having studied at the Jingyang Academy and befriended several intelligence officers, had learned of this during a drinking gathering. After the battle, Pure Lotus居士 had been pursued by over a dozen Confucian experts, with numerous rarely seen rogue cultivators joining the chase, hounding him all the way to the distant Piro Desert in the west...

Such figures were far beyond Zhu Duiyou's reach, so he hadn't delved deeper.

Yet now, the disciple of this legendary figure had appeared before them.

"Bear Mountain Master... Pure Lotus居士..."

Wisdom glinted in Zhu Duiyou's eyes as he clasped his hands behind his back and walked to the window, gazing at the distant horizon where white clouds drifted over ink-wash mountain silhouettes, his thoughts wandering far away.

The Dai family members watched his back in respectful silence.

...

Meanwhile, outside Wangyue City's southern gate, a burly man with a thick beard arrived, dusty from his long journey spanning hundreds of thousands of miles as he trailed someone. Muttering to himself, he complained, "Shifu really... promised to bring me from the Great Song to the Lu Kingdom, then abandoned me halfway. Took me years to get here..."

The city guards stopped him for registration.

"Halt. Name."

The bearded man, marveling at the majestic immortal city, reminded himself to shed his former bandit manners in this Confucian land. Awkwardly, he clasped his hands in salute and even gave an exaggerated bow.

"Esteemed brother, this humble one is the Bear Mountain Master. Greetings."
