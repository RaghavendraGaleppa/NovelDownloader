# Chapter 39: The Ancient Great Emperor Who Lived a Second Life  

These words sent a chill down Dou Changsheng's spine.  

Trust between people was truly nonexistent.  

Of course, this was only natural. He and Tang Qingyan had only met twice—to claim they had absolute trust in each other would be pure self-deception.  

If Tang Qingyan had acted as though she confided in him completely, that would have been suspicious, proving she harbored ulterior motives. The fact that she questioned him now instead showed she had a clear conscience. She spoke her mind without reservation—a person of utmost sincerity.  

But was this her true nature?  

What Qingyang Daoist had done left Dou Changsheng in despair, making him question life itself.  

And it was his own fault—why had he wandered around aimlessly in the middle of the night?  

Tang Qingyan sighed as she watched Dou Changsheng's silence. "I do believe in you, Changsheng."  

"But the world won't."  

"Still, there are benefits. With the protection of the Nine-Heaven Cloud Crane and the deterrence of the Three-Yang Divine Monarch, the stronger they are, the more cautious they'll be—after all, they have much to lose."  

"But the younger generation is different. If you were truly killed by your peers, the Nine-Heaven Cloud Crane wouldn't say much about it."  

"After all, you were removed from the family registry and changed your surname."  

"But those are the decent ones. The demonic sect scoundrels and outlaws of the martial world have no such restraints."  

"They are lawless, committing every evil deed imaginable, and wouldn't hesitate to add one more pursuer to their list."  

"You really shouldn't have come to Three-Yang Mountain."  

Tang Qingyan looked at Qingyang Daoist's corpse and remarked, "This man was ruthless."  

"A Pure Yin Grandmaster could detach his soul from his body and seize another for rebirth."  

"But I've confirmed it—his divine essence is dissipating, proving that even if Qingyang Daoist was a Pure Yin Grandmaster, he is now undeniably dead."  

"I've met Qingyang Daoist before. His divine essence was unique—there's no mistaking it. There's no chance he faked his death to escape."  

"Talking more won't help. No one will come knocking to interrogate us now. We'll just have to take things one step at a time."  

"Most people still care about appearances—it's the demonic sect we need to watch out for."  

"This is the Rebirth Mystic Water."  

Tang Qingyan gazed at the exquisite porcelain bottle, its faint glow seeping through the material. A trace of desire and greed flickered in her eyes before she suppressed it.  

She lowered her head, watching her dress flutter in the wind, a bitter smile forming on her lips as a hint of sorrow crossed her face.  

To revive the dead, to regrow flesh from bones—the Rebirth Mystic Water was a treasure of heaven and earth.  

Especially since it was artificially created. The Three-Yang Divine Monarch was truly a legend.  

---  

The diluted remnants of the Qingyang Spring, released annually, were still fiercely sought after by the world, hailed as a sacred healing item for protecting the heart meridian.  

But unfortunately, as miraculous as it was, it couldn't cure her disability.  

This was a curse—the price of reading the Earth Scripture.  

The Earth Scripture encompassed all things—mountains, medicine, fate, divination, and physiognomy—a wondrous text of heaven and earth.  

Those who had read it throughout history had each mastered one of its arts to perfection.  

But the consequences were severe. Some severed all emotions, others saw their families wiped out. Losing her legs was the price she paid for restraining her greed and not reading the most profound sections.  

Tang Qingyan said calmly, "You won't be able to keep this Rebirth Mystic Water."  

"With the Three-Yang Divine Monarch's legacy still uncertain, people will hesitate. But a single vial of Rebirth Mystic Water is enough to drive them to desperate measures."  

"After all, in the martial world, who can guarantee they'll never be injured? Lingering wounds that hinder progress, children born with missing limbs or congenital defects—these will drive them to madness."  

Dou Changsheng suddenly asked, "Is the Rebirth Mystic Water really that miraculous?"  

"A treasure of heaven and earth, a sacred healing item."  

"Reviving the dead, regrowing flesh from bones—is that true?"  

Tang Qingyan replied firmly, "Absolutely!"  

"This vial of Rebirth Mystic Water, with its glow penetrating the bottle, proves it wasn't refined by Qingyang Daoist but by the Three-Yang Divine Monarch himself."  

"The Three-Yang Divine Monarch has long vanished. This might be the only Rebirth Mystic Water left in the world."  

"No one could surpass the Three-Yang Divine Monarch in refining this art."  

Dou Changsheng exclaimed, "Good!"  

"I'm not afraid of the Rebirth Mystic Water being too powerful."  

"I'm afraid it wouldn't be powerful enough."  

He looked down at Qingyang Daoist's corpse, feeling no greed for such a treasure.  

He had only just begun his cultivation journey, yet he could already defeat a Five Qi Convergence innate realm martial artist. Given time and the Millennium Earth Pearl, he was confident of reaching the Earth Ranking, if not the Heaven Ranking.  

This was the confidence of a transmigrator.  

The Rebirth Mystic Water before him was useless—not a boon, but a source of calamity.  

What he needed was peaceful growth, not bloody battles.  

Dou Changsheng asked again, "Has Qingyang Daoist's divine essence completely dissipated?"  

Tang Qingyan replied, "Not yet."  

"The dissipation of divine essence takes time."  

"After all, he ended himself—it wasn't destroyed by external force."  

Before she could finish, realization dawned on her. "You—"  

Before she could say more, Dou Changsheng had already acted. He bent down, pried open Qingyang Daoist's mouth, and poured the contents of the bottle into it, shaking it vigorously.  

Glug, glug, glug!  

He didn't care about the Rebirth Mystic Water's value.  

Since he couldn't keep it anyway, rather than letting it fall into someone else's hands, he might as well use it.  

Could it really revive the dead?  

Here was a dead man—perfect for testing its efficacy.  

Was it legend or reality?  

Dou Changsheng stared intently at Qingyang Daoist, as did Tang Qingyan. This was a sight she had never seen before. Given the Rebirth Mystic Water's rarity, who would waste it on a corpse?  

The idea of reviving the dead was just a rumor—something to be taken lightly. Who would believe it?  

She never expected someone would actually do this.  

Qingyang Daoist's cold corpse suddenly emitted a heartbeat. Tang Qingyan's ears twitched, her eyes widening in shock as she pressed a hand to his chest.  

"Reviving the dead isn't a myth."  

"A recently deceased person can truly be brought back."  

Then she realized something and sneered at the corpse. "So you were planning to fake your death and escape!"  

"What a pity."  

"You woke up here instead."  

Dou Changsheng clasped his hands behind his back, watching as Qingyang Daoist slowly opened his eyes. He congratulated him with a smile:  

"Senior has lived a second life."  

"Comparable to the ancient great emperors."  

"Congratulations!"  

"Now, about that accusation you made against the emperor for embezzling military funds—how shall we settle that?"
