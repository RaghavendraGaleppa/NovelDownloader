# Chapter 247: Seventy-Two Transformations, the Cry of the Flood Dragon!

"So, this is basically a diary about abstaining from lust."

Li Mo flipped through most of the diary but didn't find anything decent.

Just as he shook his head and prepared to stuff the diary back...

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Murong Xiao,' helping him wake up early.】

【Investment Feedback: Flood Dragon Essence Blood.】

【Flood Dragon Essence Blood】: "Heart essence blood of a Grade 5 Flood Dragon. Can assist in cultivation and strengthen the physique. However, the demonic nature within is violent; handle with care."

"He's awake?"

Little Li was stunned for a moment.

He looked up and saw that Murong Xiao's eyes were still tightly shut, resembling a lifeless stone Buddha statue.

Well, at a glance, he really didn't seem awake.

If you ignored the sweat covering his head...

"Forget it, I won't read this diary anymore."

"I'll just ask Murong brother when he wakes up."

Li Mo silently stuffed the diary back into Murong Xiao's怀里 (bosom).

Then, shaking his head, he walked to the back courtyard.

"Hoo..."

The stone Buddha let out a barely perceptible sigh of relief.

.......

"Murong brother will probably need a bit more time."

In the back courtyard, Li Mo didn't waste this time.

He took out the *Painting of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao*, let his intent soul sink, and quietly observed it.

Within his Dantian, the Stone Monkey divine patterns on the small figure flashed birth and death, linking his intent soul to the Divine Painting. The complex divine energy within rushed into his mind, all containing the inheritance of the painting's divine abilities.

"It's still a bit difficult to comprehend it all right now."

Various divine abilities flashed through his heart.

Li Mo still felt that a large portion of the content was incomprehensible.

He truly wondered what the scene would be like when this painting evolved into a Great Dao Divine Form.

A Great Dao Divine Form requires the Gilded Creation Seal.

But when it comes to the Gilded Creation Seal...

"Focus. Observing the divine intent requires absolute focus."

Li Mo took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.

However...

A moment later.

"Ice Cube, release your intent..."

Li Mo closed his eyes, but before he could finish speaking, he froze.

The Ice Cube had helped him a lot in cultivation.

Not just that time breaking through the realm, but later during dual cultivation, she also guided him in learning many窍门 (nifty tricks) of the Divine Observation Realm.

She was truly teaching him hand-in-hand.

Sometimes, when he got carried away with wild, irrelevant ideas that annoyed her, she would give him a beautiful, exasperated roll of her eyes.

Little Li opened his eyes a crack and glanced at the red thread on his wrist.

It was empty...

The thought had just arisen when he suddenly felt a stir from within the World Seed.

The Great Yin rose, its clear brilliance shining everywhere, enveloping him with gentle tranquility, as if bringing a whisper in the wind.

It seemed to be telling him to focus on his cultivation.

And the Stone Monkey divine pattern on the small figure was also illuminated at this moment, making the faint connection with the Divine Painting reach its peak.

It was just like when he was dual cultivating with her.

The bright moon was still there, as if she had never left.

"Earthly Fiend... Seventy-Two Transformations..."

At this moment, Li Mo's mind was clear. Even the somewhat vague inheritances gradually became distinct and clear.

Wherever the moonlight reached, spiritual light filled the ground.

After a moment of daze, he quickly focused his mind and placed all his attention on the Divine Painting.

In the ethereal void.

A mischievous, Dao-robed monkey emerged from the Divine Painting.

It radiated spiritual light, and the acupoints and vital energies within its body were illuminated by the moonlight, flowing along specific trajectories.

Suddenly, the Dao-robed monkey stepped forward and shook its body.

In an instant, it transformed into a Spiked Back Turtle, looking full of ferocity.

From bloodline, aura, to appearance, it was identical to a true strange beast!

It was even more realistic than Yin Mianmian's Demon Illusion!

It could even be said that this was real!

Then, its form shifted again.

Black-striped Tiger... Howling Moon Wolf... Winged Snake... Grey Eagle...

Various birds and beasts, all kinds of transformations flashed clearly through Li Mo's heart.

"To transform into something, one must understand it thoroughly."

"From the power within the bloodline to its divine charm..."

The transformations he had just seen were all things he was very familiar with.

After all, he had eaten quite a few...

At this moment.

"Brother Li?"

Murong Xiao's inquiring voice sounded by his ear.

"Brother Murong, you're awake! I thought you would need a bit more time!"

---

Li Mo opened his eyes, his face full of surprise.

Murong Xiao's face was flushed red as he nodded awkwardly.

Having a performative personality is convenient. See, he avoided another awkward situation.

"Brother Murong, a great master chanted scriptures for you. You should have woken up so quickly because of that. Do you feel any discomfort?"

"None."

Murong Xiao shook his head:

"I feel the bloodline within my body is suppressed by a Buddhist nature, and now a balance has been achieved."

He said, clenching his fist:

"I will definitely succeed in abstaining from lust today!"

"......"

Li Mo suspected that he had just failed once.

Otherwise, why would he be speaking so confidently now?

Actually, it's not entirely Murong Xiao's fault. It's said that among the Flood Dragon clan, the作风 (style/conduct) of males is quite... indescribable; their desires are naturally stronger, while females are loyal for life.

Thus, male flood dragons are often unsatisfied and go around spreading their seed.

They have made outstanding contributions to the diversity of the demon species...

"By the way, Brother Murong, why did you suddenly decide to visit relatives in the Southern Frontier?"

"It's a long story."

Murong Xiao rubbed his bald head and said:

"My parents suddenly sent a letter, saying that a divine miracle will appear in the Southern Frontier, a heaven-defying opportunity..."

It turned out that not long ago, the great clans of the Southern Frontier's demon beasts all received a message.

A divine miracle would appear in the Southern Frontier.

Here, 'divine' refers to a Demon God, a legendary demon existence that broke through the Ninth Realm.

It is unknown whether there were ever demons who broke through the Ninth Realm.

But once a divine miracle descends, the demons who receive the divine blessing will see a great increase in their bloodline power, even reaching the level of ancestral return.

"Summoning Demon Sect... Divine Son... Divine Miracle..."

"Jade Phoenix God?"

Little Li muttered to himself, his mind working.

He remembered the meteor that descended towards the Southern Frontier, and the information he saw on the Ice Cube using the Destiny Divine Eye.

Is it possible?

The Jade Phoenix God is that so-called divine miracle?

Obtaining the Jade Phoenix God = The Ice Cube becomes powerful.

Strong strength = Peace and happiness, quiet and good years.

He couldn't help but recall the gentle, watery look in the Ice Cube's eyes when she said she would pick up the meteor he had wished for.

"So that's it... It's probably like that..."

Little Li understood. Sitting at the stone table, his expression became thoughtful.

So, that statement wasn't a joke.

Her tone was so light, yet so heavy.

Li Mo let out a breath and asked:

"Brother Murong, can you currently mobilize the bloodline power within your body autonomously?"

"Of course I can. Do you want to see, Brother Li?"

Murong Xiao nodded.

Before he finished speaking, his voice became coarse.

A faint blood color appeared in his eyes, and then蛟鳞 (flood dragon scales) faintly emerged on his skin, covering from his neck down to his chin. His palms became sharp, and webbing faintly appeared between his fingers.

The monk's robe on his body was pushed up; he must have grown other Flood Dragon features.

More importantly, a Flood Dragon shadow loomed behind him, seemingly letting out a roar.

It carried a bit of the imposing manner of the Divine Observation's divine intent.

From this, it seems that the Flood Dragon bloodline in Murong Xiao's body is stronger than his own cultivation realm. If not for practicing Buddhism, he probably wouldn't be able to suppress it by now.

"Brother Li, it's very difficult for me to maintain my sanity. Do you want to..." Murong Xiao said with difficulty.

"Hold on!"

A jade bottle appeared in Li Mo's hand, and he directly swallowed the liquid inside.

Flood Dragon Essence Blood.

"Brother Li, you..." Murong Xiao's eyes widened.

Li Mo, however, stared intently at Murong Xiao and the Flood Dragon shadow behind him.

The various characteristics, movements, bloodline aura, and divine charm of the Flood Dragon flowed through his heart.

The ferocity in the demon blood constantly washed over his nerves.

Fortunately, the加持 (blessing) of the Great Yin's clear brilliance prevented it from having too great an influence on him.

Li Mo's heart gradually formed the image of a Flood Dragon.

He tried to merge it with himself...

*Whoosh!*

His form twisted and suddenly transformed!

"Huh?"

Murong Xiao watched the 'big live person change' before him, his expression gradually falling into a daze.

What the heck?!

.....

PS: The story of Little Li and the Ice Cube certainly isn't limited to the Qingyuan Sect.

The two of them will have grand scenes in the future, many grand scenes. These are things the little author has thought about for a long time, and they are the embodiment of the emotions I've always wanted to write.

However, before that, the characters need to grow. Little Li retains his youthful heart, but he cannot always be a boy who never grows up.

The map also needs to be expanded to provide a stage for different stories and emotional changes.

Thank you to the readers who have read this far, for being willing to tolerate this little author who writes eight hundred characters an hour. I'm so touched, mwah.

Please charge and support me, orz.
