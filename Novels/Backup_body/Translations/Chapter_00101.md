# Chapter 101: The Illustrious Li Zhengjing!

The atmosphere in the Jian'an Marquis's residence in the capital was suffocatingly tense.

"I heard the way they addressed each other as father and son," General Fang Yin said solemnly. "The eldest son of Marquis Jian'an is named Li Pu, and this young man is called Li Erpu. Don't you find that suspicious?"

The young Daoist turned around calmly and replied, "Li Zhengjing bears a striking resemblance to the deceased second son of the Jian'an Marquis's household. Given their similar names and the fact that he has now come to the Marquis's residence to acknowledge the Marquis as his adoptive father, what exactly is the problem here?"

He continued nonchalantly, "When the disturbance occurred in the imperial prison, the Grand Preceptor used the Mystic Mirror of the Hall to observe the situation. He saw Li Zhengjing rescuing the prison guards. Since the cell was already breached, sending Li Pu back can hardly be considered a prison break. These are the Grand Preceptor's words—what issue do you take with them?"

"None. But putting aside the crime of deceiving the emperor, Li Pu is implicated in the massacre of Guo Xinnu's entire family. The evidence is irrefutable—it's a case personally overseen by His Majesty," General Fang Yin countered. "Shouldn't Li Pu at least be handed over?"

The young Daoist bowed slightly. "The culprit, Li Yun, has already confessed. This matter was a personal feud between him and Guo Xinnu, unrelated to Li Pu. He merely used Li Pu's name to mitigate his own crimes in hopes of sparing his wretched life. Li Yun has already been sent to the imperial prison. This matter ends here."

General Fang Yin's gaze turned icy. "How will the Grand Preceptor explain this to His Majesty?"

"The Grand Preceptor has already entered the palace for an audience with His Majesty. He will provide his own explanation," the young Daoist replied evenly.

With a nod, General Fang Yin withdrew his troops and left.

Yet in his heart, he thought, *With the new dynasty on the horizon, has the Grand Preceptor grown so powerful that he can freely release even those His Majesty has condemned to death, trampling over the law?*

Inside the Jian'an Marquis's residence, the young Daoist turned to Li Zhengjing with a smile.

"That old fool Guo Xinnu was mediocre in learning, devoid of any achievements, yet held a high position in the Ministry of Justice. He was nothing but a parasite in the court, a despicable wretch who deserved death. I've long wanted to kill him myself."

The young Daoist looked at Li Zhengjing. "Second Young Master, you've cultivated for less than a year yet possess such formidable abilities—coming and going freely even in the imperial prison. Truly, you are a prodigy. The Grand Preceptor holds you in high regard."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page in his hand before smiling. "Please convey my gratitude to the Grand Preceptor."

The young Daoist took half a step closer. "The Third Prince has secured his position. Cultivators from all sides are gathering here, offering their skills to the imperial family in exchange for a bright future. But the Grand Preceptor has an even more promising path for you. You could become the highest-ranking official in the Jian'an Marquis's lineage for generations!"

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "So you're asking me to pledge allegiance to the Grand Preceptor?"

The young Daoist shook his head slightly. "Initially, the Grand Preceptor did consider taking you under his wing, nurturing you to become a Human Immortal. But after witnessing your battle in the imperial prison through the Mystic Mirror of the Hall, he saw that you already possess the combat prowess of a Human Immortal."

He looked at Li Zhengjing solemnly. "The Grand Preceptor is willing to accept you as his junior brother under their shared master."

He handed over a booklet. "The world believes that only immortal sects possess methods to cultivate to the Human Immortal realm—even the Great Zhou Dynasty has hit a wall here. But in truth, the imperial family does possess a direct path to Human Immortality, though it's a closely guarded secret. Among the court's limited collection of Human Immortal cultivation methods, one belongs to the Grand Preceptor's residence."

His expression turned grave. "Three generations of the first Grand Preceptor's lineage all achieved Human Immortality, establishing their own legacy. The current Grand Preceptor inherited the first Grand Preceptor's teachings and obtained this inheritance. The power of a Human Immortal in our lineage is self-cultivated, not bestowed by the dynasty's fortune!"

The world assumed the Grand Preceptor's strength stemmed solely from the dynasty's fortune. In truth, the Grand Preceptor was already a peak Human Immortal—augmented further by the Great Zhou's fortune.

"And what does this technique entail?" Li Zhengjing asked coolly, not accepting the booklet. "By taking it, do I become the first Grand Preceptor's disciple?"

"No," the young Daoist replied. "This is a Daoist art from our lineage. We merely wish to show you that our techniques, arts, and abilities are no inferior to the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's. Consider this a gift—a token of sincerity."

He met Li Zhengjing's gaze. "You may study this art. Whether you later choose to become the Grand Preceptor's junior brother is entirely up to you. He will not force you. However, the Grand Preceptor does have one request..."

"A request?" Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow.

"His Majesty's lifespan is nearing its end. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the Third Prince will likely become the new Crown Prince—and the next emperor of Great Zhou," the young Daoist explained.

"During the recent upheaval in the capital, the Crown Prince perished, and the princes turned on each other. Though the conflict didn't escalate to the Human Immortal level, too many experts at the True Qi and Internal Breath realms were lost in the infighting. Thus, the court needs to recruit capable individuals to bolster the new dynasty's foundation."

"What does this have to do with me?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"Your reputation is unparalleled—slaying the Venom King Xin Xuan, defeating Lu Huaiyuan, fleeing the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect under accusation. Your fame shakes the world, rivaling even the Young Master of Kunlun," the young Daoist said.

"Now that the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect has temporarily cleared your name, you're effectively innocent. Yet since you haven't returned to the sect, you can participate in this capital gathering as an independent cultivator—setting an example."

He smiled. "With talents as prodigious as Li Zhengjing's, whose prowess is second only to Human Immortals, even deigning to attend this gathering and serve the court—wouldn't that inspire hesitant cultivators across the land to pledge their allegiance?"

"That's all?"

"That's all."

"Very well."

Li Zhengjing took the booklet and saw the young Daoist out.

Watching the Daoist depart, Li Zhengjing checked the fortune on his golden page.

Marquis Jian'an approached, whispering, "The Grand Preceptor is cunning. This gathering likely has ulterior motives. Using you as an exemplar is probably just a facade."

Li Zhengjing smiled. "I'm aware, Father. The Grand Preceptor wants to use me for his own ends."

He looked up at the sky. "The Grand Preceptor chose me because, at this moment, no one in the capital is more suitable than I am. Even if I refused him today, the Jian'an Marquis's residence wouldn't know peace in the days to come."

The Grand Preceptor sought to use Li Zhengjing for his plans, while Li Zhengjing, in turn, needed the Grand Preceptor's influence in the capital.

For now, their interests aligned.

Regardless, the Grand Preceptor had resolved the crisis at the Marquis's residence today, bestowed a technique, and shown ample sincerity. More importantly, the golden page indicated no immediate danger!

Soon after, Jia Shifang arrived through the back gate with the dragon girl, a bird, a tree, and an insect in tow.

Having weathered grief and joy, Marquis Jian'an and his wife were overjoyed to see the little girl, treating her like a granddaughter—plying her with sweets and pastries, showering her with affection.

For the next two days, the Jian'an Marquis's household enjoyed a warm reunion.

Jia Shifang departed to participate in the capital gathering as instructed by the Vajra Temple.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing remained at home, cultivating relentlessly—now having unlocked one hundred and eighty acupoints!

The Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi was renowned as the fastest cultivation method for the True Qi realm.

With ample spirit stones and the golden page's refining capabilities, Li Zhengjing's progress was a hundred times faster than conventional True Qi refinement.

"The Grand Preceptor's art is an ocular technique," Yuan Zhengfeng remarked after studying the booklet. "It's formidable—capable of discerning truth from illusion and even attacking. With this technique, one can kill with a glance. Its power rivals the top-tier arts of immortal sects."

"The Radiant Golden Pupil?" Li Zhengjing mused. "The Grand Preceptor's art is peculiar—it may prove useful during this capital gathering."

"The gathering begins tomorrow," Yuan Zhengfeng noted before pausing abruptly.

Li Zhengjing looked up.

Streaks of light shot toward the capital's outskirts.

Human Immortals were on the move!

He stood. "What could have drawn out the capital's Human Immortals?"

"How did the Venom King Xin Xuan poison the Crown Prince and hide in the capital for half a year when there are so many Human Immortals here?" the wall-perching bird wondered aloud.

"And after half a year, he still found a chance to kill the Crown Prince," the Five Elements Creation Tree added, waving its roots. "The capital is as secure as an immortal sect's mountain gate. Back then, major sects even sent experts to assist in capturing Xin Xuan—yet he still escaped."

"If the immortal sects hadn't sent people to capture Xin Xuan, he probably would've died right here in the capital—never making it to Four-Leaf City in Xuanling Prefecture," Li Zhengjing remarked, thinking of Elder Gu.

He had once suspected Elder Gu was the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.

But later, he learned Elder Gu was the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Elder Supreme—yet remained oblivious to the Divine Lord's presence beside him.

Xin Xuan's escape, ostensibly facilitated by the Debt Lord, might have actually been orchestrated by the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord. Alternatively, Elder Gu might have deliberately let Xin Xuan go to lure out the Debt Lord.

In any case, had the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect not sent reinforcements to capture Xin Xuan, the Venom King would have died in the capital—never reaching Xuanling Prefecture.

By evening, the young Daoist returned.

"News arrived today—the former Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Ancient Moon Peak Master, the current Debt Lord, has appeared in the Southern Wastelands," the young Daoist announced gravely.

"The three major immortal sects, two Buddhist sects, and our Great Zhou's experts have all headed south to besiege him. Additionally, five helmsmen of the Salvation Golden Ship were spotted in the Southern Wastelands."

He continued, "If the Salvation Golden Ship seeks to hunt the Debt Lord, the current Salvation Heavenly Venerable will surely appear. If this southern campaign succeeds, we may eliminate not just the Debt Lord but the Salvation Golden Ship as well."

Li Zhengjing fell silent, thinking of the bronze mirror the Ancient Moon Peak Master had entrusted to him in the phoenix tree box.

To this day, he had yet to receive any message from the Peak Master.

He suddenly turned to the young Daoist. "You seem convinced I know of the Debt Lord's existence?"

"I'm merely relaying the Grand Preceptor's words," the young Daoist replied before adding, "Don't forget about tomorrow's gathering."

As the Daoist turned to leave, Li Zhengjing called out, "Since the Debt Lord has appeared, along with traces of the Salvation Golden Ship, why hasn't the Grand Preceptor—who is empowered by the dynasty's fortune and revered as the strongest in the court—set out?"

The young Daoist sighed. "The Grand Preceptor is bound by the dynasty's fortune. Beyond Great Zhou's borders, he loses its empowerment. Moreover, with so many Human Immortals heading south—including seven from the capital—someone must remain to guard the city."

With that, he departed.

Li Zhengjing cultivated through the night. At dawn, he bathed, dressed meticulously, slung the phoenix tree box over his back, and prepared to leave.

But a weight clung to his leg—the dragon girl had latched onto him, blinking eagerly.

"Want to see the excitement?" Li Zhengjing shook his head. "No. My connection to the Jian'an Marquis's household is no longer secret. Someone needs to guard the residence."

Before he finished, his gaze fell on the little dragon girl's tail.

Once scaled, now a patch was bare.

"You plucked your scales for a protective charm?"

"Mhm."

"Fine."

Resigned, Li Zhengjing took her along.

His late departure meant the capital gathering had already begun by the time they arrived.

The Third Prince stood atop a high platform, delivering an impassioned speech brimming with ambition. Just as Li Zhengjing approached, the speech concluded.

Above the platform, light shimmered, forming an array that materialized nine stairways stretching into the sky.

Each stairway had thirty-three steps.

"That's a pocket realm!" Yuan Zhengfeng whispered. "Successive dynasties chose this as their capital precisely because of this realm's presence—ordinarily, it's forbidden ground!"

An official above bowed solemnly and declared, "The first three stairways correspond to the External Skill, Internal Breath, and True Qi realms!"

He pointed to the remaining six. "These are special—less stringent in cultivation requirements."

"The leftmost stairway contains ten thousand formations per step. Break one to ascend."

"The second stairway holds materials. Refine the required pill to place in each step's indentation to advance."

"The third stairway is similar but for artifacts."

"The fourth is for talismans."

"The fifth suits miscellaneous practitioners—divination, fate calculation, celestial mechanics. Solve the Grand Preceptor's puzzles to ascend."

"The sixth contains phantom imprints of spirit beasts and insects crafted by the Grand Preceptor's formation masters. Subdue and refine them to climb."

He lit an incense stick in a censer.

"Climb thirty-three steps before this incense burns out. Those who enter the pocket realm will receive official positions and rewards!"

The crowd surged forward, but chaos erupted as prideful cultivators refused to yield, unleashing arts, formations, talismans, artifacts, and spirit beasts in their scramble.

The officials remained composed, shielded by the Grand Preceptor's formations.

Then, the commotion at the True Qi realm stairway stilled.

All eyes turned to the base of the steps, where a youth in resplendent robes stood.

A saber hung at his waist, a wooden box on his back.

Wherever he passed, those who recognized him retreated.

"Honestly, queuing would be best," Li Zhengjing remarked mildly. "But since you all insist on rushing ahead—let's rush."

He advanced unopposed.

His aura overwhelmed the True Qi realm cultivators, forcing them back.

Most present knew of his exploits.

Those who didn't recognized the crowd's deference and hesitated.

Lower-realm cultivators—Internal Breath and External Skill practitioners—were less informed, many unfamiliar with the youth.

"Who is he?"

"Haven't you heard? His deeds have shaken the world recently!"

"Li Zhengjing of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect—slayer of the Venom King Xin Xuan, granted the Gold-Trimmed Silver Token at the Internal Breath realm, equal to a true disciple!"

"He defeated Lu Huaiyuan, then fled the sect under accusation. How dare he show his face here?"

"Outdated news. The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect recently cleared his name."

"Then why attend? Has he forsaken the sect for the court?"

Even the court officials, previously unaware, were stunned.

Li Zhengjing climbed steadily until an elderly man blocked his path.

"I am Qian Yejun. In seventy years of cultivation since my master's teachings, I've reached the peak of the True Qi realm and created my own sword art, sweeping the mortal world," the old man declared.

"I dare not claim invincibility, but I've never faced a true disciple of an immortal sect. I wish to witness their vaunted legacy."

He strode forward. "Having fought countless battles, I've heard immortal sect disciples are coddled. I'll let you strike first."

"Gratitude."

Li Zhengjing drew his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, channeling the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi's intent.

The old man raised his sword—and was sent flying, unconscious.

Li Zhengjing had held back, sparing his life.

Silence fell.

Li Zhengjing turned to a True Qi realm youth with three hundred acupoints unlocked. "This is the difference."

The youth, a genius from a minor sect who had prided himself on surpassing immortal sect disciples despite limited resources, stepped back, his confidence shattered.

Li Zhengjing continued upward.

Unopposed.

Thirty-three steps later, he entered the pocket realm.
