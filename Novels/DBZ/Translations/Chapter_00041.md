# Chapter 41: A Teachable Talent Worth Nurturing

This must be my imagination! Wei Qian firmly thought to himself.

Even without him, these events would have occurred. Moreover, because of his involvement, things hadn't worsened—they'd actually improved. Take Li Guchen for example—had Wei Qian not intervened, that boy would have long since met an untimely end. From this perspective, the new family head actually owed him a great deal.

"Right now, there's only one top priority—to improve my own strength as quickly as possible."

This could be approached from two angles: increasing his cultivation level and continuing his physical training. Cultivating both magic and body simultaneously!

Wei Qian set himself a small goal: to reach the sixth level of Qi Refinement in cultivation and break through to the third realm in body refinement. "But both of these will require substantial investments of spirit stones."

Fortunately, this wasn't a major problem for Wei Qian. The spirit stones he'd earned from the Black Wind Ridge battle hadn't been fully spent yet, and during his trip to Danding Immortal City, the two Wang family cultivators had made generous contributions. Their storage bags alone contained 928 spirit stones combined, suddenly increasing Wei Qian's wealth to a staggering 1,728 spirit stones! This didn't even include the magical artifacts, flying boats, and talismans he'd acquired from their storage bags. It was truly a windfall!

Thus, Wei Qian allowed himself some extravagance, commissioning Bai Fugui to purchase Yellow Sprout Pills, Qi-Absorbing Pills, and Energy-Boosting Pills—all types of elixirs that could enhance his magical power. He also bought large quantities of medicinal herbs for the medicinal baths required by the "Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Technique." Wei Qian generously gave Bai Fugui ten spirit stones as a service fee, which immediately motivated him to complete the task with enthusiasm.

In just three days, Bai Fugui had procured everything Wei Qian needed. Once the elixirs and herbs were in hand, Wei Qian embarked on his great undertaking of cultivation through pill consumption! His usual training regimen was already rigorous, but now with ample elixir support, it was like adding wings to a tiger.

After a month, during his routine cultivation, Wei Qian faintly sensed the presence of a bottleneck. Breaking through this barrier would allow him to advance to the sixth level of Qi Refinement!

At the end of the month, Li Wanqing came to inspect the Spirit Peach Garden. When he noticed the significant increase in Wei Qian's magical aura, he asked in surprise, "Is your spiritual root aptitude of the superior grade?"

As soon as the words left his mouth, Li Wanqing realized his mistake. If Wei Qian truly possessed superior-grade spiritual roots, wouldn't joining the Flowing Cloud Sect be far more promising than being a mere tenant farmer for the Li family?

Therefore, Wei Qian's rapid cultivation progress must be due to other factors. Wei Qian had already prepared an explanation for this. "This junior found some suitable elixirs in the storage bags of those two Wang family cultivators and took them."

Li Wanqing nodded and joked, "You truly have good fortune. Even I feel somewhat envious." Then, as if remembering something, he added, "I heard from Wanhai that you exchanged for a medicinal cauldron and wanted to try alchemy? How's that going?"

Being an alchemist himself, Li Wanqing couldn't help but feel inclined to test this junior. "This junior has attempted twenty-eight batches, all producing Qi-Restoring Pills. Now, I can barely break even," Wei Qian truthfully reported the story he'd prepared.

"Oh?" Li Wanqing's gaze finally shifted completely from the spirit peach trees to Wei Qian. "I'm an alchemist myself—don't think you can deceive me."

Li Wanqing said this because if Wei Qian's claim was true, his talent in alchemy would be second only to his own. When he first learned alchemy, he had also practiced with Qi-Restoring Pills, only managing to break even on his twenty-seventh batch—just one attempt better than Wei Qian! If he knew Wei Qian's true aptitude, he might have been shocked out of his wits.

"How would this junior dare to deceive the family head?" Wei Qian replied.

Li Wanqing stroked his chin and made a decision. "Come with me." With that, he turned and headed toward the summit of Mist Ridge Mountain. Wei Qian naturally hurried to follow.

At the Mist Ridge Mountain alchemy room, built atop a first-grade superior spiritual vein where the abundant spiritual energy slightly improved the success rate and quality of pill refinement, Li Wanqing produced three sets of materials for Qi-Restoring Pills from a gemstone ring—the heirloom of the Li family heads, containing important resources that could be accessed without clan meetings. Once worn by Li Wanlong, it now adorned Li Wanqing's hand.

"If your performance satisfies me, I wouldn't mind nurturing you," Li Wanqing said. For a first-grade superior alchemist to offer guidance to a former rogue cultivator was indeed a form of benevolence.

Wei Qian put on an expression of grave determination, took several deep breaths, and said, "I will give my all and not disappoint the family head."

Sitting before the massive cauldron in the alchemy room, Wei Qian waved his hand, generating spiritual flames from his fingertips that transformed into a fiery dragon coiling beneath the cauldron, burning fiercely. Seeing this, Li Wanqing gave an almost imperceptible nod of approval. Regardless of Wei Qian's actual alchemical skill, his flame control technique was already quite impressive.

As time passed, various herbs were successively added to the cauldron, soon melting into medicinal liquids that began the fusion process—a critical step where any mistake could ruin the entire batch. "Hmm, his technique is skilled, and his heat control isn't bad, but the fusion is too slow, and the timing is off," Li Wanqing frowned. Sure enough, a muffled explosion followed—the pills had blown up.

Wei Qian pretended to be flustered as Li Wanqing offered critique: "The timing of the fusion was poorly controlled. The medicinal liquids should have been..." Learning from this, Wei Qian composed himself and began the second attempt.

This time, during the fusion stage, he appeared to panic and nearly failed again, but miraculously salvaged the batch, producing twelve pills—three standard quality and eight inferior. Inferior pills contained less potency and more toxins, but in the cultivation world where not all practitioners could afford standard pills, they still had a market.

By the third attempt, Wei Qian seemed much more proficient, avoiding previous mistakes. This batch was successfully refined with all standard-quality pills. Finally satisfied, Li Wanqing nodded. "This lad has decent alchemical talent, good comprehension, and a bit of luck. He's truly worth nurturing," the Li family head thought to himself.
