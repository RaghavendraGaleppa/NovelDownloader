# Chapter 53: Monkey Play

Zhou Qing boiled water, scalded the snake, and removed its scales. The dark green snake scales had a blade-like sharpness to them, so he kept them aside, thinking they might prove useful for his Finger Flick technique.

Following the medicinal soup recipe recorded in the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual that used snake meat, along with other herbs, he prepared a nourishing medicinal meal. The snake skin was tender and springy, with an excellent texture. He processed the gallbladder separately.

In short, based on the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual's medicinal recipes, Zhou Qing utilized every part of the green snake possible. He also carefully extracted and preserved the venom. The green snake's venom remained unused, while most of the previous dead snake's venom had been expended before Rooster brought this one back.

The green snake resembled a bamboo viper, yet even in death, it retained an indescribable vitality. Zhou Qing had previously tried having hunters catch snakes in the mountains for consumption, but they proved ineffective. Clearly, the snakes Rooster caught were of a special variety.

Zhou Qing shared a small portion with Rooster, who happily devoured it, clearly preferring Zhou Qing's medicinal preparation. Logically, human and chicken tastes should differ. But then again, he wasn't a normal human, and Rooster wasn't a normal chicken—if it even was a chicken at all.

Unbeknownst to Zhou Qing, in Rooster's mind, this was an offering to the Tiger King, and Zhou Qing sharing food with it was a reward. Though something about this logic seemed off, it made sense to the bird.

After finishing the medicinal meal, Zhou Qing soon felt heat spreading through his body. He began practicing Monkey Play. His progress was noticeably faster this time. Having endured the hardships of Monkey Play training before, he'd never imagined it could feel so effortless—like pressing an acceleration button in a game.

He became increasingly absorbed, with his Monkey Play proficiency steadily rising until it reached a point like water hitting a dam—the bottleneck to the next level.

Zhou Qing tirelessly trained, repeatedly charging against this barrier. The characters representing his initial-stage Literary Mind began to fade as cracks appeared in the metaphorical dam.

With a resounding crash, the dam shattered. Zhou Qing felt his heart pounding violently, even faintly hearing the sound of blood rushing through his veins. Soon, his thoughts returned to reality, and his heartbeat became slower yet stronger than before.

Monkey Play (Proficient).

Zhou Qing exhaled a long breath of white mist that remained remarkably condensed, only dissipating after traveling several meters. While exhaling visible breath was normal in the chilly weather, such density demonstrated his physical constitution had ascended to a new level.

"Cloud-Swallowing Mist-Spitting," Zhou Qing recalled a phenomenon mentioned in the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual. He had likely reached this stage, indicating his vigorous qi and blood, and astonishing physical condition.

Attempting Monkey Play again, he found the difficulty had doubled compared to the previous stage from Novice to Proficient. The snake meat's effects had worn off. Still, Rooster had rendered great service by helping him save considerable time. Though he had steeled his determination to endure Monkey Play's hardships, avoiding them was naturally preferable.

It was time to return to the mountains. Zhou Qing felt that advancing Monkey Play from Proficient to Mastery required greater spiritual insight. First, he wanted to observe real monkeys in their habitat. Second, he sensed mountain training would enhance his progress. Third, he needed to practice actual climbing for future herb gathering. Additionally, he hadn't yet shown Senior Brother the insights about the Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm from Xiao Ruowang's letter.

He seemed to have forgotten something—ah, the Heart-Nourishing Pill. He had originally planned to use it at a crucial moment to boost Monkey Play training. That time had come.

Dressed in his fireproof clothing and equipped with climbing claws, a hand crossbow, sword, and other essential survival items—all capable of killing or saving lives—Zhou Qing set out. He trusted Jiangzhou's public security but trusted his sword more. Rooster accompanied him, clearly no stranger to mountain excursions.

The mountains were colder than the city but offered fresher air. Yet practicing under the great mulberry tree's shade invigorated Zhou Qing's spirit more. Both locations had their merits. He almost wished the mulberry tree could walk so he could move it to Qingfu Temple—though the thought of a walking tree was unsettling.

At Qingfu Temple, Zhishan came to greet them. A simple and honest man, he tirelessly traveled between mountain and city without complaint. Zhou Qing knew Zhishan was the temple's most reliable member. If Fushong saw Rooster, he'd sarcastically remark about "Little Brother bringing meat"—this supposedly abstinent monk would eat any meat without restraint.

Zhishan had seen Rooster several times and knew it was the young master's pet. As a practicing Daoist, he vaguely sensed Rooster's spiritual nature, though keeping a spiritual chicken wasn't particularly remarkable. A disciple of the previous dynasty's Jingyang Zhenren had kept a tiger, and Buddhist monks were known for taming lions and elephants.

In the plaza, Zhou Qing heard two pieces of gossip from Xiao Ruowang's letter. First, Provincial Scholar Tang had been implicated in an imperial examination cheating scandal, losing his scholarly rank and subsequently marrying eight concubines in a lavish, dissipated lifestyle. Xiao lamented the waste of Tang's family-inherited Overlord Spear technique. Second, Grand Secretary Shang, a triple first-place examination graduate now retired at seventy, returned home with the rare honor of Grand Preceptor—a title usually awarded posthumously. His return shook the entire Xijiang Province.

Xiao proudly mentioned that Shang might attend his upcoming ordination ceremony, subtly hinting at his own status to Zhou Qing. The letter included pine needles from Taishan Mountain's ancient Guest-Greeting Pine, reputedly mystical. Zhou Qing replied, promising to attend while resolving to master Palm Lightning by year's end.

"Health Lord, give me strength!" Zhou Qing urged. "Monkey Play—break through!" The Literary Mind's characters shattered as he overcame the bottleneck to Mastery.

Despite turbulent times, scholarly status benefited temple disciples. They studied texts under Zhou Qing while practicing talisman techniques from Zhishan and others. The once-quiet Qingfu Temple grew lively. Those unsuccessful in studies could join the Black Tiger Gang, actually a rice trade group that flourished in chaotic times under Zhou Qing's ethical guidelines.

Pleased with the temple's growth, Fushong regarded Zhou Qing favorably—his greatest achievement for Qingfu Temple. In turn, Fushong considered himself Elder Brother Fushan's greatest achievement for sustaining the temple's hundred bamboo houses.

"Why don't you take a disciple to teach your Taiyue True Form Talisman Manual?" Zhou Qing once asked Fushong.

"Think it's easier than Rejuvenation Talisman?" Fushong retorted.

Zhou Qing coughed, "But Rejuvenation isn't that hard."

Fushong fell silent—he couldn't refute Zhou Qing's talent. Though Zhou Qing modestly claimed to focus little on Rejuvenation, remaining at Novice level nearing Proficient, his medical skills steadily improved, having treated several martial artists whose cases enhanced his combat understanding.

"Taiyue requires exceptional talent," Fushong finally said. "I plan to teach you after you master Rejuvenation. Others aren't worthy."

"Thank you, Elder Brother."

"If you take until twenty-seven or eight to master Rejuvenation, I won't teach you."

"Elder Brother, I'm not yet seventeen. Rejuvenation isn't so difficult—I'll master it before twenty, then Taiyue in two or three years. Plenty of time!"

Wounded by Zhou Qing's confidence, Fushong conceded, "Your talent rivals Jingyang Zhenren's. Work hard," before leaving, his good mood spoiled.

Mention of Jingyang Zhenren made Zhou Qing muse, "First goal: outlive Jingyang Zhenren." The path to longevity required patience, yet he felt new urgency.

At the back mountain, Zhou Qing climbed steep cliffs he had mapped, with a ten-zhang platform below preventing deadly falls. Rooster could summon help if needed. The fireproof clothing provided extra resistance during falls, allowing slight gliding with lightness skill—crucial for herb gathering when combined with climbing claws to access rare medicinal plants like potential seven-leaf ginseng in inaccessible locations.

Monkey Play improved through climbing. Observing white monkeys' movements from afar, Zhou Qing studied their forms to comprehend their essence—seeing the shape, grasping the meaning, generating the spirit.

By autumn, Zhou Qing had encountered five sudden difficulty spikes in Monkey Play training. Using Heart-Nourishing Pills for three and sheer will for two, he now stood one step from Mastery. Another letter arrived from Xiao Ruowang, announcing his fourth ordination next spring at twenty-nine, cementing his position as Taishan Mountain's undisputed successor, with dignitaries attending. He reiterated the Tang and Shang gossip, lamenting Tang's wasted potential.
