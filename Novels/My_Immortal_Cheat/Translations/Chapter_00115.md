Chapter 115: Two Handsome Men

Mu Su quietly watched the two actors put on a dramatic performance here. For such a woman to appear in the Myriad Gods Mountain Range clearly indicated a trap. He wondered what Zhou Tian was thinking, playing along with her, pretending to be warm-hearted and sincere.

"May I ask Miss Ling Yu's age?"

The group of three walked in the direction Ling Yu indicated, and Zhou Tian opened his mouth to ask.

Ling Yu maintained a safe distance from Zhou Tian. Hearing his question, she couldn't help but feel secretly pleased. No one could ignore her unparalleled charm. She said in a soft, low voice, "I am 18 years old this year."

"A verdant age. Miss Ling Yu is so beautiful, may I ask if you have a male... a more intimate male friend?" Zhou Tian nodded and then asked.

"Not yet." Ling Yu felt even more triumphant, but her expression remained unchanged.

"Oh, that's great!" A smile appeared on Zhou Tian's face. He slapped Mu Su beside him. "Miss Ling Yu, what do you think of my younger brother? Although he seems a bit slow and dull, he's handsome and highly talented. And he's about to become a god! Making a move now would be a surefire profit!"

Suddenly dragged into the conversation, Mu Su glared fiercely at Zhou Tian, then spoke to Ling Yu with a slight apology, "Miss, please don't mind him. My... my brother's thoughts tend to run wild. He was just joking; please don't take it to heart."

Ling Yu forced a strained smile, indicating she didn't mind, but her internal thoughts were extremely rich: *What's the meaning of explaining so urgently? Do you look down on me?*

Zhou Tian, on the other hand, looked indignant. "Little brother, what do you mean by that? You look down on Miss Ling Yu? Even if she's a bit on the plump side and her brain is a little small, she's beautiful! Aren't you pursuing justice? Haven't you heard of 'looks are justice'? This is the justice you're pursuing!"

Mu Su turned his head away, not wanting to say a word, completely ignoring Zhou Tian, who seemed possessed by a drama queen.

Ling Yu stared intently at Zhou Tian, her chest heaving. She had finally realized that Zhou Tian was subtly mocking her.

"Since you've already seen through it, why bother playing along with me?" A flash of purple light emanated from Ling Yu's body. Her previously ragged, revealing clothes instantly became whole. Her eyes turned purple, and her entire being exuded an alluring sensation, possessing a decadent beauty.

"Dark God of Gugula, Little Fairy transforms completely?" Zhou Tian attempted to try a secret code.

"Don't change the subject!" Ling Yu had completely shed her previous fragile demeanor. Like a queen, a cold glint flashed in her eyes. Light shimmered in her hand, and a purple energy whip violently struck a nearby tree.

With a crisp crack, the ancient tree snapped and collapsed, sending dust flying.

"Since you want to play with us, we'll play with you then. Who would have thought your psychological endurance was so poor?" Zhou Tian also returned to his normal state, speaking in an unconcerned tone.

"What is your relationship with the Ashen Cult?" Ling Yu asked coldly. She had just remembered that some time ago, the Ashen Cult had extensively publicized that they had found the Divine Son of the Ash God. Many sects had scoffed at this; divine miracles hadn't appeared for years, yet they claimed to have found a Divine Son. That Divine Son's name seemed to be Anduin.

"The Ashen Cult, ah, they're quite a lovable bunch. Much more lovable than the Holy God Sect people, and very trustworthy. Their character is also good. As for the relationship, it was cooperative for a while, but now we're friends." Zhou Tian said, stroking his chin.

Lovable? Ling Yu's mouth twitched. It was the first time she'd heard anyone describe the Ashen Cult as "lovable."

However, hearing the latter half of Zhou Tian's sentence, her heart stirred. "The Holy God Sect? You also have a relationship with the Holy God Sect? Is the chaos in Sela City related to you?"

Zhou Tian smiled helplessly, "Are you trying to gather information now?" He continued, "It's fine to tell you. This little brother beside me just abandoned the Holy God Lord. The chaos in Sela City was orchestrated by him behind the scenes."

*Abandoned the Holy God Lord? Is that even possible?* Ling Yu was impressed by Zhou Tian's unique way of expressing things.

"Now it should be my turn to ask questions, right? What do you really think of my little brother?"

Ling Yu was silent for a moment, then her entire body erupted with energy. The purple soft whip in her hand lashed out, as cunning and flexible as a snake, swift as lightning, striking towards Zhou Tian.

Mu Su frowned slightly. *Attacking my big brother? Did you ask me first?*

The longsword in his hand emitted a dazzling light. He lunged forward, and a brilliant holy light sword qi was unleashed, but it was shattered by the soft whip. The whip flexibly changed direction, directly sending Mu Su, who was trying to rush forward, flying. A wound opened on his chest, and purple energy flowed within the wound, corroding his body.

Mu Su was clearly no match for Ling Yu. Ling Yu had probably reached the Dharma Idol Realm, while Mu Su was at most in the Three Treasures Realm. If Ling Yu hadn't wanted to keep him alive, she could have directly whipped Mu Su to death.

Zhou Tian's brows furrowed slightly. With a wave of his hand, a thick dark wind blade shot directly towards Ling Yu. This was an attack he had just sealed from the creature with twin wings on its back, which he now used.

Ling Yu's expression changed dramatically. Looking at the suddenly appearing wind blade, she felt a fatal threat from it.

These overlords of the Myriad Gods Mountain Range were each comparable to sages, so the power of their attacks was naturally not something Ling Yu could resist.

A burst of purple light shone brightly. Just as the wind blade was about to touch Ling Yu, a shield rose. Where the two made contact, runes shimmered and faded, blocking the wind blade.

When the dust settled, a young woman in a sandy robe appeared in front of Ling Yu. It was she who had emitted the purple shield just now. She bore some resemblance to Ling Yu, a smile on her face, exuding a mature aura.

With a wave of her hand, a purple energy was drawn out from Mu Su's body. A milky white light appeared on the wound on his chest, slowly beginning to heal.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow. *Is she showing goodwill? A married woman truly is a married woman; not only are her breasts larger than Ling Yu's, but her brain is also bigger.*

"Gentlemen, my daughter was a bit presumptuous just now," the woman said softly, her voice as clear as an echo in an empty valley.

*As if you weren't standing by watching just now. When you were bullying us, I didn't see you come out. But seeing that I might be a little formidable, you decide to show up,* Zhou Tian grumbled internally. However, since the other party had softened, and Mu Su was fine, he wanted to see what they were planning.

"That's quite alright. It's just, I wonder why the two of you have designs on us two handsome men?"

The woman's expression was a little strange. She was silent for a moment before speaking, "You two misunderstand. I merely wish to invite you as guests. It's just that my daughter is too playful and caused you to misunderstand."

"Oh, I thought you were going to humiliate us and then kill us." Zhou Tian chuckled apologetically.
