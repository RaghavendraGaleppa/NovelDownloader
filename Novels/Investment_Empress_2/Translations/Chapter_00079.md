# Chapter 79: The Overwhelming Ying Bing, Li Mo's Trump Card, and the Decisive Blow

This was the first time Li Mo had achieved a flash of enlightenment in the Dao of the Sword.

His sword suddenly slowed down.

There was no need for words.

Opposite him, Ying Bing tacitly slowed her offensive as well.

This process lasted only a few seconds.

The next second, when Li Mo struck again, at first glance, the锋芒 (sharpness) of his sword seemed to have weakened much.

Amidst the woven sword lights and flower shadows, the Chixiao Sword was like a残烛 (flickering candle) in the rain, swaying several times but never extinguishing.

Moreover, it grew stronger instead.

However, a hint of relief flashed through Ying Bing's eyes.

He had悟ed (understood).

The momentum of a wildfire burning across the plains lies in its endless vitality, in the waxing and waning of forces.

*Clang, clang, clang—*

The ice-blue and crimson sword lights collided dozens of times in the blink of an eye.

To the onlookers, it seemed that the True Disciple Li was initially suppressed, in danger at every turn yet always able to stand firm, gradually turning weakness into strength, actually managing to stand on equal footing with Ying Bing.

"Did these two start practicing sword arts in the womb?"

"I'm starting to not understand anymore."

"The True Disciple Li's technique looks like the Wildfire Plain-Scorching Sword Art, but not quite..."

The duel between the two had surpassed the understanding of the Nine Sects Tournament for most people. This was not the standard of a rising star.

Gradually, everyone held their breath, eyes fixed on the arena.

The next second.

The momentum of the Chixiao Sword suddenly暴涨 (surged).

Like a wildfire, it tore through the heavy curtain of rain.

A gasp of shock came from the arena.

Is True Disciple Li about to win?

Is the victor to be decided so soon?

But Li Mo knew what was happening. It was because Bing Dui Dui (Ice Cube) was deliberately letting him get familiar with her sword intent that she hadn't changed her move.

This strike would leave ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine out of ten thousand people helpless. The only exception was Ying Bing.

As expected.

*Ding—*

The blade cut through the wind,眼看 (just about) to pierce Ying Bing, but the Tianfrost Sword had already arrived before his eyes.

The tips of the two swords collided with pinpoint precision.

Chixiao, carrying the intent of the wildfire, pressed the Tianfrost until it bent to the extreme.

But Ying Bing's sword intent, like a candle in the wind, did not vanish.

Li Mo felt a chill in his heart.

This scene gave him a sense of déjà vu.

It was too familiar.

In the flash of lightning, he saw the corner of Ying Bing's lips slightly pursed and reacted quickly.

The Wildfire Plain-Scorching Sword Intent!

A sense of crisis welled up in Li Mo's heart. He applied more force, turned his blade, and struck again without any pause or need to recover his breath.

This was the benefit of having thirty-six main meridians in the Blood Qi Realm.

His follow-up strength was endless; he didn't have to worry about his force running out.

*Clang—*

Tianfrost flipped in her fair wrist, the "Seeking Flowers" sword art's "Wind and Rain Dark and Dreary" momentum rose again, intermingled with the endless vitality of the Wildfire Plain-Scorching intent.

One sword, two intents!

The Wildfire Plain-Scorching focused on accumulation and building up momentum, while the Wind and Rain Dark and Dreary focused on endless continuity, suppressing the opponent with force.

Ying Bing perfectly superimposed the two, blending them seamlessly without any discord, even compensating for each other's shortcomings!

Li Mo sighed inwardly.

Bing Dui Dui is still Bing Dui Dui.

To think he could fight her on equal terms with just sword arts was indeed unrealistic.

Of course, Little Li had never planned to win with the sword from the beginning.

He actively used the Wind Shadow Step to disengage, his figure suddenly retreating more than a dozen zhang.

"Impressive," Li Mo said sincerely.

"That's nothing," Ying Bing did not pursue, standing in place with her sword on her back, showing not a trace of pride.

In her previous life, she hadn't mastered the simultaneous use of two intents until the Inner Breath Realm; it wasn't until the Divine Observation Realm that she could use them skillfully.

To make her use them now, he was already sufficiently amazing.

What surprised her even more was Li Mo's stamina and the thickness of his force; she had never seen anything like it in the Blood Qi Realm.

Was this... also obtained from that inheritance?

Down below, the arena was utterly silent.

Even on the high platform, there was a moment of silence.

The出手 (moves) the two had just displayed had surpassed the limits of their understanding of the word 'genius'.

"This is just too much," said Elder Su of Luoxia Peak, finally letting out a long breath.

Once upon a time, she too was called a sword prodigy.

However, it wasn't until the Divine Observation Realm that she vaguely touched upon the existence of sword intent, and it wasn't until the Inner Scene Realm, observing the scene within her heart, that she mastered one.

These two little fellows are getting more and more outrageous...

"Is there a possibility..."

"That Ying Bing hasn't used her full power yet?" Qian Bufan stammered.

Everyone became even more confused in their daze.

It really was true. Ying Bing's capabilities went far beyond sword arts.

The inheritance beneath Qingyuan, her own physique—none of these had been used yet, and she hadn't even used her Inner Breath just now.

"Let's just keep watching," Elder Hanhe said, his gaze profound as he looked at Li Mo.

Ying Bing hadn't used her full power, but had that小子 (kid) used his?

Just as the elders were whispering among themselves.

"I'm going to get serious now," Li Mo said.

"I am one realm higher than you," Ying Bing looked at the youth who had grown serious, and suddenly her red lips parted:

"If you can touch the hem of my clothes, you win."

Bing Dui Dui rarely showed her overbearing side.

It meant she was getting serious too.

"Alright."

These words ignited a small fire in Li Mo's heart.

Commonly known as getting a bit carried away.

The next moment.

---

The two on the arena moved.

*Hum—*

A thick aura of military killing intent vibrated. With just its aura, it划 (scratched) countless marks onto the green stone ground.

Li Mo's entire body seemed to transform into a divine weapon, painful to look at.

The Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body was fully activated by him for the first time to face an enemy.

From the Eyes of Destiny, he had long known that Bing Dui Dui's strongest reliance was definitely not sword arts.

It was herself!

So Little Li decided to go for a direct confrontation.

*Boom—*

Chixiao Sword, enveloped in sharp killing intent, buzzed and hummed. This玄兵 (Mystic Weapon) had become the center of the storm.

Carrying boundless sharpness and immense force, it almost swallowed Ying Bing whole.

One force to break ten thousand techniques.

This was not something Li Mo had领悟ed (understood) from the sword.

At the same time.

As Tianfrost Sword was unleashed, clouds and mist arose. It seemed non-existent yet omnipresent. Amidst its birth and destruction, it hid a sharpness of晦明 (light and dark).

No sword light was visible, yet it felt as if ten thousand swords were pressing upon one's body.

Although he was only fighting Ying Bing alone, Li Mo inexplicably felt as if he had fallen into a heavy encirclement.

No matter how Li Mo attacked, no matter how sharp his military killing intent was, it couldn't stir up much ripple in the clouds and mist.

The people in the arena were completely stunned.

If at the beginning, it was because the sword arts of the two had surpassed their cognition, now they couldn't even tell who had the upper hand.

They could only see the birth and destruction of the clouds and mist, the sharpness surging into the vastness.

The aura of the two even caused a thin mist to rise in the air.

*Ding—*

Li Mo finally caught a glimpse of Ying Bing's figure amidst the illusory clouds and mist. Without hesitation, he launched a full-power strike.

However, what awaited him was not the clearing of clouds and rain, but the figure of the girl slowly fading away.

He hit nothing.

"No wonder she said touching the hem of her clothes counts as a win..."

Li Mo was truly sweating profusely.

At the same time, he deeply knew he couldn't continue to drag this on.

Those heavy feints hidden within the clouds and mist were infused with Ying Bing's Inner Breath, which was incredibly cold. His mind was almost becoming sluggish.

Soon, he would find it difficult to even move.

This was the Red Fate, this was... the person born in accordance with the destiny of the martial world.

Bing Dui Dui was simply so strong it made one despair.

The elders on the high platform also let out an imperceptible sigh.

If they were to go up, even maintaining the cultivation of the Inner Breath Xuan Dan Realm, facing Ying Bing, they wouldn't have the slightest chance of victory.

They probably wouldn't last as long as Li Mo.

They saw even more within it.

Ying Bing was using clouds and Inner Breath to simulate sword qi.

If one were to compare Xiao Qin's external projection of Inner Breath to it, it would be as laughable as a child's play.

Moreover.

It wasn't just simple simulation. Sometimes ethereal and graceful, sometimes vigorous and fierce, sometimes simple and unadorned... ever-changing, yet resonating with each other.

One word: Peerless.

Two words: Terrifying.

"Huff..."

"The clouds can hide swords, then can the military killing intent also..."

Suddenly, Li Mo seemed to have a realization.

And the left hand hidden under his robe, the Star Pole Hammer,悄然 (quietly) fell into his palm.

Everything around him suddenly slowed down.

"Hm?"

Ying Bing sensed it instantly; even her figure had become sluggish.

Opposite her, Li Mo had somehow closed in again.

The youth wasn't using his sword; the Chixiao in his right hand hung down.

He raised his left hand's robe, or rather, the hammer within the robe, and slowly brought it down.

The speed wasn't fast.

However, it gave people a feeling that no matter how they fled to the ends of the earth or dodged and weaved, there was no escape.

**Settling the Universe!**

Ying Bing seemed to ponder.

The sword qi filling the air retracted. A wisp of Yin之力 (Yin power) was used as a thread, twisting the sword qi into a ball.

*Boom—*

The surrounding space seemed to stagnate.

The next instant, countless auras gushed out, uncontrollably shooting in all directions.

The scene instantly became somewhat chaotic.

Shangguan Wencang slapped the table and rose, instantly appearing on the擂台 (arena), pressing down with a single hand.

In his palm, it seemed there was a circle that could devour all things, able to absorb everything, make all things return to nothingness, and dissipate the storm without a trace.

He looked intently towards the center of the arena.

Everyone did the same.

Who won?

However.

Under the gaze of everyone, they suddenly fell into silence again.

What had just happened?

Little Li had shattered the condensed sword qi with one strike.

He had used a trump card that shouldn't be possible to activate in the Blood Qi Realm. Even with his thirty-six meridians' Blood Qi power, he was almost drained.

However, that wisp of Yin power hadn't dissipated, making him feel as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.

It was damn cold.

He had no time to do anything. In his daze, he wrapped his arms around Ying Bing's waist, fell forward into her embrace, and brought her down to the ground with him.

Hmm...

Little Li's vision was blocked.

His already sluggish mind now had only one thought left:

"Even Bing Dui Dui is soft and fragrant in her embrace..."

Ying Bing seemed to be stunned.

She didn't push him away immediately.

Everyone: "!?"

The elders: "!!?"

The representatives of various sects: "!!?"

A passing dog: "???"

Their suspended hearts.

Finally died.

The already chaotic scene became even more chaotic.
