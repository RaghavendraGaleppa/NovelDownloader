# Chapter 65: The Auction in Full Swing

**[《Learn the Divine Travel Technique Without Leaving Home》 - Price: 10 Yellow-grade Spirit Stones. Auction ends in three days. Mastery of this technique allows you to traverse vast distances with ease, making travel convenient...]**

What was called the "Divine Travel Technique" in the auction was, in Xiao Ji's eyes, a modified version of the legendary "Shrinking the Earth to an Inch" technique.  

The creator of this technique was a disciple from an ancient sect who developed it based on the principles of "Shrinking the Earth to an Inch." Though the technique was highly effective, it was eventually abandoned due to its extreme difficulty in cultivation.  

The challenge wasn't in deciphering obscure texts—it was the risk of crippling one's legs if practiced incorrectly, condemning the practitioner to a life in a wheelchair.  

Due to its high risk, the technique never became mainstream and was eventually forgotten over time.  

This particular manual was a rare copy, seized by a cultivator from a grave robber. Unable to master it himself and having lost a leg in the attempt, the cultivator deemed it a fake and tossed it into the auction house, hoping to trick someone into buying it.  

Making money wasn't the goal—the low price was set purely out of spite, hoping others would suffer the same fate and ease the seller's bitterness.  

Such was human nature: dismissing what they couldn't understand as fake, and wishing misfortune upon others when they themselves suffered.  

For Xiao Ji, however, this technique was a must-have.  

And so, he spent ten Yellow-grade Spirit Stones to acquire what was essentially a Heaven-grade technique.  

Once he absorbed its knowledge, daily errands would become effortless. Long-distance travel would no longer require transportation, saving him both time and expenses.  

Many who witnessed Xiao Ji's purchase thought him foolish. The technique wasn't useless—just impractical.  

If it were truly worthless, the auction house of Taigu City wouldn’t have listed it, as all items underwent strict evaluation before being put up for sale.  

"Brother Xiao, why waste money on something so pointless?" Even Qian Duoyu found the purchase extravagant.  

"Like you said—because I like it," Xiao Ji replied. "What's meaningless to you might be invaluable to others. Take spirit stones, for example. To you, they're just rocks. To others, they're treasures."  

"As the saying goes: 'Spirit stones hold beauties, spirit stones hold elixirs, spirit stones hold—'"  

Qian Duoyu scratched his head sheepishly. "Actually, I don’t just throw spirit stones around. My family’s strict—my father always taught me to be frugal. Nowadays, he even caps my annual spending. I’m not as free with money as before."  

"Really?" Xiao Ji scanned the surroundings as they walked, hoping to stumble upon another hidden gem.

"Yeah, like this year, I’ve almost used up my allowance—only ten thousand left," Qian Duoyu lamented.  

Given Qian Duoyu’s spending habits, his "ten thousand" undoubtedly referred to Mystic-grade spirit stones—equivalent to a hundred thousand Yellow-grade ones.  

Xiao Ji decided to end the conversation there.  

After wandering the auction house for a while, he realized that while bargains existed, truly high-value finds were rare.  

Taigu City’s auction house had strict appraisals, ensuring most treasures didn’t slip through the cracks.  

For real bargains, the city’s Treasure Hunt Street was the place to go—a black market of sorts where cultivators set up temporary stalls.  

But his purpose today wasn’t bargain hunting—the Shrinking Earth technique had been a lucky accident.  

He was here for Foundation Establishment Pills.  

At noon, a gong reverberated through the auction hall.  

The live auction was about to begin. Cultivators from Taigu City maintained order as attendees filed into the circular hall, taking their seats around a central stage where the auctioneer and assistants stood.  

Live auctions were the main event—the most profitable segment for the auction house.  

"Esteemed cultivators with boundless futures, good afternoon! I am Jia Qi, your host for today’s auction. As my name suggests, I’m a practitioner of artifact refinement. Though in my youth, I actually preferred skin painting—"  

A colleague tugged his sleeve. "Senior Brother, stay on topic."  

Jia Qi chuckled and smoothly pivoted, signaling the band—a group of cultivators with gongs and drums—to play a popular tune called *Fairies' Melody*.  

Xiao Ji and Qian Duoyu, having arrived late, found seats in the back.  

"So many people!" Qian Duoyu exclaimed.  

"Plenty of people, but few with real money," Xiao Ji remarked. "Most here are paid to fill seats or act as shills to drive up prices. The actual bidders sit up front."  

He had already assessed the crowd.  

A sharp rap of the auctioneer’s gavel silenced the hall.  

"Today marks a splendid beginning. The rules remain unchanged—three strikes of the hammer, and the highest bidder wins," Jia Qi announced. "Now, for our first treasure! Before I even reveal it, I must sing its praises!"  

"This is a magical artifact you simply cannot miss!"  

"Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves—the most coveted artifact is about to be unveiled!"  

With theatrical flair, Jia Qi carefully placed a small vial on the display table.  

"Personally refined by the great alchemist Hong Chun—*Eyes of Revelation*! Whether you’re a Foundation Establishment cultivator or a martial practitioner, this is for you!"  

"Simply apply the elixir to your brows, and you’ll temporarily gain the effects of Divine Sight—night vision and the ability to see through demonic disguises! One bottle provides three hundred applications. A single use might save your life! Starting bid: 799 spirit stones!"  

"Close your eyes. Tell yourself—don’t hesitate. Don’t let this chance slip away! Count down from three, and let the bidding begin!"  

Jia Qi’s rapid-fire pitch nearly choked him.  

Yet, the crowd remained silent.  

No one seemed interested.  

"That’s ridiculously overpriced," someone muttered. Street vendors sold similar elixirs for mere dozens of spirit stones—hardly worth the cost.  

"799 spirit stones for *Eyes of Revelation*—how is that expensive? Are your spiritual eyes clouded?" Jia Qi snapped. "Don’t blame the product! Reflect on yourselves! Have you worked hard enough hunting beasts? Farming spirit fields? Has your cultivation improved?"  

Tension flared as poorer cultivators voiced their outrage, some nearly coming to blows.  

The auction house swiftly replaced Jia Qi with another host, calming the crowd.  

After several rounds, the auction resumed normally.  

Finally, Xiao Ji heard what he’d been waiting for—the Foundation Establishment Pills.  

A staple of every auction, these pills were highly sought after.  

Xiao Ji intended to use his ten thousand Yellow-grade spirit stones to secure a premium batch worth thirty thousand on the market.
