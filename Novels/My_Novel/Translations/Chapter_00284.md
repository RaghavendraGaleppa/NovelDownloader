# Chapter 284: The Five Elements Flags

Jin Shichang presented two rare treasures: the "Five Elements Flags" and the "Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup." The Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup was the originally intended reward—a small silver cup, pale red, about the thickness of a thumb. By dripping blood into the cup and adding herbs that nourish qi and blood, the cup's walls would digest the medicinal properties, enhance the blood quality, and fill the cup to the brim.

One could drink the blood within to strengthen their qi and blood. The treasure cup possessed the ability to digest medicinal power and could also be used to test the properties of medicines, making it useful for medical arts.

The "Five Elements Flags," on the other hand, had a simpler function. They consisted of five palm-sized flags corresponding to the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They could be used for Feng Shui arrangements, stabilizing a home, guarding a residence, or setting up illusion arrays...

Jin Shichang said, "These Five Elements Flags were obtained recently. For their usage, you may seek guidance from Deputy Envoy Yan Hao. In terms of pure quality and utility, the Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup is superior."

Li Xian thought to himself: "I practice the 'Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidness and Gathering Yang Meridian.' My five viscera circulate turbidity and nourish essence and blood, which overlaps with the function of the Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup. However, the Five Elements Flags conceal the profound mysteries of Feng Shui, arrays, and the five elements, which intrigues me more. The Flower Cage Sect specializes in the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams. If I have the chance... I should learn such skills. To walk and stand firm in the Jianghu, one must be versed in all paths to handle matters with ease."

Having decided to take the "Five Elements Flags," Jin Shichang was slightly surprised and scrutinized Li Xian carefully. The Five Elements Flags and the Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup were similar in quality. The Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup nourished blood and strengthened the body, making it easier to use. The Five Elements Flags had infinite妙用 (wondrous uses), but they required a mastery of the five elements and a combination of terrain and geography. The barrier to entry was high; otherwise, they would be like useless flags, only to be sold off.

He said no more, handed over the flags, and turned to leave.

**Green Ox Residence.**

Li Xian circulated qi through his five viscera to expel the alcohol fumes. He closed the door, ensuring no one would disturb him. Nan Gong Liuli sat quietly in the hall, waiting. Seeing Li Xian return safe and sound, she let out a slight sigh of relief.

Nan Gong Liuli asked, "How was the banquet? Did they make things difficult for you?" Li Xian replied, "Not really. I even got a treasure."

He took out the Five Elements Flags. The flagpoles were gilded with colorful patterns, and the triangular flags fluttered without wind. Li Xian and Nan Gong Liuli examined them together, pondering their wondrous use.

Nan Gong Liuli said, "This thing involves the principles of the five elements. It requires a mastery of the five elements and relies on the environmental layout to bring out its妙用 (wondrous use)." She had a discerning eye and a broad perspective, quickly identifying the item's function.

Li Xian said, "I was just planning to study this path, so I chose to take a look."

Nan Gong Liuli said with a tone of frustration, "You are so willful. Do you think treasures are easily obtained?"

Li Xian smiled without speaking. He stroked the flags; they felt warm to the touch and were finely crafted. Treasures and rare items are nurtured by heaven and earth. These "Five Elements Flags" and "Blood Nourishing Treasure Cup" have been carved by man, losing some of their innate natural spiritual charm.

He thought of the layout of this residence: green wood planted to the east, a stream flowing to the west, golden tiles on the roof, and thick mud on the ground... all involving the mysteries of the five elements.

He immediately planted the Five Elements Flags in their corresponding positions. Suddenly, the flags fluttered and gradually merged into the surroundings. The Feng Shui of the surroundings changed. Li Xian vaguely sensed the change but found it hard to describe exactly what it was.

Nan Gong Liuli said, "Ah! This is..." Li Xian asked, "What is it?"

Nan Gong Liuli said, "My second uncle loves to play with Feng Shui. This is a 'Wind and Water Stabilizing Array.'"

Li Xian pulled out the flags and planted them in reverse. The metal flag in earth, the earth flag in water, the water flag in wood, the wood flag in fire... He planted them randomly and in reverse. The flags vanished the moment they were planted, making it extremely difficult for others to distinguish.

Suddenly, he felt stifled and extremely uncomfortable. After waiting a moment, the room felt like a steamer, unbearably hot and stuffy. When he opened the window for ventilation, the wind that blew in was dry. Even if the house were magnificent, such a Feng Shui layout would be hard to live in for long. He would rather live in a mud house.

Nan Gong Liuli said, "Oh no... the layout has changed. With this reversed arrangement of the five elements, living here for long will surely bring bad luck."

Li Xian immediately pulled out the flags. After waiting a moment, the invisible changes returned to normal. He understood the wondrous use of the flags: "The flags conceal the five elements. By arranging them according to the five elements, relying on the environment, setting up layouts, influencing Feng Shui, and arranging illusion arrays, I can achieve many mysterious purposes."

The five elements give rise to all things and conceal many mysteries. The changes of the five elements in the Water Vase Island are extremely intricate, making it difficult to enter or leave. Even if a master stumbles in, they would have to surrender to the trap.

There are many clever uses, but they require a solid foundation of knowledge. Li Xian's interest surged. He tried several times, planting the flags in various places, adjusting the five elements in the courtyard, and thereby affecting the Feng Shui layout. He changed the arrangement of the five elements. It wasn't until midnight that he had his fill of fun. He pulled out the flags, not daring to arrange them randomly anymore.

Nan Gong Liuli was already fast asleep. Li Xian considered that she slept with difficulty. If he disturbed her and her clothes were moved, she would complain endlessly. So he gently pulled a layer of bedding and covered her whole body. He then returned to his own room to sleep.

He placed the flags by his bedside.

"I'll plant the flags in suitable positions later. Turn the Green Ox Residence into a Five Elements illusion array to block sound, improve Feng Shui, and ward off external enemies... that would be perfect!"

**The next day.**

Li Xian pondered the flags and planted them in five locations around the residence. Although it didn't become an "illusion array," it was more than enough to isolate external noise, circulate internal Feng Shui, interconnect the five elements, and create a small world of its own.

Green Ox Street was bustling with traffic in the early morning, with vendors shouting, children playing, and much noise. Li Xian calmed his mind and heart. Even in such a noisy scene, he could block out the influence. But being quiet and serene was always better.

Under the arrangement of the flags, the courtyard scenery seemed more vivid. It was quiet and pleasant, very suitable for leisurely living and recuperation. Li Xian thought: "The Five Elements Flags have more妙用 (wondrous uses), but my ability is limited. I'll let it suffer for now. Once I master the arrangement of the five elements, I'll use it properly."

He practiced martial arts diligently, repeatedly refining his fists, kicks, fingers, body, and sword... accumulating proficiency. When he executed the "Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword," the heat waves were scorching and pressing, and the momentum was terrifying.

Passersby on Green Ox Street, separated only by a door, did not notice. When Li Xian shouted outward, passersby could only hear a vague sound. He let loose, his chest drumming with thunder as he practiced the "Gang Thunder Finger." Ethereal fairy sounds accompanied his sword moves. He挥洒 (wielded) sword qi, his figure agile and灵动 (spiritually agile). His martial arts were gradually improving.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +2\]

The "Flying Snake Hand" followed suit and reached \[Perfection\]. A cluster of internal qi grew within his qi lake. His qi volume became increasingly abundant. \[Three Classics of Blood Refining · Vomiting Blood Classic\] also reached \[Great Completion\]. His martial arts progress was significant.

He expressed his joy and satisfaction. Nan Gong Liuli was still sleeping peacefully and hadn't woken up. After practicing in the morning, Li Xian's bones and muscles were all loosened. He jumped onto a tree branch to pick red fruits to eat.

The fruit juice was sweet and refreshing. Li Xian enjoyed it greatly. He lay on the wooden floor outside the hall, his clothes loosened, lying in the middle. It was his own residence; there was no need to be restrained.

He had temporarily put an end to various matters and was now at a critical point. Hao Qingshe remained a great threat, but Shi Yufei had the intention to protect him. Zeng Xiaoke's injuries were severe. Even with precious medicine applied, it would take nearly a month to fully recover.

He now possessed three taels of "merit money." Including what Shi Yufei promised, he could purchase a set of martial arts or secret classics... This matter needed to be put on the agenda. Furthermore, Nan Gong Liuli's "Rainbow Skirt Glancing Garment" needed to be removed quickly.

This woman's ability was not bad and could be of great help.

In short... lie low and accumulate.

Li Xian thought over matters carefully when he suddenly remembered a major event. He immediately went out and locked the vermilion door tightly. He walked to a side alley at the edge of Peach Blossom Town and saw a flower boat already setting sail. Ye Cheng, Meng Han, and many elders and disciples were seeing them off from afar.

About a dozen Flower Cage Sect disciples were traveling with Liu Yu. Pang Long, Ding Zelin... were all on the boat, sailing away.

After seeing Liu Yu off, Li Xian exchanged pleasantries with Ye Cheng and the others. Then he returned to the Green Ox Residence, buying a few meat pies along the way. He made do with a simple meal.

**That afternoon.**

Li Xian began preparing to remove the "Rainbow Skirt Glancing Garment." According to Liu Yu's instructions, he ventured alone into the deep valley to find the corresponding flowers. The "Nine Flowers Jade Dew Cream" required flowers of the four seasons and the five elements as ingredients.

Spring flowers, summer flowers, winter flowers, autumn flowers... earth flowers, water flowers, wood flowers, metal flowers, fire flowers. A total of nine flowers, combined with unique techniques, carefully boiled into a cream.

The nine types of flowers could not be plucked more than a day and night after leaving the soil. They didn't have to be picked on the same day.

Flowers of the four seasons were easy to find; he gathered enough in half a day. Flowers of the five elements were scattered but all belonged to common flowers, so they weren't hard to find. When Li Xian found the \[fire flower\], he saw a sea of fiery red flowers, like rising flames, extremely beautiful.

Appreciating the heavenly scenery while picking flowers was naturally a rare pleasure. Li Xian picked the fire flower and then went to find the wood flower and metal flower... all easily picked.

When he went to find the earth flower, he was a bit troubled. The earth flower grew among the cliffs and rocks and needed to be picked in the ninth and tenth months. Li Xian searched several steep cliffs but couldn't find any.

They had all been harvested by flower farmers. After searching for more than half an hour, he saw a single earth flower growing in a towering cliff face. Although the cliff was steep, almost as if cut by a sword or axe, there were hundreds of beehives hanging between the cliffs.

Dense... it made one's scalp tingle. The creatures bred in these hives were called "Rock Bees." Their stingers didn't contain poison, but they were as hard as rock. If they pierced the body, the pain was extreme.

Below the cliff were dozens of skeletons. Bone fragments were scattered everywhere. Li Xian picked up a piece of bone, which was full of bee stingers. It was clear that these bees' stingers could pierce skin and bone!

This place was a punishment ground of the Flower Cage Sect, named "Piercing Bee Press." Those who betrayed the sect or violated its rules would be tied up and thrown below the bee cliff to suffer the pain of ten thousand bees piercing their bones.

Li Xian had cultivated the "Seven Star Step." He leaped and stepped on the cliff wall, using the momentum to ascend lightly. He leaped several zhang high, already far from the ground. The Rock Bees on the cliff were startled and immediately flew out in a dark mass.

It was truly like a dark cloud covering the sky and sun, the buzzing of the bees like thunder. If ten thousand bees stinged at once, who could remain unharmed? Li Xian's scalp tingled, but he forced himself to be calm. He activated the "Pure Gang Qi Robe" and enveloped the swarm of bees.

The bees were wrapped by an invisible robe substance, buzzing in confusion. Li Xian hurriedly grabbed the earth flower and jumped down from the cliff.

His turbid robe covered the swarm of bees. The bees buzzed and flew around, actually providing quite a bit of support. For a moment, Li Xian didn't fall; it was as if he were being carried by the bees.

Li Xian felt very surprised. He actually used the "wonders of the turbid robe" and the "power of the swarm" to experience the pleasure of walking on air and roaming the heavens and earth. Li Xian let out a cry and glanced back at the "Bee Cliff." He thought to himself:

"If I ever encounter an enemy in the future, with my Pure Gang Qi Robe, this place... could be a wonderful place to escape."

He executed the "Lightness Technique," paired with the "Vast Leg." The seven qi clusters in his body gathered a light momentum. He actually floated upwards slightly. Li Xian estimated he was about ten zhang high!

Li Xian's hand trembled slightly, opening a gap in the turbid robe covering the swarm. Hundreds of Rock Bees flew out. The supporting force immediately decreased, and Li Xian gradually descended, but the speed was very slow.

After his feet touched the ground, he completely released the turbid robe, letting all the Rock Bees return. Li Xian laughed: "Go back, little ones!" Considering the pleasure of roaming the heavens and earth, he only drove them away without killing them.

Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his shoulder. Three bee stingers had pierced his skin. The Rock Bees were extremely formidable; their stingers were sharp and tough, actually managing to wound him.

He pulled out the bee stingers and went to find the last ingredient, the "water flower." The water flower grew in a deep lake on the east side of the island, with extremely long vines and pale red flowers.

It was already near dusk. Li Xian quickened his pace. The water flower was not difficult to find; it could often be seen in the lake. However, it was far from the shore. Li Xian had undergone "Clear Ascension and Turbid Descent," so he had no way to reach it.

There were neither boats nor pedestrians around. Li Xian took out the "Flower Rope" and threw it into the water. It entangled the vine of the water flower. Li Xian shook his wrist, and the force traveled along the rope into the lake, making a "bang" sound as water splashed.

He pulled the rope again and got the water flower. Li Xian thought:

"Martial arts are endless... possessing martial arts is not just for fighting and competing with others. It can also bring convenience to life and allow one to experience the heavens and earth."

All nine types of flowers were in hand. He returned to the Green Ox Residence and immediately started a fire to boil water. He boiled the nine flowers in order, added other herbs to adjust the medicinal properties and effects, and sprinkled "White Stone Powder"...

The boiling filled the courtyard with a fragrance of flowers. Nan Gong Liuli, wearing jade shoes, walked over lightly and asked, "Are we eating flower soup tonight?"

Li Xian laughed: "Whether we can eat flower soup or not is unknown, but we need to peel off the flower clothes." Nan Gong Liuli didn't understand and asked in detail. Li Xian answered truthfully. Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Liuli's face immediately turned red.

Li Xian guarded the pot carefully. He saw the soup gradually thicken, coagulate into a cream, and the fragrance of flowers overflowed. This Nine Flowers Jade Dew Cream was a specialty of the Water Vase Island. It felt smooth to the touch. Applied externally, it could treat injuries; taken internally, it could regulate pain.

Li Xian said with a smile: "Do you want to try?" Nan Gong Liuli's face was flushed. She pretended to be generous and said, "Alright."

The two returned to the hall. When the Jade Dew Cream touched the skin, it turned into a layer of watery, moist film. Li Xian helped her massage to promote blood circulation, allowing the medicinal power of the Nine Flowers Jade Dew Cream to be fully absorbed deep into her muscles.

This process inevitably touched the fine needles. It was like repeatedly executing the "Soft Wind One Finger," touching acupoints all over her body. Nan Gong Liuli had gradually adapted recently and didn't lose her composure. But she was gradually hit one after another. The Jingmen and Zhangmen acupoints on her ribs, the Changqiang, Xuanshu, and Lingtai acupoints on her back, the Jiquan acupoint under her arm, the Yongquan and Duyin acupoints on the soles of her feet... all the key acupoints for qi circulation were involved, causing extreme discomfort.

It was like ants biting. After a slight sting, each acupoint became itchy. It was deep in the skin, and ordinary scratching was useless. It could only wait for it to gradually subside on its own.

Nan Gong Liuli said tremblingly: "Great hero... you... you mustn't deliberately tease me." Li Xian was concentrating and had no intention of teasing. He was considerate of Nan Gong Liuli, who had been forced to wear this strange garment.

But hearing Nan Gong Liuli's pleas, they weren't entirely filled with pain. His playful side stirred. He had no intention of teasing at first, but he now secretly intended to tease. He said solemnly: "Liuli, rest assured."

Nan Gong Liuli relaxed slightly. But she realized she had relaxed too soon. This Li Xian fellow was truly a treacherous brat full of tricks.

The medicinal power of the Nine Flowers Jade Dew Cream was fully absorbed. It was time to remove the strange garment through the steps. First, remove the irrelevant accessories, belts, sachets... many steps, very troublesome.

The jade shoes were made of jade and had a very exquisite design. Li Xian had seen Wen Caishang wear them. When he undid the jade shoes, her toes were slightly exposed. After wearing them for several days, they were sweaty and dirty. Nan Gong Liuli looked at him awkwardly.

**Half an hour later.**

The Rainbow Skirt Glancing Garment was completely removed.

She finally shed a heavy burden and felt relaxed all over. Nan Gong Liuli sat back on the wooden chair, feeling numb all over, her body soaked in sweat. Her long hair was loose and scattered, with the hairpin that fixed it hanging loosely in her waterfall of hair.

Li Xian looked at her teasingly and said, "Actually, this Rainbow Skirt Glancing Garment has its merits."

Nan Gong Liuli nodded slightly and said, "After getting used to wearing it, it feels a bit strange..." Seeing Li Xian deliberately teasing her, she immediately changed her tune: "Why don't you try wearing it?"

Li Xian said, "I'll pass." He tossed his own clothes to Nan Gong Liuli and said, "Go wash up quickly. The sweat smell is killing me." Nan Gong Liuli's face turned completely red, unable to utter a word of rebuttal. She immediately entered the bathroom and drew cold water to wash.

She washed for half an hour. When she came out again, she was already clean all over. Her long hair was loose, and the moonlight shone on her. Her appearance was delicate and beautiful, showing a lot of charm.

She could walk, sit, and lie down without any hindrance. But the habit remained. Her steps were light and slightly showy. Realizing this, she tried hard to correct it. But it was hard to completely get rid of.

She picked up the hairpin from the ground and saw the scattered clothes on the floor, her cheeks couldn't help but flush. She circulated her qi and moved her blood; overall, she felt much better. She tied her hair up and fixed it with the hairpin.

Seeing Li Xian deep in thought, she looked at him a few more times and thought: "This kid is righteous when he's righteous. When I was in trouble, he didn't add to my misery and was willing to help. Both Sister Bian and I owe him a favor. But if you say he's evil... he's quite evil too. He mixes well with these flower thieves and villains, feeling as comfortable as a fish in water."

She couldn't help but scrutinize him carefully. First, his eyebrows and eyes, then his straight and handsome nose. The more she looked, the more handsome she found him.

Li Xian sensed her gaze and cleared his mind. He looked back. Their eyes met. There was an extreme tacit understanding in their hearts. Although their emotions were shallow, their desires were both present.

The water hadn't arrived, and the channel wasn't formed. But the mountains and waters had met. It was inevitable that there would be a soul-stirring, earth-shaking union of life and blood.

It was the seventh month.

The full moon was hazy, hidden deep in the clouds. Dark clouds rumbled, and a sudden rainstorm arrived. The Rock Bees from the bee cliff kicked the残花 (withered flowers) sea, determined to find the villain from the daytime. Unfortunately, they ultimately returned empty-handed, forced back to their hives by the sudden rain.

Poor those poisonous bees, encountering the sudden rain, could only get drenched all over. And the flowers in the flower sea weren't much better, pressed down by the dense raindrops, unable to raise their heads.

The rain hit the eaves and flowed down the grooves of the bricks and tiles. It ticked and tapped incessantly.

One house had forgotten to close its door. The wind blew and swept into the room. The candlelight was bright, casting shadows on the window.

**The next day.**

Nan Gong Liuli simply draped a dress, picked up a branch, and practiced swordplay in the courtyard. She hadn't moved for nearly a month and finally had freedom of movement. After the rain stopped in the morning, she started practicing swordplay despite the wet ground.

She performed several sword flowers, each hiding profound techniques. Li Xian was tidying the courtyard, pulling up weeds. The soil in the outer courtyard was exposed. Last night's sudden rain had created puddles. Nan Gong Liuli wore a common cloth skirt. She stepped on the puddles barefoot, but not a splash of water rose. Her figure moved like a swimming dragon. She was worthy of being a noble lady; her martial arts cultivation was far beyond that of a flower thief. But as her body moved with the sword, her feet felt slightly weak, unable to exert full force, giving a soft sensation.

She leaned against the wall to rest. Remembering something, she couldn't help but feel shy. From shyness and embarrassment to forgetting herself. That intimate union was truly extraordinary.

Nan Gong Liuli didn't dare to move recklessly. After a slight stretch, she returned to the hall. The tables and chairs were a bit crooked; she quickly straightened them all. Seeing Li Xian staring at some broken silver, she opened her mouth to speak but felt too shy to talk to him.

After a while, Nan Gong Liuli thought: "It's just a partnership to find a way out. If I act so coy, it will seem strange." So she straightened her posture and asked calmly: "What are you thinking about?"

Li Xian pondered: "I searched my whole body and only have half a taels of broken silver. I'm afraid I can't even afford food for today." Nan Gong Liuli said: "Is that difficult?"

Li Xian sighed: "It is somewhat difficult." He hid the broken silver close to his body. He looked at her teasingly. Nan Gong Liuli raised her eyebrows slightly, pretending to be calm.

She adjusted her clothes and said calmly: "It's just a partnership, don't think too much about it."

Last night's sudden rain had washed all the dust from the air, making the morning air fresh. Li Xian and Nan Gong Liuli chatted for a while, then practiced martial arts in the outer courtyard.

The "Flying Snake Hand" and "Vomiting Blood Classic" were practiced diligently. Nan Gong Liuli had nothing to do. The town was bustling, but she couldn't leave the residence. She could only watch Li Xian practice martial arts, silently evaluating him with the eyes of a Nan Gong family noble lady.

She saw Li Xian first execute the Flying Snake Hand, cleverly using the momentum of a python. Initially, it was agile and elegant, gradually gaining a surging momentum... His movements were not like a venomous snake striking, but more like a dragon rolling.

She couldn't help but be full of praise and applaud.

"My Nan Gong family's cousins and sisters, of course,不乏 (there is no lack of) those with profound martial arts attainments. But we have elders to teach us meticulously, passing on the true essence of martial arts, using unique methods to temper our martial arts, and our martial arts are complete and flawless. We progress rapidly when practicing. Entering,精通 (mastering), small completion, great completion... even perfection and perfection are not too difficult."

"But if we leave the scope of our family's martial arts, learning other martial arts, progress is inevitably slow, and we feel extremely uncomfortable. Over time... the family develops pride and arrogance. The younger generations look down on external moves and blindly respect the family rules. They are unwilling to practice external martial arts, which is a drawback."

"The family has gradually realized this, so they encourage the younger generations to learn from others' strengths and go to high mountains and deep sects to practice martial arts. In this chaotic world, if we see outstanding talents, we might recommend them back to the family and recruit them as sons-in-law... Ah... how did I think of this."

Nan Gong Liuli shook her head and cursed: "If I really can escape, I'll forget him immediately. Acting so arrogant... making three agreements, as if no one can leave him. A rough little thief like you, who would be willing to suffer your torment."

Her mind drifted, and she gradually lost interest in watching.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

Reviewing the old to learn the new, learning from the past to understand the present. Li Xian practiced diligently, executing the "Breeze Leg," "Four Directions Fist," "Vast Leg," "Green Silk Palm"... "Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword" in full. His qi lake rippled, becoming increasingly abundant, already reaching over seventy-five zhang.

He pondered silently:

"Based on my various characteristics, which martial arts can I fully utilize? No... wanting to fully utilize is too greedy. Being able to utilize one or two is enough."

He pondered deeply. When he came to his senses, it was already noon.

He returned to his bedroom, sat cross-legged to practice internally, moved the turbidity of his viscera, and accumulated his foundation. It was monotonous but fulfilling, and he was gradually becoming stronger.

"Strange... why hasn't the 'Dust Settled' characteristic appeared yet."

This matter was hard to predict, so he thought no more. His stomach was hungry, so he couldn't help but search his body for money to buy food. Suddenly, he touched a red pill tightly wrapped in the lining of his clothes.

This was the "Crane Middle Pill," obtained from a tomb deep in the mountains. It was quite a coincidence. Li Xian had been through many dangerous events and was afraid of losing the precious pill, so he hid it in the deepest part. Every time he changed clothes, he would remember this pill. But seeing the pill exuding a faint fragrance and having an unusual appearance, he was afraid of swallowing it whole, wasting it, and delaying its wondrous effects.

Moreover, he had recently been in many life-and-death situations. Taking the pill recklessly might cause abnormalities. He would prefer the \[Ingestion\] skill to advance further, increasing the medicinal effects.

All sorts of reasons... taking it now was the best time!

Li Xian held the Crane Middle Pill in his hand and heard the silence around him. He decided to take it here.

The red pill entered his stomach, and its wonders were immediately revealed!...
