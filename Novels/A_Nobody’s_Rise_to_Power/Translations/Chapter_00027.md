Chapter 27: Xiao Wan

Yang Can said nothing, merely letting out a soft sigh filled with endless worry.

Pan Xiaowan looked at his pitiful, aggrieved little expression and was utterly infatuated with him.

This little heartbreaker, even a sigh makes my appetite surge. I really want to swallow him whole with a single gulp of water.

A mischievous impulse struck Pan Xiaowan. She slipped a foot out from under her skirt and暧昧ly stepped on the tip of Yang Can’s boot.

Yang Can hurriedly pulled his foot back, saying helplessly, "Sister-in-law, please stop fooling around."

Pan Xiaowan giggled again, leaning forward with seductive, silk-like eyes. "You don’t want your sister-in-law to tease you? Fine. Then why don’t you tease me instead?"

The young woman laughed wantonly. Her voluptuous figure and charming looks possessed a bone-deep allure and mature风情. She looked as appetizing as autumn grapes hanging on a trellis.

Yang Can was finding it hard to take. He truly hadn't expected this Mrs. Pan to be so bold. The door was wide open, and she... she should at least close it first.

Yang Can had met this Mrs. Pan not long after arriving at Phoenix Manor with Yu Chengye.

Pan Xiaowan seemed to have fallen for Yang Can at first sight. The first time they met, she dared to secretly cast flirtatious glances at him when no one was looking.

Whenever they had a chance to be alone afterward, Pan Xiaowan would try every way to seduce him. The more Yang Can avoided her, the more excited she became.

This Lady Xiaowan was the second wife of the Grand Steward Li Youcai. She had been married to him for seven or eight years.

Judging by her current age, she must have married him when she was fifteen or sixteen.

An old husband and a young wife naturally meant she was doted upon, but Yang Can hadn't expected her to be dared into such boldness.

Yang Can didn't want to get involved with her. She was too forward and fiery. A woman like this loves to the extreme and hates to the extreme. If he got involved with her, the consequences would be endless troubles.

Yang Can had finally secured such a great opportunity to become Yu Chengye's private advisor. He cherished this prospect immensely.

要知道 Yu Chengye was the future head of the Yu clan. Even if Yang Can didn't have much talent and couldn't become a Grand Steward in the future, he could still become a close aide to the clan head, like Steward Deng Xun.

With such a bright future, what kind of wealth, beautiful wife, or charming concubines couldn't he have in the future? He had no need to risk his reputation for a secret tryst with Lady Xiaowan. It wasn't as if he were possessed by the spirit of Cao Mengde.

Fortunately, opportunities for the two to be alone were few. Just over three months after arriving at Phoenix Manor, Yang Can accompanied Yu Chengye to Jincheng to fetch the bride, and thus escaped Mrs. Pan's harassment.

Who would have thought that after more than three months, upon their return, this Mrs. Pan was even more unrestrained and fiery than before.

"Tea is here! Tsk, what is this world coming to? Even this old man has to serve personally," grumbled the Grand Steward Li as he walked in carrying a tea tray.

The seductive look on Pan Xiaowan's face vanished instantly. Her chin lifted slightly, and she regained her haughty demeanor.

Li Youcai placed the tea tray on the table and glared at Pan Xiaowan unhappily. "Pour the tea."

Although he both feared and doted on this charming wife, he still wanted to assert his authority as a husband in front of outsiders.

Pan Xiaowan snorted. After thinking for a moment, she still walked over to pour the tea.

Li Youcai sat down in the chair opposite and smiled. "Mr. Yang, what specific duties has the Clan Head assigned to you?"

Yang Can hurriedly said, "In the past, I was the Young Master's guest advisor, so it wasn't appropriate to get too close to the Grand Steward. Now that we are both stewards serving the main branch together, I will need your guidance in the future, Grand Steward.

Please stop calling me 'Mr.' all the time. I have recently taken a courtesy name: 'Huoshan.' You may call me by my courtesy name."

Li Youcai said happily, "Since that's the case, then I won't stand on ceremony. I shall treat you as a younger brother, and you can call me 'Big Brother' to show our closeness."

Yang Can smiled. "Alright. To be honest with you, Big Brother, the Clan Head has appointed me as the Second Steward of the main branch. However, he hasn't specified exactly which affairs I should handle.

By the way, the Clan Head plans to hand over the manors and pastures returned by the Second Master to our main branch to manage. The Clan Head will likely summon you regarding this, Big Brother, and will probably give instructions then."

Li Youcai was overjoyed upon hearing this. "The Clan Head plans to hand over the manors and pastures returned by the Second Master to our main branch to manage? Good, very good."

At this moment, Pan Xiaowan had finished brewing the tea. She walked over gracefully and served a cup to Yang Can.

She bent down, placed the tea on the table first, and then gently pushed it toward Yang Can's hand.

Just that one movement of bending over gave Yang Can an impact sensation as if "Mount Tai were crushing an egg."

Pan Xiaowan's figure was perfectly shaped like a gourd; her bosom was simply too vast, possessing a suffocating pressure.

As Pan Xiaowan straightened up, she threw another fiery, provocative wink at Yang Can.

Her husband was right behind her, yet she dared to flirt with this handsome young advisor in front of him. It seemed... for her, doing this was particularly stimulating.

Before Yang Could react, she had already walked back, placed a tea cup for Li Youcai, poured one for herself, and sat down below her husband, her eyes shimmering as she glanced at Yang Can.

Li Youcai straightened his expression and said, "Huoshan, among the industries originally managed by our main branch, Chicken Goose Mountain and the orchard aren't major assets, so they were simply handed over to a few managers to handle.

The real assets under the Young Master's name are the salt ponds in Lingzhou and the ironworks in Heishui. Originally, since the Clan Head sent you here, I should have split one of these—either the salt ponds or the ironworks—with you. But..."

Li Youcai frowned slightly and took a thoughtful sip of tea.

Pan Xiaowan also picked up her tea. As she lowered her head to drink, her clear eyes glanced up at Yang Can.

Suddenly, her slender, long tongue extended. Like a cat, she lapped up the tea.

When a cat drinks, its tongue touches the water surface lightly, forming a column of water with incredible speed and swallowing it. This action, combining elegance with precise control, is like magic, and was praised by the ancients as "catching the waves."

Yang Can was momentarily dazzled by her magical drinking technique. He quickly corrected his gaze and looked at Li Youcai.

Li Youcai deliberated. "But... Huoshan, you know, the profits from salt and iron... right?"

Salt and iron were extremely important industries for any clan or even a nation.

Yu Xinglong had originally placed these two major industries with the main branch to cultivate his son.

These two industries yielded astonishing profits. Because of their importance, the person in charge wielded immense power.

Judging by Li Youcai's expression, he didn't want to give Yang Can, the Second Steward, a share of the salt and iron at all.

Li Youcai said, "Now that the Young Master is dead, many people are eyeing this piece of fat meat. Many people are hoping for us to make a mistake. As long as we slip up, they will seize the opportunity to make trouble and take these industries from us."

Currently, Yang Can had no interest in managing these industries because it would require him to travel frequently to Lingzhou and Heishui. He wanted to stay close to Phoenix Manor and didn't want to make any big moves until he confirmed that Suo Chanzhi was pregnant.

Yang Can bowed slightly. "Big Brother is right. At this time, we absolutely cannot make any mistakes. It is best for you, Big Brother, to take charge of these two assets."

Li Youcai was very satisfied to see that he was so understanding. He laughed and said, "The two of us working together with all our hearts to serve the Clan Head is the foundation of everything. We will discuss everything, we will discuss everything, haha..."

Li Youcai smiled. "As for the salt ponds and ironworks, I have managed them for the Young Master for many years. Now, many people are plotting to get them. To be safe, I won't give them to you for now.

However, since you have come to the main branch, you cannot have nothing to do. I was originally worried about this. Since the Clan Head has also allocated the manors and pastures returned by the Second Master to our main branch, that is excellent.

I was thinking, the salt and iron sector will still be managed by me to avoid mistakes that others could use against us. As for the six manors and three pastures, I will hand them over to you to manage.

These industries already had regulations when they were in the hands of the Second Master. As long as everything follows the old rules, there shouldn't be any major trouble. What do you think?"

Hearing this, Yang Can cursed inwardly: *You old bastard, do you really think I'm an idiot?*

Would Yu Huanhu give up easily after being forced to hand over these assets?

The managers of those manors, big and small, are all Yu Huanhu's people. Wouldn't they try to trip me up or drag their feet?

You take all the benefits, yet push this troublesome job full of pitfalls onto me. If you really piss me off, I'll make your wife pay your debts!

Although Yang Can thought this in his heart, he said with a face full of gratitude, "I haven't been a guest advisor for long. If I were to take on such a heavy responsibility suddenly, I would be a bit overwhelmed. Managing manors and pastures is relatively easier. Thank you for your consideration, Big Brother."

Li Youcai looked at Yang Can and found him even more pleasing to the eye. "My dear, prepare a banquet later. I want to gather the managers of the main branch to welcome Huoshan tonight."

Pan Xiaowan looked reluctant and casually hummed in agreement.

Yang Can hurriedly clasped his fists. "Thank you, Big Brother, Sister-in-law."

Since Yang Can didn't compete for the management rights of the salt ponds and ironworks, Grand Steward Li felt very comfortable.

He smiled slightly and asked, "By the way, have you arranged accommodation yet?"

Yang Can shook his head. "Not yet. It's a small matter; I can think about it later."

Li Youcai said, "There is a courtyard next to mine. I'll allocate it to you."

Pan Xiaowan coughed lightly and said reluctantly, "Have you gone senile? Isn't that courtyard supposed to be connected to ours to make a two-entry compound?"

Being scolded by his wife in front of Yang Can, Li Youcai felt he was losing face. He put on a stern look and said, "It's all the Yu family's property. Can you just merge them as you please?

Besides, isn't this because my brother has arrived? Later, you can take Xilai and Wangcai over to help clean and tidy it up."

Yang Can quickly said, "I wouldn't dare to trouble Sister-in-law."

Pan Xiaowan snorted, set her tea cup down on the table with a thud, stood up, and walked out without looking back.

Li Youcai apologized, "My wife has been spoiled by me. Please don't mind her, Huoshan. By the way, do you have anyone to serve you in your courtyard? I have two young servants in mine; I can give you one."

Yang Can hurriedly declined, but Li Youcai waved his hand. "Why stand on ceremony with me? These two servants are careless and clumsy. As long as you don't dislike them."

Li Youcai leaned forward, covering his mouth with his hand, and whispered, "It wouldn't be right to give you both. You should at least take one. That way, I'll be short-handed and have an excuse to buy a pretty maid."

"Uh...咳, then I shall accept your kindness."

Li Youcai laughed heartily upon hearing his agreement. "Good that you don't stand on ceremony, good that you don't. You absolutely must not be too polite to me, hahaha..."
