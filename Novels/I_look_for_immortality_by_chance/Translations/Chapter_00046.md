# Chapter 46: The Seal of Boundless Fortune!

"Is this... the Immortal Golden Essence?"

Staring at the strange golden light, Gu Yuan's heart trembled as he immediately recalled the "Mirage Cloud Seal" from Silverfish Island.

This peculiar golden radiance seemed to be the legendary Immortal Golden Seal that only Golden Core cultivators could forge.

"Could it be that this golden opportunity at the bottom of the water is an Immortal Golden Seal left behind by some Golden Core cultivator after their death?" Gu Yuan pondered silently.

The Immortal Golden Seal was the only magical imprint a Golden Core master could leave behind after death—the most powerful and extraordinary remnant of their lifetime's cultivation.

Every sect or family that had once produced a Golden Core master could suppress ordinary Foundation Establishment forces, primarily because of this single golden seal.

Suppressing his excitement, Gu Yuan cautiously descended deeper.

Fortunately, everything remained eerily calm.

That wisp of golden light seemed to suppress all disturbances, imbuing the entire cavern with an otherworldly aura.

Gu Yuan carefully approached the golden radiance and finally saw its true form.

It was a dazzling golden seal, with wisps of golden mist swirling endlessly across its surface. In fleeting glimpses, visions of mountains, rivers, mortal lives, and celestial palaces seemed to appear.

The entire seal exuded a divine, ethereal lightness.

"Is this... a Fate Seal?" Gu Yuan's heart shook violently.

In this world, cultivation had flourished to its peak, with countless magical seals emerging. Yet, if one spoke of the most mysterious, the Fate Seal undoubtedly ranked first!

"Fate first, fortune second, feng shui third, accumulated virtue fourth, and knowledge fifth."

Even in his past life, the word "fate" had been placed above all else.

Though cultivation in this world could alter one's destiny, the concept of "fate" remained profoundly enigmatic.

"Vast family wealth," "rapid ascension," "endless riches"—these were all aspects of the Fate Seal.

With a Fate Seal, one's life trajectory and opportunities would receive an almost inconceivable enhancement.

Before the Celestial Palace and the Eastern Sea Dragon Court were established, a mighty cultivator had once forged the "Seal of Turning Misfortune into Blessing," forcibly altering his own fortune. Despite countless battles, he always "coincidentally" turned peril into safety.

In the end, however, fate could not overcome divine power, and he perished.

Yet, the marvel of the Fate Seal remained undeniable.

Especially for low-level cultivators—obtaining a Fate Seal could instantly transform their destiny.

*Crack!*

Just as Gu Yuan reached out to pick up the Fate Seal and examine the runes beneath to identify its exact nature, a sound of cracking eggshell suddenly echoed from the side.

Only then did Gu Yuan notice a small jade-colored egg beside the golden seal.

The egg was about a foot tall, crystal clear like a piece of art, placed right next to the golden seal.

But Gu Yuan had been completely unaware of it.

Had the egg not cracked on its own, he might never have noticed it.

It was as if all his attention had been wholly absorbed by the golden seal.

"Something's wrong..."

A sudden realization struck Gu Yuan, and he grew alert.

The cavern was pitch-black, submerged two hundred zhang underwater, silent and terrifying. In such a dreadful environment, how had he, a mere Qi Refinement sixth-layer cultivator with no life-saving trump cards, dared to venture so deep?

A water cavern this vast and profound could easily conceal a flood dragon—how had he been so reckless?

He possessed the Stone Liquid, allowing him to continuously seek opportunities. His future was boundless.

But what if he lost his life here?

What use would the Stone Liquid be then?

A chill ran down Gu Yuan's spine as he realized something was amiss.

He had always been cautious, yet this time, he hadn't even noticed the jade egg beside the golden seal. That was truly bizarre.

*Crack!*

The sound of the eggshell cracking continued.

Gu Yuan's scalp tingled, and he dared not linger, swiftly swimming upward.

*Snap!*

At that moment, the eggshell shattered completely, and a palm-sized jade snake emerged.

The snake seemed newly born, tiny and delicate, its skin like polished jade, with two small horns on its head—utterly exquisite.

Yet, its emerald-green eyes held none of the confusion of a newborn. Instead, they carried the languidness of something awakening from a long slumber.

Watching Gu Yuan frantically swimming upward, even summoning his magical tools in panic, the snake's emerald eyes gleamed with amusement.

*Whoosh!*

In the next instant, it transformed into a streak of light, darting through the water and appearing above Gu Yuan in the blink of an eye.

Gu Yuan's heart lurched violently, overcome with an overwhelming sense of dread.

*Pfft!*

He wanted to react, but his body refused to move. Helpless, he could only watch as the jade snake gracefully swam to his right hand and bit down on his fingertip.

A faint sting spread, followed by a sucking sensation as his blood was drawn toward the wound, swiftly swallowed by the snake.

The blood flowed faster and faster. Gu Yuan's heartbeat accelerated, his face growing pale.

Meanwhile, the snake's scales grew increasingly radiant, its emerald eyes shining with delight.

*Buzz!*

At the same time, the golden seal below seemed drawn by some mysterious force, abruptly rising to float beside the snake.

As the seal passed Gu Yuan, he caught a glimpse of the intricate runes on its underside.

Though he couldn't comprehend the runes, four words inexplicably imprinted themselves in his mind:

**"Boundless Fortune Seal!"**

"This is the Seal of Boundless Fortune!"

The thought had barely formed in Gu Yuan's mind before he lost consciousness from blood loss.

"Such delicious blood!"

"The True Dragon has been dead for so long, yet the Seal of Boundless Fortune only arranged this little one for me now. Could there be something special about him?"

A husky, languid voice suddenly echoed through the water.

The voice was mature and alluring, brimming with sensuality—yet it came from the tiny jade snake, creating a stark contrast.

Then, a terrifying spiritual sense radiated from the snake, sweeping over every inch of Gu Yuan's body.

But it found nothing.

"Hmm? A five-aperture physique and a few shoddy magical tools?"

"With just this, how could he attract the Seal of Boundless Fortune and become my attendant?"

The bewitching voice was filled with confusion. But as it glanced at the eternally radiant golden seal beside it, it ultimately sighed in resignation.

"Fine. What's done is done."

"Little one, don't die too quickly. I hope we meet again someday..."

The jade snake gazed at Gu Yuan's handsome face, even in unconsciousness, and suddenly chuckled softly, as if recalling something.

Then, with a flick of its tail, a single jade scale detached from its body and embedded itself into Gu Yuan's chest, vanishing without a trace.

Satisfied, the jade snake smiled faintly before darting away, disappearing along with the golden seal as if it had never existed.

In the silent waters, only Gu Yuan remained, floating alone.

Fortunately, the Water-Avoiding Pearl's effect hadn't faded, keeping him dry and supplied with air.

As the jade snake vanished, the once-silent cavern gradually filled with fish of all kinds, curiously exploring this newfound territory.
