# Chapter 52: Hypnosis

Li Shiming recalled the drone and replaced its battery, but instead of deploying it immediately, he chose to wait. 

From the intelligence he'd gathered, the Hao family consisted of cultivators, pre-cultivators who hadn't begun formal training, and ordinary mortals. These cultivation clans settled near the central capital partly in hopes that descendants with exceptional spiritual roots might join major sects, thereby elevating their family's status. 

The mortals living here were all direct blood descendants of the Hao family. Their duties extended beyond serving cultivators—they were also tasked with expanding the family lineage. More children meant greater chances of producing offspring with spiritual roots.

Li Shiming waited patiently for his opportunity. The cultivator gathering he'd attended in the central capital had taught him much about the cultivation world. 

He knew such cultivation families would have protective arrays in place. With his current strength, he couldn't possibly confront the Hao family's cultivators, let alone breach their defensive formations. But he understood his advantages and had formulated a plan.

Every thirty minutes, he sent out the drone to monitor the Hao compound. After a long wait, he suddenly perked up—the latest drone feed showed a heat signature approaching the main gate through his visor display.

Checking his pocket watch—4:00 AM—Li Shiming shook his head vigorously to dispel his fatigue. Through his monocular telescope, he watched as a side gate opened and a figure emerged carrying a lantern, turning right.

Cross-referencing the drone's aerial maps, Li Shiming recalled a small vegetable garden in that direction—something he'd previously dismissed as unimportant. Now it seemed his target was heading precisely there. 

With the drone keeping watch, he began moving toward the garden.

"Always picking on me. Just wait until I father a child with spiritual roots—I'll make them all pay!" Hao Jin muttered curses under his breath as he walked. 

Though a direct descendant of the Hao family, Hao Jin bore the heaviest workload among the mortals, naturally breeding resentment. His daily responsibility was preparing three meals for the family—excluding the cultivators, who consumed special spirit food prepared by others. 

As a cultivation family with many secrets, the Haos employed no outside servants, relying solely on their mortal members for all tasks.

"Don't make a sound, or you die." A cold blade pressed against Hao Jin's neck as a hoarse voice spoke behind him.

Hao Jin froze, not daring to move. Years of living among cultivators had long since eroded any martial courage he might have once possessed.

"I'm from the Hao family! My grand-uncle is a sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator!" he whispered fearfully, terrified the blade might slip if he spoke too loudly.

"Don't be foolish. I mean you no harm—I just need your help with something," Li Shiming said, keeping his voice low.

Hao Jin nodded hastily, then winced as the motion made the blade nick his neck.

"Before you help me, swallow this pill." Li Shiming pressed a black pellet near Hao Jin's mouth.

Under the sword's threat, Hao Jin swallowed the pill without protest.

"That was the Three-Day Soul-Severing Pill. Without the antidote within three days, your body will rot away. Obey me, and you'll get the antidote," Li Shiming said gravely, borrowing the exact method and even the same pill that Chief Escort Wang had once used against him.

Rather than being frightened by the ominous name, Hao Jin actually felt relieved—at least he wasn't dying immediately. As a mortal in a cultivation family, he knew cultivators could counteract even the deadliest poisons.

"Turn around and look at what I'm holding," Li Shiming commanded.

Hao Jin cautiously turned to see a black-clad figure wearing a strange face covering. When he noticed the sword in the man's hand was a magical artifact, any thought of resistance vanished. 

Though a mortal, he recognized a magic weapon when he saw one. Even the weakest artifact signified its wielder was a cultivator—and the gap between mortals and cultivators was something he understood all too well.

His gaze shifted to the object in Li Shiming's hand—a flat, circular metal pendant swinging rhythmically on a chain. Mesmerized, his eyes followed the pendulum's motion.

This was Li Shiming's first attempt at hypnosis, but his theoretical foundation was impeccable. After crafting his pocket watch, he'd researched pendulum hypnosis techniques. With his learning ability, he'd mastered the theory in short order.

Hao Jin—bullied within his family yet living alongside cultivators—had developed psychological vulnerabilities. In this world where psychology remained unexplored, no one recognized these flaws. Yet they became the cracks through which hypnosis could infiltrate his mental defenses.

Hao Jin's eyes gradually glazed over, his entire being entering a dreamlike state.

"In twenty breaths, you'll forget meeting me. These jars contain fine liquor you secretly obtained. Transport them inside without alerting anyone," Li Shiming whispered, his voice dripping with infernal persuasion.

He placed four one-meter-tall jars and a carrying pole on the ground before melting into the darkness.

Hao Jin stood motionless for exactly twenty breaths, then suddenly started at the sight of the jars. A delighted expression crossed his face as he picked up the pole and balanced two jars effortlessly—his hypnotized state granting unusual strength.

Li Shiming had already retreated to a safe distance before observing Hao Jin's progress through his telescope. Each sway of the jars made his heart race, fearing premature exposure.

At the side gate, a faint white glow flashed—the defensive array recognizing Hao Jin's identity as he carried his load inside. After depositing the first two jars by the kitchen corridor, he returned for the remaining pair.

Checking his pocket watch, Li Shiming then unfolded a massive 'starlife' material sheet to cover himself completely. Activating a 'Primary Object Manipulation Talisman', he used its energy tendrils to cover the sheet with grassy soil, burying himself completely underground before recalling the drone.
