# Chapter 81: A Different Man After Three Days Apart  

"That kid seems to have left Yichuan."  

In a cave dwelling nestled within the mountains outside the city, Princess Guo was deep in cultivation when a message talisman suddenly flew in from outside.  

The princess immediately rose to her feet, her red lips curling into a faint smile. "Excellent. I’ve finally waited for this moment."  

---  

Meanwhile, on an ancient path winding through the Yan Yun mountain range, a young man dressed in white was leisurely making his way home.  

He wasn’t in any particular hurry, taking detours here and there. Occasionally, he even sought out spirit beasts to spar with.  

Over the course of two days, Lin Shan’s storage pouch had accumulated a pile of materials—venomous fangs, snake sinews, bear paws, and tiger bones. Since his storage space was limited, he had to be selective, picking only the most useful items that could fetch a decent price when he returned to Yichuan.  

However, he also encountered formidable spirit beasts along the way. One such beast was a late Qi Refining stage Ironhide Bull, its thick hide making it incredibly resilient. It took Lin Shan immense effort to finally slay it.  

The bull’s remains—bones, tendons, organs, and membranes—were all excellent materials for talisman-making and alchemy. But what truly caught Lin Shan’s attention was its massive... appendage.  

*This thing is almost half as big as me!*  

He pondered whether to use it as a tonic or sell it for spirit stones. But before he could decide, an Iron-Crowned Eagle swooped down from the sky and snatched it away!  

Lin Shan was dumbfounded. *Since when do birds need this kind of supplement?!*  

Furious at the theft, he activated his Wind Riding Technique, drew his Cold Iron Sword, and gave chase. But the eagle soared beyond his reach at a hundred meters in the air, forcing him to abandon the pursuit.  

To his dismay, the eagle held a grudge. It followed him from above, occasionally diving down for surprise attacks. Harassed beyond endurance, Lin Shan eventually had to dive into a river to shake it off.  

But the river had its own dangers—a pack of crocodiles. Seeing a human foolishly paddling through their territory, they lunged at him with murderous intent. If not for his Cloud-Copper Heartguard Mirror, he might have been bitten in half.  

After this ordeal, Lin Shan decided to stop provoking spirit beasts and focus on traveling peacefully.  

---  

One day, as he arrived at a small stream, the babbling water and lush greenery on either side struck him as oddly familiar.  

Before he could recall why, a gray shadow flashed before his eyes.  

A dark red barrier instantly enveloped his chest, shielding him.  

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

Lin Shan was forced back three steps, his heart pounding in shock.  

*If not for the Heartguard Mirror’s automatic defense, I’d be dead!*  

Looking ahead, he saw a dagger-sized short sword hovering in the air, its blade flickering like a serpent’s tongue.  

"A flying sword?!"  

*Was I ambushed by a Foundation Establishment cultivator?*  

But he quickly dismissed the thought—a Foundation Establishment expert wouldn’t need to ambush him.  

"A talisman sword! Princess Guo!"  

Lin Shan scanned his surroundings and roared, "I know it’s you! Show yourselves!"  

After his recent rise in strength, he had begun to disregard Princess Guo and her group. Moreover, since their supposed truce, they had kept a low profile. Half a year had passed—he assumed they would have given up by now.  

But they had been patient, spending spirit stones to bide their time, lying in wait at the same ambush point from six months ago!  

"What’s wrong? Brave enough to ambush me but too cowardly to face me?"  

His voice echoed by the stream, but his spiritual senses detected no movement. Either they had concealment techniques or specialized artifacts hiding them in the trees.  

The forest remained eerily silent, as if mocking him.  

"Fine. Very well."  

Suppressing his fury, Lin Shan realized they still saw him as the same weakling from before. They thought they could take him down easily.  

*Time to show them how wrong they are.*  

With a surge of spiritual energy, he formed hand seals. A violent gale erupted behind him, shaking the pebbles by the stream and sending ripples across the water’s surface.  

"Gale—Storm—Technique!"  

Planting his feet firmly, Lin Shan thrust his hands toward the trees on either side.  

A tempest of sand and stones surged forth, bending trees and sending leaves swirling into the sky. The sheer force of his late Qi Refining cultivation snapped trunks like twigs.  

Finally, an orange barrier rose from the right side of the forest, struggling to withstand the onslaught.  

Ten breaths later, the area within ten meters of the stream was stripped bare—only stumps remained, along with an oval orange barrier shielding four figures: Princess Guo, the brocade-robed man, and two others.  

"That kid reached the late Qi Refining stage?!"  

Terror flashed in their eyes.  

---  

They had planned this ambush assuming Lin Shan was still at the mid Qi Refining stage. After all, he had spent most of his time secluded in the market, making it hard for them to gauge his progress.  

Their strategy had been flawless—ambush him with superior numbers, using the brocade-robed man’s talisman sword for a lethal first strike. Even a late Qi Refining cultivator would have been severely wounded.  

But not only had Lin Shan broken through, he also possessed a high-grade defensive artifact—something even most Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn’t afford!  

*Where did this kid get so many fortuitous encounters?!*  

Lin Shan slowly lowered his hands. The Gale Storm Technique had proven its worth, though the spiritual energy consumption was significant.  

Seeing the four cowering behind their barrier, he wasted no words. Their truce was void—they were enemies once more.  

Drawing his Cold Iron Sword, he channeled his spiritual energy and unleashed a sweeping slash.  

At the late Qi Refining stage, his power was incomparable. The sword’s icy-blue energy extended seven feet, its overwhelming force sending the four into a panic.  

"Scatter!"  

Realizing the sheer power behind the attack, they scrambled to defend themselves. Today, their ambush had backfired—survival was now their only concern.  

Some cast defensive spells, others activated talismans, and one even tried countering with a weapon. But Lin Shan’s relentless strikes shattered their defenses effortlessly.  

"None of you are leaving alive today."  

His voice was icy.  

No fancy techniques—just methodical, unstoppable slashes. A late Qi Refining cultivator wielding a premium mid-grade artifact was practically invincible among Qi Refining peers. How could four mid-stage opponents hope to stand against him?  

*I hadn’t even come for revenge, yet you dared provoke me. Who gave you the courage?!*  

As Lin Shan closed in, Princess Guo’s face flickered with a hidden glee. She produced a miniature bell—the Soulstartle Bell—and struck it with lightning-fast precision.  

*Ding—*  

Lin Shan remained unfazed.  

Panicking, she struck it harder.  

*Ding—*  

A mocking smile curled his lips.  

Refusing to believe it, she struck three more times in rapid succession.  

*Ding! Ding! Ding!*  

Still nothing.  

Lin Shan’s smirk deepened.  

*I was waiting for this.*  

A talisman he had activated earlier glowed faintly around him, its energy shielding his consciousness. The Soulstartle Bell’s attacks—transparent spikes aimed at his mind—were effortlessly deflected.  

A mere low-grade soul weapon was no match for the "Soulguard Talisman" he had purchased in Yichuan, crafted by a Foundation Establishment expert.  

But Princess Guo wasn’t the only one attacking. The talisman sword, along with a barrage of spells—ice serpents, fire pythons, and earthen spears—all converged on Lin Shan.  

Clearly, they had coordinated this assault to finish him in one strike.  

Even with the Heartguard Mirror, Lin Shan dared not take the attacks head-on. High-grade artifacts’ effectiveness depended on the user’s cultivation, and the mirror specialized in physical defense, not spells.  

Unfazed by the failed mental assault, Lin Shan calmly activated a mid-grade Water Veil Talisman. A blue barrier enveloped him, neutralizing the incoming spells with rippling resistance.  

The gray talisman sword, however, pierced through the water veil—only to be blocked once more by the Heartguard Mirror.  

"Huh? That sword has spell-piercing inscriptions?"  

Seizing the opportunity, Lin Shan lunged forward, his Cold Iron Sword clashing directly with the gray blade.  

*You think my sharpness and durability inscriptions are for show? Let’s see who breaks first!*  

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

Three crisp strikes later, the gray sword—now chipped and battered—fled back to its owner.  

The brocade-robed man stared at his ancestral talisman sword, half its edge shattered, and let out a howl of despair that echoed through the mountains.  

"My family heirloom!"
