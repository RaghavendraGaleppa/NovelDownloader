# Chapter 432: Li Mo's New Nickname and the First Forging (1/2)

The autumn water pavilion was shrouded in the quiet of night. In the boudoir on the second floor, the chill of early spring brushed against the window gauze, causing the silhouette of a woman projected by the candlelight to sway.

Ying Bing was bent over her desk, her brush flowing across the paper, leaving behind lines of elegant characters.

The first line on the paper read:

*Union of Yin and Yang.*

It was precisely the dual cultivation technique taught by Sect Master Qin, the one founded by the founder of the Joyful Sect.

This dual cultivation method required two things from its practitioners: first, the alignment of breath, and second, the fusion of spirit and will...

Wasn't this a coincidence?

The key points of the first and second layers of *Phoenix's Cry in the Heavenly Marsh* aligned perfectly with these requirements!

This meant that for her and a certain Li Mo to use it, no practice was needed; the foundational conditions had long been laid. Moreover...

They even had a matching 'training outfit.'

The two methods complemented each other perfectly and would surely allow her Great Yin Divine Will to advance by leaps and bounds...

Ying Bing sat at her desk, her eyes deep and thoughtful. Subconsciously, she glanced through the crack in the door at the room opposite—Li Mo's room.

They had practiced dual cultivation quite naturally before.

But after learning what was on Little Li's mind and having that dream...

"I have yet to perfect the Hundred Birds凰 Form."

"It is not the time yet..."

She poked the big-headed doll's head, then quickly retracted her finger as if burned. It seemed the doll now carried the warmth of a freshly forged item from the fire vein.

A moment later, the candlelight in the boudoir was extinguished, replaced by the soft glow of the Jade凰 God.

...

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Li Mo set foot on the Divine Weapon Peak. Looking back, the peaks of the Clear Abyss Sect were still clad in silver, the snow showing no sign of retreating. Spring seemed to have arrived, yet it also seemed not to have.

"Early spring is already here, but this snow is melting so slowly."

He couldn't help but sigh.

"It takes more than a single cold day to freeze three feet of ice, but once the snow begins to melt, it will only melt faster from now on," Elder Han He said with a faint smile.

The hearts of youths were prone to melancholy over the seasons. After all, Li Mo was still a young man.

But it was this young man who had brought him and Elder Zeng an increasing amount of disbelief, enough to overturn their previous understanding.

"Let's go. To the fire vein, let's see the results of your recent efforts," Elder Zeng said, rising to leave as he swallowed a Cold Spring Pill Li Mo had handed him.

"Acting as if he's your apprentice," Elder Han He grumbled resentfully. He took a few steps but then turned back, asking in confusion, "By the way, Li Mo, why don't you take some Cold Spring Pills too? Your fire energy has accumulated... it's too intense."

"...I've already taken some."

"?"

"Maybe it wasn't enough. I'll take a few more."

"???"

Watching Little Li Mo take a few more pills from the bottle as if they were candy beans, Elder Han He fell into deep thought.

It was understandable for a young man to have a strong fire energy, but...

This was just too damn strong!

It could only be described as a natural gift. No wonder a new nickname for Li Mo was gradually spreading on the Divine Weapon Peak:

Li Huowang (Li the Fiery).

The three of them arrived at the depths of the earth vein. With winter over and spring arriving, the heat here grew more and more turbulent, like the blood vessels of a giant's heart, and that giant was slowly waking from its hibernation.

In the depths of the earth vein lay a clump of silvery-white, water-like iron essence.

Though it looked like it was only enough to forge a single weapon.

That was the result of the blacksmith Li Mo, who diligently smelted iron ore every day. Adding just a sliver of it to an ordinary weapon could make it sharp enough to sever a hair.

"Back in the day, when I was an apprentice at the Heavenly Mountain Sword Furnace, it took me two years of apprenticeship and three years of practice to gather this much iron essence. In the end, it took a total of seven years," Elder Zeng said, a look of reminiscence on his face.

"I was about the same," Elder Han He shared a similar experience.

Just as a chef's apprenticeship starts with peeling potatoes, the conditions for a blacksmith's apprentice were even more stringent. They had to practice with ordinary iron ore, forging and quenching it to produce enough iron essence before they were officially qualified to forge weapons.

Yet, this kid Li Mo had accomplished in three days what had taken them years of hard labor.

Li Mo said seriously, "It is all thanks to the two elders' tireless guidance."

"Who says an apprentice, upon entering the trade, can have a master of unparalleled skill to guide them, and also get to use a founder's divine weapon?"

"Don't be so modest, kid. Those things aren't the root of it," Elder Han He said, pleased by the words but still maintaining a stern expression as he waved his hand. "Today, you shall attempt to forge your first weapon."

Elder Zeng's eyes burned with intensity. "Good!"

Li Mo walked up to the founder's anvil and took out the Forty. It was still too early for him to use the Hammer Treasure, so the Forty was a replica made in the Hammer Treasure's image, which could also be used for forging.

At the same time, a heavy, majestic Cloud Mother Cauldron with intricate patterns appeared before him.

The iron essence was placed back into the Cloud Mother Cauldron, and in the shimmering, distorted air, it gradually began to glow a bright red.

"It's time to start forging," Li Mo said, watching the temperature of the iron essence in the cauldron.

"Pay attention, Little Mo. This iron essence cools down extremely fast. You must forge it repeatedly in a very short period of time," Elder Zeng warned.

Elder Han He watched without blinking. He didn't contradict this, showing it was a共识 among all craftsmen.

The two old men were a bit nervous. They had never seen a craftsman start with iron essence for their first forging. Most people start with mundane items like farm tools or utensils.

*Haa...*

Li Mo's chest, like a bellows, drew in a breath of scorching air, and he raised the Starry Pestle in his hand.

*Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements.*

The lowest requirement it could meet was a sharp weapon.

He had already mastered it now.

*Clang—*

Sparks flew. The strike was powerful and heavy, yet the force was contained and precise, just right.

"Not bad..."

The two old men were craftsmen who had long endured the furnace's heat. They naturally saw that this strike was as light as a feather despite its weight. What was even more commendable was its precision.

He made the heavy hammer as precise as an embroidery needle.

But before their praise could land, their eyebrows suddenly shot up.

His breathing technique seemed to be...

*Clang, clang, clang—*

The sound of forging, like a great bell, was as fast as a phantom thunderclap. The shadows of the hammer even layered on top of each other!

Ten strikes.

In a single breath, he landed ten strikes, each one as precise and heavy as the last.

The入门 of Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements, the Ten-Forging Method.

While another craftsman would forge once, he was layering ten forgings into one.

*Sss...*

Smoke rose as the iron essence was rapidly quenched, then placed back into the cauldron for tempering, followed by another swift forging.

This cycle repeated four times.

The vast fire vein was now filled only with the unceasing echo of dense hammering.

"This should be the critical point for the iron essence."

"Five times!"

Li Mo felt his entire body was burning. Though he wasn't being scorched, he had the illusion that he himself was the raging fire.

In his eyes, the light of the impending blaze was indeed reflected.

*Clang—*

The final strike fell. The already formed long sword was quickly plunged into an oil barrel.

Li Mo closed his eyes, listening to the sounds from the barrel, and let out a long breath. In the end, he still shook his head slightly.

He raised the iron essence sword, his eyes scanning it. Just as he thought.

"It's still a bit of a pity..."

"Let me take a look." (x2)

Elder Han He and Elder Zeng immediately appeared beside him, taking the newly forged sword. Their expressions shifted slightly.
