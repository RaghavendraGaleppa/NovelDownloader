# Chapter 55: Mastering Divine Abilities

Hearing the voice, Zhang Yan quickly turned around.

Standing before him was a middle-aged woman dressed in palace attire. Though strikingly beautiful, her face bore an unmistakable air of sharpness.

Moreover, the woman immediately locked horns with Zhuge Wan upon arrival.

At this point, Zhang Yan had already guessed who she was—she must be from the Cuiling Sect. 

And judging by the tension, she clearly had a deep-seated grudge against his master. Otherwise, Zhuge Wan wouldn't have warned him three years ago to be wary of the Cuiling Sect.

"Well, well, if it isn't my dear senior sister from the Cuiling Sect!" Zhuge Wan's gentle demeanor instantly turned frosty upon seeing the woman, her words dripping with cold indifference.

"After all these years, you've reached the Golden Core realm, yet you're still so naive. What happened back then was approved by our master," the palace-attired woman replied with a mocking smile, enunciating each word deliberately.

"Shut up! You knew full well that the Cuiling Sect injured our master! You claimed you'd seek revenge for him, but what did you do instead? You fell for someone from the Cuiling Sect and insisted on marrying into their sect. When our master refused, you even stole his spiritual plants! When he passed, you didn't even show up. How dare you call me your junior sister now? I have no senior sister who betrayed her roots like you!"

Zhuge Wan unleashed her fury without restraint.

"Stole? I told you, those spiritual plants were a gift from our master! And of course I grieved his death—I just had urgent matters to attend to and couldn't return!" The palace-attired woman fired back, equally unyielding.

Zhang Yan and the others could only stand by meekly, keeping their heads down to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. 

It was a stark reminder that even Golden Core elders were still human, with all their passions, emotions, and tempers. Who would've thought that cultivators of such high standing could bicker like common folk? 

Zhang Yan half-wished he could gouge his own eyes out.

Fortunately, the two only exchanged a few more barbs before stopping, likely realizing how undignified they sounded. Instead, they turned their attention to each other's disciples—after all, they were here for the competition!

Unlike Zhuge Wan, the palace-attired woman had brought only one disciple: a young girl who bore a resemblance to her.

"Is this your daughter?" Zhuge Wan asked.

"Yes. Seems she takes after me—let's see how she fares," the woman replied.

Though Zhuge Wan's hostility toward the woman was palpable, her tone softened slightly when addressing the girl.

"Zhang Yan," Zhuge Wan called out.

Zhang Yan hurried over. "Master."

"Meet your martial aunt and senior sister. When it's your turn to compete, make sure to show your martial aunt what you're capable of!" Zhuge Wan instructed.

"Yes, Master!" Zhang Yan nodded firmly. He wouldn't let her down.

"Zhang Yan, since you've addressed me as your martial aunt, it's only right that I give you a gift." The palace-attired woman retrieved a shimmering object from her storage pouch—a spiritual artifact.

Zhang Yan's eyes lit up at the sight. Spiritual artifacts were incredibly valuable, typically usable only by Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Tempting as it was, he first glanced at Zhuge Wan for approval.

"Take it. She owes you that much," Zhuge Wan said with a slight nod.

"Thank you, Martial Aunt!" Zhang Yan accepted the artifact gratefully.

**[Artifact Name]**: Jade-Cutting Hoe  
**[Artifact Rank]**: Mid-Grade Spiritual Artifact  
**[Artifact Quality]**: Green  
**[Effects]**: Minor Mastery of the Divine Ability "Sow Beans as Soldiers," Advanced Plant Identification, Sharpness (Lv. 3).  

The description nearly made Zhang Yan's eyes pop out of his head. 

A divine ability? Those were techniques only cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage or above could wield! If he equipped this artifact, did that mean he could use one too?

But he resisted the urge to test it immediately. Instead, he followed Zhuge Wan to their designated resting area.

The accommodations provided by the Ten Thousand Flowers Palace were spacious, with private rooms for each participant and protective arrays to prevent spying.

Once alone in his room, Zhang Yan eagerly equipped the Jade-Cutting Hoe.

In an instant, a flood of profound knowledge surged into his mind, accompanied by an indescribable, overwhelming sense of the Dao.

The entire process lasted barely a breath, yet Zhang Yan was drenched in sweat by the end of it.

"So this is a divine ability?" he gasped. 

For that fleeting moment, he felt as though he had glimpsed the very essence of the world. Thankfully, the sensation faded as quickly as it came—any longer, and it might have killed him.

"Sow Beans as Soldiers..." 

He pulled out a single grain of spirit rice. 

The moment it appeared, the silly bird hiding in his sleeve darted out, trying to snatch it.

"Get lost!" Zhang Yan smacked the bird away and tossed the grain into the air.

As he did, his spiritual energy drained in an instant, leaving him completely depleted.

"Damn it!" he cursed.

The divine ability was terrifyingly demanding—just a casual attempt had sucked him dry. Not a drop of energy remained in his body.

Still, despite the exhaustion, the technique had worked.

"So this is 'Sow Beans as Soldiers'?" Zhang Yan stared at the tiny rice figurine in his palm, torn between laughter and frustration.

The ability had succeeded... sort of.

Legends spoke of "Sow Beans as Soldiers" conjuring armies of powerful warriors with a single wave. Yet Zhang Yan's version had produced only a three-inch-tall rice puppet, barely at the Qi Refinement Stage (4th Layer), and utterly mindless, awaiting his commands.

"A mid-Qi Refinement puppet isn't even as strong as me!" 

He felt cheated. All his Qi Refinement (5th Layer) energy for a weaker, dumber minion? 

Did the laws of energy conservation apply even in cultivation?

Still, despite its shortcomings, Zhang Yan couldn't help but marvel. Equipping a spiritual artifact had granted him a divine ability!

"Too bad I can't actually learn these abilities..." 

While the Equipment Frame let him wield the techniques, he couldn't internalize them—only perceive their underlying principles.

"But what if I combine this with that other spell I know?" 

A slow smile spread across his face as a realization struck him. 

He might just be unstoppable now.
