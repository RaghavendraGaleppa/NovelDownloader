# Chapter 47: The Tide

Han Yue planned to set off in seven days.  

He intended to use this final week to complete his travel preparations.  

Money was no object for Han Yue. He spent a full thousand mid-grade spirit stones, instructing Xiao Qing to prepare a complete set of high-quality items and tools he might need for his journey.  

This included convenient and practical magical cookware and cauldrons, a portable two-story cottage with complete furnishings for comfortable living in the wild, a magical flask capable of producing clean drinking water, various first-grade garments and robes (though their defensive capabilities were negligible for Han Yue now, they excelled in aesthetics and modesty), as well as an assortment of antidotes and healing elixirs.  

The trading house was undoubtedly highly professional in handling such arrangements, offering not only a comprehensive selection of goods but also excellent value for money.  

These items effectively filled the remaining space in Han Yue’s [Silver Hairpin] and significantly enhanced the comfort of his upcoming journey.  

Over the next few days, aside from his daily accumulation of mana, Han Yue did not devote excessive energy to cultivation.  

After entering the third stage of perfection in *Body-Nourishing Thunder*, the time required to condense each thunder rune had greatly increased.  

Based on his current progress, achieving the third stage of perfection was expected to take twenty years—a long and arduous journey.  

His spare time was spent catching up with old friends in Courtyard Nine.  

After several years of companionship, Han Yue had developed strong bonds with the residents of Courtyard Nine. Much of his sense of belonging to Fenrouji stemmed from their acceptance and support.  

As fellow cultivators, they took Han Yue’s departure in stride, though they lamented losing a steadfast companion on the path of cultivation.  

Xiao Liu, undoubtedly the closest to Han Yue, was still young. During these critical years of his growth, he had relied heavily on Han Yue’s guidance and assistance, forging a deeper bond than with anyone else in the courtyard.  

Since advancing to the Foundation Establishment stage, Xiao Liu had progressed rapidly, mastering a two-meter-long polearm with impressive skill.  

He had now become a core member of Courtyard Nine’s hunting team and had even taken over Han Yue’s role as the meat distributor during the Fenrou Festival, officially carrying on his father’s legacy.  

With the growth of Fang Yi and Xiao Liu’s strength, the hunting team could now easily take down first-grade demonic beasts.  

Their hunting income over the past six months had more than tripled compared to before Han Yue joined.  

Though it paled in comparison to Han Yue’s earnings, life was steadily improving, and morale was high.  

Xiao Liu was the most reluctant to see Han Yue leave. At every farewell dinner, he insisted on drinking Han Yue under the table.  

But the disparity in cultivation and physique meant it was always Xiao Liu who ended up drunk.  

On this particular evening, the residents of Courtyard Nine gathered as usual, drinking and feasting to bid Han Yue farewell.  

It was already their third consecutive night of revelry, yet their spirits remained undimmed.  

Just as the cups were clinking and the atmosphere was at its liveliest, an unusual tremor rippled through the ground.  

As cultivators, everyone present was highly sensitive to their surroundings and immediately noticed the anomaly.  

The tremors persisted, growing increasingly violent—unlike any ordinary earthquake.  

Instead, it felt like something massive was rhythmically pounding the earth.  

After another half-minute, the tremors intensified further.  

At the same time, countless alarm talismans were activated, lighting up the western sky above Fenrouji with dazzling fireworks.  

Accompanying the fireworks was a deafening roar—the collective cry of countless beasts.  

Han Yue immediately took to the skies, flying westward, only to be stunned by the sight before him.  

An endless tide of demonic beasts was charging toward Fenrouji, their stampede generating a thunderous cacophony.  

The beast tide swept forward like a storm, catching everyone off guard.  

In the outermost districts—the Earth and Mystic Zones—many compounds had already spotted the rapidly approaching beasts and were frantically launching alarm fireworks.  

Han Yue swiftly descended and relayed the situation to the others in Courtyard Nine.  

Fang Yi reacted decisively, barking orders:  

"Everyone, armor up immediately!"  

"Foundation Establishment cultivators and above—follow me to the front lines!"  

"The rest of you, hold the fort! Activate the defensive formations and deploy the [King Hunter Ballista]! Don’t hold back on ammunition—fire at will!"  

The group responded in unison and sprang into action.  

As seasoned hunters, their combat instincts were razor-sharp. No one questioned the cause of the beast tide—everyone knew the priority was to repel it.  

Soon, the entire courtyard was fully equipped, transforming into a band of heavily armored warriors.  

Who would have guessed that moments ago, these same people had been drinking and joking?  

Under Fang Yi’s command, a massive ballista slowly rose from beneath the training ground, ascending to a height of nearly five hundred meters.  

This was the [King Hunter Ballista]—a siege weapon with power rivaling second-grade artifacts.  

With a range exceeding thirty kilometers, it could cover the entire western battlefield of Fenrouji.  

While the Foundation Establishment cultivators joined the fight, the remaining members of Courtyard Nine focused on operating the ballista.  

Han Yue took to the skies again and saw that many other compounds had reached the same conclusion as Courtyard Nine.  

Numerous cultivators, now fully armed, were rushing toward the front lines.  

Meanwhile, heavy artillery—primarily giant bows and ballistae, interspersed with blades, axes, swords, and mirrors—was being deployed across Fenrouji.  

With a population of a hundred thousand cultivators, Fenrouji was a formidable force when mobilized.  

Civilians were also being evacuated. From above, Han Yue saw streams of people pouring out of the compounds, orderly retreating eastward along the roads.  

Despite the chaos, the entire settlement remained disciplined.  

Han Yue flew alongside Fang Yi toward the front lines.  

Nearly a hundred second-stage cultivators had taken to the skies—far fewer than Han Yue had expected.  

The stampede of demonic beasts shook the earth violently, their massive bodies causing buildings near the front to tremble.  

From his vantage point, Han Yue could see that the beast tide included a disproportionate number of second-grade demonic beasts—far outnumbering the second-stage cultivators.  

Finally, the beasts crashed into Fenrouji.  

They hurled themselves at buildings, streets, and people with reckless abandon, heedless of their own lives.  

Hundreds of pre-positioned war machines unleashed their payloads simultaneously.  

A storm of mana rained down on the charging horde.  

The first wave of beasts met the scythe of death, their bodies torn apart in explosions of gore.  

Under the cover of the artillery, the human cultivators on the front lines began picking off the beasts that broke through.  

The battle had begun in earnest.  

Yet deep beneath the battlefield, unnoticed by anyone, a surge of mana was tunneling toward the heart of Fenrouji.
