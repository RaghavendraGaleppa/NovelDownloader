# Chapter 129: The Spirit Seed Appears

Not far to his left, Luo Hongping sat upright. The two had even greeted each other earlier. When Meng Zhenggong had left some disciples behind earlier, Chu Ning had thought he was clearing out people from the Yin Demon Sect. But after seeing Luo Hongping, who was in the same group, he dismissed that idea.

"It's quite strange that these Yin Demon Sect disciples were allowed to participate in this grand formation so easily." All sorts of thoughts spun in Chu Ning's mind. Unfortunately, he couldn't find an answer now.

After observing for a while and finding nothing special to do, Chu Ning felt a subtle sense of boredom. He then sat cross-legged and began to cultivate. Undoubtedly, participating in this array operation would affect his cultivation. Both body refinement and spirit refinement would be inconvenient, though body refinement might still be possible. However, under the gaze of so many people, Chu Ning wouldn't take Spirit Yuan Pills to cultivate. Thus, Chu Ning could only cultivate the Evergreen Wood Longevity Art using the most basic method, without any enhancements.

"Fortunately, the spiritual energy here is quite dense. If I cultivate diligently every day, given my absorption speed, an increase of 1 to 2 points daily is highly probable." With that thought, Chu Ning began to circulate the Evergreen Wood Longevity Art.

As time passed, people in this group slowly began to take turns casting spells. This was mainly due to disciples at Qi Condensation Level 6 and 7; their lower cultivation naturally meant their spiritual power wasn't as profound. Since only one person rotated at a time, the impact wasn't significant, so the requirements weren't as high as before. However, whenever someone rotated, either the cultivator surnamed Yan or the one surnamed Liu, both at Qi Condensation Completion, would always be directing, ensuring no mistakes were made.

After exiting his cultivation state, Chu Ning also observed the rotation situation. He now noticed that the personnel arrangements were clearly meticulously planned. For instance, he, currently at Qi Condensation Level 6, was paired with a Qi Condensation Level 9 cultivator. Some at Qi Condensation Level 8 were paired with Qi Condensation Level 7 cultivators who had entered the Spirit Domain earlier. This indeed ensured that the overall two-person casting time for each group remained roughly the same, preventing any single team from frequently changing casters.

"Chu Ning, prepare to replace the caster." After roughly three and a half hours inside the grand formation, a spiritual message suddenly sounded in Chu Ning's ear. It was from the cultivator surnamed Yan. Upon hearing it, Chu Ning immediately extended his palm, circulating the Evergreen Wood Longevity Art. His gaze also went to Wang Weizhong opposite him. After seeing the other party nod slightly at him, Chu Ning swiftly pressed his palm onto the stone pillar.

At the same time, Wang Weizhong's hand quickly withdrew. Spiritual power flowed into the stone pillar. Immediately, Chu Ning felt the power being transmitted through the pillar to the mountain peak below where he and the others were located. However, once the spiritual power passed the base of the stone pillar, Chu Ning could no longer sense it.

"The spiritual power required by this stone pillar isn't actually strong. If I used my true spiritual power, sustaining it for three to four hours shouldn't be a problem. However, I've only revealed my Qi Condensation Level 6 cultivation, so I'll need to be replaced after at most an hour and a half." Chu Ning made his judgment, turning his head slightly. He saw Wang Weizhong had already taken out and swallowed a Spirit Recovery Pill, and was now cultivating to recuperate. Chu Ning immediately felt relieved. With Wang Weizhong's Qi Condensation Level 9 cultivation, even without a Spirit Recovery Pill, this amount of time would be enough to recover spiritual power, let alone with the aid of the pill.

However, it was also because the cultivator surnamed Yan and his counterparts had demands; otherwise, most people wouldn't need to use Spirit Recovery Pills. For instance, Wang Weizhong had just cast spells for four hours. Even if Chu Ning were at Qi Condensation Level 6, there would naturally be enough time to recover his spiritual power. Chu Ning calculated the approximate time and spiritual power consumption. When it was nearing an hour and a half, he immediately signaled for a replacement. Then, under the direction of the cultivator surnamed Yan, he swapped places with Wang Weizhong again.

In the following time, Chu Ning and the others repeated this cycle. The first one or two days were naturally fine, but as time passed, by the third day, many people already felt a hint of fatigue. For Qi Condensation Level 6 disciples, the consumption of spiritual sense and mental exhaustion from such high-intensity and frequent casting and recovery was undoubtedly immense. The cultivators surnamed Yan and Liu naturally saw all this. Looking at the quiescent stream of light below, they frowned. Then, the two began sending spiritual messages to different people, one by one.

"Chu Ning, have you recovered your spiritual power? If so, go ahead and sleep for a while. I'll call you when it's time to rotate." The voice of the cultivator surnamed Yan sounded in Chu Ning's ear. He nodded slightly, stopped circulating his cultivation art, and lay directly on the ground beside him to rest. In truth, Chu Ning wasn't as fatigued as other Qi Condensation Level 6 disciples. After all, his actual spiritual power had reached Qi Condensation Level 8, and his spiritual sense was also stronger than everyone else's here. Moreover, even if he were tired, cultivating spirit refinement techniques would undoubtedly be the most effective for him. But to blend in, he still chose to sleep as instructed.

After sleeping for several hours, Chu Ning was called awake again by the cultivator surnamed Yan. Chu Ning sat up. Soon, the voice of the cultivator surnamed Yan came again. "Circulate your cultivation art to adjust your state. Prepare to replace in the time it takes for an incense stick to burn."

For the next few days, Chu Ning, like everyone else, repeated these tasks: casting spells to drive the array, cultivating to recuperate, and sleeping. Ten days passed in a flash. At this moment, Chu Ning could clearly feel the somewhat restless atmosphere around him. Unlike high-level cultivators who might seclude themselves for years or even decades, Qi Condensation period disciples, whether in terms of cultivation realm or mental state, couldn't reach that intensity. Being confined to one place without moving for ten consecutive days, even with the ability to cultivate and rest, was a torment for many. However, within these ten days, Chu Ning also noticed that the stream of light emanating from underground seemed to have intensified. It was as if something was about to fly out from within that light.

"Everyone, cast spells and cultivate with peace of mind. Before long, the Spirit Seed will appear. You all have contributed to the sect, and the sect will not treat you unfairly! It's best not to harbor any other thoughts, or else..." The cultivator surnamed Yan chose not to use spiritual transmission this time, but spoke aloud so everyone could clearly hear him. These words were a mix of carrot and stick.

Just as the cultivator surnamed Yan spoke these words, the cultivator surnamed Liu, who had left earlier, arrived at the back of the group with another person. Seeing this person arrive, the cultivator surnamed Yan's figure suddenly flickered, appearing next to someone who had just completed their rotation and was preparing to meditate. Immediately, under the astonished gaze of the person, a golden light flared in the hand of the cultivator surnamed Yan, which then struck directly on top of the person's head. This Qi Condensation Level 6 cultivator didn't even have time to react before he instantly perished.

"Slacking off, this is your fate!" As he spoke these words, the cultivator surnamed Yan's gaze swept coldly over several people. The previously restless and agitated crowd immediately settled down. The cultivator surnamed Yan threw the disciple's corpse to the back, while the newly arrived Qi Condensation Level 6 disciple now sat in the previous person's position. Only now did Chu Ning realize that those disciples who hadn't been called upon earlier were actually reserves, ready to step in at any time. Chu Ning could think of this point, and others naturally could too. Considering that among the remaining dozens of people, there were individuals of various cultivation realms, including Qi Condensation Level 9 and Qi Condensation Completion, this move was clearly also telling everyone that not a single person present was indispensable.

As for those unable to play a role in driving the array, their fate was already sealed. Although everyone was somewhat stunned by such a cruel and ruthless act, with the cultivator surnamed Yan's tactic of 'killing the chicken to scare the monkeys,' everything within the mountain peak returned to normal. For the next few days, everyone honestly and continuously rotated in driving the formation.

Soon, another five days passed. By this time, Chu Ning and the others had been in the Spirit Domain for a month and a half, and had been operating the formation for half a month. On the periphery of the Spirit Domain, several Golden Core stage cultivators were still standing guard. The only difference was that originally there were five people here, but now there were four. The plump Elder Xie, the red-robed cultivator Elder Gui, the dark-faced old man Elder Zhu, and the silver-haired old woman Elder Mu were all present. Only the taciturn old man in green robes was absent. The four Golden Core cultivators each sat cross-legged on a stone, all with their eyes closed in meditation.

At this moment, the plump Elder Xie suddenly opened his eyes and slowly spoke: "This batch of disciples has been inside for a month and a half, haven't they?" As soon as he spoke, the other three also opened their eyes one after another.

"Indeed, it has been a month and a half." The silver-haired old woman glanced at the forbidden zone, a hint of concern flashing across her face. "According to the plan, the Five Elements Qiankun Array should have been switched to driving wood-attribute spiritual power for half a month now. I wonder what the situation is like."

Hearing the silver-haired old woman's words, the plump Elder Xie chuckled: "Why worry, Elder Mu? Your junior must have brought many good things with them. Even if there's a spiritual essence outburst, they surely have enough means to resist it."

"That's true," the silver-haired old woman didn't deny her protective measures, continuing, "but we don't know the exact power of the spiritual essence outburst when the Spirit Seed appears."

The red-robed old man also joined the conversation at this moment, looking at the forbidden area with an expectant expression. "To be fortunate enough to witness a Spirit Seed acquisition in this life is truly not in vain. The last time we heard news of someone acquiring a Spirit Seed was over a hundred years ago."

The red-robed Elder Gui also slowly said at this moment: "Indeed, after the spiritual energy within a Spirit Seed is absorbed, it will lie dormant for at least several hundred years before reappearing. It's rare even to hear about it, let alone have the chance to witness it."

"It's also strange to say, this Spirit Seed is clearly formed from spiritual energy, but why can't it be refined? I've heard that after the spiritual energy inside is absorbed, it will go into dormancy." The plump Elder Xie marveled. However, his words received no response from the others. Clearly, no one had an answer to that question.

"Elder Yang is back!" Just then, their gazes turned in one direction. As the silver-haired old woman Elder Mu's words fell, a green-robed figure appeared before the four of them. It was precisely the taciturn green-robed elder who had previously helped them break the array. He didn't speak after arriving, merely nodded slightly towards everyone as a greeting. Then he flew directly to a stone and sat down cross-legged as well.

"Elder Yang, is the Sect Master not coming personally?" The plump Elder Xie was the first to speak. The green-robed old man nodded, then added: "The Sect Master's intention is for me to stay here and oversee things with you. He'll remain in charge of the sect. He will naturally rush over when the Spirit Seed appears." Speaking of which, the green-robed Elder Yang looked at the red-robed Elder Gui. "Elder Gui, according to the disciples who came out of the Spirit Domain earlier, your youngest disciple, Shang Rui, was initially thought to have also acquired spiritual essence. But he didn't come out of the Spirit Domain with them later, which is a bit strange."

The red-robed Elder Gui was slightly startled upon hearing this, then sighed: "Then he probably didn't acquire it. This disciple has Fire-Wood Earth Spirit Roots, has always had quite a few fortuitous encounters, and strong comprehension ability. If he could have acquired spiritual essence, his future achievements might even surpass those of his senior and junior brothers. But since he didn't come out with them, he probably didn't acquire it."

The plump old man chuckled upon hearing this: "Indeed, during these two spiritual essence outbursts, it's most suitable for disciples to acquire spiritual essence. They won't have to be confined to the inner sect like those earlier disciples."

The silver-haired old woman Elder Mu sighed softly at this moment: "I hope we can succeed in one fell swoop this time. For this Spirit Seed, our Qingxi Sect has sacrificed truly too much over decades. Especially the low-level disciples in the sect, too many have sacrificed their lives. Not to mention others, just us here. The Sect Master's disciples have entered the most, and among everyone present, who hasn't had a few disciples perish within?" As these words were spoken, everyone fell silent. Perhaps they didn't care that much about ordinary low-level disciples. But over these decades, they had indeed all had disciples enter the Spirit Domain, whether a few or many. Some were due to the sect's needs and there was no other way, as even Sect Master Xin Wuyai had sent many of his own direct disciples inside, so they naturally couldn't refuse. And at other times, they themselves had harbored the thought of letting their disciples seek out some fortuitous opportunities within.

The outside of the Spirit Domain quieted down, while inside the Spirit Domain at this moment, it was another scene entirely.

"What's going on? How is the spiritual light of this Spirit Seed overflowing beyond the Five Elements Qiankun Array?"
"Is the Spirit Seed about to appear?"

On the periphery of the array-setting location, where thatched huts had been built, disciples cultivating other attribute cultivation arts all walked out of their homes. Everyone looked at the array-setting location with expressions of shock and uncertainty. Before this, the spiritual light of the Spirit Seed could only be seen within the array. Even from such a close distance, not a trace could be seen. When everyone realized this, many showed a hint of wild joy on their faces. Some even started moving towards the array-setting location.

But just as a few people left the residential area and were about to head towards the array-setting location, dozens of cultivators, dressed in unified sect robes with solemn and icy expressions, suddenly appeared. These people were all composed of disciples above Qi Condensation Level 9, and the leader was, surprisingly, a disciple at Qi Condensation Completion.

"Law Enforcement Hall." Seeing these dozens of people appear, the few who were moving immediately stopped, a hint of fear appearing on their faces. Clearly, these dozens of Law Enforcement Hall cultivators had considerable deterrent power among the crowd. The few immediately turned around and walked back.

"Everyone remain in the residential area. Those who leave without permission will be killed without mercy!" The cold words of the leading Qi Condensation Completion cultivator reached everyone's ears, and no disciple dared to trespass again. However, everyone's gaze was still fixed on the array-setting location.

And at this moment, inside the formation. Whether they were injecting spiritual power into the stone pillars to drive the formation or resting, all had expressions of excitement on their faces. The flourishing stream of light was visible even from the outside; how could they not see it?

On the mountain where Chu Ning and the others were located, the cultivators surnamed Yan and Liu exchanged glances, a hint of joy appearing on their faces. But soon, both returned to normal. "Stay calm, continue driving the formation, do not stop." The voice of the cultivator surnamed Yan rang out at this moment, causing everyone with unusual expressions to not dare make any movements.

Chu Ning watched all this in surprise, his eyes constantly flickering. He, of course, had also realized that the Spirit Seed was likely about to appear. Moreover, as everyone's spiritual power continuously poured into the stone pillars, the stream of light grew brighter and brighter. Faintly, a cluster of green light seemed to emerge within this flowing light.

About another hour passed like this.

"Chu Ning, prepare to rotate." Chu Ning suddenly heard the voice of the cultivator surnamed Yan. He turned his head, only to see a faint, almost imperceptible wisp of white steam emerging from Wang Weizhong's forehead. It seemed as if sweat beads were about to form at any moment. This clearly indicated a state of extreme spiritual power depletion. This made Chu Ning reveal a strange look; he hadn't seen this senior brother push himself so hard before. Clearly, seeing that the Spirit Seed was about to appear, he wanted to keep driving the formation. "Is there some hidden meaning here?"

Chu Ning felt some doubt in his heart, but his hand had already gathered spiritual power and extended. Then, after Wang Weizhong nodded somewhat reluctantly, Chu Ning immediately placed his hand on the stone pillar, completing the personnel replacement. Only at this moment did the cultivator surnamed Yan cast a cold glance at Wang Weizhong before looking away. He now realized it was a critical moment and kept his gaze fixed on everyone's every move, not even looking at the stream of light below. Under his supervision, although a few people, like Wang Weizhong, wanted to force themselves to endure, they were still compelled to swap out.

In the blink of an eye, another hour passed. The green stream of light from underground became increasingly dazzling, almost reflecting a green hue onto everyone's faces. And at this moment, everyone also saw it. That green light cluster, resembling a seed, had roughly emerged from underground, appearing as if it could break through the earth at any moment.

Just as everyone thought they only needed one more push to complete it, suddenly, the green stream of light intensified greatly, directly impacting the grand green light pillar of the formation. The grand green light pillar instantly collapsed, and the green light previously emitted from the five mountain peaks in the air also disintegrated instantly, rebounding back. It transformed into streaks of green light, flying towards each of the mountain peaks. Faintly, it seemed that several streaks of light, before these green lights collapsed, followed them and plunged into the five mountain peaks. At the same time, the green light cluster beneath the stream of light soared into the sky, rapidly flying upwards.
