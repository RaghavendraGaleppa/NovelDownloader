# Chapter 55: Rent-Free Renewal  

"Senior Brother Gu Mo!"  

"Senior Brother Gu Mo!"  

...  

On his way from the spirit fields to the Spirit Planting Hall, Gu Mo passed by plots that had once been empty but were now bustling with laboring outer disciples. As he walked, they greeted him respectfully.  

This reception spoke volumes about Gu Mo's standing among the outer disciples. After all, who wouldn't respect a senior brother who took the time to offer guidance?  

Hearing their greetings, Gu Mo couldn't help but reflect on how he had become something of a veteran in the Spirit Planting Hall. He arrived at the storage warehouse with practiced ease, only to hear a familiar voice call out.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, long time no see!"  

Turning, Gu Mo saw Mai Yunfa walking toward him.  

"Brother Mai, are you here to register your harvest too?" Gu Mo responded warmly, showing rare enthusiasm for one of the few acquaintances he had in the hall.  

"Heh, that's right. This time, I managed to cultivate several acres of Cloudwood Grass," Mai Yunfa replied with a pleased smile. For outer disciples of the Spirit Planting Hall, aside from advancing their cultivation, nothing brought greater joy than successfully growing rare spirit plants.  

The Cloudwood Grass he mentioned was a mid-tier first-grade spirit plant. Despite its name suggesting grass, it resembled wood and could be used as fast-growing spirit timber for alchemy or fuel.  

"Congratulations on your bountiful harvest this year, Brother Mai," Gu Mo said with a smile. The higher the value of the spirit plants harvested, the greater the cultivator's rewards.  

"Haha, it's nothing. You're the impressive one, Junior Brother Gu Mo. An 800-jin yield per acre of Spirit Jade Rice isn't something just anyone can achieve. I wonder if you'll manage another miracle this time." Mai Yunfa still vividly remembered Gu Mo's record-breaking yield, something he himself couldn't replicate.  

From his words, it was clear Mai Yunfa didn't yet know about Gu Mo's cultivation of Water Spirit Rice. Only the seed distribution steward and Zhao Qiancheng were aware, and since they weren't certain Gu Mo would succeed, they had kept it quiet.  

As they spoke, the two arrived at the registration counter. Gu Mo handed over his outer disciple token.  

"Disciple Gu Mo, state the type of spirit plant you wish to register," the storage steward asked routinely, already preparing to write "Spirit Jade Rice" on the ledger—he had been the one to report Gu Mo's previous record.  

"Water Spirit Rice," Gu Mo declared.  

"What kind of rice?" The steward looked up, startled. He thought he had misheard—it definitely wasn't Spirit Jade Rice.  

---  

"It's Water Spirit Rice, Elder," Gu Mo confirmed, producing a stalk of the rice as proof.  

This steward wasn't the one who had distributed the seeds, so he had no knowledge of Gu Mo's experiment.  

"Tsk—"  

The moment Gu Mo revealed the Water Spirit Rice stalk, two sharp intakes of breath echoed—one from the steward, the other from Mai Yunfa.  

Both men were well-acquainted with Water Spirit Rice and its notorious difficulty to cultivate. That was precisely why they were so shocked.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, you... you..." Mai Yunfa stammered, disbelief written across his face. Water Spirit Rice was a high-tier first-grade spirit plant that even he couldn't cultivate yet. Yet Gu Mo, who had only been a disciple for just over two years, had succeeded.  

The gap between people was truly staggering.  

"It seems your Minor Cloud Rain Technique has reached the Mastery stage."  

Another voice cut in. Gu Mo turned and immediately bowed. "Greetings, Steward Zhao!"  

Zhao Qiancheng had arrived upon hearing of Gu Mo's registration. He already knew what spirit plant Gu Mo was here to report.  

"Now, let's see your yield," Zhao Qiancheng said, gesturing for Gu Mo to present his harvest.  

Gu Mo flicked his sleeve, revealing the full bounty of Water Spirit Rice stalks. The steward placed them into a specialized artifact, and moments later, gleaming, translucent spirit rice grains appeared.  

"300 jin!"  

With just a glance, the steward estimated the yield.  

"Excellent, excellent!"  

Delight flashed in Zhao Qiancheng's eyes. A 300-jin yield of Water Spirit Rice was no small feat. Without exaggeration, this harvest alone would ensure his evaluation remained at least "Good" this year, even if the Spirit Jade Rice yield declined further.  

Compared to the abundant but often surplus Spirit Jade Rice, high-tier spirit rice like Water Spirit Rice was what the sect truly valued.  

Such premium rice was always in high demand, so the sect weighted its contribution heavily. A few hundred extra jin of Water Spirit Rice far outweighed thousands—or even tens of thousands—of Spirit Jade Rice in importance.  

"Steward Zhao, may I keep 100 jin for myself?" Gu Mo asked quickly upon hearing Zhao Qiancheng intended to claim the entire harvest.  

"Of course!"  

Zhao Qiancheng coughed lightly, suddenly remembering that all 300 jin technically belonged to Gu Mo—his field was still in its rent-free period.  

---  

However, that exemption would expire in half a year. Seizing the opportunity, Zhao Qiancheng made an offer.  

"Gu Mo, if you can submit 200 jin of Water Spirit Rice annually, your field's rent-free status will be extended indefinitely. Moreover, those 200 jin will still earn you sect contribution points as usual."  

"Many thanks for Steward Zhao's generosity!"  

Gu Mo's eyes lit up. Submitting 200 jin to maintain rent-free status was an incredible deal, and earning contribution points on top of that? This arrangement surpassed the benefits many regular inner disciples received.  

Even inner disciples had to pay steep field rents unless they possessed exceptional skills.  

"The Spirit Planting Hall rewards talent generously. If you can maintain this output, I'll personally recommend you for inner disciple status," Zhao Qiancheng added, dangling an even greater prize.  

Nearby, Mai Yunfa couldn't help but feel a pang of envy—he had never seen Steward Zhao speak so warmly to any disciple.  

"This disciple will strive diligently!"  

Gu Mo bowed deeply, surprised that inner disciple status was now within reach. With his current abilities, maintaining a steady 300-jin yield of Water Spirit Rice wouldn't be difficult.  

As his identity token registered an additional 2,000 contribution points, Gu Mo completed the registration. While Spirit Jade Rice only earned 1 point per jin, Water Spirit Rice was worth 10. Those 200 jin alone had netted him 2,000 points.  

If he submitted his remaining 100 jin, he could instantly reach 3,000 points—enough to exchange for the Concealing Qi Art he had long coveted.  

In that moment, Gu Mo deeply understood how much his growing strength had changed his circumstances. What would have taken three years of farming to save up before, he could now achieve in a single season of Water Spirit Rice cultivation.
