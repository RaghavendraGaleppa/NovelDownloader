**Chapter 4: Seeking Trouble? One Move Solves It!**

In the classroom, Su Yu listened to the teacher's lecture, bored. At this moment, his mind was not on the class at all, but drifted to the martial artist assessment.

"Only by passing the martial artist assessment can one officially participate in the selection for martial arts academies. Only by entering a martial arts academy can one truly change their life!" This sentence had spread thoroughly throughout the Great Xia region. Countless people, therefore, wanted to become martial artists, wanting to enter martial arts academies. Only this way could they turn their lives around! This was also considered the only way to escape an ordinary life in this world where martial arts reigned supreme.

As a transmigrator, Su Yu naturally wanted to pursue higher realms and did not want to die in vain like in his previous life.

Time flowed by as Su Yu's thoughts wandered. Soon, the bell for dismissal rang. Su Yu didn't hesitate, picked up his backpack, and prepared to go to the Martial Artist Association to take the assessment.

Just then, a brawny young man appeared at the classroom door. The young man's muscles seemed about to explode, making him appear extremely robust. Every movement was filled with power. The young man walked to the door and, ignoring the teacher still in the classroom, roared, "Who's Su Yu? Get out here!"

Like a tiger, his voice echoed throughout the entire classroom.

Li Hu quickly stood up from his seat, pointed at Su Yu in the corner, and said, "He's waiting for you at the school gate!"

On the podium, the teacher looked at Su Yu with some worry and said, "Su Yu, this Li Long is one of the school's top prospects. How did you offend him? And you, Li Hu, can't you talk some sense into your elder brother?"

Li Hu sneered and said, "I listen to my big brother!"

The teacher sighed in helplessness, but then saw Su Yu pick up his backpack and walk out. Inside the classroom, some students who loved to watch drama also followed suit.

"How did Su Yu offend Li Hu? He even dared to extort him! Doesn't he know Li Hu is vindictive?"

"Sigh, it's probably Li Long's doing. Li Long is a famous figure at Hengcheng No. 1 High School now, and he already passed the quasi-martial artist assessment long ago. His qi and blood must have surpassed the standard!"

"Offending Li Long, it seems Su Yu's days ahead won't be easy."

Su Yu walked leisurely towards the school gate. He didn't take Li Long's threats seriously at all. Perfect, since he had just broken through to become a martial artist, he could use Li Long to test his current strength. It was quite a good option.

At the school gate, Li Long's mere presence radiated a sharp pressure onto the students leaving school.

"Isn't that Li Long? What's he doing here? Could it be that some fool without eyes offended Li Long?"

"Hiss, as expected of Li Long. That punch probably has almost seven hundred kilograms of force, right? It seems Li Long isn't far from becoming a true martial artist."

"This kid is going to have a hard time. Seven hundred kilograms of force is like being hit by a small car. If he doesn't dodge, he's in for some serious pain."

"Wait, what is that kid trying to do?" Someone gasped in surprise.

Everyone looked over, only to see Su Yu actually confront Li Long's punch head-on, his seemingly small fist slamming directly into Li Long's.

"He actually wants to go head-to-head with Li Long!" Someone exclaimed in astonishment.

"Hmph, daring to match strength with strength, I think this guy's brain is completely fried. Come on, let's go, there's nothing good to see here, just a senseless fool."

Some scoffed, some were surprised, and some sneered. But in the next moment, everyone's expressions changed.
