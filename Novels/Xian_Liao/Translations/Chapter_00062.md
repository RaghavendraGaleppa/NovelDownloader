# Chapter 62: Advancement of the Literary Core

Having spent years between Jiangcheng and the mountains, Zhou Qing hadn't deeply felt the changes in the outside world until he witnessed several ruined villages and long-abandoned temples along the road. Only then did he truly realize how much worse the world had deteriorated than he had imagined.

In truth, the refugees who managed to reach Jiangzhou City could be considered fortunate. Many others like them had perished along the way.

"Refugees—can they even be called human anymore?" Head Escort Wu sighed. He mentioned that when escorting goods north, he had passed through several provinces over hundreds of miles. In the villages along the way, he never heard the crow of a rooster, and there were even unburied bones by the roadside, long dead and forgotten.

"Actually, the most terrifying thing isn't famine—it's plague."

Plague?

Zhou Qing felt a stirring in his heart. He realized he should do something.

Ancient texts in this world, including the *Huichun Talisman Manual*, contained methods to treat plagues, but they were scattered and unsystematic. Discussions about plagues were rough and lacked detail, often leading to misinterpretations unless one was a skilled physician.

In Zhou Qing's mind surfaced Zhang Zhongjing's *Treatise on Cold Damage* from the late Eastern Han Dynasty, Wu Youke's *Treatise on Pestilence* from the late Ming Dynasty, along with his previous life's knowledge of epidemic prevention and related miscellaneous texts. Theories and case studies from the *Huichun Talisman Manual* also emerged in his thoughts...

All the knowledge he understood about the subject coalesced into a unified whole.

Each escort agency, through years of experience, had its own maps of frequently traveled routes, knowing which areas were dangerous and which were unfamiliar. Head Escort Wu was cautious by nature, and this time, before nightfall, the group settled in Panshi City, dozens of miles from Taihe Mountain.

Panshi City was once prosperous. Recently, however, it had been struck by plague, and the entire city was quieter than usual, shrouded in an inexplicable panic...

Seeing this, Zhou Qing began compiling his knowledge about plagues. He took out brush, ink, and paper and, under the oil lamp, began drafting an article. He used concise, straightforward language to avoid ambiguity, writing down his understanding of plagues.

He wrote until dawn before finishing. He then read it repeatedly, refining the wording and removing potentially controversial content. Writing books in ancient times was no easy task—not only could they be nitpicked, but they could also be reported, endangering one's life. Thus, making texts obscure and cryptic was sometimes unavoidable.

Fortunately, Zhou Qing's writing was nearly colloquial, using common and understandable language. Having studied extensively, he was well-versed in taboos and had reviewed the text multiple times. His extraordinary memory also ensured he paid close attention to such matters during drafting.

The final draft, though lacking literary flourish, could be considered a practical manual for epidemic prevention and treatment. After finishing, his mind felt suddenly enlightened.

Observing the *Health Lord*, he saw that his Literary Core had advanced to the Intermediate stage. It was a natural progression, like water flowing downhill. This was the best article he had written since transmigrating.

### Taihe Palace

This ceremony was actually Taihe Sect's formal announcement of its heir. Although the choice was already known in the martial world, the ceremony was still significant. From then on, Xiao Ruowang could officially interact with martial peers and officials as the sect's young master. Additionally, after the ritual, he would receive an honorary official title.

In the martial world, few major sects received such honorary titles from the imperial court. Even Qingfu Palace at its peak only had its abbot holding an official title, which was later revoked after a rebellion.

"Greetings, Provincial Scholar Zhou."

"Greetings, Daoist Xiao."

Xiao Ruowang personally welcomed Zhou Qing upon his arrival and invited him to the inner hall for a discussion. Taihe Sect had both civil and martial halls, with the civil hall reserved for high-ranking officials and nobles, reflecting its elevated status.

The current emperor revered Daoism, and his subjects followed suit. Taihe Sect, deeply rooted in Xijiang Province and backed by Prince Qinghe, had befriended many officials. This time, even the Provincial Administration Commissioner attended, with prefect-level officials merely serving as background.

Prince Qinghe Yuanhua and Princess Yuan Mingyue would arrive when the ceremony officially began. Knowing Zhou Qing preferred quiet, Xiao Ruowang arranged a secluded spot for him. In his view, Zhou Qing's attendance was already a great honor.

To Xiao Ruowang, Zhou Qing resembled ancient recluses. Who else, after passing the provincial examination, wouldn't upgrade their residence? Yet Zhou Qing remained in his old house without even servants, indifferent to luxury, embodying Daoist simplicity.

Even though Zhou Qing was in mourning, conventional wisdom held that moving to a grander residence would honor his ancestors. But Zhou Qing never did so. For over two years, he remained unchanged, showing no interest in fame or profit.

Only those who truly knew him in Jiangzhou City (like Golden Light Temple) saw through the facade. Golden Light Temple suspected Zhou Qing, the Lin family, and Qingfu Palace were involved in incidents like Elder Zhitong and the Haisha Gang, but they had no evidence. The case was closed, and even appealing to Governor Song wouldn't reopen it.

In Governor Song's eyes, Prefect Feng Zhiyuan was a capable official. The governor intended to use this scholar-born official to counter the ambitions of Acting Provincial Administration Commissioner Wang Xun.

For nearly two years, the court showed no intention of removing the "acting" from Wang Xun's title or transferring him.

However, Zhou Qing's understanding of the *Six-Character Health Mantra* still provided significant help to Xiao Ruowang.

"Brother Zhou, without your profound scholarship and medical expertise, the *Six-Character Health Mantra* might have remained obscure for much longer. Even so, apart from you, few in this world could comprehend it, let alone practice it."

Xiao Ruowang sighed in admiration. Zhou Qing's innate advantages, coupled with his alchemical skills, made him seem born for cultivation.

Zhou Qing, aware of Xiao Ruowang's temperament, didn't hide much from him—though many details were left for Xiao Ruowang to infer. Zhou Qing then revealed that Fushan was alive, had reached the Xiantian realm, and was now at Qingfu Palace.

Though rumors spoke of Xiantian masters in the imperial palace, none were confirmed. The Daoist community also had a legendary Xiantian master, unseen for years, and the grasslands were said to have a Xiantian-level shaman from the barbarian tribes. These remained hearsay.

But Fushan's Xiantian status came from Zhou Qing's own words.

"A living Xiantian master?" Zhang Jingxiu suddenly appeared, unable to remain seated. As a *Tanhua* (third-place finisher) in the palace examinations, he had seen all kinds of scholarly essays. Yet none, no matter how florid, could compare in his mind to Zhou Qing's *Treatise on Pestilence*.

Li Qingzhi had the county magistrate stop reading and inquired closely about Zhou Qing's background and medical training. Only then did he learn that Zhou Qing's parents had died of severe illness, which explained his pursuit of medicine. He had studied at Qingfu Palace as Fushan's junior disciple.

Hearing this, many among the assembled nobles nodded in understanding. Some even knew of Fushan's reputation, having sought his medical services. Fushan had never sought fame or fortune, and Zhou Qing's seclusion and refusal to take the metropolitan exams followed the same tradition.

"Though young, is he not a man of noble spirit?" Li Qingzhi remarked.

Shang Bing had long since slunk away. Even he, despite his ignorance, recognized the medical text's importance to the current crisis. At home, Grand Secretary Shang also worried about the plague, knowing it required urgent attention to prevent disaster across multiple provinces.

Local plague control regulations, combined with Zhou Qing's *Treatise on Pestilence*, could improve epidemic management. The treatise wasn't a panacea but offered valuable advice for distribution to prefectures and counties.

With Li Qingzhi's endorsement, Zhou Qing could later present the *Treatise on Pestilence* to Governor Song He of Tiannan Province. Though hastily written, Zhou Qing had rushed to complete it, knowing influential figures at Taihe Palace could help disseminate it quickly.

On his return journey, he could refine the text further, though the core content was sound. Some passages were deliberately vague to avoid taboos, but this didn't hinder practical application—it merely made them less effective.

Throughout history, achieving something worthwhile was hard, while sabotaging it was easy. Writing was no different. Even painstaking efforts could be skimmed or twisted by malicious readers.

But Zhou Qing wrote with the hope that his work would be useful. He wasn't one to withhold even a hair for the world's benefit, but he acted according to his conscience.

The dispute Shang Bing provoked was effortlessly defused by Zhou Qing's *Treatise on Pestilence*. Now, no one questioned Zhou Qing's scholarship. A halo of moral authority surrounded him, making critics targets of scorn.

Why did scholars pursue reputations for integrity? Because moral high ground was invaluable in their circles. With such a reputation, even officials hesitated to oppose them. As a purist, even the emperor couldn't easily act against them.

Hai Rui's memorial *Straightforward Presentation of the World's Foremost Matter*, which lambasted Emperor Jiajing, led only to imprisonment—not execution. Such were the benefits of occupying the moral high ground.

Yet constantly playing the moral paragon was exhausting—unless, like Hai Rui, one had no desires. Zhou Qing acted out of circumstance, not self-promotion. Besides, in a few years, when he reached the Xiantian realm, his world would be entirely different.

The ceremony proceeded smoothly thereafter. Prince Qinghe Yuanhua and Princess Yuan Mingyue came and went swiftly but showed due respect to Taihe Sect.

"Provincial Scholar Zhou, you can cleanse your organs with thunder resonance?" Xiao Ruowang looked incredulous. He had considered it fast progress to generate thunder resonance for organ cleansing with the *One Qi Sunrise Talisman Manual*'s Toad-Catching Technique before thirty. Yet Zhou Qing had already mastered the Tiger Play True Words from Immortal Jingyang's *Six-Character Health Mantra*.

Zhou Qing got straight to the point, asking about Triple Burner cultivation techniques and internal methods for synchronized bone and tendon resonance. He offered to explain all six characters of the *Health Mantra* in exchange.

Xiao Ruowang first elaborated on the Triple Burner, stating that although it was a Taihe Sect secret, he admired Zhou Qing's *Treatise on Pestilence*. As the sect's young master, he had the authority to share it. Centuries ago, Immortal Jingyang had also visited Taihe Mountain, taking some of its secrets.

But Zhou Qing had to swear not to disclose the knowledge, which he readily agreed to.

Zhou Qing then explained the Tiger Play's thunder resonance techniques. Despite his mastery, Xiao Ruowang found some aspects hard to grasp—particularly how tiger roars and thunder resonance were inseparable from the Tiger Play.

Through this, Zhou Qing learned something new: different martial arts of Qi and Blood conflicted with each other and were hard to reconcile unless one had abundant Qi and Blood, and the techniques complemented one another. Otherwise, severe clashes arose.

But the Five Animals Play was a unified whole, and techniques like Tiger-Crane Double Form, combined with the *Health Lord*'s consumption of Qi and Blood and the fusion of Literary Core and divine intent, avoided such conflicts. Additionally, miraculous elixirs were needed to overcome clashes between martial arts.

As for Qingfu Palace, all its talisman manuals shared the same origin, so conflicts between Qi and Blood martial arts were nonexistent. Thus, even Zhou Qing's Tiger Play was beyond Xiao Ruowang's practice.

"Brother Zhou, without your profound scholarship and medical expertise, the *Six-Character Health Mantra* might have remained obscure for much longer. Even so, apart from you, few in this world could comprehend it, let alone practice it."

Xiao Ruowang sighed in admiration. Zhou Qing's innate advantages, coupled with his alchemical skills, made him seem born for cultivation.

Zhou Qing, aware of Xiao Ruowang's temperament, didn't hide much from him—though many details were left for Xiao Ruowang to infer. Zhou Qing then revealed that Fushan was alive, had reached the Xiantian realm, and was now at Qingfu Palace.
