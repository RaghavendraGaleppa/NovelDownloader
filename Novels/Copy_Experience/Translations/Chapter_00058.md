**Chapter 58: High-Grade Formation Master**

Myriad Immortals City, Cloudtrue Auction House.

Inside the grand hall, thousands of people gathered around the central high platform. The five-yearly auction had begun, and almost everyone with some financial means in Myriad Immortals City had come to participate. Lu Xu, his appearance altered by a bronze mask, arrived at the auction house and sat on a chair, quietly observing.

"There are quite a few late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, but I haven't seen any Foundation Establishment cultivators!"

"That's good. The face sculpted by this bronze mask won't be easily seen through then!" Lu Xu thought to himself. It was a good thing for him that Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't present. This mask artifact could fool Qi Refinement cultivators, but it might not be able to deceive the spiritual sense of Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"I hope some useful items appear this time!" After a quick scan, Lu Xu quietly waited.

People continued to stream in until half an hour later, when the flow of entrants into the auction house abruptly stopped. The doors closed. Under the expectant gazes of the crowd, a white-haired old man, at the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement, stepped onto the high platform. Behind him followed nine beautiful young maidens, generally at the third level of Qi Refinement, each holding an item in their hands.

"This old man is Yun Huayu, the host of this auction!" The old man cupped his hands and introduced himself to everyone present. Then, he got straight to the point, taking a jade bottle from the nearest maiden beside him and saying, "Today's first auction item is a Barrier-Breaking Pill!"

As his voice fell, an uproar immediately erupted. The eyes of the cultivators who were stuck before the late Qi Refinement bottleneck all lit up.

"It's actually a Barrier-Breaking Pill? To offer a pill of this caliber right at the start, there must be many good things at this auction!"

"I must get it. This item relates to whether I can cultivate to Great Perfection of Qi Refinement before the Heavenly Gate of sixty."

"Cough, fellow Daoists must all know the great name of the Barrier-Breaking Pill, so this old man won't need to introduce it. Bidding starts now, with a starting price of four hundred spirit stones!" The old man hosting the auction coughed lightly, then announced the start of the auction.

"Four hundred fifty spirit stones!"

"Four hundred eighty spirit stones!"

"Five hundred spirit stones!"

"Fellow Daoist is already at the ninth level of Qi Refinement, why contend for this Barrier-Breaking Pill?"

"Hmph, aren't you also at the tenth level of Qi Refinement? What do you need a Barrier-Breaking Pill for?"

"My beloved is on the verge of breaking through to the late Qi Refinement stage and urgently needs this pill. I hope fellow Daoist will yield a step!"

"My grandson also urgently needs this pill, not a single step can be yielded. Six hundred spirit stones!"

This Barrier-Breaking Pill was ultimately won by an elderly man at the ninth level of Qi Refinement for seven hundred twenty spirit stones. The group of sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivators, who had been holding back, could still bid a few times in the early stages, but in the later stages, they could only watch as a group of late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators vied for it. Items prepared for mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators were completely out of reach for mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators to contend for.

"Next is the second auction item!" The white-haired old man said, taking a jade box from another maiden beside him. "A Soul Condensing Grass over a hundred years old. This is the main ingredient for refining Soul Condensing Pills. I presume I don't need to elaborate on the importance of Soul Condensing Pills, do I?"

The white-haired old man immediately opened the jade box. Inside lay a strange, pitch-black grass, as if it could draw in one's very soul.

"Soul Condensing Grass?!" Lu Xu's spirits immediately lifted upon hearing that name. As a first-grade high-rank alchemist, he was extremely familiar with all sorts of first-grade high-rank pills. The Soul Condensing Pill, which can be refined using this Soul Condensing Grass as the main ingredient, is among the most precious of first-grade high-rank pills. As the name suggests, the Soul Condensing Pill's purpose is to strengthen the soul. And the benefits of a strong soul for breaking through to Foundation Establishment are self-evident. To advance to Foundation Establishment, one must pass the spiritual sense trial. If one cannot transform and produce spiritual sense, then Foundation Establishment is bound to fail. Since ancient times, countless individuals who failed Foundation Establishment stumbled at this very hurdle. Strengthening the soul before Foundation Establishment can significantly increase the chances of success.

As the old man's voice fell, the eyes of those who hoped to achieve Foundation Establishment instantly lit up, as if a fire burned within them.

"Starting price five hundred spirit stones, bidding begins now!"

"Five hundred fifty spirit stones!"

"Five hundred eighty spirit stones!"

"Six hundred fifty spirit stones!"

After just a few rounds of bidding, the price of this Soul Condensing Grass was pushed to the exorbitant price of eight hundred spirit stones. At this point, the mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators could only click their tongues in amazement. Even if they were to empty their entire fortunes, they couldn't produce so many spirit stones. Many late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators had also withdrawn from the competition. Although the Soul Condensing Pill was good, the Foundation Establishment Pill was more important. They couldn't throw all their limited resources onto this spiritual herb. When the price exceeded their psychological expectations, batches of people would withdraw. Those who remained were undoubtedly wealthy individuals.

"Eight hundred twenty spirit stones!" Lu Xu called out his price for the first time.

"Eight hundred fifty spirit stones!"

"Eight hundred eighty spirit stones!"

Only a sparse two or three people remained in the bidding. When Lu Xu pushed the price to nine hundred spirit stones, only one person could still compete with him.

"Nine hundred twenty spirit stones. This old man is a first-grade high-rank alchemist, and this Soul Condensing Grass is truly important to me. I hope fellow Daoist can part with it!" A green-robed old man stood up and cupped his hands towards Lu Xu, saying.

Upon hearing the words "alchemist," Lu Xu's eyes immediately lit up. He immediately had the idea of copying the old man's experience. But then he thought, he himself was also a first-grade high-rank alchemist, and his experience was as high as 57. This old man's experience might not even be as high as his. Even if he copied it, it wouldn't increase his own experience much, and he would just lose hundreds of spirit stones for nothing.

"I'll wait to copy a second-grade alchemist. Finding a second-grade alchemist in Myriad Immortals City isn't that difficult!" Lu Xu said expressionlessly: "Nine hundred fifty spirit stones!"

The high-rank alchemist's expression flickered for a moment, then he could only let out a bitter laugh and sit back down.

"Is there anyone offering a higher price?" After calling out three times with no one else raising the price, Yun Huayu, the auction host, struck the gavel, and the Soul Condensing Grass ultimately went to Lu Xu.

Next, the auction continued. Various rare and exquisite items, usually hard to find, were presented before everyone's eyes: pills suitable for late-stage Qi Refinement, powerful sets of high-rank artifacts, alchemy notes left behind by famous alchemists, and so on. Lu Xu listened quietly the entire time, not making another move since acquiring the Soul Condensing Grass. It wasn't until the final highlight of the auction that he perked up.

"Next up is the first highlight item of this auction: the first-grade high-rank formation, Cloud Water Heavenly Light Array!"

"This formation was crafted by our Myriad Immortals City's renowned Formation Master, Master Zong. Next, Master Zong himself will introduce this formation!"

After Yun Huayu's voice fell, a smiling middle-aged man, Zong An-yan, stood up from a corner of the auction hall, cupped his hands to the four directions, and then walked onto the high platform. Zong An-yan, a renowned Formation Master of Myriad Immortals City, an important figure in the Merchant Alliance's Thousand Mechanisms Hall, and usually residing in the inner city, unexpectedly appeared at this auction. Formation Masters are an even rarer existence than alchemists. And Formation Masters who can create first-grade high-rank formations are exceedingly rare.

"Everyone, I will now personally introduce the function of this formation!" Master Zong smiled, taking out various formation-laying tools from his storage bag and introducing the general characteristics of the formation to the crowd.

Lu Xu had no interest in listening to him speak at this point. Staring intently at the Formation Master, he whispered in his heart: "Check formation dao experience!"

After a flash of green light, a line of text appeared before his eyes:

[First-Grade High-Rank Formation Master: 88/100 (10x)]

"Copy!" Lu Xu activated his copying ability without hesitation, and a massive amount of formation array experience instantly poured into his mind.
