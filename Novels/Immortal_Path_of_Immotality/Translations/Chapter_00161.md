# Chapter 160: Contribution Points Exchange  

The temporary headquarters in the East Sea, the Volcanic Archipelago.  

A large transport airship slowly docked at the plaza. A gangway extended from its starboard side as cultivators returning from the front lines disembarked one by one. Lin Shan, however, simply flew back to the Black Lotus Sect's mountain gate on his sword.  

His first stop was the sect's Contribution Exchange Hall. With contribution points in hand, he could exchange them for useful resources. Over half a year had passed, and with supplies continuously flowing in from the distant Lu State, there should be more items available for exchange.  

The hall wasn't crowded at the moment. Most of the demonic cultivators were still fighting on the front lines, leaving only the wounded from earlier rotations inside, all frowning at the exchange list displayed on the central screen.  

**Sect's Ultimate Divine Ability:** *Rakshasa Void Meditation Technique* — 1,000,000 points  
**Minor Divine Ability:** *Seven Evils Soul-Locking Technique* — 500,000 points  
**Minor Divine Ability:** *Soul-Severing Oblivion Seal* — 500,000 points  
...  
**Magic Treasure:** *Glazed Radiance Armor* — 100,000 points  
**Magic Treasure:** *Pure Maiden Bell* — 120,000 points  
**Magic Treasure:** *Demon-Slaying Dice* — 150,000 points  
**Magic Treasure:** *Crimson Silver Needles* — 80,000 points  
...  

Lin Shan felt a dull ache in his teeth as he scanned the high-tier divine abilities and treasures.  

*Hundreds of thousands of points just like that? Are they serious? Do these Black Lotus Sect losers even have a chance to exchange for these in their lifetime?*  

He had initially thought his 10,000+ contribution points made him wealthy, but now he realized he was still dirt poor. He couldn't even afford the cheapest magic treasure, let alone a minor divine ability!  

In truth, the Black Lotus Sect's contribution points were pegged 1:1 to spirit stones in the cultivation world, and the prices for items were fair and aligned with market value. However, high-tier items like divine abilities and magic treasures were practically priceless—no amount of spirit stones could buy them outside, as they were usually bartered among high-ranking cultivators.  

Contribution points couldn't be exchanged for spirit stones either; they could only be earned by completing sect missions. This system ensured that disciples became increasingly bound to the sect in their pursuit of advancement.  

As for the high-tier treasures costing hundreds of thousands of points, those were meant for the sect’s Golden Core elders. What use would a Foundation Establishment cultivator have for a magic treasure? Even if they got one, could they even wield it?  

Minor divine abilities were rare even among Golden Core cultivators, let alone those at lower realms. Naturally, scarcity drove up their value. In peacetime, accumulating enough contribution points was nearly impossible—missions simply didn’t reward enough.  

Fortunately, the current war between righteous and demonic factions provided an opportunity. Battle merits could be converted into contribution points, with rewards based on the status and strength of slain enemies.  

For example, Lin Shan had killed a true disciple of the Dry Cloud Pavilion, earning him 8,000 points—a generous sum compared to the 2,000–3,000 points for an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

---  

Killing a Golden Core cultivator, however, would net at least 50,000 points. The sect’s contribution system evaluated targets based on their strength, status, and wealth.  

*"So, killing two Golden Core cultivators gets you one magic treasure, and four gets you a minor divine ability..."*  

Lin Shan stared blankly at the exchange list. Even for the sect’s Golden Core elders, such feats were life-threatening. How easy was it to kill a fellow Golden Core cultivator?  

If one opted for quantity over quality, a magic treasure would require slaying 40–50 Foundation Establishment cultivators, while a minor divine ability would demand nearly a hundred.  

For Foundation Establishment cultivators, this was no less daunting than Golden Core cultivators battling each other.  

Righteous sects, unlike the demonic factions' laissez-faire approach, operated on strict mentorship or bloodline systems. A typical righteous sect or cultivation clan might only have a few dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators in total. Accumulating enough points would essentially require exterminating entire factions—something their Golden Core ancestors would never allow.  

Lin Shan gritted his teeth. It seemed that obtaining these treasures as a Foundation Establishment cultivator was a distant dream.  

*"Magic treasures aren’t cabbages—you think you can just buy them?"*  

Black Skeleton Monarch couldn’t hold back any longer. It couldn’t stand Lin Shan’s warped perspective and felt compelled to educate him on the realities of the cultivation world.  

*"Ordinary cultivators exhaust their life savings just to have a slim chance at breaking through to Golden Core. After reaching that realm, they must start from scratch again, painstakingly accumulating resources before they can hope to forge or trade for a single magic treasure."*  

*"You just got lucky, stumbling upon Elder Tortoise’s legacy as a Foundation Establishment cultivator and ending up with two magic treasures. Thinking they’re cheap just because you got them early is textbook survivor bias."*  

*"Elder Tortoise was half a step into Nascent Soul realm—his wealth was several times that of an average Golden Core cultivator. Stop aiming unrealistically high!"*  

Lin Shan nodded in reluctant agreement.  

But then it struck him—*he* wasn’t ordinary. Why measure himself by conventional standards? How could Black Skeleton Monarch comprehend his uniqueness?  

Still, it was a shame that spirit stones couldn’t be exchanged 1:1 for contribution points. With over 100,000 spirit stones in his possession, he might have been able to afford a minor divine ability.  

Shifting his gaze downward, he examined the other available items.  

**Artifact:** *Red Mandarin Ribbon* — 8,000 points  
**Artifact:** *Ai Kun Sphere* — 5,000 points  
**Artifact:** *Shadow Bamboo Darts* — 2,000 points  
...  
**Pills:** *Primordial Golden Elixir* — 50,000 points  
**Pills:** *Soul-Nourishing Pill* — 30,000 points  
**Pills:** *Purple Heart Pill* — 5,000 points  
**Pills:** *Azure Fall Pill (per bottle)* — 1,000 points  
...  

After reviewing the list, Lin Shan decided to exchange for *Azure Fall Pills* and *Purple Heart Pills*. The former would aid his daily cultivation, while the latter assisted in breaking through bottlenecks at the Foundation Establishment stage.  

The *Purple Heart Pill* was renowned for its stable efficacy, increasing breakthrough success rates by 20%—whether at early or mid-Foundation Establishment.  

Twenty percent might not sound like much, but it was among the best available. No pill guaranteed a breakthrough; they merely improved the odds.  

To Lin Shan, however, 20% wasn’t enough. Fortunately, he could enhance the pill’s effects using his reinforcement panel. When it came to cultivation breakthroughs, no expense could be spared.  

Other pills also boosted breakthrough chances, but stacking them didn’t yield linear benefits—their combined effects diminished sharply.  

Since most of Lin Shan’s contribution points would go toward *Azure Fall Pills* for cultivation, reinforcing the *Purple Heart Pill* was the safest bet.  

---  

After spending all 10,000+ contribution points on one *Purple Heart Pill* and over a dozen bottles of *Azure Fall Pills*, Lin Shan returned to his mountainside cave abode and began seclusion.  

The outside world—the raging war between righteous and demonic factions in the Great Song Empire—faded from his mind. Lost in cultivation, time slipped away unnoticed.  

This seclusion lasted an unprecedented ten years.  

A decade passed. Dust gathered outside his cave, and autumn leaves reddened, yellowed, and greened, piling into thick layers. During this time, the sect delivered annual supplies of pills and spirit stones to his abode.  

With the "Cloud-Soaring Pills" looted from Dry Cloud Pavilion’s true disciple Qi Zhong, the *Azure Fall Pills* from the sect, and a decade’s worth of allocated resources, Lin Shan had consumed what would normally be forty years’ worth of pills for an average disciple.  

Finally, he reached the peak of early Foundation Establishment.
