# Chapter 118: Stained with Royal Blood

At the bottom of the deep pit, Qin Ming walked more steadily, completely withdrawing his thoughts from the near-immortal object and metal pages, calming down entirely. Those things were still very far from him, largely unrelated, and belonged to the core Dao lineages of the Outer Realm. He reminded himself not to get carried away, needing to proceed with his feet firmly on the ground. Just a few months ago, he was still hunting in the mountains, nearly dying from a strange illness, enduring hunger, and struggling for survival. As for everything at the Cui family, that was nothing more than an ephemeral dream, not to be taken seriously. Only after embarking on the Path of Rebirth and continuously improving his physique did he break free from his predicament. Qin Ming felt that cultivating Heavenly Radiance Energy was his way out; by continuously integrating it, he would eventually rise.

Chen Shuhang and Jiang Congyun fled, not daring to take the original path, unwilling to encounter He Tai, who possessed the aura of a young Grandmaster, or the Five Elements Palace successor. After being severely wounded by Qin Ming, their condition was very poor. They worried that on their way back, experts cultivating special energy techniques would perceive their weakness, and if anyone wished them ill, they would be in dire straits. Moreover, Jiang Congyun and Chen Shuhang felt that their experience at the bottom of the pit was disgraceful and didn't want to mention it to anyone.

Qin Ming, however, was unhurriedly walking back along the original path, as this was part of his plan; he wanted to muddy the waters. He couldn't quietly take the near-immortal object out, as it was truly extraordinary. All along the way, it had been radiating an auspicious glow, illuminating the nearby misty light in vibrant colors. If he didn't return via the predetermined path, he would likely be perceived as attempting to abscond with the near-immortal object, triggering an assault by the Outer Realm disciples. Qin Ming mused, since that was the case, he might as well use the Bagua Furnace as bait to draw all the disciples into the fray, letting them erupt into a chaotic battle. Anyway, no one knew Li Qingyue had returned yet. She could wait calmly, observing as the fierce and brutal competition drew to a close. Qin Ming's only concern was whether an Outer Realm disciple, if they temporarily acquired the Bagua Furnace, could activate it and unleash its mysterious power. He felt it would be prudent to quietly capture an Outer Realm disciple and test it.

He had been in the forbidden zone for quite some time, and the Pure Yang Blood on his armor was almost completely evaporated. At the bottom of the giant pit, violent colorful mist flowed, surging and roaring like vast heavenly flames. Even Qin Ming felt a burning sensation in his mouth and nose with every breath, accompanied by waves of searing pain. If it were any other newcomer, their lungs would be burned through in mere moments, incinerated from the inside out, turning to ash.

"Eh, he's out!"

"He really got the near-immortal object!"

The three great experts guarding the edge of the deep pit saw the hazy figure approaching from afar within the colorful mist, and even more, they noticed the divine glow swirling around the object in his hand.

He Tai was a young expert invited by the Zheng family. His lineage was extremely profound; he cultivated the Great Ape King Energy, and his ancestor had once dared to challenge the Tathagata of that era. He stared at the figure in the Heavenly Radiance mist, a strange look in his eyes, and said, "Chen Shuhang and Jiang Congyun are gone; only the Six Sovereigns Energy successor remains."

"He has no connection to the Six Sovereigns lineage," Chen Xingyuan said calmly. He was from the legendary Five Elements Palace, and his strength was profound and unfathomable.

Li Tianhe, a disciple of the Jade Purity lineage, merely hummed in agreement, acknowledging his statement.

Chen Xingyuan, the Five Elements Palace disciple, added indifferently, "He also has no connection to the Tathagata lineage."

There were no others here, only the three of them waiting, all with great backgrounds, and their cultivated Heavenly Radiance Energy was the most unique and powerful. Qin Ming passed through the dense Heavenly Radiance, now not far from them. All three men's gazes were drawn to the near-immortal object, which, though severely damaged, still glowed with splendor.

"Did you have a conflict with Jiang Congyun and Chen Shuhang?" He Tai asked.

Qin Ming looked at him, saying nothing. Was he looking for trouble?

Chen Xingyuan and Li Tianhe remained silent, watching calmly.

"Your actions were perhaps too ruthless, leaving both of them in the forbidden zone?" He Tai spoke again.

Qin Ming countered, "What do you mean? Do you think I killed them? Don't go around slandering people."

"That would be best. After all, everyone is walking the same path, and it's not easy," He Tai nodded, then smiled and reached out, ready to take the splendid Bagua Furnace.

Qin Ming walked forward, approaching the edge of the giant pit, and handed over the Bagua Furnace. He Tai smiled, one hand reaching for the edge of the furnace mouth, while his other hand suddenly unleashed Great Ape King Energy, blasting towards Qin Ming. The Great Ape King Energy was incredibly violent, both masculine and domineering, as if a sky-devouring giant ape had materialized there, radiating vast Heavenly Radiance.

Qin Ming couldn't possibly be hit by him. He activated his Wind Energy, bringing forth a fierce gust of wind, and dodged the powerful Heavenly Radiance. However, the Pure Yang Blood on his body had dispersed. There wasn't much left to begin with, and with He Tai's sudden attack, it all evaporated. Clearly, He Tai's intention was to disperse the remaining Pure Yang Blood on Qin Ming's armor.

Normally, for a newcomer to enter an area dense with Heavenly Radiance was absolutely to risk their life. Qin Ming had just emerged alive, and He Tai immediately made such a move, destroying his Pure Yang Blood, clearly with strong malicious intent. He Tai, however, was also stunned. He had grabbed the edge of the Bagua Furnace, so why hadn't he snatched it? He had actually failed.

Qin Ming's expression was indifferent. He had long seen He Tai's malicious intentions. Even if he were to put on an act to trigger a great chaos, he wouldn't let it be ignited by this person. Just now, his Adhesive Energy had activated, making He Tai's efforts to grab it futile, no matter how hard he pulled.

"Are we enemies?" Qin Ming asked, while simultaneously attempting to climb the slope.

With a whoosh, the three great experts moved simultaneously, swift as lightning, blocking his path.

"You killed Jiang Congyun and Chen Shuhang, staining your hands with blood. We can't stand by and wish to avenge them," He Tai said indifferently.

Qin Ming looked at the three of them and said, "Are you all so hypocritical? What are you still pretending for at this point? You're probably after the near-immortal object too, aren't you?"

Chen Xingyuan, the Five Elements Palace successor, nodded and said, "Indeed. The Bagua Furnace of Mount Luofu was far too famous a thousand years ago, involving near-immortal creatures and god-like beings from the depths of the Night Mist World. We wish to study it thoroughly."

Qin Ming didn't know how to comment. A group of Outer Realm disciples forming alliances and using all their methods, only for even the people they invited to help to harbor their own intentions. When he had seen He Tai earlier, this person had been very low-key and humble. Now, his true nature was revealed. Qin Ming shook his head, sighing softly.

He then feigned a breakthrough, rushing towards the slope. However, the three great experts jointly intercepted him, aiming to force him into the forbidden zone to be scorched by the Heavenly Radiance. Qin Ming's killing intent surfaced. Originally, he had been very restrained, sparing both Chen Shuhang and Jiang Congyun, but now he didn't want to forgive the people before him.

He clashed palms with He Tai, not to immediately determine their superiority or inferiority, or life and death. He was activating his Adhesive Energy, pulling the Great Ape King Energy successor, dragging him along into the bottom of the Heavenly Radiance-dense giant pit. He Tai's heart trembled. This person's external Heavenly Radiance was limited, so how could he drag him into the forbidden zone? His expression turned cruel. He had the protection of Pure Yang Blood, while the other party had already lost his reliance, having no protective spiritual blood. Qin Ming certainly couldn't stay long here.

He Tai's Great Ape King Energy was unleashed fully. Behind him, a black giant ape seemed to rise, roaring as if to tear apart the night sky and see the light of day again. It had to be said, his Heavenly Radiance Energy was indeed extraordinary. No wonder his ancestor had dared to challenge the Tathagata back then; it was accompanied by such a wondrous phenomenon.

Qin Ming struck out with his Wuji Fist, instantly shattering He Tai's powerful and domineering Heavenly Radiance. Then, his Golden Silkworm Energy erupted; even though it only extended three inches from his body, it punctured He Tai's fist, causing blood to flow. He Tai was indeed extraordinary. The Heavenly Radiance Energy on his body circulated extremely fast, vibrating violently. He only bled slightly through the skin; his muscles and bones were unharmed. Outside his body, the Heavenly Radiance surged and vibrated, nearly a meter thick. His strength indeed surpassed Jiang Congyun and Chen Shuhang. But he was very surprised. What was the opponent's background? Three inches of Heavenly Radiance could actually shake his nearly one-meter thick externalized Heavenly Radiance. This was truly incredible.

He had achieved success at a young age, praised by many who believed he possessed some of the essence of a young Grandmaster in the field of fist arts. He had always been quite confident, and now he attacked with full force. On Qin Ming's fist, Blazing Fire Energy burst forth, a layer of flames swirling around it, tearing open the opponent's fist energy. Like a prairie fire, it actually ignited a portion of He Tai's Heavenly Radiance.

"What?!" He Tai was shocked. He activated the Great Ape King Energy with full power, instantly extinguishing the Blazing Fire Heavenly Radiance. Qin Ming closed in, making physical contact with him again. This time, his Adhesive Energy was pushed to its limit, and he pulled over that crimson crystalline layer of Pure Yang Blood Essence from He Tai. The next moment, Qin Ming attached it all to his own armor.

"You..." He Tai's complexion changed. Having lost his protection, he would under no circumstances dare to stay long in such a place and immediately sought to break out. This was because he already felt an overwhelming heat and was being corroded by the Heavenly Radiance.

"Where do you think you're going? You should taste this feeling for yourself!" Qin Ming intercepted him, not letting him leave.

He Tai's eyes turned crimson. He suddenly stopped, knowing that this could not end peacefully. The more he wanted to escape, the harder it would be to break free. Now, his only option was to fight with all his might.

"Let you witness the true Great Ape King Art!" he said coldly. His heart, instead, grew calm. Enduring the searing pain of the Heavenly Radiance, he lunged at Qin Ming. He unleashed the Great Ape King Fist, famed throughout the Night Mist World. It was indeed extraordinary, as he actually traded blows with Qin Ming. His Heavenly Radiance Energy was extremely special, incredibly domineering and masculine, temporarily holding back Qin Ming's fist light.

"Roar!"

He Tai roared loudly, exploding with full power. The black Great Ape King phantom behind him merged into one with him, and then, as he threw his punch, it shook the bottom region of the giant pit. With a rumble, wherever his Heavenly Radiance Energy was directed, it easily tore open some meter-high rocks at the bottom of the giant pit. He Tai stomped his foot forcefully, and the crystalline ground cracked open, many fissures measuring half a foot wide. He seemed to transform into a true Great Ape King, growing braver with each battle, stirring up the vibrant Heavenly Radiance mist as if striking with the grand momentum of heaven and earth. With every punch he threw, terrifying Heavenly Radiance surged, sweeping up many rocks that hovered in mid-air, flying forward with his fists, creating an astounding momentum.

Qin Ming became serious, confronting the enemy earnestly. He didn't want to drag this out. With the Silk Scripture Method governing all scriptures, his three miraculous arts and eighteen energy techniques vibrated and roared continuously. Sacred radiance flowed throughout his entire body. He struck out fiercely with his right fist; the so-called Grandmaster aura and superb techniques were all contained within this strongest punch!

He Tai's face changed. Others praised him as a future Grandmaster, but he hadn't gotten carried away, knowing he was still far from that level. Even if he possessed a few traces of Grandmaster essence, it wasn't truly comparable. However, seeing the opponent's fist light and that posture now, he felt provoked. Because he felt that this person truly possessed some of the demeanor of a young Grandmaster.

He Tai roared loudly, exploding with full power. The black Great Ape King phantom behind him merged into one with him, and then, as he threw his punch, it shook the bottom region of the giant pit. With a resounding crash, their fists collided. Qin Ming punched through that nearly one-meter thick Heavenly Radiance, shattering the Great Ape King Energy. With blood splattering, He Tai's fist was deformed, and the sound of bones breaking was clearly audible.

"What future Grandmaster, young master of fist arts? You're far from it!" Qin Ming commented.

He Tai staggered back. Corroded by the Heavenly Radiance mist of this place, and with his finger bones broken, he was in immense pain. He unleashed terrifying fist light once more, blasting forward. This time, Qin Ming didn't counter with his fist. He had already gauged his opponent's strength and defeated him; he had lost interest. He directly swung the Bagua Furnace in his hand, blasting it forward. He Tai's pupils constricted. Only then did he realize that the opponent's left hand hadn't seemed to move much. So he had fought intensely with him for so long with only one hand? He felt a sense of defeat.

To survive, he didn't hesitate to damage his own origin, unleashing even greater power. The Great Ape King behind him became even clearer, directly pouncing out, leaping over his main body, and charging towards Qin Ming. Qin Ming swung the Bagua Furnace and smashed it forward. With a loud crash, the ferocious and massive black giant ape phantom exploded into smithereens.

"Argh..." He Tai screamed in pain. That was seemingly his essence, Qi, and Spirit, having left his physical body and now being shattered. His entire being was in a state of madness. Qin Ming's expression was solemn. The Great Ape King Art was indeed formidable, exceedingly extraordinary. A giant ape had actually pounced out just now, which was beyond the scope of normal cultivation methods. He realized that this cultivation method was actually very strong; He Tai simply hadn't cultivated it to mastery!

He Tai, in a frenzy, charged forward. Qin Ming swung the Bagua Furnace. With a thud, he smashed half of He Tai's body apart. He Tai's remains fell into a pool of blood, screaming miserably in pain. Soon, he was ignited by the Heavenly Radiance that had already entered his body, rapidly burning to ashes. A young expert died tragically!

The commotion here was immense, naturally startling the Outer Realm disciples at the edge of the giant pit. Many saw immortal light blooming below.

"The near-immortal object has been retrieved!" someone shouted.

Some Outer Realm disciples, their bodies attached with Pure Yang Blood, swiftly dived down.

"The grand show has begun," Qin Ming whispered softly, standing silently at the bottom of the giant pit, holding the near-immortal object.
