# Chapter 256: Escaping the Trap, a Talent for the Ages, a Lady’s Devotion, and the Crane Delivering the Pill

The divine might was dazzling, the Dual Pupils glaring furiously. Legend had it that the power of the "Dual Pupils" could frighten off "ghosts and gods" and stare down "immortals and Buddhas."

Li Xian concealed his Dual Physique perfectly. Pursued and killed along the way, he had activated the Dual Pupils to see through things multiple times, yet never revealed the slightest trace. Wen Caishang served him daily, yet remained unaware.

Now that he revealed his aspect, the imposing aura was already formidable.

Having undergone the Nine Transmutations of Essence Consumption, the Dual Pupils had grown even deeper. The power of this strange eye was truly difficult to describe in words. No matter how despicable Zhao Zhiyuan was, he held a high position and possessed a mind superior to others.

Meeting the Dual Pupils’ gaze at this moment, he trembled all over, recalling the many "legends of the Dual Pupils," and his scalp went numb. There were countless strange reborn aspects in the world, but the aspect of the "Dual Pupils" would surely shock the heavens upon appearing in the world! He immediately shivered and cried out, "Dual Pupils... truly the Dual Pupils!"

Wen Caishang was also shocked beyond measure. Her face filled with disbelief, and in an instant, she realized Li Xian possessed a Dual Physique!

What terrifying talent!

A Perfect Aspect was already not inferior to her own, and now it was added with the divine wonder of the "Dual Pupils Aspect." This talent, wisdom, strategy, and capability... truly surpassed what she could match.

"A Dual Physique... there really is a Dual Physique in the world. And... and it is actually the Dual Pupils Aspect!" Wen Caishang murmured.

The Dual Pupils Aspect was also a legendary aspect. Ancient texts called it the "Emperor Aspect" or "Sage Aspect." Looking through the long history of Nanyang, Dayu, and Dawu... the only one known to possess the Dual Pupils Aspect was Li Xian.

Looking further back into the long history of previous dynasties, amidst the changing years, there were only one or two individuals who possessed the Dual Pupils Aspect. But even they were not Dual Physiques!

Wen Caishang suddenly thought: *Does this not mean... such talent is unparalleled in the ages! Such a terrifying talent actually exists in the world!* Her spirit shook violently. Seeing Li Xian’s majestic and overbearing display, the imposing manner that made dragons bow their heads, scared off ghosts and gods, dispersed immortals and Buddhas, and crushed ten thousand armies... it was not empty talk!

Li Xian had traveled a long road, passing through many dangerous situations. He truly had no intention of holding back, but he could always escape danger with clever plans. Therefore, he had never used his many methods to their full extent.

At this moment, with the Dual Pupils Aspect revealed, his hidden cards and moves were all displayed. His spine emitted "cracking" sounds, as if supporting a divine mountain. His long hair danced, and a five-colored halo burst forth.

Supporting various strange phenomena, the red mole on his forehead flashed,衬托得 him似仙似魔. In that instant, all the divine wonders were attached to one person.

Those with Dual Pupils possessed immense strength! Their physical strength could easily support a tripod. Li Xian played the "Attack Sound" and stirred the "Thunder Sound," its power boundless. It was like ten thousand horses and a thousand soldiers charging.

Using the saber as a sword, with a rough yet delicate force, it plowed a deep trench in the ground. Flames rolled over the blade, and sword qi crisscrossed. The power reached its peak, as if slashing down from the top of a towering divine mountain, accumulating infinite momentum, like lifting a mountain to smash it down.

"Ah!"

Zhao Zhiyuan was intimidated by the Dual Pupils, and due to his carelessness and weakened body, he hastily blocked. However, the moment his precious sword touched the great saber, with a "crack," it was actually destroyed.

The strength was so strong, it was hard to believe.

This saber swept through with unstoppable force, and seeing it was about to break the skin and open the belly, Zhao Zhiyuan finally came to his senses: "This little bastard actually has Dual Pupils... Dual Pupils... no wonder! No wonder even Wen Caishang favors him!" He suddenly realized. Martial artists all admired the strong. Shocking talent and outstanding wisdom... were enough to make a woman’s heart flutter and attach herself to him.

He turned his claw strike toward Li Xian’s shoulder, using offense as defense.

Li Xian did not dodge or avoid, knowing the opportunity was hard to come by. With such a surprise attack, if he could not heavily injure Zhao Zhiyuan, it would be difficult to kill him even if the two联手 later.

The life-saving Yang Qi condensed to protect his shoulder. He traded injury for injury. Only a "bang" was heard, and the bones of Li Xian’s shoulder were covered in cracks, almost completely shattered. His bone quality was tough, and he had the life-saving Yang Qi protecting his body, yet it was still so fierce.

This saber slashed down, but it also tore open Zhao Zhiyuan’s belly. Blood splashed, and his intestines almost flowed out. Zhao Zhiyuan restrained his internal energy, furious with shame. "I’ll fight you to the death! Killing a Dual Pupil is worth it!" His long sword was already broken, and under the intimidation of the Dual Pupils, his strength was clearly superior, yet he developed the delusion of a "cornered lamb."

His hands turned into claws, suddenly expanding several circles. The claws swelled, and the skin turned yellowish-brown. This was the "Heavenly Yin Uproaring Sand Palm," attaching water vapor to the claws to strike out of thin air.

Waving the claw tips, the accumulated water vapor burst out from the tips, condensed and sharp, like invisible water mist flying knives. Killing the enemy from a distance, it was very powerful. It could raise fierce winds and turbulent waves, killing from a dozen zhang away, extremely formidable.

Wen Caishang stepped forward and attacked from the side. Her soft sword precisely aimed for Zhao Zhiyuan’s neck. As Zhao Zhiyuan struck with his claw, he had no choice but to protect himself again. Thus, this claw ultimately failed to strike.

Li Xian immediately bent down and swept his leg. Zhao Zhiyuan used lightness skill to evade, pulling away distance. Li Xian and Wen Caishang施展 the Immortal Couple Sword of Yin and Yang, their tacit understanding was like a spark, no words were needed.

Li Xian斩出 two Yang Yuan sword qi. Then he flew forward and贴去,劈砍 with great force and weight. Zhao Zhiyuan was shrouded in the sword momentum, intimidated by the Dual Pupils, and was surrounded by two people, unable to spare the mental energy to think of a countermeasure. He caught the bare blade with his hands, feeling the surging power on the saber.

With a "rumble," the bricks and stones under his feet shattered, and his feet were inserted into the ground.

Wen Caishang saw that the plan was proceeding smoothly. Relying solely on Li Xian and her合璧, it was still difficult to kill him completely. She had hidden in the Four Sages Cave from the beginning, originally to use the mechanisms here to maneuver.

She immediately flicked her finger. A stone shot out from the cave, activating the mechanisms inside. The Four Sages statues opened their mouths and spat out countless flying needles and dense arrows.

Wen Caishang was already standing in a safe position. Li Xian and she施展 sword moves, communicating effortlessly within the swordplay, needing no verbal exchange, they had long understood each other’s intentions. Therefore, they also avoided in advance, hiding in a corner where the flying needles could not reach.

Zhao Zhiyuan’s feet were sunken, and the flying needles suddenly arrived. In an instant, he was pierced by a dozen arrows, blood dripping profusely, looking terrifying. He waved his palms wildly, slapping down countless flying arrows.

If he had been calm enough, he could have dealt with the current crisis. Even if he would be injured, it would not be fatal. But he had encountered accidents one after another, how could he have any calmness? Even if Wen Caishang had suffered a setback, she would not have had a composed demeanor. If Li Xian had not joined hands with her, she would have been captured long ago.

Those who remain calm in adversity are rare in the world. Zhao Zhiyuan looked like a hedgehog, fourteen arrows in the chest, thirty-seven in the back, and many in his thighs and arms...

He roared, "Kill... adulterer and bitch, kill!" and charged forward.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang used the Yin and Yang Dual Swords to circle and fight him. This sword technique combined hardness and softness. The more frantic the opponent, the harder it was to break.

After a moment of entanglement, the second mechanism was activated. The Four Sages sculptures spewed fire from their eyes, burning toward him.

Zhao Zhiyuan had been burned in the Luanfang Mountain, his skin ruined. He had just recovered not long ago, and was now burned miserably again. He had lost his理智, flailing about wildly.

He accidentally triggered a mechanism himself, and sharp poisonous spikes grew out of the ground, piercing his feet until they were bloody and unrecognizable!

Li Xian and Wen Caishang exchanged a glance, seeing that he had become a cornered beast. The two quietly avoided him, intending to escape from the cave. Zhao Zhiyuan suddenly came to his senses and pounced, determined to leave at least one of them behind!

Li Xian施展 the Emerald Silk Palm, his internal energy surging, slowing Zhao Zhiyuan’s momentum. He hugged Wen Caishang and leaped hard, jumping out of the Four Sages Cave. Wen Caishang held a stone, flicked it with her finger, and activated the mechanisms inside the cave again.

The cave door slammed shut.

Inside, the sound of "water" gurgled. This was the third mechanism of the Four Sages Cave, sealing the cave door and pouring in "Lead and Mercury." Wen Caishang knew there was no hope, and had intended to activate this mechanism to take more people down with her.

Who knew that she would be saved instead, trapping Zhao Zhiyuan in the cave, suffering from his injuries and being submerged by Lead and Mercury. Li Xian frowned and收了 the Dual Pupils, the pupils merging into one. In fact, the Dual Pupils strange eye was the norm, while the single pupil normal eye was an intentional disguise.

He breathed heavily. The one-on-one fight just now was truly too fierce. If there was a slight deviation, all three would have been buried in the cave!

Li Xian said solemnly, "Let's go quickly! I am seriously injured. If we encounter anyone else, it will be difficult to deal with them!" Wen Caishang said softly, "Li Lang, follow me... I know a place to leave the tomb!"

Li Xian’s shoulder was pierced by a sword. He used solid blood and closed pores to slow the injury. But every step still caused pain. His shoulder bone was shattered, and after passing the danger, it was extremely difficult to even lift his hand.

Wen Caishang gently stroked the injury, feeling deep pity. Suddenly, she felt immense tenderness and affection. She thought that a man with such talent for the ages had done so much for her. The joy in her heart surpassed the dangers along the way a hundredfold.

In her life, she respected the strong the most. Li Xian’s strong will had made her take notice and fall for him. Now, his revealed talent and strength seemed to conquer her implicitly. She only thought that such a man was hard to find in ancient or modern times. And now he was by her side.

But they were still in danger, and all emotions were restrained. The two fled along the way, using their familiarity with the tomb to travel and hide, avoiding pursuit.

Half a day passed.

Both were out of breath. Li Xian’s recovery ability was strong, his pure Yang body had vigorous energy, and his Dual Pupils body had blood flow like a dragon. But the palm strike from Zhao Zhiyuan had refined and profound energy, truly formidable, clinging on and not dispersing for a long time. Li Xian laughed, "Madam, if we meet enemies again, we will have to be buried together!"

Wen Caishang said softly, "If it really comes to that, there is no other way."

The two fled hand in hand. Suddenly, they heard hurried footsteps, someone was approaching from the front. In the vast tomb, it was likely an enemy, not a friend. Li Xian did not need to think much, looked around, saw a tomb chamber, and pulled Wen Caishang to hide inside.

He lifted the coffin and hid inside.

This place was the "Artisan Chamber."

The tomb took decades to build, and many artisans died from exhaustion or overwork. They were buried here. During the Nanyang period, the states were in chaos, and the people were miserable. Human sacrifices were not uncommon. Lu Dong was unconventional and worldly, to give the artisans a place to rest after death was truly enlightened.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang hid in the coffin of an "Artisan Head."

The corpse had already turned into a skeleton.

The two pressed close, listening to the movements outside.

"Alas, the Artisan Chamber, buried are just some artisans, no treasures, let's just go!"

The voice came from "Su Qiuwu."

"Wait! These corpses are still useful to me. You, you, you, help me push open the coffins, see if there are any corpses that haven't rotted? If there are, drag them out!"

This voice came from Shen Pingping.

It turned out that the group had scattered in the tomb, but wandering around, they met again. They traveled together, also searching for the tomb map and the treasures inside.

The map was already with Li Xian, so they were destined not to find it.

Wen Caishang’s heart tightened. Li Xian frowned, hearing a "rumble," a coffin lid had already been opened.

In this situation, the two would surely be discovered. Even with the "Immortal Couple Sword of Yin and Yang," it would be difficult to escape capture.

Li Xian had a sudden idea, quietly exerting the "Vast Leg" and "Emerald Silk Palm," creating a misty white fog. Then he undid the solid blood and closed pores, scattering his blood, mixing it into the fog, and sprinkling poison powder and foam, disguising it as a mechanism of blood mist and toxic gas. Then he lifted the skeleton and hid beneath it.

With this, they might be able to deceive them.

Soon, the footsteps approached. Two disciples of the Taixin Sect and the Jianyu Lou looked at each other, joined forces to lift the coffin. The coffin lid was pushed open half an inch, and red mist immediately drifted out. Taking a sniff, it immediately rushed up to the nose and dazed the mind, very uncomfortable.

The two disciples looked at each other, not daring to open it further, hastily closed it, skipped this coffin, and went to other coffins to search.

Finally, they found three unrotten zombies. The two disciples carried the corpses out, but did not mention the "blood mist." It was entirely because they knew these people were ruthless. If there really was a mechanism, they would surely be forced to test it with their bodies.

Shen Pingping said, "Not bad, the harvest is acceptable."

Suddenly, a footstep sounded, and a young voice said, "Masters, quickly... quickly! Senior Zhao found a clue to that treacherous woman and has trapped her in one place. Please hurry to reinforce!"

It turned out to be a disciple sent out by Zhao Zhiyuan to ask for help everywhere. Shen Pingping and Su Qiuwu’s eyes lit up, and they said, "Good! That bitch has no way out, she is indeed trapped!"

"Hahaha, excellent, excellent... let us go quickly and capture her. That treacherous woman made me suffer terribly, I lost dozens of zombies. I want to see just how厉害 she is."

"You two go notify the others, summon Li Quan and Qi Beidao. This time, she will have no way out!"

They hurriedly left.

The footsteps went farther and farther, avoiding another dangerous situation. Wen Caishang’s beautiful eyes rippled. She thought: *Li Lang’s talent is unparalleled, and such clever thinking and plans are also beyond the reach of ordinary people. Given time... I... I will need to rely on him.*

After a while.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang came out of the coffin and closed the lid. Wen Caishang asked, "Li Lang, are you alright?" Li Xian shook his head, "I'm fine!"

Wen Caishang said, "The tomb has four directions: east, west, south, and north, each with an exit. Let's hurry and go." Supporting each other, they fled into the distance.

After walking for about half an hour, they saw a disciple of the Jianyu Lou, wandering aimlessly, lost in the tomb.

Li Xian thought: *I am now wearing the attire of the [Wuji Saber Sect], carrying a great saber, and feeling very weak. Su Qiuwu is no longer a threat, but there may be others. The disguise cannot be removed. Changing into the attire of a Jianyu Lou disciple would be perfect!*

He quietly approached, suddenly pounced. One hand covered the mouth, the other struck the chest, and the palm force burst out. With a "crack," the chest bones shattered, the heart meridian was damaged, and he died instantly.

Li Xian stripped off his clothes and put them on. He untied the sword and carried it on his back. Carrying the corpse for a while, he saw several coffins.

He buried the corpse in a coffin.

He lifted the great saber and shook it hard. A long sword fell from the blade, the "Chenjiang Sword." Li Xian was meticulous. Since he was disguised as a Wuji Saber Sect disciple, he naturally could not carry a sword. However, the Chenjiang Sword was very powerful, and he did not want to abandon it.

So he used the sharpness of the sword to carve a groove in the great saber. He embedded the Chenjiang Sword inside. This way, when changing the disguise to Jianyu Lou, he could naturally take it out.

Wen Caishang was very surprised. In the dangerous situation, Li Xian’s thoughts were meticulous, far-sighted, and calm. His wisdom made her admire him.

In her life, she admired the spirit of the Great Wu Taizu the most. She rarely looked at others, but now her beautiful eyes were infatuated, fixed on Li Xian.

Li Xian changed the scabbard of the Chenjiang Sword and carried it on his back. He took off his own clothes and gave them to Wen Caishang. The tomb was dark, Wen Caishang only needed to put them on simply.

Li Xian coughed a few times, his injury was severe. The sword wound on his chest was through-and-through. Although he avoided the vital points, he still damaged his Qi and blood. Wen Caishang gently patted him, both distressed and helpless.

The two walked hand in hand for a while, about to leave the tomb. But they heard Li Quan and Qi Beidao talking again.

Li Xian intended to avoid them. Wen Caishang’s fingers danced lightly, using her fingers as a sword to施展 the Immortal Couple Sword of Yin and Yang to communicate. Meaning: *The exit road must pass through here. Other places naturally have exits, but... other exits require crossing areas via the [Intestine Loop Path], and we would be separated.*

Li Xian used his fingers as a sword, the two gesturing with their fingers, communicating heart to heart: *Good! I will find a way to leave, and I will not separate from you.* Wen Caishang nodded, her heart filled with joy, her beautiful eyes shining with brilliance, moved and joyful beyond words. She gestured: *Let us die together, and not separate.*

Li Xian waited a moment, eavesdropping on Li Quan and Qi Beidao’s conversation.

Li Quan said, "Brother Qi, did you hear any movement?" Qi Beidao said, "There is no movement in this tomb, what is strange about it?"

Li Quan said, "I ran into that Shen Pingping yesterday. Hmph, a little kid, actually ordering me around. Without saying clearly, he made me guard this place. What about you? Why are you also here?"

Li Xian thought: *So it is Shen Pingping. This person is probably proficient in the tomb’s layout. He intentionally sent people to guard the exit. If it weren’t for him, relying on my and the Madam’s understanding of the tomb, we could have safely escaped using the tomb’s layout. His appearance has added many obstacles for us!*

Continuing to eavesdrop.

Qi Beidao said, "I also ran into Shen Pingping halfway. He said guarding here might yield a good harvest. I don’t understand the tomb’s structure, and wandering around would just get me lost. So I just stayed here."

Li Quan said, "That’s not bad. You being here to chat with me is also good." Qi Beidao said, "By the way, the Taixin Four Heroes, why are you the only one? Is there another plan?"

"Ah!" Li Quan said sadly, "Brother Mang and Brother Lu are dead! Brother Hu should be near the Hulu Sect, but I didn't see him!"

"Whew!" Qi Beidao said, "Is this Folding Sword Madam that fierce?"

Li Quan said, "Naturally!" Speaking of this, he couldn't help but curse Su Qiuwu. He said how bad Su Qiuwu’s attitude was, how hypocritical...

Qi Beidao sensed something, and secretly became wary of Su Qiuwu. Li Xian eavesdropped from the side, thinking: *Excellent... I will use this to sow discord and trick the two away from here, then we can escape! But going straight to them is too obvious. Li Quan is as stupid as a dog, naturally easy to trick, but Qi Beidao is hard to say!*

So he had Wen Caishang hide in the shadows. He quietly moved away, then ran quickly, making footsteps.

Li Quan and Qi Beidao looked at each other, shouting, "Who is there!"

Li Xian pretended to be an ordinary disciple of the Jianyu Lou, unfamiliar with the tomb, turning east and west, shouting, "Is anyone there! Is anyone nearby!"

Qi Beidao said, "I'll be right back!" He followed the sound to find Li Xian and brought him to Li Quan.

Li Xian’s face was stained with blood, his hair was disheveled, and the tomb was dark. He was not recognized by Li Quan and Qi Beidao.

Qi Beidao said, "A disciple of the Jianyu Lou? You are also lost, coming here?"

Li Xian said, "Yes... yes... Junior is indeed lost. I was entrusted by Senior Zhao with a message. I walked and walked and lost my direction, could only wander aimlessly."

Qi Beidao said calmly, "What message?"

Li Xian said, "Senior Zhao found a clue to that treacherous woman and trapped her in front of the Four Sages Cave! He sent us out to ask for help!"

"What!?" Li Quan said, "There is a clue to that demon woman! Good! Good, this time you won't be able to run!"

Qi Beidao frowned and said, "Oh? Is that so?" He scrutinized Li Xian.

Li Xian thought: *This Qi Beidao is not easy to fool. He was just talking about Su Qiuwu, and his words showed no liking for the man. They are probably wary of each other. I'll try to use this to provoke him.* He said, "Yes... yes! Just now, this disciple was wandering and ran into Senior Su Qiuwu and Senior Shen Pingping. The two seniors heard the news and also hurriedly went."

"Zhao... Senior Zhao said that the demon woman has the tomb map. If we can capture her alive, we can get out of this ghost place, two seniors! Please hurry and help!"

"Really!?" Qi Beidao’s heart tightened.

Li Xian said, "Whether it's true or not, this disciple does not dare to guarantee, but... I hope it is true."

Li Xian said to Li Quan, "Senior, Junior has... has a request. Junior was sent by Senior Zhao to deliver a message. But walking and walking, I am completely lost. If possible, could Senior take me along, back to the Four Sages Cave, to gather with the other seniors and disciples? Relying on... relying on Junior alone, I really... really don't know how to walk."

Li Quan sneered, "You little brat, are quite interesting. This would be a trivial matter, but coincidentally, you received Senior Zhao’s order, and you are also under Su Qiuwu. I naturally dislike you. Even if it's a trivial matter, heh, I just won't lift a finger, what can you do?"

Li Xian changed color, "This... this..."

"Hahaha!" Li Quan said, "Get lost." He casually threw Li Xian, sending him flying. He crashed heavily against the wall.

Qi Beidao said, "This matter cannot be delayed. We are both completely unfamiliar with the tomb. Finding the Four Sages Cave will take some time. If we are late... they might get the map, and they may not come back to find us. Let's set off quickly!"

Li Quan said, "Good! That Su Qiuwu小子, very likely would do such a thing."

The two used lightness skill and went far away. Li Xian breathed a sigh of relief. The rhythm of his words just now was all calculated in his heart. It was not difficult to trick Qi Beidao and Li Quan away. If he told the truth, the two would likely not sit still.

But tricking the two away while leaving himself behind would be very suspicious. Li Quan was foolish, but Qi Beidao might not be. Therefore, Li Xian cleverly used Li Quan’s dislike for Su Qiuwu and Zhao Zhiyuan.

He had spoken well with Qi Beidao, but suddenly and voluntarily pleaded with Li Quan. This was to provoke Li Quan to refuse. Since Li Quan refused, Qi Beidao would have nothing more to say.

Thus, all the dangers were overcome one by one.

After a while.

Wen Caishang hurried over, helped Li Xian up, and said softly, "Li Lang! Are you alright!?" Li Xian said, "I'm... I'm fine, just my chest bones hurt a bit. Let's hurry and go!"

Wen Caishang nodded repeatedly, saying, "Good! Good!" She supported Li Xian. Through a series of dangerous situations, Li Xian was covered in injuries, all serious.

The two passed the main road and encountered no more obstacles. They quickly reached an exit and climbed up along a mountain crevice.

Li Xian’s right shoulder was severely injured, hard to lift. He used his remaining internal energy to施展 lightness skill, supporting himself as he climbed. Over a dozen zhang of distance, he gradually climbed out of the tomb.

A gentle breeze blew, filled with a mystical aura.

They left the entire Sword Alliance behind in the tomb.

The two rested for a moment, not daring to delay for half a minute. They immediately descended the side peak.

"Screech!"

Suddenly, a large red-crowned, white-footed crane flapped its wings and came over.

It held a pill in its beak.
