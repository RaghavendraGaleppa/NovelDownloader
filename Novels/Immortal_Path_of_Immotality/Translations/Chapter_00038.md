# Chapter 38: The Wharf Incident  

Two days later, Lin Shan and Protector Jiang galloped away from Zangke County. Before leaving, Lin Shan specifically sought out the funeral shop owner, Master Wu, in the western part of the city and introduced his five subordinates to Mr. Zhao.  

Upon learning of the five men's "extraordinary talents" in the field of "archaeology," Mr. Zhao immediately treated them as honored guests, valuing them greatly. Before parting, the elders of the Zhao family all wanted to see Lin Shan off, but he firmly declined. He had no patience for sentimental farewells—his mind was set on reaching the capital to meet fellow cultivators and explore opportunities for ancient aura and treasures.  

Lin Shan now carried 8,000 taels of gold, all converted into official banknotes from the Song Dynasty's designated institutions for easy travel. Their journey would take them from the Southern Border to Luzhou Prefecture, then by boat down the Jialing River, through Jingxiang to Jiangling, and finally north to the imperial capital, Bianliang. The route spanned tens of thousands of miles, and Lin Shan intended to stop at every city along the way, seizing any ancient artifacts imbued with aura.  

With ample wealth and strength, he no longer needed to tread cautiously. As long as he didn't overstep, no faction would dare provoke a cultivator.

After leaving Zangke County, at Lin Shan's request, Protector Jiang accompanied him to his hometown, Qinghe County. Upon arrival, Lin Shan discreetly inquired at the Lin Family Escort Agency and learned that Master Pu had never returned since the escort mission two years ago.  

Lin Shan knew that the ambush had been orchestrated by the county magistrate, and Protector Jiang confirmed that the contact person had indeed been the county deputy, Yang Huaili. He infiltrated Yang's residence and interrogated him.  

Yang, faced with an intruder he couldn't resist, admitted that while some survivors of the ambush had been captured and imprisoned, Master Pu was not among them. Lin Shan freed the imprisoned escorts but found no trace of Master Pu. With no leads, he could only assume Master Pu had gone into hiding.  

Before leaving, Lin Shan quietly returned to the Lin residence, gazing at the small room where he had lived for ten years before departing without a word.  

As they left, he overheard Lin family members discussing Lin Fan—how a passing immortal had taken him as a disciple a year prior, an event that had become the talk of Qinghe County.

After three days of riding, Lin Shan and Protector Jiang arrived in Luzhou. Disappointingly, Lin Shan found no artifacts of interest in the city. He reflected that his previous discoveries—whether the golden bell or the Buddha statues—had all originated from the Yelang Ancient Tomb, relics of the Black Lotus Sect, once a cultivation faction. The remaining tokens were remnants of the ancient Nightingale organization.  

The scarcity of aura-infused artifacts made their discovery rare. Resigned, Lin Shan and Protector Jiang boarded a boat down the Jialing River.  

As they sailed past towering cliffs, Lin Shan recalled a famous line from his past life:  

*"Amid the cries of apes on both banks, the light boat has passed countless mountains."*  

After enjoying the scenery, he returned to the cabin to cultivate.

Half a month later, they arrived in Jiangling, a bustling trade hub of the Jingxiang region. The city was wealthy, home to centuries-old families and prominent martial sects, though rampant river piracy plagued its waters.  

Disembarking at the public wharf, they learned that the remaining thirty miles to Jiangling were monopolized by the local gang, Three Heads Dock. Outsiders had no choice but to transfer to the gang's boats.  

Though the arrangement was domineering, Lin Shan and Protector Jiang had no intention of challenging it. They queued up, but as the morning wore on, groups from various factions kept cutting in, rushing toward Dongting Lake.  

The crowd buzzed with speculation:  

"What's happening? Why is everyone heading to Dongting Lake?"  

"I don't know! That group was from the Hong family of Lingling County!"  

"And those were members of the Divine Fist Sect from Wuling!"  

Lin Shan and Protector Jiang grew impatient. When another group—this time in red robes—tried to cut in, Protector Jiang blocked their path.  

"Go back," he said tersely.  

The red-robed men were stunned. Their leader, a young man, frowned. "Brother, we're from the Freeblade Sect. We're in a hurry—please step aside."  

Protector Jiang jutted his chin toward the back of the line. "Queue."  

The sect members bristled. "Who do you think you are?"  

The leader, Ren Wukuang, held up a hand to silence them. "Friend, we're pressed for time. Here's fifty taels as compensation." He tossed a silver ingot, which Protector Jiang ignored.  

Ren Wukuang's patience wore thin. "I'm Ren Wukuang, son of the Freeblade Sect's leader, Ren Wuyou. Give us face."  

Lin Shan found the name "Ren Wukuang" (lit. "As Arrogant As I Please") ironic, given the man's restrained demeanor.  

Protector Jiang remained unmoved. He didn't care about offending the Freeblade Sect—once back in the capital, they'd be powerless against the Nightingale headquarters.  

Seeing their leader's authority challenged, the sect members charged forward.
