# Chapter 1: This World Has Immortals!

**Winter, 18th Day of the Eleventh Month - The Cold Deepens**

Nightfall.

South of Yong'an City, in Yanping Alley at Zhang's Medicinal Shop.

The lights burned bright as shadows moved about.

"Jing'er, once you enter the Daoist Academy, you must be careful in your conduct. Take care not to offend the immortal masters there."

Inside the room.

A gentle-mannered middle-aged woman deftly packed clothes into a bundle while repeating her admonitions. The wrinkles at the corners of her eyes were tightly knit, as if layered with unshakeable worry.

As the saying goes: A mother worries when her child travels a thousand miles.

But this journey of her son's would span far more than a thousand miles.

Opposite the woman.

"Mother," Zhang Jing couldn't help but feel moved as he watched the busy figure before him, "I understand all this."

Yet Zhang's mother continued as if she hadn't heard:

"Though you've earned your teacher's favor, you must remember that beyond every mountain lies a higher peak. The Dragon Lake Daoist Academy is not like Yong'an Academy—it gathers countless brilliant talents from the sixty-five prefectures across the thirteen provinces of our Nanli Kingdom. Those with greater natural gifts than yours will be as numerous as fish in a river."

"Pay particular attention to those from noble families and powerful clans. If trouble arises, take a step back first to avoid bringing calamity upon yourself."

"You're my only child. I don't ask that you pass the academy's trials to become an immortal—only that you return safely—"

As she spoke, Zhang's mother discreetly wiped the corner of her eye.

"Don't worry, Mother. I'll be careful," Zhang Jing quickly reassured her.

"Jing'er, don't pressure yourself."

Across from them, Zhang's father set down the medical text in his hands and said with a smile, "Just do your best on this journey."

Meeting his parents' hopeful gazes, Zhang Jing nodded solemnly.

"Father, Mother, don't worry. I'll take good care of myself."

...

*Clang—clang! Clang!*

"Midnight hour—all is peaceful—"

The night watchman's distant call drifted in, hazy and drowsy.

Yet at this moment, no one in the room felt the slightest bit sleepy.

"Wife, I recall you once mentioned being from the Cangwu Li Clan in Yun Province, that you fled to Yong'an only after suffering from a demonic disaster. Did anyone from the Li Clan ever participate in the academy's trials before?"

Zhang's father asked cautiously, his voice tinged with unease.

"Husband, you're asking whether our Jing'er has any chance of passing, aren't you?"

Without waiting for his reply, Zhang's mother sighed and said quietly:

"It's difficult! Back then, five members of the Li main lineage took the trials, and not a single one passed."

"In truth, even among the noble scions of the Nanli Dynasty, very few succeed. And with us being but common folk, we can offer Jing'er little support..."

The room fell silent.

After a long while.

"Ah... indeed!" Zhang's father said bitterly, "The Dragon Lake Daoist Academy is, after all, an immortal legacy that has stood tall for a thousand years. If the trials were truly so easy, that would be abnormal."

Then, changing the subject, he asked:

"Wife, did you give Jing'er the silver?"

"Don't worry, husband. I took all our family's savings and borrowed some from a few neighbors—twenty-seven taels in total, all packed in Jing'er's bundle."

"That's good... that's very good."

"That's all we can do for Jing'er now. Oh, wife, I've been thinking—perhaps we should accept their offer regarding the shop."

"Has the Hundred Herbs Pavilion come to see you again?"

Hearing this, Zhang's mother's face showed concern.

"Yes! I think we should accept even if the price is low. If we delay further, we might lose not just the silver but also... after all, Jing'er is still young. The owner of Hundred Herbs Pavilion recently befriended an immortal master—even the yamen officials now defer to him. Our family can't afford to provoke them."

Zhang's father sighed, then continued:

"After selling the shop and repaying the neighbors, we might have a little left. When Jing'er returns, our family of three can leave Yong'an and avoid this mess. Heh, with my skills, I won't let you two go hungry."

At the same time.

Just two walls away.

On the table, the flickering lamp emitted thin wisps of black smoke.

*'In the 18th year of Wanxing during Nanli, the immortal Mingyou Daoist passed through Qingmu County of Yuan Province. Moved by the hardships of the people's travels, he summoned a flying sword to cleave through the hundred-li Iron Veil Mountains, turning a perilous barrier into an open road. The grateful people erected shrines in his honor, and the incense offerings have continued unbroken since.'*

*'33rd year of Zhongyuan, Yin Province.'*

*'A great demon calling itself the Black Mountain Lord emerged from the Black Mountains with a horde of beasts, devouring three thousand households. Three counties were draped in mourning white, every home wailing in grief—none who heard could hold back their tears.'*

*'A Dragon Lake immortal of the Deng Clan heard of this and traveled a thousand li to slay countless demons. The Black Mountain Lord transformed into a thirty-zhang three-headed black tiger, summoning black winds and yellow sands to blot out the sky. Yet it was no match—fleeing in terror.'*

*'3rd year of Longhua, Yun Province.'*

*'The Nether Banquet Ghost Kingdom manifested, swallowing the lands of Cangwu and Langya prefectures, turning the people into blood sacrifices until bones piled into mountains. A mysterious immortal from Dragon Lake Daoist Academy rode the winds, transforming into a dragon that carried a jade disc in its maw to suppress a hundred thousand ghost soldiers.'*

*'17th year of Longhua...'*

With a soft *snap*, Zhang Jing closed the nearly worn-out *Records of Immortal Seekers*, exhaled lightly, and sighed:

"Such grandeur in the Dao of Immortals, yet demons and monsters abound!"

"Being mortal in this world is truly perilous. One might inexplicably fall victim to disaster any day, reduced to a passing mention in books—phrases like 'the people perished' or 'became blood sacrifices'—without even leaving behind a name."

"Mortals are but ants—their fates not their own! To rise above this—"

Zhang Jing clenched his fists quietly.

"Only the Dao of Immortals can achieve it!"

"Moreover, having crossed into this great world where immortals and gods exist, with the path to eternal life right before me, how could I resign myself to being ordinary? This journey to Dragon Lake Daoist Academy is my chance!"

Indeed!

Zhang Jing was an unremarkable transmigrator, and the Dragon Lake Daoist Academy he was about to attend was the very one mentioned in *Records of Immortal Seekers*.

Of the thirteen recorded tales of immortals in the book, nine were connected to Dragon Lake Daoist Academy.

What this implied was obvious even to a fool.

For this reason, the academy's entrance trials were called "Leaping the Dragon Gate"—only the top geniuses from each province and prefecture qualified to participate.

The difficulty and intensity of competition were beyond imagination.

By all rights, given Zhang Jing's family background and innate talent, he should have had no hope.

However—

Zhang Jing took a deep breath.

"Fortunately, there's still the jade talisman!"

The next moment, he closed his eyes and "looked" directly at the square jade talisman before him—both real and illusory.

The jade talisman had crossed over with him.

Its exact origins were unknown, and Zhang Jing had no intention of delving deeper for now.

He focused his attention on the front of the talisman, where two lines of ancient golden script shimmered faintly at the top.

**[Three Books and Six Classics·Lv. 9 (9997/10000)]**  
**[Skill Traits: Keen Ears (Mortal), Clear Eyes (Mortal), Tranquil Mind (Mortal)]**

The Three Books and Six Classics referred to the nine canonical texts taught by the master of Yong'an Academy.

Zhang Jing's ability to stand out among thousands of students at Yong'an Academy and earn a spot in Dragon Lake Daoist Academy's trials relied chiefly on this jade talisman, which functioned like a proficiency panel.

"Only 3 experience points left... I won't sleep tonight. I'll grind out the last bit and see what reaching Level 10 brings."

"Perhaps a new skill trait?" A glimmer of anticipation flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Previously, when **[Three Books and Six Classics]** reached Levels 1, 4, and 7, the traits Keen Ears, Clear Eyes, and Tranquil Mind had appeared.

With these three traits enhancing him, Zhang Jing had barely stepped into the realm of geniuses.

If Level 10 granted another trait, his chances of passing the academy's trials would increase significantly.

With this thought, Zhang Jing steadied his mind, reopened *On Attaining Knowledge* before him, and gradually immersed himself in its contents.

Time flowed silently.

On the jade talisman, the golden script shifted imperceptibly.
