**Chapter 127: You Are Not Worth My Sword**  

After meeting with Butcher Hu, Zhou Qing went to check on the progress of the spirit fields with Xiao Ruowang.  

Xiao Ruowang pointed to the former site of the Great Zhou imperial mausoleum, where a thousand acres of spirit fields had now been cultivated, densely planted with spirit grains.  

"The spirit grains you bestowed come in several varieties. After experimenting with agricultural experts, we found that the most suitable for cultivation is the Dragon-Patterned Rice."  

Xiao Ruowang explained further: Because the Great Zhou mausoleum was situated on a dragon vein, the Dragon-Patterned Rice flourished under the nourishing dragon qi. Additionally, Yuan Mingyue’s formations drew geothermal fire, raising the temperature around the fields, allowing for two harvests a year.  

Beyond that, they had also dedicated a single acre of spirit fields, fertilized with the flesh and blood of serpentine demon beasts, meticulously cultivated in an attempt to produce premium-grade Dragon-Patterned Rice. The first harvest was expected next year.  

This premium-grade rice would likely benefit both Foundation Establishment and Body Forging cultivators.  

Zhou Qing toured the spirit fields with Xiao Ruowang, observing the outer sect disciples responsible for cultivation. After a thoughtful pause, he retrieved a sheet of parchment.  

Soon, tiny figures appeared on the parchment, each in a different pose. Upon closer inspection, the figures seemed to move, and faint breathing sounds could be heard from them...  

Xiao Ruowang couldn’t help but marvel. Elder Zhou had infused his spiritual intent into the technique, making it easy for practitioners to grasp the basics.  

"This technique is designed to complement spirit farming, isn’t it?" As a Body Forging cultivator, Xiao Ruowang immediately recognized its significance.  

Zhou Qing nodded. "Let’s call it the Spirit Farmer Technique. It’s derived from the Evergreen Immortality Art, combining farming and martial arts. However, this is just a rough draft. If there are any flaws, feel free to refine it further."  

Xiao Ruowang accepted the parchment with delight.  

Previously, the disciples tending the spirit fields had practiced other techniques, but none were as fitting as the Spirit Farmer Technique.

Returning to his water manor, Zhou Qing surfaced and activated his Eye of Truth to survey the surrounding waters. Curious, he traveled hundreds of miles beyond Tianxuan City to a high peak, observing the city’s aura.  

With his Eye of Truth now at the third layer, Zhou Qing’s perception of auras had ascended to a new level. He could even discern traces of "vitality."  

In Tianxuan City, the Heavenly Profound Ancestor made no effort to conceal his aura—his life force blazed like a scorching sun.  

This late-stage Golden Core elder could rival mid-stage Golden Core experts with his physical body alone. Undoubtedly, he was the undisputed strongest Golden Core cultivator in the Jingyang Dao Domain.  

Not even the demonic beasts of the same realm could stand against him alone.  

The Heavenly Profound Ancestor’s unrestrained aura was a long-standing tradition, serving as a deterrent to the demonic races.  

---  

However, Zhou Qing’s Eye of Truth could perceive something deeper within that vitality.  

"Less than thirty years of lifespan remaining." Through his Eye of Truth and the insights of his Evergreen Scripture, Zhou Qing made this judgment.  

It seemed that during the last beast tide, the Heavenly Profound Ancestor had expended significant vitality to intimidate the demonic races, ensuring they wouldn’t target human settlements with Golden Core-level attacks.  

"My estimation is rough. If the Heavenly Profound Ancestor refrains from attempting a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul realm, his lifespan could extend another decade or two." Zhou Qing sighed softly. But having reached this stage, how could the elder possibly give up the chance to ascend?  

Zhou Qing deduced that within thirty years, the Heavenly Profound Ancestor would undoubtedly make a full-force attempt to reach the Nascent Soul realm.  

If he failed, the countdown to the end of the strongest human cultivator in the Jingyang Dao Domain would begin.  

Without the third layer of the Eye of Truth, Zhou Qing would never have been able to perceive such details from the elder’s vitality. The Evergreen Scripture’s insights into lifespan were crucial.  

Others, lacking Zhou Qing’s Eye of Truth, would only feel awe at the Heavenly Profound Ancestor’s overwhelming aura, mistaking his blazing vitality for proof of his indomitable strength.  

This naturally stabilized morale in Tianxuan City and intimidated the demonic races.  

Many cultivators in the city likely believed the Heavenly Profound Ancestor had at least sixty more years of life.  

Regardless, the top Foundation Establishment experts of Tianxuan City and the four major demonic sects were preparing to attempt Golden Core breakthroughs. With no Golden Core-level demonic beasts attacking during the beast tide, their risks of death were minimized, and they could even seize opportunities for gains.  

If humanity was fortunate enough to produce two or three new Golden Core elders during this time, they might be able to hold out a little longer after the Heavenly Profound Ancestor’s passing.  

But without someone of his caliber—capable of single-handedly slaying late-stage Golden Core demonic beasts—the deterrent against the demonic races would weaken significantly.  

Unless one of the four demonic sect leaders could reach the Heavenly Profound Ancestor’s current level.  

If the elder could hold on for another sixty years, one of them might advance to late-stage Golden Core. But even then, they would still fall short of his prowess.  

Now, according to Zhou Qing’s estimation, that window had shrunk to about thirty years—a pressing deadline.  

Moreover, without a Nascent Soul-level powerhouse emerging, humanity would never truly revive in the Jingyang Dao Domain.  

Zhou Qing withdrew his gaze and prepared to visit the Desolate Ridge Market.  

The next beast tide was only a year away—it was coming soon!  

---  

At that moment, three Foundation Establishment experts from Tianxuan City appeared in the underground market of Desolate Ridge.  

The vast market was shrouded in dark clouds. The market’s overseer, Immortal Luo, and her subordinates watched helplessly as the gathered rogue cultivators were casually driven away by one of the Foundation Establishment experts. Screams of agony echoed through the market, and the faces of Immortal Luo’s group darkened.  

"Esteemed senior, why have you come to Desolate Ridge?" Immortal Luo stepped forward first.  

The Foundation Establishment expert was none other than Ye Chong, one of the infamous "Three Tyrants of Tianxuan," a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator nearing late-stage, a veteran of multiple beast tides.  

"Ninth-level Qi Refinement—not bad. But you’re not qualified to speak to me. Call out the master of this market," Ye Chong said arrogantly, hands behind his back, his black hair fluttering in the wind.  

Suddenly, a surge of scorching life force erupted in the air. Fu Song, his Body Forging furnace activated, strode through the air on swirling currents of energy. He glared coldly at Ye Chong. "Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this intrusion?"  

Ye Chong glanced at him indifferently. "I’d heard rumors of a Foundation Establishment expert behind the Desolate Ridge market, but I didn’t expect it to be a Body Forging cultivator."  

As he spoke, a protective spiritual glow enveloped him.  

Though Ye Chong was one of the Three Tyrants, his aura suggested Fu Song was only at the early stage of Body Forging. However, Body Forging cultivators were notoriously formidable in close combat, so Ye Chong remained cautious.  

Before appearing, Fu Song had already notified Zhou Qing. Thus, he didn’t attack outright—delaying was the plan. Fu Song recognized Ye Chong as one of the Three Tyrants, at least a mid-stage Foundation Establishment expert.  

But once Zhou Qing arrived, what did the Three Tyrants matter?  

They’d be crushed like insects!  

Fu Song pressed on. "What exactly do you want?"  

Ye Chong smirked. "The Desolate Ridge market is quite profitable. Fellow Daoist Jin Guang and I have taken a liking to this place. Out of respect for our shared humanity, I won’t exterminate you all. Just withdraw peacefully and let my disciples and the Jin family take over."  

Fu Song scoffed. "You’re quite bold."  

Ye Chong chuckled. "Body Forging cultivators excel in combat but lack large-scale destructive techniques, which is why they’ve declined in the Jingyang Dao Domain. As a Body Forging cultivator, you must be confident in one-on-one battles. If you can last half an incense stick’s time against me, I’ll grant you ten percent of the market’s profits."  

Fu Song countered, "And if you lose?"  

Ye Chong laughed heartily. "How could I lose?"  

The moment he finished speaking, Fu Song drew a high-grade magic artifact forged by Zhou Qing—the Azure Dragon Spear. The spear roared like a dragon, crackling with overwhelming true energy as it lunged at Ye Chong.  

Ye Chong’s body erupted with three streams of black miasma, converging on Fu Song from all sides.  

Fu Song unleashed his true energy, desperately fending off the dark miasma.  

But this was Nether Yin Ghost Miasma. If their strengths had been equal, Fu Song’s life force-infused energy would have countered it. However, the miasma’s power far surpassed his early-stage Body Forging cultivation.  

Instead, Fu Song found himself bogged down, as if trapped in quicksand.  

Ye Chong remained composed, methodically eroding Fu Song’s defenses with the ghostly miasma.  

He knew Body Forging cultivators had terrifying burst potential and didn’t want to risk a desperate counterattack.  

Half an incense stick’s time was more than enough.  

As time passed, Ye Chong’s advantage grew. The ghostly wails of the miasma intensified, pressing Fu Song further into retreat.  

"Elder Qinglingzi is losing!" Yu Qing muttered anxiously.  

Immortal Luo shook her head. "Actually, this elder isn’t the Qinglingzi we met before."  

She had long noticed Fu Song wasn’t the same person but had kept it to herself.  

Yu Qing was stunned. "No wonder Elder Qinglingzi seemed weaker. Then where is the real Elder Qinglingzi?"  

Immortal Luo sighed. "I don’t know. Fellow Daoist Yu, we must prepare to act. Regardless, this elder must be closely tied to Elder Qinglingzi to stand in his stead here."  

Yu Qing and the others nodded. Having been saved by Zhou Qing multiple times, they refused to back down, even against a Foundation Establishment expert.  

The four of them summoned their magic artifacts.  

Seeing this, Ye Chong sneered. "A few fireflies daring to challenge the moon?"  

He prepared to divert his attention and teach them a lesson.  

At that moment, Fu Song, now cornered by the ghostly miasma, shouted into the air, "Qingzi, save me!"  

Ye Chong tensed, but his spiritual sense detected nothing.  

Then horror dawned on his face as a streak of flame tore through the miasma like sunlight piercing dark clouds. The oppressive atmosphere of the market instantly lifted.  

Ye Chong hastily withdrew his Nether Yin Ghost Miasma.  

In the sky, a figure stood with hands behind his back, robes fluttering in the wind. A terrifying sword intent radiated from him.  

"A sword cultivator?" Ye Chong’s heart trembled.  

Fu Song hurried to Zhou Qing’s side, grumbling, "Qingzi, you were watching the show the whole time, weren’t you?"  

Zhou Qing replied via spiritual sense, "I just arrived."  

Fu Song didn’t believe him.  

Ignoring his senior brother, Zhou Qing regarded Ye Chong coolly.  

Under that invisible pressure, Ye Chong asked grimly, "You’re the true master of Desolate Ridge, aren’t you?"  

Zhou Qing smiled faintly but didn’t answer.  

Fu Song interjected, "If you know what’s good for you, leave now. Otherwise, today will be your last."  

Ye Chong laughed loudly. "No matter who you are, Desolate Ridge is mine today."  

In truth, seizing the market was secondary. They had received intelligence that Desolate Ridge housed a docile wood-attributed demonic plant. Both Ye Chong and the Jin family coveted it and had joined forces to take over the market and claim the plant.  

Zhou Qing said calmly, "Make your move."  

Ye Chong’s mind reeled as an overwhelming pressure engulfed him. A deafening tiger’s roar exploded in his consciousness.  

"A soul cultivator? No!" Ye Chong’s thoughts raced. The sword intent emanating from Zhou Qing was nothing like the sinister arts of soul cultivators.  

Dazed by the tiger’s roar, his focus shattered.  

The moment Zhou Qing spoke, he appeared before Ye Chong.  

Boom!  

A blast of Crimson Sun Divine Lightning shattered Ye Chong’s miasma barrier.  

Before Ye Chong could react, Zhou Qing’s hand clamped onto his shoulder. Azurewood Divine Lightning surged from Zhou Qing’s palm, piercing Ye Chong’s protective robes and sealing his vital points. An icy chill instantly encased his entire body in frost.  

The entire process left Ye Chong no room to resist.  

It was far too fast.  

Most crucially, Zhou Qing had attacked his mind first, creating an opening that rendered Ye Chong’s techniques useless.  

And Zhou Qing hadn’t used a sword—he’d used lightning.  

Ye Chong had braced for a sword strike, never expecting the man radiating sword intent to wield such masterful lightning arts—Crimson Sun Divine Lightning, no less, the perfect counter to his Nether Yin Ghost Miasma.  

The earlier flames had been Azure Sun Spirit Fire, which also countered the miasma but not as effectively as the divine lightning.  

Ye Chong had assumed he could guard against the flames, never anticipating this.  

"A sword cultivator resorting to such underhanded tricks?" Ye Chong roared indignantly through spiritual sense.  

"You’re not worth my sword," Zhou Qing replied, delivering the final blow without bothering to explain he wasn’t a sword cultivator.  

Ye Chong tried to rally his spiritual sense, but Zhou Qing cast Soul Confusion, leaving him momentarily bewildered. His hostility toward Zhou Qing faded.  

Then Zhou Qing unleashed Mind Disruption, thoroughly scrambling Ye Chong’s consciousness.  

"Fellow Daoist, please release Fellow Daoist Ye."  

A voice rang out as a cultivator in golden robes appeared nearby, his aura unfathomable, his spiritual pressure suffocating.  

Immortal Luo and the others below struggled to breathe.  

"The Jin family’s ancestor?"  

"I dare not claim such a title. I am Jin Guang. This was a misunderstanding—we didn’t realize you were here."  

Jin Guang was the patriarch of Tianxuan’s Jin family, a peak Foundation Establishment expert far surpassing ordinary late-stage cultivators, reputedly the closest to Golden Core.  

Facing such a figure, Zhou Qing didn’t let his guard down. He tossed Ye Chong aside casually as his spiritual sense clashed invisibly with Jin Guang’s in the air.  

His spiritual sense was also at the peak of Foundation Establishment!  

Jin Guang’s expression shifted slightly.
