# Chapter 556: The Blood-God Demon-Corrosion Scripture

He slowly rose and strode steadily out of the meditation chamber.

The heavy stone door slid open without a sound.

Xu Yunfan’s figure appeared outside the cave dwelling, positioned directly beneath the massive light screen of the protective array.

He did not look at the blood shadow clamoring beyond the peak. Instead, he casually raised his hand and, with nimble fingers, snapped them in the void, forming an incredibly profound hand seal.

*Hum!*

At the summit of the Divine Thunder Peak, the massive array-eye thunderstone that had been dormant all this time suddenly erupted with a brilliant purple light.

Condensed thunder runes shot up from every part of the mountain like awakened swimming dragons, instantly weaving into a complex and massive network of thunder runes that covered the entire peak.

The terrifying late-stage Foundation Establishment pressure that had been pressing down on everyone like a solid mountain suddenly lightened as the rune network formed. It seemed to be instantly unraveled and assimilated by this majestic thunder, transforming into a gentle breeze that merely rustled the mountain grass and the disciples' clothes.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan felt a hint of satisfaction. Over the years, aside from cultivation, he hadn't forgotten to study the Dao of Arrays in his spare time.

With the help of his attribute panel, he had perfected the "Preliminary Understanding of Arrays." He had even spent the contribution points he had accumulated over the years at Cold Crow Pass to exchange for the "Advanced Array Comprehension." Now, he was firmly a master of the craft.

Arrays, by nature, are methods that leverage the timing and terrain of the heavens to pry open the vast power of the world. With a fraction of one's strength, one can achieve a thousand or even ten thousand times the effect.

"Phew..."

From various locations on the Divine Thunder Peak, disciples who had narrowly escaped death gasped for breath, their backs soaked in sweat. While their hearts still trembled with fear, their gazes toward the tall figure at the peak were filled with fanatical awe and reliance.

Only then did Xu Yunfan raise his eyes. Through the shimmering barrier of the array, his cold gaze fell upon the figure standing in the void beyond the peak.

The visitor was none other than the current rotating guardian of the Scripture Pavilion.

The Blood Elder Demon.

He was nine feet tall, withered and thin, yet he wore a wide, scarlet robe that seemed to be condensed from endless blood light. Under the sunlight, the robe shimmered with a bloody hue, as if thousands of resentful souls were struggling and wailing.

His face was even more bizarre and grotesque. One side was plump and fleshy like a baby's, while the other was withered and decayed like a zombie's. One eye was emerald green like a snake's pupil, and the other was murky and white like a dead fish's eye. The combination was indescribably sinister and terrifying.

Currently, he was radiating the distinct, immense pressure of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, stirring the spiritual energy of the surrounding world. A thick scent of blood and a piercing chill of resentment intertwined and spread, making the half of the sky behind him seem stained with a layer of filthy blood.

Within the ocean of blood light, countless twisted faces faintly appeared, letting out silent shrieks.

The Blood-God Demon-Corrosion Scripture.

Xu Yunfan knew of it. To cultivate this scripture, one must commit no small amount of killing.

Although this scripture was detrimental to one's virtue, once one condensed a Dao Foundation and gathered a sea of blood, one could naturally hide one's sins and blood sea within it. Furthermore, one could gather these sins to pollute others with the blood sea.

It was extremely disgusting.

But Xu Yunfan’s expression remained calm, even with a faint, mocking smile on his lips. He spoke out clearly, his voice piercing through the array and echoing between the two sides.

"I was wondering who would be so bold as to act so recklessly, barking at the gates of my Divine Thunder Peak. So it's you, the old scoundrel from the Scripture Pavilion.

Your disciple offended me and brought his fate upon himself. He had his head taken by some beast from who knows where. What of it?

As his master, instead of chasing that beast, you come here to throw your weight around?"

His words were sharp and left no room for face-saving.

Since the other party was not a True Lord descending in person, Xu Yunfan naturally had no fear of him.

Within the Primal Origin Sect, if one tolerated a challenge from someone of the same level, others would naturally think one was easy to bully.

Xu Yunfan would not and could not yield.

If he yielded, the Divine Thunder Peak would never know peace again.

Moreover, he had the home-field advantage. The Divine Thunder Peak was covered in countless arrays laid by Xu Yunfan, interlocking with each other to the point where they were not weaker than the protective array of Cold Crow Pass.

Xu Yunfan was not afraid at all.

The Blood Elder Demon’s emerald snake-eye suddenly contracted into a thin line, and the muscles on his withered cheek twitched violently. He let out a hoarse roar, like a broken bellows.

"Nonsense! Don't you dare twist the truth here! I left a mark on the plaza outside the Scripture Pavilion.

The method used on him before his death to seize his fortune and plant a calamity seed is clearly the trace of the 'Nether Erosion Heaven Talisman' you took from the Scripture Pavilion.

It's even mixed with that nauseating thunder aura of the Divine Thunder Peak. I have painstakingly sought him for five reincarnations, finally finding a disciple with such deep fortune and a destiny that matches mine...

I hadn't even had the chance to cultivate him into the perfect vessel, yet you, you wretch, you dared to destroy my path to the Dao!

Today, I will surely extract your soul and refine your spirit, turning you into a blood-ghost puppet, never to be reincarnated for eternity!"

The Primal Origin Sect forbids fellow disciples from harming each other without cause.

"Vessel? Path to the Dao?"

Xu Yunfan let out a scoff as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world, the disdain in his eyes growing even stronger.

"Senior Brother Blood, Senior Brother Blood, so this is what you were planning.

No wonder that boy had such deep fortune despite looking like his foundation had been drained, yet his bones were surprisingly good. It turns out you, an old ghost who has exhausted your foundation after five reincarnations, whose aptitude and comprehension have long since rotted into the mud, forcibly grafted and poured in power with evil arts to force growth, all just to wait for the final moment to seize his body.

To change into a fresh, young vessel to prolong your pathetic life.

Tsk, tsk, I see. Qi Hanfeng merely offended me once, and you, a late-stage Foundation Establishment true person, a guardian steward of the Scripture Pavilion, came rushing over in such a panic, breaking the rules to come to my door to demand justice.

So you're just a desperate, mad dog whose path to body-snatching has been cut off, running out to bite people in a frenzy!"

These words were laid bare by both the Blood Elder Demon and Xu Yunfan. Qi Hanfeng was indeed the second body the Blood Elder Demon had refined using blood sacrifice methods. Now that Xu Yunfan had destroyed it, the Blood Elder Demon naturally had to settle the score.

Xu Yunfan paused slightly, his voice suddenly turning cold, each word piercing the heart.

"It's a pity, but this last life of yours is probably about to end as well. If you dive into the sea of suffering through reincarnation again, I'm afraid you'll never be able to awaken your past wisdom again.

Old demon, with your meager skills and twisted thoughts, who do you think you can fool? Jumping out now is just being a pawn for someone else. You want to use my hand to completely snuff out your own pathetic delusions, don't you?"

For Qi Hanfeng to suddenly jump out like this, if there wasn't someone pulling the strings behind the scenes, Xu Yunfan would never believe it.

However.

It was indeed a stumbling block placed in his path.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, looking at the Blood Elder Demon before him.

This old fellow, his lifespan was almost at its end, and he had already gone through five reincarnations. His own Five Turbidities were almost exhausted, and even his mind was clouded.

He was indeed a good knife for killing.

"You dare to humiliate me like this!!"

The Blood Elder Demon, as if his deepest secret had been pierced, the baby-like plump half of his face turned blood-red, while the zombie-like withered half became even more deathly gray.

Xu Yunfan's words were like the most vicious dagger, precisely stabbing into the hidden wound deep within his heart.
