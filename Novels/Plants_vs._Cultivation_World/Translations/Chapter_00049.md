# Chapter 49: Everyone's Cultivation Progress

Leaving the cottage, Gu Mo gazed at the thriving Water Spirit Rice in the spirit field and nodded in satisfaction. However, Water Spirit Rice was an annual crop, and Gu Mo couldn't wait to harvest the entire field before his departure.  

He had anticipated this situation and made preparations. This time, he would take ten Sunflowers with him, leaving the Peashooters and Potato Mines behind to protect the spirit field.  

Of course, the koi in the paddy would also remain. This fish had eliminated many hidden aquatic spirit insects, contributing significantly to the excellent growth of the Water Spirit Rice.  

Gu Mo hadn't been stingy in rewarding the koi with Sun Essence for its efforts. Now, the number of golden scales on the koi's body was increasing. Gu Mo eagerly anticipated the day when all its scales would turn gold.  

After instructing the koi to guard the field, Gu Mo left and activated the illusion formation to its maximum effect, hanging an "Away" sign outside.  

If anyone dared to intrude under these circumstances, they would undoubtedly be an enemy. The Peashooters would attack without hesitation, and if the intruder still refused to retreat and charged toward the cottage, the Potato Mines would teach them a lesson.  

Unless they were a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, any early or mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator who dared trespass would never leave Gu Mo's spirit field alive.  

Taking out his paper crane, Gu Mo leisurely flew out of the valley. Although he had obtained a mid-grade flying sword from Yuan Niya and exchanged the corresponding sword-control technique using sect contribution points—which he had already mastered—he still chose to use the paper crane for now.  

A mid-grade magical weapon would draw too much attention, and since he wasn't in a hurry, caution was the better choice.  

"Senior Brother Gu Mo!"  

As he passed over a spirit field, a voice called out to him. Gu Mo glanced down and recognized one of the new outer disciples he had recruited from the outer disciple quarters. The fact that the disciple was now tending to a field meant he had passed the assessment.  

Gu Mo descended and inspected the field. It was larger than his own but only a low-grade first-tier spirit field. The Jade Spirit Rice growing there didn't look particularly healthy.  

"Which farming technique did you learn?" Gu Mo asked.  

"Minor Gengjin Sword Qi!" the disciple replied promptly. He had heard that Senior Brother Gu Mo was an expert who had mastered two farming techniques.  

"The spiritual energy in your field is uneven, causing inconsistent growth in the rice. You should have started with Minor Cloud Rain Art. For the first planting, pest infestations are rare," Gu Mo advised. Since he had recruited this disciple, a small bond existed between them, and offering guidance now might prove useful in the future.  

"W-what should I do?" The disciple looked lost, clearly overwhelmed by the problem.  

"I'll cast Minor Cloud Rain Art once to adjust the field. Afterward, water it carefully with spirit spring water—that should help." With a wave of his hand, Gu Mo summoned a dark cloud, and a drizzle of spirit rain fell.  

Having mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Art, Gu Mo could cast it effortlessly. Though he deliberately limited it to the beginner level, it was more than enough.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Gu Mo!" The disciple was overjoyed. In the ruthless world of cultivation, where competition was constant, kindness like this was rare.  

After this brief detour, Gu Mo arrived at the market outside the sect. Since he had no spirit rice to sell this time, he skipped Gou Youyu's wine shop and headed straight to the meeting point.  

Wu Jinfei, Hu Hai, and Chu Feifei were already there. After a year apart, Gu Mo noticed significant changes in their demeanors. Unlike the exhaustion they had shown before, they now seemed much more at ease—evidently, two years of experience had made their sect duties manageable.  

The most striking change, however, was Chu Feifei. At the fourth level of Qi Refinement, Gu Mo could immediately tell she had reached the second level.  

Reaching the second level in two years wasn't as fast as a mid-grade spiritual root cultivator, but it matched the progress of lower-grade spiritual roots—equivalent to that of inner disciples.  

And this was without her special constitution being fully awakened. Otherwise, her progress would have been even faster.  

Chu Feifei had concealed her strength well. Wu Jinfei and Hu Hai clearly didn't know about her breakthrough—only Gu Mo, with his higher cultivation, could see through it.  

She likely didn't want to expose her special constitution, as a "low-grade" spiritual root reaching the second level in two years would raise eyebrows.  

While Gu Mo observed them, the trio also scrutinized him. Wu Jinfei and Hu Hai quickly averted their eyes, seeing no obvious changes in him from the previous year.  

With their cultivation levels, they couldn't penetrate the concealment of his mastered Breath-Concealing Art. Even without it, Gu Mo's fourth-level Qi Refinement would still be beyond their perception.  

Only Chu Feifei looked puzzled. Knowing some of Gu Mo's secrets, she found it hard to believe he hadn't made any progress in a year.  

"Sorry I'm late."  

Shortly after Gu Mo arrived, Yao Shifeng hurried over. His presence immediately revealed a spiritual aura surpassing the first level of Qi Refinement.  

"Brother Yao, you broke through!" Wu Jinfei exclaimed in astonishment.  

"Just luck," Yao Shifeng replied with a faint smile.  

He had actually arrived earlier but waited until everyone was present before revealing himself. The shocked expressions of Wu Jinfei and Hu Hai pleased him, and though Chu Feifei and Gu Mo seemed less impressed, their surprise was still evident.  

Gu Mo was indeed surprised. Chu Feifei's breakthrough was due to her special constitution, but Yao Shifeng must have encountered some fortuitous opportunity to reach the second level so quickly.  

It couldn't have been just the 100 spirit stones they had pooled together earlier—those might have aided his cultivation, but not to this extent.
