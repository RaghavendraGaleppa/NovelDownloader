# Chapter 240: Nine Transmutations and Nine Transformations, About to Ascend to a Higher Realm

The "Flower" and "Water" dual excellence of the Yunnan Dao Huashui Prefecture is world-renowned. A thousand shades of purple and red flower scenes emerge one after another, and winding waterways nourish all living things.

Traveling along the road for about ten miles, the scenery on the mountainside became apparent. Looking out, the sides of the winding waterways were filled with flowers. It was March, and heroes of the Jianghu, officials of the court, and literary men of fortune... were rushing to Huashui Prefecture to witness this rare grand spectacle.

There was a "Flower Appreciation Pavilion" on the mountain, with four stone benches inside. Outside the pavilion stood a stone tablet, inscribed with: Established by the Liu Clan of Weijiang, Huashui Prefecture.

Although the situation was turbulent at the time, the aristocratic families managed their businesses and controlled the surrounding resources, making them extremely wealthy. This place was a superb spot for appreciating flowers and scenery. The aristocratic families set up pavilions and erected tablets for travelers and Jianghu guests to rest and enjoy the view.

If one possessed martial strength and desired wealth and honor, upon seeing the inscription and feeling the urge to submit, they would go to the clan to discuss matters. Naturally, they would become retainers. Thus, the charity of the "Stone Pavilion" was not for the benefit of the common people, but rather aimed at "recruiting" experts to enhance their prestige.

A gentle breeze blew through the stone pavilion. The fragrance of flowers drifted about, entwining around the nose and fingers. In the light, ethereal scent, it made people feel tranquil and carefree.

Having traveled for a long time, their clothes were stained with sweat, so they took this opportunity to rest. The two sat in the pavilion, drinking water and eating dry rations. Li Xian looked out beyond the mountains, his vision broad, and sighed with emotion, "Wild flowers are already so beautiful. What would it be like if they were rare and precious exotic flowers?"

Wen Caishang smiled lightly and began to speak of "Appreciating Flowers." How to appreciate flowers, how to observe them, the symbolism of flower names, what is superior, what is inferior... Her vast knowledge was admirable. In the conversation, she mentioned a few formidable figures in Huashui Prefecture who had a hobby of raising flowers. However, she had only heard of them and had no prior contact, so she passed over it with a single sentence.

After eating and drinking their fill, their energy was replenished. Just as they were about to set off, Li Xian placed his personal items flat on the stone table in the pavilion. He thought to himself:

"My personal equipment includes a sword and bow, clothes, a water bag, dry rations, poison powder, and darts. It's too bulky and troublesome. Traveling like this is too conspicuous, making it hard for people to forget me. With a little inquiry, they could find out where I'm going. I need to find a way to simplify things a bit."

The narrow saber was forged from fine steel, tough and sharp, with a single edge. Although its quality was excellent, it could be replaced by the "Sinking River Sword." Thus, he discarded it. Li Xian carefully selected and refined his gear, discarding excess water bags and items... anything that could be left behind. If it couldn't be discarded, he found a way to hide it, keeping his body light.

Afterward, Li Xian joked with a smile, "Alas, the heaviest thing is the one I can't bear to part with."

After tidying up, it was high noon. They waited a moment longer until dark clouds covered the sun, making the climate cooler, and then continued forward. They walked several more miles, their steps steady and leaving no trace, but Li Xian couldn't help feeling hesitant in his heart.

What Wen Caishang said made a great deal of sense. Although they had temporarily escaped their pursuers, they couldn't rest easy just yet.

He unfolded the map. Huashui Prefecture was located in the southeast, with "Chongling Prefecture" to the south and "Xialong Prefecture" to the north. Xialong Prefecture faced "Longxiong Dao" from afar, close to each other.

Li Xian roughly understood the directions of the prefectures and prefectures. Having no good plan for the moment, he decided to proceed while observing.

He re-planned his route, heading north to try and keep his movements unpredictable. The journey was arduous. After walking for about three days, crossing mountains and passing through small counties, the wind and waves were calm.

He performed massage therapy every day. Wen Caishang's wrist could move, and her forearm could be slightly lifted. That night, the two were sleeping in the wilderness. Li Xian pondered deeply and said:

"After we broke out of the encirclement, we changed direction and headed north. They were caught off guard, and because they suffered heavy losses in the flower sea, they haven't recovered their vitality. Their information channels must be unclear."

"However... carrying you on my back is inevitably eye-catching. If this continues, our tracks will definitely be exposed. Moreover... our goal is to return to the One Union Manor. We need to borrow the treasures hidden in the manor to heal our injuries, so we won't fear enemy hands. Fleeing blindly northward will only take us further and further away."

Wen Caishang nodded and said, "That makes a lot of sense. What do you want to do?"

Li Xian said, "We've been fleeing for several days. The world is vast; it's not easy for them to find us. Madam... if I continue the massage, how long until you can walk?"

Wen Caishang said solemnly, "I underestimated the Marrow Piercing Finger earlier! The finger energy is entangled and very stubborn. Relying solely on external massage, it will still take more than ten days. Alas, there is still the lingering sound of the Brahma Chant in my body."

The two sat leaning against each other, a gentle breeze blowing, the fragrance of hair tickling the nose.

Li Xian untied the water bag and took a sip. Then he fed some to Wen Caishang, who had already grown accustomed to it. Li Xian thought for a moment and said, "Su Qiuwu suffered a setback and will definitely seek help. During this period, we should remain still rather than move. If we move, we will leave clues and risk being tracked."

"Furthermore, I haven't planned our future route yet. For now... I want to find a place to hide. During that time, I can slowly map out our route and plan our journey. Once you can walk, whether we enter a city or travel through the mountains, we won't be so conspicuous."

Wen Caishang also felt this was reasonable and said softly, "Alright, I'll leave it all to you." Suddenly remembering their old agreement, she cast a seductive glance and said coquettishly, "You little brat... are you still thinking about making me serve you? Once I can walk, you'll take revenge on me? Make me call you 'Great King,' make me submit and serve you."

Li Xian laughed and said, "Naturally."

"You bad boy," Wen Caishang娇声骂道 (said coquettishly). "If I don't serve you well, are you going to hit me and scold me?"

Li Xian deliberately said, "Not just that. I'll bite you, pinch you, and scratch you."

Huashui Prefecture was covered in wild flowers, with river veins scattered throughout. Li Xian and Wen Caishang were in "Zhou Shui County," which had many villages beneath it.

Great hermits hide in the bustling markets.

Li Xian came to "Peace Village," a village of mixed surnames, with four surnames: Wang, Li, Li, and Liu. Li Xian found a "man of the Li surname," bribed him with money, and claimed to be a distant relative who had moved here.

He spent money to smooth things over and buy favor. In this way, Li Xian rented an abandoned house in "Peace Village." It was the size of a "palm," very low and short. Inside, weeds grew profusely, venomous snakes nested, and rats piled up.

It was said that the original owners of the house had contracted a plague three years ago, and the entire family, old and young, had died of illness, leaving it abandoned. Li Xian looked around and saw a large tree.

He tapped his feet on the ground and leaped into the air. He wrapped his arms around Wen Caishang and gently placed her on a tree branch. Wen Caishang's white dress fluttered as she sat on the high branch.

After Li Xian landed, he rolled up his sleeves and got to work. Wen Caishang sat elegantly high up, although she was restricted by the finger energy and found it difficult to move.

Li Xian cleared out the snake nest and stabbed the rat nest. He pulled up the weeds and swept away the dust. With martial arts backing him and abundant strength, he did it all very easily. The desolate house gradually took on a human touch.

Smoke rose from the chimney, the black smoke hanging in the air to inform others that this house now had an owner. The ash from the burned firewood could absorb moisture, prevent odor, and kill mold. He sprinkled it evenly in the small courtyard and smeared it on the walls.

Except for the leaking roof, everything was taken care of.

Though the sparrow is small, it has all its vital organs. The yellow mud and thatch house was simple and crude, but for a temporary stay, it was not uncomfortable.

There was a river right in front of the door, surrounded by flowers, with shimmering waves. Li Xian came to the old tree in front of the door and lightly kicked the trunk. Wen Caishang fell into his arms.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Princes, marquises, generals, aristocratic families, landlords, and wealthy merchants... all hide their beauties in golden houses. Alas, I, Li Xian, have been poor since childhood. There's no golden house for me. But fortunately, I can still hide a beauty in an earthen house. Madam, is it beneath you?"

"Sharp-tongued," Wen Caishang said.

He hid Wen Caishang in the bedroom. Li Daqin's family arrived in an ox cart and said, "Brother Li, I've brought your things!"

Li Xian had moved into "Peace Village," pretending to be a distant relative of Li Daqin, and gave him enough silver. He asked him to help get "pots, pans, bowls, and basins," "bedding and cloth clothes," and other daily necessities.

Li Xian stayed for a short while, a few days or ten-odd days. Many things were not practical. But to cover his tracks and reduce the suspicion of others, he needed to put on the appearance of a long-term stay.

Li Daqin said, "Oh, Brother Li, you're quite handy. In such a short time, you've tidied it up so cleanly. Where's your wife?"

Li Xian laughed and said, "Heh, that lazy woman is sleeping in the house. Thanks for your help, Brother Li. Otherwise, with the two of us just arriving here and having no place to stay, I really wouldn't know what to do."

Li Daqin said, "We're relatives, why say that? Come, move these things into the house. But ah... there's something I need to tell you. You have no name, no land, no fields. You won't last long. You either go to the county office to smooth things over and reclaim a piece of farmland to make a living. Or you go to a big family and become a tenant farmer. Or if you have a skill, you can help people tend to flowers and plants."

Li Xian nodded in agreement. He took the pots, pans, bowls, basins, bedding, and cloth clothes into the house and watched Li Daqin leave.

The earthen house and small courtyard, with flowers and clear water... it was quite stable. Li Xian undressed and jumped into the water to play. He washed away his fatigue and caught a few big fish along the way.

He cooked them in a pot, and the aroma filled the air.

He lit a candle lamp and drank fish soup to fill his stomach. Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Although this place is extremely simple, it is finally stable. It's completely different from sleeping in the open and eating in the wind."

Li Xian said, "A few taels of silver in the prefecture city isn't enough for one meal. But in this village, one tael of silver is enough to settle down. There is a place to live, clothes to wear, and food to eat."

"That's true," Wen Caishang said thoughtfully. "My ambition was too high in the past, wanting to reach the pinnacle. Therefore, my eyes were always on the towering mountains and the solitary branch that outshone all others. However... the common people at the foot of the mountain and the green leaves and weeds beside the branch are also a stroke in the scroll of heaven and earth."

It is natural to climb high and see far.

There is also a unique charm in watching frogs from a well.

Wen Caishang's eyes held a strange light as she gazed at Li Xian, her thoughts churning: "If not for this experience, I would never have had this realization. I was raised by my entire clan from a young age, and I had already entered the Third Realm before I came of age. Li Xian is the exact opposite of me. Therefore... he has things that I do not. I found it hard to see before, but now I see it. I need to observe him more."

Li Xian practiced martial arts in the courtyard. Following the Starry Sky Spectrum, his figure flickered and flashed, extremely light. Wen Caishang, her mind opened, originally wanted to teach Li Xian martial arts. But she feared Li Xian would be distracted by this and neglect their escape.

[Seven Star Step]
[Proficiency: 1096/1200 Proficient]

Li Xian drew upon his internal energy, transforming it into a condensed ball of energy. It was distributed among the Yellow Court, Tan Zhong, Wei Lu... and other acupoints. With each practice, it grew stronger.

When he practiced to his heart's content, he leaped up onto the roof. Then, with a horizontal leap, he钻入 (entered) the tree canopy. He had never felt so light, wanting to roam the heavens and the earth.

That night.

Li Xian had practiced the [Seven Star Step] to minor success. He comprehended the "Star Gazing" trait. When observing the stars, it was as if he were in a dormant state, slowly recovering his stamina.

With ample time, he practiced the "Vast Sky Leg" again. A spark of inspiration struck, and the more he practiced, the smoother it became. Naturally, he reached the pinnacle of mastery.

[Vast Sky Leg]
[Proficiency: 13/60000 Pinnacle of Mastery]
[Description: You have tempered yourself a thousand times, bringing your leg technique to the pinnacle. Your footwork has increased dramatically. When walking, it is like a thin mist brushing over a lake, appearing and disappearing, seeming both real and illusory. You have悟得 (comprehended) the "Mist Step" trait.]

This trait allows him to travel with less effort, floating and ethereal, leaving no trace.

Li Xian's Qi Lake reached "Sixty-Six Zhang" in depth.
