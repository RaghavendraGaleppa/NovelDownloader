# Chapter 130

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing? Am I familiar with him?"

The man controlling the flying boat nearly lost control when he heard this question, his spiritual energy fluctuating wildly and almost causing them to tumble from the sky. 

What qualifications did he have to claim familiarity with Senior Brother Zhang Jing?

His gaze swept over the delicate face of his junior sister behind him as he chuckled wryly and explained, "Well, junior sister, how should I put this? I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you—I'm not nearly important enough to be acquainted with Senior Brother Zhang Jing. As for your talk of repaying him, I'd advise against disturbing him. If you focus on your cultivation in the Dao Academy, he'll naturally take notice."

Pei Xiaoshuang's face registered surprise at these words. 

Had she misjudged the situation? 

Moreover—if she hadn't misheard—this senior brother's words suggested Zhang Jing's status within the academy was far beyond what she'd imagined!

But he was so young—even younger than herself. 

Pei Xiaoshuang was certain she hadn't misjudged Zhang Jing's age. Estimating people's ages accurately was one of her survival skills honed in the world of rogue cultivators, and she was rarely mistaken.

She cautiously pressed further, "Senior brother, from what you're saying, is Senior Brother Zhang Jing exceptionally powerful? Of very high status?"

At this question, the man recalled the legendary feats of Zhang Jing suppressing all the senior brothers in the inner academy. 

With reverence in his voice, he replied, "Powerful? That's an understatement—he's downright monstrous! As for status, as an inner academy disciple and prospective chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion—who will undoubtedly become the undisputed chief of all inner academy disciples—his standing is beyond measure!"

"Inner academy?" Pei Xiaoshuang asked, puzzled.

"Those are the senior brothers at the Foundation Establishment realm. They're inner academy disciples, while we're outer academy disciples."

Pei Xiaoshuang's eyes glazed over in shock.

Time flowed quietly onward.

Nine months passed in the blink of an eye.

During this period, the Dragon Lake Dao Academy welcomed another batch of new disciples. However, this cohort couldn't compare to Zhang Jing's generation. 

The absence of A-grade prodigies was expected, but even the number of B-grade talents had sharply declined. This led many senior disciples to reminisce about the exceptional quality of the previous year's intake, followed by sighs of nostalgia.

Of course, in their hearts, even if this new batch had produced numerous A-grade prodigies, they would still pale in comparison to the previous year's cohort—for one simple reason: the existence of that monster.

Yet after nine months...

Legends about Zhang Jing still burned brightly. The cave dwelling he'd used with the Luodu team had become something of a holy site, particularly the cultivation chamber. Countless outer academy disciples made pilgrimages there, hoping to discover traces of Zhang Jing's practice that might grant them enlightenment.

None dared aspire to become a second Zhang Jing, but reaching A-grade standards should be easily achievable, they believed. Consequently, despite the Luodu team repeatedly raising access requirements, they couldn't stem the tide of eager outer academy disciples.

Around the perimeter of the immortal island where Zhang Jing cultivated...

Several pavilion masters of Dragon Lake Dao Academy stood suspended in midair, with the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master at the forefront. His gaze toward the immortal island held deep curiosity.

Before his eyes, radiant auroras rose from the island, tinged with faint purple hues that formed an impenetrable veil over the entire landmass. Simultaneously, an indescribably wondrous fragrance permeated dozens of miles—a single whiff brought mental clarity and spontaneous comprehension of the Dao.

Not far away, numerous inner academy disciples sat cross-legged around the island, immersed in cultivation. Periodically, someone's face would light up with irrepressible joy, clearly having achieved some enlightenment.

"The commotion from this little fellow's Dao Foundation establishment is unusually intense," the Spiritual Dao Pavilion Master mused aloud, perplexed. "And the timing seems off. Judging by these signs, Zhang Jing's Dao Foundation should be nearing completion. But it's only been nine months! Can Golden Nature Dao Foundation establishment proceed this quickly?"

The Inheritance Pavilion Master added, "This doesn't match any recorded phenomena of Golden Nature Dao Foundation establishment in our academy's archives."

The other pavilion masters shook their heads in unison. No matter how they racked their brains, they couldn't comprehend why Zhang Jing's Foundation Establishment manifested such extraordinary signs.

After a prolonged silence, the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master suddenly voiced an astonishing thought, his voice hoarse: "Everyone, is it possible that—"

"No need for speculation," the Academy Head's voice interrupted. "That little fellow Zhang Jing isn't establishing any ordinary Golden Nature Dao Foundation—he's forging a Purple Immortal Foundation! The process of establishing an Immortal Foundation naturally transcends conventional understanding."

The Academy Head materialized before them, his gaze falling upon the immortal island below with a trace of doting affection.

Zhang Jing had deceived them all. Had the upper realm not sent notification a month ago that a True Immortal would soon descend to Dragon Lake Dao Academy to escort Zhang Jing for cultivation in the upper realm, he would still be as clueless as the other pavilion masters.

A complex expression flashed through the Academy Head's eyes. "A Purple Immortal Foundation! To think the first recorded Purple Immortal Foundation in Dragon Lake Dao Academy's history would emerge during my tenure!"

Calculating the time, the True Immortal from the upper realm would arrive in just over three months—ample time for Zhang Jing to complete his Immortal Foundation establishment.

"After this little fellow emerges from seclusion, have him challenge the True Spirit Ranking," the Academy Head mused. "Though his cultivation is only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, this is an existence who condensed an Immortal Foundation—each one is extraordinarily formidable, never to be measured by ordinary standards. Perhaps this time, our Dragon Lake Dao Academy will make an appearance in the True Spirit Ranking's top hundred."

Excitement bubbled within him.

Meanwhile, the other pavilion masters finally emerged from their stunned silence, turning to the Academy Head with disbelief in their eyes.

"Senior brother, is it truly... truly an Immortal Foundation?" the Surveillance Pavilion Master asked, voice trembling.

If this were true, it would be the first Immortal Foundation born in their academy's history—a momentous occasion! More importantly, the upper realm would bestow magnificent rewards.

"Hehe, that's my Thousand Techniques Pavilion's inner academy disciple," the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master muttered gleefully to himself.

"Indeed! The upper realm has already notified me—a True Immortal will soon descend to escort this little fellow back to the upper realm," the Academy Head confirmed solemnly. "Keep this information confidential."

"Understood, senior brother," the pavilion masters chorused.

Silence reclaimed the area as the Academy Head and pavilion masters focused their attention on Zhang Jing's immortal island, faces alight with anticipation.

A Purple Immortal Foundation! Even they were witnessing such a phenomenon for the first time in their lives.

Three days later...

"It's about to succeed!" the Academy Head exclaimed, his expression electrified with excitement.
