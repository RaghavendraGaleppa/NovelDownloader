# Chapter 557: Running Into Me Is Your Bad Luck

The cycle of five lifetimes was nearing its limit, and this body was like a decaying prison. Possessing Qi Hanfeng was his only slim hope for survival.

But not only had Xu Yunfan seen through his sinister intentions toward his disciple, he had also mercilessly mocked the skeletal frame and aptitude that had long been hollowed out by time and evil arts, leaving them with almost no possibility of further progress.

Finally, he pointed out that this trip might also have fallen into the calculations of some schemer, turning him into someone else's pawn.

How could Blood Elder Devil not know this? But he had no choice but to proceed. Perhaps this was his chance to turn the tables.

Grief, anger, and venom finally turned into extreme mania, mixed with the despair of having his secret thoughts exposed, completely igniting Blood Elder Devil's sanity.

A late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator had been blinded by rage and lost his reason.

If there wasn't someone pulling the strings from behind, Xu Yunfan would gladly offer his head to be kicked like a ball.

In Blood Elder Devil's bizarre eyes, only a crazed bloodlust remained in an instant, and his overwhelming killing intent was no longer concealed.

Xu Yunfan grew extremely cautious in his heart.

Regardless, the Blood Sea method the other party cultivated was extraordinary.

This man could almost be called the 'street sweeper' of the Primordial Sect; wherever his Blood Sea passed, the ground would be scoured three feet deep.

"Yet a mere mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, relying on a few true scriptures, doesn't know the immensity of heaven and earth. When this Lord established his Dao, your ancestors were still running around in open-crotch pants. Die!"

**Blood Sea Erodes the Heavens!**

With this roar filled with endless venom and madness, Blood Elder Devil's hands slammed downward.

The sound of ghosts wailing echoed between heaven and earth.

*BOOM!*

An endless, sticky, foul, and pungent scarlet Blood Sea suddenly surged forth, centered on him.

This Blood Sea was not an illusion; it was a terrifying manifestation凝聚ed from Blood Elder Devil's late-stage Foundation Establishment Dao Foundation. Even the nascent proto-kingdom he had condensed was a pool of filthy blood sea.

**The Foundation of the Filthy Sea Sinking into Turbid Evil.**

What is the Foundation of the Filthy Sea Sinking into Turbid Evil? It is the turbid energy of the Taihua Void Realm that sinks downward, the most defiled fruit among the 108 Heavenly Gangs and Earthly Fiends. It is the fruit least afraid of killing karma and least afraid of damage to one's Yin Virtue.

Blood waves soared to the sky, and amidst the churning foam, countless struggling ghostly shadows reached out with枯骨-like claws. The foul, sticky blood water was mixed with terrifying turbid evil Yin poisons that could erode spirituality, defile magical treasures, and dissolve foundations.

The entire sky seemed to be devoured by this dark, filthy Blood Sea, turning into a turbid, foul, and nauseating blood-red purgatory.

This Blood Sea carried the will to devour all living beings, and it fiercely overturned towards the location of Xu Yunfan on the Divine Thunder Peak.

Wherever it passed, even space seemed to be stained with a layer of foul black-red stagnation. Spiritual energy was frantically corroded, emitting a terrifying sizzling sound.

Once caught in this filthy sea, not to mention flesh and blood dissolving, even one's soul and Dao Foundation would likely be contaminated and disintegrated by the endless turbid evil怨气, turning into pus, blood, and残渣, becoming a part of the Blood Sea.

Even with the isolation of the protective array, the disciples on the Divine Thunder Peak, looking at this overwhelming filthy blood sea, all turned pale with horror, their hands and feet turning cold.

The power of a late-stage Foundation Establishment Dao Foundation manifestation was terrifying to this extent.

Bi Yuan and the others were ashen-faced. If Xu Yunfan hadn't activated a stronger peak protection array earlier, Blood Elder Devil would have crushed them to death several times over with just his pressure alone.

Faced with this filthy Blood Sea that could make an ordinary mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator's soul scatter and body shatter, Xu Yunfan's eyes held not a trace of fear, but instead burned with a glint of eager anticipation.

But what surprised him even more was that the other party's proto-kingdom seemed to be on the verge of collapse and had not been successfully condensed.

It was far inferior to his own.

This was completely Xu Yunfan's humblebrag.

According to the cultivation process, the best ideal state is to condense a proto-kingdom at mid-stage Foundation Establishment, and then lift the proto-kingdom to the Sea of Consciousness at late-stage Foundation Establishment, seeking a trace of先天不朽金性 to achieve the great perfection of Foundation Establishment.

But in reality, very few can achieve this.

Ninety-nine percent of Golden Core True Lords only begin to condense their proto-kingdom when they are at late-stage Foundation Establishment, with their spiritual power overflowing, their spiritual sense full, and after comprehending the heavens and earth to achieve a fusion.

"Excellent Dao Foundation. It's just right to test my divine edge!"

He let out a clear shout, and his spiritual power surged mightily. The Xuanqiong Thunder Origin accumulated within his body erupted with a bang.

Instead of retreating, he advanced. He took a step out of the core range of the main peak's array, and the aura around his body climbed to its peak.

His two fingers came together, forming a thunder seal, and the true word from his mouth sounded like rolling thunder from the nine heavens: "Majestic Divine Thunder, Nine Palaces Govern the Universe! Cleanse All Evils, Break!!"

**Divine Thunder Nine Palaces Xuanqiong Immortal Sutra.**

**Divine Thunder Purple Mansion Shattering Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method!**

*Scream!*

Accompanied by a violent thunderclap that seemed to come from the nine heavens and tear the firmament apart.

Within Xu Yunfan's Dantian Qi Sea, the Purple宸周天万化雷府 Dao Foundation, which凝聚ed his entire cultivation, suddenly appeared.

This Dao Foundation was no longer a shadow, but a true entity suspended three zhang above his head.

It was a deep purple great pill, condensed to the extreme, as if compressed from tens of millions of tons of thunder essence.

Its surface was not smooth, but covered with countless fine and complex patterns containing the origin talismans of thunder.

The talismans flowed, constantly being born and destroyed.

The moment this great pill appeared, the long sky trembled violently, emitting the might of thunder.

And at the core of the purple thunder pill, nine incredibly condensed, thick thunder chains of a noble purple-gold color appeared out of thin air.

They were not used to bind enemies, but in the most overbearing and original manner, coiling around the thunder will at the center that seemed capable of suppressing all heavens and evils.

The coiling state of these nine chains itself formed a talisman array containing supreme suppressing and destructive power.

**Nine Palaces Lock Demon Primordial Thunder Talisman Array.**

This array is the only thunder array in the Divine Thunder Nine Palaces Xuanqiong Immortal Sutra, and it is also a growable array that can be manifested within a Dao Foundation.

Now that it has been deployed, its divine power can naturally be felt.

It was not in vain that he had tirelessly studied arrays in addition to practicing the true scripture.

In this way, an array that would normally only be imprinted by a great perfection Foundation Establishment cultivator with a full spiritual sense was precisely carved into his Dao Foundation.

An infinite, pure, and mighty will of immortal thunder, which carried the intent to cleanse all heavens of evil and shatter all阴s, accompanied by the manifestation of the nine chains, erupted like a burst dam.

*BOOM!*

*CRACKLE!*

Centered on the Purple宸雷府 Dao Foundation above Xu Yunfan's head, a phantom of a thunder pool composed purely of brilliant purple divine thunder instantly expanded.

Within the thunder pool, electric fluid flowed. It was not just pure destruction, but also contained a mighty, Yang, dignified, and sovereign aura of divine punishment over all heavens.

Countless fine Shattering Heavenly Gang True Thunders jumped, collided, and were annihilated and reborn within it.

This Purple Mansion Shattering Heavenly Gang Thunder Domain was grand, upright, supreme Yang, and filled with the supreme breath of destruction and rebirth intertwined. It was the absolute bane of all filth, evil, and Yin evil demonic energy in the world.

Now, with Blood Elder Devil coming, he had truly run into his natural predator.

The purple thunder domain violently crashed into the overturning filthy Blood Sea.

*Sizzle!!*

An extremely harsh sound, like a hot烙铁 plunged into ice water, echoed through the clouds.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, but at the moment of contact, an energy annihilation more terrifying than an explosion erupted.
