# Chapter 120: Dangers Abound

Three days later, Chu Ning, with a changed appearance, appeared before a swamp.

Since witnessing the internal strife among fellow disciples that day, Chu Ning had become even more vigilant.

He not only changed his appearance but also allowed his aura to radiate at the Seventh Layer of Qi Refining. At least this way, others wouldn't instantly perceive him as easily exploitable, which should help avoid some trouble.

However, in these three days, Chu Ning hadn't encountered anyone else. It felt normal upon reflection; after all, the Spirit Realm was vast, and three people being teleported relatively close was already quite rare.

Along the way, Chu Ning did encounter a few Crimson Fire Spiders and other demonic beasts. However, dealing with these First-tier Mid-grade demonic beasts was effortless for Chu Ning.

Although he had a Puppet Bird to scout ahead and the Azure Light Pearl for illumination at night, Chu Ning still chose to meditate and rest during the evenings. He would then continue his journey during the day. Now, he had arrived at this swampy area.

Chu Ning had long since memorized the map. While this location was still very far from the core formation area, it was closer than the Blue Moon Cave he had been in before. Beyond this swamp, the paths from other directions would gradually converge, and there should be other disciples as well.

“Ying!”

As Chu Ning stopped, Ling Xiaobai, whom Chu Ning had released from his Spirit Beast Bag, let out a cry from inside his sleeve.

Ling Xiaobai could change size; this was a new ability it gained after upgrading to a First-tier High-grade demonic beast. Initially, Chu Ning hadn't noticed it until he entered the Spirit Realm. When Chu Ning felt Ling Xiaobai was too conspicuous, the little fellow shrank and burrowed into his sleeve. When Chu Ning questioned why it hadn't mentioned this ability earlier when he asked about its other talents, Ling Xiaobai replied plaintively that it wasn't a 'talent'. Chu Ning could only let it go.

At this moment, hearing Ling Xiaobai's cry, Chu Ning couldn't help but look to his front-left.

“A spiritual herb?”

Chu Ning naturally trusted Ling Xiaobai's senses. But located in the middle of the swamp, where flight was impossible, picking it would be quite inconvenient.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, “Ying!”

Ling Xiaobai had already shot out with a 'whoosh'. The little fellow couldn't fly, but its speed was largely unaffected. It ran across the swamp ground so quickly that it didn't sink. In the blink of an eye, Ling Xiaobai rushed to the middle of the swamp and bit off a lotus-shaped spiritual plant from among the many plants.

Then, it ran back towards Chu Ning. When Ling Xiaobai returned to Chu Ning, Chu Ning took the object it held in its mouth and examined it. He found it was a lotus pod-shaped item, but unlike ordinary lotus seeds, these were red. Even without peeling the pod, the red color shone through.

“Mist Fire Lotus.”

Chu Ning recognized the item's name. It was said to be an excellent spiritual herb for refining fire-attribute pills. Looking at its age, this Mist Fire Lotus should be worth a considerable amount of spirit stones.

“Without being able to fly, it’s very inconvenient to go into this swamp to pick spiritual herbs. Otherwise, a spiritual herb of this age and grade wouldn't still be here in such an outer area. It would have long since been picked by other senior disciples.” Chu Ning murmured softly, holding the Mist Fire Lotus, and asked Ling Xiaobai: “Xiaobai, do you want to eat it?”

“Ying!” Ling Xiaobai shook its head.

Chu Ning chuckled wryly: “I forgot, you're ice-attribute. Other attributes of spiritual herbs and fruits are fine, but this is fire-attribute.”

As he spoke, Chu Ning placed the Mist Fire Lotus into a jade box and stored it in his storage bag. Immediately, Chu Ning's gaze turned towards the swamp.

“Xiaobai's speed prevents it from sinking. If I use Startling Thunder Steps, I could also do it, but…”

Thinking this, Chu Ning still shook his head. There was no need to take such a risk. After all, he didn't know if there were other dangers beneath the swamp. Despite the map indicating the swamp covered several hundred *li*, Chu Ning decided to bypass it.

Taking out his directional needle to check the way, Chu Ning turned and walked east along the edge of the swamp. He didn't use Startling Thunder Steps, just ordinary wind-riding art, walking close to the ground. The speed was slightly slower, but it was more relaxed and comfortable.

After walking for about two hundred *li*, Chu Ning vaguely saw the end of the swamp. If Chu Ning had used his usual evasion technique or wind-riding flight, two hundred *li* would take at most an hour. However, because Chu Ning wasn't rushing, it took him almost an hour and a half.

At this moment, the Puppet Bird was still flying ahead. Just as he was about to reach the end of the swamp, Chu Ning suddenly stopped. Because the Puppet Bird had failed to detect the bushy-browed disciple hiding behind the boulder in time before, Chu Ning now controlled it to fly a wider range. While flying forward, it also scouted sideways.

Through the Dharma Mirror, Chu Ning saw something to his front-right. A swarm of flying ants was on a large tree, devouring a demonic beast of unknown species. At that moment, the last bit of flesh on the demonic beast's body had been completely gnawed away, leaving only a skeletal frame. Chu Ning couldn't identify what kind of demonic beast it was. However, Chu Ning recognized this swarm of flying ants.

Azure Sky Ants, one of the most troublesome demonic beasts in the Spirit Realm. These ants were fingertip-sized, entirely green, and when they formed a swarm, they could blanket the entire sky in a greenish hue. Hence their name, Azure Sky Ants. A single Azure Sky Ant was weaker than an ordinary First-tier Low-grade demonic beast, but a swarm of thousands could give even Foundation Establishment cultivators a huge headache. Let alone ordinary Qi Refining cultivators.

Chu Ning immediately controlled the Puppet Bird to fly away, avoiding being discovered by the swarm. At the same time, he quickly moved forward himself. But what made his face change drastically was that, at the same time, a few Azure Sky Ants that had flown away from the cleanly devoured demonic beast corpse seemed to have detected the Puppet Bird's presence. They flew over quickly, and then the rest of the Azure Sky Ants swarmed in as if they had received a command.

Seeing this, Chu Ning quickly controlled the Puppet Bird to fly forward, hoping to attract the swarm's attention and prevent the Azure Sky Ants from discovering him. But the next moment, he found that he had lost control of the Puppet Bird. The Puppet Bird was flying straight towards the Dharma Mirror in his hand.

“No spiritual power left?”

Seeing this, Chu Ning instantly understood that the spiritual power he had infused into the Puppet Bird earlier had been depleted. This was a feature of the artifact: when spiritual power was insufficient, it would automatically fly back to the Dharma Mirror. Earlier, he had praised the artificer's ingenious design. Now, Chu Ning couldn't help but curse this bizarre setting.

“Run!”

Looking at the overwhelming swarm of Azure Sky Ants flying towards him, Chu Ning used Startling Thunder Steps almost the instant the Puppet Bird flew back to him. And it was the fastest version of Startling Thunder Steps, combined with spiritual power. With a flash, he appeared several *zhang* (Chinese feet) away. At this moment, Chu Ning couldn't care about the consumption of spiritual power; he ran wildly at top speed. At the same time, he released his divine sense, sensing behind him.

What made Chu Ning's scalp tingle was that while his Startling Thunder Steps were indeed fast enough, the speed of this swarm of Azure Sky Ants was also not slow.

Although they couldn't directly catch up to him, they always remained close behind. Moreover, this swarm of Azure Sky Ants had flown low, just a short distance behind his head, which was extremely chilling.

“Isn't flying prohibited in the Spirit Realm? Why isn't it restricted for demonic beasts?” Chu Ning couldn't help but curse inwardly at this moment.

He couldn't even cast a minor spell right now, for fear that any slight delay would allow the Azure Sky Ants to catch up. The thought of the demonic beast that had just been gnawed clean sent shivers down Chu Ning's spine.

“Ying!”

At this moment, Ling Xiaobai, who had moved to Chu Ning's shoulder, suddenly let out a cry. The next moment, Chu Ning saw a white light spray from the little fellow's mouth. Unlike the previous white light that condensed into an ice pillar, this time Ling Xiaobai sprayed a white mist about a *zhang* in size.

At this time, the Azure Sky Ants were in hot pursuit. They didn't pause at all when encountering the white mist, but plunged headfirst into it.

“Sizzle! Sizzle!”

Immediately, loud sizzling sounds erupted. What delighted Chu Ning was that all the Azure Sky Ants that crashed into the mist turned into tiny ice points and fell directly. This single attack caused hundreds of Azure Sky Ants to fall. The remaining Azure Sky Ants were also affected, splitting into several groups. Those on either side of the white mist continued to fly forward, but many in the middle were blocked and fell behind.

“Xiaobai, well done!” Chu Ning praised it repeatedly upon seeing this.

“Ying!” Ling Xiaobai, having received praise, let out a triumphant cry. Immediately after, it sprayed out another spell. Just like before, this time it targeted the swarm on the left. Instantly, another hundred or so Azure Sky Ants fell.

As Ling Xiaobai continuously sprayed out spells, piles of Azure Sky Ants fell. Seeing Ling Xiaobai display its power again, Chu Ning felt a slight relief, but he didn't dare to stop running. Because at this moment, the other Azure Sky Ants, seemingly fearless, continued their relentless pursuit.

“Ying!”

After casting twenty spells, Ling Xiaobai couldn't help but let out a cry. Chu Ning's heart sank upon hearing it. Ling Xiaobai was telling him that the little fellow's spiritual power was running low and it couldn't cast many more spells. Meanwhile, the Azure Sky Ants behind him, though reduced by about half, were still in hot pursuit.

At this point, Chu Ning finally ran out of the swamp area.

Not far in front of him, a lake appeared. Chu Ning was immediately overjoyed at the sight. Although Azure Sky Ants were troublesome, they were fire-attributed demonic beasts, naturally afraid of water and ice.

“Xiaobai, just a little longer!” Chu Ning called out softly, turning and sprinting towards the lake. With a few flashes, he had reached the lakeside. He wasn't sure if Ling Xiaobai could enter the water, so he simply called out to it and stored it directly into his Spirit Beast Bag.

The next moment, Chu Ning leaped down, plunging directly into the water.

“Buzz!”

The moment Chu Ning's body entered the water, the swarm of ants flew over the spot where Chu Ning had just stood.

Chu Ning, already in the water, had taken out the Azure Light Pearl from his storage bag the moment he entered. Upon contact with water, the Azure Light Pearl immediately emitted an invisible spiritual power shield, enveloping Chu Ning's entire body. At the same time, it completely isolated the outside water.

At this moment, Chu Ning looked up. He saw the swarm of ants circling above the lake, but they showed no intention of descending. Seeing this, Chu Ning finally breathed a huge sigh of relief.

After thinking for a moment, he released Ling Xiaobai again. The little fellow, perhaps due to excessive spiritual power consumption, appeared a bit listless. Chu Ning then took out Golden Essence Fruit, Golden Orchid Fruit, Iron Orchid Fruit, and other spiritual fruits from his storage bag. As expected, Ling Xiaobai directly chose the Golden Orchid Fruit. After the little fellow ate the Golden Orchid Fruit, Chu Ning stored it back into the Spirit Beast Bag, allowing it to slowly recover there.

At the same time, he also took a Spirit Replenishing Pill. His continuous use of Startling Thunder Steps, especially when combined with spiritual power, had consumed a considerable amount of his own spiritual power. Now was a good time to recover some spiritual power.

Immediately after, Chu Ning held the Azure Light Pearl and walked forward. At this moment, he naturally dared not go ashore easily. However, Chu Ning also dared not walk into the middle of the lake. He walked along the edge of the lake for several hundred *zhang* before stopping. Then, he carefully took out the Puppet Bird again, infused spiritual power into it, and slightly exposed it above the water surface before sending it out.

Although the swarm of ants was completely out of sight from the Puppet Bird's perspective, Chu Ning still controlled the Puppet Bird from underwater, making it fly to the maximum extent in the direction he had come from. Then, he controlled the Puppet Bird to fly around in the air for one or two circles, still seeing no sign of the Azure Sky Ant swarm, and only then did Chu Ning breathe a huge sigh of relief. It seemed the swarm must have flown far away.

Just as Chu Ning was about to recall the Puppet Bird and go ashore, the next moment, his expression suddenly changed. Holding the Azure Light Pearl, he rapidly used Startling Thunder Steps underwater, darting forward. The instant he moved, a dark shadow crashed towards the spot where Chu Ning had just been standing.

It was an eight-legged, alligator-shaped demonic beast that appeared at the bottom of the lake. Chu Ning, now close to the lakeside, used Startling Thunder Steps to quickly leap ashore in a few steps.

Although the Water Repelling Pearl had the effect of repelling water, it also had a significant drawback. When using this artifact, one could not use any other defensive shields besides one's own spiritual power defense barrier. This applied to both talismans and Chu Ning's Earth Spirit Bracelet. Chu Ning naturally wouldn't expose himself defenceless to a demonic beast's attack like that. Although he had some confidence in his body refining defense to block this First-tier Mid-grade demonic beast, Chu Ning wouldn't take such a risk.

And after Chu Ning went ashore, the eight-legged alligator, unrelenting, also pounced out. At the same time, the alligator slightly opened its mouth, and an arc of lightning shot out towards Chu Ning.

“Sizzle! Sizzle!”

The electric light struck a shield of light half a *zhang* in front of Chu Ning. This was the result of the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman in Chu Ning's palm, which transformed into a true talisman spell, having been activated instantly as he went ashore. Although it was only a First-tier High-grade talisman, the Eight-legged Electric Alligator's attack power wasn't very strong, and it was blocked in one go.

“Even a First-tier Mid-grade demonic beast is chasing me!” Chu Ning was furious at being chased by two types of demonic beasts consecutively.

With a casual wave, several Geng Metal Sword Talismans shot out. Against this type of demonic beast, the incomparably sharp Geng Metal Sword Art produced by the Geng Metal Sword Talismans was even more effective than the Crimson Flame Talismans. Indeed, after these several golden sword qi shot out, they directly pierced through the Eight-legged Electric Alligator.

Watching the First-tier Mid-grade demonic beast crash heavily into the water, Chu Ning's expression changed slightly the next moment, and he flashed away. Almost immediately after he left, a group of dark shadows appeared beside the Eight-legged Electric Alligator's corpse and began to devour their companion's body.

“Can't afford to provoke them, can't afford to provoke them!” Chu Ning, running far away, sighed inwardly. The demonic beasts in this Spirit Realm weren't high-grade, but there were simply too many of them. Aside from the isolated demonic beasts he'd encountered in the past few days, today he had consecutively encountered two types of demonic beasts that were in swarms.

With a few flashes, Chu Ning left the vicinity of the lake. After sensing briefly with his divine sense that the eight-legged electric alligators hadn't pursued him ashore, Chu Ning finally slowed his pace. At the same time, he prepared to command the Puppet Bird behind him to fly ahead. But just then, Chu Ning's footsteps abruptly halted.

Within the range of his divine sense, there was an open space ahead, and there were people there—not just one, but four individuals. And among them, there was a figure Chu Ning recognized: Lu Yunfang.

After Chu Ning killed Qi Chongmao and moved in to investigate, he had already determined that she was a member of the Yin Demon Sect.

“Sure enough, people from the Yin Demon Sect can still sneak in. I just don't know what methods they used to avoid detection even under the divine sense secret arts of Golden Core cultivators.” Chu Ning sighed inwardly. At this moment, there were three others with her, but Luo Hongping was nowhere to be seen. Chu Ning wasn't certain if the three individuals beside her were also from the Yin Demon Sect, like Lu Yunfang, or just ordinary Qingxi Sect disciples.

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Chu Ning was about to move to the side and bypass the group again. The next moment, his brows twitched slightly, and he stopped moving. Just in the direction he was about to bypass, a figure came flying with the wind-riding art, revealing another Qingxi Sect disciple. Of medium build, appearing to be in his late thirties to early forties, with a small mustache. His cultivation had actually reached the Ninth Layer of Qi Refining.

“Eh, why isn't this junior brother walking? I see there are other fellow disciples ahead.” The man with the mustache stopped beside Chu Ning and asked with a smile.

“I…” Chu Ning was about to find an excuse or simply use Startling Thunder Steps to force his departure. Just then, Chu Ning saw another person approaching from his rear-side, tall and thin, seemingly at the Eighth Layer of Qi Refining.

“I was just about to go over.” Chu Ning forced a smile and then stepped forward towards the group ahead. At the same time, his heart sank.

“These two, one in front and one behind, clearly arrived together. And their positions just now clearly indicated they were guarding against me. It seems highly likely they are going to rendezvous with Lu Yunfang and the others ahead.” As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Chu Ning secretly groaned. He felt that his luck was indeed not very good. The last time he entered this Spirit Realm, he encountered Duan Yanwu and several other disciples of the Yin Demon Sect gathered together. And looking at the situation now, it seemed to be the same.

Coupled with the recent conversation among the few individuals, it had already drawn the attention of the four people ahead. They had all stood up and were walking towards his direction. Chu Ning was now subtly surrounded by them, so he could only take things one step at a time.

The main thing was that Chu Ning was not sure if these individuals possessed the blood escape technique that Duan Yanwu had used before. If they really did, it seemed he wouldn't be able to easily shake off their entanglement. Perhaps he should see if any other disciples from the sect would arrive later, which would save him from fighting alone.

However, Chu Ning's heart was equally vigilant at this moment. As he walked forward, he also fully opened his divine sense. He had made up his mind that as long as any of them made a slight move, he certainly wouldn't sit idly by.

The three walked one after another and quickly met up with Lu Yunfang and the others ahead.
