**Chapter 14: Seventh Young Master Xu**  

"Ran Yue, what happened?" Qin Ziling stopped Yin Ran Yue as she rushed past.  

"Young Master!" Yin Ran Yue looked up and, recognizing Qin Ziling, immediately threw herself into his arms, tears streaming down her face.  

"Don't be afraid, Ran Yue. I’m here," Qin Ziling said gently, soothing her trembling shoulders with a comforting touch.  

"Gao Ang, who is this?" The pockmarked young nobleman snapped his folding fan shut, his expression darkening as he watched Yin Ran Yue cling to Qin Ziling.  

"Ah!" Hearing the nobleman’s voice, Yin Ran Yue shuddered and quickly retreated behind Qin Ziling.  

"Seventh Young Master Xu, this is Qin Ziling, a villager from our area. Yin Ran Yue is a maidservant adopted by his mother," Cao Gao Ang explained.  

"Hmm." The so-called Seventh Young Master Xu's expression softened slightly. He pointed his fan at Yin Ran Yue and addressed Qin Ziling, "Qin Ziling, is it? I’ve taken a liking to your maidservant. Name your price."  

At these words, Yin Ran Yue’s face turned even paler, her fingers clutching Qin Ziling’s sleeve as if afraid he might truly sell her.  

"Ran Yue is family, not a commodity," Qin Ziling replied sternly.  

Yin Ran Yue trembled violently at his words, tears spilling down her cheeks.  

"Qin Ziling, do you know who you’re speaking to? This is the Seventh Young Master of Xu Fortress. Need I explain what Xu Fortress represents? For him to take an interest in Yin Ran Yue is an honor for your family—and a blessing for her. If you dare to refuse, I’ll have your legs broken!" Cao Gao Ang sneered, brandishing his fan as if he himself were a scion of the Xu family.  

Seventh Young Master Xu flicked open his gilded fan with a flourish, fanning himself leisurely, clearly expecting Qin Ziling to submit at the mere mention of his name.  

The gathered villagers, who had initially looked indignant at Cao Gao Ang’s bullying, immediately paled upon hearing "Xu Fortress." Those who had been ready to intervene quickly retreated, their wives pulling them back in fear.  

Xu Fortress was a powerful local faction in Fangshuo County, owning vast swathes of land and numerous businesses across the region. Many of its members held positions in the county government, and its fortress outside the western city gates was heavily fortified, housing a private army of retainers. Even high-ranking officials in Fangshuo County treated the Xu family with deference, unwilling to provoke conflict.  

Cao Gao Ang’s daughter had married Xu Yuanwu, the young master of Xu Fortress, a prodigious martial artist renowned as one of the top six young talents in Fangshuo County. Though this Seventh Young Master Xu was not as formidable as Xu Yuanwu, he was still a member of the Xu family—someone commoners like them could never afford to offend.  

Realizing the nobleman’s identity, Qin Ziling’s heart sank, but he forced a deferential smile and clasped his hands in salute. "So it’s Seventh Young Master Xu. I was unaware of your esteemed status earlier and spoke out of turn. Please forgive my rudeness."  

"Hah! You’re a clever one after all. Xiao Nan, give him twenty taels of silver," Seventh Young Master Xu laughed, thoroughly pleased by Qin Ziling’s subservience.  

"Qin Ziling, you should be thanking Seventh Young Master Xu! These days, human life is cheap—even the prettiest maidservant from the slave market costs no more than ten taels. The Young Master is giving you twenty!" Cao Gao Ang crowed.  

"Thank you for your generosity, Young Master Xu. But Ran Yue has grown up in my household like family. I cannot bear to part with her. Please consider another maidservant," Qin Ziling said with another bow.  

"I’ve set my sights on Yin Ran Yue," Seventh Young Master Xu’s face darkened, his eyes glinting with menace.  

"Please, Young Master, show mercy!" Qin Ziling feigned desperation.  

"Hmph! You refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!" Ignoring Qin Ziling’s plea, Seventh Young Master Xu snapped his fan shut and slapped it against his palm. Two burly, fierce-looking retainers immediately stepped forward.  

"Stop!" At that moment, Cui Shi, Qin Ziling’s mother, rushed to the doorway. Though dressed plainly, her dignified bearing carried an air of nobility uncommon among village women. Her sharp command gave the retainers pause, and they glanced back at their master.  

Cao Gao Ang smirked and stepped forward. "Aunt Cui, perfect timing. You’re a sensible woman. This is Seventh Young Master Xu of Xu Fortress. He admires Yin Ran Yue’s intelligence and beauty and is willing to pay twenty taels for her. But your son is being stubborn. Why bring trouble upon yourselves?"  

Upon hearing the nobleman’s identity, Cui Shi’s hands trembled, and the ball of silk thread she was holding fell to the ground, rolling to Seventh Young Master Xu’s feet, where he crushed it underfoot.  

Cui Shi paid it no mind, her gaze shifting between Qin Ziling and Yin Ran Yue as she fought back tears.  

"Young Master Xu, I’ll go with you. Please don’t trouble my mistress and Young Master," Yin Ran Yue suddenly declared, her face pale but resolute.  

"Ran Yue!" Cui Shi burst into tears, overcome with grief.  

"Mistress, Young Master, if I cannot serve you in this life, I pray for the chance in the next." Yin Ran Yue knelt and kowtowed before them.  

Cui Shi hurried forward and embraced her, weeping uncontrollably.  

Watching this scene, Qin Ziling’s fury burned fiercely. He longed to summon his Bronze Corpse Ape and crush Seventh Young Master Xu into paste. But the more enraged he felt, the calmer his expression became as his mind raced for a solution.  

In peaceful times, he might have dared to stand his ground. But this was an era of chaos, where the law bowed to power. Xu Fortress was a behemoth, teeming with martial experts and private soldiers. Even the local government avoided conflict with them. If Qin Ziling openly resisted—or worse, summoned the Bronze Corpse—he might escape, but his mother and Yin Ran Yue would surely die.  

"Since Young Master Xu favors Ran Yue, it is her fortune. But as you can see, my mother shares a deep bond with her. This is all too sudden—they need time to part ways. Could Ran Yue stay with us for a few more days? It would allow them to cherish their remaining time together, and she could gather her belongings," Qin Ziling proposed carefully.  

Yin Ran Yue, though resigned to her fate, couldn’t help but feel a pang of sorrow at Qin Ziling’s words, her tears flowing harder.  

Seventh Young Master Xu frowned at her distress. Taking her now, while she was inconsolable, would hardly be enjoyable. "I won’t wait days. She has until tomorrow evening. I’ll send someone then."  

With a dismissive wave, he turned and strode away.  

In these lawless times, he had no fear of the Qin family fleeing overnight.  

As Seventh Young Master Xu and Cao Gao Ang swaggered off with their entourage, Qin Ziling’s expression finally darkened, his eyes glinting with cold, murderous intent.
