# Chapter 22: Second Order

The central square was already packed with a sea of people, filled with the clamor of gongs, drums, and firecrackers. 

A gathering of 100,000 cultivators celebrating the New Year was a rare sight anywhere else. Each cultivator brimmed with vitality, their blood energy surging from the constant consumption of demon beast flesh. Now gathered together, their collective energy soared into the heavens like a boiling tide!

All were eagerly anticipating the upcoming Meat Distribution Ceremony.

The Second-Order demon beast prepared by the Celestial District had already been brought forth. This beast was the result of a joint hunt organized by several major workshops in the Celestial District, along with a few Second-Order cultivators, a month prior. Weak workshops like Celestial District's Ninth Courtyard had no chance of participating.

Han Yue approached and saw the corpse of a Second-Order [Striped Tiger] lying on the ground, its pelt already half-skinned. The tiger measured fifty meters in length—not particularly large compared to many First-Order demon beasts. However, the aura of a Second-Order beast far surpassed that of its lesser counterparts. Even in death, the [Striped Tiger] exuded an oppressive might that made ordinary people tremble. 

Tiger-type demon beasts were inherently more formidable in combat than others of the same rank.

The meat distribution was a grand event for the entire city district, with butchers from every workshop present to assist. Though the Second-Order beast's hide was thick and tough, the combined efforts of the crowd made the process faster than usual. In no time, the Celestial District finished their portion, and the relevant personnel began to withdraw.

The Earth District had been waiting for this moment. As soon as the Celestial District cleared the area, the Earth District's people dragged forward the massive corpse of a serpent. The snake's body was far larger than the tiger's—its length alone was ten times that of the tiger. The Earth District paraded the serpent's corpse in a full circle around the central square before finally bringing it to the center for butchering. 

This was the Earth District's chance to flaunt their might!

The festive atmosphere reached new heights. With far more meat to distribute, the Earth District set up five tables at each of the four cardinal directions—twenty lines in total for people to queue up. Countless cultivators worked on the serpent's body, their blades flashing as they sliced off piece after piece of meat. In less than two hours, the great serpent had been carved into thousands of pieces, leaving behind only a massive skeleton. 

The Earth District dismantled the skeleton and carried it away, leaving only the serpent's head—as large as a house—to be carried back by several strongmen, step by step.

The Mystic District was no less impressive. They had hunted a pure white stallion, its coat flawless and radiant, noble beyond compare. In another world, it might have been called the "Jade Lion of the Night." 

Horses were truly beautiful creatures. Though this white stallion was a demon beast, it bore no trace of evil or terror. Instead, its shimmering coat exuded an air of nobility. But in the Meat Distribution Grounds, beauty always yielded to utility. No matter how striking the beast, it couldn't provide an extra ounce of primal energy. 

Instead, the sight of this magnificent creature being dismembered piece by piece carried a cruel beauty of its own, further electrifying the crowd.

Han Yue found himself immersed in the grandeur of this ritual. The Meat Distribution Grounds were, in truth, the frontlines of humanity's war against demon beasts. The people here spent their lives hunting these creatures, their nerves perpetually taut. This year-end ceremony served as a release for their pent-up emotions.

Soon, the white stallion was also reduced to portions, and the Mystic District's task was complete. Of the four districts—Celestial, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow—only the Yellow District remained. 

Unlike the swift transitions of the previous districts, however, the Yellow District made no move even after the Mystic District had withdrawn. Time was still plentiful, and the crowd waited patiently. Many took the opportunity to socialize and exchange information. But as the delay stretched on, murmurs of confusion arose.

Then, as time passed, a rumor began to spread through the crowd, growing louder until it became the center of discussion. Fragments of conversation reached Han Yue's ears:

"The Sword Workshop? Are you sure?"  
"Is it really the Sword Workshop leading the Yellow District's New Year this time?"  
"The news came from the Yellow District! The Sword Workshop is taking action this year—something interesting is about to happen!"

Just as Han Yue was about to ask someone what the "Sword Workshop" was, a streak of sword light, accompanied by thunder, split the sky and descended upon the square. The light circled above before plunging to the ground, revealing a young man clad in a green robe. 

The youth had sharp, sword-like eyebrows and piercing starry eyes, his expression stern and devoid of any smile—completely out of place amidst the festive atmosphere. Standing at the center of the square, he produced a Corpse Storage Bag and casually shook it, releasing the massive corpse of a black bear. 

The bear was enormous and robust, its fur gleaming silver. A quarter of its head had been cleanly sliced off, indicating it had been dead for some time.

The crowd erupted in noise at the youth's appearance, but he ignored them. With a flick of his hand, a white sword light surged forth and enveloped the bear's corpse. 

The light transformed into a net of blades as it reached the body, slicing through the bear's flesh as effortlessly as tofu. The sword light danced, filling the air with the sound of thunder as it minced the bear into countless pieces. Flesh, bones, and organs were all mixed together, divided into four mountains of meat piled at the square's four directions.

Then, in a flash, the green-robed youth vanished as swiftly as he had come. The entire spectacle had lasted mere minutes.

The crowd was left in awe, having witnessed a dazzling sword dance. The youth was undoubtedly a Second-Order cultivator—and a rare Second-Order sword cultivator at that. His display of power far exceeded Han Yue's expectations. 

This was the strength of a true inheritor of the Second Order. The sheer brilliance of his swordplay was an eye-opening experience. Today's celebration had been more than worthwhile—not only had Han Yue obtained a share of Second-Order demon beast meat, but he had also witnessed the might of a genuine Second-Order cultivator.

The grand ceremony reached its climax with this dazzling display of sword light. Once the crowd had collected their portions of bear meat, they gradually dispersed, their excited discussions still echoing across the square.

The people of Celestial District's Ninth Courtyard regrouped and began their journey home. Xiao Liu clutched his [Treasure Bag] tightly—inside were four portions of Second-Order demon beast meat. He was about to enter a long period of seclusion to digest this bounty. 

Whether he would soar as a dragon or crawl as a snake depended entirely on this trial!
