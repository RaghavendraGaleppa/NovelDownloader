After arriving at Yellow Maple Valley, Lin Yun had acquired so many items that many sections of his inventory had to be abbreviated with ellipses. However, few were truly noteworthy—most were merely items he planned to sell.

Stretching out his hand, a fiery red talisman appeared in Lin Yun's palm. Though just a simple piece of paper, the scorching heat radiating from it was unmistakable.

"Nie Ying truly has remarkable talent in fire-attribute techniques," Lin Yun mused. "Even at the Qi Refining stage, she could already wield intermediate fire spells. In the original story, when the Murong brothers clashed with Lu Yunfeng, she effortlessly countered his Azure Arc Slash with an intermediate-tier Firebird Technique."

Gazing at the intermediate-grade Fire Phoenix Talisman in his hand, Lin Yun recalled Nie Ying's limited appearances in the original plot—mostly before the protagonist Han Li returned from the Chaotic Star Sea after forming his Nascent Soul.

"As planned, I'll maintain some distance for now," Lin Yun decided, tucking the talisman away.

Reviewing his personal interface, he sighed in satisfaction. "Coming to Yellow Maple Valley was definitely the right move. The treasures I've obtained are invaluable—the Profound Yin Eyes capable of cultivating the Frightening Divine Gaze, the Vajra Art Spiritual Items and Pill Gift Pack, and that Kirin Origin."

"The Silver Essence Ganoderma—it's been extinct in the human realm for ages! Only the Spirit Realm still holds such rarities." Lin Yun summoned a silver ganoderma with a wave of his hand, admiring it briefly before storing it again.

"Thanks to those Qi Refining disciples spreading the word, my reputation is growing. With them doing the legwork, I can focus on setting up my stall regularly."

"It's been a while since I last improved my cultivation. Now, I can finally dedicate myself to disciplined training." Lin Yun examined his internal state.

"But what intrigues me most is this technique." He produced a jade slip—the Profound Heaven Five Elements Technique obtained from Xiang Zhili. The contents were extensive, and between preparing the Vajra Art materials and crafting talismans, Lin Yun hadn't had time to study it thoroughly until recently. 

Upon reviewing it, he was astounded by its profound power.

The Profound Heaven Five Elements Technique was excruciatingly slow to cultivate and demanded vast resources. In essence, it required mastering five separate techniques simultaneously: Metal Spirit Art, Wood Spirit Art, Water Spirit Art, Fire Spirit Art, and Earth Spirit Art.

During the initial Qi Refining stage, cultivators had to practice all five basic arts concurrently. Focusing on any single one yielded no special benefits—they remained ordinary. Even a Metal-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivator who swiftly advanced the Metal Spirit Art to Foundation Establishment would gain nothing, as these arts were interdependent. Only when cultivated together to profound levels would their true might manifest.

Upon reaching Foundation Establishment, these five elemental arts would evolve into what was termed "Five Spirit Bodies" or "Five Dharma Bodies": Metal Dharma Body, Wood Dharma Body, Water Dharma Body, Fire Dharma Body, and Earth Dharma Body.

Each Dharma Body granted mastery over its corresponding element—effortless spellcasting, heightened spiritual affinity, and formidable resistance to attacks of that attribute. At minor mastery, practitioners could even wield the corresponding elemental遁术 (escape arts).

However, even if a Metal-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivator endured the tedium of Qi Refinement and progressed to Dharma Body cultivation, their success would be fleeting. 

The Five Elements Arts were interlinked—cultivating just one Dharma Body, such as the Metal Dharma Body enabling the elusive Metal遁术 (rare even among Nascent Soul cultivators), would bring temporary glory. But Dharma Bodies couldn't exist independently for long. After forming one, the cultivator had to immediately begin cultivating either the Wood or Earth Dharma Body, or risk bodily collapse from rampant spiritual energy.

Only after completing all five Dharma Bodies would this peril vanish. Thus, the prerequisite for mastering the Profound Heaven Five Elements Technique was possessing all five spiritual roots.
