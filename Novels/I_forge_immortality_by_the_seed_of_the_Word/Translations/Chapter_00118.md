# Chapter 116: Perfecting the Dao Intent

In the Myriad Treasures Vault, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, his gaze calm and composed. Around him swirled an extraordinarily dense Dao Intent, which faintly coalesced into the form of a ferocious dragon soaring through the lunar realm. Its sinuous, powerful body undulated amidst wind and rain, unleashing terrifying roars that shook the void.

Ferocity! Violence! Metamorphosis! Profound stillness!

These various essences flowed through the depths of his eyes.

A jade talisman slowly materialized before him:

[Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (834/1000)]

This was the fourth day of Zhang Jing's dedicated comprehension of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent. It was also...

The radiance of magical techniques illuminated the heavens, their intense fluctuations perceptible even from dozens of miles away. This junior brother had only entered the Ninth Virtual Heaven half a month ago.

Mountains were no longer mountains; waters were no longer waters.

He hurriedly turned his gaze toward the Ascending Staircase.

Huang Jingtong's disheveled figure drifted down, looking somewhat embarrassed as he said, "Brother Huang's words are too modest. If you call this performance 'laughable,' then the rest of us are simply unworthy of being seen." One of the men nearby responded with a bitter smile.

At this thought...

Snapping back to reality...

This scene now reflected in Zhang Jing's eyes gradually dispersed, transforming into various principles of the Dao's charm and laws.

Unable to help himself, he decided to give it a try.

But these were just empty words.

The three-headed, four-armed guardian spirit showed no fear whatsoever.

The Dao Intent entwined around Zhang Jing's body first paused, then surged violently, transforming into a complete Lunar Serpent that plunged directly into his body.

The number abruptly changed to one hundred fifty!

"The final day!"

Just how far could this monstrous junior brother go?

If the original power of the Five Treasures Spiritual River was considered as one...

Yet this was only slightly over eighty percent of the Dao Intent.

Opposite him...

But this half-step seemed like an insurmountable chasm.

With a thought...

He had never actually seen the other party make a move.

Moreover...

"Lunar Serpent! Lunar Serpent!"

His voice carried a hint of lament, even a trace of despair.

Zhang Jing exerted all his strength to control the massive surge of lunar energy that threatened to spill out, then painstakingly channeled it back along its original path.

At the same time, he took the opportunity to observe...

The guardian spirit, wielding an iron staff, charged through layers of flames and magical techniques with its indestructible body, streaking like lightning toward the challenger not far away.

As his mental and spiritual energy was rapidly depleted...

**Chapter 116: Perfecting the Dao Intent**

Upon reaching maturity, it would overturn seas and skies!

Zhang Jing's eyes flashed.

He seemed to glimpse the fundamental principles hidden beneath the scroll.

Silently, he recited: Comprehend the Dao Intent!

"Indeed, with Brother's capabilities and three more months, it's entirely possible to comprehend the Dao Intent and transform your Dao Foundation," one person consoled.

These flames ignited upon contact and were nearly impossible to extinguish.

"What kind of spectacle would perfect Dao Intent present?"

A flicker of longing appeared in his eyes.

Zhang Jing repeated the thought silently in his mind.

As they spoke...

Without even establishing his Dao Foundation, he had already comprehended the Dao Intent—and to an exceptionally terrifying degree at that. Otherwise, how could he have forcefully ascended to the Ninth Virtual Heaven without the support of a Dao Foundation?

As his comprehension of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent deepened, its various mysteries gradually revealed themselves, and the enhancement to Zhang Jing's strength became increasingly formidable.

Abilities like summoning storms and waves, or spewing clouds and mist—innate techniques of the serpent—had already begun to take form. He could wield them at will.

Simultaneously...

A gourd shimmering with crimson light floated mid-air.

At this moment...

The vision of a Lunar Serpent encircling the moon suddenly appeared.

"Please excuse my poor performance," Huang Jingtong said.

Previously, he had only drawn out a wisp of lunar energy. But now? He had summoned an entire river of lunar essence—who could withstand that?

Instantly...

On the eighth level of the Ascending Staircase...

Time flowed steadily onward.

The icy killing intent and combat instincts buried deep within the Lunar Serpent's bloodline had quietly merged completely with Zhang Jing's consciousness.

Upon perfecting the Dao Intent, he felt as though he could summon the moon's power with a single thought.

Zhang Jing abruptly opened his eyes.

A surprised exclamation caught Huang Jingtong's attention.

He couldn't help but think of Zhang Jing.

Yet he had no confidence whatsoever.

It was only due to the limitations of his cultivation that the techniques' power didn't match the terrifying legends.

The tall man in black robes who had spoken earlier offered words of comfort.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing has arrived as well!"

Before him...

The commotion on the Ascending Staircase gradually faded as the three-headed, four-armed guardian spirit returned to its post, reverting to a shadowy silhouette.

This process...

No one knew how long it lasted.

The aura was utterly devastating!

Huang Jingtong responded with a faint smile.

In his field of vision...

Zhang Jing's expression suddenly changed.

As he pondered...

Yet the aura emanating from him and the faint traces of profound intent made it unmistakably clear—this was undoubtedly a young serpent.

**Chapter 116: Perfecting the Dao Intent**

"This seems to be the third time."

Not far away in mid-air...

Huang Jingtong sighed, a flicker of unwillingness crossing his face.

Only now did he understand why this serpent bore the name "Lunar."

"Ah... It seems Brother Huang has failed again," one of the tall figures in black robes remarked slowly.

A spark of interest appeared on Huang Jingtong's face.

Above Zhang Jing's head, an illusory five-colored auspicious cloud slowly materialized. As the hues cycled, vast spiritual energy filled his mind.

It could only be said that summoning was easier than dismissing.

Flames converged into a scorching torrent, swiftly flooding the eighth level of the Ascending Staircase before trickling downward.

The void rippled as if a window had suddenly opened, unleashing an overwhelming surge of lunar energy that instantly condensed into a river.

A deep streak of light pierced through thick clouds, landing squarely on the fourth level of the Ascending Staircase.

His talent for comprehension was truly enviable.

Five pairs of eyes remained fixed on the battle unfolding on the staircase.

However...

A moment of sudden enlightenment.

"Then I thank you for your kind words, Junior Brother. We still have three months—there's hope for us all!"

Zhang Jing's face gradually paled, yet the light in his eyes grew increasingly brilliant, as though it might burst forth at any moment.

[Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (Perfected)]

How terrifying was this?

Zhang Jing even had a vague premonition...

After all, this was his first time experiencing perfected Dao Intent—he lacked experience.

"Eh? Is that Junior Brother Zhang Jing? Has he come to challenge the Ascending Staircase too?"

At this moment...

This was the perfect opportunity to observe Zhang Jing's methods, particularly his Dao Intent. Perhaps it might offer some inspiration.

After all, every one of them in the Ninth Virtual Heaven stood just half a step away from comprehending the Dao Intent.

It was as if a critical threshold had been breached!

Within the space of Dao comprehension...

The gourd endlessly spewed dark red flames resembling molten lava, as though inexhaustible.

A faint aura of profound stillness and coldness slowly permeated the surroundings.

Though Zhang Jing still appeared human...

Who could have predicted the effect would be so extreme?

And now...
