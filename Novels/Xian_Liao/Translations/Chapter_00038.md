# Chapter 38: Metamorphosis

The roadside inn was established by villagers near the desolate mountains and had been operating for less than a year. In the past, when the Weiyuan Escort Agency traveled this route, they had no choice but to spend the night in a dilapidated temple in the mountains.

By the time the group arrived at the inn, two or three merchant caravans had already taken up residence. The place was fairly crowded, with some scholars accompanying the caravans to take part in the provincial examinations.

Seeing this, Escort Leader Wu and the others felt somewhat reassured.

Nevertheless, he still instructed the escorts, porters, and Zhou Qing's group not to consume any water or food from the inn. They would set off early the next morning, aiming to reach Changzhou City by evening.

Most of the lodgings were simple thatched huts.

But in the bitter cold, having a hut to shelter from the wind was better than nothing.

Otherwise, spending the night in a mountain temple would be miserable. If anyone or the horses fell ill, the situation would become even more troublesome.

Zhou Qing and Fu Song shared a hut as usual.

Fu Song meditated while Zhou Qing slept on the bed.

However, Zhou Qing remained more vigilant at night than before.

The closer they got to Changzhou, the more cautious they needed to be.

In the middle of the night, shouts of "Fire!" suddenly rang out. Flames erupted everywhere. The merchant caravans and the escort agency descended into chaos.

The thatched huts burned quickly.

In no time, the fire blazed across the sky.

Zhou Qing immediately left with Fu Song.

But the area was swarming with people, making it impossible to regroup with the escort agency.

Zhou Qing and Fu Song stuck close together.

Zhou Qing, in particular, was on high alert. He knew that what they had feared had finally arrived.

Fu Song, too, wore an unusually solemn expression. Based on his life experience, this fire was no accident.

As soon as they fled the inn, the crowd sought refuge by a nearby stream.

Next to them was a pitch-black forest.

Soon, the sound of galloping horses echoed through the night.

Someone shouted, "Watch out—bandits are coming!"

The "Pockmarked Bandits" were mountain outlaws. Merchants often suffered under their oppression, hence the derogatory nickname.

Two men dressed as porters approached Zhou Qing and Fu Song. Their faces were indistinguishable in the dark, but they claimed to be looking for the two to regroup with the rest of the escort agency.

Just as the two "porters" drew near, Zhou Qing narrowed his eyes. "Where is Escort Leader Wu? Take us to him."

Before the porters could answer, Zhou Qing moved. In a flash, he was in front of one of them, delivering a silent Ghost Kick straight to the chest.

The speed was astonishing.

Not only was the target caught off guard, but even the other porter and Fu Song were taken by surprise.

Fu Song, having been away from the martial world for years, lacked the experience of Escort Leader Wu. But as soon as Zhou Qing struck, he realized something was amiss.

Zhou Qing had memorized the appearances and builds of every escort and porter in the agency. Even in the dark, he could tell something was off from their silhouettes.

Without hesitation, Fu Song struck the other porter with his palm. His training in the Taiyue True Form Scripture had honed his strength to perfection. The porter crumpled to the ground.

The one Zhou Qing had kicked also lay motionless. In the darkness, there was no time to check if he was dead.

Zhou Qing didn't bother finishing him off. That kick had been aimed at a vital point—even if the man wasn't dead, he would be incapacitated by the pain.

He needed to conserve his strength for whatever came next.

---

The bandits' assault came swiftly.

Meanwhile, the fire in the huts showed no signs of dying down. Zhou Qing and Fu Song quickly retreated into the nearby woods.

In the darkness, Fu Song was fully alert.

Zhou Qing, too, remained vigilant.

Strangely, he felt a flicker of excitement.

The long-anticipated danger had finally arrived. The uncertainty was gone, replaced by a release of tension.

Now, it was time to act.

Through the gaps in the leaves, the glow of the burning inn illuminated the dark forest.

Bandits carrying torches entered the woods, accompanied by hunting dogs tracking human scents.

"These aren't ordinary bandits," Fu Song muttered.

Zhou Qing hurled an iron pellet, striking one of the dogs. But five bandits immediately charged toward them—their position had been exposed.

"Junior Brother, go. I'll hold them off." The five bandits were clearly trained, moving in unison.

Arrows whizzed toward them.

Fu Song swung his sleeves, using his Iron Sleeve technique to shield Zhou Qing.

In that brief moment of distraction, the bandits flanked them.

Without hesitation, Zhou Qing dashed deeper into the forest.

One group of bandits surrounded Fu Song while another pursued Zhou Qing.

Fu Song kicked the first bandit who lunged at him, his eyes narrowing. "Disciples of the Golden Light Temple."

The bandits didn't respond. The rest encircled Fu Song, keeping him pinned but unwilling to engage fully, wary of his skills.

Fu Song grew anxious. These were clearly the strongest among the bandits, and even he couldn't break free easily.

Though his explosive power was still at its peak, his stamina had waned with age.

Facing multiple opponents, he couldn't afford a single misstep.

"May the Heavenly Lord bless us." He silently prayed for Zhou Qing before focusing entirely on the enemies before him. The sooner he escaped, the sooner he could find Zhou Qing.

---

Deeper in the forest, the darkness and cold intensified.

Yet Zhou Qing's breathing and heartbeat remained steady.

His experience sneaking through Jiangzhou City at night served him well. The Deer Play strengthened his liver and sharpened his vision, allowing him to see far better than his pursuers in the dark.

He launched iron pellets—not at the bandits, but at their torches and the remaining two dogs.

The forest plunged into deeper darkness.

Without light or hounds, the bandits were as good as blind.

Fear took hold.

Zhou Qing stopped running and went on the offensive.

From his earlier glance, he knew the strongest bandits were occupied with Fu Song. Outnumbered, he couldn't afford to be passive—reinforcements would arrive for the enemy first.

The forest terrain became his silent ally.

With a Ghost Kick, he felled the nearest bandit.

The others reacted, but Zhou Qing melted back into the shadows.

Leaves rustled as the bandits' fear grew.

They had been paid, but that didn't mean they were willing to die.

Yet death stalked them relentlessly.

Another bandit collapsed.

"Crossbows!" one shrieked before a poisoned bolt silenced him.

The remaining bandits felt the crushing weight of dread.

The darkness and the forest's natural barriers ensnared them like an invisible vortex.

The true hunter had become the hunted.

The pressure magnified in the suffocating silence.

---

A quarter-hour later, the last two bandits broke and fled, only to be struck down by iron pellets and a swift sword thrust from the shadows.

Killing was as effortless as cutting grass.

Zhou Qing quickly swallowed a few Qi and Blood Pills to replenish his energy. He always carried a waterskin.

Retracing his steps, he found Fu Song still locked in combat.

An iron pellet struck one bandit's shoulder, creating an opening. Fu Song seized the moment and struck.

The bandit fell.

The others retreated, allowing Fu Song to disengage.

The bandits regrouped and charged back into the forest—only to emerge moments later, faces pale with terror.

Two more of their best had vanished.

---

Before long, Escort Leader Wu arrived with reinforcements.

The bandits fled.

Fu Song and Zhou Qing rejoined the escort agency.

At dawn, they assessed the damage. Among the bodies in the forest, Wu recognized disciples of the Golden Light Temple—their distinctive training was unmistakable.

Over a dozen corpses.

Outnumbered in the dead of night.

Zhou Qing and Fu Song offered no explanations.

But the escorts regarded Fu Song with even greater awe.

Unbeknownst to them, Fu Song was far more shocked than they were.

In terms of martial skill, Zhou Qing was no match for him. But when it came to killing, Fu Song now fell short. Had age dulled him?

Zhou Qing's words echoed in his mind:

"Senior Brother, as you said, the best way to kill is with weapons."

"For me, terrain and darkness are also weapons."

A profound realization dawned on Fu Song: Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows nature.

"Senior Brother said my perspective was too narrow to master Qingfu Temple's highest arts. He was right." Because Fu Song had only ever considered weapons as weapons.

---

The rest of the journey passed in silence.

The escorts assumed the young scholar was shaken and left him alone.

But Zhou Qing wasn't frightened. The slaughter had stirred something indescribable within him—a metamorphosis.

This killing was different from the last two times.

He truly was formidable now.

The corpses replayed in his mind like vengeful ghosts howling for retribution.

Zhou Qing felt no fear.

"You brought this upon yourselves."

A tiger's roar echoed in his mind, and the ghosts cowered.

An intangible aura of killing intent enveloped him.

A fierce tiger seemed to guard the depths of his consciousness.

His attention turned to the养生主 (Nurturing the Lord Within). The entry for the Tiger Play had expanded:

"Tiger Play (Proficient, Tiger's Wrath - Initial Stage)."

Fu Song, more perceptive than the escorts, noticed the change in Zhou Qing—something inexplicable yet undeniable.

An inexplicable reverence for his junior brother arose within him.

Could Zhou Qing be the successor fate had chosen for Qingfu Temple?

"Once Junior Brother passes the provincial exams, perhaps I should teach him the Taiyue True Form Scripture."

Zhou Qing wouldn't turn sixteen until August. His potential far outstripped Fu Song's, and his scholarly talents only added to his promise.

According to Qingfu Temple's records, such individuals were exceedingly rare.

In Daoist terms, they possessed "immortal roots."

The bald monks called it "wisdom roots."

Destined for greatness.

Martial prowess alone made one a mere warrior. Only with profound wisdom guiding one's cultivation could one hope to unlock the mysterious gates beyond.

Zhou Qing contemplated the Tiger's Wrath.

He sensed an inexplicable transformation taking root within him.

The Tiger's Wrath wasn't accidental—it was the culmination of accumulated effort, the aftermath of killing, and his scholarly cultivation of spirit.

His mental fortitude far surpassed that of ordinary men, even Fu Song.

Thus, all three times he had killed, he had remained composed.

Especially this time—his mindset had been as detached as cutting grass.

Human lives were as insignificant as weeds.

A cold indifference toward life welled up within him.

"The Zhang family, the Golden Light Temple, the Fierce Tiger Gang?"

"You want me dead? Then you will die first."

In his mind, the tiger roared.

Yet Zhou Qing's expression remained serene as Changzhou's gates came into view. He even joked to Fu Song:

"Senior Brother, this journey was smooth and uneventful after all. We'll make it in time for the Lantern Festival."

Fu Song choked back a reply.

"'Smooth' and 'uneventful,' indeed!"
