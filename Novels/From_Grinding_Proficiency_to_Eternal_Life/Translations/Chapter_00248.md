# Chapter 248: The Path of Life Severed

**Divine Weapon!?**

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly. This strange fragrance seemed to be caused by some kind of divine weapon. His gaze shifted to the female monk's wrist.

"May I ask for your esteemed name, Venerable?"

"This humble monk is a disciple of the Maitreya Monastery. My Dharma name is Jingming."

As the female monk clasped her palms together, her six fingers trembled slightly, actually radiating threads of golden light.

"Although Benefactor Xu is burdened with bloodlust, your spirit platform is clear. You seem to have a predestined affinity with Buddhism."

Xu Yunfan was speechless. "An old man from the Dao Sect once said I had no affinity with the Dao. It seems he was mistaken."

Jingming smiled faintly. "Those who enter our Buddhist sect do not concern themselves with qualifications."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

This remark was somewhat piercing. Xu Yunfan didn't dwell on it and instead asked, "May I ask what Venerable Master means by the 'path of life'? Is there a way out of this secret realm here?"

Jingming was about to answer when her expression tightened slightly. Her twelve fingers blossomed like lotuses, forming several hand seals before she suddenly looked up at Xu Yunfan.

She quickly clasped her palms together, and the Eight Treasures Bodhi Beads on her wrist suddenly cracked.

The faint golden light flowing between her six fingers was actually pushed back three inches by Xu Yunfan's surrounding blood energy. The hem of her cassock stirred without wind as fine beads of sweat seeped out.

"Benefactor, do you know what the Six Dusts Perversion is?"

Jingming suddenly changed her hand seal. The sevenfold halo cultivated from her mental cultivation was reflected on Xu Yunfan's dragon scale armor as a distorted Buddha shadow. In the physical realm, however, there was no anomaly. Only those with sharp mental perception, who could control their own spirit and enter a state of clarity, could see this phenomenon.

"Benefactor, by devouring the lingering煞气 (killing intent) of the sword qi, you have severed the life gate of this earth vein."

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged, but he was instantly on guard. This bald donkey had actually seen through the secret he was trying to conceal in one glance.

The Maitreya Monastery of Monan Dao is one of the six top sects of the Great Zhou Empire and the only Buddhist Zen sect. It is extremely secretive, rarely showing itself to the world, focusing solely on cultivating the body for reincarnation.

Its supreme skill, the Maitreya Golden Body Sutra, is considered the top body-refining divine art under heaven. However, the Maitreya Monastery believes this is merely a method of self-protection; the true profound method is the cultivation of the next life.

"The path of life..." Jingming said slowly, "The path of life is severed."

What made her even more cautious was that Xu Yunfan before her seemed like a flood beast.

"So that's how it is..."

The female monk took half a step back. Under the call of the Buddhist divine weapon, a golden lotus phenomenon actually appeared beneath her feet.

A trick to frighten people.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were deep. No wonder the Maitreya Monastery of Monan Dao had been unshakable for thousands of years. With just this technique alone, the common people in this feudal society would only see them as true Buddhas descending to the world.

Moreover, the Jingming before him had six fingers, a sign of a Buddha, and was naturally regarded as a Buddha's holy son in Monan Dao.

"Benefactor, you are actually my Mirror Demon Test!"

Jingming's eyes were black and white, clear and distinct. The threads of peace and tranquility suddenly filled the surroundings.

"Are you willing to enter the Buddhist path with me, wash away the demonic energy, and in the next life, you will surely achieve enlightenment and perform deeds of immeasurable merit."

Xu Yunfan's emotions inexplicably calmed down. Just as he was about to answer, his expression faltered slightly before he reacted.

A mental illusion...

"Venerable Master's Seven Treasures Bodhi Incense is truly marvelous."

Xu Yunfan's foot arch crushed three pieces of basalt, and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer scorched a black trigram pattern onto the ground. "It's just that this 'Buddhist affinity' might be too much for Xu to bear."

The golden lotus shadow beneath Jingming's feet suddenly solidified, actually materializing from a string of Eight Treasures Bodhi Beads around her ankle.

The surface of the Bodhi seeds was carved with microscopic versions of the Shurangama Mantra, and at this moment, they resonated and trembled with the Fire Swallowing Dragon Halberd on Xu Yunfan's back.

"Jade venom corrodes the meridians, and the sword soul shatters."

The female monk suddenly looked into the depths of the ground fissure. The Wheel of Sun seal formed by her six fingers glowed with blood light. "Benefactor, do you know that Pei Yan's bones are not yet cold, and the Sword Pavilion's sword qi has already entangled your Triple Burner vital acupoints?"

The six major sects under heaven have existed since the time when the primordial spiritual energy had not yet dissipated. Now, with the Great Zhou Empress stirring up the primordial spiritual energy in the earth veins, many previously ineffective secret techniques have regained a fraction of their power.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. Without hesitation, he activated the Lin Mantra, entering the Lin State. His expression quickly calmed down. With heart reflecting heart, he continuously illuminated his Triple Burner meridians.

In just a breath, Xu Yunfan indeed discovered a wisp of sword qi dwelling within his organs and meridians.

Pei Yan's move of dissolving the Dao with his weapon was not just a desperate measure; it was also a method of planting a seed of sword qi within him.

If someone from the Sword Pavilion were to detect it, they would naturally know that Xu Yunfan had killed Pei Yan.

Coincidentally, because he cultivated the Triple Burner Sword Nurturing Art, this wisp of sword qi was deeply entrenched and could not be removed.

Pei Yan, Pei Yan, worthy of being a天生剑骨 (Heavenly Gifted Sword Bone), capable of becoming the Sword Pavilion's Itinerant Daoist. His intelligence and wisdom are both top-tier.

Although Xu Yunfan was surprised, he was not panicked. He felt more admiration than anything.

With the Attribute Panel, this wisp of sword qi would eventually melt away like snow as he cultivated the Triple Burner Sword Nurturing Art to Great Perfection, returning to its source.

Most importantly, this gave him a key to opening the Ninth Realm.

A double-edged sword!

Let's see if the Sword Pavilion can find him first.

Was Pei Yan so confident that Xu Yunfan couldn't enter the Ninth Realm?

Xu Yunfan sneered inwardly. These people from top sects look down on others, just like that毕昇 (Bi Sheng) from the Dao Sect. It's as if they have evolved a reproductive isolation from the common people.

Xu Yunfan, having exited the Lin State, faced Jingming's pair of peaceful, tranquil, and dignified eyes.

Xu Yunfan spoke. "I really hate your eyes."

"Hm?"

Jingming was taken aback.

Before Xu Yunfan's words had finished, he had already shattered the ground. He shot forward, holding the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, aiming straight for Jingming's glabella, shrouded in purple-red killing intent.

Jingming's reaction was extremely fast. She formed hand seals, and a large amount of visible aura burst out from her body. Assisted by the divine weapon Eight Treasures Bodhi Beads, it transformed into twelve golden lotuses. A Buddhist chant resonated from the void: "The sea of suffering is boundless; why does Benefactor not turn back..."

The golden aura condensed into a solid form, spreading out in layers like Buddhist light. The tip of Xu Yunfan's halberd seemed to sink into a quagmire.

The moment Jingming clasped her palms together, the Eight Treasures Bodhi Beads on her wrist emitted a brilliant light. The extremely thin spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the surroundings was actually absorbed by her. Behind her appeared a three-zhang-tall Buddha phantom, and a swastika (卍) Dharma seal rotated and spread from her pupils.

For a hundred zhang around, the grass and trees moved without wind. Countless fine golden glows rose from the ground fissure, constructing a dense barrier of the Diamond Sutra text between the two of them.

"Tricking spirits and haunting ghosts! Do you think you're cultivating immortality?"

Xu Yunfan laughed and twisted his waist, swinging his arm. Mystical patterns surfaced on the surface of his dragon scale armor.

This Buddhist light was nothing but an illusory image stimulated by the Eight Treasures Bodhi Beads, no different from a holographic projection.

The next instant, the seventh form of the Thousand Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Art, "Shattering Mountain and Crushing Star," slammed into the sutra text screen. Thirty-six sutra symbols exploded with a sound, yet they were reborn and reassembled within the Buddhist light.

Jingming stepped on the lotus and rose into the air. The halo behind her head was like a scorching sun. "Jade dragon killing intent and Sword Pavilion karma are entangled with you. Benefactor, you have fallen into the Avici Hell without realizing it."
