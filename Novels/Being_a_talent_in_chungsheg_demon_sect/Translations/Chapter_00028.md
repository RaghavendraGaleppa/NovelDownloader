Chapter 28: Nine Transformations Dragon Art

“The one whose name is called, approach me.”

Lu Yang opened his eyes, and after a long moment, he exhaled deeply, awakening from the dream-like illusion of his past and present lives. “I choose the magic treasure.”

The next second, his dantian stirred. A scarlet sword core, covered in intricate array patterns and glittering like the stars in the heavens, appeared within his dantian, emitting a clear sword hum.

Lu Yang was pleased. This sword core was the fruit of over twenty years of his efforts in his previous life. Not only were its materials top-notch, but it had also been enhanced by the Demonic Transformation Blood Divine Light. More importantly, he had successfully embedded a superior array formation into the sword core just before his death, transforming it into an array treasure.

With this, when Lu Yang next engaged in combat, he could pull his enemies into an array diagram. The advantage of this was obvious; no matter how powerful a cultivator, they could not single-handedly contend with an array formation set up by a cultivator of the same realm.

The reason Immortal Maiden Qingchen was not particularly strong was that she was only at the Mid-stage of Qi Condensation. And from Lu Yang's current perspective, she hadn't studied array formations long enough, certainly not as long as he had, having diligently researched them for twenty years.

“It’s time to give you a name,” Lu Yang thought, and an eerie blood shadow, identical to his own appearance, immediately emerged from the sword core. With two bodies sharing one mind, he chuckled lightly, “You were refined by me sacrificing myself in my previous life, and you are augmented by the Demonic Transformation Blood Divine Light. From now on, you shall be called Blood Yang.”

The sword core hummed in response, as if in agreement.

Dismissing his distracting thoughts, Lu Yang glanced at Liu Xin, who was still eloquently speaking on the stage, then withdrew his gaze. There was no immediate hurry for the Innate One Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner.

Following his previous life’s blueprint, Lu Yang began to act. He went up to the stage, accepted his assignment to the Joyous Union Palace, and then executed the counter-kill on Yu Suzhen.

He no longer borrowed money from Zhao Xuhe. Instead, he directly sold the beginner benefits he received, such as the White Bone Flying Sword, and then quietly began purchasing Substitute Death Yin Puppets.

Soon, the price of Substitute Death Yin Puppets soared. Lu Yang secretly fueled the rise, buying low and selling high, continuously expanding his capital, then went on a massive buying spree to increase his holdings. However, to avoid attracting jealous eyes, he did not sell at the peak price of his previous life. Instead, he exited the market when the price reached 3000 points. At that time, he had accumulated a full 20 Substitute Death Yin Puppets.

He had made a massive profit of 60,000 contribution points.

After completing all of this, Lu Yang purchased a large quantity of spirit pills, then immediately sealed off his cave dwelling and took out his greatest gains from his four reincarnations: the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* and the *Ten Thousand Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Scroll*.

The former was for Qi Condensation, and the latter for Foundation Establishment. Together, they formed a cultivation technique capable of refining Third-grade True Qi and directly pointing towards the Golden Core Dao, perfectly meeting Lu Yang’s expectations.

“The *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* has ten layers, corresponding to the ten layers of Qi Condensation. As the name suggests, each layer can trigger a True Qi transformation, including the Heavenly Serpent Transformation, Divine Eagle Transformation, Azure Ox Transformation, Brocade Tiger Transformation... After nine transformations, one transforms into a dragon, which can increase the chance of breaking through to Foundation Establishment by 30%.”

Lu Yang was captivated as he read, and immediately decided to disperse his cultivation base and recultivate.

“Bang!”

As the True Qi in his dantian rapidly dissipated, Lu Yang’s cultivation realm plummeted. In a short while, he reverted from the Fourth Layer of Qi Condensation back to a mortal. However, he didn't waste the scattered True Qi; he fed it all to the "Innate One Qi." This External Qi, refined by Lu Yang in his second life through self-sacrifice, had now been nourished by his cultivation in this life and had become akin to his avatar. With its protection during his secluded cultivation, he wouldn't be completely defenseless.

In a blink of an eye, three years passed.

Inside his cave dwelling, Lu Yang sat cross-legged on a futon, silently circulating his profound art. His dantian, which had been empty after he dispersed his cultivation, was now occupied by an even grander True Qi. His Qi flowed as his will dictated, transforming endlessly. One moment, it was a swift rabbit leaping through his extraordinary meridians; another, a python lurking in his dantian; then a variegated brocade tiger roaring skyward; and then a graceful flying eagle soaring freely. His transformations were truly limitless.

After a long time, Lu Yang finally exhaled deeply. His Qi, like a white arrow, did not dissipate after leaving his body, but transformed into a majestic azure ox, walking slowly as if carrying a colossal divine mountain.

“It’s done!” Lu Yang’s face lit up with joy. These three years of arduous cultivation had been much smoother than in his previous three lives, primarily because in this life, he had ample contribution points and was not lacking in any external medicines. Thus, in just three years, he had returned to the Sixth Layer of Qi Condensation, the peak of the Mid-stage.

Although he was currently stuck at the Mid-stage bottleneck, Lu Yang was confident that in five years at most, or three years at least, he would surely break through the bottleneck again and return to the Late-stage of Qi Condensation! Furthermore, even though he was still at the Sixth Layer of Qi Condensation, his combat prowess was probably not much different from his previous life, simply because his True Qi in this life was vastly superior to what it once was.

“Nine Transformations Dragon Art, each transformation comes with a corresponding spell or divine ability. The Brocade Tiger Transformation increases True Qi destructive power, the Azure Ox Transformation enhances physical divine strength, the Divine Eagle Transformation grants clairvoyance, the Heavenly Serpent Transformation allows for aura concealment, the Jade Rabbit Transformation increases speed, and the Mountain Camel Transformation boosts True Qi recovery speed...”

These six transformations almost completely bridged the gap between the Mid-stage and Late-stage of Qi Condensation!

However, what most captivated Lu Yang was the "Flying Fish Transformation" among the nine transformations, because the effect of this layer of transformation was simple: it allowed for a breakthrough in a bottleneck!

“If I were to cultivate the Sixth Transformation now, I could probably break through to the Late-stage in an instant.”

“But that would be too much of a waste.” Lu Yang harbored grand ambitions; he naturally wouldn't use such a precious breakthrough opportunity for merely the Late-stage of Qi Condensation. He intended to save it for when he broke through to the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation.

Lu Yang’s plan for this life was simple: cultivate.

“I will cultivate silently, and after reaching the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation, I’ll seamlessly transition to the *Ten Thousand Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Scroll*, remaining in seclusion until I reach the Foundation Establishment realm, astonishing everyone!”

With that thought, Lu Yang casually popped a spirit pill into his mouth and once again entered meditative cultivation.

Then, just a few days later.

“Rumble!”

Lu Yang was jolted awake from his meditative state by a violent shaking of the earth. He opened his eyes, only to find that his Innate One Qi avatar, which he had left guarding outside, had been shattered.

An powerful enemy invasion? Lu Yang was utterly bewildered. In this life, he had been confined to his cave dwelling, cultivating diligently and ignoring everything happening outside. Why would someone suddenly break in?

Filled with questions, Lu Yang stepped out of his cave dwelling, only to see a familiar face he hadn't expected.

“It’s you?”

Outside his cave, Zhao Xuhe's eyes were bloodshot. Beside him stood several cultivators with formidable auras, all glaring furiously at Lu Yang.

“Senior Brother,” Lu Yang cupped his hands, “This junior is Lu Yang, I don’t know—”

“It really is you!” Zhao Xuhe cut him off, raging, “Coiled Dragon Island mysteriously disappeared! My fortuitous encounter, which I cultivated merit for three lifetimes to obtain, suddenly vanished! I paid a huge price to invite my Master to deduce the causality, and my Master told me that the fortuitous encounter was taken by a Saint Sect disciple named Lu in this area!”

“Tell me! Is the True Person Coiled Dragon’s legacy in your hands?!”

“...”

As Zhao Xuhe’s voice fell, Lu Yang was first stunned, then, as if realizing something, his expression visibly darkened at once.
