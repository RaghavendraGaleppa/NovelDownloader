# Chapter 88: Li Mo: "Young Lady, Shall We Practice Dual Cultivation?"

At the stroke of midnight, an extreme chill spread once again.

However, this time, it was within Li Mo's room.

Wherever the moonlight reached inside the room was covered in a layer of snow-white frost.

**【Penalty for the Loser: Share the same bed for one month.】**

**【Progress: 1/30.】**

**【Congratulations, Host, for fulfilling the penalty conditions. Rewards will be distributed in stages.】**

**【Next reward to be distributed: Three bottles of Emperor’s Fluid.】**

Three bottles of Emperor’s Fluid.

That was enough for her to use for a long time, and even after running out, she would still be able to enjoy the benefits.

This punishment seemed strict, but compared to the rewards, it didn't seem like much?

Thinking of this, Ying Bing’s thoughts slightly stalled.

If the target of the punishment wasn't him...

Would she... still feel this way?

The steady, powerful heartbeat and breathing sounds in her ear grew closer, clear and real. The confusion in her heart seemed to dissipate little by little.

One thing was certain: she definitely wasn't in her Immortal Tribulation.

"He shouldn't be conscious right now..."

Using the moonlight, Ying Bing examined the youth lying just inches away from her.

His features were gentle, his face like white jade. Because he was drunk, a faint flush had colored his cheeks.

His handsome and refined facial features, if dressed in a scholar's robe, would give him the air of a scholarly disciple.

At the moment, a hint of a silly smile played on his lips, creating a stark contrast with his usual smart and witty nature.

Even as he lay beside her, his body temperature was scorching hot, unaffected by the chill.

To speak without bias...

He was quite handsome.

It was also this person who, through a twist of fate, had somehow taken her place at the top.

Having lived two lives, he might be the only person to ever surpass her.

Even by Ying Bing's standards, she had to admit.

Li Mo did indeed have the qualifications to be considered a prodigy.

But, this would be the last time.

Next time...

Just then.

"Mmm..."

Suddenly, an arm draped over, resting on her body.

Little Li had a bad sleeping habit, often adopting unsightly positions.

"....."

...

The night seemed exceptionally long.

The next morning.

"Who am I?"

A certain Mr. Li opened his eyes in a daze, staring at the ceiling in a stupor. His head didn't hurt, but it felt a bit empty.

After spacing out for a while, his memories finally returned to his mind.

He remembered drinking with his Master last night.

"Alcohol and lust are truly things one must not touch."

"From today onwards, I'm quitting drinking!"

Little Li swore in his heart.

He sat up. The familiar furnishings in his sight made him feel that something was off.

Moreover, faint, familiar, and refreshing scents drifted into his nose intermittently...

Li Mo: "!"

I slept here, so where did the Ice Cube sleep?

His ears twitched. He heard the sound of sword wind whistling from downstairs.

Looking down from the window, he could see that peerless, cold背影, her sword moving along with the falling flowers.

The familiar Ice Cube was back.

**【Congratulations, Host, for successfully helping Ying Bing regain her confidence.】**

**【Investment Feedback: "Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh"】**

Li Mo smiled with relief.

It seemed yesterday's chicken soup was useful.

A young maiden of sixteen,果然 loves to hear stories. I should tell more in the future...

Just by its name, this martial art wasn't an ordinary item!

Li Mo smiled as he checked the introduction of the manual, then his smile froze at the corner of his mouth.

**【Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh】**: "A supreme dual cultivation technique with infinite妙用. It allows two practitioners of equal realm to progress together, their spirits and wills merging. When cultivated to a profound level, it can even trigger phenomena."

Li Mo: "......"

The name is so formal, but it's a dual cultivation technique in the end?

Who am I supposed to practice this with! (Throws the book in frustration).

Alright, after reading through the content, Li Mo admitted that he had misunderstood.

---

Although this is dual cultivation, it doesn't follow the path of yin-yang energy exchange. Even between people of the same gender, as long as the compatibility is high enough, it can be practiced.

Who should he find?

Li Mo went downstairs and saw that the Ice Cube had just finished her sword practice, her eyes lifting to look at him.

The Ice Cube?

Wait a minute.

By the way, he slept in his own room last night, so where did the Ice Cube sleep?

"You were very drunk yesterday," Ying Bing said softly.

"....."

Li Mo's throat tightened.

He must have just wanted to get up to pee last night, and then forgot that he had switched rooms to sleep.

"Uh... I was drunk, did I do anything... inappropriate?" Li Mo asked, sweating slightly.

Ying Bing shook her head. "You slept very soundly."

"That's good."

Li Mo sighed in relief.

Fortunately, it was the Ice Cube in the room. If it had been another woman, that would have been a problem.

"How is your study of those two sword manuals coming along?"

Ying Bing naturally didn't dwell on the events of last night.

Li Mo nodded. "Those two sword manuals, they were originally one, weren't they?"

This conclusion was kindly provided by Princess Jiang.

That girl, after getting the sword manuals, actually held the Sun Wheel Sword Manual in her left hand and the Moonlight Sword Manual in her right, and practiced them simultaneously.

After she discovered that the two sword manuals belonged to the same sword art, she thought it was a test from the Heavenly尊 teacher and happily ran over to tell him.

"You discovered it indeed," Ying Bing said casually, but a slight ripple passed through the depths of her eyes.

"Since that's the case, let's use this sword art to discuss the Dao of the Sword today."

"......"

Little Li fell into deep thought.

He didn't know it himself yet.

A supreme sword art would require a significant amount of martial arts insight. Even though he had been acting as a "porter" between the Ice Cube and Princess Jiang recently, accumulating about two hundred and thirty years' worth, it still pained him to spend it.

But, he had to spend it when necessary.

If his sword Dao couldn't keep up, he wouldn't be able to farm rewards from the two of them.

"Wait for me for a moment."

**【Fifty years of martial arts insight successfully infused.】**

**【Year 1: Facing the supreme sword art, you achieved nothing and had no idea where to start.】**

**【Year 8: You finally领悟ed the connection between the "Sun Wheel Sword Manual" and the "Moonlight Sword Manual."】**

**【Year 12: You finally connected the two sword arts, turning them into the "Sun and Moon Intersecting Sword Art."】**

...

**【Year 50: Your "Sun and Moon Intersecting Sword Art" has reached initial proficiency.】**

Understanding flooded his mind, and Li Mo let out a soft sigh.

Initial proficiency... it would have to do.

"Let's begin."

...

Half an hour later.

The two of them sheathed their swords respectively.

"We haven't achieved a merging of spirits and wills."

"At this rate, it will be impossible to achieve a perfect union in a short time," Ying Bing said, her eyes downcast, clearly not satisfied with the result of their joint practice.

It was strange.

Li Mo's talent in the sword Dao wasn't bad.

He had indeed mastered a supreme-level sword art in a short time.

But why did it feel so strange when the two of them practiced together?

For a moment, she couldn't tell if the problem lay with her or with Li Mo.

"Perhaps we aren't默契 (tacitly understanding) enough," Li Mo scratched his head.

He felt it was highly likely because he was too weak to keep up with the Ice Cube's rhythm.

What should he do?

By the way, mastering this sword art together with the Ice Cube counts as an investment, right?

But the troublesome thing was, even if he poured all his martial arts insight into the "Sun and Moon Intersecting Sword Art," he probably wouldn't be able to push it to perfection.

"Tacit understanding... requires the two people's spirits and wills to be in harmony..." Ying Bing mused thoughtfully.

A spark of inspiration suddenly flashed through Li Mo's mind.

"I have a dual cultivation technique here, it might have a miraculous effect. Would you like to try it?"
