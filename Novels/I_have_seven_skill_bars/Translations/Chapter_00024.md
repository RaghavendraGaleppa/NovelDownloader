# Chapter 24: Admonition

Qingyu's expression also grew serious. She knew she had to stop Dongfeng's idea. In this matter, it could only be said that Ding Rui lacked consideration, but he hadn't actually done anything wrong. If Dongfeng caused trouble and the sect assigned blame, Dongfeng's responsibility would definitely be greater.

Although they were cultivation partners, Qingyu had always been the more mature and assertive one. At this moment, her tone was very serious: "Your talent is not weak either, and you're about to become an outer sect disciple. Logically, you should have the advantage, but Ding Rui is no simple person."

"You only know that his talent in the 'Golden Radiance Art' is exceptional, being able to kill large aphids even at Qi Condensation First Level. But what you don't know is that behind his ability to kill large aphids lies his talent in spiritual farming."

"Senior Brother Mutian mentioned before to the senior brothers in the management office that Ding Rui can control eight Golden Radiance Spears to surround and kill large aphids. Otherwise, what did you think he used to kill them?"

"Eight Golden Radiance Spears, controlling eight at once – this is the most important talent for becoming a spiritual farmer. I heard Senior Brother Mutian even gave Ding Rui his family's Five Elements cultivation records, which shows how highly he thinks of him. Why would you offend someone who is almost certain to become a spiritual farmer in the future, and can even successfully advance to Foundation Establishment to become an outer sect disciple, all for such a small matter?"

Qingyu continued, "Even if Ding Rui doesn't become an outer sect disciple, just his status as a spiritual farmer, you know how much the sect values them. One spiritual farmer is worth ten spiritual field cultivators!" After speaking, Qingyu stared straight at Dongfeng, waiting for his reaction.

The reason he sought out Qingyu tonight to discuss this was precisely because he wanted her to help him deal with Ding Rui. However, Qingyu was much more mature than Dongfeng. Not only did she not go along with Dongfeng's wishes, but she also revealed that Ding Rui had gained the attention of Mutian and the sect, and was highly likely to become a spiritual farmer. Spiritual farmers were indeed highly valued by the sect. Although spiritual farmers had no abilities other than farming, they were clearly more precious than Foundation Establishment cultivators. And resources were always the most crucial element in cultivation.

Just as Qingyu expected, Dongfeng came to his senses.

"Sigh!" He was silent for a long time, finally letting out a heavy sigh: "Then what should I do? Am I really going to have to wait until the next spiritual field harvest before I can get resources to cultivate to Foundation Establishment? That's another four months! I can't do anything for those four months!"

After he finished speaking, she glared, putting on a mock-angry expression. This was, of course, a jest, but it clearly had an effect.

Dongfeng pursed his lips and thought for a while before finally nodding: "Then I'll just take one. We'll each have one. It's not that I can't wait; with the reward from the next spiritual field harvest, I'll definitely be able to break through the Qi Condensation stage!"

"It's just that today, those busybodies made me lose my composure a bit. Honestly, thinking back now, those extra spirit grains weren't originally mine. They were earned by my own ability."

"And Ding Rui also earned them through his own ability, without using any schemes or tricks. How can I blame him? I can only blame myself for not being strong enough, for lacking talent."

Qingyu shook her head: "Nonsense, you are strong and very talented. Since you can't compare to him in the spiritual fields, then just become an outer sect disciple sooner. Ding Rui might be very useful in the spiritual fields, but once your cultivation realm is higher, you might surpass him."
