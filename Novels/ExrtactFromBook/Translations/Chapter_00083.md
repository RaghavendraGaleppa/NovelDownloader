# Chapter 83: Thunder Summoning Art  

The sky was filled with apocalyptic divine thunder, shattering everything in its path and blotting out the sun and moon!  

With a single gesture from the True Master, the overwhelming lightning cascaded down toward the earth.  

The sea of thunder in the sky converged toward a central rift, forming a celestial river of lightning that bridged heaven and earth.  

No one could fathom the width of this thunderous river!  

It mirrored the surging Tongtian River beneath the Feilai Peak, creating a breathtaking spectacle.  

The onlookers trembled under the terrifying might of this divine power, their Dao hearts quaking as if the lightning would strike them at any moment.  

Yet, strangely, despite the overwhelming force crashing onto the plaza, not a single trace of destruction was left behind.  

The colossal power vanished without a trace after its descent!  

As time passed, an aura of life emerged from the destructive force.  

A slender green light emerged from the metallic tiles of the plaza.  

Nurtured by the lightning-infused mana, the green radiance grew taller and taller—revealing itself to be a living bamboo shoot!  

This was no mere illusion of mana but a genuine living organism.  

Baptized by the lightning, the emerald bamboo grew rapidly, soon reaching the height of a person.  

Its segments were three inches long, as thick as a thumb, resembling jade in texture, while its leaves were sharp as arrows, exuding a piercing aura.  

Once the bamboo reached two meters in height, it ceased growing upward and instead sprouted several shoots from its roots.  

As the thunderous mana continued to pour down, the shoots absorbed it and flourished.  

Before long, an entire bamboo grove had taken root in one corner of the plaza.  

The earliest bamboo stalks had already transformed into a violet-jade-like quality.  

**Third-tier spiritual bamboo: [Thunder Bamboo]!**  

True Master Shang Xi, who cultivated the *Great Freedom Thunder Transformation Scripture*, had comprehended the Dao of Life amidst the destruction of thunder. From the power of lightning, he had birthed the third-tier [Thunder Bamboo]!  

Only after the [Thunder Bamboo] had fully matured did Shang Xi finally withdraw his power.  

"Fellow disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace! The path to immortality is long—farewell until we meet again!"  

With a resounding cry, Shang Xi soared into the heavens upon a bolt of lightning, vanishing into the distance.  

He departed swiftly, leaving behind not a single leaf—only the lingering storm clouds in his wake.  

Meanwhile, the black dragon [Chuan Zong], coiled atop Feilai Peak, suddenly stirred.  

The dragon, which had been lying motionless with its jaws parted, abruptly raised its head toward the sky.  

Opening its massive maw, [Chuan Zong] began inhaling the residual thunderous mana.  

A tremendous suction force erupted from its mouth, yet nothing aside from the mana was affected.  

Before long, the once-raging thunderclouds had been completely devoured by [Chuan Zong]!  

The black dragon then let out a satisfied belch before settling back into its original position.  

On the plaza, the avatar of [Chuan Zong] summoned the scattered disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace back before him.  

The disciples appeared dazed, as if thoroughly battered by the experience.  

At this moment, Li Changle spoke:  

"Senior Shang Xi was the most recent True Master of our Divine Thunder Palace to achieve immortality. In the thousand years since his ascension, our sect has failed to produce another."  

"This is indeed the failing of our Tian and Yuan generations!"  

"All of you Miao-generation disciples joined the sect within the last three hundred years and are unfamiliar with me."  

"But now that I have assumed the mantle of Sect Master, I shall fulfill my duties with utmost dedication!"  

"Let us conclude today's ceremony. Reflect deeply upon the insights you have gained and strive with redoubled effort toward immortality!"  

With that, the succession of the Sect Master was officially complete.  

Han Yue had only just recovered from the awe-inspiring display of the True Master's power.  

The disciples began dispersing into small groups to discuss what they had witnessed, with many crowding around [Chuan Zong] to ask questions about the earlier demonstration.  

Han Yue had intended to join them, but Li Changle called him away.  

He followed Li Changle back to the [Celestial Observatory Hall], where the new Sect Master would now reside.  

Once seated, Li Changle asked,  

"Having witnessed the True Master's demonstration today, what insights have you gained, Yuanchu?"  

Han Yue pondered before replying,  

"Your disciple's cultivation is still shallow, and my understanding of the Dao is lacking. I could only feel the overwhelming might of the True Master, filling me with reverence. Yet, the profound truths he revealed remain beyond my grasp."  

Li Changle nodded and said,  

"True Master Shang Xi manifested the Dao of Life through the destructive essence of thunder, creating a third-tier spiritual entity from the void—a testament to his profound cultivation."  

"His demonstration was never meant for you juniors to fully comprehend. Rather, it was to broaden your horizons and temper your Dao hearts."  

"Merely remembering this experience and nurturing your aspiration for the Dao is already commendable."  

Han Yue nodded in agreement. The True Master's Dao was profound, his power unfathomable—it only made Han Yue more eager to begin refining his qi.  

Li Changle continued,  

"With the three-year agreement now in place, how has your cultivation progressed?"  

"Reporting to Master, these past three years have been fruitful. Not only have I mastered the divine art granted upon entry, but I have also studied several secret scriptures, greatly expanding my knowledge."  

"However, while my foundational cultivation has improved, my progress has reached a bottleneck."  

Li Changle smiled and said,  

"I have already prepared what you need."  

"Having witnessed the True Master summoning the storm today, you should understand that we thunder cultivators draw upon the heavens, nature, wind, rain, and lightning as the foundation of our practice."  

"Our Divine Thunder Palace possesses a secret technique, reserved for Golden Core cultivators, that harnesses natural lightning to temper the body—the *Thunder Summoning Art*!"  

"This art draws upon the primal energy within thunderstorms, drastically accelerating the accumulation of mana. It is especially effective for second-tier cultivators refining their Golden Cores."  

"However, for those still in the Body Refinement stage, this technique is tantamount to suicide."  

"Our Luzhou is plagued by endless storms and calamities. Carelessly summoning lightning without sufficient strength would result in either death or severe injury."  

"But you have already cultivated the *Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Art* to perfection twice and forged a Dao-bearing artifact."  

"Even if you use the *Thunder Summoning Art*, it won’t kill you—at worst, you’ll be half-dead and grievously wounded."  

"Yet, with your *Nectar* divine ability, your injuries will heal swiftly."  

"Through this cycle, you can rapidly accumulate vast amounts of mana while tempering your body. It will also aid in refining your artifacts and divine abilities."  

"At most, you’ll suffer some pain—hardly a significant price."  

"With this technique, you can swiftly advance toward qi refinement!"  

"I have already secured it for you. Study it carefully, then descend the mountain."  

"Our Luzhou’s vast lands are filled with storms and lightning—all awaiting your summons to nourish your cultivation!"
