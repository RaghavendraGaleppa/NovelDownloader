# Chapter 1: The Hundred Lives Book

The Demonic Sect, Primal Saint Sect.

Layers of cloud sea raged like angry waves, and countless peaks, each a breathtaking sight, dotted the landscape like islands in the clouds, scattered like pieces on a chessboard.

At the outermost edge of this chessboard stood a mountain noticeably shorter than the others, as if its peak had been cleanly sliced off, leaving behind a vast flat expanse. On this flat summit, flying boats landed and departed, and newly inducted registered disciples stood in a neat line.

Lu Yang was one of them.

He had just transmigrated, opening his eyes to find himself in this very place. The residual memories in his body told him that his current situation seemed far from ideal.

According to the original body's memories, a nation named "Chen" was under the rule of the Primal Saint Sect.

Every three years, the Chen Kingdom would send a batch of registered disciples to the Primal Saint Sect, and in return, the Primal Saint Sect would ensure good weather and a stable imperial family for Chen.

At first glance, this seemed like a grand opportunity to join an Immortal Sect and achieve longevity and eternal life.

However, in reality, not a single dignitary or noble from the Chen Kingdom was willing to come. Only commoners like Lu Yang were sent, treated as "blood offerings."

After all, thousands of registered disciples were sent to the Primal Saint Sect every three years, yet the number of official disciples of the Primal Saint Sect never significantly increased. Only the registered disciples vanished one after another without a trace, as if they weren't entering a sacred cultivation ground, but a bottomless abyss.

Just thinking about it was enough to send shivers down one's spine.

"No wonder I'm so weak, feel like my body's been hollowed out..."

Lu Yang pinched his arm. It was all soft flesh, not a single firm spot. The discomfort grew. As he tried to stand, a sharp pain shot through his chest.

"The original body seemed to have a disease, and this disease is... damn it!"

Lu Yang cursed a few more times. It wasn't just weakness; he was terminally ill, with only a few days left to live.

Just as Lu Yang despaired, believing he was about to meet his end quickly right after transmigrating, a tiny speck of light suddenly appeared before his eyes. It then expanded explosively against the wind, growing into a screen at a visible speed!

[Name: Lu Yang]
[Lifespan: 18]
[Cultivation: None]
[Talent: None]
[Cultivation Method: None]
[Divine Ability: None]
[Treasure: None]

At this moment, Lu Yang looked at the system interface before him and suddenly felt like crying. Didn't they say heaven never bars one's way? As long as he wanted to walk, the path was right beneath his feet!

System, give me stats!

Then, Lu Yang froze.

He searched high and low, flipped through every menu, but couldn't find the plus sign he craved so desperately in the skill section. There wasn't even a minus sign.

"No, System, where are my stat points?"

After searching for a long time, Lu Yang had to despairingly admit a fact: the personal panel before him seemed to lack any stat-adding function.

In other words, if he wanted to improve, he had to rely on his own efforts.

Lu Yang: "..."

Damn it, System! Before I awakened you, you wanted me to work hard. Now that I've awakened you, you still want me to work hard? Then what was the point of awakening you?!

System, damn you—

[Current Hundred Lives Book Pages Remaining: 100]
[Hundred Lives Book: After death, you can return to the initial starting point and begin a new life.]
[After restarting, you can choose one of the following from your previous life: treasure, cultivation, or lifespan. Alternatively, you can relinquish all gains from your previous life to awaken a talent.]

Father, it's alright now.

Lu Yang suddenly grew excited. A hundred lives of reincarnation, what an immense fortune! If he could utilize it well, it could completely help him soar to the heavens!

"Those whose names are called, step forward."

Just then, a sinister black-robed Daoist appeared before the crowd. He held a roster in his hand, and a candelabra floated beside him.

"Drip your blood into the life lamp beside me, ignite the life flame, and from now on, you will be registered disciples of my Primal Saint Sect."

Upon hearing these words, no one present showed any joy.

This was because most of those sent here had heard of the Primal Saint Sect's dreaded reputation and knew that being a "registered disciple" was a misfortune, not a blessing.

However, the black-robed Daoist paid no heed to their thoughts, simply calling out names one by one.

"Chen Liang."

"Present!"

As the black-robed Daoist called out a name, a young Daoist boy with rosy lips and white teeth beside Lu Yang stood up and skipped to the Daoist's front.

This young boy was incredibly handsome, with bright eyes that seemed to speak. Most importantly, there was a spiritual aura between his brows that even mortals could discern. Judging by his expression and demeanor, he was intelligent and precocious; in the mortal world, he would undoubtedly be a promising scholar sought after by various academies.

As expected, the black-robed Daoist revealed a look of surprise and admiration:

"What an Innate Spiritual Child!"

"Daoist Brother overpraises me," the young boy respectfully bowed. Paired with his tender child's voice, it involuntarily evoked goodwill.

The black-robed Daoist's smile broadened.

"Excellent, excellent! My Primal Saint Sect needs talents like you!"

As his voice fell, the black-robed Daoist casually made a light stroke on the roster, crossing out Chen Liang's name.

*Thud!*

The next second, without any warning, the young Daoist boy, who had been full of spiritual energy, suddenly rolled his eyes upwards, collapsed to the ground, and instantly lost all signs of life.

Having done all this, the black-robed Daoist casually ordered:

"Send the blood and flesh to the Pill Refining Hall, the bones and souls to the Artifact Forging Hall, and the internal organs to the Beast Taming Hall. Don't waste such excellent talent."

These few words left the group of registered disciples dumbfounded.

The black-robed Daoist cackled at their reaction. "Fellow junior brothers, do not misunderstand."

"The Saint Sect always values 'worth.' Therefore, to measure whether a disciple is excellent or not is solely based on whether they can create enough value for the Saint Sect."

"That junior brother just now, an Innate Spiritual Child with strong bones and muscles, could only create the greatest value for the Saint Sect after his death, which is why he died."

"As for you junior brothers, your aptitudes are mediocre. You can only create value for the Saint Sect while alive, so naturally, you don't need to worry about such things."

"Next."

The black-robed Daoist continued to call out names. The crowd below was terrified but had no choice but to comply, fearing they would follow in the young boy's footsteps and have their lives crossed out too.

"Lu Yang."

"Present."

Lu Yang responded and stepped forward, his expression respectful.

The black-robed Daoist's gaze immediately fell upon Lu Yang's handsome and refined face. First, a look of delight appeared, then he began to examine his bones and muscles.

However, he quickly shook his head in disappointment.

Evidently, in his eyes, Lu Yang was useless apart from his good looks.

"Go to the Joyous Union Hall."

Lu Yang didn't dare ask any more questions, quickly saying, "Yes."

After the allocation, Lu Yang received a jade token. The token was almost transparent, with his name carved on it, and it seemed to contain a sealed flame within.

Besides that, he also received a cultivation method.

The cultivation method was called "Grand Ode of Yin-Yang Pleasure," which was the technique of the Joyous Union Hall, the place Lu Yang had been assigned to. It was said that one could cultivate True Qi and step into the Qi Refining Realm with it.

The old attendant leading the way spoke casually as he guided them, "The life token contains your life flame. Remember to carry it with you at all times. The Saint Sect's formations, spiritual plants, and spiritual beasts only recognize the token, not the person. If you forget to bring it out one day and die in the Saint Sect, don't blame me for not warning you."

Before long, the group was led to a grand hall.

In front of the hall stood a voluptuous beauty wearing a long dress with slits reaching her upper thighs. Her every glance was vibrant with allure, exquisitely charming.

"Gulp..."

Lu Yang clearly heard someone beside him swallow.

Seeing everyone's gazes, the beauty was not shy at all. Instead, she chuckled lightly while gracefully lifting a corner of her skirt at her side with a delicate hand.

Beneath the skirt, a jade token was conspicuously hanging.

The name on the token: Yu Suzhen.

"This is the Joyous Union Hall. This humble one, Yu Suzhen, can be considered everyone's senior sister."

The next second, Lu Yang noticed Yu Suzhen's eyes subtly brighten, and her gaze landed directly on him, staring without any pretense.

"This junior brother is so handsome, he must be a disciple of my Joyous Union Hall."

Yu Suzhen chuckled, then twisted her lithe, snakelike waist, her skirt swaying with each step as she walked towards Lu Yang. The sight of her fair skin dazzled Lu Yang, making him dizzy.

"I see you have good looks. Come with me, I'll introduce you to the situation in the Joyous Union Hall."

Lu Yang quickly cupped his hands and said, "Thank you, Senior Sister Yu."

"Why be so polite?"

Yu Suzhen charmingly rolled her eyes at Lu Yang, then turned and swayed her snakelike waist, igniting a surge of desire in the surrounding onlookers.

Lu Yang, however, dared not look too much and silently followed.

"My Saint Sect disciples are divided into inner and outer. The Four Outer Halls—Artifact Forging, Pill Refining, Beast Taming, and Joyous Union—are where you registered disciples will go."

"Only by passing the trials of the Four Outer Halls can you enter the inner sect, receive true inheritance, and become an official disciple."

"You're quite lucky to enter my Joyous Union Hall. You won't have to suffer like those in the other three halls, as the trials in my Joyous Union Hall are much easier..."

At this point, Yu Suzhen suddenly leaned closer to Lu Yang.

"Do you want to know what it is?"

The next second, Lu Yang felt a hot breath on his earlobe, and a fragrant scent wafted to his nose. Turning his head, a delicate, pretty face was inches away.

"Please enlighten me, Senior Sister," Lu Yang said, raising his head.

"It's cultivation."

Her tender voice whispered in his ear, like a lover's soft murmur.

Lu Yang instantly drew a sharp breath.
