Chapter 62: Azure Blood Divine Sword!

Time passed quickly. Zhou Tian finally finished gnawing on the pig's trotters in his hand, letting out a satisfied burp and a comfortable groan that drew glances from the crowd. Li Lingyi’s lips moved, seemingly wanting to reprimand him, but in the end, he said nothing.

Scenes in the mirror flashed by from time to time, with battles constantly unfolding. Zhou Xunchuan and Zhou Zui's figures also appeared. Although these few usually seemed a bit casual, in battle, their methods were ruthless and they showed no mercy. Whether it was Zhou Xunchuan's unmatched Dragon Fist, or Li Xuanyi's sword energy that could almost split the sky, Liu Yan's scorching golden flames made opponents tremble with fear, and Zhang Yi's method of using heaven and earth as a chessboard with all beings as pieces prevented opponents from even seeing his face.

As the top Heaven's Chosen of Tianqin, they lived up to their reputation. Not a single one was eliminated, and the fifty names floating above the mirror constantly extinguished. Soon, only about twenty remained.

At this number, the rate at which names extinguished gradually slowed. Everyone remaining was very strong, and each battle required the most brutal struggle.

Among them, the most astonishing was undoubtedly the Banished Immortal. Because this name was first on that unreliable ranking list and was praised very highly, Zhou Tian had a quite deep impression of him.

This person indeed had a touch of "immortal" aura. Dressed in white robes, his face was as exquisite as jade, exceptionally handsome. Silver hair flowed down to his waist, and his eyes sparkled like stars. Just standing there, a Dao charm seemed to flow around him.

"It is said that the Banished Immortal is a great figure from the ancient Futian Realm, returned against the heavens. Does Tianqin know anything about this?" Zhikong, from Luotian Temple, asked with an implied meaning. Buddhism inherently harbored deep resentment towards reincarnation, but there were almost no records of people who truly returned through reincarnation. Therefore, any shred of news made them flock like sharks scenting blood.

"Those are all baseless rumors. Does Master Zhikong believe such things?" Prime Minister Liu said with a chuckle.

"A great figure returned against the heavens?" Zhou Tian peeled open the skin of a strange fruit in his hand, placing the jade-like lustrous fruit into his mouth. Hearing the two old foxes speaking evasively here, he couldn't help but ponder inwardly. He seemed to recall that the unreliable ranking list, whose information was provided by fools, also had information regarding this. Moreover, this Banished Immortal had been famous in Tianqin for a long time. As a rogue cultivator, no one tried to recruit him, and Tianqin had always remained calmly observant, turning a blind eye. The information revealed here was indeed worth pondering.

"Heh heh..." Hearing what Prime Minister Liu said, Zhikong gave two perfunctory laughs and cast his gaze back to the mirror. What was currently shown was the scene of the Banished Immortal and Zixu confronting each other. Zhikong brought up this topic precisely because he had seen the Banished Immortal.

The Banished Immortal was expressionless, silver hair like a waterfall, eyes sparkling, and the corners of his robes gently fluttering. He was incomparably transcendent, emitting a soft glow all over his body, untainted by a speck of mortal dust. His entire being exuded an unparalleled demeanor.

Zixu, hundreds of feet away, frowned slightly. His entire demeanor seemed a bit off. He had heard of the Banished Immortal's name before, originally thinking it was just exaggerated rumors. He hadn't expected that upon seeing the person, he'd discover the rumors were indeed inaccurate—not because they were exaggerated, rather, they failed to fully capture his true power. Although the Banished Immortal was merely standing there, an inexplicable pressure had already enveloped him. He felt as if he was being stared at by an ancient ferocious beast.

Suddenly, the Banished Immortal moved. With a wave of his sleeve, a mighty celestial wind surged, and the entire world dimmed. A dark, fierce wind was blown forth, capable of shattering bones and splitting spirits. This was the Grand Yin Astral Wind. It was merely a casual probing strike, yet it produced such a terrifying phenomenon, fully displaying his invincible demeanor.

Zixu also moved, his gaze cold. Although he could sense the Banished Immortal's great strength, as a Heaven's Chosen of the same generation, facing an opponent of similar level, fear was an impossible emotion. He pointed with his hand, and innumerable towering ancient trees appeared in the void, green light obscuring the sky. The ancient trees absorbed the vital essence of plants, instantly growing to confront the Yin wind. He came from the Heavenly Court of Daluo Academy, which had never dropped out of the top five in Daluo Academy. He was especially proficient in the Five Elements secret arts; this was a wood-attribute technique.

Rumble! Heaven and earth trembled. The Yin wind assailed the towering ancient trees, which shook incessantly, gradually melting like ice under the summer sun. But the surroundings were all forest, and more vital energy of plants and trees gathered, blocking the Grand Yin Divine Wind.

The Banished Immortal showed no joy or sorrow on his face. It was merely a probing move, and he had no intention of achieving a feat. His figure moved lightly, his white robes gracing the world.

Boom!

A jade-like palm stretched out. With this strike, his palm and fingers glowed, and six blazing great suns appeared in the sky, bearing boundless crimson flames that pressed down. He had learned a great deal, mastering many divine abilities and profound mysteries. This was the Five Yang Palm, a palm technique of extreme Yang and rigidity, originally only able to manifest five Yangs, but he broke through the limit to evolve "Six Yangs."

Zixu likewise unleashed a palm strike. Over ten thousand li of clear sky, black rain suddenly fell. Thunder rumbled, as if pillars supporting the sky had collapsed. The momentum was immense. This was the Covering Rain Hand, a type of water technique, perfectly suited to counter the divine palm of extreme Yang and rigidity!

Boom!

A loud bang erupted between heaven and earth, like a star exploding, causing immense destructive power. Clouds and mist surged, heavy rain poured down, and the blazing sun glowed, dazzling people's eyes. This was a clash of two divine abilities.

Before the clouds and mist dispersed, a loud shout came:

"Azure Blood Divine Sword!"

A divine sword that pierced through heaven and earth appeared, as tall as a mountain peak, emitting a shimmering radiance. Countless scriptures coiled around it, and the sound of various sages chanting resounded. Zixu's body merged with the divine sword. The divine sword's green hue became even more intense, and boundless might pressed down on the Banished Immortal.

The Banished Immortal frowned slightly, his handsome face pristine and flawless. As he raised his hand, his five fingers formed a claw seal, and a massive dragon surged forth.

"Dragon Seal!" Fu Ge exclaimed in surprise. The tactical eyepiece on his left eye glowed, connected to his personal AI. Although it was just a single move, it was still analyzed. This was a famous divine ability, renowned in ancient times. But he exclaimed because the person who used it in ancient times was even more terrifying. Could the Banished Immortal be...

He turned to look at Qin Emperor on the high seat. Qin Emperor watched the scene calmly, showing nothing.

Although Zixu didn't recognize this ancient grand divine ability, he could still feel the might of this move. But with the arrow on the bowstring, it had to be loosed. Gritting his teeth, the divine sword swung, slicing through space as it cut down. The great dragon let out a roar, its eyes shining brightly, not appearing illusory. It coiled around the divine sword. Zixu's eyes were a watery green, and blood-red light burst from his chest. The divine sword became even more solid as streams of bloody color surged onto it!

The Banished Immortal's palm and fingers shifted, successively forming three seals. The great dragon, whose scales seemed substantial, erupted with endless runes. Its body intertwined around the divine sword, its dragon head roaring towards the sky, shaking the void.

Cracking sounds came as cracks extended across the Azure Blood Divine Sword. With the last dragon roar, the divine sword shattered!

As the dust settled, Zixu's figure disappeared. He had already been eliminated. Another name extinguished among the remaining ones.

The Banished Immortal showed no expression of joy. His white robes were like snow. He looked up, as if he had discovered being spied upon, then lightly stepped into the void and departed.
