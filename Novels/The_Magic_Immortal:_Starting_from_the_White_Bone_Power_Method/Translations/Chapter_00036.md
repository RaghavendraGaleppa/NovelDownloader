# Chapter 36: Ruthless Slaughter!

Seeing Wang Chan remain calm, the green-robed female cultivator wasted no time. With a light pat on her storage pouch, she summoned three gleaming yellow flying daggers. 

The daggers materialized like butterflies flitting through flowers—one larger and thicker, the other two slender as cicada wings. She swiftly formed hand seals and directed them toward the larger dagger. With two sharp whistles, beams of yellow light shot out and merged with the two smaller daggers, which then streaked toward the bald and lecherous cultivators, trailing golden arcs.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

In an instant, the agile and razor-sharp daggers suppressed the two men, leaving them no room to counterattack.  

"A set of mother-child daggers—quite intricate," Wang Chan mused, his eyes gleaming with interest. "Though only low-grade, they've been refined to perfection with twenty-seven layers of weapon restrictions. They must be exceptionally handy in battle."  

No wonder the green-robed woman dared to intervene and even challenge two opponents alone. Despite being only at the early Qi Refinement stage, her magical tools were exquisite. With just this set of daggers, she could overpower the two men.  

For most ordinary mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, their best equipment typically consisted of low-grade magical tools and spells—like the bald cultivator. Whether these spells or tools reached their full potential depended on time and opportunity. At most, they might possess a few mid-grade talismans as trump cards.  

Those who wielded mid-grade magical tools or could cast mid-grade spells were usually elite among mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators—true experts among rogue cultivators.  

After all, mastering spells was difficult. Without talent, one could spend a lifetime without grasping even the basics. Refining magical tools was equally arduous—without time and rare materials, progress was impossible. Many Qi Refinement cultivators could only refine a single low-grade tool to its peak in their entire lives.  

Of course, exceptions existed.  

A Qi Refinement novice might suddenly pull out a top-grade magical tool, catching even a late-stage cultivator off guard and sealing their fate—though such occurrences were rare.  

Still, observing a little longer wouldn’t hurt.  

Better safe than sorry.  

This was why Wang Chan had yet to act.  

Seeing the bald duo completely overwhelmed, it seemed the perfect time to intervene. Yet, the green-robed woman didn’t recklessly charge forward. Instead, she slapped a mid-grade protective talisman on herself, conjuring another cyan barrier.  

*She even has mid-grade talismans?*  

Her wealth was clearly substantial.  

Only after ensuring her own safety did she command the larger flying dagger to rescue the bound, voluptuous woman.  

---

Just as it seemed the situation was resolved, something unexpected happened.  

The voluptuous woman, seemingly freed, suddenly broke her restraints. Taking advantage of the green-robed woman’s distraction, she unleashed three mid-grade Golden Sword Talismans from behind.  

*Ssshh! Ssshh! Ssshh!*  

Three golden sword phantoms erupted, their mid-grade offensive power shattering the green-robed woman’s protective barriers in quick succession.  

Luckily, the green-robed woman’s garment was a low-grade defensive robe, sparing her from being bisected by the third sword’s residual force.  

Undeterred by the failed ambush, the voluptuous woman spat out a dark-red needle aimed straight at the green-robed woman’s forehead.  

Though the latter dodged sideways, the needle curved mid-flight and pierced her left eye.  

"Ahh!"  

Screaming in agony, the green-robed woman clutched her bleeding eye with one hand while slashing at her attacker with the larger dagger.  

Seizing the moment, she retreated toward the mountain path, backing against the cliff face with nowhere left to run. Desperate, she fumbled for a last-resort item in her storage pouch.  

But then—  

A mouthful of black blood spewed from her lips as she collapsed.  

In seconds, tendrils of dark energy spread from her ruined eye, engulfing her body in an icy, lethal poison.  

Meanwhile, the voluptuous woman dodged the flying dagger’s strike, slapping another mid-grade protective talisman on herself just in time to block the attack.  

Without its master’s control, the three daggers clattered to the ground, swiftly scooped up by the bald cultivator and his companions.  

Wang Chan was taken aback.  

The real threat hadn’t been the bald man or the lecher—it was the seemingly helpless, naked woman covered in blood. Her deception was ruthless.  

Seizing the opportunity, the trio charged at the poisoned green-robed woman.  

But unlike before, they now brandished mid-grade defensive talismans and offensive spells—proof they had been holding back earlier.  

"Slash!"  

The bald man’s mid-grade Silver Sword Talisman transformed into a gleaming blade, hurtling toward the green-robed woman with a piercing shriek.  

Just as it seemed she would be cleaved in half, a white jade pendant around her neck flared to life, erecting a luminous barrier that repelled the sword.  

"A mid-grade defensive artifact!" The bald man’s eyes gleamed with greed. "Keep attacking with low-grade tools! Don’t hold back—this barrier won’t last!"  

His companions needed no urging. They relentlessly hammered the barrier with a red trident and the dark-red needle, their strikes ringing like a blacksmith’s anvil.  

The bald man, however, remained still, locking eyes with Wang Chan in a silent standoff.  

"These three work flawlessly together—no openings," Wang Chan noted inwardly.  

Trapped inside the barrier, the green-robed woman—once confident—now trembled in terror, pleading like a child begging an abusive parent for mercy.  

But greed had blinded her attackers. Their cold sneers showed no hint of relenting.  

Realizing her fate, the woman’s remaining eye darted toward Wang Chan.  

"Friend! I am Wei Jing, a direct descendant of the Wei Clan! Flee now! If you escape, inform my mother—a Foundation Establishment cultivator! She will hunt these wretches to the ends of the earth and burn their bones to ash!"  

Her words made the attackers pause, their gazes snapping toward Wang Chan with murderous intent.  

*The Wei Clan?*  

Wang Chan smirked.  

The Wei Clan was a recently relocated Foundation Establishment family from Blackwater City, rivaling the Bai Clan in strength.  

The green-robed woman’s "warning" was no kindness—it was a ploy to divert attention and buy time. If Wang Chan escaped and informed the Wei Clan, the trio would face certain doom.  

Thus, whether her claim was true or not, they couldn’t afford to let him leave.  

Fortunately, after observing the battle, Wang Chan had gauged their strength.  

*Not a threat.*  

"Bitch," he cursed inwardly.  

No longer idle, he surged with energy.  

With a flick of his sleeves, two white needles shot forth, crackling with lightning.  

Simultaneously, a colossal dragon-tiger phantom erupted from his body, its crimson aura condensing into dark, serpentine patterns that coiled across his skin.  

*Boom!*  

His foot stamped the ground, leaving a crater as he blurred forward.  

The trio barely registered the needles before they pierced their mid-grade barriers.  

*Thud! Thud!*  

The bald man and the lecherous cultivator’s heads exploded into crimson mist, their decapitated bodies crumpling.  

"Big Bro! Second Bro!" the voluptuous woman shrieked, but before she could react, an invisible force hurled her into the cliffside.  

*Crash!*  

Rocks shattered as she rebounded—only to meet a black fist that shattered her barrier and pulverized her body.  

The entire sequence lasted mere seconds.  

By the time the green-robed woman processed it, Wang Chan was already collecting three bloodied storage pouches.  

"Why?!" she screamed, her voice trembling between fear and fury. "Why didn’t you help earlier?! If you had, I wouldn’t be like this! You monster!"  

Wang Chan stared coldly.  

"I don’t understand. You whimpered and begged before those three like a bitch in heat. Yet now you dare yell at *me*?"  

"You—you’re not here to save me?"  

*Crack!*  

The jade barrier shattered.  

*Splat!*  

Another burst of crimson.  

The wind carried away the mist as Wang Chan indifferently gathered the remaining storage pouches, the jade pendant, and the tattered green robe.  

After a thorough sweep of the area to ensure no witnesses, he purified the scene with a mid-grade Purification Talisman.  

"Effective, but expensive," he muttered, wincing at the cost.  

With a final mid-grade Concealment Talisman, he vanished into the wilderness.  

An hour later, after confirming no pursuers, Wang Chan finally exhaled and slipped away unnoticed.
