# Chapter 60: Riding the Golden Eagle  

The *Shangdong Jiuxiao Refining Spiritual Treasure Secret Record* began by detailing two major systems of secret magical artifacts passed down by the Shenxiao Palace.  

These two systems encompassed a wide variety of magical artifacts, all perfectly aligned with the longevity inheritance of the Shenxiao Palace!  

The first system was called the **Shangdong True Thunder Lineage**.  

This lineage contained the Shenxiao Palace's most powerful offensive magical artifacts.  

The foundational materials for crafting the entire lineage were similar—all forged from third-tier metals and ores.  

Then, atop different bases, they were refined using the secret *Shangdong True Thunder Law-Breaking True Runes* passed down by the Shenxiao Palace.  

The lineage included ten forms of magical artifacts: sabers, spears, swords, halberds, axes, battle-axes, hooks, forks, chains, and hammers.  

The materials and methods for crafting each form were largely similar, and their effects were fundamentally the same, with only slight variations based on the artifact's form.  

**Magical Artifact:** *Shangdong True Thunder Lineage*  
**Function:** *Unparalleled in offense, greatly enhances the effects of compatible divine abilities. When cultivated alongside the Shenxiao Palace's three major thunder techniques, it provides additional boosts to cultivation speed and divine ability potency.*  

The second lineage was called the **Jiuxiao Refining Dao Lineage**.  

This lineage complemented the *Shangdong True Thunder Lineage*, containing the Shenxiao Palace's most advanced protective and refining artifacts.  

Similarly, they were forged from third-tier metals as their base and shaped accordingly.  

They were then refined using the *Jiuxiao Refining Dao Guardian True Runes*.  

The *Jiuxiao Refining Dao Lineage* included ten forms of magical artifacts: seals, conches, bells, cauldrons, zithers, pots, brushes, robes, crowns, and ruyi scepters.  

Just these two lineages alone left Han Yue dazzled!  

The artifacts in these lineages primarily relied on third-tier metals as their core materials, refined through secret techniques.  

Fortunately, the two third-tier treasures Han Yue currently possessed could be used—saving him a great deal of trouble!  

He wouldn’t need to exchange for other third-tier materials!  

Although the *Shangdong Jiuxiao Refining Spiritual Treasure Secret Record* contained dozens of other powerful artifacts outside these lineages, the twenty artifacts from the two lineages—for which he already had the main materials—were more than enough for Han Yue to choose a suitable Dao-bearing artifact!  

Naturally, Han Yue wouldn’t pass up this most efficient option.  

He planned to consult his master carefully, make a prudent choice for his Dao-bearing artifact, and begin refining it as soon as possible!  

For cultivators, the earlier they refined their Dao-bearing artifact, the greater the advantage they could accumulate.  

Suddenly, Han Yue felt that his time was far from enough. These high-quality inheritances would require immense time and effort to study and cultivate.  

---  

As Han Yue pondered these new inheritances, he flew toward the agreed-upon meeting place.  

But when he arrived, the sight before him left him stunned.  

His master, the Daoist Tianyun, Li Changle, was seated atop the back of a massive golden eagle, meditating with his eyes closed.  

Even from a distance, Li Changle sensed Han Yue’s approach and opened his eyes, beckoning him over.  

Cautiously, Han Yue stepped onto the golden eagle’s back.  

This eagle was at least a third-tier demonic beast—Han Yue could feel the immense magical power radiating from the magnificent creature beneath his feet!  

A thick lightning chain was wrapped around the eagle’s neck, suppressing it so thoroughly that it dared not move recklessly.  

Seeing Han Yue return, Li Changle asked,  

"Disciple, have you settled your affairs?"  

"Yes, Master. I’ve bid farewell to my friends and am ready to depart at any time!"  

"Good. I captured this golden eagle nearby to serve as our mount for now."  

With that, Li Changle manipulated the lightning chain, and the golden eagle obediently took flight!  

The eagle’s massive body provided a surprisingly stable ride for Han Yue.  

Its speed was astonishing—in the blink of an eye, they soared high into the sky, heading southwest.  

Li Changle handed the other end of the chain to Han Yue.  

Though it was a magical construct formed by Li Changle’s divine ability, the chain felt solid and unyielding in Han Yue’s grip.  

Li Changle instructed,  

"Control the eagle and keep it flying straight in the direction I indicate. Don’t let it deviate secretly."  

"Before we return to the sect, I need to retrieve something. This eagle is fast enough—it shouldn’t take too long."  

With that, he prepared to close his eyes and meditate.  

But this was Han Yue’s first time being so close to such a powerful demonic beast, and he couldn’t help but feel nervous.  

After all, he had recently witnessed the immense power of two demonic saint descendants, giving him a deep understanding of third-tier demonic beasts’ strength.  

He couldn’t resist asking,  

"Master, my cultivation is still weak. I fear I won’t be able to control this golden eagle. If it breaks free, you’ll have to expend effort suppressing it again."  

Li Changle replied,  

"Yuanchu, don’t worry. Though this eagle’s magical power seems impressive, its foundation is weak. Its inherited divine abilities are nothing special—it’s nowhere near the level of that old turtle you encountered before."  

"Disciple, now that you’ve entered my tutelage, once you return to the sect, obtain the great inheritance, and master a few of the Shenxiao Palace’s divine abilities, you’ll naturally stand at the pinnacle of your peers in the *Jade Sky Realm*."  

"Sooner or later, you’ll need to view the world with a higher perspective."  

---  

"Take this golden eagle, for example. Though its realm is high and its magical power is strong, it lacks formidable divine abilities and a powerful Dao-bearing artifact. Its actual combat potential is quite limited—to elite disciples of major sects like us, it poses no threat at all!"  

"Understood, Master. I once had a friend from the Beast Taming Sect who taught me the four key factors in evaluating a cultivator’s strength: *techniques, methods, physique, and artifacts*."  

Han Yue grasped Li Changle’s meaning—this golden eagle lacked excellence in all four aspects.  

Among beings of the same tier, it was undoubtedly at the bottom in terms of strength, possibly even weaker than some second-tier prodigies.  

Li Changle nodded.  

"When magical power is similar, every divine ability you master can multiply your combat power. The stronger the divine ability, the greater the boost!"  

"On top of that, a Dao-bearing artifact that aligns with your inheritance and divine abilities can further enhance your strength, amplifying divine ability effects and accelerating cultivation—widening the gap between cultivators even more!"  

"Elite disciples of major sects like us possess complete divine abilities and formidable artifacts. It’s perfectly normal for us to be a hundred times stronger than ordinary foes of the same tier."  

"Once you return to the sect and study the inheritance in depth, you’ll understand this disparity clearly!"  

Reflecting on this, Han Yue realized the truth of his master’s words.  

Among second-tier cultivators, Luo Erjia and Yang Fan—disciples of major sects—could slaughter second-tier demonic beasts with ease, as effortlessly as cutting melons.  

Han Yue himself was no exception. With the powerful divine abilities granted by the *Myriad Techniques Compendium*, he could unleash astonishing combat power despite being only first-tier, effortlessly crushing ordinary second-tier demonic beasts and rogue cultivators who lacked proper inheritances.
