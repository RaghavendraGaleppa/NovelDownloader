Chapter 315: Finally Obtaining the Spirit Fox

Wen Caishang bid farewell to Fu Haoran and boarded the fragrant carriage. Her small, round face was as tender and smooth as a meat bun. Though petite in stature, she possessed considerable skill. With a delicate cry of "Giddy up," the carriage sped through the streets, leaving the Emerald Bamboo Residence. She asked innocently and curiously, "Madam, is that boy really his younger brother?"

Inside the carriage, Wen Caishang smoothed her double sleeves, folding them neatly over her knees. She sat with a dignified posture and said softly, "Yes."

Xiao Tuan asked, "Why didn't we capture him to use as leverage?" Wen Caishang replied, "Master Fu possesses fortune; one must act with propriety when dealing with him. To be so overbearing would be unseemly. If he were to come seeking justice, it would be very difficult to handle."

Scholars possess fortune. Fortune acts as a scale, weighing the righteousness of one's actions. If one is in the right, heaven lends its aid. Although Fu Haoran had been demoted and his fortune was not as strong as in years past, his knowledge was profound, and he was respected by others. Wen Caishang was unwilling to go to extremes.

Wen Caishang said, "Besides, I sincerely wish to learn from him. This opportunity is rare." This was the truth. She thought to herself, "Why bother capturing him? As long as I know where he is, he is within the palm of my hand. That thief, though cunning, is quite sentimental. If he weren't, he wouldn't have... Hmph. His lifeline is in my grasp. Let's see if he can still make waves. Hmph!"

Meanwhile, elsewhere...

In the Snow Dragon Mountain Range.

Gu Nianjun and Li Xian had agreed to cooperate, temporarily setting aside their past grievances. It was early morning, so they traveled together to hunt the Spirit Fox. They walked side by side, exchanging names. Gu Nianjun honestly gave her real name, while Li Xian used the alias 'Zhou Ping'an,' meaning "Safe and Sound."

The Snow Dragon Mountain Range was vast and boundless, with varied terrain. Because it was covered in snow and ice year-round, the true features of the mountains. N N....,....... N..,... N,. N, N..,.

.,,,,.,, ',,,,..",... Li,, Li ',.... ',,,,,...,,,,,.... Li,,,,,,,,,...,...,,,,...,,,.",,,,, Gu Nianjun held the map and led the way. Li Xian followed behind. They left the dense forest and turned east, walking about fifteen to sixteen miles until they saw a small stream flowing down from the high mountains.

Gu Nianjun had Li Xian keep a distance of over a dozen zhang. She spread out the map again, compared the terrain, and planned the route before waving for Li Xian to follow. They followed the stream upstream, winding and twisting for a while.

As noon approached, the wind and snow gradually subsided, and the warm sun slanted down, creating perfect weather. Gu Nianjun was in high spirits, gazing at the snowy scenery from afar and occasionally comparing it to the map.

The Beast Offering Terrace was located above a canyon. Here, the snow had inexplicably melted, revealing brown earth over a vast area, forming a natural platform. Gu Nianjun's temples were damp with sweat. She was dressed lightly and didn't feel the cold, but after walking dozens of miles along the mountain paths, it was inevitable that she would sweat. Snowflakes drifted into her inner garments, making her feel slightly embarrassed.

Upon reaching the Beast Offering Terrace, she said, "Let's search around. Someone once witnessed the tracks of a Snow Mountain Spirit Fox here."

Li Xian looked around and pondered, "The terrain here is indeed special. If I were to search on my own, it would take at least ten days to find it. This woman is indeed useful."

"I've had quite a few unpleasant interactions with her before. But right now, I'm 'Zhou Ping'an,' and she has come to help. There's no need to bring past emotions into this."

He cupped his hands and said sincerely, "Miss Gu, thank you!"

Gu Nianjun was delighted and said, "So you know how to thank me now? You weren't this polite when you were chasing me away just a moment ago." She thought to herself, "It was normal for him to be wary when we were strangers. Now that we've exchanged names and he's thanking me so sincerely, it shows that although he is proud, he is reasonable."

She secretly appraised him. As the cold wind blew, Li Xian's long hair fluttered, the tips frosted, adding a touch of uniqueness. He was elegant and refined. Though his face was hidden by a mask, his natural, ethereal aura was unmistakable.

She thought, "I wonder if he'll be willing to take off his mask when we get familiar later. His clothes are simple, but his figure and aura... have a unique charm. Among the many prodigies I've seen, it seems... none of them compare to him."

Li Xian asked, "What's wrong?"

Gu Nianjun's eyes held a strange light as she said淡淡ly, "Nothing. Let's catch the Spirit Fox quickly!"

The two separated to search. Gu Nianjun, holding the map, searched eastward. Li Xian searched westward. They each walked several miles, searching for nearly an hour. Li Xian suddenly turned back and patted Gu Nianjun. Gu Nianjun was just feeling puzzled.

Li Xian whispered, "Come with me." He took her hand and headed west. Gu Nianjun's pretty face flushed slightly as she hurried to follow. They reached a small hill, and Li Xian gestured for them to lie flat, then pointed into the distance.

Gu Nianjun exclaimed in surprise, "Winter Ghosts and Cold Storks!"

In the distance, in the snow, two groups of snow beasts were fighting to the death. The "Winter Ghost" had a wolf's body and a tiger's face, sharp fangs, and a silver-white body, with a blood sac hanging from its chest. The "Cold Stork" was small in size, fierce in temperament, with sharp claws and great strength.

The two兽群 were fighting for some unknown reason. Snow beasts are usually hard to find, but now they appeared in groups. This scene was truly rare.

Li Xian saw snow tigers, snow bears, snow leopards, snow apes... Although he didn't know their habits, they were similar to regular tigers, bears, leopards, and apes. Based on his hunting experience, they would be somewhat useful. But the snow beasts he saw now had very strange appearances, making his experience useless. So he asked directly, "What are the special characteristics of these two types of snow beasts?"

Gu Nianjun was also seeing them for the first time, but the map had records. The Winter Ghost is a strange beast. In windy and snowy weather, its fur flows as it runs, allowing it to blend into the wind and snow, appearing as if it vanishes. Hence its name. The "Cold Stork" is fierce in temperament and can kill snow tigers, rivaling snow bears. However, it is smaller, faster, and harder to hunt. It is a rare snow beast.

Gu Nianjun explained everything one by one and then said, "These two types of snow beasts are very rare. If we can hunt them, we can definitely make a small name for ourselves."

Li Xian said, "Fame is not as practical as money." Gu Nianjun said, "Money is also plentiful, but it's not quite the same right now."

Li Xian asked, "What do you mean?"

Gu Nianjun said, "The map records that Winter Ghosts and Cold Storks are solitary creatures. Now they are in兽群, and they are fighting each other. This indicates... a very powerful individual has been born among the Winter Ghosts. A very powerful individual has also been born among the Cold Storks. That's why they have united their respective兽群 and expanded their territories. If I'm not wrong, the territories of the two兽群 have conflicted, leading to this bloody battle."

Li Xian said, "Just like humans."

Gu Nianjun said, "These snow beasts that have become kings are extremely powerful. And they are united. If they围攻 us, even if we join forces, we will encounter trouble." When she said the word "trouble," her whole body was relaxed, as if she had nothing to fear. She deliberately exaggerated to警戒 Li Xian.

She continued:

"The snow beasts have immense strength, and their fur blends into the snow scenery. If dozens or hundreds of them围攻, even if we use martial arts, we will inevitably be busy defending, or we might get injured and bleed, or we might have to flee in a狼狈 manner. And it's said that when the Winter Ghost roars, it can cause avalanches and snowslides, which would be even more troublesome."

Li Xian frowned and thought, "Gu Nianjun's words are not wrong. Snow beasts are rare, but they are not the purpose of my trip. It's already noon. Why not look for the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox?" He was about to leave.

Gu Nianjun's eyes suddenly flashed as she said, "But there is a way to hunt the Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King without being围攻. If someone can shoot one arrow through both kings, the other snow beasts will be terrified and scatter, and they will never dare to围攻."

Li Xian said淡淡ly, "I'm not interested. I don't think there will be a Spirit Fox here. Let's go look elsewhere."

Gu Nianjun thought, "I've always heard rumors about how厉害 your archery is, but I've never seen it with my own eyes. Shooting down a flying arrow is enough to prove your archery is extraordinary. But it's still a bit lacking in charm. I need to find a way to make him shoot arrows at real snow beasts." She said, "You said you would teach me archery. This is a great opportunity. If you leave now, aren't you going back on your word?"

Li Xian frowned and asked, "What do you want to practice?" Gu Nianjun said, "I've never hunted a snow beast before. You kill the Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King, and the other兽群 will scatter. Then I'll try to hunt a snow beast. If I succeed, it means you are a great teacher who taught a good student, and you taught archery well. I will naturally do my best to help you."

"Besides, the mountain roads here are difficult to walk. I've been helping you,累得筋酸骨软. You should show some appreciation, right?"

Li Xian cursed inwardly, "This woman is probably 80% likely to want to hunt snow beasts to show off to her companions. It's normal for a noble lady from a noble family to like making friends. Sister Liu Li also has many friends in the江湖. It's fine to help her." He said, "If you want to hunt snow beasts, what's so difficult about that?"

Gu Nianjun was delighted and was about to watch closely, to witness Li Xian's hunting style up close, but she didn't see Li Xian draw his bow. Li Xian said, "You draw the bow. The Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King are for you to hunt."

Gu Nianjun said, "If I use martial arts, it's not difficult to kill them. But to kill them purely with archery, I'm far from able." Li Xian said, "I'll teach you. You just need to draw the bow."

Gu Nianjun was excited and didn't refuse. She immediately drew her bow to its full extent, full of heroic spirit. Li Xian blew a whistle. The Winter Ghost and Cold Stork groups noticed the movement here, and their bloody battle stopped instantly.

Li Xian activated "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." With a rumbling sound, several snow beasts' legs trembled, and they took a few steps back. But they were immediately clawed and bitten by the Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King. The two kings felt they had been provoked and let out waves of beastly roars.

Gu Nianjun remained calm and fearless, but she knew that purely with archery, it would be difficult to kill them. Suddenly, she heard the Winter Ghost King let out a high, cry. The Winter Ghost beasts charged forward rapidly. The Cold Stork King followed closely behind, making strange sounds. The Cold Stork group was already杀来.

Gu Nianjun seized the opportunity and shot at the Winter Ghost King. Three arrows were shot in a row, incredibly fast. The Winter Ghost King dodged to the side, but couldn't avoid them all, and was hit by two arrows. But its vitality was strong, and it showed no fear.

Li Xian said, "This beast is used to throwing its weight around. If you add your understanding of the Dao of martial arts to your archery and use your internal energy to assist, what's so difficult about killing it? It doesn't know it's courting death and still dares to charge."

Gu Nianjun said, "No matter how high its intelligence, it's still a beast. But Young Master Zhou, if I use only archery, I can't kill it."

Li Xian said, "Draw your bow again. I'll help you."

Gu Nianjun nocked an arrow and drew her bow, poised to strike. Li Xian placed his hand on the Silver Moon Bow. Gu Nianjun was slightly surprised and suddenly felt the momentum of the arrow change inexplicably, adding a sharp edge, and her spirit soared to the heavens. This inexplicable aura infected her heart, and she felt it was hard to describe. She felt as if she were a sword that had been dormant for over a decade, finally unsheathing itself now. She was joyous and excited. She had practiced hard for over a decade, just waiting for this moment to ride the winds and waves.

Li Xian adjusted the angle slightly and said, "Shoot!" Gu Nianjun released the string, and the arrow shot out with a whistling sound. The Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King were not low in intelligence and were suddenly startled. The two beasts panicked and fled, letting out mournful cries. In the end, they were just beasts. Even if they had special abilities, they were still beasts.

If the prodigies wanted to kill snow beasts, it wouldn't be difficult. They could use martial arts to capture or kill them. But if they used martial arts, it would inevitably seem as if they were losing their temper. It would show that their archery was poor and their minds were narrow. That's why, during last night's hunt hunt众众众 even empty empty,众 even "... even even they " even ". " " " " " " " ", " " ".. " " " the.,.., the, " " " "., "... ".... ", " "..,. the ",,..,.,...,..... the,..,.....,..,,.,.,.......,...........,,.. Gu Nianjun was overjoyed. This arrow felt incredibly satisfying, hard to describe. She felt even more admiration and admiration for Li Xian.

Gu Nianjun asked, "Young Master Zhou, how... how did you do that?" Li Xian laughed, "It's strange. You were the one who shot it. Why are you asking me how I did it?"

Gu Nianjun raised her eyebrows slightly and said, "Nianjun knows her own limits. With my archery alone, I might be able to hit it, but it would be difficult to kill it, let alone shoot two with one arrow. When you touched the bow, I felt everything was different. But how it was different, I can't say. Good young master, please enlighten me."

Li Xian said, "This is intent and energy. When intent and energy blend into the arrow, naturally, nothing is impossible, and the archery becomes transcendent." Gu Nianjun asked, "How do you blend intent and energy into the arrow?"

Li Xian said, "It's hard for me to put into words. You need to comprehend it yourself. If there's another chance, you can slowly experience it. Perhaps you'll understand something. If you can't, I can't help either. Archery is quite mysterious."

Gu Nianjun asked respectfully, "Then, Young Master Zhou, how did you cultivate such archery? Do you have a secret technique? Or did you have a famous teacher to guide you?" Li Xian said, "I practiced randomly and messily; it's not presentable. Perhaps it's a bit better than my peers'. If there's a secret technique, it's practicing hard every day, and letting nature take its course to achieve this level."

Upon hearing the words "letting nature take its course," Gu Nianjun knew that Li Xian's talent in the Dao of Archery was terrifyingly high. She admired him even more, but also felt a bit of regret that she hadn't seen Li Xian shoot. She continued, "But according to what Nianjun knows, even if one's archery is perfect, it's still incredibly difficult to have every arrow附着 with intent and energy. It depends on the situation, the mindset, and even more on luck and timing... You... Ai! You!"

As Gu Nianjun was speaking, Li Xian had already walked towards the Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King. Gu Nianjun stomped her foot in frustration, gritted her teeth, and glared at Li Xian with an angry pout. When had she ever been treated with such disdain? But she felt even more helpless. Her mood was tied to him, so she could only follow him with small steps.

"This Young Master Zhou is too negligent towards me. If it were someone else, I wouldn't bother. But he... he is indeed different. Fine, I'll just indulge him."

The Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King were both dead. Their blood was light blue, with a fishy yet fragrant scent. Li Xian confirmed that the two snow beasts were dead and asked, "How much are these two beasts worth?"

Gu Nianjun said, "Over a thousand taels. Snow beast kings are quite rare, so their value is much higher." Li Xian said, "Six for me, four for you. I want six hundred taels." Gu Nianjun said, "Okay. If you don't mind, I can help you sell them."

Li Xian's heart stirred: "That would be even better. I have no power, no influence, and no connections, so I'm always lowballed. This Gu Nianjun has quite a few connections; she can even get a map. It would indeed be good to have her help." He nodded and said, "Thank you. I must mention one thing. Please, Miss Gu, when you sell the snow beasts, it's best not to mention..."

He was about to say not to mention him, but stopped halfway. He suddenly thought that although snow beasts are precious, they are just exotic beasts. They are only difficult to kill because of the snowy mountain terrain. They are not heavenly materials or earthly treasures. Killing them purely with archery can indeed be called "厉害". But if not purely with archery, hunting, though difficult, is within the capabilities of a first-rate or second-rate martial artist... or a hunter who is well-prepared and sets traps. If he said not to mention his name now, it would be like saying "No silver here" when there is silver. Treating a trivial matter as a great achievement, as if he were something special.

He mocked himself with a smile and didn't say the rest.

Gu Nianjun's eyes flickered as she put the bodies of the Winter Ghost King and the Cold Stork King into a flesh-reducing bag. The two continued to search for the Spirit Fox. There were no clues on the Beast Offering Terrace. Seeing that the sky was getting late, they returned together.

They bid farewell several miles outside the city gate and agreed to meet again the next day.

Gu Nianjun watched Li Xian leave, then returned to the Emerald Bamboo Residence in a very good mood, her eyebrows filled with joy. She ran straight to the inner courtyard to greet Fu Haoran. In the inner courtyard, He Wentian, Zhou Shijie, and Li Xiaofan were all there, each holding a book and reading.

Zhou Shijie asked, "Nianjun, where did you go? You missed a treat for your ears today." Gu Nianjun didn't care and asked casually, "What treat?" Li Xiaofan said, "This morning, Madam Wang came here. She is very knowledgeable and appreciated the Master's paintings. She spoke wonderfully, and we all benefited greatly. That Madam Wang is so厉害 that even the Master praised her knowledge as vast as the sea."

He Wentian smiled and asked, "Yes. Miss Gu, I see you're in a good mood. How was your收获 today?"

Gu Nianjun laughed, "The harvest was ordinary, not worth mentioning. Nianjun will take her leave first. I've been walking on mountain roads all day and want to take a bath. Please excuse me." She turned and left.

Zhou Shijie found it very strange: "Based on Nianjun's性格, she should have asked about the paintings and the appreciation. Why is she so反常 today?" Li Xiaofan said, "I think Sister Gu's face is flushed with joy, just like when I found silver."

He Wentian laughed dumbfounded, "Miss Gu is both literary and martial, with considerable talent. Finding silver wouldn't make her this happy. Maybe she found a husband." Zhou Shijie's mind was wandering, unable to let go, but had nowhere to ask, so he had to keep it in his heart.

Gu Nianjun returned to her bedroom, took off her boots and cross-collared undershirt... and soaked her whole body in warm water, feeling her mind relax. Suddenly, she thought of something, got up to get her bow, and walked along, splashing warm water, leaving a trail of footprints. She pulled the bow without an arrow, recalling the feeling from earlier.

That feeling of her spirit soaring and her intent rushing to the heavens was hard to重现. She sighed softly, put the bow away, and returned to the bathtub to wash. But that scene lingered in her heart.

The ancestors of the Great Wu Dynasty started as "archers" and shot to create a prosperous dynasty. Great Wu valued both martial and literary arts, and also valued "archery." All noble families had winter and spring hunting activities.

Archery was both a technique for killing enemies and a technique of ritual and music.

Gu Nianjun had no more heart for washing. After changing her clothes, she immediately went out. Zhou Shijie was already waiting at the side door. Seeing Gu Nianjun's figure, he immediately went over and asked, "Nianjun, it's already dark. Where are you going?"

Gu Nianjun said, "I have something else to do." Zhou Shijie said, "I'll go with you." Gu Nianjun said, "As you wish."

They went straight to the "Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion" in Flying Dragon City. The pavilion was fourteen zhang high, with a tiger head hanging from the plaque. The Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion contained rare and exotic beasts and specialized in businesses related to "beasts." Gu Nianjun had broad knowledge and a remarkable aura, and soon a steward received her.

She was led to a tea room.

Gu Nianjun took out the bodies of the "Winter Ghost King" and "Cold Stork King" and stated her purpose, to exchange them for money. Zhou Shijie watched from the side. Seeing the two strange snow beasts, he was greatly surprised. He knew Gu Nianjun had gone hunting, but he didn't expect her to hunt snow beasts. He was full of doubts. The steward examined the beasts and made "tsk, tsk, tsk" sounds of admiration.

The steward said, "This young lady's archery is extraordinary. I haven't seen such a powerful archery in a long time."

Gu Nianjun said, "It's not worth mentioning. Please exchange them for money according to your pavilion's rules."

The steward became even more respectful and said, "Of course, of course. Our pavilion has rules. For ordinary snow beasts, if they are not huge in size, you can get over a hundred and fifty taels of silver. These two snow beasts are kings, very rare, so the price will be several times higher, about one thousand one hundred taels of silver."

"I see that both of these snow beasts were shot through the heart with a single arrow. If they pass the martial arts inspection, and if they were killed purely with archery, you can get an additional two hundred taels of silver."

Gu Nianjun raised her eyebrows and asked curiously, "Why would you get an extra two hundred taels of silver for no reason?"

The steward smiled and said, "After the snow beasts die, our Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion needs to skin them, remove their organs... take out all useful parts of their bodies, then use secret methods to process, refine... and make them into various goods for sale. Some martial artists, in order to kill snow beasts, often infuse the essence of their martial arts and the evolution of their martial arts into their arrows. They even fight the snow beasts directly."

"If we encounter such a situation..."

The steward looked at the maid beside him. The maid understood and brought a large wooden box. The steward opened the box, which contained a roll of snow beast fur. However, the fur was yellowish and lacked a clean, white appearance.

The steward said, "This snow beast was killed by a martial artist. But when this martial artist shot the arrow, he used the essence of the 'Ten Thousand Withering Palm'. After the snow beast was killed, its five organs failed, and its skin and blood dried up. Only a fur remained, barely usable, and this fur is yellowish and slightly fishy, with very low quality. It's all the residual effects of the Ten Thousand Withering Palm."

"And this snow tiger. The reason why snow tigers are expensive is not just their fur, but also their tough tiger bones. But it was hit by the 'Bone Shattering and Muscle Breaking Palm'. It was first killed by martial arts, then an arrow was added to pretend it was shot. Its fur is usable, but its bones are all broken. These are all losses. That's why, if it's killed purely with archery, our Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion can handle the snow beast much more easily, and we are willing to pay more money."

Gu Nianjun understood and said, "Then let's go for the test. These two snow beasts were indeed killed purely with archery."

The steward ordered people to carry the two snow beasts and went deep into the pavilion. After about an hour, he hurried back, his eyes filled with even more admiration. He honestly presented one thousand five hundred taels.

The steward said respectfully, "This female hero, your archery is incredibly high, astonishing and admirable. If you have any more catches in the future, please come to the Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion again!"

Gu Nianjun said honestly, "This arrow was possible only with the help of a friend of mine. Hmm... If I have any more catches in the future, I'll come to you."

The steward said, "Female hero, is that friend of yours perhaps this one..." He turned his head to look at Zhou Shijie.

Gu Nianjun laughed, "Of course not. He..." Her beautiful eyes were full of color. Zhou Shijie felt very resentful. Seeing Gu Nianjun speak of that "friend" with a look of joy and pride, it was something he rarely saw elsewhere.

In the following days, Li Xian and Gu Nianjun cooperated to hunt the fox, entering and leaving the Snow Dragon Mountain Range together. Zhou Shijie tried to follow them secretly several times, but Gu Nianjun's martial arts were indeed superior to his, and her lightness skill was several times better. He had the intention to follow, but was unable to keep up.

The Snow Mountain Spirit Fox was gradually traced, and clues began to emerge. The Snow Mountain Spirit Fox is a creature of ultimate purity. Its blood is not tainted and can heal injuries, grow flesh, and mend bones. Its whole body is a treasure. Only archery can kill it and retain this characteristic. This kind of fox beast is attracted to things of ultimate purity.

Those with a 'Perfect Physique' have a greater chance of encountering the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox.

Li Xian would exhale pure energy and use his Pure Gang Qi Clothes to cover his body. His whole body was pure and clean, flawless, like an immortal in the mist. Gu Nianjun saw this method and admired him even more, her eyes shining. Her mind was entirely on hunting the fox. She directly declined several gatherings of prodigies.

Li Xian and Gu Nianjun never returned empty-handed each time they returned to the city. They would always hunt several snow beasts, which Gu Nianjun would exchange for money. The money they got was divided six to four. Li Xian's family assets gradually grew, and he moved Huo Er and the other five to a better inn.

This went on back and forth.

As more snow beasts appeared in the city, rumors began to spread from the Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion. An extremely powerful young archer had come to Flying Dragon City. At this time, among the Five Great Sword Sects, there were also rumors brewing. For some reason, the young man with a fair face and a red bow became famous throughout Flying Dragon City.

Wen Caishang smiled when she heard the news. She was certain that this person was Li Xian. She had already set her sights on Li Xiaofan and was confident of victory. Although she was angry at Li Xian's betrayal, seeing him display his brilliance, she couldn't help but feel extremely proud. So she only paid attention to the rumors about the fair-faced, red-bowed youth and did not move to capture him.

In the blink of an eye, it was the seventh day.

On this day, Li Xian exhaled pure energy, his whole body pure. As expected, deep in a snow mountain, he attracted the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox to show itself. Li Xian's archery was transcendent and killed the Spirit Fox on the spot. When he picked up the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox, he was indescribably joyful, feeling that the Yellow Essence Treasure was already before his eyes.
