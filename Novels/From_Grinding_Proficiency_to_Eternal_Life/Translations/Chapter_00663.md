# Chapter 663: Wait, Stop!

Tian Guang Zhenjun had no choice but to look toward Tianji Peak.

Unfortunately, the Tong Xuan Zhenjun of the Xuan Shu Sword Soul remained silent, clearly showing no intention of denying it.

Tian Guang Zhenjun was helpless. If this matter were truly pursued, Tong Xuan Zhenjun would suffer terribly.

However, Tong Xuan Zhenjun was the嫡系 of嫡系 within the Wan Cheng Sword Sect, with impeccable lineage. He was truly a disciple of the Dao Lord, so Tian Guang Zhenjun could neither touch him nor dare to.

Thus, he could only suppress the matter and let it go.

Inside the Primordial Origin Sect, Jiuyuan Xuansha Dongming Zhenjun sensed this and looked toward the Eastern Wilderness. Seeing Qingyuan Zhenjun in a perilous situation, a hint of excitement appeared on her face.

"False possession of the Golden Position? Using the Taiyin Xuan Jian Dao Fruit as fuel. What a splendid method."

She could clearly sense the immense, forcibly elevated power of the Golden Core level on Xu Yunfan, as well as the unique Dao Rhyme that dissipated when the core of that Dao Fruit collapsed.

"Qingyuan deceived me! This child actually possesses such courage and methods. I failed to see through him earlier."

A barely perceptible trace of regret and surprise flashed through her heart.

At the border of the Bodhi Pure Land, seated opposite Pu Du Zhenjun on the Great Awakening Lotus Throne.

The Great Awakening Bodhisattva, whose eyelids had been lowered, slightly raised them. His gaze seemed to pierce through endless space and land upon Xu Yunfan.

For the first time, a hint of solemnity appeared on his face, which was filled with wisdom and compassion.

"Supreme Dispassion, the 'Lin' Character Mantra of the Wan Cheng Sword Sect. To use this method as a foundation and forcibly borrow the power of an external Dao Fruit to perform such a heaven-defying act. Qingyuan Dao Friend is in danger."

He saw the trajectory of Qingyuan Zhenjun's fate, which was locked, and the terrifying killing intent contained within the Star Banner.

The Great Awakening Bodhisattva looked at Pu Du Zhenjun opposite him, who seemed devoid of any emotion.

"Will Zhenjun not stop him?"

Pu Du Zhenjun replied coldly, "My Primordial Origin Sect believes in the survival of the fittest."

"But I recall there is a rule forbidding the mutual slaughter of fellow sect members."

"Is there? I didn't see it. Bodhisattva, your eyes must be failing."

"..."

The Twelve Peaks of the Wan Cheng Sword Sect.

Almost in the instant Xu Yunfan activated the 'Lin' Character Mantra, the minds of all the elders in seclusion and the disciples practicing sword arts on the Twelve Sword Peaks trembled violently.

"The 'Lin' Character Mantra?!"

"This aura... it's the 'Lin' Character Mantra! Who is it?! How could they summon such a vast Supreme Dao Rhyme?"

"The direction is in the Eastern Wilderness. Is it that Xu Yunfan?!"

"Impossible! The 'Lin' Character Mantra is my sect's supreme secret transmission. It cannot be cultivated unless one's Sword Heart is clear and one's Dao Heart is harder than divine steel. Even among those who succeed, the number can be counted on one hand. How could he..."

"This intent...想必 Supreme Dispassion has reached its peak!"

Throughout the sect, countless shocked and horrified gazes used various methods to investigate the Eastern Wilderness.

The 'Lin' Character Mantra was left by the Sect Master of the Sword Sect. Over the countless years since, those who could cultivate it could be counted on one hand.

The fluctuation of the 'Lin' Character Mantra was like a boulder thrown into a calm lake, stirring up massive waves in this holy land of the sword path, the Wan Cheng Sword Sect.

Above the Sword Peaks, the spiritual senses of several Golden Core Zhenjuns intersected instantly, filled with shock and inquiry.

As for Lu Chunyang, he paid no attention to these disturbances, merely staring intently at the Eastern Wilderness without blinking.

He had never successfully cultivated the 'Lin' Character Mantra either. He never expected a junior from the Dao Sect to have achieved it.

Xu Yunfan naturally had no time to pay attention to these shocks.

His heart was like a mirror of ice, all thoughts converging into one.

The brief time of false possession of the Golden Position could not be wasted. Although the Divine霄 Dao Fruit was right before him, with strong enemies surrounding him, he had to eliminate them first.

"Divine霄 Nine Palaces, Profound Firmament Undying! Edict the Heavens, Myriad Thunders Obey!"

A flat voice, like an edict from the God of Thunder in the Ninth Heaven. Under the极速 thinking of the 'Lin' State and the immense power of the false Golden Position, the Divine霄 Nine Palaces Profound Firmament Undying Sutra was pushed to an unprecedented extreme.

"Divine霄 Purple Mansion Destruction Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method!"

A magnificent purple-gold divine thunder, containing the supreme majesty of destroying all methods and judging heaven and earth, tore through the sky and struck Qingyuan Zhenjun head-on!

"Nine Palaces Profound Firmament Suppressing Prison Earth Fiend Thunder Method!"

Immediately after, endless pitch-black Earth Fiend Abyss Divine Thunder erupted from the ground, transforming into nine ferocious thunder dragons entangled with法则 chains, sealing off all of Qingyuan Zhenjun's retreat paths!

"Supreme Yi Clear Source Cleansing Demon Fiend Thunder Method!"

The purest and cleanest azure thunder light descended like sweet rain. Wherever it passed, the clear qi of the immortal palace was forcibly dissolved.

"Circumstellar Dipper Pivot Splitting Metal Gang Thunder Method!"

The Taibai Rigid Metal Qi condensed into billions of森 white Gang Thunders capable of splitting metal and breaking methods, pouring down like a torrential downpour, specifically targeting protective immortal light and the spiritual rhymes of treasures!

This was only the beginning.

Eight types of supreme divine thunders with completely different attributes yet sharing the same root, mutually generating and restraining each other under the统御 of the Divine霄 True Meaning, were interwoven by Xu Yunfan into a net of destruction covering the heavens and earth.

Great Sun Glaze Purifying World Fire Thunder, Nine Nether Ice Suppressing Demon Yin Thunder, Primordial Earth Sealing Divine Thunder, Green Wood Life and Death Withering and Glorious Thunder, Gui Water Abyss Destroying Fiend Thunder, Supreme Void Yin-Yang Annihilation Thunder...

Magnificent Heavenly Gang Divine霄 Purifying Evil True Thunder!

Finally, all the thunders merged into one, transforming into a piercing purple-gold Purifying Evil True Thunder that ran through heaven and earth. Carrying the ultimate power to cleanse the cosmos and reshape the universe, it locked onto Qingyuan Zhenjun.

"Circumstellar Stars, Obey My Command!"

Xu Yunfan's cold voice rang out again.

The Star Spirit Banner in his sleeve glowed with a dark light, unfurling with a crackling sound.

Inside the banner, three powerful banner spirits—Hui Ri Bodhisattva, the Fighting King Buddha Wukong, and the Abyss True君 Han Shi—who emitted the pressure of a Golden Core, opened their eyes simultaneously. Together with the other comparatively weak and helpless Star Lords, they linked into one. The immense starlight and the essence of the banner spirits connected with the celestial stars.

Hum!

A Circumstellar Star Array, far more vast and complete than ever before, with a森然 killing intent, formed instantly.

Shadows of billions of stars appeared, and starlight descended like substantial chains, completely transforming this battlefield into a Starry Dome Prison that isolated heaven and earth.

The three Golden Core banner spirits sat at the core array eye, completely filling the final gap in the array, allowing it to finally display a terrifying power capable of trapping and killing a Golden Core Zhenjun.

Starlight was like a prison, suppressing the operation of Qingyuan Zhenjun's Wondrous Dao True Method of Immortal Palace Clear Qi.

"What?!"

Qingyuan Zhenjun's expression changed completely.

The scent of death drowned him like a tide.

His proud Immortal Palace Clear Qi, under the successive bombardments of the eight Divine霄 Divine Thunders and the powerful suppression of the Circumstellar Star Array, was rapidly disintegrating like melting snow.

That magnificent Heavenly Gang Divine霄 Purifying Evil True Thunder directly shook his Cavern Heaven.

He couldn't hold on.

He truly didn't expect that Xu Yunfan could still pull out such a move.

"Xu Yunfan, stop!"

Qingyuan Zhenjun roared, frantically urging his Immortal Palace Clear Qi to resist this world-destroying offensive, while urgently shouting.

"Do you remember?! It was I who guided you into the Dao! In the Divine Martial Realm, it was I who bestowed upon you the Purple Micro Heavenly Gang! It was I who passed on the Karma Secret Technique to you! Without me, how could you have reached where you are today?! I even treated you to a meal!"

He tried to use past favors to disturb Xu Yunfan's mind. Even in this state of Supreme Dispassion, if there was the slightest wavering, he would have a chance to turn the tables.

However, the only response he received was an even more violent and precise thunderous assault.

In the 'Lin' State, Xu Yunfan's heart was like eternal ancient ice, all thoughts silent.
