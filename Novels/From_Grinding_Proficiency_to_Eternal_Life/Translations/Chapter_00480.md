# Chapter 480: Patron, Please Halt

Xu Yunfan's mind sank into the core of his Dao Foundation. The cultivation stage of the *Grafting a Small World* technique had also stabilized at the入门 (Entry) level.

The status panel clearly marked the locations of several fatal traps within the version taught by Hundred Peaks, which he had already corrected during his cultivation.

His mid Foundation Establishment realm had long since been pushed to its peak. The Northern Dipper Purple Weir Suppressing Evil Mystic Yang was exceptionally stable, and the four great divine abilities circulated in an endless cycle.

All that remained was to travel to the Divine Martial World to harvest the Primordial Qi. Once that was completed, he could immediately advance to late Foundation Establishment.

Through the window, he gazed into the vast depths of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

It was time.

The deadly net laid out by Qingyuan True Lord was waiting for him to step into it.

The direction of the Primordial Origin Sect was off-limits; the relationship between Dongming True Lord and Qingyuan was unpredictable.

The only variable capable of disrupting the board lay to the south.

That land of killing intent, where the Sword Qi of Ten Thousand Chariots had sliced through mountain ranges and the pure yang edge had pierced through the sea of clouds.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect!

"With Han Shi as my final pawn and the aura of the *Ten Thousand Chariots Transformation Sword Art*... This trip will use force to counter force, drawing the Pure Yang faction into the game. Whether this risky move of using myself as bait can seize a chance to turn the tables before that Sword Dao True Lord who sits observing from above is yet to be seen!"

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed. Without further hesitation, he concealed his figure and left Cold Raven Pass directly.

In the most remote corner of the Cold Raven Pass market, the middle-aged man who had been sitting as still as withered wood suddenly furrowed his brow.

His calloused fingers unconsciously stroked the "Peace Coin," and a strange glint flashed through his murky eyes.

"Eh?"

He rarely let out such a sound, a look of astonishment首次 (appearing) on his wrinkled face.

The motion of his finger divinating accelerated abruptly. A faint golden light shimmered between his knuckles, vanishing in an instant.

However, the usually clear trajectories of fate were now shrouded in thick fog, making it impossible to窥探 (peer into) Xu Yunfan's whereabouts.

"Interesting."

Before the hoarse voice had faded, his figure消散 (dissipated) like a bubble in the bustling market.

The wandering cultivators haggling around him remained completely unaware of this诡异 (strange)一幕 (scene).

It was as if this算命先生 (fortune teller) who had been setting up his stall for years had never existed at all.

The four continents of the world are separated by a vast Milky Way.

This Milky Way is not ordinary water, but rather a汇聚 (gathering) of countless suspended陨石 (meteorites). Starlight permeates it, dazzling yet hiding lethal danger.

The Milky Way appears to be only a few hundred里 (li) wide, but in reality, it contains endless虚空乱流 (void turbulence), and even the Starlight Primordial Evil rages within.

If a Qi Condensation cultivator were to rashly闯入 (charge in), they would be碾为齑粉 (crushed to dust) in an instant, their soul unable to escape.

Only the channels carved out by历代 (past generations) of Foundation Establishment True Persons with supreme magical power can allow safe passage.

These channels are as intricate as a spider's web, yet they are隐没 (hidden) deep within the Milky Way, impossible to find for those unfamiliar with the route.

The inner walls of the channels are covered in profound runes, emitting a faint spiritual light that blocks the violent Starlight Primordial Evil.

If a cultivator wishes to cross this Milky Way, they must follow these paths开辟 (opened) by their predecessors to safely reach the other shore.

Southern Continent, the domain controlled by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Xu Yunfan looked at the Milky Way behind him and couldn't help but click his tongue.

Although he had guarded the boundary of the Primordial Origin Sect at Cold Raven Pass for many years, this was his first time crossing the river that separated the four continents.

The danger within goes without saying. If it were according to Xu Yunfan's usual direct and forceful style of movement, even a Qi Condensation cultivator with a protective treasure would be震死 (killed by the shock) from the bombardment of countless meteorites.

He naturally would not enter or exit through a cross-realm传送阵 (teleportation array). As a True Person of the Primordial Origin Sect, if he used one, he would be盯上 (targeted) immediately.

Xu Yunfan casually found a wandering cultivator nearby. Using the True武 Devouring Demon Art, he搜罗 (searched) through their memories, then tossed some spirit materials on the对方 (person) as compensation.

Given the other party's cultivation base of only early Qi Condensation, these spirit materials were completely sufficient to allow them to reach mid Qi Condensation.

I really am a good person!

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh with emotion that he was ultimately untainted by the mud. If it were any other Foundation Establishment True Person from the Primordial Origin Sect, they wouldn't just搜魂 (soul-search); they would顺便 (casually) dismember the person to make full use of them.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect dominates the central region of the Southern Continent.

Its mountain gate is located on a towering Sword Peak that pierces through the heavens and the earth. The body of the peak is straight like a sword, radiating a cold glint as it拔地而起 (rises from the ground) and pierces thirty thousand zhang into the clouds.

The summit is perpetually shrouded in a violent wind formed from sharp Sword Qi. From a distance, the entire mountain resembles an unsheathed peerless divine sword, its锋芒 (edge) fully exposed, intimidating all directions.

It is both the location of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's mountain gate and one of the most prominent landmarks in the Southern Continent.

The Southern Continent is a domain of the orthodox path. A demonic True Person like him, originating from the Primordial Origin Sect, would naturally be shouted at and killed by everyone.

Xu Yunfan would not reveal his identity. He cultivated the True武 Subduing Demons Sutra, practicing the method of all evils避易 (avoiding him) and the vast True武. If he didn't say he was from the Primordial Origin Sect, who would be able to tell he was a demonic True Person?

Just as he was preparing to head to the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, a醇厚平和 (mellow and peaceful) voice suddenly sounded from behind him.

"Patron, please halt."
