# Chapter 4: Outer Disciple  

"Line up for the inspection," the middle-aged man in the blue robe said without preamble, placing a jade stone engraved with intricate patterns on the prepared table.  

The jade was used to detect spiritual energy within a person's body. As long as someone had successfully initiated Qi absorption, the jade would respond. This was the standard for becoming an official outer disciple of the Qinglu Sect.  

At his words, the crowd quickly formed a line. The first person stepped forward and placed their hand on the jade, which immediately emitted a faint glow.  

"Pass!"  

The middle-aged man nodded in approval and handed over a small pouch—this was the standard issue for those who passed the test and officially became outer disciples of the Qinglu Sect.  

One by one, the candidates stepped forward. The brightness of the jade's glow varied with each person, indicating the amount of spiritual energy they had accumulated. Those who had initiated Qi absorption earlier naturally had more spiritual energy than those who had done so later.  

Whenever the jade shone particularly bright, the onlookers couldn't help but cast envious glances.  

Since the test was simple—just placing a hand on the jade—the process moved quickly. Soon, it was Gu Mo's turn.  

The middle-aged man's expression darkened slightly when he saw Gu Mo. He considered him the only blemish in this recruitment task. His rewards from the sect depended on the success rate of his assigned disciples.  

"Hmm?"  

To his surprise, the jade emitted a faint glow when Gu Mo placed his hand on it. A flicker of relief crossed the middle-aged man's face.  

"Not bad!"  

For once, he offered a rare word of praise. Gu Mo's last-minute success in initiating Qi absorption was a pleasant surprise, ensuring his task would be completed smoothly.  

Gu Mo himself let out a long sigh of relief. Since he had initiated Qi absorption using solar essence—an unconventional method—he had worried that the test might not recognize it.  

But it seemed solar essence was still a form of spiritual energy, albeit of a higher grade. The jade could detect it regardless, though it couldn't distinguish the quality of the energy.  

"From today onward, you are all officially outer disciples of the Qinglu Sect," the middle-aged man announced, now in a much better mood. "For the next year, your task is to cultivate diligently and strive to reach the Qi Refinement stage. During this time, senior disciples from various peaks will come to select followers. You may choose to join them based on your own preferences."  

He paused before adding, "However, if you fail to make a choice within a year, the sect will assign you forcibly. So decide early—some popular peaks fill up quickly. Once they're full, they won't take anyone else."  

With that, the middle-aged man departed, leaving the previously silent square buzzing with excitement. Some gathered in small groups to discuss which peak they should join, while others eagerly inspected the contents of their pouches.  

Gu Mo fell into the latter category. The moment he had obtained the Sunflower, he had already decided to become a spiritual farmer, tending to spirit fields while secretly cultivating his prized plant.  

Opening his pouch, he found several items: an outer disciple identity token, a plain gray robe, a Qi Refinement cultivation manual, a bottle of fasting pills, three Qi Condensation Pills, and three spirit stones.  

The identity token served as proof of his status and was also used to accept sect missions and record contributions. The robe, though unremarkable in appearance, was a low-grade enchanted garment that provided resistance to extreme temperatures—something that would be considered a treasure in the mortal world.  

The cultivation manual, titled *Gathering Qi Art*, was a middling technique with only one advantage: it allowed for relatively fast progress compared to others of its rank. It was perfect for outer disciples who needed to reach a usable level of cultivation quickly.  

As for the pills and spirit stones, they were essential cultivation resources. The fasting pills allowed for extended meditation sessions, while the Qi Condensation Pills aided in advancing one's cultivation. Even someone with inferior spiritual roots could reasonably expect to reach the Qi Refinement stage within a year with these resources.  

Gu Mo couldn't help but marvel at the benefits of joining a major sect. And this was just for outer disciples—he could only imagine the resources available to inner disciples.  

Of course, the sect's investment would eventually be repaid through their labor.  

"Gu Mo!"  

Just as he was about to leave, someone called his name. Surprised—he didn't know anyone here—he turned to see four people approaching. The leader was a young man dressed in luxurious robes, clearly from a wealthy mortal family.  

But in the world of cultivation, wealth meant little compared to talent and spiritual roots.  

"Yao Shifeng," the young man introduced himself with a polite bow.  

Gu Mo recognized him—he had been one of those who made the jade shine brightly earlier. These were the top candidates among the outer disciples. But why was he seeking Gu Mo out?  

"I heard you're also from the Great Xia Dynasty," Yao Shifeng said. "We're all from there as well."  

He continued, "The path of cultivation is long and fraught with dangers. Having companions who can lend a hand in times of need can make all the difference. Since we all hail from Great Xia, we should stick together and help each other go further on this journey."  

He smiled, waiting for Gu Mo's response.  

After a brief consideration, Gu Mo agreed. Though he wasn't truly their countryman—having transmigrated into this world—he understood the value of allies. In a strict sect like this, finding trustworthy companions was far easier than among rogue cultivators, where betrayal was always a risk.
