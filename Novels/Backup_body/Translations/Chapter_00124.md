# Chapter 124: The Ascended Zhengjing Immortal, the Delighted Thousand Illusions God

After realizing they couldn't easily eliminate each other, the old fox and the young fox reached a tacit understanding in an instant, staging a so-called mutual defeat.

Now, with the death of Sanyang Gong, General Fangyin roared in fury.

"Magistrate Jiangshang, you dare betray the nation?"

General Fangyin watched helplessly as the official fortunes on himself and Sanyang Gong were transferred to the Flame God King.

At this moment, the Flame God King's aura surged, surpassing even his initial arrival here.

"If I can't capture Li Zhengjing, killing you all will still be a gain!"

The twin maces in the Flame God King's hands blazed with radiant light, exuding a murderous intent.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing ruthlessly killed the Elder of Luofu Immortal Sect and seized the Luofu Summoning Banner.

The Elder of Yuhua Immortal Sect, who was still engaged in battle, and the other Human Immortals who had appeared one after another, were all struck with shock.

"You..."

The Elder of Yuhua Immortal Sect suddenly chuckled, "As expected of a disciple from the Ancient Moon Peak. Young in age but deep in cunning, truly reminiscent of the former Peak Master. Today, you've gained immense benefits, your strength has soared. Return with me to the sect, and you shall be granted the position of Guardian Elder of Ancient Moon Peak."

"Get lost!"

Li Zhengjing slowly rose to his feet, gripping the Luofu Summoning Banner, and said coldly, "If you want to seize my opportunities and fortunes, come and capture me yourself!"

His true energy radiated outward, carrying an overwhelming sharpness.

His gaze swept across the surroundings, and not a single Human Immortal dared to meet his eyes.

His eyes then turned to the northern direction as he said indifferently, "Elder Xuhua of Kunlun Immortal Sect, you've been hiding for so long. Aren't you going to make a move?"

"Immortal Venerable Zhengjing once saved me in the capital. I came here with no ill intentions."

Elder Xuhua's voice came from afar, "Since the Immortal Venerable is unharmed, I can rest easy. I shall take my leave now and visit you another day."

"Good."

Li Zhengjing's expression remained calm as he looked at the remaining figures present. "Anyone else want to try?"

Silence fell over the scene, and eventually, everyone dispersed.

Even the Elder of Yuhua Immortal Sect merely glanced at him before leaving.

The battle had reached its conclusion.

Although Li Zhengjing had revealed that his cultivation was only at the True Qi Realm, he had still obtained the opportunities from the Heavenly Star Cave. His combat power was now even greater than before.

The various factions had come for two reasons: the Heavenly Star Cave's opportunities and the various fortunes Li Zhengjing possessed—such as the Dragon Pillar of the Hall and the Mystic Mirror of Illumination.

Moreover, Li Zhengjing himself was a treasure to these factions. His unparalleled talent was unmatched throughout history. Even if they couldn't recruit him, studying his corpse would yield immense benefits.

But now, all these opportunities had fallen into Li Zhengjing's hands. Even the Flame God King couldn't suppress him and seize them.

The Human Immortals and deities who had gathered here had come away empty-handed.

As the Human Immortals retreated, Li Zhengjing turned his gaze to the distant turmoil—where the Flame God King was still battling General Fangyin and his thirty-thousand-strong army.

Here, however, the dust had settled.

Li Zhengjing let out a long sigh of relief. The breath he had been suppressing finally surged up his throat.

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Collapsing to the ground, he gasped, "Couldn't hold it in any longer... At least I scared them all off..."

Before he could finish, a cold voice rang out from above.

"So it was all a bluff!"

A middle-aged man appeared—slender, with a sneer on his face. In his hand was a silver basin, which he hurled downward. "I refuse to believe a mere True Qi Realm cultivator could unleash such power without suffering backlash!"

Even if Li Zhengjing were a Human Immortal, after continuous battles, he should be exhausted by now.

How could a mere True Qi Realm cultivator, with a mortal body, wield such sharp sword techniques unscathed?

Gao Xuan was proof enough!

The silver basin descended!

The man, confident of success, formed a hand seal to retrieve it, laughing, "Who said such opportunities belong only to the great sects? This humble Divine Traveler shall reap the rewards today!"

This was none other than the Elder of the Ancient Feather Profound Sect, one of the Thirty-Six Demon Sects of the Southern Wasteland—Divine Traveler!

But just as he was about to retrieve the silver basin, a flaming sword pierced through it, shattering it instantly!

The residual force of the flaming sword struck him!

"You—!"

Divine Traveler, though not the strongest among Human Immortals, was unparalleled in stealth and evasion. Yet now, he couldn't dodge in time and was struck head-on!

He vomited blood and fled, transforming into a streak of light heading south.

His heart was filled with humiliation and disbelief. "How does he still have the strength to counterattack?!"

The silver basin was shattered, and Li Zhengjing fell to the ground, his organs shaken from the impact. He spat out another mouthful of blood.

"I'm done for..."

Li Zhengjing lay on the ground, barely breathing, muttering, "I barely recovered after refining a batch of spirit stones earlier. Now I really have no strength left to fight."

The wind was light, the clouds calm. No one came to challenge him.

First time playing dead—he injured the Flame God King.

Second time—he killed the Elder of Luofu Immortal Sect.

Third time—he severely wounded Divine Traveler.

This was the fourth time!

"Three strikes and you're out. Do they really think we're fools who never learn?"

The onlookers, realizing they could gain nothing more, finally dispersed completely.

Though some still harbored doubts, wondering if Li Zhengjing was truly exhausted after three feints, the previous lessons were enough to deter any further attempts.

In the capital, the Mystic Mirror of the Hall displayed everything.

The deities and Human Immortals present were silent.

Had all of this been within the State Preceptor's expectations?

Like the Human Immortals and deities on the battlefield, both Li Zhengjing and the Flame God King had seemed like easy prey.

But now, witnessing the full picture, they realized they would have been mere pawns in the game between the old fox and the young fox.

"This time..."

The State Preceptor's expression was strange as he murmured, "Perhaps he truly is exhausted."

With that, he waved his hand. "Inform His Majesty to issue an edict stripping Magistrate Jiangshang of his position and have him arrested!"

Meanwhile, the State Preceptor of the Great Xuan Dynasty stood above the sea, his heart trembling with shock and doubt.

Every time he encountered Li Zhengjing, the young man's strength had grown exponentially. Now, he had surpassed even the State Preceptor himself.

If they met again, the State Preceptor might be nothing more than an ant before him.

He deeply regretted his earlier attempt to intercept Li Zhengjing. Not only had he lost the Mystic Mirror of Illumination, but he had also earned Li Zhengjing's enmity.

"The winds of the world are shifting. I am no longer fit to lead. It's time to awaken the ancestors who sealed themselves to prolong their lifespans."

Lin Fuxuan hesitated no longer. He turned and fled far into the sea.

Glancing down, he saw the Dragon God of Gu River still being pummeled by the little dragon girl, utterly defenseless.

At this moment, Lin Fuxuan's expression turned grave.

"This little girl, so young yet so powerful... She could have shattered the Dragon God of Gu River with a single punch..."

Lin Fuxuan's heart trembled. "Her fists can bypass the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone, penetrate the divine body, and scatter the soul-infused mana within?"

Originally, he had planned to capture the Dragon God of Gu River and bring it back to the Great Xuan Cave Heaven, finding a way to extract the Human Immortal's mana and create a new deity for the dynasty.

Now, it seemed impossible.

The little dragon girl suddenly looked up from the sea.

Lin Fuxuan transformed into a streak of light and fled.

He knew that if he lingered, he might be the next victim!

Though he had gained nothing from this venture, the Great Zhou Dynasty had lost three deities, severely injured a divine general, and suffered over half of its thirty-thousand elite troops dead or wounded.

Moreover, the exposure of Magistrate Jiangshang's true identity would throw the entire officialdom of Jiangshang Prefecture into chaos, weakening the dynasty's overall fortune.

After this, the Great Zhou Dynasty was even more vulnerable!

For Lin Fuxuan, this was still a favorable outcome.

On the beach, Li Zhengjing remained lying on the ground, but his senses scanned the surroundings.

No Human Immortals or deities remained nearby, but the aftermath of the battle lingered. The scene was one of utter devastation.

The sea raged, flames burned.

Dark clouds loomed, rain poured, vegetation was obliterated, and even the sand had been pulverized countless times.

"At least we're far from towns and villages, in this desolate place."

Li Zhengjing thought to himself, his eyes flashing with golden light.

Before him, a figure slowly approached.

It was the Flame God King.

"Magistrate Jiangshang was planted by me in the Central Continent's bureaucracy years ago. A pity he was exposed today."

The Flame God King's voice was calm. "General Fangyin has been severely injured by me. I intended to kill him, but the imperial edict from the capital arrived too quickly, stripping Magistrate Jiangshang of his fortune and transferring it to General Fangyin... Along with his remaining twenty thousand elites, they rescued him."

He sheathed his golden maces and said indifferently, "Deities from all regions are converging here. It's unwise for me to pursue further."

Li Zhengjing stared at him. "What's that got to do with me?"

The Flame God King took out the Mystic Mirror of Illumination that had fallen from Sanyang Gong and tossed it to Li Zhengjing.

"This treasure belongs to the Great Xuan Dynasty. That tree of yours was using it earlier. I took it from Sanyang Gong and return it to you."

The Flame God King continued, "You're using the Great Xuan Dynasty's treasure, yet you're clearly not allied with Lin Fuxuan. Did you steal it from him?"

Li Zhengjing remained sprawled on the beach. "What's that got to do with you?"

The Flame God King said, "Deities from across Great Zhou are coming. You helped me kill Sanyang Gong and injure General Fangyin. Your daughter slew the Dragon God of Gu River. Do you still think this has nothing to do with you?"

He released his divine aura. "Join me. When we conquer the Central Continent, you'll have a place at my side."

Li Zhengjing stretched out his charred left arm, retrieved the Mystic Mirror of Illumination, and glanced at him without responding.

"Fourth time."

The Flame God King suddenly said, "You faked death or injury three times. This is the fourth. I wonder if you're truly wounded now."

Li Zhengjing's expression didn't change. "Why don't you test it?"

The Flame God King narrowed his eyes. "Even at your peak, you couldn't kill me. Now... perhaps it's worth a try."

Silence hung in the air.

Then, the Flame God King slowly turned and walked south.

"Not going to try?" Li Zhengjing called after him. "Come back and give it a shot!"

The Flame God King didn't respond, vanishing into the horizon.

He thought to himself, "I've lived over a thousand years and seen countless people... This little fox shows no fear. He's truly unshakable. He doesn't fear me at all."

Watching the Flame God King leave, Li Zhengjing exhaled.

Having consumed three hundred spirit mines, the golden page's display of his fortune was crystal clear.

As a proper person, he wouldn't die here today!

Thus, Li Zhengjing feared the Flame God King not at all.

Even if he was truly exhausted and powerless now, the golden page still showed he would face no danger here.

With that thought, Li Zhengjing smiled at the sky, then glanced at the golden page.

His expression froze.

Now he understood why he had nothing to fear from the Flame God King.

"I'll celebrate your ancestor!"

Li Zhengjing couldn't help but sit up, cursing inwardly. "The Thousand Illusions God was watching the whole time? Is he still here?"

As he pondered this, two birds—one large, one small—descended from the clouds.

The larger bird was Ghost Valley's Divine Official, with golden feathers.

The smaller was the Wall-Climbing Bird, chirping excitedly, "Master is invincible!"

Li Zhengjing grabbed a handful of sand and threw it. "Where the hell were you earlier? Too scared to fight?"

"Master, I was wronged!" the bird cried. "Blame the Ten Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Lord! He was just watching, not helping!"

Ghost Valley's Divine Official landed, his expression grave. "The fact that he didn't seize the opportunity to kill you is already a blessing."

"The Ten Calamities Heavenly Lord was here?"

Li Zhengjing's face paled. "Where is he now?"

The Thousand Illusions God had been spectating, and so had the Ten Calamities Heavenly Lord.

For a moment, Li Zhengjing wondered if they were the same person.

But before he could dwell on it, Ghost Valley's Divine Official replied.

"He left after you repelled Divine Traveler."

He paused. "To be precise, he fled..."
