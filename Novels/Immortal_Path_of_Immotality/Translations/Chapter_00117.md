# Chapter 117: The Black and Red Duo  

Lin Shan observed the fervent village elders and gentry outside, then glanced at the old charlatan Zhong beside him. For the first time, he realized he had stumbled upon a treasure—this old man was truly a talent.  

"Are you sure your hypnotic techniques will work? What I need is genuine devotion," Lin Shan asked.  

Zhong swiftly turned around, his expression shifting so quickly it was dizzying, immediately bowing and smiling obsequiously.  

"Rest assured, my lord. The hypnosis is just to lower their guard and implant ideas—it's the quickest method for rapid results."  

"After a few more sessions, they'll be thoroughly indoctrinated and will wholeheartedly worship our sect."  

Lin Shan nodded and surveyed the group of subordinates around him.  

"Did you all see that clearly?"  

The crowd: "Yes."  

"Did you learn it?"  

The crowd: "We did."  

"Then why aren’t you all out there working?!"  

At this moment, Lin Shan’s inner capitalist was laid bare. Of course, the grunt work was for the underlings.  

As long as they weren’t worked to death, they’d be worked to the brink! Isn’t that what laborers are for—to be exploited?  

As for him? If they didn’t work hard, how could he, the envoy, earn contribution points to exchange for better magical artifacts and a better life?  

The hundred or so rogue cultivators in the courtyard cowered and scrambled out, terrified of provoking the wrath of the demonic sect envoy.  

---  

After resting for half an hour, Lin Shan stepped outside to find the entire village echoing with chants and prayers. Clearly, the cultivators were diligently spreading the faith. And to his surprise, each of them had picked up the method quite well!  

"O revered Black Lotus Buddha, thou art the light of the world!"  

"Uh, that big Buddha... uh... um..."  

"What nonsense is this?"  

"My Lord—wait, no, my Buddha!"  

...  

Watching the chaotic scene, Lin Shan nodded in satisfaction. After all, this was just the beginning.  

Once these cultivators had done this enough times, they’d naturally become more adept.  

There was no need to be too harsh on subordinates. The key was to exploit them subtly, in ways they wouldn’t even notice.  

As Lin Shan pondered how to squeeze more work out of his underlings, he flew to the only spot on the island with a trace of spiritual energy—a small hill outside the village.  

There, he found an abandoned cave dwelling left by a previous occupant. After a thorough cleaning and setting up the maze and warning formations he had bought earlier, he buried himself in cultivation.  

---  

Ten peaceful days later, Lin Shan emerged from seclusion under clear skies to inspect his subordinates' progress.  

Riding his sword over the fishing village, he sent a mental message to everyone:  

"Assemble at the village chief’s courtyard!"  

Soon, all the rogue cultivators had gathered and began reporting their progress one by one.  

"I distributed fifty Buddha statues these past few days."  

"I handed out eighty."  

"I gave away a hundred."  

...  

After hearing everyone’s reports, Lin Shan noticed varying levels of skill, but the most impressive was still Old Man Zhong.  

The old man had already emptied his storage bag of hundreds of Buddha statues three days prior—his efficiency was unmatched!  

"Good. From now on, you’ll be their leader."  

"When I’m not around, you’ll manage them for me."  

Lin Shan had a soft spot for capable people and didn’t hesitate to delegate authority.  

Old Man Zhong kowtowed in delight. "Thank you for your promotion, Envoy!"  

Lin Shan then scanned the crowd. "Understood?"  

"Understood!"  

No one dared object. Old Man Zhong was not only the most capable but also at the late Qi Refining stage, making him a natural choice to lead.  

After further inquiries, Lin Shan learned that the entire fishing village on Xia Yi Island, with its population of over ten thousand, had been thoroughly indoctrinated. Every fisherman now had a Black Lotus Buddha statue, marking the completion of the initial task.  

As for how devout they’d be a year later, that was a gradual process.  

Next, there were forty-nine other islands within a radius of ten thousand li, many with their own mortal populations. Lin Shan had no intention of visiting them personally. Instead, he paired up his subordinates, assigned them newly crafted Buddha statues sent by the sect’s temporary headquarters, and put Old Man Zhong in charge of coordinating the missionary work.  

As for how they’d cross the sea, Lin Shan didn’t need to ferry them one by one. These rogue cultivators from the East Sea all had small boats or other seafaring magical tools and talismans—just not as fast as flying.  

Before the demonic sects took over the East Sea, they had sailed these waters in search of opportunities, making them semi-locals in these unfamiliar waters.  

The East Sea was an inland sea, with most powerful sea creatures residing in the outer ocean, so sending them out to proselytize wasn’t particularly risky.  

Once everything was arranged, Lin Shan returned to his cave dwelling outside the village to cultivate in peace, confident that Old Man Zhong could handle the minor details.  

True to his expectations, after about ten days of collaboration, the rogue cultivators had mastered the missionary techniques and could operate independently.  

However, Old Man Zhong, for reasons unknown, had prepared an enormous stock of hypnotic incense and soul-calming pills, which he began selling to the other cultivators.  

With no other choice, the cultivators reluctantly purchased the supplies, paired up as instructed, and set sail for their assigned islands.  

---  

Over a month passed uneventfully. On the remote Xia Yi Island in the vast East Sea, Lin Shan diligently cultivated while consuming the pills provided by the sect.  

Though he lacked the sect’s spiritual veins and spirit-gathering formations, the trace of spiritual energy from the micro spiritual eye sufficed. Lin Shan was fiercely dedicated to his cultivation. At just over twenty years old, he had high hopes of reaching the Golden Core stage.  

Once there, he’d gain a lifespan of four hundred years—what a glorious prospect, inching closer to immortality!  

But his peaceful life was soon disrupted when the warning formation outside his cave activated. A message talisman fluttered wildly within the maze formation, jolting him out of his meditative state.  

Frowning, Lin Shan scanned with his spiritual sense and found Old Man Zhong and two other subordinates waiting anxiously outside.  

He knew they wouldn’t dare disturb him unless something major had happened.  

With a wave, he deactivated the formation and sent a mental message:  

"Enter!"  

The three visibly relaxed and hurried inside, bowing deeply.  

"What’s the matter?" Lin Shan asked.  

Old Man Zhong swallowed hard, glanced at the other two, and hesitantly spoke.  

"My lord, progress has been smooth this past month, but... these two were driven off an island while proselytizing by other cultivators..."  

Lin Shan was taken aback. Who would dare obstruct the Black Lotus Sect’s missionary work?  

Didn’t they know the East Sea was now the demonic sects’ playground? Who had the gall?  

The two rogue cultivators immediately knelt and pleaded, fearing punishment.  

"We were assigned to Red Shrimp Island when two Foundation Establishment cultivators suddenly appeared!"  

"They call themselves the Black and Red Duo and have claimed the island as their territory."  

"They beat us up and threw us off the island!"  

Lin Shan’s expression darkened.  

"Did you tell them you were Black Lotus Sect envoys on official business?"  

The two hastily confirmed they had, but the duo ignored them and expelled them regardless.  

Now Lin Shan was suspicious. No one reached Foundation Establishment by being foolish. If they dared defy the Black Lotus Sect, there had to be a reason.  

Was there some hidden expert on the island? Or did they have powerful backing?  

Ever the sycophant, Old Man Zhong smoothly unrolled a map of the "Xia Yi Sea Region" and laid it before Lin Shan.  

Lin Shan’s gaze swept over the map, landing on "Red Shrimp Island" in the southwestern corner.  

Old Man Zhong provided context: "Red Shrimp Island spans ten li, ranking among the top ten in size in this region. It lacks spiritual veins, but the surrounding waters teem with red shrimp."  

"These shrimp emerge at dusk and return to the sea at dawn. Mostly at the early Qi Refining stage, their shells have medicinal value. Many rogue cultivators hunt them for spirit stones, selling them at markets to fund their cultivation."  

"Five years ago, the Black and Red Duo seized the island, expelled all other cultivators, and monopolized the red shrimp trade..."  

Lin Shan now understood the situation. The Black and Red Duo were simply two rogue Foundation Establishment cultivators leveraging their strength to dominate the island’s resources—a common practice in the cultivation world.  

But the Black Lotus Sect was only proselytizing to mortals, not seizing the island. Why drive his people away?  

Was there more to it?  

Lin Shan stroked his chin and cautiously asked, "Has anything significant happened nearby recently?"  

Old Man Zhong promptly relayed recent sect bulletins.  

"Envoys have been stationed in the five surrounding sea regions to proselytize."  

"Water Bear Sea reportedly has a Golden Core beast lurking."  

"Yellow Shark Sea has sightings of the fugitive Turtle Sage."  

"The temporary headquarters dispatched over a dozen Golden Core protectors to hunt the escapee."  

...  

After sifting through the updates, Lin Shan found no mention of Red Shrimp Island harboring treasures or hidden experts.  

The only notable event was the fugitive Turtle Sage’s presence in a neighboring region, but that was the protectors’ concern, not his.  

After much deliberation, Lin Shan couldn’t fathom why the two Foundation Establishment cultivators would be so reckless as to defy the Black Lotus Sect. Were they living under a rock?  

Convinced there was no hidden danger, Lin Shan abruptly stood up.  

Striking his subordinates was a slap in his face!  

Proselytizing was his duty, and he couldn’t ignore Red Shrimp Island. Now that he was at Foundation Establishment himself, armed with multiple high-grade artifacts and trump cards, there was no need for excessive caution.  

Two rogue Foundation Establishment cultivators? Nothing to fear!  

As a high-ranking envoy of a major demonic sect, how dare these nobodies act so arrogantly!  

He immediately ordered Old Man Zhong to rally the troops. They would march on Red Shrimp Island and teach the duo who truly ruled these waters!
