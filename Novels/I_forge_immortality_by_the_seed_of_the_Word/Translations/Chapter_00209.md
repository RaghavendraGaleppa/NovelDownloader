# Chapter 206: The Invitation  

Time flowed quietly.  

Two months passed in the blink of an eye.  

On this day, within the central palace of the celestial island cave abode...  

Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes.  

With a thought, the information about the skill *Twenty-Four Heavens* from the mysterious jade talisman in his Niwan Palace instantly reflected in his mind.  

**[Twenty-Four Heavens - Level 6 (4.29 million/64 million)]**  

A trace of joy flickered in his eyes.  

The reason was simple.  

After two months of dedicated cultivation, the experience value of *Twenty-Four Heavens* had increased by a staggering 30,000 points.  

On average, he gained 1,000 experience points per day—a far cry from the mere 70 points he had managed before. The difference was like night and day.  

It was worth noting that Zhang Jing was cultivating a ranked celestial Dao divine ability, not the unranked techniques he had encountered in the lower realm. The difficulty gap between the two was beyond measure!  

As for why such rapid progress was possible—  

*"The Void Furnace and Primordial Immortal Core within the nine-layered heavenly world projections operate continuously, generating vast amounts of immortal spiritual energy every moment. This ensures I never have to worry about depleting my mana reserves."*  

*"Thus, I can sustain the *Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed* for extended periods."*  

*"Naturally, the rate at which I gain skill experience has skyrocketed."*  

A glint flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.  

This was an unexpected boon.  

When he first began cultivating, he had never imagined that *Twenty-Four Heavens* would have such a miraculous effect.  

A moment later, however, a faint trace of disappointment appeared on his face.  

*"It's a shame there's no way to replenish the consumption of mental energy. Otherwise, I could theoretically maintain the *Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed* indefinitely, which would lead to another exponential leap in skill experience gain."*  

He couldn't help but entertain such greedy thoughts.  

Still...  

Zhang Jing had an inkling that the true power of this Immortal Seed hadn't yet been fully unleashed—primarily due to the limitations of his Foundation Establishment realm cultivation.  

After all, Immortal Seeds corresponded to ranked divine abilities, and only cultivators at the Golden Core realm or above could truly wield their full might.  

The term *Golden Core Divine Ability Realm* wasn't just for show.  

*Huu—*  

At this thought, Zhang Jing exhaled softly.  

His gaze then hardened with determination.  

*"The Golden Core Divine Ability Realm... It won't be long now!"*  

Not long after, Zhang Jing summoned Lu Thirty-Eight.  

*"How are the three Immortal Root Seeds doing?"* he asked with a smile, a hint of anticipation in his voice.  

Zhang Jing understood clearly.  

Although he had obtained a vast amount of fortune from the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, it was ultimately a fleeting windfall—difficult to sustain.  

Moreover, spending time wandering through various secret realms had never been his true desire.  

Lu Thirty-Eight's ability to cultivate Immortal Root spirit plants might very well become his primary means of acquiring fortune in the future.  

With thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of Immortal Root spirit plants under his control, their output would undoubtedly reach astronomical figures—far surpassing the mere few billion units of fortune he currently possessed.  

Most importantly... this would be a *continuous* source of harvest!  

Opposite him, Lu Thirty-Eight grinned and replied respectfully,  

*"I was just about to report to you, Master."*  

*"Three days ago, the Immortal Root *Biluo Fruit*, the *Dragon-Patterned Gold Sword Bamboo*, and the *Longevity Pine* all sprouted new shoots and are growing vigorously. I estimate that the Biluo Fruit Tree will mature and bear fruit in just five hundred years, while the Dragon-Patterned Gold Sword Bamboo can be harvested in about two hundred years per cycle."*  

*"As for the Longevity Pine... its growth period is considerably longer. It will take at least two thousand years before it bears fruit."*  

Zhang Jing listened quietly, then nodded with a smile.  

*"You've worked hard."*  

He wasn't surprised.  

These were, after all, Immortal Roots—not some common plants from the lower realm that could mature in mere years or decades.  

In fact, the timeframes Lu Thirty-Eight had mentioned exceeded Zhang Jing's expectations.  

It was evident that this was the result of the latter's bloodline divine ability—*Natural Wondrous Birth: Womb Realm*.  

After a moment of contemplation, Zhang Jing asked another question:  

*"What about the *Three Lights Peach Tree* and the *Seven Treasures Gourd Vine* from before?"*  

*"Master,"* Lu Thirty-Eight paused briefly before answering straightforwardly, *"The Seven Treasures Gourd Vine is growing exceptionally well, but it will still take several hundred years to bear gourds. And once the gourds form, they'll require an extended period to mature."*  

*"All in all, I estimate the total time won't be much shorter than that of the Longevity Pine."*  

*"As for the Three Lights Peach Tree, it should bear fruit in less than two hundred years."*  

Having said that, Lu Thirty-Eight looked at Zhang Jing with eager eyes and cautiously added,  

*"Master, um... would it be possible for you to purchase some more of that *River of Time Golden Sand*? With those treasures, I could accelerate the growth of these Immortal Roots by several dozen times."*  

*"Haha, how much do you need?"* Zhang Jing asked with a hearty laugh, his tone generous.  

Though he was currently short on fortune, that was only relative to the cost of purchasing *River of Time Golden Crystals*.  

As for the Golden Sand, spending a couple million units of fortune to buy a modest amount was well within his means.  

Hearing his laughter, Lu Thirty-Eight visibly relaxed, the apprehension on his face fading away.  

*"Master, we don't need too much—just fifty thousand grains. No, thirty thousand... twenty thousand grains would suffice."*  

He spoke tentatively, carefully observing his master's expression.  

*"Two hundred thousand grains!"*  

Zhang Jing declared calmly.  

*"For now, I'll give you two hundred thousand grains of River of Time Golden Sand. We can discuss more later if needed."*  

*"Two hundred thousand?!"*  

Lu Thirty-Eight exclaimed in shock.  

His mouth hung open as he swallowed hard, his eyes glazing over in disbelief.  

*Two hundred thousand grains...* Good heavens, was he dreaming?  

Since when had his master become so extravagantly generous?  

At that moment, a teasing voice sounded beside him:  

*"What? You don't want it?"*  

Lu Thirty-Eight shuddered.  

*"I do! I do! Master, I want it!"*  

......  

Time passed slowly.  

*"Haha, Junior Brother Zhang Jing, your senior brother has come to visit. Why not come out and greet me?"*  

A booming, rough voice tinged with arrogance suddenly reverberated across the celestial island.  

The sound reached the cultivation chamber, forcibly interrupting Zhang Jing's meditation.  

Seated on his meditation mat, Zhang Jing frowned slightly, a trace of displeasure flashing across his face.  

*How rude!*  

*"The voice sounds familiar... Someone from the Celestial Court lineage? What business could they possibly have with me?"*  

A cold, emotionless murmur echoed in the chamber as Zhang Jing's figure vanished instantly.  

......  

Outside the island.  

Zhang Jing's calm gaze swept over the thousand-zhang-tall giant clad in beast hides, exuding an aura of primal wilderness.  

*"So it's Senior Brother Qing Fang. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?"*  

Zhang Jing spoke evenly, neither submissive nor overbearing.  

Under the overwhelming pressure of the giant's ocean-like aura, Zhang Jing—still only at the Foundation Establishment realm—resembled a small boat navigating a boundless storm, seemingly on the verge of capsizing at any moment.  

Yet, not a trace of fear showed on his face.  

After all, this was the *Chiming Taihao Cave Heaven*.  

*"Haha,"* the giant laughed heartily. *"No need to be nervous, Junior Brother. I'm merely here to deliver an invitation. The Welcoming Immortal Banquet six months from now—I hope you'll grace us with your presence!"*  

As he spoke, a beam of immortal light shot from his hand, crossing ten thousand zhang in an instant before stopping before Zhang Jing and transforming into an exquisitely crafted invitation adorned with gold and jade.  

Zhang Jing accepted the invitation lightly, then looked up—only to find the thousand-zhang giant had already vanished without a trace.  

*"Tsk, *Primal Glaze Immortal Gold*, *Spirit God Jade*... The Celestial Court lineage truly spares no expense. I wonder how much fortune this could fetch if sold?"*  

He rubbed the invitation between his fingers, amused by the thought.  

Just as he was about to turn and leave, however...  

A flash of bronze divine light suddenly appeared before him, coalescing into a familiar figure.  

*"Junior Brother, prepare yourself. This senior brother will take you to the *Jade Hua Mountain Dao Gate Ancestral Court* shortly."*  

Feng Wuyu's voice whispered softly in his ear.  

Zhang Jing froze momentarily.  

*Jade Hua Mountain Dao Gate Ancestral Court?*
