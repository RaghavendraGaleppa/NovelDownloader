# Chapter 454: The Old Beggar's Spring in Winter

The old beggar's steamed buns were obtained through his daytime begging. At irregular intervals, he would sit beneath the memorial archways of various ancestral halls, where kind passersby would give him copper coins. Once he accumulated ten coins, he would buy food like steamed buns.

Occasionally, he would venture outside the city walls. Sitting at the base of the towering, majestic ramparts, he would gaze at an empty stretch of land ahead, watching the constant flow of people coming and going through the city gates.
