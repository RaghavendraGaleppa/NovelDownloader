**Chapter 24: A Major Case**

Under the faint night, mountains stood in parallel, covered in pristine white snow, filling the forest. Strange birds circled low, and the cries of mountain beasts occasionally echoed nearby.

As icy snowflakes landed on his hair, Qin Ming felt deeply satisfied. Although his journey into the mountains today had been incredibly perilous, the rewards far exceeded his expectations. The nourishment for his Second Rebirth was now sufficient, signifying a significant boost to his strength.

Qin Ming stood amidst the wind and snow, gazing at the blood-stained forest. He hadn't wanted to do this, but the other party had left him no choice. Since they had bestowed such a "heavy gift," he had to properly lay them to rest. May the deceased rest in peace; there was no need for cold armor in death. He stripped off the black gold armor, thoroughly searched the body from head to toe, then moved the corpse deep into the dense forest, leaving it for the mountain beasts to consume.

"What a magnificent sword!" Qin Ming's hand caressed the long sword, which gleamed like a clear spring. He lightly swung it through the night, and brilliant sword light streaked across the sky like a bolt of silk. However, he couldn't take it out of the mountains, which was a great pity. This sword was far superior to Fu Entao's long saber. After he cleaved the blood snake, his saber was full of nicks, yet this sword, wielded by the ashen-faced man to slay the blood snake, remained sharp and smooth as a mirror.

Qin Ming swiftly cleared the battlefield, leaving what needed to be consumed by beasts and burying what needed to be buried. This group hailed from Scarlet Glow City, so everything had to be thoroughly cleaned up. Both the long sword and its owner's black armor were the finest weaponry he had encountered so far, but they could only be left behind in the mountains.

"I'll dig them up when I need them."

Evidently, the weapons left by Fu Entao, Feng Yi'an, and the others were obsolete, severely damaged during the confrontation with the blood snake. Each of the men carried Night Silver, and the strongest among them even had thirteen pieces of Day Gold.

"Indeed, one cannot get rich without ill-gotten gains, just as a horse cannot get fat without extra fodder at night," Qin Ming sighed. Yet, these pieces of Day Gold were stained with blood, and he wished not to experience such encounters often. Unfortunately, the Meditation Art and Intent-Qi Art, which he valued most, were nowhere to be found. But upon reflection, it was understandable; who would carry scriptures and secret manuals when venturing into the mountains?

Qin Ming began his journey back, hunting a massive wild ox along the way. After cleaning its internal organs, he stuffed the blood snake inside and sewed up its belly. The journey was uneventful, and he safely returned home.

"Fu Entao and Feng Yi'an have been dead for two days now, why hasn't the news broken yet?" Qin Ming mused, guessing it wouldn't be long. After all, the mountain rangers who had gone to confront the blood snake had sent people to scout Fu Entao's stronghold and discovered that several wooden cabins had vanished.

In fact, the day after Fu Entao, Feng Yi'an, and others disappeared, someone sensed that something was amiss. The catalytic liquid required for the Black Moon plants cultivated in the Fire Spring had been prepared, but when the time came, the head of that mountain patrol team never came to collect it. When Fu Entao failed to appear for two consecutive days, and Feng Yi'an and Shao Chengfeng also didn't go carousing in Silver Vine Town, those involved realized that something serious might have happened.

After lunch, Qin Ming began his serious blade practice. He stood in the courtyard, swinging his long-handled black gold hammer. Slowly, he stirred up the snow in the courtyard, creating a scene of goose-down flakes swirling. The great hammer cleaved the air, faintly producing sounds of wind and thunder. He continued until his body was scorching hot, unleashing his strongest hammer-saber strike, which shattered the wind and snow around him. Only then did he stop, standing in the courtyard drenched in sweat, feeling thoroughly invigorated.

Qin Ming gained new insights into the combat saber techniques recorded in the blade manual. He stood still for a long time, grasping those feelings and carefully contemplating them. Afterward, he began studying "Harmonizing with the Dust and Concealing One's Brilliance," meditating on stillness and emptiness, concealing his vital energy, and obscuring his divine essence. As he delved deeper, he gained increasing proficiency.

As twilight neared its end, Xu Yueping returned from outside with an extremely solemn expression, then summoned all the newly awakened ones in the village. "Something big has happened this time!" His simple words immediately made everyone tense.

"What's the situation?" someone asked.

"Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and the others likely... got completely wiped out by a mountain monster, *pfft*!" As he spoke the last words, Xu Yueping couldn't hold back and let out a chuckle. He quickly composed himself, as such a reaction couldn't be too obvious, lest it cause trouble if word got out. But the corners of his eyes and brows relaxed, and even his movements while brewing black ant tea became lighter.

"Really?" Yang Yongqing shot up. This was truly a major event.

Xu Yueping nodded, saying, "They've been missing for two days now. It's safe to assume they've met with ill fate."

Old Man Liu, being advanced in years, cared little for appearances. He simply said, "Hiss, the mountains are truly terrifying! Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and those scoundrels actually died? That mountain monster must be about to become a mountain god!"

"How does Uncle Xu know?" Qin Ming asked. As an eyewitness, he couldn't appear too calm, and he genuinely wanted to know the latest developments.

Xu Yueping replied, "Just recently, a large group of mountain rangers, dozens of them, stormed into Qing Sang Village, looking for Xu Kong, that distant relative of Second Cripple."

"Why him?"

"Because this time, only Qing Sang Village hasn't had Black Moon planted there, and Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and the others had visited Xu Kong there the day before the incident."

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming fell into a daze.

In Qing Sang Village, Xu Kong was dumbfounded. What was all this mess? Out of nowhere, he had become one of the suspects? That day, Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and the others had visited his home very politely. Even if those people had two more guts, they wouldn't dare threaten him. There couldn't possibly be a deadly feud between them, as they weren't on the same level. Yet now, the mountain patrol team had mobilized a large force, all heavily armored and armed, with iron arrows nocked. Several great masters had personally arrived, leading sixty to seventy mountain rangers to surround the place.

Meanwhile, the mountain patrol team that had previously attacked the Blood Bamboo Forest was also under scrutiny. Their captain, Liu Huaishan, was even trapped by several team leaders of similar rank.

"Everyone, what are you doing? Although I couldn't stand Fu Entao and his group, I would never directly slaughter them and put myself in a deadly situation," Liu Huaishan quickly said.

Someone spoke in a deep voice, "Then explain why your team has lost several members, why you recently took twelve extra sets of armor, and why you purchased large quantities of poison. Are you still not admitting it?"

"I... I've been terribly wronged!" Liu Huaishan was sweating profusely with anxiety as he explained, "We took the armor and bought the medicinal powders to hunt spiritual creatures in the Blood Bamboo Forest."

An elder scoffed, "That fits! The Blood Bamboo Forest is within the territory Fu Entao was responsible for. Their team had always wanted to hunt the blood snake. When you crossed into their territory, you must have had a bloody conflict with them. There's an even worse possibility: that you secretly attacked and harmed them when they and the blood snake were both severely wounded. Is that not so?"

"I..." Liu Huaishan nearly spat blood. Even he, listening to it, felt that all the pieces fit, and it seemed quite plausible.

"Do you have nothing to say?!"

Liu Huaishan hurriedly shook his head, desperately explaining loudly, "Esteemed Elder, please don't act! My fellow colleagues, please listen to me. We truly did not commit this bloody crime. However, I think I know who delivered the killing blow. We once saw an ashen-faced man single-handedly wielding a long sword to slay the blood snake. In that area these past two days, he was probably the only one with such strength..." Then, he added with a grave expression, "Most importantly, we clearly sensed his strong hostility towards us mountain rangers. He approached with his sword, intending to kill us!"

"Take them all away and interrogate them thoroughly!" an elder commanded with a stern face.

Several powerful elder experts looked grim. How many years had it been since such a serious incident occurred? An entire mountain patrol team wiped out! If it was man-made, it was undoubtedly a major case. All the mountain patrol teams in the area were mobilized, splitting up to investigate.

One such team arrived at Twin Tree Village, not only summoning Xu Yueping, Qin Ming, and the other newly awakened ones for questioning but also cornering several idlers in the village. "Are any of you here, or any of the newly awakened ones in your village, in conflict with the mountain patrol team? For example, did they have any disputes with Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and the others?" a mountain ranger sternly asked the idlers, which included Ma Yang, Wang Youping, and Hu Yong—the three who had tried to intercept Qin Ming's prey at the village entrance when he was recovering from his serious illness.

"What are you looking at? We're asking you questions, answer truthfully!" The mountain ranger had no patience for them.

"Uncle Xu is always kind, and Old Man Liu's legs are weak..." Ma Yang replied. From afar, Old Man Liu bristled with anger upon hearing this, wishing he could roll up his sleeves and go beat him up.

"Qin Ming, though young Qin has beaten us before, I can't falsely accuse him for no reason. He's the least likely. He only recently became awakened, and he's very kind-hearted and peaceful. He shared a lot of the prey he brought back from the mountains with the villagers, and even shared meat with us, putting aside past grievances." Ma Yang, Wang Youping, and Hu Yong answered consecutively, stating that all the newly awakened ones in the village were very good and had never had any disputes or conflicts with anyone.

The group of mountain rangers turned and left without lingering. Their team was merely performing a routine duty and had to rush to the next village.

That night, Liu Huaishan and his few surviving subordinates, even though they weren't skilled at drawing, gritted their teeth and sketched, revising again and again, until they finally produced a portrait of Wang Nianzhu's heroic figure as he slew the blood snake with his sword. A stack of Wang Nianzhu's portraits was sent out immediately, swiftly distributed to all the towns.

That night, Qin Ming and Xu Yueping leisurely drank an aged wine that Old Man Liu had dug out from under his bed. The three of them had a small drink, all in excellent spirits.

"Heh, last time little Qin was still cursing, saying so many 'what ifs,' and it actually came true! They really were dragged away by a mountain monster!" Xu Yueping was in a cheerful mood, intoxicated by happiness rather than the wine itself, already feeling light-headed after just a few cups.

"I told you, even Heaven couldn't stand them. Something was bound to happen sooner or later," Qin Ming said, his face not red and his heart not pounding, using "Heaven" to refer to himself. He was in high spirits now because he was about to prepare for his Second Rebirth. He suddenly found that the taste of this aged wine was actually quite good.

Old Man Liu's heart ached. "Alas, this is my ten-year-old treasured wine, only this one jar. From now on, there won't be a single drop of wine left at home."

"Old Man Liu, don't feel bad. I'll respectfully give you ten jars in the future. Let's talk about the Second Rebirth. I've been feeling something again lately, my body seems to be heating up."

"My goodness... are you a monster?!"

***

Late at night, Qin Ming retrieved the blood snakes from his home. The wound on the second large snake was very deep. Qin Ming judged that besides the ashen-faced man's long sword being incredibly sharp, his strength must also have been formidable, likely surpassing his own. Coupled with the opponent's greater speed, if they were to clash directly and fight to the death, Qin Ming truly might have been in danger.

A hint of gloom settled in Qin Ming's heart. All sorts of monstrous beings were now emerging from the mountains; it was truly becoming more and more dangerous. However, when he thought that the ashen-faced man had already undergone his Second Rebirth, his mindset became very calm again. His current strength granted him a thousand *jin* of power in his arms. If he underwent his Second Rebirth, he would be able to lift a two-thousand *jin* tripod, far exceeding the records of the naturally gifted individuals in Scarlet Glow City. At the very least, there had been no such shocking records in Scarlet Glow City for the past several centuries.

"Everything is ready. It's time for my Second Rebirth..."
