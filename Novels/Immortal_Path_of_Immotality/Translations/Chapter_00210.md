# Chapter 208: The Arrival of the Golden Core Cultivator

The Dai family soon realized the situation was more complicated than they had anticipated. They decided to take Bear Mountain Superior back to Wangyue City as their captive.

Before leaving, they didn't forget to set fire to the Lin Family Fish Farm outside the city, burning it to the ground.

Helpless against his captors, Bear Mountain Superior could only watch as these Dai family bandits not only beat him up on his own territory but also slaughtered his subordinates and wantonly destroyed his newly built fish farm. As the flames roared, all his previous efforts turned to ashes, along with his beautiful illusions about the future.

Having just arrived in Lu Country intending to turn over a new leaf, an inexplicable bitterness welled up in his heart, and his eyes couldn't help but moisten.

These bastards were simply too much!

---

"Creak~"

In the damp, dim underground of a certain cave dwelling in Wangyue City, the Dai family had temporarily converted a cramped space into a prison. They tied Bear Mountain Superior to a post.

Of course, both the iron post and ropes were made from materials at least suitable for high-grade magical instruments, ensuring Bear Mountain Superior couldn't escape.

Still not satisfied, Dai Budong used a Spirit-Sealing Talisman to suppress his cultivation and pasted another talisman on his forehead to seal his Mud Pill Palace, making escape utterly impossible.

"Snap! Snap!"

A Dai family disciple cracked a whip on the ground twice before looking at Bear Mountain Superior with malicious intent, sending chills down his spine.

"Sizzle~"

Another Dai family member held a branding iron over a brazier, a perverse excitement flashing across his lips, making Bear Mountain Superior's buttocks clench involuntarily.

"Scrape, scrape~"

Yet another Dai disciple sharpened a cleaver, licking his lips with a cruel glint in his eyes.

Bear Mountain Superior's heart pounded with fear. These people were absolute savages!

Weren't they all supposed to be educated? Is this how your academy teachers taught you to behave? Isn't Lu Country supposed to be the domain of Confucianism? Why does it feel more like demonic cultivation here?

The Dai family members claimed they were being quite mild—these methods were merely borrowed from mortal government offices. They wouldn't resort to the demonic practices of soul extraction, skinning, or blood draining.

Yet even so, Bear Mountain Superior suffered immensely. Without his cultivation, he had no way to resist the torture, and his agonized screams echoed through the prison.

For days, he cried to the heavens and earth, but no help came.

Finally, after prolonged torment, Bear Mountain Superior was left half-dead and in unbearable pain.

Dai Budong sat imposingly before him and began the interrogation.

---

"What's your real name? Don't give me any aliases!"

"Bear Mountain... Bear Mountain Superior."

"Then where is the Wanliu Academy you mentioned when you impersonated Bu Peiying?"

"What Wanliu Academy? I don't know what you're talking about..."

Seeing his denial, Dai Budong signaled his subordinates to continue the torture.

"Ah!~~~ Ouch!~~~ Agh!~~~"

No matter what methods they used, the results proved that this bearded man was indeed his true appearance, with no traces of disguise.

Zhu Duiyou frowned. Could it be that Bear Mountain Superior and the white-robed youth from back then were truly not the same person?

He took over the questioning:

"What is your relationship with Pure Lotus Hermit?"

"He's my master."

"You actually have a Nascent Soul stage master?"

"Y-yes..."

Everyone was shocked, their suspicions resurfacing.

"Where is he now? Do you know?"

"No, I'm looking for him too."

Though barely able to breathe, Bear Mountain Superior didn't miss the chance to name-drop. He hadn't expected Pure Lotus Hermit's reputation to reach Lu Country, so far from the Eastern Sea of Great Song.

His master was actually this formidable!

A glimmer of hope ignited in his heart, hoping this might buy him some mercy.

But the Dai family had already steeled themselves. Your master is currently being hunted by both righteous and demonic factions, struggling to survive—how could he possibly come to your rescue?

Moreover, this was Dai Budong's only chance to turn things around. If they couldn't recover the stolen funds, they were all doomed. With nothing to lose, they were willing to risk offending a Nascent Soul cultivator.

Thinking of the stolen funds, Dai Budong couldn't help but ask, given Bear Mountain Superior's pitifully meager possessions:

"Where did the money go from selling our Dai family's properties in Wangyue City these past few days?"

Bear Mountain Superior looked utterly confused. "What stolen funds? Selling properties? What are you talking about? I'm just a small-time worker!"

Dai Budong signaled his men, who immediately understood and resumed the torture.

"Ah~~~ No~~~"

Bear Mountain Superior's agonized screams, muffled by the underground prison, echoed as blood stained his robes.

No matter how they tortured him, he refused to admit anything.

---

"Then where is the formation puppet your master gave you? Why don't we see it?"

"What formation puppet? I don't have one!"

"Nonsense! Your master is a Nascent Soul powerhouse—how could he not give you a life-saving treasure?"

"Well... I did have one, but I used it during the journey from Great Song to Lu Country when I was in danger."

Traversing countless treacherous lands over the years would be nearly impossible for a Foundation Establishment cultivator without a Golden Core stage protector. Bear Mountain Superior had no choice but to use his master's life-saving talisman.

Otherwise, the Dai family wouldn't have been able to capture him so easily.

But this was just his side of the story. The Dai family, unsure of its truth, intensified the torture.

After another round of screams, Bear Mountain Superior was left with festering wounds, some deep enough to reveal bone, a pitiful sight.

"Then tell us, how did you ambush our clan's Golden Core elder and kill him? Where are the magic treasures and jade slip you stole?"

"I... I didn't... I really don't know what you're talking about... ugh..."

Bear Mountain Superior's vision blurred, blood bubbling in his throat, nearly driven to madness by the torture.

The Dai family finally relented, slapping a few cheap healing talismans on him to keep him alive.

They all turned to Zhu Duiyou for guidance.

"Brother Zhu, judging from today's encounter, this man doesn't seem capable of killing our clan's elder. Could we have the wrong person?"

Zhu Duiyou pondered for a long time, reviewing all the details, before nodding.

"Indeed, the true culprit likely isn't him. He might just be a scapegoat, taking the fall for that white-robed youth."

"And since the white-robed youth could impersonate others and knew his master was the Nascent Soul powerhouse Pure Lotus Hermit, he must have some grudge against Bear Mountain Superior—likely an old acquaintance."

"From the interrogation, Bear Mountain Superior claims to be from distant Great Song. That white-robed youth must also be from abroad, possibly also from Great Song."

"Therefore..."

Zhu Duiyou stepped forward, lifting Bear Mountain Superior's chin with a stern question:

"Tell me, who among your enemies would use your name to spread notoriety?"

Bear Mountain Superior's mind sluggishly worked through the question. After much deliberation, he couldn't pinpoint the culprit. As a former bandit, he'd made countless enemies—who could say which one was now using his name?

"I... don't know."

Zhu Duiyou, undeterred, pressed on:

"List all your enemies. Take your time!"

"Mirror Sun Daoist, Dharma Cave Master, Guangshan Nun, Pure Gem Monk, the Seven Jining Masters, the Four Distant Sea Fiends..."

Bear Mountain Superior mumbled, listing every enemy he'd ever made.

Even the Dai family members were taken aback by the sheer number of grudges he'd accumulated.

But Zhu Duiyou suddenly waved his sleeve, cutting him off.

"Never mind those. Tell me, do you have any enemies who are white-robed youths?"

"White-robed youths? Well... about five, including..."

"He wielded pure wind and thunder spiritual power, carried a Five Elements fan, and his defensive artifact was a pockmarked mirror..."

"Lin Shan! The Black Lotus Sect's Altar Guardian, the missionary leader of the Kaya Islands—Lin Shan!"

With these details, Bear Mountain Superior had an epiphany and suddenly shouted the name.

The iron post and chains behind him rattled violently.

Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou exchanged glances—finally, the truth was coming to light!

The Lin Family Trading Company.

Lin Shan.

It all added up.

This little brat had finally revealed his true colors!

Dai Budong ordered his men to reinforce the chains while dousing Bear Mountain Superior with another bucket of cold water.

"Speak! Tell us everything you know about this Lin Shan!"

"No need!"

A thunderous voice suddenly boomed from behind, shaking the underground prison. Dust rained from the ceiling as an overwhelming aura surged forth, like a tiger breaking free from its cage.

The Dai family members were stunned.

What was this?

Had someone come to their doorstep?

Turning around, they saw a white-haired, youthful elder in golden sable robes striding in.

"Ancestor?"

"Great Uncle!"

"Greetings, Elder Rongjin!"

Dai Budong, the Dai family disciples, and Zhu Duiyou all bowed deeply. The Dai family's Golden Core elder had arrived far sooner than expected!

After all, it had been less than five days since the previous Dai family Golden Core elder's death. Dai Budong's team had only sent their findings back to the clan yesterday.

Normally, the messenger would take two days to deliver the information. The clan would then deliberate, verify the details in Wangyue City, and only then make a final decision.

Yet, against all expectations, before the messenger could even return, the Dai family's Golden Core elder had already arrived!

And not just any Golden Core elder—it was the clan's Grand Elder in name and fact.

Elder Rongjin!

As one of Lu Country's mining giants, the Dai family's prominence wasn't solely due to their five Golden Core elders at their peak. More importantly, they had a late Golden Core elder—Elder Rongjin—guarding their interests, deterring all challengers.

In the mining industry, controlling vast spiritual mineral resources naturally attracted envy. But with Elder Rongjin's late Golden Core strength—invincible short of a Nascent Soul cultivator—no one dared provoke them.

Three hundred years ago, under Elder Rongjin's leadership, the Dai family had grown from two Golden Core elders to five, rising to become a dominant force—the architect of their resurgence.

Such a figure was a heavyweight in Lu Country's cultivation world. Typically, he would remain in secluded cultivation within the clan, emerging only during existential crises. Even after death, his passing would be concealed for decades to keep enemies guessing.

Yet now, this legendary elder stood before them in the flesh.

"Ancestor, why have you emerged from seclusion?"

Dai Budong was both awed and nervous. The clan elder's sudden appearance, without prior notice, left him scrambling to make a proper reception, fearing any misstep might leave a poor impression.

Elder Rongjin, though exuding an imposing aura, spoke with warmth.

"After years of facing stone walls in seclusion, I grew restless. Hearing of our clan's loss, I decided to come out for some air before the news even reached me."

The group kept their heads bowed—direct eye contact would be disrespectful.

"Actually, I've been here for a while. You juniors have accomplished much in just five days. The clan chose well in sending you."

"Not bad."

These two simple words from Elder Rongjin sent tremors of excitement through the group.

Such was the power of authority—a mere word of praise from a superior could invigorate subordinates, making them feel valued, even if it was just basic leadership tactics.

Dai Budong hurriedly bowed. "You flatter us, Ancestor. We merely did our duty—"

"Nonsense. Finding this key figure and uncovering useful information in such short time is commendable."

Elder Rongjin waved him off, praising Dai Budong generously while eyeing Zhu Duiyou with appreciation.

"Young man, you don't seem to be of the Dai family, yet you carry yourself with uncommon wisdom. You must be someone of note."

Zhu Duiyou, dressed in scholarly robes with a feather fan, remained composed—unlike the starstruck Dai family members. With a slight bow, he replied:

"You honor me, Elder. This humble one is Zhu Duiyou, disciple of Jingyang Academy, currently serving as Advisor to Brother Dai. My contributions are trivial, hardly worthy of your attention."

Elder Rongjin saw through his modesty. A Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator at such a young age, with solid foundations and sharp intellect—this was no ordinary talent. That he'd deign to advise Dai Budong spoke volumes.

"Haha, you're too modest. For Dai Budong to have your counsel is sheer luck. With your help, he might even contend for the clan leadership!"

This remark electrified the room.

Dai Budong couldn't hide his delight. While the succession process was fair and transparent, having the Grand Elder's endorsement was a monumental advantage.

Once word spread, many clan elders might shift their support to him, attracting more followers.

But pleasantries aside, they couldn't entertain the elder in a dungeon forever. The group soon escorted him to a proper reception hall upstairs.

As for Bear Mountain Superior, still chained and half-dead, they left him under guard—both to prevent escape and to keep him alive.

---

Meanwhile, Lin Shan received alarming news: the newly built Lin Family Fish Farm outside the city had been burned to the ground by unknown assailants. All workers were slaughtered, and Bear Mountain Superior had been abducted.

"What?!"

Black Skeleton Demon Lord and Lü Xiuming were shocked. Who would sabotage them out of the blue? A business rival?

But they'd monopolized Wangyue City's aquatic trade—there shouldn't be any competitors.

"Brother, should we investigate—"

"No. We mustn't act rashly now."

Lin Shan paced his chamber, immediately sensing the danger.

The destruction of the fish farm was inconsequential—it could be rebuilt. But Bear Mountain Superior's abduction was deeply suspicious.

Lin Shan grew cautious, unwilling to venture outside recklessly.

He pointed at Lü Xiuming. "Send people to investigate the site discreetly—no reports to the city authorities. Treat it as an internal matter."

"Also, quietly check if the Dai family of cultivators has sent anyone to Wangyue City recently."

"If they have, find out where they're staying..."

A cold glint flashed in Lin Shan's eyes as schemes unfolded in his mind.
