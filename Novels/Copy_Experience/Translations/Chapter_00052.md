## Chapter 52: The Azure Wood Longevity Art

Inside a crudely excavated temporary cave, the Fourth Prince's body sat upright. He sat cross-legged, with Lu Xu's palms pressed against his back, seemingly treating his wounds. However, streams of blood qi continuously flowed out from the Fourth Prince's body and entered Lu Xu's. Within the blood qi, faint, roaring gaseous mini-dragons could be vaguely seen. They emitted a bright yellow light, drilling into Lu Xu's physical body along with the blood qi.

As more and more blood qi poured out of the Fourth Prince, Lu Xu's entire body turned a vivid red, as if he had been steamed. Meanwhile, the Fourth Prince's physical body steadily shriveled, gradually transforming from a formidable martial arts expert with abundant blood qi into a skeletal mummy.

Thud!

Lu Xu withdrew his hands, and the Fourth Prince's shriveled corpse toppled over.

Lu Xu stood up, brandishing his fists and practicing the Pine Crane Longevity Fist. Sharp ripping sounds tore through the air. Each of Lu Xu's punches felt as heavy as ten thousand jin, and the thunderous roars of tigers and leopards emanated from his bones. He slammed a fist into the nearby stone wall.

Immediately.

Boom!

Following a tremendous roar, a large section of shattered rock was blasted away, leaving dust swirling. Lu Xu retracted his fist and examined it, finding no scratches on his smooth, jade-like skin.

"What immense power! This body-tempering cultivation method truly refines the physical body as if it were a magic artifact!"

"No wonder cultivators who master it can withstand magic artifacts with their bare bodies! Without even relying on spiritual power, I could probably contend with Qi Condensation cultivators in the early stages!"

Lu Xu pulled out a low-grade first-tier Fireball Talisman. After activating the talisman, a fireball appeared out of thin air before his eyes. The fireball quietly hovered in the air, emitting a scorching aura, something cultivators' physical bodies would absolutely not dare to touch. Whether a Qi Condensation cultivator or a Foundation Establishment cultivator, if hit by a fireball without any defenses, they would suffer severe injuries, even if they didn't die. Although cultivators' physical bodies would strengthen with increased cultivation, they could never reach a point where they could withstand spiritual power attacks with just their bodies.

But body cultivators could!

Lu Xu reached out and slapped it.

Smack!

The fireball was instantly dispersed, and a burning sensation spread through Lu Xu's hand. He pulled his hand back to examine it. His palm was only slightly red, with no other changes.

"Not bad, not bad. From now on, the physical body aspect of Foundation Establishment should be no obstacle!"

Feeling the powerful blood qi within his body, Lu Xu smiled. From this day forward, he could somewhat be considered a dual cultivator of both spiritual and physical paths.

"If I could also acquire a cultivation method to temper my divine sense, then I would truly be progressing in all three aspects: essence, qi, and spirit!"

Looking at the corpse at his feet, now reduced to mere dregs, Lu Xu flicked out a fireball. Then, he looked inward, examining the changes on the azure stone tablet:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 30/131]
[Cultivation: Qi Condensation Seventh Layer, Body Refinement First Level]
[Spiritual Root: Wood (Mid-Lower Grade)]
[Cultivation Methods: Azure Wood Art (Great Completion): 1000/1000; Imperial Body Forging Art (Minor Achievement): 273/300]
[Replication Points: 12]

[Skills - Alchemy:]

[Skills - Talisman Creation:]

First-tier Mid-grade Talisman Master: 42/100 (3x)
First-tier High-grade Talisman Master: 13/100 (10x)

[Skills - Spells:]

Body Refinement First Level corresponded to the early stages of Qi Condensation; this was information Lu Xu had gathered previously while chatting with other cultivators in Tianmen City. Regarding body refinement, although very few people in the cultivation world pursued this path, there was still a fair amount of information circulating. Everyone knew that dual cultivation of both spiritual and physical paths was superior to cultivating only qi, yet body cultivators in the cultivation world remained exceedingly rare. This was primarily because body refinement was an extremely resource-intensive and arduous endeavor. Only a family like the Wei Clan could afford to support their core disciples in pursuing this path.

The Fourth Prince was actually older than Lu Xu; Lu Xu had only been cultivating for fifteen years to date. The Fourth Prince, on the other hand, had been cultivating for over twenty years. Yet his cultivation had only just reached Lu Xu's level. Logically speaking, given his aptitude and the resources he could obtain, this shouldn't have been the case, but his cultivation progress was indeed this slow. This was mainly because he had spent a lot of time and resources on body refinement in the early stages of his cultivation. Otherwise, he should be a Qi Condensation eighth or ninth-layer cultivator by now.

If Lu Xu hadn't used the Blood Seizing Grand Art to take the Fourth Prince's physical blood qi, then it would have probably taken him four or five years and a massive amount of resources to cultivate to Body Refinement First Level.

"It saved me quite a bit of time; I should thank the Fourth Prince!"

"For now, I'll put this body refinement path aside. Body Refinement First Level is sufficient for Foundation Establishment. I'll consider strengthening my physical body after reaching Foundation Establishment!"

After pondering for a moment, Lu Xu made this decision. In fact, ever since he reached Body Refinement First Level, the barrier of the sixty-year Heavenly Chasm should no longer be effective for him; it would definitely be pushed back by several years. Perhaps this Heavenly Chasm had become sixty-five or seventy years?

Lu Xu didn't know for sure, but he was certain that the rate of his blood qi decay would be much slower than that of cultivators who didn't practice body refinement. Nevertheless, Lu Xu still didn't plan to delay Foundation Establishment until his lifespan limit was approaching. Of course, the earlier one reached Foundation Establishment, the better.

After incinerating the Fourth Prince's corpse, Lu Xu opened the two storage bags to examine their contents. The guard's possessions weren't particularly wealthy; aside from a high-grade magic artifact, there were only a little over two hundred spirit stones, with nothing else worth noting. The Fourth Prince's possessions, however, were quite abundant: a high-grade magic artifact, over four hundred spirit stones, and a bottle of Qi Gathering Pills.

Lu Xu opened the bottle and saw four pills lying quietly inside. Each Qi Gathering Pill was worth thirty spirit stones, making them the best auxiliary pills for late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators to advance their spiritual power. Not only were these pills expensive, but they were also generally hard to come by. The spiritual herbs required to refine Qi Gathering Pills were themselves very rare, and coupled with the truly small number of high-grade alchemists, this led to the pills rarely appearing on the market, unlike Qi Replenishing Pills and Qi Nourishing Pills, which were widely circulated.

"It's said there are only about six or seven high-grade alchemists in the entire Wei State, which is truly pathetic!"

"However, the Myriad Immortals City I'm about to go to is said to have many alchemists. That's exactly the place for me!"

Lu Xu couldn't help but feel a little more anticipation for Myriad Immortals City.

He continued to take items out of the Fourth Prince's storage bag. There was a flying magic artifact. It didn't seem as good as the Azure Wind Boat, but its quality was decent. After playing with it for a bit, Lu Xu carefully put it away. There was also a cultivation method with 'Imperial Body Forging Art' written on its cover. It was precisely the Wei Clan's martial body forging art. Lu Xu opened it and saw that its contents included cultivation chants for Body Refinement First Level to Third Level.

"So, it's only for the Qi Condensation stage?"

"It seems so. I've never heard of any body cultivators from the Wei Clan comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators. Perhaps their family's cultivation method only has this portion!"

Lu Xu put away the cultivation method and continued to search through the storage bag. Soon, he discovered another cultivation method:

"The Azure Wood Longevity Art?"
