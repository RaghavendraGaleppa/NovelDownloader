# Chapter 72: If I'm Not Afraid, Why Should You Be?

The night was enchanting, yet the beauty mark on the woman's face betrayed her inner turmoil. Her cheeks burned, the heat spreading to the tips of her ears as she tightly clutched her wine cup, eyes closed and lashes fluttering, struggling to suppress the waves of desire surging within her spring-filled heart.

Summoning all her courage and steeling both body and mind for what was to come, she was caught off guard when Wang Chan, unhurried and composed, merely picked up his chopsticks from beneath the table, emerged, and gently set them down. "Is this Thousand-Leaf Begonia Spirit Wine too strong for you?" he asked with concern.

His utterly unromantic tone snapped the beauty mark-adorned woman back from her cloud-nine fantasy. With a sigh of disappointment, she shot him a glare at his serious demeanor. "Master Wang, when you went under the table to pick up your chopsticks, was that really all you did?"

"Was there something else you wanted me to retrieve, Lady Tian?" Wang Chan asked, genuinely puzzled.

Annoyed, the woman downed her wine in one gulp and turned her head away. At that moment, she'd rather gaze at the flowers and grass than face Wang Chan's feigned ignorance.

"Since Lady Tian is on leave and hasn't returned, wouldn't Master Bai be worried?" Wang Chan abruptly changed the subject after a brief silence.

"He hasn't come back yet," she replied instinctively.

"Oh? Has the matter in Green Mountain City not been resolved?" Wang Chan probed.

"He went to the Canglan Kingdom with several elders!" she retorted, turning back to him with a smirk. The warm glow in the courtyard flickered in her eyes, her thoughts inscrutable. Cheerfully, she added, "He won't be back for at least ten years!"

The Canglan Kingdom was one of the southeastern neighbors of the Misty Cloud Kingdom, equally powerful but dominated by unorthodox sects, unlike the Misty Cloud Kingdom where orthodox factions held sway. However, the Misty Cloud Kingdom was vast, and White Mountain City lay deep within its heart. The journey to Canglan spanned tens of thousands of miles—a Qi Refining cultivator traveling alone wouldn't last a year, let alone a decade. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle without a safe route.

Hearing this news, Wang Chan secretly sighed in relief. While He Changkong's words might not be entirely trustworthy, and his own deductions weren't foolproof, Bai Shaofeng's absence was undoubtedly good news. It removed a significant potential threat. Given another decade to grow, Wang Chan would likely undergo a remarkable transformation. By then, even if Bai Shaofeng returned with murderous intent, he'd be of little concern.

But why would Bai Shaofeng and the Bai family travel all the way to Canglan?

Noticing Wang Chan's initial relief followed by a frown, the beauty mark's smile deepened. She explained, "The Misty Cloud Sect's 'Zhaoyan Zhenren' is domineering and formidable. As a former true disciple and now an elder, her background, roots, and influence far surpass those of ordinary Yin Spirit cultivators. Whether it's a Foundation Establishment family or clan, they're nothing in her eyes."

"Zhaoyan Zhenren... is she a female cultivator?" Wang Chan mused, catching the title.

"Indeed, the youngest Yin Spirit cultivator in the Misty Cloud Sect," the woman replied with a playful glint in her eye. "Rumor has it her first act after condensing her Yin Spirit was to slay her own Dao companion. Now, she's a widow..."

Wang Chan's heart skipped a beat. That was intense! Moreover, if the beauty mark's words held truth, why would a cultivator of Zhaoyan Zhenren's stature come to a backwater like the White Mountain region? The Misty Cloud Sect could've sent any Yin Spirit cultivator to deal with the Qiu family's patriarch—there was no need for such overkill.

Seeing Wang Chan's unease, the woman continued with relish, "Additionally, the Qiu family, a Yin Spirit clan that migrated south from Blackwater City, has reportedly seen their patriarch recover from his injuries. They're surely plotting something big."

Wang Chan nodded. Before the arrival of the Yin Spirit cultivators, the Bai family, though unwilling to provoke the Enforcement Hall, wasn't overly intimidated since the Hall's strongest member was only at the late Foundation Establishment stage. In a way, the Bai family was another towering presence in the White Mountain region. But with a Yin Spirit cultivator now in the picture, the Bai family's days were numbered.

"As for the Wei family, two hundred years ago, one of their clansmen joined the Qingyang Sect and recently condensed his Yin Spirit. Though he can't return personally, his Wei family roots make him a formidable ally in critical moments."

"The Bai family has sent many members to the seven major sects over the years, but the strongest among them are only at the late Foundation Establishment stage, with no hope of condensing a Yin Spirit anytime soon."

Lowering her voice, the woman activated a Soundproofing Talisman and added, "Given these circumstances, in twenty years, the Bai family might be in dire straits. As a last resort, their patriarch sent several elders and promising disciples to seek aid from their ancestral clan in Canglan."

"Ancestral clan?" Wang Chan was puzzled.

"Seven hundred years ago, the Bai family's patriarch came from the Canglan Kingdom to establish roots here. The Bai family there is a Yin Spirit clan," she explained.

"Ah, I see," Wang Chan said, enlightened.

As the woman elaborated on these grand schemes, Wang Chan felt both awed and overwhelmed, wondering when he'd condense his Yin Spirit and how he'd stand firm amid such turbulent times.

Suddenly, the woman leaned across the table, pressing close to Wang Chan's ear. "Master Wang, you keep bringing up Bai Shaofeng—are you afraid of him?" Her breath was warm, her hair brushing his face.

Wang Chan could feel the heat of her skin and the subtle movement of her fingers on her cup. "Of course. A scion of a Foundation Establishment clan? How could a wilderness rogue cultivator like me not be afraid?" He turned slightly to meet her gaze. "Shouldn't I be?"

She giggled. "If I'm not afraid, why should you be?"

"Can I afford not to be?"

"Of course—ah!"

Passion ignited like lightning meeting fire, the night brimming with untamed desire.

Soon, all was ready—except for one thing.

Just then, delicate hands pressed against Wang Chan's chest. The beauty mark, radiant as mutton-fat jade, pleaded tenderly, "In this vast wilderness and endless sea of people, meeting you is fate's gift. If you achieve your desires, promise me this—that I'll be the only one from now on."

The wild fervor in Wang Chan's eyes cooled instantly. He released her, stepped back, and calmly straightened his robes. Wiping his hands with her discarded undergarment, he said evenly, "Lady Tian, you're drunk. Tonight's gathering ends here. If we meet again, remember this fleeting bond and spare this humble rogue cultivator any trouble."

With that, he retrieved Golden Snake Madam's storage pouch, took two mid-grade Thunder Sword Talismans and a jade hairpin for himself, and left the rest beside the reclining woman.

The path of cultivation was long. Wang Chan knew his heart—while a dalliance with the beauty mark was pleasant, he couldn't forsake boundless forests for a single tree. Besides, the future was unpredictable. He couldn't—and wouldn't—make promises.

The warmth in the woman's eyes froze into ice. Her face flushed and paled in turns, murderous intent flickering in her gaze. Born into a Foundation Establishment clan, blessed with mid-grade spiritual roots and profound opportunities—including the mid-grade Autumn Wind Cicada and the secretly cultivated high-grade Spring Moon Cicada as her lifebound companion—she had the potential to forge a superior foundation and even aspire to Yin Spirit cultivation. With time, she might elevate her cicada to the supreme-grade Moonwhite Cicada, granting her a sliver of hope for Yang Spirit ascension.

To her, such prospects were beyond most wildest dreams. What more could a man want? Unless... there was another woman in his heart?

But the Spring Longing Art required mutual affection—it couldn't be forced. Why else would she demean herself like this?

Tears of frustration rolled down her cheeks. After a moment, she bit her lip and whispered, "Women are easy to deceive." The Spring Longing Art thrived on exclusivity—the more devoted the partner, the greater its effects. A divided heart weakened its power, and in cultivation, even a slight shortfall could take centuries to overcome.

She couldn't bear to miss this chance.

"Lady Tian, I understand your feelings," Wang Chan said, meeting her gaze. "Some things are best left to fate. Forcing them only brings harm."

Silent, she rose, donned a fresh black robe, and tied her hair simply with a violet ribbon, letting it cascade down her back. Then she stepped close, her burning gaze locked onto his. "Is there another woman in your heart more important than me?"

Wang Chan hesitated, about to shake his head when—knock, knock, knock—a series of genteel raps echoed through the night.

"Who is it?" he called.

"A humble maiden, Qu Lian."
