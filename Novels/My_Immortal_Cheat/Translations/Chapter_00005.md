# Chapter 5: Powerful Skills

“Since they voluntarily admitted their guilt and didn't act on their intentions, to demonstrate our magnanimity, it wasn't appropriate to act directly. So Emperor Qin merely imposed a symbolic punishment,” Zhou Yi began. “And the Sect Master of Haotian Sect, fearing future reckoning, pleaded for a marriage alliance with our imperial family. Although Haotian Sect is a powerful ally, they did harbor rebellious intentions once. Our collateral branches of the Zhou family truly don't dare to form such a marriage alliance, fearing they might lose their heads over this one day…”

Zhou Yi paused, then continued, “The only ones who dared to form a marriage alliance with them were the direct imperial lineage. And none of my royal brothers have unmarried children. After all, she is a personal disciple of the Haotian Sect Master; her status isn't low. Marrying someone already engaged would ruin their reputation; they might as well rebel directly. My imperial brother’s sons are too deeply involved and cannot form such an alliance, so this task fell to you.”

Fearing Zhou Tian might become rebellious, Zhou Yi further explained, “However, my imperial brother consulted me about this matter. He only bestowed the marriage after I agreed. I’ve seen the girl; she’s beautiful and not a deeply scheming woman. You won't regret this engagement.”

*Consulted your opinion…? Did he consult *my* opinion?*

Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Yi helplessly. These people still clung to feudalistic ideas: parents’ orders, matchmakers’ words. But at least she was a pretty girl, so Zhou Tian didn't say much more.

“Then why is she living here? Shouldn't it just be an engagement? Marriage wouldn't be so soon, right?” Zhou Tian asked. Hearing Zhou Yi’s words, it seemed her living arrangements were already made. It looked like she would be staying here for a while.

“Indeed, I don’t know what the Haotian Sect Master is thinking,” Zhou Yi replied. “A while ago, his ambition was higher than the heavens, but now he’s so cowardly. Fearing we’d make an example of him, he sent Tianling here, which counts as a gesture of sincerity, and also serves as a hostage. The Haotian Sect Master has no children; he raised Tianling from a young age and regards her like a daughter.”

“So that’s how it is.” Zhou Tian nodded, then suddenly remembered his cheat system seemed to have arrived. He quickly covered his forehead and said, “I suddenly feel a bit tired and want to rest for a while.”

“Are you feeling alright?” Zhou Yi asked with a frown, wondering why he suddenly felt tired.

“I’m fine,” Zhou Tian shook his head and said, “Just feel a bit sleepy.”

Zhou Yi glanced at him, a faint golden light flashing in his eyes. Zhou Tian felt a shiver run through him, as if he were naked. Seeing no signs of injury on him, Zhou Yi nodded reassuringly. “Then rest. I’ll take my leave.”

With that, he pushed the door open and left. Uncle Zhou was already waiting outside. Seeing Zhou Yi emerge, he stepped forward, and a black rune flashed in his hand, enveloping the vicinity. Only after ensuring no one could overhear their conversation did he whisper, “Patriarch, I’ve asked. The Young Master’s soul flame flickered out for an instant a while ago!”

“Are you certain?” Zhou Yi’s brows furrowed, his aura fluctuating.

“Old Zhan said so.” Uncle Zhou didn’t say “certain” or “uncertain,” merely stated a name.

“Then it’s confirmed!” Zhou Yi’s eyes narrowed slightly. A monstrous sea of blood surged behind him, countless spectral entities roaring within, and bloody tornadoes stirred up endless crimson waves! “It seems some people can’t hold back anymore!”

Although he was closest to Zhou Yi and the baleful blood qi surged around him, Uncle Zhou remained as still as a boulder in the sea, completely unperturbed. He spoke again, “Furthermore, news from the imperial palace indicates that the Dragon Luck on the Young Master’s body was eroded for a period, which perfectly matches the time his soul flame extinguished.”

“What exactly happened to Tian’er?” Zhou Yi’s brows furrowed deeply. “His soul flame extinguishing should mean he died, but why did it reignite? Even if someone seized his body, at most the body would come back to life, but the soul flame couldn’t reignite. Only a divine soul of the same origin can reignite a soul flame.”

“Old Zhan said it might be Young Master Tian’s own fortunate encounter,” Uncle Zhou bowed, speaking softly with an aged voice.

Zhou Yi was silent for a moment, then turned to glance at Zhou Tian’s room. His brows relaxed, his entire aura calming. He slowly said, “A fortunate encounter…?”

***

Inside the room.

After Zhou Yi left, Zhou Tian eagerly pondered how to open the Undying System he had just thought of. The moment the name came to mind, a purple box appeared before his eyes—it was indeed the Undying System. He had already seen its general layout, but he now examined it meticulously again, finding a yellow question mark button in the upper right corner.

He reached out and tapped the spot with his finger, but there was no response. He was stunned for a moment, then laughed self-deprecatingly. “It’s not a projection; tapping it with my hand is useless.”

He stared at the button, imagining pressing it. Sure enough, another purple interface popped up, densely covered with tiny text:

“Undying System…”

“All rights of final interpretation belong to the Undying System.”

Reading the last line, Zhou Tian let out a sigh of relief. The text was too long, like the security protocols you see when installing or registering software—mostly nonsense. But Zhou Tian, fearing there might be something important, read it obediently, not missing a single word.

An excited expression appeared on his face as Zhou Tian murmured, “If what it says is true, then I’ll have the capital to establish myself in this world.”

The greatest function of this Undying System was to make him immortal. This immortality wasn’t the kind where he couldn’t be harmed; rather, it meant he would revive after death, and his death count would accumulate. The death count would allow him to level up, granting him one skill point per level to learn skills. Skills, on the other hand, were a crucial function of the Undying System. According to the explanation he just read, every skill within the Undying System possessed unfathomable, incredibly powerful abilities.

He shifted his attention to the main interface, found the [Skills] tab, and tapped it. A purple window popped up, similar to a skill tree in a game, but arranged in columns: three skills per row. He didn't know how many rows there were, as the ones below were locked and couldn't be viewed or scrolled down. Only the top three skills glowed brightly.

With an excited heart, Zhou Tian opened the first skill.

【Crippling Punch: Ignores level, directly reduces enemy’s health by 10%. Requires direct physical contact with the enemy’s body via a punch. Cannot be used on the same person more than once per day (Daily Uses: 1, related to death count)】

“Holy crap, that’s powerful!” Zhou Tian immediately cursed out loud. Was it really that potent? Right off the bat, a major skill: ignores level, directly reduces an enemy’s health by 10%. That’s too damn monstrous! Skills that deal percentage damage are absolutely formidable.

He almost couldn’t resist tapping the plus sign next to it, but thankfully, a shred of rationality remained in Zhou Tian. Although this skill was incredibly powerful, it could only be used once a day, required physical contact with the enemy, and only crippled, not killed. He was just a mortal; even crippling someone wouldn’t be useful to him.
