# Chapter 659: The Self-Detonation of the Battle-Buddha

The thunder pillar trembled violently, its surface runes flickering, yet it stubbornly withstood the enraged blow, refusing to shatter.

"How is this possible?!"

Hui Ri Bodhisattva's face was filled with disbelief. No matter how one put it, he was a Golden Core level expert, a Bodhisattva of high standing. How could he fail to break through the defense of a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator?

Was someone secretly aiding him?

Xu Yunfan's face was pale. He let out a long breath, sensing the Moon Wheel Treasure Mirror within him, and glanced at the Heavenly Empress inside the Star Spirit Banner, who was nearly frightened to death.

"Heavenly Empress, I can only ask you to endure this hardship. Once we get through this attack, you can rest peacefully in recovery."

The Heavenly Empress was currently speechless.

If she could speak, she would be a million times unwilling to take a bullet for Xu Yunfan.

To be honest, if the Star Spirit Banner hadn't been refined by Xu Yunfan into his life-bound magic treasure—meaning that if Xu Yunfan died, the banner would self-detonate with him—she would have gritted her teeth and blocked the attack solely to save her own life.

After all, she was naturally compatible with the Moon Wheel Treasure Mirror. By briefly merging with it, she could unleash a single attack with Golden Core-level power.

Hui Ri Bodhisattva's expression shifted between gloom and light, but he no longer hesitated. Just as he was about to strike again, a colossal pillar appeared before him.

Looking up, he saw that Sun Wukong's body was surging with the light of treasure-glazed substance. Where the cracked stone-fetus fragments fell away, the foundation of the Diamond-Glazed Bright King was revealed, as solid as substance. The Eight-Armed, Angry-Eyed Dharma Form was entwined with the True Martial Demon-Subduing Evil Aura, and he held a blood-stained Vajra Pestle.

He had transformed into the Battle-Buddha, the Golden Core True Lord form baptized by his Buddhist position.

Sun Wukong said calmly, "If you wish to harm my master, you must step over my corpse."

Seeing that his efforts to attain the Self-Ruler Buddha position had been ruined, and that Sun Wukong had instead become the greatest beneficiary, now blocking his path, Hui Ri Bodhisattva was enraged to the point of laughter.

"You dare act arrogant just because you have just achieved the Golden Core? Today, I shall teach you that there are vast differences even among Golden Core experts!"

With that, the Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva Dharma Form violently formed a seal. The light of the glazed Buddha, carrying the residual might of the Buddha position, shot straight toward Sun Wukong.

Sun Wukong's eight arms trembled in unison, golden light bursting forth. The nascent form of the Hell-Pacifying Bright King's Small World collided frantically with the phantom of the Buddha Kingdom. As the blood-stained Vajra Pestle smashed down, the void shattered.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the battlefield and his mind settled slightly.

With Sun Wukong blocking Hui Ri Bodhisattva, as long as he could stall for time, everything would be settled once he completed his breakthrough.

Unfortunately, the Divine霄 Dao Fruit had been forced into hiding by the Pure Yang True Lord and was now taking a considerable amount of time to re-manifest and condense.

At this moment, within his Dantian, ninety-nine紫 gold dragons were holding the phantom of the Golden Core. The pillar of thunder falling from the Divine霄 Dao Fruit at the summit suddenly contracted.

He was just waiting to lift the nascent Small World and crash it into the Dao Fruit, at which point the Golden Core would be instantly formed.

"Destroy all laws, carry all heavens!"

Xu Yunfan's mana surged, and the thunder light completely retracted, leaving the紫 gold divine aura flowing over his skin.

The brilliant Golden Core phantom, containing the nascent form of an endless world of thunder, was slowly being lifted upward toward the condensed Divine霄 Dao Fruit.

On the other side, the chilling sword light brewed by the Tian Shu Peak Elder also poured down like a Milky Way from the ninth heaven. Carrying a chill that could freeze the soul, it slashed toward Han Shi on the peak.

"Presumptuous!"

From the peak of the Pure Yang Ancestor's mountain, a cold snort sounded like a thunderclap.

A colorless sword light, pure to the extreme and seemingly capable of severing all bonds of the world, arrived later but struck first. It precisely tapped the weakest point of the chilling sword light.

*Crack!*

The Tian Shu Peak Elder's sword light shattered instantly! His face turned pale, and he stumbled back several steps, his eyes filled with horror.

"Ancestor!"

随后, a至尊 sword intent rose abruptly.

It was Li Guangran of the Tian Shu Peak, the Burning Flame True Lord.

"Pure Yang, you have gone too far."

The Burning Flame True Lord's expression was unsightly. Lü Chunyang's intervention this time had broken the rules.

However, the other party's mid Golden Core cultivation made him dare not make a move.

He wanted to unite the other Sword True Lords to suppress him, but they were not of one mind, each having their own considerations.

For a moment, no one spoke first.

"Let him prove it."

Lü Chunyang's plain voice echoed through the peaks of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, carrying an undeniable oppressive force.

"The Cang Ming Dao Fruit has sensed this; it is the will of heaven. If he cannot prove it, then all is lost."

Invisible pressure shrouded the area, and the restless sword intents were instantly suppressed.

Li Guangran gritted his teeth and said, "The Taihua Spirit Ruin World cannot withstand so many Golden Core True Lords. If the number becomes too high, I fear it will cause the Heavenly Dao to completely descend a calamity. We might lose our grand strategy."

Lü Chunyang said indifferently, "No matter how much the Great Calamity is delayed, it will come eventually. Rather than that, it is better to have a few more True Lords."

The Burning Flame True Lord said no more. Lü Chunyang had already expressed his meaning; it would be undignified to say more.

Otherwise, Lü Chunyang would naturally make him lose face.

The Burning Flame True Lord couldn't help but sigh.

The界 Sea is endless, and the Taihua Spirit Ruin World is not the only one.

The clone Han Shi paid no heed to all of this. Under the protection of the Pure Yang Ancestor, Xu Yunfan concentrated most of his mind on the Cang Ming Nine Abyss Dao Fruit.

The phantom of the Riding Heaven Sword Throne shook violently in his sea of consciousness. The Raging Tide Sword Intent turned from void to substance, as if it wanted to drag the entire sky into the Abyss of Return.

The will falling from the Cang Ming Dao Fruit also grew heavier. A pitch-black pillar of light, composed of deep seawater and endless dark vortices, descended violently, completely enveloping Han Shi.

Above the Eastern Wasteland.

Hui Ri punched and shattered the Sea-Traversing紫金棍. The boundless Buddha light turned into a World-Purifying Light, blasting Sun Wukong away.

Having just entered the Golden Core, he was still inferior to these veteran Golden Cores.

Furthermore, Hui Ri Bodhisattva was already at the mid Golden Core stage.

For Sun Wukong to hold out for so long was truly commendable.

Xu Yunfan sighed. It seemed he had to sacrifice Sun Wukong.

It was a pity.

Then, a thought struck him, and Xu Yunfan's eyes suddenly lit up.

He wondered how many Star Lord positions a Golden Core True Lord could fill if he fell into the Star Spirit Banner.

Hui Ri turned his head, looking at Xu Yunfan.

"Xu Yunfan! Do you really think this Seat has no way to deal with you?!"

He clasped his hands together, a "Swastika" Buddhist seal lit up on his forehead, and the Great Sun Glazed Dao Fruit manifested behind him. It hummed and vibrated, and an even more grand and terrifying Buddhist force, as if it wanted to burn all living things, began to condense.

The entire Bodhi Pure Land's power was converging toward him.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a breath. His eyes were deep, showing not much fear.

Just at this critical moment.

Sun Wukong suddenly appeared before him.

Hui Ri Bodhisattva's pupils shrank. He saw Sun Wukong's Eight-Armed Angry-Eyed Dharma Form suddenly contract. Dark gold blood thunder wrapped around the blood-stained Vajra Pestle, tearing through the glazed Buddha light, and violently crashed into the core of Hui Ri Bodhisattva's Thousand-Handed Dharma Form.

The cracked stone monkey's body erupted with billions of dark gold cracks. The Battle-Buddha Golden Core turned into a black hole that devoured light within his chest.

"Boom!!!"

The power of the Battle-Buddha Golden Core's self-detonation was completely released.

The sky of the Eastern Wasteland was like a glazed glass struck by a giant hammer, instantly covered in spider-web-like black cracks.

The fierce wind swept over the land with a sharp shriek, turning the rocks into dust wherever it passed.

Hui Ri Bodhisattva's Thousand-Handed Dharma Form was annihilated inch by inch, and the glazed golden body exploded with spider-web cracks.

Faint golden Buddha blood gushed wildly from his seven orifices, and the lotus platform under his feet shattered into fragments of light.
