# Chapter 142: The Great Mulberry Tree's Heavenly Tribulation  

After the beast tide subsided, intense conflicts erupted between the Blackwater Sect and the Blood Demon Sect.  

In the wilderness, disciples from both sects frequently clashed, with battles sometimes involving over a dozen Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators. This led to a prolonged standoff between the two factions.  

However, the two current leaders of Tianxuan City—Qing Lingzi and Jin Guang—had secretly allied with the Blood Demon Sect, providing them with substantial resources.  

As a result, despite having fewer disciples than the Blackwater Sect, the Blood Demon Sect gradually gained the upper hand.  

Meanwhile, the Blackwater Sect took advantage of the conflict to purge scattered rogue cultivators near their territory. The Blackwater Sect's base was located in the Jingyang Waters, a vast area spanning thousands of miles with numerous small islands. Some of these islands had abundant spiritual energy, and a few even hosted small settlements of two to three hundred mortals, struggling to survive under the protection of Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Though the Blackwater Sect's influence on land diminished, they tightened their control over the islands in the waters.  

Not to be outdone, the Blood Demon Sect began seizing the cave dwellings of cultivators in the surrounding mountains.  

The conflict between the two sects squeezed the living space of many rogue cultivators in the wild.  

Unwilling to join the demonic sects, many rogue cultivators heard that Luopoling was expanding its market and had formed a mutual support alliance with Tianxuan City.  

If Tianxuan City was the major city, then Luopoling was the minor one—two cities working in tandem.  

During this time, Luopoling flourished.  

The reason rogue cultivators were willing to join Luopoling was because it had a Golden Core elder like Qing Lingzi overseeing it.  

Rumors even claimed that Qing Lingzi had once forced the Blackwater Sect's leader, Meng Xuan, to retreat.  

Some speculated that Qing Lingzi's abilities were already on par with mid-stage Golden Core cultivators.  

Meanwhile, within Tianxuan City, the aura of the Tianxuan Patriarch had completely vanished. Although Shang Zijian claimed the patriarch was in deep seclusion and would not emerge unless the survival of humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain was at stake, many feared the patriarch had already passed away.  

Currently, Tianxuan City was under the guardianship of Jin Guang, a standard early-stage Golden Core cultivator. His influence paled in comparison to the Tianxuan Patriarch and even Qing Lingzi.  

Many also wondered where Qing Lingzi had undergone his Golden Core tribulation, as there had been no news of it whatsoever.

With the influx of rogue cultivators, Luopoling expanded rapidly, necessitating upgrades to its protective formation. However, Tianxuan City's current formation master was only at the ninth level of Qi Refinement.  

Formation mastery required even greater innate talent than alchemy and a stable environment for long-term cultivation.  

After the previous generation of formation masters in Tianxuan City passed away, the talent pool had dried up.  

Upon obtaining the highest authority in Tianxuan City, Zhou Qing immediately acquired numerous formation insights and passed them to Yuan Mingyue.  

Yuan Mingyue absorbed the knowledge at an astonishing rate, and her innate talent for formations was continuously awakened.  

Despite her quiet demeanor, Luo Xiangu was surprised to learn that Yuan Mingyue was a master-level formation expert, though she was less shocked by her Foundation Establishment cultivation—after all, Yuan Mingyue was Qing Lingzi's personal disciple.  

Rumors suggested Qing Lingzi had no other disciples.  

Yuan Mingyue's gentle nature put Luo Xiangu at ease.  

Under her guidance, the cultivators of Luopoling used earth-to-stone transformation techniques and quarried massive boulders from nearby mountains to expand the market, accommodating more mortals.  

The Jingyang Dao Domain had not seen such large-scale construction in centuries, and there was initially a lack of skilled workers.  

However, Yuan Mingyue provided detailed blueprints for Luopoling's layout.  

The market expanded by merging nearby hills and gathering more spiritual veins, eventually reaching one-fifth the size of Tianxuan City.  

Many Tianxuan City cultivators even came to Luopoling to purchase or rent cultivation caves.  

The outer defensive formation was gradually completed, capable of easily withstanding attacks from Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Whether it could endure a large-scale beast tide remained to be seen.  

Fortunately, Yuan Mingyue had access to the essence of Tianxuan City's defensive formations and, with her unparalleled talent, adapted them to Luopoling's needs.  

Thus, Luopoling thrived.

**Water Mansion**  

"Master, the foundation for the market's defensive formation is complete," Yuan Mingyue reported during a brief return to the Water Mansion.  

Zhou Qing nodded. "You've worked hard. Once the formation is fully operational, I'll have Fellow Daoist Xiao bring the specially cultivated spirit grain seeds. The spiritual energy here is far richer than in the mortal realm, so the grain should be more effective."  

The previous beast tide had also yielded benefits—the mortal realm's spirit fields were nourished by the remains of demonic beasts. Skilled farmers had even developed a method to create fertilizer by combining demonic beast flesh with depleted spirit stones.  

The greatest beneficiary was Xiao Ruowang's tea tree. Its leaves now had twice the potency of before, providing noticeable benefits to Foundation Establishment cultivators, including a slight boost to spiritual sense.  

Yuan Mingyue often drank the tea to refresh herself during her formation studies.  

After discussing Luopoling's affairs, master and disciple returned to the Jiangzhou Medicine Garden.  

During this time, Shang Zijian had informed Zhou Qing of the entrance to the Sealed Spirit Tower's formation and the activation incantation.  

Under Zhou Qing and Jin Guang's joint decision, Shang Zijian retained his responsibilities, though the Jin family's interests in Tianxuan City were further expanded.  

With Zhou Qing's support, Shang Zijian's authority remained intact despite the Tianxuan Patriarch's disappearance.  

He acted as a mediator between Zhou Qing and Jin Guang, preventing potential conflicts.  

However, since Zhou Qing was not permanently stationed in Tianxuan City, Jin Guang still held significant influence there.  

This was intentional—Zhou Qing only needed Tianxuan City and Luopoling to continuously strengthen his own forces in the mortal realm.  

Attempting to annex Tianxuan City or the four demonic sects would be counterproductive.  

At the Jiangzhou Medicine Garden, Zhou Qing visited Fushan at Qingfu Palace.  

"Senior Brother, I've collected some ancient longevity elixir recipes."  

Zhou Qing had used his authority to gather these recipes from Tianxuan City, focusing on lifespan extension.  

Progress had been made in recipes for Foundation Establishment cultivators, but extending the lifespan of Golden Core cultivators remained a challenge.  

Fushan handled the foundational research, while Zhou Qing tackled the breakthroughs.  

Success would allow the Tianxuan Patriarch to extend his lifespan, potentially giving him another chance at Nascent Soul formation.  

Extending a Golden Core cultivator's lifespan was extremely difficult, but Fushan, with his alchemical talent and the ancient recipes, had made some headway.  

"Junior Brother, ordinary Foundation Establishment spiritual materials won't work. I believe we must use Golden Core-level wood-attribute spirits."  

Wood-attribute spirits naturally had long lifespans but struggled to take human form.  

Records in the Jingyang Dao Domain showed no instances of wood-attribute spirits achieving human transformation.  

"You mean the Great Mulberry Tree?"  

Zhou Qing understood—the Great Mulberry Tree was the only wood-attribute spirit near Golden Core level he could access.  

"If the Great Mulberry Tree advances to Golden Core, combined with the corpse of a Golden Core-level demon, it might produce a longevity treasure," Fushan theorized.  

Zhou Qing agreed, recalling the eerie peach tree outside the Jingyang Cave. Its peaches, ripening once every ten years, could extend a Foundation Establishment cultivator's lifespan by two to three years (or five to six for those below Foundation Establishment).  

After discussing alchemy, Zhou Qing returned to the medicine garden.  

The Great Mulberry Tree, though towering, retained an elegant beauty.  

Through their spiritual connection, Zhou Qing sensed the tree's impending tribulation.  

Even suppressing its vitality couldn't delay it further.  

Well, suppressing vitality wasn't particularly meaningful anyway.  

But the tree's branches made excellent skewers for roasting meat!  

Zhou Qing wondered how Golden Core-level mulberry branches would taste with Golden Core-level demon meat.  

Would it rival dragon liver and phoenix marrow?  

Suppressing his appetite, Zhou Qing sat beneath the tree, exchanging energy with it while practicing his Five Thunder Transformation Hand.  

This technique, an advanced form of the Five Organs Thunder, was highly effective against essence, energy, and spirit. Without it, he couldn't have erased the Moonhowl Patriarch's mark on the Shattered Moon Blade.  

Even so, fully eliminating the mark required continuous refinement.  

Currently, his Five Thunder Transformation Hand was only at the "beginner" stage.  

He was also studying sword techniques, planning to create his own based on the Tianxuan Patriarch's Divine Thunder Method.  

Thunder techniques were his forte, making the Divine Thunder Method easy to grasp.  

As for the Yin-Yang Divine Light, Zhou Qing would wait until Mao Ri advanced to Golden Core and combine it with Yuan Mingyue's Profound Darkness energy.  

The Great Mulberry Tree's innate energy would also be needed for balance.  

Cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light placed a heavy burden on spiritual sense. If Lin Wan'er reached Foundation Establishment, her Spirit Flight Divine Sound Scripture could assist.  

Mastering the Yin-Yang Vase Body of the Jingyang Patriarch would simplify the process, but specialization was key.  

At full power, the Yin-Yang Divine Light could slay enemies above one's level—its true terror.  

Even incomplete, it was unmatched among peers.  

Currently at the first revolution of Golden Core, Zhou Qing's combined magic and physique rivaled mid-stage Golden Core cultivators, but his offensive techniques weren't as dominant as during his Foundation Establishment peak.  

He needed time to perfect his divine abilities and his life-bound treasure, the Green Bamboo Sword.  

Only then could he fully unleash his Golden Core strength.  

Golden Core refinement was also necessary.  

Cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light would temper his core, with the Profound Darkness energy being particularly beneficial.  

Golden Core cultivation was painstakingly slow, consuming vast amounts of spiritual energy daily—equivalent to ten peak Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Even maintaining his realm was a heavy burden.  

Records in the Jingyang Dao Domain showed that most Golden Core cultivators established sects or clans to gather resources.  

The title "Patriarch" stemmed from this necessity.  

Only by founding a lineage could a Golden Core cultivator sustain their practice—unless they were adept at plundering others.  

But such cultivators needed not only strength but also exceptional survival instincts and danger perception.  

"Besides the Five Thunder Transformation Hand, the second layer of the Primordial Heavy Water is also challenging. The Divine Water Palace won't open for years, but its assistance may be necessary."  

Zhou Qing considered the map from the Blackwater Sect.  

After the Great Mulberry Tree's matter was resolved, he would study it carefully, hoping to use the Blackwater Divine Stele fragment to enter the Divine Water Palace early.  

Since only those below Golden Core could enter, Zhang Jingxiu and Fushan would have to explore.  

Zhang Jingxiu's strength was top-tier below Golden Core—his Titan Profound Technique could threaten peak Foundation Establishment cultivators in close combat.  

As for Fushan... Zhou Qing dismissed the thought. However, Fushan's extensive social network, including connections with rogue cultivators like Crane Sage, was useful.  

Though Fushan's habit of saying, "Fellow Daoist, please stay," made Zhou Qing consider finding him a cultivation method for the Heavenly Tribulation Dao.  

Second Senior Brother might as well rename himself "Shen Gongfu."  

Under Zhou Qing's Golden Core energy, the Great Mulberry Tree began to change. A power beyond Foundation Establishment emerged.  

Dark clouds gathered overhead.  

The tree radiated fear—wood-attribute spirits dreaded lightning.  

"Don't be afraid. I'm here," Zhou Qing soothed it with his spiritual sense.  

For wood-attribute spirits, heavenly tribulation was a life-or-death trial.  

Records in the Jingyang Dao Domain showed Golden Core-level wood spirits were exceedingly rare. At that level, they became "Heavenly Spiritual Roots," fundamentally different from ordinary spirits.  

In Jiangzhou City, cultivators like Butcher Hu felt an overwhelming pressure. Some outer disciples of the Dao Court even trembled.  

Mortals, however, remained unaffected.  

The terror of heavenly tribulation seemed ingrained in cultivators' blood and bones.  

The tribulation was both a calamity and an opportunity.  

If Zhou Qing shielded the tree completely, it would hinder its growth.  

He could only stand guard, offering support.  

Strangely, the Green Bamboo Sword seemed eager to participate.
