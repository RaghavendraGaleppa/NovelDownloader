# Chapter 17: Instant Casting, Innate Divine Ability  

After planting about half an acre of land, Chu Ning stepped ashore and prepared to return to his courtyard.  

At that moment, someone from the neighboring field also stood up and walked onto the path.  

"You're the new junior brother, aren't you?"  

Before Chu Ning could get a good look at the person, the other had already spoken. He quickly cupped his hands in greeting.  

"Chu Ning greets Senior Brother."  

The man smiled and returned the gesture. "No need for formalities, Junior Brother Chu. My name is Qi Chongmao. I'm responsible for the spiritual field next to yours and live in the neighboring courtyard. We're practically neighbors."  

"I hope Senior Brother Qi will guide me in the future." Chu Ning cupped his hands again while discreetly sizing up the other man.  

Qi Chongmao appeared to be in his forties or fifties. However, considering that wood-element techniques like the Evergreen Wood Technique had certain youth-preserving effects, it was hard to determine his exact age.  

Dressed in coarse cloth with his pant legs casually rolled up, he looked every bit the farmer, which surprised Chu Ning slightly. After all, most cultivators used spells for farming, and even among outer disciples, such attire was rare.  

As they walked toward their courtyards, the two exchanged casual conversation, getting a basic understanding of each other.  

Watching Qi Chongmao enter his own courtyard, Chu Ning smiled and returned to his.  

Qi Chongmao was different from Cao Dongxin. Though not as talkative and warm as Shang Zhaoxiang, he seemed amiable enough—someone easy to get along with.  

This put Chu Ning somewhat at ease. While he had no intention of forming deep friendships while farming, it was still better to have a friendly neighbor than a reclusive one.  

Over the next few days, Chu Ning devoted himself to the medium-grade spiritual fields in the Ding District, continuously using the Growth Technique on the spirit rice grains.  

Since each seed required the Growth Technique to sprout, progress was slow even though Chu Ning worked tirelessly.  

Of course, he deliberately controlled his speed. Though few people passed by his fields, Qi Chongmao's plot was right next door. If he finished planting too quickly, it would be obvious he was hiding his cultivation level.  

Thus, what could have been done in seven days took Chu Ning until the afternoon of the tenth day to complete.  

Now he finally understood the sect's reasoning behind the acreage assigned to each disciple.  

At the fourth level of Qi Refinement and with his proficiency in the Growth Technique, it still took him seven or eight days. For someone like Qiu Shunyi, it would take at least half a month.  

If more land were assigned, they truly wouldn't be able to manage.  

Of course, Chu Ning was planting spirit rice—the staple food for cultivators—which was of higher grade than the red spirit rice Qiu Shunyi cultivated.  

After ten days of nearly nonstop practice with the Growth Technique, Chu Ning had grown increasingly skilled. Now, he felt ready to move on to planting Dark Bamboo.  

The Dark Bamboo was to be grown in the high-grade spiritual fields of the Ding District, which were more isolated.  

Since large-scale planting was involved, and certain spiritual plants could hinder each other's growth if too close, high-grade fields were divided into independent plots of five or ten acres.  

Chu Ning's five-acre plot was located in a valley not far from his residence.  

Early one morning, he set out with the bamboo seeds.  

Unlike with the spirit rice, he didn't grab a handful at once. Instead, he carefully took out five seeds to test first.  

These Dark Bamboo seeds were reportedly cultivated by specialized sect members over a long period, making them extremely precious to Chu Ning.  

Moreover, the Growth Technique worked differently for the bamboo.  

Using the Telekinesis Technique, Chu Ning evenly scattered the five seeds into the soil before sitting cross-legged in the center. He formed hand seals and cast the Growth Technique on the seeds.  

After a while, five sharp bamboo shoots broke through the soil—proof of successful germination.  

Chu Ning didn’t stop there. He continued the technique until the shoots grew about half an inch above the ground before finally pausing, satisfied.  

His improved proficiency made a clear difference. Ten days ago, achieving this would have taken much longer.  

Now, he could sense that his hand seals were noticeably quicker.  

"By the time I finish planting these five acres, I might even master the Growth Technique to the point of instant casting, turning it into an innate divine ability."  

With this thought, Chu Ning took out ten more seeds, intending to test his limits.  

Since no one ever came to inspect this field, he could cast spells freely without fear of discovery.  

Perhaps due to his heightened skill, he managed the ten seeds with relative ease.  

Further experimentation revealed that sixteen seeds were his current limit.  

However, for safety’s sake, he decided to stick with ten at a time. There was no rush, and he didn’t want to risk damaging the precious seeds by overexertion.  

The Dark Bamboo required lower planting density than spirit rice.  

Yet, because Chu Ning could only germinate fewer seeds at once and the process took longer, progress was slower.  

After a full day, he had planted less than half an acre.  

Six days later, he had only completed half the field.  

"This is a bit too slow."  

For someone eager to finish planting and resume cultivation with the Evergreen Wood Technique, the pace was frustrating.  

The only silver lining was that his Growth Technique had improved further.  

Now, he could effortlessly germinate twenty seeds at once, meaning the second half of the field would go much faster.  

As he scattered twenty seeds and swiftly formed hand seals, a profound sensation washed over him.  

Without any external prompt, a realization struck him—his Growth Technique had reached a new level.  

He could now cast it instantly.  

Excitement surged as he tested the theory.  

Without forming any hand seals, he willed the technique into effect—and it worked!  

The bamboo shoots sprouted even faster than before, breaking through the soil in moments.  

Not only was the technique now instantaneous, but its power had also increased.  

Moreover, Chu Ning sensed that the mana consumption had decreased by about a fifth.  

"Is this what it means for a spell to evolve into an innate divine ability?"  

A smile spread across his face.  

If the Growth Technique could be cast instantly, what about other spells?  

The Wooden Spirit Body enhanced all wood-element techniques—Purification, Evergreen Wood, and even the Thorn and Vine Armor Techniques he planned to learn later.  

The thought filled him with anticipation.  

Instant casting drastically improved his planting speed.  

No hand seals were needed, the technique worked faster, and mana consumption was reduced.  

This allowed him to cast the Growth Technique about twenty percent more times with the same mana reserve.  

Overall, his efficiency nearly doubled.  

Thus, while the first half of the field had taken six days, the second half was completed in just three and a half.  

In total, the five acres were planted in ten days—just as quickly as the spirit rice.  

This delighted Chu Ning.  

More importantly, with the Dark Bamboo planted, he now had a new way to boost his cultivation speed.  

For nearly a month, he hadn’t had a good opportunity to use the Evergreen Wood Technique for cultivation.  

Now, he could finally resume his accelerated training.
