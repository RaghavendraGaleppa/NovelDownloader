# Chapter 21: Please Don't Disappoint a Righteous Taoist's Enthusiasm

Xiao Ji had barely stepped through the door with his left foot when he announced, "I'm here to report a crime."

"Oh? Which case is Taoist Xiao reporting this time?" Song Yuanbao perked up and invited Xiao Ji to sit for a drink. Work meant achievements were coming.

Xiao Ji handed Song Yuanbao a wanted poster from the announcement board: "Wang Chaomeng, mountain bandit leader, robbed merchant caravans and escort agencies thirteen times, involved in cases totaling seventy-eight thousand taels. Due to heavy snow blocking the mountains, he's temporarily lying low. Current whereabouts unknown. Reward for effective leads: two hundred taels. Merchants and escort agencies have collectively added three hundred taels, making the total reward five hundred taels."

"Taoist, you mean...?" Song Yuanbao looked puzzled.

"Here's the information. Wang Chaomeng is currently hiding in the Happy House in Willow Town, disguised as a hunter. He's been enjoying courtesans there for over ten days, particularly fond of courtesan Ru Yan. He's having such a good time he doesn't want to leave." Xiao Ji spoke as if he'd witnessed it personally.

Song Yuanbao was shocked. If true, this Wang Chaomeng was incredibly bold—not only appearing in Willow Town but daring to visit the Happy House. Just a few nights ago, Song Yuanbao himself had visited and also requested Ru Yan. No wonder she had teased him, saying Constable Song lacked "super strength"—now he understood she meant this "Chaomeng" (Super Strong).

"I'll take men to arrest him immediately." Song Yuanbao stood abruptly, throwing on his heavy coat and gripping his sword.

"Not so fast." Xiao Ji stopped him and pulled out another notice: "The Liu family's heirloom night pearl was stolen. The wife of the jewelry merchant Liu was nearly inconsolable—it's a family treasure passed down through generations to each daughter-in-law."

"The Liu family reported it, but the authorities found no traces of burglary, suspecting cultivators were involved. Even investigators from Dragon Soar County's Evil-Suppression Division found no traces of spiritual or demonic energy. The case remains unsolved. The government offers a hundred taels reward; the Liu family added three thousand, making the total three thousand one hundred taels."

"According to my investigation, the thief was none other than Merchant Liu himself, who secretly gave the treasure to his mistress, Widow Niu."

"Really?" Song Yuanbao was stunned. Solving this case would be the talk of Willow Town's elders for at least six months.

Stunned as he was, work was work. Song Yuanbao felt this winter was brighter than any spring before.

"Wait." Xiao Ji stopped him again, producing a third notice: "Remember that mysterious disappearance case six months ago...?"

"More?" Song Yuanbao was at a loss for words.

"Just these three for today. Handle them quickly and settle the rewards afterward. I'll wait at the Primordial Spirit Temple." Xiao Ji said.

The word "just" made it sound like the Taoist had more solved cases tucked away.

"Time might be tight." Song Yuanbao calculated the workload and managed, "It'll take at least three days."

Xiao Ji poured himself a cup of warmed wine and downed it in one gulp. "Please don't disappoint a righteous Taoist's enthusiasm."

"Justice must not be disappointed." Song Yuanbao gritted his teeth and made up his mind.

Thus began the full-fledged collaboration between Xiao Ji of the Primordial Spirit Temple and Constable Song of Willow Town.

The cooperation went smoothly. Following Xiao Ji's clues, Constable Song and his men worked tirelessly and solved all three cases by evening.

Impressed by such efficiency, his colleagues at the yamen began calling him "Willow Town's Fastest Constable."

Under the moonlight, Song Yuanbao arrived at the Primordial Spirit Temple. The gate was open—Xiao Ji was waiting in the main hall... for the banknotes.

"Normally, reward procedures take days, but our magistrate advanced the payment to show Willow Town's sincerity," Song Yuanbao explained.

"This sincerity, I accept with my hands." Xiao Ji pocketed the notes with a smile.

And so ended a fulfilling day.

The next day, snowflakes drifted again.

Song Yuanbao lounged in the duty room, tending a small stove to warm wine while fresh mutton sat nearby. He planned to reward himself for yesterday's hard work—running around tirelessly, a effort that moved even himself.

Just as he finished grilling skewers, a subordinate knocked: "Taoist Xiao is here."

"Perfect timing." Song Yuanbao said, "He can have some hot skewers—show him in."

As usual, Xiao Ji entered left foot first. Before his right foot touched ground, he brushed off snowflakes and declared, "I'm here to report a crime."

Again?

"Which criminal's traces has Taoist Xiao discovered this time?" Song Yuanbao invited him to sit, offering skewers and pouring warm wine.

"Remember that brutal murder six years ago?" Xiao Ji produced a faded notice with blurred writing:

"Master Hao, who ran a chain of mutton soup shops in the east end, was found dead in a giant pot—boiled into soup, flesh melted off bones, garnished with scallions and salt... The Hao family offered five thousand taels; the yamen added five hundred, totaling five thousand five hundred taels."

"People suspected either bandits after Hao's wealth or rival soup shop owner Wu... But the killer was actually a dog."

"A dog?" Song Yuanbao's eyes widened. He sipped wine to mask his shock.

"Exactly—a dog kept by Master Hao. My investigation revealed it had gained intelligence. It saw Hao selling dog meat labeled as mutton while pretending to love dogs, and witnessed many of its kind slaughtered. Hatred festered."

"When it grew strong enough, it boiled Hao alive... Then it pretended to be a loyal dog waiting for its master. It still guards the Hao residence."

Though bizarre, in this world, anything was possible. Given Xiao Ji's prior accuracy, Song Yuanbao didn't doubt him.

Thus began Xiao Ji's frequent visits to the yamen. In half a month, he entered Song Yuanbao's office ninety-eight times—averaging over six daily—with total rewards reaching ninety-seven thousand six hundred thirty-seven taels.

Finally, during a heavy snowfall, Willow Town's backlog of major cases was cleared.

Xiao Ji paused his efforts and requested ninety thousand taels be exchanged for thirty low-grade yellow spirit stones. The exchange would take days—requiring magistrate approval, verification by the county governor, and processing by the Evil-Suppression Division.

Ten days later, Xiao Ji received the stones. Combined with his master's two, he now had thirty-two.

Through solving cases, Xiao Ji not only gained silver but also cultivation progress. After half a month of constant perception, he reached Qi Refinement Layer 6.

[Name: Xiao Ji]  
[Age: 19]  
[Affiliation: Primordial Spirit Temple]  
[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, varying numbers]  
[Realm: Qi Refinement Layer 6 (7/60)]  
[Technique: Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Purple Gold Art]  
[Perception Range: 20 zhang (~60 meters)]  

Though deep perception granted cultivation points, requirements grew increasingly stringent, making progress arduous.

And so, amid swirling snow, Xiao Ji set off for the cultivator city of Taigu to attend to proper business.
