# Chapter 31: The Lingyun Sect  

Upon hearing the words "mid-tier cultivation techniques used at the Foundation Establishment stage," Lin Xuan immediately perked up. He glanced at the two unfamiliar disciples speaking—though the Drifting Cloud Valley was considered a minor sect in the cultivation world, it still had over a thousand members. Lin Xuan only recognized those who had entered the sect around the same time as him; the rest were mostly strangers. However, their attire clearly marked them as low-level disciples in the Qi Refining stage.  

They had just mentioned something about the Lingyun Sect disbanding and mid-tier techniques. Lin Xuan stepped forward and greeted them, "Senior brothers."  

The two halted and looked at the young man blocking their path with hesitation. "You are...?"  

"My name is Zhao Gang. Greetings," Lin Xuan replied with a friendly, harmless expression, hoping to extract some information from them.  

He deliberately released a trace of his spiritual energy, allowing them to sense his cultivation at the fourth layer of Qi Refining. Since they didn’t know him, he had no fear of them discovering his lack of spiritual roots. In the ruthless cultivation world, strength commanded respect—without displaying sufficient power, he wouldn’t be taken seriously, let alone gather any useful information.  

Still, he played it safe by using a fake name.  

The two were also at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, slightly weaker than Lin Xuan. Seeing this "senior brother" with superior cultivation greet them so politely, they quickly responded with smiles, "Ah, Senior Brother Zhao! What brings you to us?"  

Lin Xuan suppressed a laugh at being called "senior brother" by men clearly over thirty who had likely joined the sect before him. The deference he received due to his higher cultivation was a refreshing change.  

Maintaining his composure, he smiled. "No need for formalities, junior brothers. May I know your names?"  

"I’m Li Hai, and this is Chen Feng."  

"Shall we sit and talk?"  

"Of course!" The two readily agreed—not out of friendliness, but because Lin Xuan’s display of strength had made them cautious. In their eyes, this "Zhao Gang" was a rare genius, not even twenty yet already at the peak of the fourth layer, just a step away from late-stage Qi Refining. Such talent would undoubtedly be favored by the sect’s elders and had a high chance of reaching Foundation Establishment.  

In short, they saw Lin Xuan as someone with a bright future—not to be taken lightly.  

Lin Xuan, sharp as ever, could guess their thoughts and found it amusing. He was well aware that without the Blue Star Sea’s ability to refine flawed pills, providing him with ample resources, he would never have been mistaken for a prodigy.  

They settled in a quiet corner and exchanged pleasantries before Li Hai grew impatient. "Senior Brother Zhao, what did you wish to discuss?"  

"Ah, I overheard you mention the Lingyun Sect disbanding and was curious."  

"Oh, that!" Li Hai visibly relaxed, his expression turning smug. "When it comes to inside information, I’d say I’m among the best in the sect. This news hasn’t spread yet, so it’s no surprise you haven’t heard."  

"I’d appreciate the details."  

Unlike most high-level cultivators who looked down on those weaker, Lin Xuan’s approachable demeanor pleased Li Hai, who eagerly shared everything he knew.  

The cultivation world was vast, with countless sects. The Drifting Cloud Valley was mid-to-low tier, with over a thousand disciples—90% in Qi Refining and nearly a hundred at Foundation Establishment, serving as elders. The sect leader, Elder Yunhe, had even reached the early Core Formation stage.  

While not a powerhouse, the Valley was no pushover. With a Core Formation leader and nearly a hundred Foundation Establishment experts, they could hold their own in the region.  

Of course, the Drifting Cloud Valley wasn’t the only sect within thousands of miles—there were seven or eight others, including the Lingyun Sect.  

If the Valley was third-rate in the broader cultivation world, the Lingyun Sect was fourth or fifth-rate. Though they also had a thousand disciples, only a dozen or so were at Foundation Establishment, and their leader was merely mid-Foundation Establishment—nowhere near Core Formation.  

In conflicts, high-level cultivators decided outcomes. No matter how many low-level disciples a sect had, they were insignificant in battles. Thus, the Lingyun Sect was far weaker than the Drifting Cloud Valley.  

Yet, this minor sect had recently offended a Core Formation expert. The details were murky, but one thing was clear: the expert was furious and vowed to annihilate the Lingyun Sect within a month.  

Each major cultivation stage represented a qualitative leap in power. Against a Core Formation enemy, Qi Refining disciples were useless—not even fit to be cannon fodder. A dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators stood no chance.  

For the Lingyun Sect, this was a catastrophe.  

Without powerful allies, after desperate deliberations, they made the painful but inevitable choice: disbandment—their only path to survival.
