Chapter 137: Qi Lake Transformation, Shoulders Draped in Rainbow Mist

The black coffin containing the right hand, right leg, and right eye blocked the entrance of the Leopard Blade Sect, sealing the gate.

Madam’s carriage departed into the distance.

She was peerlessly beautiful upon first meeting, stirring hearts with desire. Yet she left behind indescribable terror. It was said that such beauty was not meant for ordinary men to enjoy.

Yang Tong had narrowly escaped disaster. Standing at a distance, his eyes remained intact. Surveying the devastation, he felt a complex mix of emotions.

The once-mighty Leopard Blade Sect had been shattered to pieces by a single woman.

The Madam’s faint fragrance still lingered in the courtyard. However, inhaling it made him tremble and panic, as if trapped in a nightmare, as though the Madam were still standing by his side. Suddenly, a cry of pain reached his ears, snapping Yang Tong back to clarity. He hurriedly lifted his master.

"Master, what do we do now?" Yang Tong asked frantically.

"First... bring me the Golden Turtle," Xu Liefeng said with great difficulty.

He had sealed his blood vessels and stopped his Qi and blood flow, but his entire body’s blood vessels were ruptured and festering. This was a fatal injury; if left untreated, he would die soon.

"Alright, alright."

Yang Tong ran to the back courtyard. Walking to the residence where his master usually stayed, he spotted a glint of gold among the rocks. He reached out and grabbed it—a brilliant golden turtle was now in his hand.

He returned to the front courtyard.

Xu Liefeng snatched the Golden Turtle, tore off its head with a snap, and let the pale green blood drip down. He drank it, and vitality spread throughout his body, significantly improving his complexion. This turtle was a rare species; its blood could sustain life and delay the fading of vitality. Although ruptured blood vessels were a fatal injury, it was slightly better than having one's head severed or heart pierced.

For half an hour, his life was safe.

But that wasn't enough...

To truly survive, he needed a "Red Fungus Ginseng." This ginseng was originally a poison; once it invaded the human body, it would devour the blood and replace the entire vascular system.

It would turn a person into a "Ginseng Human."

But at this moment, it was exactly what was needed to solve the urgent crisis. Using the "Red Fungus Ginseng" to replace his blood vessels would truly save his life.

Xu Liefeng had dominated the martial world for many years. He had collected many rare treasures and artifacts, and he just happened to have the "Red Fungus Ginseng." He consumed it immediately. The medicinal effects took hold; the "Ginseng Fungus" acted like ants, emerging from his abdomen and crawling toward various blood vessels, devouring and reproducing.

Since Xu Liefeng's blood vessels were already festering, the "Ginseng Fungus" spread rapidly, soon covering his entire body and replacing his blood vessels.

Xu Liefeng let out a slight sigh of relief, but then felt a wave of sorrow. From now on, his broken body would find it difficult to make even the slightest progress. Moreover... he would need to drink blood to survive, providing nutrients for the "Red Fungus Ginseng" inside him.

Without the surging flow of blood to conduct energy, even though his Qi Lake was vast, the loss during mobilization and application would be much greater. It was like traveling by carriage; originally, one would travel on a wide, straight, and unobstructed road.

The speed was fast, and the "cargo" capacity was large.

Now, it was a secluded path where even placing one's feet was difficult. The difficulty in transporting cargo was secondary; the real fear was getting "lost" midway. The ginseng fungus replaced the blood vessels, but its distribution was not the same as that of blood vessels.

"Vile... vile one!"

Xu Liefeng opened his mouth to curse, but he didn't dare to utter the words "vile person." He had barely uttered the word "vile" when he immediately changed "person" to "one." He intended to curse Li Xian.

"Master, what do we do now?" Yang Tong asked frantically. "Should we just run away?!"

Xu Liefeng said in horror, "Do you think you can simply run away now that Lady Zhejian has set her sights on you? If she wants to hunt you down, she will find you even if you flee to the ends of the earth."

"By then... you won't even be able to die!"

"That woman... how can she be so ruthless? Without any provocation, she would do such a thing to us!" Yang Tong said angrily, "It must be that Li Xian stirring up trouble. I wondered why he was so arrogant; it turns out he has latched onto such a behemoth!"

Xu Liefeng shook his head miserably. If it weren't for the friendship of his ancestors, given the Madam's temperament, not only would his own end be tragic, but the disciples in the courtyard would likely not escape either.

It was simply that he had overestimated his own abilities and brought this disaster upon himself.

"Master, do you really intend to fight that Li Xian in a duel?" Yang Tong asked.

Xu Liefeng nodded. "To survive, we must follow the Madam's wishes. Hmph, it seems the Madam doesn't treat that Li Xian all that well. Even if I am crippled, I am not someone just anyone can trample."

"One month from now will be that brat's death day. The Madam, seeing that I kept my promise, might just let me live."

He did not know that the Madam was not one to keep promises.

It was just that if she could kill him without breaking her promise, she would naturally do so.

The coffin remained in the Leopard Blade Sect.

The white horse and black carriage headed toward the manor and soon left the city.

"Li Xian, come in," the Madam's voice came from inside the carriage.

Li Xian lifted the curtain.

The carriage was quite spacious, fully equipped with a tea table and bookshelves. A round jade incense burner emitted a fragrant scent, elegant and fresh.

It was more than enough for someone to live in for a long time.

"Madam, what business do you have with me?" Li Xian asked.

"Naturally, I need to test you. To see if your skills have improved, and if you have kept my words in your heart," Lady Wen opened the carriage curtain, taking in the scenery of the mountain road.

"My White Cloud Steed knows the way back to the manor. You just need to serve me here."

"Yes." Li Xian moved closer and sat on a small stool. Lady Wen placed her legs on his knees; this was no longer ordinary contact between a man and a woman. But the Madam didn't care at all. Perhaps it was due to the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword," or perhaps there was another reason.

Her gaze was fixed on the窗外 (outside the window), full of laziness and comfort.

[Skill: Cloud-Rubbing Nine Forms]
[Proficiency: 25/500 (Entry Level)]
[Description: A massage technique that regulates Qi and blood, relaxes muscles and bones.]

He had only just learned it and hadn't reached the entry level yet. This technique梳理 (combs) the meridians and抚肌顺骨 (soothes the muscles and aligns the bones). It was evolved from the inferior martial art [Hand of Separating Sinews and Dislocating Bones].

It had no killing power.

Li Xian felt the slippery texture, didn't dare to look around, and stared blankly at the incense burner. However, his hands didn't stop moving.

"Regarding the matter at the Leopard Blade Sect just now, Madam is even more formidable than I expected. I have seen Xu Liefeng before; he was very powerful. But facing you, he actually knelt and kowtowed. Even until death, he didn't put up a shred of resistance."

"The Madam is becoming better at using me, acting more intimately than before. I borrowed her power to cleanse my fetal body, revealing the 'Palm of Immortal Opportunity,' and learned excellent martial arts. But in the long run, it will be harder for me to break free," Li Xian's thoughts flickered.

How could there be a perfect solution in this world?

The Madam is vicious; I must be extremely cautious!

Lady Wen glanced at Li Xian, the corner of her mouth rising, then looked back out the window. She said leisurely, "You have improved somewhat, but do you know that you have touched my taboo?"

Her toes pressed against Li Xian's chest.

Li Xian was stunned. Lady Wen smiled lightly and said, "No man has ever touched my feet."

Li Xian said crisply, "Then I shall accept whatever punishment the Madam deems fit."

"I won't punish you for now," Lady Wen said. "If you develop disloyal intentions, this Madam guarantees that I will make you suffer a thousand, ten thousand times more miserably than Xu Liefeng."

"But if you obey me, I guarantee your path in the martial way will be smooth."

Lady Wen's toes had already reached Li Xian's throat, slowly moving upward.

Li Xian wanted to speak. Lady Wen tapped him lightly with her toes, suppressing the sound. She said, "You don't need to speak. Just remember these words of mine well."

Li Xian nodded.

The carriage advanced, far from the city.

Having passed the previous incident, Li Xian asked, "Madam, what was the old promise between you and Xu Liefeng's ancestor?"

"It's not really a big deal," Lady Wen said. "Xu Liefeng is from the Xu family of Leopard Mountain. He had an elder who did me a favor."

"I couldn't bring myself to kill his descendants. Pang Long suffered a setback there, and my business in the county suffered losses because of him; I turned a blind eye to it all."

"But since he is courting death, I naturally can no longer tolerate him."

"One month from now, you will kill him."

Lady Wen looked out the window, her gaze distant. Come to think of it, she hadn't entered the Jianghu for a long time, and she wasn't clear about many of these changes.

"The 'Feast of Gazing upon the Dragon' is a grand event; I need to make more preparations," Lady Wen thought.

The carriage returned to the manor.

Li Xian got off the carriage, sent the Madam back to her residence, and returned to his commander's room.

He pulled open the clothes on his chest.

A faint red circle mark remained for a long time. A subtle internal Qi penetrated deep into his flesh, stopping just a hair's breadth away from his heart meridian.

If the Madam had applied just half a fraction more force just now, Li Xian's heart meridian would have been severely damaged, and he would have found it difficult to survive.

"What exquisite use of internal Qi. Her internal Qi was practically clinging to my heart meridian. Truly, taking a life is as easy as turning over one's hand," Li Xian exhaled a long breath of turbid air, maintaining his composure.

He dissolved that internal Qi.

"Strength! Strength! Strength!"

Today, the sun was scorching, and Li Xian's heart was burning with passion.

All matters were settled; the only thing left was to practice martial arts!

Advance martial arts, accumulate internal Qi.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian reviewed what he knew and learned anew, practicing the [Square Fist], [Breeze Leg], and [Green Silk Palm] in their entirety. Then he turned to refine the [Hand of Ascending Clouds] and [Sword of Waning Sun and Decaying Blood].

[Sword of Waning Sun and Decaying Blood]
[Proficiency: 4945/6000 (Small Success)]

The sword technique was growing deeper day by day, and Yang energy accumulated within his body, gradually causing a burning sensation again.

Superior sword techniques were indeed powerful.

Li Xian produced various anomalies when dancing with his sword. When executing "Three Suns Opening Prosperity," it was as if a sunlit brilliance shone, and the sword light was exceptionally dazzling.

The pity was...

The more Li Xian cultivated, the more he felt this sword technique was extremely powerful, yet also extremely incomplete. It required two swords to be combined to unleash its true power.

Executing it alone, although exquisite,

It absolutely could not reach the level of a "superior sword technique." Furthermore, because the sword technique was incomplete, there was always a sense of dissatisfaction whenever he practiced it.

He practiced diligently until midnight.

"I now have a ten-zhang Qi Lake. I must continue to practice and accumulate Qi! The larger the Qi Lake, the stronger my strength!" Li Xian looked inward. Watching the Qi Lake he had painstakingly built up bit by bit every day gave him a great sense of achievement.

"Another day... I will go to the Madam and ask for a chance to enter the Hidden Martial Pavilion to select another inferior martial art!"

"The Madam said the Qi Lake is of utmost importance. When the Qi Lake accumulates to fifteen zhang, it will trigger a transformation!"

"But many食精 (Food Essence) martial artists may not necessarily have such a foundation."

"I just need to cultivate a few more martial arts, and I will be close."

He cultivated peacefully like this.

Before long, the manor began boiling the pot again. This time, when boiling the refined food, the amount of "refined meat" added was significantly more.

It was boiled for two days.

When the refined food was taken out of the pot, the Madam didn't take back the treasure box; that thing was originally a reward for Li Xian.

"The effect is best when consumed right out of the pot. It's slightly inferior after being put into the [Sky-Enveloping Box]. Take this portion of refined food now, and put the other portion in the box, eating one gram every two days."

"You have already manifested signs. It won't be long before the next characteristic appears," the Madam waved her hand and gave the two portions of treasure-grade meat to Li Xian. Both were the size of a "palm," several times larger than before.

After giving her quiet instructions, she went up to the Quiet Heart Tower with Qiuyue to cultivate.

Li Xian enjoyed the [Refined Treasure] and no longer needed to wash his胎体 (fetal body), so he did his best to retain the "Heaven and Earth Essence." He used both circulating Qi through the meridians and sealing his blood vessels.

He drank the refined soup first, then ate the refined meat.

Threads and strands of energy spread throughout his body, refreshing and cool, hard to describe in words.

He retained "ten strands" in one go.

The Palm of Immortal Opportunity, Shoulders Draped in Rainbow Mist, Chest Rumbling with Thunder, Head Sprouting Life Hair... These are all external manifestations. In reality, the only true mark of a "Food Essence" martial artist is [Digestion].

Martial artists persevere through time, persistently practicing, defying the heavens to cultivate. Finally, they earn the qualification to digest the Heaven and Earth Essence.

The first step in shedding one's mortal body and reborn.

Eating a hundred to transform one is called entering the Food Essence stage.

The essence of Heaven and Earth allows one to undergo a rebirth. Digesting the Heaven and Earth Essence makes the martial artist's physical body tend toward the heavens and earth, revealing many divine wonders. The growth of strength and vitality has always been a byproduct.

The important thing is that it can also increase one's "lifespan"!

Li Xian sat cross-legged in the courtyard.

A multicolored halo emerged from his shoulders,衬托 (setting) him off like a divine being.

Shoulders Draped in Rainbow Mist!!

One step further.
