# Chapter 66: Come On, Show Me

"Does Senior Brother not wish to agree?  
If not, I won't force you."  

Though Mo Changqing was the sect leader and his cultivation surpassed hers, Zhuge Wan always maintained the upper hand in their interactions.  

Truly, those who are favored can afford to be willful.  

"Junior Sister, what are you saying? Disciple Zhang participated in the Spiritual Plant Competition and brought honor to our Qingheng Sect. As the sect leader, rewarding him is only right!  

As for the spiritual plants in my garden?  
Take whatever you want."  

Mo Changqing's heart bled as he spoke. His spiritual garden contained many treasures—some even passed down from his master, which he had intended for his own disciples.  

Now, it seemed they would benefit Zhang Yan instead.  

But then he reconsidered:  
Wasn't Junior Sister's disciple essentially his own disciple as well?  
No difference!  

This thought eased his pain somewhat.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother. However, I have another favor to ask." Zhuge Wan gave a slight nod. The spiritual garden was not her ultimate goal.  

"Speak freely, Junior Sister. If I can help, I certainly will." Mo Changqing's expression turned serious. It was rare for his junior sister to make requests.  

"I wish to secure a True Disciple position for Zhang Yan."  

Mo Changqing's reaction was immediate:  
"What?  
Zhang Yan? A True Disciple?  
Impossible! Absolutely impossible!"  

No matter how he looked at it, Zhang Yan didn't meet the requirements.  

"Junior Sister, is Zhang Yan truly your illegitimate child?" Mo Changqing asked, his heart aching.  

"I advise you to choose your words carefully, Senior Brother," Zhuge Wan's expression turned frosty. "Will you help or not?"  

"This isn't about whether I want to help. You know the rules—only Core Formation candidates can become True Disciples.  

While Zhang Yan excels in spiritual plant cultivation, his spiritual roots are too weak. He cannot qualify."  

Despite his affection for his junior sister, Mo Changqing refused to bend the sect's rules.  

"Zhang Yan's aptitude may be lacking, but his comprehension is exceptional. He has already mastered two spells to perfection. Think about his age—and you know better than anyone the effects of perfected spells.  

Wasn't it your mastery of three perfected spells at the Foundation Establishment stage that secured your position as sect leader?"  

---  

"Two perfected spells still aren't enough! Even if—" Mo Changqing paused mid-sentence and turned to Zhuge Wan. "Wait, what did you say? Two perfected spells? Don't lie to me!"  

"Would I joke about this? Summon Zhang Yan, and you'll see for yourself. With his comprehension, he could bring back even more spell legacies from the Taiyi Sect's secret realm."  

"Let's call Zhang Yan first. But you know the rules—True Disciple appointments require unanimous approval.  

Given our sect's current resources, we can only support seven True Disciples at most. Any more would require cutting into the elders' allocations."  

Mo Changqing spoke earnestly.  

"Recently, the Tianmu Mountain Range has grown crowded. Cultivators multiply, yet resources dwindle. It seems a reclamation war is inevitable."  

"Exactly. A reclamation war is necessary. We must prepare thoroughly—this time, we'll restore Qingheng Sect to its former glory."  

The sect leader's eyes burned with fervor. Every Qingheng leader had prepared for this war, whether they lived to see it or not.  

Conquering the Tianmu Mountain Range was the lifelong ambition of Qingheng's founders.  

The sect's unity stemmed from this shared purpose. Even those who missed the war formed teams to explore the mountains.  

Why did Qingheng allow so many clans within its territory?  

To use them as scouts, pushing the demonic beasts further from human settlements.  

Once the outer threats were cleared, the sect would launch its campaign—exterminating the great demons, seizing their spiritual veins, and expanding their domain.  

This cycle of reclamation had allowed Qingheng to grow steadily over generations.  

---  

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan sat meditating in his cave when a streak of light flew in.  

"My master summons me to the sect leader's cave?  
Is it time for my reward?"  

The thought of Mo Changqing's spiritual garden made him smile.  

The sect leader's collection was legendary. Rumor had it the sect's main garden held even greater treasures—though he hadn't yet had the chance to visit.  

Mounting his Golden Bamboo Sword, Zhang Yan soared toward Mo Changqing's residence.  

"Sect Leader, Master." He bowed upon entering.  

"Zhang Yan, your victory in the Spiritual Plant Competition has brought honor to Qingheng. As your reward, you may select three plants from my garden."  

Mo Changqing observed Zhang Yan's respectful demeanor—truly like a personal disciple.  

Perhaps...  
He wouldn't mind having such a disciple.  

"Thank you, Sect Leader." Though unsure why the leader was so generous, Zhang Yan knew better than to question it.  

"We called you here for another reason. Your master tells me you prefer to keep a low profile, but talent must be displayed to receive proper guidance from the sect."  

Zhuge Wan spoke gently. "Demonstrate your spell mastery today. Show the sect leader what you're capable of—and prove you deserve to be a True Disciple!"  

"Understood."  

Zhang Yan nodded. It was time to reveal his worth. The greater his display, the better his treatment would be.  

Now—let the show begin!
