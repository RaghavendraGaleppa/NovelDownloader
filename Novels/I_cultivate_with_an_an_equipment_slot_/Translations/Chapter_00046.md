# Chapter 46: Wealthy and Generous

Whether he liked it or not, as the personal disciple of the Wood Spirit Peak's master, Zhang Yan now held a position of influence within the Qingheng Sect. He could even be considered a minor faction leader in his own right.

It was inevitable that people would come to curry favor, pledge allegiance, or even threaten him. This was simply the way things worked. The Liu family happened to be the first to seek his patronage, offering substantial resources in the process. Naturally, Zhang Yan saw no reason to refuse their goodwill.

After all, cultivation required resources. With his cheat-like abilities, Zhang Yan preferred to avoid life-and-death struggles, opting instead for peaceful farming and relying on tribute from smaller factions. Every resource brought him one step closer on his immortal path. Moreover, this wasn't a one-sided arrangement—it was mutually beneficial cooperation.

The Liu family acted swiftly. The day after Elder Liu gave his approval, a team arrived to survey Zhang Yan's spirit herb garden, preparing to begin construction. They even brought along a foundation-building expert from the Hundred Formations Peak to design a specialized array formation for the garden.

Watching the Hundred Formations Peak senior brother earn thousands of spirit stones with ease made Zhang Yan green with envy. These people made money far too easily. Little did he know, the array master was equally envious when he saw Zhang Yan's spirit fields!

While array formations could be profitable, the income was unstable—good times brought wealth, but during slow periods, earnings could dry up completely. In contrast, Zhang Yan's spirit fields were stable assets, providing reliable income regardless of conditions. He didn't even need to lift a finger—just leasing them out guaranteed steady profits. Passive income was something no one could resist. If anyone claimed otherwise, it was only because they lacked the means to achieve it.

Once construction began on the spirit herb garden, Zhang Yan could no longer stay there and had to relocate. Fortunately, Wood Spirit Peak had many vacant cave dwellings. He casually selected one and settled in, with Liu Yiting following suit.

Elder Liu had instructed her to stay by Zhang Yan's side, clearly hoping she would become his favored concubine. As for becoming his dao companion? The Liu family knew their place. Zhang Yan didn't dislike Liu Yiting, but he had no intention of taking her as a concubine—at least not yet.

His reasons weren't based on morality or righteousness. First, they were both too young—barely in their teens, not even adults by modern standards. Second, Zhang Yan hadn't yet reached the Foundation Establishment stage. With his inferior spiritual root, achieving Foundation Establishment would already be challenging enough. Losing his yang purity would only make it harder.

For the sake of his immortal path, Zhang Yan resolved to abstain from romantic entanglements until after Foundation Establishment. Thus, Liu Yiting's role was limited to managing his daily needs.

In the courtyard, Liu Yiting held out a handful of spirit rice, making cooing sounds. A graceful bird descended from the sky, landing on her wrist. Its golden beak deftly pecked at the rice in her palm.

Stupid bird.

This was just a wild bird Zhang Yan had casually caught at the Liu family home. Originally unremarkable, after being subjected to Zhang Yan's various experimental pills and feedings, it had developed a faint spiritual awareness. Still, it was far from becoming a true spirit beast. But since it was obedient, Zhang Yan kept it around—after all, Landlord Zhang now had plenty of surplus grain.

During the garden renovations, Zhang Yan also inspected his two thousand mu of mid-grade spirit fields. Old Lin couldn't possibly manage such an expanse alone, but Zhang Yan never intended for him to. Instead, he leased all the fields to spirit farmers, collecting rent directly.

"These are all mid-grade fields," Old Lin explained as he led Zhang Yan through the land. "I plan to dedicate some to spirit rice and the rest to medicinal herbs." Using mid-grade fields solely for rice would be wasteful, but planting only medicinal herbs would discourage the farmers. While herbs yielded higher profits, they took much longer to mature—at least a year, sometimes two or three. Most spirit farmers couldn't afford such long cycles. Yet Zhang Yan couldn't abandon the more profitable herbs entirely, so Old Lin had to find a balance that satisfied both parties.

Seeing the well-organized fields filled Zhang Yan with satisfaction. All this represented spirit stones! Moreover, being a landlord was truly wonderful—doing nothing while taking sixty percent of the harvest (originally seventy, but he gave ten percent to Old Lin as management fees). Though Old Lin still managed the same two hundred mu, the upgrade from low-grade to mid-grade fields had multiplied his income several times over.

After touring his lands, Zhang Yan headed to the Qingheng Sect's marketplace to discuss business. His new status as a major landowner meant he produced more spirit rice and herbs than he could possibly use himself. He needed a reliable buyer to handle the surplus.

Not wanting to bother with the details, Zhang Yan went straight to the Sect Affairs Hall and found the relevant steward. As a major supplier with superior mid-grade produce, he secured slightly higher prices. With harvest season approaching, the transaction soon filled his pockets with spirit stones.

However, Zhang Yan didn't keep everything for himself. These fields had originally belonged to Zhuge Wan. Though a Golden Core cultivator like her wouldn't care about such trivial sums, Zhang Yan felt obliged to show his appreciation. He purchased various spirit herbs and flowers, then plucked leaves from a second-grade tea tree to create a special Hundred Flower Tea.

The refined tea not only had a richer fragrance but also nourished yin and enhanced beauty—effects guaranteed to appeal to female cultivators of all ages. When Zhang Yan presented the tea to Zhuge Wan, it earned him immediate praise and even extra rewards.

This experience left Zhang Yan marveling at Zhuge Wan's incredible wealth—both abundant and generous! She treated him exceptionally well.

"What a shame this Hundred Flower Tea requires second-grade tea leaves as ingredients," Zhang Yan mused. "Otherwise, it could've been a fantastic money-maker." Still, he smiled faintly. "But this is good too."
