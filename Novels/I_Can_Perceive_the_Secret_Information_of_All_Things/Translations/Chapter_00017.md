# Chapter 17: How Could You Think That?

In the main hall of the Tu family residence in Willow Town, the current head of the Tu family, Tu Mantun, was pointing at a map spread before him.

"We can keep the existing walls of the Yuanshen Temple, but we'll need to open a large gate on the north side to make it convenient for the wealthy young masters from the northern district to come spend their silver," he declared.

"The old buildings in the backyard must all be demolished. I'll build Willow Town's largest pleasure house there—five stories tall, one floor higher than the Joy Tower."

"Height brings more than just prestige. Imagine this: currently, the neighbors to the left of Yuanshen Temple are the Swift Wind Escort Agency, and to the right is the Colorful Sparrow Textile Workshop. From the highest floor, our guests can enjoy their pleasures while watching bare-chested men practicing martial arts on one side and women spinning, weaving, and dyeing cloth on the other..."

"However, we should preserve some of the temple's distinctive architecture, like the main hall."

"We'll replace the Taoist statues in the main hall with scantily clad beauties. We can keep the incense burners—let the wealthy patrons burn incense and draw divination sticks before their pleasures. The madams dressed as female Taoists can then recommend services based on the sticks drawn..."

"I want these two cultures to collide and create extraordinary sparks."

Though Tu Mantun was in his sixties, he was brimming with youthful ambition, as if the dreams of his younger days were finally within reach.

The servants nearby didn't fully understand his grand vision, but they cheered nonetheless.

"The master is brilliant!"

"It sounds amazing. When can we start?"

"Damn right!"

Flattered by their praise, the old man was pleased—until someone asked when construction could begin. That plunged him back into frustration, as the Yuanshen Temple wasn't yet his property.

Acquiring this prime piece of land had met with considerable resistance. The two mediocre Taoists—one old, one young—refused to budge.

Forcible seizure wasn't an option; the Great Li Kingdom had laws, and the current officials of Willow Town were incorruptible, refusing all bribes with an air of righteous integrity.

"When we can start depends on Shaomei's progress. It won't be long now," Tu Mantun said, narrowing his eyes. The oily sheen on his face took on a sinister gleam.

Ever since he had sworn never to live in poverty again, he had used every means necessary to get what he wanted—and he had never failed. This time would be no different. The Yuanshen Temple's land would be his.

"Master! Master! Shaomei and the others are back!" The steward rushed into the hall, nearly tripping in his haste.

"Where are they? Have them come to me. Or do I need to go to them?" Tu Mantun frowned.

The old steward caught his breath before stammering, "They... they were carried back."

In the front hall, Tu Mantun found three of his servants lying battered and barely conscious. They could only moan incoherently: "Broken... hurts... no more beatings..."

"So you offer a fair trade, and they resort to violence? Fine. I'll show the Yuanshen Temple what real ruthlessness looks like!" Tu Mantun smashed a teacup on the floor.

At that moment, a gray-robed cultivator entered. He was gaunt, with an aura of malevolence swirling around him. His sharp features were accentuated by a thin mustache, but most striking was his deathly pale complexion—like an emissary from the underworld.

Seeing the furious Tu family head, the cultivator smiled faintly. "Patriarch Tu, why trouble yourself over a mere Yuanshen Temple? Is it time for me to step in?"

"Your assistance would be appreciated," Tu Mantun replied through gritted teeth.

"There are only two Taoists there. I've scouted them—one is at the third level of Qi Refinement, the other barely at the first. Before my fourth-level strength, they're nothing but ants to be crushed," the gray-robed cultivator sneered. "Of course, our agreed price remains unchanged."

Tu Mantun dismissed the servants and had the injured men carried away before addressing the cultivator. "Thirty-six sets of organs from those born in the first month, every year for three years—to aid your breakthrough from the fourth to the ninth level of Qi Refinement."

"Patriarch Tu remembers well. Don't think you're losing out. I'll secure the Yuanshen Temple's land for you and handle three additional tasks. You're getting a bargain." The cultivator nodded in satisfaction.

"Just ensure no suspicion falls on the Tu family," Tu Mantun emphasized.

And so, the deal was struck.

At the Willow Town government office, Constable Song Yuanbao lounged with his legs crossed, sipping tea from a purple clay teapot. He cherished these peaceful days and hoped they would last until his old age.

No incidents meant not only an easy life for him but also peace and prosperity for the townsfolk.

"Boss, a Taoist is here. Says he has an important case. The magistrate wants you to handle it," a young constable reported.

"Which Taoist?" Song Yuanbao asked without moving.

"The one from the Child-Giving Temple case last time," the subordinate replied.

"Didn't we already give him his reward? Probably here for a commendation plaque. These days, these half-baked cultivators always want something extra after helping the government," Song Yuanbao grumbled, his peace disturbed. "Fine, I'll see him. But if he's after more money, forget it. At most, he gets a 'Public-Spirited Taoist' plaque."

Cultivators visiting the government office were treated differently from commoners. While ordinary citizens had to beat the drum and plead their cases in the main hall, cultivators could meet directly with constables in the back.

Song Yuanbao straightened his appearance and had the Taoist brought in.

It was indeed the Taoist from Yuanshen Temple.

"I'm here to report a crime," Xiao Ji announced as soon as he stepped into the room.

"Against whom?" Song Yuanbao asked.

"The Tu family of Willow Town, who run the gambling den," Xiao Ji replied, wandering around the room. He picked up a teapot to examine it, then hefted a weapon as if familiar with the place. "Their patriarch is trying to seize my temple's land. They've spread slander and even sent thugs to harass us. I had a scuffle with three ruffians..."

"That's just a brawl. The office usually doesn't intervene in such matters. Best to settle it privately," Song Yuanbao said.

"That's not the main issue. Right now, the Tu family is colluding with a sinister cultivator, and it could bring shame upon Willow Town," Xiao Ji stated, getting to the heart of his visit.

"A sinister cultivator?" Song Yuanbao perked up. "Are you certain?"

Government offices across the land despised demons, monsters, and heretical practices. Handling such cases also greatly benefited one's career, making them highly sought after by both constables and officials from the Demon-Suppression Bureau.

"Absolutely certain," Xiao Ji confirmed.

Xiao Ji already knew the Tu family's plans and the existence of the fourth-level Qi Refinement heretic. If his goal were merely to kill the man, he had many methods at his disposal.

But he wanted to uproot the entire problem.

For the Tu family to vanish from Willow Town, official intervention was necessary.

"Taoist, please return to Yuanshen Temple for now. After I investigate, I'll visit you," Song Yuanbao said, eager to lead his men to the Tu residence.

But Xiao Ji showed no intention of leaving.

Just as Song Yuanbao was about to speak again, Xiao Ji cut in, "Constable Song, you're at the third level of martial Qi Refinement. The Tu family's heretic is at the fourth level. Taking a team of first and second-level martial cultivators there is dangerous."

Song Yuanbao tightened his grip on his saber, surprised the Taoist knew his cultivation level. Still, he replied politely, "Don't worry, Taoist. We're seasoned professionals. Nothing will happen."

"Or perhaps you're worried about sharing the credit and just trying to brush me off," Xiao Ji said, his gaze sharp as a blade.

It was true. According to Great Li Dynasty regulations, if a local office couldn't handle a case, they could request assistance from the Demon-Suppression Bureau or local experts—but the original officers would receive only a fraction of the credit and reward.

"How could you think that?" Song Yuanbao chuckled. "I was only concerned for your safety... But if you wish to come along, you're welcome to join us."
