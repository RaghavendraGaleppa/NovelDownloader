# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 119: The Nascent Soul Assembly  

Several months passed in the blink of an eye.  

Lin Xuan remained at the Spirit Medicine Mountain, diligently cultivating without showing any outward signs of abnormality. However, his mind was constantly occupied with thoughts of refining the Meridian Transformation Pill.  

All the other medicinal ingredients had been gathered, with only the Seven-Star Grass missing as the catalyst.  

Lin Xuan refrained from acting rashly.  

Though he had learned of its whereabouts, the Azure Cloud Mountain was not a place he could recklessly infiltrate at his current level. Any impulsive move might not only fail to secure the herb but could also cost him his life. Until he had a foolproof plan, Lin Xuan decided patience was his best course of action.  

Of course, he didn’t waste time either. He continued his rigorous daily cultivation.  

Though the three pills he had were meager, his cultivation steadily progressed.  

The *Nine Heavens Profound Art* he practiced now was truly worthy of its reputation as one of the most renowned techniques in the cultivation world a thousand years ago. Even with Lin Xuan’s current limited grasp, he could already sense its formidable power.  

One morning, as Lin Xuan sat meditating in his training chamber, his eyebrows twitched. He raised his head and flicked a finger, causing the stone door to open. A message talisman flew in.  

"Come to my cave at once. There’s an important matter to discuss."  

The voice of Elder Tongyu emerged as the talisman burned away. Lin Xuan’s eyes flashed with curiosity—what did his master want with him?  

Without hesitation, Lin Xuan stood up and made his way to Elder Tongyu’s cave. His morning cultivation session had just concluded, so the timing was perfect.  

Truth be told, his master had treated him well. Apart from placing high expectations on his alchemy skills, Elder Tongyu made no other demands. On the contrary, he often accommodated Lin Xuan’s requests whenever possible.  

Even in alchemy training, Elder Tongyu only conducted monthly assessments, leaving Lin Xuan to study independently with the provided manuals and notes. He was free to seek guidance whenever he encountered difficulties.  

This arrangement suited Lin Xuan perfectly. Had he been under a strict teacher, he would have fled long ago after securing the Foundation Establishment-stage waste pills, as rigorous alchemy training would have severely cut into his personal cultivation time.  

Now, the monthly assessments were a breeze for Lin Xuan, thanks to his purification ability. He always performed just well enough—neither too outstanding nor too mediocre—to satisfy Elder Tongyu, who took pride in having such a talented disciple.  

As for the alchemy knowledge tests, they were even easier. Lin Xuan had developed a habit of reading alchemy manuals during breaks from cultivation. While he had no intention of mastering the craft, expanding his knowledge of medicinal herbs was always beneficial.  

Ten minutes later, Lin Xuan arrived at Elder Tongyu’s cave.  

Just as he was about to send a message talisman, the stone door rumbled open on its own.  

Lin Xuan was momentarily startled but quickly understood. Though his master specialized in alchemy, he was also a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. His spiritual sense must have detected Lin Xuan’s arrival.  

Without hesitation, Lin Xuan stepped inside.  

"Master."  

Elder Tongyu nodded. "Sit."  

"Thank you, Master."  

Lin Xuan took a seat on a nearby stone stool, knowing his master cared little for formalities.  

"You summoned me. What is the matter?"  

"I’ve just received an invitation from the Azure Cloud Mountain," Elder Tongyu said. "They’re hosting a grand assembly to celebrate one of their elders successfully forming a Nascent Soul."  

"Nascent Soul?"  

"Yes. According to the invitation, one of their elders recently emerged from seclusion after advancing from the Great Perfection of the Core Formation stage to the Nascent Soul stage, becoming the sect’s second Nascent Soul cultivator."  

Even Lin Xuan, usually composed, couldn’t hide his astonishment. Legends were one thing, but to hear confirmation that the Azure Cloud Mountain—one of the three great sects of Youzhou—now had a second Nascent Soul expert was staggering.  

Lin Xuan swallowed hard. "Master, do you wish for me to accompany you?"  

"No. I won’t be attending. Instead, I want you to represent the Spirit Medicine Mountain."  

"What?" The suggestion took Lin Xuan by surprise, but he remained silent, knowing his master would explain.  

Sure enough, Elder Tongyu took a sip of tea and continued, "First, I’m currently testing a new pill formula and can’t leave at this critical stage. Second, I’d rather not wade into these troubled waters."  

"Troubled waters?"  

"Indeed. Between master and disciple, there’s no need for pretense. Do you think this grand assembly is merely a celebration? There’s more beneath the surface."  

"An ulterior motive?"  

"Of course." Elder Tongyu smirked. "The celebration is a façade. The real purpose is to intimidate the other sects..."  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan fell silent after hearing his master’s analysis. He hadn’t expected Elder Tongyu—seemingly detached and absorbed in alchemy—to possess such sharp insight into political undercurrents.  

Especially after learning about the structure of Youzhou’s cultivation world.  

Though Lin Xuan had some prior knowledge, Elder Tongyu’s explanation was far more detailed and thorough.  

The Youzhou cultivation world was indeed prosperous, composed of sects, cultivation clans, and rogue cultivators.  

Sects held the most power, with the Azure Cloud Mountain, Single Thread Gorge, and Thundercloud Manor standing at the pinnacle. For a thousand years, the three had maintained a delicate balance.  

Yet beneath the surface, each was amassing strength, eager to surpass the others.  

With this context, the Azure Cloud Mountain’s grand assembly took on a deeper significance. Previously, all three sects had only one Nascent Soul cultivator—a tradition upheld for millennia.  

The path of cultivation was arduous. Though divided into eight stages, ninety percent of cultivators never progressed beyond the Qi Refining stage.  

Few reached Foundation Establishment, and Core Formation experts were as rare as phoenix feathers. Nascent Soul? Only the most exceptional talents, blessed with immense fortune, could hope to achieve it. Among tens of thousands of cultivators, perhaps one might ascend to Nascent Soul.  

For the three great sects to each maintain one Nascent Soul expert was already remarkable.  

Now, the Azure Cloud Mountain had produced a second.  

On the surface, with tens of thousands of disciples, one person might seem insignificant. But in reality, Nascent Soul cultivators wielded earth-shaking power—legends of their abilities were no exaggeration.  

This shift could disrupt the three-way balance.  

According to the invitation, nearly every sect in Youzhou had been summoned. The Azure Cloud Mountain’s intentions were clear.  

No wonder Elder Tongyu wanted to avoid the affair. As the leader of the Spirit Medicine Mountain, he might be pressured to choose sides—ally or enemy.  

The Spirit Medicine Mountain’s neutral status relied on the equilibrium between the three sects. Now, that balance was shattered.  

Sending Lin Xuan in his stead was a clever workaround. As a junior, Lin Xuan could claim he lacked decision-making authority, yet his status as the young sect master ensured proper etiquette.  

In short, it was a diplomatic dodge.  

After considering his master’s request, Lin Xuan saw no reason to refuse. He had already been scheming to obtain the Seven-Star Grass—this was a golden opportunity falling into his lap.  

With thousands of cultivators gathering for the event, the ensuing chaos might provide the perfect cover to steal the herb.  

Even if the odds were slim, it was worth a try.  

Moreover, witnessing such a grand occasion would broaden his horizons. There was no reason to miss it.  

Though his mind was made up, Lin Xuan feigned reluctance. "Master, you said yourself this assembly is fraught with danger. I’d rather not get involved."  

Elder Tongyu chuckled. "Don’t worry. As a junior, they won’t pressure you. If they demand a stance, simply defer to me."  

"But..." Lin Xuan still wore a troubled expression. "What if I encounter danger on the way?"  

...  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan emerged from Elder Tongyu’s cave, satisfaction written across his face.  

His feigned reluctance had been a ploy to extract treasures from his master. Though the Spirit Medicine Mountain ranked as a third-rate sect in Youzhou, its wealth—accumulated through alchemy services—was considerable.
