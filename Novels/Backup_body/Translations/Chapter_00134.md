# Chapter 134: The Next Zhongzhou Rogue Immortal Patriarch! Patriarch Zhengjing!

Among the ten celestial stars that descended upon the world, the one that fell upon Mount Yanguan was the closest to Zhongzhou.

Ever since Lin Yuan emerged from the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven and defeated a Human Immortal with his True Qi cultivation, the opportunities within had become the object of desire for countless factions.

Now, various forces had gathered around Mount Yanguan. After much negotiation, they had barely managed to stabilize the situation.

However, in the shadows, the Third Generation Ten Thousand Tribulations Crossing World Heavenly Sovereign of the Golden Ship of Salvation had fled to Mount Yanguan, leaving behind Heavenly Sovereign tokens and legacies in the surrounding area, attracting countless powerful figures from the Golden Ship of Salvation.

The undercurrents had already been turbulent, though they had yet to erupt. But now, another survivor had emerged from the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven!

The situation grew increasingly chaotic!

The various factions, vying for this individual, were on the brink of open conflict.

Even the acting sect master of the Kunlun Immortal Sect, the Young Sect Leader, had personally arrived.

Rumors suggested that the Imperial Preceptor from the capital had also set out for Mount Yanguan.

For a time, Mount Yanguan became a stormy battleground.

Yet, none were aware that forces from the Southern Wastelands were also making their way toward the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven. Among them was the Great Yan Kingdom's army, coming to trade with Li Zhengjing!

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing, whose fame had soared recently after obtaining the opportunities within the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven, was also about to arrive.

However, Li Zhengjing did not reveal his identity outright. Instead, he donned the Wuchang mask and hid the dragon girl, the Five Elements Creation Tree, the Wall-Climbing Bird, Ghost Valley Lingguan, and other distinctive companions inside the Wutong wooden box.

By his side now was a young man named Hao Jian.

After numerous beatings, Hao Jian's mind had grown sharper. Though he hadn't fully recovered—his Three Souls and Seven Spirits were still not in place—he no longer appeared as dazed and confused as before.

"Master," Hao Jian whispered, "The imperial court initially intended to monopolize Mount Yanguan. Now, they've reluctantly agreed to let the three great immortal sects, the two major Buddhist sects, and other first-rate Daoist factions share the spoils. But you, as a rogue cultivator without any sect affiliation, they likely won't let you near. After all, the Southern Wastelands tribes have been wiped out."

"But I, the Wuchang Venerable, am not from the Southern Wastelands. I hail from Zhongzhou."

Li Zhengjing said, "Although most Human Immortals, divine beings, and arhats in the world originate from these top-tier factions, there are also those who rise from humble beginnings."

Zhongzhou was vast, and over the millennia, countless heroes and talents had emerged. Among them were many Human Immortals who had started from lowly origins, initially joining second- or third-rate sects with shallow foundations.

Yet, some had comprehended ancestral legacies, others had created their own techniques through sheer genius, and still others had stumbled upon extraordinary opportunities, transcending the mundane to achieve Human Immortality.

Zhongzhou had even more rogue cultivators—those who had chanced upon cultivation methods, lacking sect affiliations, relying solely on themselves to climb the arduous path of cultivation.

Among them, occasional prodigies emerged, either through innate talent or fortuitous encounters, breaking through the limits to stand above the mortal world as Human Immortals!

In truth, someone like Shi Yuan, who had inherited the legacy of a past Human Immortal, could be counted among them if he ever achieved Human Immortality himself!

"Such individuals must be common in the Eastern Sea as well, no?"

"There seem to be quite a few cultivators of humble origins who achieved greatness," Hao Jian scratched his head. "Some occupy a single island, or even several, establishing their own factions as Human Immortals! Others roam the seas alone, traveling between islands as solitary Human Immortals!"

"In Zhongzhou, such figures are also numerous."

Li Zhengjing said, "Ahead lies Mount Yanguan. If you come alone to claim a share of the spoils, the imperial court's experts will bury you without a second thought! But now, with so many cultivators gathered here—all subjects of the Great Zhou Dynasty—the court must, at least on the surface, maintain order and placate the masses..."

Throughout the ages, Zhongzhou had seen dynasties rise and fall, sects flourish and wither, and countless cultivators vanish into the river of time.

Beneath Zhongzhou's soil lay countless buried secrets.

When fortune smiled upon the fated, they might stumble upon the techniques, Dao arts, or divine abilities of their predecessors. Thus, throughout history, Zhongzhou had never lacked cultivators.

Rogue cultivators, too, passed down their legacies. Over time, these could coalesce into sectarian factions.

Though the Great Zhou Dynasty ruled Zhongzhou, it could not entirely prevent the emergence of new generations of cultivators. For the sake of stability, it could not indiscriminately suppress them!

In the past, the Great Xuan Dynasty, after harvesting opportunities from its debtors, had chosen to forcefully suppress the chaos. But the excessive bloodshed bred fear and paranoia, leading to the collapse of order and the dynasty's eventual downfall.

Learning from this lesson, the Great Zhou Dynasty now sought to placate and recruit cultivators to serve the court.

Only those who violated the law or were deemed heinous criminals faced imperial warrants.

This was also why, after the incident in the capital, the Imperial Preceptor had asked Li Zhengjing to make a statement. Only with the word of the revered Zhengjing Immortal Venerable could all blame be shifted onto the deceased Crown Prince.

"Young friend Zhengjing is quite right. Currently, six Human Immortals have formed an alliance on the outskirts of Mount Yanguan, seeking to claim a share of the spoils."

Ghost Valley Lingguan said, "And under their command are many rogue cultivators at the True Qi realm..."

These individuals typically had no sect affiliations or were the strongest in minor sects with no elders to guide them further.

Their paths of cultivation were fraught with uncertainty. To grasp even a sliver of hope for transcendence, they had no choice but to gamble with their lives.

"This situation is likely further exacerbated by the Golden Ship of Salvation."

Ghost Valley Lingguan added, "Otherwise, the Golden Ship's members wouldn't have been able to search the area around the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven for the Heavenly Sovereign tokens and legacies. Only by rallying Zhongzhou's rogue cultivators here could they fish in troubled waters. Truth be told, even I don't know how many of these so-called rogue cultivators are actually agents of the Golden Ship!"

"The Great Xuan Dynasty and various demonic sects surely wouldn't want to miss the secrets of the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven."

Li Zhengjing said, "Who knows how many of their people are here? Not to mention, the former Gu Yue Peak Master also sent his men, didn't he?"

With so many factions mingling, the situation was murky.

Adding one more Wuchang Venerable would only stir the pot further.

As they pressed forward, they entered a hundred-mile radius around Mount Yanguan.

Here, they encountered many cultivators—mostly rogue practitioners seeking a sliver of opportunity.

Though they knew great risks lurked behind such chances, everyone clung to the hope that they might be the exception.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing wore the Wuchang mask, but the aura he exuded remained at the True Qi realm.

Transcendent Human Immortals and divine beings stood above the mortal world.

But to many ordinary cultivators, the True Qi realm was already the domain of the strong.

As Li Zhengjing drove his carriage forward, the surrounding cultivators tensed, quickly making way.

Just then, a middle-aged man stepped forward.

"Fellow Daoist, how should I address you?"

"This venerable one is the Wuchang Venerable."

"..."

The middle-aged man's expression twisted slightly. "What arrogance."

Typically, titles like "Venerable" were reserved for Human Immortals and other transcendent beings. Yet this man, merely at the True Qi realm, dared to style himself as such?

The surrounding cultivators cast odd glances his way.

The middle-aged man chuckled and said, "I am Zhang Quan. My master is Venerable Jingxu, tasked by the seniors to maintain order here and prevent chaos that might provoke imperial intervention..."

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless, while Hao Jian looked utterly lost.

But the other cultivators nearby wore looks of awe.

Venerable Jingxu was one of the twelve most renowned rogue Human Immortals in Zhongzhou!

Among the twelve Rogue Immortal Patriarchs, Jingxu was the youngest, merely 630 years old and already at the upper Human Immortal realm!

At this moment, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice reached Li Zhengjing's ears.

"I know of this man. He's hailed as a Rogue Immortal Patriarch, with no sect affiliation. He started as an ordinary youth who encountered a dying elder and inherited a body-tempering technique."

"Step by step, he cultivated further, later obtaining an internal energy technique to reach the Internal Qi realm. Then he sought out a True Qi method and even stumbled upon a cache of spirit stones."

"At the age of 100, he plucked a Mystic Crystal Crimson Sun Fruit and broke through to Human Immortality."

"His arduous and legendary cultivation journey has made him a role model for all rogue cultivators in Zhongzhou!"

As Yuan Zhengfeng finished, Ghost Valley Lingguan chimed in.

"He's also the Second Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation."

"..."

Li Zhengjing condensed his True Qi into a thread, sending his voice into the Wutong wooden box.

"Did he recognize the Wuchang mask?"

"No. I modified the mask's appearance in recent years. He wouldn't recognize it."

"..."

Zhang Quan's arrival was merely to assert authority, ensuring everyone maintained order and avoided chaos.

As Li Zhengjing parked his carriage nearby, he overheard others discussing him—or rather, the revered Zhengjing Immortal Venerable.

After the capital incident, where Zhengjing Immortal Venerable resisted the temptation to refine five Human Immortals, divine beings, and thousands of cultivators into a pill, his unwavering Dao heart and benevolent nature saved countless lives.

Though many cultivators perished in the capital's Cave Heaven, over a thousand survived thanks to him.

Word had spread far and wide. Even now, among the rogue cultivators gathered around Mount Yanguan, many were survivors from the capital.

"Though Zhengjing Immortal Venerable hails from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, he's since left the mountain and roams the world alone. He qualifies as the thirteenth Rogue Immortal Patriarch."

"Zhengjing Immortal Venerable is still too young to be called a patriarch."

"Besides, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect hasn't expelled him yet."

"And given his youth, achieving Human Immortality is already astounding. But his foundation is shallow. Among Zhongzhou's Human Immortals, he can't yet rank among the strongest, can he?"

"You're mistaken. In the capital's Cave Heaven, Zhengjing Immortal Venerable fought five Human Immortals and five divine beings single-handedly!"

"Not just that! Rumor has it the Crown Prince had become an Imperial Human Immortal, with twenty-four Dragon Pillars of the Palace—comparable to the leaders of the great immortal sects!"

"Recently, on the southeastern coast, Zhengjing Immortal Venerable fought countless experts to save Elder Gao, who escaped the capital with us. He defeated dozens of Human Immortals and divine beings alone!"

"They say he even repelled the legendary Flame King, who once vied for the throne with the Great Zhou's founding emperor—a true sect master-level figure!"

"The Flame King has lived for over a thousand years. How is that possible?"

"Rumor has it the Flame King is now a divine being. Living this long isn't impossible!"

"Zhengjing Immortal Venerable's prowess already places him among the pinnacle of Human Immortals!"

"Are you all lacking common sense?" someone retorted. "They say he's not even eighteen, with less than a year of cultivation. How could he achieve Human Immortality, let alone become invincible among them? What nonsense!"

"Just because you're trash doesn't mean everyone else is! How dare you slander Zhengjing Immortal Venerable's deeds?"

"Putting that aside, Zhengjing Immortal Venerable is young but already so formidable. Given his strength, his deeds, and his compassion for all beings, he's more than qualified to be Zhongzhou's thirteenth Rogue Immortal Patriarch!"

"Though young, I'd still honor him as Patriarch Zhengjing!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing sat quietly, inwardly pleased.

Hao Jian, however, looked bewildered, thinking, "Is Master really this incredible? And does he truly have such a sterling reputation in Zhongzhou? Have I misunderstood them all this time?"

Yet the aches and pains wracking his body reminded him that his recent experiences felt far more real than these "rumors."

Lies! All lies!

The voices around him only reinforced his skepticism.

Just then, a figure approached and boarded the carriage without invitation.

"..."

Li Zhengjing glanced at him but said nothing.

The man appeared to be in his sixties and sighed. "At such a young age, you've achieved such fame that some would place you among Zhongzhou's Rogue Immortal Patriarchs. Yet who would have guessed that Patriarch Zhengjing is merely a True Qi realm cultivator?"

After a pause, Li Zhengjing asked, "And you are...?"

The elderly man replied calmly, "The Great Xuan Dynasty's Northern Guardian Divine King. Oh, and the current Imperial Preceptor, Lin Fuxuan, is my disciple."

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "Before the capital incident, he crossed paths with Zhengjing Immortal Venerable on the road and lost the Mirror of Profound Clarity. Yet afterward, rumors spread that a Human Immortal calling himself the Wuchang Venerable had defeated the Great Xuan's Imperial Preceptor, Lin Fuxuan..."

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "So this identity isn't so secret after all."

The Northern Guardian Divine King pointed ahead. "Today, another person emerged alive from the Yanguan Mountain Cave Heaven—the second since Lin Yuan."

He stroked his beard. "Tonight will be chaotic. I'd like to ask: Are you interested in seizing this chance to abduct that person and pry the secrets of Yanguan Mountain from him?"
