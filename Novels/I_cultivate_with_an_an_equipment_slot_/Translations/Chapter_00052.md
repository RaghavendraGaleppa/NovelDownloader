# Chapter 52: Our Path of Immortal Cultivation Has Only Just Begun  

"What's wrong?" Zhang Yan turned to Liu Yiting.  

"The elder may not have much time left," Liu Yiting said without hiding anything from Zhang Yan.  

Her fate was now closely tied to his, even more so than her connection to the Liu family. After all, the Liu family was a large cultivation clan with many members. If not for her becoming Zhang Yan's maidservant, most people wouldn’t even know who she was. Even now, whenever Liu Yiting was mentioned, it was still in the context of being Zhang Yan's attendant.  

"Elder Liu..."  

Hearing it was Elder Liu, Zhang Yan sighed. Though he had been in the world of cultivation for some time now, this was the first time he had encountered a cultivator reaching the end of their natural lifespan.  

It was both a blessing and a sorrow.  

To live long enough to die of old age as a cultivator—only Elder Liu could truly understand the bittersweetness of such a fate.  

"Alright, after I visit Wood Spirit Peak, I’ll take you back to the Liu family."  

Zhang Yan knew Liu Yiting wanted to return home. Though her position as his maidservant had granted her some status, it had also cost her freedom. At the very least, she had to remain by his side, ready to serve at any moment. Because of this, she hadn’t been home in quite some time.  

Zhang Yan wasn’t heartless, of course. He wouldn’t stop her from going—in fact, he would accompany her.  

"Thank you, Young Master!"  

Liu Yiting was so moved she nearly cried. Though she had expected Zhang Yan to allow her to leave, his offer to go with her still touched her deeply.  

"Wait here for now. I’ll head to Wood Spirit Peak first."  

With that, Zhang Yan mounted his Golden Bamboo Sword and leisurely made his way to Zhuge Wan’s cave dwelling on Wood Spirit Peak.  

"Greetings, Master!"  

"Rise."  

Zhuge Wan nodded with a gentle expression.  

"I’m sure you’ve already guessed why I called you here. The sect competition is about to begin, and I expect you to achieve outstanding results. Don’t embarrass me."  

Zhuge Wan seemed to place great importance on this competition. She had mentioned it to Zhang Yan multiple times already.  

"Understood, Master. I will not fail you!"  

Zhang Yan was brimming with confidence—not necessarily in himself, but in Zhuge Wan. With her guidance, how could he possibly lose?  

After bidding farewell to his master, Zhang Yan returned to his cave dwelling and prepared to set off for the Liu family with Liu Yiting.  

However, the Liu family was quite a distance from the Qingheng Sect. Traveling solely by sword would be too taxing for his current cultivation level.  

Thus, he rented a flying mount from the sect.  

"Look at this mount, then look at yourself. All you do is eat and sleep—you can’t even carry people properly. Aren’t you ashamed?"  

As Zhang Yan and Liu Yiting boarded the Great-Beaked Crane, he couldn’t resist scolding his own foolish bird.  

To be fair, the bird was quite fortunate. After over two years of Zhang Yan’s care, it had gradually developed a hint of spiritual awareness. With a Beast Transformation Pill, it could even evolve into a demon beast.  

Beast Transformation Pills were alchemical pills that helped spiritually awakened creatures transition into demon beasts. They weren’t particularly expensive, but since the Qingheng Sect wasn’t a beast-taming sect, they didn’t stock many.  

Their trip to the Liu family would take them near the Qingheng Market, where Zhang Yan planned to search for one. If he found it, the bird would be in luck. If not, it would just have to wait.  

Mostly, he had grown attached to it after all these years.  

Well, that, and the fact that the bird had proven to be an excellent poison tester. Over the years, Zhang Yan had fed it numerous toxic pills from the red-faced alchemist, and the bird had survived every single one. Its resistance to poison had grown remarkably.  

Finding another suitable test subject wouldn’t be easy.  

---  

The Great-Beaked Crane wasn’t particularly fast, but it was steady and didn’t consume his spiritual energy. More importantly, it was cheaper than his Greenwood Boat—practicality over luxury.  

Still, riding a flying mount did carry an air of immortal elegance.  

After a day and a half of travel, they arrived at the Liu family estate.  

Outwardly, the Liu family hadn’t changed much since their last visit two years ago. But in reality, the difference was like night and day.  

The Liu family was no longer what it once was.  

They had once been a prominent foundation-establishment clan with two foundation-establishment cultivators and a renowned alchemical legacy. But now, Liu Changfeng was dead, and Elder Liu was on the brink of death. Though their alchemical techniques hadn’t been lost, they had been surrendered to the Qingheng Sect.  

What was once an exclusive inheritance had become common knowledge, inevitably diminishing their influence.  

But such was the way of the cultivation world—the weak had to abide by the rules of the strong.  

As soon as they landed, two cultivators approached to inspect them. Upon recognizing Zhang Yan and Liu Yiting, they quickly escorted them into the Liu family compound.  

"The elder has been waiting for you."  

The cultivator’s tone was somber, but his respect for Zhang Yan was evident.  

---  

"Take me to see him."  

Zhang Yan followed the cultivator to Elder Liu’s cave dwelling.  

The dwelling was sparse, almost barren, containing only a bed. Elder Liu lay there, his spirit waning, surrounded by a few other cultivators.  

"You’ve come?" Seeing Zhang Yan and Liu Yiting, Elder Liu forced himself to sit up slightly and dismissed the others, leaving only the three of them.  

"Elder..."  

Liu Yiting’s voice trembled with sorrow. Though Elder Liu wasn’t her direct kin, he had always treated her kindly.  

*Cough cough.* "Fellow Daoist Zhang, you truly resemble your master more with each passing day."  

"My time is nearly spent. I must trouble you to look after the Liu family in the future."  

In his final moments, Elder Liu’s humility was absolute—he even addressed Zhang Yan with deference.  

"Of course. We’ve already discussed this."  

There was no denying that Elder Liu had poured his heart and soul into securing the Liu family’s future. He had arranged every possible safeguard, ensuring that as long as the family didn’t act recklessly, they could at least preserve most of their assets.  

Naturally, this would require regular "tributes" of spirit stones.  

Surrendering their secret techniques hadn’t been a one-time solution, nor did it guarantee the Qingheng Sect’s eternal protection. It merely granted them the right to pay for that protection.  

After exchanging a few more words with Elder Liu, Zhang Yan and Liu Yiting left. The Liu family had prepared rooms for them.  

Three days later, Elder Liu passed away.  

The family held a funeral and buried him according to tradition.  

Standing before the freshly dug grave, Zhang Yan remained silent for a long time.  

"Young Master."  

Liu Yiting stood beside him, her voice soft.  

"Let’s go. It’s time to return."  

Elder Liu had found his rest, but for them, the path of immortal cultivation had only just begun.
