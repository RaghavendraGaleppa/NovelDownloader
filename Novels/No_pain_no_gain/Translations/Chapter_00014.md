# Chapter 14: Rising to Fame (Seeking Collections, Seeking Follows)

The Third Gang Leader said he'd be back in a flash. He did return, but only half of his personal weapon came back.

After killing the Cyclops, Han Zhen had originally considered just leaving. But upon picking up this spiritual arrowhead, Han Zhen thought that perhaps the bow the Cyclops used was also extraordinary. This arrowhead was clearly part of a set of magical artifacts. As for why the Cyclops had hung the spiritual arrowhead as an ornament around his neck instead of crafting it into an arrow to use against enemies, Han Zhen guessed that he was merely a mortal, unable to unleash the artifact's true power, and also worried about losing the only spiritual arrowhead, which was why he hadn't used it. Instead, it had conveniently fallen into Han Zhen's hands.

For a rogue cultivator who had just entered the cultivation world, obtaining a magical artifact was extremely difficult. Han Zhen naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity that had presented itself. If he could figure out how to use the artifact, it might produce miraculous effects when dealing with Doctor Mo. This was why he dismissed the idea of leaving. This time, even if it meant taking a slight risk, Han Zhen had to get that bow.

Han Zhen's arrival silenced the battlefield. For a moment, the Commander dared not order an incendiary attack on the restaurant. Han Zhen's gaze searched among the Wild Wolf Gang disciples. The Cyclops must have handed the bow to one of them. The Commander, standing at the very front, was the first to feel the oppressive aura emanating from Han Zhen. He knew that the Third Gang Leader's greatest skill wasn't archery, but rather his blade techniques. How much time had passed from when he chased after him until the opponent returned to the battlefield with such ease? Probably less than a quarter of an hour!

Suddenly, Han Zhen's eyes lit up. He spotted the bow in the hands of a blue-robed steward who was protecting the crowd and preparing to fire a sneak arrow. The bow itself was plain and unadorned, completely devoid of any spiritual aura. The moment Han Zhen's gaze locked onto him, the blue-robed disciple felt an intense chill, so cold that his fingers stiffened. As a result, the arrow he was preparing to sneak attack with lost its force prematurely due to nervousness, arching crookedly and landing by Han Zhen's feet. The blue-robed disciple swallowed hard, not out of embarrassment, but out of fear. What he received in return was a thrown armor-piercing arrow, an arrow launched with Han Zhen's full strength, fueled by the Raging Python Strength secret technique. The moment it cut through the air, white qi waves exploded. The gathered disciples had no time to react and were instantly swept away in a straight line. Han Zhen, worried about harming innocents, deliberately aimed away from the civilian houses when he threw it, allowing the blue-robed Wild Wolf Gang disciple holding the longbow to narrowly escape with his life.

Han Zhen then raised his eyebrow-level staff, pointing it towards the Wild Wolf Gang. The Commander looked back at his gang members behind him, seeing many flustered, pale-faced, and completely devoid of fighting spirit. Even more were scared witless by Han Zhen's arrow, dropping their weapons to the ground, their faces showing an expression of impending doom.

With a defeated expression, the Commander then looked at those from the Seven Mysteries Sect who were still resisting. He saw Hall Master Yue, with an arrow still in his shoulder, leading his people out of the restaurant, glaring at him with eyes full of rage. The Seven Mysteries Sect disciples who emerged from the restaurant were few in number, and each was still wounded, but their imposing aura completely overshadowed dozens of Wild Wolf Gang disciples. Perhaps the bloody mist seeping from Han Zhen's body gave the Commander a fleeting illusion, or perhaps the fact that all the Seven Mysteries Sect members were injured made him feel there was still a sliver of a chance.

"Don't be afraid, everyone! He must be heavily injured too. With so many of us, we can wear him down and kill him!" the Commander suddenly roared, channeling his true qi. "All heavy crossbows aim at him! Fire arrows, ready to shoot!" His voice echoed through the long street, and the Wild Wolf Gang disciples snapped back to attention. His roar greatly boosted the morale of the remaining Wild Wolf Gang disciples, who adopted a stance ready for a decisive battle.

"What a hassle." Han Zhen bent his body, accumulating strength. As his words echoed, his entire being shot out like a cannonball.

"Fire!" The moment he saw Han Zhen's movement, the Commander, holding his longsword, immediately gave the order, hoping only to slightly impede him. If he and the three Vice Commanders could form a formation, combining the strength of four, they might not be unable to contend with the opponent. Dozens of glowing steel crossbow bolts and densely packed fire arrows shot towards Han Zhen. An astonishing scene unfolded: the Commander watched as Han Zhen faced the incoming crossbow bolts without any hindrance. His true Qi-infused eyebrow-level staff spun before him like a fiery red light shield, deflecting all the incoming crossbow bolts. Han Zhen, like a fiery dragon, crashed into the crowd. The four accompanying experts of the Wild Wolf Gang collapsed at first contact. Immediately, tragic screams erupted all around. No one could withstand even a single blow from Han Zhen.

While the true qi in Han Zhen's body rapidly depleted, the cool spiritual power within him continuously replenished and nourished his body. And so, as fewer and fewer people remained standing, the green-robed disciples of the Wild Wolf Gang, who had been arrayed on the periphery, finally broke formation and fled. Han Zhen took the longbow from the blue-robed steward. Upon sensing it, he found it had no spiritual aura whatsoever. He tried to pour spiritual power into the bow, but there was no reaction. Han Zhen unleashed his frustration upon the Wild Wolf Gang members who hadn't managed to escape yet. After toiling for most of the day, he hadn't gained any benefits. But in reality, it was just Han Zhen finding an excuse for himself to come back and save people. Hall Master Yue and the two Protectors, disregarding their injuries, pursued the fleeing Wild Wolf Gang disciples in different directions.

Han Zhen looked back. The surviving disciples of the Seven Mysteries Sect looked at him with a mix of gratitude, fear, and shame. After deactivating the Raging Python Strength secret technique, Han Zhen's appearance and rationality returned to normal. Han Zhen looked at the hellish scene around him and couldn't help but retch uncomfortably. After all, he had never experienced such a sight before, and it was one he had personally created. Fortunately, the Seven Mysteries Sect disciples thought Han Zhen's injuries were acting up and didn't read too much into it.

Zhang Xiuer and another female disciple were helping everyone tend to their wounds. When she extracted the arrow from Li Feiyu, he didn't even furrow his brow, remaining cool and expressionless. But when he saw Han Zhen approach, his expression became complicated. Words of thanks reached his lips but couldn't be spoken. Counting the previous instance where Han Zhen stopped him from pursuing the enemy too deeply, Li Feiyu owed Han Zhen two lives.

Upon tallying the losses, this time was disastrous: seven inner sect disciples tragically died, and three were heavily injured, likely halting their martial arts path for good. Wu Yan's body was also found in the alley, provisionally clearing him of suspicion as a potential spy. The number of innocent townsfolk caught in the crossfire was even greater. And so, carrying the bodies that had been preserved, the group returned to the sect with heavy hearts.

Before Han Zhen and the others returned to the sect, news of the incident had already been sent via flying bird message to the Sect Master's desk. The moment this incident became known, the entire Seven Mysteries Sect was shaken!

"This old man killed his son, but my disciple killed the man himself. What kind of situation is this?"

"They say if you beat the young, the old will come. Does this old man really have to call young Han 'Master' now?"

Vice Sect Master Wu, upon learning that Han Zhen was safe and had personally slain his old rival, felt a mix of surprise and joy. Following this, a series of retaliatory actions by the Seven Mysteries Sect began. The Wild Wolf Gang, however, vehemently denied that their Third Gang Leader had died at the hands of a Seven Mysteries Sect youth, further escalating the conflict between the two sides.

After verifying the truth of the matter, Sect Master Wang extensively publicized Han Zhen's talent and bravery. After understanding the cause of this crisis, Han Zhen was allocated a private plot of land for solitary residence and was no longer assigned tasks down the mountain. Whispers even circulated in secret that the sect's high-ranking officials had already decided that Han Zhen would take on the position of Young Sect Master. Furthermore, Han Zhen gained the moniker "Heaven-Overturning Staff." Upon learning this, Han Zhen regretted not choosing to learn swordsmanship. If he were to become an immortal ancestor in the future and this moniker was dug up, it wouldn't be cool at all.

However, all this reached Han Li's ears many days later.
