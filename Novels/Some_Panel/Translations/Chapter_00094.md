# Chapter 93: VIP?

Yang Ji rose, walked out of the great hall, and flew towards the outside of the immortal mountain.

The Myriad Realms Alliance was a major power, with businesses spread throughout the myriad realms. In this Primordial World, they had established shops near every powerful sect. There was a branch of the Myriad Realms Alliance in Wuji City, outside the Boundless Dao Sect, only a few hundred li away. The Boundless Dao Sect had a dedicated teleportation array leading to Wuji City. In just a few moments, Yang Ji arrived outside Wuji City.

He slowly flew into the sky, gazing into the distance, and found that Wuji City was immeasurably vast; even with his Nascent Soul realm eyesight, he couldn't see its end. Inside, tall buildings rose from the ground. Almost every street was paved with precious Heavenly Crystal Stones, emitting a faint white glow that subtly merged with the white clouds above the city, making the entire Wuji City appear like a celestial realm. Truly worthy of being the largest city within the Boundless Dao Sect's sphere of influence, its grandeur was extraordinary.

This city prohibited fighting but not flying. Yang Ji saw many cultivators flying to and fro in the sky among the white clouds, sometimes landing in the city, sometimes taking off from it, truly bustling with activity. Because he was a Dao Sect disciple, the disciples guarding the city gate nodded to Yang Ji, allowing him to enter the city.

Strolling within the city, Yang Ji found that it gathered all kinds of shops. At a glance, cultivators came and went, truly bustling to the extreme. Within the city, some palaces were actually formed by magnified Dao artifacts, truly ostentatious beyond belief. Yang Ji glanced briefly and found information displays for Integration Realm cultivators in many tall buildings; some even had Mahayana cultivators stationed there. It was truly a gathering of dragons and tigers, attracting all the prominent figures. Beneath the ground, spiritual veins were locked by formations, crisscrossing like fields. This wasn't just a city; it was a massive cultivation treasure land, no wonder so many masters resided here.

Yang Ji looked around, skipped the small shops, and after inquiring, flew directly towards the Myriad Realms Alliance. Before long, he stopped in front of an extremely large shop. This shop occupied a street ten li long. Palaces connected, carved from white jade, inlaid with strange stones, like an imperial palace, grand and magnificent. Especially the main gate, like the South Heaven Gate, glimmering with spiritual light and sparkling with treasures. On it hung a couplet:

Upper line: Treasures and divine abilities, all available.
Lower line: Elixirs and materials, nothing is lacking.
Horizontal inscription: Guests from all realms are welcomed.

This couplet, with its vigorous brushstrokes, displayed an extraordinary grandeur, faintly revealing an an aura of dominance and wealth from transactions across the myriad realms. Yang Ji was instantly captivated. A single word emerged in his mind—'extravagant'.

Just as he was staring, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! From time to time, streaks of light descended from the sky—either Dao Sect disciples, rogue cultivators, or disciples from other minor sects—landing in front of the Myriad Realms Alliance, then walking inside. Yang Ji watched, then followed them in.

Inside, the great hall was incredibly spacious. At a glance, the four tall walls, front, back, left, and right, were actually made of light-shadow stone, just like display screens on Blue Star. They displayed a multitude of elixirs, treasures, talismans, and materials, all marked with serial numbers and prices, and the variety was truly dazzling. Yang Ji looked around, immediately searching for the items he needed. However, after looking through everything, he found nothing. He realized that the items for sale were not of very high quality. Top-tier materials were absent, as were great divine abilities. While there were spiritual items that could enhance root bones, there was only the Spirit Cleansing Pill. He had already taken such a pill, and it had no effect on his current superior root bone.

Upon inquiry, he learned that the items sold in the great hall were common cultivation resources, primarily catering to cultivators below the Void Refinement Realm. To purchase high-quality items, one needed to open a VIP room, where a dedicated person would provide service and explanations. Yang Ji exclaimed, "No wonder!" The Myriad Realms Alliance occupied a ten-li long street and built magnificent merchant buildings; it turned out that most of it consisted of VIP rooms.

Upon asking, he was surprised to find that opening a VIP room cost one hundred thousand spirit stones. Yang Ji was stunned, exclaiming that the Myriad Realms Alliance was too good at making money. According to them, these one hundred thousand spirit stones were merely to prevent excessive occupation of the shop's manpower and resources, as too many cultivators just came to look without buying. After all, this was a one-on-one exclusive service, a VIP privilege. The Myriad Realms Alliance's methods were indeed clever. How could an ordinary poor cultivator afford to spend one hundred thousand spirit stones to open a VIP room? Only cultivators willing to spend one hundred thousand spirit stones were truly distinguished guests interested in purchasing top-tier treasures. Only then was it worth their while to provide excellent service.

Yang Ji glanced around, and despite the slight pain in his heart, he walked towards the "VIP Reception" in the center of the hall.

"Senior, do you wish to open a VIP room?" a beautiful and sweet-voiced Foundation Establishment female cultivator asked Yang Ji with a smile.

"Yes," Yang Ji nodded.

"Seeing that senior is dressed as a Boundless Dao Sect disciple, Dao Sect disciples receive a ten percent discount when opening a VIP room," the young woman said, looking at Yang Ji. "However, we still need to see senior's Dao Sect token to confirm your identity."

"There's such a benefit?" Yang Ji's expression shifted. After a moment's thought, he understood that this might be a perk offered by the Myriad Realms Alliance for establishing a shop in the Boundless Dao Sect's territory. While pondering, he slowly handed over his token.

"Senior Yang Ji?" The young woman glanced at it, then suddenly looked up and asked.

"What? Is there a problem?" Yang Ji asked calmly.

"No problem, no problem," the young woman said quickly, her demeanor immediately becoming two points more respectful. "Senior, you are a VIP here with us. You can open a VIP room without paying any spirit stones."

"Oh?" Yang Ji was truly surprised and asked curiously, "This is my first time coming to your Myriad Realms Alliance. How did I become a VIP?"

"I don't know either, but your name is on the VIP list that the Alliance provides us for daily reference. If senior wishes to know the reason, perhaps the person in the VIP room will tell you."

The young woman respectfully returned the Dao Sect token, then took out an access token, and smiled sweetly, "Senior, I have opened VIP room number 125 for you."

"Senior, please come this way. I will lead you to the VIP room," a beautiful maid standing nearby stepped forward and gestured.

"A bit interesting," Yang Ji smiled faintly, feeling curious. He took the access token and followed her upstairs.

"Revered Master, this Myriad Realms Alliance truly knows how to do business. I, Child Buddha, like it," Child Buddha chuckled.

Saving one hundred thousand spirit stones for free, Yang Ji liked it too.

Upon reaching the upper floor, the maid quickly led him to the room. Inside, it was antique in style. In front was a light-shadow stone, immortal spirit tea was on the table, and calming incense burned in the corner, making it elegant, comfortable, and incredibly peaceful. Yang Ji looked around the room, nodded, and the maid discreetly exited.

Soon after he sat down, a heavenly voice gently drifted in from outside.

"Fellow Daoist Yang, I hope you haven't waited long."

From outside the door, a woman in a long white dress walked in with a smile. She was exceptionally beautiful, peerless in grace. Her demeanor was dignified and generous, her brows held a heroic spirit and confidence, and her eyes were clear and bright, radiating intelligence. One could tell at a glance that she was a disciple cultivated by a major power.
