# Chapter 35: Jade Qilin

Standing on the head of the golden lion was a man, similarly clad in full armor, though his was gleaming silver. His eyes gleamed like cold lightning, and his aura was as profound as an abyss and as vibrant as a rainbow. He leaped down from the lion's head, his armor clanking. He too bowed to Emperor Qin.

“Your subject, Zhou Yu, greets Your Majesty!”

“Dispense with the formalities!” Emperor Qin nodded.

Zhou Yu rose from the ground and stood beside the First Prince, Zhou Quan, turning to nod at Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian was slightly startled, then he remembered: this was his eldest brother, Zhou Yu! The First Son of the Qin Emperor, an unparalleled prodigy who dominated an era. Within the same era, throughout the Nine Provinces, those who could contend with him could be counted on one hand!

Following this, more and more people emerged from the magical formation: the Second Prince, Zhou Yan; Zhou Tian's second brother, Zhou Ying; the sons of the Four Great Generals; and some rogue cultivators, all recruited by various families. There were fifteen in total, each a dragon among men, a genius of their generation. Jade Qilin, Blazing Dragon, Thunder Pegasus, Amethyst Lion King… all were rare exotic beasts, incredibly powerful, yet they could only serve as mounts for others.

As the magical formation in the sky gradually shrank, it indicated that no one else would emerge from it, and the welcoming ceremony drew to a close. However, Zhou Zui still hadn't arrived, which made Zhou Tian mutter to himself: "Is the power of [Holy Word] really that great?"

After Emperor Qin delivered some ceremonial remarks, the entire party prepared to head towards the Imperial Palace. The carriages were already prepared. It was the Nine-Dragon War Chariot Zhou Tian had seen in the palace last time, pulled by nine incomparably majestic golden divine dragons. It floated three *zhang* above the ground, and the chariot itself had transformed into a circular platform. Everyone could stand upon it, to be admired, and also to awe those who, due to the Youth Grand Competition, had come to this place without knowing their place! However, Zhou Tian and his companions didn't have this opportunity; they could only follow from afar in another rather 'low-tier' carriage…

The road from the city gate to the Imperial Palace had been sealed off. Every *zhang* interval, a golden-armored Imperial Guard stood sentinel. All Imperial Guards were experts of the Dharma Manifestation realm, possessing astonishing might. Moreover, each guard subtly formed an inexplicable connection with nearby guards, creating a formation. Should any unforeseen event occur, it would instantly coalesce into a peerless grand formation capable of both offense and defense. Meanwhile, the imperial capital's residents watched from not far from the guards. Such a welcoming ceremony occurred every four years, but none had been as grand as this one, with even Emperor Qin personally coming out to greet them. Previously, at most, a minister would be dispatched.

“That’s the First Prince!” An old man from the imperial capital recognized Zhou Quan in the procession, his face flushed with excitement. In the Nine Provinces, everyone cultivated, leading to longevity, so events from a few centuries ago were still clearly remembered.

“And Marquis Dutian, Zhou Yu!” Someone else recognized Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu was known as the number one talent in the Eight Provinces during his era. Emperor Qin, in his delight, bestowed upon him the title 'Dutian' (Heaven-Seizer). Although this caused some objections among civil officials, who cared?

Many figures were recognized. The return of all the descendants of the Four Great Generals caused some discerning individuals to change their expressions, sensing that something significant might be about to happen.

Along the way, chatting idly with a group of old men proved exceedingly boring. Zhou Tian could only 'snatch' Tian Ling back from Liu Yan’s grasp, relishing the warmth of his own girlfriend. However, Liu Yan truly had some skills; in just a short while, she had become as close as blood sisters with Tian Ling. As expected of the Prime Minister's daughter…

“Ling'er, what did Liu Yan talk to you about?” On the way to the Imperial Palace, Zhou Tian couldn't help but ask, noticing the lingering trace of a smile on Tian Ling’s face.

“Nothing much, Sister Liu just chatted with me…” Tian Ling shook her head, looking at Zhou Tian as she spoke, a strange glint in her eyes.

“Sister Liu? Your relationship progressed quite fast. Let me tell you, that Sister Liu of yours is a rakshasa; don't learn from her!” Zhou Tian, like a thief, glanced around. Seeing Liu Yan currently chatting idly with Zhou Xunchuan and others, he leaned close to Tian Ling’s ear, which was smooth and lustrous as jade, and whispered, “I'll tell you a secret: your Sister Liu, she and Zhou Zui…”

Before Zhou Tian could finish, he felt the temperature around him suddenly rise, and a grinding, furious voice sounded.

“Zhou Tian! I went to great lengths to speak well of you to little sister Ling'er, and this is how you slander me behind my back?!” Liu Yan had appeared beside Zhou Tian at some unknown point, her eyes burning with crimson flames that distorted the very void. However, she was still restraining herself, and her power hadn't spread to Zhou Tian.

“Haha… the weather's nice, isn't it!” Zhou Tian rubbed his head, laughing awkwardly, silently cursing himself for being an idiot. These people weren't like him; they all possessed cultivation. What good was whispering, no matter how soft his voice?

Tian Ling saw Zhou Tian's embarrassed expression and covered her mouth, chuckling softly…

On the Nine-Dragon War Chariot, Zhou Yu watched the commotion, his gaze deep. It lingered on Tian Ling as he murmured, “Is that Third Brother's fiancée?”

“Indeed, that’s right. She's the personal disciple of the Haotian Sect Master!” Zhou Yi said, standing beside him.

“Has it been thoroughly investigated? There aren't any ulterior motives, are there?” Zhou Ying asked, a palm-sized Jade Qilin standing on his shoulder, occasionally licking its own paw with its tongue, revealing a comfortable expression. It was impossible to tell that this was an ancient ferocious beast.

“We've investigated. Our 785 spies in the Haotian Sect collectively assess her as: simple-minded and completely unaware of the Haotian Sect Master’s actions!” Zhou Yi spoke slowly. This was his son's fiancée, so naturally, a thorough investigation was necessary.

“Unless she's been hiding it from the very beginning. Although the possibility is small, it's best to rule it out. Second Brother, send the Jade Qilin!” Zhou Yu’s eyes seemed to hold the rotation of suns, moons, and stars, profound beyond measure!

“Understood!” Zhou Ying nodded. The Jade Qilin possessed extremely high intelligence, born with a 'Luminous Heart', capable of discerning right from wrong and understanding human hearts. Looking at the exotic beast on his shoulder, Zhou Ying issued the command. The Jade Qilin nodded in a human-like manner, leaped from his body, and scampered towards Zhou Tian's side!

“I thought Eldest Brother would be the first to marry, but who knew Third Brother would be!” Zhou Ying chuckled, watching the Jade Qilin’s small rump.

“Tian'er was born with blocked meridians, completely isolated from spiritual energy. Even with all methods exhausted, his lifespan would be difficult to extend. I originally intended for him to enjoy all the pleasures of the mortal world, but it seems now that your Third Brother is not simple at all!” Zhou Yi smiled.

“Oh?” Zhou Yu turned to look at his father, a probing look on his face.

“Haha… Some things can't be explained clearly; you’ll gradually understand them later!” Zhou Yi laughed heartily, leaving them in suspense.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian watched in dumbfounded amazement, mixed with envy and resentment, as a dark, round creature leaped onto their carriage, bounced into Tian Ling's embrace, and then wiggled and squirmed, wiggled and squirmed…

“What the heck is that thing? It looks like a Shar Pei!”
