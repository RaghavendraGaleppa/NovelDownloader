# Chapter 48: The Shocking Wave Palm Begins

The training focused on the muscles, bones, and skin. After achieving the harmony of the three external unities, one progresses from the exterior to the interior, cultivating the four realms of flesh, blood, marrow, and Qi.

The Shocking Wave Palm was still a martial art primarily focused on training the tendons, but it emphasized the arms. For Xu Yunfan, who had already achieved great success in tendon training, it allowed his body's major tendons to undergo further comprehensive strengthening.

In the courtyard, Xu Yunfan’s palms flipped and flew like waves. Under the moonlight, three layers of palm shadows actually condensed in front of him.

*‘You are attempting to cultivate the Shocking Wave Palm. You vaguely feel a sense of gain, as if you have understood some of the cultivation methods of the Shocking Wave Palm.’*

Just as a system notification regarding the Shocking Wave Palm appeared in his vision, Xu Yunfan saw that the skill column on his attribute panel now had a gray option for the Shocking Wave Palm: Not Yet Initiated.

As long as it appeared in the skill column, initiation was only a matter of time.

Xu Yunfan didn't pause for a moment and continued to cultivate the Shocking Wave Palm. His arms swayed, revealing distinct lines and visible grooves between his muscles. It was clear to see that with every move he made, the muscles in his arms swelled.

With a single horizontal push of his palm, one could even see the surging of blood and Qi. Under the congestion of blood in his arms, the circumference of his muscles rapidly expanded by several points.

*Bang!*

After two hours, he had completed the seventy forms of the Shocking Wave Palm dozens of times. The skin on his arms had turned a boiling shrimp-like red, but every major tendon was as taut as a bowstring that had been re-tempered.

*‘Your Shocking Wave Palm has been initiated.’*

*‘Shockwave Palm, 0/500 (Initiated)*

*Special Effect: Triple Wave Force, Force Penetrating Armor, Shattering Rock and Jade, Tendons like Strings.’*

While digesting the cultivation memories that had spontaneously appeared in his mind, Xu Yunfan felt strands of warm currents, fine as hair, emerging and wandering throughout his body.

However, most of them gathered in his arms, shoulders, and neck. These strands of warm currents continuously soaked his muscles, giving him a sensation as if he were soaking in a hot spring,酥酥麻麻 (numb and comfortable), and extremely comfortable.

What concerned him most was that, under the accumulated years of practice from his memories, a thin layer of calluses began to cover his palms. This made his hands more numb to pain while simultaneously increasing the lethality of his attacks.

This martial art, when cultivated to a profound level, could targetedly strengthen the human body.

As a Second-Stage Tendon Cultivator, his physical quality had long since surpassed that of an ordinary person.

The Shocking Wave Palm had only just been initiated, so its strengthening effect on his body was extremely limited.

The core muscle group mobilized by this palm technique was transmitted from the back muscles to the shoulder and neck muscles, and then poured into the arms.

A master who refined this art could easily shatter an iron block with a single palm strike.

The initiated level of the Shocking Wave Palm could also easily shatter bricks and stones.

In just two hours, the Shocking Wave Palm had been initiated. By returning to cultivate these martial arts with his realm of great success in tendon training, the efficiency was incredibly high, giving him an unexpected surprise.

Next, as long as he continued to cultivate persistently, he would soon be able to cultivate the Shocking Wave Palm to the state of great success.

That night, he once again formed the Hand Seal of Lin and recited the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water.

*‘You cultivated the Lin Seal seriously. You seemed to vaguely touch upon something, but there was always a thin veil in between, preventing you from seeing clearly. The proficiency of the Lin Seal has increased.’*

*‘You seemed to contemplate the Lin Seal, feeling as if there was something...’*

After the time it took to drink two cups of tea, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes. Although his eyes revealed exhaustion from depleted mental energy, compared to the wooden statue of the Eight-Armed Three-Headed Strength Perception Bodhisattva he had obtained from Qin Bo, it was simply too slow.

According to this progress, this final step of the Lin Seal would likely bottleneck him for half a year.

Half a year!

How could Xu Yunfan endure that? He naturally wanted to take it slow, but whether it was the exposure of his true identity or the discovery by Fei Qi, the Sect Master of the Shocking Wave Sect, that his daughter was gone, and whether he was suspected or not, all required strength to deal with.

Although he had done everything perfectly, this was an ancient world.

In many cases, those sects that casually beat and killed commoners did not reason with logic.

If they believed you were an enemy, they would naturally do everything possible to kill you.

The initiated Lin Seal, whether it was the increase in mental resilience or the boost to comprehension, would definitely have a noticeable increase.

He naturally took it to heart.

While pondering, Xu Yunfan had already laid on his bed and fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, as usual, he carried the War Drum Pot-gold Hammer and practiced the Red Chain Cloak Hammer several times. Finally, Xu Yunfan came back to his senses.

He frowned slightly. This Red Chain Cloak Hammer was indeed extremely compatible with blacksmithing.

Red Chain, Red Chain... could it be a saying about the hammer being swung until it turns red?

"Nonsense!"

At Lu the Blacksmith's shop, Lu the Blacksmith, Lu Yi, upon hearing Xu Yunfan's question, immediately blew his beard and glared.

"It is when one's blood and Qi are like a flood dragon, and one's body is like a furnace. If you..."

Lu Yi said with some emotion, "The Red Chain Cloak Hammer and the Copper Body Skill are integrated martial arts. In the Divine Weapon Ridge, there is a divine heavy hammer that is perfectly compatible with the Red Chain Cloak Hammer, but it requires the cultivation of a more advanced martial art to master it."

Xu Yunfan asked curiously, "What is the name of that divine weapon?"

"The Red Chain Thousand-Jun Hammer."

Lu Yi revealed a hint of nostalgia, then shook his head slightly. "Unfortunately, it has been lost."

Xu Yunfan was speechless. Well, that was pointless curiosity.

He glanced at the several furnaces in the shop, where several apprentice blacksmiths were hammering weapons with great effort.

Over the past half month, Xu Yunfan had frequently visited Lu Yi and invited him to drink at the Long Wind Tavern, so they had naturally become quite familiar with each other.

He asked curiously, "Elder Lu, I've noticed that you've forged many weapons these days. Who placed such a large order?"

Lu Yi said casually, "The Wu Family Fortress outside the city. They said it's for training purposes. I don't care, as long as they pay."

Lu Yi glanced at Xu Yunfan, who was standing there without leaving, and leaned back in his chair, saying lazily, "Go on, what is it actually?"

Xu Yunfan was surprised and praised, "Elder Lu, your foresight is amazing. I, a junior, am ashamed of my inferiority. Why don't we go to the tavern to drink and chat? I heard that the tavern has opened a few more jars of Drunken Branch Wine recently. Shall we go try it?"

Lu Yi's Adam's apple bobbed upon hearing this. He wiped the black oil from his hands with a rag.

"Let's go, let's go."

Arriving at the Long Wind Tavern, in a private room on the second floor, a table of dishes was laid out. After three rounds of wine and five rounds of dishes, the moon was already high in the sky.

Lu Yi's drinker's nose immediately turned red.

"Old, old. Back in the day, I could drink a whole jar of this Drunken Branch Wine without changing expression. Now, it's a bit lacking."

He let out a satisfied burp.

"Go on, what is it?"

Xu Yunfan asked, "Elder Lu, in the entire Qing Prefecture, which school has the longest bone-forgening technique?"

Lu Yi squinted his eyes. He was now drunk and his tongue was loose, speaking more casually.

"What, the Red Chain Cloak Hammer isn't enough?"

Xu Yunfan smiled. "The Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer trains the skin. Naturally, I need the martial arts of the tendon and bone stages to support me."

Lu Yi nodded slightly upon hearing this. He naturally understood that Xu Yunfan had already achieved great success in skin training and needed to consider the tendon and bone stages.

"If you were in the Divine Weapon Ridge, there are deeper advanced martial arts for the Cloak Hammer that can use great success in skin training to temper the bones. But in Qing Prefecture..."

Lu the Blacksmith's knuckles tapped against the yellow poplar wood table. Moonlight from outside the window shone into the wine cup, the moonlight shattered into fine silver scales by the vibrations.
