Chapter 59: Journey to Phoenix Mountain

"I do not like killing!"

Yang Can looked solemnly at Liu Yu, the newly appointed commander of the main branch's guards.

The one who had shouted "Spare the man!" earlier was Commander Liu. As a result, he had stumbled and fallen, and now half of his face was swollen.

Leopard Head stood at the doorway, casting a sidelong glance at Liu Yu. The pebble that caused Commander Liu to stumble had been kicked out by him.

"I weep even when I see wild cats and dogs dead by the roadside," Yang Can continued emotionally.

Xiao Qingmei stood beside Yang Can, looking at her man with a sidelong glance as he spouted such nonsense.

"There's no help for it. I am just such a sentimental man."

Yang Can sighed regretfully.

Liu Yu twitched the corner of his mouth. "Then, why did Executive Yang sit by and watch Lord Zhang use such brutal methods to kill his own uncle, his own son, and his grandnephew?"

"You couldn't stop him either when you arrived, Commander Liu."

"I had no choice. Those ruffians from Feng'an Manor wouldn't get out of the way when they saw me. I was afraid of accidentally hurting someone, so I tripped and fell."

Yang Can shook his head. "So, their deaths are not only the will of the people but also the will of heaven!"

Liu Yu was bewildered. How had Executive Yang suddenly transformed from a good man into a charlatan?

Yang Can sighed again. "The few who were executed committed acts that violated human ethics and aroused public anger. Lord Zhang loves deeply, and thus hates deeply..."

Liu Yu didn't want to hear any more of his nonsense and interrupted him. "Executive Yang, the Clan Lord sent me here to prevent chaos in Feng'an Manor. Given the current situation, I must trouble you to explain this to the Clan Lord in person."

"I was just about to do so!"

Yang Can said, then walked over to Qingmei. "Qingmei, Feng'an Manor is unstable right now. You should stay here."

As he spoke, Yang Can leaned forward slightly, his voice barely audible. "Find out who reported the news to Phoenix Mountain Manor and kill him!"

After saying this, the great philanthropist Yang Can smiled and walked over to Leopard Head.

"Zhang Yunyi is still useful. He must remain as the manor lord to hold the fort. However, you and Kang Zhengyang must keep a close watch on him. As long as the knife handle is in your hands, I can rest easy."

The demon inside Zhang Yunyi's heart had been personally released by Yang Can. The Zhang manor lord, now possessed by his inner demon, had even committed the act of killing his son to prove his path.

Yang Can wasn't sure if he would go on a killing frenzy. However, he needed to solve the trouble of the six manors, so Zhang Yunyi was still useful. Therefore, at least for now, Zhang Yunyi could not die.

Liu Yu watched as Yang Can gave instructions to Leopard Head in a low voice and couldn't help but smile faintly.

So that's it. I sent people to Jige Mountain but couldn't find any trace of you. So you've latched onto Executive Yang? What a pity. Executive Yang is already in a precarious position himself!

"I do not like killing!" Yang Can said with a sincere expression as he looked at Yu Xinglong.

"Nor do I ever believe that killing is a good way to solve problems."

"However, the young master of the Zhang family attempted to kill his father, which drove Lord Zhang into a frenzy. I was afraid Lord Zhang would take even more irrational actions, so... it is better to疏导 (divert) than to block!"

A hint of mockery appeared in Yu Xinglong's eyes. "Do you really think all the illegal activities in Feng'an Manor were done by Zhang Yunyi's son?"

Yang Can shook his head. "Clan Lord, whether it was or not, it must be so now."

Yang Can was very calm now. With the credit for improving the plow, it wouldn't be so easy to kill him. But he wanted more.

Yu Xinglong's eyes narrowed slightly, and he said in a deep voice, "But has the matter truly been resolved? I'm afraid Feng'an Manor is already full of undercurrents now."

"Clan Lord is wise. However, in my opinion, the situation in Feng'an Manor is like a torrent gathering thunder, ready to erupt at any moment. But as long as the Clan Lord sends a steady and experienced minister to take charge of the overall situation, mediating with the art of diplomacy and balancing power with the way of strategy, the dangerous situation will surely hang by a thread without collapsing. With a little more time, the crisis will naturally be resolved."

"A steady and experienced minister..."

Yu Xinglong paced thoughtfully for a few steps, then suddenly stopped and turned to look at Yang Can. "I heard you developed a new plow in Feng'an Manor, which is said to greatly improve farming efficiency?"

"Yes. While I was inspecting Feng'an Manor, I had a sudden inspiration in the fields and made some improvements to the plow."

Yu Xinglong's gaze suddenly turned cold. "Why didn't you report this to me?"

If the six manors were not reorganized, then he would have taken them back from Yu Huanhu for nothing. But if he were to reorganize them, it might result in a pyrrhic victory. Therefore, Yang Can's unique idea of a "great blood exchange while keeping the signboard" was something Yu Xinglong approved of. In fact, in his heart, he quite admired this method. But he hated the feeling of losing control. The improved plow had been a success, yet such a major event, Yang Can had never reported it to him from beginning to end. Did this Yang Can still have him, the Clan Lord, in his eyes? After the incident with the second branch, Yu Huanhu, Yu Xinglong had become particularly sensitive to matters beyond his control.

Hearing this, Yang Can couldn't help but show a difficult expression. "Clan Lord, I had no one to use."

Yang Can was not panicked at all. He had handed over Lord Zhang's hidden fields and hidden households without reservation. He was confident he could cover up the matter of the new plow.

"When you came down the mountain, didn't the main branch equip you with some old servants of the manor?"

"There were! But the young madam's personal maid, Qingmei, never leaves my side for a moment." Yang Can complained, "Every move I make is seen by her. As soon as I thought of the method to improve the plow, she immediately reported it to the young madam. Under what pretext could I send someone else back to the mountain?"

Yu Xinglong narrowed his eyes slightly. "I've heard rumors that you and this Qingmei have a secret affair."

Yang Can gave a bitter smile. "Clan Lord, a beautiful young girl and a man are inseparable, even watching him at night. Of course, such rumors will arise."

Yu Xinglong fell silent upon hearing this. After a long while, he let out a long sigh. "If I were to hand Feng'an Manor over to you, could you guarantee it would 'hang by a thread without collapsing'?"

Yang Can was surprised. "Clan Lord, I am only the Second Executive of the main branch..."

Yu Xinglong waved his hand. "Feng'an Manor is the closest to Phoenix Mountain. Given its current state, it is most appropriate for you to concurrently hold the position of manor lord."

This move was entirely within Yang Can's预料 (expectation); he didn't even need to guide the situation. Because Feng'an Manor was now full of problems, even more complicated than before he came down the mountain. Before this, no one was willing to touch this hot potato, let alone now? Yu Xinglong's trusted confidants would not be willing to be thrown into this pit. But among those Yu Xinglong did not trust but who had the ability to handle the situation, who was more suitable than him?

Yang Can put on a reluctant expression, yet had to accept this mess. "Yes. As the Clan Lord commands, I shall obey the order."

Yu Xinglong nodded in satisfaction. "Go and see the young madam. You must still show the respect that is due!"

As soon as Yang Can left, Yu Xinglong asked without turning his head. "Has Huanhu made any contact with Yang Can?"

Steward Deng Xun replied, "Our spies have been watching. The second branch has not had any contact with Executive Yang so far."

Yu Xinglong nodded. "Keep watching. Report any news to me immediately!"

"Show the respect that is due?"

Suo Chanzhi mimicked Yu Xinglong's tone, looking at Yang Can with a charming pout. "Is this how you respect me?"

"Isn't it? This is the greatest respect for a beloved beauty."

Yang Can gently pressed down on Suo Chanzhi's fragrant shoulder, speaking with a serious expression.

"Go away. I was playing the zither. If the music stops for too long, the servants will get suspicious."

"I know how to play the zither. I'll do it!"

How could a private secretary not know how to play the zither? After becoming Yu Chengye's advisor, Yang Can had studied it properly. Of course, to this day, Yang Can had only learned one piece: "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom." He couldn't play any other piece.

Here, the flowers and trees were lush, and the flowing water wound through corridors. It was a place for leisure and enjoyment in the rear courtyard of the main branch. It was now mid-April, and the garden was lush with vegetation in full bloom. Bees and butterflies danced, adding a touch of wild charm. A pond of clear water with lotuses, a few old willows by the water, and a few clumps of reeds swaying by the lake shore. The area was shaded by greenery all around, with only a winding path. Although it was outdoors, it was very private.

Suo Chanzhi, with skin like jade and hair styled in a cicada-like bun, was originally sitting at a square zither table playing. When Yang Can came to see her, he was led here. Suo Chanzhi's prestige in the inner residence was growing day by day. The people serving her closely were all dowry servants from the Suo family, and all the old servants of the main branch had been transferred away. Therefore, meeting Yang Can here, no one dared to comment. Although this place was not a secret room, it was surrounded by dense shrubs. So, as long as the zither music continued, it would dispel some of the servants' suspicions. Since the young madam's hands were never still playing the zither, she definitely couldn't be doing anything else. So, what did it matter if the place to meet an outer residence executive was a bit secluded?

A piece, "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom." Yang Can lightly plucked and stroked, the zither's notes rippling like water. Occasionally, the music would go out of tune, either plucking the wrong string or applying too much force. However, only someone with considerable skill in zither playing would notice. "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom" was repeated who knows how many times, yet the player's technique never became proficient; instead, there were more mistakes. Finally, the zither notes faded away. Not long after, Executive Yang came out from the winding path and went to the outer residence.

Two maidservants walked gracefully into the depths of the greenery. The young madam was holding a cup of tea and spitting the tea back into the cup. "You came just in time. This tea tastes 'stale.' Brew a fresh pot." Suo Chanzhi calmly put down the cup. Her lips were bright red, seeming even fuller than usual.

Suo Chanzhi had been in a very pleasant mood lately. She had a child now, and whether it was a boy or a girl was not something she needed to worry about at the moment. Her control over the inner residence of the main branch was getting better and better. Having a powerful maiden family was her absolute confidence. Even though they knew she was purging the old servants of the main branch on a large scale in the inner residence, the Clan Lord and the Clan Lord's wife both pretended not to hear or see. There was no help for it; the Clan Lord still needed the Suo family's help to strike against Yu Huanhu's forces. When he had to rely on others, how could he put on the airs of a father-in-law or mother-in-law?

Yang Can had improved the plow, and she took half the credit for this. Hmm... if not for that, she wouldn't have given in to his absurd request so easily just now. It was a little reward for him. Now, Yang Can had also obtained the position of manor lord of Feng'an Manor, and concurrently at that. The outer residence of the main branch was not like the inner residence; even she couldn't make a big move against the outer residence, let alone that Yang Can was only a Second Executive in the outer residence, subordinate to Li Youcai. Yang Can was both guarded against by Yu Xinglong and suppressed by Li Youcai, making it difficult for him to develop his own forces in the outer residence. Now he had found a new path, using Feng'an Manor as a foundation, which would allow him to open up the situation. Everything was getting better. Suo Chanzhi hadn't even done much; she was completely "winning while lying down." She was naturally full of joy.

In the depths of the greenery, the sound of the zither started again. This time, "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom" was played with incredible fluency and grace.
