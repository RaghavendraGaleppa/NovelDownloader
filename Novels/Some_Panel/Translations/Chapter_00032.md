# Chapter 32: Grand Divine Art

Yang Ji paused, looking up towards the end of the main street, where the most unique shop stood. It wasn't built on either side of the street, but rather in the very center at the end of the main thoroughfare, like a grand palace. Though only a three-story pavilion, it was constructed entirely from millennium-old golden sandalwood. Ancient charm permeated the air, spiritual light shimmered faintly, giving it an imposing and magnificent aura. Positioned centrally, it didn't disrupt the overall layout; instead, it seemed like a dragon's head raised high, suppressing the four directions.

This shop was unique precisely because its signboard read "Canglan Pavilion." This was the shop opened by the Canglan Sect itself, which was why it could command such a central and prominent position. Yang Ji had yet to enter this particular shop, and it was his last hope.

Yang Ji now stepped forward, walking towards Canglan Pavilion, and soon entered its grand hall. The first-floor hall was spacious, with minimal furnishings, only a long row of horizontally placed sandalwood counters. Each counter offered consultations for talismans, magical artifacts, pills, materials, cultivation methods, spells, and other services. Many cultivators were browsing, and numerous clerks inside the counters were providing introductions.

Yang Ji quickly scanned the area and headed towards an unoccupied counter. Seated within was a young maiden, appearing somewhat naive and adorable.

"Immortal maiden, may I ask if you have Companion Demon Grass for sale here?" Yang Ji inquired with a polite smile.

"Immortal maiden?" The girl slowly looked up, her large, intelligent eyes briefly swiveling. A hint of [Joy] appeared above her head. She then smiled sweetly and replied, "Fellow Daoist, we do not have Companion Demon Grass for sale here."

"None? Not even here?" Yang Ji's brows furrowed upon hearing this.

"Fellow Daoist, Companion Demon Grass is very precious and incredibly useful; it can be refined into Demon Essence Pills. Any that appear are submitted directly to the sect," the maiden said with a slight smile.

Upon hearing this, Yang Ji felt a touch of disappointment, but he still smiled at the maiden: "I know how valuable Companion Demon Grass is, but I didn't expect that even a place like Canglan Pavilion wouldn't sell it. I suppose other places would have even less."

"Indeed, even we don't have it. If Fellow Daoist wishes to acquire Companion Demon Grass, you'll have to search for it yourself in the Demonic Scent Sea. There are many demon hunters there, and quite a few disciples from the three great sects. If you have enough spirit stones, you might be able to purchase first-hand Companion Demon Grass from them. Many of them aren't alchemists; they only bring the grass back to sell for spirit stones," the maiden said, smiling enthusiastically.

"It seems I'll have to go to the Demonic Scent Sea," Yang Ji murmured, his brows slightly furrowed. Before that, however, he intended to purchase an elixir formula. So, he asked, "Immortal maiden, how many spirit stones for a copy of the Demon Essence Pill formula?"

Although there was no Companion Demon Grass, he knew from Huoyuan that the Demon Essence Pill formula was available and had been passed down from ancient times.

"The Demon Essence Pill formula is one thousand spirit stones," the maiden nodded.

This price was within Yang Ji's expectations. After all, the Demon Essence Pill formula was widely circulated, and many cultivators had purchased it for study. After all these years, it was no longer a great secret. One thousand spirit stones was a reasonable price.

After Yang Ji paid the spirit stones, he received the elixir formula the maiden handed him. He then asked, "Immortal maiden, do you have any high-level spells for sale here?"

Before heading to the Demonic Scent Sea, he planned to purchase a few high-level spells. The Demonic Scent Sea was, after all, a gathering place for demonic beasts. If he couldn't acquire Companion Demon Grass from other cultivators, his only option would be to search for it himself in the sea. Searching would inevitably mean encountering demonic beasts and engaging in battle. The perfected Water Tracing Sword Art was still a bit weak, lacking sufficient power. He wanted to cultivate a few more profound spells. He had searched before on Nanfeng Island, but all the major shops only sold low-level spells and low-level cultivation methods, with no high-level spells, not even mid-level ones. His inquiries proving fruitless, he had placed his hopes on Canglan Pavilion.

"High-level spells? Fellow Daoist, I'm sorry, we don't have those here," the maiden shook her head.

"Then what about mid-level spells?" Yang Ji asked again.

"We don't have mid-level spells either. We only sell low-level spells and low-level cultivation methods," the maiden smiled. "High-level spells and cultivation methods are the most precious; you can't buy them even with spirit stones. You can only acquire them by joining a sect or becoming a guest elder of a prominent family."

"Is that so?" Yang Ji's brows slightly furrowed. Although he had vaguely guessed such an outcome, hearing it directly still brought a touch of disappointment.

Noticing Yang Ji's expression, the maiden smiled mysteriously and said, "Don't be disappointed. While I don't have high-level spells, I do have a recording that I believe Fellow Daoist might find interesting?"

"Oh? What kind of recording?" Yang Ji asked curiously.

"It's a sword practice recording of our sect's Senior Jian Yuanzi. Senior Jian Yuanzi specifically released this recording ten years ago, stating that anyone who could comprehend even a move or half-move from it would be accepted as his disciple. As soon as this news spread, countless disciples of our Canglan Sect immediately purchased the recording to watch. However, for all these years, no one had gained any insight from it. It wasn't until a year ago when our sect's Senior Brother Li Changxiao emerged from seclusion. Upon hearing of this, he purchased the recording and, after watching it, comprehended half a move from it. Senior Brother Li Changxiao once said that this half-move was exquisitely profound, far surpassing all high-level spells," the maiden said, smiling.

"Far surpassing all high-level spells?" Yang Ji's heart was truly filled with curiosity.

"Little Lingzi, are you tricking people into buying recordings again?" At this moment, a young man who had been listening from the adjacent counter for a long time spoke with a laugh.

"Hmph, Senior Jian Yuanzi said this! Are you, stinky senior brother, going to question the old man?" the maiden retorted, pouting.

Yang Ji glanced indifferently at the young man, noticing his rather handsome appearance, eyes shimmering with spiritual light and full of wisdom. He wore the same white robe as the maiden, suggesting he was also a Canglan Sect disciple. The young man, noticing Yang Ji's gaze, also smiled kindly and nodded, with [Interested.] appearing above his head.

Interested? Yang Ji paused slightly, then retracted his gaze and looked at the maiden: "Immortal maiden, could you let me see the recording?"

"No, you can't. You can only view it after you buy it. What if you watch it and then don't buy it?" the maiden said, shaking her head with a smile.

"Isn't that coercive selling?" the young man chuckled.

"Hmph! I don't want to talk to you," the maiden pouted.

"How many spirit stones?" Yang Ji asked.

"Ten thousand spirit stones, non-negotiable," the maiden replied.

"Ten thousand?" Yang Ji's peripheral vision caught the young man, and he deliberately feigned a pained expression, hesitating for a long time before finally paying the spirit stones and acquiring the recording jade slip.

As soon as his spiritual consciousness probed it, he saw a figure, sharp as a sword, practicing swordplay. Before he could make out their appearance, information immediately appeared, causing Yang Ji's heart to tremble: [A sword dao recording, intense sword intent, Grand Divine Art.]

This was a sword technique from a Grand Divine Art? Grand Divine Art! He knew what these four words meant; even the strongest spells of the three great sects were no more than this. Although his heart was filled with excitement, he remained outwardly calm, slowly putting away the jade slip.

Exhaling, he then asked the maiden about other spells, also purchasing a low-level transformation spell and a low-level concealment spell.

After completing all his purchases, he subtly glanced with his peripheral vision and saw the young man who had been looking at him before, smiling. The [Interested] above his head had turned into [Very Interested]. This couldn't help but make Yang Ji secretly frown. Was it because he had revealed his financial strength? But as a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, this amount of spirit stones wasn't really a lot. Who didn't have tens of thousands on them? His thoughts swirled, unable to pinpoint the reason. Yang Ji stopped thinking about it and turned to walk out of Canglan Pavilion.

But the young man immediately followed him, asking with a smile, "Fellow Daoist, are you an alchemist?"
