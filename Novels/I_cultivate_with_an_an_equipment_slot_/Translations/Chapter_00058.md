# Chapter 58: Replenishing Spiritual Roots  

"Ten-thousand-year Bamboo? That's indeed a rare find—perfect for crafting a spirit-grade flying sword."  

The moment the Ten-thousand-year Bamboo was revealed, it immediately drew the attention of everyone present.  

Flying swords had always been the luxury items among magical artifacts, demanding the finest materials—typically ultra-rare metals—to achieve their legendary sharpness.  

But the Ten-thousand-year Bamboo was different.  

Though a wood-attribute material, it was exceptionally resilient and possessed an innate affinity for wood-based spiritual energy, making it suitable for crafting flying swords. Admittedly, it couldn't quite match the prowess of metal-attribute flying swords, but...  

Even so, it was still a primary material for flying swords—and an expensive one at that.  

The moment the cultivator revealed the bamboo, the atmosphere grew heated.  

"What does the esteemed Daoist wish to exchange for?" someone immediately asked, unable to contain their eagerness.  

"My demands are modest—just two top-grade magical artifacts," the Daoist replied before falling silent, waiting for offers.  

"Two top-grade artifacts? That's quite the appetite!" The cultivators in the room erupted in protest.  

Top-grade magical artifacts, though not spirit-grade, were still incredibly valuable.  

The Ten-thousand-year Bamboo was indeed precious, but it was merely material for a spirit artifact, not the artifact itself.  

At best, their values were comparable.  

This demand naturally filtered out those who didn’t urgently need the bamboo—there was no room for bargaining here.  

"I have two top-grade artifacts. Take a look."  

A burly man stood up and produced two items: a hammer and a token.  

The hammer was clearly an offensive artifact, but the token was far more intriguing. When activated, it could summon a dense fog to obscure vision and even generate a protective barrier—an excellent auxiliary artifact.  

The owner of the Ten-thousand-year Bamboo was visibly tempted.  

Just as the deal seemed imminent, Zhang Yan quickly interjected, "Esteemed Daoist, I also have two artifacts to offer."  

With a flick of his storage pouch, a golden and a yellow light materialized before the crowd.  

"A top-grade flying sword and a defensive artifact. How does this sound?"  

Both artifacts had been gifted to him by his sect elders, but since they were newly forged and he lacked the cultivation to refine them, they had remained unused.  

Today, they served as perfect bargaining chips for the Ten-thousand-year Bamboo.  

"I accept your offer!" The bamboo’s owner eagerly agreed the moment he saw Zhang Yan’s flying sword.  

Zhang Yan’s artifacts were not only top-grade but also pristine, unlike the burly man’s, which bore signs of wear and hidden damage from prolonged use.  

"Agreed. However, your Ten-thousand-year Bamboo falls slightly short in value. If you wish to proceed, you’ll need to compensate the difference," Zhang Yan said shrewdly.  

"Naturally."  

The man didn’t argue.  

After some private negotiation, he supplemented the deal with two second-hand artifacts, and the exchange was finalized.  

Zhang Yan was more than satisfied.  

Beyond the potential attributes of the acquired artifacts, the Ten-thousand-year Bamboo itself held immense value for him—it was one of the spiritual materials mentioned in the *Art of Spirit Nourishment*.  

He could absorb its spiritual essence to replenish his own spiritual roots.  

*I wonder how much this bamboo can improve my spiritual root grade.*  

Zhang Yan had long yearned to enhance his spiritual roots, and now, fortune had finally smiled upon him.  

With this single transaction, the entire gathering had already been worth his while.  

But he wasn’t ready to leave yet—there were still more deals to be made.  

Admittedly, though this gathering was hastily organized, the quality of goods was surprisingly high. Rare spiritual materials, typically hard to come by, were abundant here.  

Most, however, were related to plant-based cultivation—hardly surprising, given that this was a competition hosted by the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace, attended primarily by spirit botanists.  

Soon, it was Zhang Yan’s turn to take the stage.  

Calmly stepping forward, he addressed the crowd:  

"Today, I seek to trade for second-hand magical artifacts. Price is negotiable. Those with such items are welcome to approach me."  

With that, he took a seat on a nearby cushion and waited.  

"Esteemed Daoist, I have a mid-grade flying artifact. Would you consider trading for it?"  

A female cultivator approached shortly after. Her voice sounded young, and given that she was offering a mid-grade artifact, her cultivation level was likely modest.  

"Let me see."  

Zhang Yan accepted the artifact.  

It resembled a soft, cloud-like object, its texture oddly pliant—almost like... *something else*.  

He inspected its attributes:  

**[Artifact Name]:** Fluffy Cloud Pouch  
**[Grade]:** Mid-grade Magical Artifact  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Effects]:**  
- **Fragrance (Lv.1):** When equipped, the user emits a faint floral scent.  
- **Levitation:** Allows brief hovering.  

*Gray quality, as expected.*  

Both attributes were practically useless.  

*Why would a flying artifact have a "fragrance" attribute?*  

Despite his internal吐槽, Zhang Yan proceeded with the trade, paying in spirit stones.  

With the first deal sealed, others soon followed.  

But Zhang Yan was selective—not every artifact was worth acquiring.  

After all, money didn’t grow on trees, and even a wealthy man had to budget.  

Moreover, he noticed something intriguing: many of these artifacts contained knowledge related to spirit botany.  

He didn’t hesitate to purchase them all.  

Once he absorbed their attributes, he’d undoubtedly become a formidable figure in the field of spirit botany.  

Even a Golden Core cultivator wouldn’t be able to deny it.  

*He’d make sure of that.*  

**PS:** *Today’s been rough—caught a cold, fever, body aches, and now diarrhea after dinner. Truly miserable. One more chapter to go tonight.*
