Chapter 103: Dealing with Evil Demons and Outsiders Doesn't Require Reasoning!

The Lingjiang Pier.

The sky was dimly lit, with the sunset not yet over and the moon rising.

The temple fair at the pier was coming to an end.

The temple abbot, smiling, plucked a string, and the Buddha statue's head flew off, landing on his own head.

He turned around, looking at the three figures behind him.

"Are you here to burn incense, pray, or make a wish?" he asked.

The one wearing a dragon-headed mask stepped forward and replied, "It's better to rely on oneself than to beg others."

The abbot, still smiling, nodded slightly, seemingly pleased with the response. "You three have given me a surprise. From today on, you'll be part of the Xi Yu Lou. You can go to the Dark Building to receive your rewards."

"If you complete the task successfully, you'll be promoted to Ren Tu," he added, opening his palm to reveal three copper swallows.

The copper swallows seemed to have a life of their own, flapping their wings as if they were alive.

"Don't worry, you'll receive the copper swallows after completing the task," he reassured them.

The Huai Shan San Sha exchanged glances, and the dragon-headed one asked, "What is the task?"

The abbot replied calmly, "Just accompany me to deliver some goods downstream. Remember, this is a secret mission. Don't let anyone from the Qingyuan Zong know, or they'll interfere."

"Once the news leaks out, no one will be able to save you," he warned.

The three men looked at each other, falling silent.

The abbot thought they were hesitant due to the risk, so he continued, "I've been working here at the pier for over a decade. I've seen fishermen catch fish, and I've learned a truth: the bigger the waves, the more valuable the fish."

"If you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve greatness," he said with a smile.

After a moment of silence, Li Mo asked, "What goods are we delivering?"

The abbot patiently replied, "Just some children to be sent to the Wan Mo Jiao's hideout."

The Huai Shan San Sha looked at each other, and the dragon-headed one said, "We're willing to do our part."

Just as the abbot was about to nod, a dagger emerged from the shadows, stabbing towards his back.

The abbot, being in the Guan Shen realm, dodged the attack with ease and countered by pinching the dagger.

The atmosphere around them changed, filling with a cloudy mist that seemed to accumulate wind and rain.

The abbot soon realized that this was not a true realm, but the icy intent still chilled him to the bone.

"Wen Bing!" he exclaimed.

A gust of wind blew, and the inner breath sword light and silent knife aura rolled in, causing the blood light around him to sway.

He raised his palms, pushing forward to disperse the sword and knife.

However, two shining swords followed, one red and one blue, entwined like ice and fire dragons.

The swords clashed, producing a loud clang.

The abbot coughed out a mouthful of burning ice residue.

"This sword almost killed me," he thought.

Strangely, his body showed no wounds, but the golden Buddha statue in the temple darkened significantly.

"If I hadn't spent over a decade cultivating here, I'd be in trouble today," he thought.

Li Mo appeared with a hammer, saying, "When dealing with evil demons and outsiders, don't reason with them. Let's attack together!"

"I'll smash the Buddha statue, and you kill him," he instructed.

The abbot was taken aback, "You..."

He tried to stop them but didn't dare to fight the other three.

Wen Bing was too terrifying, and even one-on-one, he might be overpowered.

Now, with Li Mo joining in, he was in a precarious situation.

The abbot learned that Li Mo wasn't a swordsman; he used a hammer.

The hammer fell, unleashing a mighty force, like thunder rumbling on a spring day.

The abbot threw out a string of black Buddhist beads, hoping to block the attack, but they were destroyed by the dissipated energy.

The accumulated wishful energy from over a decade was crushed.

The golden statue cracked, revealing the white bones beneath.

The abbot couldn't resist the cold sword aura anymore.

The wind blew, and his body was pierced, turning into a sieve, with blood frozen by the frost.

Meanwhile, a young man in brocade clothing, who was inquiring about something along the street, heard the commotion and froze.

"That direction... is the Mi Tuo Temple, where we usually pray for safety before fishing," an old fisherman said.

The young man's eyes lit up, and he rushed towards the source of the noise.
