Chapter 77: A First Glimpse of the Cultivation World

“To be honest, I am Chen Xinan, a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion.”

From within the Myriad Souls Banner, Chen Xinan spoke with a sincere and righteous expression, “I was harmed by the evil cultivator Liu Xin in my previous life, embarrassing myself in front of fellow Daoist.”

“Oh?” Lu Yang narrowed his eyes upon hearing this.

Young man, you’re not being honest!

Compared to other banner spirits, Chen Xinan’s state was clearly problematic; he seemed to have genuinely retained some autonomy and could think normally.

He even knew how to lie!

Lu Yang smiled as he looked at Chen Xinan: “Fellow Daoist, please don't be anxious. I will now destroy this harmful evil artifact so that you all can rejoin the cycle of reincarnation.”

“Wait, wait!”

Before Lu Yang finished speaking, Chen Xinan quickly interjected to stop him. Seeing Lu Yang look at him in confusion, he rolled his eyes and then sighed, “Fellow Daoist, you don’t know this, but this artifact refines our true spirits. If you destroy it, not only will we be unable to transmigrate, but we will also be buried with it.”

—This was a lie.

In his previous life, Lu Yang had cultivated painstakingly for a hundred years, polishing the Myriad Souls Banner to an extreme degree. His understanding of it surpassed even Liu Xin’s, and he was intimately familiar with its mysteries.

So, he instantly saw that Chen Xinan was lying.

But why was he lying?

Lu Yang’s mind raced. Logically, the banner spirits on the Myriad Souls Banner were no different from dead people. To be able to transmigrate was already a great blessing from heaven, so who could be exempt?

Could this Chen Xinan have another method to return to life?

“Interesting.”

Lu Yang smiled, then spoke without any reservation, “Fellow Daoist, are you intentionally deceiving me? Do you have some secret? Would you be willing to share it?”

Upon hearing this, Chen Xinan was instantly stunned.

In a flash of lightning, he had already thought of an answer, but before he could speak, he suddenly felt his vision go dark, and his consciousness became blurry.

“Trying to soul-search me?”

Chen Xinan was calm at first, quickly activating a divine ability to protect his mind, and even preparing to forge a false memory to fool Lu Yang.

However, in the next second, his expression froze.

Because he clearly saw a majestic golden figure, towering to the heavens, forcefully crashing into his sea of consciousness, instantly suppressing all his divine abilities!

“Divine Authority!?”

How could this be!

As a true disciple of the Saint Sect, Chen Xinan naturally knew what he was looking at. And Lu Yang, directly suppressing him with his divine authority (from the Saint Thief technique), also didn't intend to give him any chance.

“Tell me, what are you plotting?”

Lu Yang chuckled, effortlessly manipulating Chen Xinan’s sea of consciousness, and quickly extracted streams of information he wanted from his memory.

The next second, Chen Xinan’s lips moved, and he spoke uncontrollably, “I cultivated a great divine ability called 'Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to Behold the Heavenly Silkworm within Me'. It allows me to divide my divine sense and perform body snatching. I planned to deceive you first, then find a way to take over your body, so I could be reborn.”

“Interesting…”

Looking at the sweating Chen Xinan, Lu Yang chuckled and continued, “It is as hard as ascending to heaven for a banner spirit to devour its master. How did you originally plan to take over my body?”

“It’s simple, I would transmit the 'Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to Behold the Heavenly Silkworm within Me' to you.”

“This is a great divine ability; you couldn’t possibly not be tempted.”

“However, this great divine ability is extremely special. Cultivators need to sever nine separate consciousnesses from their own mind and then unify them with a secret method…”

“But I wouldn’t transmit the secret method for unifying the separate consciousnesses.”

“Therefore, once you cultivated it, you would inevitably split into nine different consciousnesses, each wanting to be the master. The result would be a struggle between the snipe and clam, and I, the fisherman, would reap the benefits.”

After listening to Chen Xinan’s description, Lu Yang was somewhat moved.

Suddenly, his heart stirred, and he asked again, “Are you truly Chen Xinan?”

Upon hearing this, Chen Xinan immediately fell silent, a struggling expression on his face. However, in the end, he couldn’t resist Lu Yang’s divine authority.

“…Strictly speaking, no.”

“The real ‘Chen Xinan’ is already dead. I am merely one of the separate consciousnesses he severed in the past… But since he’s dead, then I am Chen Xinan!”

Lu Yang marveled after hearing this, and was quite tempted by the great divine ability Chen Xinan spoke of, the 'Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to Behold the Heavenly Silkworm within Me'. According to Chen Xinan’s description, once this great divine ability was mastered, it could not only increase one’s divine status but even allow one to condense ‘divine sense’ ahead of time, which usually only cultivators in the Foundation Establishment realm possessed!

This point was particularly crucial.

Because breaking through to Foundation Establishment was precisely a process of transforming spiritual sense into divine sense. And if you transformed it ahead of time, it would be immensely helpful for building your immortal foundation.

“Senior Brother Chen, it’s good that you died.”

“In this life, I really found the right person by looking for you!”

It has to be said that this divine authority was practically a cheat code for suppressing weaker opponents. Otherwise, it would have been almost impossible for Lu Yang to dig out so much information from Chen Xinan.

And now, with the enhancement of divine authority, Chen Xinan spoke freely and revealed everything without reservation, including the complete text of the 'Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to Behold the Heavenly Silkworm within Me', which Lu Yang extracted one by one. After all this was done, Lu Yang withdrew his divine ability and looked at Chen Xinan, who had regained his autonomy and wore a desolate expression.

“…You are a disciple of the Saint Sect, aren’t you?”

After a long silence, Chen Xinan finally spoke, his tone very firm, “Such actions could only be carried out by a disciple of our Saint Sect.”

Thinking of this, Chen Xinan looked at Lu Yang again, his tone complex, “You killed Liu Xin, yet you’re not in the Sky-Connecting Cloud Sea. Could it be that you also plan to betray the sect?”

Upon hearing this, Lu Yang raised an eyebrow, “…Also?”

Instead, Chen Xinan tilted his head, looking puzzled, “What’s so strange about it? Given the Saint Sect’s nature, it’s quite normal for disciples to betray the sect.”

“But you are probably the strongest one to date.”

“It’s simply unbelievable.”

At this point, Chen Xinan found it somewhat incomprehensible: “Disciples who are granted great divine abilities are usually implanted with restrictions to prevent them from betraying the sect in the future.”

“I don’t have restrictions because my father is the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, but why don’t you?”

Lu Yang did not answer.

Chen Xinan was not wrong. In his previous life, he obtained the inheritance of a great divine ability by selling himself to the Three Rivers Association, but that was all in his previous life.

What does that have to do with me in this life?

However, he certainly couldn’t let others know about his unique secret, so Lu Yang proactively changed the subject: “Fellow Daoist, do you know much about this world?”

Chen Xinan was stunned upon hearing this: “The world?”

Lu Yang nodded: “To be honest, this is my first time traveling, and for a moment I don’t know where to go, so I came to ask fellow Daoist.”

“…Don’t go south.”

Chen Xinan was silent for a moment before honestly stating: “North of the Great Dragon River is our Saint Sect’s territory, and all major and minor sects are subordinate to our Saint Sect. South of the river, the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion holds the leadership of the righteous Dao. Beyond that, the Northern Wilderness and Southern Barbarian lands are remote and desolate, with no truly powerful forces.”

“If I had to mention, only Jiangdong, Jiangxi, and the overseas lands are worth noting.”

“Oh?” Lu Yang looked curious, “Why do you say that?”

“Because their Daos are different,” Chen Xinan explained. “Whether it’s the Saint Sect or the Sword Pavilion, in Jiangnan or Jiangbei, what they cultivate is actually the ‘Body Refinement Ascension Dao’.”

“However, Jiangdong, Jiangxi, and the overseas lands are different.”

“Jiangdong cultivates the ‘Dao of Patrolling on Behalf of Heaven,’ Jiangxi cultivates the ‘Dao of Profound Joyful Nirvana,’ and overseas is even more diverse, a hundred flowers blooming. Although none can compare to our orthodox path, they all possess ingenious ideas.”

As a true disciple and a blood relative of the Heaven-Mending Peak Master, Chen Xinan’s knowledge was far superior to Lu Yang’s. As he eloquently spoke, he immediately revealed a corner of the world to Lu Yang, especially his descriptions of Jiangdong, Jiangxi, and even overseas, which made one yearn to visit.

However, he quickly reined in his thoughts and returned to calmness.

“…I know where I should go.”

The most pressing matter was still finding secret methods to increase the chance of Foundation Establishment. The 'Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to Behold the Heavenly Silkworm within Me' was a pleasant surprise, but it couldn’t disrupt his plans.

Jiangdong, Jiangxi, and overseas could wait.

He planned to go to Skeleton Mountain again.

“The Witch Ghost Secret Realm… the place where the ancient Witch Ghost Dao left its inheritance. For such a major sect, their so-called inheritance surely wouldn’t stop at the Qi Condensation realm, would it?”

In his previous life, he hadn’t even entered the secret realm before it was destroyed.

In this life, he wanted to enter it ahead of time to see if there were any opportunities related to Foundation Establishment.

Moreover, the Witch Ghost Secret Realm was extremely secluded and suitable for hiding. If anything about Yusu were to be exposed, hiding in the secret realm would provide greater safety.
