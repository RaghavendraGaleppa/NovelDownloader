# Chapter 82: Rejection

Almost instantly, Ye Yuqi pinpointed the source of the fragrance—a female disciple with delicate features and an exceptional figure. 

Most importantly, she was a servant disciple, which meant that as long as Ye Yuqi extended an invitation, she would undoubtedly accept becoming his attendant without hesitation.

"Junior Sister!" Ye Yuqi took a deep breath and approached the servant disciple emitting the peculiar fragrance, his smile warm and inviting.

"Greetings, Senior Brother!" 

Chu Feifei, who was waiting in line to submit her mission, turned upon hearing the greeting. After a quick glance, she respectfully bowed. 

As an inner sect senior brother, Ye Yuqi was someone Chu Feifei couldn't afford to offend. With just one look, she recognized him as the much-talked-about inner sect disciple who had been making waves recently.

"Junior Sister, I'm looking to recruit an attendant. Would you be interested in serving me?" Ye Yuqi extended the invitation with confidence.

His words instantly silenced the entire Mission Hall. Countless female disciples nearby stared at Chu Feifei with envy and jealousy. 

Among them, a young servant disciple who had secretly followed Ye Yuqi along with a few others was both surprised and delighted to see Chu Feifei receive such an offer from an inner sect senior brother.

"This junior is merely a servant disciple with limited capabilities. I fear I wouldn't meet your expectations, Senior Brother." After a brief pause, Chu Feifei politely declined the invitation.

She hadn't expected an inner sect senior brother to approach her. Logically speaking, there were other female disciples in the Array Peak who were more beautiful than her. The only thing Chu Feifei could confidently boast about was her figure. But if he truly sought beauty, the Qinglu Sect surely had no shortage of disciples more outstanding than her.

For cultivators, altering one's appearance wasn't difficult. Though puzzled, Chu Feifei still refused—she had no intention of becoming an inner sect disciple's attendant. 

She was on the verge of reaching the third level of Qi Refinement and had a high chance of becoming an Array Master. Moreover, once she fully awakened her special physique, she might even have the opportunity to become an inner sect disciple herself. 

Why would she give up everything she had now to become someone else's attendant?

"Hmm?" 

Chu Feifei's rejection took Ye Yuqi by surprise. This was the first time a servant disciple had ever refused his invitation. In an instant, fury surged within him. 

Fortunately, he quickly suppressed his anger. This servant disciple was crucial to his plans—she held the key to his opportunity and his path to cultivation.

Ye Yuqi's core strength lay in his mastery of the Nose Divine Ability. However, the technique he had obtained was incomplete, and cultivating divine abilities was inherently difficult. His progress had been painstakingly slow, and despite his efforts, nothing had yielded significant results.

But now, the peculiar fragrance emanating from this servant disciple had caused his stagnant Nose Divine Ability to show the slightest hint of progress. The closer he got to her, the clearer the scent became.

If he could fully harness the fragrance from this female disciple, his Nose Divine Ability would undoubtedly break through its current bottleneck and advance to the next level.

"Junior Sister, if you agree to become my attendant, I can grant you the same privileges as an outer sect disciple," Ye Yuqi sweetened the offer.

"My apologies." 

After submitting her mission, Chu Feifei excused herself and quickly left. She had no intention of continuing this conversation—it would only lead to complications.

Watching her retreating figure, Ye Yuqi's gaze turned icy. A mere servant disciple had dared to reject him twice. He wondered who had given her the audacity. If persuasion wouldn't work, then he wouldn't hesitate to resort to other means.

**Array Peak Administration Hall**

"Senior Sister Lan, I wish to recruit a servant disciple from the Array Peak as my attendant. Might you assist me with this?" Ye Yuqi handed a bottle of perfume to the woman before him.

As the Array Peak's administrator, she oversaw all matters concerning the peak.

"Junior Brother Ye, have you finally remembered your senior sister?" Lan Shuying smiled as she accepted the perfume, playfully squeezing his hand. She had always been fond of this handsome junior brother—he was exactly her type.

"I've always kept Senior Sister in my thoughts," Ye Yuqi replied, holding her hand with a humble smile.

"Enough with your sweet talk. Save it for those young girls," Lan Shuying rolled her eyes. "From the sound of it, you couldn't charm one, so you're asking for my help?"

"Indeed." 

Suppressing his disgust, Ye Yuqi caressed Lan Shuying's hand, gazing at her affectionately. "Senior Sister, you'll help me, won't you?"

Though Lan Shuying was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, her lifespan was nearing its end. Without a breakthrough, she would soon perish from old age. As a result, an aura of decay clung to her—something ordinary cultivators couldn't detect, but Ye Yuqi, with his Nose Divine Ability, could.

"Recruiting attendants is a matter of mutual consent. If the other party refuses, even I can't force them," Lan Shuying sighed.

"If Senior Sister helps me this once, I will repay you generously," Ye Yuqi pressed.

"Fine, I'll help you." Lan Shuying finally relented. A mere servant disciple could be easily dealt with using a few tricks. 

Compared to the favor of a potential future Core Disciple like Ye Yuqi, this was a small price to pay. Her hopes for extending her lifespan might very well rest on this junior brother.

**Chu Feifei's Quarters**

"Senior Sister Chu, you're making a mistake!" 

The young servant disciple who had followed Ye Yuqi earlier was practically wailing in despair. How could Chu Feifei reject an invitation from an inner sect senior brother—one who was even a candidate for Core Disciple? At this moment, she wished she could trade places with Chu Feifei and accept the offer herself.

Could it be that Chu Feifei had refused because of that outer sect senior brother? But how could an outer sect disciple compare to an inner sect one? Unless... that outer sect senior brother was particularly skilled in bed?

Seeing the girl's wild imagination running rampant again, Chu Feifei deftly threw her out.

Regaining her composure, Chu Feifei resumed studying the Art of Concealment. Though the inner sect senior brother's invitation had been baffling, as long as she refused, even an inner sect disciple couldn't force someone to become an attendant.

Yet, when she recalled the cold glint in Ye Yuqi's eyes as she left, an uneasy feeling settled in her heart.

An inner sect disciple had countless ways to make life difficult for a mere servant disciple.

Her unsettled mind made it impossible to focus on the Art of Concealment. After some thought, she decided to gather information about that inner sect senior brother—to see what kind of person he was.

If he turned out to be narrow-minded and vindictive, she would need to prepare countermeasures. However, she soon realized that as a servant disciple, investigating an inner sect disciple was nearly impossible.

After a moment of contemplation, Chu Feifei took out a communication talisman. She would ask Gu Mo for help. As an outer sect disciple, he likely had better access to information than she did.
