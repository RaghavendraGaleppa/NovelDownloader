# Chapter 40: The Opening  

Han Yue was utterly astonished. He never expected this seemingly ordinary white fox pelt to attract the attention of a fourth-order existence!  

He immediately followed up with a question:  

"I wonder why these immortal great demons suddenly care so much about their bloodline descendants?"  

Yang Fan spoke quite bluntly:  

"The matter behind this has already spread far and wide. It's just that you, Master Han, are too isolated from the news to know!"  

"You must understand that in our [Jade Sky Realm], a generation spans a thousand years. Only when a Longevity True Person emerges does the generation change!"  

"Sometimes, if no Longevity True Person appears in the entire realm for a long time, a single generation can last several millennia."  

"Other times, multiple great cultivators may emerge within a single generation, giving rise to several Longevity True Persons!"  

"The previous generation ended a hundred years ago, giving way to the generation we are in now!"  

"In that previous generation, our [Jade Sky Realm] was blessed with fortune, witnessing the rise of two Longevity True Persons—one from the righteous path and one from the demonic path!"  

"These were the Shishi True Person Shi Xuan from Penglai Sect and the Juexian True Person Li Zihan from the Demon-Seeking Palace!"  

"The two clashed for centuries, each ascending to the fourth-order a hundred years ago before eventually retreating into the background, becoming the pillars of their generation!"  

"And this fox pelt is connected to the Juexian True Person Li Zihan!"  

"Legend has it that when True Person Li ascended to the fourth-order, he gained a great innate divine ability—one that allowed him to curse and kill his enemies through bloodline connections."  

"Using this divine ability, True Person Li secretly hunted down two great demon sages: the [Mystic Black Tortoise] and the [Azure Flood Dragon]."  

"After years of investigation by the demon race, this matter was only recently exposed, sending shockwaves through the demon world!"  

"All great demons have since begun strictly controlling the spread of their direct bloodlines!"  

"As for this white fox pelt, the [Heavenly Fox] would never allow it to circulate freely within the inner regions!"  

Now understanding the full story, Han Yue quickly said:  

"Thank you, Master Yang, for enlightening me. Otherwise, I might have stumbled into danger without even realizing it!"  

"You may handle the fox pelt as you see fit. I have no objections!"  

For Han Yue, he had no desire to get entangled in such matters!  

The Sword Pavilion master was clearly someone of extraordinary background, and Han Yue strongly suspected he was a disciple of the Green Lotus Sword Sect.  

If the other party could use the fox pelt for their own purposes, that was their skill!  

Han Yue was still practically blind when it came to the cultivation world. Holding onto the fox pelt would only bring him trouble!  

Yang Fan continued:  

"Then I must thank you, Master Han. This fox pelt is crucial for my promotion to a true disciple. It is extremely important to me, and I am willing to exchange it for a thousand mid-grade spirit stones!"  

For a second-tier treasure, a thousand mid-grade spirit stones was an astronomical price!  

Clearly, Yang Fan didn’t want to owe Han Yue too much of a favor and preferred to compensate him generously with spirit stones.  

Little did he know that after handing over the fox pelt, Han Yue’s [Silver Hairpin] would be nearly empty except for spirit stones!  

Han Yue wouldn’t pass up the chance to take advantage of a disciple from a major sect. He said:  

"You’re too kind, Master Yang! Since you’re taking on the karma for me, just take the fox pelt. There’s no need for payment!"  

To Han Yue, these spirit stones were far less valuable than Yang Fan’s favor!  

Yang Fan wasn’t adept at handling such trivial matters. He cut straight to the point:  

"Master Han, you must state your request. I will do my utmost to fulfill it!"  

"I will not take this fox pelt for nothing!"  

"Master Yang is straightforward! Then I’ll be blunt—I wish to join a renowned major sect and seek the true path to immortality. Do you have any connections?"  

Han Yue spoke his mind.  

Yang Fan pondered for a moment before replying:  

"I am indeed from the Green Lotus Sword Sect. Our sect possesses the true teachings that lead to immortality."  

"I can give you a sect token that will guarantee you entry into the second round of our sect’s entrance examination."  

"But whether you ultimately pass the examination and join the sect will depend on your own efforts!"  

"The Green Lotus Sword Sect’s entrance examination is extremely strict. Even the sect leader cannot bypass it to directly admit a disciple."  

"Does this arrangement meet your needs, Master Han?"  

"Of course! Master Yang is most considerate!"  

Han Yue was very satisfied with Yang Fan’s proposal. The Green Lotus Sword Sect was a major sect of spell cultivators, which aligned perfectly with Han Yue’s path. He wouldn’t miss this opportunity!  

The two quickly reached an agreement, and Yang Fan took the fox pelt and left.  

Now, Han Yue held tokens from two major sects, taking a solid step forward on his path to cultivation!  

With only three days left before the Dharma Assembly began, Han Yue, holding his invitation, eagerly awaited its commencement.  

Time passed quickly, and the long-awaited Dharma Assembly finally began.  

The assembly was held on the tenth floor of the trading house, which had been transformed into a circular venue.  

The entire space was divided into individual bamboo compartments.  

As a VIP of the trading house, Han Yue was escorted by Xiaoqing to his designated compartment.  

Inside, the bamboo compartment was fully furnished with tea and refreshments, creating a comfortable environment.  

Han Yue counted roughly two hundred compartments in total, meaning there were at least two hundred second-order cultivators and their affiliated factions in attendance.  

The trading house was truly extravagant—each bamboo compartment was equipped with a privacy array to prevent prying eyes.  

After waiting for a while, a clear, resonant bell chime echoed throughout the venue.  

The sound was refreshing to the spirit, emanating from a mind-nurturing magical artifact.  

This bell marked the official start of the Dharma Assembly.  

Accompanying the chime was a deep, resonant voice:  

"The Dao is not distant—it lies within the heart."  

"All phenomena are empty, yet nature is not empty."  

"If nature is not empty, the breath abides in harmony."  

"When breath returns to the origin, life is boundless!"  

"Today, I, Xu Yuan, dare to discuss with you all the mysteries of tempering and strengthening the body through primordial qi. If there are any oversights, I beg your forgiveness!"  

The cultivators’ assembly was refreshingly direct. The trading house’s master, Xu Yuan, skipped all formalities and immediately launched into his lecture, his words flowing like a river.  

He eloquently shared the secrets and experiences of body tempering, citing classics and speaking with authority. The sheer depth of his knowledge captivated most of the audience.  

In an instant, Xu Yuan had drawn the entire assembly into the rhythm of his discourse.  

At first, Han Yue was slightly taken aback, but soon, like the other attendees, he became immersed in Xu Yuan’s teachings.  

Xu Yuan, a seasoned cultivator, possessed profound insights into body cultivation, and Han Yue benefited greatly from his words.  

For the first time, Han Yue truly appreciated the value of attending such assemblies.  

Even without the prospect of obtaining third-tier treasures, simply hearing a great cultivator share their wisdom was immensely helpful for someone like Han Yue, who lacked a formal lineage.  

But just as Han Yue was engrossed in the lecture, Xu Yuan’s smooth delivery was abruptly interrupted!
