# Chapter 517: You as the Protector

The silent, imposing Hundred Peaks True Person before him harbored ambitions far greater than expected.

If he succeeded, he would become a Zhenjun-level figure of lofty status within the sect.

But... the process was fraught with extreme peril.

To say it was a path of nine deaths was putting it lightly.

Xu Yunfan suppressed the storm in his heart, not letting a trace of it show on his face. Instead, a shrewd smile, characteristic of the Primordial Origin Sect, curled at the corner of his mouth.

"Assisting Senior Brother in attaining the Golden Core... such a monumental task, this junior brother is naturally willing to contribute his meager efforts. However..."

His tone shifted, and his gaze turned sharp as he looked directly at Chu Chengnan. "What are the benefits? Senior Brother should know that when facing the Golden Core Tribulation, even the slightest misstep in external intervention could lead to being crushed to dust. With my meager cultivation, I cannot afford to offer my life for nothing. Moreover, the timing Senior Brother has chosen is truly excellent."

The Zhenjun of the Primordial Origin Sect and the Bodhisattva Pure Land were locked in a fierce battle in the Eastern Wasteland, while the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect watched like a tiger from the side. As long as Chu Chengnan was fully prepared, he could, in an instant, draw upon the favor of the Dao Fruit, have his Cave Heaven crash into the situation, and successfully fuse with it, naturally achieving the body of a Golden Core Zhenjun.

But his stance was clear, and his meaning obvious.

This matter carried immense risk, and the price must be sufficient. Otherwise, even if he were forced to agree on the spot, turning and running at the last minute was, after all, a tradition of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Hearing this, Chu Chengnan was not displeased. On the contrary, a hint of admiration flashed in his eyes.

This was the rule of the Primordial Origin Sect: transactions under force, exchange of equal value.

"Junior Brother Xu speaks plainly, which is very much to my liking."

Chu Chengnan agreed readily, laying out his筹码.

"Naturally, I will not let Junior Brother bear the risk for nothing. First, I, Chu Chengnan, swear here that if Junior Brother Xu lends his full strength to assist me this time, then in the future, regardless of success or failure, as long as Junior Brother also reaches that final step and seeks the Golden Core Dao Fruit, I will pour out all my strength to protect your path. I would even risk my life for it. This is a promise of mutual aid on the Dao Path!"

This first promise carried immense weight! Having a powerful ally who is familiar with the Golden Core Tribulation to protect one's path is of incalculable value.

However, Xu Yunfan only listened. Although Chu Chengnan was famously a man of his word within the Primordial Origin Sect, these days, people who remain true to their word from beginning to end are always few.

Besides, if he succeeded, he would be a Zhenjun, and the oath would naturally be more binding. If he failed and died, then everything would be moot.

It was also possible that Xu Yunfan's direct involvement in Chu Chengnan's quest for the Golden Core would create无形的巨大阻力 the next time he himself attempted it.

Chu Chengnan continued, "Second, regardless of success or failure, I will gift half of the wealth I have accumulated over three lifetimes to Junior Brother. Here is the list."

With a flick of his finger, a wisp of divine sense, containing information on countless divine materials, precious herbs, rare ores, and exotic stones, flew into Xu Yunfan's glabella.

Xu Yunfan scanned it briefly and his heart trembled.

The items on the list were enough to support him in refining his Dao Foundation to perfection and even had enough surplus to attempt a breakthrough to the Golden Core.

This Chu Chengnan was indeed a veteran True Person, his reserves were incredibly厚实.

What moved Xu Yunfan the most was how generous and decisive he was.

"Third," Chu Chengnan's voice carried a hint of pride, "once I succeed and become a Zhenjun, under my Zhenjun Edict, within the Primordial Origin Sect's Scripture Pavilion, aside from the core inheritances, you may freely choose one complete True Art, plus two secret techniques, with no restriction on their grade."

This meant Xu Yunfan had the opportunity to access, and even obtain, some inheritances that were on par with the sect's foundational legacies.

Ordinary inner disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, after joining the Daoist schools opened by the various Foundation Establishment True Persons, would cultivate True Sutras of the lower grade.

To seek a top-grade, or even a supreme True Art, was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

From what Xu Yunfan knew, there were several Foundation Establishment True Persons in the Primordial Origin Sect who had to reincarnate several times and accumulate their fortunes just to exchange for a mid-grade True Art to cultivate. The process was arduous to the extreme.

This condition was generous to the extreme.

Especially the lack of grade restriction on the True Art and secret techniques, which was incredibly tempting.

Although he currently cultivated the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi and the Profound Vault of the Nine Heavens' Divine Thunder Immortal Indestructible True Sutras, two top-tier cultivation True Arts and secret techniques, more True Arts and secret techniques were always better for him.

With the Attribute Panel by his side, it would only make his foundation stronger and stronger.

But Xu Yunfan did not agree immediately.

Though the benefits were great, the risk was a very real matter of life and death.

He was about to speak again to争取 for more guarantees or to refine the conditions, when he saw Chu Chengnan's expression suddenly turn solemn. The aura around his body instantly resonated with the ground煞气 of the entire寒鸦关 cliff.

He raised his right hand, and in his palm was a token. On the token, there faintly shimmered a clear, misty immortal light that Xu Yunfan was both extremely familiar with and deeply in awe of—the seal of True君 Qingyuan.

"Xu Yunfan, receive the Zhenjun's Edict!"

Chu Chengnan's voice became grand and imposing, as if proclaiming a law of the Dao.

"Today, Baiyue's Chu Chengnan, with a steadfast heart for the Dao, seeks to inherit the Dao Fruit of the Unmoving Mountain True Gold Core. His breakthrough is imminent. I hereby order you, Xu Yunfan, to assist him, protect his ritual, guide the earth's veins, and aid him in his accomplishment of the Dao! This is the edict, to be executed immediately!"

*Hum!*

The clear, misty immortal light on the token suddenly flared, transforming into a tangible decree that instantly branded itself onto Xu Yunfan's Dharmic Body.

Xu Yunfan felt his soul tremble violently. All thoughts of bargaining from before vanished in an instant, replaced only by a heavy sense of responsibility and a chilling寒意.

His face turned as dark as water as he looked at the decree branded on his arm.

His words no longer sounded so polite.

"So Senior Brother Chu is first a gentleman and then a scoundrel. This junior brother is full of admiration."

For True君 Qingyuan to personally issue an edict specifically naming him, what did this说明?

It meant that Chu Chengnan's breakthrough was of immense importance to True君 Qingyuan's faction, possibly even involving arrangements on a higher level. It also meant that Xu Yunfan's strength had caught True君 Qingyuan's eye. Sometimes, one is not the master of his own fate.

Success would bring great merit, but failure...

The consequences were unpredictable.

Chu Chengnan's face showed no hint of apology. Instead, he smiled and said, "Junior Brother, this opportunity is a once-in-a-thousand-years chance. If we miss it, it will be hard to find another. I had no other choice."

Truly a scoundrel.

But Chu Chengnan had very well upheld the traditions of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, suppressing all distracting thoughts. He bowed towards the direction of the token, his voice steady and firm.

"Disciple Xu Yunfan, solemnly accepts the Zhenjun's Edict. I will spare no effort to protect Senior Brother Chu's success!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan's reaction, especially the moment he raised his arm and saw the decree successfully branded, the last trace of doubt in Chu Chengnan's eyes finally vanished, replaced by a fervent, triumphant certainty.

"Good! With Junior Brother's full assistance, my confidence has increased by another three-tenths!"

He put away the token and looked around at the violently churning Primordial Clarity and Turbidity, his eyes glowing with divine light.

"The time has come! If not now, when?

The Primordial Origin Sect and the Bodhisattva Pure Land are locked in a fierce battle in the Eastern Wasteland, the heavenly机 is chaotic, and the laws are turbulent. Even with a Pure Yang Zhenjun presiding, the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect must devote the majority of its energy to this world-shaking battle.

This is a moment when the world's spiritual luck collides and the rules are lax. It is also the easiest time for the Dao Fruit's favor to descend.

The Primordial Clarity and Turbidity Qi gushing from this寒鸦关 is the supreme resource for me to引动 the Dao Fruit and construct my Golden Core Dao Embryo.

It is now!"
