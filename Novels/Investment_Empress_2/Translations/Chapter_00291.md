# Chapter 291: One Against Two, Brother or Little Brother?

Xiang Liu actually had a chance to dodge. After all, he possessed a bloodline ability that allowed him to merge his entire body into the black water and muddy waves. However, using this technique would leave him in a weakened state.

Unfortunately, he feared that Fei Yi would take advantage of his weakness to settle old scores.

Unfortunately, he hadn't used all his strength to escape the moment Li Mo pulled out his hammer. By the time he realized the danger, it was already too late.

Xiang Liu’s body had just begun to liquefy when he felt the surrounding air solidify completely, hard as iron. He had no time to react, nor could he use his bloodline power to break through the crushing weight of the hammer strike.

The hammer head expanded rapidly in his vision.

Xiang Liu widened his eyes, the scent of death filling his nostrils. His scales stood on end, only to be churned like waves by the surging force of the hammer.

It felt as if an entire world was crashing down; anything standing in the way would be ruthlessly crushed.

A Cultivating Deity Realm warrior,跨越境界, killing a Rank 6 Disaster Beast in a single blow?

If someone had told him this before, he would have sneered in contempt.

But at this moment...

He believed it.

*Boom—*

The immense force of the *Stabilizing Heaven and Earth* strike crashed down. The power traveled from Xiang Liu’s torso to every inch of his body, exploding him into a shower of black blood.

"Haa..."

Little Li retracted his hammer and exhaled a breath of white mist.

Using World Force to execute the *Heaven Overturning Hammer* with the *Panchi Meteorite Hammer* naturally gave him a greater grasp of the technique, but it left him with no strength left after the single strike.

Fortunately, Xiang Liu had hesitated due to his suspicion of Fei Yi and his underestimation of Li Mo.

It could be said that he hadn't even utilized thirty percent of his strength, dying a truly aggrieved death.

Li Mo still had some energy left to deal with the other opponent.

He just wondered...

Would the other two Rank 6 Disaster Beasts share the same mindset as Xiang Liu and Fei Yi? If they also rushed over, he would have to consider a strategic retreat with the Ice Cube.

Nanguan City wasn't too far away, but this certainly wouldn't be the first wave of Disaster Beasts to find them. Now was not the time for a desperate fight.

A violent wind rose, and black rain poured down.

The doors of the Mountain God Temple rattled loudly.

The sword-leaning girl’s black hair flew in the wind. Seeing the figure in the distance standing firm, she finally let go of her sword handle, her eyes calming down.

There had been martial artists who deliberately showed off in front of her before.

Back then, she didn't even entertain the childish and ridiculous thought; she completely ignored them.

How come now...

She felt that his stubborn back looked a bit childish, yet also... a little cool?

On the shoulders of a certain Ice Cube, two little figures were now changing the topic of their argument.

The white-clothed little figure smiled and said, "He definitely wants to hear some praise later. Why don't we call him 'Big Brother'? No man can resist hearing 'Big Brother, you're so amazing~'"

The black-clothed little figure still had a cold little face, saying calmly, "We are two months older than him. If we call him Big Brother, won't his ego fly to the sky? What if he acts recklessly next time? We should call him 'Little Brother' to make sure he doesn't act willfully next time."

"..."

Ying Bing touched the big-headed doll's head, feeling that neither option was easy to say out loud.

While the two little figures were arguing, Fei Yi outside had already shaken off the stinky black blood.

Huh?

Xiang Liu... is gone?

Looking at the withered grass and trees on this mountain peak, which might not grow any vegetation for decades, this wasn't an illusion.

Even if Li Mo, for some unknown reason, possessed the True Dragon bloodline and gained the recognition of the Heavenly Jade, he was still just a Cultivating Deity Realm warrior.

But he had wiped Xiang Liu out in the blink of an eye.

This was even more fantastical than his own son having two heads!

"Wait for me!"

Fei Yi flapped his four wings, blowing out dry, violent winds, wanting to flee.

"Cough, cough..."

"Huh?"

That小子不仅把鎚子收了, and it seemed he had suffered a heavy internal injury? That makes sense, after all, he had killed Xiang Liu by transcending levels.

If he were to call the other two Disaster Beasts, the Heavenly Jade would have to be split among three demons...

Fei Yi turned back, deciding to test the waters first.

He didn't know he had fallen victim to the ultimate fighting technique!

The strongest way to trap an enemy isn't a trap or a grapple, but the thought: *'I can turn this around.'*

***

*Buzzing—*

Fei Yi snorted.

Instantly, a sandstorm swept over the peak. The air within a radius of ten miles dried up rapidly. The mountain peak, which had just been raining, suddenly felt as if it hadn't seen moisture in decades.

Even a martial artist at the Internal Breath Realm would likely have their moisture sucked dry instantly.

*Whoosh—*

"This is very similar to a sword technique I once saw, because that person was observing the intent of the Fei Yi."

Li Mo’s skin reflected a dark light. The seven Xuan Dan in his Dantian locked down his Qi and blood, like a stone standing in a dry land.

Without using World Force.

How far could he go against a Rank 6 Disaster Beast equivalent to an Internal Manifestation martial artist?

Suddenly, accompanied by a hissing sound, scorching heat rushed at his face, dragging Li Mo into a dry wasteland, turning him into a withered blade of grass.

Fei Yi looked down at the少年 below, its vertical pupils filled with greed and caution. It noticed that the dark light on the少年's body was like a candle in the wind, seemingly on the verge of extinguishing.

He was almost done for!

"Roar!"

It finally stopped hesitating. With a roar, it charged down amidst the sandstorm.

Thus.

The dry, violent wind turned into a curtain. The ferocious, massive snake shadow and the insignificant少年 both cast their fighting silhouettes upon it.

Li Mo’s aura fluctuated between strong and weak. Whenever he seemed on the verge of exhaustion, he would suddenly explode with power.

As they fought, the balance shifted.

Fei Yi was no longer as ferocious as at the beginning. In the prolonged battle, it grew increasingly exhausted. Every time the少年 had a 'revival,' the hammer would strike its body, causing its internal organs to tremble.

Snake blood gradually stained the peak red.

Only the Mountain God Temple remained unharmed.

Thus.

A long time later.

Fei Yi collapsed to the ground, its vertical pupils lifeless.

"You weren't... almost done for?"

*Bang—*

A hammer smashed onto the cracked scales of its head. The force penetrated the ground, causing a large spiderweb of cracks. Fei Yi lost its life with its question unanswered.

"This time, I really am."

Putting away the forty-pound hammer, his whole body aching and numb, Li Mo finally let out a breath of relief.

He sat down heavily on the devastated ground, gasping for breath, his eyelids fighting to stay open.

Just now.

He had killed a Rank 6 Disaster Beast head-on! This achievement was enough to rank him in the top ten of the Hidden Dragon List.

Including the Xiang Liu he killed using World Force to activate the divine weapon, it was even more terrifying. He wondered if the Sect of Heavenly Derivation's sphere of influence included the Southern Frontier...

But Li Mo had no time to think about that; every cell in his body was sending out signals of exhaustion.

He returned to the only intact Mountain God Temple with his hammer.

"Ice Cube, are you ready?"

"I haven't decided yet."

"Huh?"

Li Mo was stunned. He was asking if the Ice Cube was ready to take over so he could rest. He really wanted to take a break.

What did 'haven't decided' mean?

The Ice Cube's eyes seemed complicated and conflicted.

"What haven't you decided?"

"..."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, looking outside as if admiring the 'wonderful' scenery.

A long while later, she spoke.

"Li Mo, do you want to hear..."

"Zzz... Zzz..."

Little Li's snoring at this moment rivaled that of the beautiful Master.

He slept deeply. His handsome face was covered in fatigue. In the twilight, light and shadow danced across his features, vaguely shedding some childishness and adding a touch of toughness.

Ying Bing stared blankly for a moment, the corner of her mouth curling into a gentleness she herself didn't察觉.

She moved the cushion closer, kneeling on it.

Gently, she supported his head and laid it on her long, slender thighs.

Letting him rest well was probably more important than praising him, right?

This time, the black and white little figures didn't come out to argue.
