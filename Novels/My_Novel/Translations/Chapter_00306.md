Chapter 306: The Encounter in Feilong City

The Golden Brick and Jade Towers of Feilong City were the height of extravagance. The rooftops were wrapped in thick snow, and a few lines of cold wild geese skimmed low across the sky. In the marketplace, the flow of people was like a torrent, with carriages and horses passing in an orderly manner. Occasionally, armored soldiers patrolled the streets.

While still staying at the Xianxian Inn, Li Xian had asked the waiter and learned that Feilong City had three grand sights: "Golden Summit in the Sun," "The Worry-Free Tower," and "Dragon's Roar Shaking the Gorge." At this time of year, many martial artists and literary scholars flocked to Feilong City for sightseeing.

The Great Wu Empire had a vast territory with complex river systems and countless towns and cities. Only those that could leave their names on the map were considered first-rate cities. Feilong City had a unique geographical location and a distinctive style, so it was marked on the map.

Li Xian, Jin Yi, and the others entered the city. After walking only half a mile, Li Xian saw a familiar face. The woman in a purple skirt, unseen for over a year, had become even more graceful and stunning, her beauty impossible to hide in the crowd.

This woman was Gu Nianjun. They had met once in the provincial city, where she had looked down on Li Xian. Since that parting, they had not seen each other for a long. Li Xian had gone through countless dangers and hardships, leaving the Yihe Manor, temporarily joining the Flower Cage Gate, and returning to the remnants of the Candle Teaching... He never expected to meet her again in such a remote place.

Li Xian frowned slightly. "Strange, why is she here? If she's here, perhaps Xiaofan is also here? My identity is special, so there's no need to rush a meeting. And if we do meet, I'll probably just get a cold shoulder. I just need to confirm if Xiaofan is here; there's no need to pay attention to her."

Thinking that they had no relationship and were merely strangers meeting by chance, he decided to ignore her.

He then secretly observed and suddenly flashed into a dark alley on the street. Gu Nianjun frowned suddenly and turned her head, but saw nothing unusual. There were only the ordinary market vendors hawking their wares and people bustling about, making her feel strangely uneasy.

Someone beside her asked, "Nianjun, what's wrong?" It was Zhou Shijie, dressed in a luxurious brocade robe, looking exceptionally handsome and elegant. A jade bamboo hairpin was stuck in his hair. He was a versatile scholar and warrior, gentle and refined, asking with concern.

Gu Nianjun said, "It's nothing, I just felt as if someone was watching me."

Zhou Shijie smiled. "What's so strange about that? You are naturally beautiful, Nianjun. How could there not be people secretly admiring you? Let them look. After all, you..." His eyes burned with passion, his heart hot, almost saying, "After all, you are mine." But he restrained himself.

Gu Nianjun glanced sideways at Zhou Shijie, shook her head, and said no more. She turned and walked elsewhere. She had just arrived in Feilong City as well. Seeing many snack stalls along the street—sugar figures, fried dough twists, sweet beans, spicy tofu, glutinous rice cakes—her elegant demeanor and beautiful looks made her stand out among these small vendors.

Gu Nianjun walked up to a small stall, pointed at a sugar figure with her slender finger, and smiled. "I want this." She bought some hot snacks. Zhou Shijie fanned himself with a folding fan and always rushed to pay the bill.

Zhou Shijie said, "I didn't expect you to like these kinds of snacks, Nianjun. Well... these things aren't rare; you can find them in the provincial city too. But I don't seem to have seen you eat them before?"

Gu Nianjun smiled. "There's a lot you don't know." She didn't elaborate.

Zhou Shijie said, "Nianjun, you and Li Xiaofan are not related by blood or marriage. Why are you so concerned about him? I heard he was in Feilong City, so you made a special detour to see him."

Gu Nianjun said, "Brother Shijie, you and I are also not related. So why do you always follow me?" Zhou Shijie's face flushed. "I... I came to see you. I was worried you might get hurt, so I followed."

He "ah"ed, and judging by his own feelings, said, "Could it be that you... you like that kid?"

Gu Nianjun just smiled without speaking, her attitude hard to read. She thought to herself, "Xiaofan has great talent and is capable of great things. I treat him purely as a younger brother, with the affection of an elder sister. As for 'liking'... I, Gu Nianjun, prefer a man who is full of spirit, stands tall between heaven and earth, and is unparalleled in elegance. Unfortunately, such men are rare in this world. Zhou Shijie has wasted years studying poetry and books, but his mind is full of romantic affairs. He is far from being a man of spirit and integrity."

Zhou Shijie sensed a hint of disdain, gritted his teeth internally but suppressed it forcefully. He asked, "Nianjun, now that you've left the provincial city, will you go back?"

Gu Nianjun shook her head. "No, I won't." Zhou Shijie asked, "Why not?" Gu Nianjun replied calmly, "My studies are complete, so naturally, I won't go back."

Walking along the street, she suddenly stopped, pondered for a moment, and explained the reason in detail. After all, they had been classmates for many years, and that friendship still existed. "I went to Qiong Tian Mansion to study, originally for Master Fu."

"Now, Master Fu thinks highly of Xiaofan and has allowed him to go on a study tour early. Since he has left Qiong Tian Mansion, for me to stay in the provincial city would just be wasting time. So I took this opportunity to leave the provincial city."

It turned out...

Fu Haoran was a former high-ranking official who, due to certain court affairs, was demoted to teach at the academy in Qiong Tian Mansion. Qiong Tian Mansion was a barren land, and throughout history, high officials had indeed been demoted there.

Gu Nianjun had read Fu Haoran's theories on poetry and painting and greatly admired this elder. Combined with her desire to delve deeper into the literary path, she heard he was in Qiong Tian Mansion and specifically went there to study and seek knowledge.

Zhou Shijie, benefiting from his father's legacy, inherited a trace of ethereal luck. It seemed connected to the literary and fortune paths, which was why he also went to the provincial city to study. He met Gu Nianjun and became infatuated with her.

But to say he was devoted was far from the truth. At a banquet in a high tower, there was still a figure in a white dress in his heart. Her graceful figure often appeared in his dreams, ethereal and elusive. Hearing her call "Little Lang" in his dream made his whole body tingle, unwilling to wake up. But he would always suddenly wake up, realizing that the "Little Lang" she called was someone else. He felt endless loss.

Zhou Shijie coveted both the literary path and the martial path to immortality. Thus, he was known as "versatile in both literature and martial arts," making a name for himself in the provincial city and earning the admiration of many. In reality, however, he was in an awkward situation: he struggled to make further progress in the "martial path," and his literary knowledge was insufficient to seize fortune.

Moreover, the two paths, literature and martial arts, were mutually exclusive. Martial artists were not favored by fortune, and literary scholars found it difficult to achieve longevity. It was可想而知 how difficult it was to advance both paths simultaneously.

Although he had the title of "versatile in both literature and martial arts" and the reputation of a "talented young master," his reputation exceeded his actual abilities. He was neither a true scholar nor a true warrior. By nature, he was competitive and should have chosen a path long ago to focus on and develop. However, Gu Nianjun also walked the path of "versatile in both literature and martial arts" and had made considerable progress. Her martial arts realm was high, and she had already seized three strands of fortune.

Since he admired Gu Nianjun, he was unwilling to concede defeat; how else could he win over a beauty? So he never changed his path.

Thus, he was stuck in this state. There was a real risk of him becoming mediocre. But his pride was hard to quell, and he was unwilling to show weakness. He couldn't let go of the title of "versatile in both literature and martial arts."

As they chatted, they walked towards the distance. Zhou Shijie wrapped the snacks in oil paper and followed beside Gu Nianjun. Gu Nianjun frowned slightly and looked back from time to time. "Brother Shijie, do you feel someone following us?"

Zhou Shijie said, "No." He added, "Feilong City is a mixed bag of people, and it's quite lively now. It's normal to be watched."

Gu Nianjun also felt this made sense, so she focused on walking. The feeling of being watched didn't appear again. She arrived at an elegant residence in the west of Feilong City.

As soon as she approached, she heard the sound of loud, clear reading coming from inside, full of vitality. Gu Nianjun smiled. "Xiaofan!" The reading stopped abruptly, and a young man's voice said, "Eh?"

Footsteps were heard, and a clean-faced, handsome young man walked out. Seeing Gu Nianjun, he immediately beamed with joy. "Sister Gu!" Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Zhou Shijie and politely called out, "Brother Zhou!"

Zhou Shijie nodded slightly. Gu Nianjun said, "Xiaofan, it's been so long since we last met. You've grown so tall!"

Li Xiaofan had shed his childish air and now possessed a youthful heroic spirit. Gu Nianjun suddenly remembered the Li Xian she had met in the provincial city. Looking closely, the two brothers didn't look very similar, but their eyebrows and eyes were about thirty percent alike. In terms of sharpness... it was his older brother who had the edge.

She was slightly stunned for a moment, thinking, "I only met Li Xian once, so why do I have such a deep impression of him?"

Li Xiaofan said, "Sister Gu, Brother Zhou, please come in. How did you two come here?"

Gu Nianjun smiled. "I missed you, so I came to see you on the way." Li Xiaofan teased, "Really? This place is in Feilong City, far from Qiong Tian Mansion. Did you make a special trip all this way just to see me, Sister Gu?"

Gu Nianjun laughed. "In just a few years, you've become quite cheeky."

Zhou Shijie felt very jealous and couldn't get a word in. Gu Nianjun said, "Xiaofan, where is Teacher Fu?"

Li Xiaofan said, "Master is in the inner courtyard, discussing scholarship with City Lord He!" Gu Nianjun was surprised. "Is that City Lord He Wentian of Feilong City?"

Li Xiaofan nodded. "Yes, it's City Lord He. By the way... this residence also belongs to City Lord He. He greatly admires my master, so he let my master and me stay here temporarily. Master refused several times, but City Lord He is truly hospitable and wouldn't take no for an answer, so we had to move in humbly."

Gu Nianjun glanced towards the inner courtyard. The house was of a fine standard, with an elegant and refined scenery, yet not ostentatious. In the courtyard were planted bamboo and lotuses, things of elegance. Fu Haoran was known to love the 'gentlemanly bamboo,' so it was no wonder he was willing to stay here temporarily. She smiled. "In that case, we won't disturb Teacher Fu for now. There's a stone pavilion over there; let's go there to talk."

The scenery in the stone pavilion was pleasant. After everyone sat down, Gu Nianjun said, "Xiaofan, I know you like the snacks on the street, so I bought some特意. They're still warm, try them."

Li Xiaofan saw that they were all common street foods: sugar figures, glutinous rice cakes, candied hawthorns... He was very grateful. In the past, his family was poor, and he wanted to eat them but couldn't afford to. Later, when he entered the academy to study, with his master's help, he still kept his frugal habits, occasionally sneaking a taste but not daring to eat too much. Gu Nianjun's status was not ordinary; she didn't even look at delicacies from land and sea, yet she特意 bought him street snacks. Her care was evident. Gu Nianjun treated him with genuine sincerity.

Li Xiaofan's eyes turned slightly red. He smiled. "Sister Gu, I'm all grown up now. Are you still treating me like a child?"

Gu Nianjun said, half laughing and half exasperated, "What's wrong with you? Why are you crying all of a sudden? You didn't cry even when you were tired and suffering on your study tour."

Li Xiaofan said, "No, I was thinking of my brother. Besides my brother, you're the one who treats me best, Sister Gu."

Gu Nianjun's expression changed slightly. Li Xiaofan asked, "Sister Gu, I've been on my study tour for almost two years. How is my brother? I've sent letters back, but I haven't heard anything."

Gu Nianjun casually brushed it off. "With your brother's abilities, he must be living quite comfortably." She had actually been secretly paying attention to Li Xian, but after the Golden Scale Banquet... Li Xian had disappeared without a trace, and the situation in Qingning County had changed drastically. She didn't know if Li Xian was alive or dead. If she told the truth, she was afraid it would hurt Li Xiaofan, so she brushed it off casually.

Li Xiaofan had a vague feeling something was wrong, but thinking of his brother's abilities, he felt it made sense.

Gu Nianjun thought, "If that Li Xian has truly vanished without a trace, it would be a good thing for Xiaofan. Xiaofan can fully comprehend the 'Red Heart Sutra,' his heart is pure and flawless, and his future achievements are immeasurable. In these times of impending chaos, such a pure heart is hard to find."

Just as she was lost in thought, a hearty laugh was suddenly heard. Then a voice said, "Master Fu is truly knowledgeable. Your student has learned a lot. If you don't mind, I hope Master Fu will stay in Feilong City for a long time. Your student will do his best to meet all your needs."

Fu Haoran said, "City Lord He is too modest. You treat people with sincerity and govern Feilong City so that the people live and work in peace and contentment. This is something this old man could not achieve."

Gu Nianjun, Li Xiaofan, and Zhou Shijie all looked in the direction of the voice. They saw beside Fu Haoran a handsome middle-aged man. His temples were streaked with white hair, his face was square, and he walked with a steady, powerful gait. His smile was very friendly. It was indeed City Lord He Wentian of Feilong City.

Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie placed their palms together over their chests, bowed slightly, and performed the student's salute. "Master Fu!"

City Lord He asked, "And these two are..."

Fu Haoran laughed. "Haha, City Lord He, let me introduce them. This is Gu Nianjun, a young lady from the Gu family. This is Zhou Shijie, a versatile talent in both literature and martial arts."

City Lord He had an extremely high status but showed no airs at all. He chatted cheerfully with the younger generation and was very polite. The group conversed in the courtyard with an elegant and refined atmosphere. They didn't part until evening. Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie both stayed at the 'Emerald Bamboo Residence.'

Meanwhile, on the other side.

Li Xian had a chance encounter with Gu Nianjun. Relying on his keen senses, he secretly followed her. Although Gu Nianjun had a feeling something was amiss, the distance was too great, and with the crowds and carriages acting as multiple barriers, she couldn't truly detect him.

He watched Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie walk into the residence.

Hearing their conversation, Li Xian learned that Xiaofan was also in Feilong City, in that very residence. He couldn't help but feel very relieved. Knowing that Xiaofan was becoming more and more successful, his heart was filled with joy. He silently memorized the location and then temporarily withdrew, taking Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others to find an inn to stay in.

Feilong City was vast, with golden towers and jade buildings, green pavilions and fragrant pavilions... All kinds of extremely luxurious buildings could be seen everywhere.

Some buildings towered into the clouds, their interiors brightly lit. Beautiful figures were silhouetted against the windows. There were rows of pavilions connected to each other, linked by ropes. Those with a little lightness skill could travel through the air by stepping on the ropes.

It was only then that Li Xian noticed the grand sights of Feilong City. In an instant, he was immersed in the noisy and bustling market streets. Countless details flooded his eyes. Although his vision was relatively narrow, having lived two lives, it was more profound. Yet the grandeur here was something he had never seen in either life!

It was incomparable to Qingning County, the provincial city of Qiong Tian Mansion, Xiucheng, or the Peach Blossom Town of the Water Altar.

Mu Wu, being somewhat timid, stammered, "Brother... Brother Hua, where are we going?" The other four brothers all scratched their heads, at a loss.

Although the Flower Cage Gate was a major sect, its disciples came from poor backgrounds and had narrow horizons. Li Xian said, "Find an inn to stay in, then make other plans."

Li Xian suddenly paused and asked, "Do you have any silver?" The five of them all shook their heads in unison.

Li Xian's silver on him had all been used to buy the "Kan Nie Mai Shou." Along the way, their expenses had been paid by Tang Feng. He had managed to save a few taels of silver in bits and pieces.

He had to accept the reality. "Well, anyway, I'm used to being poor." The famous restaurants in Feilong City were decorated extravagantly, with carved beams and painted rafters. With his meager funds, Li Xian didn't dare to step inside. So he specifically walked through dark alleys.

Along the way, whenever he saw an inn, he would carefully ask about the price. After walking through several alleys, he finally found a suitable place. It was a rather narrow and cramped small attic, but the room was clean.

Li Xian rented two rooms for one tael of silver, for a period of seven days. The price was already extremely high. He said, "I'll book two rooms. I'll live in one by myself, and the five of you will live in the other. If you're not willing, we'll part ways."

The five of them looked at each other and shook their heads in unison. "Brother Hua, we have nowhere else to go besides following you. You can make us live in a pigsty, and we will."

Li Xian said, "Good!" He paid the rent and led everyone upstairs to settle in.

After settling down safely, Huo Er said, "Brother Hua, do we have a goal now? It seems you were following someone?"

Li Xian shook his head. "We are isolated and helpless for now. Let's first forget our identity as members of the Flower Cage Gate and secretly observe the situation in the city. In my opinion, Feilong City is a convergence of风云, and it seems many powerful experts have gathered here. If we reveal our presence too early and get surrounded and captured, that would be terrible."

Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others all felt this was reasonable.

Li Xian didn't know the depth of Gu Nianjun's martial arts. To be safe, he didn't get close to the Emerald Bamboo Residence. Li Xian thought, "Xiaofan is doing better than I am, so there's no need for me to worry about him. I'll find a way to meet him later. First, I'll explore the clues about the Morning Dew. If there's a chance, I'll try to get it. If not, I won't get involved in this mess and will leave early."

He rested and had a simple meal of plain porridge and white soup.

Then he went out to wander the streets, looking for clues everywhere.

Feilong City was a mixed bag of people, with many martial artists gathering. Occasionally, one could see people with imposing auras on the street. Li Xian acted discreetly. First, he found a restaurant to sit in and listened to a storyteller talking about miscellaneous affairs in the martial world.

The storyteller spoke in a rhythmic, flowing manner. He told of grudges and conflicts in the martial world, love and hatred, but most of it was specially fabricated. There were few useful clues. Li Xian was new to the city and had little understanding of the situation, so he used the storyteller's words to learn something about the recent events in the city. Although it was just catching shadows, it was better than nothing.

He ordered a cup of tea for fifteen copper coins and sat there the whole day until the waiter cleared him out in the evening. Li Xian now had a rough outline. He used the rumors to verify them one by one and followed the trail to investigate.

As night fell, lanterns were hung along the roads. They were the size of a palm, with bright candlelight. Many lanterns lit up together, making the streets as bright as day, yet the flow of people had not diminished.

For the next two days, Li Xian went out early and returned late, interacting with various people. Gradually, he confirmed the location of the "Morning Dew."

The Morning Dew was currently in the hands of a "woman with the surname Wang." This woman had a mysterious background and had a residence in Feilong City that was ten years old. It was said she was from the "Longxiong Dao."

The woman claimed: "In these troubled times, heroes emerge one after another. I wish to find a talented individual and make friends. The Morning Dew is mine, but it is of no use to me. Thus, I use it to make friends. If someone can satisfy me in three aspects, I will gift the Morning Dew to them."

The first condition: Age must be under twenty.

The second condition: Must use pure archery skills to hunt the Snow Spirit Fox on the nearby "Covered Snow Mountain." One cannot use "internal energy," "martial arts," or "术道" (the path of术)...

The third condition: Must have a handsome appearance and a tall, straight figure.

The three conditions seemed not difficult, yet they were extremely challenging. The Snow Spirit Fox is a strange beast on the Covered Snow Mountain. Its fur is as white as snow, and it is extremely skilled at hiding in the snow. Its speed is incredibly fast, surpassing the lightness skill of martial artists. It is very rare, and whether one can even encounter it is a matter of great luck.

Hunting it with archery is even more extremely difficult. City Lord He Wentian of Feilong City, who boasts of his archery skills as divine, has used countless methods but still finds it hard to kill a Snow Spirit Fox. To demand that a youth under twenty, not yet wearing a cap, kill the spirit fox is surely asking the impossible.

The martial artists in the market纷纷议论 that this matter is absolutely impossible.

After Li Xian inquired clearly, however, he felt eager to try. "My archery is decent, and the Peach Blossom Bow is in the inn. Although I don't know about the Snow Spirit Fox, I might give it a try. I came all this way for this treasure."

"Moreover, the other two conditions... age under twenty and handsome appearance. Although I'm modest, to be honest, my looks are not bad. Perhaps this time, I can really give it a shot."

He felt something was strange and thought again, "But for such a good thing to fall from the sky, I need to think carefully whether it's good or bad. I must not act recklessly." So he held back and didn't make a move, continuing to find ways to investigate the situation behind the scenes.

He thought... at least he needed to find out the background of the "woman with the surname Wang" before he could try to get the treasure. If this person practiced evil arts and had a strange temperament, he might not be able to get any benefit from her.

Li Xian continued his investigation. He was very good at talking to people and extracting useful information. And with his high martial arts, keen senses, and the ability of "Luofa Shenggen," he could eavesdrop, ask questions, threaten, or deceive... and then piece together the scattered information.

The information became more complete day by day.

This woman with the surname Wang was indeed someone of great importance. It was said that she was kind-hearted, generous, and wealthy. She often held banquets to entertain heroes and chivalrous figures in the martial world. Whenever she had free time, she would go to the Feilong Temple to burn incense and pray for the well-being of the people.

On ordinary days, she would spend money to buy cloth and clothing to help the poor. She truly did all kinds of good deeds and accumulated countless virtues. And she was true to her word. Once, she said that if someone could help carry a piece of wood from the east of the city to the west, she would reward them with four thousand taels of silver.

A martial artist tried to carry the wood. He walked for a full two days, carrying it from the east to the west. The woman with the surname Wang, without a word, gave him the four thousand taels of silver. This matter earned her a great reputation. People said, "Although this woman with the surname Wang is a woman, her words carry more weight than many heroes."

The heroes of Feilong City admired her greatly.

There were countless such stories. All of them said that the woman with the surname Wang was approachable, kind, trustworthy, and good at making friends... etc. After investigating for three days, Li Xian only heard good things.

But he remained suspicious. "Is there really such a reasonable woman in the world? If this woman is deliberately creating a reputation, she must have another motive. But what is that motive? Is it for fame? If it's for fame, that's easy to deal with. Those who seek fame are also bound by fame."

On the same day.

While he was gathering information, he suddenly heard that the woman with the surname Wang would be making an appearance in two days. She would participate in the temple fair at the Feilong Temple, where she would burn incense and pay her respects. Li Xian thought: "Who exactly is this woman? If I see her in person, won't I know clearly? Whether she is good or evil, whether she is acting or faking, whether she has ulterior motives or other plans, I'll know at a glance."

He immediately calmed his mind and held his ground. He returned to the inn and silently worked on his internal energy, purifying the turbid energy within him to improve his martial arts cultivation.

[Five Viscera Avoiding Turbidness Meridian · Five Viscera Chapter]
[Proficiency: 2413/24000 Great Perfection]
[Proficiency +1]

The essence of heaven and earth in Li Xian's body had all been digested. The second realm of martial arts has "Six Advances." Li Xian still had a distance to go before reaching the "First Advance." He roughly calculated that digesting "a hundred strands" of heaven and earth essence could accumulate [1] point of proficiency.

The Bone-Shaping Embryo stage, also known as the Great Primordial Realm, requires immense financial support. This realm has another name, the "Hundred Cauldrons Realm." It means one must undergo a hundred cauldron openings to barely achieve some accomplishment.

Li Xian possessed the "Consume" skill, which gave him a great advantage. But the source of rare treasures was still a major problem. Only those who possess a "treasure cauldron" and can open the cauldron on their own are considered independent martial artists.

He practiced silently.

In the blink of an eye, two days passed, and it was the day of the temple fair. The woman with the surname Wang would go to the temple to burn incense. Li Xian secretly hid himself, following the lively crowd, trying to get a close look at the woman.

(P.S.: Finally finished writing... I've been working overtime a lot recently. My schedule is a bit messed up, but I will keep up with the updates.)
