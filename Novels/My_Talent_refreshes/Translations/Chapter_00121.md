**Chapter 121: One Punch, One Kill**

Upon the arrival of the three, the four individuals already present stood up. Aside from Lu Yunfang, who was at Qi Condensation Sixth Layer, the other three consisted of two at Qi Condensation Seventh Layer and one at Qi Condensation Eighth Layer. However, Chu Ning noticed that Lu Yunfang and her group of four also had wary expressions, as if they didn't recognize the newcomers.

This made Chu Ning slightly puzzled. It was understandable that Lu Yunfang didn't recognize him, as he had already altered his appearance with an illusion spell. But Lu Yunfang didn't even recognize the two beside him. Could it be that these two were not from the Demonic Sect? Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, a red light flashed and disappeared from the Qi Condensation Ninth Layer disciple beside him. Seeing this red light, the wary expressions on Lu Yunfang's and the other three's faces instantly turned to delight. They all bowed and saluted the Qi Condensation Ninth Layer disciple.

"Greetings, Senior Brother!"

Chu Ning's heart stirred. As Lu Yunfang and the others bowed, he also revealed a joyful expression and followed suit. The short-bearded middle-aged man, a Qi Condensation Ninth Layer cultivator, seemed slightly surprised by Chu Ning's action. Having completed his bow, Chu Ning now wore a visibly relieved expression.

"So it was a Senior Brother from the same sect. I thought they were disciples of the Green Stream Sect just now."

The short-bearded middle-aged man smiled at Chu Ning's words. "Don't worry, they will come. This is the only path from the southwest towards the array formation site. As long as we wait here, someone is bound to stumble upon us."

"Let's verify their identities first." At that moment, the tall, thin Qi Condensation Eighth Layer man, who had appeared with the short-bearded middle-aged man, spoke up.

Hearing this, Chu Ning cursed inwardly and quickly considered a way to escape. The short-bearded middle-aged man nodded, his gaze sweeping over Chu Ning and Lu Yunfang's group of four, then slowly said: "Take out your tokens."

As the short-bearded middle-aged man's words fell, Lu Yunfang was the first to pull an item from her storage bag. It was the bamboo token Chu Ning had seen many times. Immediately after, the other three also took out their bamboo tokens. Chu Ning naturally had no bamboo token to show. He pretended to reach for something in his storage bag, while his magic power locked onto the black dagger.

"Someone's coming?" Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly. Among the group, his divine sense was the most agile, and he had already heard approaching footsteps. His divine sense soon detected two people rapidly approaching their location.

At this moment, the short-bearded middle-aged man, who had the highest cultivation among them, also seemed to sense something and quickly said: "Put away your things."

Upon hearing this, Lu Yunfang and the others immediately put away their bamboo tokens. Chu Ning's movement naturally paused as well. The next moment, two figures appeared. Seeing them, Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly. It was a man and a woman, and he actually knew both of them. The male disciple was none other than Tan Zhang, a Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple from the Talisman Pavilion whom he had met on several occasions. The female disciple was the Qi Condensation Seventh Layer disciple named Lin Lan, whom Chu Ning had seen once at the Hundred Treasures Pavilion when he returned to the sect for his reward, and another time when leaving the mountain gate.

Just as Chu Ning saw the two, they also saw Chu Ning's group. Tan Zhang's gaze swept around and quickly landed on the leading short-bearded middle-aged man. "Oh, Senior Brother Xu!" Judging by the tone, the two clearly knew each other from before.

Chu Ning wasn't surprised, however. After all, most of the disciples who cultivated wood-attributed cultivation techniques and were dispatched for this mission were concentrated in the Talisman Pavilion and the Hundred Arts Hall. Of course, there were also disciples from other halls like the Enforcement Hall, External Affairs Hall, and so on, but they were relatively fewer. Within the Hundred Arts Hall, disciples from the Spiritual Plant Garden and Spiritual Beast Room were the most numerous. For those like them, who were at Qi Condensation Eighth or Ninth Layer and frequently stayed within the sect, it was normal for them to know each other.

Indeed, the next moment, the short-bearded middle-aged man smiled faintly and said to Tan Zhang: "So it's Junior Brother Tan and Junior Sister Lin. What a coincidence, several disciples from our pavilion have gathered here."

This short-bearded man surnamed Xu was also from the Talisman Pavilion, which made Chu Ning's heart sink inwardly. He could only blame himself for staying in the pavilion for too short a time, unable to recognize him. This was not good news. Since he was from the Talisman Pavilion, he might have obtained many talismans for this mission. Not to mention high-grade primary talismans, he might even have intermediate-grade talismans, given his Qi Condensation Ninth Layer cultivation. If he were to cause trouble, it would be quite thorny.

"Greetings, Senior Brother Xu." At this moment, the female disciple surnamed Lin, who had come with Tan Zhang, also greeted the short-bearded middle-aged man surnamed Xu.

Tan Zhang's gaze swept over the group and he curiously asked the short-bearded middle-aged man: "Senior Brother Xu, which halls are these fellow disciples from? They all look a bit unfamiliar."

The short-bearded middle-aged man chuckled and shook his head. "We just met, and haven't properly introduced ourselves yet." Then, he introduced himself: "I am Xu Runsheng from the Talisman Pavilion. Fellow disciples, why don't you all introduce yourselves?"

"Tan Zhang from the Talisman Pavilion," Tan Zhang replied first.

The tall, thin Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple followed, "Yu Jiehui from the Enforcement Hall."

"Lin Lan from the Talisman Pavilion."

After the female disciple beside Tan Zhang spoke, the others also introduced themselves one by one. Aside from Lu Yunfang, who was from the Spiritual Plant Garden, the other two Qi Condensation Seventh Layer disciples were from the Spiritual Beast Room. And the male Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple was from the Transmission Hall.

Listening to these introductions, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion. This Demonic Sect was truly formidable. It was said that many hidden disciples had been purged earlier, yet even now, within the various halls of the Green Stream Sect, there were still their hidden operatives. He just didn't know whether these individuals had been planted from the beginning or had been turned later.

As Chu Ning was thinking this, he noticed everyone's gaze turn towards him. "My name is Li Qun, from the External Affairs Hall."

Chu Ning chose a hall that no one else had mentioned. After all, if he claimed to be from the same hall as someone else and they hadn't met, it would definitely arouse suspicion. Indeed, as soon as Chu Ning spoke, Tan Zhang's face showed a look of realization.

"No wonder Junior Brother looked unfamiliar. So you're from the External Affairs Hall; you must have been out on assignment before."

Chu Ning nodded slightly. "Senior Brother Xu, why are so many of you gathered here?"

Chu Ning listened to Tan Zhang's words, discerning no probing intent but genuine curiosity, and instantly understood something. He observed Xu Runsheng's every move. When he saw a flash of killing intent inadvertently flicker in the latter's eyes, his heart instantly chilled. Clearly, Tan Zhang's question made Xu Runsheng conclude that he was not a Demonic Sect disciple, thus prompting a murderous intent.

"Are you waiting for more people?" Tan Zhang was still speaking when, the next moment, a voice suddenly sounded in his ear. "Senior Brother Tan, be careful! They are from the Demonic Sect."

Tan Zhang's heart suddenly jolted upon hearing this, and his gaze towards Xu Runsheng became alert. At the same time, a green light suddenly burst forth from Xu Runsheng's hand, striking towards Tan Zhang. At such close range, without any defense, Tan Zhang would have been unable to dodge. However, with Chu Ning's timely warning, Tan Zhang was prepared. A defensive light shield, also glowing green, lit up around his body, perfectly blocking the green light. Although the shield quickly shattered, Tan Zhang himself remained unharmed. Immediately, Tan Zhang rapidly retreated to put distance between himself and Xu Runsheng, while simultaneously forming another protective shield around his body.

While speaking, he activated another defensive talisman. Judging by the magic power fluctuations of the shield, it appeared to be an intermediate-grade defensive talisman. However, Xu Runsheng, having missed his strike, did not immediately follow up with an attack. Instead, he chuckled: "Quite the quick reaction."

Tan Zhang remained silent, merely staring warily at Xu Runsheng. Lin Lan from the Talisman Pavilion, however, had a face full of confusion. "Senior Brother Xu, why did you attack Senior Brother Tan?"

"Junior Sister Lin, retreat quickly! They are from the Demonic Sect!" Tan Zhang anxiously urged Lin Lan.

Lin Lan's face immediately paled upon hearing this. She swiftly retreated to Tan Zhang's side and similarly activated a defensive talisman. Xu Runsheng still wasn't in a hurry to attack. He simply looked at Tan Zhang with some curiosity.

"Oh, how did you know?"

Tan Zhang naturally wouldn't answer. Seeing this, Xu Runsheng smiled and didn't press the topic further. Instead, he said: "Junior Brother Tan, you've seen the situation. It's seven against two, and our cultivation levels are higher than yours. You have no chance of winning. Never mind talismans, I'm also from the Talisman Pavilion, and I have no fewer talismans than you."

"What do you want?" Tan Zhang glared coldly at Xu Runsheng.

"Join us!" Xu Runsheng stated indifferently. "Within this Spirit Domain, it's not just the few of us. The sect has arranged for many people. Join us in helping the sect, and I can spare you."

Tan Zhang gritted his teeth as he listened. "If you're forcing me to join the Demonic Sect, you'll surely employ some means, right?"

"Indeed, clever!" Xu Runsheng chuckled again. "I just need to plant the Demonic Qi Mark on Junior Brother. Don't worry, Gold Core cultivators can detect this. But the Qi Condensation Completion disciples here, at most, won't be able to detect it."

Tan Zhang's face darkened as he spoke: "The Demonic Qi Mark, once planted, even Gold Core cultivators cannot directly remove it. It leaves one at the mercy of the Demonic Sect Master."

"Junior Brother has good insight." Xu Runsheng nodded. "Gold Core cultivators can indeed discover this, but to remove it, only the Sect Master's secret art can accomplish it."

"Junior Sister Lin, let's go!" As Tan Zhang's voice rang out, the next moment, several talismans activated from his hands. More than ten streams of golden and white light, intermingled, shot towards Xu Runsheng and Chu Ning's direction. At the same time, Tan Zhang and Lin Lan used the Wind Control Art to swiftly flee.

"Attack!" Xu Runsheng also activated a talisman, blocking all the spell-talismans Tan Zhang had unleashed. Then he took the lead in pursuit. The others followed one after another. Naturally, everyone's speed differed due to their varying cultivation levels. Chu Ning watched until everyone had started moving, then followed at the very rear.

With silent steps, he quietly caught up to Lu Yunfang, who was at the back. Lu Yunfang turned her head in surprise, looking at Chu Ning, seemingly bewildered as to why this fellow disciple was so close to her. The next moment, she saw, in shock, a fist hurtling towards her. Because everyone was focused on pursuing Tan Zhang at this moment, and Lu Yunfang was lagging behind, she hadn't even activated her protective magic shield. The fist landed directly on her. Even without the combination of the Thunderclap Steps, the Heavenly Might Fist was not something a Qi Condensation Sixth Layer cultivator like her could withstand.

"Thud!" Before Lu Yunfang could even utter a sound, her body went limp and collapsed to the ground. Chu Ning extended his hand, using his magic power to support her body, preventing it from hitting the ground with too loud a noise. At the same time, his figure flickered, and he was already pursuing the two Qi Condensation Seventh Layer disciples ahead.

Thunderclap Steps! At this moment, Chu Ning's speed was even greater. In the blink of an eye, he was already behind the two Qi Condensation Seventh Layer disciples from the Spiritual Beast Room. His right fist shot out! He unleashed the Heavenly Might Fist once more, striking the back of the left individual. This person, like Lu Yunfang, hadn't used a magic power shield at all. Under Chu Ning's full-force strike, they were also instantly killed.

However, the other Qi Condensation Seventh Layer disciple from the Spiritual Beast Room was close by and reacted at this moment. "You..." Just as this disciple was about to shout, he saw Chu Ning's flame-wreathed fist hurtling towards him. While his heart pounded with fear, he couldn't spare a thought to shout. Magic power rapidly surged, conjuring a defensive shield around his body. However, Chu Ning's speed was too fast. So fast that he could only activate a magic shield, without even enough time to activate a magic tool. But how could a Qi Condensation Seventh Layer disciple's magic shield withstand Chu Ning's attack? The scorching flames of the Blazing Bracelet easily shattered the man's magic shield, and the Heavenly Might Fist landed on him without any hindrance.

"Thud!" Without any surprise, he was killed with one punch. However, because this opponent had used magic power for defense, the commotion from the exchange was naturally a bit louder. Finally, it attracted the attention of the few individuals ahead. The Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple from the Transmission Hall, who was at the very back, turned his head, took a look, and was utterly horrified. However, his reaction wasn't slow. He immediately activated a defensive magic tool.

However, at the same time, Chu Ning's attack was already unleashed. Several high-grade primary talismans, along with two low-grade intermediate talismans, were all activated! Chu Ning's strike was a spell attack comparable to that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. With so many spells bombarding it, even the defensive magic tool of this Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple from the Transmission Hall, which didn't look weak, was utterly unable to resist. The defensive shield was completely breached in just a blink of an eye. The next moment, several spells pierced through the man's body. The Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple from the Transmission Hall fell backward, his eyes wide, filled with unwillingness and confusion. He hadn't even had time to cast any spells. In just a few breaths, four people had successively died at Chu Ning's hands.

At this moment, Yu Jiehui, the tall, thin Qi Condensation Eighth Layer disciple from the Enforcement Hall, had fully recovered his senses. His previously expressionless face was now ashen. As he activated his protective magic shield, a long saber appeared in his hand. As he swung the saber, a faint green light slashed towards Chu Ning, appearing to be quite powerful.

Although the loss of the opportunity for a sneak attack left Chu Ning slightly regretful, he remained calm. At this moment, he was still facing the short-bearded middle-aged Xu Runsheng and the tall, thin Yu Jiehui, just as he had initially. However, he was no longer alone; he had two helpers. Indeed, Xu Runsheng, who was rushing at the front, and Tan Zhang, who was fleeing, had both noticed the commotion behind them. Xu Runsheng turned his head, his perpetually smiling face now clouded with uncertainty. He was about to join the attack on Chu Ning when he suddenly became alert, his body rapidly dodging several spell attacks coming from the front. The ones attacking were Tan Zhang and Lin Lan.

After seeing the situation behind them, they were overjoyed and no longer in a hurry to flee. Instead, they attacked together, sending several talismans towards Xu Runsheng. Earlier, despite knowing that their chances of escaping Xu Runsheng, a Qi Condensation Ninth Layer cultivator, were slim, Tan Zhang and Lin Lan had chosen to flee because there was no possibility of survival in that situation. But now, the sudden reversal of the situation offered them a chance to live.

While the three were about to engage in a direct confrontation, behind them, Chu Ning had already blocked Yu Jiehui's saber spell. He hadn't even activated the Earth Spirit Bracelet, nor had he used intermediate-grade mid-tier talismans. He had merely continuously activated several defensive True Talisman spells within his palm talisman ring. Before entering the Spirit Domain, he had replaced all the talismans in his ring with defensive ones.

Chu Ning knew very well that Xu Runsheng, the Qi Condensation Ninth Layer leader, was the troublesome one. He didn't believe that Tan Zhang and Lin Lan alone could kill the opponent, or even effectively restrain him.

Quick victory! He continuously activated multiple True Talisman spells to block Yu Jiehui's attacks. The next moment, Chu Ning raised his right hand. More than ten fire blades shot out from Chu Ning's hand, flying towards Yu Jiehui. At the same time, a fork-shaped high-grade magic tool appeared in Chu Ning's hand. After infusing it with magic power, it followed the fire blades, striking towards Yu Jiehui. Without the opportunity for a sneak attack, Chu Ning was cautious about getting too close to his opponent. After all, he didn't know if these Demonic Sect disciples had any other secret arts.

Although he didn't use the Thunderclap Steps combined with the Heavenly Might Fist, Chu Ning's successive attacks with two high-grade magic tools still made Yu Jiehui's expression turn serious. A shield appeared in Yu Jiehui's hand, directly blocking in front of him. As magic power was infused, the shield turned dark and thick, actually managing to block Chu Ning's two waves of attacks.

"Oh?" Chu Ning was slightly surprised by this sight. This shield couldn't generate a magic power shield to cover the entire body, but its frontal defensive capability seemed remarkably good. He didn't use the intermediate-grade attacking talismans in his hand again; these were consumables, and he couldn't draw them himself yet.

However, Chu Ning now held a longbow in his hand. The Verdant Wood Sword Art was cast instantly, and with a pull of the Divine Wood Longbow, it transformed into a streak of green light, striking Yu Jiehui's dark shield once more. Under the continuous attacks from three high-grade magic tools, the dark shield finally seemed to be struggling to withstand. Especially with the Verdant Wood Sword Art, as it struck the dark shield, the green light grew increasingly brilliant.

Yu Jiehui's face changed dramatically, and he casually pulled out a pill and put it into his mouth. From a distance, Chu Ning clearly saw that it was the same pill with a dense, bloody aura that he had previously seen on several Demonic Sect disciples.
