# Chapter 154: To Treat Others as They Treat You

Li Xian sharpened his blade, waiting until the midnight hour. When the time was ripe, he summoned all the attendants of the Wushe Hall to the outer courtyard.

The heavy gates were shut tight, sealing the area completely. The attendants were fierce and imposing, gripping swords, blades, and staves in their hands.

Silent and deadly, their murderous intent contained, they all looked at Li Xian. They awaited the order from the Wushe Commander to charge, ready to climb a mountain of blades or plunge into a sea of fire without hesitation.

Li Xian spoke clearly and loudly: "Today's events mean that Cao Yun will surely cause trouble again. It is better to strike first than to be beaten passively. If something is to be done, it must be done thoroughly."

"Commander, we await your orders," Zhang Hou said solemnly. "Please instruct us!"

"Good."

Li Xian said calmly: "You will first disguise yourselves as bandits and wait strictly for my signal. When you see me set off a firework, immediately cause a disturbance in the government office."

"But focus on harassment. Create a commotion, but do not engage in a direct fight."

After arranging the details, Li Xian traveled lightly, leaving the Wushe Hall.

When Lin Guolong was in office, Li Xian often entered and exited the government office, so he knew the internal layout. Now, concealing his face and wearing night clothes, he moved stealthily.

To be safe, he first observed the surroundings of the government office.

The perimeter was heavily guarded. Cao Yun was no fool; having witnessed Li Xian's power, he was certainly on guard.

Li Xian thought to himself: "I have already issued my orders. I just need to kill Cao Yun first, then have my subordinates cause a ruckus. We can claim that bandits caused a disturbance and killed the County Magistrate. That should cover our tracks."

"But Cao Yun is a scion of a noble family. His close guards must be powerful. Although my cultivation has improved recently, I must not be careless. Otherwise, if I alert the snake, the matter will become even harder to resolve."

To be safe, Li Xian climbed onto a nearby tavern. Using the high vantage point, he observed the situation inside the government office.

The defense was indeed tight.

A light was on in the study of the inner courtyard, casting a silhouette against the window.

His Double Pupils activated, his vision piercing through the walls. He confirmed it was indeed Cao Yun.

Two guards stood at the door. Judging by their spirit and energy, they were no weaklings.

Li Xian also knew that the government office contained hidden mechanisms and secret passages, convenient for escaping after an assassination. If he charged in forcefully, he would surely alert the enemy, giving Cao Yun a chance to flee.

"If I use my bow to shoot him, do I have a certainty?" Li Xian gently stroked his long bow, estimating the distance and calculating the probability of success.

With his archery skills, if Cao Yun stepped out of cover, Li Xian could surely kill him with a single arrow. Li Xian pondered: "If I can kill him with an arrow, that would be for the best." He settled his heart and waited in hiding for a moment.

However, after half an incense stick of time, clouds covered the moon. The night watchman in the distance struck his clappers four times in quick succession, signaling the fourth watch of the night.

Li Xian frowned. The night was short, and the opportunity could not be missed. The tavern was far from the government office, and there was a wall in between. Shooting through the wall, Li Xian had no confidence.

And Cao Yun might not leave the study tonight.

He immediately devised another strategy.

Suddenly, he saw a lake outside the government office. Li Xian had heard Lin Guolong say that the waterways in the office were all connected to the outer lake.

He also saw a well just outside the study. If he used the waterway to潜入 (sneak into) that well, he could naturally cross the layers of defense silently.

"I have the Blue Water Pearl, which allows me to stay underwater for a long time. I also possess the Double Pupils, which allow me to see through the water to observe the situation above. Sneaking through the waterway is a safe plan!"

Thinking this was highly feasible, he got off the tavern, circled around the government office, put the Blue Water Pearl in his mouth, and潜入 (dived into) the lake. The lake was dark, with dense water grass and many fish and shrimp.

Li Xian used his vision to feel his way to the water inlet of the government office. There was a wooden grate blocking it, which he easily broke with two slashes of his blade, allowing him to enter easily.

He followed the waterway and soon entered the well. Li Xian supported himself with his arms and slowly climbed up the well wall. During the climb, he used the "Scorching Wave" characteristic to dry his clothes as much as possible.

Just before reaching the well opening, Li Xian deliberately stopped. Using his Double Pupils, he observed the surroundings. He saw that the guards' attention was not on this area.

Stepping on the well wall, he used the force to leap into the air, flipping and moving silently to hide in the grass.

At this time, he was already very close to the study.

Li Xian listened closely and could hear Cao Yun's snoring.

"My Lord, have some tea," a maid said inside the study, bringing over a cup.

Cao Yun woke up with a start and said: "Put the tea there. By the way, are there any disturbances tonight?"

The maid shook her head and said: "It is very quiet."

"Good, patrol strictly," Cao Yun said. "I didn't expect that Li Xian to actually become a force. Underestimating him and failing to throw him in prison means he might seek revenge at night."

"My Lord, the government office is full of our people. If he comes in, he won't be able to get out," the maid laughed.

"Of course. Who do I, Cao Yun, think I am? Can I not handle a mere youth?"

Cao Yun picked up the tea cup, blew away the steam, and drank leisurely. He savored the lingering fragrance of the tea with delight.

Mellow with astringency, astringency turning to bitterness, bitterness with a hint of saltiness, and a sweet aftertaste following the saltiness. The tea had a unique taste, much like life itself.

"Life..." Cao Yun tasted the tea with his mouth, exuding superiority. He held a high position and came from a powerful clan. Wrapped in sugar and honey, his life was extremely happy.

He tasted the tea, but actually tasted the astringency, bitterness, saltiness, and sweetness of others. Sitting high above the common people, this was where his joy lay.

The maid turned and left, leaving Cao Yun alone in the study. At that moment, Li Xian seized the opportunity and smashed through the window, entering the room.

"Who!" Cao Yun was startled, his hair standing on end. The tea cup in his hand overturned, soaking his official robe.

Li Xian said no废话 (nonsense) and immediately shot three stones, which he had picked up from the river bottom. "Tap, tap, tap" three sounds, they hit Cao Yun's ankle, knee, and shoulder.

The immense force penetrated his body, shattering three of Cao Yun's bones instantly. Cao Yun was panicked and lost control of his expression, looking at Li Xian as if he were seeing a ghost.

The government office had layers of obstacles; how could this boy have潜入 (sneaked in) silently? Cao Yun's eyes widened: "You..."

Before he could finish, Li Xian kicked the table and chairs beside him, sending them flying to smash into Cao Yun. With a "bang," they hit him squarely.

Although Cao Yun was an official with considerable power, he relied mostly on his family. His own martial cultivation and skill were truly unremarkable. Being hit by this, he was instantly dizzy and seeing stars, unable to breathe, half his life gone.

His entire skeleton was broken, and he lay limp, pinned under the table and chairs.

Li Xian said: "It is natural for one to die so the other may live." He swung his blade horizontally, ending Cao Yun's life completely.

Cao Yun's life force drained away, his heart filled with sorrow and unwillingness. He died with his eyes wide open.

"You audacious villain!"

The close guards patrolling outside heard the commotion and rushed back immediately. But it was too late. Seeing that Cao Yun was already dead and his corpse gruesome, they were filled with anger and hatred. They raised their blades and charged at Li Xian.

Li Xian sidestepped and struck back with a palm. The Blue Jade Palm print struck the guard's chest, the palm force pushing him flying several zhang. With a "bang," he smashed through the door and flew out of the room.

He turned his head and spat blood, then fainted.

Seeing that his objective was achieved, Li Xian did not need to stay. He immediately rushed out the door. Suddenly, he heard a furious roar: "Villain, where do you think you're going!" A guard jumped down from a high place, slashing down with a blade.

This attack was very powerful. His internal energy was thick and contained, and his blade technique was near perfection.

At the same time, county soldiers surrounded him. A dozen soldiers thrust their spears forward. In that instant, Li Xian faced a dozen attacks.

Even though he was proficient in the "Four Directions Fist" and could calmly deal with four or five opponents, he was now facing a dozen enemies.

Li Xian avoided the dangerous spots and then held his breath, vibrating his body. He pushed the Iron Copper Body to its extreme, a dark luster flashing over his body. He took the spears and slashes head-on.

Then, he grabbed the guard and threw him into the group of soldiers.

With a "clatter," the dozen men were sent into a mess. They were all filled with fear; this man's strength was terrifying.

Li Xian seized the opportunity and jumped into the well. He swam out quickly and reached the outer lake. Inside the government office, there was no leader, and they didn't know where Li Xian had gone. They were in chaos, not knowing what to do.

The rhythm was entirely in Li Xian's hands.

He immediately set off the fireworks, ordering his subordinates to create the illusion of bandits entering the city.

It was quite a lively night.

**Spring Leaf Martial Arts Hall.**

Miao Xichun was awakened by the noise and sent a disciple to investigate. Soon, the disciple returned to report: "Hall Master, that... that Cao Yun is dead! I heard he was killed by roaming bandits!"

"This... this..." Miao Xichun's sleepiness vanished completely. "Good手段 (methods), good methods... This boy is ruthless and decisive, far beyond me!"

"The Qingning County has truly changed!"

Fear appeared in his eyes.

The County Magistrate, a lofty position, killed just like that.

**Bear's Roar Martial Arts Hall.**

Iron Bear, his eyes wrapped in black cloth, also heard the news from his subordinates. His expression was complex as he said: "Our Commander is truly swift and fierce. With layers of guards in the government office, he could still kill. Does that mean... if he wanted to take our lives, it would be just as easy?"

**Man Body Martial Arts Hall, Snake Walk Sect, and Red Copper Sect** heard the news, and all were shocked and sighed.

Previously, they had submitted superficially but harbored different intentions in their hearts.

From this day on, if Li Xian had any orders, from top to bottom, no one would dare disobey.

Qingning County was in great turmoil.

**Inside the government office.**

Cao Yun was dead, and the place was in chaos. Cao Nu Yi heard the news and rushed over hurriedly. Seeing Cao Yun's corpse, he let out a choked cry and hugged the body, weeping bitterly.

This "Cao Nu Yi" was the head of Cao Yun's close guards. Although he shared the surname Cao, he was not of the main family. After joining the Cao family, he married into a lesser daughter of the Cao family and was granted the surname "Cao."

He was loyal to the Cao family for generations.

Tonight, he had anticipated an external attack and had arranged strict defenses. He had even personally stationed himself at the front line of the outer courtyard, determined to stop strong enemies from disturbing Cao Yun.

Who knew...

Cao Yun's body was moved out of the study. The death was gruesome; his shoulder, knee... multiple bones were shattered, and his chest was almost cut in half by a blade.

After the sorrow, Cao Nu Yi couldn't help but think about what to do next. He had failed in his duty as a guard. If the main family pursued responsibility, he would likely lose his life.

"In the current situation, if I want to live, I must quickly capture the killer. Report the incident and redeem myself with merit. Tonight's events seem like a bandit disturbance, but it must be the work of the Wushe Commander."

"They rose up temporarily, so their plan cannot be thorough. If I lead troops to confront him tonight, I can surely expose his flaws. If I miss tonight and let them prepare, I will be at a disadvantage."

He immediately said:

"Early this morning, there was a conflict with the Wushe Hall. Tonight, Lord Cao Yun died. It must be the work of the Wushe Commander!"

Cao Nu Yi shouted to the crowd: "Someone, bring me the County Magistrate's tally. Mobilize the county soldiers, call the County Lieutenant, and follow me to the Wushe Hall to hold them accountable!"

"Bring the Lord's body as well!"

Not long after.

Once again, the Wushe Hall was surrounded by官兵 (official soldiers), with far more troops than during the day. Cao Nu Yi and County Lieutenant Zhang Yiheng were both present.

Li Xian, wearing a nightgown, was calm and composed. Seeing this阵仗 (formation), he was not panicked at all. Instead, he smiled and asked: "Oh? May I ask, Lord Cao Yun, what has happened again for you to visit in the middle of the night?"

He rubbed his eyes and looked around, smiling as he asked: "Where is Lord Cao Yun? Why don't I see him?"

Cao Nu Yi knew the killer was undoubtedly Li Xian. Hearing Li Xian's provocative words and thinking of Cao Yun's gruesome death, which was caused by this man, his anger surged. He roared: "This man murdered a government official. Capture him immediately!"

Li Xian said: "What murder of a government official? Who are you? I haven't seen you before. Why are you slandering me for no reason?"

The soldiers dared not act rashly and only watched from the side. Cao Nu Yi sneered: "Li Xian, it's too late for denial now. At the hour of the rat tonight, you潜入 (sneaked into) the government office and killed Lord Cao Yun. The evidence is conclusive, the facts are clear. Surrender immediately!"

"What?" Li Xian exclaimed loudly: "Lord Cao Yun is dead? Who? Who killed him!?"

Cao Nu Yi was so angry he could barely speak, his teeth itching with hatred. He said: "Stop playing dumb. The culprit is you!"

Li Xian ignored him and declared loudly: "Lord Cao Yun has only just arrived, yet he has unfortunately died. I am deeply grieved. Since the County Magistrate is dead, as the Wushe Commander of Qingning County, I naturally should investigate the truth for him."

"If we find the murderer, we will punish them severely without fail!"

The attendants shouted in unison: "Punish severely without fail! Punish severely without fail!"

Cao Nu Yi's expression changed. He had come to hold them accountable, but how had it turned into Li Xian catching the thief who cried wolf?

"You!" Cao Nu Yi suddenly felt the situation was wrong.

"If I am not mistaken, you are a guard by Lord Cao Yun's side?" Li Xian said loudly: "You are merely a guard with no real authority. How can you command the county soldiers?"

"According to the rules, the government office is heavily guarded. Lord Cao Yun's death is extremely suspicious. Did you cause trouble from within?"

"Ridiculous. I am Lord Cao's close guard, loyal to the core," Cao Nu Yi sneered.

Li Xian declared loudly: "Then why are you unharmed, while Lord Cao Yun died a tragic death!"

Cao Nu Yi was stunned. Li Xian continued: "The government office is heavily guarded. If there was no inside help, who could have killed the County Magistrate silently?"

"You are just a guard, yet you dare use the County Magistrate's tally to surround the Wushe Hall. Acting on your own authority. Could it be that you planned from the start to pin the blame on me?!"

"You!" Cao Nu Yi felt a great sense of panic.

Li Xian said forcefully: "Lord Cao Yun's death is too sudden and has many suspicious points."

"You are highly suspicious. Capture him and throw him in jail!"

Li Xian did not have the authority to command the county soldiers.

However, he was glib of tongue, avoiding the important points and focusing on the trivial. What he said left no room for criticism. Moreover, he was indeed an official, while Cao Nu Yi was merely an attendant.

"Hurry up!" Li Xian shouted.

A few county soldiers, as if possessed, grabbed Cao Nu Yi's shoulders. Cao Nu Yi's face turned as white as a sheet, completely bloodless.

Li Xian snatched the County Magistrate's tally, raised it high above his head, and declared loudly: "The County Magistrate's tally is here. I am acting as its custodian. Who dares to disobey orders will be dealt with by military law!"
