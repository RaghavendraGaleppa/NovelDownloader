**Chapter 141: The Path of World Manifestation**  

Zhang Jing instinctively looked around.  

It seemed to be a room, but everything was pure white, devoid of any features.  

"Zhang Jing, probationary disciple of the Dongtian, welcome to the Radiant Immortal Realm."  

A lively voice suddenly rang in his ears.  

Zhang Jing turned toward the sound and saw a tiny figure, only half a foot tall, composed of some kind of translucent crystal and wearing a green dress.  

From the little braid at the back, he could tell this creature was female.  

"And you are?" Zhang Jing asked curiously, eyeing the crystal sprite before him.  

"Hehe, I'm Long Shanshan, your assigned guide in the Radiant Immortal Realm—but only for half an hour!"  

The crystal sprite, Long Shanshan, hopped cheerfully toward him before climbing up his robes and plopping herself onto his shoulder.  

Her tiny crystal legs swung back and forth, looking utterly at ease.  

"Zhang Jing, you can ask Shanshan anything you want to know!"  

"Anything at all?"  

Zhang Jing's eyes lit up, a smile creeping onto his face.  

The Radiant Immortal Realm was quite considerate, assigning a guide to a newcomer like him.  

"Shanshan can only answer what she knows," the sprite replied honestly.  

Zhang Jing's smile froze.  

"So... there are many things in the Radiant Immortal Realm you don’t know?"  

"Of course! How could Shanshan possibly know everything?" She widened her crystal-clear eyes, speaking as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.  

Zhang Jing took a deep breath.  

"Alright then, where am I right now?"  

"This is your personal room in the Radiant Immortal Realm. Oh! If you want to change the decor, just think about it, and it'll happen."  

Is that so?  

A glimmer of understanding flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.  

With a thought, the pure white surroundings gradually faded, replaced by an empty chamber with only a meditation cushion at its center.  

He had recreated the layout of his cultivation chamber from the mortal world.  

Settling comfortably onto the cushion, he turned to the sparkling sprite perched on his shoulder.  

"Shanshan, can you tell me about the Radiant Immortal Realm?"  

"Of course!"  

Long Shanshan immediately stood up on his shoulder, tapping her tiny chin as she paced back and forth, seemingly pondering where to begin.  

After a moment, she chirped:  

"Zhang Jing, the Radiant Immortal Realm is vast—so vast that even Celestial Immortals can't explore it all. The space here is layered and complex, so I can only tell you about some important places you should know."  

"Like secret realms!"  

"They're a major source of providence for disciples of the Dao Sect."  

"The Radiant Immortal Realm contains many unique secret realms. Exploring them can yield resources and providence. Among them, there's a type called Blood Fiend Realms—extremely dangerous. High-tier Blood Fiend Realms can even claim the lives of Celestial Immortals."  

"But great danger comes with great rewards. Those who emerge victorious from a Blood Fiend Realm might leap several cultivation levels in one go. Some even ascend straight to the Nascent Soul or Celestial Immortal realm!"  

"Blood Fiend Realms... where even Celestial Immortals can perish?"  

Zhang Jing shook his head repeatedly, committing the name to memory.  

*I’m never going near one of those.*  

Recalling Senior Brother Feng Wuyu's warnings about providence, he asked,  

"Besides exploring secret realms, are there other ways to gain providence?"  

"Lots of ways!"  

Long Shanshan clapped her tiny hands excitedly.  

"For example, if you create a legacy, a divine ability, or a Dao Insight and put it up for sale in the Dao Repository, others will have to pay providence to learn it!"  

"Or, if you capture a world from beyond the heavens and fuse it into the Radiant Immortal Realm as a secret realm, you’ll earn continuous providence whenever others explore it!"  

"Is there... an easier way?"  

Zhang Jing sighed.  

The first method sounded promising—he could use the jade talisman to merge Dao Insights and Law Seeds, potentially creating powerful legacies.  

But that wasn’t feasible yet.  

The second method was outright absurd.  

He didn’t even know what "beyond the heavens" meant, and capturing a world? That wasn’t something anyone below the Nascent Soul realm should even consider.  

He doubted even someone as strong as Senior Brother Feng, a Nascent Soul cultivator, could accomplish such a feat.  

"An easier way?"  

Long Shanshan scratched her head thoughtfully.  

"Easier than what you’re already getting?"  

"What do you mean?" Zhang Jing blinked in confusion.  

"Try silently checking your current providence," she suggested awkwardly.  

*Check my providence?*  

A flicker of doubt crossed Zhang Jing’s eyes.  

In an instant, a line of faint text appeared before him:  

**[Zhang Jing (Probationary Disciple of the Chiming Taihao Dongtian): 1,000,000 Providence]**  

"As a probationary disciple, the Dongtian grants you one million providence every year. It’s a gift from the Celestial Immortals. Didn’t your senior brothers or sisters tell you?"  

Long Shanshan’s puzzled voice reached his ears.  

Zhang Jing said nothing, merely asking calmly,  

"How do I get to the Dao Repository?"  

Now that he had providence, he needed to exchange it for the Dao Insights required for the World Manifestation Path in the Foundation Establishment stage.  

He only had three hundred years.  

"We can fly there. It’ll take about thirty years. Or we can ask the Radiant Immortal Realm to teleport us—that’ll cost ten providence."  

Long Shanshan looked at him expectantly.  

"And the return trip?"  

"That’s free."  

"One more question—do you know how much providence it takes to project into the mortal world?"  

Zhang Jing couldn’t help but ask.  

"Haha, that’s a tough one, but Shanshan happens to know! It costs five million providence to project into the mortal world."  

She puffed out her chest proudly.  

"Five million..."  

The staggering number instantly dashed Zhang Jing’s hopes.  

The next moment, his mind connected with the Radiant Immortal Realm through the Chaos Dao Mark on his forehead.  

In a flash, Zhang Jing and Long Shanshan vanished.

### **Dao Repository**  

The sky here was eternally dark, studded with countless bright stars, each exuding a unique aura.  

On the ground stood towering spires, each hundreds of feet high, as if they could pluck the stars from the sky.  

Inside one such spire, Zhang Jing’s figure abruptly materialized.  

Long Shanshan clung tightly to his shoulder, barely avoiding a fall.  

As he appeared, a beam of light coalesced into the form of a translucent, long-bearded elder.  

"Esteemed guest, are you here to exchange legacies or seek information?" the elder asked with a warm smile.  

"Are there any records of that great war?"  

Zhang Jing tested the waters.  

"Your current authority is insufficient," the elder replied, his smile unwavering.  

Just then—  

"Zhang Jing, do you want to know about the war between your human race and the Ten Thousand Spirits of Heaven and Earth?" Long Shanshan whispered in his ear.  

Zhang Jing nodded.  

"Then ask him for the jade slip on the Primordial Yellow World. Probationary disciples have access to that. It has a little bit about the war—oh no, time’s up!"  

Before she could finish, Long Shanshan’s figure vanished from his shoulder.
