# Chapter 242: Through Death to Life, Ascending to Nascent Soul  

Xiao Ji had already reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. All he needed was to trigger the conditions for ascension to step into the ranks of Nascent Soul cultivators—a status that would make him someone every major sect and city would seek to curry favor with.  

Though there was only one realm between Golden Core and Nascent Soul, the difference between the two was like heaven and earth—far greater than the gap between Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment, or even Foundation Establishment and Golden Core.  

A trace of unwillingness stirred in his heart. Despite being able to perceive information within a five-hundred-mile radius, he had still been played like a fool by the Angler.  

He knew the Angler King was monitoring the developments at Sinking Coffin Lake through the Divine Wood Dragon-Fishing Rod.  

This was a lesson—cultivators couldn’t rely solely on unique abilities. True strength lay in cultivation itself.  

The Angler King’s rod swung, and Xiao Ji’s spiritual energy was already depleted.  

The hook came for him.  

This time, he didn’t dodge. Instead, he flew straight toward it, aligning his heart with the oncoming hook.  

“Is the fish committing suicide?” The Angler King was slightly surprised.  

This was indeed an unusual situation.  

Few cultivators willingly embraced death. After all, becoming a cultivator was no easy feat, let alone reaching the Golden Core stage.  

“Catching a dead fish—what terrible luck.” The Angler King’s face showed no joy.  

Though the fun was gone, at least the catch remained.  

The hook of the Divine Wood Dragon-Fishing Rod pierced straight through the Daoist’s heart, lifting him into the air and swinging him twice before flinging him onto the shore.  

Xiao Ji experienced the taste of death for the first time.  

Spiritual energy rapidly leaked from the wound in his heart. His entire body turned cold, and his consciousness began to blur. In that fading vision, memories flashed rapidly—chaotic, disjointed fragments of his life.  

Time seemed to stretch infinitely. In those brief moments, he relived countless past events.  

“So this is what death feels like?”  

“Will I really be revived and ascend to the Nascent Soul stage?”  

“If I actually die, that would be so embarrassing.”  

Worry about his future crept in.  

The memories continued to flash.  

Gradually, he saw the Original God Temple, the familiar stingy devotees, Wang Yaoda, the bastard dragon of the East Sea… the ferocity of Three Seasons Blade against weak demons… Ying Xiao, Zhao Jiuzhou… the time he and Qian Duoyu found the Skywing Cub in the Nine Nethers Valley…  

The memories came without order, flooding his mind.  

He saw a pile of steaming cow dung by a field path and felt an inexplicable hunger… Then, a large hand scooped him up, and he met his master, Liu Haizhu, who at the time was still a vigorous middle-aged man.  

He also saw stranger scenes—a computer screen displaying the time as midnight, playing an old two-person comedy show he had treasured for years, a 10TB hard drive spinning…  

Xiao Ji: “…”  

Huh, even memories from his past life were making an appearance.  

Too bad the glimpse was so brief—he barely caught the beginning before it faded.  

His consciousness grew even hazier.  

His body had lost all sensation.  

Just as his consciousness was about to vanish, the shattered Golden Core within him began to behave strangely.  

The broken fragments of the Golden Core started reconnecting, each piece transforming into something different—one resembling a head, another a torso, limbs…  

It was almost comical, like a child’s game of assembling a figure.  

The shattered Golden Core finally took the form of a tiny infant, sitting cross-legged in his dantian.  

The Nascent Soul had formed.  

A surge of dense spiritual energy erupted, rapidly spreading throughout his body.  

---  

The Angler King stared at the corpse with disappointment.  

Even before he began cultivating, he had disliked dead fish. He found them inauspicious, bringing bad luck.  

For centuries, whether fishing for enemies or for sport, he had always caught live prey. Yet today, in this crucial battle, he had ended up with a dead fish.  

His expression darkened as he glared at the Daoist lying on the ground, a gaping hole in his chest.  

But the thought of the Soul Suppressing Bell fragment on the Daoist’s body eased his frustration somewhat.  

Obtaining a fragment of the Nine Treasures was far more valuable than whether the catch was alive or dead. The first step was always the hardest—once he had one piece, more would surely follow.  

Just as he reached to claim the treasure, something unexpected happened.  

The wound in the Daoist’s chest began healing at an alarming rate.  

The Angler King enveloped the body with his spiritual sense but detected no threat—only a surge of vitality spreading through the corpse.  

A Golden Core cultivator displaying such anomalies? As a Nascent Soul expert, his first instinct wasn’t caution but curiosity. He wanted to see what would happen.  

The dead Daoist’s body regained life—his wound closed, his complexion flushed, blood resumed flowing, warmth returned to his skin… until finally, spiritual energy radiated from him.  

“He’s alive?”  

The Angler King’s face twisted in bewilderment.  

Only when spiritual energy pulsed through the Daoist did he remember he should have sealed him in his fishing basket to prevent any troublesome surprises—like resistance.  

No one liked a fish flopping around on shore.  

Xiao Ji was stuffed into the enchanted fishing basket.  

The Angler King crouched, peering inside like a farmer admiring his catch.  

“What in the world is this?” After centuries of fishing, this was a first.  

But no one could answer him.  

He would die without ever knowing.  

---  

**Boom!**  

The fishing basket exploded as Xiao Ji emerged in his new form.  

His ascension unleashed overwhelming power—enough to shatter the enchanted basket, evaporate the waters of Sinking Coffin Lake, and flatten the surrounding boulders and hills…  

The transformation from Golden Core to Nascent Soul had revitalized his body.  

If one had to explain this ascension theoretically, it could be likened to a phoenix’s rebirth.  

The old had died; the new thrived.  

The Angler King weathered the inexplicable force, dispersing the remnants of the spiritual storm with a wave of his hand. Before him stood the Daoist, reborn.  

Xiao Ji hovered in the air, looking down at the Angler King, who still crouched like a peasant.  

Frowning, the Angler King rose and levitated to meet the Daoist’s gaze.  

“What did you do to yourself?” he demanded.  

“Made a choice—both correct and cruel,” came the cryptic reply.  

“Nascent Soul?” The Angler King’s expression hardened. “You ascended? But you were dead!”  

This defied all logic. It was maddening.  

“Indeed. But now I live again,” Xiao Ji said impassively. “Disappointed?”  

“Then you’ll die a second time. Though I suggest you put on some clothes first—it’s more dignified that way.”  

The Angler King struck. His Divine Wood Dragon-Fishing Rod lashed out, spiritual energy coiling toward Xiao Ji like a whip.  

Revived and now a Nascent Soul cultivator, Xiao Ji was no longer as slow as before.  

He dodged the attack effortlessly, summoning the Glazed Immortal Lantern and the Four-Stringed Lute in one hand while gripping a small bell—another fragment of the Soul Suppressing Bell—in the other.  

“Two complete Nine Treasures?” The Angler King finally grasped the severity of the situation.  

But he quickly steadied himself. Even if the Daoist had reached Nascent Soul and wielded two treasures, he himself was nearing mid-stage Nascent Soul. His strength still far surpassed Xiao Ji’s.  

And while the Daoist had treasures, his Divine Wood Dragon-Fishing Rod was no ordinary artifact either.  

Killing the Daoist became his sole focus.  

The fishing line extended endlessly, capable of slicing mountains in half with a single sweep.  

Xiao Ji manipulated all three treasures simultaneously, warping the surroundings—seasons blurred, weather shifted unpredictably.  

Yet even as a Nascent Soul cultivator, he realized slaying the Angler King wouldn’t be quick.  

**[The Angler King is about to enhance his rod with Netherfire Bait. This will amplify its power before he attempts to ensnare your neck…]**  

**[Perception deepened. Cultivation +231.]**  

With the ability to foresee his opponent’s moves, the advantage was his.  

He evaded every strike effortlessly, countering preemptively.  

When the Angler King tried to empower his rod, Xiao Ji countered with the Glazed Immortal Lantern’s sacred flames, flooding the area with yang energy.  

The Angler King grew weary.  

But as a seasoned fisherman, he wouldn’t give up easily. The Daoist carried not just a fragment of the Soul Suppressing Bell but two complete Nine Treasures. Seizing them would vastly increase his strength and accelerate his cultivation.  

For one man to possess two of the Nine Treasures was outrageous.  

A true angler knew when to yield and when to press—constant tension would only snap the line.  

For over half a month, their battle raged across the skies, carrying them to unknown lands—past fertile fields, desolate wilderness, imperial roads, and rivers…  

They had reached human settlements.  

As Xiao Ji seized the fishing hook with his left hand, enduring the rod’s might, his right hand struck out with the Merciful Deliverance Palm.
