# Chapter 104: Hey, Old Man

By the time Luo Yu arrived at the scene, only the shattered remains of a Buddha statue lay in the temple, its light extinguished and white bones exposed within. There was also an ice sculpture of a smiling Buddha.

It was clear that a fierce battle had taken place here not long ago, but there were no signs of anyone now...

Well, there was actually one person.

Luo Yu realized that what he thought was an ice sculpture was actually a person who had been killed by a sword intent!

"The Temple Keeper?"

"If he was the Temple Keeper, he must have known about the bones inside."

"This person practiced... the evil art of 'Replacing the Deity with the Self'?!"

Luo Yu's expression changed instantly.

The so-called "Replacing the Deity with the Self" involves creating a golden body for oneself to absorb the spiritual energy from incense and offerings. For example, statues that are frequently worshipped and observed can develop spirituality if enough time passes.

One views oneself as a deity, aiming to strengthen one's soul.

However, this martial art is undoubtedly an evil technique.

And it can only be practiced at the very least after reaching the Deity Observation Realm.

"The Temple Keeper was in the Deity Observation Realm, and he was killed?"

"The one who killed him was..."

Luo Yu looked at the sword intent mixed with cold energy...

Ying Bing?!

Ying Bing killed a Deity Observation Realm expert?!

His mind was shaken for a moment; this was simply terrifying. Even he would find it difficult to cleanly and swiftly kill a Deity Observation Realm practitioner who had cultivated the evil art of "Replacing the Deity with the Self." Being able to fight on equal footing with the help of rare treasures would already be considered good.

Once she grew up, she would definitely change the entire situation of the Eastern Wilderness Region.

"This Temple Keeper has a problem; I need to get to the government office quickly."

He had just stepped out.

*Hum—*

Suddenly, it was as if a cold wind howled from the sky, blotting out the sun and covering the heavens, plunging everything into darkness in an instant.

This terrifying scene spread from Nijiao Alley. Everything it passed through began to wither and turn gloomy. Yet, suddenly, a clear spring surged forth, and a sword intent that shocked the heavens carved out a patch of pure land.

These were all Inner Scenery Domains.

"An Inner Scenery battle?!"

Even a fool could tell that something major had happened at the Prefecture City.

He immediately sprinted towards the government office.

However, before he could reach the office, he saw the Prefecture Chief's sedan.

"Luo Yu, are you coming from the Lingjiang Wharf?"

The Prefecture Chief's voice came from inside the sedan.

"Yes, a Temple Keeper died there, killed by Ying Bing..."

Luo Yu didn't suspect anything and quickly summarized everything he had just seen.

The Prefecture Chief inside the sedan seemed to fall silent.

"Luo Yu, go back to the elders of your sect at the government office first. It's dangerous outside."

"But Prefecture Chief, you..."

"As the chief of a prefecture, how can I abandon the common people just because of a little danger?"

"Prefecture Chief!"

Luo Yu was quite moved. He had thought the Prefecture Chief was inactive, but it seemed he had misunderstood him.

The sedan continued on its way.

After turning the next corner and disappearing from Luo Yu's sight, the sound of a teacup shattering came from inside.

"Useless! How could he die so easily?"

"Who will handle the matter now that he's dead?"

Who else could it be?

He would have to go himself.

...

Meanwhile.

At the wharf.

Li Mo looked up at the sky.

Nijiao Alley wasn't far from here. The shockwaves from the collision of the two domains even reached this place, striking his body, only to be dissolved by the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body.

"So this is the terrifying power of an Inner Scenery expert?"

It seemed his beautiful master still had some restraint, deliberately controlling the domain within a range he could withstand, just perfectly.

"This sword intent..."

Ying Bing raised her head to look, her clear eyes filled with thought.

"Why would there be an Inner Scenery battle within the Prefecture City?"

Xiao Qin's expression was grave.

"One side is definitely from the Drizzle Pavilion, an Inner Scenery expert, a Grade Seven Killer!" Zuoqiu Yang said with certainty.

"Wait... that's... Nijiao Alley?"

Li Mo's figure vanished instantly.

It was as if he merged into the wind, rushing towards that direction with all his might. Clouds and mist appeared around Ying Bing, carrying her like a fleeting shadow.

Both of them headed towards Nijiao Alley at the first possible moment.

The Wind Shadow Step was pushed to its extreme.

In Li Mo's eyes, the scenery on both sides of the street rapidly retreated.

The closer he got, the more he could feel how terrifying an Inner Scenery expert was. The clash between the two almost seemed to change the color of the sky. People were lying everywhere on the streets, in disarray, their faces pale and eyes tightly shut. This was likely due to the Drizzle Pavilion's Inner Scenery expert using a strange martial art.

---

Screaming, ghost-like vengeful spirits charged straight at Li Mo.

The sword intent also became sharper.

The Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body was activated. The sharp killing aura of weapons made his entire being feel like a sharp weapon. Although he couldn't reach the perfection of the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body before reaching the Deity Observation Realm, it was still enough.

He advanced unobstructed.

When he reached the location, his pupils couldn't help but contract.

In the small courtyard.

A beautiful woman in her middle years, dressed in a rose-red long dress, held a sword that shimmered with light. It split into ten, then a hundred, then a thousand, causing waves of sword intent to sweep through the domain.

Opposite her was a figure completely shrouded in a black robe, wearing a ghost mask.

The sword intent passed through his body, but no blood dripped; it was quickly mended by black light.

And when he struck out with a palm, a black tide surged, and countless vengeful spirits threw themselves recklessly against the sword light.

The beautiful woman was clearly of a higher realm but was injured. Moreover, she had to protect the group of unconscious children behind her.

One side came prepared and fought without restraint, while the other had to divide her attention to protect others and was injured. The latter was clearly at a disadvantage.

Li Mo gently shook the bell in his sleeve, then exchanged a glance with Ying Bing.

No words were needed.

Just as the black-robed man was about to press his attack further, the combined assault from the two arrived. This time, Ying Bing did not spread her light, because with her current realm, her light was meaningless against a domain. It was better to condense it.

The light turned into chains, and the power of the Great Yin was infused with the Sky Frost Sword.

On Li Mo's side, he had already put away the Chixiao and immediately took out the Star Seed Pestle.

The black-robed man raised an eyebrow and merely waved his sleeve, dissolving all the attacks. However, a layer of frost formed on his clothes, his figure was slightly shaken by the hammer's shockwave, and a trace of enchanting fire stained his sleeve, which he couldn't extinguish no matter what.

He was two major realms above them.

Even a god couldn't help it.

Two... Inner Breath Realm?

One was at the Jade Liquid stage, the other was just... Qi Condensation?

He frowned, glanced at the fire on his sleeve, and decisively cut off the part of his robe.

"Wow, do you have a thing for cutting sleeves?" (Note: A pun on the Chinese phrase for a homosexual relationship, which literally means "cut sleeve.")

Li Mo had clearly learned the essence of a certain fighting king.

The black-robed man: "..."

He remained silent and ignored the two of them, focusing his attack on the woman's rear. His target was Jiang Chulong.

Just then, another black-robed figure wearing a Magistrate mask suddenly appeared on the scene.

Without a word, he charged straight at Li Mo and Ying Bing.

"I want these two alive."

"Your wish is granted!"

After the black-robed Magistrate answered, he still didn't slow his attack. A single stroke of his brush carried the intent to judge life and death.

But soon, he forcefully halted his movement.

In Li Mo's hand was still the hammer. It seemed to be the same one, yet also different.

The Star Seed Pestle!

A Divine Weapon!

The might of the hammer rippled out.

"You... the Hammer King of the Northwest?!"

The Magistrate seemed to have suddenly understood something.

But then, he wore a cold sneer:

"You're in the Inner Breath Realm and can use a Divine Weapon? I'll swallow this hammer of yours right here..."

*BOOM!*

The very earth seemed to tremble.

This hammer was heavy.

So heavy that the domain itself distorted.

So heavy that after Li Mo used it, he couldn't even stay standing.

And the target of this hammer wasn't the Magistrate, but the black-robed man.

Locked on by a Divine Weapon, there was no way to dodge or evade. He could only raise his left hand, summoning countless vengeful spirits to block the path, yet they were instantly obliterated, along with his left arm.

*CRACK!*

An Inner Scenery expert had his arm shattered by brute force.

"Excellent. If you had a few more years, I would have to look up to you."

"Unfortunately, today, you are still an ant!"

The black-robed man's left arm was a bloody mess as he roared.

Hearing the fury of the Floor Master, the Magistrate prepared to attack.

But...

He discovered that although Li Mo was weak, he was smiling at him.

"Oi, old man, what's the matter?"

Someone patted him on the back.

For some reason, he was struck with a sudden, intense fear, breaking out in a cold sweat.

That's right.

Li Mo and Ying Bing were both here.

How could they have forgotten about her?
