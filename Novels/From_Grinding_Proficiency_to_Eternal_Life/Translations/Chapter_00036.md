# Chapter 36: Settling Down

‘You recited the Heart Mantra of the Highest Good like Water once through earnestly. A flash of inspiration suddenly struck your mind. You tried to grasp it, but found nothing. Proficiency in the Seal of Lin has increased.’

‘A vague figure appeared abruptly in your empty yet not entirely empty mind. It seemed ethereal and slow, vanishing in the blink of an eye. You seem to have grasped one or two key points of the Seal of Lin.’

‘……’

After about the time it took to drink two cups of tea, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes. His expression showed traces of exhaustion, but his eyes were filled with contemplation.

When practicing the Seal of Lin today, the system notifications from the Attribute Panel seemed somewhat different. Moreover, a vague, illusory figure had actually appeared in his mind.

It seemed that practicing the Seal of Lin every day, which exhausted him to the bone, was related to this figure.

He had a premonition that if he maintained this state, this technique would soon reach the initial stage.

He stopped thinking about it immediately, turned over, and fell into a deep sleep.

Early the next morning, Xu Yunfan instructed the innkeeper not to enter his room. Combined with his imposing stature and cold tone, the innkeeper naturally realized he was a martial artist from the Jianghu and hurriedly nodded in agreement.

Leaving the inn, Xu Yunfan found the brokerage firm. After explaining his purpose, the broker looked somewhat troubled.

“Great Hero, if your household registration documents are lost, it will be somewhat difficult to purchase property in Beiye City.”

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged as he pulled out a silver ingot from his chest, which he had compressed into a round ball with his finger strength.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you to put in extra effort.”

Those in the brokerage business naturally had connections up and down the social ladder. As long as the price was right, they should have channels.

As expected, the moment the broker saw the silver, the troubled look on his face immediately turned into a beaming smile. He quickly took the silver, weighed it in his hand, and put it into his pocket.

It was at least fifty taels.

The broker was overjoyed. This trip alone would earn him at least twenty taels. Truly, these Jianghu heroes were the real spendthrifts, spending money as if it were dirt. As long as one flattered them properly, making money was easy!

“Of course, of course. Great Hero, just write down your name and age. Leave the rest to me. I’ll handle it urgently. Shall we go look at the house now?”

Most of these Jianghu heroes, weary of the constant fighting, want to live in anonymity. While such cases aren't common, they aren't rare either.

As long as the money is到位 (in place), and one isn't on the wanted list, the government offices are open to all comers.

According to the broker, this is all about increasing revenue!

Seeing Xu Yunfan nod in agreement, the broker called over a servant boy and said, “Great Hero, I need to run the household registration matter personally. This little Zhou is the smartest in our shop. He knows every house in the city. He will take you there.”

“Lead the way.”

Xu Yunfan had no objections.

After following the servant boy around Beiye City for a while, Xu Yunfan sighed. Although Beiye City was a small city in Qingzhou, the northern frontier, it was backed by Jiyun Mountain. Thanks to the mountain goods and wild game, the merchant trade was developed, and the city had a large population. The entire city covered a considerable area.

Unfortunately, there were still many beggars and refugees along the streets.

In such harsh conditions, it would be hard to survive the coming winter.

Finally, Xu Yunfan found a two-entry courtyard in the southern part of the city. The most important thing was that the courtyard had a wide open space, a well on the side, and it was adjacent to a clear river diverted into Beiye City, making daily life very convenient.

“The previous owner called this courtyard the Qinghe Residence. He was also a martial artist, so he paved the courtyard with bluestone bricks for convenience in training. Look, there’s even a weapon rack under the wall. He wants to go to a state city to study and improve himself, so he’s preparing to sell his property to raise funds. This courtyard has only just come onto the market.”

Xu Yunfan looked around the house and found it very satisfactory. The most important thing was that one side of the wall faced the river, allowing him to build a flowing toilet.

As a modern man, he placed great importance on this. The dry latrines of ancient times were simply unbearable for him.

He nodded slightly. “How much is it?”

“Three hundred and fifty taels of silver.”

“I’ll take it.”

After efficiently handling the necessary procedures, Xu Yunfan hurried straight to the city’s renowned blacksmith and weapon shop.

As soon as he stepped in, a wave of heat mixed with the pungent smell of smoke and fire assaulted his senses.

The walls and shelves of the shop were hung with all kinds of weapons.

Deep inside the shop, a blacksmith was working with his shirt off, his muscles bulging. He raised his arm high, and the iron hammer in his hand, accompanied by a whistling sound, slammed heavily onto the glowing red iron block, sending sparks flying. The rhythmic “clanging” sound of forging was crisp and fast.

Seeing a customer enter, the blacksmith put down his hammer, washed his hands in a bucket of clean water beside him, and asked, “Here to buy a weapon?”

A blacksmith at the minor success stage of skin tempering.

“Boss, don’t you have any hammers here?”

“Hammers?”

The blacksmith subconsciously repeated the question, turning his head to look. Only then did he notice Xu Yunfan’s tower-like, robust figure.

Now that he had achieved major success in skin tempering, Xu Yunfan’s arms were thick and powerful, his muscles bulging. His broad and thick waist and back truly lived up to the description of a tiger’s back and a bear’s waist.

A person with such a physique must be a master at wielding heavy weapons.

“I don’t have any ready-made ones, but if you want one, I can forge one for you.”

The blacksmith responded enthusiastically. The selling price of a single heavy weapon was enough to match that of four or five weapons of the same quality.

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan wasn’t too surprised.

Hammers are quite rare in the Jianghu and among the common folk. Firstly, very few people use them. Secondly, forging a heavy hammer requires a great deal of high-quality iron. The materials needed to forge one heavy hammer would be enough to make three or four ordinary swords.

Xu Yunfan immediately picked up a pen and paper, carefully drew the style of the weapon he needed, and wrote down the size requirements in detail, handing it to the blacksmith, surnamed Lu.

Blacksmith Lu took the drawing, pondered for a moment, and silently calculated in his mind.

After a long while, he slowly said, “A heavy steel hammer that is as tall as you are, with a thickness like a baby’s arm. It will weigh at least one hundred and twenty catties.”

“Only a valiant warrior could wield such a weapon.”

A weapon of this weight could be swung with effort, but using it to fight an enemy would be difficult to sustain.

After all, lifting such a heavy weapon is not easy in the first place. To swing it freely without the strength to lift a thousand catties is simply impossible.

“Just make it according to the requirements.”

Xu Yunfan’s expression was calm.

Hearing this, Blacksmith Lu didn’t dawdle, his expression full of confidence.

“In all of Beiye City, I’m the only one who can forge top-grade common weapons. You’ve come to the right place!”

In this border town, having a blacksmith who could forge top-grade common weapons was already quite impressive.

He didn’t hold much hope for forging weapons at the level of Sharp Blades, as that required rare materials and a blacksmith of a higher caliber.

The main point was that a weapon of the Sharp Blade grade would cost at least a thousand taels of silver.

Xu Yunfan paid the deposit cheerfully and agreed with Blacksmith Lu on a delivery date before turning and striding out of the shop, quickly returning to the inn.

He still had money to guard and couldn’t stay away for too long.

Two days later, under the broker’s introduction, Xu Yunfan successfully went to the government office to sign and seal, registering his identity. He obtained his status and received the property deed and household registration.
