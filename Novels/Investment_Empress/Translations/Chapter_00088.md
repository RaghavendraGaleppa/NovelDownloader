Chapter 88: Li Mo: "Maiden, Shall We Cultivate Together?"

As the hour of Zi arrived, an extreme chill spread once again, this time within Li Mo's room. The area illuminated by the moonlight was covered in a layer of snow-like white.

【Punishment for Defeat: Share a bed for a month.】
【Progress: 1/30.】
【Congratulations, Host, for fulfilling the punishment condition. Rewards will be distributed in stages.】
【Next reward: Three bottles of Imperial Liquid.】

Three bottles of Imperial Liquid would be enough for her to use for a long time, and after using them up, she would still be able to enjoy the benefits. The punishment seemed strict, but compared to the reward, it didn't seem like much. Ying Bing's thoughts were momentarily distracted by this thought. If the object of the punishment wasn't him, would she still feel the same way?

The sound of steady and powerful heartbeat and breathing grew closer, clear and real, and the confusion in her heart seemed to dissipate little by little. She could be certain that she was not in the Tribulation of Attaining Immortality. "He should be unconscious now..." Borrowing the moonlight, Ying Bing examined the young man who was only a few inches away from her. His eyebrows were gentle, his face was like white jade, and because he was drunk, it was tinged with a hint of red.

The next morning, Li Mo woke up, looked at the ceiling in a daze, and his mind was blank. After a while, his memories returned to his mind. He remembered drinking with his master last night. "The allure of wine is indeed not to be trifled with," he thought to himself. "From today on, I will abstain from wine!" Li Mo made a vow to himself.

As he sat up, he saw the familiar furnishings around him, which made him feel a bit off. The familiar fragrance also wafted into his nose... Li Mo's eyes widened in surprise. "Where did Bing Bing sleep?" He listened carefully and heard the sound of sword wind coming from downstairs. Looking out the window, he saw Ying Bing's elegant back, her sword moving in sync with the falling flowers.

【Congratulations, Host, for helping Ying Bing regain her confidence.】
【Investment Feedback: "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh"】

Li Mo smiled in satisfaction. It seemed that the story he told yesterday had been effective. He then checked the introduction to the martial art and his smile froze on his face. 【Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh】: "A dual cultivation technique, infinitely wonderful, can cause two people with equivalent realms to progress together, merge their divine intentions, and even cause anomalies when cultivated to a deep level."

Li Mo's eyes widened in surprise. "Is this a dual cultivation technique? Who am I supposed to cultivate with?" He then looked at the content and realized that he had been too narrow-minded. This technique didn't follow the path of yin-yang replenishment, and even people of the same sex could cultivate it as long as their compatibility was high enough.

When Li Mo went downstairs, he saw Ying Bing finishing her sword practice and looking up at him. "You drank too much last night," she said lightly. Li Mo's throat tightened. He had probably just wanted to get up to relieve himself and forgotten that he had switched rooms. "Uh... did I do anything out of line?" Li Mo asked, his face flushing.

Ying Bing shook her head. "You slept very soundly." Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief. "How have you been progressing with the two sword manuals?" Ying Bing asked, seemingly unaffected by the events of the previous night. Li Mo nodded. "The two sword manuals were originally one, weren't they?" Ying Bing's eyes rippled with a hint of surprise.

The two of them practiced the sword technique together, but they didn't achieve the desired effect. "We didn't manage to merge our divine intentions," Ying Bing said, her eyes drooping in disappointment. Li Mo scratched his head. "Maybe we're not compatible enough." Ying Bing thought for a moment, and Li Mo suddenly had an idea. "I have a dual cultivation technique that might be effective. Do you want to try it?"

Thus, Li Mo proposed the idea of cultivating together with Ying Bing using the "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh" technique.
