# Chapter 150: Counterattack

Originally, the purification of the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect, the poison of the Dark Underworld Sect, and the curses of the Demon Spirit Sect were incompatible attributes. However, the Golden Core cultivators of the seven major sects had guarded the Seven Star Islands for many years and had an extremely deep understanding of each other's abilities.

To minimize losses based on their different characteristics, they devised a combined attack technique. This technique was originally designed to deal with Golden Core sea beasts in the ocean. Once sea beasts reached the Golden Core stage, their destructive power became terrifyingly formidable—no single Golden Core cultivator could face them alone. Moreover, the defensive capabilities of Golden Core sea beasts were astonishing. Spirit beasts inherently surpassed human cultivators in defense, and Golden Core sea beasts were no exception.

The combined attack technique of the seven major sects involved the Heavenly Sea Sect, Rainbow Sect, Water Cloud Sect, and Sacred Ice Sect launching their most powerful elemental attacks. Meanwhile, the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect's purification would first dissolve the target's resistance to poison and curses. Following that, the Dark Underworld Sect's poison and the Demon Spirit Sect's curses would inflict even greater damage. The purification power of the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect would continuously erode the target's resistance, amplifying the effects of the poison and curses.

Yun Xingyi was unlucky enough to be struck by this combined attack technique designed for Golden Core sea beasts. After escaping, his body was continuously tormented by poison and curses. Had he not been utterly desperate, he would never have considered body snatching.

The Returning Sword rested on Li Shiming's chest. As the energy released by the sword flowed into his body, he felt less estranged from it. What he didn't know was that this was a secret technique—transferring the recognition of a lifebound treasure to another body.

Lifebound treasures possessed far greater power than ordinary magical treasures, but they also had a unique characteristic: once separated from their original owner, their power would drastically diminish, often losing half their potency. In cases like Yun Xingyi's body snatching, although the soul remained unchanged, to ensure immediate self-defense capabilities after the transfer, he still needed the lifebound treasure to accept the new body's control, reducing the adaptation period.

At this moment, Yun Xingyi was nearing the end of his strength, but compared to his post-snatching state, his current power far exceeded what he would have afterward. Thus, before the body snatching, he had to prepare everything as perfectly as possible. The fusion of the lifebound Returning Sword with the new body was a critical step. In case he hadn't recovered his strength after the snatching, he could still wield a portion of the Returning Sword's power, ensuring a degree of self-defense.

"This is the Sword Bone—a bone forged over two hundred years. Of course, it must be transferred to the new body!" Yun Xingyi declared as his right thumb transformed into a sharp aura, and a segment of bone emerged from it.

Li Shiming didn't know what the Sword Bone was. He watched as Yun Xingyi placed the bone segment onto his right thumb. A tearing sensation immediately surged through his right hand as the bone segment merged into his thumb, replacing his original bone.

"I'm about to begin. What a pity for this body I've cultivated for three hundred years. Those seven Golden Core cultivators—I'll kill them one by one, and their sects will be wiped out!" At this point, Yun Xingyi couldn't help but mutter regretfully.

Reaching the Golden Core stage involved unimaginable dangers and hardships. Abandoning his original body was a difficult decision, even though he knew he had no other choice.

"Young man, you've remained remarkably calm. I admire that. Truly, even I wouldn't have been as composed in such a situation," Yun Xingyi suddenly laughed.

Li Shiming's heart skipped a beat. Had Yun Xingyi noticed something?

"No matter what tricks you have up your sleeve, you'll be disappointed. I've encountered countless cunning opponents, each with unparalleled schemes, yet they all fell before me. Let me tell you this—never underestimate any cultivator who has lived for over three hundred years!" With a laugh, Yun Xingyi spat out a golden bead covered in cracks.

As the golden bead landed on Li Shiming, he felt an even more intense pressure, this time slowing even his thoughts.

"With my Golden Core suppressing you, let's see what you can do now!" Yun Xingyi muttered to himself.

From the moment he captured Li Shiming, Yun Xingyi had noticed something unusual about him. Even after learning about the impending body snatching, Li Shiming's reaction had been eerily calm. The only explanation was that Li Shiming had some hidden means to counterattack when Yun Xingyi let his guard down—likely during the body snatching process, when his soul would momentarily lose control over Li Shiming.

Of course, Yun Xingyi had other methods to restrain Li Shiming, such as formations. But upon inspecting Li Shiming, he discovered the latter's Starlight Sea formation. Using formations to bind an advanced formation master was extremely risky. Yun Xingyi regretted that the pre-existing Starlight Sea formation would likely be lost after the body snatching. To ensure absolute control, he opted for the method he trusted most—his Golden Core.

The aura of a Golden Core could suppress even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, let alone a mere Qi Refining cultivator like Li Shiming.

Yun Xingyi removed all his clothes and then stripped Li Shiming as well. He took out a brush made of unknown materials, dipped it in his own blood, and began drawing intricate patterns on his body. He then repeated the process on Li Shiming. Li Shiming suppressed the urge to act, telling himself to wait a little longer.

"Embracing the spirit and holding fast to the One, can they be kept from parting? Concentrating the breath and attaining softness, can it be like an infant's? Purifying the profound mirror, can it be without blemish?..." Yun Xingyi sat cross-legged before Li Shiming, chanting Daoist scriptures. Even as a Golden Core cultivator, facing the high-risk body snatching, he needed to steady his mind to ensure perfection.

Meanwhile, Li Shiming silently recited the *Vajra Body Protection Divine Art*, recalling the sensation of his enlightenment and form manifestation. He knew he had only one chance—failure meant death. Even though IBMz15's calculated success rate kept increasing with Yun Xingyi's actions, Li Shiming sought every possible advantage. This was a Golden Core cultivator—no amount of caution was excessive.

Trapped in this cave abode, he couldn't even use his most reliable weapon—explosives. Of course, those would only be a last resort, a mutual destruction option if all else failed.

Inside the cave, Yun Xingyi's expression grew increasingly detached. The turmoil in his mind caused by his injuries had completely subsided, leaving him in a state of absolute calm—the optimal condition for the ritual.

Though Li Shiming couldn't move, his state also underwent a transformation. He didn't know what Yun Xingyi would do next, but his instincts and IBMz15's analysis told him the moment he had been waiting for had arrived. For this opportunity, he had endured and prepared for a long time.

In an instant, he executed several actions.

The Returning Sword and Yun Xingyi's Golden Core, both in contact with his body, were stored into the machine room space. Since Yun Xingyi had placed both items on his body, anything in contact could be stored via his consciousness. The machine room space was uniquely special—even a lifebound treasure like the Returning Sword and a Golden Core, severed from their owner's control, offered no resistance when stored.

The moment his Golden Core and Returning Sword vanished, Yun Xingyi felt an excruciating spiritual rupture. His spiritual connections to the Returning Sword and the essence within his Golden Core were forcibly severed. This shouldn't have been possible—normally, the spiritual imprints in a lifebound treasure and Golden Core couldn't be erased instantly. But the machine room space existed in another world, beyond the reach of even the strongest spiritual imprints.

Li Shiming had anticipated this. Previously, when Baili Jinyan's body was stored in the machine room space, the drop of Golden Core blood essence had been completely isolated from its owner, cutting off all sensing. The same principle applied now—the disappearance of the Returning Sword and Golden Core dealt a devastating blow to Yun Xingyi, who was preparing to separate his soul.

A Golden Core cultivator's spiritual energy and essence were concentrated within the Golden Core—it was the source of their power. For a sword cultivator, the lifebound sword was the foundation of their strength. With both the source and foundation gone, Yun Xingyi's already critically injured body could no longer suppress its wounds.

However, even without his Golden Core and Returning Sword, Yun Xingyi managed to deliver a fatal strike to Li Shiming before death. A severely weakened Golden Core cultivator was still far beyond a Qi Refining cultivator's ability to withstand.

Freed from the Golden Core's suppression, Li Shiming's body erupted with light as the phantom of a wrathful Vajra manifested around him. This was the true intent manifestation—his accumulated rage over Zhuge Shishu's death and his own impending body snatching now burst forth in full force.

He opened his mouth, and with IBMz15's coordination, the *Demonic Lotus Sound* technique unleashed a roar—a fusion of Li Shiming's own fury and the wrathful Vajra's true intent, amplified by the Buddhist tones of the technique. Even Yun Xingyi, a Golden Core sword cultivator, was stunned for a split second.

Li Shiming knew his physical body couldn't withstand a single strike from Yun Xingyi—it would mean certain death. Every move he made was calculated by IBMz15 for maximum efficiency and precision.

Yun Xingyi likely never imagined that, ever since his capture, a supercomputer from another world had dedicated all 190 CPUs and 40TB of memory to analyzing him.

Part of Li Shiming's consciousness had already entered the machine room space, where his clone stood ready for battle. The clone emerged from the machine room space, appearing directly before Yun Xingyi. Wielding a third-grade sword foundation, the clone thrust it with full force into Yun Xingyi's chest.

Having prepared for the body snatching, Yun Xingyi wore no defensive robes. The clone's strike pierced Yun Xingyi's skin, embedding the sword foundation about an inch deep before it could go no further. Despite being made of materials suitable for crafting offensive magical treasures, the third-grade sword foundation couldn't match the toughness of a Golden Core cultivator's body.

Even in this absolute disadvantage, with almost no defenses, the clone's premeditated strike—backed by peak Qi Refining strength and the *Sword Demon Secret Code*'s body refinement—only inflicted minimal damage. However, Li Shiming and IBMz15 had anticipated this. Realizing the sword couldn't penetrate further, the clone had no time to retreat.

Instantly, the clone transformed from human to bronze corpse form. Yun Xingyi, now reacting, swung his arm and sent the clone flying. The sound of shattering bones echoed mid-air—a testament to the terrifying power of the strike, despite Yun Xingyi's severe injuries and loss of his Golden Core. The clone's bronze corpse form, several times more durable than its human state, had been grievously wounded by a single casual strike.

Yun Xingyi, meanwhile, was equally shocked. The suddenly appearing cultivator had even better aptitudes than Li Shiming—a metal-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root, a body refined with third-grade metals, and peak Qi Refining cultivation. Had he snatched that body instead, he could have regained Foundation Establishment strength within days.

But Li Shiming gave him no further chances. In his hands appeared a peculiar high-grade magical tool—a four-meter-long hammer, seemingly designed for a two-meter-tall body refinement cultivator. Li Shiming held the hammer's head against his chest, aiming the other end at the wound on Yun Xingyi's chest.

This was the high-grade magical tool electromagnetic cannon he had developed. While the clone attacked, Li Shiming had retrieved it from the machine room space. Six thick cables connected the cannon's rear to the void—specifically, to the *Thunder Shock Formation* inside the machine room space. After days of charging, the formation had accumulated substantial electricity. The cables, inscribed with precision arrays, channeled this immense power into the cannon.

Yun Xingyi, upon seeing the electromagnetic cannon, was momentarily puzzled. Did Li Shiming really think this could breach his defenses?

The electromagnetic cannon fired. The third-grade sword foundation, loaded as ammunition, shot out at an indescribable speed.
