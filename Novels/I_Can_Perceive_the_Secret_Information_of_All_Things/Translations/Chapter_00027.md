# Chapter 27: Black Dragon Market  

Xiao Ji inspected his storage brick, ensuring nothing was damaged before placing it in his bag.  

Walking down the long street, he glanced up at the sky, where he could faintly see powerful cultivators soaring through the air on their swords. Those experts were all ancient monsters at the Nascent Soul stage or above. Xiao Ji wondered when he would be able to move with such effortless grace.  

Though the street wasn’t as bustling as a mundane city, it was still lively enough, with all kinds of shops and trades available.  

Xiao Ji spotted a bookstore selling common cultivation techniques, non-secret methods, and even books on alchemy and artifact forging. He considered sneaking a peek at some techniques to expand his knowledge, but the shopkeeper wouldn’t allow it—likely to prevent cultivators with high comprehension from flipping through and instantly grasping the contents. If they did, they wouldn’t bother buying.  

The cultivation world was full of odd talents, and geniuses with extraordinary comprehension weren’t rare.  

While his "charging-style" cultivation relied on perception, it differed from simply understanding the content—he needed physical contact, like plugging in a charger.  

Thus, his plan to skim techniques for free failed.  

If he wanted them, he had to spend spirit stones.  

With a heavy heart, he spent five spirit stones on an ancient manual: *Six Livestock Nourishing Technique—Rediscover Your Youthful Self*.  

The book was of excellent quality, perfect for middle-aged and elderly cultivators. Xiao Ji bought it for his master, as while it appeared to strengthen the body, it actually benefited the mind.  

He hoped it would help his master hold onto his memories a little longer.  

The reason he dared to spend the money was that he hadn’t paid for his trip here—he had intimidated a scalper into giving him a free ticket for the floating boat.  

As he stepped out of the bookstore, he looked up at the sky—the sun was nearly setting.  

"Master should be having dinner by now. I hope the Third Princess remembers to buy takeout."  

Just then, the scammer cultivator spotted him and hurried over.  

"Daoist Xiao, I’ve handled the matter for you," the scammer said truthfully, knowing lies wouldn’t work with a Daoist.  

The person had been found.  

Or rather, the corpse had been found.  

The second-hand dealer had died on a floating boat bound for the Great Li Kingdom. By the time his body was discovered, the killer had long since fled.  

The boat had already traveled two days, stopping at three points along the way.  

A cultivator had found the body, and though many gathered to look, no one recognized the dealer. Unable to simply discard the corpse, the boat operators brought it back, intending to hand it over to the Ancient City of Tai.  

However, since the death occurred outside the city, the local cultivators refused to take responsibility. The boat operators argued that since the victim had boarded in the Ancient City of Tai, the killer must have struck aboard the boat because they didn’t dare act within the city—implying the city’s security was at fault.  

The city, in turn, countered that the boat had made three stops, and the killer could have boarded at any of them, acting on impulse.  

After two days of bickering, the body remained near the floating boat dock.  

The Wandering Cloud Immortal wasn’t in the city—had he been present, he would have arranged a proper burial.  

But in his absence, the city’s caretakers didn’t dare handle the matter rashly.  

Such situations were ripe for exploitation—if the deceased’s sect or relatives showed up later, they would surely demand hefty compensation. No one wanted to be the fool stuck paying.  

Xiao Ji lost interest in exploring the Ancient City of Tai. His priority now was finding out where the second-hand dealer’s missing goods had gone.  

He could always return later when he had more time and spirit stones.  

This trip was mainly to familiarize himself with the city and its routes.  

He headed to the floating boat dock, where a crowd had gathered around the corpse, lamenting the fragility of life.  

Standing a few yards away, he began analyzing the information from the body.  

**[Ge Qingniu, rogue cultivator from Nanyang County, Great Li Kingdom. Sixth-level Qi Refinement in sword cultivation. Wanted by Nanyang County’s Evil-Suppression Division for smuggling black-market artifacts. Fled to the Ancient City of Tai and recently operated between the city and the Black Dragon Market (a cultivator black market), dealing in cultivation artifacts.]**  

**[Seven days ago, he purchased a large batch of cheap artifacts, intending to sell them at the Black Dragon Market. After spending a few days in the city, he boarded the boat but was killed on the first night—stabbed through the heart with an artifact needle.]**  

According to witnesses, when Ge Qingniu’s body was found, he only had a few scattered spirit stones on him—his storage artifacts were all missing.  

If the witnesses were telling the truth, the killer had taken everything.  

To recover the goods, Xiao Ji first needed to find the murderer.  

But before that, he had to verify whether the witnesses were lying.  

Since the murder had occurred on a floating boat owned by the Heaven-Supporting Sect, the sect’s representative and the witnesses were still present, waiting for the matter to be resolved.  

Xiao Ji moved closer, channeling more spiritual energy to focus on the needle wound in Ge Qingniu’s heart.  

No one noticed him examining the body—he blended in with the onlookers.  

**[Brain-Scrambling Death Needle—a signature assassination weapon of the Cuckoo Gang. The tip is coated in a poison that erodes spiritual energy, colorless and odorless. When a cultivator is struck in the heart, the poison travels with their energy to the brain, ensuring a painless death.]**  

"The Cuckoo Gang… the Black Dragon Market…" Xiao Ji mused. "These are names I’ve never heard before. The cultivation world is vast—I still have much to learn."  

He realized he didn’t know this world as well as he thought.  

Without stepping into the trade, one could never grasp its intricacies.  

Having lived in Longxiang County for so long, he considered himself a city dweller. Though he rarely ventured out, he often listened to storytellers—yet now, he found himself ignorant of many things.  

Leaving the crowd, Xiao Ji began gathering information about the Cuckoo Gang. He had to intercept the stolen goods before they were sold off—once those artifacts were dispersed, finding the four-string pipa fragment’s missing string would become a hundred times harder.  

In the Ancient City of Tai, gathering intel on a gang was easy.  

One could visit the cultivator gathering square, where gossip-loving cultivators congregated.  

There, news from the cultivation world was regularly posted—tales like *The Red Dust Sword Immortal’s Drunken Rampage in a Brothel*, *East Sea Fisherman Enlightened While Casting Nets*, or *Returning Immortal Sect’s Leader Hosts a Feast with Dragon Meat, Invitations Sent to the East Sea Dragon Palace*…  

By the time the city’s lanterns were lit, Xiao Ji had his answer.  

The Cuckoo Gang was a band of roving bandits who specialized in plundering cultivation resources. Its members were all Qi Refinement cultivators with no fixed base, usually appearing near black markets.  

Given Ge Qingniu’s movements, the killer must have investigated him beforehand—it was likely the work of the Cuckoo Gang near the Black Dragon Market.  

Time was of the essence. Xiao Ji booked a ticket for the earliest floating boat passing the Black Dragon Market the next day.  

He was going to visit the Black Dragon Market—a black market for cultivators.  

The Black Dragon Market existed in symbiosis with the Ancient City of Tai, neither too close nor too far. It was a favorite among poorer cultivators, as one could find bargain artifacts and pills there.  

Xiao Ji’s first visit to the Ancient City of Tai wasn’t going as planned. He had intended to secure the pipa fragment quickly, then explore the city properly—visiting places like the auction house and cultivator dueling grounds. But that would have to wait.  

Still, when he considered how rapidly his cultivation was advancing—now pushing toward the ninth level of Qi Refinement—along with the *Six Livestock Nourishing Technique* for his master and his ten-slot storage brick, he felt it was all worth it.
