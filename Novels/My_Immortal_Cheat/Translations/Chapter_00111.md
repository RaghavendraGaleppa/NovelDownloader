# Chapter 111

Many nearby residents stood behind the silver-armored knights. They had all learned of Musu's fall from grace. Hearing the commotion, they rushed over and, upon seeing Musu's parents in Musu's arms, looks of disbelief appeared on their faces.

"Musu has allied himself with an evil god!"
"Let him face judgment!"
...
Voices clamored. Everyone watched Musu with furious expressions, their eyes clearly showing disgust.

A look of sorrow flashed across Musu's eyes. He looked at these people who were once so familiar to him—everyone here used to greet him with a smile. He felt sorrow for them.

"Let me leave! I don't want to hurt you!" Musu warned again. These were people he had seen day in and day out; he truly didn't want to resort to violence.

"Musu, it's not too late to turn back from your misguided path!" an elderly man shouted. He had watched Musu grow up and genuinely didn't want to see him ally with an evil god.

The silver-armored knights took a forceful step forward, their longswords pointed at the one they once revered.

"Zhoutian, was that Lich King also like me now?" Musu's low voice entered Zhoutian's ears. Zhoutian was slightly taken aback, not expecting Musu to remember this tidbit, which he had only mentioned casually.

Leaning against the doorframe, Zhoutian shook his head. "No, it's completely different. He fell into darkness, but you haven't."

"Darkness? Aren't I falling into darkness right now?" Musu's voice held a hint of confusion.

"You think you're falling into darkness?" Zhoutian shook his head again, continuing, "Quite the opposite. I believe you are searching for true light—not the light depicted in those murals, but the true light within your heart."

"The true light within my heart?" Musu murmured to himself.

"Our Lord is the only light!" A silver-armored knight charged forward. He was one of the most devout believers. Although he didn't know who the Lich King was, he could discern the disrespect towards the Holy God Lord in Musu and Zhoutian's conversation and immediately became indignant.

Musu's eyes turned cold. He had warned them repeatedly, but that didn't mean he was indecisive. His body shifted, a leg sweeping out like a flash of lightning. The charging knight didn't even touch Musu's clothes before being sent flying backward. His silver armor shattered across his chest, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. His breath was faint, almost gone.

Musu was right; there were no true masters in this small town. The old knight, severely wounded earlier, was still barely clinging to life on the side, incapable of fighting again. Even if Musu's hands were occupied, his legs alone were more than they could withstand.

"The glory of the Lord must not be defiled!" Someone roared, their eyes filled with a fearless readiness to die. Even knowing Musu's formidable strength, they showed no trace of fear.

A group of silver-armored knights charged forward, their bodies shimmering with light, their long spears glinting coldly, exuding sharp edges. They had also received specialized training, forming a unique battle formation that provided mutual enhancements. Although the residents of this small town were not like those in Seiler City, where almost everyone was a high-level believer, they could still employ some divine arts. Milky white light glowed as various divine spells were cast.

Musu's eyes were cold. It was ironic that he had personally taught these knights their battle formation techniques, and now they were using them against him.

Energy surged, and blood qi soared. Musu was like a wolf among sheep. Unlike when he was fleeing Seiler City, he wasn't holding back in the slightest. Most of this town's silver-armored knights were in Seiler City. The remaining "rotten fish and shrimp" couldn't stir up any waves. In less than a moment, all the silver-armored knights lay on the ground, barely breathing, on the verge of death.

"For the glory of the Lord!" The tragic state of these knights did not deter the other believers. One by one, they charged forward as if fearless of death.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Thuds echoed as figures were sent flying backward. These ordinary residents stood even less of a chance of stopping Musu.

Musu's expression was grim as he looked at the remaining residents. He didn't want to delay any longer here. He was very familiar with the town's emergency protocols and believed that people from the Holy God Sect were already on their way.

No one among the remaining people charged forward now. Perhaps their faith wasn't as fervent, failing to overcome their fear of death. No one rushed him; instead, their bodies unconsciously retreated, clearing a path for Musu. At the end of the path stood a woman, her brows tightly furrowed. She wasn't an exceedingly beautiful woman, but she exuded a gentle and graceful aura.

Musu's steps faltered upon seeing the woman, a complex expression appearing in his eyes.

Suddenly, a melodramatic scene? Zhoutian, with his sword dangling, enthusiastically walked up. Just in case Musu suddenly decided to "slay his kin to attain the Dao," having a sword would make things cleaner. To Zhoutian's disappointment, Musu merely paused for an instant before walking straight past, brushing shoulders with the girl.

"Musu," a soft call came from behind him. Musu didn't stop, as if he hadn't heard it. There was no melodrama, no "slaying kin to attain the Dao," just a serene indifference, calm as water.

Musu and Zhoutian walked out of the town. There was no one left to stop them.

Musu found a small hill nearby, dug a pit, and laid his parents' bodies inside. He stood there for a long time, knowing this was his last glance at them. Finally, he took out a small pouch from his bosom – his money pouch, which Zhoutian had seen before. A look of reluctance appeared on his face before he threw it into the pit, burying it alongside his parents.

It was a simple grave. Musu found a stone slab, and with light shimmering from his fingers, he carved characters onto it, one by one, creating a simple tombstone. There was no need to search for a hidden burial place. Musu had brought the elderly couple's bodies out simply because he wanted to bury them with his own hands. After all, the Holy God Sect maintained an image of grandeur, righteousness, and uprightness; desecrating the dead was something they wouldn't do, as it would be more trouble than it was worth.

Without much further delay, Musu and Zhoutian departed.

On the road, Zhoutian looked at the despondent Musu and asked, "What are your plans now?"

"I don't know." Musu shook his head, looking lost. His parents were both gone; his home was gone.

Seeing Musu in such a downcast state, Zhoutian felt it was his duty to help him through it.

"What do you think is the reason things have developed to this point?"

Musu raised his eyes to look at him, a certain light seemingly returning to them. "Because of you. If you hadn't appeared before our group that day, things wouldn't have come to this."

...

Zhoutian was silent for a moment. "You can't say that. If we follow that logic, if my parents hadn't given birth to me, I wouldn't have appeared before you. Should I blame them? If my grandparents hadn't given birth to my father, I wouldn't exist either. Should I blame them?"
