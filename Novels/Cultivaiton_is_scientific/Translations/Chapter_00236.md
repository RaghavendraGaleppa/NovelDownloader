# Chapter 236: Influence  

Cai Hong bid farewell and left, leaving Li Shiming alone in the pavilion.  

His master, Elder Su, appeared in the pavilion, silently watching Cai Hong's departing figure.  

"Master, I've agreed to become a guest alchemist for the Northern Shu Trading Company," Li Shiming reported with a bow.  

"That's good. With the Northern Shu Trading Company's support, you won't have to worry about cultivation resources," Elder Su said, glancing at Li Shiming before smiling. "It seems Elder Ma has been very generous to you, providing you with so many pills that you've already advanced to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment."  

Though he said this, Elder Su was somewhat puzzled. What kind of pills had Elder Ma given Li Shiming to allow him to progress so quickly to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment? Moreover, there were no traces of residual pill energy in Li Shiming's body. Could he have been consuming only top-grade pills?  

Little did Elder Su know that the most unlikely answer he had in mind was the truth.  

"I was just lucky," Li Shiming replied vaguely, unable to explain further.  

"Indeed, you are blessed with great fortune. However, you must not rely too heavily on luck. Alchemy must not interfere with your cultivation—remember, cultivation is the priority," Elder Su advised earnestly.  

Li Shiming was currently thriving, excelling in both alchemy and cultivation. However, Elder Su worried that the wealth from alchemy might blind Li Shiming, clouding his Dao heart and causing him to neglect his cultivation.  

"Thank you for your guidance, Master. I will remember your teachings," Li Shiming said, bowing his head. Suddenly recalling something, he asked, "What exactly is the Northern Shu Trading Company? What is its background? Could you enlighten me, Master?"  

"I was going to tell you even if you didn't ask," Elder Su replied, gesturing to a stone stool nearby.  

Elder Su sat down and took out a pot of spirit tea from his spatial ring, pouring a cup for himself and Li Shiming.  

Li Shiming sat respectfully across from him, sensing a subtle change in Elder Su's attitude toward him.  

This was understandable. In major sects, high-level alchemists held a status higher than ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, almost on par with Golden Core elders. Moreover, Li Shiming was a high-level alchemist who was almost certain to become an alchemy master—a fact evident from the Northern Shu Trading Company sending a False Core manager to recruit him.  

"The Northern Shu Trading Company was originally established by the six major orthodox and demonic sects, along with several rogue Nascent Soul cultivators. As conflicts between the orthodox and demonic sects intensified, management of the trading company was handed over to the rogue Nascent Souls, preserving a channel for resource exchange between the major sects. Everyone needs such a channel, so it has persisted to this day," Elder Su explained slowly after taking a sip of spirit tea.  

"Does the Northern Shu Trading Company have a share belonging to the Shu Mountain Sect?" Li Shiming asked.  

"Of course. The profits of the Northern Shu Trading Company must be distributed among the six major sects. Otherwise, how could it have survived until now?" Elder Su nodded.  

Li Shiming couldn't help but gasp. With the six major orthodox and demonic sects as backers, along with several rogue Nascent Souls, it was no wonder the Northern Shu Trading Company had grown to such a scale.  

"Does that mean the Northern Shu Trading Company has no competitors?" Li Shiming mused.  

"Each of the six major orthodox and demonic sects supports its own trading companies, and some rogue Nascent Souls also back their own. Even the Northern Shu Trading Company avoids using force against these competitors, relying solely on business tactics. So while it dominates, it can't monopolize the market," Elder Su explained with a smile.  

Though Li Shiming didn't know how powerful Nascent Soul cultivators were, he was certain that offending one would make it impossible for the Northern Shu Trading Company to continue its operations, regardless of its powerful backers.  

---  

Returning to his Sword Peak cave dwelling, Li Shiming finally had time to examine his guest alchemist identity token.  

The token was a magical artifact with multiple functions.  

Li Shiming's spiritual sense easily grasped its features. The token could be refined like any other magical artifact, and upon refinement, its instructions and usage methods would be transmitted directly to his mind.  

One of its functions was connecting to the Northern Shu Trading Company's communication network, which spanned the entire Northern Shu continent. Li Shiming had initially wondered how the company managed this, but now he realized it was only possible with the support of the six major sects.  

Of course, this communication network wasn't accessible to just anyone. Only those with sufficient status within the Northern Shu Trading Company had the privilege. Otherwise, unrestricted access would never have been permitted by the six major sects.  

The network was established to facilitate the company's business and provide a reliable communication channel for the higher-ups of the six major sects during critical moments.  

The token's communication function was remarkably powerful. Cultivators from the six major sects, once verified, could send messages to him anywhere within the network's coverage. He could also use the token to contact any cultivator within the network.  

The first thing Li Shiming did was send a message to Yin Shilan, informing her that she could now use this method to contact him.  

Unfortunately, Yin Shilan was likely in seclusion and didn't respond immediately.  

Such was the nature of relationships between cultivators. Both parties were often engrossed in cultivation, especially at the Foundation Establishment stage, where a single session could last ten days or even a month. Communication naturally became sparse.  

However, considering that cultivators lived far longer than mortals—and that preserving one's primal essence was crucial for forming a Golden Core—their relationship would likely persist far longer than a mortal lifetime.  

Another function of the token was viewing alchemy tasks.  

Li Shiming cast a spell on the token, causing it to project an illusion displaying the available tasks tailored to his high-level alchemist status.  

The tasks were numerous, with bulk orders listed first.  

Li Shiming ignored the smaller tasks, as they offered little benefit.  

Though he now had over three hundred top-grade "Shu Mountain Yellow Spirit Pills"—enough for his mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation—his clone also needed top-grade pills to keep pace with his main body.  

The "Qian Yuan Return Jade Pills" and "Heavenly Treasure Harmony Qi Pills" were second-grade spirit pills for mid and late-stage Foundation Establishment, respectively. The largest available task for each was one thousand batches.  

Li Shiming understood that these cultivation-assisting pills must be made from materials mass-produced by the Northern Shu Trading Company, similar to the Shu Mountain Sect's "Shu Mountain Mixed Essence Pills" and "Shu Mountain Yellow Spirit Pills."  

Without a steady supply of materials, large-scale production would be impossible.  

Without hesitation, Li Shiming accepted the maximum tasks for both pills—one thousand batches each, which would keep him busy for over a month.  

As soon as he accepted the tasks, Cai Hong, who was on his way back to the trading company's headquarters, received the notification.  

Cai Hong paused mid-flight, his lips twitching at the sight of Li Shiming's ambitious acceptance.  

Though he had heard of Li Shiming's alchemy speed, accepting two thousand batches at once was astonishing.  

Alchemists were highly sought after, but few achieved true mastery. Those who did were revered by cultivators.  

Thus, alchemists were often arrogant and unwilling to work hard. Alchemy was mentally taxing, and most Foundation Establishment alchemists would only refine one batch a day to avoid affecting their success rate.  

Even Golden Core alchemists, though mentally stronger, had little incentive to work hard unless they were alchemy masters. The second-grade spirit pills offered as rewards were of little use to them beyond converting to spirit stones.  

Cai Hong hadn't expected Li Shiming to be so diligent, lacking the usual aloofness of a high-level alchemist.  

But he appreciated such enthusiasm, as it would reflect well on his performance evaluations.  

With that thought, Cai Hong accelerated to his maximum speed, eager to deliver the two thousand batches of materials to Li Shiming without delay.  

As for the risk of entrusting such a large quantity of materials to Li Shiming, there was no need for concern.  

Given the Northern Shu Trading Company's power and Li Shiming's status as a Shu Mountain Sect alchemy disciple, his reputation far outweighed the value of the materials.  

Cultivators from the six major sects were highly trustworthy, and any issues could be resolved through their sects.  

That very night, Li Shiming received the materials delivered personally by Cai Hong and began his next round of alchemy.  

For every thousand batches, he would receive two hundred top-grade pills and over thirteen hundred bottles of high-grade pills (ten pills per bottle).  

The staggering profits fueled his motivation, and he maintained a pace of five batches per day.  

His mental strength, comparable to a Golden Core cultivator's, allowed him to handle the workload effortlessly.  

As for the impact on his cultivation, the benefits of top-grade pills rendered it negligible.  

---  

Time flowed like water, and a year passed in the blink of an eye.  

The conflict between the orthodox and demonic factions continued, neither escalating nor diminishing. Skirmishes between Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment cultivators occurred frequently, but large-scale Golden Core battles remained absent, keeping the conflict manageable.  

During this time, the most pressing concern among Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Northern Shu cultivation world wasn't the factional war.  

The longer the war dragged on, the less attention it garnered.  

Instead, cultivators focused on their cultivation, particularly the high-grade pills bearing Li Shiming's mark that the Northern Shu Trading Company had begun selling—"Qian Yuan Return Jade Pills," "Heavenly Treasure Harmony Qi Pills," "Six Ren Revival Pills," and "Purple Jade Bone-Transforming Pills," among others.  

These cultivation aids, healing pills, and body-strengthening pills were all high-grade, with effects roughly 10% stronger than those of other high-level alchemists.  

This seemingly small improvement was significant.  

For cultivation aids, the cumulative effect over time was substantial. For healing pills, the difference could mean life or death.  

Most importantly, the quantity of high-grade pills available was unprecedented.  

Of course, no amount could satisfy the vast number of Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Those with means purchased as many of Li Shiming's high-grade pills as possible, fearing the supply might run out. Those who missed out grew even more eager after hearing others praise the pills' effects.  

Thus, Li Shiming's reputation spread from the sect to the wider cultivation world, becoming widely known among Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

---  

At Sword Peak, Li Shiming's attendants—Ye Lingyun, Wan Qian, and Lu Yingtong—had all reached the peak of Qi Refinement.  

Their rapid progress, fueled by abundant pills, required several years of consolidation before attempting a breakthrough.  

They weren't in a hurry. Their current situation far exceeded their wildest dreams.  

With ample high-grade pills each month, their cultivation conditions surpassed those of most disciples from their former families.  

They also didn't worry about Foundation Establishment Pills. Serving a high-level alchemist ensured they would never lack pills.  

Their only way to repay Li Shiming was to diligently tend to Sword Peak's spirit plants—though they knew the profits were negligible compared to his alchemy earnings.  

Their gazes often drifted toward the mountain's summit, shrouded in formations but serving as their spiritual anchor.  

At the summit, Li Shiming concluded his "Purple Qi Comes From the East" cultivation session and began storing away the Fresnel reflectors.  

His body had reached saturation with the innate purple qi. The supposedly limitless cultivation method had been pushed to its limits by his scientific approach.  

For over ten days, the purple qi had ceased enhancing his Dao body, prompting him to abandon the practice.  

The fifteen hundred Fresnel reflectors were packed into storage bags and placed in his machine room space, likely never to be used again.  

He saw no reason to destroy them. The machine room space was secure, and the numerous storage bags he had acquired from battles served as convenient storage without burdening the space.
