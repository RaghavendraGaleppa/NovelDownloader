# Chapter 166: The Walking Seismograph of the Cultivation World

Shangdang County, Gongsun Family Estate.

Lin Shan and his entourage of over twenty people waited quietly outside. Before long, ripples appeared in the empty space before them, forming a portal from which several dozen individuals emerged.

Leading them was a middle-aged cultivator at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Upon seeing Lin Shan, he stepped forward with a smile, clasping his hands in greeting.

"You must be Envoy Lin of the Black Lotus Sect."

"Indeed. I am Lin Shan. My visit here is rather abrupt, but I'm here on official orders. I hope you'll forgive any impropriety."

Lin Shan returned the courtesy, his subordinates mimicking their leader's manners. The Gongsun family members reciprocated with warm hospitality.

The middle-aged cultivator laughed heartily and gestured invitingly. "No need for formalities. Guests are always welcome—please!"

"After you!"

Amidst the Gongsun family's welcoming party, Lin Shan's group crossed through the outer defensive formation.

Upon entering, the scenery transformed—birds sang among fragrant flowers, streams murmured through the landscape, and meticulously arranged spirit herb fields stretched into the distance. Bamboo groves stood tall and lush, creating a uniquely harmonious blend of mountain and water aesthetics.

As they proceeded, spirit deer and goats occasionally appeared, their eyes gleaming with intelligence. The Gongsun family clearly had considerable expertise in beast taming, allowing these creatures to roam freely within their estate.

After passing two spirit mountains, they encountered medicinal herb fields where Gongsun disciples carefully tended to batches of herbs. Some transported materials to nearby alchemy workshops, where chimneys emitted earth-fire smoke and the fragrance of pills wafted through the air.

Adjacent to the alchemy workshops stood forging pavilions, the constant "ding-dang" of metalwork punctuated by the clear ring of newly forged magical weapons. The Gongsun family evidently had established production lines for these items.

Further along, they passed training courtyards where elder cultivators instructed disciples—not only explaining cultivation techniques for various realms but also personally teaching spells and combat skills.

After traveling several miles through this prosperous scene, Lin Shan had witnessed enough to appreciate the Gongsun family's profound heritage and long-standing traditions.

Yet beneath the surface hospitality, he sensed an undercurrent of tension.

Through conversation, Lin Shan learned the middle-aged cultivator was Gongsun Lü, the current Second Elder of the Gongsun family. With the family head and First Elder—both Golden Core cultivators—in secluded cultivation, Gongsun Lü managed all internal and external affairs.

Lin Shan praised the Gongsun family's formidable strength, noting how their two Golden Core ancestors made them a prestigious lineage in the cultivation world.

Gongsun Lü modestly waved off the compliments and escorted Lin Shan to a pavilion for lodging. "Envoy Lin, after your long journey, please rest tonight. We'll discuss official matters tomorrow in the main hall."

Though Lin Shan preferred directness, he acquiesced to avoid appearing impolite. "As guests, we follow our hosts' arrangements."

After Gongsun Lü departed, Lin Shan's smile faded as he entered the pavilion. His subordinates gathered around, led by his trusted aide, Old Man Zhong.

"Sir, while our arrival seems smooth, requesting reinforcements tomorrow may prove difficult."

"Naturally. No faction would willingly send their own to the frontlines as cannon fodder in the righteous-demonic war," Lin Shan mused, pondering Protector Yan's cryptic words before his departure.

Was the demonic front truly in need of support from smaller sects and families? Or was this merely a warning against causing trouble in the rear? Perhaps the mission was simply an excuse to remove him from danger?

Though Lin Shan had his suspicions, he couldn't discern his superiors' true intentions. Regardless, he would proceed as planned—presenting the recruitment order directly to Gongsun Lü tomorrow and gauging the reaction.

If the Gongsun family resisted sending troops, he'd ensure they compensated him handsomely instead. With the Great Song's situation deteriorating, Lin Shan intended to exploit his position for maximum benefit while the demonic factions still held sway.

It was time to abandon scruples and seize whatever advantages he could—a sentiment Protector Yan likely shared.

Suddenly, the Void Star Compass in his storage bracelet shimmered with phantom images of shifting spiritual veins. Lin Shan's expression changed. He dismissed his subordinates and isolated himself in an upstairs room with a privacy array before examining the compass.

The spiritual artifact displayed chaotic energy flows—cloud-like formations coalescing and dispersing across its surface. After careful study, Lin Shan comprehended the phenomenon and connected it to the strange atmosphere he'd sensed at the Gongsun estate.

A smile crept across his face. The newly acquired treasure had delivered an unexpected windfall before he'd even grown accustomed to it. His gaze grew distant as possibilities unfolded.

The next morning in the main hall, Lin Shan and Gongsun Lü sat opposite each other, flanked by over a dozen Gongsun elders—all at least Foundation Establishment cultivators (and likely more unseen).

Lin Shan presented the recruitment order from Protector Yan. When Gongsun Lü channeled spiritual energy into the token, it erupted with white light, projecting a semi-transparent image of an elderly man—the Black Lotus Sect's Discipline Dharma King, a Nascent Soul powerhouse.

"Members of the Gongsun family," the projection declared, "the demonic front requires your assistance. Dispatch one Golden Core cultivator and twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators to report at East Gate Pass in the central warzone. I await your arrival."

With a crisp snap, the token shattered, and the projection vanished.

The hall erupted in shocked gasps. The Gongsun elders exchanged dark looks, some glaring at Lin Shan, who sipped tea with practiced nonchalance.

Tension thickened the air until Gongsun Lü broke the silence with a strained smile. "Envoy Lin, the Dharma King's demands... present certain difficulties."

Lin Shan set down his cup. "Such concerns should be addressed to the Dharma King, not me. I'm merely a messenger." He leaned back, adding pointedly, "Though I needn't remind you of the consequences for delaying wartime orders."

Spiritual pressure seemed to emanate from the hall itself, weighing heavily on the gathering. The elders' expressions darkened further, but none dared voice objections.

Gongsun Lü rubbed his teacup nervously before venturing, "Given your youth and talent—already at mid-Foundation Establishment—you must be highly regarded within the sect. Perhaps you could... intercede on our behalf? If the quota could be halved, the Gongsun family would show our gratitude."

Lin Shan's eyes flickered across the silent elders. Their tacit approval of the bribe stirred his interest. Considering the Void Star Compass's reaction and the vague nature of his orders, the Dharma King's demand might have been pro forma. If the Gongsun family's offer proved substantial enough...

He feigned reluctance. "This order comes directly from the high command, personally issued by the Discipline Dharma King—"

"Fifty thousand spirit stones," Gongsun Lü interjected without blinking.

Lin Shan nearly choked. The Gongsun family's wealth was staggering—this sum equaled a quarter of the inheritance he'd received from Master Turtle! Yet compared to sacrificing a Golden Core elder and twenty Foundation cultivators, it was a bargain.

Playing the conflicted official, Lin Shan mused, "The high command may have underestimated your family's circumstances. If your forces are already stretched thin..."

The elders leaned forward eagerly—until Lin Shan pivoted: "Yet the righteous-demonic war concerns our very way of life! Shouldn't we prioritize righteousness over family interests?"

"One hundred thousand stones!" Gongsun Lü countered bluntly.

Lin Shan inwardly applauded the man's decisiveness but remained in character: "While your loyalty is commendable, I couldn't possibly accept—"

"One hundred fifty thousand," Gongsun Lü pressed, his voice trembling slightly at the staggering sum.

The elders glared daggers at Lin Shan, their earlier goodwill evaporated. Even the Black Skeleton Monarch transmitted a warning: "Enough! Even rabbits bite when cornered!"

Lin Shan remained unfazed. "The emperor isn't worried—why should the eunuch panic? These vassals owe military service. If they're hoarding strength like fence-sitters, they deserve to pay."

Having gauged their limits, Lin Shan revealed his true demand: "The stones alone aren't enough. I require access to your spiritual vein's depths for secluded cultivation."

The atmosphere turned electric. The elders' breathing grew ragged, their faces twitching with suspicion yet remaining eerily silent.

Lin Shan smirked. "What? Willing to part with 150,000 stones but not spare some spiritual energy?"

Gongsun Lü forced a smile. "Surely a sect envoy like yourself has experienced superior cultivation sites. Our humble vein would hardly—"

"Modesty doesn't suit you," Lin Shan interrupted. "Your family's vein is experiencing a once-in-a-millennium phenomenon!"

Gongsun Lü's smile froze. "What do you mean?"

"Spiritual Tide."

Lin Shan set down his teacup with finality. "I wish to experience this Spiritual Tide. Grant me this, and we have an agreement."

The elders shot to their feet, their unleashed spiritual energy blasting the doors open and knocking guards outside off their feet. "How do you know about the Spiritual Tide?!" they cried in unison.

Their panic was understandable—Spiritual Tides were unpredictable natural phenomena. When celestial alignments and terrestrial energies converged, spiritual veins could erupt with liquefied energy and heavenly dew, creating cultivation conditions that advanced progress by leaps and bounds. Such events occurred perhaps once every thousand years per vein.

The Gongsun family had discovered their vein's impending tide six months prior through ancient texts and kept it strictly secret, fearing Nascent Soul experts would seize the opportunity. Their reluctance to send cultivators to war stemmed from needing five Foundation elders to partake in the tide—losing twenty more would leave them vulnerable.

Yet Lin Shan had uncovered their secret within a day. He smiled mysteriously—the Void Star Compass, a primordial spiritual treasure, rendered such secrets transparent. The Gongsun family's timing was impeccable; their attempt to monopolize this fortune had coincided with his arrival.

He was, after all, the cultivation world's walking seismograph.
