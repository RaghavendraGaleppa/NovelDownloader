# Chapter 88: Pill of Vein Unblocking - Fire Control

Ding Rui's cultivation grew rapidly with such diligent practice. After completing his daily tasks, he would head straight to Li Yizhen's home to practice alchemy-related skills, especially concerning fire control. Fire control is the foundation of alchemy, and its most crucial aspect, so Ding Rui prioritized mastering this skill.

After spending several days, he somewhat grasped the laws of fire and could finally control it. He immediately recorded all the fire variations required during the entire refining process of the Pill of Vein Unblocking and memorized them. He now understood exactly when the fire should be strong, when it should be weak, and where it should be directed, linking these actions seamlessly in his mind. He then continuously practiced using this sequence. If he could perfectly succeed even once, he would immediately grasp the skill. After that, when refining pills, he would only need to activate this skill, and the skill slot would automatically control the fire variations until the end of the refining process, without any issues! Other cultivators needed to constantly monitor and control the fire throughout the entire alchemy process, and due to other procedures, they couldn't achieve perfect control. But for Ding Rui, he just needed to have a single thought when starting alchemy! Just thinking about it felt great, so Ding Rui practiced even harder. He would often take out the true essence from his *Condensing Yang Art* to toy with it. Of course, he spent a lot of time at Li Yizhen's home.

After more than half a month, and with Li Yizhen's gradually sharper critiques, Ding Rui had deeply understood how poor his talent for fire control was. Unsurprisingly, it seemed he would need to condense a new fire control skill for every type of pill he learned. However, Ding Rui also knew that his ultimate goal was to try his best to condense the entire pill refining process into a single skill slot. So, this wasn't really a problem. With seven skill slots, and a method to fuse skills, he could solve most problems if he put his mind to it. Nevertheless, he still felt great regret. When he created this external skill slot system, why didn't he make a few more? A hundred would be perfect! Even if not a hundred, ten would be fine too! At the very least, it would be much better than the current seven. Life was truly too tight and constrained!

After these days of adjustment, Ding Rui currently had five skills in his skill slots: [Gold Wood Earth], [Five Elements Unification], [Ice Flame Palm], [Double Pit], and the recently mastered [Pill of Vein Unblocking: Fire Control]. The previous [Pit] skill had naturally been discarded due to the existence of [Double Pit]. For the remaining two skill slots, Ding Rui had to find a way to incorporate the more crucial procedures of refining the Pill of Vein Unblocking.

Next was the pill collection. Originally, pill control and collection should be done in one go. But Ding Rui separated the two, which would undoubtedly reduce the difficulty slightly, and he had enough skill slots anyway. As for which to master first, pill control or pill collection, Ding Rui's original idea was to master pill collection first. But upon closer thought, he decided to master pill control instead. Firstly, because the pill collection for the Pill of Vein Unblocking was simple and short-lived, making it slightly easier to practice. Secondly, pill control was one of the most crucial procedures in refining pills, almost on par with fire control. Moreover, the two required an almost perfect combination, meaning the difficulty was considerable. If he didn't master pill control well, alchemy would be virtually impossible. So, it made sense to first master what was easier to grasp.

But why did Ding Rui change his mind to pill control? This was because he had originally planned to help Li Yizhen collect pills during her refining of the Pill of Vein Unblocking, to practice and eventually master the pill collection skill. But then he reconsidered: currently, the sect was most in need of Pills of Vein Unblocking, and Li Yizhen's alchemy already had a chance of failure.
