# Chapter 129: Let Fate Decide!

Cultivation knows no passage of time. In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.

Within the Qingfeng Dao Academy, winds rose and clouds scudded as the academy issued orders to recall all disciples in preparation for the campaign against the Crimson Moon Great River. 

All disciples were required to participate, except those in secluded cultivation on the verge of breaking through their current realms. Even the disciples of the "Guardian Vein" faction had to send the majority of their members to serve as logistical support. 

Countless array disks, command banners, treasure ships, magical instruments, and talismans were continuously hauled out from the treasuries like an unending tide.

The academy decreed that Qi Refinement disciples must immediately begin training in grand formations for unforeseen circumstances. 

Every disciple was granted a new magical instrument, while Foundation Establishment cultivators each received a new spiritual artifact. 

Preparations were in full swing.

Though this seemed sudden, there was no alternative. 

The Luoxia Sect had achieved successive victories, conquering nearly half of the Thunderclap Mountain Range. Every day, vast quantities of spiritual ores and resources were transported back to their mountain gate, and almost every month, a new spiritual peak was added to their territory. 

It could be said that every surviving Luoxia disciple now possessed several magical instruments, hundreds of spirit stones, and bulging storage pouches. 

The accumulated treasures of the Purple-Gold Six-Winged Vulture over many years had all fallen into Luoxia Sect's hands. 

With this victory, the Luoxia Sect was poised to usher in a glorious era. 

Naturally, Qingfeng Dao Academy could not afford to lag behind. 

The disciples were of mixed minds—some excited, others fearful, their expressions varied—but all were desperately bolstering their strength.

Meanwhile, in five different caves across Qingfeng Dao Academy, five cultivators were striving to refine the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

"Boom!"

After an unknown length of time, the Three Flames Cave erupted with turbulent winds and swirling spiritual energy, flames spilling outward. Accompanied by a hearty laugh, a young Daoist with an ordinary face but eyes that seemed to carry the weight of time emerged, standing in the void as he gazed at the vast mountains and rivers.

"At last, success!"

Ma Wu sighed deeply, feeling the abundant lifespan and vitality within his body.

"Boom!"

As if by prior arrangement, another cave on Golden Origin Island also erupted with surging spiritual energy. A young woman in a green Daoist robe, her delicate face flushed with excitement and a faint scent of elixirs about her, emerged from seclusion.

"Boom!"

In yet another cave on Golden Origin Island, a tanned young man in short sleeves let out a long roar that shook the surroundings as he too broke through and emerged.

"Junior Sister Fu! Junior Brother Lü! Congratulations on reaching Foundation Establishment!" 

Ma Wu laughed heartily, transforming into a streak of light as he approached the two, offering his congratulations.

Fu Youling and Lü Zijin exchanged glances, both beaming with joy as they returned the courtesy: "Congratulations, Senior Brother Ma!"

The three had all achieved Foundation Establishment thanks to Gu Yuan's aid. Coming from humble backgrounds, they naturally formed an alliance and treated each other warmly.

"At least we broke through before the campaign, sparing ourselves from becoming cannon fodder..." 

Ma Wu sighed as he watched the bustling Qi Refinement disciples on the island.

"All thanks to Senior Brother Gu..."

Fu Hongling and Lü Zijin were equally moved. 

Without Gu Yuan, given their original strength, obtaining the spiritual energy needed for Foundation Establishment would have taken who knows how long. They might have perished in the Crimson Moon Great River before ever getting the chance.

"How is Senior Brother Song doing?"

Amid their joy, the trio couldn't help but turn their gaze toward another cave on Golden Origin Island. 

That was the cave of Song Shan, the elderly farmer skilled in tending spiritual fields. Being the oldest among them, he faced the highest risk during Foundation Establishment. They wondered if he could pull through.

"Boom!"

Just as they worried, spiritual energy surged within the cave, transforming into verdant wood energy as it poured inside.

"Hahaha! To think this old man would live to see this day!"

A deep voice, tinged with tears, echoed out before a middle-aged farmer with a weathered face soared into the air and landed beside them.

"Apologies for keeping you all waiting, fellow seniors!"

Song Shan bowed deeply, his demeanor humble.

"No need for formalities, Senior Brother Song. Now that we've all achieved Foundation Establishment, it's time to pay our respects at the mountain gate!"

Ma Wu waved his sleeve and called out cheerfully.

"Let's go, together!"

With shared glances, the group set off toward the Earthflame Island.

Meanwhile, within a cave on Bifall Peak, a handsome young man shattered his shackles and soared into the sky, hovering above the flowing clouds.

There, atop the clouds, Elder Lu Guan watched with satisfaction.

"Master, your disciple has not failed your expectations. I have achieved Foundation Establishment!"

The young man prostrated himself before Lu Guan.

"With our Patriarch absent, Bifall Peak, though still one of the seven major veins, has declined over the years, even falling behind some ordinary noble families. Your success ensures our lineage continues."

Elder Lu Guan sighed deeply.

"Master, must I truly serve under Gu Yuan? I wish to remain by your side."

After a moment of hesitation, the young man voiced his reluctance.

"What? Has your heart grown restless so soon after reaching Foundation Establishment?"

Lu Guan raised an eyebrow, his tone teasing.

The young man remained silent.

"With such shortsightedness, how can I entrust Bifall Peak to you in the future?"

Lu Guan sighed again.

"Do you know which faction currently has the most early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators in the academy?"

The disciple shook his head.

"Spending all your time in bitter cultivation without achieving anything—you truly need tempering."

Lu Guan sighed once more before continuing, "Currently, the Su Family reigns supreme in the academy. Even with their poor showing at the Flowing Clouds Banquet, they still command eight early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Following them is Gu Yuan."

"Under him, six Foundation Establishment cultivators serve, and with his own strength, that makes seven. This force is formidable even within the academy. Our Bifall Peak, including you, only has four. The rest of us elders have other duties and cannot accompany you. If you venture into the Crimson Moon Great River alone, what are your chances of survival?"

"Or would you rather serve under the Azureflame Peak?"

Lu Guan's tone grew stern toward the end.

"Your disciple wouldn't dare!"

The young man paled, shaking his head.

"Gu Yuan is at the height of his influence now. As long as no one schemes against him, he will surely achieve great gains. Following him is better than going alone."

"What if someone does scheme against him?"

"...Legacies must be inherited by someone. After you return from Earthflame Island, I will bestow upon you a spiritual artifact for protection. You must carve out a name for yourself under his banner and gain leadership experience."

After a long silence, Lu Guan spoke slowly.

The disciple's heart clenched as he grasped his master's intentions.

"Don't overthink it. I'm merely preparing for all possibilities. Once you arrive at Earthflame Island, you must sincerely swear a Dao Heart Oath to serve for fifty years."

"This is a decree from the higher-ups—do not act recklessly. Focus solely on your service. As for the rest... let fate decide!"

Lu Guan cautioned, fearing his disciple might misunderstand.

"But what if... fate truly favors him and no mishap befalls him?"

The disciple pressed.

"Then serve him faithfully. Standing behind such a figure would hardly be a disgrace..."
