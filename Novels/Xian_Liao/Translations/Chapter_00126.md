# Chapter 126: The Transformation of Maori and the Great Mulberry Tree

Zhou Qing carefully assessed his current strength, calming his mind before turning his attention to the Nourishing Life Master:

**Cultivation Method**: Sacred Heart Art  
**Realm**: Dao Furnace  
**Divine Sense**: Foundation Establishment Perfection  
**Five Organs Thunder**: Heart Fire Thunder, Liver Wood Thunder, Kidney Water Thunder, Lung Metal Thunder  
**Sword Dao**: Sword Qi Thunder Sound  
**Intermediate Artifact Refining Technique**  
**Intermediate Alchemy Technique**  
**Beast Taming Art**: Little Snake  
**Spiritual Cultivation Spells**: Soul Suppression, Soul Disruption  
**Demonic Arts**: Soul Bewilderment Technique  
**Spells**: Frost Envelops the World  
**Unique Skills**: Threefold Convergence of Primordial Qi  
**Divine Abilities**: Truth-Seeing Eye, Thousand Illusions, Qingyang Spiritual Fire, Primordial Heavy Water...  
**Lifebound Artifact**: Green Sword  
**Lifespan**: 400 years  

Beyond the growth in his mana and physical breakthrough, Zhou Qing was most satisfied that after over two years of nurturing by the entry-level Primordial Heavy Water, the Green Sword had fully become his lifebound artifact. Though still at the high-grade level, its power in his hands now rivaled that of top-grade artifacts.

Moreover, the Green Sword no longer required a sheath—Zhou Qing himself had become its scabbard. The Dao Furnace was Zhou Qing, and Zhou Qing was the Dao Furnace. It could be said the sword had been sheathed within the Dao Furnace.

From the Nourishing Life Master's information, Zhou Qing also discovered that one could possess more than one lifebound artifact. He could forge additional ones in the future. However, he prioritized quality over quantity for now. If his cultivation plateaued later, he might consider crafting more to enhance his strength. Should he reach the Golden Core stage, he could even contemplate forging magic treasures.

Lifebound artifacts, once refined into one's body, were perpetually nurtured within the Dao Furnace by the Primordial Heavy Water. Though classified as a divine ability, Primordial Heavy Water also exhibited spiritual material properties. Its sheer weight alone made it a terrifying offensive tool.

Cultivating Primordial Heavy Water demanded an exceptionally robust physique—ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn't withstand it. Even when Zhou Qing didn't actively control it, his body constantly bore its crushing pressure, which inadvertently tempered his physique.

Currently, Zhou Qing possessed nine drops of Primordial Heavy Water, the limit for the first layer. To advance to the second layer, these nine drops needed to merge into one—a feat requiring Golden Core-level mana.

After testing the Green Sword's power with satisfaction, Zhou Qing suddenly sensed something.

"Maori?"

He detected intense spiritual fluctuations emanating from the rooster. After brief consideration, he brought Maori back to the Jiangzhou Herb Garden, near the Great Mulberry Tree.

It was late autumn in Jiangzhou, with chilly winds sweeping through. Yet the Great Mulberry Tree radiated warmth. Upon arrival, Maori immediately positioned itself beside the tree.

Surprisingly, the tree didn't drive it away. Despite the overcast weather, Maori's body blazed with flames that the Great Mulberry Tree absorbed rather than feared. Simultaneously, Maori's aura surged dramatically.

"Wood and Fire nurturing each other?" Zhou Qing observed the scene, recognizing a mystical interaction between the two. They seemed to be leveraging each other's energies for a crucial transformation.

Zhou Qing's Five Organs Thunder cultivation followed an inverted elemental sequence—Fire, then Wood, Water, and now Lung Metal Thunder. He could distinctly sense the Great Mulberry Tree's emotions as it absorbed Maori's flames, igniting its own fiery nature derived from Zhou Qing and its innate yin-contained-yang.

Maori's flames catalyzed the tree's fiery aspect while drawing vitality from the tree to undergo its own metamorphosis. In the garden, the Great Mulberry Tree became a flaming entity, while Maori transformed into a fiery bird, bathed in the tree's vigorous life force.

Zhou Qing watched without interference, trusting his intuition to let nature take its course.

Lin Wan'er arrived in a plain dress, carrying tea. "Wan'er, hold off on the Spirit Flight Mystic Tone Scripture. Let's observe their transformation." She often prepared tea when Zhou Qing returned, accompanying it with her "Human Harmony" realm music from the scripture.

Zhou Qing judged her Human Harmony had reached perfection, half a step from the next realm, Earthly Harmony—though he couldn't guide her further, as the scripture was an auxiliary cultivation method unsuitable for his non-musical constitution.

As they conversed about local affairs and the Dao Court's governance, Zhou Qing emphasized principles of inner cultivation and moral integrity, easing Lin Wan'er's lingering anxieties from past hardships.

His words inadvertently loosened her bottleneck. When Maori took flight like a setting sun and the Great Mulberry Tree's leaves trembled as if sighing, Lin Wan'er experienced an epiphany. She began playing her zither, the music naturally soothing and harmonizing the scene.

Zhou Qing's divine sense, already at Foundation Establishment perfection, felt purified, his Truth-Seeing Eye advancing unexpectedly to the third layer. 

Approaching the Great Mulberry Tree, Zhou Qing placed his hand on its trunk, receiving an overwhelming surge of vitality that dissipated gathering storm clouds—signs of an impending heavenly tribulation the tree had temporarily avoided by transferring excess energy to him.

Through this exchange, Zhou Qing learned the Great Mulberry Tree had reached Foundation Establishment perfection, nearing Golden Core formation, which would invite tribulation. Maori had similarly advanced to late Foundation Establishment.

The herb garden's spiritual energy density now approached half that of the Water Manor, concentrated around the transformed tree and rooster. The towering Great Mulberry Tree had become a magnificent spectacle, impervious to natural elements.

Realizing the tree would face tribulation at Golden Core, Zhou Qing pondered whether he would too—a question unanswered by his current knowledge from the Jingyang Dao Domain.

The Primordial Heavy Water-enhanced Green Sword, now a top-grade artifact, demonstrated staggering power when Zhou Qing unleashed fifty Wood Thunder strikes effortlessly (with potential for a hundred at full strength), scattering the lingering clouds.

In the following days, Zhou Qing assessed two youths for foundational cultivation techniques and met with Butcher Hu, whose determination to cultivate despite age-related limitations moved Zhou Qing to promise further guidance.

Reflecting on their long association, Zhou Qing acknowledged Butcher Hu's unwavering loyalty and pioneering spirit, vowing to light his path forward on the arduous journey of cultivation.
