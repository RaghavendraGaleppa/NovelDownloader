**Chapter 80: Supreme Level, Buddha-Demon**

Yang Ji sized up the palm-sized, miniature child in his hand. This fellow was previously an ugly creature with a ferocious ghost head on its mushroom cap. Now, having shed its ugly form and bathed in Buddhist light, it appeared remarkably sacred. Yang Ji looked at the words "Buddhist Scripture" above its head. After a moment of thought, he told the others, "You all wait for me outside the secret chamber first."

"Understood, Honored Master," the white-haired elder and the others understood, supporting each other as they walked out. The strong-suited young woman glanced at the little child Moxie had transformed into, then at Yang Ji, before also following them out. Yang Ji glanced at the word "Cunning" above Moxie's head and said, "Stop pretending to be a revered monk. Let me ask you, where did the Buddhist scripture you cultivate come from?"

"What Buddhist scripture? I don't know what Benefactor is talking about," Moxie's heart skipped a beat. It feigned composure, putting its palms together and saying, "This is merely my original form. I am not Moxie, but Sacred Mushroom, born by bathing in Buddhist light."

"Sacred Mushroom, born by bathing in Buddhist light?" Its words seemed to contain no lie, as Yang Ji couldn't detect any anomalies. Staring at "Buddhist Scripture" above its head, he naturally grew curious.

However, the Golden Finger could only display information about an object's current state; it couldn't predict the future or the past, nor could it read memories. For instance, when it saw the Buddhist light, which Moxie was secretly projecting as an act of sanctity through its scripture, it displayed "Buddhist Scripture." But it couldn't show the actual text of the scripture. Similarly, when looking at a person, like the Eight Profound City Lord, it could show his current strength. When the eight City Lords merged to become Emperor Xuan Sha, his state changed, and the information naturally shifted, thus displaying "One Mind, Eight Faces." To discern a person's inner thoughts, it relied on subtle changes in their expression and eyes. While this ability could delve into the minutest details, accurately reading any slight emotional fluctuation, it could only perceive current thoughts, not future ones.

Nevertheless, this was sufficient. Everyone in the world was mortal; it was impossible to completely eradicate the seven emotions and six desires, not even for a Buddha. Thus, Yang Ji only needed to meet their gaze to discern their current inner thoughts through the subtlest changes in their expressions. Ultimately, the Golden Finger could only reveal an object's basic attributes and its currently displayed state, not delve deeper. For example, when looking at a holy medicine, it could only reveal its age, effects, and name, but not its origin or which secret realm it was harvested from. The Golden Finger possessed no causal abilities. The only thing it could predict was the weather forecast, accurate up to an hour in advance. If Yang Ji wanted to obtain the Buddhist scripture Moxie cultivated now, simply observing the Buddhist light wouldn't suffice, unless Moxie wrote the scripture out.

Noticing Yang Ji's sudden silence, the seemingly calm Moxie was inwardly terrified. Its small eyes kept darting towards Yang Ji, fearing he might suddenly erupt in anger. Yang Ji glanced at it, then raised an eyebrow and said, "Since you don't know any Buddhist scriptures, it seems you don't have much value left. I can only use you for alchemy. Whether you're a yin-attribute minor holy medicine or a yang-attribute minor holy medicine, as long as you are one, I have a hundred ways to refine you into a pill that can advance cultivation."

"Benefactor, you want to use me for alchemy?" Moxie softly asked, exhaling a wisp of Buddhist light and pressing its palms together.

"This minor holy medicine of yours contains Buddhist light, so its medicinal effects are certainly extraordinary. Refining it into a pill is an excellent choice. This is your destiny, to realize your full value. Every living being hopes to see this, and I believe you're no exception, right?" Yang Ji said, looking at Moxie.

Moxie's expression remained unchanged. It calmly replied, "In ancient times, the Buddha sacrificed his flesh to feed an eagle. Now, this Sacred Mushroom sacrifices itself. To ignite the flame of hope, to complete others, as the saying goes, if I don't enter hell, who will? This is the principle of my Buddha."

Watching the calm-faced Moxie, who was actually panicking internally, Yang Ji inwardly chuckled, wondering how long it could keep up the act. He nodded in approval, then went along with it, saying, "As expected of a spiritual being born from bathing in Buddhist light, truly understanding Buddhist principles. After rebirth, you'll surely become a true child under a Bodhisattva. So, may you rest in peace on your journey."

"The ancients would burn incense and bathe before divination. I shall offer myself by praying to my Buddha, so that in my next life, I may move the gods. Benefactor, may this humble child pray for a moment?" Moxie's expression remained normal, a faint smile on its face. Moxie was so composed and calm, facing death with such freedom and frankness, truly like an enlightened Buddha. Even Yang Ji was momentarily stunned; if not for his Golden Finger that could see through Moxie's thoughts, he might have been fooled by its profound appearance. Moxie maintained a faint smile, but under Yang Ji's amused gaze, it felt a chill in its heart, a hint of fear hidden deep in its eyes. It always felt that the person before it was too bizarre, as if he could see right through it, making it uneasy.

"Benefactor, will you permit it?" Moxie softly asked again, its voice clear, round, gentle, and delicate.

Yang Ji smiled and nodded, wanting to see what trick it would pull. He loosened his fingers and placed it on the ground. Moxie sat cross-legged, closed its eyes while pressing its palms together, a flicker of cunning perfectly hidden.

Soon, dozens of breaths passed. Yang Ji calmly said, "Alright, prayer finished. Time to go." He reached out to grab it, but what he picked up was Moxie's old shed skin. Moxie, hidden inside, had actually used the Golden Cicada shedding its shell technique to escape. It turned out that the moment Yang Ji raised his hand, holding the shed skin, his arm happened to block the ground, creating a blind spot. Moxie exploited this opening, moving incredibly fast, and in the blink of an eye, it had already darted to the channel entrance, even shouting a curse from the air.

"Your grandpa's! You're the one going on your way! Do you really think I'm an idiot, letting you refine me into a pill for free? The Buddha fed the eagle, but the eagle became the Buddha's mount! If I let you refine me into a pill, I get no benefit whatsoever and lose my life in vain! Bah!"

"You are a devil, slaughtering living beings! The Buddha will punish you! Amitābha, Buddha is merciful, punishing evildoers!"

Yang Ji was stunned, holding Moxie's old shed skin, and couldn't help but twitch his face upon hearing its "fragrant" words.

"Thinking you can escape like that? Truly wishful thinking." Yang Ji chuckled lightly, releasing his Sword Domain. Wherever his divine sense reached, it became part of the Sword Domain. Before long, Moxie was seen scurrying back in a panic. It twisted its feet frantically, as if they were tangled, like a cornered rat, running back and forth, trying to find a way to break through. But the Sword Domain tightened, sword qi pressing in, constantly compressing its activity range, leaving it with no options. Finally, fearing injury from the sword qi, it obediently ran back to Yang Ji's feet.

"Little punk, you were quite arrogant just now! Try cursing me again?" Yang Ji grabbed its ear and lifted it.

"Honored Master, have mercy! Your divine powers are vast! I, no, this humble Moxie, will never dare to escape again!" With its ear pinched, Moxie turned pale with fright and immediately began to wail piteously.

"Hmph, I'll refine you into a pill right now," Yang Ji ignored its pitiful state, opening his palm to release spiritual fire.

"Ah! No, Honored Master, you can't harm a child like this!"

"Ah! Devil, you are a devil!" As the spiritual fire in Yang Ji's palm drew closer, Moxie burst into miserable tears.

"You are a devil, severing my fortune, slaughtering me, making me sink! The Buddha will surely punish you! To think this Sacred Mushroom, carrying a supreme Buddhist scripture, is being harmed before even becoming a Buddha! Unresigned, unresigned!" Moxie cried out loudly.

"Supreme Buddhist Scripture!" Yang Ji pulled it close to his eyes, shooting out divine light that captivated its mind. Two beams of divine light enveloped Moxie, causing it to tremble. Yang Ji said fiercely, "Tell me the Buddhist scripture you cultivate, and perhaps I will spare your life."

"Devil, he's truly a devil! Even at death's door, he wants to squeeze me dry before stopping. Since death is inevitable anyway, why should I lose my integrity and beg him?" Thinking this, Moxie adopted a tragic expression.

"Hey, little Moxie, how about we make a deal?" Yang Ji suddenly said. Seeing it fearless of death and silent, Yang Ji continued to tempt it: "Alas, what a pity, to possess a supreme Buddhist scripture, yet be refined into a pill, cutting off its cultivation path, becoming food for others. What a pity, what a pity! Heaven envies talent!"

"Pity your grandpa, pity your great-grandpa! You want to eat me, and you want my Buddhist scripture, while pretending to pity me! I cannot be deceived, I cannot be insulted, I have my limits!" Moxie was furious internally, cursing non-stop.

"Since you're so ready to die, I'll grant your wish," Yang Ji snorted softly, and the spiritual fire in his palm suddenly swept towards Moxie. In just three breaths, it cried out in pain, "Ah, Honored Master, don't kill me! I'm willing to tell you the Buddhist scripture!"

"I thought you were tougher; turns out you're just putting on a brave face." Hearing this, Yang Ji flicked its forehead and moved the spiritual fire away, saying calmly, "Speak."

"Hon-Honored Master, the deal you just mentioned..." Moxie weakly asked.

"You only get one chance. You didn't seize it. Now, you're not qualified to propose a deal. Telling me the Buddhist scripture might lead me to consider sparing your life; refusing means death. You choose." Yang Ji glanced at it.

"I'll tell, I'll tell!" Moxie's eyelids twitched frantically, and it nodded obediently like a chicken pecking rice. "Honored Master, listen carefully. This humble Moxie is about to recite a world-shattering supreme Buddhist scripture. Please listen closely."

"Mm, go on!" Yang Ji nodded, listening intently. But after more than ten breaths, Moxie's face was flushed red, as if constipated, yet not a single word came out.

"Why aren't you speaking?" Yang Ji stared at it.

"I... I can't recite it. Every time I try to, the scripture becomes blurry and hides deep in my memory," Moxie said, frustrated.

"Can't recite it?" Yang Ji's expression subtly changed. "The Dharma is not passed to six ears. It seems you have indeed cultivated a Buddhist scripture that involves the Dao. This is the scripture protecting itself."

"Can you try writing it down?"

Yang Ji instantly grew serious, realizing that there might truly be a supreme Buddhist scripture in its possession. A scripture capable of self-protection was already sentient. A Buddhist scripture of this level was even higher than the Dao-level cultivation techniques and spells he practiced.

"I'll try," Moxie was also slightly surprised by the situation and was now attempting to write it down.

Moxie's hands pointed and drew in the air, trying to write out the Buddhist scripture in its mind. Soon, a mysterious tadpole-like character was laboriously etched into the void by Moxie's spiritual power. The tadpole-like character was incredibly nimble; as soon as it formed, it seemed alive, flickering non-stop in the void. What followed was a burst of brilliant Buddhist light, which made one feel focused and serene. The surrounding atmosphere became peaceful and tranquil, making one feel as if bathed in a spring breeze, as if ethereal Zen chants were echoing.

"It truly is a supreme scripture, keep writing!"

Yang Ji was instantly moved. Just by outlining the character's strokes, the character seemed to come alive. This was a manifestation of containing the profound principles of heaven and earth, stirring the Grand Dao of the cosmos. This was undoubtedly a supreme Dao-level cultivation technique.

Dao-level cultivation techniques also had grades: ordinary low-grade Dao-level techniques could only support cultivation up to the Void Refinement Realm; mid-grade Dao-level techniques up to the Body Integration Realm; and high-grade Dao-level techniques up to the Mahayana Realm. As for supreme Dao-level techniques, although they also allowed cultivation up to the Mahayana Realm, the principles and Dao they contained were far more profound and mysterious than high-grade Dao-level techniques, allowing one to touch upon more "Dao." When it comes to understanding the Dao, some precede others, and the more accomplished come first. The more Dao you can comprehend, the stronger you become. The stronger you are, the greater your chance of passing nine lightning tribulations and ascending to the Immortal Realm. This was half an immortality pass, and Yang Ji's eyes were now burning with fervent heat. It would be a lie to say he didn't want it. After all, the True Steel Divine Art he currently cultivated was only a high-grade Dao-level technique, a full major level lower. Moreover, this level was the "Dao" level, not the "quantity" of spiritual energy like low-level techniques. The gap between them was too vast, immeasurable like the waters of the four seas. Yang Ji was genuinely envious; a tiny Moxie's fortune was actually greater than his own. This was truly unfair! Looking at the tadpole-like character, his heart was burning, and he immediately said, "You continue writing."

Moxie nodded and laboriously wrote the next tadpole-like character. The moment this character appeared, a surge of demonic light erupted. Roars, wails, and tragic cries filled the air, as if one had been transported to hell.

"This?" Yang Ji's expression shifted slightly. The aura exuded by these two tadpole characters was completely different. One radiated widespread Buddhist light, signifying an era of peace and prosperity. The other unleashed rampant demonic light, resembling a hellish purgatory. These two characters seemed to represent two entirely different cultivation methods, one Buddhist, one Demonic. The two tadpole characters intertwined and collided, releasing a wave of Buddhist light and a wave of demonic light, yet astonishingly, there was no conflict or resistance between them, making it extraordinarily wondrous. The tadpole-like characters were abstruse and difficult to comprehend; they were extremely hard to memorize. As Yang Ji tried to decipher them in his mind, he heard Buddhist chants and demonic roars. The next moment, his soul felt as if it would explode.

Yang Ji broke out in a cold sweat and immediately stopped his contemplation. At this moment, Moxie laboriously wrote another tadpole rune. In the air, the three tadpole characters intertwined and collided, instantly forming a three-inch golden Buddha. Within the secret chamber, rolling Buddhist sounds and endless demonic sounds immediately resonated. The three-inch Buddha glowed with both Buddhist and demonic light. As this Buddha-Demon light diffused outwards, space itself began to collapse, unable to bear its weight. Boom! Celestial sounds echoed throughout the secret chamber, drums thundered, and Zen chants and Buddhist tones continued ceaselessly. The three-inch golden Buddha suddenly crushed space, and the area within three *zhang* around it cracked like a porcelain vase. Seeing this, Yang Ji quickly retreated. The three-inch golden Buddha fell into nothingness, seemingly losing its support point. The golden Buddha dispersed, transforming back into tadpole runes. The tadpole runes then evolved, turning decay into wonder, simplifying from complex to three simplified runes. Those three runes subtly spelled out "Buddha-Demon Scripture"!

"Buddha-Demon Scripture?"

Yang Ji's expression stirred. Although he had never heard of this cultivation method, he did not doubt its power. Generally, only the Buddhist Sons of the Buddhist Sect were qualified to cultivate such supreme-level Buddhist scriptures. How could this Moxie possess it? He couldn't believe that the Eight Profound City Lord had simply killed a Buddhist Son and that the Blood Refining Array had refined his essence, blood, and soul memories for Moxie to absorb. One must know that a Buddhist Son was a genius on par with a Dao Son. How could such a figure be casually killed? Furthermore, how could such a scripture be casually manifested? What virtue or ability did a mere Blood Refining Array possess to refine a scripture imbued with Buddhist principles? Yang Ji didn't believe it. This small Moxie actually harbored a supreme Buddhist scripture; there had to be a huge secret here.

Yang Ji grabbed Moxie, holding it in his hand, his emotions swirling. This scripture was too formidable. When written in the air, each character condensed Buddhist charm, possessing unfathomable power, so much so that space itself couldn't contain it. Moreover, it was already sentient. When he tried to comprehend it, just three characters gave him a splitting headache, clearly not permitted by the scripture because he was not the fated person. Even if he forcefully memorized such a scripture, it would dissipate into the Grand Dao without a trace. From the Dao it came, to the Dao it returned, leaving no mark. Yang Ji knew that if the scripture didn't permit it, he couldn't cultivate it even if he wrote it down. Looking at Moxie in his hand, he sighed at its immense fortune and then asked, "Where did you obtain this scripture?"

Moxie looked at Yang Ji, hesitated, then said, "I was originally an ordinary mushroom in the underground world, but I was born by bathing in demonic light and grew by listening to Buddhist principles, which is how I gained sentience and wisdom, becoming a minor holy medicine. After being unexpectedly collected by the Eight Profound City Lord and others, I absorbed many cultivators' soul fragments, and from that, I understood human nature. Actually, this Buddhist scripture was given to me by a senior wearing a black robe with unbound hair. I vaguely remember that senior called himself Buddha-Demon, and said that since I had accompanied him for many years, he would bestow a karmic opportunity upon me. With a single point of his finger, Buddhist light surged, and my mind gained a series of intermittent tadpole runes. From that, I fell into a deep slumber. When I awoke, Senior Buddha-Demon had already vanished. Not long after that, I was collected and taken away by the Eight Profound City Lord and others."
