# Chapter 5: The Five Elements Spiritual Roots  

Lu Xu sat cross-legged on the ground, calming his mind and focusing his spirit.  

Once his excitement had settled, he immediately stood up, took out his talisman-making tools, and began attempting to craft talismans.  

He spread out a blank talisman paper, gripped the talisman brush, dipped it in spiritual ink, and with swift, flowing strokes, completed the process in one go.  

His movements were incredibly smooth, each action as if honed through countless repetitions.  

Success on the first try!  

A brand-new Fireball Talisman appeared before him, even more refined than before!  

Seizing the moment, Lu Xu continued crafting talismans.  

Soon, another success!  

"Hahaha, I'm going to be rich from now on!"  

Lu Xu was ecstatic. He could already foresee his spirit stones increasing at an astonishing rate.  

After his excitement subsided, he collapsed onto his bed to recover his severely depleted mana and mental energy.  

The next day, after waking up, he went to the spiritual fields outside the market as usual, tilling the soil and sowing seeds. He cast a Minor Raincloud Spell once and used the Gengjin Technique to exterminate a few demonic insects that had emerged from the fields.  

Upon returning to the courtyard, Lu Xu saw a middle-aged man in his late thirties stepping out of one of the small buildings.  

The man had slightly tanned skin, a plain appearance, and looked utterly unremarkable.  

"Brother He!" Lu Xu greeted him.  

This was the third resident of the courtyard, named He Qing, a cultivator at the third level of Qi Refinement and a rare, warm-hearted individual.  

Like Old Man Xu, He Qing's spiritual roots were abysmal.  

Their Five Elements Spiritual Roots were all of the lowest grade.  

Yes, the Five Elements Spiritual Roots!  

In this world, everyone possessed spiritual roots, and all were complete with the five elements.  

Lacking any one of the elemental spiritual roots would result in physical deficiencies that prevented cultivation.  

In other words, every normal person in this world was a cultivator with five spiritual roots.  

However, the ability to sense spiritual energy varied for each spiritual root.  

The cultivation world thus classified cultivators' spiritual roots into different grades, ranging from the worst—lowest grade—to the best—Heavenly Spiritual Roots.  

Of course, some people's spiritual roots didn't even meet the lowest grade, rendering them incapable of cultivation. Such individuals were sometimes referred to as having no spiritual roots.  

A person's aptitude was determined by the highest-grade spiritual root among their five elements.  

For example, Lu Xu's spiritual roots for metal, water, fire, and earth were all of the low grade, while his wood spiritual root was of the mid-low grade.  

Thus, according to the "long board effect," his aptitude was mid-low, which was why the green stone stele had only displayed his wood spiritual root.  

This aptitude already surpassed that of ninety percent of cultivators in the cultivation world.  

"Brother Lu, I heard you've started learning talisman-making recently. How's it going? How many spirit stones have you earned? Want to buy a couple of my Black Feather Chickens?" He Qing approached with an enthusiastic smile.  

Black Feather Chickens were first-rank demonic beasts that required careful rearing for two and a half years to mature. He Qing's profession was raising chickens.  

"Please, Brother He, I've already taken out several spirit stone loans for talisman-making. I can't afford to buy chickens now!" Lu Xu shook his head repeatedly.  

He Qing's face immediately fell with disappointment. He sighed and patted Lu Xu's shoulder.  

"That was a risky decision. But since you're already in debt, I won't say more. Just be careful from now on. If things get really bad... think of a way to escape!"  

Lu Xu shook his head. "It's not that easy. If they dared to lend me the spirit stones, they must have ways to keep me under control. My only option is to work hard at talisman-making and hope for success!"  

As the two chatted, a young man in black martial attire with sharp, angular features walked in from outside.  

Leng Quan!  

This was the fourth resident of the courtyard and the one with the highest cultivation—already at the fourth level of Qi Refinement.  

His spiritual roots were also quite decent, with a mid-low-grade fire spiritual root, second only to Lu Xu's mid-low wood spiritual root.  

"Brother Leng, long time no see! Did you have a good haul this time?" Lu Xu greeted him first upon seeing him.  

Leng Quan forced a slight smile and nodded. "Not bad. I caught a Red-Striped Dragon Carp in the lake!"  

"Red-Striped Dragon Carp? That's even rarer than an average mid-rank first-tier demonic beast! It could sell for over fifty spirit stones! Brother Leng, you've struck gold!" He Qing exclaimed in surprise.  

"Heh, just lucky. A month spent on Green Lake wasn't wasted," Leng Quan said with a faint smile.  

He was an adventurer cultivator, living a high-risk life in pursuit of his hopes for Foundation Establishment.  

"You're the type who doesn't strike often, but when you do, it's enough for years! Your earnings are almost catching up to Old Man Xu's!"  

He Qing couldn't hide his envy. He toiled all year raising chickens and only earned thirty spirit stones—less than Leng Quan made in a month.  

"If you're envious, why not join me in hunting demonic beasts? I could use a reliable partner," Leng Quan suggested, crossing his arms.  

"No thanks. I don't want to die on Green Lake!" He Qing waved his hand, refusing without hesitation.  

At his age and cultivation level, any hope of Foundation Establishment was long gone.  

All he wanted now was a stable life. Perhaps he'd marry and have children someday, maybe even start a cultivation family.  

Adventuring? No thanks.  

Leng Quan raised an eyebrow and turned to Lu Xu. Recalling the recent rumors he'd heard, he sighed.  

"Brother Lu, to be honest, I think you'd be better off hunting demonic beasts with me than taking out loans to stubbornly pursue talisman-making. Demonic beasts are dangerous, but they're nothing compared to loan sharks!"  

"So everyone knows about my loans now. That's good—maybe no bandit cultivators will target someone drowning in debt. Killing me wouldn't net them much, and they'd just earn the wrath of my creditors!" Lu Xu thought to himself.  

He had fabricated the story about taking loans to avoid drawing the attention of bandit cultivators once his talisman profits increased.  

Whether it was effective or not, his reputation was now established.  

He laughed heartily and replied, "Thanks for the offer, Brother Leng, but I think I have some talent for talisman-making. Sticking with it might not lead to failure. Hunting demonic beasts, on the other hand, is far too dangerous!"  

Leng Quan shook his head. "Even if you succeed, how many years will it take to repay the loans? You'll never have a chance at Foundation Establishment this way!"  

Foundation Establishment was the dream of all Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Yet, it was also an insurmountable chasm.  

Out of thousands of Qi Refinement cultivators, perhaps not even one would succeed in establishing their foundation.  

"Brother Leng, you're almost at the fifth level of Qi Refinement, aren't you?" He Qing suddenly asked.  

Leng Quan nodded. "I've saved enough to buy a bottle of Nourishing Qi Pills. I should reach the fifth level within three years!"  

"Then you still have a real shot at advancing further!" He Qing said enviously.  

Then, his face twisted into a bitter smile.  

"But me? I gave up hope long ago."  

Shaking his head, He Qing turned and walked into his house, his back looking desolate.  

"I haven't given up on Foundation Establishment, but my path is destined to be different from theirs!" Lu Xu thought to himself.  

He cupped his hands toward Leng Quan in farewell and then retreated into his own house.  

---  

Lu Xu continued his relentless talisman-making for fifty more days.  

Four hundred sheets of talisman paper were exhausted, leaving him with one hundred and ten first-rank low-grade talismans.  

"Selling all these talismans will take some time!"  

The next day, he carried a pile of Fireball Talismans, Earth Spike Talismans, Frost Talismans, and others to the market's trading area.  

After setting up his stall in his usual spot, Lu Xu noticed that Yin Yu's stall was empty.  

"She's not here? Too bad—she could've helped me sell dozens of talismans at once!" He glanced at the opposite stall, thinking to himself.  

Looking to the side, he saw the fish-selling "Brother Gao" sitting calmly at his stall as usual.  

It seemed this man was always there every time Lu Xu visited.  

"Brother Lu, here to sell talismans again today?"  

A few hours later, a burly, rough-looking man approached and immediately struck up a conversation upon seeing Lu Xu.  

This was a customer referred by Yin Yu.  

"Brother Qin, how did the talismans I sold you last time work out?" Lu Xu asked with a smile.  

"Haha, not bad! Just as Red Leaf Rain said, your talisman-making skills are solid. How many do you have this time? I'd like to buy a few more..."  

Before long, the burly man left Lu Xu's stall after purchasing ten talismans in one go.  

"Brother Gao, setting up shop again today?"  

"Little Tiger, long time no see! You owe me a fish this time, don't you?"  

"Haha, fine. I bagged a White-Eyed Tiger that strayed from the Ten Thousand Demon Mountains a few days ago, so I've got some spirit stones to spare. I'll take one of your fish!"  

"White-Eyed Tiger? Impressive! You've hit the jackpot!"  

A conversation erupted from the neighboring stall. Lu Xu turned to see the fish seller chatting with a young man in martial attire.  

Lu Xu didn't recognize the young man, but judging by his fifth-level Qi Refinement aura, he was clearly no ordinary figure.  

After several encounters, Lu Xu had also learned the identity of the fish seller.  

His name was Gao Tianqiang, a sixth-level Qi Refinement expert.  

He had dug out a fish pond by Green Lake outside the market, raising many spiritual fish and earning hefty sums of spirit stones annually.  

Only the toughest could hold onto a fish pond.  

"This market is full of tough characters. With my low cultivation, I'd better keep playing the role of the inconspicuous nobody!" Lu Xu mused.  

Just then, a voice sounded beside him: "Brother, how much for your talismans?"  

Looking up, he saw the young man called "Little Tiger" walking over with a spiritual fish in hand.  

"All first-rank low-grade talismans—one spirit stone each. What kind are you looking for?" Lu Xu perked up at the prospect of business.  

"I need quite a few, but you're unfamiliar. How's your talisman-making skill?"  

The young man scrutinized Lu Xu, speaking slowly.  

"Little Tiger, don't underestimate this brother. Even Red Leaf Rain has bought his talismans multiple times!"  

The fish-selling stall owner, Gao, unexpectedly spoke up in Lu Xu's defense.  

"Oh? Red Leaf Rain?" The young man's eyes gleamed at the mention.  

"If Red Leaf Rain vouches for your talismans, then there's no issue. What do you have in stock?"
