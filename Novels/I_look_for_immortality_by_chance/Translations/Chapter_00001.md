# Chapter 1: The Demon Star Cavern and the Unprincipled Youth  

In the land of Ba, within the Demon Star Cavern—  

A deep, dark, and seemingly bottomless abyss stretched endlessly, its spiraling stone steps descending as if reaching into the very heart of the earth. Black miasma coiled like smoke, surging from the depths of the cavern like a demonic dragon, its claws bared as it soared toward the heavens.  

The air hissed and wailed, corroded by the sinister energy. A bird, passing overhead, flapped its wings a few times before abruptly plummeting into the cavern's depths.  

*Splat!*  

The bird, resembling a sparrow, died instantly upon impact.  

As soon as its corpse hit the ground, a pair of pale hands reached out, clutching it tightly.  

"Another foolish bird meets its end. Looks like we'll have meat today..."  

A low voice echoed in the darkness before a young man in a tattered green Daoist robe emerged.  

Tall but emaciated, his hair was dry and brittle, his lips bloodless, and his face as pale as paper—as if he hadn't seen sunlight in years. His eyes were dull, devoid of vitality. Yet, his steps remained steady, as though he hadn't lost hope despite the endless darkness of the cavern.  

With practiced ease, the young man plucked and skinned the bird. Then, a faint phantom glow flickered in his palm—a square, seal-like apparition, its base etched with strange, archaic runes. As an odd power surged within him, the seal flared with light, drawing upon the surrounding spiritual energy. A scorching flame seemed ready to ignite—  

But at that moment, a black iron bracelet on his wrist suddenly tightened, biting into his flesh with crushing force.  

Cold sweat beaded on his forehead from the agony, yet he clenched his teeth and forced his magic to activate the seal.  

*Whoosh!*  

A bright flame erupted in the darkness.  

The bird sizzled, its aroma filling the air.  

"Cough, cough!"  

"Gu Yuan, don't force your magic! The Spirit-Severing Bracelet drains your blood and qi—even if it doesn't kill you outright, the pain will!"  

A frail, elderly voice rasped from the shadows.  

"Eating raw flesh like an animal is beneath us!"  

Gu Yuan wiped the sweat from his brow, ignoring the heat as he tore the roasted bird in half. He handed one portion to the old man before carefully dividing his own share into three small pieces. He chewed slowly, savoring every bite before swallowing.  

In truth, the unseasoned meat was bland, but after months of imprisonment, even this simple meal brought rare satisfaction.  

*In my past life, I wouldn't have glanced at something so plain—back then, I'd demand spices, oils, and fresh greens...*  

But half a year in this world had taught him the depths of suffering.  

Six months ago, he had awakened in this body—a disciple of the Verdant Wood Sect, Gu Yuan. With access to the sect's secret techniques and resources, his future had seemed bright.  

But then the Demon Mire Sect attacked.  

The Verdant Wood Sect's defenses crumbled within half a day. The sect leader fell in battle, and the rest were slaughtered or crippled.  

Gu Yuan and hundreds of other disciples were captured, fitted with Spirit-Severing Bracelets, and forced into the Demon Star Cavern as miners.  

The cavern produced Demon Star Stones—rare minerals that expanded a cultivator's dantian and enhanced cultivation. But the deeper veins were saturated with corrosive miasma, fatal to mortals within days.  

Only cultivators could endure.  

For five months, Gu Yuan toiled in darkness, surviving on meager rations. Each day, they were required to mine at least three stones—failure meant a brutal lashing with poison-laced whips.  

The pain was unbearable, but it hardened Gu Yuan's resolve.  

Now, he turned to the motionless old man in the corner.  

"Senior Brother Yang, why aren't you eating?"  

The old man, Yang, had once been a peak ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator—but injuries had reduced him to this state.  

"Junior Brother... I'm dying."  

The cavern fell silent.  

Gu Yuan stepped closer, studying the man. Yang's skin was withered, his body wracked with black miasma.  

"I've been barely holding on. My dantian is ruined—every stone I mine brings me closer to death."  

Yang coughed weakly before gesturing to a hidden crevice. Beneath a pile of rags lay over twenty Demon Star Stones.  

"The Demon Mire Sect has a rule: mine thirty stones or one supreme-grade stone, and you can leave—if you bring them a corpse of a fellow Verdant Wood disciple as proof."  

Yang's voice was resigned.  

"Kill me. Take the stones. Survive."  

Gu Yuan met his gaze—then nodded.  

"Good. You don't need to feel guilty—wait, what?"  

Before Yang could react, Gu Yuan struck.  

His right hand, still bound by the Spirit-Severing Bracelet, lashed out with brutal efficiency.  

The flame-seal blazed to life once more—this time, aimed at Yang's skull.
