# Chapter 267: A Way Out

When he took a step, the moment his sole touched the rocky ground, the entire cave trembled slightly.

The explosive increase in bone density from the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Art paradoxically made his movements even lighter.

Xu Yunfan suddenly threw a punch at the cave wall. Amidst a thunderous roar, the hard granite was pierced as easily as tofu, yet his knuckles didn't even leave a white mark.

"Truly worthy of being the supreme technique of the Maitreya Temple. Just by practicing it for the first time, my Marrow Cleansing realm cultivation has advanced greatly!"

The bonfire gradually died out, and his cultivation session came to an end.

He didn't know how much time had passed. The sky outside the cave grew dark, and the bonfire was reduced to nothing but a few stray sparks.

Xu Yunfan slowly retracted his energy, exhaling a mouthful of turbid qi. His breath was as long and steady as a dragon's.

"The 'Meridian Marrow Cleansing Art' is truly profound. In just a day of practice, it has not only stabilized my Marrow Cleansing realm cultivation but also allowed me to touch the threshold of 'Golden Marrow and Jade Bones'."

In the days that followed, Xu Yunfan hardly ever left his cave, dedicating himself entirely to practicing the Nine曜 Swallowing Qi Technique, the Triple Burner Sword-Nourishing Art, and the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Art.

With the ginseng baby as the main ingredient and the essence of demonic flesh as a supplement, the Nine曜 Swallowing Qi Technique was mastered in a single night. The Triple Burner Sword-Nourishing Art progressed by leaps and bounds, while the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Art advanced steadily, continuously toughening his bones, regenerating golden marrow, and altering his bone structure.

As for the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art, after reaching the Marrow Cleansing realm, it had already entered the state of perfection, leaving no further room for cultivation. Without the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Art, he could only continuously temper the Red Serpent Mountain-Coiling Strength and the玄 Steel Hundred-Forged Body, slowly grinding his way to the peak of the Marrow Cleansing realm until he could advance no further.

Fortunately, fortunately, because of the appearance of the Dragon Scale Armor, it triggered a mechanism beneath the Divine Weapon Ridge, opening the Divine Weapon Ridge秘境 and bringing him to this small world秘境.

If he were in the outside world, he would likely have had to endure countless hardships to find a cultivation method or martial art for the Marrow Cleansing realm.

Sectarianism exists everywhere.

Half a month later, Xu Yunfan pulled the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer out of the giant bear's head. He looked at the extremely deep scratch on the hammerhead and then lowered his gaze to the Mountain-Ranging Bear beneath his feet.

The scratch on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was so deep it almost pierced through the entire head. The purple-red thunderfire patterns were broken at this point, revealing the indigo-colored雷纹钢 material inside.

Xu Yunfan's fingertip traced the crack, feeling the chilling demonic qi still lingering within, and his expression showed a hint of helplessness.

This demonic beast had unleashed its final, desperate attack before death. If the hammer's body hadn't been made of solid material with no shoddy workmanship, and had it been a large sword or saber, it would have long since snapped.

This treasure-grade weapon would be an exceptional weapon for any other ordinary Marrow Cleansing realm martial artist.

Yet, in Xu Yunfan's hands, it had been severely damaged.

"What a pity..."

He lowered his gaze to the mountain-like demonic beast corpse beneath his feet.

This giant bear had originally been lurking in a deep valley in the southern part of the秘境 and rarely attacked proactively. However, just before the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea, it suddenly went mad, its eyes as red as blood, and charged at him without any regard for its own life.

What was even more bizarre was that the demonic qi within the giant bear was in chaos, as if forcibly catalyzed by some force, causing the爆发 of its demonic aura at the moment of death to be far more powerful than that of an ordinary Marrow Cleansing realm demonic beast.

If any other ordinary Marrow Cleansing realm master had come, they probably wouldn't have been able to withstand the giant bear's ferocious attacks for even three exchanges.

Only Xu Yunfan, who had mastered the supreme techniques of various top sects across different realms, had pushed his own strength to an unbelievable level, far surpassing ordinary Marrow Cleansing realm martial artists. This was why he could stand his ground, fight it head-on, and hammer this giant bear demonic beast to death.

The price was that this Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, forged from雷纹钢, was almost completely ruined.

After stroking it for a long time, Xu Yunfan finally decided to carry it on his back. He would need to find a way to repair it once he left the秘境.

Even if he didn't need it now, he could give it to his senior brother Fu Jin or other disciples of the Forging Hall to use.

"The fifteenth one..."

Xu Yunfan muttered to himself.

Since he had entered the small world秘境, the demonic beasts he first encountered were only at the Blood Transformation realm, and a battle would only occur once every three to five days.

But as time passed, the frequency of attacks grew higher and higher, from one demonic beast every three days, to multiple demonic beasts in a single day, and now to at least one powerful demonic beast comparable to the Marrow Cleansing realm every day.

What made him even more vigilant was that these demonic beasts were often deranged, completely disregarding life and death, as if driven by some will to come and die.

"This秘境 is rejecting me."

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, looking towards the horizon.

Heaven only knows how many demonic beasts are lurking within this秘境. Wherever the terrain converges and spiritual energy gathers, there is必然 a demonic beast dwelling.

And such places where terrain converges are found everywhere in this small world秘境.

This once made him suspect it was man-made.

The spiritual energy in the秘境 was still rich, but he felt a vague sense of pressure, as if the entire world was gradually tightening its tolerance for him.

During this period, while cultivating, he had tried to measure the boundaries of this small world and discovered that its borders were constantly shrinking. The southern terrain was advancing towards the center by several yards each day, while new cliffs were appearing out of thin air in the north.

It was very strange, and what shocked him was that the terrain that appeared out of thin air was already inhabited by demonic beasts, which also seemed to have been born from nothing.

In this way, the demonic beasts were endless and could never be killed.

What made him most uneasy was the Yu Congling within the Extreme Dao remains.

Since the battle at the White Jade Palace, that remnant consciousness had never responded to his calls again.

Whether he poured his strength into the remains or called out to her directly, Yu Congling seemed to be completely silent.

If it weren't for the fact that he could still feel her aura within the Dragon Scale Armor, Xu Yunfan would have almost suspected that she had dissipated.

Although Xu Yunfan felt disheartened by this, he was not discouraged. Since he had entered this dream, he had come to understand that she had a cold and aloof nature.

"If I stay here any longer, I'm afraid the next things to come won't just be Marrow Cleansing realm demonic beasts..."

In some places with extremely favorable terrain, where spiritual energy converged like a tide, the demonic beasts dwelling there made even him feel a sense of dread.

They might be demonic beasts comparable to the Organ Refining realm, or perhaps even a step further, which could only be fought on equal terms by a Grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Cultivation.

Over the past three months,借助 the spiritual energy of the秘境, the essence of demonic flesh, and a ginseng root tendril every day, he had pushed the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Art to a state of minor success. The Golden Marrow Mercury Sludge could now cover his entire skeleton, and the effect of Jade Bones Chiming made his body's strength comparable to a sixth-grade treasure weapon.

Yet, even so, facing the increasingly frequent attacks from demonic beasts, he still felt a hint of exhaustion.

After processing the flesh of this giant bear, Xu Yunfan ate nearly half of it to fill his stomach, then began to search for the entrance and exit of the秘境.

The altar from which he had fallen from the Divine Weapon秘境 had long since withered away, showing no further abnormalities. It was clearly a one-way ticket, and he had to find another way out.

"In the end, I'm no match for those six great sects..."

Xu Yunfan stood at the edge of the altar, his fingertips tracing the mottled stone patterns.

This ancient altar, once radiant with flowing light, now only had a ground of shattered runes and dried bloodstains.

Dark green moss grew between the cracks in the stones. He crouched down and tapped the central array eye stone platform with his knuckles, but it only produced a dull "thump, thump" sound.
