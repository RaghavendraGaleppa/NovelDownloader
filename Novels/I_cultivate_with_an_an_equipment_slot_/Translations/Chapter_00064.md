# Chapter 64: First Place, Six-Attribute Magical Tool  

The Spiritual Plant Competition had concluded.  

Initially, everyone had arrived with great enthusiasm, but as the event progressed, their focus shifted entirely to Zhang Yan's performance. By the latter half, some participants even left early—some because their own disciples had forfeited, while others hurried off to prepare for the newly discovered secret realm.  

"Master, shouldn't we prepare as well?" Zhang Yan asked softly, standing beside Zhuge Wan.  

"No need," Zhuge Wan shook her head lightly. "Most of those who left are from minor sects at the Foundation Establishment level. They know nothing about the secret realm and are just hoping to get lucky.  

"We're different.  

"The Qingheng Sect has already gathered detailed information and even finalized the allocation of entry slots. As for those rogue cultivators and minor sect disciples? Let them go if they want. They won’t be able to enter anyway. Did they really think the Taiyi Sect’s secret realm would be so easy to access?"  

Zhang Yan fell silent.  

This was precisely why it was said that it was easier to rest under the shade of a great tree.  

Those minor sects and rogue cultivators were scrambling to prepare for a secret realm they knew nothing about, unaware that the major sects had already divided the spoils long ago. Their efforts were doomed to be in vain.  

"You don’t need to worry about entry slots. Focus on the Spiritual Plant Competition first."  

The winner of the competition was already a foregone conclusion.  

Soon, the Wanhua Palace announced the results.  

Zhang Yan had taken first place.  

He was then summoned alone by the Wanhua Palace representatives.  

"Young man, what’s your name?" The speaker was a dark-skinned elder. Despite his rough appearance, his demeanor was kindly.  

"This junior is Zhang Yan." Though Zhang Yan didn’t know the elder's identity, given that he was overseeing the competition, his status must be significant.  

"Good, very good. You performed exceptionally well in this competition. Here—this is a list of rewards. You may choose three items from it.  

"Additionally, the next Spiritual Plant Competition will be held at your Qingheng Sect." The elder smiled warmly as he spoke.  

"Many thanks, Senior!" Zhang Yan accepted the list and immediately scanned its contents. At first glance, he was utterly captivated.  

The list was extensive, containing nearly everything related to the art of spiritual plant cultivation—seeds, mature plants, cultivation techniques—hundreds of items in total.  

Unfortunately, there were no magical tools listed.  

Thinking quickly, Zhang Yan looked up at the elder and ventured, "Senior, might I request a set of spiritual plant cultivation tools instead? I don’t need new ones—your own used tools would suffice."  

---  

Zhang Yan was merely testing the waters.  

Even if the elder refused, there would be no harm done.  

He had specifically asked for spiritual plant tools rather than general magical tools for two reasons: First, this was a spiritual plant competition, and requesting unrelated items would seem inappropriate. Second, judging by the elder’s appearance, he seemed like someone who had dedicated his life to spiritual plant cultivation—so Zhang Yan tailored his request accordingly.  

"You want my used spiritual plant tools?" The elder paused briefly before nodding. "Very well. However, I no longer possess any complete sets. The only tool I have left is the spiritual hoe I’ve carried since I first began studying spiritual plants. It’s nothing particularly valuable, so I’ll give it to you."  

With that, the elder tapped his storage pouch, and a weathered-looking spiritual hoe appeared in his hand.  

It was indeed an ordinary tool, no different from the one Old Man Lin had given Zhang Yan when he first joined the sect—plain and unremarkable, the kind that could be bought for a few spirit stones in any market.  

"T-This…"  

While Zhang Yan remained unfazed, the onlookers were visibly stunned.  

Though the hoe itself was ordinary, its owner was anything but.  

This simple tool had gained extraordinary value simply because it had been used by him—especially since it was the very hoe he had carried since his earliest days of learning spiritual plant cultivation. Its significance was profound.  

"It’s just a hoe. No need for such reactions. Young friend, if you have time, we can discuss cultivation techniques further." The elder chuckled, his demeanor as unassuming as a kindly old neighbor.  

"Of course! Thank you!"  

Zhang Yan accepted the hoe.  

With just one glance, he was stunned by the attributes it carried.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Spiritual Hoe  
**[Equipment Grade]**: Low-grade Magical Tool  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Purple  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Master of Spiritual Plants** (In the art of spiritual plant cultivation, you may be called a master.)  
- **Spiritual Medicine Care LV3** (You can nurture all spiritual medicines below the third tier.)  
- **Plant Breeding LV2** (You can cultivate exceptional spiritual plants.)  
- **Spiritual Plant Experience +30%** (Gain 30% more experience when studying spiritual plant techniques.)  
- **Transplanting Mastery (Perfect)** (This spell has been perfected.)  
- **Wood Element Technique (Perfect)**  

One.  

Two.  

Three.  

…  

Six.  

An ordinary hoe, because of its previous owner, now bore six extraordinary attributes.  

---  

Just who was this elder?!  

Zhang Yan felt his scalp tingle.  

He had a rough understanding of how equipment attributes were generated—the more impressive the attributes, the more formidable the original owner.  

He had seen many magical tools in his time, even golden-grade ones, but this was the first time he had encountered a tool with six attributes—and all of them were top-tier!  

Two of them were even perfected spells!  

How absurd was that?  

Admittedly, he had already mastered the Wood Element Technique to perfection, but that didn’t matter. The other attributes were incredibly valuable on their own.  

"This tool won’t count toward your reward selections. You still have three choices left." After gifting the hoe, the elder handed the reward list back to Zhang Yan.  

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan began making his selections.  

Since most of the items were related to spiritual plant cultivation, he chose:  
1. A third-tier spiritual plant seed,  
2. A second-tier spiritual plant,  
3. A spell specifically for accelerating plant growth.  

The most valuable among them was the third-tier spiritual plant seed.  

Spiritual plants were categorized by tier:  
- First-tier corresponded to the Qi Refining stage,  
- Second-tier to Foundation Establishment,  
- Third-tier to Golden Core!  

Though third-tier plants took centuries to mature—far beyond his current lifespan—he could still contribute it to the sect.  

After all, the Qingheng Sect had treated him well, investing significant resources in him. It was only right to give something back.  

More importantly, the Qingheng Sect was never stingy. If he provided them with a third-tier seed, they would surely reward him handsomely in return.
