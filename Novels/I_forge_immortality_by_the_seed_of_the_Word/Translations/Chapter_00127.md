# Chapter 125: Return to Luodu

As soon as Zhang Jing passed the assessment within the Flowing Light Immortal Wall, the scenery before him abruptly transformed.

A faint, indescribable spiritual fragrance lingered in his nose, while the melodious calls of divine birds and immortal deer filled his ears—a symphony so beautiful it seemed it shouldn't belong to the mortal realm.

What is this—?

Zhang Jing looked around, his gaze suddenly freezing when he spotted an enormous list displaying thousands of densely packed names.

In an instant, he realized: this must be the renowned True Spirit Ranking.

His expression turned serious as he carefully scanned the list:

[First Place: Wan Shan (Nine Auspices Dao Academy)]  
[Second Place: Lai Feiyun (Hidden Source Dao Academy)]  
[276th Place: You Yuanming (Dragon Lake Dao Academy)]  
[1,713th Place: Nong Xingzhou (Dragon Lake Dao Academy)]  

From top to bottom, Zhang Jing found the names of two senior brothers from Dragon Lake Dao Academy. A trace of surprise involuntarily appeared on his face—not because of their rankings, but because the list revealed over a thousand different Dao Academies.

"Over a thousand countries similar to Nanli in scale... and Nanli alone is already comparable in size to the largest nations from my previous life. There must be even more academies without disciples on this list!"

"What about the Upper Realm?"

"Just how vast is this world?"

**Luodu Island, West Cave Residence No. 23**

The location was usually remote and seldom visited, but today was completely different.

Hundreds of figures in cyan robes stood neatly in the open space before the cave residence, their excited chatter unceasing. Despite waiting for several hours, not a single person showed impatience—only eager anticipation burned in their eyes.

At the forefront stood six team captains led by Senior Brother Li, all waiting quietly with expectant gazes. Behind them were dozens of team officers, including Zhang Yangchu and the familiar Senior Brother Yan.

Beside Senior Brother Li lounged an enormous white deer.

"I heard Senior Brother Zhang Jing dominated numerous inner court seniors in some secret realm—utterly unstoppable! Truly worthy of being Thousand Methods Pavilion's designated chief disciple!"

"More than that! I heard he suppressed over 800 inner court seniors from three Dao Academies!"

"Wait, wasn't it 1,300 inner court seniors?"

"They say Senior Brother is extremely handsome too."

"Does Senior Brother Zhang have a Dao companion?"

The murmurs reached Deer Thirty-Eight's ears like the buzzing of countless bees, yet the noise didn't irritate it at all. Every word praised its master, and though it didn't fully understand the details, one thing was clear: its master had accomplished something monumental.

Some even claimed he would become the future top disciple of the inner court!

At this thought, Deer Thirty-Eight happily narrowed its eyes. Having spent so long at the Dao Academy, it had grown into a deer of some sophistication. It understood what the inner court represented—those lofty immortals who could redirect rivers and move mountains with a thought.

And its master would one day lead these powerful beings.

As the master's foremost deer attendant, how magnificent would its future be?

Deer Thirty-Eight felt profoundly grateful for its brilliant decision to beg becoming the master's mount, and even more proud of that inspired kneel.

That single kneel had secured it a glorious future and brought honor to its ancestors!

As time passed, a bright rainbow light streaked across the sky with imposing momentum before suddenly halting above the crowd and descending gracefully.

When the light dissipated, it revealed Zhang Jing's purple-robed figure.

The crowd fell silent, countless astonished gazes raining upon him.

Purple robes—the mark of the inner court!

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing, welcome back to Luodu Island." Senior Brother Li's expression froze momentarily before he quickly composed himself and stepped forward respectfully.

He'd originally intended to say "welcome home," but the purple robes representing inner court status made those words impossible to voice. The hierarchy had changed.

Soon, the others followed suit in unison: "Welcome Senior Brother Zhang Jing back to Luodu Island!" Their voices shook the heavens.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but feel awkward at such a grand reception—quite contrary to his usual low-profile style.

Shaking his head, he spoke gently, his voice like a spring breeze to all listeners: "No need for formalities, junior brothers."

This time, Zhang Jing didn't insist on calling them "senior brothers." Now, his words and actions represented the inner court.

As time passed, the Luodu team members gradually dispersed, each wearing expressions of shared pride. They all sensed a powerful premonition: the day their team would dominate the outer court wasn't far off.

"Senior Brother Zhang, does your return mean you'll be leaving Luodu Island?" Senior Brother Li asked thoughtfully.

Zhang Jing nodded with a smile. "Indeed. The academy has assigned a dedicated cultivation island according to tradition—near Senior Brother You's island. If you ever need anything, you can find me there."

Senior Brother Li's eyes brightened, and he bowed deeply. "On behalf of all Luodu team members, I thank you for your care."

He wasn't naive—he understood both the meaning and weight behind Zhang Jing's words. From now on, their greatest backer would be this future "Dragon Lake Chief Disciple."

"Think nothing of it. The Luodu team has done me great kindness—this is only right," Zhang Jing replied warmly.

"Senior Brother, I have one more presumptuous request..." Senior Brother Li suddenly looked embarrassed.

"Speak freely. Between us, no need for such formality."

"I wish to name your current cave residence after you and keep it permanently open for outer court disciples to visit and admire." He glanced nervously at Zhang Jing.

"It belongs to the Luodu team—do as you see fit." Zhang Jing waved dismissively. He understood the underlying motive but didn't mind.

"Th-thank you for this generosity!" Senior Brother Li stammered, overwhelmed. He hadn't expected such an indulgent response to his bold request.

Only after Senior Brother Li left did Deer Thirty-Eight stand up, its large eyes brimming with excitement.

"Master, master! You have an entire immortal island now? Can I grow spirit herbs there?"

A faint smile touched Zhang Jing's eyes. "Of course. If you want little doe companions, I might even consider that."

The deer nodded eagerly, then shook its head violently. "No does! Absolutely not! The island must be huge—I can't watch everywhere at once. What if a sneaky doe eats my herbs when I'm not looking? No way! Never!"

"You—" Zhang Jing massaged his temples. "Never mind. Go pack—we're moving to the island today."
