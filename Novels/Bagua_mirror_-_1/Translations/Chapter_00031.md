# Chapter 31: Seizing the Spot  

Over the past few months, news about the Qingxuan Sect had spread widely, and many cultivators had become aware of the situation. The Canglong Valley no longer made any effort to conceal the matter, allowing rumors to circulate freely.  

There were whispers that the Qingxuan Sect had spent a fortune recruiting numerous Qi Refining rogue cultivators and had specially bred a large number of Earth Armor Beasts to tunnel directly into the underground spirit vein from the other side of the Cangwu Mountain.  

Since then, they had been racing against the Canglong Valley cultivators to plunder the spirit stone resources. Naturally, members of both sides occasionally crossed paths.  

However, outright conflicts were rare. After all, the miners weren't formal disciples of either the Qingxuan Sect or Canglong Valley, so there was little reason to fight to the death over meager monthly wages.  

Over time, an unspoken understanding had formed among them—each side minded their own business, digging where they pleased. As long as the other party didn't strike first, they pretended not to see each other.  

The real clashes occurred between Canglong Valley's patrol teams and Qingxuan Sect infiltrators. The patrols would never let Qingxuan disciples go unless they surrendered all their spirit stones. Some were even robbed clean just to keep their lives, though a few were killed outright.  

Eventually, the Qingxuan Sect also began sending their own disciples into the veins. So far, three underground skirmishes had broken out between the two factions, with casualties on both sides.  

Qin Chong's three-man team had been fortunate so far, encountering no Qingxuan cultivators during their mining operations.  

Working as a trio was safer and more efficient, but it also meant they had to search for new mining spots more frequently—a time-consuming task.  

"Brother Song, we seem pretty far from the main tunnel now," Qin Chong remarked.  

"Can't be helped," Song Jinpeng sighed. "It's hard to find decent spots nearby these days. Even if we stumble upon one or two, they're too small to sustain the three of us for more than a few days."  

"Fair point. Let's just hope we don't run into Qingxuan cultivators."  

"Ugh! Don't jinx it!" Song Jinpeng scowled.  

Qin Chong rolled his eyes. "Brother Song, is Liao mute? We've been teamed up for months, and I've never heard him speak."  

Now it was Song Jinpeng's turn to roll his eyes.  

"N-Not mute," came a deep, resonant voice.  

Liao Xiong had spoken.  

"Ah, not mute—just a stutterer," Qin Chong teased.  

The moment the words left his mouth, a tremendous force slammed into his chest, sending him flying several zhang backward. Though unharmed, the sheer power behind the blow left him stunned.  

Liao Xiong had struck out in anger, roaring at Qin Chong.  

"Hahaha! Serves you right!" Song Jinpeng cackled.  

What shocked Qin Chong most was that Liao Xiong hadn't used any spiritual energy—his raw physical strength alone had sent Qin Chong flying. Still, he knew Liao Xiong had held back; otherwise, the blow would have seriously injured him.  

After months of working together, the three had grown close. Joking around had become routine. Both Song Jinpeng and Liao Xiong were rogue cultivators, and they never looked down on Qin Chong for his lower cultivation level.  

In fact, they often went out of their way to help him. In the ruthless world of cultivation, their kindness was a rare warmth.  

Regaining his footing, Qin Chong caught up and gave Liao Xiong a thumbs-up.  

"Brother Song, is Liao a body cultivator? That strength is insane. If he hadn't held back, I'd be in bad shape."  

"Body cultivator? Nah, he's just naturally strong and practices an earth-attribute technique that enhances his physique a bit."  

"Ah, I see. It's a shame he doesn't train in body cultivation."  

"Tell me about it. But where would we even find body cultivation manuals? In the entire Yan Province, there are barely any body cultivators, and the techniques are vanishingly rare. Guys like us have no chance of getting one."  

Qin Chong reached up and patted Liao Xiong's shoulder. "Brother Liao, if I ever get my hands on a body cultivation manual, I'll make sure to share it with you."  

Liao Xiong's eyes lit up, and he nodded emphatically.  

Suddenly, Song Jinpeng raised a hand for silence and stopped walking.  

"Found a mining spot, but it's already taken," he transmitted to Qin Chong.  

"How many?" Qin Chong asked. Though confident in his spiritual sense, he refrained from probing to avoid alerting the other party.  

"Just one, at the seventh layer of Qi Refining."  

"One of ours?"  

"Not sure."  

"Then let's check it out."  

"Right. Doesn't matter who it is—we'll take it. Even if it's one of ours, they might just think we're from Qingxuan."  

"But what if they call the patrols?"  

"Who cares? We won't actually fight—just scare them off. If patrols show up, we'll say it was a misunderstanding."  

"Wow, that's a shamelessly shameless plan."  

The three quickened their pace. By the time the lone miner noticed their approach, they were already upon him.  

"Scram!" Song Jinpeng barked, while Liao Xiong snarled menacingly.  

Faced with two cultivators of the same level—and one extra at the third layer of Qi Refining (though Qin Chong suspected the miner barely registered him)—the stranger hesitated only briefly before turning tail. Still, he shot them a venomous glare before vanishing.  

Once he was gone, Song Jinpeng grinned. "Let's get to work. This spot's big enough to keep us busy for a while."  

"Even though he took some, there's plenty left," Qin Chong agreed.  

Soon, the rhythmic clinking of picks filled the tunnel.  

"Brother Song, do you have any defensive formations?" Qin Chong asked suddenly.  

"Why?"  

"If that guy was from Qingxuan, he might come back with reinforcements. We should prepare."  

"Good point. I've got a basic Golden Aegis Formation. It's nothing fancy, but it'll buy us time."  

"There's only one main entrance here. We can block it and use those two smaller side tunnels as escape routes."  

"Clever. You're full of sneaky ideas."  

As Song Jinpeng set up the formation, Qin Chong and Liao Xiong continued mining.  

Though Qin Chong didn't know many of Canglong Valley's miners personally, he recognized most from turning in spirit stones. The stranger earlier had been unfamiliar, which made him suspicious.
