# Chapter 58: Ambush on the Journey  

After the Yellow Immortal Master took his leave, Lin Shan took out his Cold Iron Sword and began refining it with focused dedication.  

Refinement could be divided into blood refinement and soul refinement. Blood refinement enhanced the sword's power and compatibility with the wielder's body, while soul refinement improved the precision of spiritual control. Both methods had their pros and cons, and choosing either was acceptable.  

Naturally, Lin Shan opted for soul refinement. The advantage was that it allowed for more precise control when releasing sword energy, making it harder for other cultivators with strong spiritual senses to wrest control of the weapon during battle.  

At the Qi Refining stage, spiritual sense couldn't extend beyond the body, so Lin Shan could only wield the sword in close combat. Only after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, when spiritual sense could be projected outward, would he be able to manipulate the sword remotely—launching flying sword attacks or even riding the sword through the skies.  

...  

Three days later, after nearly completing the refinement of the Cold Iron Sword, Lin Shan left the headquarters to explore the capital in search of ancient artifacts that might contain traces of ancient aura.  

He first wandered through the antique market, only to find that most items were fakes, with not a hint of ancient aura to be found.  

Frustrated, Lin Shan asked a few vendors if they had ever seen anything like the Black Lotus Buddha statues. In his experience, artifacts associated with faith and worship were more likely to contain the aura he sought.  

To his surprise, one vendor mentioned having seen such statues long ago.  

However, a year prior, the Great Song Dynasty had issued a nationwide decree to suppress the Black Lotus Sect. All Black Lotus Buddha statues were to be destroyed, and anyone caught worshipping them would be severely punished.  

Lin Shan was stunned.  

He had originally planned to exploit the Black Lotus Sect after benefiting from the Nightingale Organization, but now, with the crackdown in full force, the statues had all been destroyed! This was undoubtedly orchestrated by the immortal sect behind Lei Zhenzi.  

As for seeking out members of the Black Lotus Sect directly?  

Lin Shan wasn’t reckless enough for that—at least not yet.  

The Black Lotus Envoy he had encountered in the Ancient Tomb of Yelang had wielded a high-grade soul wood fish, a magical artifact capable of contending with Lei Zhenzi. That envoy was at least at the Foundation Establishment stage—and he was merely an underling!  

Who knew how many elders, saints, or even a sect leader might lurk above him? Venturing into their territory as a mere Qi Refining cultivator would be suicidal.  

With no other options, Lin Shan turned to antique shops.  

But even there, he found no artifacts with ancient aura.  

Growing impatient, he pulled the shopkeeper aside and asked if there were any antiques with rich cultural significance or long histories.  

The shopkeeper was honest. He patiently explained that the Great Song capital was home to numerous powerful figures, including over a dozen princes. Any centuries-old paintings or calligraphy of note had long been purchased and treasured by the elite—why would they remain in the market?  

Moreover, half of such treasures in the Great Song were destined for the imperial palace.  

Lin Shan finally understood. He had been naive. In his previous life, museums had been full of antiques, so he had assumed they would be easy to find.  

But in this world, where the strong preyed on the weak, valuable antiques were inevitably in the hands of the powerful. The common folk rarely had access to them.  

This left Lin Shan in a dilemma.  

The imperial palace? He didn’t dare go there—it was guarded by Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

The mansions of princes? Most had their own immortal cultivators as retainers. The moment he stepped inside, they would sense his presence.  

If a fight broke out, the capital was small enough that every cultivator had their own network. Provoking one could draw an entire group, and that would spell trouble.  

*If only I were at the Foundation Establishment stage,* Lin Shan thought bitterly. *Then I could simply demand what I wanted—who would dare refuse me?*  

*Once I reach Yichuan, I must focus on improving my strength. These antiques aren’t going anywhere—I’ll come back for them eventually.*  

With that resolve, the only consolation was the Nightingale Organization, which still held untapped potential.  

In six months, when the Nightingale tokens from across the Great Song were gathered, he would surely reap a substantial harvest of ancient aura.  

With that in mind, Lin Shan returned to the Nightingale headquarters at the Marquis of Bowang’s estate and ceased his wanderings.  

He devoted himself to cultivation, quietly awaiting the journey to Yichuan.  

...  

Ten days later, Lin Shan and the Yellow Immortal Master arrived at the northern outskirts of the city, where they met up with the black-robed Daoist nun and the other four members of their group.  

The six of them boarded a carriage, blending into a merchant caravan for their departure.  

The carriage and caravan had been arranged by the woman in the bamboo hat, a Qi Refining early-stage cultivator who had introduced herself as the daughter of the Duke of Qi. Given her noble status, such arrangements were trivial for her.  

Before leaving, the Grand Elder of the Nightingale Organization had gathered all the capital’s Nightingale tokens for Lin Shan, yielding three points of ancient aura. Lin Shan expressed his gratitude, and the Grand Elder presented him with an elder’s token, stating that it could be used to mobilize Nightingale forces if needed in the future.  

Lin Shan accepted it. Though he no longer planned to linger in the mortal world, it might prove useful someday.  

As for Protector Jiang, Lin Shan had glanced at him before leaving. The man had recently become an elder of the organization and was now embroiled in power struggles with his old rival. Without the Yellow Immortal Master’s support, the two were evenly matched.  

Lin Shan chuckled to himself. By removing the Yellow Immortal Master from the equation, he had already repaid any debt he owed Protector Jiang. There was no need for further involvement.  

...  

The journey to Yichuan spanned thousands of miles.  

The Great Song Dynasty was vast, with the Luosong Mountain Range running north-south, dividing the country into eastern and western regions.  

The capital, Bianliang, lay west of the Luosong Mountains.  

The merchant caravan followed the route eastward through Dongmenguan before turning north toward Daming Prefecture. After more than ten days of travel, they finally arrived at the foot of the Yanyun Mountain Range in the northeast.  

...  

The six abandoned their carriage and ventured into the mountain trails.  

Ahead lay over a thousand miles of dense forest, with some areas inhabited by demonic beasts—or worse, cultivators lying in ambush, ready to rob and kill.  

The mountain path was rugged, winding beneath towering ancient trees that pierced the sky like swords. Dappled sunlight filtered through the leaves, swaying with the breeze.  

Despite the treacherous terrain, the six maintained a lively conversation, their camaraderie superficial at best.  

Through their discussions, Lin Shan learned more about the Yanyun region.  

The Yanyun Mountain Range served as the northern border of the Great Song, stretching for thousands of miles. Beyond it lay the Great Yan Dynasty.  

Since the Yichuan Market was situated at the border between the two nations, cultivators from both sides frequented it, leading to frequent conflicts in the area.  

As they traveled, the group subtly split into factions:  

Lin Shan and the Yellow Immortal Master stayed close, while the black-robed Daoist nun and the bamboo-hatted woman walked together. The remaining two—the green-robed elder and the hook-nosed man—kept to themselves.  

...  

After two days of arduous travel, the six followed a mountain stream, its banks lined with dense foliage. The babbling water and birdsong lent a serene charm to the journey.  

For cultivators, traversing such terrain was effortless, and they remained in high spirits.  

As Lin Shan cupped water from the stream to wash his face, he caught a reflection in the water—streaks of blue arrows streaking through the sky.  

His pupils contracted.  

In an instant, dozens of watery arrows shot from the trees across the stream, hurtling toward them!  

*"Water Arrow Technique!"*  

*"Ambush—cultivators!"*  

*"Scatter!"*  

Shouts erupted behind him. Lin Shan dodged to the side, using Wind Blade Technique to deflect the arrows he couldn’t avoid.  

Then, the ground beneath his feet softened, a sucking force threatening to pull him under.  

Lin Shan glanced down—the soil by the stream was turning to quicksand.  

*"Quicksand Technique!"*  

*"Earth cultivators in hiding!"*  

*"Spread out!"*  

Lin Shan leaped onto a large boulder in the stream. But the attacks didn’t stop—more spells rained from the trees.  

*Ice Spike Technique!*  

A third ambusher had revealed themselves.  

Simultaneously, from the opposite side of the forest, more spells erupted—Quicksand, Earth Spike, Fireball, Vine Entanglement—forcing the group into frantic defense.  

In the chaos, no one could spare attention for anything else.
