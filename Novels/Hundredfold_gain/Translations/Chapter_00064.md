# Chapter 64: The Vacant True Disciple Seat and the Frostscale Dragon Carp  

"Have you heard? Half a month ago, Yun Qingyue, the top-ranked True Disciple of our Fengyue Sect's Twelve True Disciples, successfully advanced to Foundation Establishment and has been promoted to an elder of our sect!"  

"What's so surprising about that? As the foremost True Disciple, wasn't her breakthrough to Foundation Establishment practically guaranteed?"  

"Did you forget? With Yun Qingyue's promotion, there's now a vacancy among the Twelve True Disciples. The True Disciple Selection Ceremony will likely begin soon!"  

"True Disciple Selection! Does that mean all inner disciples have a chance now?"  

"Well, yes—but what does that have to do with you? Have you even reached the seventh level of Qi Refinement? The minimum requirement for participation is late-stage Qi Refinement!"  

"Uh... not yet. But even with the vacancy, the selection might not happen immediately. It usually takes about two years. Maybe I still have a chance..."  

"Dream on. You've been stuck at the peak of the sixth level for over a year without any progress. Even with two more years, do you really think you'll break through?"  

"..."  

The next day, Qi Chuan arrived at the Inner Sect Mission Hall. Just as he was about to enter, he overheard two inner disciples conversing nearby.  

"A vacancy among the True Disciples?"  

The news caught Qi Chuan's attention. He wasn't particularly interested in whether Yun Qingyue remained a True Disciple or became an elder, but the vacancy intrigued him—because only True Disciples had access to Foundation Establishment Pills.  

"Just after breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement, I hear this news..."  

"To participate in the True Disciple Selection, one needs at least the seventh level of Qi Refinement. But if the selection is delayed by two years, can I make another breakthrough in that time?"  

"It should be possible..."  

A glimmer of anticipation flickered in Qi Chuan's eyes.  

Based on his experience advancing from early to mid-stage Qi Refinement in Red Maple Valley, he wasn't worried about reaching the seventh level. All he needed was time to refine his spiritual energy from his current early sixth-level state to the peak of the sixth level.  

With the help of his golden finger—which amplified his efforts a hundredfold—and the aid of Gathering Essence Pills, he estimated it would take about a year to reach the peak of the sixth level.  

As for the bottleneck between mid and late-stage Qi Refinement, his previous breakthrough from early to mid-stage had only taken three months. Even if the late-stage bottleneck was more challenging, five or six months should suffice—possibly even less.  

By that calculation, after reaching the seventh level, he would still have over half a year to prepare for the True Disciple Selection.  

Given his array of abilities, as long as he could participate, his chances of securing a True Disciple seat were reasonably high.  

"Even if I fail, there's no harm in trying. If it doesn't work out, I can always wait for the next opportunity. As long as I keep making steady progress, I'll get there eventually."  

Qi Chuan wasn't fixated on becoming a True Disciple this time. He simply wanted to test the waters—who knew? He might succeed.  

Even if he didn't, given his current cultivation level and abilities at his age, he had plenty of time for future attempts.  

It wasn't as if Yun Qingyue's promotion would be the last in decades. Foundation Establishment wasn't as rare as Core Formation, after all.  

With these thoughts in mind, Qi Chuan stepped into the Mission Hall.  

He hadn't taken on any inner sect missions for a while, having focused on breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement. Now, with the annual quota deadline approaching, he decided to pick a simple task to fulfill the requirement.  

As he entered, he scanned the mission listings displayed on the four jade walls.  

The hall buzzed with activity as other inner disciples discussed recent events—Yun Qingyue's promotion, the vacant True Disciple seat, and the upcoming selection.  

"This mission seems decent..."  

Qi Chuan's gaze settled on a task listed on the eastern jade wall:  

**[Hunt mid-rank first-grade Frostscale Spirit Carp in the Profound Ice River dozens of miles away. Retrieve the 'dragon scale' located three inches behind its gills. Each scale rewards five inner sect contribution points.]**  

The Profound Ice River was said to have formed over an underground vein of Profound Ice, leaving its surface perpetually frozen. Beneath the thick ice, the water was unnaturally cold—a unique environment.  

However, the spiritual energy concentration was only at the lower first-grade level, making it largely worthless. Only in the deepest parts of certain river sections did the energy reach mid first-grade.  

Additionally, the spiritual energy carried a trace of Profound Cold Qi, which could negatively affect ordinary Qi Refinement cultivators. In that regard, it was even less useful than a standard lower first-grade spiritual vein.  

It was only beneficial to those who cultivated cold-attribute techniques—a rarity among early and mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Foundation Establishment experts, even if interested in the Profound Cold Qi, would disdain the low-grade spiritual energy.  

Since the river belonged to the Fengyue Sect and no other factions had claimed it, the area remained largely uninhabited.  

Yet beneath the ice, the frigid waters teemed with lower and mid-rank first-grade cold-attribute demonic beasts.  

The current mission required hunting mid-rank first-grade Frostscale Spirit Carp—also known as Frostscale Dragon Carp.  

These carp possessed a faint trace of flood dragon bloodline. Each mid-rank first-grade specimen grew a unique purple-gold scale three inches behind its gills, which could be used in artifact forging or pill refining. Due to its high value, cultivators jokingly referred to it as a "dragon scale," though it bore little resemblance to the real thing.  

"Most of the demonic beasts in the Profound Ice River, including the Frostscale Dragon Carp, are cold-attribute. My fireball technique, far surpassing the ordinary Great Achievement level, should counter them effectively. This mission shouldn't pose any problems."  

Qi Chuan's fireball technique had long since reached Great Achievement and was nearing Perfection.  

An ordinary Great Achievement fireball was already a formidable technique among late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators—let alone his enhanced version.  

With his sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivation and a physique rivaling top-tier mid-grade artifacts, he had nothing to fear. After all, Frostscale Dragon Carp were typically only as strong as fifth or sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivators.  

He had avoided sect missions because they were too time-consuming. An external mission like this, which posed little danger, was far more appealing.  

*Swish!*  

With that thought, Qi Chuan activated his inner disciple token. A beam of light shot out, marking the mission as accepted.
