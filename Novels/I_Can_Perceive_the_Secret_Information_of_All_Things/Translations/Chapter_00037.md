# Chapter 37: Dust Settles

The trap had been set, waiting only for its prey.

The headless steward's corpse lay in the rearmost courtyard of the Cui residence, guarded by patrolling constables through the night.

Before the hour of Yin arrived, Coroner Wang Dajiu appeared with a lantern in hand.

He swaggered into the Cui compound unchallenged—the guards on duty recognized him and even greeted him politely upon seeing his face.

Upon hearing that the Cui family's steward had undergone corpse transformation and returned to slaughter his former household, Wang Dajiu grew anxious. After consulting with Han Kaishan, he came specifically to retrieve the object hidden within the corpse's belly.

If the yamen officials discovered it first, the item would be lost—and without it, Han Kaishan would never give Wang Dajiu the Life-Extending Heart Elixir he desperately needed. To prolong his life, Wang Dajiu had to deliver the hidden object to Han Kaishan.

When Chang Ping saw Wang Dajiu arrive as predicted, he couldn't help but admire Xiao Ji's foresight—the young man's guess had been uncannily accurate.

"Coroner Wang, what brings you here so late?" Chang Ping inquired.

"Word reached me about the corpse transformation at the Cui residence. I came to examine it—perhaps I'll find more clues. I suspect this steward might be the key to solving both the Kaishan Escort Agency and Cui family murder cases," Wang Dajiu explained smoothly.

"Then let me accompany you," Chang Ping offered deliberately.

"No need, Constable Chang. If you'd be so kind, just guard the door to prevent interruptions. Examining a transformed corpse requires complete focus—I can't afford distractions," Wang Dajiu replied with his usual professional demeanor, showing no signs of nervousness.

Chang Ping agreed to stand guard. The two men passed through several moon gates, crossed the rear garden, and arrived at the courtyard where the corpse was stored.

Once inside, Wang Dajiu quickly scanned the room to confirm they were alone. He placed his lantern on the octagonal table for illumination, covered his nose and mouth with cloth, then produced a sharp blade from his sleeve. With practiced ease, he sliced open the half-inch stitched wound on the corpse's side.

The blackened intestines emitted a foul stench. Squinting against the odor, Wang Dajiu gritted his teeth and reached into the wound, soon retrieving a small rolled object. After wiping it hastily with his face covering, he concealed the item on his person.

Exiting the room, he exchanged a few meaningless pleasantries with Chang Ping before preparing to leave the Cui residence.

Everything had gone perfectly.

Only after he secretly met Han Kaishan, delivered the object, and received his promised Life-Extending Heart Elixir did Wang Dajiu realize something had gone terribly wrong.

As he stepped outside, Wang Dajiu froze. The previously empty courtyard now held seven or eight people—fellow yamen officers, along with constables and a Daoist priest from Willow Town.

"Coroner Wang, working quite late tonight," Chang Ping said, his voice tinged with disappointment.

"What do you mean by this, Constable Chang?" Wang Dajiu feigned composure.

"Let's discuss this inside," Chang Ping gestured politely.

Several men entered the room while others guarded the door. Though still weak from his injuries, Han Kaishan's eyes flickered with a mix of excitement, anxiety, and dread.

Before Han Kaishan could speak, Xiao Ji—shedding his previous absentminded demeanor—launched into an explanation:

"Cui Dubo commissioned Han Kaishan to secretly transport a family heirloom called the Fortune-Shifting Koi Embroidery to the capital, Dragon City, because an organization called the Life-Death Gate coveted it... Han Kaishan wanted to steal it for himself while avoiding suspicion, so he orchestrated the massacre of his own escort agency."

"And you were his accomplice," Xiao Ji continued, pointing at Wang Dajiu. "You helped Han Kaishan cover his tracks. Even though he used a sword for the killings, an experienced coroner like you could easily identify his distinctive blade marks in the wounds. Yet you—"

"Preposterous!" Wang Dajiu interrupted angrily. "Han Kaishan and I have been acquaintances for years! I came tonight simply to check on his injuries, concerned he might do something rash... Besides, all the victims died from sword wounds—any coroner could verify that!"

"You altered all the corpses—that's why examination proved difficult. But some evidence can't be hidden," Xiao Ji countered. "The item you retrieved from the Cui steward's belly tonight, the poison residue in the escort agency's dry well, even a single thread under a victim's fingernail that you overlooked..."

"This Daoist speaks nonsense," Han Kaishan interjected, sweat beading on his forehead as he sensed the situation deteriorating.

Xiao Ji described the crime with eyewitness precision—every moment, every action, from Han Kaishan's first greedy impulse upon meeting Cui Dubo, to his deal with Wang Dajiu, the poisonings, murders, feigned suicide to avoid the Life-Death Gate's attention... Wang Dajiu receiving the Life-Extending Heart Elixir, killing Cui Dubo and the steward, hiding the treasure inside a corpse buried in the paupers' graveyard...

The Daoist's account matched reality so perfectly that Wang Dajiu and Han Kaishan wondered if he'd been invisibly present during their plotting. How else could he know such details—even how many sips of tea they'd taken?

Their denials crumbled completely when Xiao Ji produced the Cui family heirloom—the Fortune-Shifting Koi Embroidery—from beneath Han Kaishan's bed and presented it to the assembled officers.

"Honestly, when I'm in a hurry, I also tend to hide things under the bed," Xiao Ji remarked. "It's quite effective."

"This—this must have been planted here! Someone is framing me!" Han Kaishan's voice cracked with panic.

Ignoring him, Xiao Ji turned to Wang Dajiu and retrieved the Life-Extending Heart Elixir from his person. "The Life-Extending Heart Elixir—a forbidden drug. Its creation is unbearably cruel, requiring eighty-one living human hearts to produce a single pill."

Constable Chang Ping took the pill, aghast. He looked at his longtime colleague with a mixture of fury and sorrow. "Why? Why would you do this?"

"Why?" Wang Dajiu, seeing all was lost without his precious elixir—knowing he'd be sent to the Demon-Suppression Bureau for involvement with forbidden arts—answered bitterly: "Because I wanted to live longer... I was born to be a coroner, toiling in the yamen since my teens, surrounded by death every day. I've seen more corpses than living souls."

"I consulted a fortune-teller once—a Buddhist monk."

"He said I had remarkably strong vitality, but chose the wrong profession. In an ordinary life, I might have lived to one hundred thirty-nine. But as a coroner, steeped in death's energy and resentment, my lifespan would end at fifty-nine."

"That monk told me my death date, and I've been counting down ever since."

"Then I learned of this life-extending elixir... so I sought Han Kaishan's help..."

With their crimes exposed, further resistance proved pointless. Both men fell silent, resigned to their fate.

Han Kaishan despaired. He'd believed his scheme flawless—that no one would suspect his true motives. Yet everything had unraveled.

The treasure had been in his grasp, promising a path to cultivation through the secrets hidden in the embroidery. Now that dream evaporated.

His perfect plan—diverting the Life-Death Gate's suspicion, obscuring the murderer's identity, evading yamen investigation, safely concealing the treasure—had required only time to become an unsolvable cold case. Once public attention faded, he could have retrieved the embroidery, eliminated Wang Dajiu with the remaining elixir doses, and begun his cultivation journey in secret.

But everything had been ruined by this damned Daoist.

Neither man was some common thug. Facing the inevitable, they cooperated with the yamen's interrogation.

What should have been an unsolvable mystery was cracked within days thanks to outside assistance from Willow Town.

Chang Ping, impressed and envious of Song Yuanbao's good fortune in having such a talented Daoist, made an offer: "If the Primordial Spirit Temple ever considers relocating, our Auspicious Cloud Town would provide land free of charge."

"Can you even make that decision?" Song Yuanbao retorted protectively.

Before Chang Ping could respond, Xiao Ji politely declined, then asked a practical question: "For assisting with this case... would I receive a reward?"
