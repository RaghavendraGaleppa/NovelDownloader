**Chapter 251: The Exchange Meeting**

Slightly drunk Yuque covered its mouth with a tiny wing, but it was too late; the old case was busted open today. The purple-haired girl nearly hurled the crystal wine cup in her hand, her languid posture instantly gone as her beautiful eyes widened. How could she forget the so-called "solitary rider leveling Golden Rooster Ridge"? Because she was the mount in question. In a sense, she was also a protagonist, one of only two participants that night. That night, one went on a wild rampage, while the other struggled onward under a heavy burden. Every time she thought of that night, she was filled with immense shame and fury. To think that she, a direct descendant of the dignified Purple Lightning Ancestor Master, had suffered such a humiliating ordeal.

What drove her most insane was that later, outside Vermillion Cloud City, she had just finished bathing when she was "conscripted" and became a mount for the second time. The most crucial part was that this person eventually revealed himself to be that very individual from before. For a long time, the purple-haired girl lost her appetite and couldn't sleep, constantly wanting to drag out that scoundrel and take revenge.

Yuque tossed aside its tiny wine cup and quickly advised, "Princess, calm down. You need to consider the occasion. Everyone here is an Immortal Scion, Divine Scion, Ghostly Scion, and so on, from various Paths—all with significant backgrounds. Don't cause a scene here."

The purple-haired girl abruptly snatched it up, her expression furious, her pretty face filled with indignation. This fellow had known the truth all along and dared to hide it from her!

"Princess, that hurts! Please put me down first. It wouldn't be good to attract attention," Yuque hiccuped.

"What's so bad about it?" The ruffled purple-haired girl stood up, ready to settle scores with Qin Ming.

Yuque said, "Princess, you wouldn't want what happened that night to become common knowledge, would you?"

The purple-clothed girl froze. Why did that sound so suggestive and outrageous?! Immediately, she wanted to just crush this bird to death!

Yuque quickly gestured, signaling her to look around; curious gazes were indeed drifting their way. "Let's make a long-term plan; we can't cause a ruckus here," Yuque further dissuaded her, then whispered, "Perhaps it's not a bad thing. You could talk to him."

Qin Ming stood with Xiang Yiwu, engaged in a rather congenial conversation. Suddenly, he felt a chill down his spine. Turning around, he saw the purple-haired girl staring intensely at him. Qin Ming offered a slight smile, took a glass of wine from a nearby attendant's tray, gestured to her, and then took a sip.

The purple-haired girl had just managed to steady herself, only to see him raise his glass across the distance, nearly causing her to lose her composure again. Her lustrous purple hair seemed to float without a breeze.

Yuque said, "Princess, look, he's a really good person, polite and quite the gentleman."

"You're his spy, aren't you, planted by his side!"

Yuque, ever the opportunist, replied, "Princess, you misunderstand. He doesn't recognize you at all right now. This is a chance encounter; you can completely take advantage of it!"

How could Qin Ming not recognize her? He had seen her transform in the Divine City of the Great Blue Centipede. However, at present, he thought it best to feign ignorance.

...

Inside the vast palace built of lapis lazuli, crystal lamps refracted dazzling colors. Many people had come by invitation, gathering in small groups of three to five, conversing. Qin Ming spotted many acquaintances, such as Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, and Ling Yu, who all came over to greet him warmly. Amidst clinking glasses, the atmosphere was harmonious.

"Brother Qin, you are truly formidable! The battle on the plateau truly raised a banner for the young disciples of the New Life Path, sweeping away the previous decline," Ling Yu praised. He cultivated both paths, and Qin Ming's achievements on the New Life Path now filled him with utter admiration; he was completely convinced. Previously, he had entertained thoughts of sparring with Qin Ming again once he advanced further, but now he saw there was no need to compare at all.

Qin Ming smiled, "We're all on the same side, no need for so many compliments."

Xin Youdao, who knew more, thought to himself, 'Back in the Secret Realm, "Qin Yao Yi" had already consecutively defeated Immortal Scions, even giving Old Cao a good beating!' If that were to be exposed, Kunling City would surely erupt in a frenzy. He believed that any astonishing performance from such a person in the future would not be surprising.

"Qin Ming!" Zhao Yaoting, a Divine Scion from the Esoteric Sect, approached, holding a crystal cup. He smiled, lightly clinked his cup against Qin Ming's, and asked, "On the Vermillion Bird airship that day, how did you suddenly disappear?"

Qin Ming had a good impression of him. He sighed, "I accidentally fell out of the sky and barely survived."

Cai Jingcheng, another Divine Scion from the Esoteric Sect who had also been on the Vermillion Bird airship, walked over. He spoke, "When you disappeared that day, you gave us quite a scare. It's good that you're alright. When we first met, we didn't know your background, but now that we meet again, you're already famous throughout Kunling. Many people are saying you're the future Ancestor Master of the New Life Path."

Qin Ming shook his head, "This is flattery that could be detrimental. You shouldn't say such things often. For us New Path cultivators, from the Second Realm onwards, we must slow our pace. The path is arduous and challenging; it all depends on enduring through the years."

Zhao Yaoting said, "You are too modest. There are always a few exceptions. I feel that you won't be constrained by time, and you'll be able to break through quickly, surprising your peers from other paths who will find themselves unable to shake you off."

Immediately, many nearby individuals looked over. Many knew that Qin Ming was not afraid of those at the same level as him at this stage. However, his future path was exceptionally difficult, and from now on, his slow cultivation speed would torment him for centuries.

"Is this the esteemed disciple of the Tathagata?" Cai Jingcheng changed the topic.

"Just a humble abandoned disciple," Xiang Yiwu said. With his incredibly large and formidable physique, he would draw attention wherever he stood.

Those nearby were surprised. Were these two heaven-defying prodigies of the New Life Path truly so low-key? One must know that just two days prior, the Ancestor Masters of the New Life Path had been hotter-blooded, wilder, and more volatile than the last, beating Cao Qianqiu so badly he was called 'Cao Four'. Everyone sighed, marveling at how these two generations seemed to have reversed roles. Among those on the New Life Path, the young were as steady as old dogs, while the old were "full of youthful vigor," their hot blood unquenchable!

In the distance, Zheng Maoze's expression was complex. He had pulled strings to secure an invitation and successfully entered the venue. Seeing Qin Ming standing alongside Divine Scions and Immortal Scions, he could only sigh, his heart restless. "This is his peak moment, being able to stand shoulder to shoulder with Immortal and Divine Scions. Soon, he will be rapidly left behind; his cultivation speed won't keep up!" This thought was not Zheng Maoze's alone; it was shared by others, with ninety percent of the attendees holding the same belief.

Further away, Cui Chong stood with several top inheritors from the Ancient Immortal Daoist Temple. He cast a casual glance this way, unconcerned. His belief was strong, unwavering, and unshakable. In his eyes, his peers on the New Life Path—whether that discarded pawn or someone even more outstanding who might appear in the future—could only gaze at his back from afar until they saw nothing at all.

On the other side, Li Qingxu spoke little. Compared to before, he was much more subdued, and in the eyes of many, he seemed somewhat disheartened. Beside him, Sun Jingxiao, an Immortal Scion also from the Pure Land, consoled him, "Junior Brother Li, there's no need to dwell on it. It was merely a 'virtual defeat'. The so-called strong enemies on the New Life Path are, at most, fleeting scenery on your long Immortal Path—passersby unworthy of your concern. Once you step into the Third Realm, you will have no further intersection with him. In the future, you will both be people of two different worlds." Then he smiled and said, "When you and I roam the world with our Pure Yang Consciousness, soaring like the great sun across the sky, he will likely still be struggling in the lower realms."

Someone nearby nodded, saying, "Indeed. Even the Ancestor Masters of the Immortal Path have suffered defeats in their early years. But what became of their opponents? On the path that followed, they gradually faded into obscurity."

Sun Jingxiao nodded, saying, "As Immortal Scions from the Out-of-Realm Lands, we must possess this confidence. After all, we are the most talented individuals in the Night Mist World, while the disciples of the New Life Path are merely ordinary people leftover after being chosen by the Immortal Path and Divine Path. Whether it's their comprehension, innate bone structure, or anything else, they cannot compare to us."

Another person nodded, saying, "At this gathering, someone is bound to bring out some cultivation challenges or come with incomplete scriptures for discussion and exchange. At that time, you'll understand why our Out-of-Realm Lands are able to continuously expand our paths."

In the brightly lit hall, almost all the invited guests had arrived. Starting as geniuses, they were all young celebrities from various Paths. Today, many were willing to attend, not only to meet exceptional talents from different paths but primarily to discuss scriptures, debate the Dao, and engage in exchanges. People from the Out-of-Realm Lands and the Esoteric Sect were no strangers to this, having engaged in such discussions and contests among themselves before, understanding the ways of it. To gain an advantage, some would occasionally bring unresolved mysteries left by past sages, or even proactively ask Ancestor Masters to pose difficult questions in advance, presenting them to challenge their opponents.

Soon, someone couldn't hold back, presenting "difficult problems" to initiate the friendly exchange session.

Chu Pianran's eyes sparkled. "No wonder this era is so vibrant with a hundred schools of thought contending and various paths vying for supremacy. Such exchanges are indeed very meaningful." She was greatly interested and joined in, directly taking out an ancient book. "This scripture, in our era, was rarely understood by anyone. I hope people of this era can resolve my confusion."

Instantly, everyone's spirits lifted, and they gathered forward.

"Could the material of this book be... Immortal skin?!" Someone was immediately shocked on the spot. Upon handling it, he felt the book's extraordinary nature: runes interwoven, as if containing profound rules and principles, causing one's mind to tremble. However, it did not possess the pressure of an Immortal; it was merely a vessel for scriptures.

"Yes, it should be refined from Immortal skin," Chu Pianran admitted. In that distant ancient era, important texts were always recorded on extraordinary materials.

Qin Ming's expression shifted. Not long ago, he had conversed with Chu Pianran and learned that special power warriors would supplement themselves with divine bones and immortal skin to become peak experts. Yet in the blink of an eye, she took out a book made of precisely such material. Qin Ming could only sigh in admiration; the ancient environment was simply too good, and "heavenly materials" were not scarce. Naturally, he too became interested and followed the others forward.

"This is a classic text from an Ancient Immortal Daoist Temple, and it's the kind that's notoriously difficult to comprehend. It must be priceless," someone whispered. In fact, precisely because of this, everyone was incredibly tempted, all wanting to try and see if they could grasp the true meaning of the scripture within.

Zhao Shuyu muttered to himself, "I didn't expect Senior Sister Chu to bring this. Even people from our era struggled to comprehend that scripture. Can people of this era understand it? It would be good if it stumped them."

A prodigious talent from the Ghost Path showed a strange look. He had heard of this wondrous book and immediately realized that Chu Pianran intended to teach the newcomers a lesson.
