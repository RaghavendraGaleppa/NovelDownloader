# Chapter 9: Grandpa Tree: Cooking Myself?

In the outer sect, within the Duty Hall.

Elder Lin stormed in, his face twisted with anger.

"It's already the third watch—he must be staying out overnight and not coming back."

"I saw chaos down the mountain, what looked like a wildfire. Even the night patrol from the Enforcement Hall was alerted. There's no chance to deal with him tonight."

"That shameless bastard must have gone to the Dark Flower Alley again, leaving me to freeze outside his door all night."

Elder Lin fumed as he tore off his black face covering.

Disappointment hung heavy in the air, but just then, Pei Ying—his face bruised and swollen—limped forward and whispered, "This might not be a bad thing. If we couldn't do it tonight, we can do it tomorrow."

His lips were so swollen his words were barely intelligible, but he continued, "If we had killed him tonight, the Enforcement Hall would investigate, and we'd all be held accountable for negligence. But now that there's a wildfire outside, security will tighten starting tomorrow..."

Chen Youyu clenched his fists and muttered, "With tighter security, how will we get another chance?"

Pei Ying shook his head slightly. "Think about it, brother-in-law. Precisely because security will tighten, there'll be reassignments. The 'helper' Senior Brother Chen Yang found for us can be officially requested by the outer sect! And since 'it' is new here, any accidents would hardly be our fault, right?"

"Fine!" Chen Youyu sighed in resignation. "Let him live one more day!"

Despite his words, unease gnawed at him. *One delay leads to another—how many tomorrows can there be?*

---

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing had already returned to his courtyard, carrying a sack over his shoulder.

The Five Elements Creation Tree inside the sack was beginning to stir, struggling violently.

Li Zhengjing lifted the sack and slammed it hard onto the ground a few times until it finally settled down.

"I'm usually asleep by now. Tonight, I ruined my routine for you—so behave!"

Dragging the sack to a corner, he picked up a chopper and opened it.

*Whoosh!*  

A fiery red branch shot out from the sack like an arrow, aiming straight for Li Zhengjing's face—as if to pierce through his skull!

"A brat like you, who hasn't even cultivated internal energy yet, thinks he can capture Grandpa Tree?"

"In my heyday, countless immortal cultivators fought to the death over me! Every one who ever got their hands on me treated me like a treasure!"

"Today, I'll teach you a lesson—*holy shit! My hand!*"

The Five Elements Creation Tree rolled on the ground, its four branches flailing wildly, slicing through the night air with a howling wind as it screamed in agony. One of its branches now lay severed on the ground.

The moment it had struck, Li Zhengjing had swung his blade, cleanly chopping off its "fifth hand."

"Stop whining! You're a damn tree—it'll grow back!"

Li Zhengjing pressed the main trunk down with one hand and, with a few swift strokes of his blade, reduced it to a bare stick.

"You dare treat Grandpa Tree like this? You're dead!"

The tree lay flat on the ground, its countless roots writhing in the air as it shrieked, "Do you have any idea how precious I am?"

"Do you know I'm on the verge of achieving Five Elements Perfection, about to bear fruit that can refine the Creation Five Elements Pill?"

"You actually cut off five of my branches? You've got a death wish! If I don't report you and get you torn to pieces, my soul scattered to the winds, I'll be your grandson!"

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless. He raised his chopper and brought it down, splitting the trunk in two—a clean bisection.

"*Grandpa, I was wrong.*"

The halved tree flopped on the ground, rolling left and right, its roots flailing as it wailed, "Grandpa, your grandson can still grow back! I can still bear fruit for the Creation Five Elements Pill! More importantly, wherever I am becomes sacred land—I gather the energy of the Five Elements, making cultivation twice as effective! I'm a living, breathing spirit-gathering formation!"

Li Zhengjing kicked it lightly. "Others may treat you like treasure, but I won't coddle you! I've got work to do—go set up the pot and start a fire over there."

The Five Elements Creation Tree froze. Then its roots waved hesitantly. "What's the fire for?"

Li Zhengjing picked up the five branches and the halved trunk. "I'm grinding these into powder. You boil the water first."

The tree's roots flailed wildly in protest. "*I* set up the pot and boil *myself*? That's too much! I'd rather die than—*wait, Master, how much water should I add?*"

"Half full. Boil it hard."

Li Zhengjing examined the branches and trunk. "With extra material, we'll have more powder, so less water—thicker broth, stronger potency."

"Master is truly an expert!" The tree praised. "A thicker broth not only tastes better but also preserves more of my spiritual energy during boiling—maximizing its nutritional value!"

Without another word, it scrambled toward the stove, flipping and flopping as it struggled to move with only half its trunk. After tumbling seven or eight times, it finally reached the stove, flipped upside down, and used its roots to lift the pot onto the fire.

Then it righted itself, wrapped a root around a firestarter, and ignited the flames—nearly setting itself on fire in the process.

"Water... there's water by the well..."

It stumbled and crawled to the well to fetch water, seething inwardly. *I swear, if I don't get revenge, I'm not a tree!*

Li Zhengjing spent the rest of the night grinding the branches into powder. By dawn, exhausted, he had finished the five branches and stored the remaining half-trunk in a sack, burying it underground.

The Five Elements Creation Tree watched from the stove as Li Zhengjing buried its upper half and carried the powdered branches into the kitchen. Overcome with misery, it hugged its remaining stump with its roots and wept.

"Stop crying," Li Zhengjing consoled. "Keep the fire going. If you stay busy, it won't hurt as much."

"......"

The tree trembled but obeyed, stoking the flames.

In all its years of existence, no matter which power or mighty expert had possessed it, each had treated it with utmost care, guarding it day and night—not just for the boost to their cultivation but also for the Creation Five Elements Pill it could produce.

Yet today, it had encountered this reckless upstart who had no idea of its worth—beating it, cursing it, chopping it in half, and forcing it to cook itself! *This is inhuman!*

By sunrise, the water had reduced to a third of its volume, thickening into a paste.

After removing it from the heat and letting it cool slightly, it congealed into a gelatinous substance.

Li Zhengjing eagerly scooped a bowlful and took a spoonful. It melted on his tongue, releasing a refreshing aroma.

A cooling sensation flowed from his mouth down his throat, spreading through his organs and limbs—an indescribable comfort!

Then warmth blossomed in his organs, and faint currents of energy pulsed within.

This was the spiritual energy contained within the Five Elements Creation Tree!

Now that he possessed the complete *Viscera-Nourishing Internal Energy Technique*, he could refine this energy to heal his organs and strengthen them.

The stronger his organs, the easier it would be to cultivate internal energy!

Standing in the courtyard, he raised his hands and began practicing the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique*.

For the rest of the day, Li Zhengjing alternated between refining the energy in his organs and consuming more of the Five Elements Creation Paste, cycling through cultivation and replenishment.

"This guy is ruthless. If he finishes the pot, he'll grind my roots into powder next!"  

The tree crouched by the stove, watching the paste dwindle, trembling in fear. *I need to remind him—sustainability is key! Overharvesting is idiotic!*

Suddenly, Li Zhengjing groaned, blood trickling from his lips.

His expression darkened. *Damn it—I pushed too hard. I made a mistake in the kidney-water step and injured my kidneys.*

But then, warmth surged into his kidneys, dispelling the discomfort and replacing it with vitality.

His eyes lit up with realization. *I get it now!*

Previously, any mistake in the *Viscera-Nourishing Internal Energy Technique* would damage his organs, requiring days of recovery—or worse, permanent harm.

But now, the spiritual energy from the paste continuously healed and strengthened his organs, allowing him to experiment and correct his mistakes!

*This must be why the golden page predicted I'd cultivate internal energy within three days!*

*With my unparalleled talent and this advantage, I'll break through in a single day! Who needs three?*

Just as he thought this, a knock came at the gate.

"Li Zhengjing, you've got mail."
