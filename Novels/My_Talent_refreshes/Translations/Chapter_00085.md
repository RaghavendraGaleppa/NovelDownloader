**Chapter 85: Publicly Crafting Talismans, Seeing the Mysterious Pattern Again**

Lin Changqing's brows furrowed slightly, while Luo Yiping continued, "Senior Brother Du also mentioned that the number of talismans Chu Ning provided could be used to offset his monthly contributions. His answer was no, but just now, we saw him selling all sorts of talismans."

After hearing Luo Yiping, Lin Changqing's gaze, like two sharp swords, pierced straight at Chu Ning. Instantly, Chu Ning felt that familiar oppressive sensation from facing Deacon Zhang of the Enforcement Hall, that uncomfortable feeling throughout his body, resurface. To Chu Ning's slight surprise, however, the oppressive feeling was not as strong as it had been before. He wondered if it was because Lin Changqing's cultivation was not as high as Deacon Zhang's, or because Chu Ning's own spiritual sense had improved.

"Du Han, is that true?" Lin Changqing looked at Chu Ning but addressed Du Han.

Du Han looked at Chu Ning, his brows also tightly furrowed. "Uncle-Master Lin, it's true that I agreed Chu Ning wouldn't go to the beast calamity site. This junior nephew did ask him about talismans back then. Chu Ning's reply was that he didn't have any talismans on hand."

"But we just heard that he sells talismans every day, and he must have sold quite a few," Shen Zhengquan interjected casually from the side.

Lin Changqing's gaze remained fixed on Chu Ning. Although he said nothing, Chu Ning understood his meaning: he wanted an explanation.

Chu Ning immediately replied in a deep voice, "To the Deacon, these talismans were drawn by myself."

Lin Changqing's gaze swept over Chu Ning's hand holding the talisman brush. He reined in his imposing aura and spoke faintly, "You can craft low-grade mid-tier talismans?"

Chu Ning nodded. "I have about forty to fifty percent success rate."

"Draw one and let me see."

Hearing Lin Changqing's words, Chu Ning nodded slightly, then closed his eyes. Luo Yiping was about to say something, but just as he opened his mouth, Lin Changqing's sharp gaze suddenly swept over. Feeling Lin Changqing's stare, Luo Yiping immediately shut up.

After a brief adjustment, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes, re-dipped his talisman brush in ink, and began to draw the talisman. Luo Yiping's repeated provocations had somewhat annoyed Chu Ning. However, as his spiritual energy truly flowed into the talisman brush, his mind became incredibly calm. Unwilling to be entangled further in this matter, Chu Ning became even more focused. With the enhancement of his Talisman Source Spirit Body, Chu Ning's success rate for crafting Vajra Talismans had actually reached sixty percent. After one failed attempt earlier, this time Chu Ning did not fail again.

The dao patterns appeared naturally and fluidly from Chu Ning's talisman brush. A moment later, a golden light flashed on the talisman, and a low-grade mid-tier talisman appeared on the table. It was indeed a Vajra Talisman.

Seeing this, before anyone else could speak, Luo Yiping's mouth dropped wide open. "Impossible! You… You can craft low-grade mid-tier talismans? That's only possible for a Tier 2 Talisman Master!"

The tall and muscular disciple, Ding Bo, also exclaimed in surprise, "Oh, this talisman really was drawn by Junior Brother Chu."

Not just Luo Yiping, but everyone present looked at Chu Ning with immense surprise. After all, in their eyes, Chu Ning was only at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation. For someone at such a cultivation level to have talisman crafting skills comparable to a Tier 2 Talisman Master felt somewhat unreal to them. Even Lin Changqing's gaze towards Chu Ning now held a hint of surprise.

Chu Ning said nothing, simply handing the talisman he had just drawn, along with others he had taken from his storage bag, to Lin Changqing. The latter took them, examined them briefly, then returned both talismans to Chu Ning. He then slowly spoke, "The quality is the same. It seems your talisman crafting skill is quite good."

"How can this be? He..." This result was undoubtedly far beyond Luo Yiping's expectations, so much so that he couldn't help but exclaim again.

Lin Changqing frowned upon hearing this, glancing at Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan. He asked coldly, "Are you questioning my judgment? Do you want to see the talismans again?"

"I..." Luo Yiping's face instantly flushed red, unable to find a reply. Shen Zhengquan's expression also flashed with embarrassment, but he immediately cupped his hands and said, "Since the Deacon has already appraised them, it is naturally true. We misunderstood Junior Brother Chu earlier. We hope Junior Brother Chu will be magnanimous."

Chu Ning felt a slight chill in his heart upon hearing this. *This person is far more cunning. Now, it will naturally be harder for everyone to blame him, unlike Luo Yiping, who wears everything on his sleeve.*

Before Chu Ning could speak, Lin Changqing had already waved his hand, his expression greatly displeased. "Enough. Let this matter rest. You've made such a fuss over a trivial matter, showing not even basic trust in a fellow disciple."

As Lin Changqing's words rang out, many people present instantly showed a look of shame. Gu Xiaoqing, Xie Bo, and others all cast apologetic glances at Chu Ning. While Luo Yiping had indeed been the loudest, they too had harbored a trace of doubt about Chu Ning.

Lin Changqing's gaze shifted to Luo Yiping, his expression showing great displeasure. "You're from the Hundred Arts Hall too, aren't you? You accuse a junior brother from your own hall indiscriminately. Hmph..."

Luo Yiping was reprimanded by Lin Changqing, his face instantly turning pale then flushed. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something more. But Lin Changqing gave him no opportunity, tossing his hand and walking towards Chu Ning's stall. "Let's talk about the beast calamity now. No need to go anywhere else, this place will do."

Since Lin Changqing said so, the others naturally followed him into the stall. Gu Xiaoqing, for her part, took the initiative to say to Chu Ning, "Junior Brother Chu, I'm sorry. I really didn't expect your talisman crafting skills to be this advanced. Just now..."

"What are you saying, Senior Sister?" Chu Ning immediately interrupted her. "Senior Sister already showed me much care earlier."

Gu Xiaoqing nodded, about to say more, when the tall and muscular Ding Bo approached and threw an arm around Chu Ning's shoulder. "Junior Brother Chu, you're amazing! To be able to craft such high-quality low-grade mid-tier talismans!"

"Just now, I also thought you were deliberately withholding talismans from everyone." Saying this, Ding Bo glanced at Luo Yiping, who was standing nearby. "Junior Brother Luo, what you did was unkind. You almost made us all wrongly accuse Junior Brother Chu."

Luo Yiping, usually so talkative, had his face turn green and red again. But facing Ding Bo, he remained silent. Just as Chu Ning wondered what background Ding Bo had, Gu Xiaoqing had already introduced him. "Junior Brother Chu, this is Senior Brother Ding from the inner sect."

*So, he's an inner sect true disciple,* Chu Ning realized with a start. No wonder Luo Yiping didn't dare to say much. *An inner sect true disciple, is he an Earth Spirit Root or some other talent?*

As he was thinking this, Ding Bo already blurted out, "Oh, don't call me Senior Brother. I'm only at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation. I just happen to have a Lightning Spirit Root and was taken into the inner sect."

A Lightning Spirit Root! Hearing that Ding Bo possessed the rare Lightning Spirit Root, Chu Ning couldn't help but give Ding Bo another look. This Lightning Spirit Root was even rarer than an Earth Spirit Root, already comparable to a Heavenly Spirit Root.

Ding Bo, however, seemed entirely unconcerned, still speaking in his boisterous manner, "Haha, let's hurry inside!"

As they spoke, everyone crowded in. Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan lagged behind. Once everyone else had entered, the two, with rather unpleasant expressions, followed them in.

Upon seeing everyone enter, Lin Changqing immediately spoke.

"This beast calamity was primarily caused by a Tier 3 demonic beast, equivalent to a mid-tier Foundation Establishment cultivator, coming from the Qingxia Mountain Range to the branch range, disturbing these low-tier demonic beasts."

"This beast has been killed, so the beast calamity should be over. However, some high-tier Tier 1 demonic beasts have remained in this mountain range, so everyone should be more careful when venturing out." Lin Changqing said this, then turned to Du Han. "What happened? Although this beast calamity had more demonic beasts and some high-tier Tier 1 ones, the overall level wasn't high. The sect dispatched people to assist, so why did you all end up in such a sorry state?"

Lin Han's face showed annoyance. "Uncle-Master Lin, it was mainly due to a group of rogue cultivators. On our second day there, some rogue cultivators appeared. After I left to go elsewhere, these rogue cultivators began fighting with a few junior brothers and sisters over a high-tier Tier 1 demonic beast. If I hadn't returned in time due to something urgent, they might have suffered greatly."

Lin Changqing's brows lifted slightly, then he asked, "And after that?"

"The next two days were normal. We organized the various immortal cultivation families to resist, and then the sect's reinforcements arrived," Lin Han replied, the anger on his face not dissipating. "But today, some more rogue cultivators appeared, taking advantage of the chaos. And this time, a ninth-layer Qi Condensation rogue cultivator tied me down. Several senior and junior brothers had used up most of their resources after several days, which is why they got injured. Fortunately, Uncle-Master and Junior Brother Ding Bo appeared in time..."

Chu Ning gleaned the general situation from Du Han's words, but his heart stirred. *Could these so-called rogue cultivators be the same people who came to the market that night? But at that time, I only saw four people. Did they have companions?*

Just as he was thinking this, Lin Changqing let out a cold laugh. "Rogue cultivators? I think not necessarily."

As he spoke, Lin Changqing casually waved his hand, producing a storage bag, and poured a few items out of it. Then, Lin Changqing reached out and grasped one of the iron-plate-like objects. Everyone looked at Lin Changqing, somewhat confused. Chu Ning, however, after seeing this iron plate, felt his eyelids suddenly twitch.

The iron plate was not large, and a pattern was carved upon it, composed of seemingly random lines. Despite the crude appearance of the pattern, Chu Ning recognized it at a glance. This pattern was exactly the same as the bamboo pattern he had seen on the bamboo plaque from Qi Chongmao's storage bag after he killed him.

"What's going on? Why is the bamboo plaque from Qi Chongmao's possession identical to the pattern on this iron plate?" At this moment, Chu Ning's heart was filled with immense shock. He certainly didn't believe this was a coincidence. His gaze returned to Lin Changqing, waiting for the Deacon's next words.

"Deacon, this looks like an identity token?" At this moment, Du Han proactively asked from the side.
