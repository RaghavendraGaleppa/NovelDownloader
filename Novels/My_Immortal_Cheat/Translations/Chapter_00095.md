Chapter 95: The Pope

Boer’s expression changed. This kid was indeed playing the pig to eat the tiger. On the surface, his muscles seemed weak and he walked with an unsteady gait, but unexpectedly, when he moved, it was with the force of thunder. Such a fierce fist technique and method of energy manipulation could absolutely not be unleashed without years of practice; he was only slightly inferior to Boer himself. Boer couldn’t understand why the Voodoo Cult would release such a promising talent to carry out a terrorist attack.

Having been immersed in combat for many years, although Zhou Tian’s punch was fierce, it was still within Boer’s reaction range. He blocked with the side of his right fist, the patterns on his arm guard lit up, and white runes soared. With a bang, Zhou Tian’s fist was deflected. At the same time, Boer clenched his left hand, and milky white energy converged, forming a lifelike energy spear with patterns on its tip. He thrust it straight towards Zhou Tian’s chest. “Judge this blasphemer!” someone among the onlookers roared furiously. Zhou Tian’s earlier words had already driven them nearly insane.

Zhou Tian still didn’t dodge or evade, or rather, he chose not to. The spear struck Zhou Tian’s chest, and Boer’s pupils suddenly constricted. The energy spear, as if encountering a barrier made of sunstone, stopped motionless on Zhou Tian’s skin, then transformed into a white stream of light and entered Zhou Tian’s body. “Voodoo Lord grant me strength! Super Invincible God-Slaying Spear of Death!” Zhou Tian roared, waving his hand. A spear identical to the energy spear just wielded by Boer appeared in his hand. He too thrust it forward.

“…” The onlookers fell silent. “Why does that move seem a little familiar?” Boer’s eyes narrowed. The distance between them was too close; it was too late to use a divine ability for defense. His hands covered in light, he roared and gripped the spear Zhou Tian thrust. However, the moment he grasped it, Boer looked at Zhou Tian with an expression of shock and doubt.

“Holy Divine Power? Who exactly are you?” The instant Boer touched the energy spear, he felt it. The power condensed on the spear was pure Holy Divine Church divine power, utterly pristine. The light and holiness it contained were unmistakable to him. Boer was momentarily distracted, and the spear instantly pierced towards his chest. Clang! With a crisp sound, the white spear was blocked by his armor. The patterns on his armor lit up; though it looked somewhat worn, it truly blocked the spear.

With a flash of white light, Boer reappeared some distance away, widening the gap between himself and Zhou Tian. He frowned deeply, staring at Zhou Tian. The divine power Zhou Tian had just unleashed left him at a loss; such pure power, almost equal to his own, could only be wielded by the most devout believers. Zhou Tian, too, remained rooted to the spot, his face beneath the mask filled with helplessness. He had no choice; the [Attack Storage Reflection] skill merely redirected the opponent’s attack back at them and could not alter the attack’s essence. Like the energy-mimicking attack just now, it was easily discernible.

“Who exactly are you? Voodoo Cult followers absolutely do not possess such pure Holy Divine Power!” Boer demanded, not considering that Zhou Tian’s attack was essentially his own. After all, the techniques used were common combat skills that almost anyone knew, without any special divine abilities. He merely assumed Zhou Tian was mocking him by using the same attack methods. Zhou Tian pondered for a moment, “Who exactly am I?”

“Long live the Voodoo Cult! May the Voodoo Lord screw the Lord of the Holy Divine Church!” Boer’s eyes widened. No matter who the opponent was, he would first knock them down. Such blasphemy against the Divine Lord had touched his bottom line. Divine power surged within him, and he formed a hand seal.

“Holy Lion Seal!” A white-maned lion, nearly a hundred zhang in size, appeared behind him, its head almost ten zhang tall. It roared, its mane fluttering in the wind as if corporeal, its beastly eyes intimidating. “It’s the phantom of the Radiant Holy Lion!” some believers cried out in excitement, some even kneeling to pray. The Radiant Holy Lion held a significant place in the Holy Divine Church, being the mount of a saint. Roar!

The maned lion let out an earth-shattering roar, stomping on the void as it charged towards Zhou Tian, jaws agape. Cracks appeared in the space, shattered by its steps. The lion’s massive mouth engulfed Zhou Tian, but Boer showed no hint of satisfaction; instead, his brows furrowed. As expected, the white-maned lion, like the energy spear before it, transformed into a stream of light and entered Zhou Tian’s body. Zhou Tian then made a gesture, drawing a circle on the ground, and a bad premonition arose in Boer’s heart.

“Summoning Art: Holy Beast Radiant Holy Lion!” Accompanying a shout, a white lion, slightly smaller than the one Boer had just conjured, appeared. It too roared, but this time, it roared towards Boer.

“…” The onlookers fell silent once more, staring wide-eyed at each other. Before Boer could react, a clear voice echoed through the void.

“Six-Staff Light Prison!” *Buzz!* Six pillars of light descended from the sky, each a zhang thick and nearly a hundred zhang long, inscribed with incredibly complex runes, carrying unparalleled suppressive power. They formed a hexagon, encircling the white-maned lion.

*Clang-clatter!* Chains of Order extended from the light pillars, layer by layer locking the holy lion, gradually shrinking. The maned lion roared incessantly, but it was useless; it could only disappear along with the light pillars. A figure in white robes descended from the sky. The white robe was embroidered with golden thread, depicting Mandarava flowers and a winged Holy Emissary of Judgment.

The person had the face of a middle-aged man, with a gentle smile. Golden hair flowed down his back, a wreath woven from green vines adorned his head, and in his hand, he held a golden scepter. His entire being exuded a holy aura.

“Your Holiness the Pope!” Zhou Tian was startled by the shouts from behind him. He turned his head to see all the believers kneeling on the ground, shouting.

“Quite the grand entrance,” Zhou Tian thought, observing this so-called Pope. Boer, standing beside him, also bowed slightly in deference.

“Blaspheming my Lord warrants judgment!” the Pope said blandly, a white glow in his eyes. He gently shook his scepter, and its patterns lit up. Six pillars of light descended from the sky, and runic chains extended to bind Zhou Tian. The light pillars slowly shrank, eventually forming shackles around his neck, limbs, and one on his forehead.

“Imprison him in the Tribunal. He will be judged with those others at sunrise.” The voice remained calm and unperturbed, as if Zhou Tian wasn’t even worth his attention. Having spoken, he turned and left, holy light paving his way.

Zhou Tian paused slightly upon hearing this. He had expected to spend more time putting on a performance, but unexpectedly, some blockhead just sent him straight in. He was secretly pleased.

“Yes, Your Holiness the Pope!” Boer responded, stepping forward. He removed Zhou Tian’s mask and stared at his face for a moment, but found no memory. With a wave of his hand, several silver-armored guards appeared and escorted Zhou Tian in a certain direction.
