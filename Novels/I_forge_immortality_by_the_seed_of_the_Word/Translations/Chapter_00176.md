# Chapter 173: Taking Action (Combined)

The once bustling arena had fallen into complete silence, save for one arrogantly reverberating voice.

"Pathetic! Utterly pathetic!"

On the platform, the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc in its human form swept its gaze over the battered figure of Ge Qingshen. Noticing the terror on his opponent's face, a flash of disdain crossed its crimson eyes.

"Hahaha, what a disappointment! I haven't even warmed up properly yet!" it roared with laughter. "Is this the so-called strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator of the mighty Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect? In our Myriad Spirit Faction, you wouldn't even rank within the top ten thousand!"

The roc's mocking laughter filled the air as it looked down at the crowd below. Wherever its sharp gaze landed, cultivators lowered their heads despite their indignation, not daring to meet its eyes.

Who would dare? The monstrous strength this creature had displayed was beyond comprehension. If its power in the secret realm could still be considered within Foundation Establishment parameters, today's performance had clearly transcended that realm. If even Ge Qingshen had been crushed so thoroughly, what chance did the rest of them have?

Seeing no challengers, the roc's arrogance grew. With a flourish, it produced a seed shimmering with seven-colored spiritual light.

"Behold! A seed of the immortal Seven Treasures Gourd Vine! Today, anyone who can last three hundred rounds against me—no, just survive three hundred rounds—can claim it! Who dares to face me?"

Its voice sent shockwaves rippling through the air, making even the indestructible platform tremble.

Whispers spread through the crowd:

"Senior Brother, are you certain that Ge Qingshen is truly Taiyi's strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator?"

"Of course! Even that Myriad Spirit being confirmed it!"

"Then why was his performance so—"

"Perhaps this generation of Taiyi's Foundation Establishment cultivators is weak. Who would have thought an eternal orthodox sect ruling over a vast heavenly realm could have such a talent drought?"

"Pity our Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven's Primordial Immortal Sect's geniuses aren't present. Otherwise, this feathered beast wouldn't dare strut about like this!"

The murmurs reached the Taiyi disciples at the forefront.

"Senior Brother..." A man beside Shen Chu clenched his fists, humiliation burning in his eyes. He wanted to refute the disparaging remarks but found himself at a loss. What could he say? Ge Qingshen's defeat was undeniable. Though their opponent was monstrously strong, as disciples of humanity's eternal orthodox sect, when had they ever used an enemy's strength as an excuse for defeat?

Shen Chu stood frozen, fists trembling. Despite the longstanding rivalry between their factions, witnessing Ge Qingshen's crushing defeat brought no satisfaction. In this moment, they were all Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect disciples—their fates intertwined.

His gaze shot toward a raised platform where two figures sat—senior brothers whose strength surpassed even Ge Qingshen's. "Surely they'll act now?" he thought.

At that moment, Zhang Jing, who had been meditating, opened his eyes. His calm gaze swept over the boasting roc before he rose to his feet. Beside him, Qu Junhou stood as well, his expression brimming with confidence as he eyed their opponent.

Simultaneously, a man from the Primordial Demon Sect also stood, his eyes flickering with abyssal demonic light—a great demon awakening, ready to drag all into endless darkness.

As Zhang Jing had anticipated, this man intended to challenge the roc.

A glint flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes as he transmitted to Qu Junhou: "Brother Qu, handle the roc. I'll intercept our demonic friend here. If he intervenes first, our sect will become a laughingstock."

"Understood," Qu Junhou nodded before transforming into a streak of light that shot toward the platform.

Noticing this, the demonic cultivator frowned and moved to follow, his aura intensifying—only to freeze when soft footsteps approached.

"Please hold, Dao Brother," Zhang Jing said pleasantly, blocking his path. "This is an internal matter of our Taiyi Sect. Your assistance is unnecessary."

The demonic cultivator's abyss-like eyes met Zhang Jing's calm gaze. A mocking smile twisted his lips. "Junior Brother is too polite. As hosts, how can we Primordial Immortal Sect stand by while Taiyi disciples are humiliated by Myriad Spirit trash? Especially when Ge Qingshen is my dear friend."

He continued, his demonic aura swelling: "Moreover, allowing these creatures in was our oversight. By duty and personal sentiment, I should be the one to act. Please step aside—and recall your Qu Junhou. If he's injured by that roc, my guilt would be unbearable."

Blackness swallowed his eyes completely, a terrifying demonic will surging forth to devour Zhang Jing's spirit.

"Your enthusiasm comes rather late," Zhang Jing replied mildly. The fusion of Yin-Yang and Five Elements Dao Intent coalesced in his gaze, meeting the demonic light head-on—and overwhelming it with unstoppable force.

The air sizzled as if something intangible was being annihilated. The demonic cultivator's face twitched with shock at the terrifying pressure.

Their confrontation drew astonished gazes from other disciples on the platform. The young man from the Human Emperor Dao Court watched the Primordial Demon Sect cultivator being suppressed by Zhang Jing, his eyes widening.

"Incredible strength! To overwhelm Brother Wang like this... When did Taiyi produce such a monster?" he thought, then glanced toward the arena where the once-invincible roc was now struggling under Qu Junhou's assault. The annihilating Dao Intent radiating from Qu Junhou was systematically destroying the roc's vaunted golden feathers.

"What was Ge Qingshen thinking, trying to test these two? Was he mad?" the man mused wryly.

Beside him, the previously arrogant Shi trembled slightly. "Thank heavens I didn't provoke them further..."

Meanwhile, two other Taiyi disciples from the Nine Territories faction stared dumbfounded—first at Qu Junhou's dominance, then at Zhang Jing's effortless suppression of their rival sect's expert.

"Is this a dream? Since when did our faction have such monsters?" they wondered simultaneously, the title "Taiyi's Strongest Foundation Establishment" suddenly ringing hollow in their minds.

Time passed.

On the platform, the roc finally yielded. "Enough! I surrender! Take the damn seed!" it cried, human form battered beyond recognition, its once-proud golden feathers littering the ground like trash.

The crowd erupted in cheers, their earlier humiliation transformed into exultation. A monstrous Myriad Spirit genius had been crushed by human talent!

"Who said Ge Qingshen was Taiyi's strongest? Clearly, it's the Earth-Sundering Bright King! That roc was terrifying, yet he toyed with it!"

"Taiyi having a talent drought? What nonsense! An eternal orthodox sect will always produce peerless geniuses!"

The Taiyi disciples—whether from the Heavenly or Nine Territories factions—stood tall, pride shining in their eyes as they gazed at Qu Junhou.

"Is this... Senior Brother Qu's true power?" Shen Chu murmured, dazed. He'd known Qu Junhou was strong, but this defied imagination. "Then what of Senior Brother Zhang?"

He recalled how Qu Junhou had subtly deferred to Zhang Jing during their first meeting. The implications sent a thrill through him. "At the final ranking battles, I'll witness Senior Brother Zhang's true capabilities."

Nearby, Ge Qingshen watched in stunned silence. Not only had his "junior brother" crushed the roc as effortlessly as the roc had crushed him, but this display also shattered his belief in human limitations. His earlier excuses now seemed laughably pathetic.

With a self-deprecating smile, Ge Qingshen turned and limped away, shoulders slumped.

Back on the platform, a streak of light returned to Zhang Jing's side, revealing Qu Junhou holding out the seven-colored seed.

"Brother Zhang, I've no use for this. Consider it repayment for the immortal crystals you lent me for palace rent."

Zhang Jing blinked in surprise. "Brother Qu jests. Their values are incomparable."

"Please take it. It's truly worthless to me. Besides, you deserve a share." After persistent urging, Zhang Jing reluctantly accepted. "You've made me owe you now," he chuckled.

Three figures then approached—the Human Emperor Dao Court's Ji Jiulin, the Primordial Demon Sect's Wang Wunian, and the previously hostile Shi Yi—all offering respectful greetings and invitations.

"Gentlemen are too kind. As Brother Wang said, today we've fought and thus become acquainted," Zhang Jing replied genially, with Qu Junhou echoing his sentiments.

Meanwhile, the battered roc arrived before a cave abode. The door opened to reveal a reclining female figure exuding terrifying bloodline pressure.

"Jin Yu, your injuries suggest you've scouted Taiyi's Foundation Establishment talents?" she asked lazily.

"Yes, my lady. Their strongest is one Qu Junhou, wielding terrifying annihilation Dao Intent. Among our Myriad Spirit's elite Foundation Establishment beings, he'd rank near the top—though no threat to you."

"Good." She nodded, then addressed others in the cave: "Investigate the other human orthodox sects' geniuses. My trial mission is to claim the Foundation Establishment crown in their secret realm. Failure is unacceptable!"

The roc and others prostrated themselves. "My lady jests! With your noble bloodline, victory is assured!"

"Of course," she giggled, a flawless foot playfully dangling from her jade bed. "But humans say: know yourself and your enemy to win every battle."
