# Chapter 8: Greed Arises, Thoughts Unblocked

Han Li truthfully, yet deceitfully, explained to Han Zhen how he had obtained the small bottle and the attempts he had made with it.

Han Zhen did not expose Han Li’s lie, instead feeling a sense of relief. This boy was finally developing a little cunning. If he remained so naive, Han Zhen would worry whether he could overcome Doctor Mo.

Han Zhen toyed with the small bottle, never imagining a treasure from the Celestial Realm would appear so easily in his hands. Thinking of the Palm Bottle’s miraculous uses, and how his own spiritual root aptitude was far superior to Han Li’s, coupled with his "Heaven's Reward" qi luck, he believed there would be no bottleneck he couldn't breakthrough. Han Zhen was confident that he could do better than Han Li with the Palm Bottle!

As this thought arose, Han Zhen could not suppress his covetous desire for the Palm Bottle. He wanted to claim it for himself! Whether through deception or forceful seizure, he was determined to keep the Palm Bottle in his possession!

Just as Han Zhen was about to act on this thought, the magnificent scroll of "Heaven's Reward" innate qi luck, which had merged with his divine soul, suddenly burst forth with dazzling light. He felt an immense karmic aura enveloping him. Han Zhen instantly came to his senses. The "Heaven's Reward" was already a path to the heavens; it was not worth gambling his life for this.

"Brother Zhen, do you know what this small bottle is?" Han Li asked, seeing Han Zhen so engrossed, thinking his brother might know something.

"I haven't seen anything similar..." Han Zhen wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. "I tried comparing it with precious medicines I've seen; none are stored in a similar small bottle."

In front of Han Li, Han Zhen tried to inject True Qi and even attempted to activate secret techniques, his arms flaring with crimson纹路, but no matter how much force he used, he couldn't open the small bottle. Seeing that even Brother Zhen had no way to deal with the bottle, Han Li was now greatly disappointed. After exchanging some cultivation insights with Brother Zhen, he prepared to go back and figure out a solution for the bottle himself.

A year and a half later, Han Zhen was fourteen, and his Evergreen Art had long since reached the third layer of perfection. In two years, Han Zhen had transformed from a slightly mature boy into a young man with a handsome, jade-like face. Outwardly, he appeared as a dashing youth in satin robes, but beneath his clothes, his body was like refined steel, containing explosive power.

Meanwhile, Han Li, now twelve, remained a dark-skinned, taciturn village boy. From their appearances, no one would associate Han Li and Han Zhen as cousins.

After becoming Doctor Mo's personal disciple, Han Li suddenly began to slack off. This not only drove Doctor Mo crazy but also left Han Zhen utterly speechless. Since he could remain in the Seven Mystical Sect without worry, and the pseudo-True Qi cultivated from this mantra was unsatisfactory, coupled with a subconscious resistance to Doctor Mo, Han Li lost his motivation to cultivate.

Han Zhen had originally planned to reveal some information about the cultivation world to stimulate Han Li, but within a few days, Han Li suddenly became full of motivation again. It turned out Doctor Mo had simply increased his payment! For every layer Han Li broke through, Doctor Mo would double his monthly allowance. Han Zhen felt fortunate that although he was also financially assisting Han Li, who sent all his money home, he hadn't given him too much silver.

Han Zhen also paid attention to Zhang Tie's cultivation progress. Since Zhang Tie called him Brother Zhen, Han Zhen felt he had to give him a hand. Han Zhen earnestly instructed Zhang Tie to seek him out before he felt he was about to break through the third layer of the Elephant Armor Art. He also subtly hinted to both Zhang Tie and Han Li that Doctor Mo had taken in many medicinal apprentice disciples in the past, almost all of whom disappeared mysteriously after a few years. Seeing Brother Zhen's solemn expression, the honest Zhang Tie readily agreed, promising to fulfill their agreement. Han Li, sensing Doctor Mo's increasingly urgent催促, also felt a vague unease and finally resolved to secretly practice martial arts.

While waiting for Han Li to acquire the subsequent cultivation methods, Han Zhen was not idle. In addition to cultivating Evergreen Art, Han Zhen simultaneously pursued both internal and external martial arts. After achieving minor mastery in Pure Yang Force, Han Zhen chose to switch to "Mad Python Force," an internal art that complemented Master Wu's staff techniques. Combined with the Mad Demon Staff fighting style, his combat was incredibly fierce. When activating his unique skill, crimson python patterns would appear all over his body. During this period, he would become incredibly strong and fearless of pain. For Han Zhen, whose body was nourished by spiritual energy, the side effects of this internal art were almost non-existent.

The day he could defeat Master Wu would be the day Han Zhen prematurely revealed his hand to Doctor Mo. Han Zhen felt the profound True Qi cultivation within his body; that day wouldn't be far off. However, one point had to be considered: there was a cultivator's primordial spirit hidden within Doctor Mo, a variable that needed to be factored in beforehand.

At Seven Absolute Hall, disciples usually sparred frequently. Aside from the initial transmission of techniques, no one had seen Han Zhen since. After two years of cultivation, several talented young boys and girls had emerged among this batch of disciples. Han Zhen, whose talent had once shocked the Seven Mystical Sect, seemed to have been forgotten.

***

The next day, early in the morning.

This batch of Seven Absolute Hall disciples was assembled, a rare occurrence. This time, it was a mobilization meeting for new disciples to descend the mountain for training. Aside from Han Zhen, four other Seven Absolute Hall disciples were arranged at the forefront. Behind them stood over a hundred inner disciples from the Hundred Forging Hall, who had just completed their training and had not yet been assigned new masters.

Among this batch of Seven Absolute Hall disciples, some were not Master Wu, the Vice Sect Master’s disciples. They felt unfamiliar with Han Zhen, who stood at the very front of the five. After asking familiar disciples, they learned he was the genius disciple Vice Sect Master Wu had personally and shamelessly sought to recruit back then.

Young people are naturally high-spirited. They hadn't seen him in two years. Moreover, Han Zhen had no impressive combat achievements to show. Why was he allowed to stand up there? However, in front of so many high-ranking officials of the Seven Mystical Sect, no one dared to act presumptuously. Nevertheless, covert competitions would surely follow. To truly win everyone's obedience, a fight would naturally be indispensable.

These disciples were divided into five groups, each with over twenty people, led by a chosen Seven Absolute Hall disciple as captain, to descend the mountain for training. Of course, the main purpose for these new disciples descending the mountain this time was to gain experience; they would not be sent to areas with intense conflicts with the Wild Wolf Gang. Instead, they would primarily engage in skirmishes with small groups of the Wild Wolf Gang encroaching on the Seven Mystical Sect's territory, allowing these new disciples to see some blood and understand the dangers of the martial world early on. Each team would have one Hall Master and two Protectors secretly accompanying them to ensure their safety and prevent unexpected situations that could result in excessive casualties among the new disciples.

Han Li also learned from Han Zhen that he would be going down the mountain for a period. Naturally, Han Li's curiosity was piqued by the mobilization ceremony. From the adjacent mountaintop overlooking Sunset Peak, Han Li climbed a tree and gazed into the distance. In the square before the main hall, over a hundred people were lined up. Han Li, having cultivated the Health Preservation Art, possessed far superior eyesight than ordinary people. He looked at the imposing Han Zhen standing on the platform and felt immense envy. He couldn't help but complain that the promised teaching of the Seven Absolute Hall's ultimate techniques would apparently have to be postponed again.

When Han Zhen received the roster of his subordinates, he was also surprised. Wu Yan, Zhang Xiuer... Li Feiyu. These two were actually grouped together. Zhang Xiuer was also fourteen now, petite, beautiful, and charming. She seemed delicate and vulnerable, inspiring an urge in others to embrace her and cherish her.
