# Chapter 85: The Complex Process of Pill Refining

"Hiss... exhale..." Li Yizhen let out a long breath.

Then, she calmed down immediately, turned to Ding Rui, and smoothly changed the subject, her tone utterly calm. "Let me be clear upfront. Currently, every disciple in the Pill Hall is diligently refining Meridian-Opening Pills every day. So the only time I can truly teach you will be in the evening. You'll need to come to the Pill Hall to find me then, because only the Pill Hall has the tools for pill refining. Today, I'll take you to my residence so you know where it is; from now on, just come over around this time every day."

"I usually finish refining my assigned tasks and submit them by then. The remaining time can be used to teach you. However, I can't let you stay overnight here, so you'll need to figure out when you'll return."

"Of course, men and women should keep their distance. Even if you asked me to stay, I absolutely wouldn't. That's a man's promise," Ding Rui declared.

"Then you're quite the man," Li Yizhen smiled "sweetly," then immediately stopped, turned, and walked away. As she walked, she clenched her fists, her arms trembling slightly.

...

"Pill refining is undoubtedly an extremely difficult task!"

Li Yizhen's residence was equipped with an alchemy room provided by the sect. Every Pill Hall disciple had a residence like this. Most pills could be refined using the tools in this alchemy room.

Li Yizhen's heart skipped a beat, then quickly settled.

She knew that, barring any surprises, Ding Rui's words were truly just their surface meaning, without any intention of teasing her.

So, she didn't even respond, continuing blandly, "To learn pill refining, the most crucial element is fire! I have fire here, and it's not difficult to obtain, but the ability to control fire is quite challenging."

Li Yizhen looked at Ding Rui, her expression growing serious. She was a very conscientious person, and especially now, since she was forcefully teaching Ding Rui pill refining, she had to find a way to teach him as best she could!

"The ability to control fire comes from your cultivation of the 'Condensing Yang Art.' The true essence of the 'Condensing Yang Art' is inherently fire-attribute, granting a profound affinity for fire, even greater than your affinity for solar power when you were in the spirit fields."

"Of course, other cultivation arts can also achieve fire control, but they fall far short compared to the 'Condensing Yang Art'!"

"During pill refining, fire needs to burn continuously. From the initial heating of the furnace, to refining and purifying spirit ingredients, and then solidifying the essence of the pill formula at an appropriate temperature, all require your mastery of fire. Therefore, cultivators without sufficient talent in the 'Condensing Yang Art' are generally not permitted by the sect to enter the Pill Hall or Artifact Hall."

"Whether it's discarding unnecessary impurities during the initial purification of spirit herbs, or later combining the purified spirit herbs, both require this method of true essence application. The final step of collecting the pills after refining is no different."

"Pill refining isn't about just putting spirit herbs in the pill furnace and leaving them be; it requires constant adjustments. However, the temperature inside the pill furnace is exceedingly high, and if you stuck your hand in, it would likely be instantly burned. Therefore, you can only use true essence, and ideally, 'Verdant Wood Art' true essence!"

"Naturally, true essence from other cultivation arts can also be used, but none are as effective as 'Verdant Wood Art' true essence. This is because wood-attribute true essence is inherently compatible with fire, and furthermore, pills are almost entirely derived from plants and herbs, which also possess wood-attribute components, making them very compatible with 'Verdant Wood Art' true essence."

"Especially for the final pill collection, the adsorptive properties of 'Verdant Wood Art' true essence will make the process much easier."
