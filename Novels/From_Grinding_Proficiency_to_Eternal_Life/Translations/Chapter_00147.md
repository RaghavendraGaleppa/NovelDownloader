# Chapter 147: Mobile Fortress

Hong Baichuan remained silent for a long while before speaking. "Take this opportunity to summon the sect's elders and the heads of each hall to confirm the direction of our relocation."

The half-month deadline arrived as scheduled. After deliberation by the hall heads, elders, and the Sect Master, the entire Heavenly Work Cave would relocate toward the southwest, heading for the Ghost Weeping Abyss in the perilous region of Lingnan.

At that moment, sitting atop Guniu Mountain, Xu Yunfan watched as the first light of dawn broke over the horizon and fell upon him. He was activating his blood energy, practicing the essentials of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique.

*The first ray of morning light from the east bathed your body in warmth. Suddenly, a thought struck you. The blood energy circulating through your Pure Yang One Qi Technique no longer felt as obstructed and awkward as before. Instead, it flowed smoothly, and strands of nascent yang energy rose within your body.*

*Your Pure Yang One Qi Technique has reached the入门 (Initial Success) stage.*

Looking at the information prompt appearing in his vision, Xu Yunfan suddenly understood.

The Daoist Sect's Pure Yang One Qi Technique actually required observing the rising sun at dawn and drawing in the purple qi from the east to achieve success. Regardless of whether the world's spiritual energy had recovered, this martial art contained a concept of "Intent." If one did not touch upon this Intent, no amount of practice would allow entry into its door.

This was quite interesting. Martial arts after the External Three Unifications seemed to have begun producing all sorts of unimaginable mystical sensations. Or perhaps, the martial arts of the Daoist Sect were simply too exquisite, reaching an almost unbelievable level.

Before he could react further, a series of rapid changes began within his body.

Xu Yunfan's spine suddenly emitted three crisp cracks, as if someone had flicked his tailbone three times, causing him to spring up like a startled cat, his entire body breaking out in goosebumps.

As the mountain wind in the morning mist swept over his sweat-drenched back, he was startled to realize that his skin could clearly distinguish the temperature differences of each wisp of wind. The coldest came from the dew on the pine needles at the bottom of the cliff, the slightly warmer ones carried the moisture from the mountain stream to the east, and the warmest wisp clearly carried the scent of his own freshly evaporated sweat.

This was the resonance of skin, muscle, and bone achieved after the initial success of the External Three Unifications, allowing him to distinguish the wind by listening.

He tried twisting his waist and hips, and his right fist unconsciously formed the starting stance of the Golden Bell Pounder. The deltoid of his upper arm and the external oblique muscles of his waist tensed simultaneously. The action of his heel grinding the bluestone actually caused the fascia of his entire leg to tremble like a bowstring.

This was not a simple increase in strength, but the first time the arrangement of his bones, the direction of his tendons, and the tension of his skin had achieved precise coordination.

*Crack!*

The fist he threw stopped abruptly half an inch from the old pine at the cliff's edge, but the bark was shaken loose and fell in three pieces.

Xu Yunfan stared at the bulging veins on his forearm; the blue-purple patterns now formed a geometric pattern with the texture of his muscles.

He finally understood what his master, Zhan Yan, meant when he described the state of the External Three Unifications as "the opening and closing of sinews and bone is the flow of internal qi."

Xu Yunfan himself didn't notice that when he had tested his move earlier, his legs had already moved within a tiny space with steps precise to the extreme.

The most marvelous thing was that his knees had no soreness whatsoever, as if the connection points between bones had been re-polished. Every protrusion of bone perfectly fit into the depressions of the muscle groups.

When he tore open his sweat-soaked shirt, the back muscles revealed in the morning light resembled the unfolded wings of a bird of prey.

However, this wasn't the deliberately sculpted blocky muscle of a bodybuilder, but rather the streamlined arc naturally formed by the extension of the trapezius and latissimus dorsi. Every muscle groove subtly conformed to the optimal path for force transmission during exertion.

As the mountain wind swept up gravel and struck his lower back, Xu Yunfan suddenly spun and kicked out with his left leg.

The flying gravel exploded into powder mid-air. It wasn't shattered by force, but rather by the special frequency generated by the friction between the sharp edges of his tibia and the air.

This was the self-vibrating tremor of the Cicada Strength Bone Refining perfection!

This discovery made his pupils contract. Had the External Three Unifications境界 (Realm) actually weaponized the body to such an extent?

Xu Yunfan leaped down the seven-zhang high cliff. When he landed, his feet formed a "Not Ding, Not Ba" stance. The thirty-seven pine needles kicked up hovered exactly half a foot around him.

This wasn't any kind of protective aura, but rather his skin keenly capturing changes in airflow, causing his muscles to automatically adjust to dissipate the force.

A new world!

As the memories of practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Technique flowed into his mind like a babbling brook, Xu Yunfan seemed to lift a leaf blocking his eye and re-recognize his own body.

In the past, when he出手 (made a move), he had unknowingly wasted a great deal of strength in his everyday movements.

It was a very wondrous feeling.

Xu Yunfan even felt he had entered a state of confusion, thinking he had activated the "Lin" character state.

After a long while, he let out a soft breath, his expression filled with joy.

The External Three Unifications Realm—next, as long as he perfectly integrates the three trainings of sinews, bone, and skin, his blood energy will naturally flow like water, spontaneously stepping into the realm of flesh.

And then stepping into the Flesh Refining Realm!

When he returned to the Heavenly Work Fortress and walked into the Casting Hall, Zhan Yan waved him over.

"You've arrived at just the right time."

"Master!"

Xu Yunfan bowed formally and stood beside Fu Jin.

Seeing this scene, Zhan Yan's eyes revealed an undisguised appreciation. He glanced down at the dense crowd of Casting Hall disciples below. Many familiar faces from the past were gone, replaced by many young, tender ones.

Zhan Yan sighed inwardly, but his expression remained unchanged as he said, "The sect has made its decision this morning. After nightfall, we will begin moving out of the sect, heading for the Ghost Weeping Abyss in Lingnan!"

After all instructions were completed and the disciples had dispersed, Zhan Yan watched Xu Yunfan turn to enter the room, a hint of a smile appearing in his eyes.

"Yunfan, what are you going to do?"

Xu Yunfan was a bit confused. "Of course, I'm going to pack my things. Master, are you all ready?"

Fu Jin stood to the side with a teasing look, waving his hand. "What is there to prepare? Just watch."

As he spoke, he looked up at the dome of the Heavenly Work Fortress with eager anticipation.

"I've been here for over thirty years, but I've never seen such a scene."

"Don't say you haven't; I want to see it too. The Heavenly Work Cave has stood for a thousand years. With the accumulation of generations of ancestors, just what kind of miracle can they forge?"

Xu Yunfan instantly realized, his expression shocked.

"You mean... the entire Heavenly Work City... can move?!"

Zhan Yan's knuckles scraped against the bluestone wall of the Casting Hall, revealing a hidden compartment. He reached in and pulled a lever down. The mountain wall suddenly split open, revealing twelve gaps where gears meshed. They began to turn slowly with Zhan Yan's action, then gradually sped up.

"The seventy-sixth generation of ancestors of the Heavenly Work Cave spent nine hundred years hollowing out Guniu Mountain. Generations of ancestors, exerting their hearts and minds, step by step transformed the Heavenly Work City into a Mobile Fortress."

Past the hour of Zi (midnight), Mo Han's expression was solemn. After receiving the signal that all halls and departments had completed their checks, he inserted his prosthetic limb into the main control panel.

The armillary sphere suddenly emitted a blinding light. The twelve-layered Xuan Steel Lotus City Walls, like a blooming lotus, were currently rotating and reassembling along eighty-eight concentric circular trajectories, interlocking and clasping tightly.

The moment the midnight bell rang, seventy-two steam valves simultaneously vented white smoke. It was like a ground dragon overturning; the rumbling of Guniu Mountain splitting apart startled birds for a hundred miles.

The base of the Heavenly Work Fortress tore free from the earth's veins. Three hundred and sixty tungsten steel ground nails, like a swarm of locusts leaving the bowstring, pulverized the沿途 (passing) hills into dust. Xu Yunfan steadied himself against a trembling pillar and looked through the Xuan Steel observation window at the mountains and earth continuously shrinking below.

(Completed ten thousand words today. I wonder if everyone likes this method of moving the sect.)
