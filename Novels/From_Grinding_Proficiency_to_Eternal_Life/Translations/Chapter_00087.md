# Chapter 87: The Wind Rises

That evening, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged by the cold pool.

His legs trembled continuously, the great sinews throughout his body taut like bowstrings, emitting a fine trembling sound.

*Crack!*

With a light sound, Xu Yunfan’s thigh suddenly elongated by an inch. Fine beads of sweat seeped from his forehead, yet he gritted his teeth and persisted. This kind of pain was difficult for an ordinary person to endure, but for him, it brought a feeling of pain mixed with pleasure.

The *Sky Cicada Strength* had an unexpectedly supportive effect on the cultivation of the *Flying Leg* technique, a great sinew-refining art.

Night fell, and deep into the night, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged in the meditation room.

He formed the Seal of the Word 'Lin' with his hands, recited the 'Supreme Good is Like Water' heart mantra, and the Qi around his body gradually calmed. The self-spirit within his mind was born naturally, settling in the center of the Sea of Consciousness.

Xu Yunfan spent almost every day like this. Chen Tiangang was truly amazed by Xu Yunfan's diligence.

"With such talent and such diligence in martial arts. If only your Eldest Senior Brother had half of Xu Yunfan's diligence, he would have already achieved the External Three Unions and become a Great Martial Master long ago."

At the edge of the training grounds, Chen Tiangang was filled with emotion.

Beside him, Chu Xuan's expression was also shaken. Over the past month, she had personally witnessed Xu Yunfan training in martial arts without the slightest懈怠 (slackness).

He rose earlier than the rooster and slept later than the dog.

"Simply inhuman."

"Hmph."

Chen Tiangang glanced at the incredulous Chu Xuan and snorted lightly. "If you had one-third of Yunfan's hardship, you wouldn't still be stuck at the First Level of a Martial Master."

"Dad~"

Chu Xuan acted coquettishly. "Why are you dragging me into this?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped, glanced at Chen Tiangang, cupped his fist in salute, and then returned to his solitary courtyard to continue training.

With these two watching from the side, he felt somewhat uncomfortable. Moreover, since the incident in the Transmission Cave, Chen Tiangang seemed to have ulterior motives. Who knows why he was doing this.

Naturally, a hint of vigilance rose in his heart.

Seven days later, the Wuzhou Army Camp.

Ning Wuque stroked the blood groove on the sword blade, the sharp voice of the supervising eunuch echoing in his ears.

"The one hundred thousand Tiger Guards in Black Armor have already passed Tianmen Gorge. The Incense Fire Sect is merely an excuse. Now that His Majesty has ascended the throne, he naturally wants the world to be peaceful and prosperous, to reopen the golden age. The world has suffered under the sects for too long. If you do not join..."

He looked out at the endless stretches of military camps outside the tent and suddenly realized that the camps of the experts from various sects were surrounded by the one hundred thousand Tiger Guards in Black Armor. If there was the slightest movement, elite soldiers from all directions would swarm in formation to slaughter them completely.

One or two, or even a dozen or twenty Tiger Guards in Black Armor were not to be feared, but if a hundred or a thousand living-blood martial artists clad in armor and wielding weapons swarmed in formation, even the Muscle Refining Realm would have to kneel.

The supervising eunuch, bearing the Emperor's command, had come to sweep clean the Five Ridges and Seven Mountains of Wuzhou.

"Destroying mountains and smashing temples..."

Ning Wuque's heart turned ice-cold.

He suddenly turned his head, looking in the direction of Thunder Accumulation Mountain. In his gloomy gaze, a strange crimson flashed.

"Master..."

Cold sweat seeped from his clenched fist. He suddenly remembered Chu Xuan's words before he left: "The Sky Silkworm Cocoon should be given to Xu Yunfan."

The dragon patterns on the sword handle suddenly grew hot, and an indescribable throbbing arose from deep within his body.

That day, the disciples of the sect remained sleepless all night, vigilantly watching the spear-forested Black Armor troops on all sides.

These one hundred thousand Tiger Guards in Black Armor arrived in Wuzhou and completely ignored the Incense Fire Sect causing chaos throughout Wuzhou; instead, they turned their blades against the thirteen sects of Wuzhou.

Xu Yunfan surfaced from the depths of the cold pool, the water rippling finely.

Stripes of blood marks burst open from his back muscles, actually forming fine, dense blood lines that seemed to crawl and writhe like earthworms under the pressure of his muscles.

*Your Sky Cicada Strength has reached Minor Completion.*

*Sky Cicada Strength 0/1000 (Minor Completion) Special Effect: Bone strength condenses, breath nourishes and strengthens bones, sinews move with bones, bone tremor generates power, bone strength begins to bloom, nourish bones and solidify foundation, bones relax and sinews become flexible.*

In an instant, the bones throughout his body suddenly erupted with a dense cicada cry.

The sound was initially faint as a mosquito, gradually surging like a tide, and finally roaring like thunder.

*Crack!*

He clearly felt that the bones inside his body were undergoing some sort of qualitative change.

Fine cicada wing patterns appeared on the surface of the originally hard bones. These patterns were not static but undulated with his breathing, pulsing like living things.

Xu Yunfan lowered his head to look at his arm, seeing the dark red blood lines moving like snakes under his skin.

He gently clenched his fist, and his bones emitted a dense cracking sound. His muscles twisted like dragons, and his veins bulged like writhing earthworms.

The *Sky Cicada Strength* was extremely marvelous. Without the assistance of special secret medicines, it was impossible to train to this level.

Just then, a series of scenes suddenly surfaced in Xu Yunfan's mind. The system was generating a cultivation segment in his mind.

In the画面 (picture/image), a blurry figure was practicing the *Sky Cicada Strength*. The figure's arms stretched out, bones emitted dense cracking sounds, the muscles around his body twisted like dragons, and dark red blood lines moved like snakes under his skin.

Day and night, he swallowed secret medicines and washed his body with the lost Thunder Cicada Juice of the Sky Cicada Sect.

Until one day, the blurry figure in the画面 (picture/image) suddenly turned around and threw a punch.

The howling of the fist wind actually formed visible ripples in the air. The black iron pillar trembled violently, and the surface was covered with dense fist imprints.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan threw a punch. As his bones and sinews trembled, a cicada cry rang out. At high frequency, his fist instantly punched out eighteen times.

"You've reached Minor Completion in Sky Cicada Strength?"

Chen Tiangang's voice suddenly came from behind, carrying an indescribable excitement.

Xu Yunfan turned back to look at his master, who had originally just been somewhat paranoid. In the shadows, his facial contours appeared exceptionally gloomy.

"I succeeded by luck. If my bones, sinews, and skin hadn't already reached Great Completion previously, it probably wouldn't have been so smooth."

Xu Yunfan cupped his fist in salute, keenly noticing that Chen Tiangang's hand holding the cane was trembling slightly.

As Chen Tiangang approached, a foul stench rushed over him. Xu Yunfan's nostrils flared slightly.

The smell was like the stench of old corpses, mixed with the bitterness of some medicinal herb.

He noticed that the bandage at the break on Chen Tiangang's right leg had already turned black, oozing dark red pus and blood.

"Good, good, good..."

A smile appeared on Chen Tiangang's face as he nodded slightly. "Once your Sky Cicada Strength reaches Great Completion, I will give you the Sky Cicada Clothes technique to look at first."

"Thank you, Master!"

As soon as Xu Yunfan finished speaking, Chen Tiangang suddenly began to cough violently. His thin, dry hand covered his mouth, and black blood seeped through his fingers.

"Hmm, I need to go into seclusion for a while to clean up my wounds."

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted. Just as he was about to seize the opportunity to ask how the wound came about, Chen Tiangang waved his hand and quickly disappeared into the forest.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were inscrutable. Chen Tiangang was being overly enthusiastic toward him. Under the support of the mental state from the Word 'Lin' Mantra, he could extremely sensitively detect that behind Chen Tiangang's concerned gaze lay a hint of urgency.

In the following days, the disciples led by Ning Wuque sent back news, stating that everything was going well. The army advanced with unstoppable momentum, and the chaos caused by the Incense Fire Sect was quickly quelled, making the atmosphere in the entire Sky Cicada Sect relax somewhat.
