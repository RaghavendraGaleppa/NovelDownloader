Chapter 174: The Buddha

"Hiss... hiss..."

The person opened their mouth, emitting an inexplicable roar, a wisp of black smoke rising from within.

Blood rain continued to fall. It slid off Zhou Tian and the winged creature, but seeped into the strange person before them. Their withered body gradually plumped up, and the green glow in their eyes intensified.

The scene was eerie. Chills pierced Zhou Tian's heart. Knowing he couldn't stay, he activated his Teleportation skill to its maximum range, now three thousand three hundred meters.

However, the strange person's green eyes flashed, their body instantly dissolving into streams of black mist that swiftly permeated the entire land.

Zhou Tian had just appeared in an area covered in blood-red trees. As he was about to teleport again, he felt a sudden chill. The black mist swept over his body, and then... there was no then...

The winged creature, enveloped in the black mist, looked extremely grim. Its incomplete wings covered its body, and golden runes emerged to resist the mist's erosion, but the runes were constantly being worn away.

A moment later, the black mist retracted, and the cassock-clad person reappeared. Without the mist's shroud, the winged creature's expression grew even more solemn. The long sword in its hand glowed with silver light.

*Whoosh!*

The strange, cassock-clad being suddenly vanished from its spot. The winged creature's face changed. Its long sword instantly swung horizontally, and simultaneously, it unleashed a secret technique, igniting a golden aura around its body. This was a unique secret art of its clan, possessing powerful evil-suppressing force.

*Clang!*

A string of sparks erupted from the long sword. It was the cassock-clad being's withered hands fiercely gripping the sword. It was a collision of flesh and metal, yet it produced a series of sparks, which was utterly inconceivable.

The cassock-clad being was scorched by the golden aura extending from the winged creature, but felt no pain. Its withered fingers tightened their grip on the sword.

*Crack!*

The long sword was directly crushed, fragments scattering. The winged creature coughed up a mouthful of blood. The sword was connected to its mind; its destruction caused damage to both its body and spirit.

The blood sprayed onto the cassock-clad being and was absorbed in a bizarre manner. The cassock-clad being's hand, like a sword, lunged out again. Though withered, it struck like a peerless sharp blade.

Ignoring its injuries, the winged creature flapped its remaining wings, shielding itself. At the same time, it used a divine ability, runes surging to form golden divine chains, attempting to block the attack.

*Splish!*

The wings were pierced, the divine chains shattered. The cassock-clad being's withered hand pulled out a still-beating golden heart from the winged creature's chest. With a fierce squeeze, the golden heart burst, yet not a single drop of its flowing blood was lost; all was absorbed.

Green light flickered in the cassock-clad being's eyes. It opened its large mouth and swallowed the entire winged creature whole. A trace of blood seeped from the corner of its mouth, which it then licked back.

It scanned its surroundings, its nose twitching, as if searching for something. Its form flickered, and it vanished from its spot.

The blood rain did not fall indefinitely; it stopped at a certain point. At that time, the entire world turned blood-red, and the blood-colored creatures even began to cannibalize each other, preying for nutrients.

Time slowly passed. After an unknown duration, a figure abruptly appeared at the location where Zhou Tian had been swallowed by the black mist.

The moment this figure appeared, the entire world seemed to echo with a Buddhist chant. Heaven and earth vibrated, the blood-color instantly receded, and vast clear skies, green mountains, and flowing waters reappeared.

"The Buddhist Kingdom has reappeared," Zhou Tian, who had just revived, murmured to himself, as if understanding something. This place cycled between the Buddhist Kingdom and Yin City. When they first entered this tomb, it was precisely when Yin City had manifested.

"Benefactor!"

"Who's there?!"

Zhou Tian, deep in thought, was startled by the sudden voice. He looked around and saw a monk approaching not far away. The monk's gleaming bald head almost blinded him.

The monk appeared slightly aged, with white eyebrows and beard, and a peaceful smile on his face. But what made Zhou Tian's pupils contract was the purple-gold cassock he wore.

He had just seen it yesterday, worn by that strange creature. Zhou Tian didn't ponder too much; he simply teleported away. Forget everything else, just run first.

That black mist yesterday had ensnared him. "You're too fake! How did it spread so far instantly? I couldn't even defend myself. After all, this kind of corrosive attack can't be absorbed by attack sealing, because corrosion is equivalent to being attacked millions of times every single instant."

"Benefactor! Why are you running?" The voice came from beside his ear. The old monk followed step by step, matching his pace. Zhou Tian felt helpless. No matter how he ran, the old monk could keep up, just like facing a Saint Devil.

This Teleportation skill seemed amazing, but it was actually not very useful against true experts. Heavenly Kings, Dao Lords—who among them couldn't travel thousands of miles with a single thought? Its only real utility was ignoring seals.

"Excuse me, Master, do you need something from me?" Zhou Tian stopped. Facing this old monk, who seemed much more normal than yesterday, he wondered what his purpose was.

"Benefactor, I saw you were naked here, so I specially brought you clothes," the old monk said with a smile, taking out a red cassock and handing it to Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian looked down. His clothes had been corroded yesterday, and he was indeed naked. He hadn't expected to encounter such a kind-hearted old man in this situation. He immediately said, "No need to trouble yourself, Master. I just happen to like not wearing clothes."

The old monk seemed not to have expected this answer. He put away the cassock, pressed his palms together, sighed, and said, "As expected of someone who could escape my demonic nature. Truly unique, just like my master, never caring about worldly gazes."

The amount of information contained in that sentence was significant. Zhou Tian processed it: "Escaped *my* demonic nature"? This meant yesterday's creature was his demonic nature. And a monk here, his master was most likely Wutian.

Though he had made a guess, Zhou Tian still asked, "Master, who is your master?"

The old monk showed a complex expression. Facing the colossal phantom of a Buddha, he bowed slightly and said respectfully, "My master is none other than Wutian... the Buddha!"

"The Buddha?" Zhou Tian was stunned. The Saint Devil had explained to him that the title "Buddha" was not something any Buddha could casually possess. In the ancient Buddhist realm, only the head of all Buddhas could become the Buddha. Even a Heavenly Venerate-level Buddha might not be qualified to be called the Buddha.

"It seems Benefactor's origins are also extraordinary. You seem to know much about my Buddhist realm," the old monk said with a slight smile, having detected Zhou Tian's surprise.
