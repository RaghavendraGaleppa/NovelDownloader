**Chapter 10: Second Choice**

Seeing the man pointing, the youth's brow subtly furrowed, and *Displeasure* instantly appeared above his head. He immediately reached out, wanting to retrieve the pill bottle.

The middle-aged cultivator's expression flickered, but he pulled his hand back, then suddenly spoke again:

"Although the quality of your pills isn't top-grade, it's not bad. It's not easy for a young child like you to sell pills. How about this, I'm willing to buy this bottle of Linghua Pills from you at a price of one hundred spirit stones more than ordinary low-grade spirit pills."

What a character! Yang Ji saw *Surprise* and *Such top-grade low-grade spirit pills with extremely few impurities are rare, I must find a way to get them* clearly displayed above the middle-aged cultivator's head, yet his words belied his true thoughts.

An ordinary child would surely be startled and confused by him, but the youth before him was clearly out of the ordinary, as could be seen from his composed and calm demeanor.

"My master said that this bottle of Linghua Pills sells for five hundred spirit stones, no bargaining. I also dare not presume to change the price on my own, otherwise, I will surely be punished by him when I return. I am truly sorry."

The youth scratched his head, looking troubled.

Little did he know, in Yang Ji's view, the subtle changes in his demeanor were already displayed above his head: *"Hmph, do you really take me for a child? These are pills personally refined by my master, how could I let you buy them for three hundred spirit stones? Ordinarily, you wouldn't even be able to buy them if you wanted to. If you want cheap, go eat those low-grade pills full of impurities. Hmph hmph, let the pill poison accumulate in your body, be careful it doesn't poison you to death."*

Saying this, he extended his palm, ready to take back the pill bottle.

The middle-aged cultivator hesitated slightly, with *Hesitation* and *Buy?* appearing above his head, followed by: *"But five hundred spirit stones are enough to buy two bottles of ordinary low-grade spirit pills. Although this bottle of Linghua Pills contains purer spiritual energy and can accelerate cultivation, it's only one bottle, far less than the amount of spiritual energy provided by two bottles of ordinary low-grade spirit pills. It's not worth it, not worth it."*

After an internal struggle, the middle-aged cultivator also frowned, a strange glint in his eyes, and said: "You only have this one bottle of Linghua Pills? If you can produce another bottle, I'll buy them both."

"I only have this one, do you want it?" the youth asked.

The middle-aged cultivator stared at the youth's pure eyes for a long while. Seeing that he didn't seem to be lying, he somewhat reluctantly handed the pill bottle back to him.

"Let me see the pill!" At this moment, Yang Ji said with a smile.

"Alright, fellow Daoist, here!" Seeing that Yang Ji was the first person to inquire with him, the youth readily handed over the pill bottle.

Yang Ji took the pill bottle, and with a glance, saw the information display: "Linghua Pill, Low-grade Spirit Pill, top-tier quality, contains extremely few impurities, can be safely refined and absorbed, no need to worry about pill poison accumulating in the body."

He had eaten Linghua Pills before. The ones his master used to give him were mostly Linghua Pills and Pei Yuan Pills.

But those were inferior low-grade spirit pills with more impurities, their quality vastly inferior to the Linghua Pills before him.

Neither the color, nor the shape, nor the pill fragrance could compare.

Looking at these plump, round, and translucent pills, Yang Ji smiled: "The pills are well refined. They are indeed top-tier quality low-grade spirit pills, with only a trace of impurities remaining. I think five hundred spirit stones is quite worth it."

"Fellow Daoist has good discernment. My master is Master Hegou, and pills from his hand are bound to be extraordinary!" Hearing such praise, the youth also beamed with joy and responded, a hint of pride in his eyes.

What?

Master Hegou?

Upon hearing this, everyone immediately became polite, repeatedly asking: "Is the Master Hegou that young friend mentioned the chief alchemist of the Mo Family's shop?"

"Exactly!" the youth said with pride.

"Master Hegou being able to refine top-tier low-grade spirit pills, doesn't that mean his alchemy attainment has reached another level, already reaching the Peak Alchemist stage, just a step away from becoming an Alchemy Master?"

Alchemy Master?

Yang Ji was somewhat moved.

Although the alchemy profession was profitable, achieving success in the Dao of Alchemy was actually very difficult.

To refine pills, the four most important conditions were materials, fire source, control, and alchemy experience.

Materials were naturally various spirit herbs. Alchemists were not gods; without spirit herbs, they were like a clever cook without rice.

To become an alchemist, a large amount of spirit herbs for trial and error and practice were needed in the early stages. This luxurious step alone stumped ninety percent of cultivators.

Second was the fire source, which referred to the flames required for refining pills.

Generally, there were two types of fire: one was flames produced by one's own fire-attribute cultivation techniques, and the other was Heaven-Earth Spirit Fire born between heaven and earth.

The latter was hard to find but was the optimal choice for refining pills.

Not only would the pill refining success rate be much higher, but the pills refined would also be better than those refined with flames produced by cultivation techniques.

The medicinal efficacy would be stronger, purer, and with fewer impurities.

Refining a batch of pills was a lengthy process, taking three to five days per batch. If one only used cultivation techniques to produce flames, they would quickly run out of energy, making it difficult to form pills.

Even if one could sustain it, flames produced by cultivation techniques were far inferior to Heaven-Earth Spirit Fire.

It wasn't that the flames weren't strong enough, but that they lacked spiritual charm. The spiritual energy bestowed upon Spirit Fires by heaven and earth was the fundamental reason for increasing the pill formation rate.

Spirit herbs could only fully melt within a Spirit Fire while ensuring their medicinal potency wasn't lost, and impurities could be maximized for removal. This was something ordinary flames couldn't compare to.

Possessing a Spirit Fire allowed one to go further on the path of alchemy.

Additionally, two more points were required for alchemy: alchemy experience and control.

During pill refining, temperature control was of utmost importance.

Sometimes, just a slightly heavier hand with the heat would turn the entire batch of pills into ash. Therefore, mastering temperature control was a skill every alchemist must possess.

As for alchemy experience, there was no need for much elaboration; it simply required a guiding master or books containing various alchemy experiences.

Under these various stringent conditions, very few people were qualified to become Alchemy Masters.

With fewer Alchemy Masters, high-quality pills containing fewer impurities were naturally exceedingly rare.

Rarity makes something precious, and thus it created the esteemed, even somewhat distorted, status and identity of Alchemy Masters.

Looking across the entire Thousand Islands Sea Region, there were many junior alchemists capable of refining low-grade spirit pills.

However, there were no more than five thousand Peak Alchemists capable of refining top-tier low-grade spirit pills.

Alchemy Masters capable of refining mid-grade spirit pills were even fewer, just over a thousand.

Alchemy Grandmasters capable of refining high-grade spirit pills were only a little over a hundred.

As for Great Alchemy Grandmasters capable of refining precious pills, there were only a mere three in the entire Thousand Islands Sea Region.

From this, one could see the difficulty of the Dao of Alchemy; achieving success was truly arduous.

Compared to this, encountering a bottle of pills personally refined by a Peak Alchemist today seemed especially precious.

No wonder the youth said that ordinarily, they wouldn't even be able to get them if they wanted.

Yang Ji instantly understood the meaning of his words.

Without significant monetary gain, a Peak Alchemist would certainly not act easily.

Everyone's heart was clear; it seemed Master Hegou had advanced from an advanced alchemist to a Peak Alchemist, and sent his young disciple out to indirectly promote it.

The reason there was only one bottle was perhaps because he had just successfully refined this one bottle and was impatiently showing it off.

At this moment, Master Hegou might even be proudly watching this scene from somewhere.
