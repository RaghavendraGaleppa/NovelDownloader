# Chapter 114: The Altar Purification Envoy

During the appointment ceremony, the Sect Master explained the distinctions between the four types of envoys to those present.

The Combat Envoy, Discipline Envoy, and Protector Envoy were respectively responsible for external campaigns, overseeing punishments, and territorial patrols—essentially representing expansion, supervision, and defense divisions.

The Altar Purification Envoy was even simpler. It didn't mean feasting at banquets but rather entailed "dissemination" and "collection." 

To elaborate, it involved spreading batches of Black Lotus Buddha statues among the populace to establish mortal worship and incense offerings, encouraging men, women, and children to venerate them. Every twenty years, the statues would be reclaimed, and new ones distributed in their place—effectively a cyclical harvest.

The Altar Purification Envoy didn't engage in combat but also held no real authority, serving merely as a logistical tool.

"Altar purification" meant leaving no Black Lotus Buddha statue unaccounted for in the mortal realm and wasting not a single drop of the people's worship. Their motto was: "Leave nothing behind!"

However, in this vast, top-tier sect, resource allocation and benefits were tied to contributions and merits. Those who risked life and limb naturally earned far greater rewards than those who idly proselytized from the safety of the rear.

When the six Golden Core cultivators of the local faction, including Yan Yuanchun, heard that their Foundation Establishment disciples had been appointed as Altar Purification Envoys, their expressions darkened, and they couldn't help but voice their protests.

"Elder Sect Brother, isn't this too frivolous?"

"Such an arrangement is unfair!"

"Elder Sect Brother, reconsider!"

One Golden Core cultivator even spoke with thinly veiled hostility. 

"Could it be that you harbor private motives, looking down on our local faction while favoring those from your Lu Kingdom origins, deliberately suppressing us?"

The atmosphere in the hall instantly grew tense, with the local faction cultivators subtly aligning against the Lu Kingdom faction.

The position of Altar Purification Envoy was simply too lackluster—devoid of real power and resource allocation, it was a blatant dead-end role. It effectively removed their Foundation Establishment subordinates from the power struggle, leaving the Golden Core protectors without support.

Power equated to resources, and in the cultivation world, resources were paramount. 

A Golden Core protector's authority was one thing, but the strength of their subordinates was another. Without a faction, how could they compete for power and resources within the sect?

Moreover, with the imminent demonic war on the horizon, this was the perfect opportunity to distinguish oneself. Once the sect's headquarters was reestablished, the redistribution of resources in the Great Song Dynasty would undoubtedly be based on military achievements.

Not only were the local Golden Core protectors dissatisfied, but the Foundation Establishment disciples in the hall also resented the decision. Being assigned to a marginal logistical role meant fewer resources and benefits, hindering their advancement and cultivation.

With their personal interests at stake, everyone voiced their opposition, and the hall quickly descended into chaos.

However, one person stood apart—outwardly blending in but secretly delighted.

That person was Lin Shan, who had originally harbored ulterior motives.

Altar Purification Envoy? So that's what it meant.

Perfect!

This role was practically tailor-made for him.

The cycle of sowing and reaping was exactly the life he yearned for!

Not only would he avoid the life-threatening risks of searching for Black Lotus Buddha statues within the sect, but he could also wait for the twenty-year harvest to rake in ancient essence. It was a dream come true!

But with the local faction cultivators in an uproar, he dared not stand out. He merely raised a fist half-heartedly and muttered a few weak protests before shrinking back.

Luan Chun, however, was different. The young girl's face flushed with indignation as she loudly protested, even finding time to scorn Lin Shan.

"Our elders are right there! What are you afraid of?"

"Join us in opposing this!"

"Do you actually want to be an Altar Purification Envoy?"

Lin Shan shrank his neck timidly and mumbled, "Of course not! But the Sect Master's decision is final. Objecting won't change anything."

His excuse turned out to be unexpectedly prescient—a stroke of luck.

The Sect Master on the podium refused to entertain any dissent, and with over a dozen Golden Core protectors from the Lu Kingdom faction present—outnumbering the local faction—the decision was put to a vote. The majority ruled.

After all, there were only so many positions and resources to go around.

As the beneficiaries, why would the Lu Kingdom faction willingly surrender their advantages to the local faction? In their eyes, they were the backbone of the Black Lotus Sect.

The Sect Master harbored no personal bias, but his position demanded he consider the bigger picture. From every angle, the Lu Kingdom faction was more trustworthy, and with the impending war against the orthodox sects of the Great Song, they would be the main force.

Moreover, the Lu Kingdom faction wasn't limited to the dozen or so Golden Core protectors present. Many more were either en route or already deployed across the Eastern Sea.

There were even Nascent Soul elders from various factions keeping watch. How could he dare undermine their influence? That would be tantamount to self-sabotage.

In the end, the Golden Core cultivators voted, and the outnumbered local faction had no choice but to accept the arrangement.

The hall finally quieted, and the Foundation Establishment disciples below fell silent. With the higher-ups' decision made, further opposition was futile.

Luan Chun shot Lin Shan a resentful glare. "Jinx!"

Lin Shan wore a bitter expression, sighing mournfully—but inwardly, he was overjoyed.

Joining the Black Lotus Sect had been the right move. Everything was falling into place!

He could already envision himself swimming in a sea of Black Lotus Buddha statues, ancient essence pouring into his enhancement panel. He would strengthen his divine abilities and magic treasures into immortal arts and artifacts, dominating the cultivation world!

Eventually, he would take control of the Black Lotus Sect, spreading its teachings across the land and becoming a fearsome demonic sect leader.

The world would bow beneath his indoctrination, bathed in the light of Black Lotus worship. Standing atop a mountain, he would raise his voice in triumph, and countless followers would chant in unison: "Ura!"

The mere thought was exhilarating!

But now wasn't the time for daydreaming. The Sect Master and the protectors were still outlining their plans.

"For now, the Altar Purification Envoys will begin proselytizing on the islands of the Eastern Sea. The mission will last one year, after which the Discipline Envoys will conduct inspections."

"Assess the depth of the people's faith, estimate the twenty-year incense offering yield, and document the results."

"Different envoys will rotate regions for statue reclamation to prevent embezzlement."

"Unauthorized retention of incense offerings or deliberate destruction of statues is strictly prohibited. Violators will have their cultivation crippled, and in severe cases, their souls refined!"

"The incense supervision system will be jointly managed by the Nascent Soul elders and the thirty-eight Golden Core protectors of the Discipline lineage to ensure proper handling."

...

Clearly, the Black Lotus Sect, as an ancient institution, had a meticulous and well-established system.

The oversight mechanisms were particularly rigorous, leaving no loopholes for exploitation!

Lin Shan's heart grew heavier with each word, sinking into icy despair by the end.

"Damn it! Do you have to be this thorough?"

"You're just a cult!"

"Is this level of surveillance really necessary?"

"Is this really a demonic sect?"

A barrage of questions flooded his mind. No matter how he racked his brain, he couldn't figure out how to secretly siphon ancient essence.

Any attempt would invite scrutiny from the Discipline lineage—from the Nascent Soul elders down to the thirty-eight Golden Core protectors.

If he made a one-time grab and fled, he'd be branded a traitor, pursued relentlessly by the entire Black Lotus Sect.

Then it wouldn't just be the Discipline lineage—he'd face the full might of this demonic sect, with multiple Nascent Soul elders and hundreds of Golden Core cultivators hunting him, supported by countless Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation disciples scouring the land.

"I'm only at the early Foundation Establishment stage! This is way too hard!"

Lin Shan lamented inwardly, realizing he needed to tread carefully. Who knew the Black Lotus Sect would be like this? Now that he was in, he had no choice but to play along—one step at a time.
