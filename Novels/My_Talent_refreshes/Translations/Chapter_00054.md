# Chapter 54: Promotion Assessment – Cultivating Blood Sandalwood  

The promotion assessment for Zone C was held in one of its medium-grade spirit fields.  

Unlike Zone D, Zone C had no low-grade spirit fields—its medium-grade fields were already slightly superior to Zone D's high-grade ones.  

By the time Chu Ning and the other two arrived, dozens of people had already gathered in the field.  

To Chu Ning's slight surprise, Cao Dongxin and Shang Zhaoxiang were also present.  

But upon reflection, it made sense. Both had been at the fifth level of Qi Refining for quite some time.  

Clearly, making significant progress in Zone D wasn't easy, so it was natural for them to take a chance and try for better resources in Zone C.  

Chu Ning's appearance also surprised the two. Cao Dongxin maintained his usual sour expression, while Shang Zhaoxiang gave him a faint smile from a distance, though they didn't exchange words.  

After Chu Ning and his companions arrived, more people trickled in, eventually totaling nearly a hundred.  

Evidently, Chu Ning wasn't the only one seeking better opportunities.  

After a short wait, He Changyou arrived with several duty disciples from the Spirit Plantation Hall, including Zhuang Yunde.  

"You're all here for the promotion assessment, so I'll keep it brief," He Changyou said. "The test is simple.  

"Each of you will receive a Blood Sandalwood seed. The top six performers in terms of growth quality within half a day will be promoted."  

As soon as He Changyou finished speaking, many in the field paled—Cao Dongxin and Shang Zhaoxiang among them.  

Blood Sandalwood was notoriously difficult to cultivate, often taking years to mature. Yet He Changyou was giving them only half a day.  

Without further explanation, He Changyou signaled the duty disciples to distribute the seeds.  

After receiving the dark-red Blood Sandalwood seeds, the examinees spread out, each standing five zhang apart to avoid interfering with one another's spellcasting.  

Once everyone was in position, He Changyou waved his hand.  

"Begin!"  

Nearly a hundred people sprang into action.  

Over the past half-month, Chu Ning had familiarized himself with the spirit plants suitable for Zone C, including Blood Sandalwood.  

He buried the seed about a finger's depth into the soil and sat cross-legged beside it.  

**Growth Spell—Instant Cast!**  

Without any hand seals, he flicked his wrist, sending a spell directly into the soil where the seed lay.  

Among the examinees, only a few could cast the Growth Spell instantly.  

Cao Dongxin and others were still forming hand seals to gather spiritual energy.  

Chu Ning's instant casting gave him a slight head start, though the advantage seemed negligible at first.  

But with repeated castings, the cumulative effect became significant.  

For Chu Ning, instant casting wasn't just about speed—it conserved spiritual energy while enhancing the spell's potency.  

As the first spell's energy fully infused the seed, Chu Ning immediately cast a second, then a third, a fourth…  

Blood Sandalwood was the most challenging plant he had ever tried to cultivate.  

Back when he had nurtured Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, it had taken only ten Growth Spells.  

Now, after twenty spells, the Blood Sandalwood seed finally showed signs of life—its shell cracked.  

Sensing the change through his spiritual sense, Chu Ning's heart leaped.  

He cast another Growth Spell, this time directing the energy precisely through the crack and into the seed's core.  

This was an instinctive move, honed by his recent training in Divine Sense Refinement.  

The effect was astonishing.  

The crack widened, and a tender sprout emerged, nearly breaking through the soil.  

Seizing the moment, Chu Ning cast another spell.  

The sprout surged upward, piercing the earth with astonishing vigor.  

"Hmm?"  

He Changyou was the first to notice.  

His gaze swept over, landing on Chu Ning—the first to successfully sprout the Blood Sandalwood. A flicker of surprise crossed his face.  

Soon, Zhuang Yunde and the others noticed as well, their eyes turning toward Chu Ning.  

Zhuang Yunde's initial astonishment melted into his usual cheerful grin.  

"This Junior Brother Chu never fails to surprise."  

By then, Chu Ning had risen to his feet and begun forming hand seals for the **Gentle Rain Spell**.  

Four others had also completed the sprouting phase—two men in their late twenties, along with Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang.  

All five began casting the Gentle Rain Spell simultaneously, but Chu Ning, despite starting first, now lagged behind.  

The reason was simple: the other four cast the spell instantly, while Chu Ning still needed hand seals.  

Zhuang Yunde shook his head slightly.  

Given Chu Ning's mastery in nurturing Ink Spirit Bamboo, his proficiency in the **Verdant Wood Revival Art** should have been near-instant.  

Yet he couldn't even cast the simpler Gentle Rain Spell instantly.  

Then realization dawned on Zhuang Yunde.  

Chu Ning had once mentioned his exceptional affinity for wood-element techniques like the Verdant Wood Revival Art.  

By now, all five had finished their Gentle Rain Spells.  

Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang immediately began casting the Verdant Wood Revival Art—also instantaneously.  

The same went for the other two senior disciples.  

Chu Ning wasn't far behind. Soon, he too completed the Gentle Rain Spell.  

**Instant Cast—Verdant Wood Revival Art!**  

While Chu Ning conserved his spiritual energy, he held nothing back in spellcasting.  

His instant Verdant Wood Revival Art matched the others', even surpassing them in gathering ambient spiritual energy.  

Chu Ning cast the spell over twenty times in succession, paused for half an hour, then resumed.  

The Blood Sandalwood before him grew just as vigorously as those nurtured by the four sixth-level Qi Refining disciples.  

Several hours later, He Changyou's voice rang out.  

"Time's up! Everyone, cease casting."  

At his command, Chu Ning and the others stopped.  

The promotion assessment had officially concluded.
