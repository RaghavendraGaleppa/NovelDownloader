Chapter 45: Lucky Star

Several days later, in a quiet room within the Blood Clothes Tower.

Fairy Feixia had long since gracefully departed. Lu Yang, meanwhile, sat cross-legged on a futon, beginning to study the talismanic arts inheritance he had received from his previous discussions with Fairy Feixia.

As for romantic entanglements, Lu Yang had never bothered himself with them. He knew clearly that there was no true love in the Saint Sect, only exchanges of interest. His life-saving grace was one aspect; another was that he was stationed in the market city, and even a Qi Condensation Grand Perfection cultivator couldn't deal with him, so Fairy Feixia needed his help. A further reason was that discussing demonic cultivation methods was faster. After all, the Saint Sect possessed cultivation techniques like the Grand Yin-Yang Joyful Anthem, which allowed for direct plundering of cultivation and knowledge, making it more convenient than verbal exchange.

However, if Fairy Feixia intended to leverage these few days of exchange to demand benefits from him, that would be absolutely impossible. After all, he had also taught Fairy Feixia array formations during these days. It was a clear transaction, perfectly fair!

"Talismanic arts, ah..."

As one of the hundred arts of cultivation, talismanic arts were quite sought after. After several days of in-depth exchange, Lu Yang had gained a deeper understanding of them. In his view, what were known as talismanic arts were essentially temporary miniature arrays. Although their power was far from comparable to proper arrays, they had the advantage of being portable, required no earth veins or spiritual energy for support, and had no geographical restrictions; the user only needed to inject spiritual power to activate them.

Lu Yang focused his mind and looked at the panel of the [Hundred Generations Book].

[Golden Light Talisman (Beginner), Five Thunders Talisman (Beginner), Sword Qi Talisman (Beginner), Returning Wind and Rekindled Fire Talisman (Beginner)]

Fairy Feixia had passed on a total of four talismans to him. Among them, the Golden Light Talisman, Five Thunders Talisman, and Sword Qi Talisman were relatively common, only of ninth-grade quality. Only the last one, the Returning Wind and Rekindled Fire Talisman, was a great talisman of seventh-grade. This talisman could imprint and store a cultivator's state from a certain period, and when needed, it could be overlaid to allow the cultivator to return to their peak state for a short time. For example, if you had just experienced a fierce battle, were covered in injuries, and your spiritual power was barely a tenth remaining, using this talisman at that moment would instantly restore you to a perfectly unharmed, peak spiritual power state. Although the backlash afterward would worsen your injuries by another third, it was sufficient for emergencies at critical moments. Fairy Feixia's ability to escape all the way back to the market city earlier was thanks to this talisman. To actively impart such a life-saving talisman showed that, although she harbored other intentions during this discussion and exchange, she still had some sincerity.

Of course, the effects of the Returning Wind and Rekindled Fire Talisman could not be stacked. Furthermore, due to its outstanding efficacy, its cooldown period was longer; after one use, three months had to pass before it could be used a second time.

" 'Heaven is round, Earth is square, Nine Chapters of Laws and Edicts, as I now draw, myriad spirits obey and hide.' "

Several talisman papers floated in the air. Lu Yang formed hand seals with one hand and circulated spiritual power with the other, writing on the paper. Occasionally, his spiritual power would go out of control, destroying a talisman paper. However, Lu Yang would quickly pull new talisman papers to replenish. After a long while like this, Lu Yang slowly stopped. Before him now were four talismans, each glowing with spiritual light, their colors and characters distinct.

"Success!"

Lu Yang first put away the most precious Returning Wind and Rekindled Fire Talisman. He then took the remaining three talismans into his hand, observing them closely, and suddenly an idea struck him. "Unlike the Returning Wind and Rekindled Fire Talisman, the Golden Light Talisman, Five Thunders Talisman, and Sword Qi Talisman are quite conventional. They don't actually require overly profound talismanic skills. As long as the materials are prepared and they are refined diligently, they can be mass-produced. The only problem is how to find so many people to draw talismans for you for free."

Fortunately, Lu Yang never worried about this. It just so happened that the banner spirits within the Myriad Spirits Banner had nothing to do all day. He could pass down the art of drawing talismans to them, giving them some work to pass the time. Doing this could even save him a sum of money. After all, if he hired Saint Sect disciples to draw talismans, he would have to pay them wages. As for the banner spirits... it was a joke. His willingness to give them work was already their good fortune. Want wages? Then don't blame him for laying them off!

Stepping out of the quiet room, Yun Miaoqing, who was guarding the door, brought Lu Yang an unexpected piece of news.

"Zhao Xuhe?" Lu Yang raised an eyebrow, wondering why Senior Brother Zhao would suddenly come looking for him, especially since he had been full of caution during their last conversation.

Seeing Lu Yang frown, Yun Miaoqing softly asked, "If Daoist Brother doesn't wish to see him, shall I send him away?"

"...No need." Lu Yang smiled faintly, "Let's meet him."

Soon, Zhao Xuhe was led into the reception room of the Blood Clothes Tower. Lu Yang secretly observed for a moment, found nothing amiss, and then walked in.

"Senior Brother Zhao! I've missed you so much!" Lu Yang laughed heartily and hugged Zhao Xuhe as soon as he entered, saying excitedly, "To tell you the truth, I fought too fiercely with that True Disciple from the Divine Martial Sect a while ago. Although I killed him, I was also severely injured and only recovered after a long period of recuperation. I've kept Senior Brother Zhao waiting."

"No, no..." Zhao Xuhe smiled awkwardly but politely, though his teeth were itching with vexation internally. He had seen Fairy Feixia walk out of the Blood Clothes Tower! However, his Dao heart was firm after all, and he quickly shook off the negative emotions.

"Junior Brother Lu, I've come this time with a request." Zhao Xuhe went straight to the point, saying in a deep voice, "Junior Brother, do you know about the Witch Ghost Secret Realm? News about this secret realm has been widely circulating lately..."

"Of course I know," Lu Yang nodded.

Zhao Xuhe struck while the iron was hot, saying, "To tell you the truth, I actually have some clues about the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, which might be related to a Foundation Establishment opportunity!"

"Oh." Lu Yang's bland reaction instantly made Zhao Xuhe pause. This wasn't right. In his expectation, a Foundation Establishment opportunity was such a huge matter. Shouldn't Lu Yang immediately and eagerly inquire about the specific details upon hearing it?

Little did he know, Lu Yang's mindset at this moment was very calm. One had to know that when he first learned about the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, it was only after transforming Ouyang Haoze into a banner spirit, making it an absolutely little-known secret. But now? The entire Skull Mountain was spreading news about the Witch Ghost Secret Realm. Everyone was discussing it, as if simply finding the secret realm would allow even a mortal to successfully establish their foundation.

'When the neighborhood aunties start discussing stock trading, you should already be leaving the market.' A secret that everyone knows, is it still a secret? This was just waiting to harvest the leeks! Lu Yang saw through it clearly. The more the Witch Ghost Secret Realm was hyped up, seeming to offer abundant opportunities, the more determined he became not to leave the market city by half a step.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang immediately shook his head, "Sorry, Senior Brother, I'm not interested in secret realms."

"This..." Zhao Xuhe's mouth hung open. He hastily tried to persuade him, "Junior Brother, cultivation is not easy. One only lives once. How can you shrink back at a crucial moment? The ancient Witch Ghost Dao was a great demonic sect. Although it was ultimately destroyed by the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, a centipede dies but never stiffens; there are always some good things left behind. Perhaps there are rare Foundation Establishment treasures. Aren't you tempted, Junior Brother? You must know that opportunities are hard to come by in a lifetime; if you miss it, it's gone!"

'Opportunities are hard to come by in a lifetime... that's *you*.' 'I'm different. If it doesn't work out in this life, there's always the next, right?' Lu Yang grumbled inwardly, but on his face, he shook his head firmly, "My mind is made up. You should know that what is destined will eventually come; what is not destined should not be forced."

Zhao Xuhe stood there, speechless. There was nothing he could do. With words having reached this point, Lu Yang still had no intention of leaving the market city. Zhao Xuhe was helpless and could only curse him inwardly as a 'damn old tortoise'.

"...If that's the case, then forget it." Zhao Xuhe clenched his jaw and turned to his second plan, saying with a pained expression, "However, I came this time with another transaction I'd like to discuss with you, Junior Brother. I have a secret art that can increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment. I want to use it as collateral to borrow thirty thousand contribution points from you, Junior Brother."

"...Foundation Establishment secret art?" As soon as these words came out, Lu Yang, who had been about to dismiss him, instantly had his eyes light up. Looking at Zhao Xuhe, he felt he was incredibly agreeable. This person was truly his lucky star. Trading Substitute Yin Puppets, the Nine Transformations Dragon Art, Skull Mountain Market City. And now, another Foundation Establishment secret art! Among all the opportunities he had relied on until now, which one didn't have his dear Senior Brother Zhao behind it? For him to be where he was today, Zhao Xuhe's contributions were simply immeasurable!
