Chapter 441: Entering the Banner

Xu Yunfan needed to temper and贯通 the twelve regular meridians and the eight extraordinary meridians one by one, making the Qi Sea in his Dantian as full as mercury and his meridians as broad as a rushing river.

Cultivators practicing this method usually had to spend decades repeatedly refining their bodies before they could purify the True Yuan within them to achieve spiritual power.

However, with the help of the Attribute Panel, Xu Yunfan skipped the most time-consuming purification process.

His spiritual power was already pure and flawless, so he didn't need to painstakingly refine it repeatedly like other cultivators.

This allowed him to focus more energy on opening the meridian acupoints, greatly accelerating his cultivation progress.

Moreover, because the Hundred Meridians Penetrating幽 Art had reshaped his meridians, they were naturally clear, so he only needed to condense his acupoints.

Currently at the early Foundation Establishment stage, he was still far from perfection.

"Practitioners of the Immortal Path cannot progress solely through bitter cultivation."

Xu Yunfan toyed with the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl.

Although the Attribute Panel had the effect of "once proven, always proven," ensuring he didn't take detours in his cultivation, if he relied solely on seclusion and bitter cultivation, it would likely still take him a hundred years to break through to the peak of Foundation Establishment.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but glance at the most recent cultivation information prompt on the Attribute Panel.

It was a proficiency increase alert that popped up six days ago while he was cultivating the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture.

However, looking at the skill bar, the proficiency in the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture hadn't increased at all.

Xu Yunfan figured that the increased proficiency must be after the decimal point.

He recalled several breakthrough methods recorded in the "True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture," such as finding the Thirty-Six Heavenly Gang Qi to temper the body, or gathering the Seventy-Two Earthly Fiend Essence to wash the marrow.

These spiritual treasures of heaven and earth usually grew in dangerous and remote places, requiring one to go in person to search for them.

"I'll consider going out to look for opportunities after I've cultivated enough."

Xu Yunfan's gaze turned to the outside of the cave. He was currently cultivating the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture and following the path of the Divine Martial Realm. In this realm, there was an unclaimed innate golden nature. If he went out, he was afraid he would be noticed by people with ulterior motives right away.

Was he really so envied by others?

Xu Yunfan let out a long sigh to the sky. In the end, he was just too outstanding. Only mediocrity escapes envy.

The path of immortality ultimately requires one to fight and venture forth on their own.

He snapped back to reality.

"It seems I need to solve this first."

Xu Yunfan took out the jade slip recording the "Myriad Chariot Sword Transformation Technique."

This method emphasized "all swords returning to their origin," requiring the nurturing of a vital sword intent within the Dantian.

Yu Congling, who hadn't shown up for a long time, couldn't help but speak up when she saw Xu Yunfan wanting to further cultivate the Myriad Chariot Sword Transformation Technique.

"Have you thought this through? If you really practice this, once you use it, you will be pursued and killed by the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect."

Xu Yunfan chuckled lightly. "With my current identity as a demon, wouldn't I be beaten by everyone wherever I go?"

Yu Congling's voice suddenly stopped. After a moment of silence, she turned to questioning: "You have already succeeded in Foundation Establishment, so why haven't you released me to freedom?"

Xu Yunfan's expression remained indifferent. With a light wave of his sleeve, the black banner floated between them without any wind.

The Ten Thousand Souls Banner was shrouded in Yin energy, and countless twisted faces could be faintly seen wandering on the banner surface. Although there was no bloodthirsty aura, black energy was still churning and rolling on the banner.

"Enter the banner."

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm without a single ripple.

"You treacherous, faithless villain!"

Yu Congling instantly flew into a rage, her voice sharp enough to pierce eardrums. "I helped you in the Divine Martial Realm, and now you want to refine me into a banner?!"

Her curses poured down like a storm: "I treated you with sincerity, yet you are so ungrateful and wolf-hearted!"

"The Yuan Demon Sect is indeed full of despicable and shameless people!"

"If I had known this would happen, I should have killed you under my sword back then!"

Xu Yunfan turned a deaf ear to these curses. With a flick of his finger, the Ten Thousand Souls Banner immediately stirred up a Yin wind.

The black banner opened like a giant mouth, and a powerful suction forcibly pulled Yu Congling's remnant soul out of the object she was inhabiting.

"Xu Yunfan! May you die a horrible death!"

Yu Congling's scream was filled with venom. "I curse you to fall into the sea of suffering in the cycle of reincarnation, to be a pig or a dog for ten thousand generations, never to be reborn..."

Before she could finish, her soul was completely sucked into the banner.

The Ten Thousand Souls Banner shook violently a few times before finally returning to calm.

Xu Yunfan gently stroked the banner surface, feeling the increase in spiritual power brought by the newly collected Yin soul.

He sank his mind into the Ten Thousand Souls Banner and saw Yin energy swirling inside. Countless resentful souls wandered and wailed in the grey mist.

Yu Congling's spiritual body had already reformed, but she still retained her appearance from when she was alive, looking truly cold and beautiful.

When she saw Xu Yunfan's divine sense manifest, her eyes widened in anger, looking as if she wanted to spit fire.

"Xu Yunfan! You despicable villain!"

Yu Congling shouted sharply, her voice echoing in the space within the banner.

She wanted to pounce forward, but was bound by the restrictions within the banner, so she could only stand in place, gnashing her teeth.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly and said indifferently, "Once you enter the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, life and death are no longer up to you."

Seeing that Yu Congling was about to curse again, a sudden Yin wind rose within the banner. Countless black gases, like chains, wrapped around Yu Congling's spiritual body.

She struggled in pain but couldn't break free at all.

"You!"

Yu Congling still wanted to curse, but saw Xu Yunfan raise his hand and wave it lightly. Immediately, thunder raged within the banner, and a green lightning bolt struck her spiritual body, making her let out a piercing scream.

"Remember, here, I let you live, you live; I let you die, you die."

Xu Yunfan showed no pity. This woman had killed him brutally in his dreams. If it hadn't been for the Attribute Panel, he would have already lost his spirit and consciousness.

"Your soul quality is clear. Although you are not at Foundation Establishment, if you want to retain your spiritual intelligence, you will obediently be the main soul of this Ten Thousand Souls Banner."

Yu Congling slumped to the ground, her eyes filled with resentment, but she no longer dared to speak insolently.

She finally understood that after entering this Ten Thousand Souls Banner, she had completely become a plaything in the hands of others. Life and death were all at the whim of a single thought from Xu Yunfan.

Having said that, Xu Yunfan reinserted the Ten Thousand Souls Banner into the Xun position and continued to meditate and adjust his breath.

He formed a sword with his fingers, compressing his True Yuan into a thread according to the method described in the jade slip, and slowly sketched the shape of a sword in his Dantian.

Three days and nights without sleep or rest, he finally condensed a wisp of pale green sword energy as thin as a hair.

Just as the sword energy was about to form, a sudden change occurred!

That wisp of sword energy suddenly became agitated and wanted to break out of his body.

Xu Yunfan urgently formed hand seals, and fine beads of sweat oozed from his forehead.

In the critical moment, the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl placed at the Li position suddenly burst with green light. A dragon-shaped lightning bolt shot into his Dantian, firmly locking the agitated sword energy.

"So that's why..."

Xu Yunfan suddenly realized. It was no wonder there was no system prompt for proficiency improvement.

The True君 had bestowed the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl precisely to help him cultivate the "Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method."

This method required using the Thunder Pearl as a guide to combine the power of thunder with one's own essence, spirit, and energy. First, cultivate the Green Dragon Thunder Pearl Lock Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method, then cultivate the Myriad Chariot Sword Transformation Technique.

He immediately changed his strategy and took the Thunder Pearl into his palm.

The pearl was cool to the touch, and the Green Dragon shadow inside seemed to sense something, suddenly raising its head and letting out a long cry.

Xu Yunfan, following the method passed down by the True君, slowly extended his divine sense into the Thunder Pearl.

"Boom!"

The moment his divine sense touched the surface of the Thunder Pearl, he felt the world spinning.

When he opened his eyes again, he was already in a sea of thunder.
