# Chapter 140: The Heavenly Work Fortress

The surface of the city wall, like overlapping fish scales, peeled upward from the ground, extending another section toward the sky and revealing the honeycomb-like array of crossbow mechanisms beneath.

Three thousand six hundred fish-scaled plates on the city wall's surface flipped simultaneously. Three-inch barbs sprang from the edge of each plate, glowing with a faint blue toxic luster in the twilight.

Accompanied by the roar of gears from deep underground, the entire section of the city wall grew upward like a living creature. At the same time, a large stretch of cleared land next to the wall within the city shook violently, cracking open a long, narrow chasm.

From within the chasm, a lotus base made of profound steel broke through the earth from the depths of the ley lines. Twelve layers of profound steel lotus petals unfurled layer by layer, and from each petal emerged honeycomb-shaped turrets forged from hundred-refined profound steel.

*Click!*

Scalding steam sprayed from the joints of the lotus petals. From the exposed honeycomb turrets, seven hundred and twenty Thunderfire Crossbows extended.

The crossbows were pitch-black. Instead of ordinary arrows, the grooves were loaded with wrist-thick profound iron javelins. The iron chains tied to the tails of the javelins were connected to the mercury pumps of the moat.

As the first wave of javelins left the string, mercury flowed up the chains against gravity, weaving a toxic net in the air that precisely struck the Xianghuo Sect's Demon-Sweeping Heavenly Army, which had unknowingly surrounded the city from the outside.

Just one wave cleared out more than half of the Xianghuo Sect's followers.

From above, it looked as if several lotus petals were continuously pushing up from the ground until the entire city was buried within the牯牛 (Guniu) Mountain. The profound steel lotus city below had completely closed up. The lotus-shaped city walls radiated a cold, sharp light in the twilight. The twelve layers of profound steel lotus petals interlocked, and each petal was embedded with seven hundred and twenty Thunderfire Crossbows. The sound of the crossbow gears meshing was like a plague of locusts sweeping past.

The sound of gears meshing from the mountain peak, a sound of primordial antiquity, drew Xu Yunfan's attention, but what shocked him even more was this:

The entire spine of Guniu Mountain cracked open a massive mouth. A steel giant tiger, over fifty zhang tall, slowly rose from the chasm.

In the sulfuric smoke billowing from the fissure, the outline of the steel giant tiger gradually became clear.

This nearly fifty-zhang-tall mechanical beast was forged entirely from profound steel. The tiger stripes were actually three thousand six hundred heat dissipation grooves. Currently, it was breathing the red light of the earth's molten lava. As it moved, the heat dissipation grooves at the joints of its tiger claws spewed sulfuric smoke, dyeing the lingering sun blood-red.

When the giant tiger completely crawled out of the mountain body and climbed atop the lotus fortress, embedding itself within it to form a sealed whole for the entire Heavenly Work City, it opened its mouth toward the Xianghuo Sect army rushing toward the city from the outside, revealing a shockingly thick cannon barrel.

Xu Yunfan saw clearly that among the approaching Xianghuo Sect members was that expert at the Blood Transformation Realm wielding a zhang-two Mingwang spear, riding alone and leading the charge.

*Boom!*

The moment the giant tiger's cannon mouth fired a test shot, the night sky was dyed crimson.

The cannonball disintegrated in mid-air into thirty-six burning iron pellets. When they struck the Xianghuo Sect, a earth-shattering explosion occurred instantly, and even more, circles of fire formed by thunder and fire surged up, trapping the Xianghuo Sect's vanguard camp like turtles in a jar.

Xu Yunfan even saw that some of the burning iron pellets actually crawled out miniature mechanical scorpions—these quenched-poison killing devices specifically drilled into the gaps in armor to bite at the vital points of the wearers.

*What the hell is this!?*

Xu Yunfan stared dumbfoundedly at the sealed Heavenly Work City below, then looked at the tiger head embedded at the very top of the Heavenly Work Fortress.

A tiger-shaped mechanical beast had actually crawled out in this martial arts world.

"It's impressive, isn't it? The Heavenly Work Cave's predecessor was a branch of the Mohist school from two thousand years ago. This Mohist Mechanical Tiger has been the obsession of every generation's Mechanism Hall, Heavenly Work Department, and Smelting Gold Hall within our Heavenly Work Cave for the past thousand years, trying to repair it. Even now, it's still lacking something.

"Back then, the Mohist masters could commune with this mechanical tiger心意 (heart and mind), and with this tiger, they burned seven cities to ashes in a single night. Now, we can't even summon thirty percent of its power."

Mo Shisan had climbed back onto the Heavenly Work corridor bridge at this time, quietly looking down at the completely shrouded Heavenly Work City, his expression carrying an indescribable grief and anger.

"After this battle, Heavenly Work Cave has lost nearly half of its disciples. My Master said that 'entering a dream to possess' only works the first time. The next time it's cast, its effectiveness is greatly reduced, and it can no longer bewitch people's hearts. The crisis ahead is mostly resolved, as long as the Azure Dragon Winch is opened and the profound steel lotus of Heavenly Work City takes form, apart from a supreme Grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Refining, even a Grandmaster of Organ Refining wouldn't be able to gain any advantage.

"Under our Guniu Mountain, we might lack everything else, but we never lack steel. The wealth accumulated over a thousand years, five layers of it, have been invested into this profound steel lotus fortress."

Although Mo Shisan spoke lightly, the infighting within Heavenly Work City, the former brothers and fellow disciples turning on each other, dealt a heavy blow to Heavenly Work Cave.

He turned his head to look at the bridge corridor that had been smashed into a large pit.

"Where's Bao Yan?"

"I beat him to death."

Xu Yunfan said it casually, but Mo Shisan, seeing the countless purplish-red bloodstains like earthworms winding all over Xu Yunfan through the torn clothes, naturally understood how thrilling the battle must have been just now.

He looked at Xu Yunfan with a complex expression, fell silent for a moment, and said in a low voice, "Thank you! It seems this time, you paid a great price to kill Bao Yan."

Xu Yunfan looked at Mo Shisan inexplicably. Dealing with Bao Yan, his vital energy was already waning, and having been in a high position for too long, even his fighting seemed rusty.

The moment the Lin state was activated, one mace broke his defense, the second mace crushed him.

Where was the need for so much fuss?

"Let's go. I'll go find Senior Brother Fu first."

After taking two steps, Xu Yunfan turned back and asked, "How do I get in?"

"The entire Guniu Mountain has been hollowed out. Most of Heavenly Work City is inside the mountain. Just walk back along the Heavenly Work corridor bridge."

Xu Yunfan didn't delay. Entering Guniu Mountain, he stepped onto the side slide. After imprinting his True Disciple token, the slide immediately let out a steam hiss and rapidly slid into the depths of the mountain.

When he entered Heavenly Work City, Xu Yunfan looked up at the illuminating stones on the ceiling, which lit up the Heavenly Work City below as if it were broad daylight.

When he found Fu Jin, the latter's large hand was gripping the neck of the last frenzied disciple, while the sulfur smoke in the Forge Hall's Earthfire Room was thick.

The thirty-seven restrained individuals had blood vessels bulging like earthworms, and their eyeballs were entirely white.

Symptoms of the Erosion Heart Pill eroding the mind.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was heavy and silent.

Fu Jin turned his head to look at him, his face dark, and glanced at the purplish-red bloodstains on Xu Yunfan's neck and shoulders. He understood in his heart that the path Xu Yunfan had taken to get here had not been easy.

"The Xianghuo Sect's Erosion Heart Pill. A few months ago, a letter came from Wuzhou. We personally sent the scouts of the Quenching Edge Army to investigate... There is no cure.

"Just now, the Master transmitted a message. Nearly half of Heavenly Work Cave's disciples were confused by the Xianghuo Sect's Bright Lord entering their dreams. Additionally, the Xianghuo Sect infiltrated the city and distributed the Erosion Heart Pill..."

As he spoke, Fu Jin's five fingers exerted force, twisting the neck of the disciple who had suddenly struggled frantically.

"Li Wen, the seventh son of the Li family running a leather goods business in the west of Heavenly Work City."

Fu Jin's hand grabbed the second struggling disciple. When his calloused fingers pierced the collarbone, the lava of the Earthfire Room illuminated the twitching of his profile: "Zhao Siping, an orphan who fled famine from the South of the Desert. Seven years ago, he was stealing mantou at the City God Temple. It was I who brought him back to the Forge Hall!"
