# Chapter 75: I've Always Been Diligent (Please Subscribe!)

Luo Yiping spoke up, drawing Chu Ning's attention. 

"Chu Ning, the shops in Yanji Market have always been jointly managed by the Artifact Forging Hall, Alchemy Hall, Talisman Pavilion, Spirit Beast Department, and Spirit Plant Department. 

The Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant Department only assigned you here, so you have two shops and courtyards. 

Meanwhile, Junior Sister Lu and I only have one shop and courtyard between us. 

Since you can't possibly use them all, surely you can spare one courtyard?"

Chu Ning was momentarily stunned—he hadn't expected Luo Yiping to make such a request.

Seeing Chu Ning hesitate, Luo Yiping continued, 

"To be honest, at the fourth level of Qi Refining, you must be overwhelmed between cultivating spirit plants and crafting talismans. You wouldn't even have time to use the extra courtyard. 

Junior Sister Lu and I could use it to raise more spirit beasts. 

That way, we won't be completely overshadowed by Fengxia Valley in Yanji Market."

Luo Yiping's tone was full of concern—as if he were thinking of Chu Ning and the sect's reputation.

Instead of answering directly, Chu Ning turned to Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan. 

"Are Senior Sister Gu and Senior Brother Shen also here for this matter?"

Gu Xiaoqing shook her head. "I came to discuss spirit plant cultivation with Junior Brother Chu."

Shen Zhengquan hesitated before saying, 

"I wasn't aware of Senior Brother Luo's idea, but upon reflection, it does seem reasonable. 

If our talismans can't outsell theirs, at least we can make up for it with spirit beasts."

Encouraged by Shen Zhengquan's words, Luo Yiping smiled at him.

Chu Ning now realized this was entirely Luo Yiping's idea. 

He raised his head and tentatively asked, 

"If I give the courtyard to the Spirit Beast Department, would the harvest contributions also be their responsibility?"

"Of course not! I'd only be using the courtyard," Luo Yiping chuckled. 

"Though I suppose I could help you cover a small portion of the quota."

Chu Ning sighed inwardly but maintained a troubled expression. 

"This courtyard belongs to the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant Department. I don't have the authority to decide. Should I ask Elder Lin to seek approval from the sect?"

"Ah, why trouble the elders with such a trivial matter?" Luo Yiping waved his hand dismissively. 

"It's just an unused courtyard."

Chu Ning still wore a conflicted look. 

"I'm afraid I can't agree without approval. Elder Liao Yunming of the Talisman Pavilion and Elder He Changyou of the Hundred Arts Hall gave me specific tasks before I left. 

This courtyard still has its uses for me."

Luo Yiping's smile faltered. 

"Uses? One courtyard isn't enough for you? What could you possibly need the other for?"

"Growing spirit plants," Chu Ning answered plainly. 

The market's abundant spiritual energy, combined with his Woodspring Vitality Technique, would make cultivation far more efficient than in the sect. 

He wasn't about to pass up such an opportunity.

Luo Yiping frowned deeply. 

"You're joking, right? You already have twenty acres of spirit fields outside, plus talisman crafting—now you want to grow plants here too? How could you possibly manage all that?"

Unfazed by Luo Yiping's displeasure, Chu Ning sighed. 

"I have no choice. The elders assigned these tasks before I left. 

Perhaps it's because I've always been diligent that they entrusted me with so much. 

If Senior Brother Luo could ask Elder Lin to request lighter duties from the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant Department on my behalf, I'd be grateful."

Mentioning the elders again made Luo Yiping's expression darken. 

His attempt to take advantage was hardly something he could bring up with them. 

With an awkward smile, he shot Chu Ning a displeased look. 

"My intention was to raise more spirit beasts here, which would help our sect compete with Fengxia Valley. 

But if you have other plans, I won't insist."

At this moment, Shen Zhengquan interjected with a smile, 

"Junior Brother Chu, if you feel Senior Brother Luo should contribute more to the quota, you can say so."

"Apologies, Senior Brother Shen," Chu Ning shook his head. 

"The elders assigned me tasks to complete. The courtyard truly has its uses."

Shen Zhengquan's smile faded briefly before returning, though he gave an imperceptible nod.

An uncomfortable silence fell over the room. 

Among the two female disciples who had remained quiet, Lu Miaoying seemed about to speak, but a glance at Luo Yiping's sour expression made her hold her tongue.

Noticing the tension, Gu Xiaoqing spoke up calmly, 

"Since the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant Department entrusted these shops and courtyards to Junior Brother Chu, their management is naturally his responsibility. 

Senior Brother Luo's concerns come from a place of sect loyalty. Let's not let this harm our harmony."

Her measured, impartial words left no room for argument. 

Chu Ning glanced at Gu Xiaoqing appreciatively—she was clearly reasonable and fair-minded. 

Her statement both reminded Luo Yiping of Chu Ning's authority and gave him an honorable exit.

Sure enough, Luo Yiping's expression shifted before he snorted and turned to leave. 

After a few steps, unable to resist a final jab, he said coldly, 

"In Yanji Market, Qingxi Sect and Fengxia Valley have always been rivals. 

Since you're confident in handling everything, don't embarrass our sect."

With that, he stormed off. 

Shen Zhengquan gave Chu Ning a long look and said with a smile, 

"Senior Brother Luo only spoke out of concern for the sect's reputation. 

I'm sure the sect wouldn't have sent Junior Brother Chu if they didn't believe in his capabilities."

Chu Ning smiled without responding to the veiled challenge. 

His dislike for Shen Zhengquan's hypocritical demeanor matched his disdain for Luo Yiping.

Once the two left, Lu Miaoying followed. 

Only Chu Ning and Gu Xiaoqing remained.

"Junior Brother Chu," Gu Xiaoqing began, "previous Spirit Plant Department seniors often grew Revitalizing Grass in the fields. Do you have other plans?"

Chu Ning was surprised she didn't revisit the earlier conflict, instead directly asking about the fields. 

Since he had questions of his own, he replied, 

"I was just about to ask—what elixirs does Senior Sister Gu sell here? Revitalizing Pills?"

Gu Xiaoqing shook her head. 

"I do sell Revitalizing Pills—they've always been popular—but I'd prefer to focus on Gathering Yuan Pills."

Chu Ning looked at her with newfound respect. 

This senior sister's alchemy skills must be impressive. 

Though Revitalizing Pills and Gathering Yuan Pills differed by only one character, their purposes were worlds apart. 

Revitalizing Pills were basic, low-tier elixirs that restored spiritual energy. 

Gathering Yuan Pills, however, enhanced cultivation and boosted spiritual power—a mid-tier elixir nearing high-tier difficulty.

Realization dawned on him. 

"Is Golden Yuan Fruit the main ingredient for Gathering Yuan Pills?"

"Junior Brother is truly knowledgeable about spirit plants!" Gu Xiaoqing's eyes brightened with hope. 

"Golden Yuan Fruit is indeed the primary material. Can you cultivate it?"

Chu Ning nodded. He had learned about Golden Yuan Fruit from Elder He Changyou's jade slip, which detailed its uses and cultivation methods. 

It wouldn't be difficult for him. 

However, he frowned slightly. 

"The problem is, I didn't bring Golden Yuan Fruit seeds from the sect, and I don't know when Elder Lin will visit the market again."
