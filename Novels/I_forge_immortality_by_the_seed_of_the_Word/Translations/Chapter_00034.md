# Chapter 34: The Ninefold Stellar Talisman Method

"This should be the place."

Zhang Jing paused briefly before the cluster of low buildings, listening to the occasional crane calls emanating from within, then strode toward the entrance.

This was one inconvenience of the outer sect.

With team headquarters scattered across various islands, travel became quite troublesome for disciples like Zhang Jing who lacked flying artifacts or spirit beast mounts. Relying solely on flight spells would likely leave him plummeting into the lake halfway, exhausted of spiritual energy—unless he was lucky enough to encounter the legendary flood dragon.

The best solution was to rent a spirit crane from the Crane Garden before him.

No sooner had he entered than a green-robed man approached. "Junior Brother, are you heading out on a mission?"

"Senior Brother, I'd like to rent a spirit crane to visit the Thousand Methods Pavilion."

At Zhang Jing's response, the man's smile grew even warmer. "Renting a crane, you say? No problem at all, right this way."

With that, he courteously led Zhang Jing inside.

Soon, a lush garden came into view, where over a dozen pristine white cranes, each taller than a man, strolled leisurely. Occasionally, one would stretch its slender neck high, flapping its wings and emitting clear cries. The stirred dust and pebbles flew toward Zhang Jing but were instantly blocked by the spiritual light emanating from his robe.

"Junior Brother, are these cranes to your liking?" the green-robed man asked.

Zhang Jing nodded. "May I ask the daily rental fee?"

The man gave Zhang Jing a slightly surprised look but didn't pry. "Two spirit stones per day."

"Then I'll rent one for today. Thank you, Senior Brother." Zhang Jing smiled, retrieving two spirit stones from his storage pouch.

"Much obliged, Junior Brother."

Accepting the stones, the man took out a black bracelet from his own pouch and handed it over, pointing to a crane in the garden. "Channel your spiritual sense through this bracelet to control that crane."

"Many thanks."

Taking the bracelet, Zhang Jing extended his spiritual sense and indeed detected a simple consciousness within. *Come here*, he willed.

Instantly, one crane stopped moving, looked up at Zhang Jing, then walked straight toward him.

"Senior Brother, do you sell these cranes?"

Feeling the crane's convenience, Zhang Jing couldn't help but ask. His cave abode had space for spirit beasts, and owning such an obedient crane would make travel much easier.

However, the man's reply nearly made Zhang Jing abandon the tempting idea. "Of course we sell them, Junior Brother. For one hundred Dao merits, you can take one home."

*One hundred Dao merits?* That was astronomically expensive!

While he couldn't bear to spend Dao merits, using spirit stones might be feasible—after all, unlike merits, spirit stones could be obtained through various means. "Senior Brother, can I pay with spirit stones?"

The man smiled. "Are you sure, Junior Brother?"

In the Inheritance Hall, Senior Brother Liu held the mid-grade inheritance exchange voucher, looking at Zhang Jing with mild surprise. "You're certain?" he asked.

Zhang Jing nodded firmly. "Yes, Senior Brother."

"Junior Brother, I've told you before—your sole focus should be cultivation. Don't waste time on other pursuits. Talisman-making, in particular, consumes immense time and effort. Those who earn Dao merits through it have both talent and years of grueling practice behind them."

Senior Brother Liu's expression was complex. Though he wanted to dissuade Zhang Jing further, the determination in the younger man's eyes told him it would be futile.

After a long silence, he sighed. "Since you're resolved, I won't stop you. But remember—cultivation is fundamental. Only by entering the inner sect can you truly embark on the path of immortality and see how vast this world is!"

"I will remember your teachings, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said earnestly, bowing deeply.

"Hmph! If you truly remembered, you wouldn't be here exchanging for talisman-making techniques!" Senior Brother Liu retorted.

Zhang Jing merely smiled awkwardly.

"Let me think... mid-grade inheritance voucher..." Senior Brother Liu pondered. "Junior Brother, talisman-making techniques for the Qi Refinement stage aren't graded like cultivation methods. Their value lies in the variety of talisman recipes recorded."

After a moment, he brightened. "Ah, wait here."

---

Senior Brother Liu soon returned with a jade slip. "This is the *Ninefold Stellar Talisman Method*. It covers talisman-crafting techniques and recipes for nearly twenty different talismans—a high-quality inheritance matching your voucher's value."

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Zhang Jing accepted the slip eagerly, his spiritual sense immediately probing its contents.

"Now that you have it, I'll take my leave," Senior Brother Liu said.

"Farewell, Senior Brother."

Only after Senior Brother Liu had disappeared did Zhang Jing turn to leave. His next stop: the Thousand Methods Pavilion. This trip would serve both to purchase talisman materials and explore the pavilion.

Mounting the crane, Zhang Jing soared into the sky. After orienting himself, he directed the crane toward the pavilion.

Half a quarter-hour later, he dismounted before an imposing bronze palace. Unlike the quiet Inheritance Hall, the Thousand Methods Pavilion bustled with disciples.

After securing the crane, Zhang Jing took a deep breath and followed the crowd inside.

The vast hall before him featured a towering verdigris door exuding an ancient aura. Though wide open, flickering spiritual light obscured the interior. Noticing how effortlessly the senior disciples strode through, Zhang Jing deduced that the artifacts and talismans were sold beyond it.

Without hesitation, he stepped forward.
