# Chapter 196: Refining the Flesh Realm (Part 1)

His iron-like fingers clamped down on Lu Cheng’s Jianjing acupoint. The weathered face, etched with deep lines, contorted and then froze. “That year, half of the Divine Weapon Ridge collapsed into flying dust. I didn't even have the courage to look back. I didn't dare to turn back, didn't dare to investigate, didn't dare to ask. I was afraid that if I did, I would die, and the Divine Weapon Ridge would be severed forever. I never expected that you were still alive and rebuilt the Divine Weapon Ridge.”

Lu Cheng’s shoulder blades creaked under the iron grip.

Twenty years of time had carved two deep furrows between his brows. “The Furnace of Burning Weapons did indeed melt away half of my bones and sinews.” He raised his arm, the sleeve hanging empty. “Now, I am merely a Second-Rank Martial Teacher, guarding broken steles and furnaces just to survive.”

Despite suppressing the turbulent emotions in his heart, the joy of meeting Zhan Yan was evident on Lu Cheng’s tense face.

“Fifth Senior Brother, I didn't expect us to meet again today.”

Zhan Yan’s smile gradually faded as he listened. After a long silence, he sighed. “Eldest Senior Brother died standing. We…”

“If we all fought head-on like Eldest Senior Brother…” Lu Cheng stepped aside, revealing the dozens of women and children behind him. An infant in a swaddling cloth was sucking on its fingers. “The Divine Weapon forging method would have been cut off long ago.”

He turned his head and glanced at the women and children behind him, his gaze filled with a hint of worry.

“Fifth Senior Brother, the Great乾 army now occupies the nine states of Yanbei. They are everywhere, chopping down mountains and destroying temples, capturing martial artists. Our Divine Weapon Ridge is originally a weapon-forging sect. If we are captured, I'm afraid…”

Zhan Yan remained silent for a moment before speaking. “I remember there is a secret passage that leads directly to the back mountain thirty miles outside the Divine Weapon Ridge. We can go take a look. If it wasn't crushed back then, it might be a way out.”

Lu Cheng’s spirit lifted. “There's no time to lose. Let's go first!”

Lingnan Circuit, Shu State, Tiangong Cave. Three days later.

Xu Yunfan swept past the front of the Casting Hall. The wind billowed the patched robes of the youths. The setting sun reflected their posture as they craned their necks to look at the vaulted ceiling.

Their fingers, etched with the grooves of hard labor, were clenched into fists, burning with hope for the future in their eyes.

To the side, the cast-iron forging platforms radiated heat, humming amidst the green phosphorus fire.

The youths’ backs still carried the curvature of being bent by rice stalks, yet they had already learned to stiffen their necks like quenched sword strips.

Their wrist bones, wrapped in coarse hemp, trembled with each breath, as if gripping an invisible hammer handle.

These were the disciples who had successfully activated their blood qi and remained. Out of two hundred recruits, only thirty were left.

Xu Yunfan, hands behind his back, walked a circle around the youths in the field. He suddenly stopped and looked at the youth standing tall in front of him. Although his face was youthful, it couldn't hide his excitement.

“What is your name?”

“My name is Xiao Fan!”

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and reached out to pinch the youth’s physique. He nodded slightly. “Your aptitude is good. The Casting Hall of Tiangong Cave will not treat you poorly.”

“Yes!”

Receiving Xu Yunfan’s praise, the youth’s expression was振奋 (spirited), and he responded loudly.

The young man before them was a legend within Tiangong Cave. A true disciple of the Casting Hall, he had逆杀 (counter-killed) a Half-Step Blood Transformation expert despite being at the Outer Three Unions realm, ranking first in strength among the younger generation.

He turned his head to look at the youth beside him.

“And you? What is your name?”

“Replying to Martial Uncle, my name is Ye Yan!”

“...Hmm, the character for ‘fire’ is in your name. You are considered a good seedling for forging weapons.”

Currently, Xu Yunfan was temporarily managing the Casting Hall, so he naturally needed to be clear about various matters. However, in his view, the vast majority of these matters were trivial and he handed them all over to Fu Li.

Everything centered on martial arts training.

为此 (For this), he slept almost every day, interacting with the woman in white in his dreams. Every battle, every life-and-death struggle, accumulated incredibly rich combat experience for him.

In the following time, Xu Yunfan did not leave Tiangong Cave even half a step. He simply asked Mo Shisan to have the disciples of the Great Condor Team from the Mechanism Hall continuously investigate Fu Jin’s whereabouts and the situation at the Divine Weapon Ridge in Qingzhou.

From the messages sent back by the Great Condor Team disciples, it was confirmed that someone had indeed seen Zhan Yan at the Divine Weapon Ridge. Moreover, the entire forging personnel of the Divine Weapon Ridge had disappeared without a trace, leaving only small groups of Great乾 troops patrolling the imperial roads.

***

The cold moon turned three times, and the flames of war across the world grew even fiercer.

The iron cavalry broke through the nine states of Yanbei Circuit, and the black flags of Great乾 were planted atop all the signal beacon towers.

When those fierce warriors clad in heavy玄铁 (black iron) armor cut down the command flags atop the city walls, not a single sect could stop them.

The Nine Shine Sect holed up within the three-state territory of Nine Shine Mountain, with powerful disciples and elders leading teams to patrol, turning a deaf ear to the wailing of the百姓 (common people) in the other sixteen states.

Until the seventh fortress ignited the wolf smoke beacon, the bronze giant bell of Yanbei Circuit City finally rang out.

The defending general rallied three hundred thousand troops, their armor frosting over as they formed battle lines at the city gates.

A distress letter, adorned with twelve golden-feathered arrows, flew past thirteen relay stations and scattered towards the other five circuits.

“...Only after the Yanbei Circuit City reacted and rallied troops to resist did the青衫 (green-robed) swordsmen tread upon the roof ridges, the Iron Judge’s judge’s pen tore through the blood mist, and wandering heroes wielding丈二 (twelve-foot)陌刀 (Mo sabers) charged into the battle formation.

Beneath the broken city walls, bones piled into mountains, carving out a sliver of life amidst the setting sun. They finally managed to hold onto Yanbei City, this northern fortress.”

Fu Li read from the letter sent by the Great Condor Team disciples. The disciples present were enthralled, wishing they could gallop to the battlefield to shed their blood and sacrifice their lives.

“...Who wrote this letter? It’s too passionate, excessive.”

Xu Yunfan frowned. Martial artists naturally have vigorous blood qi and are easily ignited. If this letter circulated, many disciples in Tiangong Cave would likely have their hearts flying towards Yanbei City.

Fu Li coughed dryly. “It was written by the chief disciple of the External Affairs Hall, Yuan Ze, Martial Uncle Yuan.”

Xu Yunfan understood. Although Yuan Ze had decent martial prowess, he was too literary and sentimental, much like Su Zhenhe from the Xuanzhen Gate.

“Disperse. The Casting Hall has received many large orders recently. The military department of Great Zhou alone has procured nearly eight million taels of silver. Every weapon you forge counts as a contribution.”

Currently, the Casting Hall had two hundred forging masters working day and night, constantly refining.

Some standard-issue weapons relied on the forging furnaces jointly developed by the Tiangong Department and the Mechanism Hall.

Weapons below the graded levels naturally didn't require the disciples of the Casting Hall to出手 (take action). Under the guidance of the Casting Hall's consultants, the Mechanism Hall and Tiangong Department had naturally developed automated operations.

The results were gratifying.

However, to forge a graded weapon, even a Lower Grade Mortal Weapon, still required a forging master to carefully hammer it out.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't participate personally. He was on the verge of a breakthrough, and almost all his thoughts were on the cultivation of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique.

Until the tenth day, in the courtyard, Xu Yunfan took two deep breaths of the Ginseng Spirit's qi. The ginseng qi rapidly dispersed into his limbs and bones through his lungs. The pure yang inner qi within his flesh and blood began to circulate continuously through his torso and arms.

He glanced at the information floating out on his attribute panel. He was only twenty-one proficiency points away from completing the Pure Yang One Qi Technique. Today, he would surely step into the Refining the Flesh Realm!

He felt the two streams of ginseng qi within his body turning into molten hot currents that flowed ceaselessly. As the pure yang inner qi circulated, they were constantly refined and消弭 (dissipated).

*‘You deeply inhaled two breaths of the Spirit Ginseng’s qi, stirring the pure yang inner qi cultivated by the Pure Yang One Qi Technique to flow ceaselessly between your muscles, bones, and skin. Benefited by the ginseng qi, your proficiency increased significantly.’*
