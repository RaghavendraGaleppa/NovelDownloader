# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 129: Ouyang Qinxin  

Before him stood an extraordinarily beautiful woman, though a faint trace of sternness lingered between her brows.  

She glanced at Lin Xuan, and the icy expression on her face gradually softened, revealing a slight smile. "Senior Brother Taibai, weren't you hosting guests at Yunhai? What brings you here—"  

Lin Xuan's mind raced. The woman before him had an aura so restrained that even when he used his Spirit Eye Technique, he couldn't discern her cultivation level—she was undoubtedly a Core Formation expert.  

Fortunately, before leaving this time, he had familiarized himself with the key figures of the Biyun Mountain Sect. Although the sect had dozens of Core Formation cultivators, making it impossible to remember each one, he happened to recognize this female cultivator.  

Ouyang Qinxin.  

A Biyun Mountain elder!  

Female cultivators were already rare, and those who succeeded in forming a Core were even more exceptional. Thus, Lin Xuan had some impression of her.  

Though she must have been quite old to reach the Core Formation stage, she still looked as youthful as a maiden in her late teens, likely due to some special cultivation technique.  

Despite his inner unease, Lin Xuan stroked his beard and smiled. "This humble brother has some matters to attend to in the herb garden. What brings you here, Junior Sister?"  

Addressing a Core Formation elder as "Junior Sister" gave Lin Xuan a strange feeling, but with things having come to this, he had no choice but to continue the act.  

"Lately, I've been feeling restless during my cultivation, so I was planning to visit the herb garden to request a Tranquil Heart Herb. How fortunate to run into you on the way."  

The Tranquil Heart Herb was an extremely precious medicinal herb, renowned for its ability to calm the mind and dispel inner demons.  

Ordinary cultivators would never have the chance to consume it, but Core Formation experts received it freely from their sect.  

"Haha, Junior Sister, you're too polite." Lin Xuan waved his hand magnanimously. "Such a small matter could easily be handled by the disciples overseeing the herb garden, even in my absence."  

"Regardless, we must still follow the sect's rules. Senior Brother, let's go!"  

Lin Xuan naturally didn't refuse. Together, they flew toward the herb garden on their magical lights. During this time, Lin Xuan had to exert all his effort just to keep up with Ouyang Qinxin's speed—and that was only because she wasn't flying at full speed within the sect grounds.  

"Hmm?"  

Moments later, a black dot appeared in the distance. As they drew closer, the outline of the herb garden gradually became clearer. Ouyang Qinxin let out a surprised exclamation and instantly accelerated.  

Lin Xuan also noticed something amiss. Though inwardly puzzled, he feigned a mix of shock and fury.  

Soon, they arrived outside the herb garden, where several corpses lay strewn about. Among them was the disciple surnamed He, whom Lin Xuan had seen during the ambush on the Daoist the previous day.  

His eyes were wide open in death, filled with indignation.  

Instantly, numerous thoughts flashed through Lin Xuan's mind.  

Just yesterday, he had witnessed the power of the Seven-Colored Sword Formation. Even without the real Taibai Sword Immortal present, the formation alone should have been enough to suppress a Core Formation expert effortlessly.  

Yet, judging by the current scene, someone had forcibly broken in from the outside. Could it be an old monster at the Nascent Soul stage?  

Otherwise, it would have taken several Core Formation cultivators working together to breach the formation from the outside.  

However, after scanning the area with her divine sense, Ouyang Qinxin's beautiful face turned frosty. "There's a traitor."  

"A traitor?"  

"Indeed. The Seven-Colored Sword Formation was dismantled from the inside. To think that a spy has infiltrated our Biyun Mountain."  

Lin Xuan felt both relief and concern. While it was good that someone had stirred the waters, he worried that their target might be the same as his—the garden's treasure, the Seven-Star Herb.  

"Biyun Mountain will not tolerate such insolence!" Ouyang Qinxin turned to him angrily. "Senior Brother, let's go. We'll capture the scoundrel and hand him over to the sect master for punishment."  

Lin Xuan could only nod in agreement and follow Ouyang Qinxin into the herb garden.  

The scenes along the way were gruesome. Dozens of corpses littered the ground—not just the disciples assigned to the herb garden but also many outer sect members. The intruders had even slaughtered the servants who fetched tea and water, their cruelty beyond belief.  

What made Ouyang Qinxin's expression even darker was the sight of the garden's rare herbs and flowers, which had been plundered as if locusts had swept through.  

Several exceptionally precious herbs had even been uprooted entirely.  

This was utterly intolerable. Ouyang Qinxin bit her red lips tightly.  

Lin Xuan also wore a grim expression—though most of it was feigned.  

A riot of colors flashed ahead, accompanied by shouts. Ouyang Qinxin's delicate brows arched as she transformed into a streak of blue light, speeding toward the commotion.  

Left behind, Lin Xuan hesitated briefly before deciding to follow.  

If he fled now, it would only arouse Ouyang Qinxin's suspicion. He had no confidence in escaping a Core Formation expert's pursuit.  

Better to wait and act according to circumstances. With this in mind, Lin Xuan also transformed into a streak of light and followed.  

Though his speed couldn't match Ouyang Qinxin's, the distance wasn't great, so they arrived almost simultaneously.  

The scene before them shocked Lin Xuan.  

Three Biyun Mountain disciples at the Foundation Establishment stage were locked in a standoff with a burly, ferocious-looking man.  

The man appeared brutish, but his cultivation level was nothing to scoff at—Core Formation.  

Under normal circumstances, three Foundation Establishment cultivators would stand no chance against a Core Formation expert. However, the trio wielded formation flags, relying on a profound array to barely hold their ground.  

Even so, beads of sweat dotted their foreheads, a clear sign they were nearing exhaustion.  

Thus, when they saw Ouyang Qinxin and Lin Xuan, their faces lit up with ecstatic relief.  

"Master, save us!"  

Hearing the address, Lin Xuan's lips twitched. It seemed these three were disciples of the Taibai Sword Immortal.  

But he didn't have to worry about intervening. Ouyang Qinxin, though stunningly beautiful, had a fiery temper. With a flick of her jade-like hand, several sword beams shot from her sleeve toward their opponent.  

The burly man had also noticed their arrival. With a grave expression, he cracked his knuckles and hurled a glowing sphere to meet the sword beams head-on.  

Then he turned, bracing himself warily.  

"Liu Hai!" Ouyang Qinxin called out the man's name.  

"Heh, Senior Brother Taibai, Junior Sister Ouyang. Never thought we'd meet again."  

The man's greeting baffled Lin Xuan, but Ouyang Qinxin only grew angrier. "Liu Hai, the sect master showed you mercy back then, sparing your lives and merely expelling you. And this is how you repay his kindness—by holding grudges and seeking revenge?"  

Suddenly, her expression changed. She turned to Lin Xuan. "There's another one. Senior Brother Taibai, that scoundrel Liu Tong must have come with him. I'll handle this. You go and intercept him!"  

Lin Xuan was inwardly relieved. He had no desire to get involved in a battle between Core Formation experts—let alone risk exposing his identity. This was the perfect opportunity to slip away and head for the garden's central area.  

"Then I'll leave this to you, Junior Sister."  

Before the words had fully left his mouth, Lin Xuan transformed into a streak of light, attempting to bypass Liu Hai. The burly man hesitated but didn't stop him—after all, facing two Core Formation experts alone would be suicidal.  

Once Lin Xuan left, the battle between Ouyang Qinxin and Liu Hai erupted in earnest.  

Ouyang Qinxin held a golden harp, an unusual type of magical treasure said to complement her unique cultivation technique, allowing her to kill with sound waves.  

Meanwhile, Liu Hai summoned a spiked mace-like artifact, radiating an eerie crimson glow.  

"Fall back!" Ouyang Qinxin commanded.  

"Yes!"  

The three exhausted Foundation Establishment cultivators obeyed gratefully, retreating to a safe distance.  

The clash of spiritual pressure between the two Core Formation experts sent shockwaves through the air...  

Boom!  

The battle began. Feeling the tremendous energy fluctuations behind him, Lin Xuan shuddered. He was glad he had seized the chance to escape.  

Of course, he had no intention of actually intercepting the other Core Formation expert as Ouyang Qinxin had instructed. From their exchange, Lin Xuan had pieced together the gist of the situation.  

The intruders, Liu Hai and Liu Tong, were once Biyun Mountain experts who had been expelled for unknown reasons.  

Though this had nothing to do with Lin Xuan, it piqued his curiosity. Even for a major sect like Biyun Mountain, Core Formation cultivators were valuable assets. They wouldn't be discarded lightly unless there was a compelling reason.  

After their expulsion, the two had nursed their grudges and sought revenge.  

Familiar with every inch of Biyun Mountain due to their former status, they had likely maintained ties with loyal disciples still in the sect.  

Taking advantage of the chaos during the Nascent Soul Conference, they had conspired with these insiders to dismantle the formations, storm the herb garden, and wreak havoc.  

This was Lin Xuan's speculation—not entirely accurate, but close to the truth.  

Just then, another courtyard came into view—the heart of the herb garden.
