# Chapter 194: Buddha Nation Underworld City

"Tsk, tsk, this truly is a qualitative leap," Zhou Tian sighed. If the system hadn't upgraded, killing Yuan Chi would have been an incredibly difficult feat. But after this upgrade, eliminating Yuan Chi was practically as easy as flipping his hand.

The biggest help, in fact, was the improvement of his own cultivation. As long as he could cultivate, he could train divine abilities, and using [Cultivation Replication] directly elevated his combat strength by an entire tier.

Saint Devil flew closer to Zhou Tian, a look of awe on his face. Zhou Tian's display of power just now had shocked him; he wondered what kind of fortuitous encounter Zhou Tian had obtained from the world's origin. He also mastered a divine ability like 'Pagoda Palm', but the one he unleashed and the one Zhou Tian unleashed were like heaven and earth, with significantly less power.

"You two are indeed powerhouses of the Nine Provinces, truly eye-opening," Huang Qi said, approaching from a distance. In truth, he was reluctant to come over. He could tell that Zhou Tian had gained immense benefits from the world's origin. Although he didn't understand what that Dharma Idol was all about, Yuan Chi's death at Zhou Tian's hands was undeniable. What if Zhou Tian went mad and simply slapped him to death? Wouldn't that be a massive loss?

However, he had a mission to fulfill, and the forbidden treasure had not been retrieved. The oaths made by both parties needed to be clarified, so he had no choice but to step forward and hash things out.

"So-so, just so-so. At my level, everyone in our Nine Provinces calls me a good-for-nothing," Zhou Tian waved his hand, saying casually.

Saint Devil also revealed a trace of a smile. What Zhou Tian said was indeed true.

"Fellow Daoist, you jest," Huang Qi clearly didn't believe him. "Who are you trying to fool? If you're a good-for-nothing, then there are no good-for-nothings left in the Star Realm!"

"However, Fellow Daoist, why did you avoid the Dao Heart Blood Oath just now? Could it be that you're somewhat curious about that forbidden treasure?" Huang Qi changed the subject.

"Uh..." Zhou Tian paused. Indeed, he was just a mortal a moment ago, without any cultivation. His so-called Dao Heart was nowhere to be found. What could he have done? However, telling Huang Qi this wouldn't convince him.

After some thought, Zhou Tian spoke: "To be honest, Fellow Daoist, there were indeed some unspeakable difficulties just now. However, at this moment, I can swear a blood oath that I will no longer covet that forbidden treasure."

Upon hearing Zhou Tian's words, Huang Qi's eyes flickered, and his smile somewhat faded. "Perhaps you two Fellow Daoists do not know, if this forbidden item were naturally formed, even if my Border Prison wanted to seize it, we wouldn't be so aggressive as to prevent outsiders from interfering. But this item was originally from my Border Prison. It's just that during ancient times, my Border Prison experienced some vicissitudes, causing this item to fall outside and be obtained by the tomb's master. To be frank with you two, the life of a great figure in my Border Prison depends on this forbidden item. My Border Prison is determined to obtain this!"

Huang Qi did not directly respond to Zhou Tian's words but instead explained why their Border Prison was so intent on acquiring this item. Hearing this, Zhou Tian secretly curled his lip. "What nonsense," he thought. "Since this thing flowed out from your Border Prison, it's no longer yours. Saying all this is just to threaten us." Zhou Tian was certain that if they dared to interfere in the struggle for the forbidden treasure, the Border Prison would dare to interfere in the war between the Nine Provinces and the Abyss Tomb.

Although he thought this inwardly, Zhou Tian said aloud: "I understand. Retrieving one's own lost treasures is only natural and righteous. Who would dare to say otherwise? Fellow Daoist, rest assured, we will absolutely not interfere."

"Excellent," Huang Qi nodded, feigning ignorance of the sarcasm in Zhou Tian's tone.

"However, if you fail to obtain that item due to your own reasons, you can't blame us," Zhou Tian added.

"Fellow Daoist, rest assured, my Border Prison is not an unreasonable force," Huang Qi said.

"That depends on whose 'reason' we're talking about," Zhou Tian thought. "For such major powers, black and white are whatever they say they are. One cannot trust them."

"Where is that forbidden treasure, Fellow Daoist? Do you know?" Zhou Tian asked. Then, as if remembering something, he continued, "Don't misunderstand, it's just that the two of us are heading to that Buddha's Palm Kingdom. We're afraid you might misunderstand something, so we're giving you a heads-up in advance."

"The forbidden item is also there," Huang Qi replied. At this point, Huang Qi no longer bothered to hide anything. Hiding it now would only make it more awkward when they inevitably met in that Buddha Nation Underworld City. Currently, only that Buddha Nation Underworld City was still exhibiting astonishing phenomena. It was perfectly reasonable for Zhou Tian and Saint Devil to head there in search of fortuitous encounters.

Just then, Zhou Tian's immense aura rapidly dissipated, like a deflating balloon, until only the aura of a Dharma Idol Realm cultivator remained. However, there were no visible changes on Zhou Tian's face; he appeared as if nothing had happened, and he asked Huang Qi, "Shall we go together?"

Huang Qi's eyes flickered. He couldn't figure out what was going on with Zhou Tian. Was it some forbidden technique? But Zhou Tian's face showed no unusual expressions, nor did he look injured. What kind of forbidden technique could grant a Dharma Idol Realm cultivator the combat strength of a Heavenly Venerate without any backlash?

After a moment's pause, a smile appeared on his face. "I couldn't ask for more."

The three of them set off towards the giant Buddha. Huang Qi did not bring up the matter of Zhou Tian swearing a Dao Heart oath again. The words had been made very clear: if Zhou Tian still insisted on acting, even if he succeeded, the Border Prison was confident they could retrieve it, and they could also deter the various heavens. Although the Border Prison hadn't acted for many years, it was still a super force occupying the third spatial node in the Star Realm!

Two streaks of light streaked across the sky. Since Zhou Tian no longer possessed the power of a Dao Master, Saint Devil was now carrying him on their journey. Although the two moved extremely fast, the true form of this realm was unknown, and its span was vast.

In an unknown direction, the eyes of those Heavenly Kings flickered. They gazed towards the giant Buddha, hesitant, but finally, seeing their empty hands, they rose into the air again, tearing through space and departing. If they had obtained some of the world's origin, they would have given up the idea. With three Dao Masters present, snatching food from a tiger's mouth was not as simple as it sounded. There were many coincidental elements when seizing the world's origin, but this time, they weren't so lucky. But now they had obtained nothing, leaving them deeply unwilling. To enter a Heavenly Venerate's place of Nirvana and gain nothing felt utterly shameful to speak of.

Only one person stood for a long time, his gaze piercing. He let out a bitter laugh, then turned and left, a divine golden spear gleaming in his hand, its tip flickering with sharpness. It was the Spear-wielding Heavenly King. He was the only remaining rogue cultivator. Unlike the others, such as the Four Heavenly Dragons of Tianyan, the Golden-Armed Ape, and the Heavenly King who used golden paper, who all had considerable backgrounds, he had no great backing or trump cards. The only thing he could rely on was his cultivation as a Half-step Dao Master.
