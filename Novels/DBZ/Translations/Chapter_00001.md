# Chapter 1: The Li Family of Misty Mountain  

In the cultivation world of Zhao Kingdom, at the Li family's stronghold in Misty Mountain.  

After three months of arduous travel, a man finally arrived at his destination.  

"Halt! This is the territory of the Li family of Misty Mountain. Who are you?" Before the man could even approach the family's estate, a guard immediately stepped forward to challenge him.  

The man removed the pack from his shoulder and replied, "My name is Wei Qian. I came here after hearing the recruitment announcement from the Taichang Merchant Guild. They said the Li family of Misty Mountain is hiring tenant farmers."  

The guard promptly went to report, and soon a steward emerged.  

With a skeptical gaze, the steward scrutinized Wei Qian from head to toe. "If you came because of the announcement, why didn’t you travel with the Taichang Merchant Guild’s group?"  

Wei Qian forced a helpless smile. "I didn’t have the money. I wanted to save some spirit stones, so I decided to walk here."  

The steward sighed in resignation after another once-over. "You’re one lucky bastard. Come on in."  

Wei Qian was led to a small town at the foot of Misty Mountain, populated mostly by mortals.  

Even at the base of the mountain, the spiritual energy was far denser than the outside world, thanks to the proximity to the second-grade spiritual vein running through Misty Mountain.  

As soon as Wei Qian entered, he couldn’t help but take a deep breath, utterly intoxicated by the rich spiritual energy.  

"This place is excellent. If the host family isn’t too bad, I might just settle here for the long term."  

He sighed inwardly. "I started cultivating at twenty, and now at twenty-four, I’m only at the first level of Qi Refinement. My progress is painfully slow."  

There were many reasons for this. The most significant was that the places he had stayed before had abysmal spiritual energy concentrations. The best location he had lived in before only had a mid-grade first-grade spiritual vein—nowhere near as good as this place.  

The steward arranged for Wei Qian to stay in a small courtyard for the night.  

Not wanting to waste a single moment in such an auspicious environment, Wei Qian spent the entire night meditating and cultivating.  

With each breath, wisps of spiritual energy were drawn into his body, circulating through his meridians before settling into his dantian, gradually converting into strands of spiritual power.  

By dawn, when the rooster crowed, he finally ended his session, exhaling a turbid breath as he opened his eyes.  

"Having a low-grade spiritual root really is a disadvantage."  

This was the second major reason for his sluggish cultivation speed.  

In this world, the path of cultivation was known as the "Spiritual Root Method."  

Everyone possessed a spiritual root, but the vast majority of people had roots too weak to support cultivation—effectively rendering them rootless.  

Among those with usable spiritual roots, there were five grades: low, mid, high, earth, and heaven.  

The better the spiritual root, the faster the cultivation speed and the fewer the bottlenecks. Conversely, weaker roots meant slower progress and more obstacles.  

"But this situation is about to change."  

As if recalling something, a faint smile flickered across Wei Qian’s face before vanishing just as quickly.  

Closing his eyes, he focused inward, immersing his consciousness into his spiritual sea.  

Within an endless void of chaos, a radiant pearl floated, its surface shimmering with light. Inside the pearl, the faint silhouette of a dragon coiled and uncoiled in perpetual motion.  

This was Wei Qian’s golden finger—his cheat as a transmigrator—the **Wish-Dragon Pearl**!  

That’s right. He wasn’t a native of this world but a soul from Earth who had died unexpectedly and reincarnated into this cultivation realm with his memories intact.  

Facing the pearl, Wei Qian suppressed his excitement. "Dragon Pearl, I wish to enhance my spiritual root!"  

He had made this exact wish for nine hundred and ninety-nine consecutive days. Today marked the thousandth.  

Now, the accumulated power of a thousand days of wishing finally reached a critical mass—quantity transforming into quality.  

A dragon’s roar echoed through the void, followed by a voice both ethereal and grand, as if descending from the heavens: "As you wish."  

Back in the real world, Wei Qian slowly opened his eyes, clenching and unclenching his fists.  

He immediately resumed his meditation, channeling spiritual energy. If before, each cycle of energy flow had been as thin as a single strand of hair, now it was as thick as ten strands—a tenfold increase!  

His spiritual root had advanced from low-grade to mid-grade!  

To celebrate this thousand-day milestone, Wei Qian decided to reward himself with a full day of cultivation.  

Meanwhile, outside the courtyard, the steward arrived at the gate.  

A nimble man silently leaped from the rooftop tiles, landing as lightly as a cat.  

The steward narrowed his eyes. "Well? Any anomalies?"  

The man shook his head. "Nothing unusual. Seems like he’s never stayed in a good place before—he was meditating the entire night without rest."  

The steward chuckled. "A rogue cultivator can’t compare to our cultivation family. If not for that incident a while back, even a tenant farming position wouldn’t be open to someone like him."  

Adjusting his expression, the steward knocked on the door with a genial smile.  

"Young friend Wei, please come with me. The family head wishes to see you."  

The Li family of Misty Mountain wasn’t particularly ancient, with a history of only two hundred years.  

Following their generational naming poem—*"Misty Mountain passes ancestral legacy, the path of immortality stretches eternal. A clear heart comprehends true meaning, steadfast will shatters all barriers"*—the current family head was of the eighth generation, named **Li Wanlong**.  

True to his name, the family head was a dignified middle-aged man whose imposing aura pressed down on Wei Qian the moment they met.  

"At least at the seventh level of Qi Refinement!"  

Noticing how Wei Qian’s face flushed under the pressure yet his spine remained unbending, a glint of surprise flashed in Li Wanlong’s eyes.  

"This kid really doesn’t seem like a spy from the Wang family of Blackwater Pond. Their people lack this kind of unyielding resolve."  

A pity, though—he was already too old, and his cultivation was mediocre. His future prospects were undoubtedly limited.  

After further evaluation, if nothing suspicious turned up, perhaps he could arrange a marriage with a mortal woman from a collateral branch and take him in as a son-in-law.  

With that thought, Li Wanlong withdrew the pressure he had intentionally released and smiled amiably.  

"Our Li Immortal Clan is indeed recruiting tenant farmers at the moment."  

"Our terms are as follows: a cultivation site on a mid-grade first-grade spiritual vein, ten pounds of spirit rice per month, and two low-grade spirit stones. The tenant contract lasts twenty years. If either party breaks it prematurely, compensation must be paid. Do you accept?"  

The offer far exceeded Wei Qian’s expectations. Among the tenant farming conditions in the cultivation world, this was already mid-to-high tier.  

"I accept."  

"Good. Then let’s sign the spiritual contract."  

Li Wanlong produced a first-grade contract scroll. After both parties confirmed the terms, they signed without hesitation.  

Once Wei Qian inscribed his name and left his spiritual imprint, his status officially became that of a Li family tenant farmer.  

As the family head, Li Wanlong wasted no time.  

"Steward Fu, take young friend Wei to the spirit fields where the **Jade Crystal Rice** is grown. Have someone show him the ropes—he can start working immediately."  

Just as Steward Fu led Wei Qian out, a young woman in a green robe and flowing skirt brushed past them, entering the hall.  

Her bright eyes sparkled like stars, her skin as flawless as polished jade.
