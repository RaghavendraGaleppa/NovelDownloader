# Chapter 26: Potential

Zhi Shan, the Taoist priest, didn't refute Fu Song's words but muttered under his breath, "We haven't even found Master's remains yet. Elder Uncle is being too hasty."

Ignoring his senior disciple, Fu Song assumed the role of host and invited Zhou Qing and his companions into Qingfu Palace for discussions, taking the letter from Zhi Shan's hands along the way.

Entering the temple and settling in the guest reception hall, they introduced themselves. When Fu Song learned of Miss Lin's background and Zhou Qing's identity, his eyes lit up.

Through their conversation, Zhou Qing learned from Fu Song and Zhi Shan that Qingfu Palace once flourished with hundreds of members. However, after an internal conflict, only twenty-some priests remained. Since Fu Shan took over as leader thirty years ago, members had gradually passed away or left the mountain. Now, only two remained from the Fu generation and four from the Zhi generation—Fu Shan, who was lost in the mountains, being counted among them.

The Western Mountains stretched endlessly, making finding someone there akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. The remaining members of Qingfu Palace, including Fu Song, had searched day and night for a long time. Fu Song even claimed his earlier blunder was due to exhaustion from searching for his senior brother.

Neither Zhi Shan nor the others contradicted this, so Zhou Qing and Miss Lin tentatively accepted the explanation.

Zhou Qing tactfully interrupted Fu Song's complaints to ask, "So, Priest, does that mean no one else at Qingfu Palace knows the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture now?"

Fu Song cleared his throat. "Actually, our sect's truly profound and difficult practice isn't the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture. It's just that successive leaders have cultivated this..."

Zhou Qing felt somewhat speechless. After letting Fu Song ramble, he asked again, "Priest, do you have any other methods to treat my friend's leg injury?"

Fu Song coughed and passed the question to Zhi Shan. "Zhi Shan, you explain to Scholar Zhou."

Zhi Shan had already carefully examined Butcher Hu's injuries. Having followed Fu Shan for many years, he'd observed his master treating patients who came from afar seeking help. While he couldn't perform treatments himself, he could assess injuries with about seventy to eighty percent accuracy.

The Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture was too profound—even Fu Shan hadn't fully comprehended it. Seeing that none of his disciples showed talent for it, and with his junior brother Fu Song focused on the Taiyue True Form Talisman Scripture, Fu Shan hadn't insisted on passing down the Rejuvenation technique.

"Scholar Zhou, Young Master Lin, which physician previously treated this gentleman's legs?"

Zhou Qing replied, "Not a physician—I performed some basic treatment myself. Is there a problem?"

Zhi Shan nodded. "It seems Scholar Zhou has some medical knowledge, otherwise Mr. Hu's injuries would have worsened. If my master were here, combined with his unique Black Jade Ointment, Mr. Hu's legs could recover nearly completely. But currently, no one in our sect has mastered the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture, and master stopped making the Black Jade Ointment in his later years—we've exhausted our stock. In our sect, Elder Uncle has the highest aptitude, but he never studied these techniques. After him comes our master. As for disciples like myself, we're simply too dull-witted for such arts..."

Miss Lin frowned. "So there's no solution?"

Zhi Shan said, "Perhaps there are other skilled physicians nearby, but with our limited abilities, we're truly powerless."

Miss Lin pressed, "This injury was inflicted by a martial artist intending to cripple him. Within the city and surrounding areas, apart from your esteemed sect, no one else could treat such external injuries. Please reconsider."

Zhi Shan fell silent in thought.

Miss Lin turned to Fu Song. "Priest, my grandfather's letter speaks truthfully."

Fu Song opened the envelope and read its contents, his expression brightening. He said to Zhi Shan, "Zhi Shan, since Young Master Lin asks you to find a solution, you should try. Whether it works or not, offering an idea is better than nothing."

Zhi Shan sighed. "What solution can this disciple offer? But since Elder Uncle insists... Scholar Zhou achieved first rank in Jiangzhou's provincial examinations, demonstrating exceptional talent. With his medical knowledge, if Elder Uncle has no objections, perhaps Scholar Zhou could study the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture. With his extraordinary aptitude, he might comprehend its essence and even recreate the Black Jade Ointment."

Fu Song objected, "What kind of solution is that? Even if Scholar Zhou is brilliant, mastering the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture can't happen overnight. Mr. Hu is injured now—can he wait that long?"

Zhi Shan explained, "This disciple knows some external injury treatments to stabilize Mr. Hu's condition. But if no other treatment is found within months, even if master were to intervene later, full recovery would be nearly impossible."

Fu Song conceded, "In that case, there might still be hope."

He paused, looking at Miss Lin thoughtfully. "Young Master Lin, since Elder Lin has sent this letter, our sect must do everything possible to heal Mr. Hu. However, the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture is a secret technique reserved for our sect leader. Due to sect rules, it cannot be shared. What do you think..."

Miss Lin proposed, "Abbot Fu Song, I understand your dilemma. How about this—in addition to my grandfather's letter, I'll prepare an equivalent gift. But I ask that your sect provide Scholar Zhou with the complete Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture, including the late abbot's notes. If Scholar Zhou encounters difficulties, please share all relevant knowledge with him."

Fu Song smiled. "My original thought was to have Scholar Zhou nominally join our sect—no ordination required, just as a lay practitioner. This would resolve the issue. Although the scripture is traditionally for sect leaders, our Taoist practice follows nature's flow without rigid constraints. As current abbot, I can modify old rules—future leaders must cultivate the Taiyue True Form Talisman Scripture, while the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture becomes optional. Since Young Master Lin makes such a generous offer, I won't refuse."

Pointing at Zhi Shan, he said, "Zhi Shan, call your junior brothers to meet your new Elder Uncle."

"Elder Uncle?" Zhi Shan looked up, confused.

Fu Song said sternly, "Although Scholar Zhou remains a lay practitioner, I'm accepting him as our master's disciple on his behalf. What's wrong with you all addressing him as Elder Uncle?"

After a moment of surprise, Fu Song whispered instructions to Zhi Shan, whose face lit up before he hurried to the backyard to summon his junior brothers, explaining along the way.

Thus, Zhou Qing inexplicably became an unordained disciple of Qingfu Palace, sharing the same seniority as Fu Song, the current highest-ranking member. Facing several "nephew-disciples" all older than himself paying respects left Zhou Qing both amused and embarrassed.

Miss Lin had arranged everything for him.

Later, Zhou Qing accompanied Miss Lin partway down the mountain. On the path, he told her, "Please record all expenses for Brother Hu's treatment under my name. I'll repay every coin with interest in the future."

"Scholar Zhou, you're quite interested in the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture, aren't you?" Miss Lin replied with a smile, sidestepping his statement.

"Yes, very much so."

"Then I didn't err—saving a life while giving you something valuable. An excellent bargain. Farewell, Scholar Zhou. Until we meet again." With a wave, she and her two guards disappeared into the mountain mist.

Zhou Qing watched until her figure vanished completely before returning to Qingfu Palace. From then on, he would devote significant effort to studying the Rejuvenation Talisman Scripture.

"Health Preservation Master, let me see your potential."
