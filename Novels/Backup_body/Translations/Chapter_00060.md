# Chapter 60: Elder Gu Passes Away Overnight! The New Creditor Emerges in Seven Days!  

“The sixth backup vessel of the original Thousand Illusion Divine Lord?”  

“An existence at the Human Immortal realm?”  

Li Zhengjing placed the shattered jade fragment on the table.  

This was the “divine artifact” that Yuan Zhengfeng had obtained back then!  
It was precisely because of this object that Yuan Zhengfeng had sensed something amiss and avoided having his body seized by the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.  

Of course, Yuan Zhengfeng’s current state—abandoning his physical form and hiding his soul within the jade fragment, suspended between life and death in a prolonged slumber—was hardly a favorable outcome.  

Picking up the shattered jade fragment, Li Zhengjing’s expression grew complicated. He thought to himself, *“Yuan Zhengfeng, at eighty-five years old, had already been marked as a backup vessel for the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord in his youth.”*  

*“This means the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord has been selecting backup vessels within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect for decades, perhaps even a century.”*  

*“Yuan Zhengfeng only learned of his predicament after obtaining this jade fragment.”*  

*“And I, thanks to the Golden Scroll, have also uncovered the truth.”*  

*“I once believed that with the Golden Scroll, I could evade all dangers and eventually reach the Human Immortal realm to confront the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.”*  

*“Perhaps Yuan Zhengfeng once held the same belief—striving for the Human Immortal realm to oppose the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord!”*  

*“Yet even after attaining the Human Immortal realm, he was ultimately forced to abandon his cultivation, discard his body, and hide within this jade fragment, trapped in an endless slumber—neither truly alive nor dead!”*  

Clutching the so-called “divine artifact,” Li Zhengjing muttered inwardly, *“Thousand Illusion Divine Lord… just how powerful are you?”*  

He looked out the window. Within this vast immortal sect, how many high-ranking figures were secretly colluding with the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord?  
Among the sect’s many outstanding disciples and elders, how many were merely backup vessels for him?  

*“Decades ago—perhaps even a century ago—he was already selecting backup vessels. Yet even now, he continues to do so!”*  

*“This suggests he is patient, having waited for an extremely long time.”*  

*“But what kind of vessel is he waiting for? After all these years, he still hasn’t found one that satisfies him?”*  

*“Is he waiting for a true ‘Eternal Sacred Body’?”*  

As these thoughts crossed his mind, Li Zhengjing consoled himself, *“At least we’ve identified ‘Elder Gu’ for now. Now that he’s surfaced, he’s no longer an unknown and mysterious threat…”*  

Just as he was about to stand up, a resounding bell toll echoed through the air!  

His expression changed instantly as he looked up.  

The bell tolled again—six times in succession!  

An elder had fallen!  

His heart trembled, and he rushed out without delay.  

“Master, where are you going?”  

The wall-clinging bird, seeing him leave in such a hurry, was puzzled.  

Li Zhengjing didn’t respond. He left the courtyard and didn’t return until half an hour later, his spirit seemingly broken.  

“Master, what happened?”  

The bird fluttered over to him.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree scurried closer, its branches waving in concern.  

“Elder Gu has passed away.”  

Li Zhengjing’s voice was heavy, his eyes filled with complex emotions. “Xin Xuan’s poison infiltrated his heart meridian. Despite prolonged treatment, he succumbed this morning.”  

He waved his hand dismissively, his mood somber, and retreated into his room.  

The bird and the tree exchanged glances.  

“Master only met Elder Gu once. Why is he so heartbroken?” The bird rubbed the green horn on its head with a wing, baffled.  

“Elder Gu gave Master a gift. He must have been a kind and benevolent elder,” the tree reasoned.  

“That makes sense.” The bird felt somewhat relieved but couldn’t help wondering, *“Since Elder Gu died in the line of duty, the Ancient Moon Peak will likely hold a feast soon. I wonder what kind of wine they’ll serve?”*  

“…”  

Back in his room, Li Zhengjing gripped the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, silent and brooding.  

Elder Gu had died from Xin Xuan’s poison.  

If this had been an ordinary inner sect elder at the True Qi realm, he wouldn’t have found it unusual.  

But how could Elder Gu die?  

Just to use the Golden Scroll to uncover his secrets required over a hundred spirit stones of refined quality!  

How could such an unfathomable figure perish so easily?  

*“He couldn’t have died! He is the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord!”*  

Li Zhengjing tightened his grip on the saber, his gaze solemn. *“I just uncovered his identity, and now he’s vanished back into the shadows…”*  

With Elder Gu dead, who would the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord become next within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect?  

Or… had he truly died?  

Had his identity been exposed, leading to a silent execution by the sect’s higher-ups?  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the Golden Scroll. The words “Third Backup Vessel of the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord” remained starkly clear.  

Elder Gu was dead, but the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord still lived!  

Rubbing his temples, Li Zhengjing retrieved the shattered jade fragment, his expression shifting. *“Elusive and unpredictable… I suppose Elder Yuan must have felt just as helpless back then.”*  

Meanwhile, atop Ancient Moon Peak…  

The head of the Law Enforcement Hall presented a register with both hands.  

“This is the list of disciples Elder Gu previously compiled.”  

“Has Elder Gu been buried properly?”  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master accepted the register, his expression indifferent as he scanned the names. “Make sure the coffin is sealed tight, the nails are hammered in, and the grave is firmly packed. Set up an array—we don’t want any ‘resurrections.’”  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master chuckled. “As per your instructions, we’ve already laid down an array.”  

“Then it’s settled.”  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master handed the register back. “The list is accurate. Proceed as planned. However, I’ll be taking one additional person.”  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master immediately understood. “Li Zhengjing?”  

The Peak Master nodded slowly. “Previously, it was mere speculation that this young man held significant importance to the ‘Creditor’ after entering the inner sect. But after he slew Xin Xuan in Xuanling Prefecture, it’s now confirmed!”  

Xin Xuan was far too important—he couldn’t die in Xuanling Prefecture, let alone at the hands of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  

Thus, to gauge Li Zhengjing’s worth, Xin Xuan had been the perfect measure.  

In the events of Xuanling Prefecture, the Creditor had prepared another protective talisman for Xin Xuan, originally meant for Siyecheng.  

But when Li Zhengjing was dispatched to the southwest of Xuanling Prefecture by Chen Xuan—placing him in danger—the Creditor’s talisman was redirected there, abandoning Xin Xuan.  

Yet Li Zhengjing had defied expectations, refusing to go southwest and instead killing Xin Xuan!  

“I had considered that if Peak Master personally ordered Li Zhengjing to descend the mountain and Xin Xuan killed him, the aftermath would be difficult to manage,” the Law Enforcement Hall Master said quietly.  

“Who could have imagined that Li Zhengjing, at the Inner Qi realm, would slay someone like Xin Xuan?”  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master replied coolly, “Had Li Zhengjing died, the Creditor might not have let it go.”  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master whispered, “But with Xin Xuan dead, the Creditor remained unmoved, as if nothing had happened.”  

The Peak Master clasped his hands behind his back. “Thus, Xin Xuan couldn’t die by the sect’s hand—but he could die by this young man’s. Because Li Zhengjing carries more weight than we anticipated.”  

With a wave of his hand, he added, “We depart tomorrow. Make the arrangements.”  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master nodded. Glancing at the register, he asked, “Should Li Zhengjing’s name be added before submitting it to the main peak’s hall?”  

“Submit it as is. No additions.”  

The Ancient Moon Peak Master’s voice was calm. “Remember this—during my absence, Li Zhengjing remains in his inner sect residence, cultivating in seclusion, never setting foot outside. Understood?”  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master bowed. “Understood!”  

The Peak Master exhaled slowly. “In seven days, the Creditor will re-emerge. Within these seven days, erase all traces linking me to Li Zhengjing.”  

His expression turned grave as he thought, *“Within seven days, I must return to the mountain with Li Zhengjing—provided the boy survives Fengdu Mountain…”*  

*“Seven days remain.”*  

His eyes gleamed with a chilling light as he silently vowed, *“If this succeeds… I shall become the new Creditor!”*
