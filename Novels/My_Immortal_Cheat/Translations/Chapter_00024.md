# Chapter 24: Overview of the Nine Provinces

“Zhou Tian, this competition is a rare grand event, I want to go see it... but... if you really don't want me to...” Tian Ling said, biting her lip, her words trailing off, but Zhou Tian understood her meaning.

Zhou Tian truly didn't understand what was so good about fighting and killing. Wasn't it better to be a useless person who just ate and waited for death every day?

Seeing Tian Ling's anxious expression, Zhou Tian felt a bit helpless. Tian Ling was far too sensitive, afraid that anything she did wrong would become a pretext for the Tianqin Empire to cause trouble for the Haotian Sect.

Zhou Tian knew that if he insisted on not letting Tian Ling go, she would most likely give up. She had, after all, been married to Zhou Tian as a price for atonement, and in reality, held little status in the Zhou family. If Zhou Tian were to adamantly forbid her, she probably wouldn't even be able to leave the Clover Garden.

However, Zhou Tian was a transmigator, and his worldview was still very different from this world's. Tian Ling was now practically his girlfriend, and how should one treat a girlfriend in the 21st century?

Of course, by doting on her!

A smile appeared on his face. He reached out and gently pinched Tian Ling's soft, watery cheek, savoring the delicate touch, and said, "Silly girl, if you want to go, then go. Don't overthink it. If you're happy, I'm happy..."

Tian Ling didn't bother swatting away Zhou Tian's "perverted hand." She lifted her head to look at Zhou Tian, her clear, gem-like eyes truly beautiful.

A tear slid down her cheek, her bright eyes clouded with mist. When she came, countless people from the Haotian Sect had warned her to be careful with her words and actions, to observe others, and not to anger the imperial family. She didn't know why everyone had become so strange; even the Sect Master of Haotian Sect, who had raised her, had only indifference in his eyes.

Her psychological pressure was immense, so immense that she couldn't bear it. Until this moment, in the afterglow of the setting sun, her future husband spoke these words: "If you're happy, I'm happy..."

It was such a plain sentence, yet for some reason, her eyes filled with tears, as if the burden she carried had suddenly disappeared, and everything had a reliance.

Tian Ling stepped forward, wrapped her arms around Zhou Tian's waist, and buried her head in his embrace, silently sobbing.

Zhou Tian was still a bit bewildered, not understanding why the girl in front of him had suddenly lost control of her emotions. Could it be because of the phrase "If you're happy, I'm happy"? How irresponsible was that sentence? If he had said that to a girl in his previous life, she would probably have given him several eye rolls.

However, feeling the girl sobbing in his arms, Zhou Tian placed his hand on the back of her head, gently patting her as he said, "No matter what happens, you have me. You are my wife; even if you want the stars in the sky, I will pluck them for you!"

Shamelessly plagiarizing what Zhou Yi had said, Zhou Tian felt no remorse whatsoever.

……………

A quarter of an hour later, Zhou Tian was already rolling around on his bed, faint sounds emanating from him. Listening closely, one could hear: "That's what you get for pretending to be a saint... for pretending to be a sage... for not making a move..."

Zhou Tian was now filled with extreme regret. Why hadn't he kissed her when Tian Ling had lost control of her emotions just now? Now it was good; he wouldn't see her for several days, a huge loss.

"Sigh... never mind..." Zhou Tian sat up from the bed. After all, she would be his sooner or later.

"Go fetch me the information on the forces in the other provinces. Just the general details will suffice," Zhou Tian called out towards the door. Although it felt silly, Zhou Tian knew that someone was always following him closely to protect his safety. While they wouldn't enter his room without his permission, they were all powerful cultivators and wouldn't fail to hear him just because a door was in the way.

"Yes!" A muffled voice came from outside the door.

Then, as if Zhou Tian had suddenly remembered something, he added, "I want paper documents, not those jade slips!"

"Yes!"

In this world, information was stored on special jade slips that could hold a lot of data but required spiritual energy to activate. Zhou Tian had no cultivation, so he couldn't read jade slips and could only use paper documents.

A moment later, a stack of paper books appeared out of thin air on the table. Zhou Tian walked over, picked up the topmost one. It had no title. He opened it, and an ink fragrance wafted out. The ink on the first page hadn't completely dried yet, clearly indicating it had been hastily transcribed by hand for him.

"Truly decadent capitalist living!" Zhou Tian silently sighed, then flipped open the book and began reading with great interest.

Time passed second by second. In the blink of an eye, two hours had gone by. Zhou Tian stood up from the table, twisted his somewhat stiff neck, and let out a comfortable groan accompanied by the cracking sound of his bones.

It was already dark outside, and the full, jade-like moon cast down a hazy, luminous glow. Zhou Tian hadn't realized he had been reading for two whole hours, mainly because the information contained in these documents was too profound and mysterious, causing him to become immersed without even noticing.

The memories Zhou Tian currently possessed were not complete; only some deeply ingrained ones, such as those related to his father and the Zhou family, had been received. Other less important things, or those he had only glanced at, were lost. He had no memory of the Nine Provinces whatsoever, and only today did he fill in this missing piece of the puzzle in his mind.

This world was divided into Nine Provinces. The one he was currently in was Futian Province, controlled by the Tianqin Empire. The other major provinces were:

*   **Tianfo Province**, controlled by Luotian Temple. The entire province consisted of Buddhist practitioners, making it a Buddhist Kingdom on land!
*   **Wudao Province**, though called "Dao-less," was controlled by the Dao Alliance, comprised of many rogue cultivators.
*   **Daluo Province**, whose controlling force was the Daluo Academy. The fact that a single academy could control an entire province greatly surprised Zhou Tian.
*   **Litian Province**, controlled by an assassin organization named "Light." All its members were skilled assassins, and it held a great reputation throughout the Nine Provinces.
*   **Ling Province**, controlled by a Heaven's Mystery organization called "Fools." The Fools had many operations: observing celestial phenomena, divining heavenly secrets, practicing Feng Shui, and collecting and selling intelligence. The organization consisted of some of the smartest people, yet they called themselves "Fools," which was quite interesting.
*   **Bao Province**, where the JuBao Pavilion, the largest merchant organization in the Nine Provinces, resided. No one dared to imagine the amount of resources that flowed through it daily.
*   **Xie Province**, the Instrument Nation. Although called a nation, it was actually quite similar to Zhou Tian's previous life, governed by a system akin to a parliamentary one. They followed the Dao of Instruments, using various external objects to strengthen themselves, which felt somewhat like technology. Especially when he saw several mechs depicted in the documents, Zhou Tian felt as if he had transmigrated again. However, in reality, it was just a variant application of spiritual energy.
*   There was one more province, but this one was quite peculiar: it had no controlling power and was called the **Unclaimed Land**. The documents didn't have much in-depth information about it, only four words: "Dragons and snakes mixed!"
