# Chapter 55: Shop Income

The commercial street where Yifangzhai was located was already on the outskirts of the outer city, with its primary clientele being cultivators in the mid to low stages of Qi Condensation.

The shop's rent was two hundred spirit stones per year. According to Gao Yi, if business was normal, selling talismans could bring in about four hundred and fifty spirit stones annually. After deducting rent and the spirit stones for employee wages, he would net around two hundred spirit stones a year.

Two hundred spirit stones a year was actually a very generous income for an ordinary mid-grade Talisman Master. But for Lu Xu, it was somewhat insufficient.

“Gao Yi's production capacity is limited, and he still needs to cultivate. Producing around four hundred low-grade talismans a year is already quite a lot for him!” Lu Xu mused internally. “But I’m different; my production capacity is much higher than his! The only question is whether all these talismans can be sold once produced! Besides talismans, I also want to sell pills… No, let’s take it one step at a time. I’ll operate it for a few years first and see what the income is like!”

As Lu Xu thought this, he bid farewell to Gao Yi and returned to the shop.

There were two employees in the shop, both cultivators at the third level of Qi Condensation. They were both employees and talisman apprentices. Besides paying them wages, Gao Yi also taught them once a month. Gao Yi naturally hired these two employees because he didn't want to tend the shop every day. If he stayed in the shop constantly, he wouldn't have time to cultivate.

After Lu Xu took over the shop, he had no intention of firing these two employees. He, too, needed someone to help him watch the shop.

Seeing Lu Xu walk in, the two immediately bowed respectfully, addressing him as: “Shopkeeper!” Their faces held an uneasy expression, seemingly worried about their future prospects. If Lu Xu didn't employ them, they would have to find new work. If they couldn't, they would either have to risk their lives in the Myriad Monster Mountain Range or be forced out of Myriad Immortal City.

All cultivators who came to Myriad Immortal City harbored dreams. Some sought Foundation Establishment, others to learn a skill, or to accumulate a family fortune for their kin. Every year, countless dream-seekers arrived here, and every year, countless disheartened individuals left in gloom.

“Daoist Friend Gao said you two are loyal and reliable. Since that’s the case, I won’t dismiss you. You may continue to stay here!” Lu Xu nodded and said to the two.

One of them was a white-haired elder, eighty years old this year, named He Qi. The other was a middle-aged man, about fifty years old, named Luo Chuan.

“Thank you, Shopkeeper!”

Upon hearing this, the two immediately bowed, their faces revealing pleasant surprise.

“However, my rules are somewhat different from Daoist Friend Gao’s. As Daoist Friend Gao just told you, my talisman crafting level is quite high!” Lu Xu explained. “Therefore, I will produce a larger quantity of talismans. Because of this, the spirit stones you two receive from me annually will differ from what you received from Daoist Friend Gao!”

Hearing Lu Xu’s words, the two immediately tensed up, their hearts rising to their throats as they quickly perked up their ears to listen carefully.

“Firstly, your guaranteed income will decrease from twenty-five spirit stones per year to ten spirit stones per year!” Lu Xu stated. “Then, for every talisman you sell, you will receive five percent of the revenue. How much you earn depends on how many you can sell!”

Lu Xu presented his salary conditions. After listening, the two gradually showed expressions of difficulty.

“Hmm? What’s wrong? Do you find something unsuitable? If you have concerns, speak them!” Lu Xu prompted.

The two exchanged glances, saying nothing, but the dejection in their hearts was self-evident. In their view, Lu Xu was indirectly cutting their pay.

“May I ask, Shopkeeper, how many talismans can you craft in a year?” The white-haired elder, He Qi, pondered for a moment before finally speaking.

“That depends on how many you can sell!” Lu Xu replied. “You might not be familiar with my situation. I come from a cultivating family; my clan has multiple Talisman Masters and alchemists. Our family’s production will be much higher than Daoist Friend Gao’s!”

“So that’s how it is. Then this old man has no problems!” He Qi said.

Lu Xu glanced at the middle-aged man again, who also nodded and said, “I have no objections either.”

Lu Xu knew that these two didn't truly have no objections; rather, they intended to wait and see how many spirit stones they could earn from him before making a judgment. He didn't plan to explain much further. As long as these two got a taste of the benefits, they would naturally work hard to help him sell talismans.

“Since that’s the case, let us go to the Covenant Hall to re-establish the contract!” Lu Xu told the two, then turned and left the shop.

The two immediately followed.

The Covenant Hall was a very important place in Myriad Immortal City, an official establishment of the Merchant Alliance. The Merchant Alliance founded the city on commerce and prioritized credibility above all else. This Covenant Hall was precisely established to regulate commercial activities within the city. All shopkeepers would come here after hiring employees to establish contracts under the Merchant Alliance’s witness. Should either the shopkeeper or an employee violate the contract, they would be subject to punishment by the Merchant Alliance’s forces.

In Wei Kingdom, if you offended the Thousand Sever Sect, you could still flee to Yue Kingdom or Zheng Kingdom. Once you fled beyond Wei Kingdom, the Thousand Sever Sect would find it very difficult to deal with you. However, in the Eastern Barrens, if you offended the Merchant Alliance, you would have no choice but to flee into the Myriad Monster Mountain Range. The Merchant Alliance’s shops were established in every market city across the Nine Kingdoms, and their intelligence was always the most well-informed. Therefore, this kind of restraint by the Merchant Alliance was very effective. Even a cultivator like Lu Xu, at the seventh level of Qi Condensation, was unwilling to violate it, let alone two employees at the third level of Qi Condensation.

After establishing the contract with the two, Yifangzhai began its operation. Lu Xu would visit once every month, providing He Qi and Luo Chuan with a batch of talismans and offering them guidance in talisman crafting.

Thus, a year passed.

When it came time for the year-end summary, Lu Xu calculated that, thanks to the diligent sales efforts of the two employees, his shop had sold over seven hundred low-grade Tier 1 talismans throughout the year. After deducting rent, wages, and material costs, he had earned four hundred spirit stones.

“Consider this a test run. Now that they’ve had a taste of the benefits, those two will surely work even harder next year. I should also appropriately introduce some mid-grade talismans to increase income, and perhaps place a few bottles of pills to build reputation!” Lu Xu thought to himself. “Additionally, it’s time to boost my talisman crafting experience again!”

A few days later, he carried a pot of spirit wine and two packets of spirit rice cakes as he walked towards another courtyard in Fire Cloud Alley.

“Daoist Friend, who might you be?”

After the courtyard gate was knocked, a white-haired elder emerged, looking at Lu Xu’s unfamiliar face with some wariness.

“This one is Han Feiyu, a newly arrived Talisman Master in Myriad Immortal City. I heard that Daoist Friend Wang has extraordinary attainments in the Dao of Talismans, and specially came to pay my respects!”

“Oh, so it’s a fellow Talisman Master. Please, Daoist Friend, come in!” Upon hearing this, Talisman Master Wang carefully sized up Lu Xu, then stepped aside to invite him in.

Lu Xu entered the gate, following behind the white-haired elder towards the room. As he walked, he silently uttered in his mind:

“Check Talisman Dao experience!”
