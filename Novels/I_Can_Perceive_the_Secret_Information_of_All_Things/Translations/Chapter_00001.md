# Chapter 1: Perceiving All Things

**Yuanshen Temple**  
**Main Hall**  

"This cultivation manual contains the insights of my lifetime. Today, I pass it on to you. Study it day and night, and you will surely become invincible."  

A white-bearded elder sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion. From his robes, he retrieved a yellowed booklet and handed it to the young disciple beside him, who had been absentmindedly picking at a hangnail.  

*So Master is actually a hidden expert? He’s been carrying a peerless cultivation manual with him all along...* Xiao Ji thought reverently as he accepted the booklet.  

**[This is Liu Haizhu’s exceedingly tedious autobiography, documenting all the trivial grudges and melodramas of his years at Yuanshen Temple...]**  

**[Perception deepened. Cultivation +1.]**  

Liu Haizhu was his master’s unassuming name.  

The moment Xiao Ji touched the booklet, a strange phenomenon flashed through his mind, leaving him momentarily dazed. But soon, he understood what it meant.  

*You finally showed up, you bastard.*  

For two and a half years in this world, he had spent every night dreaming of hatching a cheat ability. Today, his wish had finally come true.  

Lost in thought, he couldn’t help but reminisce.  

In his past life, he had gone for his first-ever foot massage, opting for the premium 298-coin package. But the masseuse ended up cracking his spine. When he opened his eyes again, he was greeted by the deeply wrinkled face of an old man exclaiming in shock, "You’re not dead?"  

They had nearly come to blows.  

The original owner of this body had died from stabbing himself while practicing sword techniques. His master had assumed he was already dead—he had come that day to prepare the coffin. The tombstone was ready, and the burial site had excellent feng shui.  

Master and disciple had been at odds over the incident for days.  

"Look how happy you are. Not even a word of thanks for your master?" The old Taoist gazed fondly at his disciple, who seemed utterly stunned.  

Xiao Ji studied his master’s face, seeing the merciless passage of time. Considering how the old man’s memory had been failing lately, he could understand today’s behavior—his master was likely just getting senile. *Why did I get so excited too?*  

"Thank you, Master," Xiao Ji humored him. "But why only give it to me today? If you’d handed it over earlier, your disciple might already be invincible by now."  

Liu Haizhu stroked his long beard and cast a profound glance at the gloomy sky outside. "Today, I observed the celestial signs. The balance of the cosmos is shifting. It may soon be time for me to take action, so I thought to pass on my legacy in advance. You’ve performed well—I intend to secretly name you the next master of Yuanshen Temple."  

"Master, Yuanshen Temple only has the two of us. You could’ve just handed the title over openly." Xiao Ji felt a pang of sorrow. His master probably had Alzheimer’s.  

"Help me up," Liu Haizhu extended a hand, grimacing. "My legs are numb."  

*The man who claims he’s about to challenge the cosmos... has numb legs.* Xiao Ji dutifully helped his master to his feet.  

---  

**[Liu Haizhu, Master of Yuanshen Temple. Qi Refining Stage 3. Age: 80 years. Remaining lifespan: 26 years, 3 months, 24 days, 9 ke (刻), 15 xi (息)...]**  

The moment Xiao Ji touched his master, the information flickered through his mind before settling into this final result.  

*Well, that settles it.* All those tall tales his master had spun about moving mountains, slaying dragons, and terrifying underworld deities were pure fiction.  

"Don’t worry, Master. Numb legs won’t kill you. You’ve got at least another twenty-six years left—you’re perfectly healthy." Xiao Ji tried to console him.  

"Nonsense! How could my life be so short? Have I ever told you about the three-thousand-year standoff I had with the Barking Demon?" Liu Haizhu huffed. "Today was just bad posture. I should’ve crossed my right leg over."  

*He’s definitely talking about that chess match three days ago when he got into a scuffle with Old Liu from town.*  

Ah, the old man’s stubbornness knew no bounds.  

Out of respect, Xiao Ji played along, indulging his memory-addled master to lift his spirits. Then, he set about tidying Yuanshen Temple.  

Located in Willow Town, Longxiang Prefecture of the Great Li Kingdom, Yuanshen Temple wasn’t expansive, but it wasn’t small either. It had a main hall, side halls, a dining area, living quarters, and two courtyards shaded by ancient trees. The spacious grounds hinted at a once-prosperous past.  

Now, however, the temple had fallen into decline. Not a single worshipper visited even in broad daylight. Many areas had fallen into disrepair, exuding an air of decay.  

The worst was the badly peeling front gate, where the stone lions guarding the entrance had their carved orbs stolen—likely by some mischievous child—leaving them looking like abandoned strays.  

Xiao Ji busied himself around the temple, touching and examining everything.  

**[A damp talisman. Greatly diminished efficacy. Useful for repelling mosquitoes.]**  

**[A cracked gourd containing cheap liquor...]**  

**[A well-worn meditation cushion... Perception deepened. Cultivation +1.]**  

After a thorough inspection, Xiao Ji realized that not every object he perceived granted cultivation points.  

Curious about his own progress, he willed his status panel to appear.  

**[Name: Xiao Ji]**  
**[Age: 19]**  
**[Affiliation: Yuanshen Temple]**  
**[Spiritual Root: Erratic, barely detectable]**  
**[Realm: Qi Refining Stage 1 (9/10)]**  
**[Cultivation Technique: None]**  
**[Perception Range: Half an inch]**  

"Half... an inch?"  

The description was odd but precise.  

Initially, he had needed physical contact to perceive objects. Now, he could discern details from half an inch away.  

To test this, Xiao Ji crouched in the courtyard and hovered his finger half an inch above a line of ants busy stocking supplies.  

**[Three worker ants storing winter provisions. The one at the back stole a bite of the rice grain you dropped yesterday...]**  

Indeed, he had eaten dinner by the main hall’s entrance last night.  

For further verification, he tried perceiving other ants beyond the half-inch range—nothing happened. His range was strictly limited.  

*If I advance to Qi Refining Stage 2, will my range increase?*  

With only one point left to reach the next stage, he knew he’d break through today.  

His gaze landed on the large incense burner in front of the main hall.  

Xiao Ji walked over and hugged it.  

**[A ravenous incense burner. Low-grade Yellow Tier artifact... It hasn’t tasted incense offerings in three months... Perception deepened. Cultivation +1.]**  

Artifacts, like spirit stones, were classified into Heaven, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow tiers, with further subdivisions of high, medium, and low grades. This burner was the lowest of the low—no wonder Yuanshen Temple’s incense was so ineffective.  

A tingling warmth surged from his dantian, spreading through his limbs. His meridians felt smoother, his comprehension of cultivation clearer. A shiver of exhilaration ran down his spine.  

*This is it—the breakthrough.*  

**[Realm: Qi Refining Stage 2 (0/20)]**  
**[Perception Range: Three inches]**  

The change was small, but as his level increased, so would his perception radius. The future looked promising.  

Just then, a middle-aged man in fine silks entered through the temple gates. His attire marked him as wealthy.  

The man frowned upon seeing Xiao Ji, hesitated, but ultimately stepped into the main hall.  

As Xiao Ji guided him inside, he intentionally closed the distance between them to within three inches.  

**[Lu Jinyin of Willow Town. Deals in mountain goods. Owns three shops... The moment he saw you hugging the incense burner and shuddering, he nearly turned back. But for the sake of his beloved wife, he decided to stay and light an offering.]**
