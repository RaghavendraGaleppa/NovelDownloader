# Chapter 38: Jingtao Gate

The kick was immensely powerful, instantly scattering the girl's internal energy. Her muscles convulsed, and her body went limp, collapsing to the ground like a deflated leather ball.

The girl struggled unwillingly, propping herself up with her hands on the ground, trying to stand, but her body refused to obey. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't move an inch. A breath was trapped in her chest, unable to be exhaled, causing her eyes to bulge.

It was a long while before the girl managed to艰难地 (difficultly) catch her breath and spit it out. That kick just now had almost taken her life.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly from the sidelines, his expression indifferent. He simply stood quietly at the threshold, his arms hanging down.

He was extremely furious in his heart. Fortunately, his reaction was fast enough; if it had been someone else, that sword strike would have likely killed the person.

Xu Yunfan quickly scanned his surroundings left and right. Confirming that Qinghe Alley was completely empty, he no longer hesitated. He strode forward to the girl's side, reached out, and grabbed her clothes, lifting her up as easily as lifting a chicken, preparing to turn back.

Being targeted by such a malicious person, he felt an inexplicable surge of anxiety.

Moreover, this person started shouting and killing without asking for any explanation; he had to get to the bottom of this no matter what.

"Brother, please show some mercy!"

A voice full of vitality suddenly rang out from beside Xu Yunfan. Immediately after, a fierce gust of wind shot straight toward the back of his head.

Xu Yunfan's figure moved rapidly. He took a fierce step forward and quickly lowered his head, barely dodging that fierce palm. The palm wind whistled past the back of his head, causing his hair to fly wildly.

"Eh?"

The newcomer let out a sound of surprise, clearly not expecting that Xu Yunfan could so easily dodge his powerful palm strike just by stepping forward and lowering his head slightly.

This person is a master!

Just as the newcomer was about to withdraw and change his move, Xu Yunfan reacted with incredible speed. His hand shot back like lightning, and with terrifying speed, he accurately grabbed the newcomer's wrist.

In an instant, Xu Yunfan's waist and hips sank violently. The muscles all over his body, like a taut bowstring, suddenly swelled, stretching his originally loose clothes tight. Especially the right hand gripping the opponent's wrist—the clothes clung to his arm as if they were a skintight garment.

"Rise!"

The newcomer hadn't even had time to react when he felt the world spin. His entire body was uncontrollably thrown into the air.

Immediately after, a muffled *thud* sounded as he crashed heavily into a large bluestone by the riverbank. He couldn't help but let out a stifled groan from the pain.

The newcomer's reaction was also extremely quick. Using the momentum of the impact, he endured the pain shooting through his back, twisted his body in mid-air, and exerted force from his waist and hips. A burst of energy suddenly surged forth, allowing him to adjust his posture in the air and land steadily on the ground.

Only then did Xu Yunfan get a clear look at the newcomer.

The man had sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, a tall and imposing stature, and wore a set of green tight-fitting clothes. With every movement, his blood and energy surged powerfully. His muscles were taut, and even through the clothes, one could clearly see the strands of muscle bundles as strong as steel wire, pulsing vigorously with his movements.

The man's face no longer held its initial leisure and confidence; instead, it was filled with gravity as he stared intently at Xu Yunfan, who stood as steadily as a towering city wall within the alleyway.

He couldn't understand how, in such an inconspicuous small city, he could so easily run into a Martial Master who had completed the First Stage of Muscle Tempering. Moreover, this Martial Master had actually bought his house, completely disrupting his original plans.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly. The power he had just unleashed definitely exceeded a thousand catties. An ordinary person thrown so heavily to the ground by him would, at the very least, suffer broken bones and severe internal injuries, or even die. If they didn't die, they would be paralyzed.

Yet, when this man landed, he used an extremely ingenious technique to dissipate force, forcibly neutralizing Xu Yunfan's powerful strength.

Otherwise, even a Martial Master who had completed the First Stage of Muscle Tempering would find it difficult to withstand Xu Yunfan's full-force strike.

*Tap*, Xu Yunfan reached out a finger and lightly tapped the back of the girl's neck. The girl, who was still cursing, instantly fainted. He casually threw the girl onto the ground, then slowly walked toward the man.

Seeing Xu Yunfan show no mercy to the girl and act so decisively and ruthlessly, Qin Bo took a step back and assumed a stance, hurriedly explaining, "Brother, I am Qin Bo, a disciple of Jingtao Gate. I have come here entirely for this house."

"Several months ago, I put this ancestral home up for sale with the brokerage house to raise money to go learn martial arts. Now that I have returned with my skills accomplished, my only wish is to buy back this ancestral home. I went to the brokerage house to inquire today, only to find out that the house has already been sold."

Qin Bo said, glancing at the unconscious girl on the ground, his face showing a hint of helplessness and apology.

"My Junior Sister Fei grew up within the sect and is doted on by the elders, so she doesn't understand the ways of the world and has a somewhat spoiled personality. If she has offended you, Brother, I hope you can be magnanimous and forgive her. I am willing to give you some compensation, hoping that Brother will be generous."

These words were spoken with sincere emotion,配合着 (cooperated with) Qin Bo's earnest expression, making it seem like a genuine apology.

But upon closer reflection, it felt like he was casually brushing aside Junior Sister Fei's fault. With just the phrase "unfamiliar with worldly affairs and a bit headstrong," he glossed over everything, as if she had no ill intentions.

Moreover, he specifically mentioned that the Junior Sister's surname was Fei.

Over the past few days, Xu Yunfan hadn't just been burying his head in hard training.

Changfeng Tavern was bustling with people of different social strata. The private rooms on the second and third floors and the open hall on the first floor catered to the public, naturally gathering all kinds of people—traveling merchants and guests from all directions.

After eating and drinking their fill, these people liked to chat and talk freely.

Through this, Xu Yunfan had also heard of Jingtao Gate. It was a famous sect in Qingzhou, known for its muscle tempering techniques. The Jingtao Palm was even more renowned throughout Qingzhou, hailed as a unique skill.

The Sect Master, Fei Qi, was a master who had completed the Third Stage of Muscle Tempering with External Three Unifications. He was known to everyone in Qingzhou.

Junior Sister Fei...

Xu Yunfan's eyes were deep, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking.

Qin Bo's heart was also pounding with anxiety. He couldn't understand how a Martial Master could have bought his house. This made him inexplicably anxious. Could it be that the item he left in the house had leaked information?

Had the person in front of him already obtained the item?

"I have already bought this house," Xu Yunfan said calmly, his tone indifferent. "Since you want to offer compensation, bring me five hundred taels of silver. I will let bygones be bygones and let you two go."

The helpless, bitter smile that had been plastered on Qin Bo's face instantly froze. His expression turned cold as he said, "Brother, are you joking?"

"Who's joking with you?"

As Xu Yunfan spoke, he stomped heavily on Junior Sister Fei's stomach. Even though the girl was unconscious, she let out a pained moan from the kick.
