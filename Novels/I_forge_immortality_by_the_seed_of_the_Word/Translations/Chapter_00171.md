# Chapter 168: Disturbance in the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud

The rainbow light transformed by Zhang Jing paused momentarily in mid-air.

His gaze swept directly over the figures seated on the three mountain peaks.

In the next instant, he withdrew his gaze, an inscrutable expression flashing across his face.

"The seven supreme inheritances of the human race are said to be subtly divided into four different factions—this makes it quite evident."

The next moment.

Zhang Jing landed on one of the mountain peaks.

The dozens of people seated there immediately opened their eyes, friendly smiles appearing on their faces.

Seven of them even stood up enthusiastically to greet Zhang Jing.

"Haha, another fellow Daoist from our Taiyi Sect has arrived!"

"Fellow Daoist, why have you come so late?"

...

Before long.

Under the guidance of seven fellow cultivators from the Taiyi Dao Sect, Zhang Jing took a seat near the center.

Then, they began introducing themselves one by one.

"Fellow Daoist, I am Shen Chu, from the Ten Thousand Dragons Blessed Land of the Dao Sect," said a man in moon-white robes with a flying cloud jade crown atop his head, smiling.

He appeared quite young, no more than twenty-four or twenty-five years old.

Yet the faint trace of vicissitude inadvertently revealed in his eyes reminded Zhang Jing that a cultivator's age could not be judged by appearance—especially in the Celestial Realm.

Within its vast and immeasurable secret realms, treasures beyond count existed, many capable of restoring youth or preserving it eternally.

Like his own Longevity-Returning Spring!

As he pondered this, the others continued their introductions.

"Tan Jin, from the Vast Flames Blessed Land, greetings to you, fellow Daoist."

"Wei Lin, from the Supporting Wind Dharma Realm, greetings to you, fellow Daoist."

...

As their voices faded, the seven turned their gazes to Zhang Jing, seemingly awaiting his introduction.

They were intensely curious about this fellow Daoist who had arrived at the central area of the competition grounds only at the final stage—and who carried nearly twenty Proud Cloud Decrees with him.

On the opposite side.

"Two disciples from Blessed Lands, and five from different Dharma Realms..."

Zhang Jing mused inwardly.

A trace of surprise flashed through his mind.

Could it be that in the twenty-ninth competition grounds, he was the only cave heaven disciple from the Taiyi Dao Sect?

If so, perhaps the number of cave heaven disciples participating in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm was not large.

But then again, Zhang Jing reconsidered.

This situation was actually quite normal.

Compared to the vast number of Blessed Lands and Dharma Realms within the Dao Sect, the number of cave heavens was pitifully small.

On one hand, only True Monarchs of the Celestial Immortal realm had the power to carve out a complete cave heaven within the void.

On the other hand, within the Dao Sect, True Monarchs like his own master, Yuanming True Monarch—who were willing to open their cave heavens and widely accept disciples—were a rare minority.

Most would only accept a single disciple over millions of years.

After all, True Monarchs of the Celestial Immortal realm possessed boundless lifespans and eternal freedom—time held almost no meaning to them.

Snapping back to reality.

Zhang Jing met the gazes of the seven before him with a smile and said softly, "I am Zhang Jing, from the Crimson Brilliance Supreme Radiance Cave Heaven. Greetings to you all, fellow junior brothers."

His words sent a shock through the seven.

A cave heaven disciple! And from one of the Ten Great Cave Heavens, the Crimson Brilliance Supreme Radiance Cave Heaven at that!

Their twenty-ninth competition grounds actually had a senior brother from the Crimson Brilliance Supreme Radiance Cave Heaven? But why had they not heard even a whisper about him before now?

This was far too low-key.

In the next instant, as if realizing something, they hastily rose and spoke in unison with deep respect:

"Junior brothers were unaware of senior brother's arrival earlier. We beg your forgiveness for any offense."

"No matter. Please, junior brothers, be seated," Zhang Jing replied with a gentle smile.

Hearing this, the seven exchanged glances and visibly relaxed.

"Many thanks, senior brother."

Their commotion drew the attention of those around them.

Watching the scene unfold, many immediately understood—a cave heaven disciple of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect must have arrived.

In moments, numerous figures rose to greet Zhang Jing with reverence.

Zhang Jing responded to each with a smile.

About half an hour later, the surroundings finally quieted again.

Only then did Zhang Jing have time to carefully observe the other two mountain peaks a thousand zhang away and the figures seated upon them.

A contemplative gleam appeared in his eyes.

The peak he currently occupied was primarily filled with disciples of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect and the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect, along with some disciples from subordinate Celestial Immortal forces of the two great inheritances.

Thus, it went without saying.

One of the opposite peaks likely housed disciples of the Human Emperor's Dao Court and the Cosmic Star Hall, along with their subordinate forces.

As for the remaining peak.

Those seated there were probably connected to the two other supreme inheritances—the Primordial Demon Sect and the Yellow Springs Paradise.

As for the Great Sumeru Heaven, one of the seven supreme human inheritances, its disciples rarely ventured into the world.

Thus, Zhang Jing wasn't surprised by their absence here.

Moreover—

This was but one of a hundred competition grounds.

...

Time flowed steadily onward.

Unnoticed, the final day arrived.

The sky abruptly darkened.

A colossal face slowly materialized, its heavy gaze sweeping across each competition ground.

Below.

Zhang Jing, who had been watching the sky, suddenly sensed something and looked down at his hand.

In that instant, he saw the golden radiance flickering on the Proud Cloud Decrees he had obtained from others suddenly begin to dim and brighten erratically.

Within moments.

To Zhang Jing's astonishment, the numerous decrees in his hand gradually dimmed before vanishing entirely into nothingness.

"So each person can only possess one Proud Cloud Decree after all?"

A flash of disappointment crossed his eyes.

Just then.

The colossal face covering the sky revealed a smile before declaring in an impassioned tone:

"The number advancing to the next round is 113,513! Congratulations to you all!"

"The second round will commence in ten days. The victors shall receive a reward of 100 million units of fortune and obtain the Proud Sun Seal!"

With these words, the sky-spanning face slowly dissipated.

...

Standing where he was.

Zhang Jing lowered his gaze, as if to conceal the excitement in his eyes. He could clearly feel his breathing growing heavier.

100 million units of fortune!

To him at present, what an astronomical figure this was!

Ah—and upon leaving the secret realm this time, he could also claim the 20 million fortune reward from the first round.

Zhang Jing suddenly felt his vision brighten.

This wasn't metaphorical—it literally brightened.

In the span of a breath.

Zhang Jing realized a golden sun seemed to have appeared before him, its brilliance so intense it was nearly blinding.

What was this—?

Squinting against the glare, he looked closer.

His gaze immediately sharpened.

"The Proud Cloud Decree?" Zhang Jing muttered in surprise.

He glanced around.

Only then did he notice that identical phenomena were occurring before everyone around him—including his junior brothers.

Clearly, everyone's Proud Cloud Decrees were undergoing the same transformation.

Soon.

The dazzling golden radiance before him faded.

And along with it, the Proud Cloud Decree vanished.

"What exactly is happening?"

A flicker of bewilderment passed through Zhang Jing's eyes.

The next moment.

A peculiar mark slowly formed within his sea of consciousness—as if woven from countless profound Dao patterns, it resembled a wondrous golden sun radiating boundless light.

Beneath this golden sun, resplendent clouds faintly coalesced.

The two seemed an inseparable whole, exuding profound and mysterious significance.

At this moment.

As if sensing something, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed began to tremble violently, its five-colored spiritual light erupting brilliantly as it swirled without cease.
