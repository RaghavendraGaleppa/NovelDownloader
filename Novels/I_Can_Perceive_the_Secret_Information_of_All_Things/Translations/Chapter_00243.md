# Chapter 243: A Very Special Fate

It's quite rare for cultivators to fall from the sky, especially headfirst into the ground. 

Historical records do mention some cultivators fighting until their spiritual energy was depleted and their stamina exhausted, causing them to plummet from clouds or magical artifacts. Some woke up after long periods of unconsciousness and recovered, while others were directly killed by their enemies. Their fallen bodies might be eaten by wild beasts, and their artifacts could scatter everywhere, picked up by whoever happened upon them.

Xiao Ji was relatively fortunate. After battling the Fishing King—a Nascent Soul stage expert—for several days, he successfully killed him and seized all his treasures, including the most valuable Divine Wood Dragon-Fishing Rod. 

After cremating the Fishing King's body with immortal flames, Xiao Ji left the dangerous area. However, as his tension eased, his spiritual energy dispersed throughout his limbs, leaving him suddenly drained. Dizzy and disoriented, he fell straight from his Thunderbolt Sword, plunging headfirst into the soil alongside his weapon, with only his calves and feet sticking out.

Days passed.

A young boy, about eight or nine years old and named Huang Jiu, was foraging for wild vegetables in the wilderness. He had to find a way to secure his next meal—begging wasn't an option without territory, no one would hire him for work, and he lacked the strength to chop firewood. His only choice was gathering herbs, mushrooms, and wild greens. Fortunately, his homeland was free from natural disasters, and as long as he kept moving, he wouldn't starve.

That day, the boy discovered that the earth could grow not just mushrooms but also legs and feet.

Huang Jiu set down his tattered basket and crouched, cautiously approaching the strange limbs. In his left hand, he tightly gripped a rock; in his right, a wooden stick. 

When he reached the odd appendages, he poked them with the stick. 

He was far too curious—why would the ground sprout something so bizarre?

"Grrr—"

A muffled, strange sound emerged from beneath the earth.

Huang Jiu finally realized this might be a person—someone who had somehow buried their head in the dirt. 

Probably a wandering swordsman, given the similarly embedded sword nearby.

Though young, Huang Jiu was far braver than most his age. 

He decided to dig the person out.

With only his small shovel as a tool, he worked tirelessly. Yet, even as dusk approached, he hadn't managed to free the man. 

He had considered using the sword stuck in the ground, but it was immovable, and the surrounding soil was unusually hard.

He returned to the village, only to come back the next day.

Thanks to Huang Jiu's perseverance, after more than ten days, he finally unearthed the strange Daoist who had been "growing" in the soil.

Huang Jiu thought the man might still be alive—he had heard snoring sounds earlier, and the man's complexion wasn't deathly pale.

He had seen corpses before—their faces should be ghastly white.

But the Daoist wasn't breathing. There was no heartbeat, no pulse.

So this strange man must be dead.

He dragged the Daoist's "corpse" to a more secluded spot, covering it with branches and leaves. Days passed, but the Daoist remained unchanged.

"He's dead."

Huang Jiu suddenly felt that his own life wasn't so pitiful. Though his days were hard, at least he was alive and healthy.

The kind-hearted boy initially prepared to leave but then reconsidered and turned back.

Despite his youth, he carried regrets in his heart.

Two years prior, his parents had met tragedy in the mountains, leaving him alone to face life's hardships. The memory pained him deeply. He firmly believed that the dead should be buried, returned to nature.

So he began digging a grave.

After many days, he finally finished a rectangular pit. With great effort, he dragged the Daoist inside, arranging him in a standard resting position. He even used leaves to brush the dirt off the man's face.

Once the burial was complete days later, Huang Jiu felt something was missing. After some thought, he fetched a stick and planted it atop the small mound.

He didn't know the Daoist's name, nor could he write, so a stick was the best he could do.

As Huang Jiu walked away, he suddenly remembered his own future. He still needed to forage for wild vegetables. Glancing back at his handiwork, he realized something else was missing.

His stomach growled.

Food. Others would leave offerings for the deceased to eat on their journey to the afterlife.

But he had nothing to give.

He left.

Just before nightfall, Huang Jiu returned, standing before the simple grave and placing some of his gathered vegetables and fruits in front of it.

Darkness fell swiftly, thunder rumbling overhead as wild winds howled.

Huang Jiu had never seen such eerie weather.

Thick clouds blotted out the sky, lightning flashed intermittently, and deafening thunderclaps rattled his eardrums.

A bolt of lightning struck the small grave he had painstakingly built.

The impact scorched the earth black, vaporizing the stick he had placed there.

"What sins did this man commit to be struck by lightning even in death?"

Fearful, Huang Jiu grabbed his basket and prepared to leave. It was best to stay away from such a person—who knew if the lightning might strike him next?

"Thud—"

A muffled sound came from the scorched grave.

Huang Jiu couldn't resist looking back.

A filthy, mud-caked hand was emerging from the earth.

"A corpse coming back to life?" The boy's instincts screamed at him to flee.

But his legs felt like lead, immobile. He collapsed to the ground, trembling as he watched the hand.

One hand became two, and gradually, the Daoist—who had shown no breath, no pulse—climbed out.

Like a dog shaking off rainwater, the Daoist gave a full-body shudder, shedding mud and grime.

The sky began to clear. The clouds dispersed, the thunder receded, and the wind stilled.

Only the golden glow of dusk remained, casting a dreamlike radiance over the scene—over the Daoist's face.

The standing Daoist. The seated child.

One looking down, the other looking up, their silhouettes framed by the setting sun.

Life sometimes brings strange encounters—like this one between Xiao Ji and Huang Jiu.

"Was it you who buried me alive?" Xiao Ji asked.

Huang Jiu nodded.

Not yet nine, he had never attended school or heard many stories.

He had indeed buried the Daoist. Though the man had shown no signs of life at the time, he was clearly alive now—so yes, it counted as a live burial.

"You're not even going to deny it?" Xiao Ji was somewhat annoyed.

He already knew what Huang Jiu had done over those days—a child, acting out of innate kindness, had spent days burying a complete stranger. He ought to be grateful.

"But Daoist, you really are alive. When I found you, you were dead. After I buried you, you came back to life," Huang Jiu reasoned. "So when I buried you, it was a burial. Afterward, it became a live burial."

Xiao Ji: "..."

You'd make a great monk.

Such a spiritually gifted boy.

**[Huang Jiu, orphan, sixteen days shy of nine… Seeing you dead, he thought of his unburied parents and decided to give you a proper burial…]**

Given the bizarre fate of being buried alive by this child, Xiao Ji couldn't simply walk away. At the very least, he had to do something for the boy.

"You and I share a karmic bond. I'll give you two choices," Xiao Ji said. "First, I can send you to a reputable temple where you'll become a monk—never worrying about food or shelter, growing in wisdom, and eventually becoming a revered master. Second, you can become a wealthy magnate, living in abundance. Choose."

Both options were trivial for Xiao Ji to arrange.

Since fate had brought them together, he might as well act.

Huang Jiu barely hesitated before answering earnestly, "Life is precious. One must do meaningful things… I choose to become a wealthy magnate."

The boy had realized this Daoist was no ordinary man. How else could he return from the dead or summon such celestial phenomena?

"Would you like to reconsider?" Xiao Ji felt the boy's answer was too hasty.

Huang Jiu remained resolute. "Daoist, I've thought it through carefully."

Well, to each their own.

"Let's go. I'll take you to a town first." Xiao Ji decided to bring Huang Jiu to Longxiang County and have the magistrate arrange the boy's future.

"I need to return to the village first. I have some dried vegetables at home—I should take them with me," Huang Jiu said.

Xiao Ji pulled out a silver ingot. "Consider those vegetables sold to me. Is there anything else you regret leaving undone?"

Huang Jiu grew pensive. "I don’t want to leave my homeland."

A fair point—home was hard to abandon.

Xiao Ji produced a small pouch. "This contains over ten thousand taels of silver. I'll escort you home—the money is yours."

The boy had never seen so much silver. Gleaming white, it looked like dozens of taels. The Daoist's claim of "over ten thousand" seemed exaggerated.

But with that much money, he could become a wealthy landowner—buying houses, fields, livestock…

Under the sunset's glow, the two walked toward the village.

At the village entrance, Huang Jiu suddenly stopped, worried. "Daoist, if people find out I have so much money, thieves will come. There are bullies here who torment others…"

A valid concern.

Xiao Ji retrieved a talisman and a jade pendant from his storage pouch.

"Place this talisman on your main door—it will protect your home. Wear this pendant, but keep it hidden. It will shield you from harm." He handed both to the boy.

Huang Jiu accepted them gratefully.

---

Huang Jiu returned home.

Following Xiao Ji's instructions, he tied the pendant securely around his neck, hiding it beneath his clothes, and affixed the talisman to his front door.

With that done, he took the small pouch of silver to his bed.

The pouch contained what looked like dozens of taels—an unimaginable fortune to him.

He recalled the Daoist joking that it held "over ten thousand taels." Clearly an exaggeration, though not a very funny one.

Still, even dozens of taels were more than enough. With this money, he could start a small business and never have to forage for survival again.

He poured out the silver.

It kept coming—an endless stream.

Soon, his bed was covered in silver, far exceeding "dozens of taels."

Only then did Huang Jiu realize the Daoist hadn't been lying. The pouch truly held an astonishing amount of wealth.

Staring at the miraculous little pouch, Huang Jiu smiled.
