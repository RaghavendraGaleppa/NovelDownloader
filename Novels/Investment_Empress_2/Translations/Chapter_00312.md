“Central Plains style?”

Looking at the completely covering design, Li Mo said seriously:

“I think it’s not bad, but she probably wouldn’t like it.”

“What about this one?”

“This Central Plains style hasn’t captured the essence... it’s a bit lacking in elegance...”

“.....”

The shopkeeper looked at the young man for a few seconds, finding it amusing in her heart.

She took out a Southern Frontier style.

“How about this one?”

The gentleman, Little Li, fell silent for a long moment. It wasn’t a two-piece set, but a connected, one-piece style, made of semi-transparent black silk in the pattern of butterflies.

If paired with those special types of stockings...

He was, of course, a good young man with very pure thoughts.

But as everyone knows, Li Mo is a genius, and his associative ability has always been quite good.

At the same time, he has a very strong sense of imagery, and the effect on her upper body automatically appeared in his mind.

“When in Rome, do as the Romans do. It’s only reasonable.”

“.....”

The gentleman, Little Li, felt that as long as he was upright, he had nothing to fear.

Buying clothes that were more in line with the local local local local very.

The shopkeeper looked at the young man for a few seconds, thinking it was funny.

She took out a Southern Frontier style again.

“Is this one okay?”

The gentleman, Little Li, was silent for a long time. It wasn’t a two-piece set, but a connected, one-piece style, with material made of semi-transparent black butterflies.

If paired with those special stockings...

He was, of course, a good young man with very pure thoughts.

But as everyone knows, Li Mo is a genius, and his associative ability has always been quite good.

At the same time, he has a very strong sense of imagery, and the effect on her upper body automatically appeared in his mind.

“When in Rome, do as the Romans do. It’s only reasonable.”

“.....”

The gentleman, Little Li, felt that as long as he was upright, he had nothing to fear.

Buying clothes that were more in line with the local characteristics of the Southern Frontier was also very reasonable.

Hmm, some normal styles were also retained.

The shopkeeper gave them as gifts; she insisted on giving them.

.....

In the inn.

After soaking in the medicinal soup for a small half-hour, the medicinal power and water vapor steamed out a faint fragrance, and also reddened the face of the person inside.

“Why isn’t he back yet...”

Ying Bing knew it hadn’t been long, yet she felt every second and minute was so long.

Just as she was about to get up wrapped in the Phoenix Radiance, she heard the sound of the window pane rattling; it was Li Mo returning.

“Did you buy it?”

“I had the shopkeeper help pick out some.”

“Let me see.”

“Here.”

Ying Bing had just taken the bag inside and hadn’t even opened it yet.

“There’s more. I didn’t know what style you liked, so I bought quite a few.”

Thus.

A few minutes later, Ying Bing looked at the bags piled up by the bathtub, her beautiful phoenix eyes blinking.

Alright.

He was just like this. Last time he went to the ready-made clothing store, he bought even more; he bought so much the two-hundred-plus-jin fat shopkeeper learned the Iron Leg Water Walk.

Thinking this, Ying Bing glanced past the screen and saw the young man’s shadow sitting properly upright at the table. Only then did she rise with a splashing sound and open a bag to take a look.

The material felt a bit familiar...

Ying Bing closed the bag, expressionlessly picked up another piece...

Second piece...

Third piece...

The bag was clenched in her hand.

“Li Mo, what you bought...”

Li Mo sat upright and unafraid of shadows: “Local Southern Frontier styles. The shopkeeper said to follow local customs, and upon hearing it, I thought it made some sense.”

“But... so many...”

“Her business might not be good recently. You know, I have a kind heart and can’t bear to see others frowning. She insisted on giving them, so I took them all.”

When Li Mo was talking nonsense, his tone was still so serious.

“.....”

Among these clothes, it was hard to find a few that weren’t ‘vulgar.’ They had a very high vulgarity content.

This is how a gentleman follows local customs.

“Wearing these is even worse than not wearing them.”

Ying Bing’s voice was ethereal and distant.

“Sister, wear?”

---

Little Li the gentleman spoke as if possessed by a ghost.

It was mainly because he remembered that last time he used this trick, the Ice Cube was willing to eat the food he fed.

Separated by the screen.

It was visible to the naked eye that the exquisite silhouette stiffened for an instant.

“.....”

A moment later.

The Cold Fairy emerged from her bath. She walked out from behind the screen, her black hair damp, with a few strands sticking to her pink-white neck. Her skin, which was originally like moonlight, now added a soft, moist luster. Her eyes were still so clear and cold.

But she had put on that feather-woven long skirt again.

“What are you thinking about?”

“There is a martial art that can see through illusions. So, if one’s gaze is sharp to a certain extent, is it possible to see through...”

Li Mo was thinking about the matter of the Fiery Golden Eyes.

If he upgraded the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao," would this also be a divine ability?

“Want to know?”

She looked at the young man with a face full of righteous aura but hiding some guilt, and slightly narrowed her beautiful eyes.

“!”

Little Li the gentleman’s body trembled.

Just now when buying clothes, the hardest part of his entire body was his mouth. Now,恐怕 soon it won’t be.

This sudden question had killing power no less than the classic quote:

‘I bought a very sexy swimsuit.’

The youngest among the top ten on the Hidden Dragon List. From her title alone, one could tell how cold and unreachable she was, like the moonlight—looking high, cold, and sacred, but impossible to touch if one reached out.

Now she had just come out of the bath.

The clothes she wore inside were still the ones he had just picked out. Her eyes were ethereal and distant as she walked closer.

She whispered in the young man’s ear:

“I’m not telling you.”

“????”

Little Li the gentleman never expected that the Ice Cube might actually be getting a bit naughty!

The naughty Ice Cube was doing it on purpose!

Little Li, who followed local customs, reaped what he sowed. He could only quickly bend his waist to take a bath. After testing the water temperature, he buried himself in the tub and finally let out a long breath.

“This water is a bit cold now. Don’t you change...”

“I can just use my true energy to heat it. Wasting is shameful.”

“.....”

Ying Bing sat by the head of the bed, listening to the splashing water from inside, a bit dazed.

Only after the fact did she realize what she had just done?

She glanced lightly inside her collar. Her slender fingers curled up, and a radiance appeared. She quietly changed into something else.

“Might as well throw it away...”

Muttering to herself, she threw the clothes she had taken off into the basket.

No.

When they practiced dual cultivation, their minds were connected. Even if she didn’t say it...

Not long after.

Li Mo walked out from behind the screen while drying the water on his body with his energy. He saw the Ice Cube already sitting there, communicating with the Jade Phoenix God.

The Ice Cube has already started practicing? He wanted to ask indirectly.

He had already perfected his Seventy-Two Transformations, so there was no need to communicate with the Jade Phoenix God. Tonight, he planned to deduce the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao."

Li Mo was just about to go out to get some fresh air when he opened the door, but he heard her voice again.

“Li Mo.”

“Hmm?”

“I have some clothes that aren’t dry.”

Their clothes never needed to be dried.

The Little Li Brand Dryer, those who have used it all say it’s good.

Li Mo nodded, picked up the basket of clothes, intending to dry them with his energy while getting some fresh air. But he found that the clothes inside looked a bit familiar.

It was that pearl-white lotus-fiber intimate garment, the most expensive one he bought.

Huh? Something’s wrong.

Didn’t he just buy it?

He looked back in confusion, but the door slammed shut with a *bang*.

Did he teleport it?

Little Li the gentleman picked it up.

“.....”

“Hiss...”
