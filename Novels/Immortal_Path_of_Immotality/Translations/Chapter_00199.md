# Chapter 197: Unwarranted Disaster

In the western district of Wangyue City, within a secret chamber, Lin Shan had broken through to the late Foundation Establishment stage five years prior. The enhanced Purple Dust Pill, refined from the Purple Heart Pill, proved to be a top-tier treasure pill—another flawless product from the Enhancement Panel that allowed him to smoothly overcome the bottleneck once more.

This heaven-defying pill, which increased the breakthrough success rate to ninety percent, was something even the most renowned alchemy masters in the cultivation world couldn't fathom. Only the unreasonable Enhancement Panel could produce such a thing.

Truly one of a kind in the entire world!

This breakthrough didn't provide as much progress as the last one. Previously, he had advanced to one-third of the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, but this time, after compression and refinement, he only reached about one-fifth of the late stage. After five years of frenzied pill-assisted cultivation, he had progressed to two-fifths—and this was with his spiritual root aptitude now at "Grade B."

With pills, aptitude, and spiritual treasures all working in tandem, his cultivation speed far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators.

"With ample Foundation Establishment stage pills and the assistance of the innate spiritual treasure, the Void Star Plate, I should reach the late-stage Great Perfection in less than twenty years," Lin Shan calculated. At fifty years old now, it seemed he might miss the chance to rejuvenate at sixty-four.

"What a pity..."

If he could reach late-stage Great Perfection before sixty-four and quickly break through to the Golden Core stage, he would theoretically revert from youth back to adolescence. He had seen many Golden Core cultivators in the Great Song Dynasty and the Eastern Sea, both demonic and orthodox, yet none had the appearance of a teenager! Even Lei Yuzi of the Purple Heaven Sect, hailed as a "Nascent Soul Seed," had only reached Golden Core as a young woman.

This illustrated the prestige of a "teenage" Golden Core cultivator—even if it only lasted a year or two, it would be a remarkable achievement.

Every cultivator faced three major bottlenecks between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core. A single failure meant starting over, no matter how high one's aptitude was—who could predict luck? Most sect prodigies were advised by their elders to travel and broaden their horizons for a decade or so before attempting breakthroughs, seeking that elusive "moment of enlightenment."

But Lin Shan was different. He was a cheat, needing no "tempering in the mortal world" or "searching for opportunities." With the Enhancement Panel, he could refine supreme-grade pills to break through effortlessly—something others could never replicate.

Yet even this couldn't make him a teenage Golden Core. He couldn't fathom how those legendary geniuses cultivated so rapidly.

Still, reaching Foundation Establishment Great Perfection was only a matter of time. Once there, he'd need to prepare auxiliary spiritual materials for the Golden Core breakthrough.

Unlike Foundation Establishment, reaching Golden Core required four simplified steps refined over millennia:  
1. **Spirit-Qi Fusion** (already achieved at Great Perfection),  
2. **Jade Liquid Refinement** (nourishing meridians with internal fluids),  
3. **Forging an Immaculate Body** (easily done with the Void Star Plate's stellar energy),  
4. **Condensing a Flawless Golden Core** (coalescing the three blossoms into an indestructible core).  

Steps one and three were manageable, but two and four required external aids. Without the right materials, failed attempts could damage his cultivation or even lead to qi deviation. Worse, each failure would make subsequent attempts harder.

Lin Shan checked his 74 units of Ancient Charm, unsure if it was enough for enhancement. Best to save it. Once a Golden Core cultivator—a high-tier existence—he could gather Ancient Charm more easily. With four hundred years of lifespan, he could establish a sect, discreetly sending disciples to scavenge mortal world artifacts and faith. Alternatively, he could roam and harvest cults—options aplenty.

But first, he needed to reach Golden Core. At Foundation Establishment, large-scale operations would draw attention from regional cultivation clans. As a Golden Core cultivator, they'd likely turn a blind eye.

In the cultivation world, strength ruled supreme. For now, he'd keep a low profile.

Opening the chamber door, Lin Shan found the courtyard blanketed in fallen leaves. He hadn't planned to venture out—just to instruct the Black Skeleton Demon to scout Golden Core breakthrough materials before returning to seclusion. Over the years, he hadn't been completely isolated, summoning the mermaid monthly to trade seafood spiritual goods. Though unaware of external affairs, they likely didn't concern him.

Soon, the Black Skeleton Demon returned—empty-handed, unlike previous years with tens of thousands of spirit stones in profits.

"Bad harvest this year? Natural disaster or man-made?" Lin Shan sipped spiritual tea, indifferent to the loss but curious about external events.

The demon nodded gravely. "Both. I suggest we flee."

Lin Shan spat out his tea. "Flee? Again? I've been holed up peacefully—who did I offend this time?"

The demon sighed, feeling cursed by Lin Shan's perpetual misfortune. "The Star-Swallowing Mountain Range's beast tides disrupted seafood imports—natural disaster. But our Lin Trading House monopolized the gap, drawing envy—man-made."

"Who's targeting us?"

"The Dai Clan—a mining giant with five Golden Core cultivators. One is stationed in Wangyue City."

Lin Shan cut in, "When do we leave?"

The demon paused. "Aren't you curious about the details?"

"No. I just want to cultivate elsewhere."

"Impossible now. The Dai Clan won't let you."

Lin Shan shrugged. "Then sell the trading house. No big deal."

The demon shook its head. "Too late. They want our 'seafood supply channel'—the real golden goose. Without it, the trading house is worthless to them."

Lin Shan scoffed. The "channel" was just his summoning contract with the mermaid—impossible to hand over, especially with the teleportation stone embedded in the summoning flag. He'd even reserved it to potentially summon the Yellow Sage in emergencies.

The demon relayed the Dai Clan's ultimatum: sell both the trading house and the channel for 150,000 spirit stones within a month.

Lin Shan laughed coldly. He'd invested over 150,000 initially, and the business had quadrupled. The offer was outright robbery. Worse, the channel wasn't negotiable.

"And if I refuse?"

The demon recited the Dai Clan's message verbatim:  
*"Can an ant shake a tree? A mantis block a chariot?*  
*One misstep stains a lifetime—regret eternal.*  
*Do not say you were not warned."*

Lin Shan kicked over a stone table in fury. "Bullshit! If pushed, I'll fight to the death!"

The demon continued: *"The fish will die; the net may not."*

Lin Shan choked. "Fine! I'll flee and make them pay later!"

The demon: *"Justice's net is vast—none escape."*

Stunned, Lin Shan realized the Dai Clan had anticipated every response. How had he provoked such an enemy while minding his own business?

A true unwarranted disaster.
