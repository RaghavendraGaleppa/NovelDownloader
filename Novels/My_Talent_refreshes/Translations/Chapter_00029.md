# Chapter 29: This Is What Cultivators Eat

After joining the sect, Chu Ning quickly noticed that everyone was preoccupied with cultivation and farming. 

With limited information and resources available to low-level disciples, there wasn't much for them to discuss among themselves. While they weren't exactly solitary, it was rare to see groups gathering together. So when a crowd suddenly appeared in the spirit fields, it caught Chu Ning's attention.

To his surprise, he recognized them all—they were fellow disciples from the Spiritual Plantation Division who had passed the assessment with him a few months earlier. Leading the group was Yuan Guang, who like him had been assigned premium-grade spirit fields. Following behind were Chen Youdao, Zhang Hui, and others, including Qiu Shunyi and Lü Xingyuan, who had accompanied him to the market before.

As Chu Ning spotted them, they noticed him too, their expressions turning lively.

"Ah, isn't that Senior Brother Chu?" Chen Youdao, who was closest to Yuan Guang, spoke first. "We were just going to see Senior Brother Yuan's Purple Spirit Potatoes. Since your Dark Spirit Bamboo should be mature by now, why don't you show it to us?"

His words prompted immediate agreement from the others.

"Yes, Senior Brother Chu! We've never seen mature Dark Spirit Bamboo before."

"I heard it can be used to make talisman paper—I'm really curious what it looks like."

Their eager voices carried obvious schadenfreude. 

Yuan Guang wore a smug expression, while Qiu Shunyi's face darkened slightly. Just as Qiu was about to speak up, Chu Ning waved his hand dismissively.

"My Dark Spirit Bamboo isn't worth seeing—its growth has been mediocre, not ready for harvest yet."

Their expressions grew even more animated at this. Chen Youdao piped up again, "What a shame, Senior Brother Chu. Senior Brother Yuan's Purple Spirit Potatoes are thriving. Even Senior Brother Zhuang Yunde praised them as exceeding the sect's standards. If you'd planted those too, with your equal cultivation level, you might have achieved similar results."

Chu Ning inwardly shook his head at the sycophantic display but remained silent. 

Yuan Guang, seeing Chu Ning's reaction, felt immensely gratified. During their assessment, Chu Ning had chosen the higher-grade Dark Spirit Bamboo over his Purple Spirit Potatoes, and now he finally had the upper hand.

"Why don't you join us, Junior Brother Chu?" Yuan Guang offered magnanimously, though the condescension in his address was unmistakable. "You could give us some pointers."

But Chu Ning had long since stopped seeing Yuan Guang as competition—their pursuits were on entirely different levels now.

With a light chuckle, Chu Ning shook his head. "No need. I have other matters to attend to."

He walked past them without another glance. 

None had genuinely wanted him along anyway, assuming his refusal stemmed from embarrassment over his poor bamboo yield. They continued toward the premium fields without another word, except for Qiu Shunyi, who lingered behind.

"Chu Ning," Qiu said awkwardly, "Xingyuan invited me to go. I thought you might not want to join, so I didn't ask you."

Chu Ning smiled and patted his shoulder. "It's fine. Go ahead—it'll be good experience. You've reached Qi Refinement Level 2; you might be planting those potatoes yourself soon."

As Chu Ning departed, Qiu watched him go, puzzled. Chu Ning didn't seem embarrassed at all—if anything, he appeared to look down on the Purple Spirit Potatoes.

But Chu Ning's mind was already elsewhere, focused on reaching his medium-grade spirit fields where his spirit rice awaited harvest—his first successful crop since entering the cultivation world.

Approaching the fields, he spotted a familiar figure—his neighbor, Senior Brother Qi Chongmao, standing by his plot.

"Senior Brother Qi," Chu Ning greeted the man, whose rolled-up pant legs gave him the appearance of a simple farmer.

Qi turned with a smile. "Junior Brother Chu, your rice looks excellent. Your spellwork must be coming along well."

"You flatter me," Chu Ning demurred. "I've just been diligent with maintenance."

"That you have," Qi agreed. "Though I've noticed you've been visiting less lately. I've chased away some pests for you a few times."

Chu Ning blinked in surprise before expressing sincere thanks. His recent absences were due to focusing on the Seven Star Spirit Fruit in his courtyard.

After exchanging pleasantries, Qi waded barefoot into his own field to begin harvesting—eschewing the convenience of Blade Wind spells for manual labor.

"Truly like the farmers back on Earth—honest and kindhearted," Chu Ning mused before turning to his own plot.

Unlike the Red Spirit Rice he'd grown for Cao Dongxin, this crop was more abundant and plump, its quality superior thanks to the richer spiritual energy of the medium-grade fields and Chu Ning's enhanced Evergreen Spring spells.

Surveying the thriving stalks, Chu Ning smiled. Unlike the barely edible Red Spirit Rice, this variety was genuine cultivator's fare—something he'd rarely tasted. After meeting the sect's quota, he'd have enough left for months of meals.

With Blade Wind spells, he swiftly cut swathes of rice, using Telekinesis to gather them. Though his metal-element spells weren't as proficient as his wood techniques, his Qi Refinement Level 4 cultivation ensured efficient harvesting.

Within two days (while maintaining his training regimen), all five acres were cleared. He incinerated the stubble with fireballs to fertilize the field, then carried the grain back to dry.

A few Drying Spells eliminated moisture, followed by Cleaning Spells to remove husks. Soon, his room brimmed with glistening spirit rice.

At midday, Chu Ning cooked his first pot. The steaming, snow-white grains exuded a faint spiritual aura that set his mouth watering. 

He ate it plain, without accompaniments. The moment the rice touched his tongue, an exquisite fragrance blossomed in his mouth.

"So delicious! This is real cultivator food!" He devoured two bowls ravenously.

As the meal settled, wisps of spiritual energy diffused through his body. Seizing the moment, he began meditating.

After completing a major energy cycle, he checked his progress:

[Evergreen Wood Scripture (Yellow Low Grade), Layer 2 (179/900)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering, Volume 1, Immortal Skin 103/300]

"Post-meal cultivation is definitely more effective than normal," he observed, "though still inferior to Evergreen Spring's enhancement."

Calculating, he estimated six spirit rice meals over two days might equal one Evergreen Spring-assisted session. Still, he resolved to make it his staple—both for the slight cultivation boost and, more importantly, the exquisite taste.

As he pondered this, a voice called from outside: "Chu Ning!"

Recognizing Zhuang Yunde's voice, he hurried out to meet him.
