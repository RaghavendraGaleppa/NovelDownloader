Chapter 204: A Desperate Exit, a Deeper Cocoon

Li Xian knew that the Madam was in seclusion and unable to move, let alone receive guests. However, what Li Bohou had said was of great importance, relating to the Dragon Appreciation Banquet.

After some thought, he decided to keep the two of them there first and wait for the Madam to make the final decision.

He said, "The Madam is currently in seclusion and likely won't emerge easily within the next few days. Since you two have come from afar, why not stay at the manor for now? Within three days at the latest, you will certainly be able to see the Madam. The Unity Harmony Manor is vast and has beautiful scenery. If you two are willing to appreciate it, I can accompany you the entire time."

Li Bohou saw that the wind and snow were howling outside and it was bitterly cold. It would be inappropriate if he couldn't deliver his message in person, so he figured waiting a few days would be fine. He said, "Please convey our message first. If the Madam is unwilling to leave seclusion immediately, my daughter and I will stay at the manor for a couple of days."

"Hmph." Li Haitang was clearly displeased. After Li Xian left, she said to Li Bohou, "This Folding Sword Madam puts on quite the airs. Last time we came, she made us wait a whole night. Now that Father has come personally, she's still acting this way."

"We're doing this for her own good; she's being ungrateful."

"Haitang," Li Bohou warned, "watch your words. Walking the Jianghu, one must be cautious in speech and action. If you continue like this, you'll suffer for it sooner or later."

The two sat quietly in the welcoming hall. Li Haitang felt extremely bored, looking around aimlessly. Li Bohou, however, had a calm heart. The matter was urgent, but not so urgent that it couldn't wait a day or two.

After sitting for the time it takes half an incense stick to burn, he got up to stretch. Out of the corner of his eye, he was suddenly attracted by the hall's decor. He moved closer to inspect it, and his boredom vanished instantly.

"These carvings are quite rare," Li Bohou murmured as he gently stroked a piece of porcelain. "Tsk, tsk, tsk. Such an ancient piece. A phoenix spreading its wings, golden rain falling from the sky. This is a noble pattern from the Yu Dynasty."

His knowledge was profound. His gaze shifted elsewhere. He walked over to a potted landscape and clicked his tongue in amazement. "The Blessing Pine. This pine tree has a jade-like luster, its shape resembling a child's hands in a respectful greeting. A tree like this must have cost a fortune."

Li Haitang said, "Father, it's just a tree."

Li Bohou shook his head and patiently taught, "You... how many times must I teach you? A martial artist's vision, knowledge, and ability to appreciate things are also extremely important."

"You must be able to appreciate objects to be able to appreciate people and events."

"This is indeed just a tree. But look at the pine needles, their tips are golden, not withered or dry. The tree's fragrance is subtle, and smelling it clears the mind and refreshes the soul. This tree was likely taken from a high altitude on [Su Mountain]."

"This kind of high-altitude pine cannot survive at lower elevations. Yet here it is, obediently growing in a bronze pot, serving as a decoration, a welcoming child."

"The methods, effort, and money required for this are considerable."

"A martial artist's strength and character can be glimpsed from the things they possess."

Li Haitang paid no attention and asked curiously, "Then, Father, tell me, what kind of person is this Folding Sword Madam?"

Li Bohou said, "Gossiping about others behind their backs is not polite." Li Haitang immediately fell silent. She wasn't afraid of her father's scolding, but she was afraid of the Folding Sword Madam.

This reminder prompted Li Bohou to observe his surroundings, secretly speculating about the Madam's temperament. Seeing the luxurious decor, he figured the Madam was of noble status. Yet, she also placed items like the welcoming pine and auspicious cloud incense burners... things with an artistic conception of deep mountains and solitary cultivators.

Complex and changeable, with no fixed nature.

Li Bohou sighed. "It seems this Folding Sword Madam is not so easy to understand." His interest was piqued. Holding his tea, he could spend a long time looking at a single piece of porcelain, a screen, or a painting.

Li Xian went straight up to the Serenity Pagoda. The dim red candlelight made the Madam look like a piece of fine, smooth red and white jade. She was making a slight struggle.

Li Xian said, "Madam, Li Bohou has come to see you. He says there are important matters to discuss."

Madam Wen exhaled a breath of turbid air, her beautiful face flushed. The Silkworm Clothes Jade Skill had reached the fifth layer. The circulation of her energy and the internal cultivation methods were now quite different. It was as complex as untangling a ball of yarn.

She was not yet accustomed to it, feeling her way like crossing a river by feeling the stones. She was completely absorbed and didn't even notice Li Xian entering the pagoda.

Madam Wen's forehead was beaded with fine sweat. She said, "Let him wait. Entertain him well."

Li Xian said, "He says it's related to the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, and also closely related to you, Madam."

"It's fine, let him wait," said Madam Wen. A drop of sweat fell, illuminated by the candlelight, making the silkworm clothes appear crystal clear.

Li Xian immediately relayed the message. Li Bohou said, "In that case, we shall stay for a few days." His temper was very good, showing understanding.

Li Xian inwardly admired him. "This Li Bohou is a person of great ability, with excellent cultivation and temper. Precisely because of this, his daughter is so spoiled."

He personally accompanied them and arranged for elegant residences for the two. Along the way, the flower gardens were gorgeous and the scenery serene. Green willows mingled with the cold wind, and lotuses were touched by frost and snow. The four seasons were mixed, creating a unique artistic conception.

Li Bohou toured the lake and admired the garden, exclaiming in praise, "Your Madam has excellent taste."

He could explain the underlying meanings and allusions behind the flowers, trees, and landscape designs in the garden... the many intricacies.

Li Xian was greatly impressed. He saw the manor's scenery every day but never knew how to appreciate it. At first glance, he thought it was beautiful and the arrangement had charm. Looking again, he still found it beautiful, but after looking again and again... he gradually became blind to it and found it boring.

Now, hearing the explanation, he understood the intricacies and felt completely refreshed. The mountains were no longer just mountains, the waters no longer just waters.

The scenery was the same, but the artistic conception was different.

So he actively asked for instruction.

Li Bohou was refined and elegant, with an easy-going personality, and was generous in teaching. As they walked along, he pointed and explained, and their interaction was very harmonious.

After touring the garden, Li Xian's knowledge had been greatly enriched, and he gained a lot.

When they arrived at the guest quarters, Li Bohou stopped and sighed, "If only my Haitang could be as eager to learn as you."

Li Haitang said, "Haitang is lively by nature. It's normal for her to not be interested in these scenic intricacies."

"From a small clue, one can see the whole picture," Li Bohou said, shaking his head. "Catching criminals in the Jianghu, solving cases and mysteries, requires a rich储备 of knowledge. Only then can one turn danger into safety."

"Brother Li, if you're interested, you can come find me again tomorrow. We've had a delightful conversation and are quite kindred spirits."

Li Xian said joyfully, "I would be delighted!"

The next day.

Li Xian paid a visit early in the morning. Outside the guest quarters, Li Haitang was practicing martial arts, holding a sword in one hand and a whip in the other, dressed in thin clothes.

When she saw Li Xian, she raised her eyebrows, wanting to show off. Her movements changed abruptly. She threw her sword upward, bent her leg back like a scorpion's tail, and kicked the sword towards Li Xian. Then she flicked her whip, which wrapped around the sword's hilt. Every time she flicked the whip, the sword's light flashed, as if she were controlling the sword from afar!

And as the sword's momentum ended, the whip's force followed immediately. It was continuous, combining hardness and softness, occasionally slashing out a few dazzling sword beams.

Li Xian, seeing Li Haitang's skills for the first time, secretly praised, "What a profound martial art! As expected of the Divine Constable's disciple, a master of both sword and whip! This is only our second meeting, but it's the first time I've seen her in action!"

After Li Haitang finished her dance, Li Xian applauded and laughed, "Excellent skills, magnificent bearing! Miss Haitang is amazing!"

Li Haitang's joy was undisguised. She said, "I'm going out to play. You happened to come, so keep me company."

"I'll pass," Li Xian said with a smile. "I'm here to see Senior Bohou."

"Hahaha," Li Bohou walked out of the guest quarters, stretching. "Brother Li, you're here, so early."

Li Xian said, "I was thinking about it all last night. The thought of being able to tour the garden with Senior Li and broaden my horizons had me excited all night."

Li Bohou laughed. "It's rare for you to be so enthusiastic."

He said to Haitang, "Haitang, you're not interested in these things. It goes in one ear and out the other. Brother Li is interested. You... go play by yourself."

Li Haitang stamped her foot in frustration. "I'm coming too! I want to see for myself what's so special about these rocks and flowers!"

And so she followed along.

"Hahaha, don't mind this girl," Li Bohou said, shaking his head with a smile, walking ahead with Li Xian.

The garden scenery varied greatly: forests of giant stones, pavilions for flowers and birds, rockeries... Li Xian led the way, and Li Bohou explained. Li Haitang followed behind, sullen.

After walking for half an hour, Li Xian felt he had benefited immensely.

Li Bohou sighed inwardly, "My dear daughter, if you don't work harder, your father's real skills will be learned by someone else."

When they reached the side of the "Frost Listening Pavilion," Li Haitang clamored to rest. The three of them sat down in the pavilion, where the scenery was expansive. There was a small hill behind and a lake in front. The frosty wind blew across the lake's surface.

As it blew into the pavilion, a faint musical sound could be heard.

"Father, how is there music here?" Li Haitang asked in surprise.

Li Bohou stood with his hands behind his back, pointing to the surrounding scenery. "The secret lies in the scenery. The flowers, grass, and trees around the pavilion are all arranged strictly. In the deep winter, frost crystals form between the trees and grass. When the frosty wind blows, it creates a faint, crisp sound. The combination of many scenery elements forms this frosty musical piece."

Li Xian asked, "Senior Li, could you tell me some of your stories about catching criminals and punishing evil? Your junior greatly admires you."

"Sure, sure," Li Bohou said. "You are the Qingning Martial Captain. According to the rules, you and I are considered colleagues..."

Li Haitang interjected, "Father, how can a mere Martial Captain compare to you?" She didn't have a bad impression of Li Xian, but defending her father was her top priority.

Li Xian said, "Miss Haitang is absolutely right." Li Haitang nodded in deep agreement, laughing, "You're quite sensible."

Li Bohou said, "Let's not talk about that. I know you've been stationed in Qingning and have made quite a few achievements. Before I even met you, I already admired you quite a bit."

"Today, touring the garden with you, I see you are not arrogant or impatient. Your temperament is much better than Haitang's. Since we're on the topic of catching thieves and criminals, I can casually teach you a few tricks for catching criminals. It wouldn't hurt."

Li Xian was startled. "I am honored by your high regard, Senior. But we've only just met, I wouldn't dare accept such a great gift."

"Hahaha," Li Bohou laughed heartily. "I'm not passing down a martial arts legacy. It's all based on experience. Learning it to catch criminals will be helpful."

He immediately gave a brief account. Li Xian listened silently, asking for clarification on any points he didn't understand.

Three days passed in this way.

The manor was too vast to fully explore.

At noon on this day, the Madam was about to emerge from seclusion.

In the welcoming hall, Li Xian arranged for Li Bohou and his daughter to sit, brewed the calming Dragon Tea, and performed all the proper etiquette. He said, "Senior Li Bohou, Miss Haitang, please wait a moment. I will go and ask if the Madam is willing to receive you."

Li Bohou took a small sip of his tea and waved his hand. "Go on." Li Haitang watched him leave.

Li Haitang's face was slightly flushed. "He's handsome, quite polite, and speaks respectfully. It's just that, like Father, he always likes those strange and unusual things."

"Good, good," Li Bohou said with a nod and a smile.

He then whispered with a soft sigh:

"If he were anywhere else, he would be a rising star. It's a pity that under Wen Caishang, he's like that welcoming pine, trapped in a bronze pot. But nothing is absolute, and life is unpredictable. Perhaps he can break free of his shackles?"

Inside the Serenity Pagoda.

Li Xian helped the Madam take off the silkworm clothes. The sweat had soaked them, and the silkworm ropes were fine and tough. Once wet, they became extremely slippery. It took quite a bit of effort to remove them all.

Madam Wen asked, "Is Li Bohou still at the manor?"

"Yes," Li Xian said. "Senior Li has a humble and gentle temperament. We've had a very pleasant conversation."

"Very well, take me to see him," said Madam Wen, draping a white robe over her shoulders.
