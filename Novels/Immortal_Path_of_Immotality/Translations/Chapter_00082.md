# Chapter 82: The Fragrant Beauty Perishes  

Lin Shan's Cold Iron Sword was inscribed with three runes—Sharpness, Tenacity, and Freezing—making it a genuine offensive magical weapon. The brocade-clad middle-aged man's talisman sword, on the other hand, was enhanced with Swiftness and Spell-Breaking runes, clearly designed for agility and ambush tactics.  

However, Lin Shan was protected by high-grade magical artifacts, rendering sneak attacks impossible. As for clashing head-on with the Cold Iron Sword? That was nothing short of suicide!  

Looking at the half-shattered notch on his sword, the brocade-clad man felt his heart bleed. Meanwhile, Lin Shan continued his relentless assault, giving the four no chance to catch their breath.  

Ambush me? Fine! Today, I'll show you what it means to "never judge a person by their past"!  

As ice-blue sword beams slashed through the air one after another, their defensive barriers shattered like fragile shells. In just a few breaths, the four had already burned through four or five talismans, the ground littered with shattered ice and earth.  

"My Soul-Startling Bell has no effect on him anymore! What do we do?" Princess Guo's panicked voice rang out. The others were too busy desperately blocking Lin Shan's sword strikes with spells and artifacts to answer her.  

After more than twenty consecutive strikes, the four were exhausted, their defenses completely dismantled.  

"Let's settle this today!"  

Lin Shan, clad in pristine white robes, strode forward with the bearing of a dragon or tiger, his aura majestic and imposing.  

This was the same riverside where Princess Guo and her group had ambushed him and Immortal Huang, forcing them to flee. Now, the tables had turned.  

As the young man advanced with his sword, unstoppable and decisive, the old woman among the four trembled like a leaf, too terrified to move. All her magical artifacts and talismans had been destroyed, her defenses as flimsy as paper against the razor-sharp sword beams.  

"Save me!"  

The next moment, her head flew from her shoulders, blood spraying into the air.  

The remaining three were instantly drenched in blood, their souls nearly fleeing their bodies in terror. As Lin Shan raised his sword again, the brocade-clad man finally lost all courage and shouted, "Run!"  

The three turned and fled, wishing they had extra legs.  

In the face of disaster, each thought only of survival. Any thoughts of ambush were long forgotten—they just wanted to escape this demon and hide in the capital, Bianliang.  

If they could return to Bianliang, the imperial family would be their shield. Even with his late-stage Qi Refining cultivation, Lin Shan wouldn't dare slaughter openly in the capital, lest he become an enemy of the state.  

But Lin Shan had no intention of letting them escape. Since they had dared to ambush him, they were now mortal enemies—and mortal enemies must be eradicated root and branch!  

"Trying to run? Did I say you could?"  

Lin Shan sneered, activating his Wind Riding Technique and giving chase. With his left hand outstretched, he made a grasping motion.  

"Wind Binding Art!"  

Eight towering wind pillars erupted around one of the fleeing elders, trapping him completely.  

"No!"  

A sword beam flashed, and the man followed his companion into death.  

Lin Shan then turned his gaze to the brocade-clad man. Channeling wind energy from his dantian, he unleashed another Wind Binding Art.  

As the wind pillars encircled his target, a blue sword beam shot forth. In desperation, the brocade-clad man used his talisman sword to block. Though the Spell-Breaking effect didn't dispel the sword beam, a few additional spells managed to hold it off.  

Lin Shan wasn't surprised. He relentlessly pursued the man, hacking away with his sword.  

With his superior cultivation, greater spiritual power, faster speed, and better weapon, there was no way the man could escape!  

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"  

The crisp sound of clashing metal rang out as Lin Shan forced close-quarters combat. After five or six strikes, the talisman sword trembled and snapped in two, falling to the ground. The sword talisman in the brocade-clad man's hand spontaneously combusted, turning to ash.  

This mid-grade talisman sword, worth 500 spirit stones in the Yichuan market—a treasure passed down through generations of his family—had been destroyed in moments.  

"Brother Lin, don't be rash! This is all a misunderstanding—"  

Now defenseless and facing death, the brocade-clad man abandoned his usual composure and begged for mercy.  

Lin Shan, calm and unhurried, had no intention of listening. He raised his sword for the killing blow.  

But just then, a sharp whistle pierced the air.  

"Screech!"  

A blue figure flashed through the trees ahead.  

Before Lin Shan could react, a tremendous force struck him from the side, sending him flying several meters.  

A shadow closed in, and a barrage of muffled impacts landed on him.  

"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"  

"Pop!"  

The water-screen barrier around Lin Shan shattered into motes of light, the talisman in his pocket burning away.  

Before him stood a young woman in purple robes, her demeanor noble and unapproachable. Yet dark energy roiled around her, and her pale hands radiated inky power.  

"Princess of Great Yan!"  

Lin Shan's expression shifted slightly. He remembered her from the Yichuan auction, where she'd been sold as a slave. Rumor had it she'd been purchased by a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Song Dynasty. Why was she here?  

Glancing back, he saw the brocade-clad man and Princess Guo disappearing into the forest.  

Lin Shan knew he'd have to deal with the princess before giving chase. But as a fellow late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, he wasn't intimidated. If not for the sneak attack, the brocade-clad man would already be dead.  

"Are you the only one who came?"  

Lin Shan rose slowly, scanning the surroundings. He didn't know if other Song Dynasty cultivators were nearby or how far the Foundation Establishment expert was. He weighed whether to fight or flee.  

The princess answered coldly, "No need to look around. The Song Dynasty's old Foundation Establishment bastard is visiting the Murong family. I'm the only one here—left behind to delay you."  

Lin Shan was surprised by her tone. "Weren't you enslaved with restrictive spells and control artifacts? I heard such methods suppress speech and action. How can you freely reveal your master's whereabouts?"  

The princess snorted. "Those high-level techniques are too precious to waste on a Qi Refining cultivator. My life is controlled, but I'm not a puppet. Is it strange I still have my own thoughts?  

"Today, either you kill me, or I kill you. Let's go!"  

She charged at Lin Shan bare-handed, her expression one of resigned determination.  

Lin Shan remained silent. If he were enslaved, his will broken, he'd likely prefer death too. But right now, the princess seemed to have only her cultivation—no artifacts or talismans.  

The two engaged in close combat. Though Lin Shan had some martial arts training, he was no match for the princess, whose movements were fluid and precise, like a seasoned master.  

Despite lacking weapons, her dark energy and formidable skills kept Lin Shan on the defensive.  

But as time passed, the tide turned. Lin Shan's Cloud-Copper Heart Mirror automatically defended against physical attacks, mitigating most damage. He could afford mistakes; the princess could not.  

After half an hour, Lin Shan seized an opening. Using Wind Binding Art to immobilize her, he severed one of her arms.  

Then, trading injury for injury, he plunged his sword into her chest.  

Time seemed to freeze as the river's gentle flow mingled with spreading crimson.  

"Gurgle..."  

Blood bubbled from the princess's lips as she smiled faintly, her eyes filled with gratitude, longing, and sorrow. Then she collapsed.  

"Thud."  

Lin Shan withdrew his sword, letting her body fall.  

Gazing at the tragic beauty before him, he felt a pang of sorrow. A princess, reduced to a slave, dying so pitifully in the wilderness.  

Had she been armed, the fight would have been far harder.  

So young, yet already a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator and martial arts master—the Great Yan royal family must have invested heavily in her. And now she died here, forgotten.  

But Lin Shan's heart was iron. Shaking off the melancholy, he prepared to pursue Princess Guo and the brocade-clad man. As a wind-aligned cultivator, his speed should still allow him to catch them.  

One last glance at the princess, and he turned to leave.  

Then, slow, deliberate clapping broke the silence. Someone had been watching.  

"Clap. Clap. Clap.  

"Quite ruthless, aren't you? Such a lovely beauty, slain without hesitation..."  

"Who's there? Show yourself!"  

Lin Shan whirled around, his gaze sharp as a blade. After today's battles, his confidence was at its peak, his killing intent palpable.  

He was ready to see who else dared challenge him.  

"Very well. Remember me?"  

A figure in yellow robes and a red kasaya stepped forward, holding a staff in one hand and prayer beads in the other.  

It was the red-faced monk who'd competed with him for the Joyful Buddha statue at the auction!
