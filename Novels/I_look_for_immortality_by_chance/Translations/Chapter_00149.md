# Chapter 149: A Strange Land, A Demon Core!

"Darling?"

"My love?"

The seductive, velvety voice was intoxicating, yet Gu Yuan grew increasingly alert. His dantian stirred with surging spiritual energy as brilliant talismanic seals shimmered, ready to be unleashed at any moment.

Just then, Gu Yuan noticed something odd about his wrist. Looking down, he saw a silver ring had somehow appeared there. Intricate runes glowed upon it, releasing a peculiar energy that surged into his dantian like a massive lock, sealing away his emerald-green Dao Foundation.

Seeing this, Gu Yuan immediately withdrew his spiritual energy, suppressing his aura until he seemed like an ordinary mortal.

"Don't be afraid, my love. It's just a Dao-Sealing Ring. If you agree to dual cultivation with me, I'll remove it immediately. Then we can live happily together as immortals, wouldn't that be wonderful?" The beautiful woman reassured him with a gentle smile, her voice tender.

"Dual cultivation? More like draining my yang to nourish your yin," Gu Yuan thought bitterly, though he remained silent.

Despite his damaged spiritual sense, his foundation remained intact. With the Three-Eyed Thunder Dragon's ability to see through illusions and the Zhaotian Spirit Eyes, a single glance was enough to discern her true nature. 

Though her aura was deep—approaching mid-stage Foundation Establishment—there was a hint of instability. Her peach-blossom complexion and spring-water eyes, coupled with her habit of calling every man "darling," made her cultivation method obvious without needing to ask.

Yet Gu Yuan didn't immediately confront her. Instead, he asked, "Where is this place?"

"Don't worry, my love. This is the Myriad Isles Sea in the Western Ocean Domain. Surrounded by thunderstorms, no enemies can reach you here. If you agree to dual cultivation with me, this Suyin Isle will be your home from now on. With its top-tier second-grade spiritual vein, it’s more than enough for us to cultivate peacefully until late-stage Foundation Establishment." 

The woman giggled behind her sleeve, eagerly explaining while still pressing for dual cultivation. Her lustrous eyes never left Gu Yuan’s handsome face, as if deeply enamored.

"Western Ocean Domain?" 

Gu Yuan’s heart sank at the revelation. But before he could dwell on it, a deafening explosion erupted outside, followed by raucous laughter.

"Boom!"

"My two lovely ladies, Huang is back! Come out and greet me, hahaha!" 

A gust of wind howled as a massive, golden shadow blotted out the sky, enveloping the entire island.

"Damn it, he's back again!"

"That toad dares to dream of swan meat!"

The beautiful woman’s expression darkened with anger. After cursing under her breath, she turned back to Gu Yuan with a soft smile. 

"Rest well, my love. Once I deal with that toad demon, I’ll return to enjoy your company." 

With that, she transformed into a streak of light and shot toward the island’s edge, though not before sealing the chamber with a barrier.

Meanwhile, several Foundation Establishment auras flared across the island, led by a mid-stage cultivator—a graceful figure with a profound and radiant presence. 

The atmosphere turned tense and frigid.

---

Inside the chamber, silence reigned.

Gu Yuan glanced at the Dao-Sealing Ring on his wrist. With a flick of his hand, a brilliant sword light flashed, slicing it apart effortlessly. 

This ring functioned similarly to the snake-tailed youth’s Dao-Locking Seal, though the latter was far more sophisticated—able to forcibly seal a cultivator’s Dao Foundation and suppress their spiritual energy. The Dao-Sealing Ring, however, only worked if the target was already subdued, serving as a restraint.

But to Gu Yuan, neither posed a threat. 

The Three Laws Celestial Diagram was an extraordinary technique, allowing him to cultivate three Dao Foundations simultaneously. Unless all three were sealed at once, he remained a formidable Foundation Establishment cultivator. 

Yet the diagram concealed itself unless scrutinized by someone far beyond his realm. Most would only notice his unusually vast spiritual energy, never suspecting his triple foundation. 

Had he not wished to keep this as a hidden trump card, he would have severed the ring and slain the woman the moment she embraced him.

But with the situation outside escalating, Gu Yuan could no longer delay. He needed to recover his strength swiftly.

"At least she didn’t take my storage pouch…" 

Gu Yuan sighed in relief, patting the pouch at his waist. Unless someone broke his spiritual imprint, they couldn’t open it—though they could still steal and hide it elsewhere. 

Strangely, the woman had left all his belongings untouched, perhaps genuinely hoping he’d become her cultivation partner. 

Had their roles been reversed, Gu Yuan mused, she’d have been left with nothing but the clothes on her back.

---

With a flash of light, a jade-green fruit materialized in Gu Yuan’s palm, exuding a faint fragrance. 

"I never thought I’d need this so soon. Life is truly unpredictable…" 

This was the Heart-Cleansing Fruit, painstakingly nurtured by the old turtle. Initially unripe, Gu Yuan had left it until his return to Tianlang Isle, where he harvested it while refining the Biyou Sky-Soaring Seal.

The fruit had one singular purpose—restoring injuries and repairing foundations. 

Gu Yuan didn’t know how he’d ended up in the distant Western Ocean Domain, but surviving the spatial fractures and chaotic currents had left his mind and sea of consciousness severely damaged, drastically weakening him. 

Fortunately, this fruit remained.

With a single bite, the fruit dissolved into emerald liquid, flooding his body. A surge of revitalizing energy coursed through him, mending his injuries and soothing his battered sea of consciousness. 

Soon, the pain faded. His Three-Eyed Thunder Dragon, once ragged, now gleamed silver once more, brimming with vigor. 

With his spiritual sense restored, Gu Yuan immediately extended it across the island. 

The vast isle was dotted with opulent palaces, many exuding an aura of debauchery. But Gu Yuan’s focus quickly shifted to the battle raging above.

Eight figures clashed fiercely—spells erupted, spiritual energy roared, and the fight grew increasingly intense. 

On one side were alluring women, their beauty enchanting, their movements graceful. 

Opposing them were four earth demons, their monstrous auras billowing. The leader, a golden toad, had reached mid-stage earth demon realm. Yet the beautiful woman facing him, also at mid-stage Foundation Establishment, wielded formidable spiritual artifacts, suppressing the toad. 

The other women also summoned their artifacts, turning the tide as the demons were forced back. 

But then, the toad grinned savagely and shouted, "Brother Bai, now!" 

Before his voice faded, a smooth, azure orb shot into the sky. 

Crackling blue lightning erupted from it, striking the women’s spiritual artifacts. 

The artifacts trembled, their connection to their wielders severed, hovering uselessly in midair. 

"Kill!" 

The demons surged forward with renewed ferocity. 

"Ah!" 

The youngest of the women—a girl in colorful robes, her cultivation unstable and barely at Foundation Establishment—had relied entirely on her artifact. Now defenseless, she was impaled through the abdomen by razor-sharp claws. 

Her scream echoed as she plummeted from the sky. 

With one ally lost and reinforcements arriving for the enemy, the women’s situation grew dire. 

Gu Yuan’s gaze, however, was fixed on the azure orb. 

A demon core!
