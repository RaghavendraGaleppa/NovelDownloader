Chapter 348: The Beast Hall's Probe! The Ice Cube's Birthday

Three days later, after the snow had fallen, the southern疆 lands were continuously sunny.

The three suns seemed like the eyes of the heavens, silently watching the vast earth as they opened.

In many villages and towns of the southern疆, beliefs had quietly changed, and they all worshipped the same existence—the Heavenly尊 (Heavenly Lord).

"The Heavenly尊 Immortal made us offer him stones and taught us the Mountain Splitting Hammer Technique and the second set of Broadcast Calisthenics."

"You guys offer stones? Our town often has floods, so the Heavenly尊 Immortal made us dig river channels and offer him mud and sand..."

"The disciples by the Immortal's side are all strangely shaped, it's quite scary. Is it because they practiced the Broadcast Calisthenics?"

"That can't be. The Immortal said that all disciples of the Myriad Forms Immortal Sect are skilled in pictographic martial arts..."

"After doing the Broadcast Calisthenics for a few days, my back doesn't hurt anymore, and my legs aren't sore either."

"The Heavenly尊 Immortal really helps with our troubles. Believing in him is truly effective. And he doesn't even ask for virgin boys and girls!"

"Really? My child is just six. I might as well move my whole family to your town."

...

Summon Demon Sect, Southern Branch Altar.

The ancient and crude main hall was pitch black, as if even the sunlight outside couldn't penetrate it. The faint light made the murals on the walls, exuding a primitive atmosphere, appear especially eerie.

Roars and howls faintly came to the ear, sounds not humanly possible.

"Lately, our sect's disciples have suffered heavy casualties. What are your views on this?"

The Master of the Beast Hall sat high in the main seat, his voice hoarse, like a lifeless dead tree.

The Summon Demon Sect had always cooperated with Han Zhen, and the Beast Hall was born from this.

Now Han Zhen was dead.

The ultimate goal of the Beast Hall had not changed, only two words: True Dragon.

To summon the True Dragon into the world.

The True Dragon was not a先天 (innate) living creature, but rather a product formed from powerful beings worshipped as totems by humanity. During the process of tribes devouring each other, these totems fused together, ultimately giving birth to the True Dragon.

When the power of the myriad beings was sufficient, it would be born according to the circumstances.

So even if Han Zhen died, the Beast Hall wasn't much different from before; it was still about controlling the southern疆 and gathering the power of the myriad beings.

But now, someone has shaken the foundation of the Beast Hall.

"......"

The High Priests present didn't speak first.

Please, they were members of the demon sect.

Some of them usually fought internally in the dark. If something happened in someone else's jurisdiction, what did it have to do with them?

Others were still unclear about the situation. They knew that speaking too much would lead to mistakes, so they didn't dare to speak.

The Hall Master let out a cold snort:

"You all know that the圣子 (Holy Son) has been in a bad mood lately. He has always wanted the True Dragon's body to return to the top of the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List)."

"If he finds out we failed to handle our affairs, the one who will suffer misfortune恐怕 (恐怕) is..."

The High Priests swallowed and sat up straight.

The Hall Master was the Holy Son's brother-in-law.

After whispering among themselves for a while, a priest spoke:

"Hall Master, our top priority now is to find out the origins of this Heavenly Court Myriad Forms Immortal Sect, especially that so-called Heavenly尊."

"Heavenly Court? Myriad Forms Immortal Sect? Heavenly尊?"

"Yes, he calls himself the Heavenly尊 Immortal. He has been dormant for countless years and possesses immense divine power..."

"Whew! Creating the world? Even in fiction novels, I wouldn't dare to boast like that..."

All the High Priests present were at least at the Inner Scene realm.

But even those at the Outer Scene realm wouldn't dare to speculate on the unfathomable nature of world creation.

If this were true.

Forget about a single branch hall of their Summon Demon Sect, even if the Sect Master from the main altar came, he would probably have to be cautious.

"There's another point."

The Beast Hall Master's expression grew even more serious:

"This Heavenly尊 said that our Summon Demon Sect only obtained a mere fraction of the Myriad Forms Immortal Sect."

"That can't be true, right?"

"Our history is long, dating back to before the Great Yu Dynasty, but..."

The priests remembered the information the Hall Master had just mentioned about the other party.

That Heavenly尊 had a group of disciples following him, all with prominent horns and signs of beastification.

This was somewhat similar to their Beast Hall's fundamental method, the Myriad Forms Transforming Dragon Technique.

However, the drawbacks of the Dragon Transformation Sutra were also obvious. Practitioners who absorbed the bloodline power of various beasts easily lost their sanity. Most people,别说 (别说) to transform into a dragon, lost their sanity even before transforming into a flood dragon.

But the disciples by that Heavenly尊's side seemed to be very clear-headed.

It was said they practiced a certain type of pictographic martial arts.

---

The other party's name was also the Myriad Forms Immortal Sect!

And, just like them, they were also absorbing the power of the myriad beings!

The more the numerous priests thought about it, the more startled they became.

Was there a slight possibility that what the other party said... was true?

Their Summon Demon Sect, did they really only obtain a mere fraction of the Myriad Forms Immortal Sect's legacy to get where they are today?

Whew...

The matter involved seemed to be getting bigger and bigger!

Whispers spread throughout the hall.

估计 (估计) Little Li never dreamed that he just wanted to get some power of the myriad beings, but somehow he even managed to deceive the Summon Demon Sect.

After a long while.

The Beast Hall Master coughed and said:

"No matter what the other party is, we must give the Holy Son an explanation!"

"Whether it's true or false, we must go and probe! Try to establish contact with the other party and first figure out if they are friend or foe!"

This involved the fundamental secrets of the sect. Although it was a bit dangerous, there were also opportunities hidden within.

The High Priests enthusiastically signed up.

...

The moon rose to the treetops.

Qingmu City was plated with a layer of gentle, water-like silver by the moonlight.

In the void, it seemed a clear and melodious bird cry rang out, or perhaps it was like a giant whale in a dream sinking into an illusory sea, its cry tearing through the sky.

"The Mysterious Sound Bird has formed."

A gust of wind lifted the window of the side room, causing Ying Bing's black hair to ripple.

She subconsciously opened the big-headed doll and took out the green jade hairpin. Just as she was about to tie up the black hair hanging behind her back, which made her back itch a little, her movements paused.

The green jade hairpin was soaked in moonlight, shimmering faintly, and it seemed to still retain the warmth of someone's palm.

Thinking of that warmth.

She remembered how Li Tiancai had improved the dual cultivation technique "Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh," combining dual cultivation with a foot massage...

It was an illusion!

This jade hairpin was an ordinary object, not made of warm jade! This warmth was just her illusion...

Ying Bing pursed her lips and used the hairpin to tie up her hair. She decided to try the newly acquired Extreme Form, the Mysterious Sound Bird Divine Intent.

Rustle—

Her flowing fairy dress suddenly dyed with golden radiance, transforming into a set of golden, exotic attire.

The lower half was light gauze灯笼裤 (灯笼裤), and the upper half was a fitted bodice connected with gold thread and gold pieces, exposing her flat, streamlined lower abdomen.

If Little Li were here, he would definitely exclaim:

"Wow, a Western Region dancer!"

"Would he like this?"

Ying Bing originally frowned, feeling this outfit was too revealing, but upon thinking of the expression of that Divine Hammer Little Overlord with eyes shining, she couldn't help but gently curl the corner of her mouth.

She lowered her eyes, and her soul surged with divine intent.

The Mysterious Sound Bird is good at dancing and listening.

She seemed to hear various sounds carried by the wind.

"This restaurant's business is really good. I heard the barbecue here was personally developed by Little Li Overlord?"

"Boss, how is the quality of your hammer? Is it good for hitting stones? The Heavenly尊 Immortal made us dig stones to offer to him."

Heavenly尊 Immortal?

Hearing the word 'Immortal', Ying Bing's eyelids moved slightly.

Which巫灵 (巫灵) deity dares to call themselves an Immortal?

It can only be him...

"Mom, can you buy me osmanthus cake for my birthday?"

"Silly child, your birthday is still seven days away. If I buy it now, it will go bad after seven days."

Birthday...

Ying Bing gently opened her eyes, her deep and quiet eyes reflecting the moon.

She just remembered.

In five days, it would be her... birthday?

These two words felt somewhat unfamiliar. After all, she never celebrated her birthday. It had always been just her, cold and alone, no different from any other day.

He still hadn't finished his business.

This birthday would probably be no different from usual, passing by as if nothing happened.

Anyway, she had long been accustomed to it.
