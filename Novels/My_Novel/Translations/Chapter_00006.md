# Chapter 6: The Lady Eats the Meat, the Commander Drinks the Soup

Luo Fang let out a soft chuckle as he watched the servants begin their work. *Heaven is helping me,* he thought. *These lowly beasts. It’s not that I, Luo Fang, won’t give you a chance to rise. It’s just that you were born with lowly lives, lacking the fortune for anything better.*

Lying back in his chair, Luo Fang watched the bustling crowd with leisure. When he grew tired of lying down, he would get up and walk around. If he caught anyone slacking, he would lash out with his whip.

He controlled his strength perfectly, striking only to break the skin, not the bone. He aimed for their backs, never their hands or feet.

“Hurry up, hurry up! Work harder! When you can’t hold on, think about the reward money, think about the chicken legs!” he shouted. “Heh heh, after the bitterness comes the sweetness. Who knows, you might even catch the Lady’s eye.”

He spoke with an air of superiority, completely oblivious to the hardship. Seeing the servants’ envious and fearful gazes sent a thrill of satisfaction through him.

Passing by Li Xian, Luo Fang noticed that although the boy’s steps weren’t fast, they were incredibly steady. He let out a soft “Huh?” and said, “You brat, you’re pretty nimble on your feet.”

“I used to run around all over the place,” Li Xian replied, wiping away sweat. His back was completely soaked.

“Put in more effort,” Luo Fang said, not paying much mind. He gave the instruction and moved on to someone else.

Once he was far away, Luo Fang spat on the ground and cursed under his breath, “A lowly life, yet he’s blessed with a fine physique. What a waste.”

The day quickly turned to evening, and finally, they were granted a moment’s rest. The kitchen staff pushed carts of fresh food over, serving hot rice and dishes to the servants one by one. Those on the water-carrying line, however, were not allowed to wander around even during their break.

“Here,” the cook said, handing a tray to Li Xian.

Hungry, Li Xian said, “This isn’t enough. Give me more.”

“We usually charge a coin for extra portions. But fine, you guys have it tough.” The cook scooped up a large ladleful. Seeing Li Xian’s young, thin frame, he felt a pang of sympathy and silently added another scoop of vegetables. He picked out two extra pieces of meat, deliberately choosing a fatty one.

Li Xian was taken aback. “Th... thank you.” He wiped the sweat from his hands, grabbed the food, and shoved it into his mouth.

The moment the vegetables entered his mouth, the taste was noticeably different. It was much saltier than usual, but this saltiness was a life-saving remedy, a way to quickly restore stamina.

After finishing the coarse rice and vegetables, Li Xian picked up the last piece of fatty meat. Just looking at it made his mouth water.

*If this were my past life,* he thought, *I wouldn’t even look at such a greasy piece of fat.* But now... he just wished he had more. The fatty meat entered his mouth, and with a gentle bite, oil filled his senses. The feeling was indescribable.

**[Skill: Carrying Water]**
**[Proficiency: 0/1000 to Mastery]**
**[Description: Carry water a thousand times, walk quickly without spilling a drop. Young man, do your waist, arms, and legs ache?]**

Even an ordinary skill, when practiced to a certain level, could grant extraordinary effects. Weeding gave Li Xian extreme tenacity and patience. Carrying water, in turn, trained his hand-eye coordination.

*Today, my Ox Fist saw no progress. Since I can’t change the current situation, I’ll do my best to master [Carrying Water]!*

A flash of determination crossed Li Xian’s eyes. The path is under his feet, and his legs are his own. If he wants to move forward, not even a thousand difficulties and ten thousand dangers can stop him!

“Get back to work, you beasts!” Luo Fang cracked his whip, the sound of it whistling through the air.

Night had already fallen. Torches were lit all along the water-carrying line, but Li Xian and the others continued their work. They endured the night in this manner.

Amidst extreme fatigue, the servants’ expressions were numb. Suddenly, there was a *thump* as one servant fell straight to the ground. Luo Fang checked his breath; he was still alive, but beyond saving.

“Carry him away, carry him away! Useless waste. All the village’s nurturing was wasted on you.”

With one person gone from the line, the distance between each person naturally increased. The burden was redistributed among the remaining servants.

From that point on, every half hour, someone would collapse. Some suffered heart failure from exhaustion, others had their tendons and meridians snap. Li Xian pretended to be on his last breath, but he just wouldn’t die.

In silence and numbness... three days passed in a flash.

In these three days, nearly a hundred servants had died. The route had to be redrawn.

“You seem to have a strong body, able to endure and take a beating. From now on, you’re in charge of this section,” Luo Fang told Li Xian.

He assigned Li Xian to fetch water from the village entrance and carry it directly to the roaring cauldron. This section had the highest death toll among the water carriers.

Li Xian took the two buckets of spring water. Feeling deeply apprehensive, he carried them into the village and, following the directions, made his way to the cauldron. Only now did he see the final destination of the water-carrying line.

In a spacious courtyard stood a four-legged square cauldron taller than a man. The fire burned fiercely. Even from five or six zhang away, the heat was oppressive, making his skin sting.

*So that’s why...* Li Xian realized. *The weather outside is freezing, but here the fire is blazing. For the servants carrying water back and forth, going from such cold to such heat, it’s no wonder so many die.*

He did the math. Three days had already passed. Less than four days remained until the guards’ competition.

Anxiety began to creep in, but his Ox Fist proficiency was still stuck at [712].

The further they went, the more servants died, and the longer the distance they had to travel.

*Overthinking won’t change the situation; it will only disturb my mind!* Li Xian steeled his resolve and continued carrying water back and forth.

Finally, they endured through the fourth day and night.

*Crash...*

The last bucket of water was poured into the bronze cauldron, turning into billowing steam. The flames went out. It was finally complete.

Servant Manager Luo Fang, Guard Commander Pang Long, and others all bowed their heads, paying their respects as the Village Lady arrived.

Li Xian was also there, standing in a remote corner with his head lowered, looking at his own toes. In his peripheral vision, he could glimpse the hem of the Lady’s skirt and her white silk shoes embroidered with phoenix patterns.

He couldn’t see her face, only heard her voice.

“This meat broth, I shall take for myself. The remaining soup is to be divided into ten parts. Commander Pang, you shall take seven parts, to distribute as you see fit, but do not drink it all yourself. Manager Luo, you shall take three parts, mix them with water, and distribute it among the servants to drink. You have all worked for me, and this shall be your reward.”

Her voice was light and carried an authority that could not be defied.

Before anyone could react, a gust of wind blew past, and the Village Lady was gone.

Luo Fang stepped forward, fawningly saying, “Commander Pang, we have no need for three parts of the soup. These two extra parts are a gift to you.”

Pang Long was a tall man with coarse features. He gave Luo Fang a cold glance and said in a flat tone, “The Lady has made the arrangement. She said three parts for you, so it is three parts. Do you dare to defy her order?”

“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare!” Luo Fang said with a forced smile, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. His legs trembled beneath his robes.

“Hmph.” Pang Long let out a cold snort, ordered his men to take the seven portions of soup, and turned to leave.

The remaining three portions naturally fell into Luo Fang’s hands.

Luo Fang wanted to keep it all for himself, but this was the Lady’s direct order. Even Pang Long had strictly followed it; how could he dare to defy it in the slightest?

He muttered to himself, “The Lady said ‘distribute as you see fit.’ I’ll drink one and a half portions. My nephew Bi Hao is at a critical stage in his training, so he can have one portion. The remaining half portion... I’ll mix it with clean water, boil it into a soup, and let the servants drink it. Well, I suppose that’s a bargain for them.”

He spoke, lost in his own self-satisfaction, completely forgetting that Li Xian was nearby and had heard every word. Li Xian couldn’t help but clench his fists.

The phrase “distribute as you see fit” was clearly meant for Pang Long. As for the second part, the Lady’s original intention was obviously to mix all three portions into the soup for the thousand or so servants to share. But in Luo Fang’s mouth, Bi Hao, who hadn’t done a single thing of work, got one portion. Luo Fang himself got one and a half. Li Xian and the others, who had worked themselves to the bone, had to share a mere half portion!

Who wouldn’t be filled with indignation and rage at such a disparity? Especially Li Xian, who was at a crucial moment and would soon have a showdown with Bi Hao.

“Hm?” Luo Fang noticed Li Xian and scoffed dismissively, not giving him a second thought.

Li Xian squeezed his fist tight. Within his fatigued gaze lay a sliver of ferocity.

In the remaining three days, he swore he would master the Ox Fist!
