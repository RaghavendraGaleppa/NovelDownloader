# Chapter 80: Unconventional Array Formation

Chu Feifei was genuinely shocked by Gu Mo's punch—a strike devoid of any spiritual energy fluctuations, meaning it had been executed purely through physical strength. 

The sheer power behind that punch was terrifying. Even a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator would likely have been obliterated by such force. 

Examining Gu Mo more closely, his claimed cultivation level of the second stage of Qi Refinement now seemed almost like a mockery of her intelligence. If Gu Mo was truly at that level, she'd eat that nut-shaped artifact herself. 

Of course, this conclusion only came because Chu Feifei knew Gu Mo practiced the Art of Concealment and had witnessed the punch's devastating power. To someone unfamiliar with him, Gu Mo's second-stage Qi Refinement might even seem impressive.

"Is there something on my face?" Gu Mo asked with a smile, rubbing his cheek as he noticed Chu Feifei staring intently. He knew some things couldn't be hidden after that punch.

Not that he cared anymore. As a disciple personally rewarded by the sect leader, wasn't it natural for his strength to improve?

"Your face screams 'punch me'," Chu Feifei retorted with an eye roll before striding toward the defensive array. Gu Mo showing her his hidden strength demonstrated immense trust, so she wouldn't pry further. So what if he'd obtained some fortuitous encounter?

Now an outer sect disciple and official spirit plant cultivator, it was normal for Gu Mo to have gained opportunities. Though recalling that punch, "normal" might not be the right word—no ordinary opportunity could produce such power.

"Haah—" Taking a deep breath, Chu Feifei calmed herself. Gu Mo's sudden display of strength had caught her off guard. When she'd learned he practiced concealment arts before, she'd guessed his true strength exceeded his surface level.

Back then, she assumed the gap couldn't be too large—with her special physique's cultivation advantages, she could catch up quickly. But that punch revealed Gu Mo's visible strength as merely the tip of the iceberg.

No matter. Though powerful, Gu Mo still needed her help with arrays. As long as she progressed in array studies, she could continue supporting him, ensuring she'd keep pace with him.

"Well?" Gu Mo asked as she inspected the array.

"The array's intact. Your attack's force was entirely absorbed by the nut." Chu Feifei eyed the person-sized nut artifact. That it withstood Gu Mo's devastating strike spoke volumes about its durability.

This confirmed Gu Mo had discovered the nut's true purpose. The current defensive array was the simplest version with no attack-weakening effects. A more advanced version would reduce the nut's burden further.

As long as the nut array eye remained intact, the formation would keep functioning. Replacing all array stones with such nuts to distribute attack force could create an impregnable defense.

Deploying such an array in spirit fields would dramatically improve security. However, such arrays were rare—mainstream designs aimed to minimize stress on array stones. No orthodox array master would intentionally direct pressure onto them.

"Miss Chu, I'll leave the array design to you." Since unconventional arrays shifting pressure to stones weren't mainstream, Gu Mo needed Chu Feifei to create one from scratch—no easy task, but his requirements weren't conventional either.

She simply needed to invert standard principles—designing what array masters typically avoided. Getting full marks on a test was hard, but scoring zero should be easier. With Chu Feifei's skills, this was achievable.

"Don't worry." She nodded, now handling two of Gu Mo's array commissions—one concealment array, and this unorthodox defensive formation.

After testing, Gu Mo uprooted the nut. Planted back in the spirit field, its self-healing would repair the damage.

Back in the field's array, they spoke simultaneously:
"That—"
"That—"

"You first!" Chu Feifei hurriedly said.

"How's your progress with the Art of Concealment?" Gu Mo asked. He awaited her mastering it to resume using his perfected Cleansing Technique, leveraging her special physique's fragrance for his Divine Brew Spirit Tempering Method.

Relying solely on Gou Youyu's few spirit wine bottles annually was too slow.

"Almost there. I can stay indoors these coming days." Chu Feifei also longed for Gu Mo's perfected technique—the explosive cultivation speed from fully activating her special physique was addictive.

Taking her words at face value, Gu Mo prepared a room, sealing windows and doors to contain the fragrance. As he finished, Chu Feifei extended her hand, cheeks faintly pink. The memory of last time remained vivid, but to activate her physique, she endured the embarrassment.

Gu Mo was puzzled—physical examination was only needed once; he could directly apply the Cleansing Technique now.

"Ah!" Hearing his explanation, Chu Feifei flushed crimson and stood abruptly. "Gu Mo, perhaps it's better to wait until I master the Art of Concealment. I—I should go."

Unlike Yuan Niya who understood the perfected technique well, Chu Feifei knew little, mistakenly thinking each application required physical examination.

Watching her flee, Gu Mo stood dumbfounded, sensing he'd missed something. Still, her point stood—mastering concealment first would better mask her fragrance, avoiding complications.

At Array Peak, Chu Feifei had barely returned when her junior disciple rushed in excitedly: "Senior Chu! Big news!"

Noticing Chu Feifei's lingering blush, the junior's eyes widened. "Senior! Did you and that outer sect senior already... you know."

"Thwack!" A flick to the forehead silenced her. "What nonsense! What's this big news?"

"Senior, maybe ask that senior if I can be his second..." Another flick ended that thought.

Finally, the junior shared the news: an inner sect disciple was coming to select attendants.

"That's it?" Chu Feifei said irritably.

"But Senior! This inner sect senior is extraordinary—handsome, powerful, a potential future core disciple!" The junior gushed, stars in her eyes.
