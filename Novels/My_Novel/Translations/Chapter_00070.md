# Chapter 70: The World Offers No Aid, Yet You Are a Golden Dragon

The author: Duōqíng Shíliu (Passionate Pomegranate)

The Prefecture of Poverty's End governs nine counties.

They are named after the nine colors of the world: Cyan, Crimson, Yellow, Green, Scarlet, Orange, Purple, Blue, and Black.

Huangyu County was far more prosperous than Qingning County. Upon arriving, a lively and bustling atmosphere greeted him.

Li Xian tied his long hair with a bamboo strip. His longbow was stored in a wooden case and strapped to his back. He wore loose-fitting clothes that perfectly concealed the long knife at his waist.

He appeared normal, but his handsome features caused passersby to glance at him repeatedly.

"Selling tofu!"
"Hot tofu! Fragrant tofu!"
"Come look, we have sugar figures here!"
"Freshly picked vegetables from yesterday, come take a look, gentlemen!"

Various shouts filled the air.

"Give me a bowl of hot tofu." Li Xian was hungry after a long journey. He approached a tofu stall, sniffed the aroma, and wanted something warm to eat.

"Coming right up!"

The vendor scooped with a wooden ladle, filling a bowl with steaming tofu. He sprinkled some brine and scallions, and a bowl of hot tofu pudding was ready.

"Three coins, sir," the vendor said with a smile.

"Alright."

After paying, Li Xian crouched on the ground and slurped the hot tofu clean. His body warmed up considerably, but for a martial artist, one bowl was certainly not enough.

"Three more bowls."

Li Xian handed over ten more coins.

"Sure, sure, plenty of tofu here. Take your time, sir." The vendor beamed with joy.

"By the way, I've heard it's been quite lively in the county lately?" Li Xian asked casually.

"Oh, incredibly lively," the vendor said as he scooped another bowl of tofu. "The winter exam results just came out. Goodness, we have several dozen more 'great masters' above us now."

"I can't read, so I don't understand the essays, or I'd give it a try myself. Who knows, maybe I could have become a literary master too."

"Here's your bowl, sir. I'll get you another."

Li Xian took the wooden bowl, which was noticeably fuller. The steam hit his face, melting the frost on his eyelashes.

With the first bowl filling his stomach, he savored this one slowly.

"Speaking of which, where is the ranking list posted? I'd like to take a look," Li Xian asked.

"Not far. There are several places."

"It's posted in front of the government office, at some big taverns, and even in some busy market streets and alleys," the vendor explained.

"I see," Li Xian said. "I heard the list this year is a bit different from previous years?"

"Ah," the vendor replied. "You're right about that. In years past, the top scholars all came from prestigious families. For some reason this year, a poor boy made it."

"But then again, an ordinary man with a treasure is asking for trouble. Wouldn't you say a talent like that is a treasure in itself?"

"For a common family, being a bit simple, foolish, or clumsy might actually be a blessing."

Li Xian's heart sank a little. It seemed the rumors were true. He then asked, "I didn't expect you to be quite knowledgeable."

"Hehe."

The tofu vendor scratched his head. "Didn't I tell you? I can't read or understand books, but I actually know a thing or two about those poems and phrases."

"Sir, another bowl. Take your time." Seeing Li Xian finish, he wisely offered another.

"It seems you know quite a bit about these academic exams?" Li Xian asked.

"The winter exam is held in Huangyu County every year. Even if I didn't want to, I'd know about it," the tofu vendor said self-deprecatingly. "Besides, for us common folk, the literary path is more visible and tangible than that 'martial way'."

"Of course, that's just talk. In reality, very few commoners make it to the top each year."

"What happens to the top scholars after the exam?" Li Xian asked.

"Hmm..." The vendor paused, thinking for a moment. "If you top the exam, you can report to the Prefecture City. The Prefecture has an academy, and the top scholars can enter to study."

"As for what comes after that, I don't know."

The talk of mysterious fortune and destiny was something common folk found hard to grasp.

"Alright, thanks."

Li Xian ate four bowls in a row, warming his hands and feet.

He went to a bustling area and saw a tavern with a red list hanging from its second-floor balcony. Various names were written on it, with no particular order.

"Li Xiaofan..."

Seeing his younger brother's name, Li Xian felt a wave of relief. "Xiaofan really made the list. His late-night studying wasn't in vain."

Even with a photographic memory, the effort Li Xiaofan had put in was still vivid in Li Xian's mind.

After their father passed away, the two brothers had no money to buy books. Li Xiaofan would often wrap himself in their father's coat and hide by the private school to listen in.

He used every means possible to gain a little knowledge.

Hoping to top the winter exam.

To give the two brothers a chance to turn their lives around.

Li Xian clenched his fist, his gaze turning cold. But as he looked down the list, he only saw thirty-six names.

"There are thirty-six people on the list."

"Now that Xiaofan has vanished, the thirty-seventh name is the key to this journey." Li Xian went to three other lists, but they all only showed those who had passed.

It wasn't until he reached the government office that he saw the thirty-seventh name.

"Zheng Caiqi"

"Thirty-seventh."

That's him!

Li Xian's expression remained calm as he left the government office. Next, he needed to figure out what kind of power this Zheng Caiqi belonged to.

By following the trail, he could find out where his brother was.

"I can't show any signs of suspicion."

"Otherwise, if I alert them, the situation will become even harder to predict."

Although top scholars held a special status, their unnatural death would be enough to cause a major stir.

But weakness is a sin.

These factors could only make the enemy wary. But his brother's life was still in their hands.

Therefore, gathering information required extreme caution.

Li Xian blended in, starting his investigation in the marketplace. The other party was, after all, a powerful family, and it didn't take long to find out that Zheng Caiqi was the seventh son of the Black Water Gang's leader, 'Zheng Blood Palm'.

He was the youngest son and was doted on greatly. For this winter exam, he had sent a full thirty men to accompany and serve him.

The "Black Water Gang's" main sphere of influence wasn't in Huangyu County, but Zheng Blood Palm had a share in the county's rice shops, taverns, and escort agencies.

"Huu..."

"Now that I have a lead, it's time for the next step!"

Li Xian exhaled, calming his mind. Hiding in the shadows, his killing intent was restrained.

Night fell in the blink of an eye.

There were few people on the streets. A group of three to five figures emerged from a gambling den, walking together.

Li Xian had been waiting for a long time. His eyes narrowed slightly as he quietly followed them.

"Damn it, I lost again."
"This rotten den, I'll tear it down one day."
"Ugh, such bad luck. They say the top scholars are heaven's favorites. I slapped that top scholar around, so why hasn't my luck improved?"
"Maybe you didn't hit him enough. That kid's bones were tough. I asked him if he had any family, but he wouldn't say a word."
"Look at his pathetic appearance. Even if he has family, what could they do? I say he should have just given the top spot to our Seventh Young Master willingly."
"Exactly, exactly. If our Seventh Young Master goes to the Prefecture City and enters the academy, wouldn't our Black Water Gang benefit from it? If we could even grab a wisp of that mysterious fortune, hehe, the future would be limitless."
"That guy, how can he be so greedy? A lowly mongrel like a stray dog, yet he dreams of becoming a great master."
"The Seventh Young Master is furious with him. If it weren't for him, our Seventh Young Master would have passed the exam legitimately, on his own merit."
"What kind of world is this? Still dreaming of turning his life around, what a joke."

The group spoke brazenly, with their arms around each other's shoulders, extremely carefree. Their skin was dark, and although they wore civilian clothes, it was obvious they belonged to the Black Water Gang.

Li Xian had followed them for some time. He touched the long knife at his waist, the Qi in his Dantian flowing to his limbs, and slowly trailed them.

The world was like this. When you are weak, everything is an obstacle.

"Xiaofan, if the world won't help you, your brother will."

"You are meant to be the Golden Dragon!"
