# Chapter 347: The Wicked Servant Teases the Mistress, Harmony Amidst Dependence, The Divine and Ghostly Marvel, The Strange Efficacy of the Fierce Garment

Li Xian watched Wen Caishang, her eyes rippling with waves of emotion. Just moments ago, she had娇声连笑 (娇声连笑: laughed with a charming voice), tears pooling at the corners of her eyes, her cheeks flushed a pink like cherry blossoms, displaying a柔媚娇态 (柔媚娇态: soft, charming, and alluring demeanor) in full. He recalled the昔日“折剑夫人” (昔日“折剑夫人”: former "Madam Broken Sword"), whose anger and joy were never shown on her face, dignified and elegant, gentle as water yet vicious as a snake or scorpion. To think there would be a day when she would beg for mercy in such a sorrowful voice. The旖旎风光 (旖旎风光: charming and romantic scenery) was difficult to put into words.

He thought to himself: "The Madam is steady and mature, with a graceful demeanor, her strength and methods ranking among the top. Such a beauty is like the bright moon in the sky, visible but out of reach. Yet, she just begged me repeatedly. This posture and state... are truly rare."

Li Xian said solemnly: "The wind and snow here are heavy. Madam, what did you just say? I couldn't hear clearly." Wen Caishang gritted her teeth, struggling was useless. She沉声道 (沉声道: said in a deep voice): "Little bastard, quit while you're ahead. If you keep this nonsense, I will really... Hahaha..." She felt a gust of劲风 (劲风: strong wind) attacking the soles of her feet again. Even though her martial arts were profound, she could only add to her helplessness.

He saw her soles were red and tender, her toes like exquisite jade, white and delicate. Frightened with nowhere to escape, she swayed left and right but couldn't avoid her fate. After a wave of laughter passed, Wen Caishang no longer cared about her dignity and哀声求饶 (哀声求饶: pleaded for mercy in a sorrowful voice): "Good hero, good hero, my good Li Lang, obedient Li Lang, please stop... stop it. Caishang this time, this time I really know I was wrong."

Li Xian said: "Oh, really?" Wen Caishang's cheeks flushed red, her strength depleted by half. Her body leaned against Li Xian as she轻轻点头认输 (轻轻点头认输: nodded lightly in defeat). Both mind and body admitted defeat. Li Xian was extremely proud and asked淡淡问道 (淡淡问道: asked faintly): "I wonder where the Madam was wrong?"

Wen Caishang thought: "Falling into your hands, I was bound to suffer this kind of torment. This little rascal still... still asks me where I was wrong, isn't this... too embarrassing! I... I can't just follow his wishes." She倔强不言 (倔强不言: remained stubbornly silent), turning her head away.

But seeing Li Xian make a slight movement, about to start again. Wen Caishang's soles itched, her scalp went numb, fear arose, she didn't want to add to her狼狈 (狼狈: embarrassment), and连忙说道 (连忙说道: quickly said): "The mistake was不该骗你 (不该骗你: shouldn't have deceived you), good Langjun, please stop teasing me. I... I have never in my life... never been teased like this. Treating me like this, I... I find it hard to adapt." Li Xian asked: "Strange and odd, what did the Madam deceive me about? I am extremely dull, please enlighten me, Madam."

Wen Caishang's pretty face turned completely red. Seeing Li Xian not letting go now that he had the upper hand, insisting on making things difficult, she had no choice but to say: "I... I was schemed against by you. This time, I really have no way to escape. Your various methods, even a real dragon would be captured thoroughly, let alone me. I just pretended earlier to scare you, to vent a little anger. Who knew you would... you would treat me without any mercy."

Li Xian suddenly understood and said: "So the Madam was pretending. If you hadn't said so, I really wouldn't have known. I might have untied you already. How dangerous, how dangerous." Wen Caishang looked at him with满目幽怨 (满目幽怨: eyes full of grievance): "Little bastard, you are the most cunning, thinking of ways to tease me. This crude trick, I figured it couldn't deceive you, and instead harmed myself. It really wasn't worth it." She依躺李仙胸膛处 (依躺李仙胸膛处: leaned against Li Xian's chest), recovering her strength and energy.

Li Xian pulled Wen Caishang into his arms, peaceful and distant, and casually said: "What the Madam said earlier does make some sense. If you had really scared me, I really wouldn't be sure if the Silkworm Garment Misplacing Jade Skill could解开阴阳剑势 (解开阴阳剑势: unravel the Yin-Yang Sword Momentum)."

Wen Caishang saw that this matter had already been spoken of clearly, her cheeks flushed red as she said: "What method is there then? My hands and feet are bound by you, connected and inseparable, I can't move at all. At this moment... although it is beneficial to the Silkworm Garment Misplacing Jade Skill, ultimately, I have moves but nowhere to use them. And the Yin-Yang Sword Momentum involves the essence of Yin and Yang. Although the Silkworm Garment Misplacing Jade Skill is infinitely profound, superior to the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, and its quality is several levels higher. But without the corresponding method to break the Yin-Yang Sword Momentum, even if the quality is higher, it is hopeless. And... I still fell into the hands of this little thief, letting you... you..." Remembering her earlier begging for mercy, it was truly a first in her life, her cheeks slightly scalding.

Martial arts are vast and profound, with thousands of gates and ten thousand ways being different. The Silkworm Garment Misplacing Jade Skill is originally a skill of "entanglement" and "change." The deeper the cultivation, the more one cocoons and binds oneself. It is useless for escaping. Wen Caishang was suddenly captured, although beneficial to the cultivation of this skill, she could do nothing about the restraints around her body.

Li Xian understood: "So that's how it is. In that case, no matter how much I bully the Madam, the Madam can't do anything to me?" Wen Caishang's heart skipped a beat and said: "Dead boy, bad boy, stinky boy, what else do you want?"

Li Xian said wickedly: "The Madam has bullied me for a long time, my resentment is deep. I must repay it well." Wen Caishang's heart cried "Oh no," and柔声说道 (柔声说道: said softly): "Good Langjun, you are young, you don't understand many matters of the Jianghu. How did I bully you in daily life? I was training you and teaching you. You are repaying kindness with enmity like this, you are disappointing my good intentions."

Li Xian laughed: "But the Madam always calls me a white-eyed wolf. I suppose I really am that ungrateful person." Wen Caishang said softly: "Nonsense, my obedient Langjun, how could he be an ungrateful person. Good Langjun, please don't torment me anymore." She tried every way to persuade him, but it was ultimately useless. She had to let him bully her, begging for mercy repeatedly, speaking only soft words.

The two played around for a while. The water in the pot had been boiling for a long time, mist floating and hanging above. It was now deep night, the子时 (子时: midnight hour of the rat), the bright moon in the sky, its reflection in the lake, the scenery was leisurely.

Li Xian temporarily let Wen Caishang go and attended to tonight's meal. The long night was leisurely and interesting. Wen Caishang was extremely羞怨 (羞怨: ashamed and resentful), her hair slightly disordered, her golden hairpin slightly slipping. Her秋波荡漾 (秋波荡漾: eyes rippling like autumn waves), a风情万种 (风情万种: full of charm and allure) glare at Li Xian. Smelling the aroma from the pot, her appetite indeed rose.

Li Xian saw the soup base was cooked and added ingredients one after another. The venison was extremely fresh, sliced thin as a cicada's wing. A gentle dip in the soup, and it was cooked and hot. Li Xian dipped the seasoning, held the Madam in his arms, and first fed the Madam to enjoy. Wen Caishang thought: "Such eating, it is the first time. Although this son is bad, when he is considerate and meticulous, it makes it hard to be angry with him. Well... although my current state is extremely embarrassing, this place is quiet and deserted. It doesn't damage my face too much." She opened her mouth and chewed delicately.

凡大族大姓 (凡大族大姓: For large clans and surnames),家规森严 (家规森严: family rules are strict). Those with profound family studies created a set of methods specifically for [Chewing Food], called 'Shi Fa' (食法: Eating Method), meaning family has rules, eating has methods. Wen Caishang, upon entering food,必细嚼三十七下 (必细嚼三十七下: must chew thirty-seven times). Slow and elegant, dignified and graceful. Following the eating method, one can naturally speak elegantly, the mouth and tongue smell fragrant, and the five grains enter the mouth without leaving impurities. During family gatherings and banquets, this无形考校 (无形考校: invisibly tests) the etiquette of the younger generation, and all kinds of manners and cultivation are put to use. Every move hides deep meaning.

Li Xian asked: "Madam, is it delicious?" Wen Caishang said: "This is the hot pot of Feilong City. I have read about it in books. When I first arrived in Feilong City, I tasted it with Xiao Tuan. That girl ate happily, but I wasn't interested. This kind of food is strong in taste and heavy in salt, ordinary people love to eat it. I don't like it, but just now after tasting a bite, it is fragrant and elegant, sweet and lingering, unexpectedly quite to my liking."

Li Xian laughed: "Of course, this soup base was prepared by myself. It contains over ten types of herbs and many seasonings, it can really be considered a medicinal diet. I figured it would suit the Madam's taste. The Madam usually likes to drink tea, craving that long-lasting sweetness, lingering between the lips and tongue. I remember all this clearly." Wen Caishang was very pleased upon hearing this, slightly comforted. At least he had some conscience, remembering her preferences. She was about to praise him when she suddenly remembered her own狼狈 (狼狈: embarrassing state), and changed her words: "Flattering and fawning, it's annoying to look at, and annoying to hear."

Li Xian said: "Hmm?" Wen Caishang saw Li Xian showing his power now that he had the upper hand, actually putting on a face now. She银牙紧咬 (银牙紧咬: gritted her silver teeth), unwilling to submit. But thinking of Li Xian's anger, and that she had nowhere to escape, she had to say: "Caishang knows her mistake, good Langjun, don't be angry." After speaking, she couldn't help but ask herself: "Wen Caishang oh Wen Caishang, when did you ever speak such soft words? Is this still you? If others insulted you, you would rather lose your life than speak a soft word. But... there is no other way."

Li Xian laughed: "Madam, please try this donkey meat."

He picked up the sliced donkey meat, dipped it in the soup to cook it. The many herbs in the pot combined with the donkey meat, creating a unique and fragrant aroma. Wen Caishang took a bite, slightly surprised, and said: "The color and taste are already very good. Is this soup seasoning really made by yourself?"

Li Xian said: "Yes!" He felt very excited. Originally, since meeting Wen Caishang in Feilong City,借夫人财力 (借夫人财力: borrowing the Madam's financial power), he had tasted many delicious dishes. At that time, the [Consuming Food] skill was already perfect, and he had悟得 [鉴品] 特性 (悟得 [鉴品] 特性: realized the [Appraisal] characteristic). Anything that entered his mouth could be appraised for its method of preparation and origin. Combined with the skill [Culinary Arts], his accumulation became even richer. At this time,调配汤药 (调配汤药: mixing the medicinal soup), although the ingredients were very simple, the color and taste were extraordinary.

He named it 'Fragrance Returning and Taste Layering Soup'. The first slice of venison was sweet and refreshing, the color and taste were not bad. The second slice of donkey meat was even better. It wasn't that the strong fragrance filled the mouth, the first bite was stunning, the second bite was greasy and disliked, and there was no third bite. Instead, it was a slow aftertaste, the more you savored it, the more fragrant it became. Eating it made one心旷神怡 (心旷神怡: carefree and happy).

Wen Caishang exclaimed: "Your culinary skills are actually quite profound! This recipe alone could generate wealth." Li Xian asked: "Please instruct me, Madam." Their relationship was complex. On the lake when crossing swords, they exchanged harsh words, but now they were strangely harmonious and warm. Wen Caishang glared at Li Xian in displeasure. This son only became polite when he needed her. She said: "The simplest method is to sell the recipe, you can naturally exchange it for a reward. But it won't be much, at most a hundred or so taels of silver. If you open a food business, establish your own门户 (门户: door/sect), you can naturally prepare for a big business, earning gold by the斗 (斗: dou, a unit of volume)."

"But opening a food business requires spending energy to manage it. And you need strength to sit and guard it. Otherwise, if others are jealous, smashing, looting, and burning, you will just bring trouble upon yourself."

Li Xian took the opportunity to ask: "If the strength is sufficient, can one open a food business?" Wen Caishang嗔道 (嗔道: said with displeasure): "Saying you are stupid, you schemed against me so miserably. Saying you are smart, such an obvious matter, you need to ask me. If strength is sufficient, not to mention a food business, the three hundred and sixty trades, any trade can bring wealth and fortune. But the strength referred to, is not just 'martial strength'. There are also methods, strategies, dealing with people, recognizing and employing people... and so on. For example, if you open a restaurant, your martial strength is very strong. Anyone who comes to cause trouble can be beaten away. You can naturally protect the restaurant safe and sound. But if the restaurant has people causing trouble every day, dangerous fights happen every day, how can the business continue?"

"It involves many Jianghu methods, and open and covert struggles with various industries. Furthermore, just because you have strong martial strength, does it mean others cannot have strong martial strength? In this,为人处世 (为人处世: conducting oneself in society), deterrent methods, reward and punishment standards, and the measure of取舍 (取舍: choosing and giving up), are all strength. Therefore, although our martial artists call ourselves 'martial', we are绝非莽客 (绝非莽客: definitely not reckless guests). We need to be proficient in various ways, handle affairs and adapt to changes. We must have both methods and martial strength to achieve success."

These words were truly from the heart. Experience and knowledge were precious. Wen Caishang used her words to maneuver, tricking He Wentian into destroying his own wall and opening his heart, but 解忧楼塌 (解忧楼塌: the worry-free building collapsed). Her martial arts were profound, her martial strength terrifying. Without He Wentian's help, she absolutely could not have done it. Li Xian felt he had learned a great lesson. He thought: "If the Madam hadn't taught me this experience, by the time I realized it myself, I would have suffered many hardships and bumped my head into many lumps. Under the heavens, besides the Madam, who else would tell me these things?" He真诚说道 (真诚说道: said sincerely): "The Madam is absolutely right! Li Xian has received your teaching."

Wen Caishang nodded, then幽怨道 (幽怨道: said with grievance): "I don't see you showing any appreciation. Loosen my ropes a bit, let me be more comfortable."

Li Xian laughed: "I'm afraid that won't work. Otherwise, I would be the one in trouble." Wen Caishang said: "You know it too. Forget it, I know your temper. Asking you to relax is absolutely impossible. I see you brought back many eats, please let me taste them."

Li Xian said: "Alright."

This meal was accompanied by a slight breeze. In the wilderness, water vapor churned in the pot. The two ate and drank together, discussing various matters. You took a bite, I took a bite, strangely harmonious. The pot soup boiled, outside snowflakes drifted, inside they leaned on each other, baking by the charcoal fire. It was truly peaceful and quiet, wishing it could be like this every day.

The Fragrance Returning and Taste Layering Soup increased the appetite. Li Xian and Wen Caishang ate to their heart's content. Suddenly, Li Xian remembered he had brought back a jar of fine wine, named "Heavenly Dragon Strong Wine". This was the strongest wine in Feilong City. Legend had it that three bowls would knock down a Third Realm martial artist.

There was certainly exaggeration in this, but it was enough to show the wine was very potent. Li Xian heated the strong wine and said: "Madam, please drink." Wen Caishang's pretty eyes were misty. She opened her mouth and drank, two red clouds floating on her cheeks. Li Xian also poured a few bowls for himself.

With this, good wine and good meat were all present. A meal of dishes lasted a full hour. Only the pot soup was left at the bottom, the table slightly stained with grease. Both were slightly drunk. Li Xian said: "I didn't expect the Madam's capacity for alcohol to be so great." He collected the pots, bowls, chopsticks... all eating utensils. He belly-blasted the stove, boiled and steamed, instantly removing the filth, leaving it bright and clean as new.

Wen Caishang had seen this move several times and was long curious. She asked: "Li Lang, what is this ability of yours? It seems to have the wonderful effect of removing filth?"

Li Xian thought: "It's fine to tell her." He laughed: "The Madam is right. Besides that, it can also avoid toxic miasma and eliminate filth." Wen Caishang奇道 (奇道: said curiously): "From my observation, it shouldn't be a martial art."

Li Xian said: "It is the Second Characteristic of the Second Realm of martial arts, the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown. It's just that I am a bit unique. I can exhale清气 (清气: pure qi), and it is very rich. Madam, does your Second Characteristic have any uniqueness?"

Wen Caishang暗道 (暗道: thought secretly): "As expected... Li Xian's talent is terrifying, his characteristics are also different." She shook her head and said: "As far as I know, historically, the Second Characteristic of the Second Realm rarely has any use. Your ability to exhale pure qi is truly rare. My Second Characteristic is not different."

Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes flickered, then she冷冷笑质问道 (冷冷笑质问道: coldly laughed and questioned): "Since the Second Characteristic is so unusual, then the Third and Fourth Characteristics, I'm afraid also have other differences, right?"

Li Xian thought: "The matter of the 'Divine and Ghostly Fierce Garment' is known to no one. This is a big trump card, not to be used easily. But since it has been mentioned here, why not probe and ask the Madam about it." He said: "The Madam overestimates me. Having one uniqueness is already a great fortune. The others are just ordinary."

Wen Caishang snorted coldly, thinking: "I suppose you little boy wouldn't tell me the truth. I don't know who supported your martial path. If it weren't for me, could you have today? Now even more... more rebellious, even tying me up." She turned her head away, getting angry in silence.

At this moment, Wen Caishang was leaning in Li Xian's arms, quite贪念 (贪念: greedy for) this dependence. Suddenly, she felt the warm embrace empty. Li Xian gently placed her on the prayer mat, jumped up, and left the carriage. Wen Caishang found it extremely difficult to move, her hands and feet反折 (反折: folded back) with nowhere to exert force, feeling endless curiosity. After a while, Li Xian returned to the carriage, held her in his arms again, and in his hand were two more swords.

They were the "White Snake Soft Sword" and the "Green Sword".

The two had a畅快 (畅畅: carefree) sword fight in the past, but they had abandoned their swords first. One was插在树干 (插在树干: stuck in a tree trunk), the other斜插入土 (斜插入土: slanted into the earth).

Li Xian exhaled pure qi, and the two swords shone like new. The handle of the White Snake Soft Sword was white, with a golden tassel attached. He asked: "Madam, your White Snake Soft Sword, is it usually stored inside the芥虚魔衣 (芥虚魔衣: Void Demon Garment)?" Wen Caishang said: "It seems you have初步了解 (初步了解: preliminary understanding) of the Nine Types of浊衣 (浊衣: Turbid Garments). Yes, the White Snake Soft Sword is usually stored inside the Turbid Garment. And the Turbid Garment is illusory. If I don't take it out, this White Snake Soft Sword is invisible to anyone, and no one can steal it."

Li Xian sighed with emotion: "How unique is the Turbid Garment. Madam, how many things can your Turbid Garment store?" Wen Caishang's temperament is eccentric. Vicious she is, easy to coax she also is. Being held in his arms now, she said directly: "My Void Demon Garment has three inner pockets, and there are夹隙 (夹隙: gaps) between the two sleeves. The White Snake Sword is usually hidden in the夹隙 (夹隙: gaps)."

Li Xian was extremely envious and said: "As expected of the Madam, your abilities and divine arts are unpredictable." Wen Caishang sighed: "But I was captured by you, this little thief. My reputation... it has all fallen here."

Li Xian laughed: "Ultimately, it is the Madam who lets me, allowing me to show off my power. If you didn't let me, how could a hairy boy like me match the Madam in methods and abilities? In my heart, towards the Madam, I have always been respectful and fearful." Wen Caishang said with grievance: "When you strike secretly, I don't see where you fear me, nor where you respect me. It's all just empty talk."

Li Xian said: "Is that so? Then I will repeat my old trick, let the Madam see clearly? Perhaps then you can see some respect and fear." After speaking, Wen Caishang's feet itched again.

Her ribs were also attacked. Wen Caishang glared, trying to suppress her laughter, determined to resist.奈何天性难逆 (奈何天性难逆: But how could her nature be reversed), she still laughed like a bell. They played around for another half hour before the fun gradually stopped. Wen Caishang begged for mercy. Li Xian asked: "Madam, am I respectful or not? Fearful or not?"

Wen Caishang, with lingering fear and enjoying it in secret, said: "Alright, alright. If you respect me, you also fear me. I can't do anything to you, I can only委屈求全 (委屈求全: compromise out of necessity). In this lifetime... I have been tossed around by you, it can be considered retribution."

The two returned to the main topic. Li Xian asked: "Madam, the Jianghu rumors say there are Nine Turbid Garments, spoken with certainty. But who set this rule?"

Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes flickered, thinking: "This son's martial arts were not taught by a family or sect, he has many不解 (不解: misunderstandings) about common knowledge. Usually when he asked me related matters, I would say one and hide one. It was all because he was very smart and cunning. Asking me this now,恐怕不仅是请教 (恐怕不仅是请教: I'm afraid it's not just for advice). I'm afraid... it's probing, wanting to figure out some things. I might as well顺他心意 (顺他心意: follow his wishes), and反而套他些手段 (反而套他些手段: instead probe out some of his methods)." She said: "It wasn't set by anyone. Instead, looking at ancient and modern times, it was summarized by generations of martial artists."

Li Xian asked: "In that case, looking at ancient and modern times, there must be some omissions?" Wen Caishang said: "Who in the world can be perfect? If there are omissions, it is indeed normal. And Turbid Garments have different names. For example, the褴褛破衣 (褴褛破衣: ragged clothes), in some families and places, are called 'Beggar Clothes' or 'Lame Clothes'."

She continued: "For example, your Pure Gang Qi Garment, also has the别名 (别名: alias) 'Tyrannical True Garment'. Did you discover something?"

Li Xian shook his head: "Not really, just extremely curious. Curious if there is an undiscovered Turbid Garment in this world." Wen Caishang said: "You mean the Tenth Turbid Garment? Although it can't be ruled out, after all, things are unpredictable. But the possibility is very small. Because from ancient times to today, through countless years of observation and summarization, almost every possibility has been included. To suddenly produce a Tenth Turbid Garment now would be too terrifying."

Wen Caishang laughed: "There are some野路子武人 (野路子武人: rogue martial artists), who think they are unique and gifted. They consider their own Turbid Garment to be the Tenth Turbid Garment. In reality, it's just ragged clothes."

After speaking, a sharp light flashed in her beautiful eyes: "This son is definitely not asking without reason. Since his Second Characteristic is special, his Third and Fourth Characteristics are definitely not simple. He can deceive others, but he can't deceive me." She couldn't beat or punish Li Xian, so she felt愤气 (愤气: indignation).

Li Xian said: "Madam, I once saw a glimpse in a casual miscellaneous book. There is a type of Turbid Garment that concerns the divine and ghostly, very strange. Which type of Turbid Garment is that?"

Wen Caishang said: "Since it is a casual miscellaneous book, why believe it easily?" Li Xian said: "I have always known the Madam is profound. Following you, if I have any doubts, I naturally ask directly. It's not about believing or not."

Wen Caishang thought for a moment and said: "A Turbid Garment concerning the divine and ghostly. According to that casual book, it恐怕不在九类浊衣之列 (恐怕不在九类浊衣之列: I'm afraid it's not among the Nine Types of Turbid Garments). That book also recorded some characteristics."

Li Xian said: "I just glanced at it hastily, didn't pay much attention. I figured it was deceptive. But the book recorded that if this garment appears, it is like a prison descending upon the world, disturbing the heavenly mechanisms, reversing Yin and Yang. Haha, I'm afraid it's just boasting wildly. I don't know which storyteller fabricated such a thing, it can only deceive ordinary boys just entering the Jianghu."

Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes were full of grievance, thinking in her heart: "I think it's you!" She had a hidden guess about why Li Xian was able to escape. She said: "恐怕不全是杜撰 (恐怕不全是杜撰: I'm afraid it's not all fabrication), hearing you say this, I倒想起些秘闻 (倒想起些秘闻: I recall some secret rumors)."

Li Xian pretended to be natural: "Oh?" Wen Caishang said: "Alas, I suppose those secret rumors are false rather than true. What's the use of saying them. Forget it, forget it."

Li Xian said: "Madam, please speak. I am very curious." Wen Caishang said: "If you really want to hear, you should show some sincerity, right?"

She saw Li Xian didn't understand and嗔道 (嗔道: said with displeasure): "I suppose you won't help me untie, but helping me活血化瘀 (活血化瘀: promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis), massaging and moving the blood, should make me feel better, right? Stinky boy, do you really want to strangle me to death?" Li Xian said "Oh" twice, quickly helping Wen Caishang massage and push the blood.

Wen Caishang said: "If such a garment really exists, I'm afraid it would be very惊人 (惊人的: astonishing). Since this garment can reverse Yin and Yang and confuse the heavenly mechanisms, it cannot be predicted, and its fate is hard to determine. I once said that I believe quite a bit in the theory of fate."

Li Xian secretly nodded. Wen Caishang continued: "If the record in that miscellaneous book is true, it is hard to know about other places. But this Tenth Turbid Garment, I'm afraid, has one extremely powerful ability. It might even surpass the Void Demon Garment."

Li Xian had explored the uses of the Divine and Ghostly Fierce Garment since obtaining it. But his knowledge was still shallow, his experience low. Although it had effects, progress was slow.

Wen Caishang said: "Do you still remember the encounter at Tiger Cry Ridge back then?"

Li Xian said: "Of course I remember. Although it was dangerous then, it was very happy. At that time, I only hoped to stay in the forest with the Madam forever." Wen Caishang's heart softened, and she muttered softly: "Glib-tongued." Then she said: "There were hanged ghosts and 伥鬼 (伥鬼: ghost servants) at Tiger Cry Ridge."

"I speculate that the Tenth Type of Turbid Garment possesses the use of '纳鬼' (纳鬼: absorbing ghosts)."
