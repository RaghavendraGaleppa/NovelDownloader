Chapter 290: Displaying Spear Art, Ghostly Qi, Astonishing Talent, Shocks Liu Qingyan!

The location was in the southeast of the island, where immortal mist shrouded the area and emerald bamboo stood serene and quiet. A stream flowed silently, and lush grass grew in abundance. Going deeper in, one could see a pavilion.

A stone tablet stood by the roadside, inscribed with the three characters "Heart-Clearing Residence." From within, the sound of leisurely zither music could be heard.

Yan Hao used his light footwork to arrive outside the Heart-Clearing Residence. Seeing the door open, he walked straight in. Passing through an elegant pear blossom garden, he arrived at the inner courtyard. He saw Shi Yufei in a stone pavilion, drinking tea and listening to the music, his expression leisurely.

Following the sound of the zither, he saw a pond that had been meticulously arranged, looking extremely elegant. In the center were rockeries, lotus flowers, and golden carp... By the pond was a scenic hall. Inside, an incense burner was lit, and behind it stood a screen embroidered with exquisite patterns.

The leisurely zither music came from there.

Yan Hao lightened his footsteps and walked toward the stone pavilion. Just then, the zither piece came to an end. Shi Yufei quickly walked to the screen and said, "Venerable Chu..."

Chu Liuqing said faintly, "No need for formality. Just call me Liuqing." Shi Yufei had intended to use the honorific "Venerable Candle," but upon hearing Chu Liuqing's words, he felt a wave of disappointment. The words seemed intimate, but in reality, they were distant. Chu Liuqing truly looked down on him.

He smiled and said, "Good morning, Miss Liuqing!"

Chu Liuqing walked out gracefully. She wore a hollowed-out bamboo hat, with white gauze hanging from the edges, covering her entire form. As she walked, the white gauze swayed gently, occasionally revealing the hem of her skirt and embroidered shoes... sparking endless imagination.

Shi Yufei had experienced many ups and downs, climbing from the bottom to a high position. His temperament was by no means ordinary, but upon seeing Chu Liuqing appear, he immediately stepped to the side, willingly avoiding her锋芒 and acting as a衬托.

Hearing this, Yan Hao finally understood: "I had just arrived when I heard Venerable Chu playing the zither, assuming the two had already met. I thought this Venerable Chu was inviting Chief Envoy Shi to listen to the music. Unexpectedly... it was Chief Envoy Shi who did not dare to disturb Venerable Chu's interest, so he quietly waited for the music to finish before going to greet her."

Yan Hao said, "Miss Liuqing!"

Chu Liuqing nodded slightly. She walked gracefully toward the stone pavilion, with Shi Yufei and Yan Hao following behind. Chu Liuqing sat down gracefully and said, "I am extremely grateful to Chief Envoy Shi for lending me this residence to live in for nearly a month."

Shi Yufei and Yan Hao both sat in the stone pavilion. Shi Yufei smiled and said, "The Candle Cult has split into factions, its disciples scattered everywhere, disloyal and disunited. The Water Altar is barely a place to take refuge. Thanks to its natural terrain, it can provide shelter for the disciples, which is for the best."

Chu Liuqing said, "Chief Envoy Shi, that is not a good thing. Matters of the Candle Cult must not be mentioned lightly. If others were to hear, would they not mistakenly think our Candle Cult is just like this?"

Shi Yufei's eyes shone as he said, "Miss Liuqing... the situation has changed greatly recently. Is the Candle Cult planning to create another glorious era? To revive its power and contend for supremacy in these chaotic times?"

Chu Liuqing said, "Difficult! Difficult! Difficult! Do you know why the Candle Cult was destroyed back then?"

Shi Yufei said, "Back then, the Candle Cult was an enemy to the entire world. Everyone united to attack our cult, leading to its collapse." Chu Liuqing said, "That was the external cause. If the disciples of our Candle Cult had united as one and resisted together, how could it have been so easily destroyed?"

Chu Liuqing said, "The real difficulty... is that the position of cult leader has been vacant for too long. Without a leader, the cult rules are undefined. Many rough and tumble characters joined the Candle Cult, the cult became a mixed bag of good and bad, and people's hearts drifted apart."

"A whale falls and all things are born... The Candle Cult was destroyed, and its sparks scattered across the wilderness. Some shed their past identities and established their own sects, developing with great momentum. Others, remembering the glory of the Candle Cult, lay low and bided their time."

"But the latter are decreasing day by day, while the former are ambitious. In such a situation, how can we revive the cult?"

Shi Yufei also felt it was difficult. Chu Liuqing said with emotion, "The destruction of the Candle Cult..."

"There are many reasons, but the main reason is..."

"There is no truly peerless genius to shake the heavens and pacify the four seas, to inherit the position of cult leader. The vacancy of the cult leader has intensified the contradictions within the cult, with no one submitting to another. If such a person were to appear, to control the Candle Cult, to win over the disciples with their talent, and to amaze the world with their martial arts, then despite the myriad difficulties, they would naturally be solved effortlessly!"

As she spoke passionately, ripples appeared in her beautiful eyes. An intangible, formless figure appeared in her mind, blurry and indistinct, perhaps herself, perhaps anyone, or perhaps non-existent. She thought, "If such a person truly exists, then even if I..." She suppressed her thoughts.

Shi Yufei shook his head and sighed, "Yes, but such a person, looking through the river of time, is hard to find even one or two. Even if one appears, they may not be from our Candle Cult."

As they were speaking, Chu Liuqing's eyebrows slightly raised as she looked toward the path through the bamboo forest. Li Xian had arrived late and had already caught up to the Heart-Clearing Residence. Seeing the "Heart-Clearing Residence" stone tablet, he stopped to wait. He pondered that chasing into the residence might be excessive, so he stepped back and waited several miles away along the road.

Chu Liuqing raised her eyebrows and said, "It's that kid."

Shi Yufei said in surprise, "How did he get here?" Yan Hao cupped his fists and said, "Chief Envoy Shi, Miss Liuqing, a while ago, this小子 made a bet with me. Today is the agreed-upon day, so he came to the pavilion to find me."

"I was afraid of delaying time, so I ignored him. I didn't expect him to be so persistent and actually find this place."

Chu Liuqing said, "Then go and drive him away."

Shi Yufei said, "Wait. Since he dared to chase you here, perhaps he has some confidence?"

Chu Liuqing shook her head and smiled lightly, "I think it's futile." Shi Yufei said, "Miss Liuqing is living here leisurely,想必 it's not very interesting. Why not call him in? Since it's a bet, let him show what he can do. If he makes a fool of himself, then I'll drive him out?"

Chu Liuqing's柳眉 slightly furrowed, and she nodded faintly, "Alright."

Yan Hao raised his Qi and shouted, "Kid outside, you can come in now."

The surrounding bamboo leaves rustled and trembled, like waves spreading from near to far, actually traveling several miles. This showed Yan Hao's profound internal Qi. However, Chu Liuqing secretly shook her head. Although this rustling sound demonstrated his impressive internal Qi, it also exposed the flaw of his martial dao being unrefined and his Qi circulation being loose. She knew Yan Hao was proficient in the Five Elements, so she didn't苛求 much, but she couldn't help but look down on him a little.

Li Xian entered the residence, taking in the scenery, and secretly thought, "What a fresh and elegant residence!" He bowed to Shi Yufei, Yan Hao, and Chu Liuqing one by one to greet them. When he asked about "Chu Liuqing," he paused slightly because he didn't know her name or background.

Shi Yufei, with a smile on his face, was about to introduce them. Chu Liuqing said faintly, "Chief Envoy Shi, there is no need for unrelated people to know my name."

Li Xian thought: "This woman is想必 a proud and powerful figure who looks down on me. Well, this unknown little servant of mine didn't dare to expect others to value him anyway." He maintained his礼仪 throughout.

Yan Hao asked knowingly, "Hua Wucuo, what matter brings you here?"

Li Xian said, "This disciple remembers the bet with the Deputy Chief Envoy, and has been on警 alert at all times, not daring to delay. I somehow chased to this place. If I have disturbed the discussion among you esteemed officials, this disciple will take his leave immediately. I hope the Deputy Chief Envoy and Chief Envoy will not hold it against me." He knew that since Yan Hao had let him in, the matter of the bet was already eighty percent successful.

Yan Hao said, "The bet we made in the past, I have already considered it a joke and did not intend to追究. Since you have obtained the Canyang Spear, you should not be浮夸 and impatient, but rather calm your heart and train diligently. Even if you fail to grasp the method, it would have been nothing. But today, you have偏偏 come looking for me."

"Since that is the case, since you take it so seriously, I will not treat it as a game either. Since it is a bet... there should be rewards and punishments. If you win the bet, I will teach you the Five Elements Strange Escape. If you lose, there should also be a punishment. Tell me, what is this punishment?"

"If you are afraid, or feel your skills are not yet refined, you can withdraw now. I can pretend this never happened. There is no need to feel ashamed. The nature of the Canyang Spear is special. Many长老 figures have not been able to cultivate any clue from it."

Li Xian pondered for a moment, knowing that Yan Hao was extremely proud of his Five Elements Strange Escape and his ultimate skills. The punishment at this time would have to be very severe, otherwise it would be underestimating the Five Elements Strange Escape, and there would be suspicion of getting something for nothing. Such clever tricks cannot be played. He said solemnly, "This disciple is willing to bet his life as the stake."

Yan Hao was startled. Seeing Li Xian's sincere and earnest desire to learn, and thinking of his humble origins and the rarity of this opportunity, he was willing to risk his life, which was admirable. His anger subsided slightly. He said again, "What use do I have for your life? Whether you live or die, what does it matter to me? How about this: if you lose, you will obey my commands for thirty years."

Li Xian said readily, "Alright!"

Chu Liuqing showed a hint of interest. As she drank her tea, her beautiful eyes examined Li Xian, surprised by his handsome face, which was quite rare. She thought: "This小子 has some cultivation, and as a commoner, he certainly has courage. It's a pity he doesn't know the severity of things. He thinks he has achieved some skill in the Canyang Spear, but he doesn't know he's just drawing a tiger based on a cat, straying into a wrong path without realizing it. How could a profound martial art in the world be something a country bumpkin could understand in just over a month?"

Yan Hao said, "Have you thought it through? This matter is no longer a game." Li Xian said, "This disciple has already thought it through."

Shi Yufei smiled and said, "You have courage. Since I am the referee, Hua Wucuo, please display your Canyang Spear Art. If there is truly something commendable in your spear art, I can help you reduce the punishment a little."

Li Xian cupped his fists in thanks. He walked to a relatively spacious area and calmed his mind. Yan Hao said, "Begin." Li Xian took out the Peach Blossom Spear, casually twirling it to warm up his muscles and bones.

He gathered his momentum for a moment, then successively displayed the spear techniques he had comprehended. Li Xian's mind was immersed in it, ignoring the others. He thrust out two consecutive spears, completely forgetting himself. The moves were plain and unremarkable, showing none of the Canyang Spear's essence. The Canyang Spear had been lost for a long time. Shi Yufei, Yan Hao, and Chu Liuqing had never seen it, only knowing that this spear art was ghostly, extremely诡异, and extremely powerful. But they didn't know the true meaning of the spear art, nor its essential principles.

They watched Li Xian perform several consecutive thrusts, seeing no异 in his martial art, no ghostly aura. They all thought: "It seems this小子 really couldn't grasp the essence. He came here to try to bluff his way through, to投机取巧."

Chu Liuqing's eyes showed understanding, as if she had long expected this. A hint of disdain flashed in her eyes.

Li Xian remained quietly absorbed. To fully display what he had gained, his mind was immersed in the painting. Ignoring the three people's suspicions, he continuously waved the long spear. The Peach Blossom Spear flipped and thrust in his hand, fast and fierce, his figure free and elegant. Chu Liuqing, Yan Hao, and Shi Yufei couldn't help but think: if it were just for the posture and appearance, this martial art was indeed eye-catching, but it was just to make a spectacle, ultimately difficult to be presentable.

Suddenly, Li Xian's spear momentum changed abruptly. He suddenly thrust his spear forward. This move was "Swift Wind Resilient Grass," possessing the momentum of a swift wind and the characteristic of resilient grass. Chu Liuqing and Shi Yufei were both strong martial artists. Although they didn't know the true face of the Canyang Spear, they could already see that this thrust was extraordinary. They couldn't help but become curious, thinking again that although Li Xian might not have grasped the essence of the Canyang Spear, perhaps by a stroke of luck, he might have gained something.

Yan Hao was already impatient and was about to speak to interrupt. Shi Yufei stopped him. Seeing this, Yan Hao knew the situation was different and focused his mind more intently on observing. Li Xian was completely oblivious, immersed in the Canyang Painting.

It turned out

that the Canyang Spear existed within a diagram. Li Xian wanted to fully display the spear art, so he couldn't do without the opening stance. It was like refining pills: first, one must build a high tower, set up the alchemical furnace, and then refine the pills after the stance. He displayed the painting, needing first to depict the environment, to set off the atmosphere of the painting, and then gradually enter the subject.

Li Xian successively displayed the spear moves "West Wind Brings Cold," "Old Tree and昏 Crow," and "Weary Human Shadow," already revealing the exquisite nature of the spear art. There was no ghostly aura, but one could hear the lonely scenery of the painting, bringing people into the scroll. He was diligent in his cultivation, grasping the essential principles of the spear art, which was impeccable.

Shi Yufei already let out an "eh?" of surprise. Chu Liuqing felt a hint of astonishment. Yan Hao's martial dao was slightly inferior, but he also knew it was extraordinary. The three looked at each other, feeling even more curious.

Li Xian naturally flowed, his spear body moving and打出 the move "Probing Grass to Startle the Ghost," which possessed the wonderful effect of startling ghostly creatures. It was like a calm lake surface having a huge stone thrown in, stirring up waves. Shi Yufei exclaimed in surprise, "It really is the Canyang Spear!" With this move, even if Li Xian's spear art was not yet refined, he had touched upon a fraction of the essence.

The originally desolate and bleak scene suddenly burst forth with wisps of ghostly aura. Li Xian then executed the move "Withered Crow Defeats the Moon," and the ghostly aura became even more雄浑. The spear tip划过 the air,发出 the哀鸣 of a crow, bringing disaster and misfortune. This move was a watershed for the Canyang Spear. After this move... each subsequent move became fiercer, like a恶鬼 wielding a spear.

Li Xian's momentum changed again. The sense of stability and peace disappeared, suddenly showing a wild and邪放 air. Shi Yufei said with惊喜, "Good! Excellent!" He had originally thought Li Xian was贪多, that he would lose the bet, and his intention to recruit him into the Candle Cult had faded. Seeing him shine brilliantly today, showing extraordinary skill, his past greed and arrogance had turned into daring to fight. His intention to recruit gradually strengthened.

Shi Yufei smiled and said, "Deputy Chief Envoy Yan, look at this spear art. Can it win the bet?" Yan Hao shook his head and smiled, "I underestimated him. If he truly has this ability, I will naturally teach him my ultimate skill. But on the path of martial arts, he taught himself. He could truly cultivate a clue from the Canyang Spear, but my ultimate skill, even if I sincerely teach it, he may not be able to learn even a fraction."

Shi Yufei smiled, "That is true. How could there be such a genius in the world who is proficient in everything? Miss Liuqing, what do you think?" Chu Liuqing was silent for a moment, her beautiful eyes slightly furrowed. She remembered her past evaluation, which might have been a bit biased at the time. She said faintly, "Just based on this set of spear art, this小子 is indeed passable."

As they were talking, Li Xian's spear art actually became more and more intense, with no sign of stopping. The Canyang Painting went from the surface to the inside, from the shallow to the deep...

He suddenly斜 thrust, the spear tip挑进 the pond. "Splash splash" several sounds, several waves rippled. White mist泛起 around. Li Xian's spear momentum flowed smoothly, executing the move "Canyang Plays in the Water."

Around them, "wu wu" wails arose, and ghostly shadows were reflected in the pool. Chu Liuqing's beautiful eyes were moved. Shi Yufei and Yan Hao had both stood up. Shi Yufei exclaimed, "We underestimated him!"

Yan Hao said in astonishment, "In this world, how could there be someone so compatible with the Canyang Spear? To be able to display such a profound art,莫非 he has... already achieved minor success!"

Chu Liuqing frowned and said, "I observe this power... it is indeed minor success. Did he really obtain the Canyang Spear just a month ago?"

Shi Yufei said, "It seems this Hua Wucuo truly has something unique about him! Not to mention the Canyang Spear Art, even for an ordinary basic martial art, achieving minor success within a month is extremely difficult!"

Yan Hao said, "In that case, it is indeed fated. Ordinary长老 figures would be frightened by the ghostly creatures in the Canyang Painting, but this小子 is fine."

Where Li Xian's spear momentum went, the ghostly mist thickened. He was almost like a wild and fierce ghost, but he had no opponent to spar with, so his power could not be fully displayed. Moreover, he only showed the "spear art," and did not特意 show off his many other abilities like perfect相生.

He pulled his spear back, sweeping the butt of the spear toward the ground. This move was called "Hanging Upside Down on a Branch." There were several living figures in the Canyang Painting that were hung upside down from branches. This spear art evolved from that.

He then followed up with a move "Ripping Open the Chest and Belly." The Peach Blossom Spear flew out, flying out of the Heart-Clearing Residence, and with a cracking sound, broke dozens of green bamboo stalks. After its force was exhausted, it used the bamboo's elasticity to bounce back.

Li Xian caught the long spear. At this time, Chu Liuqing and the others all felt surprised and strange. Li Xian had practiced the spear diligently and made rapid progress, all from the accumulation of sweat. Since he was showing his锋芒, there was no need to be restrained.

As he waved the spear again... the spear momentum shrouded the area, vaguely having a "ghost obscuring"之势. It was not just minor success in the spear art; it already had a considerable spear蕴. Shi Yufei repeatedly said, "Rare! Rare! Rare!" Yan Hao said, "Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!"

Chu Liuqing, however, said, "Strange! Strange! Strange!"

When this move was finished. Li Xian斜持 his spear downward, cupped his fists to the three and waited quietly. There was a moment of silence around.

Shi Yufei said, "Good spear art!" Yan Hao laughed, "Good! Hua Wucuo, you are very厉害. The bet is considered won by you! I, Yan Hao, am a man of my word. If you have time, come to the Martial Inquiry Pavilion to find me. The Five Elements Strange Escape... feel free to ask me. I will not hide anything, but how much you can learn depends on your悟性."

Li Xian said with joy, "Thank you, Deputy Chief Envoy Yan! Thank you, Chief Envoy Shi!" Shi Yufei secretly winked. Li Xian was very clever and cautious, and said again, "Thank you, Senior Liuqing!"

Chu Liuqing frowned and said, "Who allowed you to call me Senior?"

Shi Yufei said, "Miss Liuqing, it is not wrong for him to call you Senior."

Chu Liuqing gave Shi Yufei a faint glance, then said to Li Xian, "What is your name?"

Li Xian said, "My surname is Hua, name is Wucuo." Chu Liuqing said, "Have you practiced the Canyang Spear before?"

Li Xian said, "Never. After this junior obtained the Canyang Painting, I remembered the bet and did not dare to forget it, so I苦苦冥思."

Chu Liuqing frowned and pondered: "Strange, strange. Could this country bumpkin truly possess extraordinary talent?" She asked again, "Where are you from?"

Shi Yufei, seeing this, secretly felt delighted, smiled at Li Xian, and urged, "Just speak the truth."

Li Xian said, "I am from Qiong Tian Prefecture."

Chu Liuqing said with disappointment, "Qiong Tian Prefecture in Yu Nan Dao... a remote and undeveloped place, with no powerful forces, no prestigious families."

Family clans are entrenched in one place. Their strength is固然厉害, but their reputation is only known locally, so they cannot be called "prestigious."

Li Xian remained silent. Shi Yufei said, "Though his background is humble, he has been able to cultivate the Canyang Spear to such a level. His talent is not ordinary, and he is exactly the kind of talent our cult needs."

Chu Liuqing couldn't help but hesitate. She scrutinized Li Xian for a long time. His appearance and temperament were both quite extraordinary. She asked again, "What was your original background?"

Li Xian felt it was very strange, and answered truthfully: "An ordinary hunter's background." Chu Liuqing said, "Stepping into the martial dao, did you have another奇遇?"

Li Xian said, "Yes."

Chu Liuqing walked down from the stone pavilion and circled Li Xian. She was tall, but still half a head shorter than Li Xian. As she walked, a graceful and fragrant scent drifted around.

She was conflicted in her heart: "If this小子 truly used only a month to cultivate the Canyang Spear to minor success, then he does have something special. In that case, if I were to grant him that item, it seems... it wouldn't be a disgrace?"

"But his humble origin is a major flaw. If the Canyang Spear just happened to be fated with him, but beyond that, he showed his true colors. Wouldn't that mislead me?"

She kept pondering.

Shi Yufei watched silently, knowing that Li Xian was undergoing a great opportunity. If he could receive a favor, he would soar to the heavens. He himself, having climbed and rolled in the world for decades, gradually understood the truth of the world, and thus climbed upwards.

At this moment, he was willing to help Li Xian.

He said, "The Canyang Spear is an imitation of the Chimei Wangliang Spear. Hua Wucuo... since you have a destiny with the Canyang Spear,想必 you also have a destiny with the Chimei Wangliang Spear. Your future achievements are不可限量!"

Li Xian said, "Thank you for the praise, Chief Envoy."

Shi Yufei said, "Hahaha, I'm just speaking the truth." Yan Hao smiled and nodded.

Chu Liuqing raised her eyebrows slightly, knowing that these words were meant for her to hear. She secretly nodded. Although she felt there were shortcomings, considering the "Chimei Wangliang Spear," it was indeed possible to grant him the "Candle Order."

Chu Liuqing's attitude softened gradually. She said, "Come find me here again in three days."

Li Xian was confused but had to agree. Chu Liuqing, Shi Yufei, and Yan Hao were still talking. Li Xian took his leave first and returned to the Green Ox Residence, finally able to relax a bit.

Nangong Liuli hurriedly asked about the situation. Li Xian told her the truth. Nangong Liuli said, "Ah! Wucuo brother...莫非...莫非 you are going to join the Candle Cult?"

Li Xian said, "The Candle Cult? I also feel that the woman has a great connection to the Candle Cult. But she's being so mysterious about it."

Nangong Liuli said, "The Candle Cult... it was once a [Taboo Demonic Sect]. Anyone inside was a great demon. This Candle Cult is even more fierce than the Flower Cage Sect, but... this is also not up to you and me."

Li Xian sighed, "We'll take it one step at a time."

Li Xian had gained what he sought, and his mood was relaxed. He stole half a day of leisure and spent it intimately with Nangong Liuli. The two were becoming more familiar with each other, but whenever they cooperated on matters, Nangong Liuli couldn't help but feel shy.

The next day...

Li Xian entered the inner island again to visit Yan Hao. Yan Hao was very kind, knowing Li Xian had come to seek knowledge. The bet was over, and Yan Hao kept his promise, having prepared two books, named "Theory of Strange Escape" and "Five Elements Basics." They were both foundational texts, but they were filled with annotations and notes, full of personal insights, which could not be found elsewhere.

Yan Hao said, "The Five Elements Strange Escape involves a great deal. Your martial arts can be trained just by moving your hands and feet, but the Five Elements Strange Escape is not like that. You need to learn a great deal, and the foundation should be even more solid. If you feel it takes too much time and want to give up halfway, that's fine. You have a boundless future now. Seize it well, and you can naturally leap through the Dragon Gate. If you are also interested and willing to spend time practicing, if you have anything you don't understand or can't figure out, just come find me."

Li Xian was truly puzzled by the "boundless future" talk. But since he had obtained the "Five Elements Basics" and "Theory of Strange Escape," he hurried back to the Green Ox Residence to study them.

Nangong Liuli had considerable knowledge, and her family also had similar records. But she had never studied them. Li Xian was not selfish, and studied together with Nangong Liuli, pooling their wisdom.

When they encountered something they didn't understand, they would discuss it with each other. They would each state their ideas, summarize their thoughts, and record them in the books. Then Li Xian would go and ask Yan Hao.

That night, they talked by candlelight. They thoroughly read through the Five Elements and gained a great deal. Li Xian first understood the layout of the Five Elements and the strange uses of the escape techniques... He felt it was profound and extensive, and was immersed in it.

[Minor Five Elements Strange Escape]

[Proficiency: 1/100]

[Description: Strange Door Escape Arts, utilizing the changes of the Five Elements, executing complex and changing formations.]

In the blink of an eye, it was the third day.

(Ps: Asking for monthly tickets... I've recently made it onto the monthly ticket list. If there are many monthly tickets, I'll see the situation and find time to release more chapters.)
