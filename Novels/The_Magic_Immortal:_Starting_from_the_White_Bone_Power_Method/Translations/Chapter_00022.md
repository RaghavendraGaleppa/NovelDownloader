# Chapter 22: Thousand Ghost Threads

Once a Blood Oath Contract is signed, any violation of its terms will result in severe backlash—ranging from serious injury to death. For cultivators with no hope of advancing further on their path, this type of blood oath carries far more weight than a mere Dao Heart vow.  

Especially since this particular contract was of mid-grade quality, its intrinsic value alone exceeded a thousand Fa Coins.  

This woman must have something extremely important to discuss.  

Considering they could earn money just by listening, Wang Chan and Ning Jingming exchanged glances but didn't rush to leave.  

They carefully examined the terms of the blood oath. After scrutinizing it multiple times, they found no hidden traps—it simply required both parties to maintain confidentiality and abide by the agreement.  

Seeing that the contract was fair, their expressions softened slightly as they nodded in unison.  

Qu Lian, noticing their approval, brightened.  

The three of them each signed the Blood Oath Contract with a drop of their essence blood. Qu Lian then took out a gourd and set the contract ablaze.  

As the flames dissipated, the contract dissolved into motes of spiritual light, vanishing without a trace.  

Suddenly, Wang Chan felt a faint crimson mark appear somewhere within his body—barely perceptible, and he wasn’t sure if it could be sealed.  

Undoubtedly, the contract had taken effect.  

He wasn’t alarmed. Once the agreement was fulfilled or dissolved, the mark would naturally disappear.  

Now, it was time to hear what Qu Lian had to say.  

She stood up, closed the courtyard gate, and activated a simple formation around the yard. Returning to the table, she glanced around before retrieving a mid-grade Soundproofing Talisman from her storage pouch and casting it. An invisible membrane enveloped the pavilion where they sat for tea.  

Seeing how cautious she was, Wang Chan and Ning Jingming straightened their postures, their expressions solemn.  

"First, I must thank both of you for your assistance. Fellow Daoist Ning’s **Righteous Sun Art** is indeed supremely yang-aligned." Qu Lian smiled at Ning Jingming before turning to Wang Chan.  

"As for Fellow Daoist Wang’s **Revitalizing Needles**... if I’m not mistaken, their true name should be **Lesser Withering-Life Needles**, correct? Compound artifact restrictions like these are quite rare, and the **Grave Yin Energy** they employ for sealing techniques is truly remarkable."  

Having a sliver of his secrets exposed, Wang Chan felt a flicker of irritation.  

But since she had discerned it through her own insight—and was being forthright about it—he couldn’t exactly complain.  

Besides, it wasn’t anything shameful. He made a living with these needles, and his real trump card was no longer the silver needles anyway.  

Still, upon reflection, it seemed she had invited him precisely to assess the strength of his Lesser Withering-Life Needles. Now that she had confirmed their potency, she was ready to proceed.  

This woman was undeniably well-informed. After all, among all the cultivators in the Black River Market, none had recognized the true nature of his needles, mistaking them for mere Revitalizing Needles.  

"Fellow Daoist Qu, please get to the point," Wang Chan said with a frown.  

"To my knowledge, the **Lesser Withering-Life Needles** are a set of nine. Although Fellow Daoist Wang’s set is capped at twenty-one artifact restrictions, they are fully refined and thus no less effective." Sensing Wang Chan’s displeasure at her revelation, Qu Lian offered an apologetic smile before continuing gravely,  

"With all nine needles sealing the target, combined with the **Righteous Sun Art**, we can refine the mid-grade **Corpse Ghost Worm** within my body."  

*Thud!*  

*Whoosh!*  

At the mention of the **Corpse Ghost Worm**, both Wang Chan and Ning Jingming leaped back, retreating to the edge of the pavilion as if facing a mortal enemy.  

Ning Jingming instantly activated his **Righteous Sun Art**, enveloping himself and Wang Chan in a golden radiance while staring at Qu Lian as though she were a ghost.  

Wang Chan cursed inwardly, hastily summoning seven silver needles that hovered defensively before him.  

Unfortunately, his spiritual energy was of too low a grade to control all nine needles at once.  

Simultaneously, he channeled his consciousness into the needles, linking them to their black-and-white restrictions. If things took a turn for the worse, he wouldn’t hesitate to reveal his true capabilities.  

Still uneasy, he also infused a surge of energy into the mid-grade **Diamond Talisman** concealed against his chest—a safeguard with twenty-nine restriction layers—just in case.  

The **Corpse Ghost Worm** was simply too terrifying.  

Also known as the **Thousand Ghost Threads**, it was an entity of extreme yin and malevolence, ranking thirty-sixth among all known ghostly insects.  

True to its name, the worm took the form of countless filaments.  

Its behavior resembled that of the **Iron Thread Demonic Worm**—once it invaded a living being’s flesh, it would consume them entirely before seeking new prey.  

The difference was that while the Iron Thread Demonic Worm took a long time to devour its host, the Corpse Ghost Worm could envelop and consume a person’s flesh in just half an hour.  

Even worse, when threatened, the worm would self-destruct into countless threads that could infiltrate any defense. Once inside a new host, these threads would rapidly mature into new Corpse Ghost Worms.  

The only way to deal with them was to seal them first and then refine them with pure yang energy.  

However, given their extreme yin nature, sealing them required either overwhelmingly yang-aligned techniques or equally sinister yin-based restrictions—other methods were largely ineffective.  

Now Wang Chan understood why Qu Lian had been so interested in his **Lesser Withering-Life Needles**.  

The **Grave Yin Energy** within them was precisely the kind of yin-based restriction needed.  

"Rest assured, fellow Daoists. Since I can stand before you unharmed, I naturally have a way to suppress the worm." Qu Lian was startled by their reaction but quickly reassured them.  

Only after they had calmed slightly did she continue, "However, the worm remains a latent threat. Until it’s eradicated, I cannot progress further in my cultivation."  

Considering that her body was likely riddled with these ghostly threads, the fact that she could converse so calmly was nothing short of admirable.  

But given the danger involved—and the personal risk—Wang Chan’s expression darkened. "Fellow Daoist Qu, while my **Lesser Withering-Life Needles** do employ yin-based restrictions, they’re only low-grade artifacts. Even with all nine needles, sealing a mid-grade **Corpse Ghost Worm**—infamous for its lethality—might not be feasible."  

While nine needles could theoretically seal a mid-grade ghost or a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator, the worm’s notoriety made him doubt their effectiveness.  

Of course, if he switched to the black needles, three might suffice.  

The **Profound Yin Energy** within the black needles was renowned, after all.  

But his **Black Tortoise spiritual energy** was ungraded—it took nine strands just to control a single black needle. At present, he could only wield two.  

Moreover, he had no reason to expose his true capabilities for a stranger’s sake.  

Ning Jingming nodded in agreement. "My **Righteous Sun Art** is indeed potent, but given the worm’s reputation, I’m not certain I can suppress it either."  

Qu Lian smiled faintly. "Since I’ve managed to keep it subdued within me, I naturally have methods to weaken it. With both of you cooperating at full strength, success is assured."  

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming remained silent.  

That might be true, but what if something went wrong?  

If the worm exploded, they could easily become its next victims.  

"Perhaps you’d like to hear the reward first," Qu Lian said calmly, observing their hesitation. "A low-grade unorthodox cultivation method or a mid-grade spell. Upon success, you may choose one of the two."  

Wang Chan’s interest was piqued, and he studied Qu Lian more closely.  

Cultivation methods and spells were not things ordinary cultivators could just hand out.  

Moreover, she had clearly tailored the offer to their circumstances.  

When he had used the **Lesser Withering-Life Needles**, his spiritual energy expenditure must have revealed its ungraded quality—hence the offer of a low-grade unorthodox method.  

As for Ning Jingming, though only a decade or so older than Wang Chan, he was already a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator with deep mastery of the mid-grade **Righteous Sun Art**, indicating remarkable talent. Thus, the mid-grade spell was the obvious choice for him.  

"I’m forty-three now. I lack the energy to switch to an unorthodox method, nor the time to master another spell," Ning Jingming said, though his tone suggested he was tempted. After a moment’s thought, however, he firmly declined.  

His refusal was polite, but given his mid-grade spiritual energy, he undoubtedly cultivated a proper mid-grade orthodox method. A low-grade unorthodox technique was beneath his consideration.  

Wang Chan glanced at Ning Jingming before echoing, "My aptitude is lacking. I doubt I could make use of either."  

Qu Lian was unfazed by their responses. Tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, she said softly, "What if I added the qualification to settle and cultivate in White Mountain City?"
