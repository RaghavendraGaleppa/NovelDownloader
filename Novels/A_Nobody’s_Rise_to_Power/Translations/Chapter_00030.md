Chapter 30: Paying Respects

Li Youcai had been staying at the manor recently.

Logically, with the Young Master having just passed away, the salt pans and ironworks that were originally under the Young Master’s charge should have received extra attention.

However, whether the young mistress was pregnant was a sword hanging over the heads of everyone in the main branch.

If the young mistress was not pregnant, then the people of the main branch would immediately face the dilemma of where to go.

At this time, whoever was in the manor could take the first step.

Therefore, Steward Li would absolutely not leave the manor at this time.

Because of this, he waited for Feng’an Village Manor Lord Zhang Yunyi.

Manor Lord Zhang paid his respects as if climbing a mountain; he did not first go to pay respects to his superiors.

On the contrary, Zhang Yunyi first met with colleagues at the manor who held lower, equal, or even inferior status.

In this process, according to the other party's importance to him, Manor Lord Zhang presented gifts one by one.

He then pried some useful information from their mouths.

Only when he went to see his superiors could he better gauge his attitude.

Because of this, Zhang Yunyi quickly learned that the main branch had added a Second Steward, the former Young Master's guest, Yang Can.

However, Yang Can's residence was adjacent to Li Youcai's, so it was not convenient to pay a visit to this Second Steward Yang first.

After some deliberation, Manor Lord Zhang still prepared his gifts and came to Li Youcai first.

Feng’an Village was one of the six manors handed over by Yu Huxu to the Clan Lord, and it was the closest to Phoenix Manor.

If riding a horse, one could leave the village in the morning and reach Phoenix Manor by evening.

Because of this convenience, Zhang Yunyi, as the "test case" of the six manors, was the first to run to Phoenix Manor to "pay respects."

Li Youcai was very happy about his arrival.

This was the first person among the six manors and three pastures to actively come and pay respects.

Now, all factions were watching, waiting to see if the young mistress of the main branch could conceive.

At this time, someone still came to give gifts, and Li Youcai was naturally extremely pleased.

Li Youcai stirred the tea leaves with the lid of his cup, casually glancing at the dark-locked, gold-trimmed small box placed on the table.

This small box was one of the two gifts, one and a half feet long, half a foot wide and high, made of red sandalwood with copper corners, very exquisite.

Usually, such a box is used to hold gold and silver.

Li Youcai judged from the sound the box made when it was placed on the table that it contained gold, not silver.

Because the weight is different, the "clack" sounds different in the ear.

If it were gold, given the size of this money box, it should be able to hold twelve to fifteen gold cakes.

One gold cake is half a pound...

What a grand gesture!

Li Youcai's heart immediately grew hot, hotter than the mouthful of hot tea he had swallowed in his excitement.

He endured the pain of the boiling water scalding his mouth, maintaining a calm and indifferent expression.

"Manor Lord Zhang, you have, this time, paid respects to the wrong mountain gate and burned the wrong incense."

"Why does the Steward say that?"

Zhang Yunyi asked with a smile. Zhang Yunyi was nearly forty, with a good appearance; he must have been quite handsome when he was young.

Li Youcai smiled and said, "Manor Lord Zhang, you may not know this, but the Clan Lord has just appointed a Second Steward for our main branch.

From now on, the manors and pastures handed over by the Second Master will all be under the charge of this Second Steward."

Zhang Yunyi suddenly understood and said with a smile, "So that's how it is. I have heard of this matter, but doesn't this Second Steward still have to obey your orders?"

"Ah, that is not quite right."

Li Youcai waved his hand repeatedly: "The appointment of the Second Steward is not up to me to decide. If there is business, the old man and he must discuss it together."

Zhang Yunyi smiled slightly: "No matter how you discuss it, he still listens to you. I, Zhang, only recognize Steward Li's golden signboard."

"You..."

Li Youcai laughed heartily and said, "Forget it, since you have this intention, where I can take care of you, the old man will naturally do so with care.

However, let us put our cards on the table. Although you are a person promoted by the Second Master, that is your ability.

But from now on, you can only serve the Clan Lord loyally..."

Zhang Yunyi said solemnly: "Whether it is the Clan Lord or the Second Master, they are both masters of the Yu family. Yunyi has never forgotten that I am here to guard the gate for the Yu family."

Li Youcai smiled and said, "That is good, that is good. It is just that no one knows yet if the young mistress is pregnant, and everyone is in a state of panic."

Zhang Yunyi smiled and said: "The Steward is a capable person and can choose a good tree to perch on at any time, so naturally he needs to be far-sighted.

As for a person like me, I just go with the flow, so I don't have such troubles."

He took a sip of tea and continued: "I only need to burn high incense for you, and it will surely be fine. I cannot wait until the急来抱佛脚 (emergency comes to hug the Buddha's feet)..."

"Hahaha, I didn't expect Manor Lord Zhang to be such an interesting person. Ah, Laixi, come here for a moment."

Li Youcai suddenly saw Laixi carrying a bundle of split firewood heading towards the side room and quickly called him over.

Laixi put down the firewood, patted his clothes, and ran up to the hall, asking: "What are your orders, Master?"

Li Youcai said: "Go tell Steward Zhao of the Procurement Department that when he goes to Tianshui City again, help me pick out a servant girl."

"Alright, I'll go after I put the firewood away."

"Wait!"

Zhang Yunyi put down his tea cup and asked: "What, is the Steward short of a servant girl?"

Li Youcai said calmly: "Oh, it's just that Yang Can has just taken office and has no one to serve him, so I gave him a page boy.

That's why I thought of buying a clever and obedient girl to take care of the Madam."

Zhang Yunyi smiled and said: "So that's how it is. Why does the Steward need to look far and wide?

Just leave this matter to me. In a couple of days, I will select a servant girl that satisfies the Steward and bring her up the mountain."

"This... isn't that a bit inappropriate?"

"Steward, why be so polite? It is just a small token of my appreciation."

Since Zhang Yunyi gave both money and people, the two immediately became even more cordial.

They chatted for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, and then Zhang Yunyi sensibly took his leave.

Li Youcai saw Zhang Yunyi to the corridor and watched him leave the courtyard. Immediately, his ear was grabbed by a soft, slender hand.

"You old thing, I was wondering why you gave Wangcai to Steward Yang, was it so you could buy a pretty servant girl?"

"Ouch, ouch, Madam, calm your anger, calm your anger. Don't let anyone see."

Li Youcai, on tiptoe and head tilted, was pulled back into the main hall by Pan Xiaowan.

Entering the main hall, Pan Xiaowan's willow-leaf eyebrows stood upright, and she sneered: "You old thing, you still have the mood to buy a servant girl! What? If a young girl serves you, can she pickle this old, rotten radish of yours to make it crisp?"

Li Youcai said awkwardly: "Madam, please don't speak so loudly, please don't speak so loudly. If people hear, how can I, Li Youcai, face anyone in the future?"

Madam Xiaowan shoved him, sending Li Youcai stumbling. She put her hands on her slim waist and snorted coldly:

"This old lady was a fresh, tender young girl, yet I married this old coffin filling!

You won't even let me speak?

I advise you, with that idle money, it would be more proper to buy some tiger bone wine to drink.

So that when you have to exert yourself, you won't be like a toad gasping for breath—all noise and no movement."

Li Youcai's old face turned red, but his body was indeed not too... not great... not very capable.

The less capable he was, the more inferior he felt in front of his young wife. The more inferior he felt, the less capable he became.

This made him now even afraid to share a bed with his charming wife, fearing she would have demands for intimacy.

As for buying a pretty servant girl, he had no such pressure.

His own wife, he had a responsibility to satisfy, but the servant girl he bought was just an object in his house; he didn't need to care about this little girl's feelings!

Li Youcai, his face burning from Pan Xiaowan's words, said in a low, humble voice: "Madam, you have really misunderstood me.

Do you think Zhang Yunyi came here for what? To find a backer and hug a thigh?"

"What do you mean?"

"Madam, it's not certain yet whether the young mistress is pregnant. Who would come to hug a thigh with a heavy gift at this time?

Feng'an Village is right outside Phoenix Mountain; it is the best vantage point for the Second Master to keep an eye on the Clan Lord."

Pan Xiaowan's eyes darted around: "He came on behalf of the Second Master to recruit you?"

Li Youcai praised: "Madam, you are truly ice and snow smart!

Your man is the Steward of the main branch. Even if the main branch is dissolved, your man will still have a good place to go.

It is precisely because Zhang Yunyi saw this that he wanted to recruit me for the Second Master."

Pan Xiaowan grew a bit nervous: "You aren't really thinking of defecting to the Second Master, are you?

The Clan Lord has treated you well. Once a traitor, always a traitor.

If you take the wrong path and back the wrong person..."

Li Youcai waved his hand: "How could that be? Of course, I have to wait and see. As long as the situation is not clear, I will continue to wait for a better offer.

But that doesn't affect me accepting his 'kindness.'

If I accept it, and in the future I do lean towards the Second Master, that will show that I expressed my loyalty to the Second Master early on.

Giving help in a time of snow and adding flowers in the midst of brocade—the results are very different.

If in the future I remain loyal to the Clan Lord, it will also show that I was not tempted by the Second Master's generous profits.

As for accepting his things, it is just to deceive him."

Pan Xiaowan listened, half believing and half doubting, and said: "Alright, this old lady will trust you this time.

If you old thing deceive me, and while your own field is parched with thirst, you go stirring up trouble outside, Hmph!"

"Couldn't be, couldn't be, how could that be?"

Li Youcai said while secretly thinking, *The speed at which this old man偷腥 (steals fish) is faster than you can imagine. If you found out, it would be a ghost.*

Li Youcai pointed at the two boxes on the table and said: "See, if your man weren't capable, would these gifts be flowing in like water?

Madam, quickly put them away..."

With Li Youcai's words, he finally shifted Pan Xiaowan's attention.

Pan Xiaowan opened the two boxes. As Li Youcai expected, one contained neatly stacked gold cakes.

In the other box, however, was an exquisitely carved "ox-horn vessel," which had taken on a jade-like color.

Inside the semi-transparent horn was a light red liquid. When the stopper was pulled out, the aroma of medicinal wine mixed with alcohol fragrance wafted over them.

Li Youcai said joyfully: "Medicinal wine?"

Pan Xiaowan, however, raised her delicate eyebrows and thought, *This good stuff is a complete waste if given to the old thing to drink.*

*I'll take some later and have Young Steward Yang test its quality.*
