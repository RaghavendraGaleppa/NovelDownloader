# A Quick Chat - The Immortal's Path Novel  

Since the book's release, I’ve generally avoided engaging with those who feel the need to "instruct" me on how to write.  

Veteran readers know that any serious author has a complete outline, intricate plot threads, and detailed subplots—all interwoven into a cohesive narrative.  

Making abrupt changes to the story is a cardinal sin.  

Every character I introduce serves a purpose. There’s no need to rush with doubts—just be patient, and the truth will unfold in time.  

If readers point out flaws I agree with, I’ll take them into account. But if I believe the logic is sound and the narrative holds together, I won’t bend just to please everyone.  

There’s no point in arguing with me—I won’t engage in it either.  

Some readers want me to avoid creativity and stick to formulaic elements like "dungeons," "secret realms," or "sect trials."  

Sorry, but as an author, I have my own style. Books like that are a dime a dozen—what difference would it make if I wrote one?  

My goal in writing is to bring the unique, imaginative world of immortal heroes in my mind to life.  

Every setting, every plot point, every character—even the exact number of enhancement points gained, spent, or remaining—has been meticulously calculated and double-checked.  

My job is to write; yours is to enjoy.  

Why complicate things?  

And there’s no need to threaten to "drop the book" as leverage. Writing isn’t my livelihood—it’s my passion.  

*The Immortal’s Path* has been out for two and a half months, with 520,000 words written, and I’ve earned a grand total of 820 yuan.  

I’ve been burning the midnight oil after work every day for 820 yuan—do you really think I’m doing this for the money?  

So don’t overthink it. Follow your heart—if you don’t like it, drop it and cut your losses.  

There will always be someone who enjoys it. Even if just one person does, that’s enough for me.  

As for why I keep writing despite the lack of financial reward?  

Because I love it.  

As the saying goes: Passion makes the long years feel short.  

Alright, back to writing!
