# Chapter 78: The Jade Slip  

The ten-cubic-meter storage pouch clearly indicated that the late-stage Qi Refining cultivator from the Profound Nether Sect whom Li Shiming had killed was no ordinary figure.  

This was further reflected in the items within the pouch. As Li Shiming focused his spiritual sense inside, he quickly identified the most important object among the pile of belongings.  

"How could there be a jade slip here?" Li Shiming had just received two cultivation techniques from his sect and knew how strictly the sect controlled such knowledge.  

Finding a jade slip in this storage pouch was completely unexpected.  

However, he didn't get too excited—there was a high chance the jade slip was blank, just like the two he had received from the sect's archive. Those slips would erase their contents after a set period, and the archive had forbidden him from leaving the sect during that time. The Profound Nether Sect likely had similar restrictions.  

He took out the jade slip and pressed it against his forehead.  

A stream of information flowed from the slip into his mind. After absorbing a large amount of data, his eyes glazed over in confusion.  

Quickly, he connected his consciousness to IBMz15 to verify whether he had made a mistake or if the contents of the jade slip were truly incomprehensible.  

The newly created document in IBMz15 contained words he recognized individually, but when strung together, they made no sense.  

"No wonder they dared to carry this jade slip—it's encrypted!" Li Shiming quickly realized.  

Encryption was a common practice in his previous life. Whether it was computer code, secure communications, or classified military and industrial data, encryption was everywhere.  

Li Shiming couldn't help but smile. For people in this world, decrypting such content would be an immense challenge, requiring astronomical computational power.  

But he had IBMz15. Large-scale servers excelled at massive calculations—precisely IBMz15's specialty.  

He pulled up extensive decryption materials, quickly studied them, and then wrote a decryption program while referencing existing methods.  

From there, it was out of his hands. IBMz15 would handle the decryption, testing every possible permutation to crack the jade slip's contents.  

His attention returned to the storage pouch. He ignored the black banners and instead focused on five large weapons—all low-grade magical artifacts.  

Two giant axes and three massive hammers. Though they were only low-grade, their sheer size meant the materials used for each could have made over a dozen ordinary low-grade artifacts.  

Next, he noticed more items wrapped in black cloth, each radiating dense spiritual energy. Their value was clearly extraordinary.  

"That's it?" Li Shiming muttered in mild disappointment after taking stock.  

---  

The ten-cubic-meter storage pouch was stuffed with items, yet none seemed immediately useful.  

The only thing that might have value was the jade slip—and even that depended on whether the decrypted contents were worth anything.  

If the slip contained some demonic cultivation technique, he wouldn't dare practice it anyway.  

As for the five oversized low-grade artifacts, even though his body had been tempered by spiritual energy, wielding such massive weapons would be impractical. He lacked the necessary combat techniques and raw strength.  

At least the storage pouch itself was a decent reward. Among Qi Refining cultivators, its capacity was nearly top-tier.  

A soft *ding* sounded in his mind.  

IBMz15 had finished decrypting the jade slip.  

"That fast?" Li Shiming knew how powerful IBMz15's processing capabilities were, but he hadn't expected the decryption to complete so quickly.  

It had taken less time than he had spent writing the decryption program.  

At his command, IBMz15 displayed the decrypted contents. Li Shiming instantly absorbed the information.  

*'Profound Nether Corpse Refining Chapter'*—a corpse-refining technique, and one named after the Profound Nether Sect itself.  

Normally, techniques bearing a sect's name were core teachings.  

The *'Profound Nether Corpse Refining Chapter'* contained extensive knowledge, but it only covered up to the Iron Corpse stage. Beyond that, there was nothing.  

Even reaching the Iron Corpse stage required a vast amount of resources for the Copper Corpse's advancement. The technique ended right after detailing how to evolve a Copper Corpse into an Iron Corpse.  

There wasn't even a hint about how to progress further. If not for the Iron Corpse evolution method, this would barely qualify as a Qi Refining-level technique.  

As Li Shiming sifted through the content, he noticed something familiar.  

"Fivefold Nether Ginseng, Gu Lotus, Corrosive Illusion Grass, Malicious Water Poison Vine..." Each entry came with illustrations, and the more he looked, the more he recognized them—he had just seen these among the black-wrapped items.  

He retrieved the wrapped objects from both storage pouches. Aside from materials used in corpse refinement, about 80% of the resources needed to evolve a Copper Corpse into an Iron Corpse were present.  

Only three materials were missing. He couldn't understand why someone would carry such important resources into battle.  

And why would a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator from the Profound Nether Sect—who didn’t even have a refined corpse—carry the *'Profound Nether Corpse Refining Chapter'* and a pile of refinement materials? What was the logic?  

---  

What Li Shiming didn’t know was that the Profound Nether Sect cultivator he had killed underwater was essentially a "cultivation heir"—a privileged disciple with powerful backing.  

He had accompanied Elder Jiang Bing on this mission specifically to gather corpse-refining materials.  

The *'Profound Nether Corpse Refining Chapter'* was renowned because the Profound Nether Sect's refined corpses possessed extraordinary combat power and growth potential.  

The combat power stemmed from generations of refinement techniques and tactical designs, perfected over centuries of research.  

As for growth potential, it all came down to the materials used.  

Why didn’t more Profound Nether Sect disciples practice corpse refinement, despite its power?  

Because the *'Profound Nether Corpse Refining Chapter'* required corpses with exceptional spiritual roots—preferably single-spiritual-rooted individuals, or at least dual-spiritual-rooted ones.  

Anything weaker wasn’t even considered.  

Single-spiritual-rooted corpses had the highest growth potential, while dual-spiritual-rooted ones were slightly inferior.  

To prevent sect members from turning their own territory’s single-spiritual-rooted talents into corpses, the Profound Nether Sect had implemented strict controls—but such practices were impossible to fully suppress.  

As a result, the sect often sent disciples to abduct talented individuals from other sects, providing "cultivation heirs" with materials they couldn’t obtain through normal means.  

The late-stage Qi Refining cultivator Li Shiming had killed had prepared these materials to process any suitable corpse immediately.  

His target had been Li Shiming himself—after all, a young Qi Refining third-stage cultivator stood out like a beacon among ordinary spiritual root candidates.
