# Chapter 3: Meridian-Unblocking Pill

**[Qi-Gathering Pill]**

Quality: Mundane  
Description: Slightly increases qi-gathering speed, mildly reduces meridian damage, has minor blood-activating and stasis-resolving effects, and provides some nourishment to qi and blood.  
Enhancement Cost: 2 points  

Lin Shan stared excitedly at the prompt before him, his earlier troubles from the day completely forgotten, replaced by exhilaration. His golden finger hadn't abandoned him after all!  

He then began pondering the uses of this interface.  

The Qi-Gathering Pill was nothing new—since the age of ten, the clan had been distributing it to outer courtyard disciples, and its effects matched the description before him.  

The pill itself was concocted from the essence blood of fierce beasts and various medicinal herbs, aiding martial artists in cultivating internal energy, nourishing vital essence, and improving qi-gathering speed, among other auxiliary benefits.  

Due to differing aptitudes, people naturally varied in meridian strength. Circulating qi and blood continuously scoured the meridians, and some could only practice for an hour before needing to stop. Forcing further practice would damage the meridians, leading to hidden injuries over time.  

Thus, each person's daily training time was limited. With pill assistance, efficiency and duration could naturally be improved. However, since pills required numerous rare materials, only large clans could afford to supply them.  

Take the mighty Lin Clan, for example. Outer courtyard branch disciples received ten pills per month, while the inner courtyard's main lineage disciples received thirty—equivalent to taking pills daily, making their cultivation speed three times faster than their outer courtyard counterparts of equal aptitude.  

Over time, the gap only widened, making it impossible for branch disciples to surpass the main lineage. Rumor had it that the children of high-ranking elders treated such basic pills like candy!  

By the age of sixteen, before adulthood, about a third of inner courtyard disciples would break through to the Qi-Transformation Realm, becoming Postnatal experts. In contrast, few outer courtyard disciples achieved this, failing to cultivate true qi. As adults, they could only leave the clan to work in external family businesses.  

Of course, Lin Fan—that cheat—was an exception. After tonight's events, Lin Shan no longer considered him human.  

"Enhancement Cost: 2 points? This thing can be enhanced?"  

Staring at the pill in his hand and the transparent interface before him, Lin Shan stroked his chin in thought.  

It seemed his long-delayed golden finger was an "enhancement" cheat, capable of upgrading items from this world. However, there was no manual explaining how enhancement worked or what the results would be—he'd have to figure it out himself.  

According to the prompt, enhancement wasn't free—it required enhancement points.  

The "2 points" needed for the Qi-Gathering Pill likely referred to the "Ancient Aura" absorbed from the painting earlier. He then spotted a corresponding number "5" in the top-right corner of the panel.  

"Could it be that the cheat was already here, but I only activated it today after accidentally obtaining enhancement points?"  

Lin Shan made a rough guess. Enhancement points had to be obtained from the outside world, and the key was the "Ancient Aura" he'd encountered earlier.  

But what exactly was "Ancient Aura"? Since it appeared in the painting *Mandarin Ducks on a Spring River*, did it have something to do with antiques?  

With too little information, he set the question aside for now and refocused on the Qi-Gathering Pill. He had no idea what it would become after enhancement.  

Should he give it a try?  

Deciding to test his golden finger's unique abilities, Lin Shan concentrated on the enhancement panel and firmly willed:  

"Enhance!"  

A brilliant flash of light erupted from his palm. The originally dull, blood-red pill the size of a thumb instantly transformed into a smooth, pale-red pill the size of a longan fruit, exuding a faint fragrance with a subtle halo at its crown—barely noticeable unless closely observed.  

The transparent interface updated accordingly, displaying a new description:  

**[Meridian-Unblocking Pill]**  

Quality: Postnatal  
Description: Has a chance to assist in unblocking the Danzhong acupoint, opening the dantian, and gathering qi. Provides moderate nourishment to qi and blood, minor blood-activating and stasis-resolving effects, and slight marrow-cleansing effects.  
Enhancement Cost: 4 points  

...  

"Holy cow!"  

Lin Shan's eyes widened as he stared at the enhanced panel, his excitement solely focused on the description's mention of "a chance to unblock the Danzhong acupoint and open the dantian."  

For ordinary people to cultivate true qi and become true martial artists—capable of venturing into the jianghu—the key milestone was unblocking the Danzhong acupoint and opening the dantian.  

"So a simple Qi-Gathering Pill, once enhanced, becomes a treasure pill that can elevate an ordinary person to a martial artist!"  

Lin Shan's hands trembled slightly as he held the pale-red pill, his throat dry with anticipation.  

After nearly a decade of relentless cultivation since his transmigration, he still hadn't even touched the threshold of the martial artist realm. But with this pill, he finally had a chance to break through to the Qi-Transformation Realm!  

With his generation's coming-of-age ceremony at sixteen approaching, he would soon leave the clan's protection and need strength to safeguard himself.  

Amid his joy, Lin Shan noticed that the enhanced Meridian-Unblocking Pill could be further upgraded by the enhancement panel.  

"Originally, the Qi-Gathering Pill was mundane-grade, but after enhancement, it became a postnatal-grade pill."  

"Would further enhancement turn it into a prenatal-grade pill?"  

Lin Shan's imagination ran wild. What would happen if he consumed a prenatal-grade pill in one go?  

However, further enhancing the Meridian-Unblocking Pill required 4 points, and his remaining "Ancient Aura" was only 3—not enough to fuel his fantasy.  

Never mind—he'd focus on breaking through first!  

...  

After calming himself, Lin Shan entered a meditative state. As his breathing steadied and his qi and blood circulated three full cycles, he felt his condition peak.  

He swallowed the Meridian-Unblocking Pill, chewing and swallowing it. Gradually, waves of warmth surged through his body, growing stronger as his qi and blood circulated.  

The potent medicinal energy dispersed gently, rising from his abdomen like a flickering flame. Wisps of white mist escaped his nose and ears, his face glowing faintly red as if he were inside a blazing furnace.  

Lin Shan cycled his energy repeatedly until the qi and blood reached their peak, his meridians barely able to withstand the pressure.  

Suddenly, he channeled all his vital essence toward the Danzhong acupoint like a raging river, smashing through the barrier in one go and opening his dantian. His essence gathered like countless streams returning to the sea, forming a swirling vortex.  

True qi!  

Opening the middle dantian and cultivating true qi marked his ascension to a Postnatal martial artist.  

True qi could externally temper flesh, bones, and sinews, while internally regulating breath and healing injuries. With it, he could traverse the jianghu with ease—truly stepping onto the path of cultivation.  

Now that Lin Shan had reached the Qi-Transformation Realm and cultivated true qi, he could be considered a third-rate expert in the martial world!  

From here, he could further refine his internal energy to produce hidden force, then temper his organs to reach the Organ-Tempering Realm.  

Once hidden force reached perfection, he could transform it into refined force, imbuing his palms and blades with true qi, aligning his movements with the heavens and earth—the Refined Force Realm.  

After reaching Postnatal perfection, unblocking the Ren and Du meridians and opening the upper and lower dantians would lead to the Prenatal Realm. At that stage, true qi could be released externally, allowing him to kill with a flick of a finger—a completely different realm altogether.  

...  

Lin Shan didn't dwell on distant fantasies. First, he consolidated his new realm, steadily refining his qi and adjusting his breath.  

Two hours later, sensing his meridians were saturated, he slowly withdrew from cultivation, opened his eyes with a flash of sharp light, and exhaled a turbid breath.  

"Though I'm still some distance behind Lin Fan, now that I have my own cheat, his fortuitous encounters seem trivial in comparison. I'll catch up eventually."  

A decade of mediocrity after transmigrating had weighed heavily on him, but tonight reignited his confidence.  

"Enhancement... Ancient Aura... How do I find more?"  

Outside the window, the fifth watch approached—the moon bright, the stars sparse, and tree shadows swaying.  

With these thoughts, Lin Shan lay down and sank into deep slumber.
