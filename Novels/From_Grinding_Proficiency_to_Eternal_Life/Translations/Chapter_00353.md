# Chapter 353: Manifestation of the Dragon and Tiger Heavenly尊

Xu Yunfan flipped through the air, using his opponent's momentum against him. His robes fluttered like that of an immortal descending to the mortal realm, his expression carrying a hint of coldness.

This counterattack, turning the opponent's technique against them, was merely a rudimentary application of his Ten Extremities Martial Dao's principle of "borrowing force to transform energy."

The more vigorous the True Qi of the monk with the black scales boiling, the more terrifying the backlash. The monk from the Mituo Temple was now frozen with a purplish-blue face, clearly poisoned by the "Xuanming Cold Toxin" unique to the Penglai Pavilion.

"Everyone, do not hold back any longer, otherwise, this fiend will be impossible to control!"

The "Tianxuan Sword Master" from the Jiangnan Dao Sword Pavilion shouted sharply. Behind her, the sword case exploded, releasing seven streaks of flowing light that transformed into seven swords. They formed the Big Dipper Sword Formation and shot toward Xu Yunfan's back.

Xu Yunfan's eyes shifted slightly. His right hand remained pressed on the head of the purple-robed elder, striving to drain the last wisp of essence energy from the other's body, while his left hand suddenly changed technique. He raised his palm, and a thick wall of Ten Extremities True Qi formed a barrier.

The moment the sword light pierced the Qi barrier, it was like mud entering the sea. Instead, it was swallowed by the barrier and then spat back out as a sword Qi, piercing through the Tianxuan Sword Master's right shoulder.

The Sword Master stumbled backward, her face filled with disbelief.

This was clearly the technique of her "Yaoguang Breaking Army Sword" just now!

"I know both the 'Sanjiao Sword Nurturing Art' and the 'Kongming Sword Cleansing Technique.' I understand the origin of your sword technique at a single glance," Xu Yunfan said indifferently, though he felt a bit inwardly perplexed. Why did it seem like he was becoming more and more like a major villain the further things went?

The purple-robed elder was now as withered as dried wood. Xu Yunfan casually threw him toward the two rushing old eunuchs.

The two hurriedly retracted their attacks to catch their colleague, but they saw the purple-robed elder's body suddenly swell before exploding into a cloud of blood with a bang.

Xu Yunfan laughed heartily upon seeing this. He had long since planted a strand of violent True Qi within the other's Dantian.

The blood mist was mixed with fine strands of Ten Extremities True Qi as thin as cow hair. The two old eunuchs couldn't dodge in time, and their faces were eroded with countless bloody holes. They screamed in agony, covering their eyes.

These old eunuchs had trained in the deep palace their entire lives, yet they had fought very few times, let alone engaged in a battle of this level.

"Form the Three Talismans Formation!" the three old Taoists from the Xuanzhen Sect shouted in unison. They raised the long swords in their hands, and their vast True Qi burst forth.

The True Qi of the three intertwined in the air, transforming into the shapes of a dragon and a tiger. The ground gathered the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and a Bagua formation diagram suddenly appeared.

Within the formation, the roar of a dragon and a tiger echoed. On the left, a black True Qi condensed into a flood dragon; on the right, a white gold Gang Qi transformed into a fierce tiger. The combined force of the dragon and tiger strike aimed directly at Xu Yunfan's lower body.

Xu Yunfan sneered and actually stepped into the eye of the formation, facing the dragon and tiger True Qi head-on.

Just as the flood dragon's sharp claws were about to seize his ankle, the tip of his foot lightly tapped the ground, and he executed the "Flying Leg" movement technique.

This was originally a low-level martial art for traveling, but now, infused with his Ninth Realm Mixed Yuan True Qi, every step he took left a solid afterimage in the air.

The dragon and tiger's attacks tore through seven afterimages in succession but failed to grasp the real body. Meanwhile, Xu Yunfan's true body had already flashed behind the oldest Taoist of the Xuanzhen Sect. His hand blade, shrouded in Ten Extremities Qi, transformed into a heavy hammer and smashed fiercely toward the other's cervical vertebrae.

*Clang!*

The sound of metal colliding was deafening.

The Taoist's robe exploded, revealing the Xuan Tortoise Treasure Armor underneath.

"Another divine armor?" Xu Yunfan couldn't help but frown slightly upon seeing this.

These people from the six major sects treated divine weapons as if they were free, appearing one after another.

This protective treasure, refined using the secret methods of the Dragon and Tiger Sect, had its surface dragon patterns cracking inch by inch, but it bought a moment of respite.

The other two Taoists took the opportunity to change the formation. The dragon and tiger True Qi suddenly merged, transforming into three black chains that entangled Xu Yunfan's left arm. The demon-suppressing inscriptions appearing on the chains actually began to erode his protective Gang Qi.

The three female cultivators from the Penglai Pavilion immediately made their move upon seeing this.

The palm of their hands appeared with dark blue water patterns, and seventy-two "Weak Water Needles," carrying the Yin-dominant Zhou Tian True Qi, shot out violently.

Xu Yunfan did not dodge or evade, allowing the penetrating water needles to enter his chest.

Just as the Weak Water True Qi was about to break through his protective Qi barrier, the dragon scale armor on his chest flared with red light. The countless scales fluttered, and he actually opened his mouth to swallow all the toxins, spitting them back toward the monks of the Mituo Temple.

The three monks hastily activated their Golden Body Indestructible Divine Skill, but they saw the golden light of their protection being erded with honeycomb-like holes.

However, the extreme Yin True Qi of the Penglai Pavilion and the Gang Qi of the Buddhist sect mutually restrained each other, causing their skin to split and flesh to tear in an instant, unable to help but groan repeatedly.

Xu Yunfan felt somewhat helpless seeing this. None of these experts who had cultivated to the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining were fools. They basically all attacked from a distance with True Qi martial arts, having no intention of fighting him in close quarters at all.

They were afraid of being captured in an instant and having their True Qi sucked away.

"This fiend's True Qi is strange. Keep your distance!" the Tianxuan Sword Master warned sharply.

The Sword Pavilion disciples behind her immediately changed their formation upon hearing this. A hundred long swords trembled simultaneously, and with the Tianxuan Sword Master as the center, the sword force was transformed into sword Qi, condensing into an overwhelming river of sword Qi stars.

The metal-attributed armor-piercing sword Qi, the water-attributed soft sword intent, and the fire-attributed explosive sword light intertwined into a net.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. His figure moved like a swimming fish through the gaps. The Ten Extremities True Qi on his body circulated in a cycle, transforming the various Qi forms at will. The metal sword Qi turned into molten iron, the water sword intent was suppressed, and the fire sword light was directly absorbed!

At this time, among the three female cultivators from the Penglai Pavilion, a beautiful woman who seemed to be in charge suddenly crushed a crystal.

A light blue water curtain rose around Xu Yunfan, and thousands of ice crystals condensed in the air.

"The Penglai Supreme Skill, the Upper Good Like Water Realm?" Xu Yunfan felt his whole body sink as if trapped in a swamp.

Although it was called a supreme skill, it was actually formed by the accumulated Zhou Tian True Qi of the Penglai Pavilion's Nine Realm Qi Refining experts over the years, poured into the crystal in the beautiful woman's hand.

Those who entered felt as if they were in the deep sea, able to do nothing but be at others' mercy.

After such a long time, the True Qi accumulated in the crystal was already terrifyingly powerful.

"Truly a waste..." Xu Yunfan sighed.

The experts around saw that Xu Yunfan's movements were indeed sluggish. The old monk of the Mituo Temple, Ci, seized the opportunity, clasped his hands together, and offered thirty-six Sarira.

Driven by the Buddhist Vajra True Qi, the Sarira ignited with pure flames. This Buddhist karma fire, which specifically countered evil spirits, was about to engulf Xu Yunfan.

But then, Xu Yunfan's chest suddenly caved in, actually sucking the sky full of pure fire into his stomach!

The old monk was dumbfounded. Xu Yunfan opened his mouth and spewed out seven streams of golden-red fire.

The Buddhist pure fire was actually transformed by his "Transformation Derivation Strength" within the Ten Extremities True Qi into pure Yang True Qi, turning into pure Yang fierce fire, which in turn set the Sword Pavilion disciples' formation into chaos.

"Summon the Manifestation of the Dragon and Tiger Heavenly尊!" the Xuanzhen Sect old Taoist roared toward the sky, his voice carrying the determination to shatter jade and stone together. His emaciated fingers formed profound hand seals, and the Taoist robe around him moved without wind, flapping loudly.

As his words fell, a mass of dense purple Qi suddenly appeared between his eyebrows. The purple Qi writhed like a living creature, vaguely revealing the shapes of a dragon and a tiger entangled within.

*Pfft!*

The old Taoist suddenly spat out a mouthful of essence blood. The blood mist condensed in the air without dispersing, actually transforming into a blood talisman that merged into the purple Qi between his eyebrows.

In an instant, the purple Qi exploded, churning violently like boiling magma. The old Taoist's face distorted, and lines of blood seeped from his seven orifices, clearly enduring an unimaginable backlash force.

*Boom!*
