# Chapter 639: The Conception of the Star Spirit Banner

After instructing Lockman to remain still for the time being, Xu Yunfan cleared his thoughts regarding the forces of the Eternal Frost Royal Court.

He would lie low for a period and wait for an opportunity to stir up Aetira, creating a chance for himself to act.

The weak gods of the Western Wilds had vanished, while the Northern Wastes of Winter belonged to the natural divine system. The gods within it were all points on a web; acting rashly would easily expose him.

Therefore, he needed to make these stagnant waters turbulent.

The best method was to initiate a divine war.

Returning to the Cloud Kingdom of Frost Thunder City, Xu Yunfan immediately began to address some accumulated hidden dangers. After all, Frost Thunder City was currently his foundation. As long as he intended to use his identity as a cover, he naturally needed to manage it properly.

Although he had no use for this incense and faith power himself, it was quite excellent for nurturing magic treasures or directly using it as divine power through his divine spark to exercise his authority.

He summoned the Divine Thunder Refining World Cauldron and cast the Thunder鸣 Divine Spark into it.

The ancient, small cauldron's thunder patterns lit up, and the interior space transformed into a miniature thunder prison. Pure faith power turned into a milky white flame, wrapping around the divine spark to burn and refine it.

The deep blue crystal imprint flickered slightly under the attack of the thunder and fire, being covered and isolated by layers of purple-gold thunder patterns transformed from the faith power.

Simultaneously, the Star Spirit Banner cast down a dim light. The dozen or so weak god banner spirits within the banner exerted their powers, assisting in stabilizing the geothermal and water vapor of Frost Thunder City, maintaining the vitality of the oasis, and perfectly smoothing out the subtle fluctuations of the faith network.

Although these weak god divine sparks had been refined by Xu Yunfan, their own strength was still quite decent.

After all, to become a divine spirit, one must ignite a divine flame.

And igniting a divine flame, when compared to the system of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, meant that the other party should be at the Foundation Establishment Great Perfection stage.

Below Frost Thunder City, the barbarian High Priest Barutu stood on the central altar, presiding over a grand harvest festival.

Newly harvested ice moss wheat and hunted wild beasts were piled upon the altar.

He raised the bone staff inlaid with thunder patterns, chanting hymns to the "God of Thunder," his voice loud and devout.

However, beneath his lowered eyelids, a trace of doubt remained.

The divine oracle from several months ago required the promotion of "crop rotation" and "new-style livestock pens," which were completely different from the crude demands of Tathus, who previously only knew how to ask for blood sacrifices.

What made him even more uneasy was that in his perception, the aura of "Our God," while still vast and majestic, seemed to lack that familiar violence and instead possessed an indescribable sense of order?

Although this was a good thing, for the unrefined barbarians, it was still a bit hard to get used to.

Xu Yunfan, knowing this, would not pay it any mind regardless.

As a god, he naturally needed to have the mystery and dignity of a god, right?

He had to play his part to the fullest.

"High Priest Barutu."

A young priest leaned in and whispered, "The 'Steam Mill' in the East District has been built according to the divine oracle. Can those iron wheels that turn by themselves really grind wheat day and night?"

His tone was filled with awe and disbelief.

Barutu retracted his thoughts and said solemnly, "It is a divine miracle bestowed by Our God. Just do as commanded."

He looked up at the thunderclouds that never dissipated in the clouds, pressing his doubts even deeper.

No matter how the divine will changed, bringing abundance and stability was the supreme grace.

The prosperity of Frost Thunder City was visible and tangible.

Within the Cloud Kingdom, Xu Yunfan retracted his divine sense that was observing the world below.

"Barutu's doubts are deepening, but for now, there is no trouble. He values tangible benefits more."

This was also a form of entertainment for him amidst his cultivation. After all, it followed a nurturing path; in his previous life, he enjoyed playing Civilization VI from time to time.

It was quite fitting now.

He looked at Zhang Ziyang, who was seated and cultivating to the side.

"How is the Dao Master progressing in comprehending the Way of Incense and Faith?"

Before Zhang Ziyang floated a silver talisman formed from pure faith power, slowly rotating.

"It is incredibly profound."

Light flickered in his eyes as he seemed lost in thought.

"The power of incense and faith is essentially the aggregation of the thoughts, desires, and prayers of billions of believers. Tathus's previous method was to swallow it whole, only drawing upon the violent 'faith power' to support his divine might, yet allowing countless distracting thoughts and resentments to settle, eroding his sanity and ultimately making him paranoid and brutal.

"The Divine Thunder Refining World Cauldron, however, uses the power of thunder to break evil as fire, and the clouds of creation as the furnace, to repeatedly refine the mixed faith power, discarding the dross and keeping the essence, ultimately extracting the pure 'Origin of Divine Power.'

"This method cannot expand the scope of one's divine authority, but it can refine the origin and stabilize the foundation. More importantly..."

He pointed to the divine spark enveloped by thunder and fire within the cauldron. "The efficiency of condensing the Immortal Gold Nature with divine power refined by this method is more than ten times that of Tathus's crude method! At this pace, it will take about three years to condense a wisp of Immortal Gold Nature for you to refine."

It was a bit slow.

But Xu Yunfan wouldn't say it out loud.

If he said it was slow, and those cultivators from the Taihua Spirit Void Realm at the mid to late Foundation Establishment stage heard about it, they would probably fight him to the death.

Xu Yunfan nodded. The sixteen wisps of Immortal Gold Nature within him floated in his Dantian's Heavenly Cave, emanating a tenacious and immortal aura.

The three wisps of Gold Nature obtained from refining Tathus were far purer than what he had obtained before.

"The Heavenly Dao of Aetira is dominated by the Way of Incense and Faith. The faith spiritual power of the creatures in this world is the most efficient resource for condensing Immortal Gold Nature."

His gaze fell upon the Star Spirit Banner in his hand, where a dim light flowed, and a grander conception gradually became clear.

"If one day, there are billions of banner spirits within the Star Spirit Banner, and all of them become believers..."

Zhang Ziyang instantly understood, and a brilliant light erupted in his eyes.

"Banner spirits have no physical body to burden them, and their wills are pure. If billions of banner spirits chant the Lord's name day and night, the faith power generated will be like a galactic torrent.

"After being purified by the Divine Thunder Refining World Cauldron, the speed of condensing Immortal Gold Nature will be beyond imagination!"

But he immediately calmed down. "This method is feasible, but there are two key points.

"First, the Star Spirit Banner must be refined to the point where it can bear such a massive torrent of faith power; otherwise, the banner's body will surely shatter.

"Second, there must be a supreme scripture to dissolve and command the billions of thoughts, to avoid the backlash of faith power; otherwise, the Lord's consciousness might be assimilated."

"This is precisely what I must do next."

Xu Yunfan stroked the banner pole.

The addition of Tathus as a mid-tier god banner spirit had already improved the origin of the Star Spirit Banner by quite a bit.

He took out a World-Empty Stone from the Heavenly Realm ruins, carved with spatial array patterns, and several types of rare spiritual materials. He operated the "Xuandu Eight Scenes Refining World Creation Cloud Manual" once again.

Eight-colored cloud qi enveloped the materials, melting them in the divine fire. Strands of spatial power were stripped away and integrated into the banner pole.

Next, he would strengthen the internal spatial barriers of the Star Spirit Banner, laying the foundation for accommodating billions of banner spirit believers.

This matter could not be rushed; it needed to be approached slowly.

Time flowed silently amidst cultivation, artifact refining, and sorting out his faith.

With the green card identity of the Thunder鸣 Divine Spark, the排斥 of the Aetira world towards Xu Yunfan completely vanished.

The spiritual energy of heaven and earth actively gathered towards him. When using the "Xuandu Eight Scenes Refining World Creation Cloud Manual," it became even smoother, and the connection between his divine sense and the heavens and earth grew clearer.

He could even faintly perceive the Winter Laws that shrouded the entire Northern Wastes, like an invisible giant web, and his Thunder鸣 Divine Spark was a crucial node within this web.
