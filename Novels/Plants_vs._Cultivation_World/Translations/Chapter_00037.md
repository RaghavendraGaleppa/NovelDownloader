# Chapter 37: Full Cultivation Effort

Being specifically targeted by an unknown dark cultivator was certainly not good news, but it also allowed Gu Mo to breathe a slight sigh of relief. Since the other party wanted to nurture him, they likely wouldn't make a move against him in the short term. This gave Gu Mo a stable period for growth.

In the future, once Gu Mo's strength increased, he wouldn't need to fear that dark cultivator anymore. With the acquisition of the Breath Concealment Technique, Gu Mo could now proceed with his cultivation plan. By devoting himself fully to cultivation, his progress would surpass even those with superior spiritual roots.

Two days later.

After visiting all the outer sect disciples in the area, Gu Mo bid farewell to Mai Yunfa and returned alone to the Spirit Plant Hall. Mai Yunfa would remain behind to wait for those outer sect disciples who wished to join the Spirit Plant Hall, transporting them back once they reached the Qi Refining stage.

Returning to his cottage in the spirit fields, the illusion formation surrounding it gave Gu Mo a slight sense of security. Once Chu Feifei repaired the formation disk, the combined illusion and defensive formations, along with the Peashooters in the spirit fields, would make it much harder for that unknown dark cultivator to enter his room undetected.

Calming his emotions, Gu Mo replanted the Sunflowers and Peashooters from the black mist space back into the spirit fields. Then, he began a new round of Spirit Jade Rice cultivation.

Logically, having obtained the Breath Concealment Technique and with his pressure significantly reduced, Gu Mo could have attempted to cultivate higher-grade spirit plants. However, he had already collected Spirit Jade Rice seeds before leaving the Spirit Plant Hall, so he had no choice but to plant another season of Spirit Jade Rice.

During this period, Gu Mo planned to increase the number of Sunflowers to ten and master the basics of the Breath Concealment Technique before fully devoting himself to cultivation.

Planting Spirit Jade Rice was now second nature to Gu Mo, who had mastered all five Spirit Farmer spells. Within a few hours, the planting was complete, leaving only daily maintenance.

With the illusion formation and Peashooters, Gu Mo didn't need to worry about pests or rodents sneaking in to nibble on the rice. He only needed to cast the Minor Cloud Rain Technique on the fields each day, leaving the rest of his time free to study the Breath Concealment Technique.

Having already grasped the principles of the technique, Gu Mo progressed rapidly. In about a month and a half, he had mastered the basics of the Breath Concealment Technique.

Activating the technique, Gu Mo's spiritual energy fluctuations quickly faded, and his presence became almost imperceptible. "Good, this should be enough to evade detection from cultivators below the Foundation Establishment stage," Gu Mo nodded in satisfaction.

The Breath Concealment Technique was superior to the Hidden Qi Art not only because it concealed one's presence but also because it was far more effective at hiding one's cultivation level. At the basic level, it could prevent detection from cultivators within the same major realm, while mastery would shield against those a full major realm above.

In comparison, the Hidden Qi Art only achieved similar effects to the Breath Concealment Technique's mastery level when fully perfected.

As for the effects of the Breath Concealment Technique at its highest level, Gu Mo didn't know—the version he obtained was incomplete and could only be cultivated to the mastery level. This was understandable, as the Breath Concealment Technique wasn't some cheap secret art; no one would hand over the complete version.

For Gu Mo, mastering the technique to the proficient level was sufficient. As long as he could conceal himself from peers and those one realm above, that was enough. Against higher-level cultivators, concealment would be meaningless anyway.

His rapid progress might draw attention from Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, making them suspect he had obtained some fortuitous encounter. But to Golden Core stage experts, such progress might be insignificant.

What low-level cultivators considered treasures might be worthless in the eyes of higher-level ones.

During the time Gu Mo spent mastering the basics of the Breath Concealment Technique, the number of Sunflowers in his spirit fields had also increased to ten. Originally, he had five Sunflowers, so it only took ten days to gather enough solar essence for the sixth. The seventh took even less time, and the intervals grew progressively shorter. By the tenth Sunflower, he needed only a little over five days to accumulate the required solar essence.

Now, Gu Mo harvested ten portions of solar essence daily. However, since the Breath Concealment Technique was only at the basic level, he couldn't yet cultivate without restraint.

Thus, he stored the daily solar essence harvest in the black mist space. If left outside, solar essence would gradually dissipate, but it could be preserved for long periods within the black mist space.

"Then, I'll work on reaching mastery in the Breath Concealment Technique as quickly as possible."

Taking a deep breath, Gu Mo immersed himself once more in studying the technique. Having already deciphered its principles, he faced no bottlenecks in progressing to mastery—it was merely a matter of time.

With no need to cultivate and having paused his study of Spirit Farmer spells, Gu Mo devoted all his time to the Breath Concealment Technique, greatly accelerating his progress.

Time passed, and as his third season of Spirit Jade Rice neared maturity, Gu Mo slowly opened his eyes. At this moment, his presence was completely undetectable—he seemed like an ordinary mortal.

"Finally reached mastery."

Exhaling deeply, Gu Mo reflected that this was the first time he had devoted himself so completely to mastering a technique. Fortunately, the results satisfied him. From obtaining the Breath Concealment Technique to reaching mastery had taken only one season of Spirit Jade Rice cultivation. If word got out, it would surely shock countless people.

The Breath Concealment Technique wasn't some low-tier spell—it was a secret art far more difficult to master than ordinary techniques. Many would take years just to grasp the basics, let alone reach mastery, which would typically require over a decade of effort.

This estimation was based on a cultivator with average spiritual roots and comprehension. For an outer sect disciple, mastering the basics might take decades, and those with poorer comprehension might never succeed at all.

But Gu Mo, relying on knowledge from another world, had successfully analyzed the technique's principles, allowing him to reach mastery in just one season.

"Now, let's experience what full cultivation feels like." With the Breath Concealment Technique at mastery, Gu Mo could cultivate without restraint.

Immediately, he took out ten portions of solar essence and absorbed them. One portion was equivalent to three days of hard cultivation, so ten portions equaled a month's worth of progress.

The accumulated cultivation power surged through his meridians in an instant, carrying the essence of the sun. Without hesitation, Gu Mo guided the energy to begin expanding his second minor energy cycle.

The surging spiritual energy tore through the meridian blockages effortlessly, but when the second minor cycle was about a third complete, the flow began to weaken.

Seeing this, Gu Mo absorbed another ten portions of solar essence. The surging energy returned in an instant, helping him rapidly expand his meridians.

Clearly, Gu Mo intended to push forward in one go and break through to the second level of Qi Refining. He had remained at the first level for far too long.

"Boom!"

When Gu Mo absorbed a third set of ten solar essence portions, the second minor energy cycle was fully opened, marking his official breakthrough to the second level of Qi Refining.
