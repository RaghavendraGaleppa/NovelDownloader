# Chapter 83: A Trip to the Alchemy Hall

The Long-tailed Wolf King narrowed his eyes, his gaze flashing with dangerous green light in the darkness. "Those fellows aren't easy to trick. If they knew about the ruins, there'd probably be nothing left for us."

"But we have no other choice. As for the ruins, won't it be fine if we don't let them know about it beforehand?"

The One-eyed Wolf King said, "We haven't paid much attention to the sect domain these past years. Who would have thought these human cultivators would develop so quickly? After this battle, I imagine other dangerous entities in the Huaqing Realm have also seen the threat of this sect domain. Do you know what the cultivators in the sect domain call us?"

"Demonic cultivators?"

"Precisely!" The One-eyed Wolf King nodded. "They are a very peculiar group of human cultivators. I imagine the other fellows certainly don't want to see this sect domain grow stronger. Since they call us demonic cultivators, we can start with the weakest among them and form an alliance of demonic cultivators to collectively deal with the sect domain. After all, among all cultivators outside the sect domain, probably few don't covet these human cultivators."

"Actually, I also thought about cooperating with the human cultivators in this sect domain before, but given their attitude towards us 'demonic cultivators,' it's almost impossible. If we want to obtain the ruins, we can only eradicate them!"

"However, regarding the ruins, no one is allowed to speak of it until the very last moment!"

However, the overall situation remained unchanged.

To cause sufficient trouble for the sect domain, the wolf cultivators had already decided to deploy all their prepared poisons within a short period. Previously, these poisons only targeted inner disciples, but now even outer disciples were not spared. The sect domain, naturally, was unaware of the wolf cultivators' intentions. Therefore, they had to be fully prepared, and the demand for Meridian Opening Pills was greater than ever!

...

Ding Rui had been much more at leisure recently. This was because other cultivators had gradually begun to master the techniques for processing Meridian Opening Flowers. Meridian Opening Flower pollen was no longer in short supply. However, due to the wolf cultivators' continued fierce assault with poisoned pills, the supply of Meridian Opening Pills was somewhat insufficient. After all, Meridian Opening Pills required a significant amount of time to refine, and the number of cultivators in the sect domain's Alchemy Hall was limited. Furthermore, the success rate of alchemy was also an issue. Thus, the quantity of Meridian Opening Pills had become another pressing issue that needed to be resolved. However, the sect domain had no good way to solve it.

A moment later, he shook his head helplessly and turned, heading straight for the Alchemy Hall. The Alchemy Hall was an area only slightly smaller than the Spirit Field district. All Alchemy Hall disciples gathered here, with inner and outer disciples divided into two separate sections. If other sect cultivators wanted to find an Alchemy Hall disciple to teach them alchemy, they could generally only approach those outer disciples whose talents were not particularly outstanding. This was because only these disciples had sufficient time, while other more exceptional disciples had to dedicate their time to honing their alchemy techniques. As for inner disciples, it was even less likely. Every single inner disciple held an important position, and most of the sect's pills were refined by them; they simply didn't have much time to spare. Moreover, ordinary cultivators couldn't afford an inner disciple's "appearance fee."

Ding Rui walked along the main street of the Alchemy Hall district, feeling conflicted. "Should I just find any outer senior brother who seems suitable, or should I seek out an elite outer disciple to teach me?" He mused, "With Senior Brother Jiang She's word, no outer disciple should refuse to teach me, but they still have their own matters to attend to, so they might not truly be willing deep down."

Just as Ding Rui was deliberating, a voice suddenly rang out from afar.
