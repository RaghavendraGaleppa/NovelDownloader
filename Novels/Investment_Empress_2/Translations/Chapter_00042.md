# Chapter 42: Entering the Divine Weapon Cave to Choose a Weapon, Facing the Crimson Sky Sword Once More

Outside the carriage window, the beautiful scenery of the Qingyuan Mountains flowed backward.

"I can finally call myself a swordsman," Li Mo muttered.

"From Great Completion to Great Perfection."

"Eighty years..."

The initial excitement of the young Master Li had faded by half, and he began to worry if the cost had been too high.

Counting it up, he had spent a total of over a hundred years of martial arts comprehension on swordsmanship.

If it weren't for Bing Dangzi teaching him personally, he would have spent even more.

It felt a lot like spending two months' salary on a high-end gaming PC in his previous life, only to let it gather dust because he had no time to play.

Well, it wasn't quite that bad.

Great Perfection swordsmanship was definitely much more powerful than just smashing things with his fists.

"I should have enough Martial Dao comprehension for now."

"I still have one hundred and ten years left, so I won't be helpless even if I acquire a new martial art."

After a quick calculation, Li Mo stopped thinking about it.

"If you enter the Divine Weapon Cave, you should take a look at that Crimson Sky Sword," Ying Bing said softly, taking a sip of tea.

"Alright," Li Mo agreed readily.

In fact, he was indeed planning to try his hand at the Crimson Sky Sword.

It wasn't about holding a grudge or seeking revenge for being beaten by a sword. It was just that the Crimson Sky Sword was fire-attributed, and when paired with the Fire Heart Lotus Method, its power would multiply, making it extremely suitable for him.

This boost might not be very obvious at the Blood Qi Realm, but after reaching the Internal Breath Realm, it would definitely be visible to the naked eye.

At this moment, the sound of hammering iron could already be heard from outside the window.

Stepping down from the carriage, they saw a crowd of people gathered in front of the Divine Weapon Cave.

As soon as Bing Dangzi appeared, the sound of discussion in the field diminished significantly, and various gazes of awe were cast toward her. The oppressive aura of the Ice Cube was palpable.

She was not only the Sect Leader's direct disciple but also the future of the sect. Not only was she peerless among her generation, but in the entire history of the Qingyuan Sect, she was uniquely dazzling.

"Brother Li!"

"Junior Brother Li!"

Two voices called out from the crowd simultaneously, then looked at each other in surprise.

Xiao Qin and Mu Rongxiao looked at each other and nodded slightly. They had both achieved good results in the sect trial and were acquainted.

"Brother Li, you actually took first place. As expected of you," Mu Rongxiao praised.

"I was shocked when I found out," Xiao Qin added.

Xiao Qin's aura was much stronger than before. Through the trial, he had returned to the inner sect. What surprised him was that Junior Brother Li's aura was now even stronger than his own. And he had the help of a teacher to restart his cultivation. Junior Brother Li's progress was truly astonishing.

"Junior Brother Li, what kind of weapon are you planning to take today?" Mu Rongxiao asked. "My swordsmanship has improved a bit recently."

"Hmm, it shouldn't be a problem for Junior Brother Li to take a famous weapon," Xiao Qin agreed.

"That's because you don't know Brother Li well enough..." Mu Rongxiao trailed off.

They chatted for a moment, mostly about recent events. Mu Rongxiao's body refinement had reached an initial success, meeting Elder Han He's expectations, and he could now start learning the casting techniques unique to the Divine Weapon Peak. As for Xiao Qin, not only had he returned to the inner sect, but he had also been noticed by an elder and might be accepted as a direct disciple in the future.

Everyone had a bright future.

Watching the people he had invested in flourish, Young Master Li couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment.

*Ding, ding, ding—*

Suddenly, a gong sounded at the entrance of the Divine Weapon Cave.

The inner sect steward guarding the cave entrance stepped out. "Time is up!"

The Divine Weapon Cave would briefly become gentle each year before surging even more violently. Disciples with lower cultivation would usually choose to enter the cave to select their weapons at this time.

The disciples subconsciously made way.

Ying Bing walked into the Divine Weapon Cave with her eyes lowered. However, she stopped in the middle of the first layer and gently raised her fair hand.

Just as everyone was confused...

*Zing—*

A sword cry rang out, and more than a dozen white streaks of light flew through the air, stopping in front of Ying Bing for her to choose from. They were all famous-grade longswords.

*Ugh...*

How should he put it? Li Mo watched this with the feeling of a cat lover entering a cat café. He wasn't particularly surprised, but the others were far from calm. A wave of exclamations erupted.

"Famous weapons! They're all Famous Weapons!"

"Heavens, getting the recognition of a Famous Weapon is one thing, but having them all fly out from the third layer for you to choose from?"

"I thought Famous Weapons had spirits and were aloof? Ordinary people can't even get a glance, why are they all flocking together today?"

"This is terrifying..."

"Wait, look, what is that?"

As the discussion buzzed, two more streaks of light, one blue and one white, shot over. The other Famous Weapons all moved aside. One was scorching and domineering, the other was as cold as frost.

To Li Mo, they were both old acquaintances.

Crimson Sky and Frost.

Everyone felt as if they were about to stop breathing. Even in their wildest dreams, they wouldn't dare to imagine such a scene. Even the disciples of the Divine Weapon Peak couldn't help but feel a toothache. Many of them had been disciples for years but had only heard of the two玄器 (Mystic-grade) longswords forged by the founding master of the Divine Weapon Peak; they had never even seen them.

How did she recognize them?

Among the existing Mystic-grade weapons on the Divine Weapon Peak, only two are swords.

"Frost," Ying Bing reached out and grasped the white,蛟龙-like longsword. It was still that familiar feeling. The Frost Sword trembled slightly, appearing extremely joyful.

Then, Ying Bing didn't look at the other swords anymore and walked out with the sword in her arms. As she passed Li Mo, she nodded slightly, offering a bit of encouragement.

Li Mo: "...... That was over way too fast."

When he looked again, the Crimson Sky Sword was already gone.

Well, it seems I have to take the ordinary path and face the trial of the Crimson Sky Sword.

"Brother Li, I believe you can definitely get a Mystic-grade weapon too," Mu Rongxiao patted his shoulder.

"Mm," Xiao Qin also nodded in agreement.

"Let's go then," Li Mo smiled and took a step.

Right.

At the bottom of the Divine Weapon Cave, there was a hammer calling out to him. That feeling of summons was still there today. If he could only take one weapon, should he take the hammer or the sword?

Li Mo only hesitated for three and a third seconds before choosing the hammer.

Just kidding, that's the father of all Mystic-grade weapons.

Of course, if he wanted to take it and could lift it, Elder Han He might not agree. That hammer was the lifeblood of the Divine Weapon Peak...

"I'll go take a look first," Li Mo thought as the three of them descended to the third layer of the Divine Weapon Cave.

"Master said that to judge the quality of a weapon, you must look at its material, forging technique, control of heat..." Mu Rongxiao began to identify the weapons one by one according to Xue Lai's knowledge of casting.

Xiao Qin's gaze also swept over the Famous Weapons. At this moment, the voice of the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign sounded in his mind again.

"That girl named Ying Bing, just as I said, has great fortune accompanying her."

"Teacher, you mean her recognition of the Mystic-grade weapon?" Xiao Qin asked casually.

"To be her weapon is actually the fortune of that Mystic-grade weapon," the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign was amused by his disciple's perspective. He sighed, "What I am talking about is the inheritance she obtained."

"Inheritance? You mean the multicolored light from a few days ago?" Xiao Qin asked, quite curious.

A few days ago, there was a multicolored light stretching for thousands of miles, and there were many rumors within the sect. One theory was that the Sect Leader's direct disciple, Ying Bing, had obtained an extremely powerful inheritance. Now it seemed that was probably correct. What his teacher said had never been wrong so far.

"Yes, I saw it in an ancient book of the bird clans," the elderly voice did not deny it.

"Is that inheritance very powerful?"

"Merely powerful?" The Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign's tone carried a hint of reminiscence. "The Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix has nine souls, each with infinite mysteries. One who obtains even one can dominate the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. If all are collected, combined with that girl's Ten Extremes Physique, she would have a chance to reach that legendary realm..."

"Legendary realm?" Xiao Qin was confused and shook his head. "I still think Junior Brother Li is not bad. His future achievements definitely won't be weaker than Senior Sister Ying Bing's."

"You kid... How about making a bet with me?" The Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign laughed dryly. His disciple was good in every aspect, but he was a bit too stubborn. Practicing martial arts requires perseverance, but being too stubborn is also bad. It's easy to be like a frog in a well, knowing nothing.

"Sure, Teacher. What's the bet?"

"In the sect competition, if your Junior Brother Li can take ten moves from that girl, I lose. In that case, I'll give you a big gift. If I win... we'll talk about it then," the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign said with great interest, not at all thinking he would lose.

Xiao Qin naturally agreed. Then, under his teacher's guidance, he began to select his weapon.

...

As for this, Young Master Li was completely unaware.

If he knew, he would definitely ask: "Old Xiao, where does your blind faith in me come from?"

He had already walked to the fourth layer, his gaze fixed seriously on the Crimson Sky Sword, and he bowed to it.

*Hum—*

The Crimson Sky Sword trembled slightly, just like last time. Of course, the frequency of vibration was much lower than when it flew to Ying Bing's side. It seemed to think Li Mo wasn't as fragrant.

"Hmph, hmph."

"Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river!" Li Mo muttered to himself, a small flame of competitive fire burning in his eyes.

"I must conquer it today!"
