# Chapter 232: A Shift in Attitude, Turning the Tables

In the wild forest, branches and leaves were lush and dense. Dappled light filtered through the canopy, and a stream flowed gently beside them. The two by the stream had been silent for a long while, their circumstances and attitudes having completely changed.

Wen Caishang was quite uncomfortable. With her Ancestral Silkworm taken, she had nothing left to hold back, and her heart felt as if being scratched by a cat. Li Xian helped Wen Caishang up and said with a smile, "Madam, you are truly reasonable. I admire you."

Wen Caishang scolded, "You wicked servant." She was very indignant, her expression one of嗔怨, yet it carried a myriad of charms. She said, "You only know how to bully me. I can't even move now, and I don't know how much more humiliation I'll have to suffer from you."

Li Xian said, "With your beauty, Madam, I would protect you at all costs. How could I bear to bully you?" Though he said this, he was still audacious and frolicked with Wen Caishang for a while.

Their relationship had quietly been restructured. Wen Caishang said with both anger and shyness, "You bastard, you're so bad!" She glared at him fiercely.

She then thought of her many misfortunes and encounters. In the end... she hadn't fallen into the hands of her enemies, but had first been defeated by this youth. Her past glory had turned into a moment of embarrassment, and she couldn't save face.

Li Xian said, "Madam, let me clean your wounds first." He helped Wen Caishang to the side of the stream and removed her white dress.

Wen Caishang's face flushed with shyness. Her mood changed with the situation. Seeing Li Xian carefully and meticulously cleaning her wounds, his appearance handsome and elegant, she was deeply moved. "What Li Xian said is right. He doesn't owe me anything; it was mostly me who schemed against him."

Wen Caishang had four wounds: her shoulders were red and purple, and there were bloody marks on her left leg and right arm. Ordinary external injuries healed very quickly and were gradually showing signs of recovery. However, internal injuries remained in her body, difficult to expel.

Li Xian carefully and gently cleaned, washing away the filth and bloodstains from the wounds. He helped Wen Caishang put on her clothes and looked around... Seeing a vine hanging from a tree, he grabbed it, twisting and rubbing it left and right to soften it.

He carried Wen Caishang on his back and wrapped the vine around his waist. He bounced up and down a few times and said, "Madam, is it tight?" Wen Caishang nodded, "You have quite a few clever ideas."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Madam, have you forgotten? I'm from a hunter family. It's just..."

"Just what?" Wen Caishang asked.

Li Xian said mysteriously, "Just... forget it. It's better not to say."

"You!" Wen Caishang嗔道, "Speak quickly."

Li Xian said, "Do you really want me to say it?" Wen Caishang said angrily, "I order you to speak, you wicked servant."

Li Xian said, "Since Madam says I'm a wicked servant, then I am a wicked servant. Since I'm a wicked servant... I naturally won't obey orders."

Wen Caishang gritted her teeth, so angry she couldn't stand it. This guy was showing his true nature and really deserved to be taught a lesson. Li Xian said, "Unless..."

"Unless what?" Wen Caishang asked. Li Xian said, "Madam always used to stab me with a sword as punishment. Now... since you can't stab me, use your mouth to kiss me, and then I'll tell you."

He was naturally unrestrained and free-spirited, and thus also lawless. He said it casually, not really meaning it, and continued walking with his head down.

Wen Caishang's pretty face turned red. In the past, she had regarded Li Xian as her own possession, and kissing and hugging him had been habitual. But this "offering a kiss" was different. Wen Caishang's thoughts surged. She couldn't say whether she was willing or not, but suddenly thought, "There are pursuers behind us. Perhaps Li Xian and I will ultimately have difficulty escaping this calamity. Why think too much?"

So she kissed his cheek and said shyly, "What were you going to say just now? Speak quickly. I've kissed you, and if you still don't speak, I'll definitely bite your ear!"

Li Xian was taken aback, suddenly feeling that although Wen Caishang no longer had her past imposing and composed demeanor of rewarding and punishing clearly, she was much more vivid and lively. Li Xian smiled and said, "Then I'll speak."

"Madam, have you noticed that with me tying you like this, whether climbing slopes or going down pits, it's very stable. I haven't thrown you off."

The mountain was pathless, overgrown with weeds and sundries, with many strange rocks and pits. Every step was extremely strenuous. Wen Caishang said curiously, "That's true."

Li Xian said, "Of course. Because... when I used to go into the mountains to hunt, tigers were extremely fierce. The wooden arrows I carved myself sometimes had deviated angles and couldn't even pierce tiger skin."

Wen Caishang listened intently, "And then?"

Li Xian said, "So, unless I was short on money, I wouldn't risk shooting tigers. Nine times out of ten when I entered the mountains, I was shooting wild boars. Wild boars are smelly, very cunning, and their skin is quite thick."

"But there are many of them. Generally... when I went aiming for wild boars, I almost never returned empty-handed."

Wen Caishang said, "That's true. During the熊虎山 hunt, wild boars were everywhere. I couldn't be bothered to shoot them."

Li Xian said, "When we mountain hunters hunt, we don't have meat bags. Every time I shot a wild boar, I could only carry it on my back. But wild boars are heavy, so how to carry them?"

"I saw my father carrying them with great difficulty, and when encountering bumpy and muddy roads, they would always easily fall to the ground. So I thought of a method, using local materials, pulling vines from the mountain forests."

"First, soften it three times to the left, seven times to the right... slowly, the vine becomes soft. Then I use the vine to tie around my waist, pass it through the wild boar's legs, wrap it around the wild boar's waist, and finally tighten it..."

"Hehe, no matter how I jump around, the wild boar is firmly on my back, unable to be shaken off."

"You're quite clever." Wen Caishang nodded, then suddenly froze and scolded, "Alright, you took such a big detour to compare me to a wild boar!"

"Hahaha." Li Xian laughed.

Wen Caishang was extremely annoyed, "I'll bite your ear." She stretched her head to bite. Li Xian felt pain and, while climbing the mountain, shouted, "Have mercy, Madam, have mercy."

"You're too hateful, I can't let you off lightly." Wen Caishang嗔道, "How dare you compare me to a wild boar, hmph!" But after a moment of anger, upon careful reflection, she felt that this experience was something she had never had before.

A faint feeling of sweetness arose in her heart.

Wen Caishang嗔骂道, "I've never seen which hunter family produced a bad thing like you."

Li Xian said, "You've seen it now?"

Wen Caishang said with a myriad of charms, "Not only have I seen it, but I've also been bullied by him."

"Who! Who dares to bully Madam? I, Li Xian, will be the first to fight him to the death." Li Xian said righteously.

"The thief cries 'stop thief,' not honest at all." Wen Caishang scolded with a smile.

Li Xian was free-spirited and unrestrained, his words interesting. Amidst finding joy in hardship, he actually made Wen Caishang completely forget their predicament. The two walked through the mountain wilderness, with no one around, their conversation even better than before.

At night.

After traveling for a long time, Li Xian finally saw a decent cave. The cave was dark inside, but the wind and water flowed through. There were natural stone benches, very suitable for resting.

Li Xian said, "The wild boar is coming down." He untied the vine and put Wen Caishang down. Wen Caishang said angrily, "You still dare to tease me!" She bit Li Xian's shoulder, but didn't use much force.

There was a stone bench in the cave. Wen Caishang sat on it, leaning against the stone wall, barely able to sit up.

Li Xian made a fire and roasted meat, the aroma wafting through the air. Wen Caishang asked, "You stinky wicked servant, have you thought of a way to escape?"

Li Xian shook his head and said, "Not yet, but I will never leave you alone."

"Easy to say." Under the firelight, it was unclear whether it was the fire's redness or her face's, but Wen Caishang looked quite beautiful.

Wen Caishang asked, "Then what are your plans next?"

Li Xian said, "The world is vast, there's always a place to go." He took out a map and examined the terrain. Seeing that they had reached the edge of the map, he said, "Before escaping, we need to understand the terrain. Right now... we need to get a new map."

"To get a map, we need to enter the city. The city is full of spies, it won't be easy." Wen Caishang said with a frown.

Li Xian said, "Let's take it as it comes!" At this point, they both felt heavy-hearted, knowing they were in great danger, and whether they could escape was entirely unpredictable.

Li Xian roasted rabbit meat, shredded it, and fed it to Wen Caishang. Wen Caishang's eyes rippled, and she suddenly asked, "Li Xian, if you die because of this, will you resent me?"

Li Xian smiled and said, "Madam, why are you so sorrowful now?"

"Hmph." Wen Caishang turned her head away. She had always been strong, treating people and things with toughness and fierceness. Combined with her high martial prowess, her true nature had never been revealed. Now that she had no strength, she felt helpless, and instead returned to her true nature, her thoughts becoming more and more numerous.

After eating and drinking their fill. Li Xian helped Wen Caishang lie down. Wen Caishang was hit by the "Fixed Marrow Finger," her bones solidified and tendons knotted, making it difficult to move. Although she knew the method to undo the finger, her internal qi was completely empty.

For martial artists, internal qi could slowly recover and gradually grow with timely rest and nutrient replenishment. But the "Qi-Eating Gu" was entrenched in her qi lake, constantly sucking. Therefore, Wen Caishang's qi lake was empty and could not be replenished.

She had profound martial principles. Since the right path was difficult, she changed to a side path. She had Li Xian lay her down and applied techniques on her back, using qi to massage, activate bones, and relax tendons.

It was indeed effective. After a busy hour, Wen Caishang could move her fingers. She predicted, "If we continue like this, in a few more days, I'll be able to walk without hindrance."

"Persist in daily massage, and I may even be able to perform sword techniques. But a side path is ultimately a side path. The Fixed Marrow Finger's force is difficult to completely resolve, and my strength will always be difficult to recover."

At least they could see the dawn.

The sky darkened. Li Xian gently patted Wen Caishang's back, letting her sleep peacefully. He then practiced his legs in the cave, never slacking off.

[Through countless dangers and obstacles, my heart is steadfast. Ethereal Leg proficiency +26]

[Even if the sky falls and the earth splits, I remain composed. Ethereal Leg proficiency +28]

Li Xian's Waning Sun Waning Blood Sword's first and second layers were approaching perfection. However, the urgent matter was to enhance leg strength and speed. Therefore, he focused on practicing the Ethereal Leg.

Every kick he made showed progress.

[Ethereal Leg]

[Proficiency: 13598/20000 Perfection]

The slanting moon shone into the cave.

Wen Caishang suddenly said, "In the world of martial arts, some leg techniques can enhance foot strength, but ultimately they can't compare to 'Lightness Skills'."

"I have many lightness skills, and their quality is not bad. But unfortunately, I can't move. I can only guide you with words. Are you willing to listen?"

Li Xian said happily, "Please speak, Madam."

Wen Caishang娇骂道 with a thousand charms, "Now you're respectful again? Hmph, I was originally going to teach you directly, but now you annoy me. You have to serve me until my anger subsides, then I'll teach you."

As soon as she said this, she couldn't help but be taken aback. When had she ever spoken in such a tone?

Li Xian said jokingly, "Madam, rest assured." He pounded her back, kneaded her shoulders, and pinched her legs. He said all sorts of pleasing words, making people feel elated.

Wen Caishang sighed and said, "Ah, I've really been deceived by you. Look at you now, where is there any trace of how you were in the manor? You're bold enough to bully your master."

"Alright, I'll teach you this lightness skill. I'll say it, and you listen. How much you can pick up depends on your comprehension."

"First go outside and see if there are any stars."

Li Xian said, "There are."

Wen Caishang said, "Good, then I'll teach you the Seven Stars Step, a rare lightness skill that can be quickly mastered. The so-called Seven Stars Step corresponds to the 'Big Dipper' in the sky, which are: Celestial Pivot, Celestial璇, Celestial玑, Celestial权, Jade衡, Open阳, and Jade Light."

"Go outside and find a place where you can see the stars, and practice according to what I say. If you can get started in one night, combining it with your quite good Clear Wind Leg and Ethereal Leg... your speed can reach a higher level."
