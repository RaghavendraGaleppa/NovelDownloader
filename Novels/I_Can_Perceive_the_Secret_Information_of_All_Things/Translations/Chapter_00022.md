# Chapter 22: The Immortal Sect's Internal Strife

Before setting off, Xiao Ji purchased ample daily necessities and stocked up on food supplies. At the very least, he needed to ensure Yingxiao had fully mastered the art of ordering takeout—he couldn't let his master starve to death.

The day before departure, he reviewed his guide to the Ancient City five more times, checked his spirit stones seven times, and reminded Yingxiao to take care of their master twelve times before feeling somewhat at ease.

That same day, the entire Lu family from Willow Town visited. The couple brought their prodigious son to the Primordial Temple to burn incense and donated a considerable sum of silver. The child, Lu Zha—a natural-born Dao Seed who had mastered grappling and throat-locking techniques while still in the womb—even kowtowed three times to Xiao Ji.

The reason? The boy was leaving town to cultivate at a major sect called the Demon Subjugation Sect, where he had received a full scholarship, free room and board, and special admission. Xiao Ji expressed his approval and offered sincere blessings.

Initially, Lu Jinyin had wanted his son to become a disciple of the Primordial Temple under Xiao Ji's guidance. Xiao Ji had also thought having a natural-born Dao Seed in the temple would be beneficial—until his ability revealed: [This child will be ruined if left in the hands of the Primordial Temple.] The conclusion was clear from the surface-level information.

Not wanting to lead the boy astray, Xiao Ji declined. Lu Zha joining a major sect was for the best. If he became a powerful figure—or even the sect leader—Xiao Ji would earn a title in the cultivation world: "The Midwife of the Demon Subjugation Sect's Leader Lu."

The journey began on a snowy morning, with thick flakes blanketing the sky and earth in white. Most people were still curled up in their warm beds. Xiao Ji wanted to share a few heartfelt words with his master and remind him of daily necessities. After all, in all his years of memory, he had never been apart from his master for more than twelve hours.

Yet his master wouldn't even open the door, merely lying on his cozy bed behind the wall and saying, "Bring back some local specialties from your trip." He couldn't even be bothered to open his eyes.

Xiao Ji encountered a minor setback when choosing an airship to the Ancient City, a hub for cultivators. His first stop was the official airship dock in Dragon Soar Prefecture, but his foresight revealed that the vessel would experience engine failure two days later. While not catastrophic, the delay would waste time and sour his mood. For his first trip to the Ancient City, he preferred smooth sailing.

In the end, he obtained a ticket for free from a scalper—by leveraging some compromising information he had uncovered about the man. The scalper handed it over cheerfully, claiming he simply wanted to make a friend.

The departure point was at the edge of Dragon Soar Prefecture—the Return to Immortality Sect's private route to the Ancient City. The downside was its many stops, making it non-direct. Still, it was the most convenient option outside official channels.

The sight of the airship left Xiao Ji awestruck. The vessel resembled a floating village suspended midair, with staggered buildings offering various services—dining halls and guest quarters divided into tiers, even dedicated cultivation spaces. Comfort came at a price, but as long as one had spirit stones—or silver—it was attainable.

These sky-faring ships were unique to this world, though their exorbitant construction and maintenance costs—requiring vast amounts of spirit stones and cultivators to operate—made them expensive. Yet demand remained high. The world was vast, and even Core Formation cultivators found artifact flight exhausting over long distances. For journeys beyond short hops, airships were the best option—saving energy for battles was a form of self-preservation.

Powerful sects, nations, and even famous landmarks built airships to boost their economies, often establishing new flight routes. The Return to Immortality Sect's vessel bore its name prominently on its sails and hull, along with a smiling portrait of its current leader, Grand Immortal Guiyun. The old man loved the spotlight—after hearing about other sects adopting symbolic emblems (swords, flames, hammers, scissors), he deliberated for three months before settling on his own likeness as the sect's representation. It was approved—those who objected were sentenced to three days of wall-facing meditation.

After boarding, Xiao Ji checked his room and began exploring. At the departure point, most passengers were cultivators, primarily Return to Immortality disciples on sect business. Sensing them often yielded cultivation insights, an opportunity Xiao Ji wouldn't miss.

As stops accumulated, more passengers boarded—mostly rogue cultivators. Seven days later, high above the clouds, the ship had long since left the borders of the Great Li Kingdom.

Most cultivators leaned against the deck railings, peering into the distance or below. But beyond the layers of clouds, the scenery was sparse—unless a spiritual storm forced the ship to descend, revealing the wilderness below. Otherwise, the view consisted of monotonous clouds and white light, much like an ocean's endless waves.

When female cultivators stepped onto the deck for fresh air, their fragrant presence often prompted inexperienced male cultivators to strike what they believed were dashing poses—awkward attempts to catch a fairy's eye. Many hoped for a fleeting romance, free from the concerns of spirit stones. Unfortunately, most of these delicate "fairies" were professionals—some feigning innocence, others exuding allure—all specializing in swindling emotions and spirit stones from unsuspecting men.

Seasoned cultivators knew better, stealing only a glance before recalling their own past mistakes.

Xiao Ji stood alone against the wind. Soon, two female cultivators in pale blue robes approached, appearing distressed. The one leading, adorned with a ruby clasp, gently touched his arm. "Kind sir—"

Before she could finish, Xiao Ji cut her off without turning. "Scram."

The pair retreated, dejected. Long before they neared, he had discerned their intentions—freeloaders seeking meals, drinks, and company.

Not long after, a rather rotund "fairy" waddled toward him. "Esteemed Daoist, your noble bearing and grace mark you as a man of great future accomplishments..."

The sight reminded Xiao Ji of a certain 298-coin experience from his past life. His expression darkened—but before he could speak, Return to Immortality disciples suddenly appeared.

One pointed at the plump fairy and declared, "She's the murderer!"

Panicked, the woman protested her innocence.

"Junior Brother Lingkong was a rare genius in our sect, highly regarded by our master and elders. This was his first mission—only to meet such a tragic end," a middle-aged cultivator said, stepping forward. "Confess now, and spare yourself suffering."

"Before his death, this woman was the last person to interact with Junior Brother Lingkong. I can testify to that," added a short disciple with long nose hairs and a swarthy complexion.

---

Xiao Ji's gaze swept over the crowd before settling on the plump fairy's innocent-looking nape.

"This witch killed Junior Brother Lingkong and immediately sought out this Daoist—they must be accomplices!" The short disciple's accusation sounded more like a frame-up.

Unamused, Xiao Ji glared at the diminutive cultivator and sneered, "Why drag outsiders into your sect's internal strife?"
