# Chapter 389: True Martial Devouring Demon Scripture

Only by using the True Scripture as a foundation can one build a ladder to the heavens and knock open the door to longevity.

It was truly a fortuitous coincidence that a True Scripture, which no one had ever cultivated to the Foundation Establishment realm, had appeared at this very moment.

This lineage's inheritance continued to this day, yet its position remained vacant, like a peerless divine sword sealed in dust for a thousand years, quietly awaiting a destined person to wield it.

Xu Yunfan raised his head, his eyes shining brightly.

"Why doesn't the Senior impart the relevant cultivation True Scripture of the Divine Martial Foundation to me? Once I attain the Golden Core Dao in the future, I will surely help the Senior transcend the cycle of suffering and continue the Dao path."

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning, his words carrying an indescribable sincerity.

"Wishful thinking!"

The face of the Divine Martial True Lord suddenly distorted. He stared fixedly at the faintly visible dark golden Dao patterns on Xu Yunfan's chest.

The Martial Dao Profound Crystal had already fused with the other party's heart and blood, making it impossible to separate.

Three thousand years of planning had ended up being a wedding gown for someone else. This realization made a sweet, metallic taste rise in his throat, and he almost died from rage.

"How could this happen..."

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, the qi around him like an abyss or a vast sea.

The Spirit Liquid of the Ginseng Baby was still surging through his flesh and blood, completely healing the hidden injuries caused by the intense battle just moments ago. His strength had increased significantly once more, and he clearly felt that taking this old monster's life now would be as easy as turning his palm.

"It seems the Senior is determined to meet a violent death here," Xu Yunfan sighed, the Ten Extreme True Qi condensing into a crimson golden vortex in his palm. "What a pity for this Foundation Establishment cultivation. In the future, you'll just sink into the sea of suffering as a pig or a dog."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's piercing words, the Divine Martial True Lord's expression turned extremely unsightly.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyes to look at the Divine Martial True Lord, the golden light in his eyes like a sword.

"It seems the True Lord has miscalculated."

He took a step forward, and the ground cracked under his feet. "Since the Senior does not want to die with dignity, then this junior will help you find it..."

The Divine Martial True Lord's face suddenly became ferocious, and he suddenly turned into a stream of light, charging towards Xu Yunfan.

"Once I possess you, everything will still be mine!"

The stream of light the Divine Martial True Lord transformed into was like a venomous dragon entering the sea, piercing through Xu Yunfan's brow prime aperture in an instant.

In that moment, Xu Yunfan felt as if his skull had been split open by a thunderbolt of immense force. A chilling aura filled with boundless malice rushed straight in, charging towards the depths of his sea of consciousness like a spear aimed at the emperor.

"Junior! Although my current realm and status have fallen, I was once at Foundation Establishment. My soul is worlds apart from that of a typical Qi Condensation disciple. Today, I shall let you witness the methods of a Foundation Establishment True Lord!"

The maddening divine sense exploded within his skull, and Xu Yunfan's vision suddenly filled with a vast starry sky.

The soul of the Divine Martial True Lord manifested into a giant that blotted out the sky and the sun, its body entwined with nine purple-black giant snakes. These were the lifebound Dao patterns he had condensed when he was at Foundation Establishment. At this moment, these black snakes writhed frantically, actually shattering the entire starry sky of the sea of consciousness.

Xu Yunfan suddenly let out a muffled groan, and淡 golden blood trickled from his seven orifices.

He clearly felt the terrifying pressure emanating from the other party's soul. It was the aura of someone who had truly touched the laws of the Heavenly Dao. Although the remnant soul of the Divine Martial True Lord was not even one ten-thousandth of its peak, the suppression a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator exerted on a Qi Condensation level cultivator, especially on a martial artist, was even greater—like a tiger facing a lamb.

"Lin."

As this light shout echoed in the sea of consciousness, Xu Yunfan's pupils suddenly glowed with a golden sheen, as if transforming into two golden suns.

The instant he entered the Lin state, within a hundred zhang radius, three falling leaves drifted slowly through the air; seventeen ants were transporting eggs seven feet underground, causing minute vibrations; on a crooked tree in the southeast corner, two sparrows flapped their wings, stirring up thirty-six strands of airflow.

All things were reflected in the lake of his heart, down to the most minute details.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath. It had been quite some time since he had entered the Lin state.

It wasn't that he was unwilling. The Lin state was powerful, but as Yu Congling had said before, as he continuously used the Lin state, his emotions seemed to be stripped away as well. After exiting the Lin state, it took a considerable amount of time for his humanity to return, for the seven emotions and six desires to coalesce again.

The ferocious smile on the Divine Martial True Lord suddenly froze.

He discovered that what he had invaded was not a common sea of consciousness, but a vast and boundless world of glazed light.

Nine golden suns hung high in the heavens, the earth was spread with jade-like meridians, and in the distance, twelve giant bronze cauldrons suppressed the four directions.

Most terrifyingly, the qi circulating in this world was not true qi, but some kind of chaotic aura he had never seen before.

"This... is the Realm of Forgetting Emotions of the Supreme?" the Divine Martial True Lord instantly realized, his expression turning extremely unsightly, his voice trembling. "How could the secret transmission of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect... be here? How did you cultivate it?!"

This Dao of Forgetting Emotions of the Supreme, even within the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, very few people knew it.

Before his words faded, the entire sea of consciousness suddenly trembled violently.

The nine golden suns simultaneously emitted a blinding light, interweaving into a golden cloud pattern that blotted out the sky and the sun above the firmament.

In the center of the cloud pattern, a majestic figure slowly appeared, wearing a high crown and wide robes, draped in a robe patterned with the stars of the heavens, its face resembling Xu Yunfan's by seven-tenths, yet exuding an ancient and enduring vicissitude of life.

Self-God Dharma Form!

The soul of the Divine Martial True Lord trembled violently.

As a cultivator who had once successfully established his foundation, he knew all too well what this meant. An ordinary cultivator's sea of consciousness could at most condense a phantom. Those who could manifest a Self-God Dharma Form were all monsters who had tempered their spirit to the realm of "thoughts bring forth laws."

"Impossible... you haven't even established your foundation, how could you possibly condense a Self-God?!" The Divine Martial True Lord's heart filled with bitterness, and he couldn't help but roar to the heavens: "I've been set up! I've been set up!!"

The Self-God Dharma Form slowly opened its eyes, and within them seemed to be the Milky Way in reverse.

He merely raised his hand lightly, and the purple-black giant snakes around the Divine Martial True Lord shattered inch by inch. Those lifebound Dao patterns he had once been proud of were now as fragile as paper meeting fire, turning into wisps of green smoke in the golden light.

The Divine Martial True Lord let out a piercing scream.

He frantically formed hand seals, wanting to escape, but saw the Self-God Dharma Form's five fingers slightly spread, and the entire sea of consciousness suddenly collapsed into a chaotic vortex.

Countless golden threads emerged from the void, transforming into a cage that imprisoned the heavens and locked the earth, firmly trapping his soul within.

"Soul Search."

With the Dharma Form's indifferent verdict, countless golden threads pierced into the Divine Martial True Lord's soul.

Fragmented memories flashed by like a revolving lantern.

The heavenly phenomena when establishing his foundation three thousand years ago, the humiliation of hiding within a flood dragon after his realm fell, the scheme of secretly guiding the disciples of the Primordial Sect to find the Martial Dao Profound Crystal... Finally, it fixed upon an ancient scroll with a dragon bone as its axis and star sand as its ink.

*True Martial Devouring Demon Scripture*!

When the golden light touched this segment of memory, the entire sea of consciousness suddenly resonated with a Dao sound as grand as the bells of a grand ceremony.

The scroll automatically unfurled in the void, revealing the twelve ancient seal characters on its opening: "Use the Martial to reach the Profound, devour demons to feed oneself. Deities and demons avoid, all laws return to One."

Xu Yunfan's Self-God Dharma Form suddenly trembled violently.

The content of the scripture surged into his mind like a flood, each word weighing as heavily as a mountain.

"The Martial Deity is the emperor who commands all laws. Use the stellar force of the周天 to temper the body, absorb the evil qi of the Nine Nethers to refine the soul. Hide the deity in the heart,孕丹 in the Purple Mansion. The spine transforms into a heavenly ladder, with thirty-three segments corresponding to the thirty-three heavens; the five organs become the five mountains, suppressing the rotation of the five elements..."
