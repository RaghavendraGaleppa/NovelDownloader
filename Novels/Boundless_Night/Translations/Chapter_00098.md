# Chapter 98: Unprecedented

Meng Xinghai knew Li Qingxiao's elders, so he couldn't directly reprimand him. He simply waved him away, but the young man remained stubbornly cheerful, refusing to get up.

He secretly transmitted a message to Qin Ming, asking how his Golden Silkworm Art cultivation was progressing.
"It's done," Qin Ming replied.

If Li Qingxiao hadn't been there, Old Meng would have stood up again, genuinely shocked. It had only been five days; how could he have mastered it? Time was tight this time, and Meng Xinghai had intended to help him get started with a secret technique, but he hadn't expected him to accomplish it himself within a few days.

Meng Xinghai's gaze shifted. This young man continuously surprised him, always exceeding his expectations and hopes.

"Brother Qin Ming..." Li Qingxiao began.

"Go stand aside!" Meng Xinghai grew increasingly impatient with him. Didn't he see that the uncle and nephew were having a harmonious discussion? They were about to discuss serious matters, yet this person was interfering.

Li Qingxiao was stunned, then his face flushed crimson. Praised since childhood and naturally arrogant, he immediately felt humiliated. In truth, Meng Xinghai was just annoyed by him.

"Uncle Meng, if you speak to me like that, I'll be unhappy! I want to challenge Qin Ming, the city's top talent, right here!" Li Qingxiao stood up, Heavenlight Qi flowing through his entire body.

"What madness are you spouting?" Meng Xinghai showed him no quarter.

Li Qingxiao dared not erupt. "Uncle Meng," he said, "I'm following the rules. Anyone has the right to question and challenge the city's top talent personally appointed by the City Lord during the grand examination." After saying this, he regretted it. He had merely passed through this place to inquire about some news; he truly didn't want to offend Meng Xinghai.

"Uncle Meng, I'm sorry. I'm young and ignorant; please don't take it to heart." Realizing his mistake, Li Qingxiao immediately apologized, reverting to a smiling, sunny youth.

Meng Xinghai calmly stated, "Since you've questioned it, if I don't permit it, wouldn't people say I'm practicing favoritism? The 'top talent' of Scarlet Cloud City would also become a fraud in many people's eyes. I'll have to arrange it for you."

Li Qingxiao was mortified. If he truly angered Meng Xinghai, his family wouldn't let him off easily.

"Little Qin, come accept his challenge and questioning," Meng Xinghai declared, immediately ordering people to prepare the venue and invite spectators.

Qin Ming naturally nodded in agreement. Old Meng was angry; how could he just sit there calmly? He hadn't originally intended to bother with this young man, but since the other party kept jumping around, he didn't mind a warm-up. Besides, he was still a young man; why act so mature? He had to have youthful vigor! Lest Old Meng look at him strangely.

It was too late for Li Qingxiao to say anything. The City Lord had spoken, and everyone immediately sprang into action. Not only guards from the City Lord's Mansion but also people from outside came to watch the fight at the training ground. Everything was ready.

"Please!" Li Qingxiao no longer wanted to call him 'Brother'; he was already seething with anger.

The City Lord's Mansion's training ground was large enough for confrontations between those in the Rebirth stage. Li Qingxiao, dressed in luxurious silk, adorned with beautiful jade, presented the image of a handsome young master. Yet, he drew a gleaming broadsword, wider and longer than ordinary blades.

"Where's your weapon?" he asked.

"I'm older than you, so I won't need a weapon." Qin Ming, dressed in green, with a delicate face and clear eyes, his sleeves fluttering, his steps unblemished by dust, possessed an exceptionally refined aura, like an exiled immortal.

"You're truly overconfident. When did you embark on the Rebirth Path? To so brazenly look down on someone who has undergone rebirth seven times," Li Qingxiao said indifferently.

The onlookers were all astonished. A fourteen-year-old boy had already undergone rebirth seven times?! Qin Ming wasn't surprised. His "biological younger brother," Cui Chongxuan, was not yet thirteen, but had already begun consuming Three-Colored Flowers and merging four types of Heavenlight Qi. Ancient families possessed unfathomable foundations. They didn't need to wait for the golden age to undergo rebirth. As long as their talent wasn't poor, the only thing that could restrict them during the Rebirth stage was the special "buffer period" where their bodies couldn't undergo frequent mutations within a year.

"Come on!" Qin Ming gestured for him to make his move.

Li Qingxiao's expression was cold. He left numerous afterimages in the arena, like a phantom appearing and disappearing, causing the faces of many outside the arena to change. He swung his blade, employing a force manipulation technique from a renowned sabre manual. The entire broadsword crackled with the sound of thunder and lightning. It was his Heavenlight Qi vibrating the long blade, possessing an irresistible momentum.

Qin Ming dodged the blade's edge and smashed a fist onto the side of the blade, using a pounding force to shatter its momentum. In his eyes, Li Qingxiao's blade technique was merely decent. Li Qingxiao was shaken by a tremendous force, nearly losing his grip on the long blade. His body froze, and his phantom-like movement technique was interrupted. Qin Ming moved as fast as lightning, his green robe fluttering, appearing behind Li Qingxiao. He kicked the young man's backside, sending him flying.

"I..." Li Qingxiao was so angry he nearly exploded on the spot. This was the person he had questioned and slighted, and he had even subtly mocked the other party using words from his cousin, Li Qingxu. Yet, when he personally stepped onto the stage, it was so humiliating. After landing, he moved like a phantom, swinging his blade again, unleashing a tsunami-like roar. This was a killing move from another blade manual.

Qin Ming struck the blade with an explosive force. Even a broadsword tempered a thousand times shattered into pieces instantly, the fragments clattering piercingly as they fell to the ground. Li Qingxiao instantly turned to stone. The opponent had shattered his weapon with bare hands?! Then, he was kicked in the backside again, falling far away. Meng Xinghai knew Li family elders, so Qin Ming didn't want to draw blood from Li Qingxiao. Those two kicks were sufficient. He guessed Li Qingxiao would rather take a blade than be kicked in the backside. If this got out, how would his acquaintances from those aristocratic families view him?

His face was pale, having suffered a major blow. He had grown up amidst praise, yet today he was so utterly vulnerable. Qin Ming objectively assessed him: his strength was actually quite good. But since the other party was so "jumpy" and insisted on provoking him, Qin Ming wouldn't be polite. He aimed to suppress this scheming youth in the shortest time possible, with simple, brutal, and overwhelming force. Otherwise, Li Qingxiao wouldn't have been defeated so quickly.

"Child, are you alright? No one never loses. Just work hard to improve yourself; don't be sad," Meng Xinghai consoled him at the right moment.

Li Qingxiao, dejected and silent, returned to the living room.

Meng Xinghai said, "I am a man of principle. I would never arbitrarily name Little Qin as the city's top talent just because of our close relationship."

Li Qingxiao nodded blankly. Much later, he recovered and said, "Qin Ming, you are indeed very strong on this Rebirth Path. I am only fourteen, which happens to meet the requirements of the Outer Realm. From now on, I will embark on the Immortal Path."

"Congratulations," Qin Ming said blandly.

Li Qingxiao said, "Originally, I wanted to walk both paths simultaneously, but now you've made me focus."

"Are you also going to tell me that we'll meet in the Outer Realm after reaching the peak?" Qin Ming looked at him and said, "If I step into the Outer Realm, it might not be what you imagine, and certainly not what you wish for."

Li Qingxiao and an old man rode away on an exotic beast. He never wanted to come to Scarlet Cloud City again!

Meng Xinghai drank his tea, then smiled at Qin Ming and said, "I've prepared a Five-Colored Spirit Branch for you. Its effects are far more potent than the Three-Colored Flower, and it can help you merge your Heavenlight Qi and increase its total amount."

"This... is very rare and valuable, isn't it?" Qin Ming asked.

Meng Xinghai nodded. "Yes, it originates from the Outer Realm, from a precious tree rooted in a Heavenlight Pool. The old branches cannot be easily disturbed, but new branches can be collected each year. A single branch has five different colored leaves; it looks fresh on the outside, but inside, its Heavenlight essence is incredibly potent."

"An old tree, a Heavenlight Pool..." Qin Ming listened, his heart filled with yearning. What kind of wondrous place was that? Even just a newly grown Five-Colored Spirit Branch from early spring possessed astonishing medicinal effects. It only showed how unfathomable the Outer Realm was.

"Is its yield large?" Qin Ming truly didn't know much about these things.

Meng Xinghai said, "Every early spring, after the Outer Realm distributes it, ancient families get a small quota. My lineage didn't have any promising descendants this year, so the one given to me goes cheaply to you."

Qin Ming sighed. What was true foundation? This was it! Because the Outer Realm was strong enough, it naturally occupied the best resources. Anything that casually leaked out, even a small new branch, was a rare spiritual item outside.

Meng Xinghai seemed to have seen through his thoughts and said, "Feeling the pressure now? The gap is huge. If I hadn't been discovered to have other paths to take when I was young, given the chance to change my destiny, then if I had only walked the Rebirth Path and cultivated my entire life to achieve the highest possible attainment, I would only be a mere guardian outside the mountain gates in the Esoteric Sect." Clearly, Meng Xinghai's path was related to the Esoteric Sect and touched upon the divine.

Qin Ming nodded. He had previously thought he understood the various paths quite well, but now it seemed his knowledge was still limited. Immediately, his eyes seemed to flicker with fire, his conviction firm. All he needed to do now was strive to improve himself. He had undergone arduous cultivation not to become a follower of Outer Realm disciples!

Qin Ming opened the long, rectangular jade box on the table. Inside was a tender branch, thumb-thick and over two feet long, emanating five-colored mist. Its Heavenlight essence was contained within, with only five leaves, each a different color, all crystal clear and flowing with rich vitality.

Meng Xinghai said, "The competition among Outer Realm disciples is about to begin. You should stay at the City Lord's Mansion for the next two days, consume the Five-Colored Spirit Branch, and once your Heavenlight Qi is enhanced, you should head there."

Qin Ming felt it wouldn't take that long. The last time he consumed the Three-Colored Flower, all his Heavenlight Qi perfectly unified on the same day.

Meng Xinghai asked, "What kind of weapon do you use? I'll have someone forge it for you, mixing in some rare precious metals for marvelous effects."

"Uncle Meng, I have a blade here. Could you find someone to reforge it for me?" Qin Ming drew his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade. Originally, he and Old Liu had forged the Jade Iron Blade using very crude methods, and it hadn't been sharpened since.

"This..." Meng Xinghai's eyes sparkled. This was far better than the materials he had prepared; the pure Jade Iron Blade had not a single impurity. He sighed, "You're quite something, kid. This is extraordinary Jade Iron. It's just that the forging method... I don't even want to comment. It's truly a waste."

"I still have a small piece. I want to forge it into an arrowhead." Qin Ming took out a piece of blue jade iron, about half the size of a walnut.

"That's too extravagant. Even the arrows I use aren't of such material. When you fire this arrow, be careful and don't be reckless," Meng Xinghai reminded him.

That day, Qin Ming consumed the Five-Colored Spirit Branch in a quiet courtyard within the City Lord's Mansion. Immediately, he felt his entire body being scorched by Heavenlight, as if it were being torn apart. The Heavenlight essence contained in the Five-Colored Spirit Branch was more violent than that of the Three-Colored Flower, but Qin Ming's physique was also much stronger than before. That night, he pushed his Blazing Fire Qi to its peak and cultivated his Golden Silkworm Qi to the limit allowed by five rebirths. On his body's surface, divine Blazing Fire light would appear one moment, and strands of golden silkworm silk the next. The Heavenlight Qi from both remarkable arts had miraculous protective effects. Furthermore, Qin Ming's Vajra Qi, Wind Qi, Golden Light Qi, and other arts, which he had cultivated not long ago, were also rapidly elevated. That night, he gathered all his Heavenlight Qi, unifying them, and finally, all were merged by the Rebirth technique recorded on the silk scroll. Qin Ming gave it a slight try and immediately knew that the power of his Heavenlight Qi had increased significantly. This was primarily because the Golden Light Qi, Blazing Fire Qi, Golden Silkworm Qi, and other merged arts all had significant origins, especially the latter two, which belonged to the category of remarkable arts.

At this time, in the outside world, the competition among Outer Realm disciples was widely known. From blessed lands to ancient families, and to the major cities shrouded in night fog, many people were discussing it. Qin Ming's strength had greatly increased, becoming unprecedentedly powerful. His state of mind grew even more peaceful, and he was ready to head to the Outer Realm.
