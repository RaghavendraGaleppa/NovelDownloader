## Chapter 244: Ten Suns Across the Sky

Today, night was as bright as day. Above the plateau, multiple great suns hung in the sky, illuminating all directions. The fine textures of tree branches, the vibrant green luster of budding leaves, the tiny antennae of flying insects—all were clearly visible, making the entire world incredibly vivid.

From both the New Life Path and the Immortal Path, several Ancestral Masters appeared, descending upon the plateau, their released light dispelling the pervasive night mist. The atmosphere was exceptionally tense. Was there about to be a fierce conflict between the two Paths? If Ancestral Masters were to duel, it would undoubtedly shake heaven and earth!

There was no doubt that once a conflict erupted between the two sides, it would be the most severe major event in many years. Many people's hearts trembled, their scalps tingling with shock. Was the sky about to change?

"The people of the New Life Path are indeed causing trouble," an eminent figure from beyond the mortal realm said, his expression unprecedentedly solemn. Some experts from the Immortal Path, hearing this, also changed their expressions. Was an arduous battle imminent? Because they sensed that the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path seemed truly intent on a major conflict this time, not just grandstanding.

"Does one not know who truly instigated this?" Yu Gensheng retorted with a cold face. Many people secretly nodded. Individuals like Pu Heng had been full of malice, targeting the New Life Path and actively provoking incidents.

"Heh heh..." In the high sky, Cao Qianqiu sneered. He exuded terrifying fluctuations, immortal runes shimmered, and crimson light enveloped him, dyeing that part of the sky red. Facing such a perilous situation, he remained exceptionally forceful, raising the rusty spear in his hand, appearing utterly domineering and peerless.

"Is your mouth twisted? Laughing like that!" Ancestral Master Qingtian spoke, standing in blinding light, like a giant who cleaved the heavens. The older generation knew that he always preferred to break laws with force, being exceedingly rough and fierce. However, many of the younger and middle-aged generations, seeing the burly man in the light barrier for the first time, were all stunned. Could this Ancestral Master of the New Life Path be so 'down-to-earth' in his speech?

As Cao Qianqiu's eyes opened and closed, bolts of lightning shot forth, incredibly frightening. He tightened his grip on the spear obtained from Black-White Mountain, ready to make his move. At this moment, everyone was greatly shocked, gazing at the several "heavenly suns" above the vast grassland. Their breathing grew difficult, their legs turned soft, almost collapsing to the ground. This was still the result of Ancestral-level figures restraining their pressure.

Immediately, everyone awoke as if from a dream, retreating quickly. Once figures of that level made a move, the dense clouds above would explode, the vast earth below would turn to scorched earth, and all life in the entire region would wither. Fortunately, this was on the plateau outside the Third Desolate Land, far from densely populated mega-cities, making it most suitable for battles among those at the apex of power.

In just a brief moment, it was as if entire races were migrating away from the edge of the plateau, swiftly retreating from the area. Under the vast sky, divine light shone in all directions, and spear lights shot forth. Undoubtedly, Ancestral-level figures had clashed once. Dark clouds exploded there, and the ground violently trembled, seemingly on the verge of collapsing entirely.

Many were terrified. How many years had it been since such a major confrontation between the leaders of different Paths was seen? Today, scenes of Ancestral-level figures fighting to the death were truly about to unfold. In truth, people knew that giants of this level, from different Paths, might have secret battles in private and exchanged blows, but they usually wouldn't do so openly. Multiple Ancestral Masters confronting each other before the world, an unconcealed chaotic battle, a grand eruption of conflict between the two Paths—this was the only time in many years.

"Everyone, please calm down first. A battle of this magnitude would have too great an impact and spread too widely. Let's not easily initiate conflict," Sun Taichu said. He stood beside Cao Qianqiu. Although he had previously pounded the table against him, if a conflict erupted, it was clear whose side he would take, as they both originated from the Pure Land.

"Indeed, after so many years of peace, why initiate conflict today?" A black-haired man approached, his feet wreathed in immortal light that paved the clouds. He arrived above the plateau in an instant from the horizon. His name was Zhao Wenhan, an Ancestral-level figure from the Immortal Earth beyond the mortal realm. Although his dark hair shone brightly, the vicissitudes in his eyes and the wrinkles at their corners still showed his advanced age. Upon his arrival, he stood on Cao Qianqiu's other side.

"Are you suggesting that after targeting the New Life Path, we should still remain calm and maintain the status quo?" Lu Yu stood in the void, covered in blazing sunlight, exuding boundless divine light that tore through the deep night. His words were calm, but terrifying killing intent surged like an ocean, fiercely expanding forward.

"Having not emerged for a long time, some people think we're being patient and expect us to get used to it. Are the people of the Immortal Path seriously ill? They need a cure today!" Ancestral Master Qingtian stood within the dazzling light barrier, his majestic figure towering like a great mountain.

Following closely, a great sun accompanied Lu Yu and Ancestral Master Qingtian, illuminating all directions. "At most, it's just a battle!" One could see a short-haired old man within the great sun, holding prayer beads, speaking calmly. Although his entire being was imbued with Zen charm, he now also exuded intimidating divine light energy that surged like thunder around his body. The Tathagata of this Age had also arrived, speaking few words, but his aura and the divine light he emitted caused the plateau to tremble slightly, truly terrifying.

New Life Path and Immortal Path, Ancestral-level experts, three against three. A tense atmosphere permeated the air, causing the entire night sky to tremble, as if heaven and earth were about to overturn.

Compared to the past, Cao Qianqiu was already being very restrained. After all, they had only two people just now, fewer than the opposing side, and engaging in a bloodbath of this caliber naturally made him extraordinarily cautious. But now, with Zhao Wenhan's arrival, the numbers were even.

"You old fogies, you can really endure," Cao Qianqiu said coldly. He had spent his entire life tackling tough challenges and didn't mind a bloody battle here. He clearly sensed the declining vitality on the three opposing Ancestral Masters and felt that today might be an opportunity to fully 'assess' the New Life Path! Because he recalled the secret reports obtained by the Immortal Path, which claimed that the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path were failing, their condition very poor.

Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan both frowned. They naturally knew that Old Cao was eager to strike, but once a confrontation began, as they had said, the impact would be too immense. Especially since the people of the Esoteric Sect were on the sidelines and had not yet joined the fray.

The Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path had vastly different personalities: some were peaceful, some silent, some incredibly fiery. "Cao Qianqiu, you little brat!" No one expected Ancestral Master Qingtian to utter such a phrase. From afar, everyone was dumbfounded. Old Cao was also a figure in the Ancestral realm, yet he was addressed in such a manner?

Qingtian's long hair flowed loosely, his eyes like lightning tearing through the void. He said, "You fledgling brat, you deserve a beating! Even your master took slaps from this old man. What are you being arrogant about in front of us? The distance between you and your master is just two slaps!" Silence fell on all sides, everyone was dazed. Was this Ancestral Master dropping a bombshell? He really dared to say anything!

Everyone knew that Qingtian, Lu Yu, and others had extremely long lifespans, but few knew that the events they experienced in their early years contained such "big news". Cao Qianqiu's eyes were cold. He had surpassed his master, being even more powerful. Now, his killing intent surged. Undoubtedly, both sides were ready to fight to the death at any moment!

"How do you feel? What's their condition?" Zhao Wenhan secretly transmitted his voice. "It's somewhat complex," Sun Taichu replied. The two were carefully sensing with their Pure Yang consciousness, seriously and diligently evaluating.

In the world of night mist, it had been rumored for years that the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path were extending their lives and should not make a move; they seemed unable to fight. It was said that their lifespans were insufficient, and once they exerted themselves, it would accelerate their decay, perhaps even preventing them from sustaining a full battle. However, now that three Ancestral Masters had arrived together, everyone was greatly surprised. Such figures were best as a deterrent when not making a move. But once their lifespan was exhausted, the current New Life Path would essentially be severed. It could be said that such consequences would be extremely severe, unbearable for the New Life Path.

At this moment, Sun Taichu transmitted a message to a major figure of the Esoteric Sect. Instantly, an old man, his body formed of divine wisdom, exuded brilliant multi-colored light, shooting straight towards the sky and arriving nearby. "Sirs..." He had just begun to speak when he was interrupted.

Ancestral Master Lu Yu secretly transmitted his voice, saying, "Your Esoteric Sect shouldn't meddle. Go and check on your unparalleled expert instead. Perhaps they'll be dug out from the Fourth Desolate Land by some of the longest-lived old monsters from the Immortal Path." In an instant, this major figure of the Esoteric Sect fell silent, his eyes incredibly deep. Was fire about to be set in their backyard? Regardless of whether the news was true, he had to have someone investigate! Although the one who single-handedly pierced through the Fourth Desolate Land should logically not be a cause for their concern, some things still had to be guarded against. At the very least, he detected that the number of Ancestral Masters from the Immortal Path didn't match; someone had disappeared from the plateau.

"Cao, you little brat, today I'm definitely going to smash you!" Ancestral Master Qingtian stepped forward, actually preparing to make a move, bringing forth terrifying divine light energy that caused all distant clouds to violently collide. Outside the plateau, people were both shocked and felt a strange sensation. Cao Qianqiu, such a terrifying figure, rarely encountering a match in his life, immensely powerful and bloody-handed, yet he was called 'little brat' repeatedly by the Ancestral Master of the New Life Path. It truly felt novel and peculiar.

"Qingtian, Lu Yu, Tathagata, just come! This old man will drain your lifespans dry and send all of you on your way!" Cao Qianqiu's forceful nature had long become an instinct. Today, he was seething with pent-up rage, which was now about to erupt. He stepped forward, holding the long spear inscribed with divine runes.

"Why go to such lengths!" A woman flew into the sky, with a head of black hair, appearing to be around thirty, her beauty ageless, enveloped in rich immortal light. Her appearance was outstanding. She was an Ancestral Master from the Yang Land beyond the mortal realm, named Yu Shaohua.

"Lu Yu, are you doing well?" She was actually reminiscing, as she had a good relationship with some of the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path, and truly wanted to prevent a major war between the two sides this time.

"I'm fine, just feeling a bit restless and want to stretch my muscles," Lu Yu said. Then, he fixed his gaze on Cao Qianqiu. Although his words were calm, he, like Ancestral Master Qingtian, greatly wanted to smash Old Cao. That intention and action were completely undisguised.

"Fellow Daoist Yu, please come this way. I have something to ask," At this moment, in the distant night sky, clear radiance spilled forth, like a sea of stars appearing. It was a kind of surging, mighty divine light energy, covering the vast sky.

"Ancestral Master Yuqing has also arrived!" Zhao Ziyuan's face was full of smiles, immensely joyful. The expressions of those from the Immortal Path, however, drastically changed. The New Life Path truly intended to stir up a storm; were all their Ancestral Masters going to personally appear?

Cao Qianqiu's expression also paused slightly. Something was very wrong! All sides felt their hearts pound, having already realized something. This time, the people of the New Life Path were not making threats or intimidation; they were truly going to wage a great war!

At this point, even those outside the plateau understood that the soaring killing intent today had long been presaged, destined to shake the heavens. Qin Ming understood. No wonder Lu Zizai had told him to fight without restraint that day; it turned out that the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path had been preparing to enter the fray long ago.

According to rumors, Qingtian, Yuqing, Tathagata, and others did not have much lifespan left. These Ancestral Masters deliberately made a strong move while under the world's gaze. They were considering the future, wanting to deter all sides, and perhaps would even fight to the death to eliminate Cao Qianqiu regardless of the cost.

At this moment, Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan's hearts sank. Currently, it wasn't a matter of the number of people on each side, but rather their horrified realization that the opponents were truly going to make a move, dared to act, and were not afraid of exhausting their lifespans! Such Ancestral Masters, who dared to fight and kill, were the most terrifying! Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan were extremely wary. Because Qingtian, Lu Yu, and others, under extreme circumstances, were highly likely to trade one life for another, taking away the Immortal Path's giants who harbored strong malice towards the New Life Path.

At this very moment, Cao Qianqiu no longer spoke any extreme words. He was indeed arrogant, but he also didn't want to fight to the death with madmen. If others simply wanted to drag him along on their journey, and he actively went along, wouldn't it be too great a loss for him, in his prime?

Sun Taichu said, "Fellow Daoists, please wait. These are not major issues. If you have any grievances, we can sit down and discuss them over tea."

Qingtian said, "There are too many grievances. Have some people forgotten that in the early years, when heaven and earth changed, our New Life Path alone contended against gigantic beasts, mountain-sized plants, and various alien creatures, supporting everything single-handedly? The bloody past was incredibly tragic. At that time, your Paths hadn't even appeared, hadn't risen, and relied entirely on the support of new life. Now you think your wings are fully grown, and you target people of the New Life Path everywhere. Do you have any shame?"

Zhao Wenhan said, "How could we forget? The New Life Path is the foundation, and multiple Paths compete healthily. During the great pioneering era, we were all brothers!"

Lu Yu spoke, mentioning everything from the New Life Path's right to speak, to the future grand development's allocation plan, and their respective safety boundaries. "And there's a very important point: some people are shameless. Don't they know their own high status and great age? To bully the small, to kill the younger generation of our New Life Path—that's so deranged, it needs to be cured!" Evidently, such 'down-to-earth' words could only come from Qingtian.

Although no names were mentioned, everyone knew he was scolding Cao Qianqiu. "Whoever dares to overreach and deliberately throttle the geniuses of our New Life Path, we will repay it many times over!" This time, Ancestral Master Qingtian pointed directly at Cao Qianqiu's nose, making it an "open declaration".

Cao Qianqiu gripped the spear tightly, his knuckles cracking. Sun Taichu grabbed him, preventing him from going forward.

Lu Yu said, "Back then, when we were in secluded cultivation, the Hegemon met with an accident. Although many years have passed, that matter is not over. Today, we'll settle all scores!"

Cao Qianqiu's eyes were chillingly cold; his anger was about to explode.

"Let's not talk about the past. Today's incident was merely triggered by a misunderstanding among the younger generation," Zhao Wenhan said, changing the subject, not wanting to settle old scores.

Qingtian said, "Today, anyone with clear eyes and an unblinded heart knows the situation. It's again the lineage of Cao the Rogue, full of malice, targeting the New Life Path."

Upon hearing this, Cao Qianqiu could no longer tolerate it!

"Cao, you little brat, get over here!" Before Old Cao could erupt, Ancestral Master Qingtian fiercely made his move first.

Cao Qianqiu was enraged. When had he ever felt so aggrieved? Today, he had been "vexed" for a long time, worried that a few old fellows would trade their lives for his and desperately take him down. Now, he was fearless! In fact, after the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path had finished their negotiations, a great battle was inevitable anyway; otherwise, no amount of talking would be useful. And the one they targeted was Cao Qianqiu. For so many years, he had been the most jumpy and arrogant, and they wanted to give him the beating he asked for. Even if other Immortal Path Ancestral Masters obstructed and assisted, preventing his death, they would still brutally beat him, making him never forget this bloody experience in his life, and think twice before daring to overreach again.

Cao Qianqiu roared, "Old scoundrel, I've tolerated you for too long! Come on, I, Cao, might just send all of you off today!"

Qingtian said, "Good, good, good! Today, I've come mainly for you. This old man will tear you apart with his bare hands!"

Above the plateau, the situation among Ancestral-level figures changed in an instant. Just moments ago, they were negotiating, and now they were about to fight to the death. It was ultimately unavoidable. Some Ancestral Masters of the Immortal Path remained in their ancestral court, while others had indeed gone to investigate the Fourth Desolate Land, putting them at a numerical disadvantage currently.

Just then, black and white light blossomed. Someone stood within a Yin-Yang diagram, arriving from the horizon in an instant. "Indeed, that divine light baptism two hundred years ago was triggered by you, and you've also reached the Ancestral level!" Sun Taichu exclaimed. The Grandmaster of the Yin-Yang Temple had arrived, yet another Ancestral Master from the New Life Path.

Boom! Qingtian moved, his strength capable of supporting the heavens. Like an ancient deity who cleaved the sky, with one palm strike, boundless terrifying divine light scattered all the dense dark clouds in the sky, slamming towards Cao Qianqiu.

The Tathagata of this Age, though usually silent and rarely speaking, directly lunged forward at the crucial moment, his terrifying divine light like a shattering sun. In an instant, immeasurable divine light flooded the area. He was attacking Cao Qianqiu, while also keeping an eye on Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan. As his eyes opened and closed, runes intertwined, and his domain materialized, appearing before them like a mysterious realm descending, blocking the two.

Lu Yu made his move, his first strike also directed at Cao Qianqiu. He moved by manipulating the six energies, his fist light descending, manifesting mountains and rivers, causing myriad laws to come into being and perish in a mere flick of a finger. Following this, six figures emerged from the six energies. All six wore imperial crowns, immensely majestic, simultaneously blasting Old Cao.

Furthermore, black and white light shone, Yin and Yang energies boiled, and the old Grandmaster of the Yin-Yang Temple also erupted from behind Cao Qianqiu!

"I...!" Cao Qianqiu was both shocked and enraged. He had never fought such a stifling, passive battle. Even with Sun Taichu and Zhao Wenhan moving to aid him immediately, Old Cao still suffered a critical blow, instantly spitting out large mouthfuls of blood, his spear nearly slipping from his grasp.

Not only that, Yuqing also charged in, leading Ancestral Master Yu Shaohua of the Yang Land beyond the mortal realm into the battle. Although Yu Shaohua was meant to stand with the Immortal Path at this moment, she had good relations with the Ancestral Masters of the New Life Path, and was currently fighting rather passively.

Boom! Cao Qianqiu flew horizontally, blood flowing from all seven orifices, his body covered in cracks. He was in a Pure Yang consciousness spiritual light state; such copious bleeding indicated he had suffered severe injuries.

At this moment, nine Ancestral Masters were engaged in battle. If the giant from the Esoteric Sect observing nearby was included, then it was truly "Ten Suns Across the Sky".

Outside the plateau, Lu Zizai's five fingers glowed. Several golden chains extended from his fingertips, securing Pu Heng and his two junior brothers, as well as Sun Taichu's second disciple Wei Yunqi, all captured alive. Simultaneously, he instructed Qin Ming to enter the fray and challenge the seeded experts of the Immortal Path's Second Realm.

The hearts of the Immortal Path's people trembled. Had the New Life Path gone mad? From old to young, everyone today was determined to fight to the death against the Immortal Path.

"Who else? All of you, come here!" Lu Zizai spoke, looking into the distance, eyeing the other personal disciples of Cao Qianqiu, Zhao Wenhan, Sun Taichu, and others.

Qin Ming followed the advice, bathed in five-colored radiant light, and walked with his blade, immediately challenging Li Qingxu to step forth, indicating he would start with him.

Deep within the plateau, above the night sky, Cao Qianqiu was both shocked and enraged. Everyone had come to beat him, all slapping him, striking him with fist imprints, and kicking him treacherously. He was on the verge of exploding on the spot. Most terrifyingly, the spear in his hand, originating from Black-White Mountain, flowed with divine runes, unexpectedly causing him to fall through the air. This sent shivers down his spine, and simultaneously made him furious beyond measure.
