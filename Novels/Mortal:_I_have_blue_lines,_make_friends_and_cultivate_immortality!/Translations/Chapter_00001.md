# Chapter 1: Fellow Daoist, Please Stay!

Tai Nan Small Gathering.

Lin Yun walked through a misty path and arrived at a verdant valley filled with exotic flowers and rare herbs. His eyes fell upon the grand palace-style pavilions with carved railings and jade-like structures, as well as the towering Tai Nan Mountain Pagoda at the center. A faint smile appeared on his face.

"Tai Nan Small Gathering! Han Lao Mo, Lin Yun is here!"

His gaze swept across the sparse crowd around him. The gathering had just begun, so there weren't many people present yet.

"Before meeting Han Lao Mo, I need to make some preparations," Lin Yun murmured to himself. "Otherwise, given that fellow's cautious nature, making friends with him won't be so simple."

First, he rented a room in one of the palace-style pavilions as his temporary base. Then he began searching the gathering for the items he needed.

"Fellow Daoist, how much for this Eternal Spring Technique?"

"Two spirit stones!"

After spending two spirit stones to acquire the complete version of the Eternal Spring Technique, he continued his search.

"Fellow Daoist, is your 'Qingxi Notes' for sale?"

"One spirit stone!"

"Deal! I'll take it."

Half a month later...

Han Li bid farewell to Wan Xiaoshan and Qingyan Zhenren.

"What a pity to part ways with Brother Xiaoshan like this," Han Li sighed regretfully. "There were still so many things I wanted to ask him."

"Fellow Daoist, please stay!" A clear voice suddenly called out from behind Han Li, startling him.

Han Li turned slowly to see six or seven people standing not far behind him. The speaker was a Daoist cultivator in his twenties—fair-skinned and clean-shaven, with handsome features, sharp eyebrows, and bright eyes. His warm, spring-like smile gave him the refined demeanor of a true gentleman, exuding a gentle and approachable aura that made people instinctively want to get closer to him.

Han Li couldn't help but compare himself—a dark-skinned youth—to this man. The difference was like that between the faint glow of decaying grass and the bright radiance of the moon in the sky.

"Does the Daoist have business with me?" Han Li asked expressionlessly, ignoring the other's question.

After some conversation, Han Li learned from the leading Daoist that this was a temporary group formed by several rogue cultivators to protect themselves from the oppression of clan cultivators. Among them were a couple named Hu Pinggu and Xiong Dali, a pair of twins called Hei Mu and Hei Jin, a young monk known as Master Ku Sang, and an ordinary-looking young woman called Red Lotus.

The Daoist leader extended a jade-like hand toward Han Li with a warm smile. "Fellow Daoist Han, I am Lin Yun. I feel an instant connection with you. Would you be willing to befriend me?"

This Daoist seemed quite dignified and amiable. Han Li used his Heavenly Eye Technique to assess their cultivation levels—most of the others had power equivalent to the seventh or eighth layer of the Eternal Spring Technique. As for Lin Yun (whom he had mistakenly called "Qingwen" earlier), his cultivation was two layers higher than Han Li's, at the tenth level of Qi Refinement.

After some quick consideration, Han Li decided that joining them would be beneficial. "Since we're all rogue cultivators and working together would be advantageous, I, Han Li, will temporarily join your group."

He then cupped his hands in salute to the handsome Daoist leader and offered a small compliment. "Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qingwen—ah, no! Greetings, Brother Lin! It is my honor to make your acquaintance and befriend someone like you."

**[Current friendship level with Han Li: 1 (Casual Acquaintance)]**

Hearing the system's prompt, even the usually composed Lin Yun couldn't help but feel overjoyed.

**[Draw!]**
