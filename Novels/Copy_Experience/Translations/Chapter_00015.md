# Chapter 15: People of the Mo Family

"What did you say? Fellow Daoist He Qing met with misfortune?" Lu Xu's eyes widened in surprise as he looked at Han Erlengzi. For a while now, he had been living a peaceful, uneventful life. Although rumors of rogue cultivators often circulated in the market, they hardly affected his life at all. Because of this, he didn't deeply feel the pressure brought by rogue cultivators; these rumors were like watching news about other countries on TV in his previous life. Yet today, right after returning from the fields, he heard such news. Suddenly hearing of the death of someone familiar, his heart gave a violent lurch.

Han Erlengzi wore a sorrowful expression, his eyes holding fear. He had personally seen He Qing's body that morning. This was a huge shock to him! As a farm boy, when had he ever seen such a sight? Even now, his stomach was churning.

"Brother Lu, do you think we... we might also be..." Han Erlengzi's voice trembled. He tried to calm himself down, but it was impossible. Now, every time he closed his eyes, he would recall He Qing's horrific state, his body dismembered.

"No, we won't. As long as we're careful and don't stray too far from the market!" Lu Xu comforted him. "He Qing ran towards that mortal town. The location of our spiritual fields is safe!"

Lu Xu offered a few words of comfort, but he himself began to feel uncertain. Can the spiritual fields remain safe forever?

"Even a Qi Condensation third-layer cultivator who raises chickens was targeted. Damn them!" Old Man Xu walked in, his face grim. He had just finished handling He Qing's funeral arrangements. Cultivators naturally had no elaborate rituals. Old Man Xu, under the witness of the Mo family cultivators, cremated He Qing's body and scattered his ashes in Qing Lake. He was quite skilled at such tasks. After all, the old man had spent over sixty years in the market, accustomed to its ups and downs.

"Old Xu, what did He Qing's family say?" Lu Xu asked.

"He had no descendants. That mortal woman won't be able to keep the inheritance!" Old Man Xu sighed. "Tomorrow, the Mo family will come to take possession. From now on, let's not go into He Qing's room!" He Qing wasn't like him; he had a cultivator grandson. Even if he died tragically one day, his inheritance wouldn't fall into others' hands. "Sigh! Everyone be careful from now on!" Old Man Xu shook his head, clasped his hands behind his back, and slowly returned to his room.

Lu Xu returned to his room and pondered for a long time: "The things I have on hand aren't enough. I need to get some unconventional items to ensure my safety!"

"I'll have to go ask Fairy Yin for advice again, to see if there's anything unconventional!"

Early the next morning, people from the Mo family arrived. The arrivals were one man and one woman. The man wore a white robe, holding a folding fan, a hint of a frivolous smile on his face. The woman was tall, dressed in a form-fitting black dress, with fair skin and black hair tied into a single ponytail with a red string.

The moment Han Erlengzi saw such a beautiful girl, his dark face immediately flushed red. Head bowed, he dared not look at the two much. Lu Xu and Old Man Xu were more at ease, but facing members of the Mo family, they still felt a sense of apprehension.

"You haven't entered this building, have you?" The white-robed man fanned himself with the folding fan, his gaze sweeping over the three, and asked.

The black-dressed woman remained silent, her cold gaze sweeping back and forth across the courtyard.

"No, after the news came yesterday, none of us three approached this building again!" Old Man Xu immediately replied.

The white-robed man nodded: "This building belongs to our Mo family, and everything in it also belongs to our Mo family! Since that person surnamed He has no descendants, his possessions rightfully belong to our Mo family. If any of you tamper with them, that would be stealing our Mo family's property!" The white-robed man spoke, his gaze coldly sweeping over the three. "You all know what happens when someone steals from the Mo family's property. I don't need to say more!" The frivolous smile reappeared on the white-robed man's face, and a sharp, chilling aura emanated from him.

Han Erlengzi's lips moved, feeling a touch of indignation in his heart. In his opinion, wasn't it robbery for the Mo family to directly take someone's inheritance? How could they have the nerve to say such things to them?

Old Man Xu's voice was calm and steady: "Fellow Daoist is right. It is precisely because we understood this principle that we never dared to approach this building!"

"Good. I hope you truly haven't done anything unpleasant!" The white-robed man smiled lightly, folded his fan, and prepared to enter He Qing's building.

At this moment, the cold voice of the black-dressed woman, who had not spoken until now, rang out: "Did He Qing have any enemies in his daily life?"

Old Man Xu was startled by the question, probably not expecting this fairy from the Mo family to ask about such matters. After a moment of thought, he shook his head: "He Qing was always kind and warm-hearted, never having any enemies!"

"Qingchan, why do you ask this?" the white-robed man turned and asked. Compared to before, his voice suddenly became gentle, making one feel as if bathed in spring breeze.

"He Qing, a mere third-layer Qi Condensation cultivator, was suddenly robbed and killed, and there were even signs of abuse on his body. It doesn't seem like an ordinary robbery and murder! There has never been a precedent of someone with such a low cultivation level being targeted by rogue cultivators before!" The black-dressed woman's cold voice was clear and crisp as breaking jade.

"Perhaps that He… He Qing just accidentally stumbled upon the rogue cultivators' traces, heard some secret, and was silenced! In such a situation, it's normal to have injuries on the body!" The white-robed man shook his head, saying dismissively.

"Perhaps." Seeing that she couldn't glean anything from the three people in the courtyard, the black-dressed woman stopped asking questions.

The two entered the small building, while Lu Xu and the other two waited outside. After about a quarter of an hour, the two walked out. The black-dressed woman's jade-like face remained expressionless, while the white-robed man appeared somewhat displeased.

"Only twenty spirit stones were found in total. Is this all the accumulated wealth he had in his entire life?" He spoke coldly, his gaze chillingly sweeping back and forth over Lu Xu and the other two.

"They found the spirit stones so quickly. These two have extraordinary methods, probably from searching too many homes, huh?" Lu Xu muttered to himself. Storage bags were expensive; even the cheapest cost three hundred spirit stones. No low-level cultivator could afford such a price. Because of this, they couldn't carry all their wealth with them and could only keep it at home. And since they didn't have spirit stones to buy formation arrays to protect their residences, they could only hide their possessions as deeply as possible. Digging holes, creating secret compartments, or in some obscure corner outside the market... They'd make it as concealed as possible! Lu Xu wondered to himself, if he were to break into He Qing's room, he would definitely not be able to find the hidden spirit stones within a short time. Yet these two found them so quickly. Clearly, they had some specialized method.

"He Qing habitually carried most of his spirit stones on him. They must have been robbed by the rogue cultivators!" Old Man Xu quickly said.

"Let's go. We should return and report!" At this moment, the black-dressed woman said, then stepped towards the courtyard exit.

The white-robed man, however, was not in a hurry. After seeing his companion walk out, he sneered: "You say he carried them with him? How can you prove you didn't secretly take a portion?"
