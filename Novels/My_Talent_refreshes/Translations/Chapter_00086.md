# Chapter 86: The Yin Demon Sect

Lin Changqing nodded slightly, then scoffed, "This is indeed an identity token from the Yin Demon Sect of the Dark Abyss Mountain Range."

"Yin Demon Sect!" Hearing Lin Changqing's words, the disciples of Qingxi Sect present gasped in surprise. Although there were occasional frictions and market competitions among the seven sects of Qingxia Mountain Range, overall, they coexisted peacefully. Almost every Qingxi Sect disciple, upon entering the sect, would hear about the infamous Yin Demon Sect from the Dark Abyss Mountain Range. Rumor had it that this sect specialized in evil arts, was brutal and murderous, and had even committed atrocities like massacring entire cities of mortals.

However, since the two mountain ranges were quite distant, with many mortal cities in between, their appearance here was undoubtedly surprising. Now, Lin Changqing was saying that those rogue cultivators were members of the Yin Demon Sect.

"This is a Yin Demon Sect symbol. If Qi Chongmao had this bamboo tablet on him, does that mean he was also from the Yin Demon Sect?" Chu Ning wondered. Hearing Chu Ning's question, the others nearby exchanged glances, their expressions somewhat unnatural. Earlier, they had scoffed at Chu Ning for saying he wouldn't kill demonic beasts.

Du Han, still puzzled, then asked Lin Changqing, "Martial Uncle Lin, how could people from the Yin Demon Sect appear near our Qingxia Mountain Range?"

Lin Changqing's expression grew more serious. "Very strong!" he stated. "It is said that this sect has dozens of Golden Core stage cultivators. None of our seven great sects can compare. If the seven great sects united, we might barely be able to resist."

"What?!" The disciples exclaimed, "It would take seven great sects to unite to resist them?" A collective gasp went through the crowd.

"The people who came are all low-level disciples," Lin Changqing continued, his gaze sweeping over everyone present. "I brought out this token only to remind you all to be vigilant and not go out casually before the sect completes its purge. This matter I have already reported to the sect on my way here, and the Enforcement Hall will be dispatched immediately for a thorough cleansing."

Lin Changqing then said, "You all return first. I still need to learn more from Chu Ning about the market these past few days." He then addressed the supporting Qingxi Sect disciples, "You all stay and rest in the market these next few days. I won't be able to escort you back to the sect because I need to oversee the market. Once other sect members arrive, you can return with them."

"Yes!" Du Han replied, leading the others away. Gu Xiaoqing, Shen Zhengquan, and Luo Yiping all opened their mouths, asking Lin Changqing to help them request supplies from the sect, as they had suffered significant losses during these past few days due to the Yin Demon Sect's interference.

"You've lost a lot for the sect this time. If you need anything supplemented by the various halls of the sect, you can tell me, and I can continue to send messages to have people from the sect bring them over." Lin Changqing said.

After the others had left, Lin Changqing turned to Chu Ning. "What do you have to tell me?"

Chu Ning, seeing the opportunity, immediately sent a sound transmission, "Elder Lin, I have something else to report." He spoke again, "These days, because of the beast disaster, many people in the market bought talismans, and I've accumulated some spirit stones. I want to pay the monthly fee for the talisman shop in advance; keeping it on me isn't safe."

He first pushed 500 spirit stones in front of Lin Changqing, then picked up another 50 spirit stones. "This 50 spirit stones, I'd like to ask for Elder Lin's help." Lin Changqing's coldness in his voice lessened a bit as he silently accepted both sets of spirit stones. He scanned the amount Chu Ning had taken out, getting a rough estimate in his mind. Chu Ning's words also implied that if his spirit field yielded a harvest, he would appropriately give Lin Changqing something.

"The monthly fee for the talisman shop this month should be no problem," Lin Changqing said, the coldness on his face diminishing further. "As for losses, you can go check the spirit field. If there are indeed damages, tell me, and I will report to the sect to request an exemption for this month's monthly fee."

Chu Ning replied, taking out spirit stones from his storage bag. "Elder Lin, the spirit plant shop has basically received no valuable spirit plants these days. And I don't dare to cultivate the twenty acres of spirit field outside; I don't know if it's been damaged. Also, my talisman paper is almost used up because of the high sales recently."

He continued, "Elder Lin, I'd like to ask the sect to bring more talisman paper. If not, Ink Spirit Bamboo or Purple Crystal Bamboo would also work. Furthermore, I travel back and forth between the spirit field and the market. While the distance isn't long, it's inconvenient for low-level disciples if any special situations arise. After all, Wind Control Art is too slow, and escape talismans cannot support long-distance flight. So, I would like to ask Elder Lin to help me find a suitable flying magic tool."

Lin Changqing was slightly surprised looking at Chu Ning. "Looking for a flying magic tool? You're asking me to help you find one, so you probably don't intend to exchange for it within the sect, do you?" He paused slightly, then said to Gu Xiaoqing and the others, who had not yet left, "You all may leave." Gu Xiaoqing and the others left Chu Ning's shop without suspicion.

Lin Changqing immediately waved his hand, "I know about this. Several elders from the sect will be coming in a day or two. The sect might indeed not have very good artifacts because many disciples have been out on missions. But if not, then wait until things stabilize here, and in a few days, I'll take you to Fengxia Market. It's much closer to us than the sect. You can check out Yunhai Pavilion there; they should have artifacts that meet your needs. Multi-person flying artifacts are hard to buy, but single-person ones can be found."

Chu Ning was greatly relieved and expressed his gratitude. He had always wanted a flying magic tool after experiencing the convenience of the elders' spirit boats. Lin Changqing's offer to personally help him choose was the best outcome. Despite earning a significant amount of spirit stones these days, Chu Ning felt he could afford it if the price wasn't too exorbitant.

"This cannot be spoken of to others," Chu Ning inwardly warned himself. He was now almost 100% certain that the Yin Demon Sect had a major conspiracy, given their infiltration even among servant disciples. He recalled Zhuang Yunde's earlier words about Lin Changqing, which had prompted him to cautiously ask.

If Yin Demon Sect members were among the servant disciples, what about the outer disciples, or even these elders? If Qi Chongmao was from the Yin Demon Sect, how could he be in Qingxi Sect? And Lu Yunfang and Luo Hongping, who appeared later, seemed to be looking for Qi Chongmao. Chu Ning felt a chill run down his spine. If the Yin Demon Sect discovered that he had uncovered their infiltration plot, the danger he would face... He now vaguely suspected that those who appeared in the market at night after Du Han and the others left were very likely people from the Yin Demon Sect. Also, the current beast disaster and the appearance of Yin Demon Sect disciples in it—was there a connection? Having a flying artifact, if there truly was danger, would at least provide more assurance for escape.

Lin Changqing walked away after their conversation. Chu Ning returned to his room, a smile on his face. He began to tally his spirit stone earnings from the past few days. He hadn't realized how much he had until he counted it, and it startled him. Even after giving Lin Changqing 550 spirit stones for the monthly fee, Chu Ning still had over 4200 spirit stones.
