# Chapter 177: Diagnosed and Entangled

The inverted ripples of the Li River suddenly froze on his retina.

The woman’s motion of pointing two fingers like a sword was decomposed into seven hundred and twenty frames of images, the trajectory of the sword qi tearing through the air revealed in every minute detail.

Xu Yunfan’s right palm unconsciously touched his chest, feeling the Pure Yang Internal Qi rolling beneath his skin, vibrating along an ancient rhythm. Every inch of muscle fiber emitted a resonance like a Buddhist chant.

A syllable rolling from his throat caused a resonance with heaven and earth.

The originally boiling blood and qi suddenly froze; the knotted back muscles restored their smoothness like a receding tide, and the bulging blue veins turned into faint green patterns beneath the skin.

He lifted his hammer and assumed the starting stance of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method with a precision that was terrifying. The Dazhui acupoint and the tailbone formed a perfect vertical line, the spacing between the five fingers gripping the hammer was exact to the fraction, and even the gravel crushed under his boot soles was distributed by the uniform force in an extremely orderly manner.

The woman stopped her advancing steps for the first time.

“The Seal of Lin?”

A hint of sudden realization finally appeared on her face. The expressionless look changed for the first time, and her words became vivid.

“So you were using the Seal of Lin earlier. I didn’t expect it to be such a clumsy imitation; I really misjudged you.”

“...”

In the instant Xu Yunfan raised his eyes, the sound waves within a radius of ten yards collapsed entirely into his pupils.

He could hear the proliferation of hematopoietic cells deep within his bone marrow and perceive the miniature vortices formed by the Pure Yang Internal Qi in his capillaries.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer lay lightly across his chest as if it weighed nothing; the Qilin head carved on the hammerhead suddenly shed molten golden tears of blood.

“Thousand-Jun, Coiling Dragon Unarm.”

When the hammer technique started, all 206 bones in his body rang out simultaneously like bells and chimes.

The ten-yard sword qi drawn by the woman had not yet fully condensed, but Xu Yunfan had already calculated the weak point caused by the three thousand six hundredth ripple of qi along the sword spine.

The next moment, Xu Yunfan stepped onto the river surface with his foot arch; the water beneath his feet burst like an explosion. The heavy hammer, wrapped in purple lightning, struck the seven-inch position of the ice sword. When the rebound force traveled up the hammer handle into his arm bones, the muscles of his forearm suddenly contracted autonomously by three inches, guiding the destructive residual sword qi into the sole of his foot.

*Boom!*

Amidst the dust of the collapsing green peak, Xu Yunfan closed in with steps as precise as a ruler.

In the state of the Seal of Lin, every muscle fiber of his turned into an independent soldier. The deltoid group was responsible for dissipating the residual sword qi, the psoas major converted the recoil into propulsive kinetic energy, and even the angle of his toes gripping the ground was adjusted thirteen times.

The trajectory of the heavy hammer was as straight as if measured by a ruler; every collision with the ice sword was precisely timed to the moment the woman changed her breath.

The woman’s plain white skirt was stained with scorch marks for the first time.

The sword fingers she held together trembled slightly; the ice sword condensed from the cold water of the Li River was actually covered in spiderweb-like cracks.

Deep within Xu Yunfan’s emotionless pupils, the seven hundred and twenty qi nodes surrounding the woman were currently reflected. It seemed to be a fatal weakness even she herself had not yet noticed.

“Break.”

The heavy hammer suddenly turned into thousands of afterimages. The small cycle of Pure Yang Internal Qi flowing within the flesh and blood beneath the skin began to circulate through the four limbs and hundred meridians.

Xu Yunfan stepped into the Zhen position from the Kun position, pushing his physique to the absolute limit. The unleashed Thousand-Jun force was compressed to the thickness of a hair, and the purple lightning burning on the hammerhead suddenly turned pure white.

The nine layers of ice shields the woman hastily set up shattered one after another. When the hammer edge was only three inches from her brow—

*Crack!*

The absolute rational world constructed by the Seal of Lin collapsed with a *rumble*.

Xu Yunfan suddenly “saw” his flesh and blood could no longer bear such a burden, shattering inch by inch.

The muscles, bones, and skin throughout his body were cracking under the scouring of the Pure Yang Internal Qi.

The cost of surpassing the limit turned into a flame burning his body. In the last moment, he forcefully suppressed the hammer, striving for a sure kill with the final strike.

“Missed?! No, this woman shifted her position!”

The wind of the hammer brushed past the woman’s ear, snapping the green peak thirty yards away, which was inverted into the sea of clouds, in half.

The woman’s frozen sword finger finally tapped onto his throat.

*Whoosh!*

Xu Yunfan suddenly sat up, looking at the residence appearing before his eyes. His tense expression slowly relaxed. But when he looked down, his expression tightened again.

The vest he had hidden in the secret compartment不知什么时候竟然在他身上如往前扎成了马甲，而且绑的严丝合缝，比他先前绑得好上太多.

“...”

He grabbed the Extreme Dao Remnant with his fingers, wanting to take it off, but suddenly paused.

After a long while, he finally let go, his face deep in thought.

Since even the secret compartment couldn't hold it, and the other party could wrap itself around him, struggling further would be useless.

Wanting to borrow a shell to be reborn...

A trace of coldness appeared on Xu Yunfan’s face.

Then let’s see, will you be ridden under my crotch, or will you crawl out of my body?

Gathering his thoughts, Xu Yunfan looked at the interface where the proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method had increased by at least seven points overnight. This martial art, which can only be practiced at the Muscle Refining Realm, allowed him to practice it in his dreams without the fear of his body cracking due to the excessive power of the moves. Instead, he could刷上熟练度 at the External Three Unifications realm, which was absolutely a huge innate advantage.

And the Seal of Lin had also increased by one point of proficiency, causing him to worry slightly while also feeling some joy. He had an impulse in his heart, almost wishing to fight that woman a few more times.

As for the Pure Yang One Qi Art, under his slow guidance, as expected, it was just like yesterday; the Pure Yang Internal Qi was depleted by more than half.

If not replenished in time, once it is sucked dry...

Xu Yunfan dared not imagine what would happen.

Dressing properly, strapping the玄钢机匣 onto his back, and then carrying the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, Xu Yunfan stepped out of the courtyard gate, preparing to leave the city to find a mountain peak to practice the Pure Yang One Qi Art.

The spiritual energy on the mountain peaks outside the city is more abundant. By absorbing a few more particles of Primordial Spirit Qi, he can recover more Pure Yang Internal Qi, so he naturally needs to be attentive.

As soon as he went out, he saw Fu Jin walking over.

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised: “Senior Brother Fu, aren't you supposed to be forging weapons at this time?”

Fu Jin scratched his head, feeling a bit inexplicably: “Early this morning, the Master pulled me out, saying he is going on a long trip to seek mountains and visit friends. He wants me to supervise your forging, not to let your skills slacken. After you finish your martial practice later, remember to come find me. We must forge a sharp-grade weapon today. Junior Brother, you can already forge superior ordinary weapons now. If you work hard, you definitely...”

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred, and he didn't quite hear Fu Jin’s words clearly.

He had a vague guess in his heart: perhaps because of the situation he was in, Zhan Yan had decided to set out on a long journey.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a bit of warmth; some emotions gathered in his chest. He quickly interrupted Fu Jin’s chatter.

“Senior Brother, do you know where the Master went?”

Fu Jin was a bit uncertain: “When I went over, I happened to see the Master packing his bags. He even took out the token of the Divine Weapon Ridge. He might be going to the old site of the Divine Weapon Ridge in Qingzhou. After all, so many years have passed, it's time to find time to...”

Seeing Fu Jin start to ramble on again, Xu Yunfan, having understood the situation, quickly said he was going to practice and hurriedly left.

Senior Brother Fu has been chattering a lot lately, perhaps because he is getting older.
