## Chapter 27: Naivety

Sitting beside Da Niu, Li Zhi Ming asked, "Do you still remember exactly what day it was?" 

Da Niu scratched his head. "I don't remember."

Li Zhi Ming's eyes narrowed. "How many times did he see you?"

"Just once," Da Niu replied.

Li Zhi Ming's breathing quickened. He had been worried that his master might have discovered his secret. 

He asked Da Niu to recall the details of that day. Da Niu furrowed his brow, trying to remember. "I was coming down from the bamboo forest when I saw your master standing among the bamboo. He asked who Da Niu was."

"He pointed at me and told me to step forward, then took me outside to the edge of a cliff, under a tree."

"He asked if I had seen you the day before," Da Niu continued. "He looked serious, but his tone was kind."

"What did you say?" Li Zhi Ming asked, his voice low.

Da Niu chuckled. "I thought maybe you had snuck out and got caught. I told him you came in the afternoon, and we went to a valley to catch fish."

Li Zhi Ming closed his eyes, his face pale. He had only spent a few minutes with Da Niu that day, and now he realized how naive his plan had been.

He asked Da Niu if his master had asked any more questions. "No, that's all," Da Niu replied with a grin. "He left after that, and that's the only time he's come."

Li Zhi Ming let out a deep breath. He was relieved that Da Niu's story had matched his, but he knew his plan had been flawed.

As they walked back, Li Zhi Ming couldn't help but reflect on his actions. He had thought he was clever, but now he saw that his plan had had many holes.

He realized that one small mistake could have serious consequences. He sat down on a cliff, watching the clouds in the distance. He knew he had to learn from his mistakes.

Two things stood out to him: he had been too confident in his details and too reckless in his overall plan.

Li Zhi Ming picked up a stone and threw it into the clouds. A crucial question still lingered in his mind: did his master really not know?
