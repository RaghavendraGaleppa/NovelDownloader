**Chapter 100: Step Aside, Brother—Let Me Handle This**  

On the twelfth day of the eighth month, Zhou Qing had already arrived in the snowy region.  

By now, the rooster Mao Ri had grown strong enough to fly alongside him. As they traveled together, Zhou Qing practiced his Cloud-Parting Palm, further refining his ability to manipulate mist and vapor. His mastery of the technique had already reached an advanced level, bordering on perfection.  

Initially, Zhou Qing could only sustain his flight for a dozen or so miles. But after comprehending the Cloud-Parting Palm, his range extended to several dozen miles. With Mao Ri’s assistance, they could cover hundreds of miles without pause. After brief rests and replenishing his energy with elixirs, he reached the heart of the snowy region within days.  

Along the way, a group of monks hurried toward the Great Snow Mountain. Zhou Qing, however, proceeded at a leisurely pace.  

One of the leading monks, noticing Mao Ri’s extraordinary presence, attempted to purchase the rooster.  

Zhou Qing merely glanced at him.  

The monk, who practiced the Snow Domain’s spiritual arts, felt as though he had been scorched by the sun—his icy resolve melted instantly. He retreated to his group in frustration.  

The other monks bombarded him with questions, wondering why he had suddenly backed off.  

The lead monk, still dazed, muttered, "Thus it should be observed."  

That single glance from Zhou Qing had reminded him of the descriptions of great monks in Buddhist scriptures—those who embodied such profound presence.  

By the time he looked up again, Zhou Qing was already far away.  

"Master Danba, that man seemed to be from the Central Plains. I wonder which sect he belongs to?" one monk asked, realizing they had encountered a true master—no wonder such a magnificent rooster followed him.  

Danba finally snapped out of his trance. "Unfathomable… truly unfathomable…"  

The other monks were stunned. How could a random traveler from the Central Plains evoke such reverence from Master Danba?  

The Central Plains truly bred extraordinary talents—far beyond what the Snow Region could hope to contend with.  

---  

**The Great Hall of Vajra Temple**  

Heroes from all corners of the land had gathered, numbering over two hundred. More continued to arrive, yet the vast hall remained spacious, with ample room to spare.  

At the center, the Vajra Temple’s high lama sat beneath a grand Buddha statue, gripping a steel staff. Though withered and gaunt, no one dared underestimate him—for this monk had tamed the Vajra Mingwang, wielding powers beyond mortal comprehension.  

This battle would determine whether the Snow Region could maintain its standing in the new era.  

"Today, heroes from across the land gather—what a grand occasion," a voice echoed from afar, yet each word rang clearly in the ears of those present, as if a great master were preaching within the hall.  

*Whoosh!*  

A fierce gale swept through the hall, its currents interweaving like cascading waterfalls.  

The crowd gasped as a middle-aged Daoist appeared at the entrance, exuding an immortal aura—none other than the renowned Zhang Zhenren of Mount Taihe, who had attained the Innate Realm and regained his youth.  

"Zhang Zhenren, I await your guidance," the Vajra lama said, wasting no further words. His staff struck the ground.  

*Boom!*  

A thunderclap erupted midair, and a violent gust surged forth.  

The spectators hastily retreated to the sides. In that instant, the lama had transformed into the Vajra Mingwang, his aura undergoing a radical shift.  

Zhou Qing stood unnoticed within the hall, observing the transformation. A thought struck him—*the Demon-Seeding Rebirth Technique.*  

The difference was that while the Grassland’s Martial Saint had used it to refine demonic plants like the Ghost Vine, this lama had fused with a malevolent spirit.  

The underlying principle was the same—both harnessed the power of demons and spirits to achieve supernatural abilities, even using flesh and blood to fuel their cultivation.  

This was the demonic path, yet it granted immense power, allowing practitioners to reach extraordinary heights in a short time.  

One moment, the old monk had the dignified bearing of a holy man; the next, he had shed his human facade, revealing the fangs of the so-called "Mingwang."  

But Zhang Jingxiu had not come unprepared. A pitch-black spear of unknown material appeared in his hand, vibrating with a metallic hum.  

His fist techniques were spear techniques.  

The hall filled with a bone-chilling killing intent.  

Among the gathered experts, many felt their hearts tremble at the sheer force of this aura.  

"People say Zhou Zhenren is a celestial envoy, a prodigy who reached the Innate Realm at a young age. But Zhang Zhenren has dominated the martial world for decades—perhaps he remains the true number one," someone mused.  

Seeing was believing.  

Zhang Jingxiu’s power was so overwhelming that even the Vajra Temple’s red-robed lamas shuddered, fearing their Mingwang might not prevail.  

Yet, the Vajra Mingwang discarded his staff, his exposed skin shimmering with golden light.  

"Vajra!" someone exclaimed in awe.  

To Zhou Qing’s eyes, the old monk no longer carried a trace of life.  

"The esoteric arts of controlling spirits are inferior to those refining demons," Zhou Qing concluded.  

The distinction lay not in the techniques themselves but in their nature—spirits represented death, an insurmountable boundary from life. In contrast, plant-based demons and spirits were still living entities.  

The success of refining a demon depended solely on whose will dominated. Even the Ghost Vine could instinctively parasitize and merge with beasts.  

But the power the Vajra Mingwang now unleashed was terrifying.  

At that moment—  

A tiger’s roar resounded through the hall, its thunderous echoes surging like tidal waves.  

When the crowd turned to Zhou Qing, he no longer resembled a mere man. A tangible tiger’s mantle draped over him, transforming him into a humanoid beast.  

His ferocious aura, combined with the thunderous roar, made him seem like a demon in human form.  

*Was Zhou Qing never human to begin with?*  

Panic spread, but the thunderous sound also shattered the hypnotic effect of the old monk’s chanting.  

Under the tiger’s roar, the shadows surrounding the monk dissipated one by one.  

A humanoid tiger demon.  

A monk turned into a bloodthirsty Asura.  

The spectators felt as though they had stumbled into a nightmare they would never forget.  

Yet, human curiosity kept them rooted in place—terrified but unwilling to miss the outcome.  

As Zhou Qing channeled the *Tiger’s Slaughter Scripture*, the Heartfire Thunder also gathered within him, creating a sensation of water and fire converging.  

The old monk was not weak—he had simply chosen the wrong opponent.  

Both the *Tiger’s Slaughter Scripture* and the Palm Thunder were natural counters to ghostly arts.  

Moreover, the monk had taken a heretical path in soul refinement, focusing on techniques rather than the essence.  

Zhou Qing allowed him to unleash his full power to ensure the Vajra Temple’s legacy would end here.  

Among the spectators, Danba and his group recognized Zhou Qing—the young expert they had encountered on the road was none other than the Central Plains’ foremost prodigy, Zhou Zhenren.  

None had expected Zhang Jingxiu to willingly step aside at Zhou Qing’s word.  

But seeing the two together, the hierarchy became obvious.  

Previously, many had believed Zhang Zhenren held the potential to claim the title of the world’s strongest. Yet, with Zhou Qing present, the answer was clear without comparison.  

The Asura-transformed monk spoke slowly, "Then I ask for your guidance."  

Zhou Qing nodded and transmitted a message to Zhang Jingxiu: *"The Vajra Temple possesses the Red Lotus Annihilation Technique, which can push one’s limits to the extreme. If he uses it now, he may harm your foundation. Leave him to me."*  

Having inherited the martial legacy of the Golden Light Temple—a branch of the Vajra lineage—Zhou Qing understood their arts well. If the monk resorted to the Red Lotus Annihilation Technique with the intent to perish together, even Zhou Qing might not intervene in time.  

In martial duels, determining superiority and fighting to the death were entirely different matters.  

Besides, the old monk was already dead—he had nothing left to fear.  

"Be careful," Zhang Jingxiu replied, knowing Zhou Qing’s intervention was not for glory but necessity.  

Zhou Qing focused entirely on the monk. "To those who wish to witness this battle," he declared calmly, "be prepared to pay with your lives."  

His words were for the audience, yet his gaze never left the monk.  

Even while speaking, his energy remained flawless, revealing no openings.  

An invisible clash of auras erupted between them, sending ripples through the air. The shockwave shredded the clothes of some spectators, forcing many to flee. Only the most confident martial artists remained.  

The red-robed lamas, however, did not retreat—they were offerings to the Mingwang.  

The monk struck out with a palm.  

An unimaginable force erupted, compressing the air until it detonated.  

*Cloud-Parting Palm!*  

A surge of mist met the monk’s strike.  

"What a magnificent *Buddha Hurls the Elephant*," Zhang Jingxiu praised.  

This was one of Buddhism’s Vajra divine techniques, renowned for its overwhelming power. Yet Zhou Qing’s palm strike matched it blow for blow.  

But Zhang Jingxiu could tell—neither had gone all out.  

The monk’s expression, however, shifted noticeably.  

He sensed Zhou Qing’s restraint, yet an invisible energy had already ensnared him like a net.  

The hall trembled as palm strikes collided in rapid succession.  

Zhou Qing’s attacks came in relentless waves, each stronger than the last.  

Zhang Jingxiu watched in awe—the old monk had fallen into a trap.  

Even more impressive was Zhou Qing’s seamless execution. While martial arts had techniques to stack power, sustaining over a dozen consecutive strikes was something even Zhang Jingxiu, as an Innate Realm expert, could not achieve under optimal conditions.  

Yet Zhou Qing made it look effortless.  

"Just where is his limit now?" Zhang Jingxiu wondered.  

Even at the second level of Body Refinement, he could not fathom Zhou Qing’s full strength. The synergy of *qi*, body, and spirit was beyond his current comprehension.  

The old monk, despite his undead state, coughed up blood under Zhou Qing’s assault, his demonic aura dimming.  

Zhou Qing withdrew his palm and stood with hands behind his back. "Is this all? Show me everything you have."  

The fusion of man and spirit granted extraordinary power, but it was not enough to challenge Zhou Qing.  

He wanted to see more.  

"It is not enough," the monk admitted weakly, rising unsteadily. "The Vajra Temple falls today."  

He chanted an incantation.  

Flames erupted from the red-robed lamas, their blood and essence surging toward him like fiery streams. Their bodies shriveled into empty husks, collapsing onto the floor.  

All two hundred lamas had been reduced to fuel for the monk’s power.  

The esoteric arts of offering flesh to spirits had turned the lamas into sacrifices for the "Mingwang." Their lifeless faces bore serene smiles, as if death were liberation.  

The world was a prison—death, the escape.  

Offering their flesh to the Mingwang was akin to ascending to paradise.  

Shadows of the fallen lamas swirled around the monk, as though granted new life.  

Flesh was transient—why cling to it?  

Though this was a horrifying demonic ritual, the lamas’ peaceful expressions evoked a twisted sense of enlightenment.  

The monk’s chanting continued, its hypnotic pull ensnaring the remaining spectators, luring them closer.  

Then—  

Another tiger’s roar shattered the illusion.  

The thunderous sound jolted the crowd awake.  

Zhou Qing, now fully clad in his tiger mantle, stood as a humanoid beast, his aura overwhelming.  

The spectators wavered between terror and fascination, unable to tear themselves away.  

As Zhou Qing channeled the *Tiger’s Slaughter Scripture*, the Heartfire Thunder surged within him, merging water and fire.  

The old monk was not weak—he had simply chosen the wrong foe.  

Both the scripture and the thunder were natural counters to ghostly arts.  

Moreover, the monk’s heretical path had neglected the essence of soul refinement.  

Zhou Qing had allowed him to unleash his full power to ensure the Vajra Temple’s demise.  

Danba’s group now recognized Zhou Qing as the Central Plains’ foremost genius.  

None had expected Zhang Jingxiu to yield so readily.  

But seeing them side by side, the hierarchy was undeniable.  

The Asura-monk spoke again, "Then I ask for your guidance."  

Zhou Qing nodded.  

The final clash was imminent.
