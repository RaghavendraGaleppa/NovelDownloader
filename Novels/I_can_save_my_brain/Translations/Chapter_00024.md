# Chapter 24: The Purple Mansion Heavenly Prides Ranking  

"Is that Zhou Mubai?"  

The name Zhou Mubai was as thunderous to Chen Daoxuan as it was to everyone else.  

Not just him—Zhou Mubai was a name renowned throughout Guang'an Prefecture and even among the younger generation of cultivators in the entire Wanxing Sea.  

He had formed his Foundation at the age of twenty-one and, within less than fifty years, broke through to the Purple Mansion stage, becoming a Purple Mansion cultivator before even reaching a hundred years old.  

It was worth noting that Purple Mansion cultivators had a lifespan of five hundred years.  

This meant Zhou Mubai had over four hundred years to attempt a breakthrough to the Golden Core stage.  

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Zhou Mubai had an extremely high chance of reaching Golden Core, earning him the reputation as the most promising candidate in Guang'an Prefecture to become a Golden Core True Person in the last five hundred years.  

But that wasn't all.  

Zhou Mubai's true claim to fame was his ranking on the Wanxing Sea's *Purple Mansion Heavenly Prides Ranking*.  

The *Purple Mansion Heavenly Prides Ranking* was one of the lists established by the Qian Yuan Sword Sect to counter the forces of the Chuyun Kingdom.  

The complete ranking system consisted of three tiers: the *Foundation Establishment Hidden Dragons Ranking*, the *Purple Mansion Heavenly Prides Ranking*, and the *Golden Core True Persons Ranking*.  

From Chen Daoxuan's perspective, the Qian Yuan Sword Sect had simply capitalized on cultivators' desire for fame.  

In the Wanxing Sea, the largest group of cultivators were the rogue cultivators, followed by the disciples of various cultivation clans.  

Although the Qian Yuan Sword Sect ruled over the Wanxing Sea, it couldn't simply command all cultivators to charge into battle without incentive.  

Thus, the sect devised a method to lure cultivators to the battlefield using both fame and profit.  

The Chen Clan of Twin Lakes Island had exchanged their battle merits with the Qian Yuan Sword Sect for inheritance manuals on artifact forging, methods to construct earth-fire chambers, and even sword techniques like *Gale Sword Art* and *Rainstorm Sword Art*—all of which fell under the category of "profit."  

As for the *Purple Mansion Heavenly Prides Ranking*, it belonged to the realm of "fame."  

What did cultivators seek in their path of cultivation?  

Foremost, of course, was immortality!  

However, this world hadn't seen a Great Ascension True Immortal ascend to the higher realms in hundreds of thousands of years.  

For most cultivators, the idea of achieving immortality was nothing more than a distant dream.  

Beyond immortality, the second greatest pursuit of cultivators was longevity.  

And to achieve longevity, one couldn't escape the need for cultivation techniques and resources.  

Yet most of these resources were monopolized by the great cultivation clans of the Wanxing Sea and the Qian Yuan Sword Sect.  

For ordinary cultivators to obtain large amounts of resources, their only options were to either wrest them from the hands of these powers or earn them through battle merits on the frontlines.  

Once cultivators achieved longevity, they couldn't simply live empty lives, cultivating day after day without purpose.  

Naturally, they would begin pursuing other things—beauty, material pleasures, and, most importantly, reputation!  

In the cultivation world, the higher a cultivator's rank, the more they tended to value their reputation.  

The three rankings introduced by the Qian Yuan Sword Sect perfectly catered to this desire for fame.  

Using both "fame" and "profit" as weapons, the sect had effectively bound the entire Wanxing Sea's cultivators to its war chariot.  

Over the past four hundred years, the Qian Yuan Sword Sect had driven this chariot recklessly across the Immortal Cloud Continent, wreaking havoc upon the Chuyun Kingdom.  

Even from Chen Daoxuan's modern perspective, the sect's leader was an extraordinary figure.  

As he gazed at the white-robed Zhou Mubai standing effortlessly in the air at the frontlines, Chen Daoxuan remained relatively composed. After all, he was much younger than Zhou Mubai, and in terms of potential, he believed he was no less formidable.  

In contrast, Wei Sihai and Chen Xianhe beside him wore expressions of melancholy.  

Both were nearing a hundred years of age, yet their cultivation was worlds apart from that distant white figure in the sky.  

As cultivators of the same generation, it was impossible for them not to feel something.  

But the gap between them was simply too vast—so vast that they couldn't even muster the emotion of envy.  

Only they could truly understand the bitterness of such a realization.  

While everyone was lost in their thoughts, the battle at the frontlines had already begun.  

However, due to the immense distance, Chen Daoxuan and the others couldn't extend their spiritual senses far enough to perceive the fight. Even with their eyes, they couldn't keep up with the speed of the battle.  

All they could see were flashes of sword light and the constant roar of clashes in the distance.  

To think that at this level of combat, they didn't even qualify as spectators.  

Feeling the aftershocks of the battle, Chen Daoxuan sighed.  

Thankfully, they were positioned far enough away.  

He even noticed that the first row of ships had been completely destroyed by the shockwaves of Zhou Mhibai's battle with the high-level merman.  

The onlookers, looking as if they'd seen a ghost, fled in panic.  

Within a ten-mile radius centered on Zhou Mubai and the merman, not a single soul dared to approach.  

Finally, with a sword light stretching hundreds of feet, the high-level merman fled, wounded, and the entire merman tribe scattered in retreat.  

Another Purple Mansion cultivator from the Zhou Clan was about to give chase when the pale-faced Zhou Mubai stopped him.  

"Third Granduncle, there's no need to pursue."  

"Mubai, are you alright?"  

Seeing Zhou Mubai's pallid complexion, the elder he addressed as "Third Granduncle" grew visibly anxious.  

Zhou Mubai was the most talented cultivator of the Zhou Clan's younger generation.  

Not only had he broken through to the Purple Mansion stage at a young age, but he was also a sword cultivator who had comprehended Sword Intent while still at the Foundation Establishment stage!  

This was the primary reason Zhou Mubai ranked on the *Purple Mansion Heavenly Prides Ranking*—he was a sword cultivator, rarer even than a Heavenly Spirit Root holder!  

Now, Zhou Mubai seemed injured.  

How could the elder not be furious?  

With this in mind, the elder couldn't help but chide, "Mubai, why bother with one-on-one duels against these foreign races? If we had joined forces just now, we could have captured him without you getting hurt!"  

After the reprimand, his expression softened with concern. "How bad is the injury?"  

"Third Granduncle, don't worry. It's just a minor wound."  

Zhou Mubai shook his head. "Our Zhou Clan captures mermen every year, and the merman race already resents us deeply. If we had broken the rules and killed that high-level merman today, there would have been no room for reconciliation between our families."  

"So what if there's no reconciliation? Since when does our Zhou Clan fear a mere merman race?"  

The Third Granduncle scoffed in disdain.  

Seeing his attitude, Zhou Mubai hesitated but ultimately shook his head and remained silent.  

It wasn't just the Third Granduncle—the entire Zhou Clan believed they were invincible within a hundred-thousand-mile radius, looking down on everyone else.  

Zhou Mubai knew this mindset was dangerous for the clan.  

In recent years, the Yang Clan and several other Foundation Establishment families had grown increasingly distant from the Zhou Clan.  

He had even heard rumors that the Yang Clan was secretly uniting other Foundation Establishment families to establish another immortal city, hoping to rival the flourishing Guang'an Immortal City.  

However, due to disputes over profit distribution and fear of the Zhou Clan's might, the alliance had yet to make significant progress.
