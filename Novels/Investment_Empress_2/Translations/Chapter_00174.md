# Chapter 174: Sword City of the Horizontal Clouds

“What does it mean to carry one’s hobbies forward to their fullest potential?”

Li Mo leaned back in his seat, feigning a tactical retreat.

A faint ripple came from the World Seed.

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer was protesting.

Recently, Li Mo had been focusing entirely on sword practice, neglecting the hammer completely. The little hammer felt wronged, its killing intent whining as it vibrated.

“Once there’s a hammer-testing conference in the future, a hammer to test the world, I’ll let you show your true might!” Li Mo promised earnestly.

Satisfied with the empty promise, the little hammer stopped making a fuss.

Li Mo felt a slight pang in his conscience.

It’s human nature not to cherish what comes too easily...

As he pondered this, Li Mo went to change clothes. It was the robe made for him by Chu Long. The craftsmanship was a bit amateurish, but it was made with great care and high-quality fabric.

“Honestly, if I say I’m a swordsman, who would dare object?”

Li Mo looked at himself in the mirror with satisfaction and pushed the door open.

As soon as he stepped out, he saw Jiang Chu Long crouching by the courtyard gate, hugging her knees. Several dirty stray cats surrounded her, eating the leftovers she had left for them.

Hearing footsteps behind her, she turned around and was momentarily stunned.

“Li... Li... Li Big Brother... You’re wearing...”

“Does it look good?”

Li Mo stood before her, smiling.

“It’s... like the sun itself.”

Through her blindfold, one could see Chu Long’s dazed eyes reflecting the high spirits of the young man.

“Haha, where did you learn such a phrase?”

“I heard them praise... the Emperor... with those words...”

Chu Long secretly stole glances.

Finally unable to resist, she reached out her small hand to smooth out the wrinkles on Li Mo’s lapel.

“Thank you.”

Li Mo rubbed her head.

“Mmm...”

Chu Long opened her mouth but found herself short of breath.

Just thinking about Li Mo making a name for himself in this outfit made her head feel dizzy.

Was this how the customers at the restaurant felt when they drank too much?

But she hadn’t drunk any wine...

“It’s about time I bought you some new clothes,” Li Mo noticed that the little princess was still wearing the clothes he had worn when running the hotpot restaurant.

“No... no need... I’m very happy just wearing this,” Chu Long shook her head quickly, pinching the hem of her skirt.

“We can go shopping together when we have time. Cloud Prefecture City is so prosperous; there might be something you like.”

“Go shopping... with Li Big Brother?”

Chu Long murmured to herself, seemingly picturing the scene.

Li Mo couldn’t help but smile.

Soon, the Senior Brothers and Sisters got up. Ouyang handed Li Mo a stack of silver bills, saying it was the dividend from the picture book.

Li Mo glanced at it and realized the denominations were all one thousand taels.

“‘The霸道女帝愛上我 (The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me)’ is this profitable?”

“That’s just the fee for the first issue,” Ouyang said, raising his head and chest, his嘴角 harder to suppress than an AK-47, his voice much louder. “Li Shidi, you and Shimei Ying Bing are my衣食父母 (bread and butter)!”

“.....”

Li Mo just realized that the frequent investment feedback of ‘Youth-Keeping Pill’ was all from Senior Brother Ouyang.

No wonder.

At that moment, a room door opened.

The rented courtyard fell silent.

Ice Cube walked out with her sword. The black feathered robe added a touch of mystery to her noble aura.

How to put it.

Everyone present was a distinguished figure, but standing next to her, they looked like bodyguards.

If judging by aura and appearance, the Jiuzhou Summit wouldn’t even need to be held; they could just give her the title of Sword Hero directly...

“You guys, not leaving?” Ying Bing asked, turning back at the door.

Little Li froze. “Ice Cube, I have a question.”

“Doesn’t it get hot wearing fur in the summer?”

“.....”

Ying Bing’s gaze swept over a certain someone’s buttocks, then she boarded the carriage directly.

It was Jiang Chu Long who whispered, “Li Big Brother... that’s not... not fur...”

...

The streets were bustling with traffic and noise.

The Clear Abyss Sect’s group was not particularly eye-catching among them.

Not only was the ground lively, but the sky was also far from peaceful.

Some rode giant eagle-like beasts across the sky, while others, who practiced certain aerial martial arts, walked on their swords—utterly unrestrained and elegant.

In terms of their entrance, it was truly a case of the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their divine powers.

“The one who just arrived on his sword should be one of the Three Heroes of the Horizontal Clouds, Wu Chushu, right?”

“It should be him.”

“That’s strange, doesn’t he live inside the Sword City? Why did he fly in from outside?”

“He’s a real swordsman; don’t question the ways of a great hero.”

“If you could walk on a sword, you could do it too.”

...

Discussions came from the surrounding crowd, filled with intense longing and envy.

“If only I didn’t have to write...”

Li Mo sighed. In his Eyes of Providence, he saw the image of Wu Chushu flying away on his sword.

He lowered his head and continued writing in his little notebook.

【Name: Wu Chushu】
【Age: 25】
【Bone Constitution: Ten Thousand Flowers Sword Bone】
【Realm: Six Apertures of Divine Observation】
【Destiny: Blue with a hint of Purple】
【Evaluation: Second Seat of the Sword City of the Horizontal Clouds in Langya Prefecture. Youngly ranked 74th on the Hidden Dragon List, known as the Gentleman of Ten Thousand Flowers.】
【Recent Event: Challenged Ying Bing to restore the Sword City’s reputation, but his Sword Dao heart was damaged, giving birth to a heart demon.】

“.......”

Li Mo paused as he wrote this.

He suddenly didn’t envy the other party anymore.

He even felt a bit of sympathy.

Even if his Lonely Nine Swords reached minor or major completion, he had no confidence in defeating Ice Cube. The only time he won with a sword was because of her... flaw. After that, he never saw her have a flaw again.

Shaking his head, he continued recording.

Worthy investment targets among the martial artists were all recorded in his ledger.

There were those like Wu Chushu who were already famous, and also those who were obscure but possessed great strength.

*Thud—*

Suddenly, Li Mo’s eyes sharpened.

It was a young man riding a beast horse, with an ordinary appearance and an unremarkable aura.

But in the Eyes of Providence, he was anything but ordinary.

【Name: Huang Donglai】
【Age: 25】
【Bone Constitution: None】
【Realm: Five Apertures of Divine Observation】
【Destiny: Blue with a hint of Purple】
【Evaluation: Possesses a strange pearl that can analyze and deconstruct various martial arts. Has a steady and low-key personality. Practiced diligently in a small county town for ten years before gaining the confidence to venture out.】
【Recent Event: His first battle after leaving his hometown was against Jiang Chu Long. He felt he was too weak and ran back to the small county town to train harder...】

Li Mo: “.....”

A Sword God of the Ten-Mile Slope.

You call that steady? You should have exchanged a few more blows with others before turning back.

After recording for a while, Li Mo unconsciously said, “There are quite a few geniuses in our Eastern Wilderness Region.”

“There are,” Ying Bing said softly, holding Tian Frost.

“That’s strange.”

“It is the former capital of the Great Shang Dynasty.”

“That makes sense.”

Li Mo thoughtfully nodded.

It was understandable that the once-prosperous land of the dynasty, though now declined, would still produce outstanding talents.

Not long after, they arrived at the gate of the Sword City of the Horizontal Clouds.

Located by the mountains and rivers, the place featured ten martial stages.

An old man carrying a sword first cupped his hands to everyone, then said, “Once you step onto the stage, you are the Stage Master. Anyone may challenge them. The victor takes the place.”

“Three days later, those still standing on the stages will have passed the Sword Trial.”
