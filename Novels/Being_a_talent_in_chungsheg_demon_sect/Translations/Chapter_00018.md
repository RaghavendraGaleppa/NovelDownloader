Chapter 18: The Correct Use of the Cheat

"A predecessor's cave mansion?"

After hearing Zhao Xuhe's suggestion, Lu Yang shook his head. "Senior Brother's invitation is tempting, but my divine abilities are not proficient. Right now, I only wish to cultivate wholeheartedly."

"Oh?" Zhao Xuhe narrowed his eyes upon hearing this. "Is Junior Brother perhaps distrusting me?"

"Senior Brother worries too much. It's just that I haven't learned any divine abilities yet and possess no combat prowess. Even if I were to accompany Senior Brother, I would only be a burden."

Lu Yang's reason was sound.

After all, he had only recently joined the sect and immediately began speculating on Substitute Death Yin Puppets, even mortgaging cultivation methods from the Scripture Depository. Zhao Xuhe was well aware of this.

"...In that case, forget it."

Zhao Xuhe shook his head, his expression growing cold.

At this moment, killing intent had already arisen in his heart. After all, he had lost everything, even his pants, while Lu Yang managed to make a profit and exit early.

How could he accept this?

More importantly, the contribution points Lu Yang earned were originally borrowed from him. Rounding up, all that money should have been his!

"Fine, let it be temporarily stored with you," Zhao Xuhe sneered internally. "Only knowing cultivation and not practicing combat divine abilities? Does he think he's in some renowned orthodox sect where he can cultivate peacefully? Once I resolve the matter on Dragon-Coil Island, I'll find an opportunity to sneak into his cave mansion at night, eliminate him, and those contribution points will still be mine!"

"As expected, Zhao must already be plotting against me."

Leaving Zhao Xuhe's cave mansion, Lu Yang swaggered towards the Scripture Depository. He had already guessed Zhao Xuhe's intentions but felt no panic whatsoever.

After all, he hadn't wasted the past few days.

While others were fervently speculating on Substitute Death Yin Puppets, he paid no heed to outside affairs, buying large quantities of spirit pills and immediately entering secluded cultivation.

Qi Condensation stages four to six were considered mid-stage, with no bottlenecks. One could break through simply by spending money and consuming pills.

And Lu Yang, who had earned a whopping ten thousand contribution points, naturally wasn't stingy. Thus, he had already broken through to Qi Condensation stage six, reaching the peak of the mid-stage.

On a side note, the venereal disease that his original body carried was also cured by a Cleansing Pill he exchanged with contribution points.

It truly proved that the greatest incurable disease in a person's life was poverty.

The reason Yu Suzhen in his first life died from her venereal disease was ultimately because she lacked money.

As for the mid-stage bottleneck, he had originally wanted to try breaking through with Innate Primordial Qi, but unfortunately, perhaps due to insufficient quantity, the effect was negligible.

This showed that Liu Xin probably didn't just scheme against him in his past life.

As for his claim of not practicing divine abilities, that was naturally just to deceive Zhao Xuhe.

In his previous life, he relied on array formations and sneak attacks to barely suppress Zhao Xuhe when the latter was exhausted and weakened. This life, however, he wouldn't need such trouble.

Even in a direct confrontation, he was confident he could escape!

"Senior Brother Wang, how have you been lately?"

Upon arriving at the Scripture Depository, Lu Yang skillfully pulled out a wine gourd and chuckled, "This is top-grade Drunken Flower Brew, specially acquired for Senior Brother."

"...It's you again, you brat."

At the entrance of the Scripture Depository, Wang Bairong, looking aged, twitched the corner of his eye upon hearing this, then sighed with emotion, "A single gourd of Drunken Flower Brew costs 50 contribution points."

"You brat truly made a fortune."

In this life, Lu Yang had deliberately built a good relationship with Wang Bairong.

Initially, Wang Bairong had been indifferent to him, but ever since the Substitute Death Yin Puppet market collapsed, this aged Senior Brother of the Scripture Depository had treated him much better.

The reason was simple.

Just before the Substitute Death Yin Puppet market went bust, Lu Yang had persuaded Wang Bairong to sell a portion of the goods he had stockpiled, thus helping him avoid financial ruin.

Since then, Wang Bairong had been immensely grateful to him.

"It's a pity this old man has lived in vain for decades and still doesn't see things as clearly as you, a mere youth. If you hadn't enlightened me, I might have suffered cultivation deviation by now."

"Nonsense, Senior Brother should not belittle himself."

Lu Yang shook his head. "As the saying goes, 'Good advice falls on deaf ears for those doomed.' That day, I advised many people, but only Senior Brother truly listened. Senior Brother's ability to halt at the brink of danger is also a form of wisdom."

"Hmm."

Wang Bairong narrowed his eyes and stroked his beard upon hearing this. Although he knew Lu Yang was deliberately flattering him, these words sounded increasingly pleasant to his ears.

Immediately after, the two set up chairs and a table and began drinking.

Wang Bairong didn't stand on ceremony, pouring a full cup of Drunken Flower Brew and downing it in one gulp. Only then did he slowly speak, "You brat, what exactly do you want?"

This was the only question in Wang Bairong's mind at the moment.

"We're not related by blood or kinship. Do you truly believe the rumors outside, that this old man is a master of the Scripture Depository, waiting for someone fated?"

"How could that be?"

Lu Yang poured wine for Wang Bairong while smiling, "As the saying goes, 'An old person in the family is like a treasure.' I simply feel that Senior Brother, having lived to such an age in the Sacred Sect, must possess some remarkable abilities. And being in charge of the Scripture Depository, perhaps you could offer me some guidance on cultivation methods and divine abilities..."

Lu Yang's words were exceedingly sincere.

Wang Bairong listened without comment, simply continuing to pour wine. As he drank, he began complaining about the Sacred Sect's shameless act of exploiting its disciples this time.

"They're practically beasts!"

"It's no coincidence; they suppressed the prices just as they reached their peak. This was definitely premeditated. There are bad people among the Sacred Sect's higher-ups!"

Lu Yang poured wine and casually agreed.

Only after Wang Bairong had drunk a lot and started swaying did Lu Yang quietly say, "Senior Brother, I came this time to select cultivation methods and divine abilities. Does Senior Brother have any recommendations? The more powerful the divine ability, the better!"

"I knew you brat had something to ask of me!" Wang Bairong chuckled, feeling pleased. "But asking me, you've certainly asked the right person!"

Lu Yang quickly cupped his hands. "Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."

"First of all, don't even think about true high-grade divine abilities. Our Scripture Depository is merely a branch of Heaven-Mending Peak. The cultivation methods and divine abilities here are limited in power."

"Truly powerful divine abilities are all on Sacred Fire Cliff, only accessible to True Disciples!"

"But this is normal. We, these Qi Condensation early and mid-stage disciples, are just the Sacred Sect's draft animals. How could we be taught powerful divine abilities?"

After all, what's the point of draft animals knowing too much? Knowing too much would only be detrimental to unity.

As for True Disciples, they are truly part of the Sacred Sect's official ranks, elites who will inherit the sect's mantle in the future, so naturally, they receive different treatment.

"Is there no compromise?" Lu Yang whispered.

"Of course there is!"

Wang Bairong smiled slightly. He had worked in the Scripture Depository for over forty years. With such seniority, there wasn't a single cultivation method or divine ability in the depository he didn't know.

While he didn't know their specific contents, he understood perfectly well what their effects would be once cultivated.

"In our Scripture Depository, if we're talking about divine abilities that are truly powerful once cultivated, there are actually only three, and each one comes with severe side effects."

"Side effects?"

At this point, Wang Bairong's expression grew incredibly solemn. He said gravely, "For instance, I know of a divine ability called 'Heavenly Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light.' It greatly increases the power of a magical treasure by sacrificing one's own body to it. However, upon completion, not only does it shorten one's lifespan, but it also renders further cultivation impossible, essentially severing one's path to immortality."

"Tell me, aren't the side effects severe?"

Wang Bairong's original intention was to deter Lu Yang, but to his surprise, after hearing his warning, Lu Yang showed no disappointment whatsoever. Instead, he became even more excited.

"Such a divine ability is perfectly suited for my use!"

Although the side effects were indeed severe, they were only limited to this life. And what did the side effects of this life have to do with the me of the next life?

He seemed to have found the correct way to use the [Hundred Lives Tome]!
