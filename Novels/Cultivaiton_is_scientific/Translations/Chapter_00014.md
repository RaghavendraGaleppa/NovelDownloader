# Chapter 14: Immortal's Fall (Happy May Day!)

Ge Tianqing's figure flashed as he appeared beside Junior Sister Zheng, his low-grade hammer artifact descending heavily toward her.

Panic seized Junior Sister Zheng's heart, revealing the flaw in her coordination with Senior Brother Zhao. Had they advanced and retreated together, Ge Tianqing would never have found this opening. 

Her thoughts scattered—she wanted to recall her low-grade hairpin artifact, retrieve a defensive talisman from her storage pouch, and simultaneously increase spiritual energy infusion into her small defensive shield. This frantic multitasking left her momentarily paralyzed.

This wasn't entirely her fault. Having experienced little combat within the sect, even during missions she'd always relied on fellow disciples' support. This sheltered existence was precisely why she'd managed to save enough spirit stones for a Spirit Gathering Plate.

But insufficient skill bore bitter fruit in real combat. Her panic caused the small shield to barely block the hammer's strike—a low-grade artifact driven by a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator's power shattered her defense instantly. The hammer slammed into her body with devastating force.

Junior Sister Zheng shuddered violently as the hammer's late-stage Qi Refining energy extinguished her life force in an instant.

"Junior Sister!" Senior Brother Zhao roared in fury.

Abandoning all restraint, he slapped his waist and produced a mid-grade attack talisman. Channeling spiritual energy, he activated it, sending a streak of flame hurtling toward Ge Tianqing.

Ge Tianqing snatched Junior Sister Zheng's storage pouch, then immediately detected the incoming attack. Without hesitation, he hurled his hammer artifact toward the talisman's flames while producing a crimson talisman. Spitting a mouthful of heart's blood onto it, the talisman transformed into a bloody light that carried him far into the distance.

Senior Brother Zhao, having activated the talisman, merged his body with his mid-grade sword artifact in pursuit. As a sect disciple, he possessed numerous unutilized techniques—had he pinned Ge Tianqing down, the rogue cultivator would have been doomed.

But he hadn't anticipated the rogue's ruthlessness—detonating his primary artifact while activating a rare Blood Escape Talisman. As Senior Brother Zhao charged forward, he encountered the exploding hammer.

The self-destruction of a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator's long-nurtured artifact unleashed terrifying power. Even Ge Tianqing likely didn't anticipate the full magnitude as he fled without looking back.

Senior Brother Zhao's mid-grade defensive talisman had already been broken by Ge Tianqing's earlier barrage of low-grade talismans, and even his mid-grade turtle-shell artifact showed cracks. The hammer's explosion shattered it completely.

Miraculously, the turtle-shell absorbed most of the blast, and Senior Brother Zhao's sword artifact helped deflect the remainder, preventing instant death. His body flew through the air like ragged cloth before crashing onto the street.

Gritting through pain, he swallowed a pill from his storage pouch, then staggered up. After collecting Junior Sister Zheng's remains, he summoned a small flying boat—not his own, but borrowed from the sect for this mission.

As the vessel soared skyward powered by spirit stones, stability finally allowed him to relax. He vomited blood laced with organ fragments, his face turning deathly pale. The immediate escape was necessary—the close-range explosion had inflicted grave injuries. Had the rogue returned, he'd have been defenseless.

Both cultivators departed, leaving only devastation—shattered streets, ruined buildings, and debris scattered by spiritual energy. Beyond the moans of wounded, terrified survivors remained silent until lanterns and approaching footsteps encouraged cautious investigation.

Li Wenyuan was roused from sleep by a servant's urgent summons to the scene. Li Shiming, still attempting spiritual perception rather than sleeping, heard the commotion.

"What happened now, Mo Yan?" Li Shiming asked his attendant while dressing.

"The Temple Front Street battle—witnesses say the destruction resembles the garden incident," Mo Yan replied nervously. The garden explosion had terrified the household, and now another catastrophe struck.

Li Shiming knew the two events differed—no one else in this world could reproduce nitroglycerin's effects. This pointed conclusively to cultivator conflict.

"Send two matrons to check if our guests remain in the courtyard," he ordered. The experienced matrons could investigate discreetly, unlike the obvious Mo Yan.

Unable to sleep, Li Shiming waited in his father's office. The matrons soon reported—the guests were gone. This confirmed the incident involved the cultivators.

"Father," Li Shiming supported the exhausted magistrate as he entered.

"Age catches up. In my youth, I could patrol levees for days without fatigue," Li Wenyuan sighed, massaging his legs. Li Shiming had prepared ginseng soup in anticipation.

"Our cultivator guests have disappeared," Li Shiming reported.

"Witnesses saw the battle—the female immortal died, while the male and their enemy fled," Li Wenyuan revealed gravely.

"The Ministry of Personnel's evaluation this year will be problematic," Li Shiming worried. The annual assessment critically impacted official promotions.

"Don't fret over evaluations. I've no intention of returning to the capital anyway," Li Wenyuan smiled wryly.
