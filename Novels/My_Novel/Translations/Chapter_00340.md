Chapter 340: Leaving the Dragon's Lair

Wen Caixiang was knowledgeable and well-versed in various disciplines. The paths within the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Cave were complex, concealing many strange and hidden trails. The Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Cave resembled the heart aperture of the world, with its Feng Shui akin to the world's blood essence. Every time the dragon heart pulsed, it would suck in external Feng Shui, flooding the heart cavity, before surging it back out.

By following this principle and observing the vegetation, moss, plants, stone erosion, and the manifestation of earth veins along the way, one could discern the direction of the Feng Shui flow. Following the flow, there were countless ways out.

The Five Mountains Sword Alliance had considerable knowledge, but since they were not versed in this path or Feng Shui, they could not achieve such a feat. Wen Caixiang observed the wind and water, stepping onto a quiet, narrow path with Li Xian. The path was densely vegetated, the mountain walls were mottled, and there were yellowish, strange stones.

Observing many details, Wen Caixiang told Li Xian that this path was correct. She flipped her sleeve and drew her sword, scraping off a yellowish strange stone. Under the light of a fire, it radiated a halo. The climate in Flying Dragon City was cold, and the Feng Shui catalyzed on the high mountain walls would nurture the strange stone "Golden Light Stone." This stone could be used for construction and ornaments, and its value was not particularly high. However, when countless strange stones accumulated, forming layers of golden light, it was breathtaking and eye-catching.

This was the origin of the "Sunlight on Golden Peak" phenomenon in Flying Dragon City. Wen Caixiang told Li Xian that precisely because the dragon heart pulsed, drawing the Feng Shui from the mountaintop into the earth cavity, and through long-term evolution and catalysis, this place also nurtured this strange stone. 'Feng Shui' is a flowing thing; where there is an entrance, there is an exit. This proves that this path can lead out.

Wen Caixiang taught, "If it were other tomb treasures, there wouldn't be so many escape routes. But the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Cave is like a heart buried deep in the earth. When activated, the earth veins vibrate, and combined with the circulation of Feng Shui and long-term erosion, many strange and hidden paths lead to the outside. However, the builders of the tomb would specifically set up mechanisms on similar paths, making people think they are dead ends."

"If one's mastery of Feng Shui miscellaneous studies surpasses that of the solitary Duyuan Bo, and can avoid these traps in advance, one can enter and exit freely."

The path was circuitous, but with Wen Caixiang leading the way personally, there was no danger. The scenery was pleasant, and there were no others to disturb them. The two walked slowly along the way, with music and interest, color and taste, desire and affection, endless joy.

[You practiced the three-layer sword technique, the Yang Sword sheathed, its锋芒 exposed, proficiency +1]

[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword · Third Layer]

[Proficiency: 6125/8000 Minor Accomplishment]

It is said there are no shortcuts to practicing the sword; only through thousands of draws and thousands of sheaths. Li Xian had reached the "Great Self" realm in the first and second layers, and was now slowly progressing in the third layer, with endless joy.

Wen Caixiang deeply understood this joy; this tomb path had a different kind of flavor. She felt love, hate, anger, and shame towards Li Xian. After several days like this, they still hadn't seen the tomb's exit, but green grass was visible on the ground, and there were occasional pools of water.

This was because the Feng Shui was blocked and stagnant here; the wind brought grass seeds, and the water brought moisture, creating this scene. Wherever the vegetation was dense and the scenery pleasant, they had to take a detour. Li Xian saw several fish-like beasts in the pools, caught them and cooked them. The fish soup was fragrant, the meat tender and smooth. After eating and drinking their fill, they practiced the sword heartily twice before continuing their journey.

Wen Caixiang was as gentle as water; her temper was excellent at this time, considerate and meticulous, charming in every way. Even if Li Xian was mischievous, she indulged him. At most, she would curse him a few times, "Little rascal." But there was more affection, stronger attachment, and less complaint.

The tunnel knew no day or night, and the two were not in a hurry to travel. Following the winding path, sometimes they had to go up, sometimes down. This originally monotonous and boring road was walked with great pleasure.

[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword · Third Layer]

[Proficiency: 1235/24000 Great Accomplishment]

[Description: You found a perfect companion, experienced Yin and Yang, explored its joy, and finally achieved Great Accomplishment in the third-layer sword path. You caught a glimpse of the initial scenery of martial arts, comprehended a thread of 'Life-Saving Yin-Yang Qi', comprehended the 'Endless Joy' trait, and comprehended the 'Essence of Yin-Yang'.]

The Life-Saving Yin-Yang Qi is similar to "Life-Saving Yang Qi"; it naturally operates when necessary, capable of resisting severe and fatal injuries. 'Endless Joy' enhances the mood; when practicing the third-layer sword technique, the joy is endless, the body and soul revel in it, intoxicated by the true meaning of the sword. "Essence of Yin-Yang" is a vague and hazy knowledge; Li Xian's Five Elements Strange Escape and Feng Shui miscellaneous studies all benefited from it.

The harvest was abundant.

One day, suddenly colorful light flowed, and the sound of "ding-dong" and "ding-dong" spring water was heard. Passing through a boulder blocking the way, they arrived at a stalactite cave. Inside the cave was a blue pool and a dark underground river. Li Xian thought, "Since we've reached this point, we must be close to the surface. If my wife and I walk a little further, we can see the sun again!"

Li Xian suddenly thought, "On this tomb journey, my strength happened to surpass my wife's. Now I discover that my wife also has a side that is quite understanding and considerate. Once we get out, using the illusory influence of the bell, I can find an excuse to escape."

The stone walls were slippery, with water flowing down, forming a natural waterfall. Li Xian carried Wen Caixiang along the wall, crossed the underground river, swam through the pool, and saw the path becoming wider and wider, with the cave entrance ahead.

Sunlight shone in; it was probably noon. Outside the cave was a green forest. Although the tree crowns and the ground were covered with thick snow, it couldn't completely hide the dark green within the forest. Walking out of the cave, a slightly warm breeze blew, and the gentle sunlight hit them. Forest birds chirped softly, a scene of vitality.

Li Xian opened his arms to embrace all things, feeling infinitely joyful. He thought, "How can such a world not make one nostalgic?" He had comprehended the "Observing Heaven and Earth" trait; observing all things in heaven and earth, their colors, meanings, grandeur, and charm... were all superior to others. The beauty of all things in his eyes came one after another; the mundane world was like a scroll, instantly spreading before his eyes.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Wife, we're out!" He ran out of the cave and threw himself into the snow. Then he scooped up a handful of snow to cool his face, feeling refreshed and extremely joyful.

Suddenly, his expression changed slightly. He felt that as his heart beat, the illusory sound of the bell dissipated. His martial arts cultivation, the internal energy in his body, and the evolution of his martial path had all returned. Li Xian looked at Wen Caixiang, and his scalp went numb instantly, sensing that something was wrong. Wen Caixiang slowly walked out of the cave, the corners of her mouth raised, her eyes curved, her plan succeeding. She said, "Yes, we're all out."

Wen Caixiang beckoned with her hand and said, "Li Lang, you're being naughty again. You just came out and you've forgotten me? Come help me up?" She rested her right hand lightly, quietly observing Li Xian.

Li Xian thought, "糟糕 (Zāogāo - Oh no), my wife tricked me badly. As soon as I left the cave, the bell's influence disappeared." He walked to his wife's side, supported her hand, and said calmly with a smile, "Wife, fortunately, the bell's influence disappeared as soon as we left the cave. Otherwise, with the many soldiers in Flying Dragon City, it would have been very difficult to deal with."

Wen Caixiang smiled and said, "Oh? Is it fortunate?" Her expression suddenly turned cold, she glared at him, her fingers clamped around Li Xian's wrist, and then twisted gently.

Li Xian felt a numbness throughout his body. He immediately felt his meridians twisting, his acupoints blocked, and his internal energy in chaos. He could no longer exert his strength, yet he was completely unharmed. Wen Caixiang said indifferently, "It seems that even with innate divine strength, once outside, that's all it amounts to."

Li Xian's expression turned pale as he said, "Wife, you're joking. What do I count as innate divine strength?" Wen Caixiang said, "If you don't count, then no one does. Li Lang, you're so mighty. With one spear and one sword, you turned the Five Mountains Sword Alliance upside down." She raised her hand and gently wiped away the sweat on Li Xian's forehead.

Wen Caixiang's gentle demeanor vanished completely, her face turning cold. She said coldly, "Hmph, but how did you escape the Eight Extremes Seal? I never asked you about this. I didn't expect your abilities to be so beyond my expectations."

"If I hadn't tricked you into thinking there was also bell influence outside the cave, you would have run away by now. Hmph, don't worry. You've tricked me in every way, but I haven't used my full strength with this 'Meridian Twisting Hand'. I've just made it so you can't use your strength."

Li Xian said with a wry smile, "Wife, I did help you get out of trouble. Can't you be a bit gentler with me this time?" He was secretly lamenting: "I did suspect my wife was playing tricks, but how could I help it... How could I help it? The way out needed her guidance. This is very difficult to solve. My wife is several times more troublesome than He Wentian and the Five Mountains Sword Alliance combined."

Wen Caixiang said indifferently, "Let's deal with things one by one. What happened in the earth cave is already past. Do you think I'm so easily fooled by you repeatedly? Three strikes and you're out. Hehe, don't blame me for being unreasonable this time." She extended two fingers and poked various acupoints on Li Xian's body.

Her internal energy was powerful and refined, containing many martial arts evolutions. It attached to the acupoints, controlling the vital paths of energy circulation, and suppressing the exertion of strength. This time, she was serious and would not allow Li Xian to play tricks. In an instant, she executed more than ten moves, all aimed at locking his energy and strength.

Once Wen Caixiang's strength was restored, she couldn't help but become arrogant and difficult. Li Xian braced himself and said, "Wife, I had a sincere heart and risked danger to save you before. How can you say I was fooling you?"

Wen Caixiang glared and said, "Isn't it natural for a husband to save his wife? If you were in trouble, wouldn't I save you? Are you daring to hold your favor over my head and demand repayment?" Li Xian said, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare, it's just..."

"Just what?" Wen Caixiang said, "If not, why did you specifically bring this up?"

Seeing Wen Caixiang's fierce expression, Li Xian was about to choose his words to say some sweet words to coax her. Wen Caixiang added, "Don't say any more sweet words. I absolutely won't let you fool me this time. You've taken advantage of the situation to bully me quite a bit underground, and you've put me through all kinds of troubles." She甩开 (shuǎikāi - flung away) Li Xian's hand.

Li Xian said, "But wife, you clearly enjoyed it too. This..." Wen Caixiang frowned and said, "You still dare to talk back? Don't you understand the situation? We're not underground now."

Her jade-like face turned cold, her phoenix eyes imposing, wanting to re-establish her authority and strictly discipline her husband. She said indifferently, "Bring your head over."

Seeing that Li Xian didn't move, she said, "Your胆子 (dǎnzi - guts) has really grown. Hmph, can you beat me now?" She主动 (zhǔdòng - took the initiative) to raise her hand and grabbed Li Xian's ear, twisting it hard.

Wen Caixiang shouted, "How dare you talk back! With just this little ability, you're so wild. Hmph, first come back to the room with me, and let's see how I'll deal with you."

Wen Caixiang glared at Li Xian, her delicate nose letting out a light "humph," and said, "Follow me." She walked off, twisting his ear. Wen Caixiang was tall, but Li Xian was a head taller than her. Being twisted by the ear, he could only tilt his head slightly and bend down a little.

Li Xian felt it was undignified and thought, "This woman is just begging to be disciplined. Although I don't care much about my reputation, being twisted by the ear like this is just... just..." He tried to resist. Wen Caixiang saw it and slapped him, saying, "If you move again, I won't be so easy on you. Follow me honestly, humph."

Li Xian thought to himself, "This woman is not only fierce but also quite shrewish sometimes. This time, I should learn my lesson. Facing a character like my wife, I can't be careless for a moment. But I have the 'Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword' as my trump card, so I'm not afraid of having no chance to turn the tables."

The snow scenery along the way was beautiful, and they soon arrived at the gates of Flying Dragon City. The city gates were wide open, traffic was flowing, and the curfew had been lifted. Wen Caixiang had twisted his ear until it was red, so she let go. Li Xian quickly said, "Thank you, wife. For the rest of the journey, I'll just follow you. I'll be absolutely well-behaved."

Wen Caixiang said indifferently, "Who said I was done twisting your ear?" She rubbed her wrist and said, "This time I'll twist your right ear. Stick it over yourself." Li Xian said, "Wife, there are so many people here. I'm determined to serve you this time, so please don't make things difficult for me here."

Wen Caixiang said, "Nonsense, is it very embarrassing for me to twist your ear?" She wouldn't listen to reason, took the initiative to raise her hand, grabbed Li Xian's right ear, and walked quickly into the city.

Li Xian sighed helplessly and had to follow sideways. Along the way, he saw the strange looks from the commoners and pedestrians. Li Xian just smiled awkwardly and didn't explain. They passed a building called "Drunken Flower Tower," where a guest was caught cheating and was also being pulled home by his ear.

The two passed each other, and that guest muttered, "This brother is really not decent. His wife is as beautiful as a fairy, so why did he go picking wild flowers?" His wife heard this and twisted his ear into a pretzel, pulling him home.

The two passed through streets and alleys, attracting many gazes.

Flying Dragon City was still as prosperous as ever. The people in the streets lived and worked in peace and contentment. The flow of horses and carriages was endless. The sounds of vendors hawking, shouting, rushing, and arguing filled the ears. The atmosphere of life was thick.

Li Xian kept thinking: "Why is Flying Dragon City completely unaffected? I wonder what the situation is with the Five Mountains Sword Alliance and He Wentian. Forget it, I can't even protect myself now, so I really have no time to worry about others. My wife is so fierce this time, let's try to find some topic." He said, "Wife, what do you think is going on with the Five Mountains Sword Alliance and He Wentian?"

Wen Caixiang sneered and said, "You still have the time to worry about others?" Li Xian said, "It's not that I'm worried, but... Flying Dragon City might not be stable. It's not good for us to stay long. We should return to the manor quickly."

Wen Caixiang said, "I see right through you. If you really wanted to return to the manor, you would still be in the cocoon." Having said that, she got angry and increased the force in her hand.

Li Xian said, "I was worried about you, that's why I went to find you." Wen Caixiang said, "If you talk nonsense again, I'll twist your other ear too."

Li Xian wisely shut his mouth. Wen Caixiang shook her head gently and thought, "To have run into this little rascal, this thief of a boy, I really don't know if it's good or bad."

Returning to the Green Fragrance Pavilion, the maid Xiaotuan pushed open the side door. She saw Wen Caixiang's face showing anger, yet she was lively and graceful, and couldn't help but be curious. Then she saw that one of Li Xian's ears was red and swollen, and the other was still being twisted by Wen Caixiang. She was even more startled and jumped back a step, saying, "Ah! Weren't you in the cocoon?"

Wen Caixiang said, "He ran away long ago." Xiaotuan said in alarm, "Madam, I'm... I'm so sorry, I... I didn't know anything about it." Wen Caixiang said, "This can't be blamed on you. It's all this boy's cunning." She added a bit more force with her fingers.

Xiaotuan heaved a sigh of relief and said, "Madam, I'll go boil some water and tell the kitchen to prepare a meal. You must be tired after being away for so long, please come in and rest!"

Wen Caixiang said to Li Xian, "Look how clever Xiaotuan is, and then look at you." She wasn't referring to "boiling water" or "preparing meals," which Li Xian did better. She meant that Xiaotuan had been guarding the Green Fragrance Pavilion on her own for over ten days while Wen Caixiang was away.

Wen Caixiang swept her sleeve, and the side door closed heavily. The Green Fragrance Pavilion was as warm as spring, with occasional snowflakes falling, adding to the charm of winter and spring. The courtyard scenery was neat and exquisite, tended by Xiaotuan every day.

Passing through a flower garden, Li Xian's ear was finally released from the predicament. Both ears were scorching hot and swollen. He grabbed some snow to apply to his ears, feeling a wave of coolness that masked the pain. Wen Caixiang's simple pinch and twist had actually used the martial art "Intercepting Spring Hand." Even if Li Xian used the 'Golden Light Technique,' he couldn't escape. Even if she let go, the martial art's effect still lingered, and this injury would take a long time to heal. Wen Caixiang chose a stone pavilion to sit down. Xiaotuan brought tea, and she sipped it leisurely. After a while, she said, "Let me take a look."

Observing the injury to Li Xian's ears, she felt a slight pang of heartache. She poured two drops of "Agaricus Flower Healing Oil" into her palm and gently rubbed Li Xian's ears. She rubbed away the martial art's effect, and it soon healed completely.

Li Xian asked, "Are you not angry with me anymore?" Wen Caixiang sighed and said, "I'm just angry with you." Li Xian said, "Wife, I'll massage your legs and feet for you. You can be angry after that."

Wen Caixiang thought to herself, "This boy has got me figured out. Massaging my legs is fine, but every time you massage my feet, you're sure to secretly tickle me a few times. I'm particularly sensitive to it and can't stand it. If you're holding my feet, how can I stay angry with you? You've escaped punishment every time, but this time I won't let you play your little tricks!"

She was about to refuse when, with a "ya," Li Xian had already helped her take off her boots, removed her silk socks, and held her feet in his hands. He applied the "Cloud-Rubbing Eight Forms" massage technique to activate the acupoints on the soles of her feet.

The soles of her feet were slightly damp. They had just stepped into the "dissolving cave," where the water was rushing and the ground was wet. It was inevitable that some water had seeped into her boots. Wen Caixiang had the [Perfect Physique], which made her senses, strength, lifespan, energy, and martial arts performance... all superior to others. Her sweat had a very faint scent. But after running around in the earth cave for so long, with no time to bathe or wash clothes, her feet had a slight sourness, mixed with a faint natural fragrance.

Wen Caixiang was about to speak and scold him, but she felt Li Xian's hand strength increase, pressing and kneading the "Sole Yin Point" on the bottom of her foot. The word "you" had just left her mouth when she swallowed the rest of her words. After a while, she sensed Li Xian's intention and sternly cursed, "Little bastard..." But as soon as the word "little" came out, Li Xian, observing her expression, pressed and kneaded the "Gushing Spring Point" on the sole of her foot.

This was a major acupoint in martial arts, referring to the spring gushing from the ground. Many martial arts moves and the operation of internal energy had to pass through the Gushing Spring Point. This point was connected to the kidney meridian and could nourish the kidneys and consolidate the root, regulating the whole body.

Wen Caixiang sipped her tea, her toes curled up, her brows furrowed and then relaxed. Her anger was indeed half gone. After a while, she thought, "I always let this boy be cunning. This time, I must make him suffer a loss." She hesitated for a moment, forcibly building up her anger, and said sternly, "You..."

She felt the "Inner Court Point" on the sole of her foot being massaged and kneaded again. Her feet were already tired from walking in the earth cave for several days, on winding and rugged paths, stepping on uneven ground. She also practiced the sword with Li Xian from time to time, which was extremely exhausting. Now that they were being soothed, she naturally enjoyed it.

Wen Caixiang let out a long breath and gave Li Xian a hard look. She thought, "Forget it, forget it, let this boy be cunning for a little while longer. Once he's done massaging my feet, I'll punish him properly." She enjoyed the peace and quiet.

Her spirit was joyful, and she actually became drowsy, falling into a light sleep. Her sleep was very light; if Li Xian made any sudden move, she would surely wake up immediately. Li Xian massaged her feet and thought, "I've barely avoided one section. I've slightly grasped my wife's weakness. But next time she wants to get angry, she definitely won't let me touch her feet. This stopgap measure can't last long; I need to think of another plan."

He massaged like this for two hours. The sky gradually darkened, and twilight arrived. Seeing Li Xian serving her so earnestly, Wen Caixiang's anger was indeed mostly gone. For the time being, she couldn't muster any harsh intent. Even if she knew Li Xian was being cunning and playing tricks, she could only let him be for now. She pretended to be angry and twisted his ear, saying, "I'll let you off for today."

Li Xian said, "Wife, we've just escaped from the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Cave. I don't know the situation in the city. What are your plans for the next step?" Wen Caixiang said, "There's no point in staying here long. We just need to find a way to move the treasures in the city."

Li Xian said, "If He Wentian tries to obstruct us, how will we deal with it?"

Wen Caixiang said, "Since I dare to return to the city, I'm not afraid of him." She added, "You don't need to worry about the matters in between. I have my own plans."

Li Xian said, "By the way, wife, I have another matter." Wen Caixiang thought, "What trick is this dead boy trying to play now?" She asked indifferently, "Just say it."

Li Xian said, "The silkworm cocoon in the side pavilion is still there. Where will I sleep tonight?"

Wen Caixiang thought, "After several experiences, I shouldn't underestimate this boy. He massaged my feet today, and I knew he was being cunning on purpose, but I still fell for his trick. If I join forces with him to practice the sword again, it'll be even harder to deal with him." She smiled and said, "In that case, you can sleep next to me."

"There's a snow beast fur blanket next to my bed. You can take a quilt and sleep on the fur blanket. I've been having many nightmares lately. I think if you're by my side, I'll be able to rest a little easier."

Li Xian took a bath and changed his clothes, lying down to sleep peacefully on the snow fur blanket. This was on the third floor of the Green Fragrance Pavilion. Looking up, he could see the windowsill, and outside the window was the bright moon. The breeze was warm, mixed with a hint of winter chill. There was a stove in the room, burning fragrant charcoal. It was very warm and had a faint, pleasant aroma.

Wen Caixiang lay on her side, her long hair casually draped. She said softly, "You'd better go to sleep early. I won't be so reasonable tomorrow. You need to tell me how you escaped from the Eight Extremes Seal."

Li Xian said helplessly, "Okay... okay." Wen Caixiang said, "Hmph, tomorrow I'll see what other abilities you have hidden. You've really grown capable. The Spectral Demon Spear, Pure Yang Energy Armor, One Body Two Forms, Heavy Pupil Physique, Perfect Physique... you're truly blessed by nature."

She casually said, "Could it be that the Turbid Physique characteristic, like the One Body Two Forms, is also wearing two clothes at once?"

Li Xian wiped away his cold sweat, pretended to be fast asleep, and didn't dare to respond. Wen Caixiang stared at him for a moment, then closed her eyes and fell into a light sleep.

The next day.

Xiaotuan suddenly came to pay her respects. Li Xian helped Wen Caixiang change her clothes and comb her hair, then opened the door to see Xiaotuan. Xiaotuan said hurriedly, "Madam, it's not good, it's not good! There are many people at the door!"

Li Xian was certain it wouldn't be peaceful and said, "Who are the visitors?" Xiaotuan shook her head, her two sheep's tail braids swaying gently. "I don't know or recognize them, but I've seen some of them before. There are old, young, men, and women, quite a few of them."

Wen Caixiang said calmly, "Since they are here to visit, they are guests. Lead them in to sit and tell them I'm doing my makeup. Let them wait a moment." She tugged on Li Xian's sleeve and pointed at the several boxes of expensive cosmetics on the vanity table. She said, "Li Lang, since guests have suddenly arrived today, help me apply the cosmetics."

Li Xian helped her apply powder and makeup, adorn her jade-like face, and put on hair ornaments. Madam Wen turned gracefully before the mirror, very satisfied. Then, supported by Li Xian, she went to see the guests.
