# Chapter 328: Invincibility is Truly Lonely

The seventh opponent was a burly, bearded man wielding twin sabers. Moments ago, he had been boasting below the stage about his "Eighteen Severing the River Cuts," but now his face was pale, large beads of sweat rolling down his scars. "Xu, Xu Zhenren, please show mercy! I concede!"

Boos erupted from the crowd.

The old hands from the Seventy-Two Districts whispered amongst themselves, "How shameless. With the pressure of a perfected Bone Marrow Refining Realm cultivator and so many divine weapons, is this even a duel? It's more like a tiger wandering through a sheep pen!"

To be honest, this was pure bullying of rookies. It was like fishing in a新手村—a新手村.

"Do you wish to continue fighting?"

To advance from the preliminaries in the Seventy-Two Districts, one needed to win seven out of ten matches. Xu Yunfan had already fought seven and won all seven. He still needed three more wins.

"Continue," Xu Yunfan answered calmly.

"Next match!"

The steward's voice was already tinged with numbness.

The eighth opponent, a swordsman of considerable skill, had just leaped onto the stage when the sword at his waist suddenly let out a sharp *zheng* and unsheathed itself by half an inch. The blade trembled violently, pointing directly at the Dragon-Swallowing Cudgel.

This Green Edge Sword, which he had personally nurtured for ten years, was actually showing fear in the presence of a divine weapon's pressure!

"I..."

The swordsman's Adam's apple bobbed. He clasped his fists with a bitter expression. "I concede."

Xu Yunfan looked at the now-empty stage and suddenly understood why Lone Nine had once challenged the thirty-six sects single-handedly.

Invincibility was truly lonely.

"What is Xu Yunfan doing fighting on the stages of the Seventy-Two Districts?"

In a side hall of the Imperial Examination Academy, Luo Qingyang, a true disciple of the Xuanzhen Sect, frowned as he read the newly arrived battle report.

The other young prodigies from top sects beside him all looked peculiar upon hearing this.

"With four divine weapons on him, he's going to a place like the Seventy-Two Districts to mingle. He really can't stand in an elegant hall, coming from a servant background as he does."

A true disciple of the Nine曜 Sect sneered, snapping his folding fan shut. "Is the Dao Sect trying to humiliate the world's wandering cultivators, or does this True Disciple Xu have some special fetish?"

Although the Nine曜 Sect's mountain gate had been breached, it was still a major power. Recently, with the situation in Yanbei Dao and the Great乾 locked in a stalemate, they had invited several Ninth-Realm experts to help, and their mountain gate was on the verge of being reclaimed.

No matter how much it had declined, with seven Great Grandmasters of the Ninth-Realm Qi Refining at its helm, the Nine曜 Sect would always have a place among the six top sects of the Great Zhou.

A crisp sound of jade pendants chiming came from the corner of the hall.

The girl from the Penglai Pavilion, wearing the Starry Heart Bell, gently stroked her hairline, her eyes as clear as water. "I heard that Daoist Friend Xu, a month ago at the Long Wind Tavern, crippled the Third Elder of the Sword Pavilion in just three strikes. A person of such caliber..."

A hint of confusion crossed her face. "Why would he lower himself to deal with martial artists who haven't even reached the Bone Marrow Refining Realm?"

A monk from the Mituo Temple, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them. "The Dao Sect is using the arena to build momentum."

His rough fingers stroked the sandalwood prayer beads. "Though crude, the Seventy-Tou Districts are where the dragon and snake energies of the capital converge. With every victory Xu Yunfan achieves, his aura grows stronger. After all, among those in the Bone Marrow Refining Realm, he is outstanding..."

At this point, the monk couldn't help but reveal a faint smile. "He intends to cultivate an aura of invincibility to suppress us."

The expressions of everyone present changed upon hearing this.

Luo Qingyang shot to his feet. If that were true, by the time Xu Yunfan fought his way to the Imperial Examination Academy, he would have used the defeats of the martial artists as fuel, cultivating his aura to a terrifying level.

The Penglai Pavilion girl laughed lightly, seemingly unconcerned. "Building momentum off the weak is something only the weak would do."

***

In Jiannan Dao, Yuhuan Prefecture, atop the Qingwei Mountain of the Dao Sect.

Eighteen gilded bronze pillars rose from the ground, each wrapped in complex Daoist talismans that shimmered with a dark golden luster in the midday sun. Arranged according to the positions of the celestial constellations, the Spirit-Attracting Pearls atop the pillars were the hidden foundation of the Dao Sect. At this very moment, they were inhaling and exhaling the spiritual energy converging from the eighteen subterranean veins of Yuhuan Prefecture.

At the center of the ritual platform, a nine-tiered Black Jade Terrace was stacked like a mountain, each step carved with the sect's secret talismans. On the Taiji Yin-Yang fish pattern at the very top sat three bronze tripods. The smoke from the Dragon's Balm incense burning within rose straight up for a hundred yards without dispersing.

"Sect Master, the ritual platform is complete," said Purple Mirror Daoist, the peak master of Liuyun Peak, as he walked up the steps, the hem of his Daoist robe billowing without wind.

Behind him, twelve steward disciples were adjusting the platform's arrangements, not daring to be the slightest bit negligent. The opening of a Daoist ritual platform was a matter concerning the Grand Rite of Heaven and could not be taken lightly.

Bi Yuan stood with his hands behind his back at the edge of the Black Jade Terrace, his hand stroking the old, worn-out scroll of the *Heavenly Treasure Catalog* that Cui Yu had sent him.

"Has Yunfan started fighting on the stages?" Bi Yuan asked without turning his head, his gaze still fixed on the churning sea of clouds before him.

Purple Mirror Daoist nodded. "The falcon returned with news that he has already fought and won seven matches half an hour ago."

As he said this, the usually stern peak master's mouth twitched slightly.

The stages of the Seventy-Two Districts were for wandering martial artists to struggle and climb. Any inner disciple from the Dao Sect could sweep through them, let alone Xu Yunfan, who could go toe-to-toe with a Great Grandmaster of the Organ Refining Realm.

Bi Yuan suddenly let out a light laugh. He looked up at the sky, which was beginning to turn purple.

"It is good that he has won."

He paused, then said solemnly, "There is no time to lose. Open the platform, summon the stars, and stir the veins!"

As soon as Bi Yuan's words fell, the summit of Qingwei Mountain was suddenly swept by wind and clouds.

Three Supreme Elders, clad in black Daoist robes embroidered with star patterns, strode out from the sea of clouds. As their sleeves fluttered, the Gang Qi around them condensed into the phantom of a Daoist cloud pattern, vaguely forming the shape of a lotus. This was the unique secret martial art of the Great Grandmasters of the Ninth-Realm Qi Refining in the Dao Sect—Walking on Air, with Each Step a Lotus.

At the mountain's peak, the howling winds made the snow-white hair and eyebrows of the long-browed elder flutter fiercely. His profound, abyss-like gaze swept over Bi Yuan, and a meaningful snort escaped his nostrils. The fingers of his emaciated hand, hidden in his sleeve, curled slightly. The eighteen gilded bronze pillars trembled in response, the talismans on their bodies flickering as the surrounding spiritual energy rapidly converged within them, clearly revealing the elder's inner displeasure.

Bi Yuan gave a bitter smile and bowed deeply. "I have troubled you, Elders."

"To take advantage of the revival of the world's spiritual energy to forcefully open the Grand Rite of Heaven and drain the Great Zhou's dragon vein... Do you know how many years of merit this will cost the Dao Sect?" the elder's voice rang out like the clashing of metal, each word making the Black Jade Terrace hum.

Bi Yuan bowed even deeper. "This disciple is ashamed."

He then straightened up, a glint of crimson-gold light flashing in his eyes, his expression resolute. "But the Heavenly Devils are about to descend. This is an extraordinary time... Xu Yunfan bears a great fortune and should have a sliver of hope."

The long-browed elder said indifferently, "The Sect Master has three decrees. You have already used two, with one left. After you use it, I'm afraid you will have to step down."

"I will naturally step down from the position of Sect Master," Bi Yuan replied without hesitation, his voice as steady as the ancient, unmelting snow on the mountaintop.

The three Supreme Elders were all taken aback.

The white-haired old woman beside them raised her staff slightly and said nonchalantly, "Alright, enough with the chiding. If it weren't for little Yuan, how could we have lived so long? Let's just see if they can forge a path..."

The long-browed elder gave Bi Yuan a deep look, then suddenly pointed two fingers like a sword towards the east.

"Open the platform!"

This command no longer held any trace of displeasure but was filled with a sense of resolution.
