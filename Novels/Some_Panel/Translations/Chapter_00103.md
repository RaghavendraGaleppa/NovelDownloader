# Chapter 102: The Second Assessment

Time flowed, several autumns passed, and in a blink, a few more years had gone by. It had now been a full decade since he completed his last assessment mission. Ten years had passed in the blink of an eye, and suddenly, Yang Ji's Dao Sect talisman vibrated. Clearly, the second assessment mission had arrived. Success would grant him another century of cultivation within the Dao Sect, enjoying an endless supply of elixirs. Failure, however, would mean separation from the Dao Sect, the removal of his purple robes, becoming an nameless disciple, and his immortal path severed, making future progress extremely difficult. Thus, this second mission was equally crucial, and even Yang Ji dared not be careless in the slightest.

The Dao Sect was still humane; the assessment missions they assigned were linked to one's strength and cultivation realm. If one couldn't even pass this, then they had no fate to remain in the Dao Sect. Yang Ji flipped his hand and took out the talisman. A string of small characters appeared on it: [Northern Abyss Sea, Cloud Bloom Sea Region. The Flirtatious Young Master has wreaked havoc in the region, defiling countless female cultivators, and later secretly refined them into evil Human-Demon Pills to boost his cultivation. His crimes are monstrous, and he must be executed.]

[Note: The Flirtatious Young Master is engrossed in pleasure and has neglected his cultivation. Although he is at the Nascent Soul realm, he has a Void Refinement realm father. Disciples undertaking this mission are advised to be extremely cautious.]

"A Void Refinement realm father?" Yang Ji frowned slightly, then relaxed, muttering, "Since the sect assigned such a mission, there's clearly room for maneuver here. It shouldn't be a dead end."

At this moment, his attention was more focused on the "Human-Demon Pill." According to records, this type of pill was a common method used by Outer-Realm Sky Demons to devour human cultivators. They often refined human cultivators alive into pills, ensuring their souls remained intact and their pure magical power within their bodies. Pills refined in this manner could not only nourish the soul but also enhance cultivation. However, human cultivators subjected to this process would endure dual torment of both body and soul, wishing they were dead, an extremely cruel fate.

Some human rogue cultivators, who revered Sky Demons, also learned such evil methods, frequently committing atrocities and harming other cultivators. The demonic path, as commonly referred to, derived its cultivation techniques from these Outer-Realm Sky Demons. However, the demonic path, ultimately, still contained the character "Dao" (Path). It adopted the marvels of the Sky Demon's cultivation methods but did not lose its inherent nature, nor did it become a puppet of the Sky Demons. Ultimately, it was humans cultivating demonic arts. Although the cultivation methods came from an alien race, their actions and conduct still retained humanity. Therefore, the Ten Great Dao Sects of the Grand Beginning World largely turned a blind eye to the Ten Great Demonic Sects. As long as their actions weren't too outrageous, there would be no issue. For instance, Di Xuan Sha, revered as a Demonic Sect Dao Child, cultivated the *Heavenly Demon's Alien Heart Grand Art*, using cultivators' flesh and blood to nourish sacred medicines and boost his cultivation. He only dared to do so covertly, not daring to be too ostentatious.

Once exposed, he would be obliterated by the Dao Sect. This was the hidden struggle between the righteous and demonic paths. This Flirtatious Young Master, lacking both the background and strength of a Demonic Sect Dao Child, yet daring to be so arrogant—who gave him such courage? He was simply courting death. Adhering to the principle of "exposure means death," the Dao Sect had listed him as a kill-on-sight target. So he had to die. Even if Yang Ji couldn't kill him, his death warrant had already been sealed.

Dao Sect missions generally had no time limit; one only needed to slay the target within the cultivation realm specified by the mission, whether it took a year or ten. However, during this period, one would not enjoy the Dao Sect's cultivation resources. Time was equivalent to lifespan, so generally, no one would waste so much time unless the circumstances were exceptional. After Yang Ji confirmed acceptance of the mission, he put away his Dao Sect talisman.

Soon, the Myriad Treasure Mirror flashed, revealing a message from Yan Zhan.

[Yang Ji, I heard about the Hell Forging Ground. I never expected you could command humanoid weapons. It seems you were the one who took the inheritance early. Tell me, were you secretly watching us make fools of ourselves back then?]

Yang Ji smiled slightly and replied, [You found out? I should have pretended to go down with you back then; then perhaps you wouldn't have discovered me.]

[Hmph! Right, what's your second assessment mission?] Yan Zhan sent another message.

[Go to the Northern Abyss Sea and slay a rogue cultivator. What about you?]

[Hunt a demon lord in the Sky Demon Forging Ground.]

[I haven't killed Sky Demons before, nor do I know their true power. You must be extra careful.]

[Mm, I hope we both pass this assessment.] Yan Zhan said.

[We will.] Yang Ji replied.

Seeing that Yan Zhan no longer sent messages, he put away his Myriad Treasure Mirror and walked out of the great hall. Outside, Chong Yuan and the others were softly conversing, smiles on their faces.

"You all seem so happy, did you get assigned good missions?" Yang Ji asked with a smile.

"Revered Master, several of us received the same mission again. The sect discovered an unexplored secret realm within a spatial rift, and our mission this time is to enter and explore it with the sect's higher-ups, and survive," Chong Yuan chuckled.

"Exploring a secret realm?" Yang Ji mused. "This mission looks easy, but it's filled with many unknown dangers. You must be careful."

"We will be careful, please rest assured, Revered Master," Chong Yuan and the others nodded.

The next day, everyone departed, commencing their second assessment. Yang Ji also took the Buddha Child and Shen Yin to the Northern Abyss Sea. After eight days of teleportation, they finally arrived at the Northern Abyss Sea, in the Cloud Bloom Sea Region.

The purple robes of the Wuji Dao Sect were too conspicuous, so Yang Ji changed into a set of white robes. After some inquiries, he learned that the Flirtatious Young Master's real name was Liu Yuan, and he resided on Willow Emperor Island. Willow Emperor was precisely his father, a hegemon of the Cloud Bloom Sea Region and the only Void Refinement cultivator there.

At this moment, under the blazing sun, Yang Ji hid within a white cloud, gazing from afar at Willow Emperor Fort on Willow Emperor Island. Some information, like game prompts, appeared: [Fortress, constructed from White Shimmering Stone, inscribed with a Four Palace Defensive Array. If activated, it is impregnable even to Void Refinement cultivators.]

[One early-stage Void Refinement cultivator, currently in shallow cultivation, can awaken at any time.]

[Three early-stage Soul Transformation cultivators, currently enjoying themselves leisurely within the fortress.]

[Eight Nascent Soul cultivators, currently enjoying themselves leisurely within the fortress.]

And then there was information about a host of guards. With a single glance, Yang Ji obtained the current activities and basic information of the fortress and its inhabitants. It went without saying that the Void Refinement realm cultivator must be the Willow Emperor Fort Lord, and the three Soul Transformation cultivators were likely Willow Emperor's subordinates, the Three Malignant Gods. As for the eight Nascent Soul realm cultivators enjoying themselves, the Flirtatious Young Master was probably one of them.

"One Void Refinement, three Soul Transformation cultivators, this won't be easy." Yang Ji furrowed his brow slightly, then suddenly grinned cunningly, "Buddha Child, you've transformed into a holy medicine, priceless beyond measure. How about you go lure away the Willow Emperor Fort Lord and those three Soul Transformation realm cultivators? I'll count it as a great merit for you."

"Revered Master, just kill me directly," the Buddha Child rolled its eyes, then lay flat, sprawling limply within Yang Ji's sleeve, looking utterly resigned to its fate.

"You little brat, you have no spirit of fearless sacrifice at all," Yang Ji said with a laugh, gently scolding it. He wasn't actually sending the Buddha Child to its death, but he couldn't think of a good plan at the moment and was merely teasing it.

"Revered Master, when you were asking around earlier, didn't that person gnash their teeth and say that this guy frequently comes out to seek pleasures and harm girls? We can seize that opportunity to butcher him," the Buddha Child suddenly chuckled mischievously.

"This guy usually brings a Soul Transformation realm guard when he comes out... a Soul Transformation cultivator!" Yang Ji mused, recalling his battle with Grand Exalt Whitebrow, weighing the difference in their strengths.

"How powerful can a Soul Transformation cultivator born in such a small place be? They probably don't even have a complete Great Divine Ability technique. If I, the Buddha Child, reach the Nascent Soul realm and cultivate the Buddha-Demon Form, I could definitely single-handedly fight all three Soul Transformation cultivators. I'll use my Devouring Demonic Art, crunching them one by one, and they'll surely know my power, *gaga gaga*," the Buddha Child cackled strangely. "Revered Master, a genius like you, capable of slaying a Dao Child's avatar, can definitely fight two moves against such third-rate Soul Transformation cultivators across a major realm. Even if you can't defeat them, you can activate your Sword Wings and leave safely."

Yang Ji mused, "Nascent Soul cultivates the Pure Yang Primordial Spirit, while Soul Transformation cultivates the Great Dao physical body, beginning to birth the proto-world within. They can mobilize world power to bind others, so one must not be careless."

"However, what you said isn't without reason. These three are only at the early stage of Soul Transformation, so their strength difference won't be too vast, and their speed won't be much faster than Nascent Soul cultivators."

"If I use my treasured Sword Wings, I can achieve divine speed and completely break through their restraints."

"At that time, as long as I find an opportunity to instantly kill the Flirtatious Young Master, I can simply walk away."

Yang Ji recalled his battle with Grand Exalt Whitebrow, having a reliable comparison of strengths in his mind, and instantly formed a plan.

"Revered Master, we'll just stake him out here. That kid is dead meat," the Buddha Child chuckled.

Yang Ji nodded, then concealed himself within the cloud mass, cultivating while closely monitoring the situation at Willow Emperor Fort.

But...

A month passed, and although people came and went from Willow Emperor Fort, the Flirtatious Young Master showed no signs of coming out.

"Isn't this kid known as the Flirtatious Young Master? How can he resist not coming out to find girls? This isn't right," the Buddha Child frowned, then suddenly chuckled strangely, "Could it be that this kid is weak? Is he recuperating? What an inconvenient time to be impotent."

"He was supposed to be on his way to death, but he managed to cling to life for two more days. I must say, this guy truly has good luck."

"Keep waiting, he'll eventually come out," Yang Ji said calmly, his eyes opening and closing, showing extreme patience.

"Big Brother, I'm hungry." Suddenly, Shen Yin's voice entered Yang Ji's ears from within the Mountain-Sea Pearl. He sent in his divine sense and saw that all the wood-attribute spiritual items he had given Shen Yin last time had been consumed by her again.

Yang Ji looked at Willow Emperor Fort, pondered for a moment, and then transmitted a message to her, "Let's go, I'll take you to eat mountains first." This sea region had numerous islands, with lush forests. Selectively eating some would allow them to recover in a couple of years. Out of caution, Yang Ji secretly instructed Shen Yin to only absorb one-tenth of the essence from each tree. This way, even after an entire mountain was absorbed, it would still appear largely green, preventing detection.

Just like that, Yang Ji took Shen Yin and rapidly flew out hundreds of miles, beginning to search for islands to "eat." Because the time was already at the transition between spring and summer, plants were flourishing, and the humid, tropical maritime climate was even more conducive to vegetation growth. Some uninhabited islands were lush and verdant year-round, with inconceivably dense plant spiritual energy, and even rare, precious trees growing upon them.
