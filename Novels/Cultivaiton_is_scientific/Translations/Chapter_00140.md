# Chapter 140: A Turn of Events

Peak Master Zhao's emotions were complex. He had always believed he wasn't wrong—protecting the cultivators of his peak was his duty as a peak master.  

But when he heard Elder Baili refer to Elder Yin as "father-in-law" and saw Yin Shilan's shy reaction, realization dawned on him.  

He turned to look at Sect Leader Yu. From that square-jawed face, he detected a trace of cunning and malice.  

This sect leader clearly knew about the relationship between Li Shiming and Yin Shilan but hadn't informed him, waiting instead for him to dig his own grave.  

"Xiao Zhao, I'm very disappointed in you. You will handle this matter again. If even treason can be forgiven, what does that make Tianhai Sect?" Elder Yin now turned his gaze to Peak Master Zhao, issuing a calm command.  

"Yes, I was mistaken in this matter and will correct it immediately!" Without any defense, Peak Master Zhao hurriedly assured him.  

"Everyone may leave now. Junior Brother Quan, Junior Sister Sheng, let's catch up properly tomorrow!" Elder Yin said nothing more, dismissing them.  

The two Golden Core elders and the gathered Foundation Establishment seniors understood that Elder Yin wanted to speak privately with his daughter. They left with smiles.  

Only Elder Yin and Yin Shilan remained outside the cave abode. Yin Shilan wanted to leave too, but under her father's gaze, she knew there was no escape today.  

"Lan'er, was that old rogue Baili telling the truth? You're not young anymore—it's natural to have someone you like. I just want to see what kind of person this boy is and whether he's worthy of my precious daughter," Elder Yin said gently.  

Yin Shilan sensed something amiss. Though the words differed, the tone was identical to when her mother had tricked her into revealing details about Li Shiming.  

"There's nothing like that. We're just friends," she replied softly.  

To Elder Yin's ears, this was tantamount to saying, "Yes, we're deeply in love."  

Though he had just emerged from seclusion, he knew his daughter well.  

Born into Tianhai Sect while he was already a Golden Core elder, Yin Shilan had grown up with no peers aside from her younger sister, surrounded only by cultivators old enough to be her grandfather in the mortal world.  

Exceptionally intelligent, she had been identified as a Heavenly Spiritual Root at age twelve. This brilliance, combined with her talent for formations, left her without peers her age.  

Other Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivators in the sect lacked her formation talent, leaving no common ground for conversation.  

Shy by nature, Yin Shilan would withdraw if topics ran dry.  

"In a couple of days, I'll visit Fei'er with you," Elder Yin changed the subject.  

---  

Yin Shilan exhaled in relief when her father didn't press further and nodded in agreement.  

Upon returning to Gen Peak, Peak Master Zhao's first act was to detain all key members of the Yun Trading Company and summon another Yun family Foundation Establishment cultivator—Yun Song.  

"Greetings, Peak Master!" Yun Song had already learned of the renewed investigation into the Yun family upon being summoned. Without question, he immediately reported to the peak master.  

Yun Song had never involved himself in the trading company's affairs, his obsession with cultivation surpassing all else.  

Beyond receiving the Yun family's support, he had little connection to them.  

"Yun Song, you will represent Gen Peak in approaching Li Shiming. All of the Yun Trading Company's assets have been seized—use them as you see fit. My only requirement is that you secure Li Shiming's forgiveness by any means necessary. Additionally, Yun Gang will remain stationed at Tianhai's coastal defenses indefinitely, and all mid-level and above personnel of the trading company will be charged with treason," Peak Master Zhao declared solemnly.  

The flood of information left Yun Song momentarily dazed. After a pause, he grasped the situation.  

First, the Yun family was finished. The previous incident had been suppressed by Peak Master Zhao, limiting the fallout.  

But now, all the family's elites would bear the weight of treason—a grave charge likely to result at minimum in the destruction of their cultivation.  

Second, Peak Master Zhao was afraid. Li Shiming's background exceeded expectations, forcing the peak master to retreat.  

Considering today's major event—Elder Yin's emergence from seclusion—Yun Song connected the dots: Li Shiming had ties to Elder Yin.  

"I will follow the peak master's orders and handle this immediately," Yun Song bowed and turned to leave.  

"Wait. You likely won't be able to meet Li Shiming like this. Seek out the sect leader and have him arrange an introduction," Peak Master Zhao added as an afterthought.

On Eagle Beak Island, Li Shiming remained unaware of the major developments in the sect.  

Most of his days were spent importing formation knowledge into the IBMz15. As an intermediate formation master, he could freely access knowledge up to the intermediate level.  

This constituted an immense system of knowledge. Normally, a formation master would specialize in one area while dabbling in others.  

But Li Shiming was different—he fed all the knowledge into the IBMz15.  

Once analyzed by the supercomputer, the results were shared with him.  

He bypassed the most time-consuming part. What took other formation masters a decade to learn, he absorbed in mere minutes.  

Though his sense of belonging to the sect had waned—he hadn't even claimed his allotted 2,000 spirit stones and formation resources—he wouldn't pass up the formation knowledge.  

Not claiming the resources was his way of signaling his stance to the sect.  

If an assassination attempt against him was met with unfair handling by the sect, showing no reaction would seem disingenuous.  

This incident allowed him to reduce his sect activities and focus on cultivation and study.  

He deeply understood that strength was everything. Whether as a Foundation Establishment cultivator or a high-level formation master, he would no longer face injustice.  

"This is interesting," he murmured while importing formation knowledge, pausing at a particular passage.  

Formations and celestial bodies shared many connections, with numerous formations modeled after star patterns.  

This passage described the Thirty-Three Heavens.  

The first heaven began at 3,000 zhang (approx. 9,000 meters), with each subsequent heaven separated by tempest winds.  

These winds harmed cultivators' bodies and scattered spiritual energy.  

The description was brief, merely introducing the concept of the Thirty-Three Heavens and the tempest winds.  

This contradicted Li Shiming's previous life's understanding of the sky and impacted one of his major plans.  

"Looks like I need to research the Thirty-Three Heavens," he muttered, shaking his head.  

He disliked asking for help, but this information was crucial. He'd have to consult Uncle Zhuge.  

An alert from the IBMz15 drew his attention to the monitoring system, showing two cultivators outside Eagle Beak Island—one was Law Enforcement Hall's Deacon Xu, the other a stranger.  

As Li Shiming puzzled over their presence, Deacon Xu sent a beam of light into the formation.  

Returning to his cave abode, Li Shiming caught the visiting card Deacon Xu had sent—a formal request for entry.  

He opened the minor mountain-protecting formation, allowing the two onto the island, and greeted them outside his abode.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, I've come under the sect leader's orders to bring Yun Song to see you," De
