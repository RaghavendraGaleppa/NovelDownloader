# Chapter 50: The Third Rebirth

It was a shallow night. Although the sky was dim, the surroundings were clearly visible.

Inside the room, Qin Ming took a deep breath, exhaled the stale air, cleared his mind of stray thoughts, and brushed away the restless dust in his heart. The sunstone in the copper basin had just been retrieved and was at its brightest, casting a brilliant light over Qin Ming’s hair tips and facial contours.

The fiery glow illuminated the room, even the windows and walls seemed gilded. Qin Ming sat still, much like a scene from old-world records, with a setting sun casting its afterglow on a temple whose tiled roof shimmered with a faint golden luster. Inside, a divine statue bathed in the twilight, serene and peaceful.

Soon after, he poured some of the pale golden liquid from the porcelain jar into a white bowl. It was richly fragrant, having been extracted from mead. Even before drinking, it made one feel slightly tipsy. A traveling merchant, having journeyed far and wide, once said that not even a single "day-gold" coin could buy a single drop of this essence from an ant nest.

In the white bowl, the pale golden spiritual substance seemed to condense the sunlight of the old world, shimmering brilliantly, as wisps of mist curled up, interwoven with gold. Qin Ming covered the porcelain jar and drank half a bowl of the spiritual substance in one gulp.

His mouth was filled with a sweet aroma, mingled with a faint scent of wine, leaving an endless aftertaste. This was a thousand times better than the bitter taste of a blood snake's gallbladder, making him long for another bowl.

In an instant, Qin Ming experienced its marvel. His body rapidly heated up, the effect immediate. He felt like he had transformed into a furnace. He went out into the yard, where the cold wind blew, yet it brought a surprising warmth. Snowflakes fell, like a spring rain, making him feel as though he had stepped into early spring.

Qin Ming glowed all over. His flesh and blood vitality continuously surged, repelling the severe cold of winter and steaming up copious amounts of white mist. He was drenched in sweat, his entire body wet, as a layer of silver light appeared on his skin, then seemingly turned into silver mud. Following this, "golden needles" emerged from within him.

Then, the golden needles threaded their way through the silver mud, forming a "golden-thread jade suit" even while he was awake, before he had fallen asleep. This was different from before. Qin Ming carefully sensed the strange phenomenon that had first appeared during his initial rebirth, now undergoing a qualitative change. Qin Ming confirmed that this was transforming into heavenly light.

He began to move in the yard, demonstrating the rebirth method recorded on the silk scroll. His body movements, breathing coordination, and mental tempering were all included. Qin Ming was tireless, continuously practicing the method, feeling no fatigue. A fresh aura surged through him, and rich vitality spread and expanded through his flesh and blood, even making the corners of his eyes and brows glow.

He knew that the third rebirth had officially begun. Heavenly light was being born within him, undergoing miraculous changes. "It truly makes sense that the predecessors called this realm 'Rebirth.' Every significant improvement in physical quality is like undergoing a post-natal transformation from a mother's womb."

The birth of Heavenly Light in the human body was by no means due to the shattered golden ripples on the body's surface. Its root lay deep within the body; the external manifestation was merely a superficial phenomenon. At this moment, it was as if thunder rumbled in Qin Ming's heart. With a loud boom, a blinding Heavenly Light shone from his sea of consciousness, directly descending into his flesh and blood.

Following this, his five internal organs and six viscera also revived. Some parts appeared like the glow of morning clouds, brilliant golden and imbued with a vigorous primal aura, while other areas were like a celestial river entering a dream, breaking through mist, with stars shining brightly… Qin Ming glowed from head to toe, even his black hair seemed to burn, with flames flickering. A powerful, rich rebirth energy covered his entire body.

At this time, even his eyes emitted a mysterious Heavenly Light. This was the third rebirth. If sufficiently complete, it would be like this from head to toe; Heavenly Light would be born everywhere and be omnipresent. As the Heavenly Light gradually became contained, Qin Ming grew increasingly peaceful, merging with his surroundings. Every gesture was effortless and natural, without the slightest artifice.

The silk scroll did not contain many specific descriptions of Heavenly Light, striving instead to use concise brushstrokes to explain the elevation of life's essence. "I guessed right. As long as one adheres to the practices recorded in the silk scroll, Heavenly Light will naturally emerge, strengthening one's essence, qi, and spirit." Qin Ming gained new insights. Although the silk scroll did not elaborate on Heavenly Light, it was destined to appear and be cultivated.

But what about Heavenly Light Strength? He frowned. This strength needed to be cultivated, requiring specific methods. He could only hope that after falling asleep tonight, his childhood memories would resurface, allowing him to open the third page of the silk scroll to find answers and resolve his confusion.

Subsequently, Qin Ming began practicing combat forms. After a moment's thought, he discarded the long-handled dark gold hammer and picked up the woodcutting knife. Instantly, cold light glinted. Qin Ming felt as if light was about to burst forth from between his flesh and blood. "Hmm, could it be that Heavenly Light Strength is about to be born?"

He focused on feeling it, not only practicing with the knife but also executing various highly efficient killing techniques with his fists and feet, some directly derived from the knife methods, stirring up sounds of wind and thunder in the yard. He didn't know how much time had passed, but as the shallow night was nearing its end, Qin Ming finally felt a slight fatigue and stopped.

After dinner, Old Man Liu knocked on the courtyard gate. Although Qin Ming's body no longer glowed like a furnace, a vibrant life force still flowed within him, and a fresh aura was like the first blossoming of all things. Old Man Liu felt a trance, merely looking at him gave him the illusion of witnessing ice and snow melt, and grass and trees sprouting new buds, a scene of thriving prosperity.

"You just went straight into your third rebirth without any preparations?" he asked in a low voice.

Qin Ming nodded. After their journey to the mountains, he and Old Man Liu knew each other's depths and had no need to hide anything. Old Man Liu was full of envy.

"You have spiritual substance in hand, Old Man. Why aren't you focusing your mind, adjusting your state? When are you going to wait until?" Qin Ming asked.

"Do you think everyone can be like you, just rush forward and achieve rebirth?" Old Man Liu retorted. He truly felt uncertain now. Even with the essence from the ant nest in hand, he couldn't guarantee that he would definitely achieve the third rebirth. Because, how far each person could go was truly hard to say. At the very least, the threshold of the first rebirth blocked ninety percent of people.

Former sages estimated that even with spiritual substance, sixty to seventy percent of people would be blocked at the door, unable to even achieve one rebirth. Without a doubt, achieving the first rebirth did not mean stepping onto a wide road. Even with spiritual substance in hand, sixty to seventy percent of people would be blocked during the second rebirth. The same applied to the third rebirth. Old Man Liu was already so old; how could he have confidence?

Qin Ming offered comfort and boosted his confidence, saying, "You must have faith, believing that you can penetrate the entire realm of rebirth."

Old Man Liu sighed, saying that his entire life he always faltered at crucial moments. Back then, he could have achieved rebirth during his golden age, but he was injured in the mountains and fell gravely ill, delaying him for half a year. As a youth, he went to Scarlet Cloud City, almost about to apprentice under a famous master, but that elder temporarily left on business and died tragically at the edge of the absolute dark wilderness.

After Old Man Liu returned, he became very close with a group of old-timers from the Mountain Patrol Team. Once, they wanted to collaborate on obtaining a mysterious substance. However, as soon as they entered the mountains, they encountered a famous beast gone mad. That monstrous creature merely passed by, not deliberately targeting them, yet it nearly annihilated them. He was severely weakened, and surviving was a miracle.

As Qin Ming listened to Old Man Liu's rambling, he couldn't help but feel that the old man genuinely seemed unlucky. "The only smooth thing was this trip to the mountains with you. Other matters are truly hard to describe, always full of twists and turns," Old Man Liu sighed.

"You call that smooth? It took four days to clear one ant nest, and even never-before-seen flying ants evolved!" Qin Ming looked at him with an odd expression. "How are the people around you? They haven't been affected, have they?" Qin Ming was naturally not superstitious and didn't believe in such things, merely asking casually.

"It's been alright," Old Man Liu said hesitantly.

"What do you mean, 'it's been alright'?" Qin Ming was suspicious.

"Like you, I wasn't originally from this village. I was picked up by my grandfather here when I was six. Maybe I was too young, but I have no memory of my biological parents. I guess they weren't doing so well back then, or perhaps they died long ago, otherwise I wouldn't have been left adrift in the ice and snow. It's strange to say, but my severe frostbite eventually healed, and I survived."

Qin Ming didn't know how to comfort him. He said, "Don't think so much about it. I think you should go back and calm your mind, immediately drink the spiritual substance, without any hesitation. Go all out and achieve your third rebirth directly!"

"That's what I thought too! I should be decisive!" Old Man Liu said. He took out a porcelain jar from his怀 (bosom/pocket), twisted it open, and gulped it down.

Qin Ming was stunned. "You came here to drink it directly? Why didn't you go home and calm yourself first?"

Old Man Liu said, "I feel like things have been very smooth lately when I'm with you. I came here to bask in your luck." Then he became excited. He already felt it; his body was scalding hot, as if burning, and light mist gradually began to steam up from within him.

"This is... I, this old man, actually succeeded!" He wanted to burst out laughing but had to keep his voice down.

Qin Ming said, "Don't be so superstitious. You inherently had this potential. You just set up mental barriers for yourself, so sometimes you weren't decisive enough to take that step forward."

"You can't say that. There are some things you just have to believe. I feel that all these misfortunes are related to the blood-stained kite I saw when I was a foolish youth," Old Man Liu said, pointing at the night sky.

Qin Ming immediately grew serious and asked, "Specifically, where was it?"

"Back then, I was standing by the fire spring at the village entrance. The kite must have drifted right above the center of Twin Tree Village..." Old Man Liu, before Heavenly Light could manifest, wrapped himself tightly in his beast hide coat and scurried back to his own home.

Deep into the night, a "golden-thread jade suit" seemed to truly manifest on Qin Ming's body. He harbored some suspicion: did ancient emperors, when buried in their "pearl gowns and jade caskets" joined with gold threads, in their pursuit of immortality, perhaps know something about this?

Qin Ming fell into a deep sleep. Later in the night, he experienced that state again, half-dreaming and half-awake, seeing his younger self. He was still wearing ragged small clothes, and when he looked down, two of his toes were peeking out from the broken parts of his tiny shoes.

This time, he finally saw the appearance of the speaking man, though it was only a fleeting glimpse when he leaned close while flipping through the silk scroll. Qin Ming realized that this must be a relative of his; he bore some resemblance to him. The man was in his early fifties, with graying temples, calloused hands, and old, patched clothes.

"Is that my grandfather?" Qin Ming wondered.

To his anticipation, the silk scroll opened to the third page, revealing densely packed small characters and human figures. There was indeed no mention of Heavenly Light Strength! It continued the rebirth method from the second page, soon mentioning the five senses, instinctive intuition, and so on. He guessed that the fourth rebirth might be related to perception.

"But where is the Heavenly Light Strength?!" Qin Ming was so anxious that he nearly exited the state, almost waking up from his dream. Fortunately, he steadied himself and continued to look down, inscribing the third page of the silk scroll in his mind – perhaps not literally memorizing, but reliving a childhood experience, which, with the third rebirth, he now remembered.

Then, he made a new discovery: in the bottom corner of the page, there was a line of annotation that mentioned Heavenly Light Strength! Qin Ming read it with a blank face. Why did it feel like it was scolding him? The first half of the annotation roughly meant: "Heavenly Light has already been born, and you still can't cultivate your own Heavenly Light Strength?" It then mentioned what to do next with just one word: Fuse! The second half of the annotation was mocking, saying that cultivating the method on the silk scroll required a master's guidance, and if one was still so dull after being taught hand-in-hand, they might as well give up on the silk scroll.

"Scold me all you want. I cultivated it myself; no one guided me into it," Qin Ming thought as he awoke.

The heavy night had receded, and a new day had dawned. After breakfast, he immediately went to the courtyard to practice the rebirth method from the silk scroll. "Seek within oneself!" This was a key phrase he had seen on the third page of the silk scroll.

As he demonstrated the rebirth method from the silk scroll, the Heavenly Light within him stirred again, just like yesterday. In the end, it seemed restless unless it erupted. Finally, a mysterious ripple appeared on his fingertips, on his skin, and then it vibrated forth, manifesting Heavenly Light Strength!

With a whoosh, as his fingertips touched the knife handle, the woodcutting knife seemed to stick to his hand. Then, he tried it slightly, exerting a little force with his finger, and Heavenly Light Strength burst forth, causing a large chip to appear in the woodcutting knife.

"It's not simple. I finally cultivated my own Heavenly Light Strength." He focused on experiencing it, constantly testing it. Then he naturally thought of that blade manual, which also recorded Heavenly Light Strength. During the third rebirth, many people struggled to cultivate even one type of Heavenly Light Strength. Qin Ming felt that his limit should not be confined to just one, especially since he also possessed the Three-Color Flower. Moreover, the annotation on the silk scroll mentioned the word "Fuse," clearly reminding future cultivators to cultivate multiple Heavenly Light Strengths.

Qin Ming heard movement from the village entrance. People from Golden Rooster Ridge had indeed arrived, intending to recruit new rebirth cultivators to join them.

"Everything is ready, I just need a good knife!" Qin Ming took out the piece of mutton-fat jade iron. This mysterious material did not require extensive forging; it only needed to be melted into a weapon, which made it much simpler and could be completed quickly.
