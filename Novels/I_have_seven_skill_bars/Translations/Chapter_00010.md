# Chapter 10: The Female Cultivator Li Yizhen

Ever since the news spread that Ding Rui could indeed kill the giant aphids, Spirit Field 377 immediately became bustling with activity. Liu Yun alone had already made Spirit Field 377 very popular among the sect's spirit field cultivators. Now with Ding Rui added, the threshold was practically being worn down. If Ding Rui didn't still have work to do at Spirit Field 377, he would probably be out and about all day, every day. One must know that the total number of spirit fields in the entire Xuanfu Sect had now reached 503, yet Ding Rui was the only Qi Condensation realm cultivator capable of killing giant aphids!

During this time, Ding Rui truly experienced what it was like to count money until his hands cramped and earn so much money it made him sick. The original price of 30 spirit grains per stalk of spirit rice set by Li Ang had, in the rush of invitations from spirit field cultivators these past few days, steadily climbed to 50 grains per stalk. Some spirit fields had so many giant aphids that cultivators would even give a few extra grains. Gradually, three full jars of spirit rice accumulated, each bag containing 100 grains. In total, there were thirty-seven and a half bags in the three earthen jars, with a few grains leftover.

Ding Rui had never seen such an astonishing sight. If not for Liu Yun's reminder that it was best not to continue cultivating, let alone break through to the second level of Qi Condensation, before mastering all five-element cultivation methods, he would probably have been eating them day and night. These more than three thousand spirit grains were entirely enough for him to enter the second level of Qi Condensation, possibly even reaching its peak!

Controlling spiritual energy was difficult. After years of experience, Ding Rui had developed his own understanding of cultivation. Cultivation was like driving a car. The cultivator was the driver, True Essence was the car, and the meridians in different locations were different racetracks. Learning to stably control True Essence was like taking a driving test. Moreover, the racetrack was full of potholes, and fierce winds howled everywhere. These obstacles tried their best to make the car fall apart because, apart from True Essence matching the meridian's attribute, True Essence of other attributes would inevitably be repelled when circulating through those meridians; the difference was only in strength.

Driving on this track, if one didn't control it well and the car fell apart, they would have to carry it back, repair it, and start running again from the beginning. But if a cultivator could drive the car to the finish line, they would gain the racetrack's approval. The racetrack would personally refit the car and engrave it with its unique tag, which meant successfully converting its attribute. This meant that from then on, this True Essence would be the car of that path! Once acknowledged, when the car was driven again, the potholes would be like massage chairs, only making the cultivator comfortable, and the fierce winds would only want the car to go faster and more steadily. There would definitely be no more tricks or mischief. But after that, if a new car wanted to enter this racetrack, it would also have to follow the same rules.

Twenty percent.
Twenty-one percent.
Twenty-two percent.

Every step forward in the early stages of cultivation was extremely difficult. However, practice makes perfect; it would naturally become much easier later on. Ahead was a big turn, a turn that had blocked him for three whole days. So Ding Rui became even more focused, fully immersing himself, resisting the intense repulsion and the awkward sensation caused by the turn.

Twenty-four percent!

Ding Rui pushed through! He was instantly delighted, but precisely at that moment, his concentration wavered. The True Essence he had originally gathered immediately scattered, then was dispersed by the meridians' strong repulsive force, turning into a chaotic mess and flushing out like water. Feeling the slight discomfort from his meridians, Ding Rui felt no regret, but rather excitement. Overcoming such cultivation challenges one by one was the way; he had never thought that cultivation could be accomplished in a single attempt. This was not something that could be achieved overnight but required years of accumulation and breakthroughs. Ding Rui opened his eyes, only to suddenly see an unfamiliar figure standing before him.

"Gu Hua?" Ding Rui mumbled to himself. It was the first time he had heard of this, and he was quite curious. But on the surface, he quickly reacted, returning the greeting, "No trouble at all, I happen to have time now, Junior Sister, please lead the way."
