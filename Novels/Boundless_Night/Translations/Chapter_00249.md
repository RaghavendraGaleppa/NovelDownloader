Chapter 249: Kite

Qin Ming nodded, saying, "Actually, I also feel a special closeness to you, senior. Perhaps this is destiny."

Meng Xinghai chuckled, "You rascal, you're quite thick-skinned. We've just started, and you're already so proactive. Hmm, Qingyue is indeed worthy, very exceptional."

Qin Ming smiled, letting him tease.

A moment later, however, he changed the subject, tactfully suggesting that it might be best not to propose anything further for now. Through multiple interactions, he clearly sensed that Li Qingyue would not set foot in the mundane world at present. Her temperament was becoming increasingly pure and ethereal, as if "her appearance was born from her heart." She was now transcendent, almost immortal, a truly pure practitioner of the immortal path. Their current relationship was very good, arguably that of close friends. If Grandfather Li and Meng Xinghai pushed further to arrange a match, it might backfire.

Li Qingyun sighed, "Since Qingyue entered the Pure Land Beyond this World, the near-immortal path she walks is like a kite disappearing into the night, becoming more distant the closer it gets to the sky." He was deeply worried that if the string broke, the kite would fly away, vanishing forever, perhaps even ending in tragic separation.

Meng Xinghai nodded, "Indeed, Qingyue is like unpolished jade; the more she's refined, the more brilliant she becomes, gradually revealing a foundation far beyond what ordinary people could imagine." The reclusive families naturally had their high-level cultivators, and they worried that Li Qingyue might sever her attachments, leave the mortal world, and fly too high, too far, only to be swallowed by the night sky. The Dao had just begun to flourish, and the path was far from complete. The Evernight World was full of unknowns and horrors; no one knew what truly awaited above that pitch-black firmament. Even if she was near-immortal, if the kite string snapped and she reached the deepest part of the night sky, she might still be stained with blood and fall broken. The Li family simply wished for her safety, hoping that on this land, there would always be someone she could locate, someone who could hold onto that thread.

Qin Ming said, "Grandfather Li, there's no need to worry. Qingyue has a clear understanding of herself. She herself has said that being near-immortal doesn't mean severing the path from which one came."

The matter of finding a son-in-law was temporarily put aside. However, Grandfather Li and Meng Xinghai still discussed some things about Li Qingyue. In just over two years, Li Qingyue had already stepped into the third realm of the immortal path! She had already begun "undergoing tribulation," aided by "immortal fire" baptism, her spiritual consciousness constantly being purified into pure yang. Such speed truly startled everyone. Some immortal path patriarchs were even contemplating whether to let their descendants become her Dao companions. Some Immortal Seeds also suspected if there was anything "unusual" about the Bagua Furnace, coveting it greatly. They had once invited powerful figures to borrow it for research, but gained nothing.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming frowned deeply, wanting to find an opportunity to use his Five-Colored Blade to cut down the descendants of those powerful figures and those so-called Immortal Seeds.

"These troubles have all been resolved by Qingyue herself for now."

"That's good."

The topic then lightened. Qin Ming politely declined Li Qingyun's offer; he was not suitable to visit the reclusive family at this time, as the path he had planned for himself did not allow him to stay long in one place.

...

For the next two days, Qin Ming lay low in the Mountain River Academy, not venturing out. He had been studying a remarkable technique and had begun to master the Sutra of Wither and Bloom. The main reason was that he had previously practiced the Sutra of Wither, so he picked it up exceptionally quickly this time. His original plan to visit friends was put on hold because he was quite famous among his peers, and Kunling was currently a mixed bag of individuals, with many eyes watching. Unofficial news claimed that all the titans had not yet left, and even more people were arriving. It was said that a Grandmaster Convention was currently being held in the city! Titans from the Newborn Path, Immortal Path, and Secret Path were meeting to discuss whether to unseal a portion of the Ancient Kunling region, as it contained rare and valuable resources. Of course, the top priority was the Great Reclamation, which was formally put on the agenda!

In addition, the Ancestor of the Ghost Path and the Sect Master of the Ancient Immortal Daoist Sanctuary also participated, making contact with the titans of various paths.

"Extra! Grandmasters will be lecturing on the scriptures soon!" A big piece of news exploded. Furthermore, someone revealed that Grandmasters would be ascending altars to impart their Dao teachings one after another in the coming days. For a time, Kunling City became the gathering point for heroes and talents from all directions. Many people were excited and looked forward to it immensely. And across the Night Mist World, upon hearing the news, many people rushed over on exotic beasts at high speed.

In the evening, Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu left their residence to attend a gathering at the neighboring Flying Immortal Academy. Two days earlier, they had received invitations and did not refuse, planning to participate in a so-called Young Disciples Exchange Meeting. Clearly, those who could attend were extraordinary; talent was merely the threshold.

Under the night sky, the Flying Immortal Academy covered a vast area, with magnificent buildings scattered throughout, shrouded in ethereal mist, appearing quite exceptional. A grand palace built of azure-gold stone was brightly lit. In the distance, many students watched. They were surprised to find that the academy's "Immortal Flower," Luo Lianqing, was also there, bustling about, directing people to set up the venue.

"Ah, the people coming this time are all incredible. Only disciples of Luo Immortal Fairy's caliber are qualified to attend." Many students at Flying Immortal Academy felt envious. Among them were some minor talents, but they were not on the guest list.

As night deepened, attendees arrived one after another.

"Su Shiyun from Immortal Earth and Leng Feiyue from Yang Earth have arrived together!" Some people exclaimed. Those two were very famous; anyone on the Immortal Path knew these two Immortal Seeds.

Subsequently, Zhao Yaoting, Tang Yutian, Cai Jingcheng, and others from the Secret Sect arrived, all Divine Seeds who had shown incredibly dazzling performances during the demon hunts on the plateau.

"Eh, what's wrong with the pale faces of those newcomers?" Someone noticed an anomaly. Someone guessed their identity: newly emerged Ghost Path cultivators, not people of this era. Many people's expressions changed. In ancient times, the Ghost Path was one of the most hated evil paths, having once provoked public outrage and led to joint suppression by multiple forces.

"Don't worry, with the Grandmasters present, they won't be able to stir up trouble. It's said that the Ancestor of the Ghost Path came personally, claiming that theirs is a legitimate path, not the evil path followed by those malicious ghosts." The appearance of these ancient figures caused a stir, and even those attending the meeting looked towards them.

"That's Cui Chonghe, Sun Taichu's personal disciple! His name is renowned throughout the Night Mist World. He's truly handsome and ethereal, worthy of being a near-immortal talent!" When Cui Chonghe appeared, it sparked a heated discussion. In the distance, students who practiced the Immortal Path, both male and female, showed eager gazes. Kunling had many academies and Daoist sanctuaries, and naturally, outstanding disciples were invited, such as Xin Youdao and Lu Dao, who possessed the Pure Yang Physique.

Qin Ming's appearance also drew many gazes and caused quite a stir. This was mainly because he had obtained the most auspicious beast blood during the plateau hunt this time, making it impossible for him not to attract attention. Besides focusing on Qin Ming, people also discussed Little Wu.

"The bald youth next to him is also extraordinary; he obtained over two portions of auspicious beast blood!" Wu Yaozu's hearing was sharp, and he almost went to hit someone. He swore he would never keep short hair again; this wasn't the first time he had been slandered.

"That's Qin Ming! A generational prodigy of our Newborn Path!" There were many Newborn Path practitioners here, their eyes burning with fervor, believing he would surely become a Grandmaster in the future!

"He is indeed formidable, but to truly rise, the road is long and arduous. He would at least need hundreds of years to have hope of becoming a Grandmaster," an Immortal Path disciple said. Then, someone added that this was assuming no accidents occurred! Although the people of the Newborn Path were displeased and disliked hearing such words, they were somewhat helpless; it was a fact that even their Grandmasters couldn't solve this problem.

In the grand palace built of azure-gold stone, numerous exquisite crystal lamps, embedded with sunstones, illuminated the area with dazzling, flowing light. Upon their arrival, Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu met many acquaintances who came to greet them, such as Gan Jincheng and Jiang Ruoli. In fact, many others were secretly observing him.

In Qin Ming's line of sight, a woman in purple stood out, exceptionally striking. Upon seeing him, she actually approached him actively. He was surprised, because this was not a person of the current age! Chu Pianran, clad in purple, with black hair reaching her waist, exuded an ethereal, immortal aura. Her eyebrows were like distant mountains, and her melon-seed face was exquisitely delicate. She was from an ancient immortal's Daoist sanctuary. Qin Ming felt a sense of unreality; this was an ancient person, actually appearing in the flesh. When he had first dueled her, he had thought he was "too deeply immersed in the scene," and that everything he saw was merely "scenes from the past."

Chu Pianran possessed city-toppling beauty, and was famously legendary in ancient times; some ancient texts even contained records of her. She had dueled Qin Ming with just a wisp of spiritual consciousness, only narrowly losing by a single move.

"We meet again," Chu Pianran greeted him proactively. Her bright eyes and white teeth, combined with a slight smile, had a significant impact on many of the young disciples nearby, who couldn't tear their eyes away.

"Hello, Immortal Fairy Chu. Your arrival from ancient times into reality makes me feel as if I'm dreaming," Qin Ming replied, truly feeling a sense of temporal dislocation. It was quite unusual to reunite and meet an ancient person in this manner.

"Just call me Pianran," Chu Pianran's adaptability was strong. Even though she didn't belong to this era, she could quickly integrate into the new environment.

"In that case, just call my brother 'Ming.' My name is Yaozu," Little Wu proactively chimed in. Qin Ming quickly sent him aside, as his social over-enthusiasm was acting up again.

In truth, Qin Ming really wanted to chat with this woman about some of the ancient methods, hoping to integrate them into the Newborn Path.

Chu Pianran said, "I truly never imagined that later generations would see a hundred schools of thought contend and a myriad of flowers bloom, with such vibrant and colorful paths." She also wanted to learn more about Qin Ming, as this youth's performance in same-level battles was truly abnormal. She recalled how she had never been defeated in duels among her peers in ancient times, yet in this era, she had a bloodstain left on her face by the young man before her. In ancient times, given this youth's style, he would absolutely be considered a strongman or warrior. However, having scoured ancient texts, where was there ever a strongman who could defeat an immortal?

Both of them were interested in understanding each other's fields and conversed happily. Afterwards, Qin Ming openly inquired how cultivators similar to him in ancient times cultivated, and how they could break through quickly. He had confidence in himself and didn't need her specific techniques; he merely wanted to draw inferences from one instance to others, to understand unknown domains, and for her words to provide sufficient inspiration. Of course, he didn't hold great hope, as they were not familiar with each other.

However, a casual remark by Chu Pianran caused Qin Ming to fall into a daze, deep in thought. He felt that today he had filled a crucial gap, almost forgetting some of his own advantages. Now, the path ahead was clear, and he could embark on his journey!
