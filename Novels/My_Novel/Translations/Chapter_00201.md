# Chapter 201: Suppressing the Colorful Robe, Hunting Dragons

“Follow closely.”

Madam spurred her horse forward, the white steed galloping swiftly into the forest and vanishing among the trees.

Li Xian merely wished to enjoy the pleasure of hunting, not to compete. But given the circumstances, what choice did he have? Holding the reins, he lightly shouted, “Heave,” and immediately followed suit.

Madam Wen laughed and said, “Hunting in the wild mountains is much more difficult than a hunter’s pursuit. The terrain of the mountain forest is complex, with slopes, pits, and trees obstructing the way. You must master your horse to free up the energy to slay the beasts within.”

“Furthermore, only a top-tier steed can handle mountain hunting. Ordinary, inferior horses would smell the urine of tigers or the stench of bears... their legs would go weak, and they wouldn't be able to run.”

Madam Wen rode ahead, her White Cloud nimble and agile. Suddenly, it stomped its hooves to the ground and sprang up, leaping several zhang high. White Cloud kicked off a tree trunk, its figure rising several zhang higher.

Madam took down her precious bow, nocked an arrow, and let it fly. The arrow shot out like a spirit snake, slaying a bear beast. White Cloud landed lightly, sending snow splashing into the air, highlighting Madam’s heroic aura.

A hundred zhang away, the giant bear fell to the ground.

Li Xian praised, “Madam, your shooting is divine!”

Madam Wen said, “I have already hunted a bear. If you still have no catch, you will lose miserably.”

Just as she spoke, Li Xian’s ears twitched, sensing a strange sound. Although the horse beneath him was of excellent quality, handsome and extraordinary, it could not compare to White Cloud. He stepped on the horse's back, leaped high, drew his bow, and shot.

Several miles away, a giant bear fell to the ground.

“Excellent archery!” Madam couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. She thought to herself, *What a fine young man, such spirit, such style. In terms of pure accuracy and shooting posture, I am inferior to him.*

Her heart swelled with indescribable joy. Every year during the winter hunt, she harvested plentifully, but it was inevitably a solitary pastime. There was no one to share her game with, no one to witness her beautiful shots.

Madam Wen’s competitive spirit flared. She said, “Good, only with such skill can you compete with me. Hurry and catch up.” She rode ahead once more.

The two rode one after the other. Hunting through the wild mountains, Madam enjoyed herself thoroughly. Li Xian pondered, *It seems Madam is truly competing. Since that is the case, I shall go all out. Madam is suppressing her strength, using only archery. If I still lose, wouldn't that be too useless?*

They saw another colorful deer. Madam Wen happily said, “What a colorful deer, a good omen,” and immediately nocked her bow to shoot. The arrow flew halfway.

Another arrow shot out, beating hers by a step, slaying the colorful strange deer.

Li Xian laughed and said, “Madam, I apologize, I have taken the lead!” He rode past her, moving far away.

Madam Wen raised her eyebrows and smiled helplessly. “You brat, you really don't hold back.”

*To receive without returning is not the way of courtesy.* The two rode their horses back and forth through the mountains. They saw a tiger beast drinking by a stream. Li Xian raised his bow to shoot, but Madam抢先一步, slaying the tiger beast.

Madam Wen said, “How about that?”

Li Xian said, “What does it matter if I yield to Madam?”

“Hmph, since you couldn't snatch it from me, you call it yielding. You little brat has a silver tongue. Just wait until you lose; I will punish you severely.” Madam Wen scolded with a smile.

Her tone sounded angry, but in reality, she was enjoying this taste of the moment.

The two chased after game. In the blink of an eye, night fell. The winter hunt lasted three days, so they sought a cave to stay in for the night, calling a temporary truce.

Li Xian led his horse; after a day of hunting, both were sweating.

Madam Wen said, “I will teach you the art of geomancy. In the future, if you are outside, you can use this method to find hidden caves in the mountains.”

They walked to a spot. Madam Wen said, “Look at this place. The stone walls are mottled, eroded by wind and rain over the years. Look at the trend of the mountain range; there is definitely a cave here.”

“But the cave is damp and stuffy, or there may be underground rivers. It is also a place where snake beasts and bats gather. Such a place is good for hiding, but we two need not go there.”

She pointed out the mountain conditions from afar. Following the path, they indeed found a cave. It was surrounded by venomous snakes, with a foul stench.

Madam Wen’s attainments in geomancy were profound. From the mountain terrain and vegetation, she could distinguish where there were rivers and where there were caves.

Li Xian had followed his father patrolling the mountains and knew the tricks of finding caves and probing for water. But it was all based on experience, not the root principles. Hearing Madam teach him personally today, he suddenly understood, and the thought *So that’s how it is* flashed through his mind repeatedly.

“Madam, your knowledge is vast. When will I be able to grasp even a fraction of it?” Li Xian sighed.

Madam Wen laughed softly: “You are naturally intelligent; you will learn soon enough. I just fear that once you have learned everything and your wings are hard, you will fly away.”

“How could that happen?” Li Xian refuted.

Madam Wen smiled without speaking.

They quickly found a cave, spacious and ventilated, glowing with five-colored halos inside, with stalactites of various shapes. It was like a celestial abode.

They would stay here for the night.

Madam Wen sat cross-legged on the ground, practicing her internal martial arts.

Li Xian skinned the colorful deer, sliced the meat, and skewered it into kebabs. He started a fire to roast them, sprinkling salt, herbs... various things.

\[Proficiency +2\]
\[Skill: Culinary Arts\]
\[Proficiency: 897/1500 (Minor Accomplishment)\]
\[Description: A随手一做 results in a rare delicacy. You have achieved minor accomplishment in culinary arts, knowing how to utilize everything to cook delicious food.\]

The colorful deer was a rare treasure of the mountains, its meat tender and smooth. Li Xian controlled the heat perfectly, making it crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, seasoning it just right.

The aroma of the meat drifted outward.

Madam Wen stopped her internal practice, her eyes lifting slightly.

Seeing Li Xian roasting the deer meat, the firelight illuminating his face, the youth’s visage looked quite mature. Her heart stirred: *When this boy is spirited, he is truly captivating. When he is doing things steadily, he makes one feel incredibly at ease.*

Li Xian finished roasting the meat and handed it to Madam. She chewed it slowly, finding it sweet, fresh, and fragrant, with a wonderful taste. Her status was noble, and she was accustomed to mountain delicacies and seafood. But this small roast had a unique flavor.

Madam Wen said, “When did you learn culinary arts?”

Li Xian said, “I figured it out myself. Does Madam find it tasty?”

“Not bad.” Madam Wen nodded lightly.

There was no further talk at night.

Morning arrived in the blink of an eye.

Frost and snow fell, yet the climate seemed to be warming up. Madam Wen mounted White Cloud and said with a smile, “The competition isn't over yet. If you win me, the matter of snatching game will be written off. I will also reward you handsomely. If you cannot win me, I will punish you severely.”

Day One: Madam Wen hunted four deer, seven tigers, and five bears. Li Xian hunted three deer, six tigers, and six bears. In terms of pure game, they were evenly matched.

Day Two: Li Xian hunted seven deer, seven tigers, and seven bears. His heroic and chivalrous spirit was fully displayed. Madam hunted six deer, eight tigers, and five bears, falling slightly behind.

When resting at night, Madam Wen cursed, “You have such nerve, snatching two bears from me.”

Li Xian laughed and explained. They chatted for a moment. Madam Wen said, “You, with your feathers still not fully grown, dare to be so wild. I don't know how you will treat me in the future.”

Li Xian said, “I will definitely treat Madam well.” He reached out to embrace her. Madam Wen felt tender affection and was delighted.

Over the two days, Li Xian learned many geomancy techniques. Looking at the mountains and rivers again, besides the beautiful scenery, he also saw the mountain terrain, veins of the earth, and the flow of Feng Shui.

Day Three.

Today, the winner would be decided. Although Madam Wen was strong, she treated this competition with sincerity. Just as dawn broke, she prepared for the day's archery contest.

The Bear and Tiger Mountains stretched for dozens of miles; some peaks actually belonged to no one. Madam Wen said, “White Cloud, show this little brat your prowess.”

White Cloud snorted twice, its body emitting white mist. Blue cloud patterns circulated over its entire body. With a stomp of its four hooves, it gradually left the ground. Pits and snow drifts, obstructing grass... all were ignored.

It was like walking on mist. Madam Wen shot several arrows in a row, catching three strange bears at once. How could Li Xian be willing to show weakness? He thought, *Madam says she will punish, and she surely will.*

His eyesight was sharp. Seeing that this place was crowded with bears and tigers, and there were unusually many bear beasts, a glance told him where the bears were in the distance. He immediately nocked his bow and shot three arrows in succession.

Three strange bears died instantly.

Madam Wen said, a mix of praise and reproach, “Good boy.”

The two competed to their hearts' content, making the tigers in the mountains suffer.

Meanwhile, on the other side.

The number of bears in the Bear and Tiger Mountains had increased, with scaled bears, giant strength bears, and stone-breaking bears emerging one after another. This was not natural growth.

Rather, a month ago, an uninvited guest arrived in the mountains. He had his own plans and used certain methods to create strange bear beasts.

This day, he returned from outside to find his bear children suffering heavy casualties. He cried out in shock and anger, “Who? Who shot and killed my beloved children?”

He was like a wild beast in a rage, smashing stones and trees, destroying everything in his path. After calming down, he realized the bears had died not long ago, and the凶手 were nearby.

He searched everywhere, climbing trees and leaping about, hunting for the bear-killing villains. Following the兽尸体 in the forest, he tracked the path.

Finally, he saw two figures riding horses and hunting. He let out a wail and said coldly, “You dog couple, you dog couple. I must make you wear bear skins and become my bear children.”

He leaped out fiercely, grabbing at Li Xian with one hand and Madam Wen with the other.

His momentum was like a flying dragon, his strength immense. His moves were simple and unremarkable, yet extremely powerful. Li Xian’s mind was agile, but he knew he could not block it. He rolled off his horse to avoid the killing blow.

Madam Wen struck back with a palm, printing it gently. The figure was greatly alarmed, ignoring everything else to protect himself. This palm looked light, but it concealed complex internal energy circulation.

The figure flew backward but landed steadily. Li Xian was amazed: *I have never seen anyone take Madam’s palm. This enemy is very strong!*

He silently retreated behind Madam.

Madam Wen said, “Bear Langjun?” Recognizing the person, she dismounted.

The sudden appearance was not a nobody. He was a凶 person on the Red List: Bear Langjun.

He had a strange temperament, rumored to have been raised by bears since childhood. Later, he had a strange encounter and stepped onto the path of martial arts. After washing away his impurities, he revealed the \[Red Fuzz Phase\], his entire body covered in red fuzz.

This appearance was strange and frightening. Therefore, he was not well-received, spending his days with bears. Later, he held a high position in an evil demonic sect.

Madam Wen raised her eyebrows and said, “So it is you. Then the bears I hunted today are mostly from your hand? I wondered why I encountered so many bears; it was your doing.”

Bear Langjun roared, “Wen Caishang, why did you kill my bear children!”

Madam Wen said, “I killed them because I wanted to. Do you dare ask me for an explanation?”

“Good, good. Since it is you, I can do nothing about it. I will remember this仇.” Bear Langjun turned to leave.

Madam Wen’s eyes flashed with a sharp light. *Bear Langjun’s strength is not bad. Encountering him now is likely not a coincidence. I will probe him. If necessary, I will kill him right here.*

She said, “Bear Langjun, why the rush to leave? I was just patrolling the mountains and didn't know these strange bears were all your bear children. Caishang apologizes here.”

Bear Langjun’s expression softened, greatly pleased. “Then how will you compensate me?”

“We are on the same side; why damage our relationship? At the great banquet in the future, we will need to help each other.” Wen Caishang said, “It’s not too late. You can go to the county town to catch some commoners, dress them in bear skins, and they will be bear children who listen to you again.”

“Bah, bah, bah!” Bear Langjun said, “You outsider, how could you understand the effort it takes!”

He suddenly said, “You say we are on the same side... could it be... you are also here for the Dragon Slaying Banquet?”

Li Xian thought to himself: *Again, the Shoulong Banquet and the Dragon Slaying Banquet! Madam once said that if I reach the second layer of the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword, she would take me to the banquet. What exactly is this banquet?*

Madam Wen said, “Exactly, I am with you...” She flipped her sleeve, suddenly revealing a killing move.

A long sword extended from her sleeve, soft as a ribbon. This sword was strange; it could extend and contract, like a whip or a sword.

The sword light flew纵, instantly plowing a several-zhang-long sword mark in the ground. Bear Langjun cried out in shock, “White Snake in the Sleeve...” He tried to counter, but the White Snake Soft Sword had already pierced his heart.

Bear Langjun bled endlessly, his blood actually fragrant. Madam Wen said proudly, “A mere邪贼, how dare you presume to be with me.”

Li Xian asked, “Madam, what exactly is the Shoulong Banquet?”
