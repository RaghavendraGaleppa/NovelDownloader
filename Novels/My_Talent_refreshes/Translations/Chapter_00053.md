# Chapter 53: Hidden Secrets

Zhuang Yunde hesitated for a long moment before speaking slowly:  

"It's an assignment from the sect, but we don't believe it's about land reclamation or anything like that. It's clearly a dangerous mission.  

As for what exactly this mission entails or where it takes place, I don't know either."  

At this point, Zhuang Yunde paused briefly before continuing, "And about no one returning—that's not entirely true."  

His eyes gleamed slightly.  

"From what I've heard, quite a few people have come back.  

And without exception, all of them were accepted as inner sect disciples—even those who were originally servant disciples."  

Chu Ning was momentarily stunned and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise:  

"Brother Zhuang, are you saying that even the servant disciples who were selected for the mission and returned became inner sect disciples?"  

Zhuang Yunde nodded slightly, then added, "Don't ask me why—because I don't know."  

Despite his words, Chu Ning's expression remained filled with shock and confusion.  

The leap from servant disciple to inner sect disciple was enormous.  

After all, servant disciples were typically those with four or five pseudo-spiritual roots.  

While some might stand out in the early stages of Qi Refining, by the mid-stages, they would be clearly outpaced by those with three spiritual roots or better.  

And even those with three spiritual roots in the Qingxi Sect would generally remain outer sect disciples unless they possessed some other outstanding talent.  

Inner sect disciples were an entirely different matter—each one was a prodigy.  

Take Mu Ling, for example. Despite being related to a Golden Core elder, she remained an outer sect disciple due to her insufficient cultivation talent.  

This showed just how difficult it was to become an inner sect disciple in the Qingxi Sect.  

These were disciples with genuine potential to reach Foundation Establishment.  

Yet now, servant disciples who survived the mission could become inner sect disciples.  

That...  

Chu Ning's expression darkened slightly. He wasn't envious of their promotion—he was considering just how dangerous this mission must be.  

At this moment, Zhuang Yunde managed a faint smile.  

"If I return, perhaps I'll have the chance to tell you more about it."  

Chu Ning couldn't help but ask, "Since you know the mission is so dangerous, why did you choose to go? Was it mandatory?"  

"Not exactly," Zhuang Yunde shook his head.  

"Outer sect disciples serving as attendants actually have some autonomy in this matter. I volunteered to go this time."  

He paused, then continued, "I've been stuck at the ninth level of Qi Refining for too long. Forget Foundation Establishment—I haven't even been able to touch the peak of Qi Refining for ages. So..."  

Chu Ning sighed inwardly, understanding Zhuang Yunde's reasoning.  

Clearly, this senior brother was unwilling to remain stagnant in his cultivation, even if his current life was comfortable. He wanted to take the risk for a chance at advancement.  

To pursue the Great Dao of immortality?  

Even after leaving Zhuang Yunde's courtyard, Chu Ning couldn't stop thinking about the matter.  

He wondered what he would do if faced with such a choice.  

The answer came quickly.  

Survival first.  

To seek immortality, one must first preserve their life.  

With this realization, Chu Ning felt much more at ease.  

Zhuang Yunde had also mentioned that if he wanted more options in the future, he should strive to shed his status as a servant disciple and enter the outer sect.  

But these considerations were still somewhat distant for Chu Ning.  

For now, his immediate priority was to pass the promotion assessment for the third-tier fields.  

Thus, after leaving Zhuang Yunde, Chu Ning sought out He Changyou.  

"You want to take the third-tier promotion assessment? If I recall correctly, you joined the sect just a year and a half ago?"  

He Changyou looked at Chu Ning with surprise, though his expression also showed approval.  

"Reaching the fourth level of Qi Refining in just a year and a half...  

I remember you chose to cultivate Dark Spirit Bamboo, so your spell cultivation must be decent as well."  

As he spoke, He Changyou retrieved a jade slip from his storage bag, presumably to record Chu Ning's registration details.  

"While the chances of passing the third-tier assessment at the fourth level of Qi Refining are slim, I still encourage you to try. Treat it as practice.  

Our Spirit Plantation Division does need fresh talent to emerge."  

After returning the jade slip to his storage bag, He Changyou added, "Your performance has been commendable. It's good to compete with your seniors. The assessment will be held in half a month."  

"Thank you, Steward!" Chu Ning bowed respectfully before taking his leave.  

His relationship with He Changyou wasn't as close as with Zhuang Yunde, so there was little else to discuss.  

Over the next half-month, Chu Ning truly followed through on his words to Zhuang Yunde—using spirit stones to enhance his cultivation.  

However, his goal wasn't to stabilize the fourth level of Qi Refining.  

Instead, he aimed to further consolidate his fifth-level foundation in preparation for advancing to the sixth level.  

After all, once the Dark Spirit Bamboo was harvested, he could no longer rely on casting Verdant Spring Art on it for cultivation.  

Though he still had Ironvine in his courtyard, its effectiveness paled in comparison.  

By cultivating with one spirit stone daily and supplementing with Verdant Spring Art on the Ironvine, Chu Ning's progress didn't slow.  

If anything, it accelerated slightly—gaining about 5 proficiency points every two days.  

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. On the morning of the assessment, Chu Ning concluded his cultivation session and checked his progress:  

[Evergreen Wood Art (Yellow Low Grade), Second Layer (400/900)]  
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unyielding Bones (140/600)]  
[Soul Refining Art, First Layer (101/1000)]  

The Evergreen Wood Art's second layer had reached 400 proficiency points.  

Based on his earlier estimates, reaching 200 had brought him to the fifth level of Qi Refining, so 500 should correspond to the sixth level.  

Once he secured a third-tier field and cultivated suitable spirit plants, those remaining 100 points should come quickly.  

In contrast, his progress in body tempering and soul refinement remained steady, with no obvious methods to accelerate them.  

Feeling refreshed and energetic, Chu Ning left his courtyard—today was the day of the third-tier promotion assessment.  

*Creak!*  

At the same moment, the neighboring courtyard's door opened, revealing Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang.  

Spotting Chu Ning, Lu Yunfang greeted him warmly.  

"Junior Brother Chu, up so early even during the farming off-season?"  

She blinked playfully.  

"Could you be heading to the third-tier assessment too?"  

Chu Ning was momentarily taken aback. "Senior Brother and Sister are also taking the assessment?"  

Lu Yunfang nodded.  

"We've finished harvesting the fields we were temporarily assigned. Such a small plot isn't enough for us.  

Naturally, we're taking the promotion assessment. But you, Junior Brother..."  

She studied Chu Ning intently before continuing, "Reaching the fourth level of Qi Refining so quickly and already attempting the assessment—your talent is truly enviable."  

Luo Hongping nodded repeatedly beside her, his gaze fixed on Chu Ning.  

Chu Ning inwardly groaned. He hadn't expected his usual low profile to backfire at this moment, drawing their attention.  

He forced an awkward smile and shook his head.  

"I just got lucky. The steward said my affinity with the Evergreen Wood Art was particularly strong.  

But this assessment is just to test my luck—how could I compare to you seniors?"  

Exchanging hollow pleasantries, the three set off together toward the assessment grounds.
