# Chapter 7: Ascending the Summit (Part 1)

Three suns hung high in the sky, the weather clear and bright.

The bone-feeling segment had ended, but the commotion on the scene remained. Many who had not passed the test stayed behind to watch the excitement.

Before the disciples who had successfully entered the sect were two mountain paths leading to the summit of Qingyuan Mountain.

One was the path usually used by sect members for entry and exit.

The other was overgrown with wild grass, exuding an ancient and extraordinary aura.

This was the famous Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps.

Legend had it that the founder of the Qingyuan Sect accidentally obtained this strange treasure. It was incomplete and suspected to be a relic from an ancient sect of a bygone era, used to test the sect's disciples.

"Those who climb ten steps may enter the Outer Sect."

"Those who climb fifty steps may enter the Inner Sect."

"Those who ascend to the eightieth layer are True Disciples."

A short, plump old man stood before the Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps, his voice ringing out clearly.

"What if one reaches the top?" someone asked confidently.

It was none other than Wang Hu.

The corner of the old man's mouth curled up, as if he had answered this question many times before: "The founder once said that the one who reaches the summit shall become the Sect Master's True Disciple."

"However, looking through the history of the sect, though there have been countless geniuses, only two or three have ever achieved this."

"Those few all possessed top-tier A-grade aptitude. Do not be overly ambitious, and you will be able to go higher."

He paused after saying this.

Those words were meant for the majority.

Wasn't there a little girl with exceptionally great talent this year?

"Elder, wouldn't those who are strong and robust, or have practiced martial arts beforehand, have an advantage?" another person asked.

The short, plump elder replied patiently, "There is no need to worry. The stone steps will suppress one's vital energy and blood."

After enlightening the crowd, he waved his hand grandly. "You have one hour. Begin."

As his words fell, a disciple inserted a finger-thick, long incense into a bronze censer.

The timing had begun, but everyone looked at each other, and no one wanted to be the first to step up.

"A bunch of cowards. I'll go first!"

Wang Hu walked with an arrogant swagger and stepped onto the stone steps.

Instantly, he felt the vital energy and blood in his body cease their boiling, unable to provide him with strength beyond that of a normal person.

However, he still proudly took another step.

Ten steps... twenty steps...

At the thirty-step mark, his body began to sway.

Simultaneously, a faint tiger's roar echoed from within him, resisting the immense pressure.

It also supported him as he crossed the fiftieth step.

The others let out cries of surprise.

He had entered the Inner Sect.

With someone testing the waters, the others followed suit. After all, the incense was still burning; the wasted time might be enough to climb one more step.

The speed of the ascent varied, but none of the expressions were relaxed. The pressure coming from all directions grew greater the higher one went, making it hard to breathe.

"That's Lin Jiang, isn't it? He's moving quite fast."

"Muan Xiao is even faster!"

"Why are they so relaxed?"

The people discussing were in the minority; most were straining themselves and climbing with their heads down.

Until Ying Bing stepped onto the steps.

Everyone's attention was unconsciously drawn to her.

After all, everyone was curious.

They wanted to see how far this cold, young girl, rated as having A-grade root bones, could go.

"The complete stone steps can also test one's temperament," Ying Bing murmured, feeling the faint pressure as she shook her head slightly.

Moreover, these Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps were too ancient.

They would likely lose their effectiveness before long.

The figure, resembling an ice lotus, grew higher and higher.

Ten steps... twenty steps... thirty steps...

As if walking on flat ground?!

The height seemed to have no effect on her at all, and she quickly left the others behind.

Everyone was stunned.

This wasn't a question of whether she could reach the top anymore.

She was clearly here to break the record for the fastest ascent time!

Her aptitude was probably the best among the A-grade talents in the history of the Qingyuan Sect!

Ying Bing ascended step by step.

Soon, she reached the fifty-fourth step.

"Huh?"

Wang Hu suddenly noticed the silence behind him. He turned his head and felt a chill run through his limbs.

The young girl's gaze was like snow beneath frost.

It was as if he was being looked at by the cold moon hanging high in the clouds, overlooking all living beings.

In that instant, he instinctively dared not meet her eyes and stepped aside.

"The center of attention," Li Mo sighed inexplicably.

Some people are cold on the outside but warm on the inside; others are warm on the outside but cold on the inside.

This was the first time he had seen someone like the Ice Cube, who was frosty on the outside and domineering on the inside.

Thinking this, he also made his move.

Holding back?

Out of the question.

The higher he climbed, the higher his status within the sect would be in the future, and the easier it would be to come into contact with those with good Heavenly Destiny.

He hadn't "plucked the wool" from the Ice Cube enough yet.

Furthermore, he also wanted to see how far he could go.

He was measured as Grade C.

He still didn't know what his aptitude actually was.

What level is a Celestial Body in this world of martial arts?

Waiting online, it's urgent.

He stepped onto the path.

Hmm?

"Isn't this just an ordinary stone staircase?"

Li Mo tilted his head and took a single step, crossing three layers at once.

...

On the high platform.

"I like that little girl Ying Bing's personality!"

Watching the young girl pass through like a snowstorm, the woman in palace attire had eyes shining with excitement. Her exaggerated movements made her already voluptuous figure even more eye-catching.

"Can these two little brats get together?"

Xue Jing stroked his long beard, thoughtfully.

In the letter he received, his former disciple—Li Mo's father—had mentioned wanting Ying Bing as his future daughter-in-law.

Looking at it now...

This future granddaughter-in-law might not be so certain.

With a Grade C root bone, how could he possibly become a True Disciple... hmm?

Xue Jing suddenly saw the figure of a young boy striding briskly on the mountain path.

"Senior Brother Sect Master, why don't you give that little girl to me? I'll definitely teach her well!" the woman in palace attire promised, patting her chest while drunk.

The high-ranking officials couldn't bear to look, and they spoke up one after another:

"Give it up! Out of twenty-four hours a day, you sleep for twelve and are drunk for the other twelve!"

"Sister Shang Wu, just let them be. Don't corrupt a good genius."

"No, absolutely not! Even if you beat this old man to death, I won't agree!"

The elders were all moved to take her as a disciple.

But on this matter, they were unanimous: anyone could teach her, but she absolutely could not become a disciple of the Ninth Peak's elder, Shang Wu.

Just then.

Suddenly.

A clear and melodious phoenix cry rang out through the heavens.

Look.

Ying Bing was already standing at the end of the Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps.

Crows, magpies, wild geese, eagles... Countless birds swept in from all directions, obediently circling around her.

Countless people in the field stood dumbfounded, not knowing what was happening.

But on the viewing platform, the high-ranking officials of the Qingyuan Sect felt something.

Behind Ying Bing, they seemed to see a moon-white bird, its feathers resplendent, its aura bright, noble, and mysterious.

The Sect Master of the Qingyuan Sect, who had remained silent all along, suddenly stood up.

"This girl can condense the form of a hundred birds! Gather the Phoenix spirit! Manifest the scene of the Great Yin!" Shang Cangming's gaze was burning.

...

The others on the Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps could not see the phenomenon.

But they also heard the earth-shattering cry and saw the hundred birds circling.

Wang Hu was even more disbelieving.

That fairy-like背影 was only forty steps away from him.

Just as his eyes were filled with naked possessiveness and he was about to rush up a few more steps.

*Tap—*

A footstep sounded from behind.

Li Mo?

How did he get up here?

"You must have used some trick to fool the Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps!"

"You want to stand next to her? Get down for me!"

Wang Hu's eyes were bloodshot, his face gloomy.

Gritting his teeth against the pressure, he reached out to grab Li Mo's collar and throw him down.

Li Mo: "?"

The other's movements were as slow as a turtle in his eyes.

He still wasn't behaving even at this point?

He, Li Mo, really had no interest in slapping faces.

"Hehehe, the rules don't say you can't make a move on the stone steps..."

"Oh? What did you say?"

"I said..."

*Bang—*

Little Li delivered a kick right to the groin.

There is a kind of pain called "it hurts just looking at it."

The young men who saw this scene all felt a chill down below.

"Ugh..."

Wang Hu's face instantly turned the color of a pig's liver.

The intense pain made him unable to stand steady, let alone the immense pressure he was already enduring on the stone steps.

"Ahhh..."

The sound of screaming and rolling gradually faded away.

"Quick, get out of the way!"

Someone shouted a warning. Fortunately, everyone dodged in time and wasn't hit by Wang Hu, who was tumbling down like a gourd.

"Much quieter."

Li Mo shrugged and continued walking up.

A steward had looked at him just now but didn't say anything.

It seemed Wang Hu was right.

There really was no rule on the Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps prohibiting attacks on others.

It's just that everyone isn't in a competitive relationship. To expend energy to spite someone else is to harm the enemy at a cost of eight hundred to oneself. That's why no one had done it before.

"That young man looks sunny when he smiles, but he's really ruthless."

"Wait, that's not the point."

"Didn't he have Grade C aptitude?"

Suddenly, someone spoke, and everyone finally reacted.

That's right, something's wrong!

How did he climb to the fiftieth layer... no, now he's already at the eightieth!

The way he walked as if in a courtyard was also relaxed and carefree.

If Ying Bing's performance made everyone shocked and envious, then for Li Mo, it was completely bewildering.

Are you telling me this is Grade C?!

"Elder Han, didn't you make a mistake when you felt his bones?" the short, plump middle-aged elder asked, doubtful and uncertain.

The old woman who had just felt Li Mo's bones changed her expression and could only whisper, "Perhaps this old woman is getting on in years and my eyes are failing me."

With these words, the high-ranking officials fell into thought.

That steward had a sharp eye and was experienced.

Could she really have made a mistake feeling the bones?

In the time it took to say a few words.

Over there, the figure at the summit had already changed from one to two.

Ying Bing's eyes flashed with surprise.

Reaching the top?

In her eyes, this was not difficult.

Even if the Heaven-Scaling Stone Steps were complete, she had encountered countless people who could reach the top.

But among them, there was no him!

The wind blew gently, and Li Mo's robes fluttered. He smiled and said, "What a coincidence, you're here too."

Looking down at the small mountains, a sense of openness filled his chest.

It was a beautiful moment, but there was a crow that didn't understand the moodiness.

It landed with a *plop* on the young man's head.
