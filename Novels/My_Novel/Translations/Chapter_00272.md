# Chapter 272: The Zang Meridians Succeed, the Heart Achieves Clarity, the Qi Lake Transforms, and a Peerless Appearance Emerges

Li Xian’s Qi Lake churned violently, a tempest raging within him, thunder roaring and rumbling. He stood tall and proud, sensing the changes within. His long hair billowed, tinged with a faint red glow.

He looked ethereal and divine, his appearance rarely seen in this world. His physique grew ever more perfect; it was no wonder Wen Caishang was so infatuated. He exhaled a mouthful of white mist that coiled around his body, thick and unyielding.

His Qi Lake had transformed.

His internal Qi now contained more comprehension of the myriad things. All martial arts and martial paths became slightly stronger. Li Xian seized this golden opportunity to refine the filth of his five viscera, achieving excellent results.

Soon, it was the hour of Yin and Mao (3-7 AM). The deck was crowded with people practicing martial arts to accumulate internal Qi. Li Xian found an empty spot and practiced the "Intestine-Coiling Small Step" again to stimulate his气血 (blood and qi), soften his tendons, and relax his bones.

He then switched to practicing the "Flying Snake Hand." The Flying Snake Hand focused on softness and viciousness. Every strike targeted the opponent's weak points, attacking by surprise with great effect. Li Xian had already mastered all basic martial arts, allowing him to grasp the essence of the Flying Snake Hand quickly.

\[You practiced the Flying Snake Hand, Proficiency +3\]
\[You practiced the Flying Snake Hand, Proficiency +4\]

The more Martial Dao True Intent he accumulated, the faster his practice speed. Before the hour of Yin was even over, Li Xian had already achieved proficiency, showing significant results, and his Qi Lake expanded slightly.

He was delighted. He didn't look down on the Flying Snake Hand being basic; every tiny bit of progress was visible. Accumulating day by day, he could eventually climb the ten-thousand-mile mountain.

Li Xian practiced tirelessly, forgetting himself in his training. The nominal disciples of the Flower Cage Sect had long since stopped to rest and chat. Yet Li Xian continued, rehearsing his martial techniques.

Ye Cheng looked down from the third floor and nodded silently. Qiao Sanyan saw Li Xian's diligence and, originally planning to rest, forced his tired body to continue practicing.

Thus, the hour of Mao passed.

\[Proficiency +3\]
\[Flying Snake Hand\]
\[Proficiency: 798/1000 (Proficient)\]

Satisfied with his progress, Li Xian leaned against the railing and gazed at the river surface. It was deep in the night, and the full moon shone brightly. The river waves shimmered, sparkling with points of light.

The river wind blew, making him feel as if he were at the sea. Li Xian undid his chest clothes, letting the wind blow against him, dispersing the sweat and heat. It felt incredibly comfortable.

He couldn't help but sigh at how the mountains were higher and the rivers wider in this world, making people seem even smaller. The turbulent river surface hid dangers and ruthlessness.

Suddenly, there were several "thud" sounds. The flower ship dropped anchor, stopping in the middle of the river. Ye Cheng's clear voice rang out: "Everyone, it's time to wash up!"

The Flower Cage Sect disciples undid their clothes, shoes, and socks. They jumped into the river one after another, swimming and bathing. Li Xian, having the signs of the second realm of the Martial Dao, feared water like fire. He merely watched from afar on the deck and did not go down to play.

The sky gradually brightened.

Li Xian returned to his cabin. He sat cross-legged and practiced internally, thinking of a foolproof escape strategy. Nourishing his blood and qi, time passed, and it was noon again.

He thought to himself: "Walking the Jianghu, how can one be relaxed and carefree? Since I have no good plan, I might as well take it as it is for now."

In the hall, Li Xian brought his dishes and ate alone. The food today was decent, with two large pieces of fatty meat. Li Xian flashed back to his days as a servant and cleaned his plate.

He then picked up the lunchbox and headed towards the lower deck. The Flower Cage Sect disciples whispered among themselves: "This new guy isn't easy to deal with; he seems to have brought his own skills." "Yeah, just look at his walk, steady and heavy, you can tell." "Sigh, he's so handsome, it's really unfair. Even those two poisonous flowers are willing to let him feed them." "I guess he'll be promoted soon."

Inside the玄铁 (Mysterious Iron) prison cell, Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao hung silently, already asleep. Their disheveled and狼狈 (wretched) appearance remained unchanged.

Li Xian coughed lightly. Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao woke up. Since being hung here, they hadn't been put down for a moment. They swayed with the ship's movement, suffering all sorts of grievances without words.

Moreover, the cabin was pitch black, and the oil lamp was dim, so they didn't know the time. Seeing Li Xian holding the lunchbox to feed them again, they realized another day had passed.

Nan Gong Liuli's mind was weary; she felt time was both fast and slow. She glared at Li Xian and cursed him as a "grandson thief" twice, her mouth gagged.

Li Xian undid the iron chains and entered the cell. He placed his hand under their chins, gently used his Qi to pull, and the gags and walnuts fell out. Nan Gong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao turned their heads away, their cheeks flushed, truly losing face.

Li Xian smiled and said, "Did you sleep well?" Nan Gong Liuli said coldly, "Good or not, what's it to you? You grandson thief, just feed this old lady and be done with it."

Li Xian said, "Why get angry? I just thought you were bored and stifled, so I'm using the feeding time to chat with you to relieve the boredom."

Nan Gong Liuli said, "We have nothing to say to you." Bian Qiaoqiao nodded in agreement. Nan Gong Liuli was usually gentle and graceful, with the demeanor of a noble lady. But her curses were sharp and cold.

Li Xian said, "I don't think so." He unhurriedly opened the lunchbox and introduced today's dishes one by one.

Li Xian smiled and said, "I'll feed Sister Bian first today." Bian Qiaoqiao scolded, "Who is your Sister Bian? How shameless."

Li Xian used chopsticks to pick up meat and vegetables and brought them to her mouth. Bian Qiaoqiao opened her mouth and swallowed, chewing slowly. She ate with a restless heart, feeling very strange. She looked closely at Li Xian; seeing his handsome appearance and simple clothing, although he was a Flower Cage Sect member, he lacked the vulgar and annoying air.

Bian Qiaoqiao said, "Hey, why did you join the Flower Cage Sect? Why don't you let me go? I'll recommend you to the Dao Xuan Mountain?"

Nan Gong Liuli sighed lightly: "My silly sister, why are you saying such foolish things?"

Li Xian was curious about Dao Xuan Mountain and took the opportunity to ask: "Dao Xuan Mountain? Never heard of it. Is it half as powerful as my Flower Cage Sect?"

Bian Qiaoqiao angrily said: "Your third-rate trash sect dares to compare with my Dao Xuan Mountain? Haha, truly laughable."

Nan Gong Liuli remained silent. Dao Xuan Mountain was indeed powerful, but the Flower Cage Sect was not ordinary either. Li Xian said: "Is that so? I don't think so."

Bian Qiaoqiao said: "My Dao Xuan Mountain has outstanding talents and spiritual lands, with prodigies emerging one after another, and countless talents. It is a famous power in the Southern Heaven Domain and even the vast Great Empire. There is a saying... the authentic martial arts of the world, none can surpass the Ancient Buddhist Temple in the North, and the Dao Xuan Mountain in the South."

Li Xian sneered: "Just blowing your own trumpet. With my strength, I might just be able to beat up all the younger generation of Dao Xuan Mountain."

Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli sneered in unison. Recalling yesterday's fight, the two sisters联手 (joined forces) and lost, but that was because their hands and feet were restricted. Li Xian's strength was passable, but compared to the prodigies of Dao Xuan Mountain, he was far inferior. Nan Gong Liuli mocked: "Ignorant and ridiculous."

Bian Qiaoqiao said proudly: "You little nobody. You can't even beat me, and you dare to talk big?"

Li Xian raised an eyebrow: "Who says I can't beat you?"

He reached out and pressed Bian Qiaoqiao's shoulder, giving a gentle push. Bian Qiaoqiao cried out in surprise, swinging back and forth uncontrollably. She twisted her waist, trying to stop the swaying. But it only made her look more狼狈 (wretched), to no avail.

Li Xian smiled: "Convinced?" Bian Qiaoqiao said: "Convinced... convinced. Please stop it." Li Xian steadied her.

Bian Qiaoqiao said fiercely: "You're just bullying me because I have no hands or feet. If I had freedom of movement, I'd defeat you in three moves. Do you dare?"

Li Xian said: "So bold, you little girl, so arrogant?!" Seeing Li Xian taking the bait, Nan Gong Liuli quickly added fuel to the fire: "Sister Bian, you're making things difficult for him. This kind of shameless rascal, what ability does he have? He definitely wouldn't dare."

Li Xian said: "Wouldn't dare? Fine, saying I wouldn't dare! Then let's give it a try!" He stepped forward. Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli were ecstatic.

Li Xian suddenly stopped. His angry expression faded, and he smiled: "The provocation is too clumsy, it's useless on me." Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli couldn't help but be angry, realizing Li Xian was deliberately teasing them. Poor sisters, being toyed with by the thief, powerless to fight back.

Bian Qiaoqiao puffed up her cheeks, furious, and struggled violently, making the flower ropes creak. Li Xian said: "Speaking of Dao Xuan Mountain, is it really that powerful?" He picked up a piece of wine-braised venison and put it in his mouth.

Bian Qiaoqiao saw that her bound body didn't move and her sharpness was blunted. She chewed slowly, satisfying her appetite, and said: "Naturally." Li Xian said: "Then how did you get captured?"

Bian Qiaoqiao angrily said: "It's all because you used despicable means. If we fought with swords, I wouldn't have been captured."

Li Xian said: "I see." Bian Qiaoqiao's eyes reddened: "I've lost face for Dao Xuan Mountain."

Li Xian said: "It seems Dao Xuan Mountain isn't that impressive. All thunder and no rain. Think about it... your elite disciples were captured by us. Doesn't that mean, in the younger generation... my Flower Cage Sect is far superior to you?"

Bian Qiaoqiao angrily said: "Nonsense! Although I was captured, I killed quite a few Flower Cage bandits."

Nan Gong Liuli said淡淡 (calmly): "You are arrogant and shallow, knowing nothing of the world. I suppose you haven't seen true prodigies."

Li Xian said: "Is that so? Please, Fairy Liuli, explain it to me in detail." Hearing the words "Fairy," Nan Gong Liuli felt very shy. She thought to herself, in this situation, the only similarity she had with a fairy was that her feet weren't touching the ground, floating in the air.

Nan Gong Liuli frowned and hesitated. She couldn't stand Li Xian's arrogance and said: "Flower Cage Sect disciples have narrow眼界 (vision), that's not wrong. The mistake is your arrogance and ridiculous words."

"True prodigies, with jade embryos and porcelain foundations, have a divine appearance and demeanor, born different from others. They possess different physiques, astonishing悟性 (comprehension), Martial Dao foundations, Art Dao inheritances, nurturing methods... You've probably never even heard of these secrets, so how could you know the intricacies and the vast differences in power?"

Li Xian thought: "Ordinary martial artists indeed find it hard to hear about these. But thanks to Madam's nurturing, I have heard of them. On this point... I truly need to thank Madam. The Martial Dao path, because of her, I walk steadily." His mind drifted.

Nan Gong Liuli saw Li Xian's spirit wandering, thinking he was shocked. She felt relieved and said: "Forget it, speaking too deeply, you thief wouldn't understand anyway."

"The Dao Xuan Mountain's Golden Boy and Jade Girl, I won't even mention them. You thief, hehe, aren't even qualified to hear their names."

Bian Qiaoqiao said: "Not qualified at all. Sister Zhao is such a person, Brother Ji is such a hero. You肮脏 (filthy) bandit, you'll never be able to窥探 (spy on) them in your lifetime."

Nan Gong Liuli strongly agreed. Li Xian didn't get angry at all, thinking: "How powerful they are, what does it have to do with me? I only compete with myself, moving forward step by step."

His mindset was firm, undisturbed by praise or criticism.

Nan Gong Liuli frowned and continued: "Dao Xuan Mountain gathers the spirit of outstanding talents and spiritual lands. Below the Golden Boy and Jade Girl, there are the Four Gentlemen: Bamboo, Wind, Stream, and Stone. They are all elegant and handsome, surpassing you by a thousand or ten thousand times."

"Then there are the Three Heroes: Sword, Book, and Talisman. They are dozens of times superior to you..."

She listed the prodigies and heroes of Dao Xuan Mountain one by one. Using this to attack Li Xian, mocking him for how unworthy and despicable he was.

Li Xian secretly pondered, starting to get a vague outline of Dao Xuan Mountain. It凝聚 (condensed) the trend of outstanding talents and spiritual lands, standing towering and majestic, shining for future generations.

Bian Qiaoqiao was also a top talent. But she was born playful, lazy in practicing martial arts, and had very little experience. So her performance was quite poor. But even so, her bone structure was excellent, her Martial Dao was very strong, and her internal Qi was condensed.

Many disciples of major sects drank精宝 (treasures) from a young age. Nourishing their physique, slowly building their foundation, they led by a huge margin. Li Xian had gone through奇遇 (fortuitous encounters) and dangers,消化 (digesting) the treasures very quickly. But years of practice couldn't compare to their hard work since childhood.

There was definitely a gap.

Not to mention other things... the prodigies in the provincial city in their twenties, thirties, and forties, accumulating for decades, must not be weak. Li Xian had only glimpsed them, feeling very shallowly. It was all because his realm was too low at the time, and Wen Caishang was too powerful.

He fought his way through. He couldn't see the厉害 (powerfulness) of others at all; the killing moves they had practiced for decades had no chance to be used before they were heavily injured.

Li Xian benefited greatly, realizing the strength of his peers. He was neither excited nor sad. The candlelight shone on his calm face, self-reliant and elegant.

Nan Gong Liuli's words were poisonous, her sarcastic remarks deliberately emphasized, trying to make him feel inferior and lose confidence. She took the opportunity to observe Li Xian's face, only to see calmness and composure.

Nan Gong Liuli wondered: "This person isn't angry? Can a Flower Cage Sect disciple have such cultivation? Strange and strange..." She saw Li Xian's eyebrows were heroic, and he有意 (intentionally) used stray hair to cover his face. But his handsome features couldn't be completely hidden.

The candlelight was dim. Nan Gong Liuli knew this thief was extremely handsome, but due to the candlelight halo and angle, she couldn't see him fully.

Li Xian had quite a connection with Dao Xuan Mountain. His predecessor, Huang Fu Mountain, contained Earth Essence·Earth魁 (Earth魁). He wanted to obtain the Art Dao·Sword Control... he would eventually need to go there once.

Bian Qiaoqiao was fed, and it was Nan Gong Liuli's turn. Li Xian mixed the food, which looked delicious, and brought it to her mouth. Nan Gong Liuli pressed her red lips tight, hesitated for a moment, and opened her mouth to eat.

They chatted casually during the process. Li Xian was glib-tongued. The two sisters disliked his identity and didn't want to say half a word more to him. But he could always find a topic to get them talking.

After Nan Gong Liuli finished eating, Li Xian收拾 (cleaned up) the lunchbox, swept away the scattered food, picked up the walnuts, and put them back in their original place.

He made a gesture and left潇洒 (elegantly). Nan Gong Liuli pondered: "This boy's actions are watertight. His temperament is steady. I insulted him so much just now, but he was neither angry nor indignant."

The two sisters let out two muffled cries. The yellow lamp and wooden walls around them creaked and swayed. As if forgotten by the world, the only sign of life was Li Xian's feeding.

Li Xian walked out of the lower cabin and didn't meet Ye Cheng.

"This Ye Cheng has absolute control over the cabin. He掌握 (masters) the secrets of the ship's mechanism. He can go wherever he wants easily."

"It's still early now. My Heavy Pupil can observe the细微 (minute details), seeing through things. Why not secretly observe the layout of the ship's mechanism?"

He微睁 (slightly opened) his Heavy Pupil, moving in the dark. His gaze穿透 (pierced) the wooden panels,窥探 (spying) the layout inside. As expected, it contained a hidden world. Countless mechanisms and hidden mechanisms, densely packed, seamless, and extremely precise.

It concealed the changes of the Eight Trigrams, the profound principles of Yin and Yang. Countless hidden doors and岔道 (forked paths), touching one hair moves the whole body... Although Li Xian could窥探 (spy on) a corner, he had no clue at all.

Suddenly, his eyes stung.

This profound mechanism, its principles were too deep. Li Xian stared for a long time, and his mind ached. Moreover, the ship's material was not ordinary. It was very solid, with various effects like sound insulation and Qi blocking.

Li Xian guessed that to figure out the ship's structure and hidden mechanisms would be very difficult. With his current knowledge, he probably couldn't do it. But if he just窥探 (spied on) parts of it and slowly studied it, he might be able to弄清楚 (figure it out).

He returned to his room without showing any expression. After practicing internally for a while, he found Qiao Sanyan and asked to borrow some paper, a brush, and ink. Qiao Sanyan was very enthusiastic and was willing to lend them, also asking Li Xian how his "Flying Snake Hand" was coming along.

Li Xian smiled and应付 (responded). He got the paper and brush and locked his room. He didn't hide his Heavy Pupil and emptied his mind... The details of the room were all captured in his mind.

There were no mechanisms in the room.

He放心 (felt at ease) to透视 (see through). He透视ed (saw through) the wooden ship walls to observe the internal mechanisms. The surroundings were very solid, with nothing to exploit. He sighed with regret: "If only there were some细微 (minute) mechanisms here that I could spot. Allowing me to escape silently from here, that would be truly wonderful."

He regained his patience. Gradually looking outward, he suddenly saw yellow-green and deep black lights deep inside the ship. He focused his gaze and observed; they were two "jade stones."

Engraved with the words "Jade City."

Li Xian thought: "Ah! This ship is from Jade City! No wonder it's so exquisitely made."

Going along the river, appreciating dragons and屠龙 (slaying dragons). At the屠龙宴 (Dragon Slaying Banquet), there were masters from Jade City present. Li Xian observed from the side and heard Wen Caishang mention it twice, praising the city highly.

She said: "The greatest wealth in the world is none other than Jade City." Jade City's wealth could rival the Great Wu Empire. Many treasures and secret collections, if hard to find outside, could be found in Jade City.

Jade City was擅长 (skilled) in various paths of mechanisms. That this ship was produced by Jade City and was extremely fine was not surprising. Li Xian had no gains for the time being. Using his memory, he drew the mechanisms he saw on paper.

The ship walls were special;透视ing (seeing through) them consumed a lot of eyesight. Li Xian drew on the paper, then carefully considered and thought about the use of the mechanisms. Wen Caishang was proficient in all paths, and must be extremely精 (expert). Alchemy, medicinal cuisine, martial arts, music, calligraphy, appreciation... She could be called a rare genius.

In the path of mechanisms. She admitted to only浅尝辄止 (dabbling superficially), not worth mentioning. She hadn't studied systematically, but she had been to Jade City several times. What she saw and heard subtly influenced her, and she knew a little.

However, many匠师 (craftsmen) were actually inferior to her. Li Xian had a nature for learning. In martial arts, calligraphy, medicinal cuisine... all paths, he learned from Wen Caishang. Even "conducting oneself in society," "profit calculation," and "Jianghu experience" were all灌输 (instilled), taught, trained, and influenced by Wen Caishang.

Li Xian was a person of two lifetimes. If one were to say who influenced him the most, it would undoubtedly be Wen Caishang. She was both teacher and wife, both enemy and lover, seemingly clear yet entangled... a mix of everything. Li Xian discarded his杂思 (miscellaneous thoughts) and carefully studied the mechanism diagrams, researching them deeply.

When his spirit was exhausted, he would sit cross-legged and practice internally, refining the filth of his five viscera. When his blood was充 (full) and沛 (abundant), he would switch to practicing the "Vomiting Blood Classic." Proficiency accumulated, making daily progress.

Thus, on the flower ship, he had not a moment of闲 (leisure). During the hours of Yin and Mao, he practiced the "Flying Snake Hand." He rested for two hours each day.

The next day.

It was mealtime again. Li Xian held the lunchbox,装满 (filled) with good food. After all, as captives, they only had one meal a day. Li Xian pitied the two sisters' miserable state. Although he was very rude in his dealings, he tried to pick out enough food.

It was no wonder Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli refused to eat. The Flower Cage Sect was a mixed bag of fish and dragons, with many cunning people. They saw the two sisters in distress, from noble backgrounds. Although they couldn't touch or play with them, they definitely had to find ways to tease them.

They would always spit a few mouthfuls of saliva or thick phlegm into the dishes. Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli found out about this and were furious, so they went on a hunger strike to commit suicide. Li Xian's feeding, the dishes were all freshly cooked, steaming and fragrant, so their appetites naturally increased.

Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli opened their eyes vaguely. Hearing footsteps approaching, they knew Li Xian was coming. The cell was pitch black, and they sighed in their hearts:

"That thief is here again, meaning another day has passed. How long have we been captured? Can they still find us and rescue us? If they can't rescue us, will we be困 (trapped) like this forever?"

Li Xian undid the walnuts. He wrapped them in paper and placed them on the table. He smiled and joked: "Two fairies, it seems you're not much different from mortals. Are the gluttonous worms acting up?"

Bian Qiaoqiao and Nan Gong Liuli's pretty faces turned red. They knew that when Li Xian joked about undoing the walnuts, their stomachs were extremely hungry, and their saliva was hard to hold back, dripping continuously.

Li Xian saw the two sisters' long hair was散乱 (disheveled). Bian Qiaoqiao's ponytail was still okay, tied simply,除了 (except for) being stained with sweat and filth, it couldn't get any messier. Nan Gong Liuli's willow-wind braids, big and small, were intricately woven. Usually, at banquets and gatherings, she was大方得体 (generous and appropriate), gentle and virtuous, with an indescribable charm. After days without care, they were slightly messy. He took a few steps forward and helped comb her long hair.

His hands were extremely skillful. He quickly tidied her up. Nan Gong Liuli was startled and asked strangely: "You thief, how do you know how to braid hair?"

Li Xian smiled: "I know a lot more than that." He pulled out two black cloths and smiled: "Today is a bit different."

As he spoke, his hands moved. Taking advantage of Nan Gong Liuli's unpreparedness, he wrapped the black cloth around her, covering her eyes. Then he stepped over and did the same to Bian Qiaoqiao, covering her eyes.

Nan Gong Liuli was startled, her vision suddenly dark, feeling extreme panic. Bian Qiaoqiao was the same. The two sisters were all cursing, struggling violently. They already couldn't move freely; having their eyes covered made them even more helpless.

Li Xian said: "You always glare at me. I'm afraid you'll do me harm, so I had to resort to this."

Nan Gong Liuli said: "You..." extremely angry. But just as she wanted to say more, a spoonful of food was stuffed in. She opened her mouth to scold, but every time she wanted to speak, food was stuffed in. She tried to spit it out a few times, but because she was extremely hungry, she couldn't bear to waste it.

She ate very aggrieved.

Li Xian opened his Heavy Pupil and observed the mechanisms in the cell.

It turned out... he deliberately covered the two sisters' eyes to reveal his Heavy Pupil and透视 (see through) the细处 (minute details) of the mechanisms. He saw that the cell contained many small holes.

These holes could transmit sounds to other places. Li Xian understood: "So... my conversations with them were eavesdropped on by Ye Cheng like this." Inside and outside the cell, there were hidden mechanisms and secret passages.

Extremely complex.

Ye Cheng had关押 (imprisoned) the two sisters here. Even if they untied the ropes, Ye Cheng would immediately notice. Through the hidden mechanisms and passages, he could immediately杀到 (rush over).

He could also operate the mechanisms. Making the roads winding and twisting; even if the two sisters were strong in martial arts, the winding paths would definitely confuse and迷 (bewilder) them. There was no one guarding this place,恰恰 (precisely) because the defense was extremely tight.

Li Xian sighed: "You two are really unlucky, placed here, at others' mercy. Wanting to escape, I'm afraid it's difficult... My ability is limited. If there's a chance and the time is ripe, I can only consider myself first."

He finished feeding the food and then fed Bian Qiaoqiao. Using this time, he加 (added) more observation, memorizing it in his heart. After the task was done and the two sisters were settled, Li Xian immediately returned to his bedroom.

He immediately drew what he had observed and remembered on paper. What he remembered must have deviations, but six or seven percent should be correct. Li Xian observed the图纸 (diagrams),揣摩 (studying) the hidden mechanisms and passages.

"If I can揣摩 (figure out) one or two tenths, I might be able to use these hidden passages to quietly escape."

Li Xian observed the diagrams, practiced martial arts, and moved the脏浊 (filth of the viscera). It was very充实 (fulfilling), preparing a way out for survival. The mechanism diagrams needed long-term planning, gradually understanding and improving.

\[You moved the脏浊 (filth of the viscera), Proficiency +1\]
\[Five Viscera Avoid Filth Meeting Yang Meridian·Strengthen Five Viscera\]
\[Proficiency: 3/1600 (Proficient)\]
\[Description: You have read the Pure Yang General Principle thoroughly, understanding the meaning of both large and small meridians. The Five Viscera Moving Filth has initially shown results, and you have悟得 (comprehended) the "Clarity" characteristic. The heart's clarity allows you to comprehend all things. It complements the "Observing Heaven and Earth" characteristic.\]

Li Xian was immersed in his gains and harvests.

At the same time, outside the flower ship, someone was踏着 (treading on) a light boat, slowly approaching the flower ship.
