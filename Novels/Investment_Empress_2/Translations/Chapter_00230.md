# Chapter 230: She Is Everywhere (1/2)

At the peak of Sword Tower.

The strange scenery formed by the strange stones around the peak of Sword Tower remained unchanged at first glance. However, upon closer observation, one could still notice some differences.

For example, there were a few more swimming fish in the clear spring, and the trees were more lush...

Li Mo had just finished copying the strange stone three times, and without exception, he was always a little off.

So he stood at the top of Sword Tower, gazing into the distance in a daze.

"That side is the Sword Pond..."

As soon as Li Mo saw that circular giant plaza, the image of Ice Cube standing on the high platform, pointing things out with a ruler, appeared in his mind.

Ice Cube always had an aura of possessing the truth.

Little Li could even imagine what she was saying at which part.

Where she needed to demonstrate, what kind of look she gave to disciples with poor aptitude...

"Wait, why did the scenes from last night also pop up?"

"She keeps popping up in my mind."

Li Mo couldn't help but mutter to himself. He should be focusing his spirit on copying the strange stone right now...

"What are you looking at?"

The speaker was Wei Zhaoliu.

She was still wearing those glasses made from北海圆晶 (North Sea Round Crystal), her face was somewhat indistinct, and her hair was much shorter than before. From her aura, it seemed she had just gone to observe the strange stone again.

"Looking at the Fairy of Cold."

Li Mo's gaze was still fixed on the Sword Pond side as he said.

"Huh? Can you see that?"

Wei Zhaoliu widened her eyes, thinking to herself that this Young Hero Li's eyesight was truly terrifying. She then nodded and said:

"Oh, you're talking about Ying Bing. I went to listen to her lecture. It's truly like looking up at a towering mountain. It's laughable that I once wanted to compare myself to her..."

Li Mo asked, "Why is your hair so much shorter?"

"Well, every time I listen to her lecture, I feel my Sword Dao has improved. Then I come back and try to erase that hammer mark."

"And then?"

"I fail every time. So, to remind myself of the lesson, I cut off a strand of my hair to show my determination."

"...... It does look like you've gotten a bit stronger."

A sense of guilt suddenly welled up in Li Mo's heart.

However, Ice Cube should share half of this guilt. If it weren't for her, Wei Zhaoliu wouldn't keep thinking she's got it figured out.

I should try to finish copying the strange stone as soon as possible.

That way, I won't see the day Wei Zhaoliu goes bald.

"Why does he keep drawing that strange stone?"

Wei Zhaoliu was puzzled. Was this a new way of cultivation?

Creating Viewing God Diagrams?

There were Sword City seniors who had this idea before, but it always came to nothing. The reason was that the strange stone itself didn't seem to be something that could be observed. The sword marks on it could be.

But there were very few people qualified to bear the divine intent of those sword marks...

Li Mo sat down in front of the strange stone on his own.

He took out his brush, ink, paper, and inkstone. The ink was ground by Ice Cube while she was having tea in the morning.

The originally abundant stock of Qingmai Jade Slips was now down to just five pieces.

Little Li gathered his spirits. The Sword City allowed him to observe the strange stone, but he couldn't take it away.

Before leaving Yunzhou, he had to draw it...

"This stone... it shouldn't just be a stone."

Little Li muttered to himself.

...

Sword Pond.

In the past, when Sword Dao experts came to Yunzhou to lecture, there was no break time. Since Ying Bing came, this rule was changed.

What she taught was the great Dao's simplicity, but it required time to comprehend and ponder.

Otherwise, she might lecture on, and others wouldn't understand.

A break of about half an hour wasn't too long, nor too short.

Ying Bing held Tian Shuang and stood on the high platform of Sword Pond. She simply brewed a pot of clear tea and closed her eyes to rest.

When a person is quiet, they tend to overthink.

So, as soon as she closed her eyes, her thoughts drifted back to last night—the private room with hazy moonlight and flickering candlelight... The touch was unforgettable, and the more she tried to forget it, the more real it seemed.

Even the warmth of his palm seemed to linger...

Below, some of the more intelligent disciples had wisdom shining in their eyes.

"Is Fairy Ying Bing having another epiphany?"

"Wow... she mastered a supreme sword technique in the blink of an eye! It's very likely!"

---

"I wonder what profound Sword Dao she's contemplating now..."

The disciples looked at each other, but didn't dare to speak too loudly.

They were afraid of disturbing Ying Bing's 'enlightenment'.

Ying Bing: "....."

No, I can't keep thinking about it.

She took out her tea set, intending to brew tea to distract herself, but her gaze suddenly paused.

Was this her tea table?

The tea set on the table was a gift from Li Mo not long ago. It looked simple, but the material was actually very precious. Unfortunately, there was only one cup.

The only cup this morning was casually taken by him to drink from.

The tea leaves were casually given by him, the tea table was hammered by him, and the small snacks for tea were made by him.

Besides that...

*Gurgle gurgle...* The water used to rinse the tea was poured onto the big-headed doll beside her.

Hmm...

Since this minor treasure was very durable, it became her tea pet.

Even the tea pet was a chibi version of Li Mo's big-headed doll!

"When... had his shadow left her side everywhere?"

"Truly..."

Ying Bing pursed her lips and gently poked the big-headed doll's forehead with a finger.

Then, her eyes moved slightly, and she picked up a tea leaf and stuck it on the chibi Li Mo's philtrum.

Last time she stuck a note on his philtrum, he seemed quite unconvinced...

"Miss Ying..."

"Miss Ying?"

The person beside her called out twice before she turned her head.

"It's almost time for the lecture."

The one reminding her was Elder Zeng. He looked at the doll and suddenly raised an eyebrow, leaning back slightly.

"Alright..."

Ying Bing stood up and收拾 her tea set.

Why didn't she feel the break time was this short before...

"What were you looking at just now?"

"Looking at..."

Ying Bing twisted the big-headed doll's head back and lowered her eyes to think for a moment.

"King of the Harem Douluo?"

"???"

...

"Drawing alone is not enough."

"Also need to experience it personally..."

After ruining another Qingmai Jade Slip, Li Mo stood up.

He approached the strange stone and slowly reached out his hand to touch it.

Strangely enough.

The moment he touched the strange stone, the seven Xuan Dans inside his body flickered faintly.

Following the cycle of the celestial circuit, their rotation speed grew faster and faster, even starting to tremble slightly, with the commotion growing larger and larger.

*Boom—*

Li Mo felt an inexplicable realization.

This inexplicable connection wasn't because of the Xuan Dans themselves, but because they were all stars within his world seed.

Like attracts like, they seemed to have encountered their own kind.

"Huu..."

Li Mo suddenly discovered that he seemed to be able to penetrate the surface of the strange stone and understand its true mystery.

This was something he had never seen before when he was previously comprehending martial arts on it.

"What's wrong with him?"

However, not far away.

In Wei Zhaoliu's eyes, Li Mo was just in a daze.

There was no special movement, but what surprised her was that the strange stone wasn't something that could be easily touched. If one's aptitude wasn't enough, they would probably be overwhelmed by the endless mysteries within in an instant...

The next moment.

The Qingmai Jade Slip suddenly floated up.

Li Mo raised the brush in his hand, splashing ink and writing with vigor. This time, he was no longer cautious, but indescribably free and easy.
