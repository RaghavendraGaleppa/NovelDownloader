# Chapter 125: Sinews, Bones, and Skin Perfected

Yin Hong thought for a moment upon hearing this and refused, "You are not yet sixteen years old, while that Xu Yunfan is much older than you. It would be somewhat unfair. That won't do."

He then looked up at the youth's stubborn gaze and couldn't help but chuckle, "Next year's Awakening of Insects (Jing Zhe), if you can break through the 'Jade Network,' Star Pivot, and Purple Star' barriers, I will allow it."

The so-called Jade Network, Star Pivot, and Purple Star barriers correspond to the training of the sinews, bones, and skin.

The Nine Luminaries Sect's method of tempering sinews, bones, and skin naturally has its profound mysteries.

Before his words had fully faded, Teng Lingchuan suddenly tore open the bandages on his chest.

Three vicious hammer marks extended from his collarbone down to his abdomen. Beneath the dark golden medicinal ointment, jade-colored sinews could be faintly seen writhing, and a hint of gold shimmered beneath his skin.

"Master, seven days ago, I already touched the threshold of the Purple Star barrier. Skin perfection is imminent. With the support of the two perfected refinements, I will surely break through by the coming of spring's Awakening of Insects next year."

Yin Hong was extremely delighted. He immediately noticed that the veins on his disciple's temples were bulging in a spiral shape, which was a sign of the complete mastery of the *Xuánjī Yù Luò Jīng* (Celestial Pivot Jade Network Scripture).

After a long while, he said, "You possess true blood. Why bother getting into a rivalry with a small household? Given time, that Xu Yunfan will only be left far behind by you."

"Hasn't Master always said that those legendary extreme Dao true immortals were once just ordinary mortals who cultivated step by step? If my momentum is weak today, how can I forge ahead bravely and reach the pinnacle?"

Yin Hong suddenly burst into a loud laugh, the sound shaking the iron chains at the cliff's edge into a clattering din. "Good! Good! This is worthy of being a true disciple of my Celestial Pivot Peak!"

***

On that same day, Xu Yunfan stood in the courtyard, his stance neither fully forward nor fully backward. His entire body appeared loose and relaxed. As his bones trembled, they emitted a sound like the faint, continuous chirping of cicadas. This sound provoked the cicadas clinging to the treetops outside the courtyard until they too could not help but start chirping.

*You simultaneously vibrate all 365 bones in your body. As the bones tremble, you trigger the connected sinews and skin, attempting to find the resonant frequency. Your proficiency in Sky Cicada Strength has increased.*

*...*

Looking at the series of proficiency increase prompts appearing in his vision, Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath.

For three consecutive months, Xu Yunfan had not slacked off in the slightest. His proficiency in Sky Cicada Strength increased by at least thirty points every day. In between, due to various moments of enlightenment or sudden inspiration, his proficiency saw massive increases as well.

It was nearly a month earlier than the four months he had initially anticipated.

Today was the day he would push his Bone Refining to perfection.

Until the sun slanted westward, Xu Yunfan's body gradually approached its limit. His muscles and sinews trembled, and his bones felt as if they were about to turn to mush.

*Sky Cicada Strength, 4999/5000 (Great Achievement)*

Glancing at the information floating in his vision, Xu Yunfan's bones trembled, and the cicada-like chirping emitted from the vibrations grew even more grand and rapid.

When the final point of proficiency surfaced from his vision, Xu Yunfan's body trembled slightly.

*Through diligent cultivation, you utilized the resonance of vibrating sound waves to reshape the structure of your bone marrow. When your Qi and blood completely synchronized with the frequency of your bone vibrations, your bones emitted a clear and melodious cicada chirp. Your proficiency in Sky Cicada Strength has increased.*

*Your Sky Cicada Strength has reached Perfection.*

*Sky Cicada Strength (Perfected)*

*Special Effects: Bone Wing Markings, Cicada Chirp Strength, Stacked Cicada Chirps, Pulse Merging Cicada Rhythm, Golden Iron Diaphragm, Myriad Bone Armor, Frightened Cicada Piercing the Sky, Shattering Pulse Severing Gold, Golden Return*

In an instant, a cracking sound like frying beans erupted from Xu Yunfan's spine. The tremor dormant deep within his bone marrow broke through its critical point.

The air resonance phenomenon caused by the bones' frenzied high-frequency vibration made the dust on the flagstones beneath Xu Yunfan's feet stir without any wind, actually outlining a complete human silhouette on the blue bricks.

*Crackle!*

Xu Yunfan felt a massive amount of heat suddenly surge from within his body, nourishing his bones. The distal phalanx of his left pinky began to rapidly turn into jade. Beneath the translucent bone quality, a honeycomb-like crystal structure was visible.

This mutation spread like a plague throughout his entire body. The moment his skull completed its transformation, the old locust tree outside the courtyard suddenly shed its leaves like rain. His bone鸣 frequency had broken through the sensory limit of cicadas, and the cicadas on the trees all exploded in this high-frequency oscillation.

If anyone had recklessly entered the courtyard, their internal organs would likely have had their Qi and blood instantly thrown into disorder by this terrifying vibration, rendering them unable to exert even thirty percent of their strength.

Immediately after, his retinas trembled slightly along with the resonance of his skull. The world in his eyes transformed into countless vibrating strings. The airflow disturbance caused by an ant's antennae swaying three zhang away, the faint seismic waves of an earthworm burrowing underground—all were clearly visible through bone conduction.

With the cicada chirp sounding, it seemed he could perceive subtle changes in his surroundings through vibration.

The originally knotted trapezius muscle suddenly collapsed, its muscle fibers layering and arranging like the strings of a zither.

With his sinews, bones, and skin all perfected, Xu Yunfan could clearly feel his body undergoing an extremely astonishing transformation.

Xu Yunfan hooked his hand backward to grasp the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. The meteorite iron reed on the hammer handle perfectly matched the resonance frequency of his bones.

Inspired by a sudden insight, he swung the hammer and struck the void. The nearly four hundred catty heavy hammer actually tore a visible vacuum turbulence in the air.

The Flying Leg's great sinew snapped, the Red Copper Body's Cloak Hammer's skin and flesh bulged in diamond patterns, and the overlapping shockwaves of the Sky Cicada Strength created a空爆 (sonic boom) effect.

*Boom!*

The water vat three zhang away shattered at the sound. Before the water could hit the ground, it was shaken into mist.

It seemed the transformation brought about by the perfection of Sky Cicada Strength's Bone Refining was complete.

Just as Xu Yunfan's mind was receiving a segment of cultivation memory regarding Sky Cicada Strength that had spontaneously appeared, his sinews, bones, and skin trembled violently.

"Hm?"

Before Xu Yunfan could investigate, the muscles all over his body began to shake violently.

In an instant, a drum-like roar suddenly erupted from Xu Yunfan's sternum. His heart's pumping speed broke through the realm of reason at this moment.

Twelve beats per second pushed mercury-thick blood into his four limbs and hundred bones. The blue veins on his body's surface bulged like the gnarled roots of an old tree but quickly smoothed out under the suppression of the subcutaneous bone armor.

*Red Copper Body*, *Sky Cicada Strength*, and Flying Leg merged together. With the perfection of sinews, bones, and skin, a mutation began to occur. The viscosity of his blood increased threefold in this short span of breath, and its oxygen-carrying capacity was comparable to that of a river or sea dragon.

The very next instant, before Xu Yunfan could react, his trapezius muscle collapsed to one-third of its original volume, its muscle fibers arranged in a composite spring-like shape.

The moment he subconsciously bent his elbow, the muscle groups on his body released kinetic energy in a seven-stage contraction. The fist, breaking through the sound barrier, generated a conical shockwave that, sweeping horizontally, tore a stone lock one zhang away into pieces.

What was even more bizarre was the dark golden fascia that grew between the muscle bundles. These mutated tissues, generated because the three martial arts had reached perfection, possessed a toughness and the force they could drive far beyond what he had imagined.

Golden skin and jade network, jade bones and dragon-like sinews!

At the very least, the strength he could now unleash far exceeded his previous best.

Even the mountain beneath his feet made him feel a sense of regret that the earth had no ring and the sky had no handle, so that he could lift them, as his body underwent rapid transformation.

What made him feel even more panicked was that the gaps between his ribs began to rapidly spread with the growth of periosteum, quickly filling the bone seams.

This is!?

Plated Ribs and Dragon Sinews!

One of the innate martial talents, it had actually manifested under the state of his perfected sinews, bones, and skin.
