# Chapter 64: Zhuang Yunde's Guidance

"The Spirit Talisman Pavilion is quite generous—their usual income must be substantial."

Exiting the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a surge of joy in his heart.

After giving Chu Ning the jade slip containing talisman-making techniques, Liao Yunming had also presented him with five talismans. Unlike the low-grade primary talismans Chu Ning had purchased before, four of these were mid-grade primary talismans. One was even a high-grade primary talisman—and it was a defensive talisman, the most valuable type.

As Liao Yunming had put it, the Spirit Talisman Pavilion might lack many things, but talismans were certainly not among them. Though Chu Ning knew the pavilion specialized in talisman-making, he was still astonished by the gift of a high-grade talisman on his first visit.

Before he left, Liao Yunming had even given him 500 blank talisman papers, urging him to practice diligently. He was told he could seek guidance from senior brothers if he encountered difficulties and was introduced to a disciple named Tan Jing.

Though Chu Ning already had a considerable stock of talisman papers, the comprehensive gifts from the Spirit Talisman Pavilion left him deeply impressed. Reflecting on today's unexpected gains, his steps felt lighter.

For Chu Ning, joining the Spirit Talisman Pavilion and acquiring talisman-making techniques was undoubtedly a major achievement. But another significant milestone was his official promotion to an outer sect disciple!

Previously, he had known that revealing his true cultivation level would guarantee his promotion. However, to protect the secret of his ever-refreshing talent, he had refrained from displaying his rapid progress. Yet, he had always harbored ambitions to become an outer sect disciple, fully aware of the vast differences between a servant disciple and an outer sect disciple in the Qingxi Sect.

The assistance Zhuang Yunde had provided regarding body refinement and spiritual plant cultivation was just the tip of the iceberg. Later, the differences would extend to the selection of cultivation techniques—Chu Ning's current "Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique" only covered cultivation methods up to the late Qi Refining stage.

Moreover, servant disciples were typically limited to purchasing items in the market, while outer sect disciples could access the outer sect's Treasure Pavilion, which offered greater convenience and better prices. The list of advantages went on.

Now, achieving outer sect disciple status through this method was an unexpected delight for Chu Ning.

Following He Changyou's earlier instructions, Chu Ning intended to head straight to the spiritual plantation's training grounds outside the outer sect. But after some thought, he decided to make a detour to the residences of Zhuang Yunde and Mu Ling.

---

When he first entered the outer sect, Zhuang Yunde had likely guessed the reason for his presence. Though Zhuang Yunde had benefited from their interactions, his guidance and assistance had far outweighed any gains. Additionally, Mu Ling had provided him with crucial information. Out of gratitude, it seemed only right to thank both of them.

He first went to Mu Ling's residence—after all, they were now fellow members of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. However, Mu Ling wasn't home, so Chu Ning left a message talisman at her door, informing her of his success in the competition and expressing his thanks for her earlier tip.

Next, he headed to Zhuang Yunde's residence. Before he could even greet the man, Zhuang Yunde spotted him from a distance and called out first.

"Junior Brother Chu, I've already heard your good news! Congratulations on becoming a dual-hall outer sect disciple!"

Chu Ning was surprised by Zhuang Yunde's quick access to information and replied, "I was just coming to share the news with you, Senior Brother Zhuang. I didn't expect you to already know."

"I just returned from the training grounds—Elder He mentioned it," Zhuang Yunde explained before gesturing toward his courtyard. "It's not convenient to talk here. Let's go inside."

Once inside, Zhuang Yunde's round face broke into his usual cheerful smile. "I assume you just left the Spirit Talisman Pavilion and were on your way to see Elder He?"

Chu Ning nodded. Since Zhuang Yunde had come from the spiritual plantation's training grounds, it made sense he would know.

Zhuang Yunde grinned. "Did you know there's another piece of good news waiting for you?"

Chu Ning was momentarily puzzled. "What do you mean?"

Without further ado, Zhuang Yunde advised, "When Elder He asks, make sure to mention all the gifts the Spirit Talisman Pavilion's elder gave you—even the ones promised for the future."

"Why?" Chu Ning asked, still confused.

Zhuang Yunde chuckled. "The Hundred Arts Hall isn't highly regarded in the sect, and Elder He's spiritual plantation division holds even less prestige. Now that you've become a dual-hall disciple, if Elder He learns how generously the Spirit Talisman Pavilion has treated you—given his prideful nature—what do you think he'll do?" He smirked meaningfully. "He won't just stand by without offering something, will he?"

The implication was now clear to Chu Ning. He couldn't help but admire Zhuang Yunde's sharp instincts and skill in seizing opportunities. No wonder Zhuang Yunde, despite being only a steward disciple in the Ding District, lived so comfortably.

"Thank you for the advice, Senior Brother," Chu Ning said with a respectful bow.

Zhuang Yunde accepted the gesture with a smile before continuing, "Our spiritual plantation division doesn't have as many treasures as the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. Rare spiritual plants are either held by the hall's elders or controlled by the sect itself. However, Elder He does possess cultivation methods for some uncommon spiritual plants. Also, since you're new, you probably haven't mastered many spells or acquired many artifacts. Feel free to ask for those. If nothing else, you can always request more spirit stones..."

Chu Ning was momentarily speechless at Zhuang Yunde's ingrained shrewdness. After expressing his gratitude, he took his leave.

As he made his way toward the spiritual plantation, a question lingered in Chu Ning's mind: Given Zhuang Yunde's cunning, why would he risk participating in the sect's perilous mission a month later? Was it truly just for the chance to enter the inner sect and access better resources for his breakthrough?

The thought flickered briefly before fading. What occupied him more was whether He Changyou would indeed reward him as Zhuang Yunde had predicted. With that in mind, he quickened his pace.
