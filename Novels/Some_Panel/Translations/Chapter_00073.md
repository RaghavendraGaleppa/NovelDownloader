# Chapter 72: All Is Complete

The exchange of cultivation arts had completely fallen through. Although Yang Ji had previously coveted the *Golden Light Evasion* technique, that intense desire had waned significantly after acquiring the Sword Wings. He believed that if he went to the Dao Sect, he could personally acquire a powerful movement-based divine ability through his own efforts. There was no need to humble himself before the Evergreen Sect. Some things simply couldn't be begged for.

The council disbanded, and everyone returned to their respective peaks.

Inside the secret chamber, Yang Ji once again began his secluded cultivation. It truly echoed the saying: "Time flies unnoticed in the mountains, but a thousand years have passed in the world." While a thousand years hadn't passed, spring had given way to autumn, and summer to winter. Another twenty-five years had already gone by, truly a testament to the mercilessness of time.

When he first transmigrated to this immortal cultivation world, Yang Ji had imagined he would be like the protagonists in novels, raising his sword to strike, enacting swift vengeance, and reaching the pinnacle within mere decades. But he had been mistaken. Cultivation was not so easy; just as one eats mouthful by mouthful, how could the path of pursuing eternal life be so smooth? From Sensing the Dao at the Void Refinement stage to Questioning the Dao and Proving the Dao, without thousands of years of cultivation, one couldn't hope to become an immortal. Yang Ji was merely a minor cultivator, not yet qualified to even Sense the Dao.

His days of secluded cultivation weren't filled with many enemies or grievances. Not much happened within a year. Most of his time intertwined with the flow of moments was spent on cultivation. He was just an ordinary person in these mundane years, struggling fiercely to reach longevity.

Twenty-five years had passed since the last Supreme Council meeting. And it was in this very year, thanks to the vast quantity of Nine Revolutions Golden Cores he had consumed, that he finally reached the Golden Core Peak.

**Name:** Yang Ji
**Root Bone:** Medium
**Lifespan:** 111/500
**Realm:** Golden Core Peak [Nine-Patterned Golden Core] (1,536,000/1,536,000)
**Cultivation Arts:** *Ling Shui Art* (Low-Grade), *True-Adamant Divine Art* (Dao-Grade)
**Great Divine Abilities:** *Humanoid Weapon* [Volume 1] (Perfected), [Volume 2] (Minor Accomplishment)
**Great Divine Abilities:** *Universal Shift* (Great Accomplishment)
**Great Divine Abilities:** *Guizang Sword Art* [Li Sword Dao (Perfected Sword Soul)], [Zhen Sword Dao (Perfected Sword Soul)], [Xun Sword Dao (Perfected Sword Soul)], [Dui Sword Dao (Perfected Sword Soul)])
**Spells:** *Water Following Sword Art* (Perfected), *Light Body Art* (Perfected)

He had joined the Azure Waves Sect at the age of twenty-eight, and eighty-three years had flown by in a blink. If not for the Azure Waves Sect and the Sword Dao Projection, he estimated he would still be an insignificant nobody. The inexplicable twists of fate truly defied explanation.

The *True-Adamant Divine Art* he possessed could only support his cultivation up to the Golden Core Peak. To break through to the Nascent Soul stage and condense a Heaven-Earth Manifestation to pass the Wind Tribulation, he would still need to complete the cultivation art at the Dao Sect. However, he didn't depart immediately, as his other techniques had not yet all reached perfection.

Although all four forms of the *Guizang Sword Art* had achieved Perfected Sword Souls, they had not yet reached the highest realm of "Man-Sword Unity." In that realm, the Sword Soul merges with the Divine Soul, and a mere glance can cause sword intent to burst forth. It was truly unfathomable, the ability to kill with a stare. Grass, dust, air, and even people would become his swords; a single thought would transform all things into swords. Where his will passed, there would be an invincible sword domain, filled with endless sharpness. A true grandmaster of the Sword Dao needed no sword to kill; a single glance was sufficient. What a terrifying realm it was, to make all things perish with a single thought? Yang Ji was only one step away from touching it. He would not go to the Dao Sect until he had achieved Man-Sword Unity, the transformation of will into sword, and the formation of a sword domain. If he went, he would stay.

Besides the *Guizang Sword Art*, *Universal Shift* had also not yet reached perfection. If perfected, *Universal Shift* would allow the internal energy to harness the momentum of heaven and earth. Such a movement technique, borrowing the power of heaven and earth, would be truly unpredictable, ever-changing in an instant, like gods and ghosts. However, it had already reached Great Accomplishment, not far from perfection.

As for *Humanoid Weapon*, Yang Ji knew that it would be difficult to cultivate it to its peak in a short period. But with the Sword Wings protecting him, comparable to a treasure armor, ordinary attacks could not harm him. Furthermore, what pleased him most was the Soul Refining Method of *Humanoid Weapon*; his Divine Soul was three times stronger than that of an ordinary Golden Core Peak cultivator. This meant that once the *Guizang Sword Art* reached Man-Sword Unity, with the Sword Soul merging with the Divine Soul, the resulting sword domain would be the same as the range of his Divine Sense, which would be three times larger than that of cultivators at the same stage. How terrifying was that? Such powerful Divine Sense was comparable to even a low-tier Nascent Soul True Monarch. At that time, his sword domain would form in an instant, and any enemies within it would be savagely shredded by surging sword qi.

Yang Ji did not continue his secluded cultivation afterward, as his cultivation had reached its limit. He began to hone his techniques. The best way to hone techniques was through practical combat. He fought against Lun Nu, and against his master, Jian Yuanzi. His combat experience continuously improved. Various techniques were employed with incredible proficiency, the skills he had immersed himself in for decades now shining brightly, his personal artistry constantly progressing. In addition, he also fought against the sect's various Nascent Soul True Monarchs. His future opponents and enemies wouldn't be static, and battling different people to adapt to different combat styles was of great benefit to him.

As the battles continued, Yang Ji discovered that if he went all out, he could instantly kill all Golden Core Perfected Persons within the sect. Even the weaker Nascent Soul True Monarchs were no match for him. Although his realm was insufficient, the deployment of his various divine abilities and techniques compensated for this flaw. When he unleashed a sword strike, even ordinary Nascent Soul True Monarchs dared not meet its sharpness. The reason was simply that the cultivation arts they practiced were of too low a level, and their unleashed power was insufficient.

Despite being able to contend with Nascent Soul True Monarchs, Yang Ji did not become conceited. If he were to face another genius Nascent Soul True Monarch who had also cultivated a great divine ability, he probably wouldn't even be able to withstand a single strike from them. This was the suppression brought about by absolute power combined with absolute realm.

In addition to fighting Nascent Soul True Monarchs, Yang Ji also frequently sparred with Supreme Being Whitebrow, seeking pressure. Under that extreme pressure, he fought with even greater focus and seriousness. For more than ten years, he had been seeking battles. Everyone knew that it wouldn't be long before the sect's second genius would depart for the Dao Sect. Therefore, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs were very excited and eager, constantly engaging him in various forms of combat. They set up formations, used talismans, teamed up, launched sneak attacks, or challenged him with taunts, using every possible method to help him improve his state of mind and combat prowess. Yang Ji did not disappoint; his strength grew day by day, and his combat skills were remarkably superb, allowing him to calmly handle various attack methods. Most importantly, all of this was the super combat power he unleashed *without* relying on his "Golden Finger" (system/cheat) for assistance.

For ten years, he fought every day as if it were one. On this particular day, an invincible sword intent surged outwards from him, encompassing the Azure Waves Sect. All flying swords within the sect that touched this sword intent clanged and hummed, soaring into the sky, converging towards him, forming the miraculous scene of "Ten Thousand Swords Returning to the Source." Yang Ji knew: the sword domain was complete.

Supreme Being Whitebrow gazed from afar, also knowing what this meant.

"My disciple... is leaving." Jian Yuanzi stood on Sword Dao Peak, looking at the figure standing mid-air, surrounded by ten thousand swords, a look of relief and reluctance on his face. The group of Nascent Soul True Monarchs also watched this scene with joy.

**Great Divine Abilities:** *Humanoid Weapon* [Volume 1] (Perfected), [Volume 2] (Great Accomplishment)
**Great Divine Abilities:** *Universal Shift* (Perfected)

Yang Ji looked at his attributes: his sword domain was complete, *Universal Shift* had reached perfection, and the second volume of *Humanoid Weapon* had reached Great Accomplishment, making his body comparable to a high-grade spiritual artifact. Everything had reached a satisfactory level for him.

Yang Ji gazed into the distance, in the direction of the Dao Sect. His cultivation had begun on Southwind Island, grown within the Azure Waves Sect, and the Dao Sect would be the place of his true rise. However, before he went, he planned to first make a trip to the Demon-Stained Sea Region to get some Demon-Attracting Grass from Mang Biao. Additionally, one hundred years had passed, and the legacy left by Senior Fu Dongliu beneath the undersea waterfall was also about to open. He was curious: what kind of geniuses would those be who came to claim the legacy?
